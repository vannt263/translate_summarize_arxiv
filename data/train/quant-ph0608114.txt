    "detecting the probability of finding the second particle in state @xmath4 gives us @xmath10 allowing for the determination of @xmath6 .",
    "based on this discussion , we can now define the total phase gained by a system after its evolution .",
    "the definition used here is the same as proposed by pancharatnam @xcite . in his seminal work , he defined the phase of a quantum state @xmath11 relative to another state @xmath12 as @xmath13 this definition is called from now on the _ total _ ( global ) phase .",
    "the total global phase gain may originate from a combination of phase effects of different types .",

    "however , dynamical phases are not the only type of phase appearing during a state s evolution . in order to be more precise ,",

    "the hilbert space of such a system has a certain geometry that can be described by the bloch sphere .",
    "this geometry accounts for _ geometric phase _ gains .",
    "such phases were first introduced in quantum mechanical systems by m. berry @xcite and can lead to some amazing and counter intuitive effects associated to particles and their trajectories .",
    "one of the most famous of such effects is the aharanov - bohm effect , in which a measurable meaning is given to the vector potential .",
    "the geometric phase depends on the trajectory realized by the qubit under the action of an evolution operator . for cyclic evolutions ,",
    "it is given by half the solid angle of the closed path traced in the bloch sphere , i.e. , the area of the surface enclosed by the trajectory .",
    "the development of quantum mechanics motivated new questions and problems concerning geometric phases .",
    "these problems involve the study of geometric phases in many particle entangled systems @xcite , such as twin photons @xcite and bose - einstein condensates @xcite .",

    "it was shown that conditional quantum logics , a fundamental part to realize universal quantum computation , can be done using geometric phases @xcite , a result already demonstrated experimentally @xcite .",
    "the interest of these so called topological gates is that they are more robust and naturally fault tolerant @xcite .",
    "these recent results together with the fundamental interest of the subject , are a motivation for the present work : we study here the geometric representation of the phase dynamics of pure two - level bipartite systems with an arbitrary degree of entanglement .",
    "for this kind of system , a third possible type of global phase gain can be identified : a _ topological _ phase , which is a consequence of the geometry of the entangled two - level system .",
    "this phase has been studied in @xcite for maximally entangled states ( mes ) and it is at the origin of singularities appearing in the phase of mes during a cyclic evolution @xcite . the topological origin of this phase can be made clear by applying the geometric representation of pure entangled qubits presented in @xcite . as shown in the present paper , the use of the same representation allows for a clear geometric picture showing the origin and interplay between the three mentioned different types of phases during the state s evolution .",
    "it is shown that , after a cyclic evolution , the combination of the phases presented above always lead to a global phase gain of an entire multiple of @xmath0 .",
    "this result , already known and verified experimentally @xcite for a single qubit is recovered here for entangled qubits with an arbitrary degree of entanglement .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : we start by studying the case of one qubit and analogous systems , investigating their geometric representation and phases acquired during a cyclic evolution .",
    "we do so to set notations and notions for the geometric representation and phase dynamics of two qubit systems , presented in section iii .",

    "it has been shown @xcite that this way of representing the space of one qubit is analogous to the bloch sphere : the base can be identified to the bloch sphere while the fiber represents the global phase indetermination of such a representation . taking the general pure state @xmath18 , where @xmath19 and @xmath20 are complex coefficients ,",

    ", the state reads @xmath26 , where @xmath27 is the frequency of the applied field . in the bloch sphere",

    "we see that after the @xmath29 rotation the global phase gain is equal to @xmath0 , irrespectively of the choice of the initial state . nevertheless , the _ nature _ of this phase depends on the initial state and on the hamiltonian acting on it .",

    "a point in the bloch ball determines the density matrix with no global phase ambiguity . also , the phases involved in a cyclic evolution of a mixed state deserves more attention .",
    "the global phase , analogous to the pancharatnam s phase , is given by @xmath47 $ ] @xcite .",
    "for the geometric phase , there are different definitions in the literature @xcite .",
    "the choice made here presents a clear advantage for our purposes , as will become clear in the following . in order to calculate the geometric phase",
    ", one should purify the mixed state appearing in the bloch ball .",
    "this is done , geometrically , by prolongation of the density matrix vector until it reaches the unitary bloch sphere . as a consequence ,",
    "one gets two pure states , pointing in opposite directions ( see fig .",
    "( [ fig2 ] ) ) .",
    "the geometric phase is given by the weighted sum of each pure state s geometric phase .",

    "more recently , some extensions to this study were made , always with the help of mes @xcite . in @xcite",
    "we made use of the geometric tools developed in @xcite to explicit the origin of the phase obtained by a mes in a cyclic evolution .",
    "an interesting property of mes is that , as will become clear in the following , it does not gain , in a cyclic evolution , neither a geometric nor a dynamical phase .",
    "however , one can still observe a @xmath0 dephasing for some evolutions , identified as being from topological origin . in the following ,",
    "a more complete geometric picture of the space of two entangled qubits is presented , and it is shown how different types of phases can appear for non mes .",
    "in this section , we summarize the results presented in @xcite where a geometric representation of the space of pure two qubit states in presented .",
    "this is done with the help of hopf fibrations , as in the case of one qubit states .",
    "the main idea is to find a way which is analogous ( or at least connected ) to the bloch sphere representation presented above .",
    "consider a general pure entangled state with arbitrary coefficients @xmath54 and @xmath55 : @xmath56 state ( [ initstate ] ) is normalized , and can be represented by a @xmath57 sphere in @xmath58 .",
    "a tempting but insufficient way to represent ( [ initstate ] ) geometrically is to make a partial trace of one of the qubits and study the properties of the resulting density matrix .",
    "this density matrix can be , as seen before , represented in the bloch ball .",
    "this naive method , even if dependent on the degree of entanglement of the initial state , lacks information : the resulting mixed density matrix could originate from an infinite number of entangled states with the same degree of entanglement .",
    "however , with the help of a map defining a hopf fibration , one can combine to this reduced density matrix another space where the rest of the needed information can be found .",
    "this other space is the fiber space , defined as @xmath59 .",
    "the fiber space can be represented as another @xmath14 sphere of radius @xmath0 with opposite points ( points differing by a global phase ) identified .",
    "the combination of the bloch ball and the fiber completes the hopf map , where @xmath57 is described by a basis @xmath60 and a fiber @xmath14 via the relation @xmath61 ( see fig ( [ fig4 ] ) ) .",
    "it is the @xmath60 sphere s coordinates ( base ) which are related to the bloch ball .",
    "they are given by @xmath62 the first three coordinates can be identified to the bloch ball coordinates .",
    "the last two also appear in a way in the bloch ball : they are connected to its radius as @xmath63 .",
    "moreover , @xmath64 and @xmath65 are related to the concurrence @xmath66 defined by wooters @xcite by the relation @xmath67 .",
    "the concurrence is a measurement of the degree of entanglement for this system .",
    "it assumes the value of 1 for mes and 0 for separable states .",
    "some particularities of this representation that can be directly verified are worth being mentioned . for mes",
    "@xmath68 , the bloch ball reduces to a point .",
    "mes are thus completely characterized by @xmath69 .",
    "this result is related to the fact that all maximally entangled states are connected by a local rotation .",
    "the reduction of mes to @xmath69 is also the reason why one can not have geometric phases for mes .",
    "the global phase in this case should come only from the properties of @xmath69 .",
    "for separable states @xmath70 , the bloch ball is the bloch sphere , and the same happens to the fiber , so that one ends up with two independent bloch spheres , one for each qubit , as expected . in the intermediate case , i.e. , for states with @xmath71 , as mentioned before , one needs @xmath69 and the bloch ball to completely represent the entangled state . in this case , _ to each point in the bloch ball is associated a fiber @xmath69_.    now we should gain some insight on how arbitrary entangled states are represented in @xmath69 .",
    "this can be done with the help of fig .",
    "( [ fig5 ] ) , where @xmath69 is represented as a sphere of radius @xmath0 with opposite points identified .",
    "each point of the @xmath69 sphere appearing in fig ( [ fig5 ] ) is an entangled state . choosing the origin to be state @xmath72 , it is our initial state . applying a rotation to one of the qubits about a given axis displaces it in the sphere in the following way : the state performs a trajectory in the direction of the applied rotation .",
    "the angle of rotation is the distance of the final state to the the center of the sphere ( initial state ) . in this way ,",
    "a rotation about the @xmath22 axis performed in the first qubit , for example , creates a displacement along the @xmath22 axis of the sphere , leading to state @xmath73 .",
    "when @xmath74 , the state produced can be represented in the north pole of the sphere , i.e. , @xmath75 .",
    "analogously , by applying such local rotations , all the other entangled states with the same degree of entanglement can be generated and represented , as depicted in fig .",
    "( [ fig5 ] ) .    for the purposes of this paper ,",
    "the geometric representation described above is quite useful .",
    "we are interested in state evolutions that do not change the degree of entanglement of the initial state and are applied to one of the qubits .",
    "such evolutions can thus be geometrically represented in two equivalent ways .",
    "defining , in a general pure two qubit system @xmath76 , the first and second qubits by the subscripts @xmath77 , let s consider that the evolution operator acts on the first qubit only . by tracing with respect to the second ( fixed ) qubit",
    ", the density matrix vector relative to the first ( evolved ) qubit describes a trajectory in the bloch ball .",

    "we see that for the three values of @xmath123 one can , effectively , define two types of trajectory . however , the closer we are to mes ( @xmath127 ) , the more abrupt the phase gain becomes , until it reaches a discontinuity for @xmath127 . in this limit case , the phase is either zero or @xmath0 during the whole trajectory and the discontinuity represents the gain of the topological phase . as seen before , it is a consequence of state s @xmath128 crossing the border of the @xmath69 sphere in the middle of the trajectory ( @xmath129 ) .",
    "fig([fig7 ] ) shows that the same happens for non mes .",
    "let s consider now the same trajectories but trace with respect to the fixed qubit .",
    "this results on the reduced density matrix of the evolved qubit .",
    "this density matrix performs a trajectory in the bloch ball . as mentioned above",
    ", the existence of the two types of trajectory is a mathematical result , valid for the entangled pure state , that must be reproduced in the two situations : tracing with respect to the evolved or the fixed qubit . by tracing with respect to the fixed qubit , one can calculate the global phase from its definition ( [ pancha ] ) . in order to do so , we should first calculate the scalar product : @xmath130 in the expression above , @xmath131 and @xmath85 are the coordinates of the bloch vector of the reduced density matrix and the vector @xmath104 was taken as a function of time , as proposed in @xcite . in the example studied , @xmath132 suffers discontinuous changes corresponding to the different axes of rotation .",
    "we see that eq.([sp ] ) is completely determined by the coordinates of the reduced density matrix vector in the bloch ball and the same result could be obtained by calculating the mixed state total phase @xmath133 $ ] .",
    "one can see that for the particular initial state ( [ aiai ] ) and the sequence of rotations under consideration , the scalar product never reaches the value of zero , so there is no discontinuity in the phase .",
    "this result has already been seen in fig.([fig7 ] ) as being a consequence of the trajectory of the entangled state in @xmath69 .",
    "however , eq.([sp ] ) shows clearly that the same result can be obtained from information on the hamiltonian and the reduced density matrix only .",
    "eq.([sp ] ) also shows that a total @xmath109 phase still appears .",
    "this result can be seen as being a consequence of the parity of the number of times the initial state crosses the border of the @xmath69 sphere or of the area of the trajectory of the reduced density matrix in the bloch ball combined to the dynamical phase .",
    "we can now calculate the contribution coming from the dynamical and the geometric phases of the reduced density matrix .",
    "the calculation of the dynamical phase is performed from its definition ( [ dina ] ) .",
    "it is given by the integral @xmath134 that can be seen as the integral of the scalar product between the density matrix vector and the direction of rotation @xmath135 .",
    "for this specific example , the dynamical phase is still zero .",
    "it is thus the geometric phase that explains the existence of the two types of trajectories .",
    "the two different sequences of evolution operators lead to different trajectories in the bloch ball that are independent of the degree of entanglement .",
    "they are shown in fig.([fig9 ] ) .",
    "the area of each one of this trajectories can be calculated , and by weighting them using the techniques of section ii , one finds the two possible global phases , @xmath136 or @xmath0 .",
    "( minus trajectory ) , and ( b ) @xmath111 ( plus trajectory ) .",
    ", width=192 ]    we see that either one can obtain the total global phase of a non mes entangled state from the topological properties of @xmath69 , or by geometric properties of a reduced density matrix .",
    "this means that by looking at a subsystem of the entangled state gives us information about its global phase .    as a general rule",
    ", the scalar product ( [ sp ] ) and the dynamical phase ( [ dinamic ] ) can tell us all about the types of phases appearing in an evolution . to illustrate that , let s study a simpler hamiltonian , describing a rotation around only one fixed axis , say , the @xmath22 axis .",
    "for a general state of the type ( [ arb ] ) , ( [ sp ] ) depends on @xmath37 as @xmath137 .",
    "the dynamic phase for this case is @xmath138 .",
    "notice that , apart from a scaling factor depending on the degree of entanglement @xmath139 , it has the same form as for pure states .",
    "the cyclic geometric phase also depends on @xmath37 and @xmath123 .",
    "it is given by @xmath140 , plotted in fig .",
    "( [ fig8 ] ) .",
    "the connection of this phase to the pure state case is not direct .",
    "however , some limit cases are reproduced .",
    "first , notice that for @xmath141 ( mes ) , @xmath38 and @xmath32 vanish , as expected .",
    "also , for separable states ( @xmath124 ) , @xmath38 oscillates with @xmath37 as in the pure state example discussed in section ii . at the same time , in this limit , the total phase is a linear function of time , as one should expect .",
    "the dependence of the phases on @xmath37 of @xmath38 is also interesting : in the limit @xmath142 , @xmath32 and @xmath38 show that the total global phase is of geometric nature only , a result analogous to the one found for one qubit states . however , for @xmath89 , the analogy with the one qubit case breaks down .",
    "the geometric phase is given by @xmath143 in contrast to zero for the case of one qubit .",
    "nevertheless , there is no contradiction , since in the discussed case of mixed states the dynamical phase does nt account for the total phase .",
    "it assumes the value of @xmath144 , so both add together to @xmath0 , as expected .",
    "it is also easy to verify that for an arbitrary value of @xmath37 , @xmath145 , while the proportions of geometrical and dynamical phases are determined by the angle @xmath37 . by looking now again at the case where the first qubit is traced away , for an evolution representing a rotation around one fixed axis in space ,",
    "all trajectories cross the border of the @xmath69 sphere , accounting for a global phase of @xmath0 .",
    "this is why we must observe @xmath145 .",
    "the discussion above generalizes the results of @xcite and gives a geometric interpretation of the nature of the cyclic phases for entangled two - qubit states with an arbitrary degree of entanglement .",
    "this is done with the help of geometric phases represented in the bloch ball for density matrices .",
    "as for the case of mes , the results presented can be , in principle , tested experimentally . to do so",
    ", one needs to throw the non mes in an interferometer , so that the global phase can become a relative phase . a possible way to do that is using photon interference , as proposed in @xcite .",
    "recently , other proposals have appeared aiming to show the same effects in a system of entangled spin pairs @xcite .",
    "both proposals need slight modifications in order to account for the phase effects described in this paper .",
    "this modification concerns only the initial state , that now can have an arbitrary degree of entanglement . taking the example of polarized twin photons",
    ", it has already been demonstrated that polarisation entangled photon pairs with an arbitrary degree of entanglement can be generated @xcite . as shown above ,",
    "the same set of transformations performed in mes lead to the two different types of trajectories also for non mes .",
    "this means that the same set of wave plates used in @xcite can be employed to test the predicted results .",
    "to conclude , the different types of phases appearing in a cyclic evolution of a pure bipartite entangled state were studied .",
    "this is done from a geometric point of view .",
    "it is shown that the interplay between topological , dynamical and geometrical phases always lead to a global phase of @xmath109 .",
    "the parity of @xmath146 , can have different origins , depending on how one choses to geometrically represent the pure entangled state : by considering evolution operators acting on one qubit only and tracing with respect to the fixed qubit , trajectories of the type plus and minus are a consequence of geometric and dynamical phases of the evolved qubit .",
    "alternatively , still supposing that only one qubit only evolves and tracing it out , the parity of the total phase is a consequence of the number of times an initial state , placed at the origin of @xmath69 , crosses the border of this sphere . as a consequence",
    ", it is shown that mixed states coming from the trace of a pure entangled state with respect to one of the particles may play a crucial role in describing the total phase gain of the pure entangled states itself .",
