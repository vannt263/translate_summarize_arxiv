    "westerlund ( 1961 ) discovered that the 41day cepheid rs pup was surrounded by a remarkable nebulosity .",
    "this is in the shape of rudimentary rings but with much distorted structure and condensations .",
    "havlen ( 1972 ) showed that portions of the nebulosity varied in the period of the cepheid but with with various phase lags .",
    "a very beautiful set of measurements of phase lags at various points in the nebula has recently been obtained by kervella et al .",
    "( 2008 ) (= kervella et al . ) .",
    "in general , the expected phase lag at a point @xmath1 may be written : @xmath2    here @xmath3 is the fractional phase lag , @xmath4 the whole number of pulsation periods elapsed , @xmath5 is the distance to rs pup in parsecs , @xmath6 is the angular distance of @xmath1 from the star in arcsec , @xmath7 is the pulsation period in days and @xmath8 is the angle between the line joining the star to @xmath1 and the plane of the sky ( positive if @xmath1 is further away than the star , negative if it is nearer ) .",
    "the measured quantities are @xmath3 and @xmath6 .",
    "@xmath7 is assumed known and here it is taken as 41.4389 days ( kervella et al . ) . in an attempt to determine @xmath5 , kervella et al .",
    "assume @xmath9 . that is they assume that all the features measured by them lie in the plane of the sky and the values of @xmath4",
    "are then chosen to obtain the best fit to this model .",
    "the justification for this assumption is that if the nebulosity consisted of a series of thin , uniform , spherical shells centred on the star , then the deviation of all measured points from the plane of the sky would be small .",
    "however an examination of the structure of the nebulosity ( for instance from the figures in kervella et al . )",
    "shows that it is far from corresponding to this idealized model .",
    "there is much distortion and density variation in the rudimentary rings .",
    "kervella et al .",
    "place special emphasis on the ten condensations or blobs shown in their fig 7 .",
    "the existence of such blobs is not consistent with the idealized model and leaves open the question of whether they or other features are actually in , or near , the plane of the sky . in view of these uncertainties",
    "it can not be claimed that a definitive distance to rs pup can be found based on the  in - the - plane \" assumption . in the next section",
    "this assumption is dropped and it is shown that a simple and astrophysically interesting model for the nebulosity is found if a distance for rs pup is adopted from a period - luminosity relation .",
    "van leeuwen et al . ( 2007 ) established a reddening - free period - luminosity relation in @xmath10 based on hst ( benedict et al .",
    "2007 ) and revised hipparcos parallaxes .",
    "this together with the data in table a1 of that paper leads to a predicted distance of 1728pc for rs pup.pc derived from the pulsational parallax by fouqu et al .",
    "( 2007 ) is not significantly different from this . ]",
    "adopting this distance it is possible to use eq . 1 to study the three dimensional structure of the nebulosity .",
    "in principle the values of @xmath4 can be arbitrarily assigned .",
    "however they should obviously be chosen to account for apparent continuities in the structure and to conform to some simple , physically reasonable model .",
    "it was quickly found by trial and error that there is a consistent set of values of @xmath4 in which the points measured by kervella et al .",
    "are further away than the star on the south side and nearer on the north , i.e. an inclined disc model is indicated .",
    "this is indeed the simplest model , if the uniform spherical shell model is rejected . in such a model the values of @xmath4 have to chosen such that @xmath11 values are as near constant as possible in a given direction from the star and vary smoothly with direction . the details are given in table 1 .",
    "this contains data on the 31 points observed by kervella et al .",

    "the line shown is a least squares fit through the origin and is given by : @xmath23 the tilt of the disc to the plane of the sky is @xmath24 .",
    "the rms scatter about the line in @xmath16 is only @xmath25pc , much smaller than the diameter of the disc , which is @xmath26pc out to the limits of the phase - lag survey .",
    "this rms scatter may be compared to the rms scatter of @xmath14 which is @xmath27pc .",
    "no attempt has been made to optimize the disc model by , for instance , varying @xmath21 to find a better fit .",
    "this might reduce the rms scatter slightly .",
    "however this is already small compared to the diameter of the part of the disc surveyed indicating a relatively thin disc .",
    "a realistic disc will have some significant depth perpendicular to its axis and , indeed , kervella et al .",
    "note that their observations at some positions suggest smoothing attributed to a non - zero depth in the line of sight .",
    "an inclined disc model broadly similar the one just discussed could probably be derived for other distances , if there were good evidence for these .",
    "however it should be noted that to take the distance as a free parameter in an attempt to reduce the rms scatter in the model is to assume that the disc must conform as closely as possible to an idealized model which is perfectly flat and of negligible thickness .",

    "whilst it has seemed possible , for instance , that cepheids might have ejected shells in a previous evolutionary phase , it has been puzzling that only for rs pup is such a prominent structure found .",
    "the interpretation of the nebulosity as a disc at a small angle to the plane of the sky opens up the possibility of a deeper understanding of this phenomenon and its rarity .",
    "obvious possibilities are loss of mass in the equatorial plane by unusually rapid rotation and/or binary interaction at an earlier evolutionary stage .",
    "the structure seen in the rs pup nebulosity makes questionable the assumption that phase - lag observations all refer to points close to the plane of the sky and this makes distance estimates based on this assumption questionable .",
    "an inclined disc model at a distance predicted by a period - luminosity relation gives a good fit to the data and opens new possibilities for understanding the system , including a possible interacting binary model .",
