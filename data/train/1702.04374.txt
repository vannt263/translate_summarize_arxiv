    "the phenomenon of leidenfrost drops was first reported in the 18^th^ century @xcite , where it was noted that liquid drops do not touch solid surfaces that are significantly hotter than the liquid s boiling point .",
    "leidenfrost drops are also seen to last significantly longer than expected , explained by an evaporative flow from the liquid lifting the drop off the plate and creating a gap between the liquid and the solid , filled with vapour .",
    "the long lifetime of the liquid drop is due to the layer of gas having a lower heat conductivity than the liquid @xcite , so acting as a thermal insulator and protecting the liquid from the hot plate s effects .",
    "although leidenfrost drops have been discussed for centuries , many studies have been limited to results using high - speed photography , _ e.g _",
    "@xcite , or applications of the lubrication approximation  @xcite .",
    "meanwhile , recently proposed applications include small - scale pumps using waste heat @xcite , and since the liquid phase lasts much longer ( and is much more mobile ) while it floats on a layer of gas @xcite , a ratchet - like substrate has been used to successfully move drops in desired directions ( or even ` up - hill ' ) @xcite .",
    "this recently discovered method of self propulsion could find extensive applications in microfluids , and has attracted significant attention in literature @xcite .",
    "experiments involving leidenfrost drops are often trivial to perform , since the drops evaporate slowly and are mobile whilst easy to control .",
    "a common assumption is that the drops floating on a layer of vapour are in a non - wetting situation , with an effective contact angle of @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "this results in the ` outer ' solution for a levitating drop being comparable to that of a non - wetting sessile drop on a super - hydrophobic surface @xcite .",
    "meanwhile , non - wetting drops display an interesting property whereby they can remove themselves from a substrate at the point of coalescence @xcite .",
    "this occurs spontaneously without any external force , due to a release of surface energy . assuming two approximately spherical drops of equal radius on a super - hydrophobic surface , and that the change in surface energy is entirely converted to kinetic energy directed away from the substrate , the theoretical vertical `",
    "take - off ' velocity at coalescence has been predicted to scale as @xmath1 , where @xmath2 , @xmath3 , and @xmath4 represent surface tension , density , and radius of the drop respectively .",
    "data from the coalescence of leidenfrost drops has been compared with the non - wetting theory , where a similar scaling trend for milimetric leidenfrost drops was found as for micrometric non - wetting drops @xcite .",
    "droplet coalescence has become of considerable interest @xcite , since coalescors are widely used in industry : for example in water purification , oil refinery , food processing , _",
    "etc_. in most applications , relying on gravity or other external forces to remove successively coalesced drops is undesired and so drop detachment via surface energy release has been proposed as an effective solution , combined with the hydrophobicity of a surface .",
    "one of the drawbacks of using flat ( or rough ) hydrophobic substrates is the liquid - solid contact area gives rise to a drop - substrate adhesion , making the drops stick to the surface .",
    "a recently proposed remedy is to use hydrophobic fibres @xcite , where the contact area is considerably smaller , and so too the adhesive effect .",
    "research on this topic has even extended into the nano - scale region where it has been shown that the mechanism of drop detachment should be similar , if not identical , since the liquid bridge formed at coalescence still makes contact with the solid substrate @xcite .",
    "leidenfrost drops have been used in coalescence experiments to replace non - wetting drops @xcite , and the results compared to the numerical studies of the non - wetting case @xcite .",
    "it has been reported that the vertical momentum changes are largely down to a surface energy release combined with the inability of the resulting larger drop to permeate ` into ' the substrate , extending previous work on non - wetting drop self detachment @xcite ; and this mechanism is thought to be the same for the leidenfrost case .",
    "interestingly , despite the comparisons , the coalescence of leidenfrost drops has not been thoroughly studied .",
    "it has been reported that leidenfrost drops display a very strong short - range repulsion , which can prevent coalescence @xcite  remarkably even allowing drops to bounce off one another .",
    "this would signify a considerable difference to the non - wetting drops , and question the validity of equating the two systems of drop coalescence . in the experiments performed by liu _",
    "et al _ , leidenfrost drops were made to coalesce by moving downhill towards each other , presumably acquiring sufficient momentum to overcome the short - range repulsion which was not reported @xcite .",
    "a comparison was then made with initially static non - wetting drops ; and only vertical momentum changes were focused on .",
    "it appears there have been few , if any , non - experimental studies of leidenfrost drop coalescence .    in light of the short - range repulsion observed @xcite , leidenfrost drop coalescence demands more detailed study .",
    "numerically simulating liquid drops levitating on a cushion of evaporated vapour is non - trivial because of the system s complex and multi - scale nature , which includes ( fast ) variations in temperature and several coupled dynamic processes . in this work",
    ", two - dimensional coalescing leidenfrost drops are numerically simulated using the recently developed dynamic van der waals theory ( dvdwt ) @xcite , presented to describe one - component liquid - vapour systems with an inhomogeneous temperature field and liquid - vapour phase transition . using a phase - field model",
    "means that the velocity , density , and temperature fields are governed by a single set of equations , rather than requiring any pre - specified conditions to be satisfied at the interface ( such a the rate of evaporation ) .",
    "the primary drawback of the phase - field method is the necessity that the interfacial region be resolved , requiring an extremely fine mesh .",
    "however , since the vapour layer under a leidenfrost drop is typically extremely thin , a detailed mesh is required anyway in order to resolve the dynamics under the drop .",
    "the dvdwt has become more attractive recently as computational ability has grown and become affordable , while it has notably been used to simulate leidenfrost drops in previous studies ; successfully resolving the dynamics in the vapour layer @xcite .",
    "it has also been employed to study other complex two - phase fluid problems , such as pool boiling @xcite , liquid spreading @xcite , droplet migration @xcite , _ etc_. simulating leidenfrost drop coalescence using the dvdwt will allow for some remarks to be made on the vapour layer dynamics as well as the mechanism by which leidenfrost drops rise ( and fall ) post - coalescence .",
    "attention will then be turned to the repulsion between drops and the conditions required in order that the drops overcome the reported short - range force opposing coalescence .    in order to consider the leidenfrost effect ,",
    "an appreciable vertical gravitational acceleration is required .",
    "this is different from the simulations of non - wetting drops done previously , where gravity is generally neglected since these drops are generally formed by condensation and typically extremely small . since previous comparisons of leidenfrost drops are often made with _ initially static _ non - wetting drops in close proximity , and the repulsion between leidenfrost drops is extremely short - range ; the focus will be the vapour layer dynamics of initially momentum - less leidenfrost drops coalescing through a horizontal applied acceleration .",
    "this will allow for a broad range of relative drop sizes to be considered , although a finely - tuned simulation set - up will also be necessitated .    in the following sections , the dvdwt is briefly reviewed along with a description of the numerical method used and the simulation set - up .",
    "the 2d results for coalescing leidenfrost drops are then presented ; the overall drop coalescence process is shown followed by the drop velocity profile , and the drop height , as the systems evolve .",
    "this is followed by a study of the vapour pressure influence on the coalescence and drop jumping process .",
    "a study of the coalescence - resisting properties is also performed in order to identify a scaling law for the repulsion .",
    "it is found that the repulsive force is sourced from the vapour pressure of a common `` pseudo cavity '' region , that exists before the drops begin to coalesce  in concurrence with intuition .",
    "finally , we conclude with some remarks and comments .",
    "this section begins by briefly reviewing the dvdwt @xcite : a diffuse interface model that does not need the liquid - vapour interfacial dynamics to be specified beyond the hydrodynamic equations in the bulk region @xcite .",
    "the resulting drawback is the high computational cost as the interfacial thickness ( @xmath5 for water ) becomes a length scale to be resolved .",
    "the numerical method used as well as a brief overview of the boundary conditions used ( a full account can be found in the references @xcite ) is then presented , before the details of the simulation set - up is discussed .      a homogeneous monotomic ( one - component ) fluid is characterised by the scale of attractive interaction energy @xmath6 and the molecular volume @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is a molecular length similar to molecular diameter .",

    "the system is slightly perturbed from the above description and gradient contributions from the density inhomogeneity are introduced . choosing the order parameter distinguishing between liquid and vapour to be the number density ,",
    "gradient contributions are introduced to the internal energy density and entropy density as follows : @xmath25 here @xmath26 and @xmath27 are positive such that the internal energy increases and the entropy decreases as a result of the inhomogeneity .",

    "it is of the order of magnitude of the liquid - vapour interfacial thickness far from the critical point , and is close to @xmath8 @xcite .    to derive the equilibrium conditions in the bulk region , the entropy in the bulk @xmath31 is maximised for fixed particle number @xmath32 and fixed internal energy @xmath33",

    "computational limitations need to be considered when choosing the body force felt by the levitating drops , set through @xmath116 .",
    "there are five important considerations : ( i ) the magnitude of the gravitational acceleration , @xmath117 in eqn  [ grvlc ] , must remain nonphysically large in order for it to have an appreciable effect on the very small drops simulated here  @xcite .",
    "( ii ) the vertical acceleration , relative to the area of liquid , should ensure that the drops are of a similar nature to those simulated and experimented with previously  that is , quasi - spherical .",
    "( iii ) the magnitude of the horizontal component should not push the drops together too quickly , in order that the drops coalesce long after the initial stages of drop levitation are complete and any initial transient stage has elapsed  @xcite .",
    "( iv ) the time taken for the drops to meet can neither be too long , for computational resources are limited .",
    "( v ) the drops should meet with sufficiently little momentum that the short - range repulsive force can be observed : they should be almost momentum - free immediately prior to coalescence .    in order to study different effective drop sizes ,",
    "the capillary length is varied through changing the parameter @xmath117 in eqn .",
    "[ grvlc ] .",
    "since the force is no longer normal to the substrate , this also alters the ` force of attraction ' between the two drops .",
    "however , this can be easily taken into account , while maintaining an otherwise identical set - up for simplicity .",
    "it is pointed out that the symmetric nature of @xmath111 may result in a small deformation of the larger drop post - coalescence , although this is not expected to be significant and is anticipated to have little influence on the core properties of interest .",
    "in this section , the main results from the two - dimensional dvdwt simulations for coalescing leidenfrost drops are presented .",
    "initially , an overview of the timeline for the simulated system is presented , with a brief consideration of the typical drop and vapour layer dynamics immediately before drop coalescence occurs .",
    "the mass - averaged liquid drop velocities are then studied for a variety of cases , before the vapour - layer interactions between the two drops are considered and a scaling law proposed for the repulsive force .      in figure  [ evol - lc ] ,",
    "the coalescence of two leidenfrost drops is shown for the case of @xmath118 , at time intervals of @xmath119 .",
    "both the density distribution ( in colour ) and the velocity field ( white arrows ) are shown .",
    "the first frame is captured @xmath120 after the initial conditions are generated and gravity is turned on , and the substrate temperature increased . only the central region @xmath121 , @xmath122 is shown to focus on the drop - drop interactions . in the top - left panel note the non - circular shape of the drops .",
    "the drop deformation actually becomes stronger as the drops get closer together  some of the evaporative vapour from the drop undersides flows through the gap between the drops in a vertical direction causing a viscous shear to the liquid , resulting in the deformation seen pre - coalescence .",
    "note that the low viscosity ratio ( in these simulations @xmath69 ) exaggerates this effect ; and that a non negligible flow can be seen inside the liquid drops pre - coalescence .",
    "left , second from top , the initial stages of liquid bridge formation are seen , at the point of coalescence .",
    "right , second from top , the bridge is seen to have anti - symmetrically expanded : the vapour layer pressure appears to resist the downward liquid movement as the bridge thickens .",
    "the velocity of the fluid is shown in both the horizontal ( left ) and vertical ( right ) directions in figure  [ fluid - v ] , at time @xmath123 showing the approximately steady - state maintained until coalescence .",
    "the density contour at @xmath124 is also shown in white .",
    "it is clear that the vapour layer dynamics are altered substantially from the case of a single leidenfrost drop previously studied  @xcite ; here the symmetry of the vapour layer under an individual drop ( particularly the @xmath125-component of velocity ) is broken .",
    "it is seen that there is a strong vapour flow leaving the _ combined _ cavity region at either side , but a much smaller contribution towards the central area between drops .",
    "this is explained by the interaction of the two vapour layers  there is a build up of vapour in the combined cavity region , with only a small chimney between drops whereby there is an escape .",
    "this leads to an increased pressure in the entire central cavity region , which forces the vapour flow through the thin gap between drops as seen in the @xmath126 component of figure  [ fluid - v ] .",
    "physically , the leidenfrost effect is a vertical force balance between liquid weight and pressure sourced from an evaporative flow , necessitating a different set up to previous studies of coalescing drops  generally performed without any significant vertical body force @xcite .",
    "after the drops coalesce and the liquid rises up due to the change in total surface energy , the coalesced drop will immediately decelerate due to gravity and then return to the substrate , and is expected to bounce slightly on the vapour layer .",
    "the leidenfrost drop coalescence considered in this paper will therefore result in an overall rise in the average liquid distance from the substrate  that is , the gravitational potential of the liquid will be increased to a maximum before decreasing again .",
    "since the leidenfrost drops are always detached from the substrate , the term ` jump ' in this context refers to any initial rise in liquid that is later eventually reversed by gravity .",
    "+    the 2d mass - averaged drop velocities , @xmath127 and @xmath128 , are now considered . here",
    ", the 2d mass - averaged equivalent of a scalar quantity @xmath129 is defined as @xmath130 : @xmath131 where @xmath132 is the number of particles in the 2d drop .",
    "the mass - averaged tangential and vertical velocities , @xmath127 and @xmath128 , are plotted for the left - hand drop , for a number of gravitational parameters , in figure  [ drop - v ] . as expected , the early stages of the simulation consist of the vapour layer forming , and the drop leaving the substrate , stabilising quickly in the vertical direction during the initial @xmath133 .",
    "meanwhile , the applied horizontal body force accelerates the drops towards each other .",
    "however , the drop - drop repulsion quickly retards them as they approach one another , and before coalescence they are almost stationary ( both @xmath127 and @xmath128 are close to zero ) .",
    "this is a requirement imposed on the choice of @xmath111 since residual momentum would make studying any very short - range forces potentially challenging .",
    "coalescence occurs at a later time after varying amounts of evaporation have taken place , resulting in a sharp increase in both @xmath127 and @xmath128 .",
    "viscous dissipation is fast in the simulations so there is little oscillation and strong damping . upon coalescence",
    "the new larger liquid mass quickly changes shape , beginning to take the form of a large leidenfrost drop as seen in figure  [ evol - lc ] , _",
    "i.e _ a cavity space under the coalesced drop is formed .",
    "as the coalescence process evolves , a more circular shape is seen in figure  [ evol - lc ] as the surface energy is minimised .",
    "finally , after falling due to gravity , a quasi - circular shape is achieved and the underside is deformed , as expected for leidenfrost drops , with the gap between substrate and liquid similar to that pre - coalescence .",
    "the changes in drop shape can be easily matched to the changes in average drop velocity , for example the rise and fall in @xmath128 here is a quantification of the change in vertical speed of the liquid seen in figure  [ evol - lc ] .    in figure  [ dropz - lc ]",
    "the mass - averaged drop height , @xmath134 , is plotted as a function of time through the coalescence process for several choices of @xmath117 .",
    "since the initial increase in @xmath134 is later partially reversed ( due to gravity forcing the liquid back toward to substrate , although @xmath134 remains above its initial level since larger leidenfrost drops have higher centres of mass ) , it is confirmed that leidenfrost drops still experience a ` jump ' resulting from coalescence as in the non - wetting case .",
    "after the initial ` jump ' , gravity along with the vapour layer pressure and viscous damping act together to stabilise the drop height . note that decreasing values of @xmath117 lead to an increasing maximum value seen for @xmath134 .",
    "this is primarily due to the lower vertical gravitational acceleration , and is consistent with a release of surface energy causing the increase in @xmath134 , as with the cases of non - wetting drops .      here",
    ", the vapour layer pressure prevents the liquid phase from lowering and touching the substrate  contrasting with the `` liquid bridge impacting substrate '' mechanism underlying the jump of coalescing non - wetting drops @xcite . for leidenfrost drops ,",
    "the vapour layer pressure is expected to contribute to the system dynamics in two ways : ( i ) from figure  [ fluid - v ] , it is predicted the short - range repulsion of leidenfrost drops is controlled by the vapour pressure which also leads to the vapour flow through the gap between drops .",
    "( ii ) as the bridge is formed it moves closer to the substrate , as seen in figure  [ evol - lc ] , and hence the shape of the coalesced drop will remain coupled with the pressure similar to the case of a single leidenfrost drop .",
    "it is expected the maximum size of a coalesced drop ( before a chimney - like instability splits the liquid phase ) will be below that of a single steady leidenfrost drop ; since the vapour pressure is temporarily above the steady - state value during coalescence .",
    "figure  [ p - diffs ] shows the evolution of the pressure difference @xmath135 ( the positions of which are shown in figure  [ lcschem ] ) .",
    "note that @xmath136 is measured at @xmath115  which is only under the liquid phase _ after _ coalescence has begun . before coalescence , while the drops are almost stationary , it can be seen the pressure in the combined cavity is almost constant , and significantly different to the ambient pressure , @xmath137 .",
    "the pressure under the merging drops is then seen to change substantially during coalescence . as the drops merge and the liquid bridge expands , the space under the now - single liquid mass shrinks rapidly , immediately causing a sharp initial increase in vapour pressure at @xmath136 .",
    "subsequently , the vapour layer pressure is seen to oscillate before reaching a final steady value under the drop .",
    "the oscillations are coupled with the liquid ` bouncing ' on the vapour layer as seen in figure  [ dropz - lc ] .",
    "after the final stages of the drop coalescence ( once a new nearly - steady state is reached ) , the pressure profile in the vapour layer is as a single , larger , leidenfrost drop : it peaks around the centre of the vapour layer , at @xmath138 .",
    "the overall ( vertical ) momentum changes of the liquid drop can not be attributed to the pressure changes in the vapour layer : the liquid momentum changes are found to be much more substantial than the pressure - sourced force .",
    "this infers that the vapour layer does not play a significant role in the liquid ` jump ' during coalescence besides preventing liquid - solid contact as the bridge expands . however , the feedback mechanism where evaporation gets stronger as the interface ( rather than @xmath134 ) approaches the substrate still exists and does contribute to maintaining the levitating nature of the drop , deforming it s underside in an active manner different to the non - wetting case .",
    "it is deduced that while the vapour layer pressure changes in order to prevent liquid - solid contact , the overall momentum changes are caused by the minimisation of surface energy .",
    "the mechanism behind the _ jump _ in liquid mass is therefore similar to that of non - wetting drops , since the vapour pressure does not contribute significantly to the total liquid acceleration .",
    "this confirms the theory proposed in the literature @xcite : leidenfrost drops are propelled upwards upon coalescence by the same mechanism ( and scaling laws ) as non - wetting drops , _",
    "i.e _ a release of surface energy . now turning to the short - range repulsion between drops ; it is found that there is insignificant opposing evaporation in the thin gap between drops  contradicting the mechanism previously suggested  @xcite .",
    "therefore , the repulsion is taken to be due to the build up of vapour in the combined space beneath both drops .",
    "this was established in the pressure - driven vapour flow through the gap between drops , seen in figure  [ fluid - v ]  ( right ) . moreover , prior to coalescence the pressure in the common space between drops , @xmath136 , is seen to remain almost constant in figure  [ p - diffs ] ( _ e.g _ the green curve ) , despite the drops continually shrinking due to evaporation .",
    "this pressure is expected to act on an increasingly small length of interface as the drops get smaller , reducing the force opposing coalescence until it becomes insufficient to overcome the applied horizontal body force , which changes at a much slower rate .    in pomeau s application of the lubrication approximation ,",
    "the scaling law for the pressure in the vapour layer under a vanilla leidenfrost drop is found to be @xmath139  @xcite .",
    "the pressure difference between each side of a 2d drop in close proximity with another is expected to adhere to a similar dependence , since the gap between drops is very small .",
    "using the expression for @xmath140 : @xmath141 which represents the drop radius magnitude at which the lubrication approximation breaks down  @xcite , the vapour pressure contribution from the drops to the combined cavity region is proposed to scale as @xmath142 : @xmath143 meanwhile , the force pushing a single drop toward the other is denoted @xmath144 , where @xmath145 is the ( 2d equivalent ) mass of the drop and @xmath146 the ( horizontal , vertical ) acceleration applied .",
    "therefore , the first time when the following forces become of equal magnitude ( as @xmath147 decreases through evaporation ) represents the maximum radius for the net force to act inwards ; @xmath148 where @xmath149 is the force due to the vapour pressure in the combined cavity beneath two drops , acting outwards on the inside quarter of the drops interface .",
    "it has also been assumed that the drops are small enough they can be characterised by their equivalent radius where @xmath150 , which is reasonable in the simulations presented here .",
    "notice that since only two - dimensional simulations are performed , that do not display axis symmetry , it is two - dimensional `` equivalent forces '' that are being compared ; _",

    "this will impact the relative strength of the repulsive force , making it much more significant in 2d than it may be in 3d .    for initially momentum - less drops to begin to join , the tangential forces @xmath151 & @xmath149",
    "must be balanced , meaning @xmath147 and @xmath152 should satisfy : @xmath153 or in terms of @xmath140 ; @xmath154 since @xmath155 is typically very small , the repulsive force can be considered very strong ; most leidenfrost experiments are performed for @xmath156 .    in the numerical simulations ,",

    "( ii ) the ratio between tangential and horizontal gravity becomes a very sensitive factor for larger values of @xmath173 .",
    "notice that for very small drops , towards the left - hand side of figure  [ vapour - body ] , there is a noticeable deviation from the linear fit .",

    ", a constant offset has been included in plotting the fitted green line , despite eqn .",
    "[ abfbal ] predicting a zero intercept .",
    "since the simulations here represent very small drops ( with a very small viscosity ratio ) , the effects of viscous resistance may not be negligible .",
    "as the drops evaporate the drop radius will recede , making the gap between drops wider ( in the absence of any competing body forces ) .",
    "since the rate of the radius change becomes larger as the drops become smaller , the linear fit taking only vapour pressure and body forces into account can not be made to pass through the origin ; the smallest drops will need to overcome an increasingly significant viscous drag originating from moving at the speed of the receding interface ,  @xmath176 , in order that the gap between drops does not widen .    by considering a stokes - like drag force in the horizontal @xmath64-direction , an estimate on the size of drops for",

    ", the drops must move horizontally at a speed greater than that of the receding radius .",
    "the effective viscous ` force ' acting on a 2d circular solid disk is therefore taken to linearly depend on @xmath177 @xcite .",

    "the dynamic van der waals theory has been used to simulate two - dimensional liquid - vapour systems containing a pair of leidenfrost drops under the influence of a directed body force .",
    "it was found that upon coalescence , the small drops do not touch the substrate and remain supported by the vapour layer pressure . the previous prediction that the change in vertical momentum for leidenfrost drops is similar to that of non - wetting drops ( _ i.e _ a release of surface energy )",
    "was confirmed , and the mechanism whereby the coalesced drop rises up was found to be due to factors beyond the vapour pressure , which peaks during the coalescence process .",
    "the results confirmed experimental observations that leidenfrost drops experience a remarkably strong short - range repulsion .",
    "it was seen that the force resisting coalescence scales the same way as the pressure in the vapour layer under a single drop , with good agreement for the two - dimensional numerical cases . where the body force pushing the two liquid drops together is small enough",
    ", they initially do not coalesce . instead they come to rest in close proximity , evaporating until they become sufficiently small that the length of interface exposed to the vapour layer ( and therefore vapour pressure ) results in an insufficient force to continue to dominate the applied horizontal acceleration . in the simulations",
    "performed , there was a low viscosity ratio and a very small length scale used , resulting in viscous effects becoming apparent for the smallest drops .",
    "an approximation for the force balance including viscous effects showed that viscous drag only becomes significant for extremely small drops ( of the order of @xmath180 ) , and is unlikely to influence the drop joining process in macroscopic experiments .",
    "although the simulation results are insightful , they are only applicable to cases where the drops are initially stationary and in a semi - steady state awaiting coalescence . in the simulated systems this results from the initial drops being too large to coalesce , so they approach one another , where the repulsion allows them to remain close until they have evaporated to become small enough to join .",
    "immediately pre - coalescence , there is negligible overall drop momentum . in previous leidenfrost coalescence",
    "experimental studies , the drops are not momentum - less @xcite . they are generally rolled towards each other ; meeting with enough momentum to easily overcome the repulsive force .",
    "the length scale on which the repulsive force becomes significant has not been studied here , however this is a crucial future work to consider since it would allow for an estimate to be made for the momentum required in order to allow coalescence .",
    "in addition , fluctuations in substrate topology , drop shape , or contaminants in the fluid ( which all exist in experiments ) are not modelled here .",
    "these small perturbations may result in significant changes in the interface profile and local momentum changes could then trigger the initial stages of coalescence .",
    "crucially , the simulations presented here consider only two - dimensional drops and it is not possible to extend the results to higher dimensionality .",
    "this is significant since in three dimensions , although the pressure in the vapour layer is expected to scale similarly , the the curvature of the drop interface will result in the gap between drops varying with both @xmath183 as well as @xmath67 . as a result ,",
    "the 2d scaling law for the force balance can not be translated into higher dimensional space .",
    "full three - dimensional simulations are needed in order to develop this work further , however the mechanism behind leidenfrost drop repulsion and leidenfrost jumping upon coalescence are expected to be the same .",
