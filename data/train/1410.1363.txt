    "type ia supernovae ( sne  ia ) rank among the sharpest tools to measure the expansion history of the universe .",
    "however , the ultimate limiting factor in their use for precision cosmology rests on our ability to control systematic uncertainties of astrophysical nature , most notably due to extinction and a possible brightness evolution over cosmic time ( see * ? ? ? * for a recent review ) . due to its remarkably close distance ,",
    "sn2014jin m  82 ( @xmath3 mpc ) presents us with unique opportunities to study the environment and reddening of an otherwise normal sn  ia@xcite , and even the impact of the intervening dust on the polarization signal @xcite . moreover , its proximity allowed for the first time the direct detection of gamma - rays from the @xmath4ni decay sequence @xcite that power the optical display of sne  ia .",
    "contrary to expectations from most theoretical models , the detection of characteristic lines of the @xmath4ni decay arising 20 days past explosion seems to indicate the presence of radioactive material close to the surface of the sn ejecta @xcite .",
    "prior to this event , sn2011fein m  101 ( @xmath5 mpc ) was the best studied sn  ia . in particular ,",
    "@xcite and @xcite performed studies of the early lightcurve to conclude that the explosion originated from a compact object , @xmath6 , i.e. , the size of a white dwarf ( wd ) , as expected from models where sne  iaresult from a thermonuclear explosion in a c / o wd @xcite .",
    "the validity of the tight limit has been questioned by @xcite , who suggested there could be a  dark phase \" of up to a few days between the explosion and the rise of the radioactively powered lightcurve . due to the lack of well - sampled deep observations prior to discovery ,",
    "a possible early burst of light can not be safely ruled out .",
    "further discussions on the early rise of sne  iahave been provided by @xcite and @xcite . from a spectroscopic analysis of sn2011fe@xcite derived a dark phase of @xmath7 day , resulting in a limit of @xmath8 for the progenitor size .    for sn2014j ,",
    "@xcite reported january 14.75 ut ( @xmath9 day ) as the best estimate of the explosion date , based on observations from the katzman automatic imaging telescope ( kait ) at lick observatory and amateur data from k.  itagaki .",
    "they also conclude that a fire - ball model @xcite , where the luminosity is assumed to scale with the area of the expanding photosphere at constant temperature and expansion velocity , @xmath10 , does not provide a good description to the kait data of sn2014jand used instead a broken power - law expression to derive the time of first light .",
    "similarly , @xcite showed that the early data of sn2014jfrom the intermediate palomar transient factory ( iptf ) obtained with the 48-inch telescope ( p48 ) in two narrow - band h@xmath11 filters deviate from the simple @xmath12 law .    in this work ,",
    "we investigate the possibility that the deviations from a simple @xmath12 rise seen in the lightcurves of sn2014joriginate from an extra source of luminosity from either shock - heating of the ejecta , interaction with circumstellar matter or a companion star ; or from radioactive material in the outer parts of the exploding star .",
    "for this purpose , we use the early iptf narrow - band data from @xcite and the high - cadence observations from the kilodegree extremely little telescope ( kelt ) from @xcite",
    "the effective filter pass - bands ( i.e. , including the telescope optics , ccd sensitivity and atmospheric throughput ) used for the early observations of sn2014jfrom iptf @xcite and kelt @xcite are shown in fig .",

    "thus , the first set of iptf imaging observations were conducted with h@xmath0 filters centred at @xmath13  and @xmath14  , respectively . also shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : filter ] is the full ( currently ) available kelt lightcurve , starting about two months prior to explosion and reaching to about day + 140 after lightcurve maximum .",
    "kelt is primarily an exoplanet transit survey @xcite , using a small aperture telescope ( @xmath15 mm ) with a very wide fov , @xmath16 and a broad transmission function , @xmath17 , cutting around @xmath18  on the blue side and reaching into the near - ir , @xmath19 m .",
    "the effective wavelength of the kelt pass - band ( filter plus ccd response ) is @xmath20 nm .",
    "kelt has a very coarse pixel scale , @xmath21 , which makes accurate snphotometry challenging @xcite .",
    "the kelt - north telescope obtained a total of 1869 individual exposures of sn2014jthat meet the quality control cuts .",
    "these exposures span 249 nights starting on 08 october 2013 and ending on 14 june 2014 .    because the kelt - north telescope uses a german equatorial mount , observations taken before and after the local median crossing involve a 180-degree flip of the fov , which we designate west and east exposures . in order to avoid systematics in the flux scale between the west and east exposures ,",
    "we restrict our analysis below to the west exposures .",
    "therefore the final kelt lightcurve includes 889 individual exposures spanning 10 november 2013 to 14 june 2014 ( julian dates 2456607.03 to 2456822.69 ) .",
    "east and west are defined according to the sky position of the target , not by the orientation of the mount . in other words ,",
    "the east exposures are acquired earlier in the night .",
    "there is in general an offset ( and a scaling ) difference between the east and west photometry .",
    "consequently , the east and west data are reduced independently and have a different flux scale .",
    "we found empirically that the west data have a better behaved psf and smaller sky contamination , and therefore have overall better precision .",
    "here we have opted to work with just the west orientation because of the better precision but most importantly to avoid systematics that could not be removed if attempting to also include the east data .    on nights with good weather where at least one measurement was obtained ,",
    "the number of measurements per night varies from 1 to 20 .",
    "note that the kelt observing procedure employs a moon avoidance strategy , which leads to increased cadence on fields that are more than 60 degrees away from the moon .",
    "fortuitously , this moon avoidance led to increased cadence on the m82 field around the time of the explosion of sn2014j .",
    "flux measurements from the individual kelt - north frames are extracted using the difference - imaging aperture photometry pipeline described in @xcite , which is a modified version of the standard kelt pipeline ( see * ? ? ?",
    "briefly , the standard kelt pipeline was modified to deal with the non - optimal placement of m82 near a corner of the kelt fov , leading to poor extraction with the standard pipeline . instead , in the modified pipeline ,",
    "the photometry extraction was manually forced to a custom cutout region centered on m82 .",
    "each photometric measurement is a differential measurement relative to a template image by means of image subtraction .",
    "the template image is the median of 130 images obtained during the month prior to the explosion .",
    "typically , kelt achieves a photometric precision of 1% or better on point sources brighter than @xmath22 . in the case of sn2014j ,",
    "the kelt lightcurve achieved a photometric precision of 1.5% on average at peak brightness , and 3% on average at half peak brightness .",
    "photometry of the iptf images was carried out with the method used in .",
    "psf photometry of the snfluxes of all epochs together with the background host - galaxy light was fitted simultaneously .",
    "the degeneracy between the host and the sn was broken by fixing the sn flux to zero for all epochs obtained in 2013 .",
    "lightcurves were also built of 240 stars in the fields , which were used for calibration as well as for deriving systematic uncertainties between the epochs .",
    "the former was carried out by matching the field star photometry to sdss dr10 @xmath23 and @xmath24 magnitudes . the uncertainty for individual epochs",
    "was found to be @xmath25mag and the uncertainty of the calibration is good to @xmath26mag .",
    "the photometry for the early rise used in this analysis is summarized in table  [ tab : data ] .",
    "observationally , the early lightcurve shapes for sne  iafollow , to a good approximation , a power - law behaviour . for sn2011fe ,",
    "hitherto the object with the best - covered early - time lightcurve , @xcite found @xmath27 , with @xmath28 .",
    "studies of stacked lightcurves of a nearby sn  iasample from the loss survey @xcite , typically not quite as sensitive to the very early phases , @xmath29 day , found @xmath30 .",
    "similarly , a lightcurve analysis of sdss - ii supernovae at cosmological distances by @xcite found @xmath31 , compatible with a similar study of snls sne  ia , @xmath32 , @xcite .",
    "recently , @xcite studied a sample of 18 sne  iafrom the palomar transient factory ( ptf ) and the la silla - quest variability survey ( lsq ) and found a mean value of @xmath33 .",
    "@xcite and @xcite have shown that such a power - law behaviour can in principle result from radioactive heating of the supernova ejecta .",
    "however , the exact shape of the rise will depend on the particular gradients in velocity , density and chemical composition within the ejecta @xcite .",
    "in particular , estimating the sn explosion epoch by fitting a power law to the early - time lightcurve might be misleading @xcite .",
    "explosion models that can explain the observed properties of normal sne  ia like delayed detonations in chandrasekhar - mass wds ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) or violent wd - wd mergers @xcite , predict that most @xmath4ni should be buried in the central part of the ejecta and not reach to the outermost layers . as a consequence",
    ", it will take some time for the radioactive energy to diffuse to the surface of the snejecta and a dark phase might occur between the onset of explosion and the time of first light @xcite .      while the sn shock wave propagates through the progenitor star , it deposits energy all over the ejecta .",
    "due to efficient adiabatic cooling this shock deposited energy becomes negligible ( with respect to radioactive heating ) at @xmath34 1 day after explosion for a wd progenitor .",
    "at very early times , however , radiative diffusion from shock - heated outer layers of the sn ejecta may contribute to the emergent luminosity . in the past",
    ", several groups have investigated the cooling of shock heated sn ejecta with analytical frameworks , e.g. @xcite .",
    "assuming spherically symmetric , radiation dominated , homologously expanding snejecta with constant opacity , the different approaches vary in their treatment of radiative diffusion and opacity and their assumption of the initial density and pressure profiles .",
    "however , recent work has shown that the different approaches agree within a factor of @xmath342 @xcite .    here , we follow the approach in @xcite and @xcite who use the model of @xcite to calculate the early - time luminosity ( @xmath35 ) and temperature ( @xmath36 ) from shock heated ejecta : @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the progenitor radius in units of @xmath39 cm , @xmath40 the explosion energy in units of @xmath41 erg , @xmath42 the progenitor mass in units of the chandrasekhar mass ( @xmath43 ) , @xmath44 the opacity in units of @xmath45 @xmath46g@xmath47 , @xmath48 a form factor that depends on the density profile of the progenitor star and @xmath49 the time since explosion in days . in the following we adopt @xmath50 , @xmath51 , @xmath52 and @xmath53 .",
    "similar to the situation discussed in the previous section , the sn shock wave will heat the surface layers of a surviving companion star , if present .",
    "this shock deposited energy may then contribute to the early - time luminosity of the sn .",
    "this scenario was investigated by @xcite . from a multi - dimensional radiative transfer simulation",
    ", kasen showed that the emerging flux is strongly angle dependent .",
    "for favourable viewing angles , i.e. those lying within the hole that is carved out of the sn ejecta by interaction between the ejecta and the companion star , shock heating of the companion star leads to a significant flux excess at early times compared to pure radioactive heating .",
    "hydrodynamical simulations of interactions between the snejecta and the companion star show that the half opening angle of such ejecta holes is @xmath54 degrees .",
    "in contrast , from the opposite direction the optically thick ejecta are obscuring the companion and no effect of the shock heating is present , as shown in fig .  2 of @xcite .",
    "@xcite provides an analytic fit formula for the evolution of the early - time bolometric luminosity and temperature , @xmath55 and @xmath56 : @xmath57 here , @xmath58 is the separation distance between the snprogenitor and its companion in units of @xmath59 cm , @xmath42 the progenitor mass in units of the chandrasekhar mass , @xmath60 the expansion velocity of the sn ejecta in units of @xmath61 cms@xmath47 , @xmath62 the electron scattering opacity in units of @xmath45 @xmath63g@xmath47 and @xmath49 the time since explosion in days . in the following we adopt @xmath51 , @xmath64 and @xmath65 . assuming that the companion fills its roche lobe , its radius can be constrained to be @xmath66 .",
    "@xcite pointed out that the early broad - band lightcurve of sn2014jdoes not follow a unique power law .",
    "instead a broken power - law expression was used to fit the data for the purpose of deriving the explosion date . apart from sn2014j ,",
    "there is today only one other sn known that shows such a behaviour ( sn  2013dy , * ? ? ?",
    "for the bulk of observed sne  iathe lightcurve rise is in good agreement with a single power law @xcite .    in what follows , we will try to reconcile the deviant behaviour of sn2014jas being a combination of ( at least ) two effects : radioactive heating from the inner ejecta and some extra component , e.g. from shock - heating of the ejecta or a companion ; or surface radioactivity , described in section [ shallow ] .      given the empirical evidence for a power - law behaviour for the radioactive early lightcurve of a large body of sne  ia",
    ", we assume that the snflux through a system transmission function @xmath17 ( see fig .

    "it should be noted that the adopted phenomenological description in eq .",
    "( [ eq : twocomp ] ) can not be exact since , at any given time , the two contributions will not be completely independent .",
    "e.g. , the same parts of the ejecta may contribute due to shock heating and radioactive heating .",
    "however , in the limit of @xmath73 the shock heating will dominate , while for @xmath74 radioactive heating is the main source of energy for the optical lightcurves .",
    "similarly , the fitted power - law component could absorb some of the contributions of the extra source of power .",

    "instead , we find that the required size scale of the heated material , either in the ejecta or a companion , is about a solar radius or larger . as the possibility of having a single degenerate model with a large companion has been ruled out by e.g. , searches in pre - explosion hst images @xcite ; non - detections at x - ray @xcite and radio wavelengths @xcite , other explanations to our findings are needed .",
    "following @xcite , wd mergers could be one possibility . if ignited on a viscous timescale rather than a dynamical time scale , an extended csm will form around the primary wd .",
    "shock heating of this material could be consistent with the observed early lightcurve of sn2014j .",
    "another possibility indicated by the shallow lightcurve rise could be that surface radioactivity contributes to the early lightcurve evolution .",
    "this was also invoked to explain the early gamma - ray signal from @xmath4ni decay observed in sn2014jby @xcite , albeit in larger quantities than was derived from our analysis of the optical lightcurve rise .",
    "based on the available data , although with exquisite time sampling early on , the degeneracies between the various explanations can not be resolved , due to insufficient signal - to - noise and color information .",
    "the model degeneracy translates into a systematic uncertainty of @xmath2 days on the estimate of the first light from sn2014j .",
    "we note that new well - sampled lightcurves are to be expected soon from the ongoing kepler extragalactic survey .",
    "as these will be carried on in an orchestrated fashion with surveys like iptf and kait , we can expect future discoveries to have a richer spectroscopic and imaging coverage early on , e.g. , in the uv from swift and hst .",
