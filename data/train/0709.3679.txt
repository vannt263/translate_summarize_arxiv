    "the hubble - sandage diagram for type ia supernovae ( hereafter sneia ) , as measured by the supernova cosmology project@xcite and the high - z supernova search team@xcite , provided the first evidence that the present universe is undergoing a phase of accelerating expansion driven by an exotic component with negative pressure ( in addition to the cold dark matter ) , usually called dark energy .",
    "the idea of a dark energy - dominated universe is a direct consequence of a convergence of independent observational results , and constitutes one of the greatest challenges for our current understanding of fundamental physics@xcite . among a number of possibilities to describe this dark energy component , the simplest and most theoretically appealing way is by means of a cosmological constant @xmath2 , which acts on the einstein field equations as an isotropic and homogeneous source with a constant equation of state , @xmath13 .",
    "although cosmological scenarios with a @xmath2 term might explain most of the current astronomical observations , from the theoretical viewpoint they are plagued with at least a fundamental problem , namely , it is really difficult to reconcile the small value of the vacuum energy density required by observations ( @xmath14 ) with estimates from quantum field theories ranging from 50 - 120 orders of magnitude larger@xcite .",
    "this problem sometimes called the cosmological constant problem ( pcc ) has inspired many authors to propose decaying @xmath2 models@xcite and other alternative approaches for describing dark energy@xcite .",
    "nevertheless , the present cosmic concordance model ( ccm ) which is supported by all the existing observations is a flat @xmath2cdm cosmology with a matter fraction of @xmath15 and a vacuum energy contribution of @xmath16@xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the real universe is not perfectly homogeneous , with light beams experiencing mass inhomogeneities along their way thereby producing many observable phenomena .",
    "for instance , light lines traversing in the universe are attracted and refracted by the gravitational force of the galaxies on their path , which bring us the signal of lensing , one of which is the multiple images of a single far galaxy@xcite .",
    "nowadays , gravitationally lensed quasars and radio sources offer important probes of cosmology and the structure of galaxies . the optical depth for lensing depends on the cosmological volume element out to moderately high redshift . in this way",
    ", lens statistics can in principle provide valuable constraints on the cosmological constant or , more generally , on the dark energy density and its equation of state @xcite .    in this context , one of the most important issues in the modern cosmology is to quantify from the present observations the influence of such inhomogeneities on the evolution of the universe .",
    "an interesting possibility to account for such effects is to introduce the smoothness parameter @xmath0 which represents the magnification effects experienced by the light beam .",
    "when @xmath17 ( filled beam ) , the frw case is fully recovered ; @xmath18 stands for a defocusing effect ; @xmath19 represents a totally clumped universe ( empty beam ) .",
    "the distance relation that takes the mass inhomogeneities into account is usually named dyer - roeder distance@xcite , although its theoretical necessity had been previously studied by zeldovich@xcite and kantowski@xcite . in this way",
    ", we label it here as zeldovich - kantowski - dyer - roeder ( zkdr ) distance formula ( for an overview on cosmic distances taking into account the presence of inhomogeneities see the paper by kantowski@xcite ) .",
    "several studies involving the zkdr distances in dark energy models have been published in the last few years .",
    "useful analytical expressions for @xmath2cdm models have been derived by kantowski _",
    "_ @xcite and demianski _",
    "et al._@xcite .",
    "working in the empty beam approximation ( @xmath20 ) , sereno _",
    "et al._@xcite investigated some effects of the zkdr distance for a general background . by assuming that both dominant components may be clustered they also discussed the critical redhift , i.e.",
    ", the value of @xmath21 for which @xmath22 is a maximum ( or @xmath23 minimum ) , and compared to the homogeneous background results as given by lima and alcaniz@xcite , and further discussed by lewis and ibata@xcite .",
    "demianski and coworkers derived an approximate solution for a clumped concordance model valid on the interval @xmath24 .",
    "additional studies on this subject is related to time delays@xcite , gravitational lensing@xcite , and even accelerated models driven by particle creation have been investigated@xcite .    in a previous paper@xcite ,",
    "we have applied the zkdr equation in the framework of phantom cosmology in order to determine cosmological constraints from a sample of milliarcsecond compact radio sources . by assuming a gaussian prior on the matter density parameter , i.e. , @xmath25 , the best fit model for a phantom cosmology with @xmath26 occurs at @xmath27 and @xmath28 when we marginalize over the characteristic size of the compact radio sources .",
    "such results suggested that the zkdr distance can give important corrections to the so - called background tests of dark energy .    0.1 in    in this article ,",
    "the pair of cosmic parameters , @xmath29 and @xmath0 , are constrained from supernovae observations by applying the zkdr distance - redshift relation for a flat ( @xmath2cdm ) model .",
    "as we shall see , the @xmath0 parameter is not well constrained by the 115 sne observed by astier _",
    "however , the 182 sne type ia sample of riess _",
    "( 2007 ) , constrains the pair of parameters to be @xmath8 and @xmath9 ( @xmath5 ) . as a general result , even considering the existence of inhomogeneities described by the @xmath0 parameter",
    ", the einstein - de sitter model is ruled out by the two samples with a high degree of statistical confidence ( @xmath10 and @xmath11 , respectively ) .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii , we present the basic equations and the distance description taking into account the inhomogeneities as described by the zkdr equation . in section iii , we determine the constraints on the cosmic parameters from the two supernovae samples . finally , we summarize the main conclusions in section iv .",
    "in a clumpy universe model , the local geometry is inhomogeneous , but its global aspect can be described by the frw type geometry ( @xmath30 ) @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the scale factor and @xmath33 denotes the metric in the 2-sphere .",
    "as it is widely known , the idea of clumpy universe is still a ill - defined notion since we do not have a clear mathematical recipe to separate the global properties from the local inhomogeneous aspects of the universe .",
    "after dyer & roeder@xcite , it is usual to introduce a phenomenological parameter , @xmath34 , called the  smoothness \" parameter .",
    "such a parameter quantifies the portion of matter in clumps ( @xmath35 ) relative to the amount of background matter which is uniformly distributed ( @xmath36 ) . in general , due to the structure formation process , it should be dependent of the redshift , as well as , on the direction along the line of sight ( see , for instance , @xcite and refs . there in )",
    ". however , in the majority of the works @xmath0 is assumed to be a constant parameter . from a mathematical viewpoint",
    "the treatment is based on the optical - scalar equation for light propagation in the so - called geometric optics approximation@xcite @xmath37 where a prime denotes differentiation with respect to the affine parameter @xmath38 , @xmath39 is the cross - sectional area of the light beam , @xmath40 the ricci tensor , and @xmath41 the photon four - momentum . in this form",
    ", it is implicit that the influence of the weyl tensor ( shear ) can be neglected .",
    "this means that the light rays are propagating far from the mass inhomogeneities so that the large - scale homogeneity implies that their shear contribution are canceled .",
    "the proportionality factor between the cross - sectional length @xmath42 and the angular distance @xmath43 can be defined to be constant . actually , the above optical scalar equation",
    "is usually written in terms of the dimensionless angular diameter distance @xmath44 .",
    "further , by recalling the existence of a simple relation between the luminosity distance , and the angular - diameter distance ( from etherington principle@xcite , @xmath45 ) , it is easy to show that the zkdr ( dimensionless ) luminosity distance for @xmath2cdm cosmology satisfies the following differential equation@xcite    @xmath46    which satisfies the boundary conditions : @xmath47 where @xmath48 , @xmath49 end @xmath50 are functions of the cosmological parameters , expressed in terms of the redshift by :    @xmath51    where as remarked before , the @xmath0 parameter appearing in the @xmath50 expression ( here assumed to be a constant ) quantifies the clustered fraction of the pressureless matter .",
    "the standard frw models contain only homogeneously and isotropically distributed perfect fluid gravity sources , and the present ccm is assumed to represent both the  large scale \" geometry of the universe and the matter content .",
    "however , the universe appears homogeneous only in a statistical sense , when one is describing the largest scales .",
    "therefore , although making very useful predictions , our cosmological models are somewhat inadequate at small and moderate scales .",
    "this means that relations like @xmath52 , the distance modulus for a standard candle , commonly assumed to be valid on average can be incorrect even for observations including sne ia . in particular if the underlying mass density approximately follows luminous matter ( i.e. , associated with bounded galaxies ) , the effects of inhomogeneities on relations like @xmath53 must be taken into account .    0.1 in    in fig . 1",
    ", we display the effects of the inhomogeneities in the reduced hubble - sandage diagram for the astier _",
    "( 2006 ) and riees _ et al . _",
    "( 2007 ) samples for some selected values of the smoothness parameter .",
    "the plots correspond to several values of @xmath1 and @xmath0 as indicated in the panels .",
    "the difference between the data and models from an empty universe case ( ocdm ) prediction is also displayed there .",
    "for the sake of comparison , we also show the einstein - de sitter ( e - ds ) model , i.e. @xmath54 and @xmath17 , as well as the present cosmic concordance ( @xmath55 , @xmath56 , @xmath57 ) .",
    "note that the @xmath0 parameter contributes in the right direction i.e. , the sne type ia become dimmer when it increases on the allowed range . in",
    "what follows , a @xmath3 minimization will be applied for the two sets of sne data with the parameters @xmath58 and @xmath0 spanning the interval [ 0,1 ] in steps of 0.01 , for all numerical computations .",
    "let us now discuss the bounds arising from sne ia observations on the pair of parameters ( @xmath59 ) defining the zkdr luminosity distance .",
    "the current data from supernova legacy survey ( snls ) collaboration correspond to the first year results of its planned five year survey .",
    "the total sample includes 71 high-@xmath21 sne ia in the redshift range @xmath60 plus 44 low-@xmath21 sne ia as published by astier _",
    "et al._@xcite .",
    "although in a better agreement with wmap 3-years results @xcite than the _ gold _ sample @xcite ( for a more detailed discussion see e.g. , jassal _",
    "et al._@xcite ) , the most distant sne ia of these 115 events has redshift smaller than unity .",
    "following standard lines , the maximum likelihood estimator , @xmath61 $ ] , is determined by a @xmath62 statistics @xmath63 where @xmath64 is the complete set of parameters that we want to fit , @xmath65 , @xmath66 are , respectively , the errors associated with the observational techniques in determining the distance moduli ( includes a peculiar contribution ) and the intrinsic dispersion of sne ia .",
    "the corresponding errors are reported in astier _",
    "_ paper @xcite .",
    "marginalizing our likelihood function over the nuisance parameter , @xmath67 , we obtain the likelihood function for the @xmath68 plane . in order to determine the cosmological parameters ( @xmath1,@xmath0 ) ,",
    "a @xmath3 minimization for the range of [ 0,1 ] in steps of @xmath69 has been applied .",
    "the @xmath70 , @xmath71 and @xmath72 confidence levels are defined by the conventional two - parameters @xmath3 levels @xmath73 , @xmath74 and @xmath75 , respectively .",
    "it is very important to note that we do not consider any prior in @xmath1 , as usually required by the sne ia test .",
    "0.1 in    the basic results are shown in figs .",
    "2a , 2b and 2c . from fig .",
    "2a we see that all range for @xmath0 is accepted , while a @xmath76 is obtained . in fig .",
    "3b we see the likelihood for the smoothness parameter .",
    "the best fit adjustment occurs for values of @xmath77 and @xmath55 with @xmath78 and @xmath79 degrees of freedom ( @xmath80 ) , thereby showing that the model provides a good fit to these data .",
    "it is also interesting that for any @xmath0 value , we also find no evidence for a high @xmath1 parameter as required by a flat einstein - de sitter universe ( @xmath81 ) .",
    "actually , the einstein - de sitter scenario has a very small statistical significance @xmath82 ( @xmath10 outside ) .",
    "however , since the astier _",
    "_ data are not restrictive for the @xmath0 parameter , let us now consider the enlarged sneia sample observed by the high - z supernovae search team @xcite .      the so - called _ gold _ sample from the hzs team @xcite is a selection of 182 sne ia events distributed over the redshift interval @xmath83 , and constitutes the compilation of the best observations made so far by them and by the supernova cosmology project events observed by hubble space telescope ( hst ) . as before , constrains on the cosmological parameters ( @xmath1,@xmath0 ) , are determined from a @xmath3 minimization within the range of [ 0,1 ] spanned by such parameters .    in fig .",
    "3a one can see that @xmath84 and @xmath85 with @xmath86 of statistical confidence .",
    "the best fit adjustment occurs for values of @xmath87 and @xmath88 with @xmath89 and @xmath90 degrees of freedom the reduced ( @xmath91 ) .",
    "therefore , the model provides a very good fit to the riess _",
    "et al . _ sample . in fig .",
    "3b we see the likelihood for the smoothness parameter . as previously remarked , the riess _",
    "data set is much more restrictive for the smoothness parameter than astier _",
    "et al . _ sample . within @xmath5 , the allowed range for",
    "the @xmath0 falls on the interval @xmath84 ( cf fig 2a ) . in fig 3c",
    "we show the probability for the density matter parameter . in this case a small region is permitted @xmath85 with of the confidence level ( @xmath5 ) . in the analysis for the einstein - de sitter universe ( @xmath92 , @xmath93 ) , the @xmath94 is too bad ( @xmath11 c.l .",
    "outside for 1 degree of freedom ) , and guarantee us to exclude this model with high confidence .",
    "cosmology is in an exciting period . a considerable set of rather sophisticated experiments , until a few years ago regarded as futuristic ,",
    "have now been completed with spectacular success .",
    "the results of the first observations almost one decade ago have been confirmed what was long surmised , namely , that most of the matter is nonbaryonic and that we live in an accelerating expanding universe dominated by dark energy .    in this article , we have discussed the influence of inhomogeneities on the expansion rate of the universe . in particular , if the smoothness @xmath0 parameter could be constrained through a statistical analysis involving two large sets of sne ia data . as we have seen , in the case of the astier _",
    "_ sample , the entire interval of @xmath0 is allowed while a @xmath76 is obtained . within the existing uncertainties ,",
    "these results are consistent with the constraints obtained from angular diameter of compact radio sources with basis on the gurvits _ et al .",
    "_ data @xcite ) .",
    "therefore , although in close agreement with rather different analysis , this sne data set is uncapable to constrain the smoothness parameter . actually , at this moment , the sample of riess _",
    "provides a more stringent constrain with the allowed range for @xmath0 falling on the interval @xmath84 ( @xmath5 ) .",
    "basically , this occurs because the riess _",
    "_ sample extends to appreciably higher redshifts . in general ,",
    "both analysis suggest that a large range for @xmath0 is permitted , and that the einstein - de sitter model is strongly excluded ( @xmath10 and @xmath11 , respectively ) . as we have seen , the necessity of the dark energy and a transition from deceleration to an accelerating phase is maintained even when one takes into account the clustering phenomenon .",
    "however , at the level of the sne ia observations discussed here , these results suggest that the clumpiness of matter distribution can mimic at least a small fraction of the dark energy component .",
    "finally , we would like to stress that measurements from sne ia combined with the zkdr inhomogeneous approach adopted here may provide an independent and more rigorous cosmological test for the cosmic concordance model in the near future . in this concern",
    ", it should be very important to investigate whether the @xmath0 parameter can be constrained using independent observations , among them : the cosmic microwave background anisotropies , the physics of galaxies clusters , sunyaev - zeldovich effect , time delay and statistical of gravitational lensing .",
    "some studies along these lines will be presented in a forthcoming communication .",
    "the present results based only on the hubble - sandage diagram show that the riess _",
    "sample more restrictive than the astier _",
    "_ sample , thereby reinforcing the interest to observe more supernova events at higher redshifts .",
