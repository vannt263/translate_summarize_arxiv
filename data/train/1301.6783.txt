    "many questions about spectra and eigenfunctions of elliptic operators are motivated by bohr s correspondence principle in quantum mechanics , asserting that a classical dynamical system manifests itself in the semiclassical ( as planck s constant @xmath0 ) limit of its quantization .",
    "when the quantum system is given by the laplacian @xmath1 on the riemannian manifold @xmath2 ( describing a quantum particle on @xmath2 in the absence of electric and magnetic fields ) the corresponding classical system is the geodesic flow @xmath3 on @xmath2 , so in the high energy limit eigenfunctions should reflect the properties of the geodesic flow .",
    "one of the most studied question concerns limits of eigenfunctions . to an eigenfunction @xmath4 with @xmath5 one can associate a measure @xmath6 on @xmath2 with the density @xmath7 ; its phase space counterpart is a distribution @xmath8 on the unit cosphere bundle @xmath9 , projecting to @xmath6 .",
    "it can be defined as follows : given a smooth function @xmath10 on @xmath9 ( an observable ) , we choose a `` quantization , '' a pseudodifferential operator @xmath11 of order zero with principal symbol @xmath10 , and let @xmath12 the definition of the measures @xmath8 depends of course on the choice of the quantization map @xmath13 , but any two choices differ by an operator of a lower order , and that does not affect the asymptotic behaviour of @xmath14 .",
    "the measures @xmath8 are sometimes called _ wigner measures . _",
    "a natural problem is to study the set of weak * limit points of @xmath15-s ; it follows from egorov s theorem that any limit measure is invariant under the geodesic flow , but the limits are quite different for manifolds with integrable and ergodic geodesic flows . if @xmath2 has completely integrable geodesic flow @xmath3 , sequences of @xmath8-s concentrate on liouville tori in phase space satisfying the quantization condition .",
    "let @xmath16 be the the counting function of the laplacian ( as usual , we enumerate eigenvalues taking into account their multiplicities ) .",
    "recall that , by the weyl formula , @xmath17    if @xmath3 is ergodic , the following fundamental result ( sometimes called _ quantum ergodicity _ theorem ) holds .",
    "[ thm : qerg ] let @xmath2 be a compact manifold with ergodic geodesic flow , and let @xmath18 be a zero order pseudodifferential operator with principal symbol @xmath19 . then @xmath20 or , equivalently , @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the normalized canonical measure on @xmath9 .",
    "the theorem shows that for a subsequence @xmath23 of eigenfunctions of the full density , @xmath24 , and after projecting to @xmath2 we find that @xmath25 ( weak@xmath26 ) . in other words ,",
    "almost all high energy eigenfunctions become equidistributed on the manifold and in phase space .",
    "various versions of theorem [ thm : qerg ] were proved in @xcite by shnirelman , zelditch , colin de verdire and helffer  martinez  robert , as well as in other papers .",
    "quantum ergodicity has been established for billiards in @xcite by grard ",
    "leichtnam and zelditch  zworski .",
    "important further questions concern the rate of convergence in , quantum analogues of mixing and entropy .",
    "rudnick and sarnak conjectured that on negatively curved manifolds , the conclusion of theorem [ thm : qerg ] holds _ without averaging _ , or equivalently @xmath27 for _ all _ eigenfunctions ; this is sometimes called _ quantum unique ergodicity _ ( que ) .",
    "this conjecture has been proved for some arithmetic hyperbolic manifolds by lindenstrauss , with further progress by soundararajan and holowinsky . on the other hand",
    ", a. hassell ( @xcite ) has shown that on the bunimovich stadium billiard , there exist _ exceptional _ sequences of eigenfunctions concentrating on the `` bouncing ball '' orbits , so the analogue of the que conjecture does not hold for all billiards .",
    "the aim of this paper is to identify the correct semiclassical dynamics corresponding to quantum systems with discontinuities .",
    "more precisely , we are looking at manifolds ( possibly with boundary ) whose metrics are allowed to have jump discontinuities across codimension one hypersurfaces . such manifolds model situations in physics where waves propagate in matter that consists of different layers of materials . in the simplest case",
    "we would have two isotropic materials touching at a hypersurface .",
    "the metric in each layer is then given by @xmath28 , where @xmath29 is the refraction index in layer @xmath30 and @xmath31 is the euclidian metric on the tangent bundle .",
    "wave propagation in these media is described by the wave equation @xmath32 where @xmath1 is the laplace operator with respect to the metric @xmath33 and transmissive boundary conditions are imposed on the solutions .",
    "the high energy limit of such a systems shows properties that do not remind of classical mechanics : singularities of solutions travel on geodesics until they hit the discontinuity .",
    "then they are reflected and refracted according to the laws of geometrical optics .",
    "consequently , there is no classical flow on phase space that describes the high energy limit .",
    "moreover , the naive generalization of egorov s theorem fails in this situation .",
    "if @xmath18 is a pseudodifferential operator on the manifold supported away from the discontinuity then the quantum mechanical time - evolution @xmath34 of @xmath18 will in general fail to be a pseudodifferential operator .",
    "thus , on the algebraic level of observables the quantum - classical correspondence fails .",
    "we will show that after forming an average over the eigenstates the quantum dynamics relates to a certain probabilistic dynamics that takes into account the different branches of geodesics emerging in this way .",
    "our main result establishes a quantum ergodicity theorem in the case where this classical dynamics is ergodic .",
    "our proof relies on a precise symbolic calculus for fourier integral operators associated with canonical transformations ( see section [ s : fio ] ) and on a local weyl law for such operators ( theorem [ t : local - fio ] ) .",
    "we construct a local parametrix for the wave kernel consisting of a sum of such fourier integral operators ( section [ t : parametrix ] ) and apply to them the above results .",
    "the usual proof of quantum ergodicity is based on the consideration of the positive operator obtained by squaring the average of the time - evolution of a pseudodifferential operator .",
    "egorov s theorem plays an important role in this construction .",
    "since it does not hold in our setting , the standard proof can not be directly applied .",
    "instead we use the local weyl law for an operator that is not necessarily positive but whose expectation value with respect to any eigenfunction is positive .",
    "we then apply the symbolic calculus to obtain an explicit formula for the leading asymptotic coefficient .",
    "the proof of the main result is presented in full detail in section [ s : ergodicity ] .",
    "it should be mentioned that local weyl laws of the type given in theorem [ t : local - fio ] are very powerful and have many applications . in particular , a less explicit but similar result was recently stated and used in @xcite and @xcite to prove quantum ergodic restriction theorems .",
    "ray splitting not only occurs in the quantum systems we consider but also happens in situations described by systems of partial differential equations and higher order equations .",
    "moreover , ray - splitting occurs in a natural way in quantum graphs .",
    "our results carry over in a straightforward manner to these situations .",
    "ray - splitting billiards have been studied extensively in the physics literature , see e.g. @xcite and references therein .",
    "the emphasis has been on spectral statistics , trace formulae , eigenfunction localization ( `` scarring '' ) , and the behaviour of periodic orbits . in the mathematical literature",
    ", the emphasis has been on the propagation of singularities @xcite and spectral asymptotics @xcite .",
    "quantum ergodicity has not previously been considered for ray - splitting ( or branching ) billiards .",
    "our results fill an important gap in the semiclassical theory of such systems .",
    "it is our hope that our results will serve as a motivation to further study a probabilistic dynamical system that we introduce .",
    "following zelditch and zworksi @xcite , we say that @xmath2 is a compact manifold with piecewise smooth lipschitz boundary if @xmath2 is a compact subset of a smooth manifold @xmath35 such that there exists a finite collection of smooth functions @xmath36 such that    1 .",
