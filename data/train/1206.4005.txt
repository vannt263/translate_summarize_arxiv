    "a classical nova ( cn ) explosion results from a thermonuclear runaway ( tnr ) on the surface of a white dwarf ( wd ) that has accreted matter from a dwarf secondary star in a close binary system .",

    "the uncertainty in the abundance solution obtained through detailed balancing arguments is contingent upon the accuracy of the electron temperature and density .",

    "the rate of emission is no longer directly related to the rate of excitation since the lines are subjected to collisional damping .",
    "the simplistic assumptions made in the low density limit are no longer valid and one must use the full level balancing equations to properly estimate the population of the emitting species . if all ionization states actually present in the ejecta are not observed , then it may be necessary to use photoionization codes ( e.g. , cloudy , * ? ? ?",

    "we derived the abundances of metals in the ejecta by number relative to hydrogen by comparison of the sum of the populations of an observed species to the total number of hydrogen atoms .",
    "we then compared these ionic abundances to the total solar abundances compiled by @xcite , where the logarithmic solar abundances , log(n@xmath16/n@xmath17)@xmath1 , are : he = -1.07 ; o = -3.31 ; ne = -4.06 ; mg = -4.40 ; s = -4.88 ; ar = -5.60 ; and fe = -4.50 .",
    "a limitation of this approach is that the spectra presented here no longer contain any signatures of hydrogen recombination emission from the ejecta .",
    "this absence means that we are unable to make a direct comparison between the populations implied by the observed emission lines to the amount of hydrogen within the ejecta .",
    "thus , we are forced to rely on estimations of the ejected hydrogen mass made at earlier epochs .",

    "in the present data , the optical and far - ir lines could not be used .",
    "so instead , we derived estimates for the temperature based upon the ratio of [ ] 14.32 to 24.30 , when available .    in the event that none of the above methods for estimating @xmath21 were available , we derived estimates by comparison with other cne taking into consideration the relative ages of the systems.cooling by ir fine structure lines could be very efficient provided that the densities in the ejecta were lower than the critical densities of the prominent ir transitions @xcite , and particularly if the ejecta are metal - rich @xcite .",

    "indeed , the inferred clump density is as high as was derived during the first 100  300 days after eruption ( ( 5.8  9.4)@xmath284 @xmath171 ; * ? ? ?",
    "this suggests that the clumps have experienced very little dissipation during the intervening 1300  1500 days .",
    "clumpiness in the ejecta of cne seems to be relatively common as indicated by direct imaging of novae shells ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* for examples ) , by photoionization modeling of the nebular emission ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and by examination of emission lines ( e.g. , v382 vel ;  [ sec : v382vel_line_struct ] ) . in v1494 aql the strong contrast in density between the diffuse and clumpy material is unusual .",
    "photoionization models typically suggest a density contrast of a factor of @xmath285 , not @xmath286 as implied by the line ratios here .",
    "the assumption that the temperature distribution is continuous across the boundary between the clumpy and diffuse material allows us to place constraints on @xmath21 using the line ratios . as demonstrated by the [ ] ratio",
    ", @xmath21 must be greater than 7500 k. @xcite derived an electron temperature consistently around 11000 k over four observations during the first 100  300 days of development ( see below ) .",
    "the relatively high temperatures implied by the [ ] lines suggest then that the temperature was `` frozen - in '' early in the evolutionary development .",
    "this is somewhat surprising considering the strength of the [ ] 25.91  line , which is typically an efficient ir coolant .",
    "however , the saddle - shaped [ ] line profile differs strongly from that of the rounded o and ne lines .",
    "if this is due to a different distribution of the [ ] emitting material , then it might explain the high values of @xmath21 in spite of the presence of strong ir cooling lines .",
    "indeed , figure [ fig : fluxevolve ] indicates the the [ ] line decays as @xmath287 , far too shallow to arise from a thin shell .",
    "it is possible that the distribution is in an equatorial ring as hypothesized by some authors to explain saddle - shaped emission profiles observed early in the outburst .",
    "it is interesting , however , that the other lines no longer show the same profile .",
    "this may imply that the [ ] emission is coming from the remnants of the expanding ring structure .",
    "based on the phenomenology of the outburst , one would expect that v1494 aql was an one nova .",
    "it was a bright nova with a very fast light curve decline ( t@xmath307 days ) , high expansion velocities ( @xmath308 km s@xmath15 ) , and rapid transition to the coronal stage with emission from species having ionization potentials in excess of 400 ev ",
    "properties that are all consistent with an one eruption . however , our derived abundances for o and ne are not high enough to state with certainty that the outburst of v1494 aql arose on an one wd , as these systems are expected to have ne abundances @xmath309 times solar @xcite .    in figure",
    "[ fig : novaecompare ] , we compare the abundances of o and ne reported in the literature for a selection of novae of both the one and co types ( open and closed circles respectively ) . though we emphasize that the selection of targets for the plot is not exhaustive , it is nevertheless immediately apparent that there is a clear demarcation between the one- and co - type systems . filled triangles represent systems that have been reported in the literature as being peculiar in some way .",
    "v1500 cyg was one of the fastest and brightest novae observed @xcite , yet its abundances seem to be intermediate between those of the one and co novae classes @xcite .",
    "conversely , while the abundances of v723 cas are considered to be typical of one novae , it had an exceptionally slow light curve development ( t@xmath310 days , * ? ? ?",
    "in addition , it is highly atypical for an one nova since it has one of the longest known sss stages among cne , which is still ongoing after @xmath311 years @xcite .",
    "@xcite classified cp cru as a system intermediate between co- and one - type novae based in part on its low mg abundance relative to ne .",
    "the extremes of the abundance limits estimated for each of the sources examined in the present study are are shown linked with dashed lines .",
    "the range of abundances found for v382 vel and v1974 cyg are roughly consistent with what was determined through more detailed methods by other authors and both fall well within the range of abundances found for typical one novae .",
    "further , the range of values determined in our analysis follow the trends observed across the more broad distribution of one sources .",
    "in contrast , the range of estimates for v1494 aql clearly lie within the distribution of co novae . in order for v1494 aql to be considered an one nova , one would need to assume that the lower limits found for the neon abundance in the present study are an order of magnitude lower than the true abundances .",
    "this claim seems difficult to justify considering the lack of strong neon in the optical spectra and the broad consistency with other estimates found for v382 vel and v1974 cyg using the same methodology .",
    "hence , we consider the abundances in v1494 aql to be more consistent with an extreme co nova , in spite of its one - like outburst properties . in this respect ,",
    "v1494 aql may be similar to very fast and bright novae such as lmc 1991 @xcite or v1500 cyg @xcite .",
    "both of these systems exhibited extreme outburst characteristics relative to their rather low neon abundances ( less than solar in the case of lmc 1991 and @xmath312 times solar for v1500 cyg ) .",
    "careful examination of figure [ fig : novaecompare ] also reveals a possible discrepancy between the results obtained in the present study for v1974 cyg and those for the prototypical one nova qu vul .",
    "the estimates for the neon abundances in both systems are high . in the case of v1974 cyg , estimates range from 15 times solar @xcite to @xmath313 times solar @xcite .",
    "our estimates here result in abundances of neon that are @xmath314 times solar . by comparison ,",
    "qu vul was found to have neon abundances ranging from @xmath315 times solar @xcite to @xmath316 times solar @xcite ( both scaled to the solar abundances of @xcite ) .",
    "strong emission from [ ] and [ ] were observed in the ir at 7078 days after outburst in the ejecta of qu vul . yet our observations of v1974 cyg revealed that the neon emission present at @xmath317 days after outburst had all but disappeared by day 5354 .",
    "if the abundances were so similar , why would the neon emission in v1974 cyg fade so much more rapidly than in qu vul ?",
    "the differences can not be due to the relative distances of the objects as the best estimates for both are @xmath318  3 kpc .",
    "in addition , the final two _ spitzer _ observations of v1974 cyg went significantly deeper than those of qu vul  up to 140 and 300 seconds for the sl and sh modules for v1974 cyg versus 30 and 36 seconds for qu vul  implying that neither could the discrepancy be due to the depth of the observations .",
    "we consider the best estimate for the ejecta mass of v1974 cyg to be @xmath163 m@xmath1 (  [ sec : v1974_vals ] ) , whereas the mass of ejecta in qu vul is thought to be of order @xmath319 m@xmath1 ( * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "again , this is not discrepant enough to account for the relative emission line strengths in the two systems .",
    "however , when one also considers the relative velocities of the two systems , a solution presents itself .",
    "the average ejecta velocity of v1974 cyg was @xmath320 km s@xmath15 , nearly double that of qu vul at @xmath321 km s@xmath15 . hence , the dilution of the ejecta in v1974 cyg would occur much more rapidly than in qu vul .",
    "since the emissivity of the emission lines is proportional to the square of the density , the difference in line strengths can be explained by the higher velocities in the ejecta of v1974 cyg .",
    "we have presented ir and optical observations of three cne in their late nebular stages ( @xmath322 years post - outburst ) .",
    "we derived lower limits to abundances by number , relative to hydrogen using ejecta masses obtained during earlier stages of the outbursts . in the case of v1494 aql",
    ", we used nearly contemporaneous optical spectra to obtain an independent estimate of the o abundance through direct comparison to h@xmath112 .",
    "we placed lower limits on the abundances of oxygen and neon ( 9 and 35 times solar , respectively ) in the ejecta of v1974 cygni and found that the high abundances of these elements is consistent with earlier studies .",
    "our derived abundances support the conclusion that the system contains an one wd .",
    "although the emission lines of neon were weak relative to the [ ] line at 25.91 , the profiles suggested that the oxygen and neon emission may arise in different regions of the ejecta .",
    "further , the stability of the oxygen line profile implied that the ejecta were still expanding ballistically and had not undergone substantial deceleration by the surrounding ambient medium .",
    "the late time spectra of v382 vel revealed emission lines from oxygen , neon , argon and sulfur , allowing us to estimate lower limits to the abundances of each of these elements .",
    "in particular , we found that the neon abundance was at least 18 times solar , with respect to hydrogen , oxygen was at least 1.7 times solar , and argon and sulfur were at least 0.1 times solar .",
    "the neon and oxygen abundances were consistent with results from previous studies .",
    "our values represent the first abundance estimates for argon or sulfur in the ejecta of v382 vel , but unfortunately they do not significantly constrain the abundances of these species .",
    "examination of the emission line structure during this late optically thin stage demonstrated that the various emitting species had different spatial distributions in the ejecta and indicate the possible presence of ionization gradients .",
    "our optical and _ spitzer _ ir observations of v1494 aql provided the first detection of neon in this object .",
    "based upon these data , we derived a minimum abundance of neon relative to hydrogen , relative to solar of about 5 .",
    "this neon abundance is not high enough to confirm an one progenitor wd and , taken in concert with the high oxygen abundance ( @xmath323 times solar ) , more strongly suggests a co wd .",
    "the late time observation of neon in the ejecta of v1494 aql reveals the importance of high sensitivity observations in the ir and near - uv regimes as well as the value of late time observations for characterizing the physical conditions and geometry of the nebular environment .",
