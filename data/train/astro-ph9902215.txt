    "the process of gravitational instability leads to the growth and collapse of initially small inhomogeneities in a self - gravitating medium .",
    "this is the basic idea behind theories for the formation of galaxies and large - scale structures in the universe , as the small initial fluctuations seed the formation of collapsed objects that progressively cluster and merge into objects of larger size , such as galaxies and clusters .",
    "much progress has been made during the last two decades using numerical simulations to follow the evolution of cosmological density fluctuations up to and beyond their collapse into bound structures , but it is nevertheless important to develop an analytical framework for describing this phenomenon and understanding what the simulation results .",
    "much of the previous analytic work in this direction has been based on an extended version of the press - schechter ( 1974 ) model .",
    "such methods have been used to study the distribution of formation epochs ( bond et al .",
    "1991 ; lacey & cole 1993 ; see white 1993 for a complete review ) , merger rates and survival times of haloes and also how the distribution of collapsed objects relates to the underlying mass distribution ( mo & white 1996 ; mo et al .",
    "tests of these predictions have shown good agreement with theoretical model predictions .",
    "other recent methods which try to explain statistics of collapsed dark objects depend on extension of zeldovich approximation ( lee & shandarin 1997 , 1998 ; catelan et al .",
    "1998 ; porciani et al . 1998 ) .",
    "a parallel approach has been to assume that statistical properties of the distribution of collapsed objects - particularly the many - body correlation functions - follow a hierarchical scaling pattern ( balian & schaeffer 1989a , b ) .",
    "this kind of scaling can be used to predict , for example , the mass function of collapsed objects ( valageas & schaeffer 1997 ) and their correlation properties ( bernardeau & schaeffer 1992 ; munshi et al .",
    "these results are especially interesting because they relate directly to the statistics of the underlying mass distribution and hence to the dynamical origin of the distribution governed by the bbgky equations .",
    "predictions of the behaviour of one - point statistical quantities such as the count probability distribution function ( cpdf ) or void probability distribution function ( vpf ) for the underlying mass distribution in the highly non - linear regime of strong clustering were derived using this kind of scaling _ ansatz _ by balian & schaeffer ( 1988 , 1989 ) .",
    "these results were later extended to the quasi - linear regime where a perturbative series expansion can be used ( beranardeau 1992 , 1994a , 1994b , 1995 ) .",
    "it emerged from these and other studies that a scaling hierarchy naturally developed by the action of gravitational clustering on gaussian ( random - phase ) initial perturbations .",
    "predictions for these one - point quantities have been tested with reasonable success against observations using various galaxy catalogs ( maurogordato & lachieze - rey 1987 ; blanchard et al .",
    "1990 ; mourogordato et al .",
    "1992 ; bouchet et al .",
    "1993 ) and numerical simulations ( bouchet & hernquist 1992 ; lucchin et .",
    "al 1994 ; colombi et al .",
    "1992 , 1994 , 1995 , 1996 ; munshi et al .",
    "1998c ) , although lucchin et al .",
    "( 1994 ) and colombi et al .",
    "( 1996 ) found some deviation from scaling .",
    "it is natural now to ask whether these properties of one - point statistical quantities can be generalised to two - point statistics , or even beyond .",
    "the two - point count probability distribution function ( 2cpdf ) and two - point void probability function ( 2vpf ) , both defined in detail below , are particularly interesting for a number of different reasons .",
    "the first is that the 2vpf can be shown to be a generating function for the cumulant correlators ( ccs ) in a way which is very similar to the vpf , which acts as a generating function for cumulants .",
    "recently it was shown that ccs can be reliably measured using galaxy catalogs ( szapudi et al .",
    "1992 ; meiksin et al .",
    "1992 ; szapudi et al 1995 ; szapudi & szalay 1997 ) .",
    "they were also measured in numerical simulations ( munshi & melott 1998 ) to test extended perturbation theory ( ept ) as proposed by colombi et al .",
    "since it becomes increasingly difficult to measure these quantities with increasing order , it is sensible instead to study their generating function ( 2vpf ) which carries information to all orders .",
    "the second reason is that these two - point objects are useful in the problem of estimating errors associated with the determination of one - point quantities such as the cpdf , vpf and @xmath0 parameters ( szapudi & colombi 1995 ) .",
    "although analytical results related to two - point quantities are frequently used to estimate and correct such errors , no systematic studies have yet been done to test these predictions directly against numerical simulations , partly because of the difficulty of performing numerical simulations with the very large dynamic range necessary to study these quantities . finally , the 2cpdf carries information as to how overdense regions are biased tracers of the underlying mass distribution , so a computation of the bias implied by the scaling ansatz can provide an understanding of the origin of bias that can be compared with results from other approaches .",
    "before proceeding , however , we stress that one should not get too carried away by the success of this kind of scaling model .",
    "the hierarchical ansatz is , at best , a simplifying hypothesis which , admittedly seems to work very well for `` realistic models '' of structure formation .",
    "but no firm connection has yet been established with the microscopic physics of collisionless clustering described by bbgky equations ( peebles 1980 ) .",
    "most efforts in solving the bbgky equations have focused on particular closure schemes ( davis & peebles 1977 ) , the general separability of position correlations and momentum correlation in phase - space ( fry 1984 ; hamilton 1988 ) and its stability properties ( ruamsuwan & fry 1992 ; yano & gouda 1998 ) .",
    "although these precious efforts in solving the highly complicated nonlinear integro - differential bbgky equations provide us with valuable insights , they also help underline the complications in arriving in any general solution to the problem .",
    "our inability to solve these equations in the highly non - linear regime leaves us with undetermined parameters which can only be computed from numerical simulations , thus complicating the task of testing the scaling ansatz itself .",
    "this paper is structured in the following way .",
    "section 2 is devoted to a theoretical discussion of multi - point cumulants , multi - point factorial moments , multi - point factorial correlators and their various generating functions .",
    "we also develop a general approach to the treatment of finite - volume effects using these quantities .",
    "section 3 is devoted specifically to one - point and two - point statistics .",
    "we summarize the main analytical results of balian & schaeffer ( 1989 ) and bernardeau & schaeffer ( 1992 ) and test them numerically .",
    "section 4 contains a detailed description of our numerical simulations and to details of data analysis techniques ; we also present the results of our analysis in this section .",
    "we discuss the main results and relate it to other studies in section 5 .",
    "the void probability function ( vpf ) is the probability that a randomly - placed sphere of some volume @xmath1 contains no galaxies .",
    "this can be written @xmath2 in which the mean number of galaxies per cell is @xmath3 and the volume - average of the two - point correlation function over the cell is @xmath4 the quantity @xmath5 .",
    "the vpf is a generating function of @xmath6 , the count probability distribution function ( cpdf ) for cells of the same size ( balian & schaeffer 1989 ) .",
    "let us assume using the generating function relationship between the cpdf and vpf we can write @xmath7 which can also be written in the following integral form ( munshi et al . 1998c ) @xmath8 the integral is to be evaluated along a contour around @xmath9 .",
    "we also define the function @xmath10 which can be directly related to the function @xmath11 , the continuous analogue of @xmath6 , @xmath12 using the definition of @xmath6 now one can easily show that @xmath13 this is the form of distribution obtained when @xmath11 is poisson sampled , because it is the convolution of the function @xmath11 with a poisson distribution describing the shot noise effects .",
    "this demonstrates that @xmath11 can be viewed as the continuous limit of @xmath6 in the limit of large number densities .",
    "this can be seen by change of variable @xmath14 in equation ( 3 ) and then taking the limit @xmath15 and @xmath16 with the ratio @xmath17 remaining finite ; this also gives @xmath18 .",
    "the factorial moments of @xmath6 can now be related to the moments of @xmath11 with the aid of the definition of the @xmath19-th factorial moment : @xmath20 one can similarly define the normalized factorial moments of @xmath6 by @xmath21 one can define a generating function @xmath22 for the @xmath23 parameters using @xmath24 and we have the following expression connecting these two generating functions @xmath25 and @xmath22 ( munshi et al .",
    "1998c ) , @xmath26 which can also be written as @xmath27    it is possible to extend the method of generating functions to multi - point factorial moments .",
    "if we denote the two - point cpdf @xmath28 , the joint probability of finding @xmath29 particles in the first cell and @xmath30 particles in a second cell , and assume locally poisson sampling distribution then we can relate @xmath28 with its smooth counterpart @xmath31 by : @xmath32 so that the two - point factorial moment becomes @xmath33 we define the normalised two - point factorial moment by following equation .",
    "@xmath34 it is to be noted that , in general , owing to statistical isotropy and homogeneity @xmath35 should depend only on the separation of two cells .",
    "we define the generating function for @xmath35 by @xmath36 , i.e. @xmath37 and similarly the generating function for the 2ccs by @xmath38 using similar technique as used for the case of one - point moments we can relate @xmath39 with @xmath40 : @xmath41 a taylor expansion of the above equation provides us with a set of relations which can be used to measure @xmath42 once @xmath43 is computed : @xmath44 in our above analysis we have used two different cells of the same size , but it is now obvious that the corresponding result for two cells of different size will read @xmath45 these results can be extended reasonably straightforwardly to three - point quantities : @xmath46 where @xmath47 and @xmath48 the quantity @xmath49 is similarly the three - point generalisation of the two - point quantity @xmath36 . expanding this relation",
    "one can express three - point moments in terms of factorial moments of the three - point cpdf .",
    "@xmath50    it is possible to generalise these equations for an arbitrary number of points : @xmath51 where @xmath52 it is important to note that two - point quantities depend only on the separation of two cells , but the multiple - point correlators and their generating functions depend on the geometrical configuration of different cells .",
    "we have used the following definition for multiple - point cumulant correlators : @xmath53 inverting this relation , we can express @xmath54 in terms of the generating function for factorial moments , which can be measured directly from simulations : @xmath55 where we have defined @xmath56 it is also possible to work with factorial correlators instead of the factorial moments defined above by extending the two - point factorial correlators introduced by szapudi & szalay ( 1995 ) to multiple points .",
    "if we denote the @xmath57 order factorial moments in different cells by @xmath58 then we can write the generating function of the two - point factorial correlators @xmath59 by @xmath60 , the generating function of the three - point factorial correlator @xmath61 by @xmath62 , and so on",
    ". in general @xmath63 denotes the generating function for s - point factorial correlators @xmath64 : @xmath65 now it is possible to link the basis function @xmath66 for computing multi - point cumulant correlators with the other set of basis functions @xmath67 , which carries equivalent information . @xmath68",
    "relating multi - point factorial moments with generating functions of multiple - point cumulant correlators ( defined earlier ) we can write : @xmath69 generalizing these results , and connecting multi - point factorial correlators with multi - point void probability functions we obtain the result equivalent to eq([gen1 ] ) .",
    "@xmath70 it is to be noted that multi - point cumulant correlators can also be defined in such a way that they incorporate all lower order correlations .",
    "for example , if we allow one or more of the powers @xmath71 or @xmath72 to vanish the correlator becomes independent of one or more spatial co - ordinates .",
    "this will allows a more compact way to express factorial moments in terms of multi - point cumulant correlators ( szapudi & szalay 1997 ) which is equivalent to the result obtained using factorial moments .",
    "however , it is useful to decompose multi - point factorial moments and multi - point factorial correlators in terms of irreducible one - point and two - point quantities from a computational point of view .",
    "as we shall see , this also allows us to relate multi - point cumulant correlators directly with the tree amplitudes involved in the hierarchical ansatz .",
    "the discussion so far is completely general .",
    "while szapudi & szalay ( 1993 ) used the hierarchical approximation of @xmath73 and analogous approximations for higher orders , we will be concentrating on the formalism developed by bernardeau & schaeffer ( 1992 ) in which amplitudes associated with hierarchical trees are assumed to be the product of tree vertices .",
    "following paper i , we can now relate @xmath74 with generating functions @xmath75 of vertices appearing in tree - representation of multi - point cumulant correlators which depends on the hierarchical ansatz .",
    "these vertices depend on the tree - level amplitudes @xmath76 in representation of correlation hierarchy of matter correlation function ( see paper i for complete discussion ) : @xmath77 etc .",
    "the quantities @xmath78 determine the amplitude associated with a vertex that has @xmath79 external legs . using the vertex generating function we can express @xmath74 as : @xmath80 in deriving above relations we have considered only the dominant contribution and this approximation is valid only when the density variance in each cell is much higher than the correlation between cells .",
    "szapudi & szalay ( 1997 ) proposed the use of the two - point cumulant correlator to separate amplitudes associated with different tree vertices , but since the number of tree topologies increases exponentially with order of the diagram ( fry 1984 ) , the two - point cumulant correlator can only be useful in up to @xmath81 order diagrams",
    ". this deficiency can only be cured by moving to multi - point cumulants and our formalism developed here will be able to determine @xmath76 parameters for arbitrary @xmath79 .",
    "however , it is obvious that multi - point cumulants are in general dependent on the geometric configuration of the points , and their determination becomes more complicated as the order increases .",
    "we also stress the point that our formalism can in general be used in principle to determine all the tree amplitudes without making any assumptions at all .",
    "this is very useful as this can actually test the validity of all hierarchical models of gravitational clustering in the highly nonlinear regime .",

    "the tree structure of mpcdf and associated multi - point factorial moments is induced by the inherent tree structure of correlation functions and is very similar in nature .",
    "it is interesting to note that , in this particular case , contributions from different orders are completely separated and also the contribution to joint moments from different spatial locations can be expressed as different independent local terms depending only on one spatial co - ordinate .",
    "this also makes volume corrections easier to perform , as we shall see in  4 .",
    "scaling properties that arise because of the inherent tree structure of correlation functions in highly non - linear regime were studied by balian & schaeffer ( 1989 ) .",
    "the principal assumption in this and related studies is that the vertex amplitudes which appear in a tree development of higher - order correlation functions should be constants .",

    "there is some support from observations for such an assumption in highly nonlinear regime . on the other hand , in the quasi - linear regime and in the limit of vanishing variance such",
    "a hierarchy occurs naturally but the hierarchical coefficients in general depend on different shape parameters appearing in higher - order correlations .",
    "recent studies of the bispectrum , however , show that nonlinearity tends to smooth out such shape dependence and in the highly non - linear regime the bispectrum becomes completely independent of shape .",
    "such a result of course is in agreement with the hierarchical ansatz where all higher - order parameters are assumed to become shape independent ( scoccimarro et al .",
    "1998 ) .",
    "any assumption regarding the entire hierarchy of many - body correlation functions has very strong consequences and can be used to derive properties of one - point and multi - point statistics .",
    "it is important to note that since the exact values of hierarchical coefficients are left unspecified in such an ansatz , it is only possible to talk about generic scaling properties induced by them .",
    "the void probability function ( vpf ) , which is very simple to measure from n - body data or galaxy catalogs carries information on volume averages of all orders of correlation functions .",

    "our results of analysis of vpf proves beyond doubt that the hierarchical ansatz is indeed a good approximation in the highly non - linear regime .",

    "furthermore , as the @xmath0 parameters are linear combinations of product of powers of amplitudes of different vertices that appear in the tree - level correlation hierarchy , this will also mean that these vertices too are constant in highly non - linear regime .",
    "however , we have also found a significant departure from such scaling for @xmath180 spectra .",
    "the maximum value of @xmath107 for which the vpf can be probed reliably decreases with increasing power on larger scales and the simulation grid , which remains undistorted in underdense regions for spectra with more power at larger scales even in the highly non - linear regime .",
    "these two factors may be responsible for a spurious departure from scaling in this case .",
    "strong motivation for suspecting that the apparent departure we detect in scaling for vpf for @xmath180 may not be real is that we do not detect any corresponding effect in @xmath112 .",
    "we use four neighbouring equidistant cells in a grid to evaluate the bias with respect to the central cell .",
    "we adopt two different methods to evaluate the bias which , as suggested by bernardeau ( 1994 ) , test the factorizability property of bias of over - dense cells predicted by the hierarchical ansatz . in the first method we compute the bias associated with each overdense cells with respect to background mass .",
    "this is done by casting the definition of bias in a following way : @xmath181 in the second method we directly compute the bias from correlation of two different over - dense cells : @xmath182 in both cases we compute the bias for cells whose occupancy is greater than some particular threshold @xmath131 and then we vary the threshold to study @xmath136 for different values of @xmath131 .",
    "we initially attempted to compute directly the function @xmath135 but we found measurements of the cumulative distribution @xmath136 to be much more stable .",
    "we also found that the bias computed from both methods mentioned above matches , and also the slope of the bias function for overdense cells agrees well with theoretical predictions .",
    "in particular , the bias increases with @xmath131 as a power law with the index of power - law being less than unity , whereas for highly overdense cells the bias is directly proportional to @xmath131 .",

    "for large cell separations , where all higher order terms in @xmath183 are negligible , @xmath184 we found that the scaling function @xmath185 , which encodes the scaling properties of the 2vpf and also acts as a generating function for cumulant correlator ( munshi & melott 1998 ) is described very accurately by the theoretical prediction , made on the basis of the hierarchical ansatz ; see figures 6 & 7 .",

    "the finite size of galaxy catalogues and numerical simulations always affects the determination of many - body correlation functions from real or simulated samples .",
    "the higher the order of correlation measured , the greater the contribution to it from exceptionally dense and consequently rare clumps . their determination is therefore always affected by the presence or absence of such clumps in a finite sample .",
    "this manifests itself in a sharp cutoff in all the one - point functions we have defined such as @xmath6 , @xmath88 , and @xmath186 . using the scaling arguments we have already described n it is however possible to supplement the measured quantities with the functions by @xmath112 , @xmath135 , and @xmath187 .",
    "these quantities have been computed by series expansion of multi - point vpf in increasing power of @xmath188 for second and third order by bernardeau & schaeffer ( 1992 ) and for fourth and fifth order in our paper i. using their results we show here that scaling arguments once verified at lower order in @xmath189 can be used to estimate finite volume errors for in estimates of the multi - point cumulant correlators .    if @xmath190 is the maximum occupancy of cells of certain length scales in a catalog , measured @xmath6 for @xmath191 shows an abrupt cutoff for @xmath192 .",
    "we supplement the measured @xmath6 by @xmath11 for @xmath193 to construct the corrected @xmath194 ( munshi et al .",
    "1998c ) ; @xmath11 can be expressed in terms of the scaling function @xmath112 describing @xmath6 : @xmath195 the corrected cpdf satisfies two constraint equations similar to the case of the uncorrected cpdf . the constraints @xmath196 can be used to determine the constants @xmath197 and @xmath198 where @xmath199 and @xmath200    similarly , the bias associated with overdense cells @xmath88 shows an abrupt cutoff at @xmath193 which we supplement by its continuous analogue @xmath201 , which can be expressed in terms of its scaling function @xmath135 : @xmath202 where we have denoted @xmath203 by @xmath204 . the unknown parameters @xmath205 and @xmath206 can be determined by using the fact that both @xmath207 and corrected @xmath208 satisfy similar constraints . for the zeroth moment",

    "we have also ignored a term in @xmath237 since we expect @xmath238 to be of order unity .",
    "the inclusion of terms representing loops of lower - order diagrams in the calculations will bring not only moments of @xmath216 and @xmath232 but also moments of powers of these scaling functions which we have neglected here .",
    "cumulants and cumulant correlators have been measured with presently available n - body and galaxy catalogues .",
    "although several analysis for finite volume correction for cumulants are available in the literature ( colombi et al .",
    "1992 , 1994 , 1995 , 1996 , munshi et al .",
    "1998 ) , no such analysis has been done for cumulant correlators .",
    "our analysis based on the hierarchical ansatz provides an estimate for finite volume correction and also can be used to correct such effects .",
    "implementation of our method for measurements of mccs will be presented elsewhere .",
    "it was shown by szapudi & szalay ( 1997 ) that cumulant correlators can actually be used to separate amplitudes associated with different tree topologies at low order . however , at higher orders the number of equations becomes less than the number of independent tree topologies rendering the system indeterminate .",
    "this can only be cured if we increase the number of points by using multi - point cumulant correlators .",
    "this in principle will allow us not only to determine the amplitudes associated with tree topologies of arbitrary order but also allow an additional consistency check because the number of variables is less than the number of equations they have to satisfy .",
    "of course going from two - point cumulant correlators to multi - point cumulant correlators",
    "makes numerical computation more complicated , especially because of the shape dependence of multi - point cumulant correlators for more than two points . with the availability of simulations with much larger dynamic range",
    "a determination of the @xmath76 parameters will become possible in the reasonably near future .",
    "the procedure which we have introduced here for finite volume corrections however requires _ a priori _ knowledge of the @xmath76 parameters which one needs to determine from the same sample .",
    "this calls for an iterative procedure which can be applied until the whole process becomes convergent .",
    "in this and the previous paper ( paper i ) , we have investigated properties of the multi - point cumulant correlators - the natural generalisations of the one - point cumulants and the two - point cumulant correlators .",
    "we also developed a method which can be used to determine the amplitudes associated with tree diagrams of different topologies , without making any simplistic assumptions about them .",
    "this method can be used to test any models of gravitational clustering in the highly non - linear regime , such as the hierarchical scaling ansatz .",
    "we have developed a diagrammatic method to represent the decomposition of multi - point cumulant correlators in terms of factorial moments and factorial correlators . using this approach ,",
    "we have found that every higher - order contribution to @xmath189 introduces a new function which corresponds to a new vertex in the tree - level hierarchy , labeled by @xmath239 .",
    "it was shown in paper i that these functions display similar scaling relations as the functions @xmath6 and @xmath88 .",
    "we have used these scaling relations for @xmath239 to estimate the effect of the finite size of n - body simulations or galaxy catalogues in estimates of statistical descriptors , such as cumulants , cumulant correlators and multi - point cumulant correlators .",
    "we have tested various predictions of the hierarchical ansatz , relating to one - point and two - point quantities in the highly non - linear regime , using high - resolution 2d numerical simulations .",
    "we find that the scaling functions @xmath112 and @xmath109 can describe the behaviour of the cpdf and vpf in highly non - linear regime for all length scales , as the hierarchical assumption predicts .",
    "these functions were , however , found to depend on initial conditions even in the highly nonlinear regime .",
    "as expected from general scaling arguments , it was found that @xmath109 attains a asymptotic power - law @xmath240 for large values of @xmath107 .",
    "however , such models are not able to predict the values of @xmath241 ; more detailed dynamical arguments would have to be developed to make such a prediction .",
    "numerically , however , we have found that @xmath241 depends on the form of the initial power spectrum , increasing with the relative amount of small - scale power .",
    "the index @xmath241 also enters in the description of @xmath242 which we found to have a power law profile with power law index @xmath241 and an exponential cutoff for large values @xmath131 .",
    "this transition occurs around the typical cell occupancy in overdense cells where @xmath243 , i.e. @xmath244 .    extending such studies of one - point quantities for the first time to their two - point analogues such as 2cpdf and 2vpf",
    ", we were able to check how overdense cells are biased with respect to the underlying mass distribution .",
    "we find , in accordance with hierarchical predictions , that the bias is an intrinsic property of collapsed objects .",
    "one can associate scaling variable @xmath131 with every collapsed object , which is a function of cell occupancy @xmath103 , radius of the cell , and the variance of matter distribution @xmath245 on that length scale .",
    "we also found that the bias is factorizable and for two different objects with different values of scaling parameters @xmath246 and @xmath247 and with intrinsic bias @xmath248 and @xmath249 , it is possible to express their bias with respect to each other as @xmath250 .    elsewhere in the literature , extensions of the press - schechter theory have been used to compute the bias of collapsed objects ( mo & white 1996 ) and also their higher - order one - point moments such as @xmath0 parameters ( mo et al .",
    "these are in agreement with the results we have obtained , especially those presented in paper i. however , it remains unclear whether the generalisation of this formalism to two - point quantities ( such as the ccs ) will produce accurate predictions .",
    "other works which have focussed on predicting bias and higher - order correlation functions are related to extensions of the zeldovich approximation ( lee & shandarin 1997,1998 , catelan et al .",
    "it would be a very important test of the usefulness of these , and other approximation schemes for non - linear gravitational evolution to see if they can actually reproduce the multi - point statistics of collapsed objects as well as the simple hierarchical ansatz we have discussed here .",
    "all these theoretical predictions were made in the lowest order of @xmath188 , but were found to describe simulation results even when two cells are not separated by large distances .",
    "just as the vpf is related to the generating function of the @xmath0 parameters , the 2vpf is related to the generating function of the cumulant correlators ( ccs ) . in earlier numerical studies ( munshi & melott 1998 ) we have shown that , in general , ccs",
    "are factorizable , so that @xmath251 , when two cells are separated by a large distance . such a decomposition of ccs is related to the factorization of the 2vpf which we have established in this paper , thus confirming our earlier findings . the factorization property of bias is also a direct consequence of the scaling properties we study here , so our results on the subject of bias also vindicate our earlier findings .    our numerical study was done in 2d and we plan to extend such analysis in case of 3d in near future , incorporating studies of higher - order correlations of over - dense cells .",
    "it is interesting to note that although we have demonstrated that the hierarchical ansatz ( 62 ) is a very good approximation to the behaviour of higher - order correlation functions , stable clustering is known to be violated in 2d in highly non - linear regime ( munshi et al .",
    "it is often argued that stable clustering is a necessary ingredient in the hierarchical ansatz .",
    "this appears not to be the case .",
    "we shall discuss this issue in more detail in a future paper .",
    "finite sample ( or simulation ) size known to introduce a sharp cut - off in the cpdf for @xmath252 corresponding to the density of the densest densest cell in the catalog . extending methods developed earlier ( munshi et al .",
    "1998c ) for correcting finite volume effects in the cpdf @xmath167 by supplementing the missing information beyond @xmath192 from scaling function @xmath112 ( which can then be used to compute the @xmath0 parameters ) , we developed a similar method for mcpdf in this paper .",
    "at the level of 2cpdf e.g. , one can use the scaling property of @xmath88 which is encoded in scaling function @xmath135 to correct or estimate finite volume effects in the extraction of ccs .",
    "we show that this technique can be generalised in a straightforward manner to the case of mcpdfs . at present",
    "there is no other general formalism to estimate the finite volume error for multi - point statistics .",
    "our method provides the first step in this direction .",
