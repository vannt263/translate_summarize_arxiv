    "the preparation of an intense beam of polarized antiprotons is _ the _ crucial point for the physics program proposed by the pax collaboration @xcite at the future fair facility in darmstadt .",
    "a possibility to overcome this experimental challenge is seen in elastic scattering of antiprotons off a polarized @xmath5h target @xcite .",
    "this conjecture is motivated by the result of the filtex experiment @xcite , where a sizeable effect of polarization buildup was achieved in a storage ring by scattering of unpolarized protons off polarized hydrogen atoms at low beam energies of 23 mev .",
    "recent theoretical analyses @xcite suggest that the polarization effect observed in ref .",
    "@xcite is solely due to the spin dependence of the hadronic ( proton - proton ) interaction , which gives rise to the so - called spin - filtering mechanism , i.e. leads to different rates of removal of beam protons from the ring for different polarization states of the hydrogen target .",
    "contrary to what was assumed before @xcite , proton scattering on the polarized electrons of hydrogen atoms does not provide sizeable effects for the polarization buildup @xcite .",
    "accordingly , only the hadronic interaction of antiprotons with nucleons or nuclei can be used to produce polarized antiprotons on the basis of the spin - filtering mechanism @xcite . since the spin - dependent part of the @xmath6 interaction is still poorly known experimentally , the polarization buildup mechanism in elastic scattering of stored antiprotons off a polarized @xmath5h target",
    "is planned to be studied in a new experiment at cern @xcite at intermediate energies .",
    "some theoretical estimations of the expected polarization effects were already presented , based on the amplitudes of the paris  @xcite and jlich @xcite @xmath7 potential models and the nijmegen @xcite @xmath7 partial - wave analysis .    in this context , it is important to explore other antiproton  nucleus interactions as possible source for the antiproton polarization buildup too .",
    "therefore , we present here results of a study of polarization effects in antiproton - deuteron ( @xmath8 ) scattering for beam energies up to 300 mev @xcite .",
    "besides the issue of polarization buildup for antiprotons , @xmath9 scattering on a polarized deuteron , if it will be studied experimentally , can be also used as a test for our present knowledge of the @xmath10 and @xmath4 interactions .",
    "our investigation is based on the glauber - sitenko theory for @xmath0 scattering and it utilizes the @xmath11 interaction models developed by the jlich group @xcite as input for the elementary amplitudes .",
    "considering the full spin dependence of the forward @xmath2 elastic scattering amplitude @xcite and using the optical theorem , one can show that the total polarized @xmath8 cross section can be written as @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the polarization of the antiproton beam and @xmath14 ( @xmath15 ) is the vector ( tensor ) polarization of the deuterium target , @xmath16 is the unpolarized and @xmath17 ( @xmath18 ) are the polarized total cross sections .",
    "the unit vector @xmath19 is fixed by the direction of the beam momentum .",
    "one can find from eq .",
    "( [ totalspin ] ) that only the cross sections @xmath20 and @xmath21 are connected with the spin - filtering mechanism @xcite and , thus , determine the rate of the polarization buildup in the scattering of unpolarized antiprotons off polarized deuterons .",
    "the tensor cross section @xmath22 is not related to the polarization of the beam and , therefore , is not relevant for the spin - filtering .",
    "however , this cross section , as well as the unpolarized cross section @xmath16 , determine the lifetime of the beam .    we utilize the glauber theory of multiple scattering @xcite for investigating the @xmath2 scattering process .",
    "for the elementary @xmath23 amplitudes we use those of the jlich models a and d @xcite .",
    "details on the applied formalism can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite . in order to check the reliability of this approach we calculate the unpolarized total and differential @xmath2 cross sections where we can compare our results with available experimental information .    in the evaluation of the polarized cross sections @xmath17",
    "( @xmath24 , we take into account the coulomb - nuclear interference terms , which are added to the corresponding purely hadronic cross sections",
    ". the pure coulomb amplitude does not contribute to @xmath25 , but it gives an important contribution to @xmath16 . in order to calculate the contribution of the coulomb - nuclear interference terms one can not use the optical theorem because of the coulomb singularity at the scattering angle @xmath26 , and",
    "therefore we use here the method of ref .",
    "@xcite , adapted for the case of @xmath27 scattering @xcite . for the polarized cross sections we use only the single - scattering approximation .",
    "as was shown in refs .",
    "@xcite , in forward elastic scattering of antiprotons off nuclei the glauber theory of diffractive multiple scattering , though in principle a high - energy approach , works rather well even at fairly low antiproton beam energies .",
    "the reason for this is that due to strong annihilation effects , the @xmath23 elastic differential cross section is peaked in forward direction already at rather low energies and , therefore , suitable for application of the eikonal approximation , which is the basis of the glauber theory .",
    "the elastic spin - averaged @xmath23 scattering amplitude can be parameterized as @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the total unpolarized @xmath23 cross section , @xmath30 is the ratio of the real to imaginary part of the forward amplitude @xmath31 , @xmath32 is the slope of the diffraction cone , @xmath33 is the transferred 3-momentum , and @xmath34 is the @xmath23 cms momentum .",
    "we use eq .",
    "( [ fpn ] ) to represent the scattering amplitudes of the jlich @xmath7 models in analytical form . when performing the fit we found that even at beam energies as low as 10 - 25 mev the parameter @xmath35 is large , i.e. @xmath36 ( gev / c)@xmath37 , reflecting the fact that the @xmath23 amplitude is indeed peaked in forward direction .",
    "results for the total unpolarized @xmath2 cross section are displayed in fig .",
    "[ totpd ] together with experimental information @xcite .",
    "one can see that the single - scattering approximation ( shown here for model d only ) overestimates the total unpolarized cross section by roughly 15% , cf . the dotted line .",
    "but the shadowing effect generated by @xmath23 double scattering reduces the cross section ( solid line ) and leads to a good agreement with the experiment .",
    "the results for model a ( including also double scattering ) are very similar ( dashed line ) and also in agreement with the data .",
    "predictions for differential cross sections are presented in fig .",
    "[ pbard179 ] . also here",
    "the single - scattering mechanism as well as the double - scattering terms were included in the corresponding calculation .",
    "the abb form factor @xcite is used for the deuteron . at @xmath38 = 179.3",
    "mev data for the elastic differential cross section are available @xcite .",
    "these data ( squares in fig .  [ pbard179 ] ) are nicely reproduced by our model calculation for forward angles . also the differential cross sections for elastic ( @xmath39 ) plus inelastic ( @xmath40 ) scattering events , measured at the neighboring energy of @xmath38 = 170 mev as well as at some lower energies @xcite ( circles ) ,",
    "are well described .",
    "results for the spin - dependent @xmath2 cross sections @xmath20 and @xmath21 are obtained in the single - scattering approximation and presented in fig .",
    "[ totpdx ] ( right - hand side ) .",
    "we show predictions based on the purely hadronic part , @xmath41 , as well as full results , including the coulomb - nuclear interference term , i.e. @xmath42 for @xmath43 .",
    "the @xmath7 model d predicts large values for @xmath20 around 40 mev and for @xmath21 around 25 mev . in case of model a the most pronounced spin dependence is seen at considerably higher energies .",
    "compared with the results for the @xmath44 reaction , shown on the left - hand side of fig .",
    "[ totpdx ] , the spin - dependent @xmath3 cross sections @xmath20 and @xmath21 are of similar magnitude or even larger . with regard to the purely hadronic contribution , @xmath41 ( i=1,2 ) ,",
    "the cross sections for @xmath45 and @xmath2 are , in general , of opposite sign @xcite .",
    "it should be said , however , that the sign does not affect the spin - filtering mechanism .",
    "the effect of the coulomb - nuclear interference is somewhat smaller for @xmath27 scattering than for the @xmath44 case .",
    "this difference comes from the additional @xmath46 amplitudes entering the expression for @xmath47 in case of the @xmath2 reaction , cf .",
    "@xcite for details .",
    "10.5 cm    one can see from fig .  [ totpdx ] that the largest values for the polarized @xmath2 cross sections ( and also those for @xmath45 ) are expected at very low energies , i.e. for @xmath38 less than 10 mev , where the cross sections are dominated by the coulomb - nuclear interference term .",
    "however , as was already mentioned above , at these energies the pure coulomb cross section becomes rather large , so that the method of spin - filtering for the polarization buildup can not be applied due to the decrease of the beam lifetime .",
    "acording to the analysis of the kinetics of polarization @xcite , the polarization buildup is determined mainly by the ratio of the polarized total cross sections to the unpolarized one ( @xmath16 ) @xcite .",
    "let as define the unit vector @xmath48 , where @xmath49 is the target polarization vector , which in the case of @xmath2 scattering enters eq .",
    "( [ totalspin ] ) .",
    "the non - zero antiproton beam polarization vector @xmath13 , produced by the polarization buildup , is collinear to the vector @xmath50 for any directions of @xmath51 and can be calculated from consideration of the kinetics of polarization .",
    "the general solution for the kinetic equation for @xmath45 scattering is given in ref .",
    "here we assume that this solution is valid for the @xmath2 scattering also .",
    "therefore , for the spin - filtering mechanism of the polarization buildup the polarization degree at the time @xmath52 is given by @xcite @xmath53 , \\label{pdeg}\\ ] ] where @xmath54\\right \\}. \\label{omega}\\ ] ] here @xmath55 is the areal density of the target and @xmath56 is the beam revolving frequency .",
    "one should note that the tensor cross section @xmath22 from eq .",
    "( [ totalspin ] ) does not contribute to @xmath57 .",
    "assuming the condition @xmath58 ) , which was found in refs .",
    "@xcite for the @xmath45 scattering in rings at @xmath59 @xmath60 and @xmath61 c@xmath62 , one can simplify eq .",
    "( [ pdeg ] ) .",
    "if one denotes the number of antiprotons in the beam at the time moment @xmath52 as @xmath63 , then the figure of merit ( fom ) is @xmath64 .",
    "this value is maximal at the moment @xmath65 , where @xmath66 is the beam life time , which is determined by the total cross section @xmath16 of the interaction of the antiprotons with the deuteron target as @xmath67 to estimate the efficiency of the polarization buildup mechanism it is instructive to calculate the polarization degree @xmath68 at the time @xmath69 @xcite . in our definition for @xmath20 and @xmath21 , which differ from that in refs .",
    "@xcite , we find @xmath70    the polarization degree @xmath71 for @xmath72 ( @xmath73 ) at @xmath74 is shown in fig .",
    "[ poldeg2 ] versus the beam energy . for the ease of comparison the polarization degree for the @xmath45 and",
    "@xmath75 cases are shown too .",
    "the results for @xmath76 ( @xmath77 ) are shown in fig .",
    "[ poldeg1 ] .",
    "10.5 cm    10.5 cm    one can see that , except for the @xmath78 case , at energies below 100 mev the polarization degree is small due to large total coulomb cross section .",
    "however , @xmath71 increases with increasing energy . for longitudinal polarization",
    "maximal values of about 10 - 15% are predicted above 150 mev .",
    "the transversal polarization degree is smaller than the longitudinal one for both models a and d. for the @xmath2 case the transversal polarization is expected to be larger than for @xmath45 , having a maximum of around @xmath79% at 150 -250 mev ( see fig .  [ poldeg1 ] ) .",
    "the obtained values for the polarization degree are somewhat smaller than those presented in @xcite , based on the amplitudes of the nijmegen @xmath7 analysis @xcite .",
    "experiments for determining the spin - dependent part of the cross sections of the @xmath80 and @xmath2 scattering are planned for the near future @xcite .",
    "such data should allow one to discriminate between the different @xmath7 amplitudes @xcite .",
    "in this work we have used two @xmath7 potential models developed by the jlich group for a calculation of @xmath2 scattering within the glauber theory and found that this approach allows one to describe the experimental information on ( unpolarized ) differential and total @xmath2 cross sections , available at @xmath81 mev , quantitatively . for those spin - independent",
    "observables the difference in the predictions based on those two models turned out to be rather small .",
    "the double - scattering corrections to the unpolarized cross section were found to be in the order of 15% in the energy range where the data are available .",
    "but we found that even at such low energies as 10 - 25 mev they are not larger than 20 - 25% .",
    "this means that , most likely , the glauber approximation does work reasonably well for @xmath2 scattering down to fairly small energies .    the predictions for the spin - dependent cross sections for @xmath2 scattering , presented in this work , exhibit a fairly strong model dependence , which is due to uncertainties in the spin dependence of the elementary @xmath45 and @xmath46 interactions .",
    "still , for both considered models we find that the magnitude of the spin - dependent cross sections is comparable or even larger than those for @xmath45 .",
    "thus , our results suggest that @xmath2 elastic scattering can be used for the polarization buildup of antiprotons at beam energies of 100 - 300 mev with similar and possibly even higher efficiency than @xmath45 scattering .",
    "however , it is obvious , that only concrete experimental data on the spin - dependent part of the cross sections of @xmath80 and @xmath2 scattering will allow one to confirm or disprove the feasibility of the spin filtering mechanism for the polarization buildup .",
    "this work was supported in part by the heisenberg - landau program .",
