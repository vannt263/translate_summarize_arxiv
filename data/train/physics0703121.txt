    "accurate calculations for many - electron atoms play an important role in many advanced topics of modern physics .",
    "this includes parity and time invariance violating phenomena in atoms  @xcite , search for manifestation of possible variation of fundamental constants in astrophysical data  @xcite , or in present - day laboratory experiments  @xcite , improving accuracy of atomic clocks  @xcite , study of super - heavy elements ( see , e.g.  @xcite ) , etc .",
    "calculations are needed for planning of experiments and interpretation of the results .",
    "atoms of the most interest for the listed topics are usually found in the second part of the periodic table where measurements or observations are more likely to give useful information due to strong enhancement of the effects caused by interplay between relativistic and many - body effects . on the other hand ,",
    "accurate treatment of relativistic and many - body effects represent a big challenge for atomic calculations . not surprisingly , the number of methods capable of producing reliable and accurate results is very limited .",
    "the most advanced methods have been developed for atoms with one external electron above closed shells .",
    "for example , most accurate calculations of the parity non - conservation in cesium where carried out with two most advanced methods .",
    "one was the correlation potential ( cp ) method  @xcite combined with the all - order perturbation theory in screened coulomb interaction  @xcite and the other was the linearized coupled cluster approach  @xcite . with these two methods , energy levels and transition amplitudes for alkali atoms can be calculated to the accuracy of fraction of percent while hyperfine structure and parity violating amplitudes are calculated to the accuracy of 0.5 - 1%  @xcite .    for atoms with more than one external electron in open shells",
    "the accuracy of calculations is significantly lower .",
    "for example , the best accuracy achieved for pnc in tl is around 3% ( 3% in ref .",
    "@xcite and 2.5% in ref .",
    "typical accuracy for energies is about 1% or worse .",
    "the main challenge is the need for accurate treatment of both core - valence and valence - valence correlations .",
    "the most commonly used methods can be divided in several main groups : ( a ) many - body perturbation theory ( mbpt ) ( see , e.g.  @xcite ) , ( b ) coupled cluster approach ( cc ) ( see , e.g.  @xcite ) , ( c ) configuration interaction ( ci ) ( see , e.g.  @xcite ) , and ( d ) multi - configuration dirac - fock method ( mcdf)(see , e.q .",
    "there are also combinations of these basic techniques .",
    "all of these method have their limitations .",
    "for example , ci usually treats correlations between valence electrons very accurately but core - valence correlations are either totally neglected or only small fraction of them is included .",
    "mbpt can include more core - valence correlations , but its application to the correlations between valence electrons is limited by the fact that these correlations are often too strong to be treated perturbatively .",
    "the cc approach includes certain types of core - valence and valence - valence correlations in all - orders and in principle can be formulated for any number of valence electrons .",
    "however , the equations are complicated and most of practical realization of the method deal with only one or two electrons ( or an electron and a hole ) .",
    "significant progress can be achieved by combining different techniques . in 1996",
    "we developed a method which combines the mbpt with the ci method ( ci+mbpt )  @xcite . here",
    ", the second - order mbpt was used to construct the effective hamiltonian in the valence space which includes the core - valence correlations .",
    "it differs from the standard ci hamiltonian by an extra correlation operator @xmath9 which accounts for the core - valence correlations .",
    "single - electron part of this operator is very similar to the correlation potential used for atoms with one external electron  @xcite .",
    "it was demonstrated that inclusion of the core - valence correlations lead to a significant improvement of the accuracy of calculations ( see , e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "savukov and co - workers  @xcite developed a version of the method which uses the hole - particle formalism .",
    "they applied the technique for a calculation of the electron structure of the noble - gas atoms  @xcite .",
    "the ci+mbpt method was successfully used for a number of atoms with two or three valence electrons  @xcite ( or an electron and a hole  @xcite ) .",
    "its extension to atoms with more electrons in open shells meets some difficulties .",
    "it turns out that convergence of the mbpt varies very much from atom to atom and strongly depends on an initial approximation .",
    "the core - valence correlations are often too large if treated in the same fashion as in our original works and their inclusion does not improve the results .",
    "it is widely accepted that the hartree - fock potential is the best choice as a zero approximation for consequent use of the mbpt due to great reduction of the terms caused by exact cancellation between the potential and electron - electron coulomb terms . however , for atoms with open shells hf procedure is not defined unambiguously .",
    "this is especially true when the ci method is to be used .",
    "here we have freedom of how many electrons are to be included into the initial hf procedure and how many electrons are to be treated as valence electrons in the ci calculations .",
    "it was found in our previous work  @xcite that for a wide range of atoms the best choice is the so - called @xmath2 approximation .",
    "these are the atoms in which valence electrons form a separate shell , defined by the same principal quantum number .",
    "for example , the ground state configuration of xenon is [ pd]@xmath10 .",
    "its eight outermost electrons have @xmath11 while all other electrons have @xmath12 .",
    "this means that eight outermost electrons should be treated as valence electrons and the initial hf procedure should not include them .",
    "this greatly simplifies the mbpt , improves its convergence and allows one to include higher - order correlations in the same way as it was done for atoms with one external electron .",
    "the aim of the present work is to develop a solid theoretical background for use of the @xmath2 potential as a starting point . in principle , this starting point is equivalent to any other choice of the initial hf potential . indeed , the actual role of the _ subtraction diagrams _ in the correlation operators @xmath9 is to reduce results obtained with any zero approximation to @xmath2 results ( see an explanation below ) .",
    "however , the technique for @xmath2 is much simpler ( no subtraction diagrams ) and allows us to sum dominating chains of higher order diagrams to all orders ( it is practically impossible for other choice of zero approximation ) .",
    "this results in a higher accuracy .",
    "another advance of the present work is the use of a compact basis for valence states . in our previous works",
    "@xcite we used the same basis to calculate @xmath9 and to do the ci calculations .",
    "the basis was formed from the eigenstates of the @xmath13 potential .",
    "this had an advantage of having the same single- and double - electron matrix elements for all ions of the same atom . moving from ion to ion was easy , requiring only change the number of electrons in the ci calculations . however , convergence of the ci calculations rapidly deteriorated with growing number of electrons .",
    "when number of electrons became as large as eight , saturation of the basis was very hard to achieve unless huge computer resources were used .",
    "in present work we demonstrate that the basis states for valence electrons do nt have to be eigenstates of the @xmath13 potential . instead , hf states calculated in the mean field of all electrons ( of a neutral atom or corresponding positive ion )",
    "can be used after minor modifications . in this case",
    "we have to recalculate the ci basis when we change the number of valence electrons @xmath0 .",
    "however , the gain is much larger . since hf states are already good approximations to the wave functions of valence electrons we can limit the basis to just few states in each partial wave",
    "therefore , even for eight valence electrons the ci matrix is small , its calculation and diagonalization takes little time but the final results are very accurate .    we calculate energy levels and land @xmath14-factors for neutral xenon and all its positive ions from x  ii to xe  viii for illustration on how the technique works . good agreement with experiment",
    "is demonstrated for all cases while very little computer resources are needed on every stage of the calculations .",
    "the effective hamiltonian of the ci method has the form ( see , e.g.  @xcite ) @xmath15 summation goes over valence electrons , @xmath16 is the one - electron part of the hamiltonian @xmath17 @xmath18 and @xmath19 are the dirac matrices , @xmath20 is the nuclear charge and @xmath21 is the electrostatic potential created by the core electrons .",
    "regardless of initial approximation used to calculate core and valence states , the valence electrons never contribute to @xmath21 directly .",
    "they can only contribute to @xmath21 via the self - consistent hf procedure or via any other potential used to represent valence electrons .",
    "if the core electrons and valence electrons belong to different shells the effect of the valence electrons on electron states in the core and thus on @xmath21 can be extremely small .",
    "indeed , in this case the overlap between density of the valence electrons and density of the core electrons is small .",
    "therefore , the exchange interaction between the core and valence electrons , which is proportional to the overlap , is negligible in comparison with energy of the core electrons . on the other hand ,",
    "the direct potential created by the valence electrons is practically constant inside the core since nearly all charge of the valence electrons is located outside the core .",
    "constant potential corresponds to zero electric field and can not have any effect on the wave function of the core electrons .",
    "the only effect of the constant potential @xmath22 is in energy shift @xmath23 .",
    "however , it does not change the single - particle wave functions and green s functions of core electrons since the wave equation contains the difference @xmath24 which does not change .",
    "we may formulate this conclusion using the perturbation theory . in first order in @xmath22 a core state @xmath25 in the @xmath2 approximation and @xmath26 in the @xmath27 approximation",
    "are related by @xmath28 if the potential @xmath22 is constant , the matrix element @xmath29 due to the orthogonality condition .",
    "this explains why the changes of the core wave functions , density and potential are very small .",
    "small overlap between the core and valence states usually takes place when these states correspond to different atomic shells defined by the principal quantum number ( see , e.g.  @xcite ) . in case of xenon , eight outermost electrons have principal quantum number @xmath11 ( the @xmath10 ground state configuration ) , while all core electrons have @xmath12 .",
    "therefore , if the eight electrons are considered to be valence electrons we should expect that they have little effect on the core states .",
    "[ xe - fig ] shows electron densities of xe  i and xe  ix calculated in the hf approximation . for the neutral xe  i electron densities of valence and core",
    "electrons are shown separately .",
    "one can see that the overlap between them is indeed very small .",
    "therefore , it turns out that when electron density of xe  ix is calculated it practically coincides with the electron density of the core states of neutral xe .",
    "the former is shown by dots of fig .",
    "[ xe - fig ] .",
    "resolution of this figure does nt allow us to see any difference between electron densities of xe  ix and the core of xe  i. this is in spite of huge difference in energies of core states of two atoms .",
    "one may argue that huge difference in energies should lead to a noticeable difference in wave functions , at least on large distances .",
    "indeed , a wave function of an atomic electron has asymptotic defined by its energy and potential @xmath30 however , in the area up to the radius of the valence shell there is actually no difference in @xmath31 for the core orbitals in xe  ix and xe  i since @xmath32 .",
    "the difference in asymptotic behavior appears only near the radius of the valence shell where the core electron density is extremely small .",
    "thus we conclude that the core electron density and potential have practically no dependence on the number of valence electrons if the valence electrons are in a different shell .",
    "the use of the feynman diagram technique allows us to express the core - valence correlation corrections in terms of the single - particle wave functions and green s functions @xcite ( see appendix ) .",
    "therefore , all the arguments presented above are applicable when we consider calculation of the correlation operators @xmath33 and @xmath34 ; they may be calculated using @xmath2 basis for core electrons",
    ".    it may be instructive to clarify this conclusion using more popular schroedinger perturbation theory where explicit summation over intermediate states is involved .",
    "the correlations between the valence and core electrons as well as the screening of the interaction between the valence electrons happen inside the area occupied by the core electrons .",
    "let us enclose the core by a sphere with zero boundary condition for the core electrons .",
    "this allows us to reduce the core electron problem to the discrete spectrum .",
    "let us now consider the interaction of the core electrons with external electrons using the perturbation theory .",
    "the constant potential @xmath22 of external electrons does not change the core electron wave functions .",
    "it also does not change the energy differences @xmath35 between the enclosed `` core''states , they are shifted by the same energy @xmath22 ( note that these enclosed states form complete basis set inside the sphere ) .",
    "therefore , all the terms in the perturbation theory for the core - valence interaction ( beyond the mean field which we take into account in the @xmath27 valence orbitals ) do not depend on the spectator valence electrons .",
    "this is why we can calculate all core - valence correlations using the @xmath2 core orbitals . to avoid misunderstanding",
    "we should note that we use this picture for the explanation only , no special boundary conditions for core electrons are needed for actual calculations ( it is obvious if we use the green s function technique ; all the integrals over coordinates are dominated by the core area where the correlations between the valence and core electrons actually happen ) .",
    "note that below we do not neglect effects of @xmath22 , we only treat them as a perturbation since the non - diagonal matrix elements @xmath36 are small .",
    "the effective hamiltonian of the ci+mbpt method has the form similar to ( [ heff ] ) but with extra terms for single and double electron parts of it .",
    "these terms , for which we use notation @xmath9 , describe the core - valence correlations @xcite .",
    "there is a single - electron operator @xmath33 which is added to the single - electron part @xmath37 ( [ h1 ] ) of the ci hamiltonian : @xmath38 @xmath33 describes correlations between a particular valence electron and core electrons .",
    "it is very similar to the correlation potential @xmath9 used for atoms with one external electron ( see , e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "there is also a two - electron operator @xmath34 which modifies coulomb interaction between valence electrons : @xmath39 physical interpretation of @xmath34 is the screening of coulomb interaction between valence electrons by core electrons .    when number of valence electrons is greater than 2 there is also a three - body operator @xmath40 @xcite and higher - order many - body operators @xmath41 , @xmath42 , etc . .",
    "however , they are usually very small and we will not consider them in the present work .    the full set of diagrams for @xmath43 and @xmath34 in the second order of mbpt is presented on figs .",
    "[ sigma1-fig ] , [ sigma1sub - fig ] , [ sigma2-fig ] and [ sigma2sub - fig ] .",
    "it contains the so - called _ subtraction _ diagrams which are proportional to @xmath44 , where @xmath21 is the potential of the core electrons as in the effective ci hamiltonian ( [ heff ] ) , @xmath45 is the potential in which states of the core were calculated .",
    "note that subtraction diagrams vanish in the @xmath2 approximation : @xmath46 .",
    "the origin of the subtraction diagrams is clear from the definition of the perturbation ( residual interaction ) operator @xmath47 where @xmath48 is the exact hamiltonian and @xmath49 is the zero approximation hamiltonian .",
    "if the field of external electrons is included in @xmath49 it produces additional contributions which we call the subtraction diagrams .",
    "thus , the potential @xmath22 appears with positive sign in the mean field ( and core wave functions ) , and with negative sign in the residual interaction ( and subtraction diagrams ) .",
    "if we calculate all correlations exactly , to all orders , @xmath22 must disappear in the final result .",
    "in any finite order of the many - body perturbation theory there are only partial cancellations ; lower orders of expansion in @xmath22 are canceled out .",
    "thus , the role of the subtraction diagrams is to cancel the potential of spectator valence electrons acting on the core electrons ( effect of valence electrons on the core lines of the diagrams ) . in other words ,",
    "the subtraction diagrams guarantee that in any given order of expansion in @xmath22 the operators @xmath7 and @xmath34 are reduced to the results of @xmath2 approximation . therefore ,",
    "if the non - diagonal matrix elements of @xmath22 are small the @xmath2 approximation is the best zero approximation since the calculations are much simpler ( no subtraction diagrams ) .",
    "it is easy to see all these cancellations of @xmath22 explicitly , order by order in @xmath22 .",
    "here one should remember that change of the valence electron energies due to change of the core hartree - fock potential ( which formally has the first order in the coulomb interaction ) is actually canceled by the second order subtraction diagrams ; contribution of @xmath22 into the core wave functions in the second order diagrams is canceled by the third order subtraction diagrams , etc .",
    "we have seen above that if the electrostatic potential @xmath22 created by valence electrons is nearly constant inside the core then the @xmath2 approximation is equivalent to the @xmath50 approximation , where @xmath22 can have contributions from all @xmath0 valence electrons , or any fraction on them or it can be just a model potential .",
    "the only condition is that @xmath22 is nearly constant inside the core .",
    "this means that without any compromise on accuracy we can do the calculation in the @xmath2 approximation which is technically more simple .",
    "another advantage of using @xmath2 is that we have the same effective hamiltonian for any number of valence electrons from 1 to @xmath0 .",
    "therefore we can do the calculations in a very similar way for all corresponding ions as well as for a neutral atom .",
    "eliminating subtracting diagrams in the @xmath2 approximation makes @xmath43 practically identical to the correlation potential @xmath9 used for atoms with one external electron .",
    "therefore , we can try to improve the accuracy of calculations by including important higher order terms into @xmath43 the same way as it was done in a number of calculations for alkali atoms ( see , e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "we include two dominating classes of higher order diagrams into calculation of @xmath33 .",
    "one is screening of the coulomb interaction between valence and core electrons by other core electrons .",
    "another is interaction between an electron excited from the core and a hole in the core created by this excitation . both classes of diagrams are included in all orders ( see , e.g.  @xcite for details ) .",
    ".removal energies of lowest states of xe  viii ( @xmath51 ) in different approximations ; comparison with experiment [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]      an interesting question is whether method presented in this paper can be used to calculated states of a negative ion . at first glance",
    "the answer is _ no _ because we use @xmath27 states for the basis and negative ions are not bound in the @xmath27 approximation .",
    "however , we may consider the following question : what is going to happen if we add one more electron to the ci calculations for a neutral atom , when basis corresponds to the neutral atom ?    for atoms like xenon , which do nt form negative ions , it makes more sense to consider more general question : can a basis calculated for a system of @xmath52 valence electrons be used to calculate many electron states of a system of @xmath53 electrons ? this can be easily checked .",
    "take , for example , the xe  iv ion and add one more electron in the ci calculations to get the states of xe  iii .",
    "we ve done this without adding any new states into the basis .",
    "results are presented in the last column of table  [ xeiii ] .",
    "we can see that the results for the ion with the basis of the other ion are almost as good as with its own basis .",
    "accuracy is a bit lower which is a natural consequence of the worsening of the basis . adding more states to the basis",
    "would most certainly improve the results .",
    "this findings are not very surprising since we know that any basis set can be used in the ci calculations . for example , in ref .",
    "@xcite calculations for neutral kr were performed with the basis corresponding to kr  ix ! the only question is how many states we need to include to get reasonable results .",
    "it turns out that at least in the case of just one more electron there is no need to greatly increase the basis .",
    "this means that we can also calculate states of negative ions by using basis states of a neutral atom .",
    "in this paper we present a method of calculation for many - electron atoms with open shells which is both accurate and very efficient .",
    "the method is based on the so called @xmath2 approximation in which calculations start from the highly charged ion with all valence electrons removed .",
    "high accuracy is achieved by inclusion of core - valence correlations by means of mbpt . dominating chains of higher order diagrams",
    "are included in all orders .",
    "high efficiency of the method is mostly due to the compact @xmath27 basis set for the states of valence electrons .",
    "the method is expected to work well for atoms in which valence electrons form a separate shell ( defined by the principal quantum number ) .",
    "this is usually the case if valence electrons in the atomic ground state occupy @xmath54 and/or @xmath55 states .",
    "this covers roughly half of the periodic table of elements .",
    "calculations for xenon and its ions illustrate the use of the method .",
    "the work was funded in part by the australian research council .",
    "the correlation correction operator @xmath33 is defined in such are way that its overage value over a wave function of a valence electron is the correlation correction to the energy of this electron : @xmath56 we use the following form of the single - electron wave function @xmath57 then the expression ( [ sigma1def ] ) becomes @xmath58 note factors @xmath59 and @xmath60 in all terms except the first one .",
    "these factors make corresponding contributions to be very small .",
    "therefore we do nt usually include them .",
    "only @xmath61 will be considered in this appendix and we will omit the indexes .          the coulomb @xmath62-function is defined as @xmath64 where @xmath65 and @xmath66 .",
    "we will also need a @xmath67 function : @xmath68 our typical coordinate grid consists of about 1000 points .",
    "usually all of them are used to calculate @xmath62-functions ( [ yknm ] ) .",
    "however , there is no need to keep all points for the @xmath62 and @xmath67-functions for consequent calculations .",
    "it turns out that very little lose of accuracy is caused by the use of a subset of points defined as every 4th point in the interval @xmath69 by cutting off the point on short and large distances and using only every 4th point in between we reduce the number of points by an order of magnitude .",
    "then , coulomb integrals are calculated in an extremely efficient way @xmath70 here @xmath71 is number of points on the sub - grid and @xmath72 are weight coefficients corresponding to a particular method of numerical integration .",
    "note that only one of two integrations for coulomb integrals is done on a reduced sub - grid .",
    "first integration ( [ yknm ] ) is done with the use of all points .",
    "an expressions for @xmath73 via @xmath62-functions is @xmath74 here @xmath75 , @xmath76 , @xmath77 , @xmath78 are angular coefficients .",
    "expressions for them can be found elsewhere  @xcite",
    ". formulas ( [ s1]),([s2]),([s3]),([s4 ] ) , correspond to diagrams 1,2,3,4 on fig .",
    "[ sigma1-fig ] .",
    "@xmath33 is a matrix of size @xmath71 in coordinate space .",
    "matrix elements of @xmath33 are calculated by @xmath79 note that we use a two - step procedure to calculate matrix elements of @xmath33 .",
    "first , @xmath33 matrix which is independent on valence functions is calculated , then matrix elements of @xmath33 are calculated . to use the same approach for @xmath34",
    "is impractical . as can be seen from fig .",
    "[ sigma2-fig ] to make @xmath34 independent on valence states one would have to make matrices of dimensions 2 , 3 and 4 .",

    "<S> we present an efficient method of inclusion of the core - valence correlations into the configuration interaction ( ci ) calculations . </S>",
    "<S> these correlations take place in the core area where the potential of external electrons is approximately constant . a constant potential does not change the core electron wave functions and green s functions . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , all operators describing interaction of @xmath0 valence electrons and @xmath1 core electrons ( the core part of the hartree - fock hamiltonian @xmath2 , the correlation potential @xmath3 and the screening of interaction between valence electrons by the core electrons @xmath4 ) may be calculated with all @xmath0 valence electrons removed . </S>",
    "<S> this allows one to avoid subtraction diagrams which make accurate inclusion of the core - valence correlations for @xmath5 prohibitively complicated . </S>",
    "<S> then the ci hamiltonian for @xmath0 valence electrons is calculated using orbitals in complete @xmath6 potential ( the mean field produced by all electrons ) ; @xmath7 + @xmath4 are added to the ci hamiltonian to account for the core - valence correlations . </S>",
    "<S> we calculate @xmath7 and @xmath4 using many - body perturbation theory in which dominating classes of diagrams are included in all orders . </S>",
    "<S> we use neutral xe  i and all positive ions up to xe  viii as a testing ground . </S>",
    "<S> we found that the core electron density for all these systems is practically the same . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , we use the same @xmath7 and @xmath4 to build the ci hamiltonian in all these systems ( @xmath8 ) . </S>",
    "<S> good agreement with experiment for energy levels and land factors is demonstrated for all cases from xe  i to xe  viii . </S>"
