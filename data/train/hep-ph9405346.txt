    "because of the large energy which is released , the decay of a heavy quark is essentially a short distance process . this simple observation has led to much recent progress in the calculation of the inclusive decays of hadrons containing a heavy quark @xcite .",
    "the method relies on the construction of a systematic expansion in the inverse of the energy release , given approximately by the heavy quark mass , and hence works most reliably in the bottom system .",
    "in fact , it is expected that certain features of inclusive bottom hadron decays may be reliably predicted with the accuracy of a few percent .",
    "considerable attention has been paid to inclusive semileptonic @xcite and rare @xcite @xmath0 decays , both to total rates and to lepton and photon energy spectra .",
    "there is little controversy that these calculations rest on a firm theoretical foundation .",
    "however , it has been suggested to extend these methods to include nonleptonic decays as well @xcite .",
    "this proposal has led to an intriguing conflict with experiment , as the predicted nonleptonic widths differ significantly from those which may be extracted from the measured semileptonic branching ratio of the @xmath0 meson @xcite . in this calculation",

    "@xcite to the conclusion that it would be unnatural to find the source of the discrepancy in uncalculated terms of higher dimension or higher order in @xmath3 .",
    "it is the purpose of this article to reconsider this problem , in particular the assumptions on which the computation is based . in section  ii , we review the techniques used to treat inclusive decay rates , with an eye to emphasizing the differences between the theoretical foundations underlying the calculations of semileptonic and nonleptonic decays . in section",
    "iii , we discuss the possible discrepancy between theory and experiment in the @xmath0 semileptonic branching ratio .",
    "this might be resolved by an unusually small value for @xmath1 , or might involve the failure of the key assumption , `` local duality '' , underlying the calculation of the nonleptonic rate . in either case",

    "[ vdotqfig]a , we have already included only the imaginary part of @xmath31 by integrating over the top of the cut and then back underneath it . in general , @xmath31 along the physical cut will depend on @xmath25 in a complicated nonperturbative way .",
    "we do not necessarily know how to compute in qcd in the physical region where there are threshold effects .",

    "is such a calculation necessarily valid . however ,",
    "this is enough to allow us to compute reliably certain smooth integrals of @xmath31 by deforming the contour of integration into the unphysical region . that we can compute integrals of @xmath31 in perturbation theory in this way",
    "is the property of `` global duality '' .",
    "unfortunately , the contour in fig .  [ vdotqfig ] must still approach the physical cut near the endpoints of the integration .",
    "this introduces an uncertainty into the calculation which can not be avoided .",
    "still , one has two arguments that this uncertainty is likely to be small .",
    "first , for large @xmath21 , the portion of the contour which is within @xmath39 of the physical cut scales as @xmath40 and thus makes a small contribution to the total integral .",
    "second , if the energy release into the intermediate hadronic system is large compared to @xmath39 , it is reasonable to expect that @xmath31 will be well approximated by perturbative qcd even in the physical region .",
    "this is because in this region the cut is dominated by multiparticle states , and hence the strength of the imaginary part of @xmath31 is a relatively smooth function of the energy .",
    "while new thresholds associated with the production of additional pions are found along the cut even in this region , their effect is small compared to the smooth background of states to which they are being added .",
    "this intuition , that for large enough energies one may perform the operator product expansion directly in the physical region , is `` local duality '' .",
    "while it is a reasonable property for qcd to have , it is obviously a stronger assumption than that of global duality .",
    "in particular , it can not be justified by analytic continuation into the complex plane .",
    "rather , it rests on one s sense of how qcd ought to behave at high energies .",
    "it is clear , as well , that the energy at which local duality takes effect will depend on the operators which appear in the time - ordered product .",
    "hence the fact that local duality appears to work at a given energy in one process , such as in electron - positron annihilation into hadrons , may be suggestive but does not prove that it should hold at the same energy in another process .    to compute the inclusive semileptonic decay rate ,",
    "then , one may use global duality except in a region along the contour of order @xmath40 , where one must approach the physical cut . in this small region",
    "one must resort to local duality to justify the operator product expansion .",
    "let us now turn to inclusive nonleptonic decays .",
    "here there is no analogue of the factorization ( [ factorize ] ) which we had in the semileptonic case . hence there is no `` external '' momentum @xmath41 in which one may deform the contour away from the physical region , leaving one unable to use global duality in the transition to perturbative qcd . in this case , one is forced to invoke local duality from the outset if one is to argue that the the time - ordered product @xmath31 is computable .",
    "this clearly puts the calculation of inclusive nonleptonic @xmath0 decays on a less secure theoretical foundation than that of inclusive semileptonic @xmath0 decays .",
    "nonetheless , we do not mean to assert that the assumption of local duality in nonleptonic decays is inherently unreasonable , merely that it is the least reliable aspect of the computation .",
    "in fact , it is not entirely clear what it is reasonable to expect in this case . on the one hand ,",
    "the energy released when a @xmath5 quark decays is certainly large compared to @xmath39 .",
    "on the other , the decay is initially into three strongly interacting particles ( rather than into only one for semileptonic decays ) , and the energy per strongly interacting particle is not really so large .",
    "( note that in the semileptonic case , the point at which the contour approaches the cut and local duality must be invoked is conveniently the point of _ maximum _ recoil of the final state quark , where local duality is expected to work best . )",
    "what we propose is that the comparison of the nonleptonic decay rate , as computed via the operator product expansion , with experiment be taken as a direct test of local duality in this process . as such",
    ", it is a probe of a property of qcd in an interesting kinematic region , and nonleptonic @xmath0 decay well deserves the intense scrutiny which it has recently been accorded .",
    "the experimental implications of inclusive nonleptonic decays of @xmath0 mesons have recently been discussed in great detail by bigi , blok , shifman and vainshtein @xcite .",
    "since the semileptonic branching ratio of the @xmath0 is relatively well - measured , they use their calculation of the nonleptonic decay rate to predict this quantity .",
    "their conclusion is that the semileptonic branching ratio which comes out of their computation is unacceptably high , corresponding to a nonleptonic width which is too low by at least @xmath42-@xmath43 . in this section",
    "we will reconsider their analysis .",
    "the inclusive decay rate of the @xmath0 meson may be divided into parts based on the flavor quantum numbers of the final state , @xmath44 here we neglect rare processes , such as those mediated by an underlying @xmath45 transition or penguin - induced decays . by @xmath46 and @xmath47",
    "we mean the approximate flavor eigenstates @xmath48 , @xmath49 which couple to @xmath50 and @xmath51 , respectively , and we ignore the effect of the strange quark mass .",

    "this can barely be achieved in the theoretical expressions we have given .",
    "if we vary @xmath136 , as suggested above , then @xmath137 . estimating the radiative corrections as before , with @xmath138 , this suggests the upper limit @xmath139 , or @xmath140 .",
    "this is in agreement with experiment , but on the other hand , it requires us to push all the freedom in the calculation in the same direction , perhaps further than is reasonable . if one were to take the point of view that @xmath141 were the lowest reasonable value for @xmath111 , then one would have the constraints @xmath142 , @xmath143 and @xmath144 .",
    "if one were further to require @xmath145 , one would have @xmath146 and @xmath147 . in this case",
    ", one might consider the discrepancy with experiment to be a more serious issue .",
    "another possibility is that the relevant scale for the radiative corrections in the decay to two charm quarks is considerably lower than that for the final state with a single charm .",
    "since the rest masses of the two charm quarks absorb approximately 60% of the energy available in the decay , the strongly interacting particles are not emitted with very large momenta .",
    "for example , the average energy of the strange quark in the decay @xmath148 , computed at tree level , is only about @xmath149 .",
    "with such a low energy the procedure of estimating the value of higher order qcd corrections by varying the subtraction point @xmath111 is of dubious value .",
    "in fact one might question whether any finite order of perturbation theory is adequate and whether threshold effects that cause a violation of local duality are important .",
    "it is evident from this discussion that nothing is particularly clear .",
    "although the data on inclusive nonleptonic decays can almost be accounted for by squeezing the input parameters , one might feel a little nervous about the necessity of such a conspiracy .",
    "after all , as mentioned earlier the `` reasonable '' values @xmath95 , @xmath96 and @xmath150 lead to @xmath151 and @xmath152 , far short of the mark .",
    "an enhancement of approximately @xmath153 in the nonleptonic rate is called for .",
    "if one were to require this effect to be found entirely in @xmath65 , it would amount to more than a factor of two . while we are less inclined than the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite to insist that something is amiss , it is nonetheless intriguing to consider the possibility that the data indicate an enhancement of the nonleptonic rate over and above what we have included in the operator product expansion . where might such an enhancement come from ?",
    "the simplest explanation would be that due to a failure of local duality , the inclusive nonleptonic decay rate is simply not calculable to better than @xmath153 or so .",
    "this is certainly a discouraging explanation , in that if it were true then there would be very little one could say in detail about why local duality , and hence the calculation , had failed .",
    "one was simply unlucky .",
    "on the other hand , this explanation may well be correct . while we expect local duality to hold in the asymptotic limit of infinte @xmath5 quark mass , we have little to guide us in estimating how heavy the @xmath5 quark actually needs to be in practical terms .",
    "in particular , it is not relevant to consider , at low orders in qcd perturbation theory , the size of a few subleading terms which appear in the operator product expansion itself .",
    "the matrix elements which appear in this expansion are sensitive to details of the @xmath0 meson bound state , but they are explicitly not sensitive to resonance effects in the final hadronic state .",
    "if local duality fails , it could well fail differently in the @xmath67 and @xmath68 channels .",
    "in fact , we would expect it to fail worse in the channel with two charm quarks , since we expect the final states to be characterized by lower particle multiplicity and be closer to the resonance - dominated regime .",
    "local duality , by contrast , is applicable only in the regime where the effect of individual resonance thresholds is small compared to the almost smooth `` continuum '' of multiparticle states .",
    "on the other hand , the phase space suppression from the two final state charm quarks means that unless @xmath1 is unusually small , only thirty percent or so of the inclusive nonleptonic rate comes from the @xmath68 channel .",
    "hence , to account for an enhancement of the full nonleptonic rate by forty percent purely from @xmath154 would require a dramatic failure of local duality in this channel .",
    "either through a failure of local duality , or from an unusually small value for @xmath1 , or because of a combination of these effects , the value of @xmath65 is likely to be near unity in order to account for the measured @xmath0 semileptonic branching ratio .",
    "this corresponds to about one - third of @xmath0 decays arising from the @xmath156 process .",
    "one consequence of this is a large number of charmed quarks per @xmath0 decay , @xmath157 we remind the reader that we have adopted the notation that a generic @xmath0 meson contains a @xmath5 quark , rather than a @xmath10 quark . using @xmath158 and @xmath159 in eq .",

    "evidence for this interpretation comes from the experimental distribution of @xmath185 momenta , which shows that the @xmath185 s produced in @xmath0 or @xmath164 decay are recoiling against a state with a mass greater than or equal to the mass of the @xmath186 @xcite .",

    ", one could count the number of @xmath196 ( or @xmath197 ) events per @xmath198 event at the @xmath199 , @xmath200 \\cr     & \\approx & ( 1-b ) br(b\\to dx)\\,br(\\overline b\\to dx )     + { b\\over2}\\,br(b\\to dx)\\,br(b\\to dx)\\,,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and @xmath201 \\cr     & & + { b\\over2}\\left[br(b\\to dx)\\,br(b\\to d^+_sx)+     br(\\overline b\\to dx)\\,br(\\overline b\\to d^+_sx)\\right ] \\cr      & \\approx & ( 1-b)\\,br(b\\to dx)\\,br(\\overline b\\to d^+_sx)\\,.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath202 is the @xmath203 mixing parameter  @xcite . it is defined as the fraction of @xmath0 meson events which are @xmath204 or @xmath205 , and is measured directly from lepton - lepton sign correlations , @xmath206 combining eqs .",
    "( [ dmulti ] ) and ( [ ndd ] ) , we may extract @xmath207 and @xmath208 separately , if we neglect @xmath194 violation and impose the constraint @xmath209 .",
    "analogously , we may extract @xmath210 and @xmath211 .",
    "another method for determining individual branching ratios would involve tagging the flavor of the @xmath0 which produced the charmed hadron by measuring the charge of a hard primary lepton from the other @xmath0 in the event .    invoking a large violation of local duality",
    "has some implications for the pattern of @xmath0 meson decays which may be different from what would be expected if local duality held and an unusually small value of @xmath1 were used to explain the measured @xmath0 semileptonic branching ratio .",
    "for example , a violation of local duality in the @xmath4 channel could lead to quite different lifetimes for the @xmath0 , @xmath212 and @xmath213 , differences which are small in the operator product expansion because they arise only from higher dimension operators .",
    "however , since the effective hamiltonian for this process has isospin zero , the equality of the @xmath214 and @xmath215 lifetimes would not be disturbed .",
    "similarly , violations of local duality in @xmath182 could lead to unequal @xmath214 and @xmath215 lifetimes .",
    "@xmath0 decay event shapes can also provide a test of the free quark decay picture for the @xmath216 decay channel  @xcite .",
    "we have examined whether the measured @xmath0 meson semileptonic branching ratio can be explained within the conventional application of the operator product expansion , in which operators of low dimension are kept and perturbative corrections are included to a few orders in @xmath3 .",
    "we have found that this scenario would require an unusually small value for @xmath1 . if instead the explanation lies outside the conventional application of the operator product expansion , then a failure of local duality in the @xmath154 channel is the likely explanation for the discrepancy with experiment . in either case",
    ", we expect the number of charmed hadrons per @xmath0 decay to be approximately 1.3 .",
    "unfortunately , the present data on charm multiplicities do not support such a large value of @xmath162 . from our perspective , the unusual feature of inclusive @xmath0 decay is not the semileptonic branching ratio alone , nor the charm multiplicity alone , but rather the combination of the two .",
    "together , they would seem to suggest a significant violation of local duality in the @xmath182 nonleptonic decay process . from a theoretical point of view",
    ", however , such a resolution would be somewhat unsettling , as it would indicate a breakdown in the computation of the nonleptonic decay rate in the region where it is expected to be the most reliable ; we understand why such a conclusion was resisted by the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite . still , it remains an open possibility , indicating perhaps that the invocation of local duality in quark decay requires a considerably larger energy release than has been navely hoped or expected .",
    "given the apparent difficulties in performing a reliable computation of the nonleptonic decay rate , then , the ckm matrix element @xmath217 should be extracted from the @xmath0 semileptonic decay width rather than from the @xmath0 lifetime .",
    "the uncertainties in such an extraction arise primarily from the choice of @xmath21 and subtraction point @xmath111 , and are discussed in detail in refs .",
    "@xcite .    after this paper was completed , we learned that the order @xmath3 radiative correction to the semileptonic decay width has been calculated analytically , including all dependence on @xmath218 , by y.  nir@xcite .",
