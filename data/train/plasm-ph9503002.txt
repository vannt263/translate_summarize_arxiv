    "<S> the profile of a bennett hole induced by laser field in ionic distribution in collisional plasma is calculated . </S>",
    "<S> influence of chandrasekhar s dependence of coefficients of velocity space transport on the profile is included into the calculation for the first time . </S>",
    "<S> it is found that the hole narrows down as the field detuning frequency increases . </S>",
    "<S> physical cause of the effect is the falling dependence of coulomb collision frequency on the ionic velocity . </S>",
    "<S> estimations show that the effect is quite observable under conditions of high - current gas - discharge plasma .    </S>",
    "<S> the nonlinear spectroscopic technique as a plasma diagnostic tool is a subject of considerable recent interest because of its novelty and potential in basic and applied plasma physics . of particular interest are the spectroscopic effects of coulomb scattering @xcite , since it differs radically in appearance from binary collisions in gases @xcite . in linear absorption spectra doppler width </S>",
    "<S> usually exceeds collisional broadening , so it masks effects of the scattering . </S>",
    "<S> however , the velocity distribution of particles interacting with a monochromatic field near the resonance is changed significantly by the scattering . </S>",
    "<S> if the frequency @xmath0 of the field is near - resonant with bohr s frequency @xmath1 between levels @xmath2 and @xmath3 of the atoms with velocity @xmath4 that satisfies the condition @xmath5 , then the induced transitions @xmath6 occur ( @xmath7 denotes the wavevector ) . as a result </S>",
    "<S> , the narrow peak or dip ( bennett hole @xcite ) arises in the velocity distribution of level populations . </S>",
    "<S> the steady - state profiles of holes are controlled by both the homogeneous width of transition @xmath6 and the scattering processes with a change in velocity . </S>",
    "<S> measuring the width , shift and asymmetry of nonequilibrium structures in the distribution with the help of probe - field technique one can extract information about the scattering .    </S>",
    "<S> previous calculations of coulomb broadening @xcite were based on the assumption of the constancy of the diffusion coefficient in the velocity space . </S>",
    "<S> this assumption is applicable when the detuning frequency @xmath8 is less than the doppler width @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is the thermal velocity of ions and @xmath2 is the ion mass . </S>",
    "<S> the constant diffusion model was enough to interpret lamb dip measurement in argon laser plasma or another with near- resonance pumping . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast , farther away from the resonance , at @xmath11 , one must take chandrasekhar s velocity dependence of the diffusion tensor that complicates the evaluation . </S>",
    "<S> one way around this problem was shown in linear theory of dicke narrowing in the ionic spectrum , which had been built up for low intensity of the incident wave @xcite .    in the present letter </S>",
    "<S> we study a first - order nonlinear problem , the influence of collisions in plasma on the profile of the bennett hole . </S>",
    "<S> the calculation presented below for nonlinear structure in the velocity distribution is performed in the basis of density matrix formalism @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> first we derive the formula for the distribution , then analyze it under some simple but realistic conditions , and at the end estimate whether the effect obtained be observable in experiment . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , we show that the width of hole decreases with the detuning of the electromagnetic field from the resonance . by observing the effect , one could directly measure the diffusion tensor . </S>",
    "<S> it would be helpful to confirm our understanding and offer scope for new diagnostic methods .    </S>",
    "<S> the diffusion coefficient as a function of the velocity was measured for q - machine plasma at low density by bowles et al . @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the effect of transient spread of a bennett hole in the distribution of tagged ion population in a metastable state was exploited . </S>",
    "<S> however , that effect can not be used for denser plasma , because the diffusion time becomes smaller and the measurement requires a faster registration technique . in this paper </S>",
    "<S> we shall examine the stationary hole shape . </S>",
    "<S> analysis of its width is useful for diagnostics at high as well as at low density .    to develop the theory of nonequilibrium structures in the velocity distribution , </S>",
    "<S> let us describe the two - level subsystem of a probe ion in an ideal nondegenerate plasma by the spectroscopic density matrix @xmath12 . </S>",
    "<S> this matrix over internal states @xmath13 is at the same time the wigner function of position @xmath14 and velocity @xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> it has been shown @xcite that elements of the matrix satisfy the quantum kinetic equation with the classical landau collision term . </S>",
    "<S> this equation makes it possible to analyze resonant transitions between levels in the field of the traveling wave @xmath15 c.c .    denoting the relaxation constants of level populations as @xmath16 and that of the coherence as @xmath17 , write steady - state equations for off - diagonal @xmath18 and diagonal @xmath19 elements of the density matrix @xmath20 where the upper / lower sign corresponds to upper / lower level . </S>",
    "<S> here @xmath21 , @xmath22 , @xmath23 is the matrix element of the dipole moment , @xmath24 is the coulomb collision frequency , @xmath25 is the charge of a probe ion , @xmath26 is the coulomb logarithm . </S>",
    "<S> we assume that there are only singly charged ions in plasm ; @xmath27 is their concentration . </S>",
    "<S> the excitation of ionic levels @xmath28 usually occurs from the ground or metastable state , so we are justified in assuming the shape of the excitation function @xmath29 to be maxwellian @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the excitation rate of level @xmath32 .    for plasma in a state close to the thermodynamic equilibrium with ionic temperature @xmath33 </S>",
    "<S> , the distribution of buffer particles has the maxwellian shape . </S>",
    "<S> then it is possible to write an explicit expression for collision operator @xmath34 involving the dynamic friction and the diffusion in the velocity space @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the @xmath37 - component of the dimensionless velocity , the differential operator @xmath38 acts on the right . </S>",
    "<S> functions @xmath39 and @xmath40 , occurring in the expression for the diffusion tensor @xmath41 can be written as single integrals @xmath42    the velocity distribution of populations @xmath43 of both levels @xmath28 needs to be found . to simplify analysis </S>",
    "<S> , we assume the electromagnetic field to be weak @xmath44 and will neglect the effects of strong saturation . </S>",
    "<S> the right sides of eqs . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ qke ] ) can therefore be regarded as perturbation . </S>",
    "<S> the formal solution of ( [ qke ] ) in terms of operator exponents is @xmath45 @xmath46    it remains to write out the explicit solution and analyze its limiting cases . for this purpose </S>",
    "<S> we must calculate the commutators of operators @xmath47 and @xmath34 and get , in the general case , the infinite series . </S>",
    "<S> fortunately , the relation @xmath48,\\hat a],\\hat a]=0 $ ] allows us to break the series within the first order in  @xmath49 : @xmath50 , \\label{bennett}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the axis @xmath51 is chosen along the wavevector @xmath7 . </S>",
    "<S> function @xmath52 is the @xmath53 - component of the diffusion tensor . </S>",
    "<S> this function depends on two variables @xmath54 and @xmath55 . </S>",
    "<S> the integrand in ( [ bennett ] ) , obtained by the expansion , is inappropriate at long times @xmath56 . </S>",
    "<S> consequently , for application of this expansion it is necessary to have the main contribution to integral ( [ bennett ] ) in the domain where the quadratic terms in @xmath49 remain small . since @xmath57 , estimation of those terms gives the following applicability conditions of the expansion ( [ bennett ] ) @xmath58 the latter inequality means the doppler limit </S>",
    "<S> ; the former one coincides with the condition of smallness of the diffusion broadening compared to the doppler width . </S>",
    "<S> the collision frequency in high - current gas - discharge plasma is about @xmath59  </S>",
    "<S> @xmath60  s@xmath61 ( see @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> it is by a few orders of magnitude less than the doppler width @xmath62 and , as a rule , less than the relaxation rates @xmath63 , @xmath64 . </S>",
    "<S> that is why we may use small parameters @xmath37 , @xmath65 and it is enough to hold only terms linear in @xmath49 .    </S>",
    "<S> taking an integral over @xmath66 we obtain the correction to the distribution function as a single integral over @xmath67 @xmath68 \\over \\gamma _ j+\\phi _ { zz}(\\vec\\xi)\\nu k^2v_t^2t^2/2 - 2i\\nu kv_z\\phi _ </S>",
    "<S> l(\\xi ) t}\\,dt.\\ ] ] the integrand in ( [ nb ] ) regarded as a function of @xmath67 at @xmath69 is maximal at @xmath70 and decreases with @xmath67 . </S>",
    "<S> the shape of the distribution depends on a few parameters . </S>",
    "<S> considering conditions ( [ condition ] ) and the inequality @xmath71 we can set apart two limiting cases of parameters : @xmath72 @xmath73 for the domain ( [ d1 ] ) integral ( [ nb ] ) is accumulated at @xmath74 . </S>",
    "<S> the diffusion and friction cause the bennett hole to somewhat change its width and position . for the limit ( [ d2 ] ) integral ( [ nb ] ) </S>",
    "<S> is gathered at @xmath75 . </S>",
    "<S> diffusion and friction effects control the width and shift of the hole . </S>",
    "<S> the width is defined by the maximum among the homogeneous width @xmath76 and diffusion width @xmath77 . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the scattering has stronger impact on shape of the hole , while the relaxation constants of selected levels satisfy inequality ( [ d2 ] ) .    </S>",
    "<S> let us find the width as a function of detuning in this limit @xmath78 . </S>",
    "<S> it is convenient to write the expression for the nonlinear correction to the maxwellian distribution as a convolution of two functions @xmath79 where @xmath80.\\label{f}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in the limit @xmath81 , the width of function @xmath82 is much less than that of @xmath83 . </S>",
    "<S> accordingly , the central part of the distribution is given by expression ( [ g ] ) @xmath84 at @xmath85 . </S>",
    "<S> meanwhile function @xmath83 drops exponentially with @xmath86 , so the asymptotic of the distribution @xmath87 at @xmath88 is given by a narrow but slowly falling function @xmath82 and has the lorentzian shape .    </S>",
    "<S> the most interesting feature of the distribution obtained is the narrowing of its central part as the detuning @xmath8 increases , due to the falling velocity dependence of the collision frequency . </S>",
    "<S> one can estimate the half - width by substituting the extreme value of the longitudinal velocity @xmath89 into all components of the diffusion tensor : @xmath90 this quantity is proportional to the square root of the @xmath53- component of the diffusion tensor . </S>",
    "<S> it falls off with detuning @xmath8 . </S>",
    "<S> the effect is absent in the model of the constant collision frequency @xcite .    to describe this effect quantitatively </S>",
    "<S> we calculate the @xmath8- dependence of @xmath91 averaged over the distribution ( [ cb ] ) . keeping only the terms linear in parameters @xmath37 and @xmath65 we obtain @xmath92 @xmath93.\\ ] ] the first term on the right - hand side of ( [ width ] ) </S>",
    "<S> is independent of @xmath8 and corresponds to the contribution of the lorentzian wings of the distribution . </S>",
    "<S> the second term describes the collisional broadening and decreases with @xmath94 .    under the approximations </S>",
    "<S> the line shape is voigt s contour . </S>",
    "<S> the dependence of the variance @xmath95 on detuning @xmath8 consists of two terms : the contribution of the wings , which increases with detuning , and the decreasing contribution of the diffusion broadening . at small detuning @xmath96 </S>",
    "<S> we have the explicit expression @xmath97    summarizing the results , we conclude that the bennett hole narrows down as detuning increases . </S>",
    "<S> the physical reason of the effect is that the width of the hole is not affected by the homogeneous width @xmath98 , but depends on the change in velocity due to diffusion @xmath99 , while @xmath100 . </S>",
    "<S> the excited state lifetime @xmath101 determines the stationary width of the hole . </S>",
    "<S> while the detuning @xmath8 of the field remains inside the doppler contour , the field interacts only with a group of slow ions @xmath102 . </S>",
    "<S> when we turn the field off the resonance , the light interacts with faster excited ions . collision frequency of those ions with ions in the ground state @xmath103 is smaller , therefore the width decreases . it would be more proper to call this effect decrease of the broadening instead of the narrowing .    to observe the narrowing experimentally </S>",
    "<S> , the probe - field spectroscopy can be used . </S>",
    "<S> one should measure the near - resonant absorption or gain of a weak probe wave as a function of its detuning on the same or adjacent transition . </S>",
    "<S> another possibility is recording the spectrum of spontaneous emission in the presence of a strong resonant continuous field . </S>",
    "<S> let us estimate two alternative effects independent of the detuning , namely , stark broadening and change of velocity due to the interaction with electrons . </S>",
    "<S> the stark effect is quadratic in the arii spectrum . </S>",
    "<S> its value @xcite is about 100  mhz , which is small compared with both the homogeneous width @xmath17 and the diffusion one @xmath104 . </S>",
    "<S> the velocity change owing to scattering on electrons is as small as the ratio of the ion and electron thermal velocities @xmath105 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the ion - ion collision frequency decreases no more than by a factor of 23 at the detuning about @xmath9 ; therefore , neither alternative broadening mechanism can compensate the effect in question . </S>",
    "<S> the measured diffusion broadening in low - temperature argon plasma at zero detuning is by a factor of 34 ( see @xcite ) . at the detuning @xmath106 the narrowing factor </S>",
    "<S> expected is more than 10% , so this effect seems observable , see fig . 1 .    </S>",
