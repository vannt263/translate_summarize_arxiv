    "the traditional , phenomenological definition of a symbiotic star is a late type giant with a companion , hot enough to result in prominent high - excitation emission lines in the optical @xcite .",
    "while we know of several symbiotic x - ray binaries with neutron star accretors ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) , and symbiotic stars with main sequence accretors may exist , the majority of symbiotic stars appear to be wide binaries in which white dwarfs accrete from red giants . in recent years",
    ", we have gained new insights into the symbiotic phenomenon through x - ray observations .",
    "first was the discovery of four symbiotic stars , ch  cyg , t  crb , rt  cru , and v648  car ( also known as ss73 17 and cd @xmath057 3057 ) , in the _ swift _  burst alert telescope ( bat ) survey of the 14195 kev sky ( @xcite ; see also @xcite ) .",
    "the hard x - ray spectra of these sources can be described as optically thin , thermal emission with a high temperature , and are interpreted as due to accretion onto the white dwarf surface via the boundary layer .",
    "subsequently , pointed _ swift _  x - ray telescope ( xrt ) survey of known symbiotic stars ( @xcite and references therein ) showed that many other symbiotic stars had a similar x - ray emission component , although not luminous and/or hard enough to be detectable in the bat survey .",
    "@xcite called this type of x - ray emission @xmath1-type , expanding the earlier classification scheme of @xcite .",
    "the @xmath1-type x - ray component is often highly absorbed and can not be detected in the soft x - rays .",
    "the column density of the absorber often far exceeds that expect from the interstellar medium ( ism ) , and is seen to be variable from observation to observation : the absorber is intrinsic to the system .",
    "these observations allow us to divide symbiotic stars into shell - burning systems , powered by nuclear fusion as well as accretion , and non - burning systems , powered by accretion alone .",
    "there is no known instance of a shell - burning system in which a @xmath1-type x - ray emission is detected .",
    "in addition , the _ swift _  uv and optical telescope ( uvot ) data show a high degree of uv variability in the non - burning symbiotic stars , interpreted as flickering of the accretion disc , while shell - burning symbiotics have steady uv emission @xcite .",
    "@xcite showed that 4 out of 461 bat sources in the 22-month survey catalogue @xcite were non - burning symbiotic stars . in this letter , we report the first discovery since then of a new symbiotic star among bat sources .",
    "the _ swift _  mission @xcite performs a sensitive all - sky survey of the hard x - ray ( 14195 kev ) sky as a by - product of its main objective to detect and observe gamma - ray bursts .",
    "gc and as have been engaged in an effort to produce a series of catalogues of bat sources ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) using the bat_imager code @xcite , and are preparing the fourth version of the catalogue covering the first 100 months of the mission ( 2004 december to 2013 april ) and containing 1710 sources . one new source in this catalogue is 4pbc  j0642.9 + 5528 .",
    "the batch processing for the catalogue indicated that this source had its highest signal - to - noise ( s / n ) in the 1535 kev range , and during 2010 october 14 to 2012 august 1 ( hereafter ` high state ' ) .",
    "the survey products include the average and the high state spectra of 4pbc  j0642.9 + 5528 .",
    "to investigate its variability further , we extracted 1535 kev light curve over the period 2004 december 8 to 2016 january 11 in 15 day bins , in which we converted bat count rate to flux using a factor of 3.147@xmath2 ergs@xmath3s@xmath4  per 1 cts@xmath4 , appropriate for the spectral shape of su  lyn ; we show the light curve rebinned into 120 day bins in figure[fig : batlc ] .",
    "the only previously known x - ray source in the bat error circle is 1rxs  j064255.9 + 552835 , and the only known optical object within its error circle is su  lyn , listed in the general catalog of variable stars as a semi - regular variable ( magnitude range : 10.59.6 ) .",
    "there do not appear to be any publications that discuss in - depth studies of su  lyn .",
    "a single m giant is a very weak , almost undetectable , _ soft _ x - ray source at most ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) , and never a hard ( @xmath510 kev ) x - ray source .",
    "we therefore arranged for follow - up _ swift _  and optical observations to confirm this association .",
    ".pointed _ swift _  observations of su  lyn [ cols=\"<,^,>,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     we have shown that su  lyn , previously catalogued as a semi - regular variable , is in fact a hard x - ray luminous symbiotic star .",
    "we use our _ swift _  results to infer the nature of the hot component as follows . assuming a distance of 640 pc , the x - ray luminosity was @xmath65.2 @xmath7 ergss@xmath4  during the xrt observations , and @xmath64.0 @xmath8 ergss@xmath4during the high state .",
    "we estimate the uv flux to be about 1.2@xmath9 ergs@xmath3s@xmath4@xmath4 , for a total uv ( 20004000 ) flux of 2.4@xmath10 ergs@xmath3s@xmath4 , or uv luminosity of 1.2@xmath11 ergss@xmath4 .",
    "thus , the uv luminosity exceeds the x - ray luminosity by a substantial margin , even before applying a bolometric correction .",
    "this strongly argues against a symbiotic x - ray binary interpretation , in which the accreting object is a neutron star , since accreting neutron stars release most of the gravitational potential energy in the x - rays .",
    "the x - ray and uv luminosities of su  lyn  indicate that it contains an accreting white dwarf .",
    "moreover , when compared to the nine known symbiotic stars whose @xmath1-type x - ray emission was discovered by @xcite , su  lyn  appears more x - ray luminous than at least five . in the uvot event mode data on su  lyn",
    ", we have found a strong uv variability down to a sub - minute time scale for the first time in such a system .",
    "the observed variability was of the same order as that obtained by @xcite in several other symbiotic stars , although they were only sensitive to variability on longer time scales since they used uvot image mode data .",
    "@xcite found that such strong uv variability is a characteristic of non - burning symbiotic stars .",
    "therefore , we infer that su  lyn  is also powered purely by accretion , with the observed uv luminosity predominantly from the accretion disc .",
    "we can constrain the white dwarf mass in su  lyn  using our x - ray spectral fits , because the white dwarf mass determines the maximum shock temperature that can be reached in an optically thin boundary layer @xcite .",
    "the observed @xmath12 is consistent with a 1 m@xmath13  white dwarf ( with a predicted @xmath12 of 28 kev ) . in this scenario ,",
    "the observed x - ray luminosity implies an accretion rate of 7.0 @xmath14 m@xmath13yr@xmath4 .",
    "the observed uv luminosity corresponds to an accretion rate of 1.6@xmath15 m@xmath13yr@xmath4 , assuming that it is entirely from the accretion disc , and is likely to be higher due to bolometric correction .",
    "thus , although the boundary layer could be optically thin if an additional source of uv luminosity such as shocks is present , the rapid uv variability constrains the possible nature of , or the contribution by , such a source .    alternatively ,",
    "the boundary layer in su  lyn  may be partially optically thick , which is thought to require an accretion rate above @xmath61.0@xmath16 m@xmath13yr@xmath4 ( see @xcite and references therein ) , and hence a factor of @xmath56 bolometric correction for the disk uv luminosity .",
    "such a boundary layer emit a residual optically thin x - ray emission with a lower luminosity and with a lower temperature than the pure optically thin case ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) . in this interpretation ,",
    "the white dwarf in su  lyn  is likely to be more massive than @xmath61 m@xmath13 .     and",
    "[ neiii ] 3869 profiles from the high resolution spectra taken on the same night . ]    the manner of discovery of su  lyn  is very similar to that of 4  dra , whose hot component was discovered in the uv @xcite .",
    "later observations established this as a symbiotic star with a @xmath1-type x - ray emission ( @xcite ) .",
    "the symbiotic nature of su  lyn  and 4  dra were not recognized from the ground because neither has emission lines strong enough to show up in low resolution surveys . in typical symbiotic stars ,",
    "prominent emission lines arise when the red giant wind is photoionized by a central hot source which is thought to be a @xmath610@xmath17k blackbody - like source with luminosities 10010000 l@xmath13 ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) , or @xmath18@xmath19 ergss@xmath4 .",
    "the uv luminosity of t  crb is estimated to be lower , and the optical emission lines are prominent only some of the time ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the uv luminosity of su  lyn  may well be lower still , similar to that of 4  dra ( 2.6@xmath11 ergss@xmath4 ; @xcite ) .",
    "it is therefore reasonable that the resulting emission lines in the optical are too weak to show up in low resolution spectroscopic surveys .    the large difference in the hot component luminosity , in turn , is due to the different energy sources : nuclear fusion vs. accretion .",
    "the former produces @xmath650 times more energy per nucleon than the latter .",
    "the shell - burning symbiotic stars exhibit prominent emission lines ; non - burning ones have weak lines at most .",
    "the existing catalogues of symbiotic stars rely heavily on the emission lines and are therefore biased in favor of shell - burning symbiotics .",
    "su  lyn  and 4  dra are two examples of non - burning symbiotics without prominent lines , and other similar systems likely exist .",
    "this hidden population is potentially large .",
    "the bat detection of su  lyn  was possible because of its relative proximity , and because of its x - ray high state . without the high state ,",
    "the bat survey can only detect su  lyn  out to @xmath20500 pc .",
    "the _ rosat _",
    "all - sky survey could only detect 4  dra out to @xmath20200 pc .",
    "scaling by the area of the galactic disc , these suggest of order 4 su  lyn - like systems and of order 25 4  dra - like systems within 1 kpc , implying a higher space density than that of known symbiotic stars . the three hard x - ray emitting ,",
    "uv excess agb stars discovered by @xcite are likely to be part of this same population .",
    "@xcite estimated the total galactic population of symbiotic stars to be up to @xmath63 @xmath21 , up from the previous estimate of @xmath63000 .",
    "both estimates are extrapolation from the @xmath6150 systems known at the time , but with different estimates of their distances .",
    "we believe it is quite possible that we may face another significant revision in the total galactic population of symbiotic stars , once a survey for su  lyn - like systems can be performed .",
    "we have discovered that su  lyn , previously catalogued as a semi - regular variable , is a hard x - ray source in the _ swift _  bat survey catalogue .",
    "based on the _ swift _  and ground - based data , we interpret su  lyn  as a symbiotic star powered purely by accretion onto a white dwarf .",
    "the lack of shell burning leads to su  lyn  having very weak symbiotic signatures in the optical .",
    "since existing catalogues of symbiotic stars rely heavily on prominent emission lines , non - burning symbiotics are likely severely under - represented in these catalogues .",
    "further observations of su  lyn  are highly desirable for us to tune our search strategy for other members of this hidden population of symbiotic stars .",
    "we thank neil gehrels , the pi of the _ swift _  mission , for a generous allocation of too time .",
