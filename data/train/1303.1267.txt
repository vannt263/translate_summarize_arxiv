    "recently in @xcite , it has been shown that in the framework of the extended chiral njl model @xcite the @xmath8 and @xmath9 processes are satisfactorily described at energies up to 1.6  gev .",
    "the contributions from the intermediate vector mesons in both the ground and radially excited states were taken into account .",
    "radially excited states of mesons were introduced in the standard njl model with the polynomial form factor of the second order in the transverse momentum of quarks @xcite . in this case , the slope parameter of this form factor was defined by the conditions that the quark condensate did not change after the introduction of excited meson states in the standard njl model .",
    "in contrast with other phenomenological models used for description of low - energy interactions of mesons , the extended njl model does not need to introduce additional arbitrary parameters for the above processes ( see , for instance , @xcite ) .",
    "up to now the processes with pion production , as well as @xmath10 , and @xmath11 in the final state have been considered . to do this , it was sufficient to use the @xmath12 njl model . to consider the processes with production of @xmath13 and @xmath14 mesons in the final state",
    ", one has to use the extended @xmath15 njl model . in @xcite ,",
    "the photoproduction of @xmath16 , @xmath17 , @xmath18 , @xmath19 in colliding electron - positron beams was studied .",
    "unlike the previous works , here we had to use the mixing matrix of the four isoscalar states of @xmath13 mesons @xcite .    in this work",
    ", we will continue investigation in this direction , namely , we will calculate the total cross section of the processes @xmath20 , with intermediate states of vector mesons , in both the ground and radial - excited states in the energy region up to 2  gev .",
    "our results for the process @xmath21 are in satisfactory agreement with the experimental data obtained in @xcite .",
    "the predictions for the processes containing @xmath14 , @xmath18 , @xmath19 are given .",
    "the predictions can be verified in the ongoing experiment at vepp-2000 ( novosibirsk ) .",
