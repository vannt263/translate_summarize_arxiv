    "in solid state physics , elementary excitations can be classified according to their symmetries .",
    "selection rules based on symmetry considerations have been sucessfully applied to transitions involving initial states and final states .",
    "photons carry negligible wave vector therefore only zone center excitations participate in an optial process at first order .",
    "second order double excitations , on the other hand , are also symmetry allowed to participate in optical transitions and sometimes even dominate the first order single excitation  @xcite . due to the possibly high density of states at high symmetry points  @xcite , double excitations are only considered at high symmetry points , lines and surfaces . these special , high symmetry points , lines or surfaces are vanishingly small in number compared to arbitrary point @xmath0 which occupies almost the entire brillouin zone .",
    "second order double excitations from @xmath0 can also participate in experiments therefore it is interesting from a physics point of view that the direct product of @xmath2 @xmath3 @xmath4 is performed .    when doing the decomposition of direct product @xmath2 @xmath3 @xmath4 , a general rule is found : the reduction coefficients of the @xmath5 point representations equals the dimensionality of the representation ( see equation  [ eqn : test ] )",
    ". we will show below that this rule holds for all kinds of space groups : fedorov groups , layer groups , rod groups , wallpaper groups , frieze groups and line groups .",
    "the rule presented in this note saves the labor in determining the coefficients in the standard linear algebraic method . to our knownledge",
    "no such analysis exist in the literature .",
    "this note is arranged as follows : theoretical background on both the irreducible representations and reduction coefficients of direct product is given in section ii , where the linear algebraic method is introduced ; the calculations of reduction coefficients of an arbitrary point with its negative are represented in section iii and a general rule is proved ; discussions are given in section iv and @xmath0 point of @xmath6 is used to demonstrate the helpfulness of our finding .",
    "the irreducible representations of group @xmath7 is a set of matrices @xmath8 that has a one - to - one correspondence with group element @xmath9 such that @xmath10 @xmath11 @xmath12 = @xmath13 .",
    "@xmath14 is the label for brillouin zone point and @xmath15 is for the @xmath15th irreducible representation at @xmath14 .",
    "rotational operations bring wave functions with wave vector @xmath14 to wave functions with wave vectors @xmath16 .",
    "some of these wave vectors are equivalent to @xmath14 : @xmath17 = @xmath14 + @xmath18 and those symmetry operations define @xmath19 , _ the group of wave vector _ .",
    "the inequivalent set of @xmath20 is called the _ star _ of @xmath14 and",
    "each inequivalent one of @xmath21 is an _ arm _ of the star .    in most cases ,",
    "the representation of wave vector group @xmath19 can be obtained from their corresponding point groups @xmath22 = @xmath23 @xmath11 @xmath24 where @xmath23 is the representation of the corresponding point group .",
    "for example , at @xmath5 point , the representation of space group is simply the representation of the point group : @xmath25 = @xmath26 .",
    "the exceptions are the brillouin zone points on the boundary of the non - symmorphic space groups .",
    "their representations need special treatment  @xcite . and",
    "the results have already been tabulated by kovalev  @xcite and zak  @xcite .",
    "irreducible representation @xmath27 of @xmath7 can be induced from @xmath28 of @xmath19 @xmath29 and the _ dotted matrix _",
    "@xmath30 are defined as : @xmath31 @xmath27 is in a block structure with @xmath32 and @xmath33 as indices for blocks . @xmath34 and @xmath35 are coset representatives of @xmath19 .",
    "the character @xmath36 of @xmath27 are defined accordingly .",
    "the direct product of two representations is in general reducible and can be decomposed as summation of many irreducible representations .",
    "the group theoretical job is to determine the reduction coefficients @xmath37 which is defined as @xmath38 , or equivalently , @xmath39 among the different ways of determining the coefficients @xmath37 , method of linear algebraic equations is most straightforward .",
    "choose as many symmetry elements as needed in equation  [ eqn : chi1 ] and the coefficients @xmath37 can be obtained once the number of linearly independent equations equals the number of coefficients .",
    "but before that , not a single coefficient can be determined .",
    "sometimes the number of coefficients is quite big and the calculation is complicated .",
    "@xmath0 is the arbitrary point in the brillouin zone .",
    "arbitrary means that @xmath0 = @xmath40 and the group of wave vector contains only the identity operator : @xmath41 = @xmath42 .",
    "@xmath41 has only one one - dimensional representation therefore the superscript @xmath15 is dropped from now on .",
    "the character of @xmath43 is : @xmath44 where coset representative @xmath34 is now the whole set of @xmath45 rotational operations .",
    "representations contained in @xmath2 @xmath3 @xmath4 can be devided into three catagories : @xmath5 , @xmath46 and @xmath47 : @xmath5 = ( 0 , 0 , 0 ) ; @xmath46 are some high symmetry points , lines or surfaces besides @xmath5 , such as ( @xmath48 ) + ( @xmath49 ) = ( @xmath50 ) and @xmath47 is arbitrary points such as ( @xmath48 ) + ( @xmath48 ) = ( @xmath51 )",
    ". there could be more than one @xmath46 and @xmath52 therefore they are denoted as @xmath46 , @xmath53 , @xmath47 , @xmath54and so on .",
    "@xmath55 we want only @xmath56",
    ". for @xmath57 = @xmath42 , equation  [ eqn : chi3 ] reads : @xmath58 however , the total dimensionality of @xmath5 point representations in the direct product equal the number of zeros in @xmath52 @xmath3 @xmath59 .",
    "each arm @xmath60 @xmath11 @xmath61 and its negative @xmath60 @xmath11 @xmath62 gives one zone center dimension .",
    "the total dimenionality of zone center representations equals the number of arms in @xmath52 : @xmath63 for @xmath57 ,",
    "@xmath60 @xmath64 @xmath65 , equation  [ eqn : chi3 ] gives : @xmath66 this equation can be simplified using the fact that @xmath67 are not functions of @xmath0 = ( @xmath48 ) while @xmath68 are .",
    "equation  [ eqn : phi1 ] now becomes : @xmath69 equation  [ eqn : phi2 ] is a set of ( @xmath70 ) equations .",
    "combined with equation  [ eqn : e2 ] , the coefficients @xmath71 are determined : @xmath72 the last step is exactly the same as the orthogonality theorem of the 32 point groups  @xcite .",
    "it shows that the number of appearances of any zone center representation in the direct product of @xmath2 @xmath3 @xmath4 equals the dimensionality of that representation in the corresponding point group .",
    "the above analysis applies to both symmorphic and non - symmorphic space groups .",
    "we want to emphasis that the above analysis is not restricted to fedorov space groups .",
    "the same analysis applies to space group of different dimensions : fedorov groups , layer groups , rod groups , wallpaper groups , frieze groups and line groups .",
    "before discussing the physical interpretations of the general rule , an example is given .",
    "the decomposition of direct product of an arbitrary brillouin point @xmath52 in @xmath6 ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : fcc ] ) space group with its negative @xmath59 is : @xmath73 plus many other terms that are not at @xmath5 point .",
    "the direct product of @xmath2 @xmath3 @xmath4 in @xmath6 contains 34 stars .",
    "obviously the full determination of the 34 coefficients using the linear algebraic method is rather tedious and one must go to programs for help .",
    "_ bilbao crystallographic server _",
    "@xcite calculates reduction coefficients of any direct product .",
    "the result for @xmath1 of @xmath6 agrees with our predict .",
    "similar tests has been carried out at different ( arbitrary ) brillouin zone points of different space groups ( especially @xmath74 and @xmath75 ) and equation  [ eqn : result ] is proved to be right .",
    "it is seen from equation  [ eqn : result ] that all the zone center representations are contained in the direct product of @xmath27 and @xmath76 . as a result ,",
    "double excitations from @xmath0 point has the right symmetry to participate in optical transitions regardless of photon polarization directions .",
    "although , in general , the density of states of excitations ( such as phonons and magnons ) is low at @xmath0 point due to the absence of van hove singularities , the contributions from @xmath0 point which occupies almost the entire brillouin zone could contribute to the background of the spectrum in optical experiments .",
    "to summerize , a general rule on the decomposition of @xmath2 @xmath3 @xmath4 is presented and proved .",
    "it applies to fedorov groups , layer groups , rod groups , wallpaper groups , frieze groups and line groups .",
    "the physical meaning is that from symmetry point of view double excitations ( phonons , magnons ) from the vast majority of the brillouin zone @xmath0 could contribute to the backgroud of optical experiments regardless of photon polarizations .",
