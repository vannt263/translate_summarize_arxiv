    "the fractional calculus has recently received a great deal of attention in the physics literature , through the publications of books @xcite , review articles @xcite , as well as an ever increasing number of research papers , some of which are quoted here @xcite .",
    "the blossoming interest in the fractional calculus is due , in part , to the fact it provides one of the dynamical foundations for fractal stochastic processes @xcite .",
    "the adoption of the fractional calculus by the physics community was inhibited historically because there was no clear experimental evidence for its need .",
    "the disciplines of statistical physics and thermodynamics were thought to be sufficient for describing complex physical phenomena solely with the use and modifications of analytic functions .",
    "this view was supported by the successes of such physicists as lars onsager , who through the use of simple physical arguments was able to relate apparently independent transport processes to one another , even though these processes are associated with quite different physical phenomena @xcite .",
    "his general arguments rested on three assumptions : 1 ) microscopic dynamics have time - reversal symmetry ; 2 ) fluctuations of the heat bath decay at the same rate as do macroscopic deviations from equilibrium and 3 ) physical systems are aged .",
    "we refer to assumption 2 as the onsager principle and show that it is tied up with assumption 3 .",
    "onsager s arguments focused on a system that is in contact with a heat bath sufficiently long that the bath has come to thermal equilibrium and consequently the system is aged . in statistical physics",
    "we know that the bath is responsible for both fluctuations and dissipation , and if the fluctuations are white the regression of perturbations of the bath to equilibrium is instantaneous .",
    "this means that the energy absorbed from the system of interest by the bath , through macroscopic dissipation , is distributed over the bath degrees of freedom on a very much shorter time scale than the relaxation time of the system .",
    "this property is summarized in the well known fluctuation - dissipation theorem , which has even been generalized to the case where the fluctuations in the bath do not regress instantaneously @xcite .",
    "the dynamics of the physical variables to which the onsager principle apply are described by two different kinds of equations : 1 ) the langevin equation , a stochastic differential equation for the dynamical variable and 2 ) the phase space equation for the probability density .",
    "two distinct methods have been developed to describe the phase space evolution of the probability density : the master equation introduced by pauli and the continuous time random walk ( ctrw ) approach of montroll and weiss @xcite .",
    "the ctrw formalism describes a random walk in which the walker pauses after each jump for a sojourn specified by a waiting time distribution function .",
    "it was shown by bedeaux _",
    "_ @xcite that the markov master equation is equivalent to ctrw if the waiting time distribution is poissonian .",
    "however , when the waiting time distribution is not exponential , the case we consider here , the equivalence between the two approaches is only maintained by generalizing to the non - markov master equation , the so - called gme @xcite .",
    "recently , metzler @xcite argued that the gme unifies the fractional calculus and ctrw .",
    "allegrini _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite have shown that to create a master equation compatible with the onsager principle requires that the system be entangled with the heat bath in such a way that the bath does not regress to equilibrium infinitely fast .",
    "the system - bath entanglement is the result of a rearrangement process that may take infinitely long to complete , leading to the generalized master equation ( gme ) of kenkre _ et al .",
    "@xcite were concerned with how to make the gme stationary and therefore compatible with the onsager principle . herein , we extend that discussion to include the connection with both the fractional calculus and the nonstationary condition .    for simplicity",
    "we restrict our discussion to the case of a two - site system coupled to a heat bath , a problem closely related to the quantum problem of decoherence of a qubit , due to coupling to the environment .",
    "the connection of the ctrw , a two - state non - markov master equation and the fractional calculus has been explored by sokolov and metzler @xcite .",
    "herein we go beyond their discussion and investigate the relationships among the fractional calculus , a particular generalization of the onsager principle , and one concept of aging .",
    "we also show that the result of sokolov and metzler , which refers to the young state , is an attractor for all the systems that are partially aged , and not infinitely aged .",
    "we call this process rejuvenation .",
    "we approach the subject of fractional derivatives from a perspective similar to that of sokolov and metzler @xcite .",
    "more specifically , we address the problem of the connection between the gme @xcite and the stationary version of the ctrw @xcite .",
    "the gme considered by allegrini _",
    "@xcite is the two - site version of the following equation    @xmath9    where @xmath10 is the @xmath11-dimensional population vector of @xmath12 sites , @xmath13 is a transition matrix between the sites and @xmath14 is the memory kernel .",
    "the ctrw prescription for this process yields    @xmath15    note that @xmath16 is the probability that @xmath17 jumps occurred and that the last jump took place at time @xmath18 implying the renewal theory relation    @xmath19    where @xmath20 is the waiting time distribution function @xmath21 introduced into ctrw and @xmath22 while @xmath23 is the transition matrix connecting the sites after one jump has occurred , the probability that no jump occurs in the time interval @xmath24 is    @xmath25    the waiting time distribution function and the memory kernel can be related to one another by taking the laplace transform of the gme ( [ kenkre ] ) and the ctrw ( [ ctrw1 ] ) .",

    "either + s or - s .",

    "assuming a regression to equilibrium in such a way as the retain ( [ ctrw8 ] ) we obtain from the gme ( [ kenkre ] ) using the coupling matrix ( [ ctrw6 ] ) :    @xmath51    thus , the laplace transform of the auto - correlation function can be related to the laplace transform of the memory kernel by    @xmath52    the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite studied the problem of establishing a complete correspondence between the gme and renewal theory , characterized by the waiting time distribution @xmath53 with @xmath54 to fit the stationary condition .",
    "these authors determined that this problem could be solved by expressing the ctrw in stationary form , resulting in the gme memory kernel :    @xmath55    where @xmath56 is the average waiting time    @xmath57    the form of the memory kernel given by ( [ gerardoisagenius ] ) is consistent with the equation of motion for the auto - correlation function ( [ 58 ] ) , and consequently , eq .",
    "( [ gerardoisagenius ] ) is equivalent to @xmath58    we have to remind the reader that the stationary auto - correlation function of @xmath59 is not related directly to @xmath60 . zumofen and klafter @xcite provided a prescription for deriving the corresponding equilibrium auto - correlation function of @xmath59 from @xmath61 .",
    "their result rests on the observation that @xmath61 is an experimental function , evaluated by observing the time duration of the two states .",
    "the connection with renewal theory is established by assuming that the time duration of a state is determined by two processes , one is the extraction of a random number from a theoretical inverse power law distribution , @xmath62 , with the same power index @xmath0 , and the other is a coin tossing procedure that determines the sign of this laminar region .",
    "thus , a given experimental sojourn time in one of the two states may correspond to an arbitrarily large number of drawings and coin tossings .",
    "renewal theory is used to relate the auto - correlation function @xmath63 to the waiting time distribution function @xmath64 .",
    "in fact , from the renewal theory @xcite we obtain the following important result : @xmath65 where @xmath66 is the mean waiting time of the @xmath67-distribution density .",
    "it is interesting to notice that this equation implies that the second derivative of the auto - correlation function is proportional to @xmath67 , @xmath68    in section 2 the departure point of our calculations is given by the auto - correlation function @xmath69 of eq .",
    "( [ geiselcrucial1 ] ) . in this case is convenient to assign to this equilibrium auto - correlation function a simple analytical form .",

    "( [ geiselcrucial1 ] ) gets the attractive analytical form @xmath74 where @xmath75 thus , in the case @xmath76 , the auto - correlation function of the fluctuations is not integrable .",
    "zumofen and klafter @xcite , in addition to explaining with clear physical arguments the connection between @xmath61 and @xmath67 , established that the laplace transforms of the two functions are related one to the other by @xmath77 this important relation allows us to establish a connection between @xmath78 and @xmath72 , which turns out to be @xmath79    the equivalence between eq .",
    "( [ gerardoisagenius ] ) and eq .",
    "( [ mauroisageniustoo ] ) rests on the key property of eq .",
    "( [ connection ] ) .",
    "we note that if we make the choice of eq .",
    "( [ distributiondensity ] ) then the waiting time distribution @xmath80 loses the simple analytical form of eq . ( [ star ] ) , and viceversa . on the same token , the choice of the analytical form of eq .",
    "( [ distributiondensity ] ) for @xmath60 makes the auto - correlation function @xmath69 lose the analytical form of eq .",
    "( [ autocorrelationfunction ] ) .",
    "however , using the property of eq .",
    "( [ connection ] ) , it is straigthforward to prove that @xmath61 with the form of ( [ distributiondensity ] ) yields , for the auto - ocorrelation function @xmath63 , the following time asymptotic behavior : @xmath81 thus , whatever choice is made , either the analytical form of eq .",
    "( [ distributiondensity ] ) or the analytical form of eq .",
    "( [ star ] ) , in both cases the two waiting time distributions maintain the same time asymptotic behavior , with the same @xmath82 .",
    "so do the two different expressions for the equilibrium auto - autocorrelation functions , the time asymptotic equivalence being the property that matters to study the emergence of fractional derivative .    herein , using the inverse laplace transform of ( [ mauroisageniustoo ] ) we determine the unknown memory kernel @xmath14 , making it possible to discuss how to express the gme in terms of fractional derivatives .",
    "the case where @xmath1 is compared to the recent work of sokolov and metzler @xcite .",
    "we find that the index of the fractional derivative is @xmath83 , rather than @xmath84 , as predicted by sokolov and metzler .",
    "we prove that this difference in index is due to the fact that we adopt a stationary condition , while sokolov and metzler do not .",
    "we also prove that in the case of a finite , rather than infinite age , our gme makes a transition from the @xmath85-th to the @xmath86-th order .",
    "the stationary case becomes stable only in the limiting case of infinite age .",
    "thus , on the one hand we shed light on the meaning of the work of allegrini _ et al . _",
    "@xcite , which is proven to be a subordination to a markov master equation through the stationary distribution of first exit times . on the other hand ,",
    "we extend the approach to systems of any age and reveal the phenomenon of a continuous time random walk with rejuvenation . to accomplish this dual role we rely heavily on the results recently obtained by barkai @xcite and , to a lesser extent , the results of allegrini _ et al .",
    "however , this allows us to reveal some aspects of aging and rejuvenation dependent on the order of fractional derivatives , which were not previously identified .",
    "to establish the form of the unknown memory kernel @xmath14 , we make a few preliminary observations .",
    "first of all , we note that through eq .",

    "thus , the laplace transform of the autocorrelation function is @xcite :    @xmath88    where @xmath89 , given the fact that we are considering @xmath1 , and @xmath90 is the generalized exponential function @xcite@xmath91 thus , @xmath92 diverges as @xmath93 and eq .",
    "( [ lapcorr ] ) yields @xmath94 .",
    "we explore the opposite limit , @xmath95 using eq .",
    "( [ gerardoisagenius ] ) , which yields @xmath96 . in the time representation ,",
    "the latter limit is equivalent to @xmath97 for @xmath98 .",
    "therefore , we segment the laplace transform of the gme memory kernel into two parts as follows @xmath99 the first term models the short - time limit , while the second term is responsible for the long - time behavior . in the time representation",
    "we have @xmath100 note that this division of the memory kernel into a white - noise contribution and a slow term corresponds to a similar partition made by fuliski @xcite .",

    "due to the negative sign on the right - hand term of this equation we conclude that it might well be that @xmath104 is always negative .",

    "( [ kernelgen ] ) , from which we obtain the laplace transform of the memory kernel for an arbitrary age . in fig .",
    "( [ fig3 ] ) we show the laplace transform of the memory kernel corresponding to a number of different ages .",
    "moving from the top to the bottom curve the age increases from the brand new kernel ( @xmath195 ) to the infinitely aged , or stationary kernel ( @xmath196 ) .",
    "in this paper we establish that an infinitely old system , with the power - law index in the interval @xmath197 , yields the fractional order @xmath198 . the prediction of ref .",
    "@xcite , on the other hand , yields the fractional order @xmath84 , corresponding to the brand new condition .",
    "if the system is not infinitely aged , namely @xmath199 , the short - time behavior of the system , for @xmath174 is expected to be that of an aged system . at large observation times ,",
    "@xmath8 , rejuvenation begins . this can be explained using the dynamical model of eq .",
    "( [ ourbath ] ) .",
    "in fact , aging has to do with the slow regression to equilibrium , if it exists , of the variable @xmath176 , which mimics a real bath slowly regressing to equilibrium .",
    "the aging effects discussed by barkai @xcite corresponds to @xmath200 and thus to @xmath201 . in this case",
    "the dynamic model under discussion does not have an invariant distribution , and , consequently , any observation is done while the bath is drifting towards a condition that will be never reached .",
    "this aging effect affects the form of the first exit time distribution , whose index is @xmath202 rather than @xmath0 .",
    "however , after the first exit the trajectories are injected back with a uniform probability , and thus , all the ensuing jumps are determined by the ordinary waiting time distribution @xmath61 .      however , there are technical and conceptual difficulties that make it difficult , if not impossible , to realize this goal . in fact , according to the perspective adopted in this paper , the order of the fractional operator is established using time asymptotic arguments .",
    "thus , if @xmath203 we can associate a time @xmath204 with the order @xmath205 , of the fractional derivative .",
    "this is so because for @xmath174 the calculations would be virtually equivalent to those done in appendix i. it is not clear how to proceed when @xmath45 is is of the order of @xmath163 , this being the first reason why assigning a fractional derivative order to any time might be difficult .",
    "there also exists a physical reason that might make it impossible to move from the order @xmath83 to @xmath84 .",
    "physically this extremely extended transition process might involve a mixture of fractional derivatives of different orders .",
    "it has been shown @xcite that the lvy walk does not have well - defined scaling , due to aging effects .",
    "similarly , the adoption of a fractional time derivative , with time - dependent order , might be inadequate to explore the regime of transition from the order @xmath83 to the order @xmath84 . in conclusion ,",
    "the fractional operator , and its order , reflects a stable condition , of a brand new or infinitely old system .",
    "the regime of transition from the dynamic to any of these two thermodynamic regimes , and the regime of transition from the earlier to the latter thermodynamic regime is not yet a fully understood physical condition , an issue calling for further investigation .",
    "it is interesting to notice that , even if we select @xmath54 , and consequently we adopt a condition compatible with the stationary condition , the effective index of the first exit distribution is located in the non - stationary region , if @xmath114 .",
    "this is probably the reason why the memory kernel seems to share the same properties as those adopted by ref .",
    "@xcite to produce sub - diffusion .",
    "notice that the baths used by lutz @xcite and pottier @xcite have properties quite different from the subordination perspective of ref .",
    "@xcite , even the relaxation process stemming from subordination @xcite is quite similar to that produced by the non - ohmic baths of lutz and pottier .",
    "we hope that the present work might help understanding the connection between the two perspectives .",
    "this is another subject for future research .        in this appendix",
    "we show how to obtain the order of the fractional operator in the gme for @xmath207 , using the laplace transform form for @xmath14 given by eq .",
    "( [ brandnew ] ) . we are referring ourselves to @xmath60 rather than @xmath70 .",
    "thus , for the reasons pointed out in section 2 , we adopt the analytical expression of eq .",
    "( [ distributiondensity ] ) .",
    "we note that for @xmath208 we get a finite value : @xmath209 corresponding to @xmath210 in @xmath45-space .",
    "as done in section 2 , we separate the kernel into two contributions : @xmath211 , and insert the laplace transform of separation into eq .",
