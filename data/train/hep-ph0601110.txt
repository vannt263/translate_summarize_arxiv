    "more than 30 years after the november revolution , charmonium spectroscopy continues to surprise and challenge .",
    "a new era began in april of 2003 when babar announced the discovery of the enigmatic @xmath3 .",
    "since then cleo , belle , fermilab , and bes have joined the scrum , and the number of new states has risen to the double digits .",
    "the formerly comfortable world of heavy quark spectroscopy is being severely tested by new experiment@xcite .",
    "this report summarises the experimental status of eleven new open and hidden charm mesons , @xmath10 , and @xmath11 , and baryons . ] , the challenges these make to our understanding of strong qcd , and the theoretical attempts to meet these challenges .",
    "this report begins with a summary of the new eleven and a review of what is expected in charmonium spectroscopy .",
    "for the latter , several models ( new and old ) are compared to the data , and three models of strong decays are examined .",
    "this serves to illustrate what is known ( and not known ) before examining the new charmonia states . a similar introduction to heavy - light systems",
    "is made in sections iv.a and iv.b .",
    "table [ summarytab ] summarises the contents of this report for the impatient .",
    "a selection of interpretations and theoretical ideas are listed in the ` comments ' column .",
    "theory and more experimental detail can be found in the main text ."
