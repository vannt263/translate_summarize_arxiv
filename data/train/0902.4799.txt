    "this decrease of the bifurcation point continues until zero is reached at the critical value of the gravitational coupling constant , @xmath59 . beyond @xmath60",

    "the corresponding family of curves for the asymptotic value @xmath65 of the gauge field function @xmath66 at infinity ( which can be indentified with the value of the scalar field frequency @xmath27 in the gauge , where the gauge field vanishes at infinity ) is exhibited in fig .",
    "[ qb_om_vs_b0 ] . here",

    "we observe a linear increase of @xmath67 with @xmath0 for the larger values of @xmath0 in regions i and iia , where the slope decreases with increasing @xmath29 , making @xmath67 almost constant for larger values of @xmath29 ( e.g. ,  @xmath68 ) .",
    "while the occurrence of spirals is a typical feature of boson star solutions @xcite , the present sets of solutions exhibit a for boson stars new phenomenon , namely the formation of throats . as a throat",
    "is formed , the minimum of the metric function @xmath69 tends to zero , and the zero is reached precisely at the outer radius @xmath1 . at the same time the metric function @xmath70 tends to a step function , that vanishes inside @xmath1 , and assumes the asymptotic value @xmath71 outside @xmath1 .",

    "[ qb_mvs_q ] , this relation is precisely satisfied , when @xmath75 . thus a throat is formed , when in a set of solutions the value @xmath39 of the gauge field function tends to zero . in fact",
    ", the function @xmath66 then tends to zero in the whole region @xmath76 , and its derivative @xmath77 does so as well .",
    "however , at @xmath1 the derivative @xmath77 jumps to a finite value , necessary for the coulomb fall - off of a solution with charge @xmath0 .",
    "finally we note , that the sets of boson star solutions with fixed gravitational coupling constant @xmath29 satisfy a mass relation .",
    "this relation is based on the observation , that @xmath78 shown to hold for the regular solutions in flat space @xcite . since ( [ mreg2 ] ) continues to hold for the gravitating solutions , integration yields the mass relation @xmath79 where the mass @xmath80 of a regular solution with charge @xmath81 is obtained by integrating from any regular solution @xmath82 with charge @xmath83 along the curve of intermediate solutions of the set .",
    "let us next consider the gravitating shell - like solutions . here",
    "the space - time consists of 3 parts . in the inner part @xmath84",
    "the gauge potential is constant and the scalar field vanishes .",
    "consequently , it is minkowski - like , with @xmath85 and @xmath86 .",
    "the middle region @xmath3 then represents the shell of charged bosonic matter , while the outer region @xmath87 corresponds to part of a reissner - nordstrm space - time , where the gauge field exhibits the standard coulomb fall - off , while the scalar field vanishes identically .",
    "this behaviour of the functions is demonstrated in fig .",

    "as this happens , the value of @xmath42 reaches zero ( or equivalently @xmath90 , since @xmath66 is constant in the interior , @xmath91 ) .",
    "the exterior space - time @xmath92 then corresponds to the exterior of an extremal rn space - time .",
    "thus in contrast to @xmath0-shells in flat space , which grow rapidly in size , mass and charge as the ratio @xmath93 , the growth of gravitating @xmath0-shells is limited by gravity , and the restriction in size , mass and charge is the stronger , the greater the value of the gravitational coupling constant @xmath29 .",
    "this is demonstrated in figs .",
    "[ qs_r0_vs_b1 ] , [ qbs_m_vs_b1 ] and [ qs_mq_vs_b1 ] , where the outer radius @xmath1 , the mass @xmath46 and the charge @xmath0 are exhibited for a sequence of values of the gravitational coupling constant .    in fig .",
    "[ qbs_m_vs_b1 ] for comparison also the mass of the corresponding boson star solutions ( resp .",
    "@xmath0-ball solutions for vanishing gravitational coupling constant ) are exhibited .",
    "the transitions from the ball - like to the shell - like solutions are indicated in the figure by the small asterisks . with increasing @xmath29 the sets of shell - like solutions decrease rapidly , until at the critical value @xmath60 ( see fig .",
    "[ phasediag ] ) they cease to exist .",

    "consequently the mass relation holds for any two globally regular solutions of a set with given gravitational coupling constant , thus relating also ball - like and shell - like solutions .",
    "let us finally address black holes in this model .",
    "the simplest type of black holes is obtained , when the minkowski - like inner part of the space - time , @xmath91 , of gravitating @xmath0-shell solutions is replaced by the inner part of a curved schwarzschild - like space - time .",
    "the metric in the interior region @xmath91 is then determined by the function @xmath97 and a constant function @xmath70 .",
    "thus the event horizon resides at @xmath36 .",
    "but the presence of the @xmath0-shell outside the event horizon , makes the properties of the black hole differ from those of a pure schwarzschild black hole .    since with the event horizon size a further variable appears , which is an important physical quantity , we discuss the black hole properties with respect to the horizon radius @xmath4 in the following .",
    "the metric and matter field functions for black holes with charge @xmath88 at gravitational coupling @xmath89 are exhibited in fig .",
    "[ fun ] for several values of the horizon radius @xmath4 .    to illustrate the domain of existence of such black hole solutions",
    ", we again choose a sequence of values for the gravitational coupling constant , but we now keep the charge @xmath0 fixed , as we vary the horizon radius , starting from the corresponding globally regular @xmath0-shell solution . a respective set of solutions",
    "is shown in fig .",
    "[ bh1 ] for @xmath9810 and 100 .",
    "first of all we note , that the horizon radius is always limited in size , where the maximal size grows with the charge @xmath0 . for small @xmath0 , e.g.  @xmath9810 ,",
    "we observe two distinct patterns for the black hole solutions .",
    "the first pattern arises when the fixed gravitational coupling constant has a value below a certain critical value . here",
    "a maximal horizon size is reached , when the horizon radius @xmath4 gets close to the inner radius of the shell @xmath2 .",
    "there a bifurcation occurs and a second branch emerges , which ends at a second bifurcation , where a third branch emerges , etc .",
    "this results in a spiralling pattern , where the mass @xmath46 and the temperature @xmath99 of the solutions tend towards finite limiting values .",
    "( the first few branches are apparent in fig .",
    "[ bhq10_b1_vs_rh ] , and enlarged in the inlet for a representative value of the gravitational coupling constant , @xmath100 , while the higher branches are too small to be resolved there . )    the second pattern is present above that critical value of the coupling constant . here",
    "the set of black hole solutions for fixed gravitational coupling ends , when a throat is formed at the outer shell radius @xmath1 .",
    "there the condition for extremal rn solutions , @xmath96 , is satisfied again , as seen in figs .",
    "[ bhq10_m_vs_rh ] and [ bhq100_m_vs_rh ] . as the throat forms",
    ", the temperature @xmath99 at the event horizon of the schwarzschild - like black hole @xmath36 tends to zero , as seen in figs .",
    "[ bhq10_t_vs_rh ] and [ bhq100_t_vs_rh ] .",
    "while appearing at first unexpected , the reason for the vanishing of the temperature @xmath99 is the behaviour of the metric function @xmath70 in @xmath101 , since @xmath70 tends to zero in the interior , when the throat is formed , as seen in fig .",
    "we recall , that the ratio of the temperature @xmath99 of the black hole within the @xmath0-shell to the temperature @xmath102 of the schwarzschild black hole is given by @xmath103 .    for larger ( fixed ) values of the charge",
    "we always observe this second pattern , although the throat may either be reached directly after a monotonic increase of the horizon radius @xmath4 to its maximum value , or along a second branch , where the horizon radius is decreasing again ( having passed a bifurcation ) , as seen in fig",
    ".  [ bhq100_b1_vs_rh ] .",
    "as seen in the figure , whenever bifurcations occur , there are two ( or more ) black hole space - times with the same value of the charge @xmath0 and the same horizon radius @xmath4 ( within a certain range of values ) , but different values of the total mass @xmath46 as measured at infinity . surprisingly , however , there are also two ( or more ) black hole space - times with the same value of the charge @xmath0 and the same value of the total mass @xmath46 ( within a certain range of values ) .",
    "these black holes thus have the same set of global charges but are otherwise distinct solutions of the einstein - matter equations .",
    "consequently black hole uniqueness does not hold in this model of scalar electrodynamics .",
    "let us finally consider some mass relations for these black holes space - times possessing @xmath0-shells .",
    "we begin by recalling an interesting result obtained in the isolated horizon framework @xcite .",
    "it states that the mass @xmath46 of a black hole space - time with horizon radius @xmath4 and the mass @xmath104 of the corresponding globally regular space - time obtained in the limit @xmath105 are related via @xcite @xmath106 where the mass contribution @xmath107 is defined by @xmath108 here @xmath109 represents the surface gravity of the black hole with horizon radius @xmath4 , @xmath110 .",
    "accordingly , the mass @xmath46 of a space - time with a black hole with horizon radius @xmath4 within a @xmath0-shell with total charge @xmath0 should be obtained as the sum of the globally regular gravitating @xmath0-shell with charge @xmath0 and the integral @xmath107 along the set of black hole space - times , obtained by increasing the horizon radius for fixed charge from zero to @xmath4 .",
    "this relation is demonstrated in fig .",
    "[ figiso1 ] for the set of solutions with charge @xmath88 and gravitational coupling constant @xmath100 .",
    "the values for the mass @xmath46 obtained from the relation ( [ ihmud ] ) are seen to agree with the values for the black hole mass @xmath46 obtained from the asymptotics ( [ mass ] ) .",
    "the set of solutions exhibited has spiralling character , i.e. , it has besides the main first branch a second branch , also exhibited , and further branches , not resolved in the figure .",
    "when the charge is allowed to vary , too , one expects a change of the above relation in accordance with ( [ mreg2 ] ) and the first law ( in the units empoyed ) , i.e. , @xmath111 where @xmath112 denotes the area of the horizon and @xmath65 represents the electrostatic potential at infinity .",
    "thus we generalize the above relation ( [ ihmu ] ) to read @xmath113 this relation is demonstrated in fig .",
    "[ figiso2 ] , where for several values of the gravitational coupling constant and for fixed ratio of inner and outer shell radii @xmath43 , the values for the mass @xmath46 obtained from the relation ( [ ihmudq2 ] ) are shown together with the values for the mass @xmath46 obtained from the asymptotics ( [ mass ] ) .",
    "we have considered boson stars , gravitating @xmath0-shells and black holes within @xmath0-shells in scalar electrodynamics with a @xmath114-shaped scalar potential , where the scalar field is finite only in compact ball - like or shell - like regions .",
    "the gravitating @xmath0-shells surround a flat minkoswki - like interior region , while their exterior represents part of an exterior rn space - time .",
    "when the flat interior is replaced by a schwarzschild - like interior , black hole space - times result , where a schwarzschild - like black hole is surrounded by a compact shell of charged matter , whose exterior again represents part of an exterior rn space - time .",
    "these black hole space - times violate black hole uniqueness , in certain regions of parameter space . here for the same values of the mass @xmath46 and the charge @xmath0 two or more distinct solutions of the einstein - matter equations exist .",
    "the solutions satisfy certain relations of the type obtained first in the isolated horizon formalism , which connect the mass @xmath46 of a black hole solution with the mass @xmath104 of the associated globally regular solution .",
    "the masses of two regular solutions are related in an analogous ( simpler ) manner .",
    "this formalism further suggests to interpret the black hole space - times as bound states of schwarzschild - type black holes and gravitating @xmath0-shells @xcite .    while we have restricted our discussion here to schwarzschild - type black holes in the interior , there are also black hole space - times with charged , i.e. , reissner - nordstrm - type interior solutions . these more general black hole space - times will be discussed elsewhere .",
    "the inclusion of rotation presents another interesting generalization of the solution considered here , since rotating boson stars are well - known @xcite .",
    "the construction of the corresponding rotating shells and their black hole generalizations , however , still poses a challenge .",

    "<S> the boson stars come in two types , having either ball - like or shell - like charge density . </S>",
    "<S> we analyze the properties of these solutions and determine their domains of existence . </S>",
    "<S> when mass and charge become equal , the space - times develop a throat . </S>",
    "<S> the shell - like solutions need not be globally regular , but may possess a horizon . </S>",
    "<S> the space - times then consist of a schwarzschild - type black hole in the interior , surrounded by a shell of charged matter , and thus a reissner - nordstrm - type space - time in the exterior . </S>",
    "<S> these solutions violate black hole uniqueness . </S>",
    "<S> the mass of the black hole solutions is related to the mass of the regular shell - like solutions by a mass formula of the type first obtained within the isolated horizon framework . </S>"
