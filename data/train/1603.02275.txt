    "-type and @xmath17-type four - body interactions on alternate plaquettes of a square lattice , and the ( exact ) ribbon operators are the string - like products of @xmath18 and @xmath17 shown above .",
    "these ribbon operators commute with the hamiltonian terms but anticommute with each other , thus identifying a phase with @xmath19 topological order.,title=\"fig : \" ]    in this section , we review the physical properties of anyon models that characterize a topological phase . of course",
    ", not all topological phases have an associated anyon model , for example the cubic code,@xcite however we will tailor our method to those phases with anyonic excitations .",
    "this discussion of anyon models will motivate our definition in the subsequent section of a _ ribbon operator _ for a spin model defined by some local hamiltonian @xmath20 on a lattice in two dimensions .",
    "we will argue that this definition captures the essential features outlined below of a topologically ordered model by thinking about anyons as quasiparticle excitations of the spin model .",
    "the simplest realization of this is kitaev s toric code,@xcite and we will refer to that model to clarify key features .",
    "creating a pair of anyons , and moving them to the boundary of the lattice leaves no excitations , and so maps the vacuum to the vacuum . in the toric code , anyons are created and transported using string operators , as shown in fig .  [ fig : toricstrings ] .",
    "these operators commute with the hamiltonian in the bulk , but have excitations localized to the ends . in this way , if the anyons are moved off the edge of the lattice or are fused together , the system remains in its ground state .    more generally , we expect anyonic excitations to be particle like , but to have nontrivial braiding relations . on sufficiently large length scales , it is expected that these braid statistics are governed solely by an anyon model.@xcite for this reason , the creation operators in this limit should be one dimensional with the particles localized around the end points .",
    "away from a renormalization - group fixed point , we expect these operators to be dressed , and supported on slightly fattened regions , though still effectively one - dimensional .",
    "more precisely , the width of these ribbons should be set by the microscopic details of the model , and should not scale with system size .",
    "the family of local commuting projector codes ( lcpc ) generalizes the toric code and provides a concrete instantiation of these ideas .",
    "the lcpcs are families of hamiltonians where the terms are pairwise commuting projectors onto an unfrustrated ground state . in these models",
    "the string operators described above always exist.@xcite this class of models includes exactly solvable points of most known topological phases@xcite including the levin - wen string nets.@xcite away from these exactly solvable points , we can dress the string operators using quasiadiabatic continuation.@xcite given a point in a phase for which an initial string operator exists , such as an lcpc , we can dress this operator to any other point in the phase .",
    "generically this operator will have extensive support , however the error made in truncating the width is exponentially small in @xmath21 , where @xmath22 is the width and @xmath23 is the correlation length .",
    "thus string - like operators with width proportional to the correlation length can be found anywhere within the phase .",
    "since the string operators act as creation operators for pairs of anyons , we argue that they should be only slightly entangling operators.@xcite these are operators whose schmidt rank is independent of the system size on any bipartition that cuts the string into two contiguous pieces . in the lcpc case ,",
    "the string operators are known to be slightly entangling.@xcite since the quasiparticles are simply dressed by moving away from these fixed points , we expect this property to remain throughout the phase ; although the required schmidt rank can increase substantially , it will still be independent of the system size .",
    "when we remove the dressed quasiparticles from the lattice ( by annihilating them or bringing them out to infinity ) , the system returns to its ground space , which is expected to obey the area law of eq .",
    "( [ eqn : arealaw ] ) .",
    "this also supports the slightly entangling nature of such operators .",
    "some of the defining features of an anyon model are the relations that are encoded in the topological @xmath15 matrix and the @xmath24 matrices .",
    "let @xmath25 label the anyonic particles in the anyon model describing the low energy excitations of the hamiltonian @xmath26 .",
    "the @xmath24 matrices are defined by @xmath27 and the @xmath15 matrix is @xmath28 where the lines trace out the worldlines of the particles .",
    "another approach is to consider the related @xmath29 matrix that can be obtained via the twist product.@xcite if the @xmath15 matrix is an object that captures dynamical information from braiding anyons in 2 + 1 dimensions , then the @xmath29 matrix is a static object that captures correlations of ground states in 2 + 0 dimensions .",
    "if @xmath30 is an operator supported on an annulus that projects onto a state with total charge @xmath31 inside , then @xmath32 where @xmath33 is any ground state of the spin model . for bipartite operators @xmath34 and @xmath35 , the twist product with respect to the partition @xmath36",
    "is defined as @xmath37 where the order is reversed on the @xmath38 region relative to the @xmath39 partition .",
    "this is clearly closely related to eq .",
    "( [ eqn : smatrix ] ) , where the worldline loops are replaced by the corresponding closed loop operators on the lattice . for abelian models where @xmath40 for all particle types @xmath31 , the @xmath15 and @xmath29 matrices coincide up to a multiple of @xmath41 .",
    "finally , anyonic quasiparticles should be able to move around the lattice , and the state should not depend upon any smooth deformations of the path they take .",
    "in particular , when they are fused back together or moved off the lattice , the system should return to a vacuum state .",
    "this is realized in the toric code since the string operators can be deformed by dressing with local operators that are symmetries of the hamiltonian .",
    "this preserves commutativity with @xmath26 and the @xmath29 matrix and clearly creates the same particle at the ends .",
    "let us summarize the physical intuition that we ve gained in the previous section into a few simple properties that the string - like operators seem to possess in general .",
    "these properties hold for known exactly solvable models with to .",
    "given a two - dimensional quantum system with to , we expect that there are operators @xmath2 supported on one - dimensional strips through the bulk where the following four properties hold , at least approximately :    1 .",
    "@xmath2 commutes with the bulk hamiltonian in the low energy sector.[item : commuting ] 2 .",
    "@xmath2 is supported on a strip of spins with bounded width @xmath22.[item : bounded ] 3 .",
    "distinct ribbons @xmath2 and @xmath42 should respect the data ( e.g.  the @xmath24 or @xmath15 matrix ) for an underlying anyon model in the low energy sector.[item : logical ] 4 .",
    "@xmath2 is smoothly deformable , that is , the ability to satisfy [ item : commuting]-[item : logical ] should not depend on the chosen strip of spins defining the support of @xmath2 , given sufficient width.[item : deformable ]    since finding a low energy projector appears to be a challenging task , we make the following assumption . rather than asking",
    "for [ item : commuting]-[item : deformable ] to hold only in the low energy sector , we ask for them to hold on the whole spectrum . at first glance",
    ", this seems to be too strong for characterizing to away from an exactly solvable rg fixed point .",
    "nonetheless , by making this assumption , we can arrive at an effective numerical procedure for detecting to in 2d models .",
    "moreover , in sec .",
    "[ s : heuristic ] , we provide a heuristic physical justification of this assumption , and some natural avenues for relaxing it in sec .  [ s : future ] .",
    "here we introduce what we call the ribbon operator method for detecting to .",
    "the strategy is simple : we will write a cost function that tries to satisfy the above requirements simultaneously . since the support of a string - like operator is on a 1d strip , and is expected to be only slightly entangling , we will use the ansatz class of mpos@xcite to describe candidate operators .",
    "we will then use the highly successful methods of 1d systems such as dmrg@xcite for optimizing over this ansatz class to find the lowest cost mpo .",
    "we can then _ define _ a ribbon operator as any mpo supported on any one - dimensional strip of some fixed width . by drawing on the lattice hamiltonian and an underlying anyon model",
    ", we can define a cost function quantifying the fitness of candidate ribbons given the above criteria .",
    "a _ good _ ribbon operator then corresponds to a local minimum of the cost function .",
    "there is clearly considerable scope within this method for how to use it .",
    "the art will be to choose a cost function that is tractable to optimize and gives clear signals of to when appropriate , such that the distinction between which local minima are `` good '' and `` bad '' is obvious .",
    "we do not claim to have a unique or best choice of cost function or optimization routine .",
    "the remainder of this section details one particular choice of cost function , and as we show in sec .",
    "[ s : results ] this particular choice performs quite well for a variety of simple models .",
    "we now define our proposed cost function that quantifies how well a candidate ribbon satisfies the above criteria .",
    "let @xmath20 be some local hamiltonian and @xmath2 some candidate ribbon with @xmath43 ( the schatten 2-norm , or frobenius norm @xmath44 ) and width @xmath22 , which ideally should be chosen to be comparable to the correlation length .",
    "we will also use the symbol @xmath2 to denote the region of support of the ribbon @xmath2 since no confusion should result .",
    "the first condition is that the ribbon should commute with the hamiltonian of the model .",
    "this gives us two terms in the cost function .",
    "we can quantify the violation of this condition using @xmath45}\\right\\rvert}^2 $ ] .",
    "this can be decomposed into two distinct contributions by writing the hamiltonian as @xmath46 where the first term contains hamiltonian terms whose support is completely within the support of @xmath2 , the second contains those whose support has no overlap with @xmath2 and are hence supported entirely in the complementary region @xmath47 .",
    "the final sum contains all those terms in the hamiltonian with support on both @xmath2 and @xmath47 .",
    "clearly the second term trivially commutes with @xmath2 as a consequence of our second condition .",
    "commutation with the first term can not be simplified further .",
    "however , the term on the boundary @xmath48 can be simplified as follows .",
    "let @xmath49 be some term on the boundary of the ribbon . then using the operator schmidt decomposition , we can split the operator @xmath49 into a sum over interior and exterior components @xmath50 where @xmath51 .    using the orthonormality of the @xmath52 terms and the definition of the frobenius norm , we find that @xmath53}\\right\\rvert}^2&={\\left\\lvert\\sum_k{\\left[r , h_{j , k}^{\\text{in}}\\right]}\\otimes h_{j , k}^{\\text{out}}\\right\\rvert}^2\\nonumber\\\\    & = \\sum_k{\\left\\lvert{\\left[r , h_{j , k}^{\\text{in}}\\right]}\\otimes h_{j , k}^{\\text{out}}\\right\\rvert}^2\\nonumber\\\\    & = \\sum_k { \\left\\lvert{\\left[r , h_{j , k}^{\\text{in}}\\right]}\\right\\rvert}^2,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] by appropriate grouping of boundary terms , we can ensure that @xmath54 .",

    "[ fig : toricstrings ] .",
    "( we will discuss how to relax this prior - knowledge assumption below . )",
    "we can incorporate anyon data with the following term in the cost function , @xmath58}_\\eta\\bigr\\|^2&={\\left\\lvertrl-\\eta lr\\right\\rvert}^2\\,,\\label{eqn : etacomm}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath59 is a complex number different from 1 .",
    "this choice of topological term in the cost function intuitively reminds us of the @xmath24 matrix relations of eq .",
    "( [ eqn : rmatrix ] ) .",
    "we can see that such a term is in fact sufficient to give a nontrivial @xmath24 matrix as follows . here",
    "we specialize to an abelian model , but the discussion could be generalized . using the @xmath24 matrix relation for an abelian model with a fixed total anyon charge @xmath60",
    ", we have the relation @xmath61 thus if @xmath62 then @xmath63 and @xmath64 can not both be 1 .",
    "note that in the abelian case , @xmath65 can be written as@xcite @xmath66 , so @xmath59 is related to the @xmath15 matrix and is therefore gauge invariant ( invariant under a change of basis of the fusion space ) .",
    "since the anyon charge @xmath10 is fixed already by the labels @xmath31 and @xmath67 in an abelian model , this switching relation should hold even when considering this as just a different operator product order , analogous to the case of a twist product for the @xmath29 matrix : @xmath68    since there are many equivalent strips on which @xmath42 and @xmath2 can be supported , the cost should be computed for all possible intersection regions .",
    "this is achieved by summing @xmath69}_\\eta\\bigr\\|^2 $ ] over all translates of @xmath42 , labelled @xmath70 , that lead to an inequivalent intersection with @xmath2 .",
    "this translation invariance gives us an additional motivation for our choice of topological term : we can use translation - invariant mpos in our optimization routines . by comparison , an _ a priori",
    "_ equally attractive term would be to encode the @xmath15 matrix relations , but then finite - size effects from the periodic boundary conditions might add additional complications to the numerics .",
    "now , we define the @xmath59-_cost _ of a ribbon @xmath2 given some fixed secondary ribbon @xmath42 as @xmath71}\\right\\rvert}^2+&\\sum_{j , k\\in\\partial r}{\\left\\lvert{\\left[r , h^{\\text{in}}_{j , k}\\right]}\\right\\rvert}^2 \\nonumber\\\\ & + \\sum_{\\mathcal{t}(l)}\\bigl\\|{\\left[r , l\\right]}_\\eta\\bigr\\|^2\\biggr),\\label{eqn : costfunction}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath5 is the number of spins on which @xmath2 is supported .",

    "the normalization term is chosen so that the cost of a ribbon is approximately independent of the volume .",
    "one could consider summing these two terms to build a total cost function for the pair of ribbons , however we linearize the problem for a fixed @xmath42 ( or fixed @xmath2 ) and instead do an alternating minimization algorithm .    in the case of the exact toric code , the form of the cost function is relatively simple and gives a concrete instantiation of the translation operation @xmath74 .",
    "it is easy to check that the standard logical operators of this code have zero @xmath59-cost when @xmath75 , as expected .",
    "we present the explicit cost function derivation in appendix [ s : costfunc ] for illustration .",
    "although this cost function only involves a pair of ribbons , it is possible to incorporate braid relations with other particle types by adding terms of the form of eq .",
    "( [ eqn : etacomm ] ) with additional ribbon operators . in this way",
    ", it is possible to completely reconstruct the @xmath15 matrix of the anyon model up to a column permutation .",
    "this ambiguity is due to the difficulty of identifying equivalence of operators on incomparable supports ( i.e.  those with vertical and horizontal supports in fig .",
    "[ fig : toricstrings ] ) .",
    "we discuss possible avenues to removing this freedom in sec .",
    "[ s : future ] .",
    "as discussed in sec .  [ s : ribbons ] , a key assumption which enables our method to be numerically efficient is that the commutation relations , which are expected to hold only on a topologically ordered ground space , hold on the entire spectrum . while this appears to be a very strong assumption , we believe that our method should continue to work even when this assumption breaks . in this section , we will provide a physically motivated , heuristic justification for this assumption .    at high energies ,",
    "we expect a gas of short - range interacting anyons .",
    "when ribbon operators are used to create additional anyons , braid them , and fuse them in a specific way , the resulting process will in general be affected by the presence of the background anyon gas .",
    "specifically , the expectation value of the braid can be affected by 1 ) dynamical phases acquired from short range interactions with the background anyons , and 2 ) topological terms caused by the background anyons enclosed in the braid . to eliminate these effects , we need to make sure that 1 ) there are no background anyons near the support of the ribbon operator , and 2 ) the topological charge enclosed in the braid is trivial .",
    "it happens that both of these conditions can be enforced with small width operators .",
    "indeed , 1 ) requires projecting on the local ground state ( lgs ) , i.e.  the subspace with no charges .",
    "similarly , it is possible to fix the topological charge of a region using an operator which acts only on the boundary of this region and is described by a finite bond dimension mpo.@xcite let @xmath76 denote the corresponding projector .",
    "suppose that @xmath2 is an mpo ribbon operator which obeys the right commutation relations on the ground space , but not on the entire spectrum .",
    "then , @xmath77 should be a slightly wider and larger - bond - dimension mpo ribbon operator which obeys the commutation on the entire spectrum . thus , while our approach can not find @xmath2 , it should be able to find @xmath78 without any assumptions .",
    "we stress that the above argument is not key to our method , and no ground state projectors are incorporated directly in our algorithm or in the numerical results presented in sec .",
    "[ s : results ] .",
    "one could alter the method to explicitly make use of information about the low energy space .",
    "we discuss this further in sec .",
    "[ s : future ] .",
    "in many exactly solvable models , an analytic form for the ribbon operators can be found . in more general models , for example ones with a noncommuting hamiltonian",
    ", the ribbons must be found numerically . in this section ,",
    "we describe how to find ribbon operators using dmrg.@xcite    we parameterize a width @xmath22 ribbon by a block - translationally invariant infinite mpo .",
    "this mpo is `` snaked '' along the support of the ribbon to cover the two - dimensional region .",
    "that is , the coordinates of the ribbon are treated in a linearized lexicographic order moving along the ribbon lengthwise .",
    "this mpo can be vectorized , i.e.  interpreted as a vector instead of a matrix .",
    "an mpo is also built for the cost function , with the same snaking pattern , and standard dmrg can then be applied to find the ribbon that minimizes the constraints .",
    "this vectorization procedure corresponds to the following transformation , written in tensor network diagram notation : @xmath79 given any operator @xmath80 in mpo form , we can explicitly write the form of the constraint term @xmath81}\\right\\rvert}^2 $ ] for one site of the mpo as @xmath82 by concatenating this expression and closing the boundaries appropriately , we see that this is equivalent to the expectation of some mpo for some matrix product `` state '' given by the vectorization of @xmath2 .",
    "the total cost function can be obtained by summing up the mpos defining each cost term , corresponding to direct sum on the mpo matrices .",
    "the cost function mpo will not generally correspond to a local hamiltonian , which is the regime where dmrg is usually applied . indeed , due to the squaring required on the internal commutator",
    ", we will have terms like @xmath83 for every pair @xmath84 . despite this potential challenge",
    ", we will demonstrate that dmrg is an effective algorithm for this minimization .",
    "we attempt to optimize @xmath85 for various choices of @xmath59 .",
    "in particular , we restrict ourselves to the unit disk as this is sufficient for the models below , although extending to other @xmath59 does not change any of the results obtained .    when attempting to optimize a pair , we used alternating minimization .",
    "first @xmath86 was minimized in the presence of a random @xmath87 .",
    "then @xmath88 was optimized given the @xmath89 obtained from the previous optimization .",
    "the @xmath87 obtained was then used to seed the next iteration .",
    "this process was repeated until convergence .    for each choice of @xmath59 , several ( usually 5 or 10 ) ribbons or pairs of ribbons were optimized from random initial pairs and the lowest cost pair was retained .",
    "this proved necessary to avoid premature convergence to a local minimum , particularly in the alternating minimization , leading to a pair that was orthogonal to the optimal solution . in most cases",
    "a total of 5 - 10 restarts appeared sufficient to ensure that an optimal pair was obtained .",
    "for each value of @xmath59 , an independent random start was generated , rather than using a warm start from the previous nearby values of @xmath59 .",
    "in this section we use ribbon operators to study several standard models that exhibit both topologically ordered and trivial phases .",
