    "this interplay between competing phases is also partly observed in the electron - doped cuprate htscs nd@xmath13ce@xmath14cuo@xmath4 ( ncco ) , @xcite and in the fe - based high-@xmath1 superconductors @xcite as well as in the newly discovered ti - based @xcite superconductors .    unlike the hole - doped cuprate htscs , the electron - doped cuprate htscs @xmath21m@xmath14cuo@xmath4 ( rmco , @xmath22 = nd , pr , eu , sm , la ; m = ce , th ) @xcite show a larger area of antiferromagnetism with no pseudogap phase in the underdoped regime of the phase diagram , @xcite have a substantially lower value of @xmath1 ( optimal @xmath1 @xmath23 25 k ) , and have a smaller value of upper critical field ( @xmath24 ) @xcite than their hole - doped counterparts .",
    "these differences suggest @xcite the significance of the antiferromagnetic spin fluctuations which are related to the internal magnetic field environment at the cu site . on the other hand , in structure they have a slightly longer in - plane cu - o bond length that might be associated with their lack of apical oxygen for the t@xmath25-structure of their crystal lattice , in contrast to the t - structure of their hole - doped counterpart in lsco .",
    "@xcite this difference in the lattice structure may also have a direct impact on the internal electric and magnetic field environment at the copper which could ultimately determine their spin fluctuations and electron paring .",
    "@xcite therefore , it is important to study the internal electric and magnetic field at the copper in the cuo@xmath16-plane in these materials .",
    "moreover , this local field environment reveals their intrinsic properties , including the sources of the charge and spin dynamics @xcite of the cu-3d conduction electrons .",
    "nmr ( nuclear magnetic resonance ) has played a key role in these local field determinations , with intensive studies carried on the hole - doped cuprate htscs .",
    "@xcite for example , recent nmr studies of the internal static electric and magnetic field on lsco @xcite and ybco @xcite have found co , where the hole - doped charges are modulating around the vortex cores , providing evidence of co that competes with the superconductivity and suggesting a possible relationship to the electron paring .",

    ", nmr measurements on powder samples @xcite of pr@xmath13ce@xmath14cuo@xmath4 ( pcco , @xmath26 = 0.10 , 0.15 and 0.20 ) by williams @xmath12 were focusing on spin dynamic properties and show conflicting aspects , such as no doping dependence of the @xmath27cu - nmr spin - lattice relaxation as a reflection of the internal magnetic field fluctuations at the copper , which are against the widely accepted theoretical predictions .",
    "@xcite thus the intrinsic properties of the electron - doped cuprate htscs remain elusive .",
    "since single crystals have lots of advantages over powder samples , it is necessary to examine these properties using single crystals .",
    "recent nmr measurements @xcite on single crystals of pcco show the effect of doping to the number of hole contents in the cu 3d and o 2p orbitals and to the @xmath27cu - nmr quadrupole splitting frequency . however the important information regarding the distribution of the spectrum satellites and their temperature dependence is still missing .    in this paper , we report @xmath0cu - nmr spectroscopy and knight shift measurements on a single crystal of the electron - doped cuprate htsc pcco with an applied magnetic field ( @xmath5 ) up to 26.42 t , at which the superconductivity at @xmath5 @xmath6 @xmath7 is completely suppressed , @xcite so that the normal state static local field properties at the copper can be evaluated down to low temperatures .",
    "our main results are that a very small nqr frequency @xmath28 @xmath23 2.2 mhz is obtained with the observation of an unusual @xmath0cu - nmr spectrum , which shows a very small electric field gradient ( efg ) ( corresponding to the value of @xmath28 ) and an extremely wide continuous distribution of it ( @xmath29 @xmath23 18 mhz ) at the copper site in pcco .",

    "the central linewidth are proportional to @xmath5 with a high anisotropy .",
    "we find that the magnitude of the internal static magnetic field at the copper is dominated by the anisotropic cu@xmath9 3@xmath10-orbital contributions , but its weak temperature ( @xmath30 ) dependence is mainly determined by the isotropic contact hyperfine coupling to the paramagnetic pr@xmath11 electron spins , which also generates essentially the full distribution of the internal static magnetic field at the copper at @xmath5 @xmath8 @xmath7 .",
    "this internal static electric and magnetic field environment at the copper in the electron - doped cuprate htscs is very different from that in their hole - doped counterparts , where there is no evidence of a contribution from ions with a large spin paramagnetic moment .",
    "the high quality single crystal of pcco ( optimal - doped ) was grown with a flux technique @xcite and annealed in argon at 900 @xmath31c for 48 h. the sample size is 1.5 mm @xmath32 1.2 mm @xmath32 35 @xmath33 m with a mass of 0.53 mg .",

    "finally , the parameters for the energy splitting of the cu@xmath9 3@xmath10 orbitals in the cuo@xmath16-plane can be obtained @xcite through the orbital knight shift anisotropy as @xcite @xmath136 where @xmath137 , @xmath138 , @xmath139 , and @xmath140 are the energy levels of the cu@xmath9 d@xmath141 , d@xmath142 , d@xmath143 and d@xmath144 orbitals , respectively .    by using the obtained anisotropy ratio of @xmath120/@xmath123 = 4.6 @xmath44 0.1",
    ", we have the energy state of the cu@xmath9 3@xmath10-electrons as @xmath145 , i.e. , @xmath146 .",
    "this agrees well with the theoretical calculation @xcite and observation @xcite regarding the cu@xmath9 3@xmath10-orbital energy levels of @xmath138 , @xmath139 and @xmath137 relative to the ground level @xmath140 , suggesting a similar high anisotropy of the cu@xmath9 3@xmath10 orbital shift and similar electronic energy state of the cu@xmath9 electron itself in the cuo@xmath16-plane to those in the hole - doped cuprate htscs .",
    "in summary , a very small nqr frequency @xmath28 @xmath23 2.2 mhz is obtained with the observation of an unusual @xmath0cu - nmr spectrum , which shows a very small electric field gradient ( efg ) and an extremely wide continuous distribution of it ( @xmath29 @xmath23 18 mhz ) at the copper in pcco . upon cooling in temperature ,",
    "the distribution of efg becomes significantly narrower below 20 k at @xmath5 @xmath6 @xmath7 where the superconductivity is completely suppressed , indicating a significant change in the charge distribution modulation at the cu site .",
    "other experimental techniques are needed to verify whether this is due to co or a different type of charge distribution modulation .",
    "the @xmath43cu - nmr knight shift and the central linewidth are proportional to the externally applied magnetic field , with an orbital shift anisotropy of @xmath23 4.6 .",
    "we find that the magnitude of the internal static magnetic field at the copper at both @xmath5 @xmath8 @xmath7 and @xmath5 @xmath6 @xmath7 is dominated by the @xmath30-independent anisotropic hyperfine coupling to the cu@xmath9 3@xmath10 orbitals , while its weak @xmath30-dependence is mainly determined by the isotropic contact hyperfine coupling to the paramagnetic pr@xmath11 electron spins , which is also responsible for the full distribution of the internal static magnetic field at the copper at @xmath5 @xmath8 @xmath7 . but at @xmath5 @xmath6 @xmath7 , the distribution of the internal static magnetic field at the copper is dominated by the cu@xmath9 3@xmath10-orbital contributions through anisotropic hyperfine couplings .",
    "thus , unlike the cu@xmath9 3d orbitals , the cu@xmath9 spins provide a small contribution to the internal static magnetic field at the copper in pcco .",
    "this unusual internal static electric and magnetic field environment at the copper in cuprate htscs may provide new insight into the understanding of the high-@xmath1 superconductivity .",
