    "the interaction of gravitational waves ( gw ) with the plasma and/or the electromagnetic waves propagating inside the plasma , has been studied extensively @xcite . all well known approaches for the study of the wave - plasma interaction",
    "have been used , namely the vlasov - maxwell equations @xcite , the mhd equations @xcite and the non - linear evolution of charged particles interacting with a monochromatic gw @xcite .",
    "the vlasov - maxwell equations and the mhd equations were mainly used to investigate the linear coupling of the gw with the normal modes of the ambient plasma , but the normal mode analysis is a valid approximation only when the gw is relatively weak and the orbits of the charged particles are assumed to remain close to the undisturbed ones .",
    "several studies have also explored , using the weak turbulence theory , the non - linear wave - wave interaction of plasma waves with the gw ( see @xcite ) .",
    "the strong nonlinear coupling of isolated charged particles with a coherent gw was studied using the hamiltonian formalism @xcite .",
    "the main conclusion of these studies was that the coupling between gw and an isolated charged particle gyrating inside a constant magnetic field can be very strong only if the gw is very intense .",
    "this type of analysis can treat the full non - linear coupling of the charged particle with the gw but looses all the collective phenomena associated with the excitation of waves inside the plasma and the back reaction of the plasma onto the gw .    in this article , we re - investigate the non - linear interaction of an electron with a gw inside a magnetic field , using the hamiltonian formalism .",
    "our study is applicable at the neighborhood of the central engine ( collapsing massive magnetic star @xcite ) or during the final stages of the merging of neutron star binaries @xcite .",
    "we find that a strong but low frequency ( @xmath0 khz ) gw can resonate with ambient electrons only in the neighborhood of magnetic neutral sheets and accelerates them to very high energies in milliseconds .",
    "relativistic electrons travel along the magnetic field , escaping from the neutral sheet to the super strong magnetic field , and emitting synchrotron radiation .",
    "we propose that the passage of a gw through numerous localized neutral sheets will create spiky sources which collectively produce the highly variable in time .    in section 2",
    ", we analyze the interaction of a gw with a single electron inside a constant magnetic field . in section 3",
    "we investigate the diffusion to high energies of a distribution of electrons inside the gw . in section 4",
    ", we propose a new model for strong coupling of the gw with the turbulent plasma at the atmosphere of the central engine and the resulting impulsive synchrotron emission and finally , in section 5 , we summarize our results .",
    "the motion of a charged particle in a curved space and in the presence of a magnetic field is described by a hamiltonian , which , in a system of units @xmath1 is given by    @xmath2    @xmath3 are the contravariant components of the metric tensor of the curved space and @xmath4 are the components of the vector potential of the magnetic field @xcite .",
    "the variables @xmath5 are the generalized momenta corresponding to the coordinates @xmath6 and their evolution with respect to the proper time @xmath7 is given by the canonical equations @xmath8    we assume a constant magnetic field @xmath9 which is produced by the vector potential @xmath10 and that a gw propagates in a direction @xmath11 of angle @xmath12 with respect to the direction of the magnetic field . in that case the nonzero components of the metric tensor are ( see @xcite ) @xmath13 and @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the amplitude of the gw and @xmath16 the parameter @xmath17 is the relative frequency of the gw , i.e. @xmath18 , where @xmath19 is the larmor angular frequency .",
    "we make use of the scaling @xmath20 , thus @xmath21 .    in the above formalism , the coordinate @xmath22 is ignorable , so @xmath23 . by setting the constant @xmath24 in eq .",
    "( [ mfield ] ) equal to @xmath25 we get an appropriate gauge that reduces by one degree of freedom the hamiltonian ( eq .",
    "( [ hoo ] ) ) , which takes the form @xmath26 where we use the notation @xmath27 and @xmath28 for brevity .",
    "we apply the canonical transformation of variables @xmath29 using the generating function @xmath30 the relation between the old and the new variables is given by the equations @xmath31 in the new variables the hamiltonian ( eq . ( [ ho1 ] ) ) takes the form @xmath32 since the variable @xmath33 is ignorable , @xmath34 is a constant of motion and eq .",
    "( [ ho2 ] ) can be studied as a system of two degrees of freedom , where @xmath34 is a parameter .",
    "the variables @xmath35 and @xmath36 are associated with the gyro - motion .",
    "@xmath37 is of mod(@xmath38 ) with respect to the angle - variable @xmath39 and the variable @xmath40 is related linearly with the energy @xmath41 of the particles according to the equation @xmath42 the equations of motion are @xmath43 where the dot means derivative with respect to the proper time @xmath7 .",
    "furthermore , eq.([ho2 ] ) can be written as a perturbed hamiltonian in the usual way , i.e. @xmath44 where @xmath45 are the perturbation terms and @xmath46 is the integrable part of the system that describes the unperturbed helical motion of the particle in the flat space .",
    "considering action - angle variables @xmath47 , eq.([h0 ] ) takes the form @xmath48 where @xmath49 and @xmath50 therefore , the unperturbed system is isoenergeticaly non - degenerate for @xmath51 @xcite and the gyro motion of the particles is represented by trajectories that twist invariant tori with angular frequencies @xmath52 and @xmath53 . the periodic or quasi - periodic evolution of the trajectories depends on whether the rotation number , defined by @xmath54 is rational or irrational , respectively .",
    "most of the invariant tori will persist with the presence of the perturbation introduced by the gw , if the amplitude is suficiently small , according to the kam theorem @xcite .",
    "the orbits of the particles remain close to the unperturbed ones but their projection on the @xmath55 plane is not exactly circular and periodic .",
    "close to the resonant tori , where @xmath56 is rational , the poincar - birkhoff theorem applies ; a finite number of pairs of stable and unstable periodic trajectories survive , producing locally a pendulum like topology in phase space @xcite .",
    "since the system is of two degrees of freedom , we can study its evolution by using the poincar sections @xmath57 choosing specific sets of the parameters @xmath58 and @xmath12 . in the numerical calculations , which will follow",
    ", we set @xmath59 . for the unperturbed system ( @xmath60 ) the sections show invariant curves @xmath61const . for @xmath62",
    "some typical examples are shown in fig.[pnc1 ] .    for small values of @xmath15 ( fig.[pnc1]a ) ,",
    "the invariant curves are perturbed slightly and only close to the most significant resonances their deformation becomes noticeable . increasing further the perturbation parameter @xmath15 , the width of the resonances increases and homoclinic chaos becomes more obvious close to the hyperbolic fixed points ( fig.[pnc1]b ) .",
    "the existence of invariant curves , which confine the resonant regions , guarantees the bounded variation of the particle s energy ( @xmath63 for the chaotic trajectories .",
    "when the amplitude @xmath15 exceeds a critical value @xmath64 , overlapping of resonances takes place and large chaotic regions are generated ( fig.[pnc1]c ) ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "particles with initial energy @xmath65 greater than a critical value @xmath66 may follow a chaotic orbit which diffuse to regions of higher energy , and this will lead them to very high energies in short time scales . for relatively large values of @xmath67 , the islands of regular motion , which survive from the resonance overlapping , are gradually destroyed and chaos extends down to relatively low energy particles ( fig.[pnc1]d ) . the chaotic part of the phase space will be called `` the chaotic sea '' .",
    "the dynamics , presented by the poincare sections in fig.[pnc1 ] , is typical for the majority of parameter values .",
    "generally , the critical values @xmath64 and @xmath66 determine the conditions for possible chaotic diffusion .",
    "the dynamics of the charged particles shows some exceptional characteristics when the frequency of the gw is comparable to the larmor frequency of the unperturbed motion , particularly when @xmath68 . for such parameter values ,",
    "stochastic behavior will appear when @xmath69 and for sufficiently large perturbation values large chaotic regions are generated and diffusion , even for particles with very low initial energies , will be possible .",
    "an example is shown in fig.[pnc2]a .",
    "the evolution of the particles changes character when the direction of propagation of the gw is almost parallel to @xmath70 . in this case ,",
    "chaos disappears , and the particles undergo large energy oscillations . as it is shown in fig .",
    "[ pnc2]b , a particle , starting even from rest ( @xmath71 ) , will be driven regularly to high energies ( @xmath72 ) and returns back to its initial energy in an almost periodic way . in a realistic , non infinite system",
    ", several particles may escape from the interaction with the gw before returning back to low energies . at @xmath73",
    "the system is integrable and the energy of the particles shows regular slow oscillations with an amplitude proportional to @xmath15 .",
    "in the previous section , we showed that chaotic diffusion is possible for @xmath74 and for the particles with @xmath75 .",
    "such conditions are necessary but not sufficient for acceleration , since islands of regular motion may be present inside the wide chaotic region ( see for example fig .",
    "[ pnc2 ] ) .",
    "we estimate approximately the critical value @xmath64 by studying a large number of poincar sections for different values of @xmath12 ( fig.[acgc]a ) .",
    "we observe that for small values of @xmath17 resonance overlap is obtained for relatively large amplitudes of the gw . for higher frequency , @xmath76 and @xmath77",
    "the overlapping of resonances takes place even for relatively small values of @xmath78 .",
    "the critical value @xmath66 along the frequency axis @xmath17 is presented for @xmath79 and for @xmath80 in fig.[acgc]b . for large values of @xmath17 , and when the critical value @xmath64 is relatively small ( @xmath81 ) , the critical particle energy @xmath66 is large and increases linearly with @xmath17 .",
    "namely , for large @xmath17 , chaotic diffusion takes place only for high energy particles . on the other hand , for @xmath82",
    ", resonance overlapping takes place for large perturbations but the wide chaotic sea formed extends down to the thermal velocity .    in fig .",
    "[ gevol]a the evolution of @xmath65 along a temporarily trapped chaotic orbit ( @xmath83 ) and an orbit which undergoes fast diffusion is shown , using @xmath84 . in fig .",
    "[ gevol]b we plot the orbit of a particle which on the average is not gaining energy and the average rate of energy gain of 200 particles .",
    "the diffusion rate of the particles in the energy space is initially fast but for time @xmath85 it starts to slow down .",
    "the time @xmath86 is normalized with the gyro period @xmath87      we study next the evolution of an energy distribution @xmath88 of electrons interacting with the gw .    in fig .",
    "[ gdistr]a we follow the evolution of @xmath89 particles forming initially a cold energy distribution @xmath90 where @xmath91 is the dirac delta function i.e. all particles have the same initial energy @xmath92 a large spread in their energy is achieved in short time scales , and for @xmath93 , a non - thermal tail extending up to @xmath94 is formed .",
    "we repeat the same analysis , assuming that the initial distribution is the tail ( @xmath95 , where @xmath96 is the ambient thermal velocity ) of a maxwellian distribution ( fig.[gdistr]b ) .",
    "the distribution of the high energy particle form a long non - thermal tail analogously to the results reported in fig.([gdistr]a ) .    the mean energy diffusion as a function of time is plotted in fig . [ gamdif]a for a particular set of parameters ,",
    "and it has the general form    @xmath97    from a large number of calculations , we find that the energy spread in time follow a normal diffusion ( @xmath98 ) in energy space but as @xmath78 increases ( see fig . [ gamdif]b ) , the interaction becomes super - diffusive @xmath99 in energy space .",
    "this allows electrons to spread fast in energy space and explains the efficient coupling between the gw and the plasma .",
    "our main findings so far are :    1 .",
    "the gw can accelerate electrons from the tail of the ambient velocity distribution ( @xmath100 ) to very high energies ( @xmath101 ) for typical values of @xmath102 and @xmath103 assuming that the the frequency of the gw is around 10khz , and @xmath104 the magnetic fields strength should be around @xmath105 gauss .",
    "the acceleration time depends in general on @xmath78 but is relatively short @xmath106 . during that time",
    "the gw will travel a distance @xmath107 cm .",
    "the mean energy diffusion of the electrons interacting with the gw follows the simple scaling @xmath108    we propose a new mechanism for efficient particle acceleration around strong and impulsive sources of gw using the estimates presented above for the strong interaction of gw with electrons .",
    "we assume that in the atmosphere of the central engine a turbulent magnetic field will be formed . inside this complex magnetic topology ,",
    "a distribution of 3-d magnetic neutral sheets ( magnetic null surfaces ) with characteristic length @xmath109 will be developed ( see fig . ( [ 3dsheets ] ) and the relevant studies for the solar atmosphere @xcite ) .",
    "these 3-d surfaces naturally appear and disappear inside driven mhd turbulent plasmas and are randomly distributed inside the atmosphere of the central engine .",
    "it is well known that the neutral sheets will act as localized dissipation regions and will accelerate particles @xcite .",
    "the turbulent atmosphere of the central engine will sporadically emit weak x - ray and possibly @xmath110-ray bursts for relatively long times before the collapse of the massive magnetized star to form a black hole or the merging of neutron star binaries .",
    "we suggest that numerous weak bursts are present and remain unobserved .    in this article",
    ", we emphasize the role of the gw passing through magnetic neutral sheets and claim that the gw will enhance dramatically the acceleration process inside the neutral sheet , causing very intense bursts . according to the arguments presented in sections 2 and 3 ,",
    "the gw can resonate with the electrons only when the magnetic field is weak ( in the vicinity of the magnetic null surface ) . inside the neutral sheet",
    "the synchrotron emission losses are negligible so the acceleration is very efficient .",
    "electrons escaping from the neutral sheet to the super strong magnetic field , expected in the atmosphere of the central engine , transfer very efficiently their perpendicular to the magnetic field energy to synchrotron radiation creating spiky localized bursts .",
    "the relativistic electrons retain the parallel to the magnetic field energy and travel along the field lines till they reach the dense ambient plasma and deposit their energy via collisions , causing other types of longer lived bursts ( e.g. x - ray and optical flashes)(see fig .",
    "( [ mhdtur]a ) ) .",
    "we suggest thus that the creation of a network of localized accelerators with characteristic length @xmath111 , which are spread in relatively large volumes inside the turbulent atmosphere of the central engine , will be responsible for the busty emission .",
    "the amplitude of the gw decays as it propagates away from the central engine as @xmath112 when @xmath113 and/or the magnetic topology does not allow formation of magnetic neutral sheets the gw stops to interact with electrons and this indicates the end of the burst .",
    "so the overall duration of the burst is approximately @xmath114 , where @xmath115 is the length of the characteristic layer where the interaction of the gw with the particles is efficient .",
    "( see fig .",
    "[ mhdtur]b ) .",
    "let us now discuss another very important observational fact .",
    "it is well documented that the observed spectrum of the synchrotron radiation has a power law shape .",
    "this implies that the energy distribution causing the synchrotron radiation has also a power law dependence in energy @xmath116 were @xmath117 ( e.g. see @xcite for grb ) .",
    "these types of energy distribution are usually attributed to a shock wave ( or a series of shock waves ) .",
    "the formation of a series of localized shock waves along the streaming plasma injected from the central engine is considered the `` standard '' model for grb @xcite and may be of interest in many other astrophysical sources .",
    "the spontaneous formation of magnetic neutral sheets in the 3-d turbulent atmosphere of the central engine is not easy to describe .",
    "a number of studies on the statistical properties of the magnetic neutral sheets have appeared for the active region of the sun @xcite .",
    "all these studies are based on the observational fact that flares follow a specific distribution in energy @xcite .",
    "an important concept from the study of 3-d mhd turbulence is that a hierarchy of magnetic neutral sheets formed , with a distribution of characteristic lengths given by the function @xmath118 this scaling follows the energy distribution of flares and the most probable value for @xmath119 is @xmath120 .",
    "in other words , inside a turbulent magnetized plasma , a large number of magnetic neutral surfaces with small characteristic lengths , and very few large scale magnetic neutral sheets will be present .",
    "the exponent , according to the studies reported earlier , for the solar atmosphere is roughly equal to @xmath121 and is related to the statistics of x - ray bursts @xcite .",
    "the gw will accelerate electrons only in the brief period it passes through the magnetic neutral sheet , so the acceleration time will also follow a similar scaling law since @xmath122 we have shown in fig .",
    "[ gamdif ] that the the mean energy of the accelerated particles increases with time according to a simple power law as well . combining the eq .",
    "( [ stat])-([accel ] ) we derive first the distribution of @xmath86 which is a function of @xmath109 .",
    "we have @xmath123 , or @xmath124 , which yields , when neglecting the constants , @xmath125 we determine next the distribution of @xmath65 ( or , more precisely , of @xmath126 ) , which is a function of @xmath86 .",
    "we start again from the relation @xmath127 , or @xmath128 we insert eq .",
    "( [ nt ] ) , @xmath129 and we replace @xmath86 on the right hand side using eq .",
    "( [ diff ] ) , @xmath130 or , on doing the derivative and rearranging , @xmath131 using a typical values for @xmath132 ( see fig .",
    "[ gamdif ] ) and @xmath133 we estimate the exponent of the energy distribution to be around 2 .      the energy transferred from the gw to the high energy particles by passing through one neutral sheet",
    "is    @xmath134    where @xmath135 is the electrons density , @xmath136 are the electron at the tail of the local maxwellian , @xmath137 is the thickness of the magnetic neutral sheet .",
    "the filling factor of neutral sheets inside the atmosphere of the central engine is assumed to be @xmath138 so the total number of magnetic neutral sheets expected to interact with the gw is @xmath139 and the total energy transferred to the plasma @xmath140\\times    \\left(\\frac{n_t}{n_0 }    n_0(\\ell_{acc}^2\\times \\delta \\ell)\\times    \\gamma mc^2\\right).\\ ] ] using typical numbers @xmath141 and assuming that the burst duration is 1s which implies that @xmath142 the total energy estimated is approximately @xmath143 ergs .",
    "the total burst duration is around 100s but the burst is composed with many short bursts lasting less than a second ( @xmath144 ) .",
    "we can now list several characteristics of the bursty emission driven by the model proposed above :    * a fraction of the energy carried by the orbital energy of the neutron stars at merger will go to the the gw and a portion of this energy will be transferred to the high energy electrons . *",
    "the topology of the magnetic field varies from event to event , so every burst has its own characteristics . *",
    "the superposition of many small scale localized sources produces a fine time structure on the burst .",
    "* the superposition of null surfaces with a power law distribution of the acceleration lengths will result in a power law energy distribution for the accelerated electrons and an associated synchrotron radiation emitted by the relativistic electrons . *",
    "the decay of the amplitude of the gw and/or the lack of magnetic neutral sheets away from the central engine will mark the end of the burst , but not necessarily the end of other types of bursts since the cooling of the ambient turbulent plasma has a much longer time scale .",
    "it is worth drawing the analogy between the elements used to build our model for this busrty emission and two significant developments in solar flares and the earths magnetic tail .",
    "( 1 ) @xcite studied the dynamic formation of current sheets ( current sheets are not always associated with neutral sheets ) in the solar atmosphere .",
    "they found that the irregular motion of the magnetic foot - points , caused by the turbulent convection zone , forces the magnetic topologies to form a hierarchy of 3-d current sheets inside the complex magnetic topologies above active regions .",
    "( 2 ) @xcite studied the passage of low frequency waves ( alfvn waves ) through a 2-d neutral sheet .",
    "they discovered that the acceleration of charged particles is greatly enhanced from the presence of the alfvn waves .",
    "we believe that solar flares , the earths magnetotail , and the gw driven bursts share two important characteristics , namely the formation of 3-d magnetic null surfaces coupled with the passage of waves through these surfaces ( alfvn waves for the sun and the earths magnetotail and gw for the bursts analyzed in this article ) .",
    "although the external drivers and the energetics of the bursts produced are clearly very different .",
    "in this article we have study an efficient mechanism to transfer the energy released from a central engine to the turbulent plasma in its atmosphere .",
    "we have analyzed the non - linear interaction of gw with electrons .",
    "we showed that electrons in the tail of the ambient plasma are accelerated efficiently , reaching energies up to hundreds of mev in less than a second , when ( 1 ) the amplitude of the gw is above a typical value @xmath145 and ( 2 ) the magnetic field is relatively weak @xmath146 gauss , for a gw with typical frequency 1 - 10khz .    on the basis of these findings",
    ", we propose that pulsed gw emitted from the central engine will interact with the ambient plasma in the vicinity of the magnetic neutral sheets formed naturally inside externally driven turbulent mhd plasmas .",
    "magnetic neutral sheets have characteristic lengths @xmath147 cm and are short lived 3-d surfaces .",
    "although these structures are efficient accelerators , we are emphasizing in this article only the role of the gw passing through these surfaces since we focus our attention on the very strong and bursty sources .",
    "the gw passing through the neutral sheets will accelerate electrons to very high energies .",
    "relativistic electrons escape from the magnetic neutral sheets radiating synchrotron emission as soon as they reach the very strong magnetic fields .",
    "the collective emission of thousands of short lived ( less than a second ) synchrotron pulses , created during the passage of the gw through a relatively large volume .",
    "the relativistic electrons loosing most of their perpendicular to the magnetic field energy to synchrotron radiation retain the parallel energy and heat the ambient plasma emitting other types of longer lived bursts , e.g. x - rays and optical flushes .",
    "we have also shown that if the acceleration length follows a simple scaling law ( @xmath148 ) and since , as shown , @xmath149 the energy distribution also follows a power law scaling ( @xmath150 ) , which for reasonable values of @xmath151 and @xmath152 agrees remarkably well with the energy distributions inferred from the observations .",
    "we are suggesting that numerous burst are still present before and after the passage of the gw since the magnetic neutral sheet act as efficient particle accelerators .",
    "the gw passage simply enhances the acceleration process and makes many short lived spikes to become visible .",
    "we propose that a more thorough analysis of the statistical properties of the bursty emission , with main emphasis on the low energy part of the frequency distribution , will give important insight on the processes mentioned here .",
    "a detailed model for the interaction of gw with turbulent mhd plasma is currently under study , and we hope to develop an even more efficient energy transfer from the gw to the plasma e.g by triggering the interaction ( percolation ) of many null sheets during the passage of the gw .",
    "we hope that this may lead us to an alternative scenario for the still unresolved questions related with the acceleration mechanism in the atmosphere of the central engines and the physical processes behind the x - ray and grb .",
    "we thank dr . heinz isliker and the anonymous referees for many helpful suggestions which improved substantially our article .",
