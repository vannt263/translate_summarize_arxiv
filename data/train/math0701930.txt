    "the purpose of this note is to produce explicit examples of cat(-1 ) groups containing free subgroups with arbitrary iterated exponential distortion , and distortion higher than any iterated exponential .",
    "the construction parallels that of mahan mitra in @xcite but our groups are the fundamental groups of locally cat(@xmath0 ) @xmath1-complexes .",
    "the building blocks used in @xcite are hyperbolic @xmath2 groups , which are not known to be cat(@xmath3 ) .",
    "our building blocks are graphs of groups where the vertex and edge groups are all free groups of equal rank and the underlying graph is a bouquet of a finite number of circles .",
    "we use the combinatorial and geometric techniques from dani wise s version of the rips construction @xcite to ensure that our building blocks glue together in a locally cat(@xmath0 ) fashion .",
    "one of our motivations for producing these examples was that it was not immediate from the description that the examples in @xcite had the appropriate iterated exponential distortions .",
    "mitra s examples are graphs of groups with underlying graph a segment of length @xmath4 , where the vertex groups are hyperbolic @xmath5 groups , and each edge identifies the kernel @xmath6 in one vertex group with the second @xmath6 factor in the adjacent vertex group .    while it is easy to see that the @xmath4th power of a hyperbolic automorphism of a free group will send a generator of the free group into a word which grows exponentially in @xmath4 , it appears to be harder to see ( without using bounded cancellation properties of carefully chosen automorphisms ) that a word of length @xmath4 in three hyperbolic automorphisms ( and their inverses ) will send a generator of the free group to a word which grows exponentially in @xmath4 .",
    "in contrast , the monomorphisms in the multiple hnn extensions in our construction are all defined using positive words .",
    "this makes it easy to see that the exponential distortions compose as required .",
    "also , the example in @xcite with distortion higher than any iterated exponential is of the form @xmath7 with the generator of @xmath8 conjugating the generators of the first @xmath6 to `` sufficiently random '' words in the generators of the second @xmath6 .",
    "in contrast , our group can be described explicitly , without recourse to random words , allowing for an explicit check that our group is cat(@xmath0 ) .    recall that if @xmath9 is a pair of finitely generated groups with word metrics @xmath10 and @xmath11 respectively , the _ distortion _ of @xmath12 in @xmath13 is given by @xmath14 up to lipschitz equivalence , this function is independent of the choice of word metrics .",
    "background on cat(@xmath0 ) spaces and the large link condition may be found in @xcite .",
    "for each positive integer @xmath4 we define a building block group @xmath15 where @xmath16 and @xmath17 is a collection of positive words of length @xmath18 in @xmath19 , such that each two - letter word @xmath20 appears at most once among the @xmath21 s . one way of ensuring this is to choose these words to be consecutive subwords of the following word , defined by dani wise in @xcite",
    ".    [ long - word ] given the set of letters @xmath22 , define @xmath23    it is easy to see that @xmath24 is a positive word of length @xmath25 , such that each two - letter word @xmath26 appears as a subword in at most one place . following dani wise ,",
    "we simply chop @xmath27 into subwords of length 14 . in order to obtain all @xmath28 relator words of @xmath29 from @xmath30",
    "we must have @xmath31 , which explains our choice of @xmath32 above .",
    "[ build - block ] the presentation @xmath1-complex @xmath33 for @xmath34 can be given a locally cat(@xmath0 ) structure .",
    "furthermore ,    1 .   the @xmath35 s generate a free subgroup @xmath36 whose distortion in @xmath34 is exponential .",
    "2 .   the @xmath37 s generate a free subgroup @xmath38 of @xmath34 that is highly convex in the following sense : + let @xmath39 be the vertex of @xmath33 .",
    "then @xmath40    each disk in @xmath33 is given a piecewise hyperbolic structure by expressing it as a concatenation of right - angled hyperbolic pentagons , as shown in figure [ 2cell ] .",
    "the fact that @xmath33 satisfies the large link condition is a consequence of the condition that the @xmath21 s are positive words with no two - letter repetitions .",
    "the details are in @xcite .",
    "thus @xmath33 is locally cat(@xmath0 ) and @xmath29 is hyperbolic .    to prove ( 1 ) , first note that the group @xmath34 can be viewed as the fundamental group of a graph of groups .",
    "the underlying graph is a bouquet of @xmath4 circles , and the edge and vertex groups are all equal to @xmath41 , the free group on @xmath42 .",
    "the two maps associated with the @xmath43th edge are @xmath44 and @xmath45 , defined by @xmath46 for @xmath47 . to see that @xmath48 is injective , note that @xmath48 induces a map on a subdivided bouquet of @xmath32 circles . by stallings algorithm",
    "this factors through a sequence of folds followed by an immersion .",
    "the no two - letter repetitions condition restricts the amount of folding that can occur and ensures that no non - trivial loops are killed by the sequence of folds .",
    "thus the folding maps induce isomorphisms at the level of @xmath49 and the final immersion induces an injection .",
    "the theory of graphs of groups now implies that the subgroup of @xmath34 generated by @xmath50 is @xmath41 .",
    "the distortion of @xmath41 in @xmath34 is at least exponential because , for example , the element @xmath51 of @xmath41 , when expressed in terms of the @xmath35 s , is a positive ( hence reduced ) word of length @xmath52 . to see that the distortion is at most exponential",
    "consider a word @xmath53 which represents an element of @xmath41 and has length @xmath54 in @xmath34 .",
    "it can be reduced to a word in the @xmath35 s by successively cancelling at most @xmath55 innermost @xmath56 pairs .",
    "each such cancellation multiplies the word length by at most a factor of @xmath18 .",
    "so the length of @xmath53 in @xmath36 is at most @xmath57 .    to prove ( 2 ) , note that any path in the link of @xmath39 connecting @xmath58 and @xmath59 within a disk as in figure [ 2cell ] has combinatorial length @xmath1 . so any path in the link connecting @xmath60 and @xmath61 has combinatorial length at least @xmath62 .",
    "since we are using right - angled pentagons , combinatorial length 4 corresponds to a spherical metric length of @xmath63 or @xmath64 .",
    "thus @xmath65 is highly convex . as a consequence , we have that the map from the bouquet of circles with edges labelled @xmath66 into @xmath33 is a local isometric embedding .",
    "this implies that it is @xmath49-injective , i.e. @xmath66 generate the free group @xmath38 . to see this algebraically ,",
    "note that the homomorphism @xmath67 defined by @xmath68 and @xmath69 is a retraction of @xmath29 onto @xmath38 .",
    "in this section we see how to get arbitrary iterated exponential distortions .",
    "the idea is to amalgamate a chain of building block groups together , identifying the distorted free group in one with the highly convex free subgroup in the next .",
    "this identification of distorted with highly convex can be made in a non - positively curved way , and the distortion functions compose as expected . here",
    "are the details .    for any integer @xmath70",
    ", there exists a @xmath1-dimensional cat(@xmath0 ) group @xmath71 with a free subgroup @xmath72 such that @xmath73 .",
    "we will actually show that @xmath74 , where @xmath75 .    the group @xmath71 is defined using the building blocks from proposition [ build - block ] as    @xmath76 where @xmath77 , for @xmath78 , is a free group of rank @xmath52 which is identified with the exponentially distorted free subgroup of @xmath79 and the highly convex free subgroup of @xmath80 .",
    "let @xmath81 , with @xmath82 , denote the generators of @xmath77 , and let @xmath83 denote the stable letter of @xmath84 , so that @xmath85 and @xmath86 .",
    "we shall use this notation in the upper and lower bound arguments below .",
    "let @xmath87 denote the presentation complex of @xmath71 .",
    "then @xmath88 , which is locally cat(@xmath0 ) by proposition [ build - block ] . further , there are inclusions @xmath89 , so that the large link condition can be checked inductively .",
    "the space @xmath90 is obtained by gluing @xmath91 to @xmath92 along a rose @xmath93 with @xmath94 petals , and @xmath95 is highly convex in @xmath96 .",
    "it follows that the link of the base vertex of @xmath90 is obtained by gluing together the links of base vertices in @xmath92 and @xmath91 , along a set of @xmath97 points which is @xmath64-separated in the latter link . by induction ,",
    "the link of the base vertex in @xmath98 is large , and hence the union is large .",
    "the group with the desired distortion in @xmath71 is @xmath99 , the free group generated by @xmath100 , with @xmath101 , which is exponentially distorted in @xmath102 .",
    "we prove the lower bound as follows . given a positive integer @xmath4 consider the sequence given by @xmath103 and @xmath104 , and set @xmath105 .",
    "given @xmath106 let @xmath107 denote the distance from @xmath108 to @xmath109 in @xmath71 .",
    "observe that @xmath110 , and inductively that @xmath111 ( a linear function of @xmath4 ) .",
    "on the other hand , each @xmath112 can be expressed as a positive word in the generators of @xmath77 by using the @xmath21 s from the definition of the building blocks .",
    "since there is no cancellation among positive words , we obtain that @xmath113 and inductively that @xmath114 .",
    "this gives the lower bound @xmath115 .",
    "to prove the upper bound it is more convenient to do the induction in the opposite direction .",
    "proposition [ build - block ] provides the base case .",
    "let @xmath116 be an element whose length in @xmath71 is at most @xmath4 .",
    "then by successively cancelling at most @xmath117 innermost @xmath118 pairs , @xmath116 can be represented by a word in @xmath119 of length at most @xmath120 . at each stage of the previous cancellation procedure",
    ", we may assume ( by replacement if necessary ) that the subword enclosed by an innermost @xmath121 involves only the @xmath122 .",
    "this is because the free group on the @xmath123 is a retract of @xmath119 .",
    "the upper bound follows by induction .",
    "in this section we produce a 2-dimensional cat(-1 ) group containing a free subgroup with distortion more than any iterated exponential . the idea is to take a suitable building block group from section 2 with base group free on @xmath124 and stable letters @xmath125 , and to form a new hnn extension with stable letter @xmath126 which sends the free group on the @xmath124 into a subgroup of the free group on the @xmath125 .",
    "define @xmath128 where @xmath17 ( resp .",
    "@xmath129 ) consists of @xmath28 ( resp .",
    "@xmath32 ) positive words of length @xmath18 in the letters @xmath124 ( resp .",
    "@xmath125 ) , with no @xmath1-letter repetitions .",
    "thus we may choose the @xmath21 s and @xmath130 s to be disjoint subwords of @xmath24 and @xmath131 ( see definition [ long - word ] ) respectively .",
    "this gives the following two conditions : @xmath132 so , for example , @xmath133 and @xmath134 is a possible choice .",
    "each disk in the presentation complex is given a piecewise hyperbolic structure by concatenating a sequence of right - angled pentagons as shown in figure [ second ] .",
    "observe that loops in the link of the unique vertex which involve @xmath135 have combinatorial length at least @xmath62 .",
    "similarly , any loop involving an @xmath59 and a @xmath58 , for some @xmath43 and @xmath136 , has length at least 4 .",
    "thus to show that the complex is locally cat(@xmath0 ) , it is enough to consider loops involving only @xmath137 s or only @xmath138 s .",
    "the fact that such loops are large is a consequence of the condition that the @xmath21 s and @xmath130 s are positive words with no two - letter repetitions .",
    "the details are exactly as in @xcite .",
    "let @xmath12 be the subgroup of @xmath13 generated by @xmath50 . then @xmath127 is higher than any iterated exponential . to see this ,",
    "consider the sequence of words @xmath139 given by @xmath140 and @xmath141 for @xmath142 .",
    "the word @xmath143 is shown in figure  [ snow ] .",
    "the label of each single arrow edge is @xmath144 , the label of each solid arrow edge is @xmath145 , and the edges along the strips are all labeled by @xmath126 and are oriented from @xmath146 toward @xmath147 .",
    "let @xmath148 and @xmath149 denote geodesic lengths in @xmath13 and @xmath12 respectively .",
