    "entanglement is one of the most fascinating features of quantum theory and has numerous applications in quantum information processing @xcite .",
    "characterization and quantification of quantum entanglement have become an very important issue . as a result ,",
    "various approaches have been proposed and many significant conclusions have been derived in detecting entanglement @xcite .",
    "one of the most well - known results is the positive partial transpose ( ppt ) criterion @xcite , which says that if a state @xmath4 is separable , then it is positive under partial transposition .",
    "this criterion is both sufficient and necessary for the separability of qubit - qubit ( @xmath1 ) and qubit - qutrit ( @xmath2 ) mixed states .",
    "a state that is not positive under partial transposition is called an npt state .",
    "it is obvious that ppt criterion can detect all npt entangled states but fails in detecting ppt entanglement .",
    "the reduction criterion @xcite is necessary and sufficient only for @xmath1 and @xmath2 states . like the majorization criterion @xcite",
    ", it can neither detect the ppt entangled states .",
    "the range @xcite and realignment criteria @xcite are able to detect some ppt entanglement .",
    "but generally , there are yet no general sufficient and necessary separability criteria for higher dimensional states .",
    "theoretically if one can calculate the degree of entanglement for a given state , the separability problem can be also solved . for bipartite systems , there are many well known entanglement measures such as entanglement of formation @xcite , concurrence @xcite , negativity @xcite and relative entropy @xcite .",
    "however with the increasing dimensions of the systems the computation of most entanglement measures become formidably difficult . therefore many approaches have been used to give an estimation of the lower bound for entanglement of formation and concurrence @xcite , which give rise to some necessary conditions for separability of high dimensional bipartite mixed states .    for unknown quantum states ,",
    "the separability can only be determined by measuring some suitable quantum mechanical observables .",
    "the bell inequalities @xcite can be used to detect perfectly the entanglement of pure bipartite states @xcite .",
    "nevertheless these bell inequalities do not detect the entanglement of mixed states in general .",
    "there are mixed entangled states which do not violate the clauser - horne - shimony - holt ( chsh ) inequality @xcite .",
    "besides bell inequalities , the entanglement witness could also be used for experimental detection of quantum entanglement for some special states @xcite . for two - qubit pure sates ,",
    "a method to measure the concurrence has been proposed @xcite , which is further experimentally demonstrated @xcite .",
    "this protocol needs a twofold copy of the two - qubit state at every measurement .",
    "a way of measuring concurrence for two - qubit states by using only one copy of the state at each measurement has been presented in @xcite .",
    "nevertheless up to now , we have no experimental methods to detect quantum entanglement sufficiently and necessarily for general mixed states .",
    "although the ppt criterion is both necessary and sufficient for detecting entanglement of @xmath1 and @xmath2 mixed states , it can not be simply  translated \" into the language of bell inequalities . in @xcite , by using a nice approach and the ppt criterion , a bell - type inequality has been proposed for detecting entanglement of two - qubit mixed states .",
    "in fact the higher dimensional systems offer advantages such as increased security in a range of quantum information protocols @xcite , greater channel capacity for quantum communication @xcite , novel fundamental tests of quantum mechanics @xcite , and more efficient quantum gates @xcite .",
    "in particular , hybrid qubit - qutrit system has been extensively studied and already experimentally realized @xcite .",
    "however the approach used in @xcite can not be simply generalized to the case for @xmath0 systems .    in this paper",
    ", we present a set of bell - type inequalities for @xmath0 systems , in the sense of @xcite such that the quantum mechanical observales to be measured are all local ones .",
    "we show that these inequalities can detect all npt entangled states and some ppt entangled states . for the separability of @xmath1 and @xmath2 mixed states , these bell - type inequalities are both sufficient and necessary .",
    "the inequalities can also be used to detect quantum entanglement experimentally for multiqubit systems .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii , we derive the inequality to detect entanglement of @xmath2 system and show that the violation of this inequality implies quantum entanglement sufficiently and necessarily .",
    "applying our approach to @xmath1 system , we recover the main results in @xcite . in section iii , we provide inequalities to detect entanglement for @xmath0 systems and show that these inequalities can detect entanglement of all npt states and some ppt states .",
    "conclusions and remarks are given in section iv .",
    "first we present a lemma that will be used in proving our theorem for @xmath2 system .",
    "if the inequality @xmath5 holds for arbitrary real numbers @xmath6 and @xmath7 , and nonnegative @xmath8 , @xmath9 , then @xmath10 for @xmath11 and @xmath12 .    proof . from eq .",

    "( [ theorem 2by3 * * ] ) , one gets that the square root of the left hand side of ( [ theorem 2by3 * * ] ) becomes [ 2by3 pure ai>0 ] 2 i_2 i_3 - i_2 _ 1 + 2 i_2 _ 2 + 3 _ 3 _ 1 _ || + = 6(|_0_1|^2+|_1_2|^2)0 . while the right hand side of the inequality ( [ theorem 2by3 * * ] ) becomes [ 2by3 a not 0 right ] 3i_2_1 + 2_3 i_3 - _ 3 _ 1 + 2 _ 3 _ 2 ^2_|| + + 9 _ 1 _ 3 + _ 2 _ 4 ^ 2_|| + = ( 6|_1 _ 0|^2 - 6|_2_1|^2)^2 + 144(re(_1_2^*)re(_1^ * _ 0))^2 .",

    "our inequality has advantages in detecting entanglement of this ppt entangled state , since the ppt , ccnr , reduction and majorization criteria can all not detect the entanglement of @xmath150 .",
