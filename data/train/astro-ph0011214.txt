    "the recent achievements of the vhe @xmath1-ray astronomy offer a great number of diverse and fundamental physics results which make further developments in the field highly physically motivated .",
    "future @xmath1-ray observations will deliver exhaustive knowledge to understanding the origin of the cosmic rays by observing the supernovae remnants ( snrs ) and the physics of the relativistic jets in the active galactic nuclei ( agn ) , the measurements of the infrared ( ir ) absorption of @xmath1-rays propagating in the interstellar medium , the necessary data to prove the mechanisms of a particle acceleration in the pulsars and plerions , clues to the enigma of the gamma - ray bursts _",
    "etc_. at the same time the significant advancement towards the new physics frontiers will be only possible after a significant improvement of the observational instrumentation .",
    "the efficient search and detailed study of the sites of the particle acceleration up to multi - tev energies , which may brighten up in @xmath1-rays , need lowering farther the energy threshold of the instruments down to 50 - 100  gev , ability to localize the @xmath1-ray emission with accuracy better than 1  arcmin , large telescopes field of view for the comprehensive studies of the extended @xmath1-ray emission , large dynamic energy range ( 50  gev - 50  tev ) and good energy resolution ( @xmath2% ) for precise measurements of the @xmath1-ray energy spectra , larger @xmath1-ray statistics at the time scale less than 1  hr for efficient search for the episodic or highly variable sources _ etc_. the forthcoming _ stereoscopic _ arrays of the imaging air erenkov telescopes , like h.e.s.s .",
    "( high energy stereoscopic system ) , will exactly meet all those requirements .",
    "one can reach this conclusion using both the observational experience with the currently operating hegra ( high energy gamma ray astronomy ) instrument ( hereafter by hegra i denote the system of 5 iacts operated by the hegra collaboration ) as well as the specific monte carlo simulations .",
    "all that allows to predict reliably the performance of the h.e.s.s . which is briefly summarized below with the emphasize on the further advancements in the physics analysis of the observational data .",
    "although a good number of hardware parameters is different for h.e.s.s . as compared with hegra one can pick out several of those which are of the utmost importance .",
    "they are  _",
    "( i ) _ the larger diameter of the reflector ; _ ( ii ) _ better optics making use of a stable dish and better mirrors alignment ; _ ( iii ) _ smaller angular size of the pixels .",
    ".the hardware parameters of hegra and h.e.s.s . [ cols=\"<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     one can calculate the corresponding rate for h.e.s.s . which could be about 150 @xmath1-rays per min",
    "! such enormous statistics will allow the measurements of the spectral shape for the crab like @xmath1-ray sources after less then 1  hr of observations . the maximum @xmath1-ray detection rate for h.e.s.s .",
    "corresponds to the @xmath1-ray energy within @xmath350 - 100  gev ( see figure  1 ) . the uncertainty in the position of the peak is caused by the current uncertainties of the efficiencies along the over - all photon - to - photoelectron propagation chain .",
    "one can break the entire dynamic energy range ( extending up to @xmath4  tev and @xmath5  tev for the observations at high and low elevations , respectively ) into two parts ( see figure  1 ) . as for the _ high performance region _ ( above 100  gev ) h.e.s.s .",
    "will enable the high quality stereoscopic observations with the ability of high precision spectroscopy based on the images of a large size as well as high trigger multiplicity . at such energies the conventional data analysis developed for hegra could be of general use .",
    "it is important to note that the effective collection area of h.e.s.s . is larger then hegra , by a factor of @xmath6 , above 1  tev .",
    "it provides very high sensitivity of the h.e.s.s . in the multi - tev energy region . in the _ sub - threshold region _ ( see figure  1 )",
    "the erenkov light images are substantially affected by the telescope s trigger , have rather small angular size and poorly defined shape due to the large fluctuations .",
    "in addition for these images the night sky light contamination might be a severe problem .",
    "nevertheless , the search for the periodic @xmath1-ray signals ( e.g. , from the pulsars ) in the energy range below 50  gev could well be physically expedient , eventhough it may need to develop a specific analysis algorithms in particular for these observations .",
    "for a system of iacts the _ stereoscopic _ ( geometrical ) _ reconstruction _ of the air showers means the direct measurement of the orientation of the shower axis in space ; determination of the position of the shower core in the observation plane ; measurement of the angular dimensions of a shower , and height of its maximum ( the details of such reconstruction could be found elsewhere ) .",
    "the major parameters of the h.e.s.s .",
    "performance ( phase i ) , comprising 4 iacts in a system , are summarized in table  2 .",
    "the important issue of the h.e.s.s .",
    "performance is a sensitivity to the diffuse @xmath1-rays over the field of view ( fov ) ( see figure  2 ) .",
    "the analysis of the monte carlo events for h.e.s.s . does nt show a significant decrease in the angular resolution for the off - axis events whereas the detection rate drops down rather fast beyond @xmath7 ( see figure  2 ) .",
    "although a numerous attempts have been undertaken in past in order to improve the conventional stereoscopic algorithms , neither of those could gain much .",
    "the hegra , with its ability of the individual event time sampling , did not reveal a dominant use of the time profiles of the erenkov light flashes from the air shower ( at least for the minimum time bins of 8  ns ) . on the contrary , applied after imaging analysis ,",
    "the timing technique does not help at all .",
    "however , one could hope for a 0.5@xmath81  ghz signal processing devices the advantage of the event time sampling might be of great importance ( e.g. , for the night sky noise reduction etc ) .",
    "provided with a 50  hrs observational time looking at a point source , h.e.s.s .",
    "could see the @xmath1-rays of the flux as low as @xmath9 at the 5@xmath10 confidence level with the @xmath1-ray statistics exceeding 10 @xmath1 s .",
    "the minimum detectable flux for an extended @xmath1-ray source was estimated as @xmath11 no doubt such impressive sensitivity of future advanced ground based @xmath1-ray instrument allow to explore very effectively the sources of `` non - thermal emission in the universe '' ."
