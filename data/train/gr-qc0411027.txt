    "direct observations of gravitational waves ( gws ) will reveal new aspects of the universe @xcite . since gws are emitted by the bulk motion of matter , and are hardly absorbed or scattered , they have a potential to carry astrophysical and cosmological information different from that by electromagnetic waves . in order to create a new field of gw astronomy",
    ", several groups around the world are developing and operating gw detectors . among them",
    ", much effort is being made recently on interferometric detectors : ligo @xcite in u.s.a .",
    ", virgo @xcite and geo @xcite in europe , and tama @xcite in japan .",
    "these detectors have wide - frequency - band sensitivity between about 10hz and a few khz range , and have an ability to observe the waveform of a gw , which would contain astrophysical information . in these detectors ,",
    "both high sensitivity and high stability are required because gw signals are expected to be extremely faint and rare .",
    "there are several kinds of target gw sources in these interferometric detectors @xcite , and data - analysis schemes are being developed and applied to the observation data . since gw signals are considered to be faint , an efficient data - analysis scheme is required to extract the remains of gws from noisy detector outputs .",
    "the target gws are classified by the signal waveforms : chirp waves , continuous waves , burst waves , and so on .",
    "a chirp wave is a sinusoidal waveform with increasing frequency and amplitude in time , which is radiated from an inspiraling compact binary just before its merger .",
    "since this waveform is well - predicted , an effective and sophisticated method of matched filtering is used in chirp - wave search ; correlations between the data and a template ( the predicted waveform ) are calculated to extract a gw signal from noisy data @xcite .",
    "a continuous wave has a sinusoidal waveform with a stable frequency for over many years , which is radiated from a quasi - stationary compact binary or a rotating neutron star .",
    "a matched filtering method can also be used in the search for continuous waves from known sources , because we can predict their waveforms precisely by observations with electromagnetic waves @xcite .    a burst wave , which is the target of this article , is also a promising gravitational - waveform class .",
    "this wave has a short spike - like waveform with a duration time of less than 100msec , which is emitted from stellar - core collapse in a supernova explosion or a merger of a binary system . unlike the chirp and continuous - wave cases , a matched filtering method can not be used in a burst - wave analysis .",
    "this is because a set of precise waveform templates that cover the source parameters is not available , while typical waveforms are obtained by numerical simulations @xcite .",
    "thus , several signal - extraction methods , called burst filters , have been proposed for the detection of these burst gravitational waves : an excess power filter @xcite , a cluster filter in the time - frequency plane @xcite , a slope ( or a linear - fit ) filter @xcite , and a pulse correlation filter @xcite .",
    "since we have only a little knowledge on the waveforms , these filters look for unusual events in the gaussian - noise background .    for the detection of gws , evaluation and reduction of fake - event backgrounds",
    "are critical problems . in each analysis scheme described above",
    ", we define an evaluation filter ( such as a correlation with the template in a matched filtering method , and certain statistics describing any unusual behavior of the data in burst analyses ) , and record the filter output as a gw event trigger if it is above a given threshold .",
    "the event triggers usually contain fake events , which are caused by statistical and externally induced excesses in the detector noise level .",
    "although an ideal interferometric detector would have a stationary gaussian - noise behavior , the detector output is far from stationary in practice , affected by external disturbances , such as seismic motion , acoustic disturbance , changes in the temperature and pressure and so on . as a result",
    ", it is likely that real signals are buried in these fake events , or are dismissed with a larger detection threshold set to reduce fakes .",
    "thus , rejection of these fake events , or a veto in other words , is indispensable for the detection of gws . in a chirp - wave analysis case ,",
    "the output of the matched filter is less affected by non - stationary noises because it is only sensitive to a waveform similar to gws .",
    "in addition , since we know a precise waveform of the target gw signal , we can reject the fake events by evaluating how well the candidate waveform fits to the template @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , the affects of fake events are more serious and critical in the burst analysis case . since burst filters are designed to extract any unusual behavior of the detector output , they are also sensitive to non - stationary noises by their nature . moreover , it is not straightforward to distinguish these fakes from a real signal , and to reject them , because we do not know the precise gw waveforms .",
    "there are several schemes to reject these fake events : coincidences by multiple detectors , veto analyses with detector monitor signals , rejection by waveform behaviors , and so on . among them ,",
    "the most powerful and reliable way will be a coincidence analysis with multiple independent detectors @xcite . if we detect gravitational - wave candidates with multiple detectors simultaneously ( or within an acceptable time difference ) , we can declare the detection of a real signal with high confidence . in a rough estimation ,",
    "the fake rate is reduced by a power of the number of independent detectors . on the other hand , fake reduction with a single detector",
    "is also important , even in a coincidence analysis as the rejection of fakes with a single detector would reduce accidental coincidences . in observation",
    "runs , many auxiliary signals are recorded together with the gw signal - channel in order to monitor the detector status .",
    "since some of them are sensitive to detector instabilities , it is possible to reject non - stationary noises with them @xcite .",
    "in addition , even without precise gw waveforms , fake events are rejected by investigations of the signal behavior with our knowledge or assumptions on the waveforms @xcite .    in this article",
    ", we present a data - analysis scheme for burst gws , and results obtained by applying them to real observation data .",
    "the data used in this work were over 2700 hours of data obtained during the sixth , eighth , and ninth data - taking runs ( dt6 , dt8 , and dt9 , respectively ) of the tama300 detector @xcite .",
    "we adopted an excess power filter as a burst filter , which is robust for uncertainties of the gw waveforms @xcite .",
    "in addition , we used two fake - reduction methods .",
    "one was a veto with detector monitor signals .",
    "another was our new method of rejection based on the waveform behavior of the time scale .",
    "although there have been several previous works on similar veto methods @xcite , they were applied to a limited subset of observation data .",
    "we implemented these veto methods in our burst analysis code , analyzed real observation data , and evaluated their effectiveness .",
    "such a full - scale analysis is important because the effectiveness of the vetoes strongly depends on the quality of the real data .",
    "the obtained event triggers were interpreted from an astronomical point of view ; the results were used to set upper limits on galactic events .",
    "we carried out monte - carlo simulations of galactic events with waveforms obtained by numerical simulations of stellar - core collapses .",
    "in previous works , upper limits by real observations have been set with artificial waveform models of short spikes , gaussian waves , or sine - gaussian waves @xcite . on the other hand , realistic waveforms by numerical simulations",
    "have been used to evaluate the efficiencies of burst filters with simulated gaussian noises @xcite .",
    "we intended to set upper limits in a realistic way : using a realistic distribution of the galactic events , targeting at realistic waveforms obtained by numerical simulations , and analyzing long observation data from the detector . as a result",
    ", we expect to obtain prospects for both current and future research .",
    "this article is organized as follows . in sectionii",
    ", we overview our burst analysis : target waves , analyzed data , and our burst filter . in sectioniii , we describe veto methods with a monitor signal and the signal behavior .",
    "after that , we present analysis results and an interpretation of the results , setting an upper limit on the galactic events , in section iv . at last , we present discussions and a conclusion of our research in section v and vi .",
    "in this section , we overview the target gw signal characteristics , used data , and a burst filter used in this work .",
    "the target of the analysis in this work is a burst gw from stellar - core collapse ( core - collapse supernova explosion ) .",
    "it is difficult to predict its waveform analytically , because of the complex time evolution of the mass densities in the explosion process .",
    "thus , the explosion process and radiated gws have been investigated by numerical simulations @xcite .",
    "although these simulations were performed with differently simplified models , similar waveforms were obtained in these simulations .    among these simulations , dimmelmeier et al .",
    "have presented rather systematic surveys on gws from stellar - core collapses @xcite .",
    "they have obtained 26 waveforms with relativistic simulations of rotational supernova core collapses , with axisymmetric models with different initial conditions in a differential rotation , an initial rotation rate , and an adiabatic index at subnuclear densities . although the simulation did not cover all of the initial parameters , we used them as reference waveforms in our analysis , assuming that typical characteristics and behavior of the gws from stellar - core collapses are included in this waveform catalog .",
    "we processed the original waveforms of the catalog ( we call it dfm catalog in this article ) with a 30hz second - order high - pass digital filter , and resampled them to 20khz in order to be compatible with the data from the detector ( described in the next part ) .",
    "figure[fig - waves ] shows examples from the waveform catalog .",
    "while these waveforms have different behaviors , they have common characteristics : about a 1msec - short spike , and a total duration of less than 100msec . according to the dfm catalog ,",
    "the averaged amplitude of gws radiated by supernovae at the galactic center ( 8.5kpc distance from the detector ) is @xmath1 in a peak strain amplitude , or @xmath2 $ ] in root - sum - square ( rss ) amplitude . here",
    ", a rss amplitude is defined by @xmath3^{1/2},\\ ] ] where @xmath4 is the strain amplitude of the gw @xcite .",
    "the central frequencies of the waves range from 90hz to 1.2khz ( fig.[fig - waves_spe ] ) , which is around the observation band of interferometric detectors .",
    "also , it is estimated from the dfm catalog that a total energy radiated as gws in one event is @xmath5 $ ] , in average . here , @xmath6 is the mass of the sun .",
    ".summary of long data - taking runs by tama300 .",
    "the noise level and total observation data amount are described .",
    "the last column ( d.c . ) represents the duty cycle throughout the data - taking run .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     figure[fig - rej_rate ] shows the reduction factor of event triggers with two veto methods ; the ratio of the number of event triggers after and before the vetoes are plotted as a function of the snr threshold . in these runs ,",
    "both of the two vetoes contributed to the reduction of the rates .",
    "they worked in complementary ways .",
    "the intensity veto is effective to short - duration fakes and large snr fakes . on the other hand ,",
    "the time - scale veto is effective for the long - time instability of the detector output and small snr fakes .    in dt9",
    ", many event triggers were rejected as fakes by the intensity veto .",
    "this is because the pre - amplifier and whitening filter for the data acquisition of the intensity signal were improved in this run .",
    "since the reduction factor is better for large snr fakes , it is expected that the reduction ratio will be further improved with a higher detection efficiency of the intensity instabilities . on the other hand ,",
    "only a small fraction of fakes were rejected by the time - scale selection in dt9 because the detector operation was sufficiently stable .",
    "the detector was operated very stably thanks to a quiet seismic environment during the holiday weeks in the second half of dt9 .",
    "in addition , the drift of the typical noise level was small at that time . in dt6 ,",
    "the time - scale veto was much more effective than the intensity veto .",
    "this is because dt6 data contained noisy data originating in an instability of the laser source and seismic disturbances during the daytime .",
    "the rates are still much larger than that with simulated gaussian noises , even with the vetoes and the improvements in the detector .",
    "in addition , the trigger rate is still much higher than the expected rate of supernova explosions .",
    "the expected gw event rate is one event in a few tens of years , i.e. about @xmath7events / sec in our galaxy .",
    "( here , note that tama has an ability to detect only events within 300pc away from earth at best . )",
    "these results suggest that most of the observed trigger - events were fake events caused by an instability of the detector , even with vetoes .",
    "since the event - trigger rate is still much larger than that expected from ideal gaussian noise or observed supernova rates , we can not claim the detection of gw signals from the data - analysis results .",
    "thus , we set upper limits for stellar - core collapse events in our galaxy .",
    "we carried out monte - carlo simulations with a source - distribution model of our galaxy , and with waveforms from the dfm catalog .",
    "the simulated data were analyzed in the same way as the detector data , and compared with the observation results .    in the simulation , we adopted a source - distribution model based on the observed luminous star distribution in our galaxy , assuming that the event distribution of the stellar - core collapses was identical to it .",
    "there have been studies on the star - distribution model based on sky - survey observations @xcite . in our simulation",
    ", we used a simple axisymmetric distribution model ( an exponential disk model ) described in a cylindrical coordinates , @xmath8 where @xmath9 , @xmath10kpc , and @xmath11pc are the density of the events , and the characteristic radius and height of the density of the galactic disk , respectively . as well as the non - axisymmetric components , such as spiral arms , the thick disk and halo structures were neglected in our simulations because their number of stars was only about 3% of that of the disk component @xcite .",
    "we adopted @xmath12kpc and @xmath13pc for the position of the sun in our simulation .",
    "we used 200hours stable data in the second half of dt9 for the galactic signal - injection test .",
    "this test was performed according to the following steps : ( i ) set the gps times at which simulated events are injected ; these times are uniformly separated between the start and end times of the observation run .",
    "decide the position of each event randomly according to the galactic - event distribution described by eq.([eq - gal - dist ] ) .",
    "select the waveform of each event randomly from the dfm catalog .",
    "( ii ) calculate the distance and sky direction seen from the detector for each event , from the position of the event in the galaxy and the injection time information .",
    "( iii ) the expected gw amplitude is calculated from the distance to the event source and the detector antenna pattern for the sky position of the event .",
    "we assumed non - polarized gws ; the gw power is equally distributed to the two polarizations .",
    "( iv ) inject each event waveform to the tama300 data with estimated amplitude , and analyze the data with a similar code as that for the raw - data analysis .",
    "( v ) extract the events at the injected time .",
    "figure[fig - gal - res1 ] shows the results of a galactic - event simulation .",
    "the fraction of the detectable galactic events ( the detection efficiency , @xmath14 , left axis ) is plotted as a function of the snr threshold ( @xmath15 ) .",
    "the event - trigger rate in dt9 is also plotted for a comparison ( right axis ) . with an event - selection threshold of @xmath16 ( which corresponds to averaged amplitude of @xmath17 $ ] for dt9 ) ,",
    "the detection efficiency was estimated to be @xmath18 for the galactic events .",
    "the threshold was selected so that the expected contribution of the gaussian noise would be sufficiently small ( less than 1% of the triggers above the threshold ) .",
    "the upper limit for the event rate determined from the tama raw - data was @xmath19events / sec with a confidence level of 90% . from these results",
    ", we obtained the upper limit for the galactic event rate to be @xmath20[events / sec ] with a 90% confidence level.[events / sec ] and @xmath21/sec ] . ]",
    "this value is considerably larger than the theoretical expectation of about @xmath7events / sec .    besides the upper limit for the rate of a stellar - core collapse in our galaxy",
    ", an upper limit was set for the gw energy rate . the total energy radiated as gw , @xmath22 , was estimated for each event from its waveform .",
    "the upper limit for the energy rate radiated as gw was estimated by the product of the event - rate upper limit , @xmath23 , and the averaged gw energy of the events , @xmath24 . as a result",
    ", we obtained @xmath25/sec ] .",
    "again , this value is considerably large ; the rate of the total energy radiated as gws would be about @xmath26/years ] , where @xmath27 is the total mass of our galaxy , which we assume to be @xmath28 .",
    "there are uncertainties in setting the upper limits by several origins . here",
    ", we consider the effect of the detector calibration error , statistical error in the monte - carlo simulation for the galactic events , and the error in the galactic model .",
    "the calibration error in the conversion of the detector output to the gw strain amplitude was estimated to be less than 1% .",
    "this calibration error causes an amplitude error in the signal - injection test . from eq.([eq - snr ] ) and the results of the galactic signal - injection test , the uncertainty in the upper limit is estimated to be 2.9% with a detector calibration error of 1% . on the other hand , the statistical error in the monte - carlo simulation is determined by the number of the simulated events above the threshold .",
    "we generated @xmath29 galactic events , and detected @xmath30 events above the threshold of @xmath16 . assuming that the number of detected events follows a poisson distribution , the event - rate uncertainty is 0.9% .",
    "at last , the error in the galactic model would affect the results .",
    "the parameter @xmath31 in the galactic model has an error of 9.4% @xcite .",
    "this error corresponds to a 5.8% uncertainty in the detection efficiency for the galactic events ( @xmath32 ) with a threshold of @xmath16 , which was estimated by additional simulations . in total , the uncertainty in our upper - limit results is 6.5% at most .",
    "the detection efficiency will be reduced ( the upper limit will be increased ) by 1.2% by including a thick disk and halo components .",
    "we interpreted the observation results from the viewpoint of the galactic event rate in the previous section . in this part",
    ", we interpret the results in an similar way as in the previous studies for a comparison ; we set an upper limit on the rate of gw events incident on the detector as a function of the gw amplitude @xcite .",
    "we used 200 hours of data in the dt9 stable term , and set an upper limit on the rate of the events received by the detector , following the procedure to set the upper limits by the ligo group @xcite . at first",
    ", the detection threshold was fixed , and the upper limit was set at the number of the events above the threshold with a given confidence level .",
    "then , the detection efficiency for a given gw amplitude was estimated by a software signal - injection test . here , the events were distributed randomly on the celestial sphere in order to include the directivity of the detector .",
    "we investigated the gaussian ( with a time scale of @xmath33 and 1[msec ] ) and sine - gaussian waveforms ( with q - value of 9 and central frequencies of 554 , 850 , and 1304hz ) for a comparison with the previous studies , as well as the waveforms from the dfm catalog .",
    "finally , we estimated the upper limit on the event rate from the upper limit on the number of events , @xmath34 , the detection efficiencies , @xmath35 , and the observation time , @xmath36 , by @xmath37 .",
    "we set the threshold to be @xmath38 , which resulted in one trigger above the threshold .",
    "assuming poisson statistics , we obtained the corresponding upper limit of 3.89 events with a confidence level of 90% . the detection efficiencies and the upper limit results",
    "are shown in fig.[fig - upper1 ] ( waveforms from the dfm catalog ) and fig.[fig - upper2 ] ( gaussian and sine - gaussian waveforms ) .",
    "the upper limit for sufficiently large events ( ex . @xmath39 $ ] ) was 0.49 events / day with a confidence level of 90% .",
    "this upper limit is comparable to the ligo - s1 result of 1.6 event / day @xcite and the glasgow - mpq coincidence result of 0.89 events / day @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the resonant detector network has set an upper limit of @xmath40 events / day @xcite .",
    "these differences in the upper limits come mostly from the different observation times . as for the sensitivity for smaller amplitude signals , the gw amplitude for 50% detection efficiencies ( averaged over source directions ) was around @xmath41 for short and high - frequency waveforms in our case .",
    "the upper limit curve is almost comparable with the ligo - s1 results for high - frequency signals , and larger for lower frequency ( @xmath42 800hz ) ones @xcite .",
    "the large event rate and upper limit results show that the detector output is still dominated by fake events , even after these vetoes .",
    "thus , further research efforts are necessary to detect burst gravitational waves . in this part",
    ", we discuss the outlook to better vetoes , coincidence analyses with other observatories , and better performance of the detector and data - processing scheme .    in section[sec - veto1",
    "] , we presented a veto analysis method with only one monitor signal , an intensity monitor .",
    "similar methods can be used with the other monitor signals along with careful investigations of their correlations with the main output of the detector .",
    "however , we have found no other monitor signal with a clear correlation so far : laser power at the signal - port ( the dark port ) , monitors for the seismic fluctuations , an acoustic monitor signal .",
    "thus , it is necessary to investigate more deeply the monitor signals , and to introduce better monitor signals that are sensitive to the detector instabilities .",
    "there are other event - selection criteria than the time - scale selection method presented in section[sec - veto2 ] .",
    "for example , the time scale of an event can be simply evaluated by the duration time above the event - selection threshold . in this case",
    ", we should consider that the veto results will be strongly dependent on the event amplitude .. in these methods , we can not avoid huge gw events from being rejected by the veto . ]",
    "we will be able to reduce fake events even further by knowing the common characteristics of the target events , and setting them as event - selection criteria .",
    "for this , more systematic and precise simulations of stellar - core collapses and investigation on the waveform will be helpful .",
    "coincidence analyses with the other detectors for gws , electromagnetic waves , and neutrinos will improve the result significantly , though we have focused on the reduction of fakes with a single detector in this article .",
    "the observation runs by tama300 ( dt8 and dt9 ) were carried out at the same term as the ligo second and third scientific ( observation ) runs ( called s2 and s3 ) , and coincidence analyses are underway @xcite .",
    "we note that our work discussed in this article is also a part of the ligo - tama coincidence analysis ; the list of the event triggers obtained in our work will be used in the coincidence analysis .",
    "in addition to a reduction of fakes , the improvements of the detector both in the floor noise level and in the reduction of non - stationary noises are also important .",
    "the performance of the tama300 detector has gradually been improved from dt6 to dt9 concerning both the noise level and the stability , and the detector still has room for improvement .",
    "in addition , burst filters with higher efficiencies are under development in the tama group and other groups .",
    "since we can only observe events within about the 300pc range with the current sensitivity of tama , the detection efficiency for the galactic events is very small ( @xmath43 with a threshold for a noise - equivalent gw amplitude ) .",
    "the sensitivity should be improved by about two orders so as to cover our galaxy , and to realize a sufficiently large detection efficiency .",
    "this sensitivity will be realized by the next - generation detectors , such as lcgt ( fig.[fig - waves_spe ] ) @xcite and advanced ligo @xcite .",
    "we presented data - analysis schemes and results of observation data by tama300 , targeting at burst signals from stellar - core collapses . since precise waveforms are not available for burst gravitational waves , the detection schemes ( the construction of a detection filter and the rejection of fake events ) are different from those for chirp wave analyses .",
    "we investigated two methods for the reduction of non - stationary noises , and applied them to real data from the tama300 interferometric gravitational wave detector . as a result , these veto methods , a veto with a detector monitor signal and a veto by time - scale selection , worked efficiently in a complimentary way .",
    "the former and the latter were effective for short - spike noises and for slow instabilities of the detector , respectively .",
    "the fake - event rate was reduced by a factor of about 1000 in the best case .",
    "the obtained event - trigger rate was interpreted from the viewpoint of the burst gravitational - wave events in our galaxy . from the observation and analysis results , we set an upper limit for the galactic event rate to be @xmath0 events / sec ( confidence level 90% ) , based on a galactic disk model @xcite and waveforms obtained by numerical simulations of stellar - core collapses @xcite . in addition , we determined the upper limit for the rate of the energy radiated as gravitational - wave bursts to be @xmath44/sec ( confidence level 90% ) .",
    "these large upper limits show that the detector output was still dominated by fake events , even after the selection of events , and gives us prospects on both current and future research : the necessity for further improvement of the analysis schemes , coincidence analyses with multiple detectors , better predictions on the waveforms , and future detectors , such as lcgt and advanced ligo , to cover the whole of our galaxy .",
    "this work has set , we believe , a milestone for these research activities .",
    "this research is supported in part by a grant - in - aid for scientific research on priority areas ( 415 ) of the ministry of education , culture , sports , science and technology .",
    "in this part , we detail the excess - power filter .",
    "we assume that the output of a detector is comprised of an ideal stationary gaussian noise , @xmath45 , and a signal , @xmath46 ( non - gaussian component caused by gravitational waves or instability of the detector ) : @xmath47 .",
    "the power spectrum is calculated for every @xmath48 data chunk with given time - delays ( @xmath49 ) , using a fast fourier transform ( fft ) . as a result",
    ", we obtain a spectrogram ( a time - frequency plane ) of the noise ( or signal ) power with @xmath50 time separation and @xmath51 frequency resolution . here , the fourier component is also described by the sum of the noise and the signal : @xmath52 , where @xmath53 and @xmath54 represent the indices for the frequency and time , respectively . then , the power in each time - frequency component is described by @xmath55 .",
    "+    in order to make our filter equally effective for all of the analysis frequencies , we normalize the power spectrum by an averaged noise level , @xmath56 , where @xmath57 is the number of time components used for the average .",
    "then , the normalized power is written as @xmath58 where @xmath59 , @xmath60 , and @xmath61 , meaning a normalized noise power , a normalized signal power , and a normalized correlation between the signal and noise components , respectively . since @xmath62 has a gaussian noise distribution",
    ", @xmath63 has a @xmath64 distribution of two degrees of freedom ( an exponential distribution ) : @xmath65 .",
    "then , the output of the excess - power filter , the averaged power for a given time component , is written as @xmath66 where @xmath67 is the number of frequency components used in the average ; only the values of the power in pre - selected frequency components are used to calculate the averaged power , @xmath68 . from eq.([eq - p_mn ] ) , @xmath69 is written as @xmath70 where @xmath71 , @xmath72 , and @xmath73 .",
    "this represents the time evolution of the power in detector output in given frequency bands .",
    "the data from the detector is not an ideal gaussian noise , in practice ; the noise spectrum is not white , the noise level changes in time , and many line peaks are included in the output .",
    "thus , data conditioning before processing the excess power filter is indispensable .",
    "the spectrum contains several line peaks : harmonics of 50hz ac line , violin mode peaks ( around 520hz and integer multiples ) of the suspension wire of the mirror , and a calibration peak .",
    "these line peaks are removed in the following processes . at first",
    ", we obtain a fourier spectrum from 72sec of data by fft .",
    "we then set the line - frequency components to be zero .",
    "in addition , the lower frequency components below 160hz are also rejected . at last , we obtain a time - series data by calculating the inverse fft of the spectrum . with this process",
    ", the line peaks are clearly removed from the spectrum ( fig.[fig - rm1 ] , [ fig - rm2 ] ) . moreover , since only a small number of frequency components are rejected , the burst waveforms are not vary much affected by the line removal process .",
    "the frequency and time dependences of the noise spectrum are compensated by the normalization with the averaged noise power spectrum , @xmath74 .",
    "we calculated @xmath74 by averaging the power spectra for 30min before the data analyzed by the excess - power filter . in order to avoid the large spikes from disturbing the averaged spectrum",
    ", we rejected noisy 0.7% spectra from those used in each average .",
    "we found that we could obtain stable averaged spectra , and that each spectrum was normalized well with this method .",
    "in this part , we describe the details of the veto method with time - scale evaluation of the event triggers . in our veto methods ,",
    "each event is evaluated by the statistics in a @xmath76 data chunk ( @xmath77 : the time of the event ) . here",
    ", @xmath78 data points of the excess - power - filter output are contained in the time window @xmath79 , i.e. @xmath80 . from the output of the excess - power filter , @xmath69 , we define the evaluation parameters @xmath81 and @xmath82 as @xmath83 where @xmath84 , and @xmath85 are the first- and second - order moments of @xmath68 for @xmath86 data points , respectively , written as : @xmath87 here , note that @xmath84 is an averaged power for @xmath88 time - frequency components .",
    "on the other hand , @xmath89 is defined by the second - order moment normalized by the averaged power .",
    "this value is analogous to the kurtosis ( defined by the fourth - order moment of data ) , which describes any non - gaussianity of the data @xcite .",
    "we calculate the statistics of parameters @xmath84 and @xmath85 as a preparation for calculating the statistics of the parameters @xmath81 and @xmath89 , defined in eq.([eq - c1c2 ] ) .",
    "although the @xmath88 components are not independent in practice , because of overlapping in time and a window function , we describe the following calculations while assuming that they are independent , for simplicity . in practical use ,",
    "the statistics ( the averages , the variances , and the covariance ) are estimated by replacing the time and frequency window size , @xmath86 and @xmath91 , by effective time and frequency range , @xmath92 and @xmath93 .",
    "the effective window sizes , @xmath92 and @xmath93 , are estimated by simulations with gaussian noises .    from eq.([eq - p_mn_sum ] ) , @xmath84 is also written by the sum of the noise , signal , and their correlation terms .",
    "thus , the expected value is @xmath94 where we define the average of the signal component power by @xmath95 and we use relations @xmath96 and @xmath97 .",
    "the expected value of the square of @xmath98 is written as @xmath99 where we use relations @xmath100 @xmath101 , @xmath102 , and so on .",
    "thus , the variance of @xmath98 is written as @xmath103    on the other hand , the expected value of @xmath90 is @xmath104 where @xmath105 is a constant value related to the second - order moment of the signal , @xmath106 similarly , a constant value , @xmath107 , is written as @xmath108 .",
    "the constant numbers @xmath109 , @xmath105 and @xmath107 are determined only by the waveform and the amplitude of the signal .",
    "the value @xmath110 represents the normalized signal power .",
    "the value @xmath105 depends on the time scale of the signal ; @xmath105 becomes large for a short signal .",
    "on the other hand , the expected value and the variance of @xmath89 are obtained as @xcite @xmath117 where @xmath118 thus , we obtain the mean and variance of @xmath114 , @xmath119 and the covariance of @xmath113 and @xmath114 , @xmath120 here , we have neglected the higher terms , such as @xmath121 , @xmath122 .      from the calculations described above , we can estimate the expected values as @xmath123 and @xmath124 when the waveform and amplitude are given .",
    "figure[fig - t - model ] shows the expected points for given waveforms in the @xmath114-@xmath113 plane ; each curve is plotted by sweeping the power @xmath109 .",
    "when @xmath110 is small , the ( @xmath114 , @xmath113 ) point is around ( 0 , 1 ) independently of the waveform ( @xmath125 ) .",
    "( here , we assume @xmath126 . ) on the other hand , the position has a strong dependence on the @xmath105 parameter for large @xmath109 : @xmath127 , for @xmath128 .",
    "since signals with different time scales have different @xmath125 values , they appear along different loci .    since the average time , @xmath129 , is finite , and since the data contains the gaussian noise components , the ( @xmath114 , @xmath113 ) data points have a distribution around the predicted curve shown in fig.[fig - t - model ] . with an approximation",
    "that @xmath129 ( or data point number @xmath86 ) is sufficiently large , the ( @xmath114 , @xmath113 ) points for given @xmath130 and @xmath125 have a two - dimensional gaussian distribution , determined by the expected values ( @xmath123 and @xmath124 ) , the variances ( @xmath131 and @xmath132 ) , and the covariance @xmath133 .",
    "we define the distance between a reference point , which is calculated by a gravitational waveform ( a reference waveform ) , and a data point by @xmath134 where @xmath135 , @xmath136 , and @xmath137 are defined by @xmath138 , @xmath139 , and @xmath140 , respectively ( fig.[fig - model ] ) .",
    "this distance , which is normalized by the variances and covariance , represents how similar these points are ; if @xmath141 is small , the data point has a similar amplitude and a time scale as that of the reference point . here , the minimum distance ( @xmath142 ) for various amplitudes ( @xmath130 ) is the similarity of the time scales of the data point and the reference waveform .",
    "thus , we use @xmath143 to distinguish fakes from the true gw signals .",
    "if the data points have a two - dimensional gaussian distribution around their mean point , and if the variances and covariance are sufficiently smaller than the curvature of the locus , the minimal distance ( @xmath143 ) approximately obeys an exponential distribution , @xmath144    for a practical implementation of the veto scheme , we should consider the acceptability of multiple reference waveforms and a reduction of the computational load .",
    "thus , we adopted a conservative way for the veto analysis ; we reject only the events with longer time scales than the longest one in the reference waveforms ( fig.[fig - table ] ) .",
    "we use one waveforms with the smallest @xmath125 value , i.e. with the longest time scale , as the reference waveform , and set @xmath145 if the data point is on the right side of the reference locus in the @xmath113-@xmath114 plot .",
    "in addition , we prepare a map of @xmath142 in the @xmath113-@xmath114 plane before the data analysis , so as to reduce the computational load during the data analysis .",
