    "for an isolated quantum many - body system totally decoupled from the environment , the system can act as its own heat bath .",
    "one way to distinguish systems which reach the thermalized state from those which do nt is by studying the entanglement entropy of a subsystem .",
    "if a subsystem is in thermal equilibrium , the entanglement and thermal entropies must be the same and thus must satisfy a volume law , i.e. , the entropy should scale like @xmath0 in @xmath1 dimensions .",
    "this is different from the typical scaling behavior of the entanglement entropy of ground states , which under some constraints , satisfy an area law scaling.@xcite    evidence has recently accumulated for a certain class of interacting systems with quenched disorder which fail to thermalize .",
    "these systems go under the name many - body localization@xcite ( mbl ) and are the interacting analogue of anderson insulators.@xcite this failure to thermalize has been attributed to an extensive number of locally conserved charges.@xcite for a review of mbl phases , see the recent review of ref . .",
    "in an anderson insulator , all single - particle eigenstates are exponentially localized in real space , quantum diffusion is impossible at zero temperature and the system is an insulator on macroscopic scales.@xcite in such a state thermalization is not possible ( without an external heat bath ) .",
    "it has been suggested that many - body localization results from a similar localization of states in hilbert space.@xcite    the phenomenon of mbl is principally ( and theoretically ) observed in states deep in the excited state spectrum of a macroscopic system , and hence have an extensive _ excitation energy _",
    "which , following standard ( but somewhat inexact ) terminology , we will call ` finite energy density ' states . as a function of some tuning parameter ( typically disorder ) , there can be a phase transition from an ergodic ( thermalized ) phase to an mbl phase .",
    "in contrast to its non - interacting counterpart ( the anderson insulator ) , an mbl phase transition can occur at finite temperature.@xcite we should note that phonons may interfere with the observation of an mbl phase in solids , but mbl may be physically realized in optical lattice systems , see e.g. ref . .",
    "in this paper we consider the problem of the mbl phase transition by constructing an ensemble of simple ` model ' many - body wave functions with a simple structure parameterized by a ` disorder ' strength , and study the phase transition as a function of this parameter .",
    "we will show that , in spite of their simple structure , these model wave function can represent both thermal states and mbl states .",
    "the wave functions that we consider have a structure similar to the rokhsar - kivelson ( rk ) states@xcite and their generalizations.@xcite more specifically , we consider states that are linear superpositions of quantum states labeled by the classical configurations of a system of @xmath2 ising spins , and have the form |_rem = _ \\ { } w [ ] | , [ eq : rk ] here the quantum mechanical amplitude @xmath3 $ ] for a configuration @xmath4 of the ising spins is given by the gibbs weight of a classical spin glass model known as the random energy model , i.e. @xmath5 \\propto e^{-\\beta e[\\mathcal{c } ] } \\label{eq : rem - weights}\\ ] ] where the ` energy ' @xmath6 $ ] assigned to the configuration @xmath4 is taken to be a random number drawn from a gaussian distribution . by construction ,",
    "the amplitudes of these states @xmath3 $ ] are positive real numbers .",
    "the associated classical spin glass model in infinite space dimension ( since each spin is coupled to all the other @xmath7 spins ) is known to have a classical thermodynamic phase transition to a spin glass state.@xcite the parameter @xmath8 , which in the classical spin glass model is the inverse temperature , but in this work will be used as a parameter of the wave function .",
    "notice that we have not defined a quantum hamiltonian for which the wave function of eq . is an eigenstate and , hence , we have not actually defined an energy for the quantum system .",
    "thus , the ` energy ' of the random energy model should not be confused with the energy of the quantum state .",
    "the quantum state @xmath9 has the manifestly positive weights shown in eq ..",
    "such a state can be a natural candidate for a ground state of a hamiltonian but not for a typical excited state",
    "whose amplitudes are generally non - positive . to mimic a ` typical ' state deep in the spectrum of a quantum system , we generalize this construction so that , for a given configuration @xmath10 , the amplitudes for these new states are just a _ random sign _ multiplied by the amplitude @xmath11 discussed above ( a similar approach has been used in ref . and ref .. ) we will denote the new wave functions by @xmath12\\rangle$ ] . here",
    "we will also consider the wave function without random signs denoted by @xmath13\\rangle$ ] and compare the physical properties of both types of wave functions .",
    "an advantageous aspect of our approach is that we have more analytical control over this system then is typical in interacting disorder systems .",
    "in addition we are able to perform numerical calculations with a system size ( @xmath14 ) which can only be achieved in other numerical mbl studies with the use of matrix - product states @xcite .",
    "these wave functions are also conceptually simple , making them an ideal setting to further our understanding of mbl .",
    "laumann , pal and scardicchio studied numerically the mbl state in the _ quantum _ random energy model and found that the mbl quantum phase transition is distinct from the quantum phase transition to the spin - glass phase.@xcite here we will find that in the rk wave functions @xmath15 , although they are not actual eigenstates of the quantum rem model , the mbl and spin - glass transitions are also separate .    in this work",
    "we will be focused on three particular aspects of the problem- the transition to the mbl phase , the scaling of the entanglement entropy with subsystem size and the transition from being geometrically delocalized to localized in the hilbert space . to identify the ergodic and mbl phases",
    ", we use the rnyi entanglement entropies @xmath16 ( where @xmath17 is the rnyi index ) @xmath18 of a subsystem @xmath19 whose size @xmath20 is smaller than half of the entire system . in the limit @xmath21",
    ", @xmath16 converges to the von neumann entropy . in an ergodic system",
    ", there is a regime where the rnyi entropy obeys a volume law which changes linearly as a function of @xmath22 .",
    "bauer and nayak have argued that , for most states in an mbl phase , their entanglement entropy scales at most as an area law of the subsystem size.@xcite we will show below that , in our mbl phase , the rnyi entropy is sub - extensive as a function of subsystem size and is bounded by a finite constant deep inside the mbl phase ( fig .",
    "[ fig : schematic ] ) .",
    "we take particular note of volume laws at an energy density that corresponds to infinite temperature ( itv ) which scales as @xmath23 .",
    "the scaling behavior of the entanglement entropy may depend on the subsystem size often showing a crossover from itv to sub - extensive as the subsystem gets larger .",
    "an important subtlety of our model comes from the lack of correlation length in the rem ( inherent in a system at infinite dimension ) .",
    "this makes the relevant parameter to consider in looking for such a crossover not the absolute size @xmath22 but the ratio @xmath24 and our results will be quoted as a function of this parameter .",
    "while entanglement entropy can be used to distinguishing mbl from ergodic phases , geometric localization is a measure of compactness of the wave function in hilbert space . in an anderson insulator ,",
    "the localization is of the single - particle wave function in real space and can be characterized by the inverse participation ratio defined as @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the probability distribution of single - particle state in real space.@xcite generically , @xmath27 takes the scaling form @xmath28 where the exponent @xmath29 . for the extensive (",
    "delocalized ) state , @xmath30 , while for the localized state @xmath31 . for the critical single - particle wave function at the mobility edge",
    ", @xmath32 has a non - trivial dependence on @xmath17 , and it indicates that the critical wave function has a multifractal nature .",
    "@xcite for non - interacting systems , this multifractal behavior@xcite is also manifest in the rnyi entropy for the single - particle critical wave function.@xcite    here we will present evidence that multifractal behavior also appears in the entanglement near the phase transition into the mbl phase by looking at the scaling behavior of the rnyi entropies . loosely speaking the many - body generalization of this multifractality measures the degree of localization of states in the multi - dimensional hilbert space ( in a real - space basis ) and not just those of a single particle orbital .",
    "multifractal behavior of weight of a state in a hilbert space has been studied recently by several authors.@xcite in these studies multifractality is used to characterize the geometry of a state in hilbert space , i.e. its degree of localization in the hilbert space . in those works ,",
    "the shannon - rnyi entropies used to quantify the multifractal behavior of the many - body states is a measure of the statistical properties of the wave functions as probability distributions and are unrelated to the concept of quantum entanglement .",
    "multifractality has also been discussed in connection with the fidelity of the ground state wave functions in systems at the infinite - disorder fixed point.@xcite so far as we know , multifractal behavior of quantum entanglement in wave functions close to the mbl transition has not been discussed previously in the literature .",
    "this is one of the main questions that we address in our work .      in this paper",
    ", we consider the mbl transition , the value of @xmath33 and the geometric localization of the wave function @xmath34\\rangle$ ] .",
    "we show that the wave - function geometrically localizes in hilbert space at @xmath35 .",
    "we also find three regimes of entanglement scaling for @xmath36 : a thermalized regime ( at infinite temperature ) where the entanglement entropies for a partition show volume law scaling as a function of the subsystem size @xmath22 ; a regime bounded by constant entanglement entropy ; and a regime which is sub - extensive but not constant .",
    "the transition from sub - extensive to constant happens at , or before , the geometric localization transition .",
    "notice that the presence of extensive scaling for any @xmath37 implies that the finite size scaling of @xmath38 as a function of @xmath2 at a fixed @xmath22 is also extensive .",
    "because @xmath39 is hard to compute exactly , we analytically calculate lower and upper bounds for it .",
    "in addition , we identify the mbl transition ( with respect to the second renyi entropy ) via a numerical scaling collapse with @xmath40 and @xmath41 @xcite ( see section [ sec : finite_size - scaling ] ) .",
    "we find that the the mbl transition is different from the geometric localization transition and therefore the wave - function is still geometrically delocalized in hilbert space at the mbl transition @xcite .",
    "while the entanglement entropy @xmath42 scales sub - extensively with @xmath22 at the mbl transition , the transition to sub - extensive scaling does nt correspond to the mbl transition .",
    "in addition , the numerical evidence suggests that the mbl transition ( for @xmath43 , at @xmath44 ) happens at a @xmath8 where @xmath45 as a function of @xmath2 still scales extensively .",
    "while these statements hold for @xmath43 , we also consider @xmath16 , finding that the mbl transition as well as the analytic bounds for sub - itv scaling happen for different @xmath17 at different @xmath8 .",
    "the former of these appears to scale linearly in @xmath46 .",
    "in addition , the scaling exponents identified from scaling collapse are different for different @xmath17 .",
    "this is an indication of multifractal behavior .",
    "we further study the entanglement spectrum in this regime and observe an entanglement gap between the lower continuous band and the other higher eigenvalues and show that this feature explains transitions which differ for different @xmath17 . in fig.[fig",
    ": schematic ] a and b , we give a succinct and broad summary of the phase diagram ( including the phase diagram of the classical rem for comparison ) .",
    "we also explain the importance of the random sign structure .",
    "this effect we compare the behavior of the second rnyi entropies @xmath47 for @xmath15 with @xmath9 without random sign .",

    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec : rk ] , we explain the construction of a rokhsar - kivelson - type wave function which assigns to the amplitude of a quantum many - body state the gibbs weight of a classical spin glass model ( the random energy model ) and introduce a random sign structure into it to access represent typical excited states with a _ finite excitation energy density_. in section [ sec : rem ]",
    "we briefly review the classical random energy model ( rem ) and interpret the classical spin glass phase transition in it . in the section [ sec : random_sign ]",
    "we construct a rem wave function with a random sign structure to mimic a highly excited state for a hamiltonian with disorder .",
    "we will analytically compute the rnyi entropy to show that there is a thermalized regime and a many - body localized phase . in section",
    "[ sec : numerical - results ] we calculate the rnyi entropy numerically and find the location of mbl phase transition by finite size scaling . in the section [ sec : random - sign - structure ]",
    "we study the rnyi entropy for the rem wave function without random sign and demonstrate the importance of the sign structure . in the section [ sec : conclusions ] we summarize our results and conclude that there is a mbl phase transition in the rem wave function with random sign structure .",
    "in the physics of strongly correlated systems there are many examples in which the properties of a new state of matter can be represented by simple ` model ' wave functions .",
    "the best known examples of such model wave functions include the bcs wave function for the ground state of a superconductor and the laughlin wave function for the fractional quantum hall fluid",
    ".      in this paper we will give a description of the mbl states using a particularly simple class of model wave functions with a structure similar to the one proposed by rokhsar and kivelson ( rk ) to capture the physics of the ground states of strongly frustrated quantum antiferromagnets.@xcite in the rk construction the quantum mechanical amplitude of a many - body state is given by a local function of the degrees of freedom , as expressed in the orthonormal basis set @xmath56 where @xmath4 is the ` configuration space ' .",
    "in the rk problem the configuration space is the set of dimer coverings of a 2d lattice .",
    "while in the rk case the dimers are a qualitative representation of spin singlets on each bond of the lattice , a picture of this type has been generalized to many other systems , including kitaev s toric code state,@xcite which represents the topological ( or deconfined ) phase of a @xmath57 gauge theory .",
    "since the weights of the rk wave functions are local and positive , they can also be regarded as the gibbs weights of a related problem in classical statistical mechanics with the same degrees of freedom on the same lattice .",
    "thus if the basis of orthonormal states is the set @xmath58 , i.e. such that @xmath59 , the generalized normalized rk states are @xmath60 } |\\mathcal{c}\\rangle \\label{wave1}\\ ] ] where @xmath61}\\ ] ] here @xmath62 $ ] and @xmath63 are , respectively , the energy for the classical configuration @xmath4 and the partition function for the associated classical problem , and @xmath8 plays the role of the inverse temperature .",
    "the original rk wave function is an equal - amplitude superposition of all dimer coverings in @xmath64 .",
    "this wave function can be associated with the partition function for the classical dimer model and is also the ground state of the quantum dimer model at the critical point @xcite ( for 2d bipartite lattices ) and a @xmath57 topological state@xcite ( for non - bipartite lattices ) .",
    "states of these type are exact ground states of a special type of quantum hamiltonians that are the sum of projection operators and are closely related to classical dynamics.@xcite    the generalized rk wave function @xmath9 inherits many properties from the classical model . for instance , the equal time correlation function of the wave function is the same as the correlation function of the classical model , and the quantum critical point in the wave function corresponds to the classical phase transition at temperature @xmath65 .",
    "we want to consider our family of wave functions as representing finite energy density states with the possibility of supporting both ergodic and mbl phases .",
    "as we noted above , there exists hamiltonians constructed by projection operators for which the rk wave functions of the form of eq .",
    "are the exact ground states .",
    "however , we should note that its amplitudes are all strictly positive .",
    "if the classical hamiltonian used to generate the rk state only has local interactions , we can show this state must have an area law .",
    "this follows from the fact that one can write a schmidt decomposition of the state where the number of terms is bounded by the number of classical interactions which are broken ( see appendix a for detail ) .",
    "the entanglement properties of these type of states have been discussed in great detail in the case of the quantum dimer model,@xcite of the associated quantum lifshitz model,@xcite and of the toric code state.@xcite    to have the potential for ergodic states , then , we must either use a non - local classical hamiltonian or introduce directly a more rich sign structure into the wave function as done , e.g. , in refs . .",
    "while the classical hamiltonian we are using for the rem model is non - local , it nonetheless supports an area law at low disorder ; in fact , at @xmath66 , the entanglement entropy is zero over any cut .",
    "therefore , we introduce a random sign structure in the wave function giving @xmath67 } |\\mathcal{c}\\rangle , \\label{wave2}\\ ] ] where @xmath68 is a quenched random sign associated to each configuration @xmath4 .",
    "the average ratio between the number of positive and negative signs is one .",

    "in this paper , we will study the mbl phase transition in a rk - wave function with random sign .",
    "in this section we will show that the rk wave function with random signs has an ergodic ( thermalized ) regime and an mbl phase .",

    "this phase transition can be further studied by computing the inverse participation ratio ( ipr ) , @xcite @xmath92 this quantity measures how many configurations effectively contribute to the partition function and measurable quantities . the expectation value for @xmath93 equals to @xcite @xmath94 at low temperatures , @xmath95 ,",
    "the participation ratio takes a finite value .",
    "this means that the system is completely frozen to @xmath96 number of configurations and is in a non - ergodic phase . at high temperature , @xmath97",
    ", all configurations will contribute to the thermodynamic properties of the system .",
    "for instance , in the high temperature limit @xmath98 , the boltzmann s measure becomes uniform and the second participation ratio becomes @xmath99 .",

    "we will use @xmath103 to give a upper bound for the rnyi entropy of the wave function @xmath15 later .",
