    "monotonicity is one of the simplest property a signal may have .",
    "it offers a powerful qualitative description ( `` it goes up , '' `` it goes down '' ) . given data coming in from either sensors or from a numerical simulation ,",
    "monotonicity is independent of the sampling frequency and is robust with respect to missing data  @xcite .",
    "many geometrical objects such as curves are typically defined in a parametrization - independent way which makes monotonicity appealing .    in this paper",
    ", we are concerned with discretely sampled curves ( which we call chains ) such as the trajectory of a particle in some vector space .",
    "this problem has applications in motion capture and tracking  @xcite .",
    "we expect a `` smooth '' scalar - valued signal not to change too quickly : it should be locally constant .",
    "therefore , classical low pass filters such as the moving average ( ma ) are often sufficient to help smooth signals . unfortunately ,",
    "`` smooth '' chains are not locally constant : consider a loosely sampled circle ( see fig .  [ filteredcircle ] ) . moreover",
    ", a chain may lie on a sphere or other higher dimensional surface and we may need to preserve this embedding . in fig .",
    "[ filteredcircle ] , a chain on a circle is filtered using a moving average : we see that the filtered chain can , at best , follow a circle of a smaller radius . a filter is sphere - preserving ( resp .",
    "circle - preserving ) if , when the input data points are on a sphere ( resp . circle ) , the filtered data points also lie on the same sphere ( resp . circle ) .",
    "it is readily shown that no linear filter except the identity can be sphere - preserving ( sp ) or circle - preserving ( cp ) . in general ,",
    "an sp filter is cp .",
    "we offer a simple sp filter in section  5 .",
    "one of the main contribution of this paper is to provide a generalization of the concept of monotonicity which applies to vector - valued signals and to curves .",
    "this definition is shown to be robust with respect to removal of data points and to be efficiently computed . over curves , we show that monotone curves have many of the same properties as monotone functions as far as continuity and differentiability are concerned .",
    "we also propose a sp filter which we show to never decrease the degree of monotonicity .",
    "experimentally , we show that the degree of monotonicity is inversely correlated with noise and we compare the sp filter with simple ma filters , proving the nonlinear sp filter is a good choice when noise levels are low . applications of this work include chain reconstruction from unordered data points  @xcite and optical character recognition  @xcite .",
    "a motion signal is comprised of two components : orientation and translation . the orientation vector indicates where the object is facing , whereas the translation component determines the object s location .",
    "recent work has focused on smoothing the orientation vectors  @xcite , whereas the results of the present paper apply equally well to orientation vectors ( points on the surface of a unit sphere ) as to arbitrary translation signals .    in  @xcite , the authors chose to define monotonicity for curves or chains with an arbitrary direction vector : a curve is monotone if its projection on a line is does not backtrack .",
    "while this is a sensible choice given the lack of definition elsewhere , we argue that not all applications support an arbitrary direction that can be used to define monotonicity .    the definition of monotonicity has been extended to real - valued functions  @xcite ( @xmath0 ) by using contour lines ( or surfaces ) but the idea does not immediately generalize to curves and chains .",
    "one approach to chain smoothing is to use b - splines and bezier curves with the @xmath1 norm  @xcite .",
    "correspondingly , we could measure the `` smoothness '' of a chain by measuring how closely one can fit it to a smooth curve .",
    "our approach differs in that we do not use polygonal approximations or curve fitting : we consider chains to be first - class citizens .",
    "recall that a function @xmath2 is said to be monotone increasing if @xmath3 whenever @xmath4 and monotone decreasing if @xmath5 whenever @xmath4 .",
    "a monotone increasing or monotone decreasing function is said to be monotone . recall that @xmath6 is called a ( closed ) ball of radius @xmath7 centered around @xmath8 : in the multidimensional case , the ball is a generalization of the ( closed ) interval .",
    "@xmath2 is monotone if and only if @xmath9 is connected for all balls @xmath10 .",
    "an arc - length parametrized curve @xmath11 is @xmath7-monotone for @xmath12 if the inverse image of any closed ball of radius at most @xmath7 , under @xmath13 , is connected .",
    "straight lines are @xmath7-monotone for all @xmath12 . as motivation the discrete case ,",
    "we want to compare monotone curves with monotone functions .",
    "monotone functions @xmath14 are differentiable almost everywhere , and they do not have to be continuous .",
    "@xmath7-monotone also do not have to be continuous : the curve @xmath15 where @xmath16 a.e .",
    "is @xmath7-monotone for all @xmath12 . moreover , they are also differentiable a.e . as the next proposition shows .",
    "continuous @xmath7-monotone curves are differentiable a.e .",
    "take any point @xmath17 in the ( open ) domain of the curve @xmath13 .",
    "choose another point @xmath18 so that the arc - length @xmath19 over @xmath13 is smaller than @xmath7 .",
    "consider any point @xmath20 on @xmath13 between @xmath18 and @xmath17 , then @xmath20 must be contained in all balls of radius @xmath7 containing both @xmath17 and @xmath18 .",
    "it follows that @xmath13 must be differentiable from the left at @xmath17 .",
    "similarly , @xmath13 is differentiable from the right at @xmath17 .",
    "if the two derivative from the left and from the right do not match , then it is possible to find @xmath18 and @xmath21 close to @xmath17 from the left and the right such that there is a ball of radius @xmath7 containing both @xmath18 and @xmath21 but not @xmath17 , a contradiction .    just like monotone functions , continuous @xmath7-monotone curves",
    "do not have to be twice differentiable , consider the arc - length parametrized version of @xmath22 for @xmath23 .",
    "differentiable functions are not necessarily monotone .",
    "likewise differentiable curves are not necessarily @xmath7-monotone as the next proposition shows .",
    "there is a differentiable continuous finite curves with no cross - over ( that is , @xmath24 is one - to - one ) which is not @xmath7-monotone for any @xmath12 .    consider a curve following a inward spiral around a fixed point such as @xmath25 for @xmath26 $ ] .",
    "functions are monotone or not , and there is no `` degree of monotonicity . ''",
    "similarly , for curves of finite length , it simply matters whether they are @xmath7-monotone for some finite @xmath7 since @xmath7-monotonicity is scale - dependent .",
    "given a @xmath7-monotone curve , scaling the curve by a factor @xmath27 makes it @xmath28-monotone .",
    "in this section , we define monotonicity for vector - valued signals or chains as a natural extension of monotonicity for real - valued signals .",
    "we show how to compute efficiently the degree of monotonicity .",
    "a scalar - valued signal ( or discrete function ) is monotone if and only if the index set of values in any closed interval @xmath29 $ ] is a set of consecutive integers @xmath30 $ ] : @xmath31 \\leftrightarrow i\\in [ j , k]$ ] .",
    "equivalently , the values of the signal @xmath32 never go down ( @xmath33 ) or never go up ( @xmath34 ) .",
    "another equivalent definition is given by the next proposition .",
    "a scalar - valued signal @xmath32 is monotone if and only if , for any 3 consecutive samples , @xmath35 , the index set of the values contained in any closed interval @xmath29 $ ] is a set of consecutive integers @xmath30 $ ] .",
    "equivalently , the index set is a convex set under an appropriate definition of convexity .",
    "it is easy to extend this definition of monotonicity to the case of vector - valued signals .",
    "unfortunately , a straightforward generalization , based on considering the set of indices of the values contained in any closed ball , would lead us to conclude that the only monotone vector - valued signals are on straight lines and never backtrack .",
    "it is not hard to realize no sensible filter could turn any vector - valued signal into a monotone signal . in order to obtain nontrivial results , we need to restrict the class of balls considered , as in the following definition .    a vector - valued signal @xmath36 has a degree of monotonicity @xmath7 if @xmath7 is the largest value such that , considering only 3 consecutive samples , @xmath37 , the index set of the values contained in any closed ball @xmath10 of radius at most @xmath7 is a set of consecutive integers in @xmath38 .",
    "if the signal values are on a straight line with no backtracking , then the degree of monotonicity is @xmath39 , and the degree of monotonicity is always larger than @xmath40 for finite signals .",
    "[ monotonicityfailure ] gives an intuitive view of the degree of monotonicity .",
    "this measure of monotonicity is robust in the following sense .",
    "if one point is omitted from a vector - valued signal , the degree of monotonicity can not decrease .    while this discrete definition is similar to the definition given for @xmath7-monotone curves , to allow efficient computation",
    ", we consider only sets of 3 consecutive samples , thus replacing a global problem by a local problem .",
    "if we lift the requirement that only 3  samples are considered , then a signal is @xmath7-monotone if and only if all subchains of length @xmath41 are @xmath7-monotone .",
    "this suggests that the cost of checking global @xmath7-monotonicity grows in a cubic fashion with respect to the length of the signal which is unacceptable for most applications . in practical applications , maximizing the degree of monotonicity @xmath7 leads to useful chains .",
    "for example , noise tends to reduce @xmath7 by creating sharp turns and local backtracking and a highly monotone curve ( @xmath7 large ) is more likely to be noise - free . on the other hand ,",
    "when reconstructing chains from unordered sets of points , as happens in computer vision , we often want to minimize sharp turns and backtracking .",
    "therefore , solving for the chain maximizing @xmath7 while passing through all available data points is a sensible `` curve reconstruction '' strategy .    as a prerequisite to computing the degree of monotonicity",
    ", we need a computationally effective way to compute the radius of the circle going through 3 points .",
    "given @xmath42 , we can compute the radius of the circle passing through them ( denoted @xmath43 ) by first computing @xmath44 , @xmath45 , @xmath46 , @xmath47 , and then we have the classical heron s formula for the radius of the circle : @xmath48 whenever @xmath49 .",
    "the next theorem gives us a way to compute the ( local ) degree of monotonicity for any 3 points , to compute the degree of monotonicity of an entire signal simply requires , by definition , to take the * minimum * of the result for all consecutive 3 points .",
    "the theorem essentially says that if @xmath50 , the degree of monotonicity is then half the distance between @xmath51 and @xmath52 , and otherwise , it is @xmath53 ( see fig .  [ computingr ] ) . to see that this local form of monotonicity is distinct from the global form suggested earlier , consider a chain in the form of a figure `` * * 8**. ''    [ formulathm ]",
    "the degree of monotonicity for the sequence @xmath54 is @xmath55 [ prop : formula ] where @xmath44 , @xmath45 , @xmath46 .",
    "consider the disk @xmath56 containing @xmath51 and @xmath52 , centered at @xmath57 and having radius @xmath58 .",
    "the point @xmath59 is outside the disk if and only if @xmath60 is positive .",
    "thus , @xmath59 is outside the disk if and only if @xmath61 . clearly @xmath62 .",
    "next , suppose that @xmath59 is in the disk @xmath56 .",
    "we have that any ball containing @xmath51 and @xmath52 but not @xmath59 must be larger than @xmath63 since @xmath56 is the smallest ball containing both @xmath51 and @xmath52 . now",
    ", suppose there is a ( closed ) ball of minimal radius @xmath7 containing @xmath51 and @xmath52 , but not @xmath59 .",
    "this implies a non - zero distance , @xmath64 , between @xmath10 and @xmath59 .",
    "we have that the center of the ball has to be away from the line formed by @xmath65 : if not then it must be a ball containing @xmath56 .",
    "this means we can move the center of the ball slightly closer to @xmath51 and @xmath52 while reducing the radius just enough so that @xmath59 remains outside the ball . by repeating this process , we show that @xmath66 , a contradiction . hence , there is no ( closed ) ball of minimal radius @xmath7 containing @xmath51 and @xmath52 , but not @xmath59 . hence @xmath54 have a degree of monotonicity @xmath67 .",
    "in this section , we propose a sp filter which never decreases the degree of monotonicity of the signal . given a signal @xmath36",
    ", we consider recursive ( iir ) filters of the form @xmath68 to ease the notation , we write @xmath69 , @xmath70 , @xmath71 , @xmath72 , @xmath73 so that the equation becomes @xmath74 let @xmath75 be the degree of monotonicity of @xmath76 computed as @xmath77 the following proposition gives us a condition of @xmath78 to increase the monotonicity of a vector - valued signal .    given @xmath79 , if @xmath78 is such that the degree of monotonicity @xmath80 then the recursive filter @xmath81 never decreases the degree of monotonicity of a signal .",
    "it seems that @xmath78 should be chosen so that @xmath82 is as large as possible .",
    "to maximizes @xmath82 with @xmath79 , @xmath78 should be either @xmath10 or @xmath83 .",
    "in other words , we improve monotonicity best when we make the sample @xmath84 `` virtually disappear . ''",
    "@xmath82 is minimized when @xmath85 or @xmath86 and these choices are unique unless @xmath87 in which case any point on the arc of the circle between @xmath10 and @xmath83 inclusively qualifies .",
    "fortunately , we can easily define a more interesting sp filter .",
    "given an arc of a circle , denoted @xmath88 , and a point @xmath84 , we can project @xmath84 on @xmath88 by solving for the point closest @xmath84 in @xmath88 .",
    "the projection onto a circle can be determined easily using only linear algebra  @xcite . in the plane ,",
    "start with equation @xmath89 and substitute 3 values of @xmath90 , getting 3  equations . by pairwise subtraction",
    ", we can remove the unknown @xmath91 , and be left with linear system having 2  equations and 2  unknowns ( the center of the circle ) .",
    "we apply this by first projecting on the circle and if the projected point does not belong to the given arc we move it to the closest point on the arc ( an endpoint of the arc ) .",
    "let us define @xmath92 to be the projection of @xmath84 on the arc @xmath93 of the circle @xmath94 , and define @xmath95 to be the projection of @xmath84 on the arc @xmath93 of the circle @xmath96 .",
    "intuitively , either point @xmath92 or @xmath95 would make a good choice for @xmath97 . to ensure that the degree of monotonicity is never decreased , we set @xmath98 this function can be computed quickly and is sphere - preserving .",
    "we generate a chain in the @xmath99 plane by regularly sampling a unit circle 3 times for a total of 30  samples . a ma filter with window width @xmath100 averages each @xmath100",
    "consecutive data points .",
    "we add white noise to every point in the chain and we filter it using simple ma filters with window widths of 3 and 5 samples as well as with the sp filter of the previous section .",

    "[ monversusnoiseversuswidth ] shows the degree of monotonicity versus the noise level ( mean square error ) with the three smoothing filters and the unfiltered chain .",
    "the noise level ranges from none to over 0.05 ( mse ) which corresponds roughly to a 5% noise - to - signal ratio .",
    "an example of filtering is given in fig .",
