    "a__+_a _ reactions contained a significant portion of @xmath0 mesons produced at the early stage of the process in hard nucleon - nucleon collisions , then the final @xmath0 spectra could exhibit two components , as , for example , in the model @xcite : direct @xmath0 and secondary thermal @xmath0 produced at the stage of recombination of charm quarks .",
    "the shape of @xmath0 momentum spectra will then be , in fact , nonthermal .",

    "[ fig2 ] , where one can see that the blast - wave model with @xmath42 ( implying @xmath43 ) yields a good description of the low - momentum part of the @xmath0 spectrum .",
    "these findings , at first sight , might imply a contradiction with the blast - wave model fits to @xmath1 and @xmath2 transverse momentum spectra where the same temperature but another surface velocity was obtained .",
    "consequently , the question arises : can @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 transverse momentum spectra be coherently described within a hydroinspired parametrization of freeze - out with reasonable parameters ?",
    "to understand why a blast - wave model , eq .",
    "( [ 01 ] ) , description with parameters fitted to @xmath1 and @xmath2 transverse momentum spectra does not reproduce the @xmath0 spectra properly , let us look carefully over the main assumptions used in the comparison to spectra by employing eq .",
    "( [ 01 ] ) .",
    "they are the following : the freeze - out isotherm is @xmath44 and the transverse rapidity profile at the isotherm is linear .",
    "further assumptions are on - mass shell distribution functions , absence of flow fluctuations , a homogeneous particle number density , @xmath45 , at freeze - out , and absence of resonance feed - down . here",
    "we briefly discuss these assumptions to clarify whether giving up debatable ones can result in consistent description of @xmath1 , @xmath2 , and @xmath0 transverse momentum spectra if kinetic freeze - out takes place just after chemical freeze - out for these particles .",
    "first note that a hypersurface of constant proper bjorken time , @xmath14 in general does not correspond to any isotherm , and a linear transverse rapidity profile is questionable .",
    "however , based on estimates of corresponding quantities in viable scenarios of hydrodynamic evolution and results of correspondingly modified blast - wave model calculations ( see , e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite for blast - wave model calculations with different velocity profiles ) , one can conclude that the spectra discussed are little affected by the shape of the flow velocity profile and by deviations of the chemical freeze - out isotherm from the @xmath44 hypersurface .",
    "we hence keep these assumptions unchanged .",
    "actually , the corresponding hypersurface and velocity profile depend on the whole dynamical history of the hydrodynamically expanding system - initial conditions , equation of state , etc . - and can be calculated in a true dynamical model only",
    ". it will be the subject of follow - up work .",
    "another assumption , namely , the on - mass shell approximation of the distribution function , may be questioned for finite - width particles such as @xmath0 , although the free width of the @xmath0 is less than 100 kev .",
    "the main reason for the higher effective temperature of @xmath0 spectra in the low - momentum region ( see fig . [ fig2 ] ) compared with the effective temperatures of @xmath1 and @xmath2 spectra in the same region ( see fig .",
    "[ figg1 ] ) is the larger mass of the @xmath0 particle .",
    "an explanation of this fact can be based on the simple approximation of the integrand in eq .",
    "( [ 1 ] ) .",
    "then one may surmise that an appropriate off - mass - shell hydroinspired parametrization of @xmath0 spectra that includes low invariant mass contributions could improve the description of the low - momentum part of the spectra .",
    "most naturally , such a parametrization - namely , a breit - wigner formula for the spectral function instead of the @xmath46 function approximation - appears because of the finite width of @xmath0 meson .",
    "however , the corresponding calculations of the @xmath0 spectra with the same hydrodynamical parameters of the blast - wave model as for @xmath2 and @xmath1 particles do not result in a significant improvement in the description of @xmath0 spectra if experimental conditions are properly taken into account .",
    "namely , as reported by the phenix collaboration @xcite , the @xmath0 spectra at midrapidity are measured by counting lepton pairs in the invariant mass range @xmath47 gev @xmath48@xmath49 gev , and such a narrow invariant mass window accompanied by the rather low decay width , @xmath50 gev , does not result in noticeable deviation from on - mass shell calculations .    the next assumption , namely , a neglect of flow fluctuations in the blast - wave model , eq .",
    "( [ 01 ] ) , is also debatable .",
    "owing to the finite size of the systems , large fluctuations are expected in the initial stage of the nuclear collisions , even for a fixed impact parameter , and various event generators do show such effects . while a very early thermalization in relativistic heavy - ion collisions is doubtful now @xcite ( for review see also ref . @xcite and references therein )",
    ", the initial inhomogeneities can result in fluctuating initial conditions for the subsequent hydrodynamical expansion . because the hydrodynamical equations are nonlinear , the event average of any hydrodynamical parameter ( in other words , average over solutions of hydrodynamical equations ) is quite different from that for a smooth initial configuration and results in large differences in spectra from hydrodynamical calculations with averaged initial conditions .",
    "this fact was pointed out and explicitly demonstrated in event - by - event hydrodynamic simulations based on smoothed particle hydrodynamics code ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for review and ref .",
    "@xcite for recent results ) .",
    "fluctuations of transverse flows in noncental collisions also are considered in ref .",
    "@xcite .    therefore , the collective flow fluctuations are rather natural and can have some effect on the particle momentum spectra . to study it ,",
    "let us consider a blast - wave model with bulk matter flow fluctuations .",
    "the transverse spectra of the blast - wave model averaged over ensemble of the fluctuations are assumed to have the form : @xmath51 we consider here two simple and , in some sense , opposite cases of the distribution of @xmath41 .",
    "first , we assume a distribution that is flat in @xmath41 , that is , @xmath52 , with the lower and upper limits @xmath53 and @xmath54 considered to be free fit parameters .",
    "second , we assume a gaussian form for the distribution of hydrodynamical velocities . with @xmath55 ,",
    "we obtain : @xmath56 , with @xmath57 ( @xmath58 ) and @xmath59 ( @xmath60 ) .",
    "note that , for such a distribution , there is no explicit cutoff of high @xmath41 contributions ; the convergence of the integral takes place because the main contribution at high @xmath41 happens at small @xmath61 , leading to a cutoff factor @xmath62 .",
    "the results for @xmath52 with @xmath63 ( @xmath64 ) and @xmath65 ( @xmath66 ) , and for @xmath67 with @xmath68 ( @xmath69 ) and @xmath70 are displayed in figs .",
    "[ fig3 ] and [ fig4 ] for @xmath2 , @xmath1 , and @xmath0 transverse momentum spectra , respectively .",
    "one can see from these figures that the blast - wave model supplemented with appropriate fluctuations of the hydrodynamical flow yields a significantly improved description of the shapes of transverse momentum distributions for @xmath1 , @xmath2 , and @xmath0 particles .",
    "the same as fig .",
    "[ figg1 ] , but with the blast - wave model fit accounting for flow fluctuations , eq .",
    "( [ 3 ] ) .",
    "the corresponding results are indicated by solid lines ( flat distribution in hydrodynamical velocities ) and dashed lines ( gaussian distribution in hydrodynamical velocities ) . ]     the same as fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] but with the blast - wave model fit accounting for flow fluctuations , eq .",
    "( [ 3 ] ) .",
    "the corresponding results are indicated by solid lines ( flat distribution in hydrodynamical velocities ) and dashed lines ( gaussian distribution in hydrodynamical velocities ) . ]",
    "another assumption used in eq .",
    "( [ 01 ] ) , namely , that of homogeneous particle number density across the system at the isotherm hypersurface , is rather natural for bulk - matter particles consisting of quarks that are produced in qgp , as well as in the initial collisions , but can be questioned for heavy rare particles like @xmath0 .",
    "the reasons are the following .",
    "because the charm quarks are produced in primary binary nucleon - nucleon collisions only and there is no charm quark production during the evolution of the system , the initial distribution of charm quarks follows the distribution of initial binary collisions . then the charm quark density can be more strongly peaked in the center of the system than the density of light - flavor and strange quarks that initially follow the participant density distribution .- meson spectra . ]",
    "hence the effective transverse size of a volume occupied by @xmath0 mesons at the hadronization hypersurface can be less than that for bulk - matter particles .    for simplicity , we consider the particle number density of @xmath0 in two extreme scenarios : first , the @xmath0 mesons are assumed to follow the density distribution of bulk - matter particles , as in fact considered in the previous section , and second , we assume that the spatial extension of @xmath0 in the transverse direction coincides with the initial spatial distribution of charm quarks determined by the geometry of binary nucleon - nucleon collisions .",
    "the latter is examined here .",
    "the initial spatial distribution of charm quarks in the transverse direction as determined by the transverse distribution of binary nucleon - nucleon collisions in _ _ au__+_au _ collisions , and at impact parameter @xmath71 , which we assume here for simplicity , is @xmath72 where the nuclear thickness distribution @xmath73 is obtained from a woods - saxon distribution , @xmath74 the woods - saxon distribution of nucleons in the _ au _ nucleus is defined by the formula @xmath75^{-1}\\label{d3}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath76 fm , @xmath77 fm @xcite , and @xmath78 given by the normalization condition .",
    "the transverse momentum spectrum of the blast - wave model of @xmath0 distributed according to this initial spatial distribution of charm quarks is @xmath79 then , before calculating the transverse momentum spectra of @xmath0 by means of eq .",
    "( [ d4 ] ) , one needs to define the transverse size of the bulk - matter distribution @xmath16 .",
    "we estimate this value to be between @xmath80 and @xmath81 fm , and fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] presents the @xmath0 spectrum calculated with the hydroinspired parametrization , eq .",
    "( [ d4 ] ) , for both @xmath16 values .",
    "a good description of the spectrum at low @xmath40 spectra is obtained , this is not surprising because , as noted at the end of the previous section , to fit the low-@xmath40 part of the @xmath0 spectrum one needs to utilize , for @xmath0 mesons , a lower value of the maximum transverse velocity than for bulk - matter particles at the same isotherm .     the same as fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , but with the blast - wave model fit accounting for inhomogeneity of the @xmath0 distribution , eq .",
    "( [ d4 ] ) , with @xmath82 fm ( solid lines ) and @xmath83 fm ( dashed lines ) . ]    the last assumption of the blast - wave model , eq .",
    "( [ 01 ] ) , discussed here is the neglect of the resonance feed - down .",
    "while the measured inclusive particle spectra in general contain contributions from resonance decays , for the spectra discussed in this article the resonance feed - down is rather small and one can expect that generalization of the blast - wave model to include the resonance feed - down does not seriously influence the fitted parameters . in any case , feed - down contributions to @xmath0 spectra will , except for lhc energies where feed - down from _",
    "b_-meson decay is likely significant , coming from excited charmonia .",
    "although this contribution can be up to 40 % @xcite , we expect little modification of the spectral shapes , as the charmonia masses are all very large compared to masses of hadrons made of light and strange quarks . a comprehensive treatment of resonance feed - down within a dynamical hydrokinetic model of the evolution of the fireball and of particle production will be provided in a forthcoming work .",
    "we have analyzed central @xmath0 , @xmath1 , and @xmath2 transverse momentum spectra at midrapidity within a blast - wave model and demonstrated that , while the high-@xmath40 part of the spectrum of @xmath0 is well described by fit parameters obtained for a description of @xmath1 and @xmath2 spectra , the low-@xmath8 experimental transverse momentum spectrum of @xmath0 exhibits an effective temperature lower than that calculated with the fit parameters for @xmath1 and @xmath2 spectra . in our opinion ,",
    "the reason for this is grounded in some specific assumptions of the blast - wave model rather than in significant nonthermal contributions to @xmath0 spectra . to demonstrate this",
    "we have developed and presented a generalized blast - wave model .",
    "first , we have demonstrated that a blast - wave model modified to account for collective flow fluctuations results in good agreement with data over a wide @xmath40 region for @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 transverse momentum spectra .",
    "however , good agreement with @xmath0 data is reached only if rather high flow fluctuations take place near the chemical freeze - out isotherm .",
    "note that in a very recent paper @xcite it is estimated that much lower flow fluctuations , following from the fluctuations of the transverse size of the initial source , are consistent with recently observed @xcite event - by - event fluctuations of the average transverse momentum of bulk - matter particles in _",
    "_ au__+_au _ collisions at rhic energies .",
    "gev @xcite was found to be in agreement with predictions based on spatial fluctuations of the participating nucleons in the initial nuclear overlap region . ]",
    "if this result is confirmed , it rules out the interpretation that the low-@xmath40 peculiarities of @xmath0 transverse momentum spectra are a result of hydrodynamic flow fluctuations .",
    "another generalization of the blast - wave model considered in this article is based on the fact that , because charm quarks initially follow the density distribution of primary binary nucleon - nucleon collisions , the shape of @xmath0 density at freeze - out differs from the particle density of uniform bulk matter because of a higher concentration of charm quarks in the center of the system at the hadronization hypersurface .",
    "the spectrum of @xmath0 , calculated with the density distribution of primary binary collisions and with a conservative estimate of the transverse size of the volume occupied by the bulk matter , demonstrates a fairly good agreement with @xmath84 @xmath0 transverse momentum data until @xmath85 gev , and the curve calculated is below the data points for higher @xmath8 .",
    "note that high-@xmath40 @xmath0 can be emitted mostly by corona and can be , in fact , the result of charmonium production in nucleon - nucleon collisions ( see ref .",
    "because the fraction of participating nucleons contained in the corona region increases when the centrality decreases , in noncentral collisions one can expect a higher effective temperature of the @xmath0 spectra than in central collisions ; indeed fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] shows this effect .- meson spectra measured by the star collaboration in the @xmath86 centrality bin @xcite can be described by the relatively high radial flow velocity at the surface , @xmath87 , and the freeze - out temperature , @xmath88 mev ( see ref .",
    "@xcite ) . ]    finally , we conclude that the present data at the top rhic energy are compatible with the picture in which @xmath0 , @xmath1 , and @xmath2 momentum distributions are frozen simultaneously with chemical composition at @xmath9 mev .",
