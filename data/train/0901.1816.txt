    "since the discovery of a large magneto - electric effect in rmn@xmath4o@xmath5  @xcite and rmn@xmath4o@xmath6  @xcite ( r = rare earth ) , there is a revival of interest in the study of multiferroic materials where the coupling between the electric polarization and the magnetic order is strong .",
    "although coexistence of ferroelectricity and magnetic long - range order is not very common , quite a number of new multiferroics materials have been found recently , like ni@xmath5v@xmath4o@xmath7 ,  @xcite mnwo@xmath8 ,  @xcite or licuvo@xmath8 ,  @xcite to cite only a few .",
    "multiferroics that have coupled ferroelectric and magnetic order parameters are also promising materials for applications , as it is possible to control the ferroelectric polarization by a magnetic field and vice - versa .",
    "@xcite therefore , there is an extensive search for materials that show pronounced magneto - electric effect at ambient conditions .",
    "b - site disordered complex perovskites pbb@xmath9b@xmath10o@xmath5 might be attractive candidates as they can adopt various ions which strongly influences the temperature of magnetic and ferroelectric ordering .    lead iron niobate , pb(fe@xmath0nb@xmath0)o@xmath1(pfn ) , is one of the well known complex perovskites that exhibits multiferroic properties .",
    "@xcite pfnis rhombohedral at room temperature and cubic above the ferroelectric curie temperature of 383  k.  @xcite pb(fe@xmath0nb@xmath0)o@xmath1undergoes a diffuse phase transition without pronounced frequency dispersion .",
    "@xcite in the cubic phase , the symmetry of the chemical cell is @xmath11 .",
    "there is a cubic - tetragonal phase transition at @xmath12  k followed by a first - order transition at 354  k. the symmetry of the chemical structure of the low - temperature phase of pfnwas the subject of some debate .",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite reported that the structure is monoclinic with space group @xmath13 , whereas ivanov _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite using powder neutron diffraction data found that the chemical structure of pb(fe@xmath0nb@xmath0)o@xmath1has @xmath14 symmetry at @xmath15  k.    the magnetic properties of pfnare also not completely understood .",
    "pfnundergoes a paramagnetic to antiferromagnetic phase transition at @xmath16 140 - 160  k.  @xcite the magnetic structure was determined by single crystal neutron diffraction and corresponds to a simple @xmath17-type antiferromagnetic arrangement of the magnetic moments at all temperature below @xmath18 .",
    "@xcite magneto - electric effect in pfnat low temperatures has been demonstrated long ago  @xcite and , recently , it was shown that the dc magnetic susceptibility has an anomaly at the paraelectric - ferroelectric phase transition .",
    "@xcite the dielectric permeability also shows an anomaly at the nel temperature  @xcite , which suggests that a biquadratic term in the landau free energy of the form @xmath19 is responsible for the coupling between the ferroelectric polarization @xmath20 and the ( staggered ) magnetization @xmath21 .",
    "additional magnetic anomalies were reported in the literature for pb(fe@xmath0nb@xmath0)o@xmath1below the magnetic phase transition . both nmr  @xcite and susceptibility measurements  @xcite have shown that an additional magnetic phase transition occurs in pfn around @xmath2220  k that was interpreted as the formation of a spin - glass phase by kumar et al .",
    "@xcite    here we report on muon - spin rotation and neutron scattering results of the magnetic properties of pfn below the nel temperature .",
    "we show that the magnetic ground - state of pb(fe@xmath0nb@xmath0)o@xmath1is a spin - glass - like state that coexists with long - range antiferromagnetic order below @xmath23  k.",
    "the pb(fe@xmath0nb@xmath0)o@xmath1single crystals used in the muon spin rotation and neutron scattering experiments were grown by spontaneous crystallization from the melt following the routine described in ref .  .",
    "the muon spin relaxation measurements were performed using the gps instrument at the paul scherrer institut ( villigen , switzerland ) on a pb(fe@xmath0nb@xmath0)o@xmath1single crystal between 160  k and 5  k. the data were recorded using the zero - field method that allows to determine both the static and dynamics in disordered spins systems .",
    "the neutron scattering experiments were performed with the cold neutron three - axis spectrometer tasp  @xcite at sinq operated in diffraction mode at @xmath24=1.97  @xmath25 . for this experiment",
    "a single crystal of pb(fe@xmath0nb@xmath0)o@xmath1 was oriented with the [ 1,1,0 ] and [ 0,0,1 ] crystallographic directions in the scattering plane . in that scattering geometry ,",
    "magnetic bragg peaks with indexes @xmath26 in the rhombohedral setting can be accessed .",
    "the use of a three - axis spectrometer was justified by the need to improve the ratio intensity / background in order to search for possible short - range order at low temperatures .",
    "in a @xmath27experiment , the time evolution of the muon spin polarization is monitored by recording the asymmetric emission of positrons produced by the weak decay of the muon ( muon lifetime @xmath28s ) .",
    "the time histogram of the collected positrons is given by @xmath29 + b\\ ] ] where @xmath30 is the initial muon asymmetry parameter , @xmath31 is a normalization constant , and @xmath32 is a time - independent background .",
    "the function @xmath33 reflects the normalized muon - spin auto - correlation function @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the spin of the muon .",
    "hence @xmath36 , often called the @xmath2sr signal , reflects the time evolution of the muon polarization .",
    "figure  [ fig1 ] shows the @xmath2sr signal in pb(fe@xmath0nb@xmath0)o@xmath1 upon passing the nel temperature . in the paramagnetic phase the signal is consistent with a weak depolarization of the muon signal solely due to nuclear dipole moments . below the nel temperature , the muon signal changes rapidly and the initial asymmetry @xmath30",
    "is strongly reduced .",
    "this indicates that there is a large distribution of internal fields seen by the @xmath37 , which is a consequence of the random distribution of the fe and nb ions in the chemical lattice .",
    "therefore , the @xmath27 signal is depolarised and the residual asymmetry is close to 1/3 of the value observed in the paramagnetic state . hence , in the long - range antiferromagnetic phase",
    ", the muon signal reflects only muons having their initial polarization along the direction of the internal field at the stopping site .",
    "below @xmath18 , the time evolution of the remaining @xmath2sr signal is best fitted assuming the function @xmath38 . \\label{eq3}\\ ] ] close to @xmath18 , the power exponent is @xmath39 , reflecting the presence of fluctuating internal magnetic fields with a unique correlation time @xmath40 . in this range of temperatures ,",
    "the depolarization rate @xmath41 is proportional to the second moment of the magnetic field distribution @xmath42 and to the correlation time @xmath40 of the internal field and is given by @xmath43 where @xmath44 is the muon gyromagnetic ratio .",
    "the temperature dependence of the depolarization rate @xmath41 is shown in fig .",
    "it can be observed that there is a critical - like divergence close to @xmath45  k. this is is a clear evidence that pb(fe@xmath0nb@xmath0)o@xmath1undergoes a second magnetic phase transition at the temperature @xmath46 .",
    "figure  [ fig3 ] depicts the temperature evolution of the @xmath47 exponent .",
    "as already mentioned , at temperatures just below @xmath18 , the muon depolarization is described by an exponential function instead of a stretched exponential , i.e. , with the parameter @xmath481 . upon further cooling below @xmath18 , @xmath47 continuously decreases and approaches the value of 1/3 at @xmath49  k. a decrease of the exponent @xmath47 toward the value of 1/3 has been predicted theoretically and later observed for the dense spin - glass systems agmn and aufe alloys .  @xcite it is tempting to attribute this change of @xmath47 to the change in the distribution of the correlation times @xmath40 of the internal magnetic fields at the muon stopping sites as a spin - glass transition is approached from above .",
    "however , for an usual paramagnetic to spin - glass transition , one observes that the residual fluctuations lead to a constant value of @xmath47 below @xmath46 while @xmath41 decreases , reflecting the decrease of the magnitude of the fluctuating field , as the temperature is lowered deeper into the spin - glass phase",
    ". however , fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] also shows that @xmath47 grows as the temperature is lowered below @xmath46 to recover the value @xmath50 at @xmath51  k. the solution of this apparent paradox is that the slow spin fluctuations , arising from the spin - glass state and which persist in a relatively broad temperature range below @xmath46 , occur on top of antiferromagnetic fluctuations due to the long - range order .",
    "it is then natural to expect that the strong reduction of the critical spin - glass fluctuations in time when the temperature is decreased below @xmath46 leads to the recovery of the weak non - critical antiferromagnetic fluctuations probed by the @xmath27 signal above @xmath46 .",
    "we note that as the static component of the @xmath2sr signal is already lost above @xmath46 , no indication of a change ( i.e. , increase ) of the damping of this component ( as evidenced for example in other reentrant spin - glasses  @xcite ) could be determined at the spin - glass transition by @xmath2sr .",
    "figure  [ fig4 ] shows a typical neutron elastic scan along the @xmath52 direction at @xmath53  k in pb(fe@xmath0nb@xmath0)o@xmath1 .",
    "the spectrum consists of a sharp bragg peak centered around @xmath54 that corresponds to the antiferromagnetic long - range order detected by neutron diffraction previously  @xcite .",
    "a diffuse component is also present in the neutron spectrum that is weaker in intensity and has a width in @xmath55 that is much broader than the experimental resolution .",
    "the magnetic origin of the diffuse component was confirmed using the neutron polarization analysis device mupad  @xcite that allows a complete separation of magnetic and nuclear scattering .",
    "namely , using a neutron polarized beam for which the polarization is aligned along the scattering vector , magnetic scattering reverses the neutron polarization vector , whereas scattering of nuclear origin leaves the polarization of the neutron beam unchanged .",
    "magnetic scattering therefore appears in the spin - flip channel , as shown to be the case for the diffuse component in the inset of fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] .",
    "we investigated the distribution of the diffuse scattering around the @xmath56 antiferromagnetic bragg peak and found that it is essentially isotropically distributed in the ( 1,1,0)/(0,0,1 ) scattering plane accessible in the present measurements ( see fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] ) .",
    "we performed an energy scan through the diffuse component and found that it is resolution - limited within the energy window ( @xmath57=0.3  mev ) of the spectrometer .",
    "therefore , the spin fluctuations associated with the diffuse scattering are static in the the time - window of our experiment .    within the quasi - static approximation ,",
    "the energy - integrated neutron cross section is proportional to the generalized static susceptibility @xmath58  @xcite @xmath59 the term @xmath60 accounts for the fact that only fluctuations perpendicular to the scattering vector @xmath61 contribute to the diffuse intensity .",
    "the index @xmath62 labels the spins at position @xmath63 and @xmath64 is the magnetic form factor .",
    "we modeled the diffuse scattering measured along @xmath52 around the @xmath56 magnetic bragg peak by a lorentzian function @xmath65 where @xmath66 is the scattered intensity and @xmath67 is the inverse of the correlation length .",
    "the temperature dependence of the diffuse scattering intensity is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] . above @xmath68120",
    "k the diffuse scattering is too weak to be separated from the background scattering .",
    "below that temperature @xmath66 increases monotonically with cooling down to @xmath682  k. a fit to the neutron data with eq .",
    "( [ eq5 ] ) yielded at all temperatures , for which the diffuse scattering could be observed , @xmath69  ( rlu ) that corresponds to @xmath70   .",
    "both @xmath2sr spectroscopy and neutron diffraction have shown that a transition to a spin - glass state that coexists with long - range antiferromagnetic order occurs in the relaxor perovskite pb(fe@xmath0nb@xmath0)o@xmath1 at @xmath71  k. figure  [ fig1 ] shows that the asymmetry of the muon signal is rapidly lost below @xmath18 and does not recover when passing the spin - glass transition .",
    "this indicates that the magnetic - order is homogeneous and that it persists upon cooling the sample below @xmath46 .",
    "this is confirmed by the presence of the resolution - limited magnetic bragg peak at the lowest temperature showing that long - range antiferromagnetic order of the fe@xmath72 spins is still present below @xmath46 .",
    "the long - range antiferromagnetic order coexists with the disordered spin - glass - like phase .",
    "the signature of the spin - glass order appears in the neutron spectrum in the form of diffuse scattering .",
    "there are numerous examples of coexistence between the ferromagnetic and spin - glass states of matter  @xcite .",
    "for example , ferromagnetic and spin - glass orders are known to coexist in aufe alloys at sufficiently low temperatures  @xcite .",
    "antiferromagnetic and spin - glass orders are also known to coexist at sufficiently low temperatures , e.g. , in fe@xmath73mg@xmath74cl@xmath4  @xcite .",
    "the coexistence of collinear magnetic long - range order , e.g. , ferromagnetic or antiferromagnetic , and spin - glass order is well understood theoretically at the level of the sherrington - kirkpatrick ( sk ) @xcite infinite - range model for classical ( ising- or heisenberg ) spins . in the sk model , this coexistence is the rule below some critical temperature and down to the lowest temperatures as soon as the magnitude @xmath75 of the mean value of the random exchange coupling @xmath76 between any two spins is of the order of or larger than the standard deviation @xmath77 of its gaussian distribution .",
    "@xcite    classical spin models with short - range but random two - body spin interactions ( the edwards - anderson ( ea ) model of spin glasses  @xcite ) are not as well understood as the sk model .",
    "monte carlo simulations suggest that the lower critical dimension for the onset of spin - glass order when the disorder is dominant , @xmath78 , is strictly below three dimensions for ising spins ,  @xcite a prerequisite for the coexistence of collinear and spin - glass order when @xmath79.@xcite fluctuation effects are stronger for heisenberg spins than they are for ising spins , as fluctuations in the directions transverse to the direction taken by the collinear order parameter in spin space become available in the former case .",
    "correspondingly , state of the art monte carlo simulations give `` only '' the upper bound of three dimensions for the spin - glass lower critical dimension when the disorder is dominant , @xmath78.@xcite in other words , it can not be ruled out , within the accuracy of available monte carlo simulations , that the spin - glass phase is quasi - long - range ordered instead of long - range ordered when the classical spins are heisenberg - like in the three - dimensional ea model .",
    "given the uncertainty of the spin - glass lower - critical dimension for heisenberg ea spin - glass models , the mere observation that antiferromagnetic and spin - glass orders coexists in pb(fe@xmath0nb@xmath0)o@xmath1is not sufficient to establish whether the relevant magnetic degrees of freedom are ising- or heisenberg - like .",
    "although exchange interactions remain to be determined in pb(fe@xmath0nb@xmath0)o@xmath1 , the relatively high nel temperature of pb(fe@xmath0nb@xmath0)o@xmath1suggests that exchange interactions dominate dipolar and single - ion anisotropies in this compound . if this is the case , then pb(fe@xmath0nb@xmath0)o@xmath1 is a good candidate to study the coexistence of long - range antiferromagnetic and spin - glass orders for the heisenberg spins of a three - dimensional antiferromagnetic ea model .",
