    "random matrix theory ( rmt ) was introduced by wigner in the 1950s as a model for describing the universal spectral behavior of complex many - body systems such as compound nuclei .",
    "it was conjectured that a typical spectrum of a complex system displays statistical properties similar to those of a hamiltonian chosen at random from a basis - independent ensemble of random matrices in the same symmetry class .",
    "subsequently , dyson showed that the statistical predictions of rmt could be reproduced within a brownian motion model , where brownian motion of the energy levels results from a stochastic perturbation of some initial , possibly nonrandom , hamiltonian  @xcite .",
    "bohigas , giannoni , and schmit argued that the same universal behavior of the spectrum occurs generically even in single - particle systems , as long as the underlying classical dynamics is chaotic  @xcite .",
    "wilkinson used the brownian motion model to explain the connection between quantum chaotic systems and rmt spectra , using the  quantization ambiguity \" ( i.e , multiplicity of quantum systems having the same semiclassical limit ) as the source of perturbation causing brownian motion of the energy levels and eventual equilibration to rmt spectral statistics  @xcite .",
    "more recently , the brownian motion approach has been extended to study the evolution of eigenstates  @xcite and to relate the smooth and oscillatory parts of the spectral correlation function in diffusive and ballistic chaotic systems  @xcite .",
    "it well known that not all spectral modes of a typical quantum chaotic spectrum obey universal statistics .",
    "it is therefore of interest in the context of the brownian motion model to investigate which modes are equilibrated in a given dynamical system , for a given perturbation strength ( such as that arising from the quantization ambiguity ) , as a function of degree of chaos in the system , and as a function of effective @xmath0 .",
    "alternatively , one may ask about the size of perturbation necessary to achieve equilibration to universal statistics for a given spectral mode ; this question is related to work by zirnbauer on energy level correlations in a quantum ensemble of classically identical maps  @xcite , as well as to the method developed by gornyi and mirlin for studying wave function correlations in ballistic systems by adding weak smooth disorder  @xcite .    in the present work ,",
    "we show that the brownian motion model can be used successfully to predict the number of equilibrated spectral modes as a function of perturbation strength , chaoticity of the classical system dynamics , system dimension , and effective @xmath0 .",
    "the equilibration process is governed by two competing time scales , allowing the number of modes equilibrated to rmt either to increase or to decrease as the original system becomes more chaotic ; equilibration is reduced for systems with very short or very long classical relaxation times and is maximized for systems with intermediate lyapunov exponent .",
    "we show that in two - dimensional quantum systems no equilibration to universal behavior for any spectral modes can arise from the quantization ambiguity in the @xmath1 limit ; in three dimensions some modes may be equilibrated depending on the classical relaxation time of the underlying classical dynamics ; in four dimensions and higher , equilibration to universality will occur for at least some modes , but maximal equilibration requires the classical relaxation time to be much longer than the typical ballistic time scale of the dynamics .",

    "( [ kcond ] ) , valid as long as @xmath243 . in other words ,",
    "a mode @xmath81 is equilibrated to universal behavior by a given class of perturbations if and only if two conditions hold simultaneously : the quantum fidelity has decayed to a value much less than unity by the corresponding time @xmath182 _ and _ this time scale @xmath182 is larger than the classical relaxation time @xmath54 .",
    "another important connection is between spectral equilibration behavior discussed in the present work and the decay of semiclassical accuracy . since",
    "different quantizations of the same semiclassical dynamics differ by @xmath206 in the hamiltonian , the difference between a typical quantization and the semiclassical approximation must be at least of this order in the @xmath210 limit .",
    "thus the error in the semiclassical approximation must be at least of the same size as the error caused by an @xmath206 perturbation in quantum mechanics , assuming of course that the physically correct quantization is  typical \" .",
    "clearly , hard quantum effects such as diffraction can increase the error in the semiclassical approximation , so the @xmath206 quantization ambiguity only provides a lower bound on the size of the semiclassical error , or equivalently an upper bound on the breakdown time of semiclassical validity .",
    "previous work has shown that this bound on the semiclassical error is saturated for the case of a smooth hamiltonian in the absence of caustics  @xcite , and furthermore it was demonstrated that the semiclassical error obeys different scaling laws with time and @xmath0 for regular as opposed to chaotic classical systems , just as one would predict using the quantization ambiguity approach .",
    "the semiclassical accuracy problem may also be considered as an example of a generalized quantum fidelity problem , if non - hermitian perturbations are considered ( since semiclassical evolution is in general non - unitary ) .",
    "the results of the present work , particularly those of sec .",
    "[ secambig ] , imply an upper bound on the breakdown time scale of semiclassical accuracy : @xmath244 and a lower bound on the breakdown energy scale of semiclassical accuracy : @xmath245 where @xmath246 is a ballistic thouless energy .",
    "in particular , semiclassical accuracy will persist beyond the heisenberg time @xmath247 in any two - dimensional chaotic system ( assuming diffraction and caustics are properly accounted for ) , allowing individual energy levels and wave functions to be semiclassically resolved . in three - dimensional systems , @xmath248 , and @xmath249 . here",
    ", the semiclassical breakdown time may be comparable to the heisenberg time for the most chaotic systems ( @xmath250 ) , but any slowdown in the classical relaxation rate will cause a faster breakdown in the semiclassical approximation . finally , given four or more classical degrees of freedom ,",
    "semiclassical accuracy inevitably breaks down well before the heisenberg time for any generic dynamics , even the most chaotic , and semiclassical reproduction of individual spectral levels is never possible .",
    "it may be of interest to investigate the manner in which improved semiclassical approximations beyond leading order in @xmath0  @xcite may produce different scaling of the semiclassical error and possibly permit quantum spectra to be semiclassically resolved in four dimensions and higher .",
    "a careful examination of the brownian motion model for spectral equilibration to universal statistics shows that equilibration is strongly dependent on the classical relaxation rate as well as on the dimensionality of the system .",
    "two competing time scales , proportional and inversely proportional to the classical relaxation time @xmath54 , jointly govern the equilibration process .",
    "balancing of these two time scales implies that for a given perturbation @xmath22 , equilibration of the maximum number of spectral modes is achieved when @xmath251 . for small perturbations , @xmath252",
    ", a relation exists between spectral equilibration as a function of mode number @xmath81 and the decay of the quantum fidelity as a function of time .",
    "focusing on the effect of @xmath206 perturbations , associated with the ambiguity of quantization , we find that no equilibration to universal statistics is ever possible for dynamics in two dimensions . in three dimensions ,",
    "equilibration to universal statistics occurs for some modes , but only if the classical relaxation time @xmath54 is sufficiently long , while in four dimensions and higher , equilibration of at least some modes occurs for any chaotic system",
    ". however , optimal equilibration only occurs for very long classical relaxation times , @xmath253 .",
    "these predictions of the brownian motion model are also entirely consistent with results for semiclassical accuracy in smooth chaotic systems .",
