    "many snrs kinematic distances are obtained by observing radial velocities of atomic and molecular lines toward the snrs and using a circular rotation curve model .",
    "a circular rotation curve model is generally not suitable for galactic center ( gc ) objects because the gas likely follows oval orbits in the inner galaxy , i.e. inside the 3 kpc ring .",

    "the 1420 mhz radio continuum and 21 cm hi emission data sets are from the southern galactic plane survey ( sgps),using the australia telescope compact array and the parkes 64 m single dish telescope ( haverkorn et al . 2006 ) .",

    "this directly confirms that the 16.5 km s@xmath7 clouds are behind the remnant .",
    "hi absorption spectra towards galactic radio - bright objects have been used to estimate the line - of - sight distances based on a rotation curve model . however",
    ", it is a challenging job to constrain the distances to galactic objects in the inner 3 kpc of the galaxy because the objects likely follow non - circular orbits in the region ( see weiner & sellwood 1999 ) .",
    "the situation has improved due to recent studies of the galactic center s structure .",
    "high resolution hi observations ( mcclure - griffiths et al .",
    "2012 ) of the inner galaxy show greater details of the region s structure .",
    "co observations ( dame & thaddeus 2008 ) have detected the symmetric expanding 3 kpc arms , supporting the existence of a bar at the center of our galaxy .",
    "rodriguez - fernandez & combes ( 2008 ) iroveprovedd a gas distribution model for the gc region by simulating the gas dynamics in the inner galaxy .",
    "this model gives us an opportunity to better understand the hi and co spectra and refine the distance estimation of g349.7 + 0.2 .",
    "we adopt the 1985 iau standard for galactic parameters in this paper , i.e. r@xmath17 8.5 kpc ( the distance between sun and the gc ) and v@xmath18 = 220 km / s ( circular velocity at r@xmath17 ) .",
    "the hi terminal velocity at @xmath19=349@xmath20 to 350@xmath20 is about -190 km  s@xmath7 ( see fig . 2 of weiner & sellwood 1999 and of burton & liszt 1993 ) .",
    "we detect a weak absorption feature at -189 km  s@xmath7 in the spectrum of snr g349.7 + 0.2 , which is likely caused by clumps of hi possibly accelerated by a snr or hii region along this line - of - sight .",
    "the lowest - velocity major absorption feature , except for the -189 km  s@xmath7 feature , is at @xmath0 -110 km   s@xmath7 in the snr spectrum ( fig .",
    "this velocity is consistent with the expected radial velocity ( 101.6@xmath118.7 km   s@xmath7 ) of the near 3 kpc arm in the line - of - sight to @xmath19=349@xmath20 to 350@xmath20 ( equation ( 3 ) of jones et al .",
    "2013 , see also fig . 1 of dame & thaddeus 2008 ) .",
    "this is convincing evidence that the remnant is beyond the near 3 kpc arm .",
    "in addition , the highest - velocity absorption in the spectrum of g349.7 + 0.2 is at 6@xmath117 km  s@xmath7 .",
    "this is consistent with the expected radial velocity ( 16.3@xmath1115.6 km  s@xmath7 ) of the far 3 kpc arm toward @xmath19 @xmath0 - 10.3@xmath20 ( fig . 1 and equation ( 4 ) of jones et al .",
    "however , in the snr spectrum we found no hi absorption associated with the hi and co emission clouds at 16.5 km  s@xmath7 , which exactly lie in the far 3 kpc arm extending at least 20@xmath21 in longitude , starting at l=-12@xmath22 ( dame & thaddeus 2008 ) .",
    "these two pieces of evidence argue that the remnant is in the far 3 kpc arm ; the cold hi gas at 6@xmath117 km  s@xmath7 is in front of the remnant , and the hi and co clouds at 16.5 km  s@xmath7 are behind the remnant ( see fig.3 ) .",
    "snr g349.7 + 0.2 is known to be interacting with nearby molecular clouds because of clear evidence : there are five 1720 mhz oh masers along the radio emission ridge of the snr ( frail et al .",
    "1996 ) ; shock - excited near - infrared h@xmath6 emission has been found toward the center of the remnant as well as oh absorption ( 1665 and 1667 mhz ) in the remnant ( lazendic et al .",
    "2010 ) , and co expansion caused by the snr shock has been observed ( reynoso & mangum 2001 ) . because most 1720 mhz oh masers are seen as signposts of snr - molecular cloud interaction ( wardle & yusef - zadeh 2002 ) , their velocities have been used to determine kinematic distances to associated snrs based on a rotation curve model .",
    "the velocities of the 1720 mhz oh masers ( 14.3 to 16.9 km  s@xmath7 ) are nicely consistent with the velocity of shocked co clouds ( 16.5 km  s@xmath7 ) , also with the far 3 kpc arm velocity of @xmath0 16.3 km  s@xmath7 . combined with the hi absorption analysis",
    ", we conclude that the 16.5 km  s@xmath7 co clouds are behind but shocked by snr g349.7 + 0.2 and this snr - cloud interaction excites the near - infrared h@xmath6 emission and the 1720 mhz oh maser emission in the region .",
    "an hi 21-cm absorption line study of g347.9 + 0.2 has previously been done using the parkes hydrogen line interferometer ( caswell et al .",
    "our absorption spectrum confirms the previous major absorption features near -110 km  s@xmath7 , -62.5 km  s@xmath7 , and 6 km  s@xmath7 .",
    "but we find more fine structure because of the better quality of the sgps data ( higher continuum sensitivity and hi spectral resolution ) and the improved methods .",
    "we find new absorption features at -35 and -189 km  s@xmath7 , no absorption at 20 and 38 km  s@xmath7 , much lower noise for baselines above 20 km  s@xmath7 and below -125 km  s@xmath7 .",
    "caswell et al .",
    "( 1975 ) explained the -62.5 km  s@xmath7 feature as from the far ring of 3 - 4 kpc arm and the 6 km  s@xmath7 feature as from local gas , based on 1970s knowledge of the galactic center , so they suggested a distance of 13.7 kpc @xmath23 d @xmath23 23 kpc for snr g349.7 - 0.2 .",
    "however , our analysis utilizes new information that the near and the far 3 kpc arms have kinematic velocities of -110 and -16.5 km  s@xmath7 towards g347.9 + 0.2 respectively , combined with our new result of reliable absorption at 6@xmath117 km  s@xmath7 .",
    "thus we find the snr has no absorption associated with the 16.5 km  s@xmath7 clouds in the far 3 kpc arm . in this case ,",
    "the -62.5 km  s@xmath7 feature is likely caused by much closer hi clouds whose motion follows the normal rotation curve model .",
    "our conclusion is strongly supported by other evidence : the hi absorption at -62.5 km / s is also clearly seen in absorption spectra of the nearby snrs g348.5 + 0.1 and g348.5 - 0.0 , which both have distances of less than 9.5 kpc ( tian & leahy 2012 ) ; and the remnant is interacting with 16.5 km / s clouds in the far 3 kpc arm .",
    "previously , the 1720 mhz oh masers at 14.3 to 16.9 km  s@xmath7 were assumed to be outside of the solar circle based on the circular rotation curve model , so snr g349.7 + 0.2 was suggested to have a kinematic distance of @xmath0 22 kpc .",
    "now we know that the circular rotation curve model is not valid near the gc , so we conclude that the snr and its nearby clouds are located in the far 3 kpc arm , well within the solar circle .    snr g349.7 + 0.2",
    "is located at the near edge of the far 3 kpc arm because there is no absorption from the main part of the far 3 kpc arm ( which has center velocity 16.5 km  s@xmath7 ) .",
    "the far 3 kpc arm is at a distance of @xmath0 11.5 kpc ( dame & thaddeus 2008 , jones et al .",
    "no precise thickness of the 3 kpc arm scale is available so far , so we here give an approximate distance of @xmath0 11.5 kpc for snr g349.7 - 0.2 .",
    "previous chandra x - ray observations of snr g349.7 + 0.3 gave a column density of 7 @xmath1 10@xmath13 @xmath14 .",
    "this is consistent with the estimate from adding hi ( 2.8 @xmath1 10@xmath13 @xmath14 , assuming t@xmath15=140 k ) and h@xmath24 ( 4.6 @xmath1 10@xmath13 @xmath14 , assuming co - to - h@xmath24 conversion factor @xmath25 = 1.8@xmath110@xmath26@xmath14 k@xmath7 km  s@xmath7 ) emission ( lazendic et al .",
    "our calculation of the column density against g349.7 + 0.2 by hi absorption ( using t@xmath27=100 k ) is @xmath01.4 x 10@xmath13 @xmath14 ) , similar to lazendic et al .",
    "the hi column density measures neutral hydrogen , whereas the x - ray column density is sensitive to the heavier element component in the total gas ( hi , h@xmath6 and hii ) plus dust .",
    "so the x - ray column density could easily be 3 or more times higher than the hi column density .",
    "in addition , it is generally known that the column density value is strongly related with direction of a source , because the galactic hi has a different distribution along different lines of sight .",
    "for example , snr g18.8 + 0.3 has a distance of 12 kpc and column densities of 2 x 10@xmath13 @xmath14 from hi and 3.2 10@xmath13 @xmath14 from h@xmath6 ) ( tian et al .",
    "generally , there are more clouds towards the gc than other directions , so there is no inconsistency in column densities with g349.7 + 0.2 being at 11.5 kpc .    it should be noted that kinematic distances to galactic objects always include uncertainty due to uncertain parameters of different rotation curve models and wide - spread non - circular streaming motions .",
    "this uncertainty may reach up to 20% at the particular longitude of some objects ( jones et al .",
    "snr g349.7 + 0.2 is within the far 3 kpc arm : its distance s uncertainty is from the r@xmath18 value and the width of the arm .",
    "the iau standard is r@xmath18 = 8.5 kpc , but recent measurements show a smaller value , e.g. 8.4@xmath110.6 kpc from vlbi trigonometric parallax measurements ( reid et al . 2009 ) , 8.05 @xmath11 0.45 kpc from vlbi astrometry ( honma et al .",
    "2013 ) , 8.33@xmath110.19 kpc from optical and near - infrared observation of known rr lyrae stars in the bulge ( dekany et al .",
    "2013 ) etc .",
    "the uncertainty of r@xmath18 is about 0.5 kpc .",
    "the width of the far 3kpc arm is not yet known but should be smaller than the error of r@xmath18 .",
    "we therefore estimate a distance of 11.5@xmath110.7 kpc for the far 3 kpc arm .    in summary",
    ", we significantly revise the distance to g349.7 + 0.2 from a previous 22 kpc to 11.5 kpc , based on better understanding of the gc structure .",
    "we previously revised distances to three other snrs nearby g349.7 + 0.2 ( tian & leahy 2012 ) .",
    "one should use caution when considering old kinematic distances of galactic objects ( e.g. snrs , pulsars and hii regions ) in the range of -12@xmath28 and having distance estimates of @xmath5 5.5 kpc .",
    "g349.7 + 0.2 has been suggested as one of the brightest galactic sources in the radio ( shaver et al .",
    "1985 ) , x - ray ( slane et al . 2002 ) and gev @xmath3-ray wavebands ( castro & slane 2010 ) because of its large distance .",
    "we give its luminosity based on the new distance measurement here : l@xmath29 watt hz@xmath7 , l@xmath30 erg s@xmath7 , l@xmath31 @xmath03.6 @xmath1 10@xmath32 erg s@xmath7 .",
    "the angular diameter of g349.7 + 0.2 ( @xmath02@xmath33 ) from chandra ( lazendic et al .",
    "2005 ) , yields a radius of r = 3.3 pc ( d = 11.5 kpc ) for the snr .",
    "lazendic et al.(2005 ) find a shock velocity of @xmath0710 km s@xmath7 based on the x - ray measured plasma temperature .",
    "the small remnant size and fast shock velocity indicate that the remnant is still evolving in the sedov phase .",
    "so we estimate its age of @xmath01800 yr by applying the sedov model ( cox 1972 , also see equations 4 and 5 of reynoso & mangum 2001 ) using the known remnant radius and shock velocity .",
    "the sn explosion energy depends on the environment density n@xmath34 . using the x - ray emission measure from the chandra spectrum of 9.9@xmath110@xmath35 @xmath36 ( lazendic et al .",
    "2005 ) and a sedov interior density profile ( see leahy et al .",
    "2013 ) , the ism density is n@xmath34 @xmath0 10 @xmath36 ( d = 11.5kpc ) . g349.7 + 0.2 is then found to have a low explosion energy of 2.5@xmath110@xmath2 ergs .",
