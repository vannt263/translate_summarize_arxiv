    "a graph is called _ hypohamiltonian _ if it is not hamiltonian but becomes hamiltonian if any vertex is removed .",
    "such graphs exist on orders 10 ( the petersen graph ) , 13 , 15 , 16 , and all orders from 18 onwards  @xcite .",
    "it is elementary to show that hypohamiltonian graphs must be 3-connected and have cyclic connectivity at least  4 .",
    "a substantial body of literature is devoted to finding hypohamiltonian graphs with various properties .",
    "the first planar hypohamiltonian graph , with 105 vertices , was found by thomassen  @xcite ; the present smallest known order is 40 vertices but smaller orders have not been ruled out  @xcite .",
    "planar hypohamiltonian graphs can be cubic , as first shown by thomassen with an example on 94 vertices  @xcite .",
    "the smallest examples found so far have 70 vertices ; the first example by araya and wiener  @xcite and six more by jooyandeh and mckay  @xcite .",
    "planar hypohamiltonian graphs can also have girth 5 , and in this case the smallest order is proven to be 45  @xcite .",
    "however , it was not known until now whether planar hypohamiltonian graphs can be both cubic and of girth 5 .",
    "our purpose is to present the first examples .",
    "using the program  ` plantri `  @xcite we generated all planar cubic graphs of girth 5 and cyclic connectivity at least 4 on up to 76 vertices .",
    "no theory is known which could efficiently restrict the search to a small subclass sure to contain the hypohamiltonian graphs , so we just tested all of them .",
    "the computational task was daunting as more than @xmath0 graphs are involved and 76 vertices is large enough that a primitive backtrack search for hamiltonian cycles takes up to several hours per graph .",
    "fortunately we have a program ( unpublished ) specifically designed for sub - cubic graphs that takes only 10 microseconds on average to find a hamiltonian cycle if there is one , and 15 milliseconds on average to rigorously prove that there is none .",
    "even then the task took about 8 years of cpu time .",
    "the results are shown in table  [ tab ] .",
    "for at most 74 vertices there are no hypohamiltonian graphs , but for 76 vertices there are three .",
    "all of them have cyclic connectivity 5 .",
    "the graphs themselves are shown in figures  [ fig1][fig3 ] , which were drawn by cage  @xcite .",
    "note that the graphs have different face counts despite having some similarities .",
    "the non - hamiltonicity of these graphs does not follow immediately from grinberg s condition , so we tested them with several independent programs to remove the possibility of error .",
    "contrary to our usual experience of extremal graphs , none of them have any non - trivial automorphisms .",
    "we did not find a way to generalize these examples to larger sizes despite trying several approaches , so the problem of finding an infinite family remains open .",
