    "the be binary system  ( associated with the radio source gt 0236 + 610 ) is remarkable for dramatic radio outbursts occurring with the 26.5 day orbital cycle ( @xcite ) , and for its possible association with the 100 mev gamma - ray source 2cg  135 + 01 ( @xcite ) .",
    "radio flares lasting several days occur every orbit , with the peak flux varying in phase by up to half the orbital cycle .",
    "the binary is a weak , variable x - ray source ( @xcite ) with a non - thermal spectrum .",
    "egret measurements indicate that the 100  mev emission from the region may also be variable  ( @xcite ) .",
    "the gamma - ray error box contains no other likely counterparts .",
    "the gamma - ray localization is not , however , sufficiently accurate to make a secure association between 2cg  135 + 01 and .    the mechanisms responsible for the radio outbursts and variable x - ray emission are not well understood .",
    "the radio emission is consistent with optically - thin synchrotron radiation for most of the outburst , with indication that the source is self - absorbed at the beginning of the outburst rise ( @xcite ) .",
    "the x - ray emission is consistent with either an extension of the radio synchrotron spectrum , or inverse compton scattering of the stellar photons by the relativistic electrons responsible for the radio flux ( @xcite ) .",
    "the most plausible models proposed for the origin of the relativistic electrons are acceleration in a shock produced at the interaction of the be star wind with the relativistic wind of a young pulsar companion ( @xcite ) , or in a shock produced by the ejection of matter accreted onto a pulsar magnetosphere ( @xcite ) . in either case , both the x - ray and radio emission would vary with orbital phase .    in this paper , we present simultaneous _ rxte _ x - ray , green bank interferometer ( gbi ) and ryle telescope radio observations taken over a single orbital cycle .",
    "these observations provide a complete orbital light curve in 210 kev x - rays and 2.25 ghz , 8.3 ghz , and 15 ghz radio frequencies . on only one prior occasion",
    "has  been monitored in the x - ray band over an entire orbital cycle ( @xcite ) .",
    "we have also analyzed archival x - ray data and compiled a history of the x - ray variability .",
    "we have established x - ray flux variations on hourly timescales , and have performed the most sensitive searches to date for rapid x - ray pulsations from the suggested neutron star companion .",
    "in addition , we have analyzed the 2  150 kev spectra of both  and the nearby quasar qso  0241 + 622 , which has been included in the field of view of many previous hard x - ray measurements .",
    ".observation log of rxte observations of , with fitted fluxes . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     in addition to the _ rxte _ search , we performed a pulsation search on the _ asca _ data .",
    "for the gis detectors during p1 the time resolution of 0.0625  s limits the search to a minimum period of 0.125  s , and for p2 , the minimum period searched is 1.0  s , corresponding to the nyquist limit for the 0.5  s sampling .",
    "epoch folding using the standard xronos software ( available from the high energy astrophysics science archive research center ( heasarc ) at goddard space flight center ) failed to detect periodicity in either pointing .",
    "table  2 summarizes the 90% confidence upper limits on the amplitude of pulsed emission for searches on the separate and combined gis 1 and 2 data .",
    "we calculated these limits using the formalism described in leahy _",
    "et al . _ ( 1983 )  . a second source in the asca fov , identified as a stellar source ( labeled source2 ) was also searched for pulsations , and the upper limits are also given in table  2 .",
    "for p1 , in addition to the epoch folding , we performed an fft , which yielded nearly identical upper limits on the pulsed amplitude fraction as the epoch folding . for p2 ,",
    "aperiodic variability in the source precluded the use of an fft for period searching ( see   [ sec - aperiodic ] ) .",
    "we also searched the sis data to a minimum period of 8 s , ( determined by the 4 s ccd readout time ) , and found no pulsations , with limits similar to those presented for the gis .    to search for short - period pulsations ,",
    "for which smearing of the pulsed signal due to variable doppler shifts resulting from the binary orbital motion can be important , we performed an acceleration search on the gis data from p1 .",
    "the variation in the pulse frequency is well - approximated by a linear trend over the duration of each observation .",
    "we searched a range of constant frequency derivatives from @xmath1s@xmath2 ( consistent with the range expected from the orbital solutions ) in 1600 spacings .",
    "no periodicity was detected .",
    "several common characteristics of the two simultaneous , well - sampled x - ray and radio lightcurves ( figures [ fig - xtelight ] and [ fig - rosatlight ] ) are evident .",
    "both are clearly modulated at the orbital period , and the peak in the x - ray emission is significantly offset ( by 0.4  0.5 in phase ) from the peak in the radio emission .",
    "although containing only two data points , the _ asca _ observations are also consistent with the anticorrelation of radio and x - ray emission . in the _ rosat _ 0.5  2 kev data ,",
    "the ratio of peak to quiescent luminosity is a factor @xmath320 , similar to what is observed in the radio , while in the _ rxte / pca _ 210 kev data , the variation is a factor 3  7 ( the range depending on the uncertain zero point ) . because of the poor spectral resolution and narrow bandpass of the _ rosat _ data , and the difficulty in determining spectral parameters in the _ rxte / pca _ data , it is impossible to determine if this difference arises from variable x - ray absorption ( potentially important in the soft _ rosat _ band but negligible for the pca ) , variation in the spectral index , or variation in the x - ray outburst intensity orbit - to - orbit .",
    "these observations suggest that it is unlikely that both the x - ray and the radio flux arise from synchrotron emission from a common electron population .",
    "rather , it is more likely that the x - ray flux results from inverse compton scattering of stellar photons off a quasi - steady relativistic electron population .",
    "first , it is difficult to accomodate a significant offset between the x - ray and radio peaks if both result from synchrotron emission from a common population .",
    "furthermore , for reasonable synchrotron models for the radio emission , inverse compton losses should dominate at x - ray wavelengths over the entire orbit .",
    "for example , peracaula ( 1997 ) has modeled the synchrotron emission from an expanding spherical plasmon ejected from the binary system to explain the radio emission . to fit these data ,",
    "the initial radius is @xmath4  cm , the distance from the star is the orbital separation ( @xmath5 cm ) , the magnetic field is @xmath6  g , and the expansion velocity is @xmath7  cm / s .",
    "electrons are injected uniformly into the expanding sphere at a steady rate over 7 days . in this model , to get the radio rise requires a large initial @xmath8 , and for the implied magnetic field and @xmath8 , inverse compton losses will dominate over synchrotron losses at all distances from the star . for synchrotron losses to be important at x - ray energies",
    "requires @xmath9  g for an electron population with spectral index 2.1 ( steeper spectral index requires a higher field ) .",
    "the small - amplitude of the orbital modulation of the x - ray flux relative to the radio observed by _",
    "rxte _ indicates that the electron population responsible for the inverse compton emission is relatively constant , with the flux modulation likely resulting from variations in the stellar photon density as a function of position in an eccentric orbit .",
    "the x - ray maximum will occur near periastron , where the stellar photon density is highest ( although some offset is possible if the be star equator is not aligned with the orbit ) .",
    "the factor 3  6 x - ray variations would imply @xmath10 , or orbital eccentricity @xmath11 for a steady electron population .",
    "this range is consistent with the poorly - defined orbital parameters , which allow a range of eccentricity from 0.2  0.8  ( @xcite ) .",
    "as originally proposed by marashi and treves ( 1981 ) , a relatively steady electron population could be produced at the shock resulting from the interaction of the relativistic wind of a young pulsar with the be stellar wind .",
    "the pulsar wind would create a cavity , with the boundary determined by dynamic pressure balance .",
    "these electrons inverse compton scatter the stellar photons , producing x - ray emission , modulated by the variation in photon flux due to an eccentric orbit .",
    "the observed 2  10  kev x - ray luminosity of @xmath12  erg  s@xmath13 is consistent with the shock interpretation , and is similar to the observed luminosity near periastron of psr  b1259@xmath1463  ( @xcite ) , for which a similar mechanism has been invoked  ( @xcite ) .",
    "this model is also consistent with the lack of observed x - ray pulsations , since the x - ray emission is produced well outside the pulsar magnetosphere .    to explain the periodic radio outbursts",
    "requires an expanding plasmon .",
    "this could be produced when , sometime after periastron , the stellar wind pressure at the back side of the cavity becomes low enough that the cavity is no longer closed , allowing relativistic particles to stream away from the system , producing the radio emission and the observed expanding vlbi source . in this scenario ,",
    "the x - ray peak should occur at periastron , and the radio outburst approximately 0.5 in phase away , as is observed .",
    "if 2cg 135 + 01 is associated with the system , the 100  mev gamma - rays could also be produced via the inverse compton mechanism by electrons of energy @xmath15  erg .",
    "this emission should also be modulated at the orbital period .",
    "the egret flux from 2cg  135 + 01 is , in fact , time variable on day timescales  ( @xcite ) , however the statistics are not sufficient to establish an orbital modulation .",
    "numerous instruments have claimed detection of  at hard x - ray and gamma - ray energies , however few have had positioning capability sufficient to distinguish between emission from the binary and qso  0241 + 622 ( qso  0241 + 622 being the only source within a several degree radius with a known hard spectrum ) .",
    "figure  [ fig - hespec ] summarizes some of the most secure hard x - ray and gamma - ray detections from this region . as described previously ,",
    "the pca and hexte clearly detect both sources . in the pca ,",
    "the quasar 2  10  kev flux is a factor @xmath32 higher than the average high - state of . in hexte , the quasar 15  40  kev flux ( determined at a different epoch than the pca quasar measurement ) is a factor 2  7 higher than the hexte  detection .",
    "this would tend to indicate variability of the qso , however the statistics are limited . to derive pca fluxes for , given the uncertainties in the pca background subtraction and response for the pointing",
    ", we fit a power law model with photon index 1.8 ( consistent with the _ asca _ values ) , and we show a range that includes uncertainty in the zero level . for the hexte quasar detection , we used the standard background subtraction , and fit a flat spectrum over the 15 - 40 kev band to determine the flux .",
    "the osse and comptel measurements shown in the figure included both  and qso  0241 + 622 in the instrument fields of view ( @xcite).the egret angular resolution is sufficient to exclude the quasar as the source of the gamma - ray emission ( but the 13  error radius makes positive association of the 100 mev flux with  uncertain ) .",
    "it is clear from the _ rxte _ observations that both the osse and comptel measurements were dominated by flux from the quasar .",
    "both observations integrated over times comparable to the  orbit , and should be consistent with the average  flux , which is a factor @xmath16 lower than the qso flux .",
    "our observations have confirmed that the x - ray and soft gamma - ray emission from  is variable , and modulated on the orbital timescale .",
    "the _ rxte _",
    "observations sample a harder band than the previous _ rosat _ data , and we can eliminate variable absorption as the source of the flux modulation . from the two well - sampled lightcurves ,",
    "it is clear that the x - ray emission peaks almost half an orbit before the radio .",
    "one explanation for this offset is that the high - energy emission is produced by inverse compton scattering of stellar photons by a population of relativistic electrons produced at a nearly steady rate at the shock interaction of the relativistic wind of a young pulsar and the be star wind .",
    "this would produce an x - ray peak near periastron .",
    "the synchrotron radio emission would then arise from the expansion of the plasma near apastron , when the cavity produced by the pulsar is no longer confined .",
    "our observations fail to detect x - ray pulsations that would signify the presence of a young neutron star .",
    "we also detected x - ray emission from the nearby qso  0241 + 622 in the 2  150 kev band .",
    "the quasar is an approximate factor of 2 brighter than the average high - state  flux at these energies .",
    "previous 100 kev  mev observations of the field made by osse and comptel were therefore likely dominated by the quasar emission .",
    "the broadband 1  kev  100  mev spectrum of  therefore remains uncertain .",
    "future high - energy missions , such as _ glast _ , will have the angular resolution and flux sensitivity to both positionally associate 2cg 135 + 01 and , and detect orbital modulation in the 100  mev flux , if it exists .",
    "we would like to thank keith jahoda and the xte gof staff for assistance with the xte software and background models .",
