    "given such a triangulation ( see for example fig .  [ ex_124221423 ] ) , the sequence of numbers of triangles at each vertex has been called its _ quiddity cycle _ by conway and coxeter @xcite because this sequence is the first row of any _ frieze pattern _ and thus contains the `` quiddity '' of the frieze .",
    "the main result of this paper is :    for any @xmath0 we may compute finite sets of sequences @xmath1 and @xmath2 , where the elements of @xmath2 have length at least @xmath3 , and such that every quiddity cycle not in @xmath1 has an element of @xmath2 as a ( consecutive ) subsequence .    in other words ,",

    "they also produce a rich set of combinatorial invariants called the weyl groupoids .",
    "the weyl groupoid ( see for example @xcite,@xcite ) was the essential tool in heckenberger s classification of finite dimensional nichols algebras of diagonal type in which case the real roots of the weyl groupoid form a finite root system @xcite .",
    "a natural question is to classify those nichols algebras for which the weyl groupoid produces infinitely many roots .",
    "of course , such a classification is probably a long term project , thus the very first question is to classify only the nichols algebras of rank two , and only those for which the root system defines a tits cone which is a half space , i.e. , the corresponding weyl groupoid is then called `` affine '' .",
    "the classification of affine weyl groupoids of rank two was treated in joint work with bernhard mhlherr and christian weigel which started at an oberwolfach miniworkshop in october 2012 , see @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "it turns out that an affine weyl groupoid of rank two may be identified with its `` characteristic sequence '' , an infinite sequence of positive integers .",
    "theorem [ affwgd : ranktwo ] gives an explicit construction of such a characteristic sequence by gluing quiddity cycles together .",
    "these sequences also correspond to certain infinite friezes ( see @xcite ) .",
    "it is not too difficult to find out that , if a rank two nichols algebra produces a weyl groupoid with root system , then this algebra is uniquely determined by at most three ( possibly four in a special case ) consecutive entries in the characteristic sequence .",
    "thus an important result required for the classification of affine rank two nichols algebras is to reduce the number of potential weyl groupoids to a finite set of subsequences .",
    "this is where we apply theorem [ etaseqsubsets ] : in corollary [ 15cases ] we conclude that only @xmath8 cases need to be considered in the case of affine rank two nichols algebras of diagonal type . after a short computation , we obtain a complete description of the corresponding bicharacters . some of them may be identified as classical algebras , others should be investigated more thoroughly .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "the first section is purely combinatorial ; we prove the main theorem and a variation required later . in the second section we briefly explain ( in very elementary terms ) how to obtain the weyl groupoid from the bicharacter of a rank two nichols algebra of diagonal type . in the last section ,",
