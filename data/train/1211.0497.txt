    "ultra high energy cosmic rays ( uhecr ) are the most energetic particles observed in nature , with energies up to few@xmath0 ev . nowadays the experimental study of uhecr is conducted by three different experiments : auger in argentina , hires and telescope array in the usa .",
    "the propagation of uhecr from the source to the observer is conditioned by their interactions with astrophysical backgrounds : the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) and the extragalactic background light ( ebl ) .",
    "understanding the key features of the propagation is of paramount importance to interpret experimental observations paving the way for the discovery of the astrophysical origin of these fascinating particles .",
    "several features of the observed spectrum can be directly linked to the chemical composition of uhecr and to their sources ( greisen 1966 , zatsepin & kuzmin 1966 , berezinsky et al .",
    "2006a , aloisio et .",
    "2007 , aloisio & boncioli 2011 ) . among such features",
    "particularly important is the greisin , zatsepin and kuzmin ( gzk ) suppression of the flux , an abrupt depletion of the observed proton spectrum , arising at energies @xmath1 ev , due to the interaction of uhe protons with the cmb radiation field ( greisen 1966 , zatsepin & kuzmin 1966 ) . the gzk suppression , as follows from the original papers , is referred to protons and it is due to the photo - pion production process on the cmb radiation field @xmath2 . in the case of nuclei",
    "the expected flux also shows a suppression at the highest energies that , depending on the nuclei specie , is due to the photo - disintegration process on the cmb and ebl radiation fields @xmath3 ( aloisio et .",
    "another important feature in the spectrum that can be directly linked with the nature of the primary particles and their origin ( galactic / extra - galactic ) is the pair - production dip ( berezinsky et al .",
    "2006a , aloisio et al . 2007 ) .",
    "this feature is present only in the spectrum of uhe extragalactic protons and , as the gzk , is a direct consequence of the proton interaction with the cmb radiation field , in particular the dip brings a direct imprint of the pair production process @xmath4 suffered by protons .    from the experimental point of view",
    "the situation is far from being clear with different experiments claiming contradictory results .",
    "the hires experiment , not anymore taking data , showed a proton dominated spectrum till the highest energies ( hires collaboration 2008 , 2010 ) while the auger observations show an heavy mass composition at energies @xmath5 ev ( auger collaboration 2010 ) .",
    "this puzzling situation , with different experiments favoring different scenarios , shows once more the importance of a systematic study of uhecr propagation in astrophysical backgrounds . in the present paper",
    "we will review the main points of two alternative computation schemes which enable the determination of the fluxes expected on earth fixing the injection spectrum and the distribution of sources .",
    "these two schemes are based on different approaches to model particle interactions with backgrounds : the continuum energy losses ( cel ) approximation , which is the base for the kinetic approach , and the monte carlo ( mc ) technique .    as we will discuss in the following these two different schemes give reliable results that , in the framework of the different assumptions , agree each other offering a suitable theoretical framework to study experimental results unveiling the intimate nature of uhecr .",
    "the main assumption under which the kinetic theory is build is the cel approximation ( berezinsky et al 1990 ) , through which particle interactions are treated as a continuum process that continuously depletes the particles energy .",
    "uhecr propagating through astrophysical backgrounds suffer different interaction processes    * _ protons _ - uhe protons interact only with the cmb radiation field giving rise to the two processes of pair production and photo - pion production .",
    "both of these reactions can be treated in the cel hypothesis .",
    "* _ nuclei _ - uhe nuclei interact with the cmb and ebl radiation fields , suffering the process of pair production , for which only cmb is relevant , and photo - disintegration , that involves both backgrounds cmb and ebl .",
    "while the first process can be treated in the cel hypothesis , being the nuclei specie conserved , the second can not be , producing a change in the nucleus specie .",
    "following aloisio et .",
    "al . 2012a , in the framework of the kinetic approach",
    ", we will treat the photo - disintegration process as a `` decaying '' process that simply depletes the flux of the propagating nucleus .",
    "taking into account all energy losses processes we can describe the propagation of protons and nuclei through kinetic equations of the type : @xmath6 = q_p(\\gamma , t ) \\label{eq : kin_p}\\ ] ] @xmath7 + \\frac{n_{a}(\\gamma , t ) } { \\tau_{a}(\\gamma , t ) }   = q_{a}(\\gamma , t ) \\label{eq : kin_a}\\ ] ] where @xmath8 is the equilibrium distribution of particles , @xmath9 are the energy losses ( adiabatic expansion of the universe and pair / photo - pion production for protons or only pair - production for nuclei ) @xmath10 is the injection of freshly accelerated particles and , in the case of nuclei , also the injection of secondary particles produced by photo - disintegration ( see below ) .    the energy losses @xmath9 for protons or nuclei depend only on the cmb field and in the cel hypothesis can be computed analytically ( berezinsky et .",
    "al . 2006a , aloisio et .",
    "2007 , aloisio et .",
    "2012a ) .    the second process that affects nuclei propagation is photo - disintegration over cmb and ebl backgrounds .",
    "this process is treated as a decaying process that depletes the flux of nuclei , it enters in the kinetic equation ( see equation ( [ eq : kin_a ] ) ) through a sort of `` life - time '' of the nucleus under the photo - disintegration process .",
    "this `` life - time '' corresponds to the mean time needed to a nucleus of lorentz factor @xmath11 and atomic mass number @xmath12 to lose , at least , one of its nucleons : @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the photo - disintegration cross - section and @xmath15 is the molteplicity associated with this process , namely the average number of nucleons extracted from the nucleus by a single interaction and @xmath16 .",
    "the dependence on red - shift of @xmath17 directly follows from the evolution with red - shift of the background photon densities @xmath18 and @xmath19 . in the case of cmb",
    "this dependence is known analytically while for the ebl one should refer to evolution models ( in our computations we have used the model by stecker et .",
    "al . 2006 ) .",
    "one important feature of the photo - disintegration process is that it starts to contribute to the propagation of nuclei at a lorentz factor that is almost independent of the nuclei specie @xmath20 ( aloisio et al .",
    "this is an important general characteristic of nuclei photo - disintegration process from which we can immediately deduce the dependence on the nucleus specie of the energy corresponding to the photo - disintegration suppression of the flux : @xmath21 being @xmath12 the atomic mass number of the nucleus and @xmath22 the proton mass . from this expression for @xmath23 it is evident how the flux behavior could bring informations on the chemical composition of the uhecr , in the case of helium ( @xmath24 ) the suppression is expected around energies @xmath25 ev while in the case of iron ( @xmath26 ) the suppression is expected at higher energies @xmath27 ev .",
    "let us discuss now the generation function @xmath28 in the right hand side of eq .",
    "( [ eq : kin_a ] ) .",
    "one should distinguish among primary nuclei , i.e. nuclei accelerated at the source and injected in the intergalactic space , and secondary nuclei and nucleons , i.e. particles produced as secondaries in the photo - disintegration chain . in the case of primaries the injection function is an assumption of the source model , while the injection of secondaries should be modeled taking into account the characteristics of the photo - disintegration process .",
    "the dominant process of photo - disintegration is the one nucleon ( @xmath29 ) emission , namely the process @xmath30 , this follows directly from the behavior of the photo - disintegration cross - section ( see aloisio et al .",
    "2012a and references therein ) that shows the giant dipole resonance corresponding to one nucleon emission .",
    "moreover , at the typical energies of uhecr ( @xmath31 ev ) one can safely neglect the nucleus recoil so that photo - disintegration will conserve the lorentz factor of the particles . therefore the production rate of secondary @xmath32nucleus and @xmath32associated nucleons will be given by @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the photo - disintegration life - time of the nucleus father @xmath35 and @xmath36 is its equilibrium distribution , solution of the kinetic equation ( [ eq : kin_a ] ) .",
    "using equation ( [ eq : inja ] ) we can build a system of coupled differential equations that starting from primary injected nuclei @xmath37 follows the complete photo - disintegration chain for all secondary nuclei @xmath38 and nucleons .",
    "clearly secondary protons propagation will be described by the proper kinetic equation ( [ eq : kin_p ] ) with an injection term given by ( [ eq : inja ] ) .",
    "the solution of the kinetic equation for protons and nuclei can be worked out analytically . in the case of protons : @xmath39 being @xmath40 the injection of primary protons or secondary protons ( equation ( [ eq : inja ] ) ) and @xmath41 is the characteristic function of the kinetic equation ( aloisio et al .",
    "in the case of nuclei : @xmath42 being , again , @xmath43 the injection of primary or secondary ( [ eq : inja ] ) nuclei . the exponential term in eq .",
    "( [ eq : na - solut ] ) represents the survival probability during the propagation time @xmath44 for a nucleus with fixed @xmath12 and can be computed according to aloisio et al .",
    "the derivative term @xmath45 present in both solutions ( [ eq : np - solut ] ) and ( [ eq : na - solut ] ) is analytically given ( aloisio et al .",
    "the kinetic approach outlined above neglects interactions fluctuations considering an ( average ) continuum loss of energy suffered by particles .",
    "this approximation in the case of protons , has a limited effect on the flux computation only at the highest energies ( @xmath46 eev ) ( berezinsky et al .",
    "2006a , berezinsky et al",
    ". 2006b , aloisio et al . 2007 ) .    in order to evaluate the effects of fluctuations on the expected nuclei flux",
    "we have build a computation scheme alternative to the kinetic one , that uses the mc technique to simulate nuclei interactions .",
    "first of all , let us remark that fluctuations could be relevant only in the case of nuclei photo - disintegration , this follows from the fact that the pair - production process involving nuclei can be considered as an interaction process of the inside nucleon , therefore being fluctuations in the protons pair - production irrelevant ( berezinsky et al .",
    "2006b ) the same holds for nuclei .",
    "the mc simulation scheme we have developed _ simprop _ ( aloisio et al .",
    "2012b ) is mono - dimensional : it does not take into account spatial distributions tagging sources only through their distance from the observer ( red - shift ) .",
    "the mc simulation propagates particles in steps of red - shift following the injected nucleus , secondary nuclei and protons produced at each photo - disintegration interaction and calculating their losses up to the observer , placed at red shift zero",
    ". the nuclear model on which _ simprop _ is based is the same used for the kinetic approach ( see aloisio et al",
    ". 2012a , 2012b and references therein ) . the stochastic nature of the nuclei photo - disintegration process is modeled through the survival probability of a nucleus of atomic mass number @xmath12 and lorentz factor @xmath11 @xmath47 where @xmath48 and @xmath49 are the values of the redshift of the current step ( from @xmath50 to @xmath48 ) .",
    "the _ simprop _ code is designed in such a way that any red - shift distribution of sources and any injection spectrum can be simulated .",
    "this is achieved drawing events from a flat distribution in the red - shift of the sources and of the logarithm of the injection energy . once the event is recorded at z = 0 the actual source / energy distribution is recovered through a proper weight attributed to the event ( aloisio et al .",
    "we will compare now the spectra obtained using _ simprop _ ( aloisio et al .",
    "2012b ) with those calculated solving the kinetic equation associated to the propagation of nuclei ( aloisio et al .",
    "2012a ) . to pursue such comparison , a pure iron injection with a power law injection of the type @xmath51 with @xmath52 have been assumed .",
    "the sources have been assumed to be homogeneously distributed in the red - shift range @xmath53 . in figure [ fig1 ] the fluxes expected at @xmath54 are shown for iron and secondary nuclei produced in the photo - disintegration chain suffered by primary injected irons .",
    "the points refer to the _ simprop _ results while the continuous lines to the fluxes computed in the kinetic approach .",
    "a good agreement between the two schemes is clearly visible in figure [ fig1 ] . at the highest energies the path - length of iron nuclei is very short .",
    "therefore , to achieve a good sampling in the mc simulation , higher statistics is needed ; this is the reason for larger errors bars in the _ simprop _ results at the highest energies .",
    "let us conclude discussing why it is useful to go beyond the kinetic approach .",
    "the kinetic approach has the important feature of being analytical : fluxes are computed mathematically solving a first principles equation ( aloisio et al .",
    "this means that the flux of primaries and secondaries is expressed in terms of several integrals that can be computed numerically , once the injection spectrum and the sources distribution are specified .",
    "in particular , the flux of secondary nuclei and nucleons produced in the photo - disintegration chain of a primary @xmath55 is obtained by the numerical computation of @xmath55 nested integrals and this computation should be repeated each time the hypothesis on sources ( injection and distribution ) are changed .",
    "this computation , while it is always feasible numerically , takes some time that can be substantially reduced using a mc computation scheme .",
    "this follows by the fact that , as discussed above , within the _ simprop _ approach it is possible to simulate different source distributions and injection spectra without repeating the overall propagation of particles . in this sense",
    "the mc approach presented here , which is the minimal stochastic extension of the kinetic approach , provides a faster computation scheme .",
    "i m grateful to all collaborators with whom the works presented here were developed : v. berezinsky , a. gazizov and s. grigorieva , from the theory group of the gran sasso laboratory , d. boncioli , a. grillo , s. petrera and f. salamida , auger group of laquila university , p. blasi , from the high energy astrophysics group of the arcetri astrophysical observatory .",
    "* roberto aloisio * this is an hypothesis that was recently put forward .",
    "i personally do not believe in such explanation because of the simple reason that at energies around @xmath56 ev , where already the difference between auger and hires starts , the universe visible in uhecr has a huge scale of the order of gpc .",
    "therefore it is very unlikely to have differences between observations carried out from the southern and northern hemispheres ."
