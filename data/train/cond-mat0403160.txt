    "peeling is a kind of fracture that has been studied experimentally in the context of adhesion and is a technologically important subject .",
    "experimental studies on peeling of an adhesive tape mounted on a cylindrical roll are usually in constant pull speed condition  @xcite .",
    "more recently , constant load experiments have also been reported  @xcite .",
    "early studies by bikermann  @xcite , kaeble  @xcite have attempted to explain the results by considering the system as a fully elastic object .",
    "this is clearly inadequate as it ignores the viscoelastic nature of the glue at the contact surface and therefore can not capture many important features of the dynamics .",
    "the first detailed experimental study of maugis and barquins  @xcite show stick - slip oscillations within a window of pull velocity with decreasing amplitude of the pull force as a function of the pull velocity .",
    "further , these authors report that the pull force shows sinusoidal , sawtooth and highly irregular ( chaotic as these authors refer to ) wave patterns with increasing velocities . more recently ,",
    "gandur _ et al .",
    "_ have carried out a dynamical time series analysis of the force waveforms , as well as those of acoustic emission signals and report chaotic force waveforms at the upper end of the pull velocities @xcite .",
    "one characteristic feature of the peeling process is that the experimental strain energy release rate shows two stable branches separated by an unstable branch .",
    "stick - slip behavior is commonly observed in a number of systems such as jerky flow or the portevin - le chatelier ( plc ) effect  @xcite , frictional sliding  @xcite , and even earthquake dynamics is thought to result from stick - slip of tectonic plates  @xcite .",
    "stick - slip is characterized by the system spending most part of the time in the stuck state and a short time in the slip state , and is usually seen in systems subjected to a constant response where the force developed in the system is measured by dynamically coupling the system to a measuring device .",
    "one common feature of such systems is that the force exhibits  negative flow rate characteristic \" ( nfrc ) .",
    "models which attempt to explain the dynamics of such systems use the macroscopic phenomenological nfrc feature as an input , although the unstable region is not accessible .",
    "this is true for models dealing with the dynamics of the adhesive tape as well .",
    "to the best of our knowledge , there is no microscopic theory which predicts the origin of the nfrc macroscopic law except in the case of the plc effect @xcite ( see below ) .    as there is a considerable similarity between the peeling of an adhesive tape and the plc effect , it is useful to consider the similarities in some detail .",
    "the plc effect refers to a type of plastic instability observed when samples of dilute alloys are deformed under constant cross head speeds @xcite .",
    "the effect manifests itself in the form of a series of serrations in a range of applied strain rates and temperatures .",
    "this feature is much like the peeling of an adhesive tape .",
    "other features common to these two situations are : abrupt onset of the large amplitude oscillations at low applied velocities with a gradually decreasing trend and nfrc , which in the plc effect refers to the existence of negative strain rate sensitivity of the flow stress . in the case of the plc effect , the physical origin of the negative strain rate sensitivity is attributed to the ageing of dislocations and their tearing away from the cloud of solute atoms .",
    "recently , the origin of the negative srs has been explicitly demonstrated as arising from competing time scales of pinning and unpinning in the ananthakrishna s model @xcite . in the case of adhesive tape",
    ", the origin of nfrc can be attributed to the viscoelastic behavior of the fluid .",
    "( constant load and constant load rate experiments are possible in the plc also . )",
    "while simple phenomenological models based on nfrc explain the generic features of the plc effect  @xcite , there appears to be some doubts if the equations of motion conventionally used in the present case of peeling are adequate to describe the velocity jumps @xcite .",
    "indeed , these equations of motion are singular and pose problems in the numerical solutions .    apart from detailed experimental investigation of the peeling process , maugis and barquins @xcite , have also contributed substantially to the understanding of the dynamics of the peeling process . however , the first dynamical analysis is due to hong and yue  @xcite who use an  n \" shaped function to mimic the dependence of the peel force on the rupture speed .",
    "they showed that the system of equations exhibits periodic and chaotic stick - slip oscillations .",
    "however , the jumps in the rupture speed are introduced _ externally _ once the rupture velocity exceeds the limit of stability  @xcite .",
    "thus , the stick - slip oscillations are _ not _ obtained as a natural consequence of the equations of motion .",
    "therefore , in our opinion the results presented in ref .",
    "@xcite are the artifacts of the numerical procedure followed .",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite interpret the stick - slip jumps as catastrophes .",
    "again , the belief that the jumps in the rupture velocity can not be obtained from the equations of motion appears to be the motivation for introducing the action of discrete operators on the state of the system to interpret the stick - slip jumps  @xcite , though they do not demonstrate the correctness of such a framework for the set of equations .",
    "lastly , there are no reports that explain the decrease in the amplitude of the peel force with increasing pull speed as observed in experiments .",
    "_ as there is a general consensus that these equations of motion correctly describe the experimental system , a proper resolution of this question ( on the absence of dynamical jumps in these equations ) assumes importance_.    the purpose of this paper is to show that the dynamics of stick - slip during peeling can be explained using a differential - algebraic scheme meant for such singular situations  @xcite and demonstrate the rich dynamics inherent to these equations . in what follows",
    "we first derive the equations of motion ( used earlier @xcite ) by introducing an appropriate lagrangian for the system .",
    "then , we use an algorithm meant to solve differential - algebraic equations @xcite and present the results of our simulations for various parameter values .",
    "one of our major findings is that inertia has a strong influence on the dynamics .",
    "in addition , following the dynamization scheme similar to the one used in the context of the plc effect @xcite , we suggest that the peel force depends on the applied velocity . using this form of peel force leads to the decreasing nature of the magnitude of the pull force as a function of applied velocity . for certain values of the inertia",
    ", we find canard type solutions .",
    "these numerical results are captured to a reasonable accuracy using a set of approximations valid in different regimes of the parameter space .",
    "even though , our emphasis is on demonstrating the correctness of these equations of motion and richness of the inherent dynamics that capture the qualitative features of the peeling process , we also attempt to make a comparison of the experimental results mentioned above to the extent possible .",
    "for the sake of completeness , we start by considering the geometry of the experimental setup shown schematically in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] . an adhesive roll of radius @xmath0 is mounted on an axis passing through @xmath1 normal to the paper and is pulled at a constant velocity @xmath2 by a motor positioned at @xmath3 with a force @xmath4 acting along @xmath5 .",
    "let the distance between @xmath1 and @xmath3 be @xmath6 , and that between the contact point @xmath7 to @xmath3 be @xmath8 .",
    "the point @xmath7 moves with a local velocity @xmath9 which can undergo rapid bursts in the velocity during rupture .",
    "the force required to peel the tape is usually called the force of adhesion denoted by @xmath10 .",
    "the two measured branches referred to earlier , are those of the function @xmath10 in a steady state situation of constant pulling velocity ( i.e. , there are no accelerations ) .",
    "the line @xmath8 makes an angle @xmath11 with the tangent at the contact point @xmath7 .",
    "the point @xmath7 subtends an angle @xmath12 at @xmath1 , with the horizontal line @xmath13 .",
    "we denote the elastic constant of the adhesive tape by @xmath14 , the elastic displacement of the tape by @xmath15 , the angular velocity by @xmath16 and the moment of inertia of the roll by @xmath17 .",
    "the angular velocity itself is identified by @xmath18 .",
    "the geometry of the setup gives @xmath19 and @xmath20 which further gives , @xmath21 .",
    "the total velocity @xmath2 at @xmath22 is then made up of three contributions  @xcite , given by @xmath23 which gives @xmath24 following standard methods in mechanics , it is straightforward to derive the equations of motion for @xmath12 and @xmath16 by considering @xmath25 as the generalized co - ordinates .",
    "the corresponding lagrangian of the system can be written as @xmath26 ^ 2 - { k\\over2}u^2 .",
    "\\label{lagran}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] we write the dissipation function as @xmath27 where @xmath28 physically represents the peel force which we assume is dependent on rupture speed as well as the pull speed assumed to be derivable from a potential function @xmath29 .",
    "the physical origin of this is due to the competition between the internal relaxation time scale of the viscoelastic fluid and the time scale determined by the applied velocity  @xcite .",
    "when the applied velocity is low , there is sufficient time for the viscoelastic fluid to relax .",
    "as we increase the applied velocity , the relaxation of the fluid gets increasingly difficult and thus behaves much like an elastic substance .",
    "the effect of competing time scales is well represented by deborah number  @xcite which is the ratio of time scale for structural relaxation to the characteristic time scale for deformation . indeed , in the studies on hele - shaw cell with mud as the viscous fluid",
    ", one observes a transition from viscous fingering to viscoelastic fracturing  @xcite with increasing rate of invasion of the displacing fluid .    as stated in the introduction",
    ", the existing models do not explain the decreasing amplitude of pull force .",
    "similar feature observed in the plc serrations has been modeled using a scheme referred to as dynamization of the negative strain rate sensitivity ( srs ) of the flow stress @xmath30  @xcite , where @xmath31 is the plastic strain rate .",
    "based on arguments similar to the preceding paragraph , they modify this function to depend on the applied strain rate , @xmath32 , i.e. , the negative srs of the flow stress is taken to be @xmath33 such that the gap between the maximum and the minimum of the function @xmath34 decreases with increasing @xmath32 . following this , we consider @xmath10 to depend on @xmath2 also , in a way that the gap in @xmath10 decreases as a function of the pull speed @xmath2 ( fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ) .    using the lagrange equations of motion , @xmath35 we obtain the same set of ordinary differential equations as in ref .",

    "this point is stable for @xmath42 and unstable for @xmath43 . as @xmath2 is varied such that the sign of @xmath44 changes from negative to positive value , the system undergoes a hopf bifurcation and a limit cycle appears .",
    "the limit cycles reflect the abrupt jumps between the two positive slope branches of the function @xmath28 .",
    "the singular nature of these equations becomes clear if one were to consider the differential form of eq .",

    "for the point @xmath99 , we have used the initial condition @xmath234 and integrating eq .",
    "( [ approxvdot ] ) and eq .",
    "( [ approxalpha ] ) ( or the sinusoidal form of @xmath12 ) from @xmath235 to @xmath236 gives @xmath237 .",
    "this is nearly the value 0.114 obtained from the exact numerical integration .",
    "this gives @xmath238 and @xmath239 which compares very well with the exact numerical value .",
    "in addition , the growth form of @xmath9 obtained from this approximation ( continuous line ) agrees very well with that of the exact numerical solution ( dotted line ) as shown in fig .",
    "the discrepancy seen in the figure can be reduced for instance if we include the terms neglected in eq .",
    "( [ genalpha1 ] ) such as @xmath240 and using @xmath241 in eq .",
    "( [ fullvdot ] ) .",
    "now we come to the crucial question",
    ". how does the system know that it has to go from @xmath99 to @xmath100 , while just during the previous visit to the point @xmath14 on @xmath81 branch lead only to a small increase in @xmath94 [ fig . [",
    "fig4](a ) and [ fig4](c ) ] before jumping to @xmath82 ? to understand this , we recall that on @xmath81 , a sinusoidal solution is allowed .",
    "first , one can notice a few differences in the initial conditions between the point @xmath99 and @xmath14 .",
    "for the point @xmath14 , the initial conditions taken from the exact numerical solution are @xmath242 and @xmath243 .",
    "( @xmath244 ) , while for the point @xmath99 , @xmath245 .",
    "however , for @xmath12 to begin a sinusoidal form , the initial value of @xmath246 is much higher than the natural slope .",
    "the local slope for any sinusoidal form is maximum when the variable is close to zero . in fig .",
    "[ fig4](b ) , the sinusoidal form starts when @xmath12 is close to zero ( @xmath247 at @xmath99 ) where the local slope should be close to the maximum value . near @xmath248 , the local slope is the product of the maximum amplitude of @xmath12 , say , @xmath249 ( in the sinusoidal stretch @xmath101 ) and @xmath250 .",
    "( we have assumed @xmath251 by dropping the phase factor . )",
    "thus , one should have @xmath252 when @xmath248 . using the value @xmath253 from exact numerical solution and @xmath254 at @xmath255",
    ", we find that @xmath256 near @xmath248 . indeed",
    ", this is satisfied only at @xmath99 where @xmath257 .",
    "[ note that @xmath12 is not symmetric around zero due to the presence of @xmath9 in eq .",
    "( [ flow1 ] ) which has been ignored for the purpose of present discussion .",
    "] however , @xmath258 at @xmath14 is significantly higher than the slope permitted for @xmath12 to start a sinusoidal sojourn .",
    "this forces the orbit to make one more small loop ( @xmath81 to @xmath82 and back ) so that the initial value of @xmath180 is commensurate for @xmath12 to start a sinusoidal form .",
    "indeed , the initial values of @xmath212 at all the earlier visits to @xmath81 branch keep decreasing until it reaches a value that is consistent to begin the sinusoidal growth . once this is satisfied ,",
    "the monotonic increasing behavior from @xmath99 to @xmath100 is seen . as we will show this is the mechanism operating for high @xmath17 and @xmath2 case .",
    "+    * case iii , high @xmath17 and @xmath2 *    for this case , even on the @xmath81 branch , @xmath162 can not be ignored in eq .",
    "( [ genalpha ] ) and thus one needs to use coupled eqs .",
    "( [ approxvdot ] ) and ( [ genalpha ] ) .",
    "calculations follow much the same lines and give correct values for @xmath194 and @xmath94 on both the branches during the rapid jumps .    again",
    ", we need to answer when exactly does the system know to switch from a rapid jumping mode to monotonically increasing on @xmath81 or decreasing mode on @xmath82 ?    consider the last of the rapid jumps from @xmath82 to @xmath81 ( just prior to the point @xmath99 ) in fig . [",
    "fig5](c ) .",
    "the corresponding point in the @xmath12 plot [ fig .",
    "[ fig5](b ) ] is shown on an expanded scale in the inset . from this figure , it is clear that @xmath207 has a positive slope at @xmath14 , though of small magnitude while at @xmath99 , it has a value -9.7 .",
    "the latter is close to the natural ( negative ) slope of @xmath12 when it begins the descending branch of the sinusoidal form . on the other hand ,",
    "the slope of @xmath12 is positive at @xmath14 and hence will not allow the growth to change over from a jumping mode to the sinusoidal growth form for @xmath12 .",
    "one can note that the slopes at points of all the earlier visits to ab [ see fig .",
    "[ fig5](b ) inset ] keep decreasing till the slope becomes negative required for the monotonically decreasing trend of @xmath12 .",
    "this is exactly the same mechanism for @xmath106 and @xmath67 also , for the low @xmath9 branch , except that in this case , even the sign of the slope is incompatible for all the points prior to @xmath99 in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] c. the mechanism operating on @xmath82 ( i.e. , at the switching from jumping mode to monotonically decreasing nature of @xmath4 ) is essentially the same but arguments are a little more involved and hence they are not presented .     with numerically exact solution ( dotted line ) for @xmath259 .",

    "this is dominant for @xmath87 , we illustrate this using fig . [ fig5](a ) and [ fig5](c ) .",
    "we first note that eq .",
    "( [ constr ] ) constrains the dynamically changing values of @xmath68 and @xmath66 to the stationary values of @xmath28 .",
    "clearly , this implies that @xmath260 . a rough estimate of @xmath61 can be obtained by @xmath261 with @xmath149 determined by @xmath262 .",
    "this relation can be easily verified by using the numerical values of @xmath12 .",
    "for instance , for @xmath87 and @xmath106 , @xmath263 and @xmath264 .",
    "this gives @xmath265 while the numerical value from the phase plot for this case gives @xmath266 which is very close .",
    "similarly , using @xmath267 and @xmath268 , we get @xmath269 which compares well with the numerical value of 180 .",
    "we have verified this relation is respected for various values of @xmath2 and @xmath17 . for small @xmath17 , @xmath12 is small , we should not find much difference between @xmath61 ( @xmath149 ) and that of @xmath10 .",
    "we first summarize the results before making some relevant remarks .",
    "we have carried out a study of the dynamics of an adhesive roller tape using a differential - algebraic scheme used for singular set of differential equations .",
    "the algorithm produces stick - slip jumps across the two dissipative branches as a consequence of the inherent dynamics .",
    "our extensive simulations show that the dynamics is much richer than anticipated earlier .",
    "in particular the influence of inertia is shown to be dramatic .",
    "for instance , even at low inertia , for small values of @xmath2 , the influence of inertia manifests with jumps of the orbit occurring even before @xmath4 reaches @xmath92 ( or @xmath93 ) which is quite unexpected .",
    "more dominant is its influence for high @xmath17 both for low @xmath2 and high @xmath2 , though it is striking for the latter case . following the reasoning used in the plc effect",
    ", we introduce a dynamized curve @xmath28 as resulting from competing time scales of internal relaxation and imposed pull speed .",
    "the modified peel force function leads to the decreasing trend in the magnitude of @xmath270 with increasing pull velocity , a feature observed in experiments .",
    "we have also recaptured the essential features of the dynamics by a set of approximations valid in different regimes of the parameter space .",
    "these approximate solutions illustrate the influence of various time scales such as that due to inertia , the elasticity of the tape and that determined by the stationary peel force @xmath28 .",
    "we also find the unusual canard type of solutions .    here , it is worthwhile to comment on the dynamical features of the model .",
    "the numerical results themselves are too complex to understand .",
    "a striking example of this is the series of force drops seen on the descending branch of the pull force [ fig .",
    "[ fig4](c ) ] .",
    "this result is hard to understand as it would amount to a partial relaxation of the pull force .",
    "however , a partial relaxation is only possible in the presence of another competing time scale ( other than the imposed time scale ) .",
    "another example is the jumping of the orbit for low @xmath17 case , from @xmath81 to @xmath271 and vice versa even before the pull force reaches the extremum values of @xmath28 .",
    "for this reason , we have undertaken to make this complex dynamics transparent using a set of approximations .",
    "the basic idea here is to solve a single equation ( or at most two equations as in the high @xmath17 and @xmath2 case ) which incorporates all the relevant time scales .",
    "this method not only captures all the results to within 10% error but it also clearly brings out the regimes of parameter space where these time scales become important .",
    "this analysis also shows that the time scale due to inertia of the roller tape shows up even for low @xmath17 which comes as a surprise as one expects that for low inertia , the orbit should stick to the stationary peel function .",
    "( recall that for low inertia , equations have been approximated by lienard type of equations by maugis and barquins @xcite . )",
    "our approximate equations demonstrate that a crucial role in inducing the jumps _ even at low inertia _ is played by the high frequency oscillations resulting from the inertia of the roller tape . as for high inertia ( both for low and high pull velocities ) , the time scale due to inertia is responsible for the partial relaxation of @xmath4 as shown",
    ".    a few comments may be in order on the bursting type of oscillations in the peel velocity .",
    "bursting type of oscillatory behavior are commonly seen in neuro - biological systems @xcite .",
    "conventionally , bursting type oscillations arise in the presence of homoclinic orbit  @xcite .",
    "such bursting type of oscillations have also been modeled using one dimensional map  @xcite .",
    "however , it is clear that the mechanism for bursting type of oscillations in our case is different . in our case",
    ", this arises due to the fact that the orbit is forced to jump between the stable manifolds as a result of competing time scale of inertia and the time scale for the evolution of @xmath9 .",
    "( we note that the latter itself includes more than one time scale [ see eq . ( [ approxvdot ] ) ] , namely the contribution from the slopes of the stable parts of the stationary curve @xmath28 and that due to elasticity of the tape . )",
    "the bunching of the spikes in @xmath9 is the result of @xmath28 becoming flat for large @xmath2 and @xmath17 .",
    "one other comment relates to canard type solutions .",
    "figure [ fig7 ] shows one such solution .",
    "as mentioned , these type solutions arise from sticking to the unstable manifold .",
    "in fact , a similar type of solution is seen in fig . [",
    "fig5](c ) .",
    "as noted earlier , all the jumps from @xmath82 to @xmath81 or vice versa always occur when the peel velocity reaches the limiting value where @xmath272 .",
    "however , it can be seen from this figure , the orbit starting from @xmath107 monotonically decreases well into the unstable part of @xmath10 .",
    "thus , this solution also has the features of canards .",
    "it must be stated that our approximate solutions can not capture the behavior of canards .    finally , the results presented in this paper are on the nature of dynamics of the model equations which so far had defied solution . however , comparison with experiments has been minimal largely due to the paucity of quantitative experimental findings as stated earlier .",
    "our analysis shows that the model predicts periodic , saw - tooth @xcite , as well as chaotic solutions as reported in @xcite .",
    "the high magnitude of the lyapunov exponents for the chaotic solutions in the low pull velocities is consistent with that reported earlier @xcite .",
    "we note that the other quantitative experimental feature reported by refs.@xcite is the decreasing trend of the average force drop magnitudes as a function of the pull velocity is also captured by our model ( fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] ) , a result that holds for both low and high inertia .",
    "this result is a direct consequence of the dynamization of the peel force function , i.e. , dependence of the peel force on the pull velocity .",
    "we note here that the complex dynamics at high velocities ( see fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] ) is a direct result of the unstable part of dynamized curve , @xmath28 , shrinking to zero . to the best of our knowledge ,",
    "this is first time the result in fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] has been explained .",
    "as the hypothesis of dynamization captures the decreasing trend of the force drops , it also suggests that the underlying mechanism of competing time scales responsible for the peel force depending on the pull velocity is likely to be correct as in the plc effect . clearly , a rigorous derivation of the peel force function from microscopic considerations that includes the effect of the viscoelastic glue at the contact point is needed to understand the dynamics appropriately .",
