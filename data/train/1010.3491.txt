    "the decomposition of fields into eigenmodes is a well established technique to solve various problems within physical sciences .",
    "the most prominent example is the schrdinger s equation within the field of quantum mechanics , where energy spectra of atoms are determined via the eigenvalue spectra and associated wavefunctions of the hamiltonian operator . indeed , electron orbits are eigenmodes of the energy , angular momentum , and spin operators  @xcite and as such they deliver fundamental insights into the physics of atoms . within classical mechanics , modes of vibration of music instruments",
    "give , for example , their resonant frequencies while their spectrum is associated with the shape of the instrument  @xcite . in the optical domain ,",
    "mode decomposition is used in order to describe light propagation within waveguides  @xcite , photonic crystals  @xcite , optical cavities  @xcite , laser resonators  @xcite , and the optical forces on mie - sized particles  @xcite . in the case of waveguides and photonic crystals , for example , eigenmodes describe electromagnetic fields that are invariant in their intensity profile as they propagate along the fibre or crystal .",
    "additionally , these modes are orthogonal and as such light coupled to one of these modes remains , in theory , in this mode forever .",
    "this optical mode decomposition can be expanded to include additional properties such as orbital and spin angular momentum  @xcite .",
    "all - together , the eigenmode expansion method is a well - established method for the representation of the propagation of optical fields .    in this paper",
    ", we report a novel method which we term `` optical eigenmodes ( oei ) '' which represents a generalization of the powerful concept of eigenmode decomposition going beyond the propagation properties of light .",
    "crucially , we show that eigenmode decomposition is applicable to the case of any quadratic measure which is defined as a function of the electromagnetic field . prominent examples of optical quadratic measures include the energy density and the energy flux of electromagnetic fields .",
    "the oei method makes it possible to describe an optical system and its response to incident electromagnetic fields as a simple mode coupling problem and to determine the optimal `` excitation '' for the given measure considered .",
    "intuitively , a superposition of initial fields is optimized in a manner that the minimum / maximum measure is achieved .",
    "for instance , the transmission through a pinhole is optimized by maximizing the energy flux through the pinhole  @xcite .    from a theoretical perspective , the oei optimization method is mathematically rigorous and may be distinguished from the multiple techniques currently employed ranging from genetic algorithms  @xcite and random search methods  @xcite to direct search methods  @xcite . the major challenge encountered in any such approximate optimization and engineering of optical properties",
    "is the fact that electromagnetic waves interfere .",
    "as such the interference pattern not only makes the search for an optimum beam problematic but crucially renders the superposition found unreliable , as the different algorithms may converge on different local minima which are unstable with respect to the different initial parameters of the problem .",
    "in contrast , our proposed oei method yields a unique solution to the problem and directly determines the optimum ( maximal / minimal ) measure possible .    in the first part of the paper , we introduce the oei method and",
    "show its properties in a general context of optimizing the quadratic measures of interfering waves .",
    "in the second part , we apply the oei formalism to minimize the focal spot size and discuss the appearance of superoscillating fields . for these applications , we describe , respectively , the electromagnetic field as a superposition of scalar laguerre - gaussian beams , vectorial bessel beams or more general plane waves within the angular spectral decomposition representation of light . in the third part of the paper , we report a particular experimental implementation of the oei method using computer controlled spatial light modulators to squeeze the spot size of a superposition of bessel beams . in the last part of the paper , the method is applied in numerical 3d modelling to determine the oei yielding the largest transmission through a sub - wavelength aperture and the largest optical force on a micrometer sized particle .",
    "the paper concludes with a discussion of the particular results obtained and with general comments on the versatility of the oei method to a wide range of problems .",
    "a short annex compares the convergence properties of the oei approach with standard phase front correction methods .",
    "the oei method exploits both the linearity of maxwell s equations and the quadratic dependence of light - matter interactions on the electromagnetic field @xmath0 where @xmath1 and @xmath2 denote the electric and magnetic field vectors , respectively .",
    "table  [ tab ] provides a list of common examples of such interactions .",
    "these interactions may be written in a general quadratic matrix form @xmath3 where we considered a superposition of fields @xmath4 and where @xmath5 labels the light - matter interaction defined in table  [ tab ] .",
    "the vectors @xmath6 and @xmath7 are comprised of the superposition coefficients @xmath8 and their complex conjugates , respectively .",

    "each of these eigenvectors corresponds to a superposition of fields @xmath11 termed here optical eigenmode ( oei ) .",
    "crucially , we may now extremize the light - matter interaction considered ; that is , the extremal eigenvalue @xmath17 and the associated eigenvectors @xmath18 deliver the superposition of fields @xmath19 which extremizes the interaction @xmath20 while keeping the total field contributions constant @xmath21 .    in this paper , we apply the oei concept to minimize the size of a laser spot within a surface roi .",
    "one way to define the spot size of a laser beam is by measuring ( whilst keeping the total intensity constant ) the second order moment @xmath22 of its intensity distribution  @xcite .",
    "crucially , @xmath22 can be expressed in terms of @xmath23 and @xmath24 ( see table  [ tab ] ) or the respective matrix representations as follows : @xmath25 where @xmath26 and @xmath27 are termed the _ intensity operator ( io ) _ and _ spot size operator ( sso ) _ , respectively . according to",

    "these scalar expressions are equivalent to the respective vector versions listed in table  [ tab ] and determined through equation  .",
    "the scalar version of the optimimum oei   explicitly reads @xmath43      using a superposition of lg beams we can minimize the size of a focal spot using the representation of the sso in cylindrical coordinates .",
    "it is important to note at this point that we only retain the intensity oeis whose eigenvalues are within a chosen fraction of total intensity .",
    "this is equivalent to considering only beams that have a significant intensity contribution in the roi .",
    "intuitively , the optimization procedure may perform so well that a spot of size zero is finally obtained if no intensity threshold is applied .",
    "figure  [ fig3 ] shows the smallest spot superposition where we observe the appearance of sidebands just outside the roi .",
    "these sidebands are a secondary effect of squeezing the light below its diffraction limit .",
    "it is these sidebands that decrease the efficiency of the squeezed spot with respect to the maximal possible intensity in the roi as calculated via the io . using the ratio between these two intensities we can define the intensity strehl ratio  @xcite for the sso ( see fig .  [",
    "we remark that both , the spot size and the strehl ratio , show resonances as a function of the roi size .",
