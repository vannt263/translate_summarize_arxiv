    "history of cyclic homology started in the early eighties of the last century .",
    "the seminal works of the pioneers a connes , b tsygan , d quillen and j - l loday were motivated by looking for non - commutative generalizations of de rham cohomology on one hand , and lie algebra homology of matrices on the other hand .    in the subsequent decades cyclic homology has been extensively studied and became an important tool in diverse areas of mathematics , such as homological algebra , algebraic topology , lie algebras , algebraic k - theory and so non - commutative differential geometry .",
    "thus by most various motivations , lots of examples have been constructed . in order to study general features of the examples , and also to be able to construct new ones , it was desirable to find a unifying general description .",
    "a fundamental first step in this direction was made by a kaygun in @xcite , who gave a construction of para-(co)cyclic objects in symmetric monoidal categories in terms of ( co)monoids . in particular , in this way he managed to describe in a universal form all examples arising from hopf cyclic theory ( upto cyclic duality , cf .",
    "@xcite ) . motivated by a generalization to bialgebroids ( over non - commutative rings , in which case",
    "the underlying bimodule categories are not symmetric ) , in @xcite we made a further step of generalization and constructed para-(co)cyclic objects in arbitrary categories , in terms of ( co)monads .",
    "kaygun s construction can be recovered as a particular case when the ( co)monads in question are induced by ( co)monoids .",
    "mean examples of kaygun s construction are induced by algebras over a commutative ring . by analogy , in this paper we show that appropriate monad morphisms ( which are ` locally braided ' in a sense to be described ) induce examples of para - cocyclic objects in @xcite .    the paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec : bimod ] we recall some facts about monads and _ bd_-laws that are used in the paper . in section [ sec : construction ] we introduce the notion of a _ locally braid preserving morphism _ of monads , generalizing a homomorphism of algebras , and we investigate their basic properties that are needed to state and prove our main result . in section [ sec : main ] we show that any such morphism determines an ` admissible septuple ' in the sense of @xcite , hence can be used to construct para - cocyclic objects . here",
    "we also illustrate how this construction works in the example of a morphism of algebras in a braided monoidal category ( i.e. when there is a _ global _ braiding ) .",
    "particular examples will be provided by appropriate homomorphisms of ( co)module algebras of a ( co)quasitriangular hopf algebra",
