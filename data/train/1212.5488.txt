    "the triangular lattice ising antiferromagnet ( tlia ) with the spin 1/2 is well known to display no long - range ordering down to zero temperature  @xcite where the spin - correlation function decays as power - law  @xcite . on the other hand , in the ground state a long - range order with the partially ordered structure , characterized by two sublattices of opposite magnetizations and one sublattice of zero magnetization , can occur if the spin is larger than some critical value  @xcite .",
    "the upper bound of this critical value was estimated by the use of peierls argument  @xcite as 62 and the precise value was established by monte carlo simulations  @xcite as 11/2 .",
    "the emergence of the long - range order was argued to arise as a result of a drastic change in the ground - state degeneracy as well as some other physical quantities of this frustrated spin system with the increasing spin magnitude .",
    "nevertheless , the large degeneracy can be lifted by some perturbations , such as an external magnetic field  @xcite or selective dilution  @xcite , which have been shown to lead to long - range ordering even in the highly frustrated spin-1/2 system . for ising models with spin larger that 1/2 a single - ion anisotropy is another parameter that may play a crucial role in their critical properties ( see , e.g. ,  @xcite ) .    in the present paper",
    "we show that this is also the case for the current model and demonstrate how the inclusion of the single - ion anisotropy can change the above scenario .",
    "we show that even a small amount of the single - ion anisotropy leads to a partially ordered phase at low temperatures , while different critical phase of the berezinsky - kosterlitz - thouless ( bkt ) type  @xcite , characterized by a power - law decay of the spin correlation function , persists at higher temperatures .",
    "we consider the ising model described by the hamiltonian @xmath0 where @xmath1 is an ising spin on the @xmath2th lattice site , @xmath3 denotes the sum over nearest neighbors , @xmath4 is the antiferromagnetic exchange interaction parameter , and @xmath5 is the single - ion anisotropy parameter .",
    "we perform standard monte carlo ( mc ) simulations following the metropolis dynamics .",
    "we simulate the triangular lattice spin systems of the linear size @xmath6 and apply the periodic boundary conditions . for thermal averaging",
    "we typically consider @xmath7 mcs ( monte carlo sweeps or steps per spin ) after discarding another @xmath8 mcs for thermalization . in order to obtain dependencies of various thermodynamic quantities on the reduced temperature @xmath9 ,",
    "we use @xmath10 and start simulations from high temperatures with random initialization .",
    "then the temperature is gradually lowered with the step @xmath11 and the simulations start from the final configuration obtained at the previous temperature . in order to estimate the error bars , we run five simulations with different initializations . for finite - size scaling analysis ( fss ) , employed to identify different phases",
    ", we use the lattice sizes @xmath12 and @xmath13 .",
    "we calculate the following quantities .",
    "the sublattice magnetization of the sublattice x ( x = a , b and c ) is obtained as @xmath14 .",
    "then , for an antiferromagnet , as an order parameter it is useful to define the staggered magnetization per site as @xmath15 where @xmath16 denotes thermal average .",
    "further , from fluctuations of the above quantities we define the specific heat per site @xmath17 as @xmath18 and the staggered susceptibility per site @xmath19 as @xmath20    in the ground state the spin - correlation function of the tlia model decays as a power law  @xcite @xmath21 where the exponent @xmath22 has been shown to decrease with the spin value from @xmath23 for spin-1/2 to zero for spin larger than 11/2 , for which antiferromagnetic long - range order occurs  @xcite .",
    "the value of @xmath22 can be estimated by fss of the order parameter @xmath24 , which scales as  @xcite @xmath25 or the quantity  @xcite @xmath26\\big\\rangle / l^2,\\ ] ] which scales as @xmath27",
    "let us first examine the ground - state properties for different values of @xmath5 . for @xmath28 , the energetic arguments dictate that the ground - state configuration is such that the spins on each elementary triangular plaquette sum to @xmath29 .",
    "all such plaquettes are energetically equivalent with the energy per spin @xmath30 and there is no long - range order among them .",
    "it is easy to verify that for @xmath31 the preferred configurations are such that the spins on each elementary triangular plaquette again sum to @xmath29 but zero spin states are not involved .",
    "then the energy per spin is @xmath32 and the system behaves like a spin-1/2 ising model with no long - range order  @xcite . if @xmath33 the configurations with the spin @xmath34 states on one sublattice are suppressed and the partially ordered phase with the antiferromagnetic ordering on two sublattices and non - magnetic states of the third sublattice , i.e. , the @xmath35 states , can occur .",
    "such configurations are characterized by the energy per spin @xmath36 . however , for @xmath37 the energy becomes positive and therefore the non - magnetic state with all spins taking zero value is the ground state .",
    "therefore , the partial long - range order can only be expected within @xmath38 .    in order to confront the behavior of the system with no single - ion anisotropy , which is expected to show only the bkt phase transition  @xcite , with the long - range order behavior predicted to appear within the range @xmath38 , in fig .",
    "[ fig : xxx - t_l48 ] we plot the temperature dependencies of some relevant thermodynamic quantities for two values of @xmath39 and @xmath40 , representing the two cases .",
    "the behavior for @xmath39 is clearly different from that observed for @xmath41 .",
    "while the former shows only one anomaly at higher temperatures , the latter displays an additional anomaly at lower temperatures . in particular , as observed in the behaviors of the sublattice magnetizations and the staggered magnetization ( order parameter ) , presented in figs .",
    "[ fig : mi - t_l48 ] and  [ fig : ms - t_l48 ] , respectively , in both cases some degree of ordering is initiated in two sublattices at higher temperatures . however , unlike the case with no anisotropy , for @xmath41 this initial increase in the quantities @xmath42 , @xmath43 and @xmath24 is followed by another increase to the fully saturated values at lower temperatures .",
    "as the temperature is lowered , one and two anomalies are also observed in the behavior of the internal energy , tending to the expected ground - state values of @xmath44 and @xmath45 , for the cases of @xmath39 and @xmath41 , respectively ( fig .",
    "[ fig : e - t_l48 ] ) .",
    "the anomalies in the staggered magnetization and the internal energy are reflected in the corresponding number of peaks in the staggered susceptibility and the specific heat , shown in figs .",
    "[ fig : xis - t_l48 ] and  [ fig : c - t_l48 ] , respectively .",
    "+   +    the above anomalies in the thermodynamic quantities suggest occurrence of transitions between different phases . to identify the respective phases , we employ fss analyses of the order parameter @xmath24 and the quantity @xmath46 , defined by the relations  ( [ ms_fss ] ) and  ( [ y_fss ] ) , respectively .",
    "temperature variation of the scaling exponent @xmath22 is presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : eta - t_l48_d0 ] .",
    "the value of @xmath47 , observed for @xmath41 , means that the system displays at sufficiently low temperatures ( below @xmath48 ) long - range order  @xcite . on the other hand , for @xmath39 ,",
    "the value of @xmath22 remains finite and in the low temperature region levels off at the value of @xmath49 , in agreement with the previous ground - state investigations  @xcite .",
    ", for @xmath41 and @xmath50 .",
    "the symbols and the error bars respectively represent the mean and the extreme values obtained from eqs .",
    "( [ ms_fss ] ) and  ( [ y_fss ] ) . ]    finally , we found it interesting to look into the system s behavior also at microscopic level .",
    "more specifically , we studied the snapshots of spin configurations at different temperatures both visually and quantitatively . for the latter we introduced the quantity , which we termed density of local patterns @xmath51 , which is defined as a relative number of different spin patterns @xmath52 , @xmath53  . ] , on the elementary triangular plaquettes observed in the simulated states .",
    "the temperature variations of @xmath51 for different values of the single - ion anisotropy strength are shown in figs .",
    "[ fig : dos - t_l48_d+1]-[fig : dos - t_l48_d-1 ] , with all the patterns @xmath54 listed in fig .",
    "[ fig : dos - t_l48_d+1 ] .",
    "the snapshots of the respective spin configurations in the ground state are also presented in figs .",
    "[ fig : snap_t0_d+1_l24]-[fig : snap_t0_d-1_l24 ]  . ] . for comparison",
    "we also included the case with positive value of @xmath55 .",
    "for @xmath55 , the degenerate spin patterns which sum to @xmath29 and include no zeros , i.e. , @xmath56 , are equally represented and , in accordance with the above ground - state arguments , for @xmath57 are the only ones present in the system . on the other hand , for @xmath41 ,",
    "due to broken symmetry the system in the partially ordered phase chooses one the two configurations involving either the set of patterns @xmath58 or @xmath59 . again , in agreement with the ground - state arguments , for @xmath57 the patterns of either set are equally represented and there are no other patterns in the system . in between the two phases for @xmath39 , the patterns @xmath56 and @xmath60 mix together since they contribute with the same energy . however , as evidenced from both figs .",
    "[ fig : dos - t_l48_d0 ] and  [ fig : snap_t0_d0_l24 ] , they do not appear with the same probabilities .",
    "namely , the patterns @xmath56 systematically prevail in all the simulations started from various initial states and in the ground state they are almost @xmath61-times more represented than the patterns @xmath60 .",
    "this can be understood by looking at larger patterns , namely , hexagonal ones formed by a central spin and its six nearest neighbors .",
    "then , only in the patterns with the so called `` free '' central spins ( i.e. , the spins with the nearest neighbors of alternating signs ) the state of the central spins is irrelevant with the respect to the energy and , therefore , the states @xmath62 , @xmath40 and @xmath50 are equally probable . therefore , the number of the triangular patterns @xmath60 is proportional to the number of the hexagonal patterns with the `` free '' central spins in the configurations such as the one shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : snap_t0_d+1_l24 ] , noting that the zero - state central spin generates six triangles with the patterns @xmath60 .",
    "we studied the geometrically frustrated spin-1 triangular ising antiferromagnet in the presence of a single - ion anisotropy .",
    "we showed that within the range of negative values of the anisotropy parameter @xmath63 the system displays a partial long - range order in the low - temperature region and another phase with algebraically decaying correlation function at higher temperatures .",
    "for @xmath64 the system is in a non - magnetic state and for @xmath65 it behaves like a spin-1/2 model , with no long - range ordering due to frustration .",
    "the ground - state phase transition at @xmath66 is characterized by the coexistence of the energetically equivalent patterns of the types @xmath67 and @xmath68 at a constant ratio of approximately @xmath69 .",
