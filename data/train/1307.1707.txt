    "the fermi - hubbard model in the honeycomb lattice , especially its ground - state phase diagram , has attracted much interest in recent years .",
    "this is in part motivated by the advent of graphene,@xcite whose semimetallic properties can be understood within the weakly interacting regime of this model .",
    "it is also motivated by results of large - scale quantum monte carlo ( qmc ) calculations by meng _ et al._,@xcite which suggested that a spin liquid phase exists in that model at intermediate interaction strengths , despite the absence of frustration .",
    "following those results , a considerable number of studies have been done on the hubbard model as well as in closely related models in the honeycomb geometry.@xcite however , qmc simulations of very large systems,@xcite and the use of accurate approaches to estimate the antiferromagnetic ( af ) order parameter,@xcite have indicated that the existence of a spin liquid in such a model is unlikely .",
    "a remarkable property of the fermi - hubbard model in the honeycomb lattice at half filling is the existence of a quantum phase transition to a mott insulator at a finite interaction strength . insulating behavior in this case",
    "is accompanied by the emergence of long - range af correlations at zero temperature , as unveiled in qmc simulations.@xcite this phase transition has also been examined by means of dynamical mean - field theory and its cluster extensions,@xcite as well as within the coherent phase approximation.@xcite other studies of this and closely related models have explored the existence of pairing and superconductivity away from half filling.@xcite    a new front for studying the properties of the fermi - hubbard model in the honeycomb lattice has been recently opened by the ( almost ideal ) experimental realization of this model by : ( i ) building artificial graphene and loading it with a two - dimensional electron gas,@xcite ( ii ) trapping ultracold atoms in highly tunable optical lattices with that geometry,@xcite and ( iii ) creating molecular graphene in a fully tunable condensed - matter set up.@xcite these experiments follow extensive research on simulating the hubbard model on cubic geometries using ultracold gases,@xcite aimed at answering fundamental questions surrounding hubbard models , such as whether they support superconductivity .    in a recent letter,@xcite we utilized two state - of - the - art computational methods , a numerical linked - cluster expansion ( nlce ) and determinantal quantum monte carlo ( dqmc ) , to study thermodynamic properties and spin correlations of interacting fermions in the honeycomb lattice , as described by the fermi - hubbard model .",
    "our emphasis was in the half - filled case for which we found that , in comparison to the square lattice , the honeycomb lattice exhibits a more significant region of anomalous rise in the double occupancy at low temperature , leading to a more efficient adiabatic cooling .",
    "we also showed that nearest - neighbor ( nn ) spin correlations are stronger in the honeycomb lattice than in the square lattice for a wide range of interaction strengths and for an extended region of experimentally relevant entropies .",
    "this was found to be true even in the weakly - interacting regime , where the former has a semimetallic ground state while the latter has an af mott insulating one .    in this work ,",
    "we extend the analysis presented in ref .   by studying other quantities of much interest , such as the entropy , the specific heat , uniform and staggered spin susceptibilities , and the structure factor .",
    "we establish a connection between the temperature at which the nearest neighbor ( nn ) spin correlations change most rapidly and the onset of exponentially long af correlations in the system .",
    "more importantly , we explore in detail the behavior of some of those quantities , and of quantities studied in ref .  , away from half filling . in particular , we analyze how the double occupancy , which can be accurately measured in ultracold gases experiments,@xcite evolves as a function of temperature at different densities .",
    "isentropic curves for the temperature as a function of the interaction strength away from half filling are also presented . finally , employing a local density approximation ( lda ) , we analyze the possibility of achieving adiabatic cooling by increasing the strength of the interaction between trapped fermions in optical lattice experiments . we show that in the presence of a harmonic trap , even starting with relatively high entropies , it is possible to create mott insulating regions with exponentially long antiferromagnetic correlations by using this approach .",

    "the most recent dqmc studies of the phase diagram of this model in the honeycomb geometry indicate that there are two ground - state phases , a semimetallic one at weak coupling and an af mott insulating one at strong coupling , with a continuous phase transition between them that occurs at @xmath9.@xcite      in this work , we use two fundamentally different unbiased numerical methods , a nlce@xcite and dqmc,@xcite to study the thermodynamic properties of hamiltonian in the honeycomb lattice .    in nlces , any extensive property of a lattice model per site @xmath10 (",

    "the computational effort is reduced by identifying all clusters that have the same hamiltonian ( same topology ) , and diagonalizing only one of them.@xcite in table i , we report the total number of topologically distinct clusters ( second column ) that are diagonalized in each order of the nlce ( first column ) .",
    "the number of topological clusters should be compared to the much larger number of added lattice constants at each order of the expansion ( third column ) .",

    "however , even if the bare sums diverge , one can accelerate the convergence of nlces at lower temperatures by using resummation algorithms . here , we carry out the calculations up to the ninth order in the site expansion and employ wynn and euler resummation techniques@xcite to improve the convergence at low temperatures .",
    "our calculations are performed in the grand - canonical ensemble,@xcite and we compute all observables for a wide range ( and dense grid ) of chemical potentials , @xmath20 , and temperatures , @xmath21 . note that we can make the grid for @xmath20 and @xmath21 arbitrarily fine without much computational overhead since , for a given @xmath22 , everything needed to compute the observables is generated in a single run of the exact diagonalization .",
    "this allows us to accurately compute the equation of state so that all quantities can also be studied at any desired constant density .    within dqmc,@xcite",
    "the partition function is expressed as a path integral by using the suzuki - trotter decomposition of @xmath23 , where @xmath24 with @xmath25 the boltzmann constant , after discretizing the imaginary time .",
    "this introduces an imaginary - time interval @xmath26 that we set to @xmath27 .",
    "the interaction term is decoupled through a discrete hubbard - stratonovich transformation,@xcite which introduces an auxiliary ising field .",
    "one can then integrate the fermionic degrees of freedom analytically , and the summation over the auxiliary field ( which depends both on the site and the imaginary time ) is carried out stochastically using a monte carlo algorithm .",
    "most of our results are for 96 sites for the honeycomb lattice and 100 sites for the square lattice geometry , though in some cases , other system sizes ( namely 24 , 54 , 150 , and 216 sites ) were studied for the honeycomb lattice to analyze finite - size effects .",
    "as it will become apparent in the following , from comparisons to the nlce , the systematic errors in dqmc are mostly negligible for our parameters of interest .",
    "as shown in previous studies,@xcite the two approaches are complementary .",
    "for the half - filled system with weak interactions ( in comparison to the bandwidth ) , dqmc can access lower temperatures than nlce .",
    "this can be understood from the fact that the computational cost of the former method increases almost linearly with inverse temperature , whereas the exponential growth of correlations in the model by decreasing the temperature limits the region of convergence of nlce . on the other hand , for strong interactions , while dqmc runs into statistical difficulties when sampling the auxiliary fields , the convergence of nlce extends to lower temperatures .",
    "this is because in the strong - coupling regime of the half - filled system , the relevant energy scale at low temperatures is that of the spin degrees of freedom , namely , the exchange interaction @xmath28 , which sets the characteristic temperature for the onset of the exponential growth of af correlations .",
    "this scale decreases as the interaction strength increases and nlces can follow it without running into computational difficulties .",
    "away from half filling , dqmc is limited to higher temperatures in comparison to half filling due to the so - called fermion ` sign problem ' .",
    "@xcite we find that in nlces , despite the lack of sign problem , the lowest temperature at which the series converge for our observables of interest also generally increases as the system is doped away from half filling .",
    "this seems to be a consequence of the emergence of competing correlations at higher temperatures .",
    "in the grand - canonical ensemble , the entropy ( per site ) can be written as @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the operator for the total number of particles . within nlces ,",
    "all the extensive quantities in the right - hand side of eq .   can be computed ( per site ) directly in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "this is not the case within dqmc .",
    "the calculation of the entropy in the latter approach , for finite clusters , is done by integrating the energy@xcite @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the high - temperature limit of the entropy for a given density @xmath33 ; @xmath34 . throughout the paper ,",
    "the entropy is given in units of @xmath25 .",
    "since we present results for two different lattice geometries , we have chosen the unit of energy to be the noninteracting bandwidth , @xmath35 , which is @xmath36 for the honeycomb lattice and @xmath37 for the square lattice .     for @xmath38 , @xmath39 , @xmath40 , and @xmath41 at half filling .",
    "the nlce results were obtained by applying euler s resummation to the last six terms in each order of the expansion.@xcite here we report results for the last order ( thick lines ) and the next to last order ( thin black lines ) .",
    "we also show nlce results for the entropy of the antiferromagnetic heisenberg model ( afhm ) for @xmath42 .",
    "the site expansion for this model was carried out up to the seventeenth order .",
    "the results in this case were obtained using wynn s algorithm and we report those for the highest term after eight ( thick line ) and seven ( thin black line ) orders of improvement.@xcite unless otherwise specified , all nlce results reported in the following for the honeycomb lattice are obtained as explained above and are presented using the same convention .",

    "[ fig : s_cv_vs_t ] , we show the entropy of the honeycomb lattice as a function of temperature at half filling and for different values of @xmath22 from nlce ( lines ) and dqmc ( symbols ) .",
    "as anticipated , we find that nlce results converge to lower temperature as @xmath22 increases . for the largest value of @xmath22 shown ( @xmath44 ) , the convergence is extended to around @xmath45 .",
    "figure  [ fig : s_cv_vs_t ] shows that , for the two smallest values of @xmath22 ( @xmath38 and 1 ) , the results from the two methods agree very well down to the lowest convergence temperature in the nlce . on the other hand ,",
    "small deviations between the results from nlce and dqmc become apparent for larger values of @xmath22 and low temperature , e.g. , dqmc slightly underestimates the entropy for @xmath46 for @xmath47 .    as expected , and similarly to previous results for the square lattice,@xcite the entropy shows different behavior in the weak- and strong - coupling regimes .",
    "while in the former it decreases steadily from @xmath48 to @xmath49 when lowering the temperature , in the latter , a plateau develops at intermediate temperatures ( @xmath50 ) .",
    "the plateau becomes visible with increasing @xmath22 .",
    "this can be explained as follows : when @xmath22 ( and consequently the cost of double occupancy ) increases the charge degrees of freedom freeze out at increasingly high temperatures .",
    "once they are frozen , the system at lower temperatures can be described by an effective heisenberg model ( with @xmath51 ) , whose high - temperature entropy ( @xmath52 ) agrees with the entropy at the plateau of the hubbard model . as @xmath22 increases , @xmath53 decreases and the low temperature regime of the effective heisenberg model moves to lower temperatures .",
    "this results in a larger plateau with increasing @xmath22 . to make those points apparent , in fig .",
    "[ fig : s_cv_vs_t ] we also show the entropy of the af heisenberg model in the honeycomb lattice with @xmath42 , which closely follows the results of the hubbard model with @xmath44 at @xmath54 .",
    "nlce results for the entropy away from half filling are presented in the inset in fig .",
    "[ fig : s_cv_vs_t ] .",
    "those results were obtained for @xmath43 , the same four values of @xmath22 depicted in the main panel , and for a wide range of local fillings ( @xmath55 ) . in the weakly - interacting regime ( e.g. , @xmath38 ) , as the density increases , the entropy increases monotonically first and then saturates at a finite value when @xmath56 .",
    "this is because the system behaves similarly to a non - interacting system at this temperature : as @xmath57 , the number of microstates increases and therefore the entropy increases .",
    "however , as correlations become significant by increasing @xmath22 , the entropy decreases dramatically as the density approaches half filling due to the formation and ordering of local moments .",
    "this is accompanied by the appearance of a peak in the entropy at @xmath58 , which resembles the one appearing for the same model in the square lattice.@xcite the high entropy around that filling at low temperature signals the presence of many low - energy competing states , which , upon further cooling , could result in the emergence of exotic phases such as superconductivity .",
    "the specific heat ( per site ) is defined as @xmath59 , \\label{eq : heat}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the second expression is more amenable for evaluation in the grand - canonical ensemble . however , in order to avoid numerical derivatives and eliminate the systematic errors they introduce , we rewrite eq .   using maxwell equations as@xcite @xmath60,\\ ] ] where @xmath61 and @xmath62 .",
    "all expectation values in eq .   can be directly evaluated in nlces .    within dqmc , obtaining @xmath63 from eq .",
    "requires the calculation of expectation values of products of up to eight fermion operators .",
    "while this is possible in principle , it would lead to large statistical fluctuations in the results , which are costly to reduce .",

    "the nlce results in the square geometry were previously reported in ref .  , while early dqmc results in the square and honeycomb geometries ( admittedly less accurate than those reported here ) can be found in refs .   and , respectively .",
    "the complementarity of nlce and dqmc is once again clear from these plots for both lattice geometries .",
    "for weak interactions ( e.g. , @xmath38 ) , dqmc and nlce results are in good agreement with each other down to the temperatures at which nlce converges . however , dqmc can also access the very low - temperature regime that is not accessible to nlce .",
    "because of this , dqmc can resolve the double - peak structure that is present in the square lattice for @xmath8 , which is the result of the mott insulating ground state with long - range af order that occurs for any nonzero value of @xmath22 .",
    "such a structure is absent in the honeycomb lattice in the weakly interacting regime , where the ground state of the system lacks long - range af order.@xcite    for values of the interaction strength of the order of the bandwidth , we do find small deviations between nlce and dqmc results at intermediate to low temperatures ( @xmath67 for both geometries ) , as ( mainly ) systematic errors due to the discretization of imaginary time start to affect the dqmc results .",
    "nevertheless , the relatively good agreement between the results from these two methods for @xmath68 , especially for the honeycomb geometry down to @xmath69 , indicates that systematic errors in dqmc are not playing an important role . for larger values of @xmath22 ( @xmath70 and 2 in fig .",
    "[ fig : cv_vs_t ] ) , nlce provides more accurate results down to lower temperatures .",
    "in particular , from the nlce data it becomes apparent that the position of the low - temperature peak moves to lower temperature ( proportional to @xmath71 ) as the interaction strength increases .",

    "@xmath73 is also @xmath22 dependent .",
    "these results are qualitatively similar to those obtained for the square lattice in ref .  , so that the features seen in @xmath72 and @xmath73 appear to be related to the onset of strong correlations in the system .",
