    "fascination with inhomogeneous superconducting ( sc ) phases extends back several decades , with many conferences and monographs having been devoted to the subject.@xcite for conventional superconductors , the inhomogeneities were extrinsic , arising from a granular nature of samples or due to the deliberate synthesis of disordered built materials or films . the high temperature superconductors ( hts ) introduced new aspects into this area of study .",
    "first , inhomogeneous states ( normal and sc ) seem to be intrinsic to hts , at least in the underdoped regime , similar to quenched disorder in the metal - insulator transition in two dimensions.@xcite secondly , the inhomogeneity occurs on a smaller length scale of just a few lattice constants as evidenced by scanning tunneling spectroscopy ( sts ) at the nanoscale.@xcite    in addition , the strong electronic correlation in hts cuprates plays a major role in the elucidation of the inhomogeneous sc state ; indeed the inhomogeneity is widely believed to arise from the strong intra - atomic interactions that tend to frustrate bandlike conduction , to induce local magnetic moments , and to drive charge and spin order on a few lattice constant scale .",
    "the study of the doped mott insulating phase has been one of the most active areas of theoretical study of hts , one that has proven to be unexpectedly complex and rich and which is still under intense exploration and debate .",
    "surprisingly , holes doped into the high temperature superconductors tend to arrange themselves non - uniformly in the cuo@xmath10 planes in the form of stripes , checkerboard or perhaps even more exotic structures.@xcite moreover , spatially varying density and spin structures have also been observed in the physics of the manganites @xcite and cobaltites.@xcite    a variety of physically relevant models such as the repulsive hubbard and t - j hamiltonians have been extensively studied to understand the interplay between spatial inhomogeneity , magnetism , and superconductivity.@xcite in the repulsive hubbard and t - j hamiltonians in particular , inhomogeneity has been introduced either through the hopping amplitude @xmath11 or magnetic coupling @xmath12 or the local energy on the lattice sites . for the @xmath13 square lattice these two models are known to display antiferromagnetism at half - filling , and , although it is less certain , perhaps also d - wave superconductivity when doped .",
    "there is considerable evidence that they also might possess inhomogeneous stripe or checkerboard ground states.@xcite .",
    "phenomenological d - wave bcs hamiltonians with spatially inhomogeneous pairing amplitude @xcite or lattice site energy @xcite have also been employed mostly to reproduce the local density of states ( ldos ) results obtained from scanning tunneling microscopy ( stm).@xcite in addition , there have been theoretical studies of the sc quantum phase fluctuations using the qed@xmath14 effective theory of the hts in relation with the inhomogeneous pattern formation in cuprates from the stm experimental results.@xcite    while dmrg treatments @xcite provide detailed information on the real space charge , spin , and pairing orders , the precise nature of the interplay , and whether the different orders compete or cooperate , remains unclear .",

    "tl - doped pbte achieves a critical temperature up to 1.5 k , and more extensive heat capacity and transport data@xcite have led to an analysis in terms of a `` charge kondo effect '' that could be linked to the observed superconductivity.@xcite this system intrinsically involves both negative u centers and inhomogeneity .",

    "all three inhomogeneous patterns exhibit a charge ordered insulating phase for large enough values of @xmath63 ( or the smallest value of @xmath63 for the checkerboard ) .",

    "similar to stripes , over the window of temperature studied in panel ( a ) , the gap in the dos initially grows up to @xmath177 and then gradually drops to zero slightly beyond @xmath178 to indicate the formation of a metallic phase as the temperature destroys superconductivity .",

    "[ anomaly.random.n0.5.f0.75 ] also shows significant variation of the local order parameter only on the interacting sites on average .",

    "panel ( c ) also confirms that the charge ordered phase is indeed destroyed by temperature allowing the non - interacting sites to become more occupied resulting in an intermediate sc phase .",
    "metallic behavior is established at sufficiently high temperature .",
    "it is also noteworthy that this anomalous increase in @xmath179 was not observed for the checkerboard pattern for which there is no superconductivity at any temperature when @xmath128 .",

    ", this leads to a pair localized in the interacting sites with empty nearest neighboring sites .",

    "[ patterns ] , panel(a ) ) .",
    "a similar increase in @xmath5 upon introducing a checkerboard pattern is found in the mcmf calculations as well , arising from the loss of long - range phase coherence .",

    "we have also independently confirmed that our conclusions and arguments equally apply for a model with nearest - neighbor attraction , leading to a @xmath180-wave sc close to half - filling , which reflects the cuprates phenomenology more truthfully.@xcite    we have found that upon introducing inhomogeneity into the pattern of interacting sites on a lattice .",
    "@xmath5 can be increased over a wide range of @xmath63 as long as @xmath181 even if @xmath182 .",
    "when @xmath167 , however , for sufficiently large @xmath63 , inhomogeneity acts against superconductivity and therefore @xmath7 becomes smaller compared to the uniform pattern of interacting sites .",
    "the case of @xmath128 is anomalous .",
    "the charge ordered phase established at large enough @xmath63 values at @xmath16 gradually vanishes as @xmath144 increases . @xmath183",
    "first increases with increasing t , leading to a sc phase ( at least for large enough @xmath3 values and lower symmetrical inhomogeneity patterns ) , and then vanishes , indicating a metallic state .",
    "in summary , we have shown that for the attractive hubbard model on a square lattice , there is a significant range of electron doping and interaction strength over which the average superconducting order parameter is larger for a lattice with inhomogeneous patterns of interacting sites than a uniform distribution of these interacting sites at a constant interaction strength per site .",
    "we have presented the phase diagrams for three different inhomogeneous patterns : checkerboard , stripes and random and also three different values for the concentration of the non - interacting sites .",
    "apart from a few particular features , the overall physics illustrated in the phase diagrams is pattern independent .",
    "as we vary the mean interaction strength @xmath63 and the doping level @xmath4 at zero temperature , we have verified the existence of at least three different phases , namely ( i ) superconducting , ( ii ) insulating due to the charge order phases , and ( iii ) metallic .",
    "our findings and claims are strongly supported by studying the behavior of a variety of quantities computed in this work all consistently corroborating one another .",
    "the enhancement of the average order parameter for the inhomogeneous interacting site patterns is due to the proximity effect , i.e. , the tunneling effect of the cooper pairs from the interacting sites leading to finite order parameter values on neighboring sites .",
    "this conclusion is supported by the effect occurring at weak coupling , where the coherence length is large , rather than in the strong coupling regime of preformed pairs .",
    "agreement between the bdg results and the mcmf calculations justifies the application and conclusions of the bdg approach within the small @xmath63 regime .",
    "our calculations also clearly confirm that an inhomogeneous interaction potential can lead to the increase in the phase transition temperature @xmath5 over a wide range of @xmath4 , and @xmath63 for various @xmath3 values .",
    "counterintuitively , as long as @xmath4 is less than or equal to twice the fraction of interacting sites , this increase in @xmath5 continues even for values of @xmath63 for which the order parameter is larger for the uniform pattern than for inhomogeneous patterns at @xmath16 .",
    "one possible explanation takes into account that in this weak coupling parameter regime , @xmath5 is a supralinearly increasing function of @xmath184 . in such a case , it may be that in the inhomogeneous system the sites with larger @xmath184 produce a nonlinear enhancement relative to @xmath7 of the uniform system and , through the proximity effect , drag the non - interacting sites along with them .",
    "this trend changes when @xmath4 exceeds twice the number of interacting sites ( i.e. some electrons must occupy non - interacting sites ) , for which at large enough @xmath63 values inhomogeneity fails to increase @xmath5 over that of the uniform pattern .",
    "the @xmath185 case for sufficiently large @xmath3 values and less symmetric inhomogeneous patterns ( such as stripes and random as opposed to the checkerboard ) is anomalous as it shows the enhancement of @xmath150 as temperature increases .",
    "it is even more surprising to find that a system which is non - superconducting ( charge ordered insulator ) at @xmath16 can become superconducting upon increasing @xmath144 for a finite window of temperature before turning metallic .",
    "this anomalous behavior was shown to be related to a crossover from a charge ordered insulating phase for @xmath128 at large enough @xmath63 values to an intermediate sc phase upon increasing @xmath144 before entering the metallic phase at sufficiently large @xmath144 .",
    "we wish to emphasize that in this article we have focused on the enhancement ( or not ) of the pairing amplitude ( our @xmath186 defined in section [ sec : formalism ] ) , rather than its product with the local interaction strength @xmath187 which is more directly related to the gap but contains less information , and gives less insight , because it automatically vanishes on any site without interaction .",
    "thermodynamic measurements would probe quantities which include the energy scale , such as the specific heat or superfluid rigidity which our results may not have direct implications to .",
    "however , for an inhomogeneous system being a mixture of different phases , defining an average sc gap is not trivial .",
    "thus , the thermodynamic properties of inhomogeneous superconductors will not necessary exhibit the same behavior as their homogeneous counterparts .",
    "it has been shown that the rise of the specific heat in inhomogeneous superconductors obeys a power law behavior as opposed to exponential in homogeneous ones using the attractive hubbard model with random interacting sites .",
    "@xcite also , the superfluid density and stiffness in general decrease due to the presence of disorder .",
    "@xcite nevertheless , lower superfluid density does not necessarily lead to lower @xmath5 as according to the anderson theorem , a non magnetic impurity should not affect the @xmath5 and therefore thermodynamic properties of a s - wave superconductor .",
    "we have presented clear evidence for the enhancement of @xmath5 which does have a direct experimental implication .",
    "thermodynamic properties of inhomogeneous superconductors are very rich in physics and a great deal of contributions and new ideas in this area are yet to appear .",
    "while the attractive hubbard hamiltonian obviously does not incorporate many of the features of high @xmath5 superconductors ( notably the symmetry of the pairing ) , the model has been shown to provide useful insight into some of their phenomenology , for example the spin - gap.@xcite it is therefore tempting to speculate that our results concerning inhomogeneity may have similar connections .",
    "specifically , earlier arpes data @xcite suggests that the underdoped phase of lsco ( la@xmath188sr@xmath189cuo@xmath190 ) consists of sc clusters , embedded in the af host .",
    "in such a system , inhomogeneous gaps appear naturally and our results here indicate that the sc transition is in fact determined by the largest gap values rather than the much smaller gaps found at phase boundaries , as one might naively think .",
    "this renders the sc phase more stable than it would otherwise be , and also simplifies the description of these systems .",
    "it is worth emphasizing that in most situations , inhomogeneities reduce values of order parameters @xcite and critical temperatures , even when comparisons are made , as they are in this article , to homogeneous systems with the same average value of all parameters .",
    "this is true , for example , for classical site diluted ising models , where the ferromagnetic @xmath12 is increased to compensate for absent sites , and quantum models like the boson hubbard model where random chemical potentials monotonically decrease and ultimately destroy superfluidity.@xcite an exception is the increase of @xmath191 by randomness reported in dmft studies of the repulsive model @xcite and recently , the sc @xmath7 in @xmath15 model hamiltonian with certain types of inhomogeneous patterns for the coupling constant between spins sitting on nearest neighboring sites . @xcite .",

    "<S> we study s - wave superconductivity in the two - dimensional square lattice attractive hubbard hamiltonian for various inhomogeneous patterns of interacting sites . using the bogoliubov - de gennes ( bdg ) mean field approximation </S>",
    "<S> , we obtain the phase diagram for inhomogeneous patterns in which the on - site attractive interaction @xmath0 between the electrons takes on two values , @xmath1 and @xmath2 ( with @xmath3 the concentration of non - interacting sites ) as a function of average electron occupation per site @xmath4 , and study the evolution of the phase diagram as @xmath3 varies . in certain regions of the phase diagram , </S>",
    "<S> inhomogeneity results in a larger zero temperature average pairing amplitude ( order parameter ) and also a higher superconducting ( sc ) critical temperature @xmath5 , relative to a uniform system with the same mean interaction strength ( @xmath6 on all sites ) . </S>",
    "<S> these effects are observed for stripes , checkerboard , and even random patterns of the attractive centers , suggesting that the pattern of inhomogeneity is unimportant . </S>",
    "<S> the phase diagrams also include regions where superconductivity is obliterated due to the formation of various charge ordered phases . </S>",
    "<S> the enhancement of @xmath7 due to inhomogeneity is robust as long as the electron doping per site @xmath4 is less than twice the fraction of interacting sites [ @xmath8 regardless of the pattern . </S>",
    "<S> we also show that for certain inhomogeneous patterns , when @xmath9 , increasing temperature can work against the stability of existing charge ordered phases for large @xmath3 and as a result , enhance @xmath7 .    </S>",
