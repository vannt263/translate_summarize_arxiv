    "simple models for reactions of diffusing species have been intensively studied in the last decades @xcite , such as trapping reactions , annihilation or coagulation of a single species and two - species annihilation . in low dimensions ,",
    "these apparently simple models yield a wide range of nontrivial kinetic behaviors because mean - field theories ( laws of mass action ) fail .",
    "one - dimensional media may be a realistic description of the structure of catalysts with long and narrow pores , such as zeolites and porous oxides , or may represent step edges of two - dimensional surfaces where reactants preferrably adsorb .",
    "the former materials have inhomogeneous distributions of catalytic centers where the reactions take place , which motivated recent theoretical models . if the reaction is unimolecular with volatile products , then that inhomogeneity can be represented by trapping models @xcite , with the traps playing the role of catalytic sites . for other reaction mechanisms , the disorder in the spatial distribution of the catalytic centers",
    "was also considered in recent works @xcite . in some cases",
    ", it leads to nontrivial dependence of the reaction rates on diffusion coefficients and catalyst density .",
    "effects of catalyst geometry and conditions to improve the efficiency of a reaction process were also discussed in recent works @xcite .",
    "a phenomenon of great economic impact on industrial processes is catalyst deactivation , which is the reduction of catalytic activity due to blocking of active sites , distortion or blockage of the porous structure , sintering of metal particles etc @xcite .",
    "one of the possible deactivation mechanisms is poisoning .",
    "it occurs when a reactant , product or impurity is strongly chemisorbed in the active sites , preventing further reactions but not affecting the diffusion of reactants and products along the pores . for instance , poisoning of metals by sulphur species ( @xmath2 , @xmath3 , @xmath4 etc ) is a problem in many catalytic processes , such as hydrogenation , methanation , fischer  tropsch synthesis , steam reforming and fuel cell power production .",
    "in other cases , large aggregates are formed inside the catalyst pores ; this is called coking or fouling and eventually leads to pore blockage .",
    "due to its technological relevance , deactivation mechanisms are frequently included in models of catalytic processes @xcite .",
    "the main interest of those models is to predict the time evolution of the catalytic activity and the turnover frequency with a continuous flux of reactants , thus they are usually designed for a particular application .",
    "however , there is no systematic study of the effects of deactivation on the kinetics of simple reaction - diffusion models ( e. g. trapping or annihilation ) .",
    "the aim of this work is to fill this gap by introducing one - dimensional models for catalyzed reactions of diffusing reactants with poisoning of catalytic sites .",
    "we will consider initial conditions with uniform distributions of reactants and no external flux .",
    "these conditions are far from those encountered in real catalytic processes in porous media , but they are interesting as a first step to understand possible changes in those systems kinetics",
    ".    we will study these models with scaling concepts supported by numerical simulations .",
    "unimolecular and bimolecular ( same species ) reactions occuring upon contact of the reactants with the catalytic sites are considered .",
    "poisoning is represented by the permanent blockage of those sites , with a given probability , immediately after the reaction takes place .",
    "two limiting cases of this type of model anticipate the presence of kinetic transitions : for very low deactivation rates and low initial reactant concentration , poisoning is negligible , thus that concentration decays similarly to the case without deactivation ; however , for high deactivation rates and high initial reactant concentration , the catalyst will be rapidly poisoned and part of the reactants will not be consumed .",
    "this analysis raises the question of how these systems behave when deactivation rates , initial reactant concentrations and catalyst loadings change , and which types of transition occur .",
    "we will show that two phases exist in those systems . in one phase",
    ", the reactant concentration continuously decay to zero , with the same asymptotic scaling of the main reaction . in the other phase",
    ", there is a non - zero reactant concentration at long times . in the boundary between those phases ,",
    "the system behaves as in the two - species annihilation reaction , with reactant concentration decaying as @xmath0 in one dimension - the catalytic sites play the role of the second species in this case . near a transition point",
    ", we will show a long crossover to the asymptotic scaling of the phase of decaying reactant concentration .",
    "thus , a correct interpretation of the main reaction kinetics becomes difficult , particularly with short time simulation data .",
    "for bimolecular reactions , the deactivation also enlarges the time interval of an intermediate two - dimensional scaling , where the concentration decay is faster than both the short - time and the long - time ones .",
    "these crossovers may also have important consequences in the interpretation of experimental results .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii we consider unimolecular reactions with inert products taking place at random catalytic sites ( traps ) subject to deactivation . in sec .",
    "iii , bimolecular single - species reactions are considered and in sec .",
    "iv we summarize our results and present our conclusions .",
    "in this model , defined in a one - dimensional lattice , we consider unimolecular reactions with volatile products , which occur when the reactant is in contact with the catalyst .",
    "initially , catalytic sites ( c ) are randomly distributed with coverage @xmath5 and are immobile .",
    "the other sites are labeled as non - catalytic or empty sites . at @xmath6 ,",
    "a concentration @xmath7 of reactants ( species a ) is randomly distributed through the non - catalytic sites - consequently , the condition @xmath8 is obeyed . for @xmath9 , reactants a diffuse with coefficient @xmath10 , i. e. each reactant executes an average of @xmath10 random steps to neighboring sites per unit time ( the lattice parameter is the length unit ) , and they obey the excluded volume condition .",
    "the unimolecular reaction corresponds to a trapping reaction @xcite in the form @xmath11 which immediately occurs when a occupies the same site of c. with probability @xmath12 , the catalytic site is deactivated , i. e. c is converted into an empty site ( consequently , it does not affect diffusion of the other reactants ) .",
    "the reaction with subsequent poisoning corresponds to the reaction scheme @xmath13 where @xmath14 represents an empty site .",
    "thus , the model may be viewed as a competition between the reaction ( [ unimolecular ] ) , with probability @xmath15 , and the reaction ( [ unimolecularp ] ) , with probability @xmath12 .",
    "this is illustrated in fig .",
    "1a .",
    "as time evolves , the catalyst coverage and the reactant concentration are respectively denoted by @xmath16 and @xmath17 .",
    "we performed simulations of this model in lattices of length @xmath18 ( more than one million sites ) , with several different values of the parameters @xmath5 , @xmath7 and @xmath12 .",
    "for each set of parameters , typically @xmath19 different realizations were averaged .",
    "diffusion coefficients of species a were @xmath20 in most cases .",
    "maximum simulation times were up to @xmath21 units under these conditions .      for @xmath22 , we recover the well - known trapping problem with static traps . since there is no deactivation , all the reactants initially placed in a segment between two consecutive traps",
    "are annihilated in one of the edge traps . for a fixed segment size @xmath23 ,",
    "the decay is a simple exponential in @xmath24 .",
    "however , the average over ( poisson distributed ) segment lengths is dominated by trapping in large segments @xcite , which leads to the donsker - varadan @xcite result @xmath25 } , \\label{expt13}\\ ] ] where @xmath26 is the trap density and @xmath27 . in the case @xmath22 , we have @xmath28 .    for @xmath12 small but non - zero , the concentration of reactants rapidly decays to very low values , while only a fraction of the initial catalytic sites is deactivated .",
    "the annihilation of a concentration @xmath7 of species a leads to poisoning of a density @xmath29 of catalytic sites .",
    "thus , at long times , the trap density is @xmath30 and the reactant concentration @xmath31 is much smaller . in this case ,",
    "reaction ( [ unimolecular ] ) is asymptotically dominant , thus a decay as in eq .",
    "( [ expt13 ] ) is expected .",
    "simulations with small values of @xmath12 confirm this result , as shown in fig .",
    "they also show another interesting and somehow surprising feature : while results for @xmath22 show significant corrections to the dominant scaling ( eq . [ expt13 ] ) , the results for non - zero @xmath12 show that stretched exponential decay with negligible corrections ( the data for @xmath32 in fig .",
    "2a fits a straight line in three time decades ) .",

    "on the other hand , if @xmath36 , a finite reactant concentration @xmath37 is found at long times , while the trap density continuously decays . this regime is dominated by reaction ( [ unimolecularp ] ) , with excess concentration of a relatively to c. fig .",
    "2b confirms this result for @xmath38 , @xmath39 and @xmath34 , which gives a remaining density of reactants @xmath40 .",
    "a transition is found when @xmath41 which corresponds to a surface in the @xmath42 space . in this case , the reactant concentration and the catalyst coverage decrease by the same factors at all times .",
    "the continuous increase of the distance between consecutive catalytic sites certainly rules out the arguments that lead to the result in eq .",

    "experimentally , it has an important consequence : the reaction kinetics may be incorrectly identified if one observes the time evolution of the concentration decay ( or the turnover rate ) in a restricted time range and disregards the effects of deactivation .",
    "the second reaction mechanism studied in this work is bimolecular with a single species .",
    "the model corresponds to annihilation reactions of this species limited to catalytic sites of a lattice .",

    "@xcite . the poisoning is also represented by the permanent blockage of a catalytic site after a reaction , and occurs with probability @xmath77 .",
    "it corresponds to the reaction @xmath78 the competitive model is illustrated in fig .",
    "when @xmath79 , we have the model proposed by oshanin and blumen @xcite , in which the density of reactants decays as @xmath80 in one dimension .",
    "this dominant contribution to the decay does not involve the catalyst coverage , which can be explained as follows .",
    "the characteristic time for two consecutive reactants to meet at the same site is @xmath81 .",
    "after they meet , the closest trap is inside a neighborhood of size @xmath82 .",
    "thus , the typical time for those reactants to meet at that trap is @xmath83 . at long times , @xmath84 , thus we have @xmath85 and the long - time scaling is dominated by @xmath86 , which leads to eq .",
    "( [ t12 ] ) . however , the catalyst coverage plays an important role at intermediate times , as will be shown in sec .",

    "the three - particle reaction ( [ bimolecularq ] ) and an analogy with the case of sec . ii could suggest that the scaling of the concentration at the transition point is that of a three - particle annihilation model . since the catalyst coverage does not play a role in the decay for @xmath79 ( eq . [ t12 ] ) , we might think that the time @xmath86 governs the scaling at the transition . however , this is not the truth .",

    "the above analysis suggests that a crossover between two power law decays ( @xmath0 and @xmath91 ) would be observed near a transition point .",

    "we studied reaction - diffusion models in heterogeneous one - dimensional lattices with catalytic and non - catalytic sites and possible deactivation of catalytic sites by poisoning .",
    "these models show a transition between a phase with continuous decay of reactant concentration and survival of catalytic sites , and a phase with asymptotic non - zero reactant concentration and complete poisoning of the catalyst . the critical systems behave as the two - species annihilation model with stoichiometric concentrations of reactants . for each reaction mechanism , the transition boundary depends on the initial concentrations of reactant and catalyst and the probability of deactivation .",
    "we analyzed models of unimolecular and bimolecular single - species reactions , and showed that , in a transition point , the reactant concentration decays as in the two - species annihilation reaction . in the decaying phase but near a critical point of the unimolecular reaction , a long crossover to the asymptotic scaling is found .",
    "thus , short time simulations show effective power - law decays instead of the stretched exponential , which suggests a change in the reaction kinetics .",
    "the situation is much more complex with the bimolecular single - species reaction because the small catalyst density near a critical point leads to an apparent two - dimensional decay of reactant concentration .",
    "thus , two crossovers are observed and the asymptotic decay is found only at extremely long times , even with one parameter being more than @xmath1 far from criticality .",
    "our results resemble transitions in other competitive reaction - diffusion models which were not explicitly interpreted as effects of catalyst deactivation . sanchez and co - workers studied the case where reaction @xmath125 competes with @xmath126 ( double trapping ) or @xmath127 ( trapping plus annihilation ) @xcite , showing that the initial concentrations and the reaction rates also determine the asymptotic behavior .",
    "further work on these and related reactions also considered anisotropic or anomalous diffusion of reactants , different forms of reactant input , and power - law decays of reaction rates , which lead to a wide range of interesting kinetic behaviors @xcite .",
    "for instance , the model of yuste et al @xcite for trapping by subdiffusive traps with vanishing density shows a transition with scaling similar to our unimolecular model .    despite the simplicity of the reaction - diffusion models presented here , experimental applications are possible .",
    "for instance , the depletion zones of a trapping model with a single trap were already observed in photobleaching of fluorescein dye by a focused laser beam @xcite , and models with competitive reactions were already used to represent patterns of a reaction between @xmath128 and xylenol orange @xcite .",
    "thus , we believe that our work may also have applications to systems with catalyzed reactions and deactivation by poisoning , particularly to help the interpretation of kinetic data .        we acknowledge support from cnpq and faperj ( brazilian agencies ) to our simulation laboratory at uff , brazil .",
