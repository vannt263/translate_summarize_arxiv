    "@xcite addressed astophysical constraints on extra dimensions by computing energy loss rates from the sun , red giant stars and ( type ii ) supernovae due to possible excitation of graviton modes , @xmath1 , in the case that the extra dimensions are compactified @xcite .",
    "the processes @xmath2 ( in the static nucleon approximation ) , and @xmath3 where considered .",
    "they worked in the zero density approximation , varying only the temperature .",
    "their calculation neglected plasma effects and they anticipated that this neglect should not be important because of the high power dependence on @xmath4 , the inverse of the compactification dimension .    the purpose of this paper is to address the extent to which the process @xmath5 ( and the crossed process @xmath6 ) is affected by a non - zero charged particle density and the presence of both longitudinal and transverse plasmons .",
    "our aims are , in brief , to find numerical values for the energy loss rate per @xmath0 for densities from @xmath7 to @xmath8gm/@xmath0 and temperatures from @xmath7 to @xmath9 ev , to confirm the barger _",
    ". _ expectation of density insensitivity , to show the extent to which the systems they considered are close to the border in density at which their expectation fails , to determine the relative contributions of longitudinal and transverse plasmon processes , to address the size of the contribution of the crossed process , and , importantly , to note the ambiguities in the form of a covariant interaction between plasmons and kaluza - klein modes .",
    "it is clear that the expectation of barger et al .",
    "@xcite must fail at sufficiently high density , for fixed temperature , since the energy loss rate goes as an integral over the bose - einstein distribution , @xmath10 , in which the frequencies are given by a dispersion relation with an effective photon mass that grows with density .",
    "it is essentially a numerical question as to the point at which suppression sets in and the rate ( in density ) at which it proceeds .",
    "intuition is hampered by the fact that the natural parameter is the electron chemical potential which is not simply related to the particle density .",
    "we give the numerical results over the temperature and density ranges cited above .",
    "an important problem in carrying out this work is the question of the appropriate lagrangian .",
    "the free space coupling between the electromagnetic field and gravitons can be found in textbooks , for example @xcite , and has been generalized to the case of higher dimensional kaluza - klein excitations @xcite .",
    "however , we have not found a parallel literature for the case in which the free space photon is replaced by a plasmon satisfying a non - trivial dispersion relation .",
    "this difficulty is addressed in section 2 .",
    "we adopt a diagrammatic approach and also make an approximation that we test numerically . also given in section 2",

    "we conclude in section 4 with a brief summary .",

    "we have shown the the sum of these diagrams is gauge invariant and conserved for arbitrary @xmath59 and @xmath60 at finite temperature and density . however ,",
    "this was done without actually evaluating the diagrams . in particular , diagram ( d ) is very tedious and we have not computed it .",

    "the first step in the calculations is to obtain @xmath96 from eq.([density ] ) . in doing this",

    "two tables are given ( @xmath102 and @xmath103 ) in order to make clear both the deviation of @xmath20 from @xmath104 ( taken as 0.51 mev ) at low temperature and its deviation from zero at high .",
    "note the rapid variation of @xmath20 ( for the lowest densities ) at the temperature @xmath18 around @xmath105 where pair production first begins to be copious , and the slower but similar variation at higher densities @xmath97 .",
    "the variation is slower for higher densities because the electron - positron density difference needs to have a large value .",
    "these variations are illustrated in fig.[mu_1 ] , where , for display purposes , the lowest value of @xmath20 shown , @xmath106 , is an upper limit on the exact numbers in table [ mu ] .",

    "we now pass on to the results of calculating @xmath107 for the case of @xmath108 extra dimensions .",
    "it was possible to evaluate the integral in eq.([dedtdv ] ) over the cosine of the angle between the two plasmons analytically so that , for all the processes under consideration , only two integrals remain in finding the energy loss rate - the integrals over the two plasmon momenta .",
    "it should be noted that there are only four processes to consider : ( 1 ) @xmath109 , ( 2 ) @xmath110 , ( 3 ) @xmath111 , and ( 4 ) @xmath112 .",
    "this is because , as the plasmon momentum @xmath41 increases , the effective mass of a transverse plasmon increases while the effective mass of a longitudinal plasmon decreases @xcite .",
    "thus the _ missing _ processes , @xmath113 and @xmath114 are forbidden by energy - momentum conservation .",
    "the assertion is clear for the first process since @xmath115 .",
    "for the second , we note that , in the rest frame of the decaying longitudinal plasmon , @xmath116 and conservation of energy and momentum implies that the graviton mass , @xmath117 , satisfies @xmath118 where @xmath119 is the energy of the final plasmon . using the dispersion relation for longitudinal plasmons ,",
    "it can be shown that the right side of eq.([lneqlg ] ) is less than zero for @xmath120 .",
    "the results of the calculations are given in tables [ tt]-[tot2 ] .",
    "these have the energy loss rates for the four processes , and for the sum , for a matrix of density and temperature values - @xmath121 to @xmath8 gm/@xmath0 for density @xmath97 and @xmath7 to @xmath122 ev for temperature @xmath18 - in both cases in factors of @xmath123 increments . in these tables , @xmath18 increases from left to right while @xmath97 increases from top to bottom .",
    "the entries are logs to the base 10 of the energy loss rate in ergs per @xmath0-s .",
    "note that barger _",
    "@xcite give results per unit mass , but results per unit volume are better for our purposes since they show more clearly the way in which the zero - density approximation breaks down as the density increases .",
    "we give the results for @xmath124 tev .",
    "two additional tables , [ dom ] and [ frac ] , give respectively the number of the process that dominates for the reaction ( zero if the rate is zero , i.e. below @xmath125 ) and the fraction of the total represented by the dominant contribution .    in fig.[tttog](@xmath126 ) , we see at a glance the effect cited in the     for the process @xmath127 is plotted for the range of density @xmath97 and temperature @xmath18 given in the text .",
    "[ tttog],height=288 ]    introduction : for fixed @xmath18 the energy loss rate is independent of the density until @xmath97 increases to a point where the effective photon mass and plasmon density are sufficiently high that the rate drops exponentially . the numerical values are given in table[tt ] .",

    "[ lltog],height=288 ]    the analogous plot for @xmath112 is shown in fig.[lltog ] . here",

    "again , numerical values are found in table[ll ] .",
    "the sun , a red giant , and a type ii supernova are , in the ( @xmath129 ) plane , given by barger _",
    "_ @xcite to be at ( 156 gm/@xmath0,1.3 kev ) , ( 10@xmath130 gm/@xmath0 , 8.6 kev ) , and ( 10@xmath131 gm/@xmath0 , 30 mev ) respectively .",
    "we see from table [ tt ] that the sun is in a low density region where the zero - density approximation holds while the supernova is on the edge of a constant density region .",
    "we also see from table 6 that the other processes contribute little in these two cases .",
    "the red giant ( rg ) case is more interesting . in table [ tt ] , we see from the @xmath132 and @xmath133 columns that the rg is in the gentle fall off region for the former , but the steep fall off region for the latter .",
    "examining the region between 1 and 10 kev more closely gives , with t varying in 1.0 kev increments , for the log of the tt energy loss rate : -16.7 , -5.1 , -0.91 , 1.36 , 2.85 , 3.94 , 4.78 , 5.48 , 6.07 , 6.57 .",
    "the total energy loss rate varies as : -15.96 , -4.14 , 0.37 , 2.65 , 3.77 , 4.59 , 5.25 , 5.82 , 6.31 , 6.77 . in short , at the rg , the tt energy loss rate , 1.4 erg / g@xmath134s , is down by a factor 4.5 from its zero - density approximation @xcite , but the other processes bring the total rate up to 2.6 erg / g@xmath134s , or within about a factor 2 of the zero density result .",
    "finally we turn to the dependence of the emission rates on the number n of ( large ) extra dimensions .",
    "we give , in tables [ tot3 ] and [ tot4 ] , the results for the total rates for n=3 and n=4 .",
    "one sees , in the low - density limit , the @xmath135 behavior pointed out by barger _",
    "@xcite for the @xmath136 rate which dominates for @xmath137 in the same places as in the @xmath108 case .",
    "the approximations of zero density and purely transverse ( @xmath126 ) photon annihilation into gravitons of @xcite must fail , for fixed temperature , at high densities .",
    "we have computed a first estimate of finite density corrections to two - plasmon production , for both transverse and longitudinal plasmons of kaluza - klein excitations , as well as the decay process @xmath138 as a function of plasma density and temperature over a wide range of interest in both parameters .",
    "our conclusion is that the zero - density , pure transverse approximation is satisfactory for the sun , marginal for supernovae , and fails by about a factor of 5 for red giants .",
    "it is interesting to note that , while very little of the @xmath139 plane is occupied , astrophysical systems appear to be preferentially located relatively close to the boundaries ( in @xmath97 ) at which the transverse photon approximation begins to fail .",
    "our calculation is approximate in that we omit most of the diagrams of fig.([diags ] ) .",
    "however , we believe our results indicate that the full calculation of all the diagrams is unlikely to modify our conclusions .",
