    "the proximity catch digraphs ( pcds ) are a special type of proximity graphs which are based on proximity maps and are used in disciplines where shape and structure are crucial .",
    "examples include computer vision ( dot patterns ) , image analysis , pattern recognition ( prototype selection ) , geography and cartography , visual perception , biology , etc . _ proximity graphs _",
    "were first introduced by @xcite , who called them _ relative neighborhood graphs_. the notion of relative neighborhood graph has been generalized in several directions and all of these graphs are now called proximity graphs . from a mathematical and algorithmic point of view , proximity graphs fall under the category of _ computational geometry_.    in recent years , a new classification and spatial pattern analysis approach which is based on the relative positions of the data points from various classes has been developed .",
    "@xcite introduced the class cover catch digraphs ( cccds ) and gave the exact and the asymptotic distribution of the domination number of the cccd based on two data sets @xmath0 and @xmath1 both of which are random samples from uniform distribution on a compact interval in @xmath2 .",
    "@xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite applied the concept in higher dimensions and demonstrated relatively good performance of cccd in classification .",
    "the employed methods involve data reduction ( condensing ) by using approximate minimum dominating sets as prototype sets , since finding the exact minimum dominating set is in general an np - hard problem  in particular , for cccd  ( see @xcite ) .",
    "furthermore , the exact and the asymptotic distribution of the domination number of the cccds are not analytically tractable in higher dimensions .",
    "@xcite extended the concept of cccds by introducing pcds , which do not suffer from some of the shortcomings of cccds in higher dimensions .",
    "in particular , two new types of pcds ( namely , _ proportional - edge _ and _ central similarity pcds _ ) are introduced ; distribution of the domination number of proportional - edge pcds is calculated , and is applied in testing spatial patterns of segregation and association ( @xcite ) .",
    "the distributions of the relative arc density of these pcd families are also derived and used for the same purpose ( @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "a general definition of proximity graphs is as follows : let @xmath3 be any finite or infinite set of points in @xmath4 .",
    "each ( unordered ) pair of points @xmath5 is associated with a neighborhood @xmath6 .",
    "let @xmath7 be a property defined on @xmath8 .",
    "a _ proximity _ ( or _ neighborhood _ ) _ graph _ @xmath9 defined by the property @xmath7 is a graph with the set of vertices @xmath3 and the set of edges @xmath10 such that @xmath11 iff @xmath12 satisfies property @xmath7 .",
    "examples of most commonly used proximity graphs are the delaunay tessellation , the boundary of the convex hull , the gabriel graph , relative neighborhood graph , euclidean minimum spanning tree , and sphere of influence graph of a finite data set .",
    "see , e.g. , @xcite .",
    "the relative allocation of the data points are used to construct a proximity digraph .",
    "a _ digraph _ is a directed graph , i.e. , a graph with directed edges from one vertex to another based on a binary relation .",
    "then the pair @xmath5 is an ordered pair and @xmath13 is an arc ( directed edge ) denoted @xmath14 to reflect its difference from an edge .",
    "for example , the nearest neighbor ( di)graph in @xcite is a proximity digraph .",
    "the nearest neighbor digraph , denoted @xmath15 , has the vertex set @xmath3 and @xmath14 an arc iff @xmath16 .",
    "that is , @xmath14 is an arc of @xmath15 iff @xmath17 is a nearest neighbor of @xmath18 .",
    "note that if @xmath14 is an arc in @xmath15 , then @xmath13 is an edge in @xmath19 .",
    "our pcds are based on the property @xmath7 that is determined by the following mapping which is defined in a more general space than @xmath4 .",
    "let @xmath20 be a measurable space .",
    "the _ proximity map _",
    "@xmath21 is given by @xmath22 , where @xmath23 is the power set functional , and the _ proximity region _ of @xmath24 , denoted @xmath25 , is the image of @xmath26 under @xmath21 .",
    "the points in @xmath25 are thought of as being  closer \" to @xmath24 than are the points in @xmath27 .",
    "proximity maps are the building blocks of the _ proximity graphs _ of @xcite ; an extensive survey is available in @xcite .",
    "the _ pcd _ @xmath28 has the vertex set @xmath29 and the arc set @xmath30 is defined by @xmath31 iff @xmath32 for @xmath33 .",
    "notice that @xmath34 depends on the _ proximity _ map @xmath21 , and if @xmath32 , then @xmath35 is said to _ catch _",
    "hence the name _ proximity catch digraph_. if arcs of the form @xmath37 ( i.e. , loops ) were allowed , @xmath34 would have been called a _ pseudodigraph _ according to some authors ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .    in this article",
    ", we provide a probabilistic characterization of the proximity maps , and the associated regions and pcds , and introduce auxiliary tools for the pcds .",
    "we define the proximity maps and data - random pcds in section [ sec : pcd ] , describe the auxiliary tools ( such as edge and vertex regions ) for the construction of pcds in section [ sec : prox - maps - prelim ] , provide @xmath38-regions and the related concepts for proximity maps in section [ sec : gamma1-regions ] , discuss the examples of proximity maps in delaunay triangles in section [ sec : example - pcds ] , and provide the transformations preserving uniformity on triangles in @xmath39 in section [ sec : transformations ] .",
    "we investigate the characterization of proximity regions and the associated pcds in section [ sec : characterize - pcds ] , introduce @xmath40-regions for proximity maps in @xmath41 in section [ sec : gammak - regions ] , @xmath42-values for the proximity maps in @xmath41 in section [ sec : kappa - value ] , and provide discussion and conclusions in section [ sec : disc - conc ] .",

    "a collection of neighborhoods satisfying both conditions is called a _",
    "class cover_. a cover satisfying condition ( i ) is a _ proper cover _ of class @xmath45 while a collection satisfying condition ( ii ) is a _ pure cover _ relative to class @xmath46 . from a practical point of view , for example for classification , of particular interest are the class covers satisfying both ( i ) and ( ii ) with the smallest collection of neighborhoods , i.e. , minimum cardinality cover .",
    "this class cover problem is a generalization of the set cover problem in @xcite that emerged in statistical pattern recognition and machine learning , where an edited or condensed set ( prototype set ) is selected from @xmath0 ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",

    "more specifically , our proximity maps will be based on the relative position of points from class @xmath45 with respect to the delaunay tessellation of the class @xmath46 .",
    "see @xcite and @xcite for more on delaunay tessellations .",
    "if @xmath0 is a set of @xmath47-valued random variables then @xmath59 are random sets . if @xmath60 are independent identically distributed then so are the random sets @xmath59 .",
    "we define the data - random pcd @xmath28  associated with @xmath55  with vertex set @xmath61 and arc set @xmath30 by @xmath62 . since this relationship is not symmetric , a digraph is needed rather than a graph .",
    "the random digraph @xmath34 depends on the ( joint ) distribution of the @xmath60 and on the map @xmath55 .",
    "the pcds are closely related to the _ proximity graphs _ of @xcite and might be considered as a special case of _ covering sets _ of @xcite and _ intersection digraphs _ of @xcite .",
    "this data random proximity digraph is a _ vertex - random proximity digraph _ which is not of standard type .",
    "the randomness of the pcds lies in the fact that the vertices are random with joint pdf @xmath48 , but arcs @xmath63 are deterministic functions of the random variable @xmath64 and the set @xmath59 .",
    "for example , the cccd of @xcite can be viewed as an example of pcd with @xmath65 , where @xmath66 .",
    "the cccd is the digraph of order @xmath67 with vertex set @xmath0 and an arc from @xmath60 to @xmath64 iff @xmath68 .",
    "that is , there is an arc from @xmath60 to @xmath64 iff there exists an open ball centered at @xmath60 which is  pure \" ( or contains no elements ) of @xmath1 , and simultaneously contains ( or  catches \" ) point @xmath64 .",
    "recall the proximity map ( associated with cccd ) in @xmath2 is defined as @xmath69 where @xmath70 with @xmath71 being the euclidean distance between @xmath58 and @xmath72 ( @xcite ) .",

    "for @xmath74 the proximity map associated with cccd is defined as the open ball @xmath75 for all @xmath76 and for @xmath77 , define @xmath78 .",
    "furthermore , dependence on @xmath1 is through @xmath79 .",
    "hence @xmath80 is based on the intervals @xmath81 for @xmath82 with @xmath83 and @xmath84 where @xmath85 is the @xmath86 order statistic in @xmath1 .",
    "this intervalization can be viewed as a tessellation since it partitions @xmath87 , the convex hull of @xmath1 . for @xmath88 , a natural tessellation that partitions @xmath87",
    "is the delaunay tessellation ( see @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "let @xmath89 for @xmath90 be the @xmath86 delaunay cell in the delaunay tessellation of @xmath1 . in @xmath2",
    ", we implicitly use the cell that contains @xmath58 to define the proximity map .",
    "a natural extension of the proximity region @xmath80 to multiple dimensions ( i.e. , to @xmath4 with @xmath88 ) is obtained by the same definition as above ; that is , @xmath75 where @xmath91 .",
    "notice that a ball is a sphere in higher dimensions , hence the name _ spherical proximity map _ and the notation @xmath92 .",
    "the spherical proximity map @xmath80 is well - defined for all @xmath93 provided that @xmath94 .",
    "extensions to @xmath39 and higher dimensions with the spherical proximity map  with applications in classification  are investigated in @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite . however , finding the minimum dominating set of the pcd associated with @xmath95 is an np - hard problem and the distribution of the domination number is not analytically tractable for @xmath88 ( @xcite ) .",
    "this drawback has motivated us to define new types of proximity maps in higher dimensions .",

    "@xcite states some appealing properties of the proximity map @xmath96 in @xmath2 and uses them as guidelines for extending proximity maps to higher dimensions and defining new proximity maps .",
    "after a slight modification , the spherical proximity maps gives rise to arc - slice proximity maps which is defined as @xmath97 for @xmath98 ( i.e. , when the arc - slice proximity region is the spherical proximity region restricted to the delaunay triangle @xmath58 lies in ) .",
    "however , for @xmath99 ( i.e. , @xmath58 is not in any of the delaunay triangles based on @xmath1 ) , @xmath100 is not defined .    for @xmath101 , @xmath102 iff @xmath103 .",
    "we define an associated region for such points in the general context .",

    "so the proximity region of a point in @xmath123 has the largest @xmath2-lebesgue measure .",
    "note that for @xmath124 ( i.e. @xmath125 ) , @xmath115 , since @xmath126 for all @xmath101 so @xmath127 for all @xmath128 .",
