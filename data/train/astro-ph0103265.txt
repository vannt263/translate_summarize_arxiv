    "some recent inflation models ( e.g. , the hybrid inflationary scenario @xcite ) predict the `` blue '' power - spectrum of primordial density fluctuations . in turn , as is well known , the significant abundance of primordial black holes ( pbhs ) is possible just in the case when the density fluctuations have an @xmath0 spectrum ( @xmath1 is the spectral index of the initial density fluctuations , @xmath0 spectrum is , by definition , the `` blue perturbation spectrum '' ) .    particle emission from pbhs due to the evaporation process predicted by hawking @xcite may lead to observable effects . up to now , pbhs have not been detected , so the observations have set limits on the initial pbh abundance or on characteristics of a spectrum of the primordial density fluctuations .",
    "in particular , pbh evaporations contribute to the extragalactic neutrino background .",
    "the constraints on an intensity of this background ( and , correspondingly , on an pbh abundance ) can be obtained from the existing experiments with atmospheric and solar neutrinos .",
    "the obtaining of such constraints is a main task of the present paper .    the spectrum and the intensity of the evaporated neutrinos depend heavily on the pbh s mass .",
    "therefore , the great attention should be paid to the calculation of the initial mass spectrum of pbhs .",
    "we use in this paper the following assumptions leading to a prediction of the pbh s mass spectrum .",
    "the formation of pbhs begins only after an inflation phase when the universe returns to the ordinary radiation - dominated era .",
    "the reheating process is such that an equation of state of the universe changes almost instantaneously into the radiation type ( e.g. , due to the parametric resonance @xcite ) after the inflation .",
    "\\2 . it is assumed , in accordance with analytic calculations @xcite that a critical size of the density contrast needed for the pbh formation , @xmath2 , is about @xmath3 .",
    "further , it is assumed that all pbhs have mass roughly equal to the horizon mass at a moment of the formation , independently of the perturbation size .",
    "summation over all epochs of the pbh formation can be done using the press - schechter formalism @xcite .",
    "this formalism is widely used in the standard hierarchial model of the structure formation for calculations of the mass distribution functions ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "it was shown recently that near the threshold of a black hole formation the gravitational collapse behaves as a critical phenomenon @xcite . in this case",
    "the initial mass function will be quite different from that which follows from the standard calculations of refs .",
    "@xcite.the first calculations of the pbh initial mass function ( e.g. , in ref.@xcite ) have been done under the assumption that all pbhs form at the same horizon mass ( by other words , that all pbhs form at the smallest horizon scale immediately after reheating ) .",
    "the initial pbh mass spectrum for the case of the critical collapse , based on the press - schechter formalism , was obtained in the recent work @xcite .",
    "the calculations in the present paper are based on the standard @xcite picture of the gravitational collapse leading to a pbh formation .",

    "a growth of the absorption factor with @xmath101 is very fast , therefore the redshifts for which the condition ( [ ddf ] ) is violated are never really important in a calculation of the absorption .",
    "our calculation of neutrino spectra from evaporating pbhs contains two parameters : a spectral index @xmath1 and a time of an end of the inflation @xmath76 ( which , by assumption , is a time when density fluctuations develop ) .",
    "we assume that at @xmath76 the universe has as a result of the reheating the equilibrium temperature @xmath168 .",

    "the inclusion of the absorption effects leads to an appearing of the additional factor in this integral : @xmath302 @xmath303 each curve in fig.[fig : fig3 ] has a strong cut off on some redshift value .",

    "so , at @xmath310 the redshifts of order of @xmath311 give a largest contribution to the neutrino background ( if there is no neutrino absorption ; the absorption effects are essential just near @xmath312 , and , as one can see from the figure , the actual @xmath101-dependences of the integrand have peak values at @xmath313 , depending on a neutrino energy ) .",

    "the relative contribution of the fragmentation channel at @xmath322 grows with an decrease of @xmath168 .",
    "the highest relative contribution is at @xmath323 . at this @xmath168",
    "the minimum value of mass in pbh mass spectrum ( @xmath324 ) coincides with the threshold of quark evaporations ( @xmath325 , according to fig.[fig : fig1 ] ) . at further decrease of @xmath168 the relative contribution of quark fragmentations at @xmath326",
    "fastly decreases and , at some @xmath168 value , it is strictly zero ( when , due to correspondingly large @xmath324 value , the age of the universe is not enough for `` warming - up '' the pbhs ) .",

    "we calculate the constraints for two extreme @xmath193-values , for which the parametrization for @xmath217 ( eq.([d16b ] ) ) is still valid .",
    "it is clear that some weakening of the constraint with an increase of @xmath193 is due to the corresponding decrease of values of the function @xmath386 entering the initial pbh mass spectrum ( see eq.([220 ] ) ) .",
    "this decrease of @xmath380 takes place solely due to the dependence of @xmath217 on @xmath193 ( see eq.([d16b ] ) ) .",
    "the behavior of the constraint curve @xmath387 is sharply different from that was obtained in ref .",
    "@xcite ( authors of ref .",
    "@xcite used the initial pbh mass function following from the near critical collapse scenario with a domination of the earliest epoch of pbhs formation , and diffuse extragalactic photon data ) .",
    "the slight bend at @xmath388 of the constraint curves ( fig.[fig : fig7 ] ) is an effect of a neutrino absorption in the space .",
    "constraint based on the atmospheric neutrino experiment is especially sensitive to the absorption because neutrinos of larger energies ( in average ) are responsible for it .",
    "flattening out of the constraint curve @xmath387 with increase of @xmath168 is connected with the dependence @xmath389 . according to the relations ( [ c6],[g622],[l1 ] ) , the minimum value of pbh mass in the initial mass spectrum is inversely proportional to @xmath390 .",

    "thus , using the relation @xmath392 and the curves , corresponding to @xmath393 in fig.[fig : fig3 ] , one can see that in cases when @xmath394 the neutrino background is dominated by pbh evaporations during the radiation era .    introducing , as usual @xcite , the function @xmath395 by the formula @xmath396^{1/3 } \\ ; , \\ ] ] where @xmath397 is the age of the universe , one can easily see that at low @xmath168 ( before the flattening out of our @xmath387 curve ) the inequality @xmath398 takes place while at large @xmath168 one has @xmath399 .",
    "we remind that @xmath400 is the mass of a black hole , formed in the early universe and evaporating today .",
    "the turning - point ( i.e. , the point of a change of the slope of the @xmath387 curve ) corresponds to the equality @xmath401 and in the case @xmath402 it is at @xmath403 . the shift of this turning - point with an increase of @xmath193 is explained by the corresponding increase of an age of the universe : @xmath404    one can compare our spectral index constraints with the corresponding results of ref .",
    "@xcite , where the same initial mass spectrum of pbhs had been used .",
    "some difference in resulting constraints ( @xmath405 ) may be connected simply with the fact that authors of ref .",
    "@xcite use slightly different formula for @xmath380 , namely , @xmath406 in other respects the constraints are quite similar although in ref .",
    "@xcite they were based on diffuse extragalactic photon background data .",
    "one should note that usually the calculations of these constraints are accompanied by the calculation of the bounds based on requirement that the energy density in pbhs does not overclose the universe at any epoch ( @xmath407 ) . for",
    "a setting of such bounds one must consider the cosmological evolution of the system pbhs + radiation .",
    "we intend to carry out these calculations in a separate paper .",
    "estimates show that at large @xmath168 values ( @xmath408 ) the constraints based on @xmath409 are stronger than those based on the neutrino experiments ( it is the reason why we did not explore the region @xmath410 in the present paper ) .",
    "the neutrino background spectra obtained in the present paper may be useful somewhere else , irrespective of the spectral index constraint problem .",
    "the main feature of such spectra at @xmath411 and at @xmath412 is the very small contribution ( @xmath413 ) of all secondary channels of the neutrino production at evaporation ( except the decay of directly evaporated muons ) ( see fig.[fig : fig4ab ] ) .",
    "there are two reasons for this : the steepness of the initial pbh mass spectrum and , most essentially , the existence in our model the cut off in this spectrum , i.e. , the minimum pbh mass value",
    ". evaporation of pbhs having masses near @xmath324 gives the dominant contribution in the background , so there is a strong maximum in @xmath101 distributions at low energies ( fig.[fig : fig3 ] ) .",
    "for example , at @xmath414 the peak value of @xmath101 is @xmath415 .",
    "neutrino energy @xmath416 corresponds in this case to energy at evaporation @xmath417 .",
    "for an evaporation of such high energy neutrinos the pbh mass must be @xmath418 in the case of direct neutrinos and much smaller in the case of secondary neutrinos ( because their energies are much lower in average ( see fig.[fig : fig2 ] ) ) . at the same time , the minimum value of pbh mass in the mass spectrum at @xmath414 is @xmath419 .",
    "so , it should be clear that , in our example , the secondary neutrinos with @xmath322 can appear only after the essential evolution of the initial pbh mass spectrum ( see eq.([311 ] ) and the detailed discussion of this evolution in ref.@xcite ) .",
    "this evolution leads to an increase of the total mass interval and to the corresponding decrease of a pbh number density ( per unit mass interval ) and , as a result , to a relative smallness of the secondary neutrino flux .",
    "one can compare our results for the neutrino background spectra with those of ref.@xcite . according to the conclusions of ref.@xcite , the secondary neutrino fluxes are larger relatively and even dominant at @xmath420 .",
    "similar results were obtained in earlier work @xcite . in our model",
    "the dominance of secondary neutrino fluxes at @xmath421 takes place at some values of @xmath168 only ( see fig.[fig : fig10 ] ) .    the results for neutrino diffuse background spectra and the constraints on the spectral index obtained here do not take into account the possible existence of the photospheres @xcite around a black hole .",
    "in studies of photon background spectra two kinds of photospheres should be considered : * qcd * photosphere ( quark - gluon plasma arising from interactions of quarks and gluons before hadronization ) and * qed * photosphere ( @xmath422 plasma , in which directly evaporated photons are processed ) . as for",
    "the latter , in our case one should consider instead the `` electroweak ( or neutrino ) photosphere ''  @xcite which may form only at extremely high black hole temperatures and , probably , has no influence on the background spectra . * qcd * photosphere may be more important for the problem .",
    "thus , the recent calculations @xcite of instantaneous photon spectra from the model * qcd * photosphere show that some increase of photon fluxes ( in comparison with the usual case when * qcd * photosphere does not form and photons appear simply through the direct quark fragmentations with subsequent @xmath423-decays ) definitely takes place .",
    "for example , according to these calculations , at @xmath424 the peak value of instantaneous photon spectrum increases on a factor @xmath425 .",
    "if it is true and if this increase is the same at all black hole temperatures , the contribution to neutrino background spectra from the quark fragmentations obtained in our calculations must be increased approximately on the same factor .",

    "<S> we calculated the energy spectra and the fluxes of electron neutrinos in extragalactic space emitted in the process of the evaporation of primordial black holes ( pbhs ) in the early universe . </S>",
    "<S> it was assumed that pbhs are formed by a blue power - law spectrum of primordial density fluctuations . in the calculations of neutrino spectra </S>",
    "<S> the spectral index of density fluctuations and the reheating temperature were used as free parameters . </S>",
    "<S> the absorption of neutrinos during propagation in the space was taken into account . </S>",
    "<S> we obtained the bounds on the spectral index assuming validity of the standard picture of gravitational collapse and using the available data of several experiments with atmospheric and solar neutrinos . </S>",
    "<S> the comparison of our results with the previous constraints ( which had been obtained using diffuse photon background data ) shows that such bounds are quite sensitive to an assumed form of the initial pbh mass function . </S>"
