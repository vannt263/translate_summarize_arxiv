    "we have performed a deep x - ray survey ( @xmath0  ms ) of the hubble deep field north (; williams et  al .",
    "1996 , hereafter w96 ; ferguson , dickinson , & williams 2000 ) and its environs with the _ chandra x - ray observatory _ ( hereafter ): the  deep field north ( hereafter cdf - n ) survey .",
    "this is one of the two deepest x - ray surveys ever conducted , the other being the  deep field south survey ( e.g. , tozzi et  al . 2001 ; p.  rosati et  al .",
    ", in preparation ) .",
    "near the aim point , the cdf - n observation reaches 0.52.0  kev and 28  kev limiting fluxes of @xmath3  erg  @xmath4  s@xmath5 and @xmath6  erg  @xmath4  s@xmath5 , respectively ; these flux limits are @xmath12 and @xmath13 times fainter than achieved by pre-  missions . in figure  1",
    "we compare the 0.52.0  kev flux limit and solid angle of this survey to those of several other extragalactic x - ray surveys .",
    "this survey has both the sensitivity and positional accuracy needed to complement the deepest surveys at other wavelengths , and much of the @xmath1  arcmin@xmath2 area surveyed has extensive radio , submillimeter , infrared , and optical coverage ( see livio , fall , & madau 1998 and ferguson et  al .",
    "2000 for reviews ) .",
    "the main goals of the cdf - n survey are ( 1 ) to understand the broad - band emission and nature of the sources producing the x - ray background in the 0.58.0  kev band , and ( 2 ) to investigate the x - ray emission properties of physically interesting sources identified at other wavelengths .",
    "thus far , we have presented results for the hdf - n ( hornschemeier et  al .",
    "2000 , hereafter paper  i ; brandt et  al .",
    "2001a , paper  iv ) as well as for larger fields centered on the hdf - n ( hornschemeier et  al .",

    "all observations of the cdf - n field were performed with the advanced ccd imaging spectrometer ( acis ; g.p .",
    "garmire et  al . , in preparation ) on   ( weisskopf et  al .",
    "acis consists of ten ccds designed for efficient x - ray detection and spectroscopy .",
    "four of the ccds ( acis - i ; ccds i0i3 ) are arranged in a @xmath26 array with each ccd tipped slightly to approximate the curved focal surface of the  high resolution mirror assembly ( hrma ) .",
    "the remaining six ccds ( acis - s ; ccds s0s5 ) are set in a linear array and are tipped to approximate the rowland circle of the objective gratings that can be inserted behind the hrma .",
    "the ccd which lies on - axis in acis - i is i3 , and the full acis - i field of view is @xmath27 .",

    "2000 ; m.  karovska and p.  zhao 2001 , private communication ) .",
    "note that at higher energies the aim - point psf is significantly broader than at 1.5  kev .",
    "the cdf - n was observed in twelve separate observations as detailed in table  1 .",
    "the total exposure time was 975.3  ks .",
    "the hdf - n was placed near the aim point of the acis - i array during all observations , and care was taken to keep the hdf - n away from the gaps between the ccds .",
    "the focal - plane temperature , which governs several characteristics of the ccd behavior , in particular the charge transfer inefficiency ( cti ) , was @xmath34c during the first three observations and @xmath35c during the others .",
    "when observing with acis - i , two ccds from acis - s , typically s2 and s3 , can be operated .",
    "ccd s3 was turned off during the hdf - n observations due to the higher background level of this device ; this property could cause telemetry saturation during background flares .",
    "ccd s2 , however , was operated .",
    "the region covered by the  observations is considerably larger than @xmath27 due to the different observation pointings and roll angles ( see table  1 ) .",
    "these variations were necessary to satisfy the roll constraints of  while keeping the hdf - n itself near the aim point and away from the gaps between the ccds .",
    "the average aim point , weighted by exposure time , is @xmath18  12@xmath19 36@xmath20 @xmath36 , @xmath21  @xmath2213@xmath2353@xmath7 .",
    "the aim points of the individual observations are separated from the average aim point by @xmath37@xmath38 ; most are within @xmath39 of the average aim point .",
    "due to the large off - axis angle of ccd s2 during these observations ,",
    "it has low sensitivity . therefore , we only include data from s2 when these data overlap part of the sky also covered by acis - i in other observations .",
    "background light curves have been inspected for all of the observations .",
    "all but one are free from strong flaring due to `` space weather '' and are stable to within @xmath40% .",
    "the only observation with substantial flaring is 2344 ; during @xmath41  ks of this observation the background was @xmath42 times higher than nominal .",
    "however , the data quality during the flaring was still sufficiently high to provide useful scientific information so these data were not excluded ; the exclusion of these data would have little impact on the analysis or results presented here .",
    "the versions of the  x - ray center ( hereafter cxc ) pipeline software used for basic processing of the data are listed in table  1 . in the reduction and analysis below ,  interactive analysis of observations ( ciao )",
    "version  2 tools were used whenever possible .",
    "tools for acis real - time analysis ( tara ; broos et  al .",
    "2000 ) and custom software were also used .",
    "all data were corrected for the radiation damage sustained by the ccds during the first few months of  operations using the procedure of townsley et  al .",
    "this procedure partially corrects for the positionally dependent grade distribution due to inefficient charge transfer in the radiation - damaged ccds .",
    "it also partially corrects for quantum efficiency losses , which are most significant in data acquired at @xmath43c ( see townsley et  al .",
    "2000 and paper  ii for discussion of the remaining small quantum efficiency losses incurred ) .",
    "we have removed bad columns , bad pixels , and cosmic ray afterglows as flagged by the cxc using the `` status '' information in the event files .",
    "we have only used data taken during times within the cxc - generated good - time intervals .",
    "the standard pixel randomization was removed as part of the aspect correction procedure described in  3.1 .",
    "in this paper we report on the emission detected in four standard x - ray bands : 0.58.0  kev ( full band ) , 0.52.0  kev ( soft band ) , 28  kev ( hard band ) and 48  kev ( ultrahard band ) .",
    "we have adopted 8  kev ( rather than the often - used 10  kev ) as the full - band , hard - band , and ultrahard - band maximum energy because from 810  kev the effective area of the hrma is steeply decreasing with energy while the background is increasing .",
    "inspection and searching of the data revealed no significant sources in the 810  kev band .",
    "we have employed the two grade sets defined in table  2 . as described in paper  iv , the use of the `` restricted acis grade set '' in addition to the `` standard  grade set '' improves our ability to detect faint sources in some cases .",
    "all photometry below , however , is reported using the standard  grade set .",
    "we have registered the data sets following  3.1 of paper  ii .",
    "briefly , we registered all the data sets to the coordinate frame of observation 966 using 1117 bright x - ray sources detected in the individual observations within @xmath44 of the aim point ; registration is accurate to within @xmath45 .",
    "absolute x - ray source positions were obtained by matching 72 sources from the registered total data set to 1.4  ghz radio sources detected by richards ( 2000 ) ; these 1.4  ghz sources have accurate ( @xmath46 ) positions , and the 1.4  ghz coverage encompasses the entire  field .",
    "comparison with these sources allowed us to remove shift , rotation , and plate - scale effects .",
    "positions used in the data set registration and absolute astrometry determination were found using the wavelet - based source detection algorithm wavdetect ( dobrzycki et  al .",
    "1999 ; freeman et  al .",
    "2001 ) following  3.2.1 .",
    "figure  2 shows the accuracy of our astrometric solution by matching the full - band  sources presented in  3.2.1 with 1.4  ghz sources from richards ( 2000 ) .",
    "there are 241 1.4  ghz sources within the  field . in the matching , we consider only the 74  sources that match with 1.4  ghz sources to within @xmath47 ( the 72 sources used to determine the absolute astrometry in the previous paragraph excluded the two outliers in figure  2 with offsets @xmath48 ) .",
    "the vast majority of these 74 matches are expected to be correct , but @xmath42 are expected to be false matches .",
    "we also note that in some cases the x - ray source may be offset from the radio source even though both are associated with the same galaxy ( e.g. , a galaxy with a radio - emitting nuclear starburst that also has an off - nuclear `` super - eddington '' x - ray binary ) .",
    "figure  2 shows that the x - ray positions are usually good to within @xmath49 for off - axis angles @xmath50 . at larger off - axis angles , where the hrma point spread function ( psf ) rapidly broadens and becomes complex , the positional accuracy , as expected , degrades .",
    "most sources have positions good to within @xmath51 , but positional offsets up to @xmath52  1520 are possible .",
    "we do not find any systematic errors in our astrometric solution larger than @xmath53 in size .    in figures  3 and 4",
    "we show raw and adaptively smoothed images of our field in each of the four standard x - ray bands .",
    "these images have been made using the standard  grade set .",
    "the adaptively smoothed images have been corrected for spatial variations of the effective exposure time using the exposure maps described below .",
    "the exposure maps were adaptively smoothed using the same `` scale maps '' as for the images themselves , and we excluded regions where the adaptively smoothed effective exposure time was less than 50  ks .",
    "the adaptively smoothed images were not used for source detection , but they do show many of the detected x - ray sources more clearly than the raw images . note that some of the sources discussed below are not visible in the adaptively smoothed images ; these sources fall below the significance level of the adaptive smoothing used to make the images . in figure  5",
    "we show a color composite of the adaptively smoothed soft - band , hard - band and ultrahard - band images .",
    "soft sources appear red , moderately hard sources appear green , and the hardest sources appear blue . in figure  6",
    "we show an adaptively smoothed full - band image of the hdf - n itself and its immediate environs ; this image will be discussed further in  3.2.3 .",
    "we have made maps of effective exposure time , defined as the equivalent amount of exposure time for a source located at the aim point , following the basic procedure described in  3.2 of paper  ii ( see figure  7 ) .",
    "these `` exposure maps '' take into account the effects of vignetting , gaps between the ccds , bad column filtering , and bad pixel filtering .",
    "one exposure map has been created for each of the standard bands , and the maps were sampled every fourth pixel in both right ascension and declination . in creating these ,",
    "we have assumed a typical power - law spectrum with a photon index of @xmath54 ( this is the slope of the x - ray background in the  band ) . in figure  8",
    "we show a cumulative plot of the survey solid angle as a function of effective exposure in the full band .",
    "point - source detection in each standard band was performed with wavdetect .",
    "wavdetect was run using a `` @xmath55  sequence '' of wavelet scales ; scales of 1 , @xmath55 , 2 , @xmath56 , 4 , @xmath57 , and 8 pixels were used .",
    "we found this choice of wavelet scales to give the best overall performance across the field , but we will also discuss the results for larger wavelet scales in  3.2.2 . in the wavdetect source detection the average aim point defined in  2.2 was used when calculating off - axis angles .",
    "our key criterion for source detection is that a source must be found with a false - positive probability threshold of @xmath58 in at least one of the four standard bands using either the standard  or restricted acis grade sets .",
    "we have _ not _ run wavdetect with a low false - positive probability threshold and then performed _ ex post facto _ processing of the detected sources to attempt to separate true from spurious detections ; such a process would be subjective and counter to the philosophy of wavdetect ( freeman et  al .",
    "2001 ; p.e .",
    "freeman 2001 , private communication ) .",
    "our detection criterion is fairly conservative ; fainter but real sources are undoubtedly present in the field .",
    "however , our work on the cdf - n data thus far shows that we have struck an appropriate balance between sensitivity and source reliability .    conservatively treating the eight images searched as entirely independent , @xmath59",
    "false sources are expected statistically for the case of a uniform background .",
    "in reality , the background is far from uniform due to the large variation of effective exposure time across the field ( see figure  7 ) .",
    "in addition , the background increases near bright point sources due to the psf `` wings . ''",
    "it is difficult to quantify precisely the effects of a non - uniform background upon the performance of wavdetect .",
    "however , based upon the amount of area where background gradients are present and inspection of the sources detected in this area , we would not expect the number of false sources to be increased by more than a factor of @xmath60  23 .",
    "less than @xmath61% of the sources discussed below should be false .",
    "extensive analysis of the wavdetect source positions revealed that a significant fraction of the sources at off - axis angles @xmath62 suffered from centroiding errors of @xmath63@xmath64 .",
    "these apparently arise as a result of both limitations in the wavdetect centroiding method as well as the fact that there is not a single   psf applicable for any given source ( due to the different observation pointings and roll angles described in  2.2 , the spatial profile of any given point source is the superposition of several   psfs ) .",
    "testing and consultation with the cxc showed that the wavdetect centroiding could be significantly improved by running wavdetect without information about the  psf ( p.e .",
    "freeman and d.e .",
    "harris 2001 , private communication ) .",
    "therefore , in as many cases as possible , we have replaced the original wavdetect source positions with those from wavdetect runs made excluding psf information ; note that these `` no - psf '' runs were only used for positional replacement and not for source detection .",
    "positional replacement was performed for 86% of the detected sources ; for the remaining sources it was not possible due to either a non - detection or a multiple detection in the the no - psf run . the average positional improvement was @xmath65 but in some cases was as large as @xmath66 ( as determined by matching with richards 2000 sources at 1.4  ghz ) .",
    "wavdetect was also used to search the standard - band images for lower - significance , cross - band counterparts to the highly significant sources already detected at the @xmath58 level in at least one of the four bands ; in these runs we used a false - positive probability threshold of @xmath67 .",
    "we found 110 cross - band counterparts in this manner . since the spatial - matching requirement greatly reduces the number of pixels being searched , the statistically expected number of false cross - band matches is small ( @xmath68 ) .",
    "all of the standard - band source lists created in the source detection described above were merged to create the point - source catalog given as table  3 . for cross - band matching ,",
    "a matching radius of @xmath69 was used for sources within @xmath70 of the average aim point . for larger off - axis angles ,",
    "a matching radius of @xmath71 was used .",
    "these matching radii were chosen based on inspection of histograms showing the number of matches obtained as a function of angular separation ( see  2 of boller et  al .",
    "1998 ) ; with these radii the mismatch probability is @xmath0% over the entire field .",
    "manual correction of the wavdetect results was required in several cases .",
    "for example , wavdetect detections of the brightest components of highly extended sources were removed since these sources will be discussed separately in  3.3 . in four cases ,",
    "we have removed sources whose centroids appear to lie outside the field of view ; wavdetect had only detected the psf wings of these sources , and their positions and count rates are not well defined .",
    "manual separation of a few close doubles was required , and we have manually determined the position of each separated source .",
    "these sources suffer larger photometric errors due to the difficulty of the separation process .",
    "it was also necessary to perform manual photometry for two sources near the edge of the field of view and a few faint sources located close to much brighter sources .",
    "we have flagged all sources requiring manual correction in column  16 of table  3 ( see below ) .",
    "below we explain the columns in table  3 .",
    "* column  1 gives the source number .",
    "sources are listed in order of right ascension .",
    "* columns  2 and 3 give the right ascension and declination , respectively .",
    "these positions have been determined by wavdetect when possible .",
    "whenever possible , we quote the position determined in the full band ; when a source is not detected in the full band we use , in order of priority , the soft - band position , hard - band position , or ultrahard - band position . in addition",
    ", we adopt a soft - band position from a no - psf run over a full - band position when full - band positional replacement from a no - psf run was not possible ( see above ) .",
    "the priority ordering of position choices above was designed to generally maximize the signal - to - noise of the data being used for positional determination .",
    "to avoid truncation error , we quote the positions to higher precision than in the international astronomical union approved names beginning with the acronym `` cxo  hdfn . '' * column  4 gives the positional error .",
    "sources within @xmath72 of the average aim point have positional errors of @xmath73 .",
    "sources farther than @xmath72 from the average aim point have positional errors given by the empirically determined equation : + @xmath74 + where @xmath75 is the positional error in arcsec and @xmath76 is the off - axis angle in arcmin ( compare with figure  2 ) . the positional error does not appear to be a strong function of the number of source counts ( although a mild dependence is probably present ) ; this is largely due to the relatively sharp core of the  psf .",
    "the stated positional errors are for @xmath8% confidence , and the accuracy of our astrometric solution is discussed in  3.1 . *",
    "columns  58 give the counts in the four standard bands ; here and hereafter `` fb '' indicates full band , `` sb '' indicates soft band , `` hb '' indicates hard band , and `` uhb '' indicates ultrahard band .",
    "all values are for the standard  grade set , and they have not been corrected for vignetting .",
    "source counts and @xmath77 statistical errors ( from gehrels 1986 ) have been calculated using circular aperture photometry ; extensive testing showed this method to be more reliable than the wavdetect photometry .",
    "the circular aperture was centered at the position given in columns 2 and 3 for all bands .",
    "a source - free local background has been subtracted , and unexposed regions were masked .",
    "+ for sources with fewer than 1000 full - band counts , we have chosen the aperture radii based on the encircled - energy function of the  psf as determined using the cxc s mkpsf software ( feigelson et  al .",
    "2000 ; jerius et  al .",
    "2000 ; m.  karovska and p.  zhao 2001 , private communication ) . in the soft band where the image quality is the best ,",
    "the aperture radius was set to the 95% encircled - energy radius of the psf , and in the other bands the 90% encircled - energy radius of the psf was used .",
    "appropriate aperture corrections were applied to the source counts .",
    "+ for sources with more than 1000 full - band counts , systematic errors in the aperture corrections often exceed the expected errors from photon statistics when the apertures described in the previous paragraph are used .",
    "therefore , for such sources we used larger apertures to minimize the importance of the aperture corrections ; this is appropriate since these bright sources dominate over the background .",
    "we set the aperture radii to be twice those used in the previous paragraph and manually inspected these sources to verify that the measurements were not contaminated by neighboring objects .",
    "+ we have performed several consistency checks to verify the quality of the photometry .",
    "for example , we have checked that the sum of the counts measured in the soft and hard bands does not differ from the counts measured in the full band by an amount larger than that expected from measurement error .",
    "systematic errors in our photometry are estimated to be @xmath78% .",
    "photometry more accurate than this will require improved modeling of the  psf at large off - axis angles by the cxc ( m.  karovska and p.",
    "zhao 2001 , private communication ) as well as detailed treatment of the fact that there is not a single  psf applicable for any given source ( due to the different observation pointings and roll angles described in  2.2 ) .",
    "in addition , it will probably be necessary to make the aperture corrections for each source dependent upon its spectral shape .",
    "+ we have verified that the cosmic ray afterglow removal procedure ( see  2.3 ) has not led to significant systematic photometric errors . due to the low count rates of our sources ,",
    "incident x - ray photons are almost never incorrectly flagged as afterglow events .",
    "+ when a source is not detected in a given band , an upper limit is calculated .",
    "all upper limits are determined using circular apertures as above . when the number of counts in the aperture is @xmath79 , the upper limit is calculated using the bayesian method of kraft , burrows , & nousek ( 1991 ) for 95% confidence .",
    "the uniform prior used by these authors results in fairly conservative upper limits ( see bickel 1992 ) , and other reasonable choices of priors do not materially change our scientific results . for larger numbers of counts in the aperture ,",

    "note that the error distribution is not gaussian when the number of counts is small .",
    "quoted band ratios have been corrected for differential vignetting between the hard band and soft band using the appropriate exposure maps .",
    "* column  10 gives the effective photon index ( @xmath81 ) for a power - law model with the galactic column density .",

    "the sources generally become harder at low soft - band count rates , although there is substantial dispersion . at the lowest soft - band count rates , the source population is heterogeneous ; highly absorbed agn , high - redshift agn , low - luminosity agn , starburst galaxies , and normal galaxies all appear to make significant contributions ( e.g. , paper  ii ; paper  iv ; paper  vi ; tozzi et  al .",
    "understanding in detail the nature and relative contributions of the source populations represented in figure  12 will require extensive optical spectroscopic and multiwavelength follow - up studies .",
    "we have inspected the sources in table  3 for spatial extent , and they are generally consistent with being pointlike ( see figure  11 ) .",
    "the constraints on spatial extent are 2040% worse than for a single acis - i observation because , due to the different observation pointings and roll angles described in  2.2 , there is not a single  psf applicable for any given source .",
    "the constraints at off - axis angles of @xmath88 are also substantially tighter than those at larger off - axis angles . spatially extended sources are discussed in  3.3 .    in table  4",
    "we summarize the source detections in the four standard bands , and in table  5 we summarize the number of sources detected in one band but not another .",
    "our faintest soft - band sources have @xmath89 counts ( about one every 1.8 days ) , and our faintest hard - band sources have @xmath90 counts ; these sources are detected near the aim point . for a @xmath54 power - law model with the galactic column density ,",
    "the corresponding 0.52.0  kev and 28  kev flux limits are @xmath91  erg  @xmath4  s@xmath5 and @xmath92  erg  @xmath4  s@xmath5 , respectively .",
    "of course , these flux limits vary across the field of view . using the restricted acis grade set , the background level in our region of highest exposure ( see figures  7 and 8) is @xmath93  count  pixel@xmath5 in the soft band and @xmath94  count  pixel@xmath5 in the hard band . in both of these bands we are far from being background limited for point source detection near the aim point .",
    "unfortunately , there is no single choice of wavelet scales in wavdetect that provides perfect performance across an entire  field ( freeman et  al .",
    "2001 ; p.e .",
    "freeman 2001 , private communication ) .",
    "compromises are required due to , for example , the dependence of the psf size and shape on off - axis angle .",
    "in addition , due to the different observation pointings and roll angles described in  2.2 , there is not a single  psf applicable for any given source in this particular field .",
    "the wavelet scales used in  3.2.1 have been empirically found to provide very good performance across most of the field , but adding further large wavelet scales ( e.g. , @xmath95 and 16 pixels ) can improve the detection effectiveness at large off - axis angles where the psf is broad .",
    "however , the addition of these scales can cause real sources at smaller off - axis angles to be missed due to the incorrect merging of two sources .",
    "in addition , the `` rejection rule '' of wavdetect , designed to suppress poisson fluctuations on scales smaller than the psf , has limitations that can cause incorrect source rejections when large wavelet scales are employed ( see  3.2.3 of freeman et  al .",
    "2001 ; p.e .",
    "freeman 2001 , private communication ) .",
    "for example , incorrect source rejections may occur when only the relatively sharp core of the psf is apparent above the background level .    to address this issue and provide the best possible performance at large off - axis angles ,",
    "we have created a supplementary catalog of 11 additional sources found by wavdetect at large off - axis angles when wavelet scales of @xmath95 and 16 pixels are added to those used in  3.2.1 ( see table  6 ) .",
    "we have followed the same basic methodology as was used when making the main catalog ( see  3.2.1 ) ; we have again adopted a false - positive probability threshold of @xmath58 as the key criterion for source detection .",
    "the catalog columns are the same as for the main catalog . because the resulting sources tend to be the weakest ones detectable at the largest off - axis angles , their properties are in general less well defined than those of the sources in the main catalog .",
    "we have manually inspected these sources to confirm their reality .",
    "a comparison of the  sources detected in the hdf - n here and in paper  iv gives good agreement .",
    "all but one of the 12 sources detected in paper  iv are detected here as well .",
    "the one source not detected here is cxohdfn  j123643.9 + 621249 ; this faint source is known to be variable ( see paper  iv ) and has dropped in flux , leading to a reduced signal - to - noise ratio in the longer observation .",
    "there is still a notable positive fluctuation at the location of cxohdfn  j123643.9 + 621249 ( see figure  6 ) , and it is detected in the soft band if wavdetect is run with a false - positive probability threshold of @xmath96 .",
    "one other small difference from paper  iv is that the position of cxohdfn  j123649.4 + 621347 has moved closer to the nucleus of its @xmath97 elliptical host galaxy ( see  3.1 of paper  iv ) ; it is no longer clear that this faint x - ray source lies outside the nucleus .    with the additional data presented here , two new hdf - n x",
    "- ray sources have been discovered : cxohdfn  j123656.6 + 621245 and cxohdfn  j123657.4 + 621210 .",
    "both sources appear to be associated with optically bright hdf - n galaxies , extending the trend noted in paper  iv .",
    "the first is w96 source 3 - 610.1 at @xmath98 ( cohen et  al .",
    "2000 ) , one of the optically brightest ( @xmath99 ) spirals in the hdf - n .",
    "the second is w96 source 3 - 965.0 at @xmath100 ( cohen et  al . 2000 ) , a bright ( @xmath101 ) elliptical near the edge of the hdf - n .",
    "the full - band x - ray luminosities of these galaxies of @xmath102  erg  s@xmath5 and @xmath103  erg  s@xmath5 , respectively , can be explained via either low - luminosity agn or stellar remnants ( e.g. , x - ray binaries ) .",
    "both of these galaxies were included in the stacking analysis of paper  iv , and their individual detections with additional data support the validity of the stacking analysis .",
    "we note that there are several other positive fluctuations in the hdf - n visible in figure  6 .",
    "while some of these align with bright hdf - n galaxies ( e.g. , the positive fluctuation near @xmath18  12@xmath19 36@xmath20 528 , @xmath21  @xmath2213@xmath2354@xmath7 aligns with w96 source 2 - 736.0 , a @xmath104 irregular ) and may well be real , they are not formally detected according to the criteria in  3.2.1 and will not be discussed further here .",
    "we have calculated cumulative number counts , @xmath105 , for the soft and hard bands using the data in table  3 and the basic method described in gioia et  al .",
    "the results are shown in figure  13 , along with some results from  and .",
    "the cdf - n number counts do not extend to higher fluxes due to the limited number of bright sources available in our data .",
    "we have been conservative in our source selection , taking several steps to prevent incompleteness ( due to the varying sensitivity as a function of spatial position ) from affecting the @xmath105 curves .",
    "to avoid incompleteness in the soft band , we have only used data which satisfy the soft - band requirements in table  7 on ( 1 ) distance from the average aim point and ( 2 ) soft - band effective exposure time .",
    "the second requirement has the effect of removing areas affected by the gaps between the ccds , where incompleteness is difficult to assess ( see figure  7 ) . in table  7",
    "we also list the solid angle satisfying the above requirements .",
