    "a particularly interesting aspect of the physics programme of the @xmath15 factories for the exploration of the kobayashi  maskawa mechanism of cp violation @xcite is given by @xmath1 and @xmath4 modes ( see @xcite and references therein ) . in the summer of 2003 , the last missing element of the @xmath1 system , @xmath16 , was eventually observed by the babar  @xcite and belle collaborations @xcite , with a surprisingly prominent rate , pointing to large corrections to the predictions of the qcd factorization approach @xcite . concerning the @xmath4 system , the last missing transition , @xmath17 , was already observed by the cleo collaboration in 2000 @xcite , and is now well established . immediately after that measurement , a puzzling pattern in the ratios @xmath2 and",
    "@xmath3 of the charged and neutral @xmath4 rates has been pointed out @xcite .",
    "this `` @xmath4 puzzle '' has survived over the years and was recently reconsidered by several authors ( see , for instance , @xcite ) .",
    "it is an important feature of the observables @xmath2 and @xmath3 that they are significantly affected by ( colour - allowed ) electroweak ( ew ) penguins @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the ratio @xmath8 of the cp - averaged @xmath5 and @xmath9 branching ratios , which is expected to be only marginally affected by ( colour - suppressed ) ew penguins , does not show an anomalous behaviour . since ew penguins",
    "offer an attractive avenue for new physics ( np ) to manifest itself @xcite , the @xmath4 puzzle may indicate np in the ew penguin sector .",
    "should this actually be the case , also several rare @xmath18 and @xmath15 decays may show np effects @xcite , thereby complementing the @xmath4 puzzle in a valuable manner .    in @xcite , we developed a strategy to address these exciting issues systematically , with the following logical structure :    * using the isospin flavour symmetry of strong interactions and assuming the range for the angle @xmath19 of the unitarity triangle ( ut ) that follows in the standard model ( sm ) from the ckm fits @xcite , we may extract a set of hadronic parameters characterizing the @xmath1 system from the experimental results for the corresponding cp - averaged branching ratios and the cp - violating observables of @xmath20 .",
    "we found large deviations of the hadronic parameters from the predictions of qcd factorization .",
    "moreover , we could predict the cp asymmetries of the @xmath7 decay in the sm . *",
    "if we use the @xmath21 flavour symmetry and neglect penguin annihilation and exchange topologies , which can be probed through @xmath22 and @xmath23 modes , the hadronic @xmath1 parameters allow us to determine their @xmath4 counterparts .",
    "assuming again the sm , as in the @xmath1 analysis , we may predict all observables offered by the @xmath4 system , including also cp asymmetries .",
    "we found agreement with the experimental picture for @xmath8 , whereas the situation in the @xmath3@xmath2 plane was _ not _ in accordance with experiment .",
    "this discrepancy could be resolved through np effects in the ew penguin sector , requiring a significant enhancement of the parameter @xmath24 measuring their strength relative to the tree contributions , and a np phase @xmath25 , which vanishes in the sm , around @xmath26 . * assuming a more specific ( but popular ) scenario @xcite@xcite , where np enters the ew penguin sector through @xmath27 penguins , system in a slightly different scenario involving an additional @xmath28 boson .",
    "] we obtain an interesting interplay between the parameters @xmath24 and @xmath25 following from the resolution of the @xmath4 puzzle and several rare @xmath15 and @xmath18 decays .",
    "this allowed us to explore the impact of the data for @xmath29 and @xmath30 processes , constraining the enhancement of @xmath24 to be smaller than that suggested by the @xmath4 data , thereby favouring a smaller value of @xmath2 and a larger value of @xmath3 .",
    "in fact , this pattern has been confirmed to a large extent by the new data .",
    "taking these constraints into account , there may still be prominent np effects in the rare - decay sector , the most spectacular ones in @xmath31 and @xmath32 , exhibiting branching ratios that could be enhanced with respect to the sm by factors of @xmath33 and @xmath34 , respectively .",
    "in addition , we discussed the determination of @xmath19 ( and the other two ut angles @xmath35 and @xmath36 ) , where we obtained a result in agreement with the ckm fits @xcite , had a closer look at the @xmath37-meson decays @xmath38 and @xmath39 , and performed a couple of consistency checks of the @xmath21 flavour symmetry , which did not indicate large corrections .",
    "as there were several exciting experimental developments thanks to the babar and belle collaborations since we wrote our original papers @xcite , it is interesting to confront our strategy with the most recent data , although the picture is still far from being settled .",
    "the most important aspects are the following :    * several new results for the @xmath1 and @xmath4 branching ratios @xcite@xcite . * first results for the direct cp asymmetry of @xmath7 @xcite .",
    "* updates for the cp - violating observables of @xmath20 @xcite , as well as for the cp asymmetries of several @xmath4 modes @xcite .",
    "* observation of direct cp violation in @xmath5 @xcite , representing a new milestone in the exploration of cp violation .",
    "some implications of this measurement have been discussed in @xcite and @xcite , concerning the sm and supersymmetry , respectively .",
    "* observation of @xmath40 , i.e.  of the first @xmath41 penguin decay , and an emerging signal for its charged counterpart @xmath10 @xcite .    in our analysis",
    ", we will use the averages for these new results that were compiled by the `` heavy flavour averaging group '' ( hfag ) @xcite , but also make a number of refinements and generalizations , in particular :    * we include the ew penguins of the @xmath42 system in our analysis . as anticipated in @xcite ,",
    "this has a small impact on the numerics , but is a conceptual improvement .",
    "* in view of the new @xmath43 data , we investigate the impact of certain hadronic effects , which can be constrained through the emerging experimental signal for @xmath10 decays .",
    "the outline is as follows : in section  [ sec : bpipi ] , we focus on the @xmath1 system and move on to the @xmath4 modes in section  [ sec : bpik ] .",

    "in contrast to our previous analysis @xcite , we shall also include the ew penguin contributions in the numerical analysis performed below .",

    "in fact , in our previous analysis , which was confronted with the experimental average of @xmath99 , we advocated that this cp asymmetry should go up , in full accordance with the babar result in ( [ acpdir - exps ] ) . despite the large value of @xmath93",

    "the remaining small numerical difference in the analysis of @xmath8 , if confirmed by future data , could be due to ( small ) effects of colour - suppressed ew penguins , which enter @xmath8 as well @xcite , and/or the limitations of our working hypothesis specified in subsection  [ ssec : bpik - pre ] .",
    "moreover , we would also not be surprised to see the experimental value of @xmath8 moving up in the future .",
    "let us now turn to the decays @xmath188 and @xmath189 , where ew penguins enter in colour - allowed form . in order to analyse these transitions ,",
    "it is particularly useful to introduce the following ratios : @xmath190\\ ] ] @xmath191,\\ ] ] i.e.  to consider separately the charged and neutral @xmath4 modes @xcite .",
    "the experimental situation of these quantities is summarized in table  [ tab : bpik - input1 ] .",

    "having the parameters in ( [ rhon - thetan - det ] ) and ( [ rc - deltac - det ] ) at hand , we may predict the values of @xmath2 and @xmath3 and of the cp - violating observables of @xmath9 , @xmath213 in the sm with the help of the formulae given in @xcite . in the case of the charged modes , we obtain @xmath214 @xmath215 where here ( and in the following ) the numbers with errors refer to @xmath216 , and the central value for the case @xmath145 , @xmath184 is given in brackets .",
    "we observe that the impact of @xmath138 on @xmath2 is significantly weaker than in the case of @xmath8 discussed in subsection  [ ssec : rhoc - analysis ] .",
    "this is due to the feature that @xmath138 enters @xmath8 already at @xmath217 , whereas it affects @xmath2 through second order terms of @xmath218 and @xmath219 @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , @xmath3 and the cp - violating observables of @xmath220 are _ not _ affected by @xmath138 , so that we obtain the following sm predictions : @xmath221 @xmath222    so far , we could accommodate all features of the @xmath15-factory data for the @xmath1 and @xmath4 modes in a satisfactory manner in the sm .",
    "now we observe that this is _ not _ the case for @xmath3 and  to a smaller extend  for @xmath2 . as we have emphasized above ,",
    "@xmath3 does _ not _ depend on @xmath138 , so this parameter can not be at the origin of this puzzle , in contrast to the case of @xmath8 , and has , moreover , a minor impact on @xmath2 .",
    "moreover , as we discussed in @xcite , the colour - suppressed ew penguin topologies have _ no _ impact on @xmath3 in our sm analysis , as they can be absorbed in a certain manner , but could affect @xmath2 .",
    "however , as we have seen in subsection  [ ssec : rhoc - analysis ] , the analysis of @xmath8 disfavours anomalously large contributions of this kind , in contrast to the claims made in @xcite . concerning @xmath21-breaking corrections , the agreement between ( [ acpdir - av ] ) and our sm prediction ( [ acp - pred ] ) , the successful confrontation of ( [ cp - rel ] ) with the data , and the emerging picture of the ut  in perfect accordance with the sm  discussed in subsection  [ ssec : ut - det ] do not indicate large corrections to ( [ r - det ] ) .",
    "moreover , the agreement between ( [ rc - deltac - det ] ) and ( [ rc - alt - det ] ) indicates that the leading @xmath21-breaking effects are indeed described by the corresponding factors in ( [ x - rel - su3 ] ) and ( [ rc - alt - det ] ) .",

    "the experimental ranges for @xmath2 and @xmath3 and those predicted in the sm are indicated in grey , the dashed lines serve as a reminder of the corresponding ranges in @xcite.[fig : rn - rc],width=453 ]      since @xmath3 and @xmath2 are significantly affected by ew penguins , it is an attractive possibility to assume that np enters through these topologies @xcite . in this case",
    ", the successful picture described above would not be disturbed . on the other hand ,",
    "we may obtain full agreement between the theoretical values of @xmath3 and @xmath2 and the data .",
    "following @xcite , we generalize the ew penguin parameter as @xmath227 where @xmath25 is a cp - violating weak phase that vanishes in the sm , i.e.  arises from np .",
    "we may then use the measured values of @xmath2 and @xmath3 to determine @xmath24 and @xmath25 , with the following results : @xmath228 @xmath229 where the numbers in brackets illustrate again the impact of @xmath145 , @xmath184 on the central values .",
    "although these hadronic parameters are not at the origin of the @xmath230 puzzle , as we have seen above , they have of course some impact on the extracted values of @xmath24 and @xmath25 , though the are not changing the overall picture .",
    "it is useful to consider the @xmath3@xmath2 plane , as we have done in fig .",
    "[ fig : rn - rc ] .",
    "there we show contours corresponding to different values of @xmath24 , and indicate the experimental and sm ranges .",
    "following @xcite , we choose the values of @xmath223 , @xmath231 and @xmath232 , where the latter reproduced the central values of @xmath2 and @xmath3 in our previous analysis @xcite .",
    "the central values for the sm prediction have hardly moved , while their uncertainties have been reduced a bit . on the other hand , the central experimental values of @xmath2 and",
    "@xmath3 have moved in such a way that @xmath24 decreased , while the weak phase @xmath25 remains around @xmath233 .",
    "moreover , we obtain the following cp asymmetries in our np scenario : @xmath234 @xmath235 although the central value of our prediction for @xmath236 has a sign different from the corresponding experimental number , this can not be considered as a problem because of the large current uncertainties . concerning the observables of the @xmath237 channel ,",
    "our prediction for the direct cp asymmetry is rather close to the experimental number , while the current experimental result for mixing - induced asymmetry is somewhat on the lower side .",
    "however , the uncertainties of these very challenging measurements are still too large to draw conclusions .    instead of using the value of @xmath238 in our analysis , which follows from the @xmath21 flavour symmetry",
    ", we could alternatively determine this strong phase , together with @xmath24 and @xmath25 , from a combined analysis of @xmath3 , @xmath2 and the direct cp asymmetry of the @xmath239 modes . in our previous analysis @xmath240 ,",
    "this led to small values of @xmath198 in perfect agreement with the picture following from the @xmath21 flavour symmetry . using the most recent data , we obtain @xmath241 where the values of @xmath24 and @xmath25 are practically unchanged from the numbers given in ( [ q - det ] ) and ( [ phi - det ] ) , respectively .",
    "the updated value in ( [ omega - det ] ) does still not favour dramatic @xmath21-breaking effects .",
    "finally , we would like to comment briefly on the direct cp asymmetry of the @xmath6 decays .",
    "it was argued in the recent literature ( see , for instance , @xcite ) that the discrepancy between the experimental values in ( [ acpdir - av ] ) and ( [ acp - bpi0k - def ] ) was very puzzling .",
    "however , our analysis shows nicely that this is actually not the case .",
    "in particular , we have the following expression @xcite : @xmath242,\\ ] ] where the @xmath138 terms are neglected for simplicity .",
    "consequently , the small value in ( [ acp - bpi0k - def ] ) follows simply from the small strong phase @xmath243 in ( [ rc - deltac - det ] ) . on the other hand , the hadronic parameters @xmath100 and @xmath93 governing @xmath92 take very different values , as we have seen in subsection  [ acp - dir - theo1 ] . the difference between the cp - violating @xmath239 and @xmath5 asymmetries can therefore be straightforwardly explained through hadronic effects within the sm , i.e.  does not require np .",
    "in this paper we have confronted our strategy for describing and correlating the @xmath1 , @xmath4 decays and rare @xmath18 and @xmath15 decays with the new data on @xmath1 , @xmath4 from babar and belle . within a simple np scenario of enhanced cp - violating ew penguins considered by us , the np contributions enter significantly only @xmath4 decays and rare @xmath18 and @xmath15 decays , while the @xmath1 system is practically unaffected by these contributions and can be described within the sm .",
    "consequently the pattern of relations between various observables is in our strategy very transparent in that    * the relations between @xmath1 and @xmath4 decays are strictly connected with the _ long - distance _ physics allowing us to calculate the hadronic parameters of the @xmath4 from the @xmath244 ones without the intervention of np contributions that enter at much shorter scales . * the relations between @xmath4 decays and rare",
    "@xmath18 and @xmath15 decays are strictly connected with the _ short - distance _ physics allowing us to predict several spectacular departures from the sm expectations for rare @xmath18 and @xmath15 decays from the corresponding significant departures from the sm observed in the @xmath4 data .",
    "the main messages from this new analysis are as follows :    * the present data for those observables in the @xmath1 and @xmath4 systems that are essentially unaffected by np in the ew penguins are not only in accordance with our approach , but a number of predictions made by us in @xcite have been confirmed by the new data within theoretical and experimental uncertainties .",
    "this is in particular the case of the direct cp asymmetry in @xmath245 but also in @xmath7 . for convenience of the reader",
    ", we collect all cp - violating quantities involved in our analysis in table [ asymtab ] and show the comparison of the experimental values with our predictions . * the observed decrease of the ratio @xmath8 below our expectations in @xcite can be partially attributed to certain hadronic effects , represented by the non - vanishing value of @xmath138 , that could be tested in @xmath10 decays once these are experimentally better known .",
    "in particular the sign of @xmath138 , which is more solid than its magnitude , points towards the decrease of @xmath8 relative to our previous estimate .",
    "however , our present understanding of these effects allows us to expect that future more accurate measurements will find @xmath8 higher than its present central value . *",
    "the decrease in the difference @xmath246 observed in the recent data of babar has been predicted by us on the basis of branching ratios for rare decays @xcite .",
    "this is explicitly seen in table 2 of @xcite . in this manner",
    "the overall description of @xmath247 , @xmath230 and rare decays within our approach has improved with respect to our previous analysis . *",
    "the picture of rare decays presented by us in @xcite remains unchanged , since the values of @xmath24 and @xmath25 obtained are still slightly above the bound from @xmath248 used in @xcite .",
    "in particular , the spectacular enhancement of @xmath249 as well as the enhancement of several other rare decays remain .",
    "further implications for rare decays in this scenario can be found in @xcite * last but certainly not least the obtained value of @xmath19 and the ut are in full agreement with the usual ckm fits .",
    "finally , we would like to comment on analyses using only the @xmath43 data .",
    "it has been claimed in @xcite that the puzzle concerning the @xmath250 system is significantly reduced or not even present .",
    "we would like to emphasize that a study of the @xmath4 decays alone is not very much constrained and consequently has a rather low resolution in search for np effects .",
    "such an analysis is moreover not satisfactory as it ignores the information on long distance dynamics that we have already from other non - leptonic decays , in particular from @xmath1 decays that are connected with the @xmath4 system through @xmath21 flavour symmetry .",
    "one should also not forget that , for a confrontation with the sm , the use of the @xmath21 flavour symmetry , which allows us to determine the ew penguin parameters @xmath24 and @xmath198 through ( [ q - sm ] ) , can not be avoided .",
    "consequently one may ask why the @xmath21 flavour symmetry should be used to find @xmath24 and not for getting the full input from @xmath1 and in the future from @xmath251 decays .    as demonstrated in @xcite and here , the use of the full information from the @xmath42 and @xmath43 systems allows us to uncover possible signals of np effects in @xmath43 decays that in turn change significantly the sm pattern of rare decay branching ratios . in this respect , we disagree with a statement made in @xcite that `` the data seem to disfavour np explanations , according to which np primarily modifies electroweak penguin contributions '' .",

    "let us note that the difference between ( [ acp - dir - bskk])([br - bskk ] ) and the corresponding numbers in @xcite is very small , whereas ( [ br - bskk - alt ] ) did not change at all .",

    "<S> recently , we developed a strategy to analyse the @xmath0 data . </S>",

    "<S> we obtain hadronic @xmath0 parameters which are almost unchanged and arrive at an allowed region for the unitarity triangle in perfect accordance with the sm . </S>",
    "<S> the `` @xmath4 puzzle '' persists , and can still be explained through np , as in our previous analysis . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , the recently observed shifts in the experimental values of @xmath2 and @xmath3 have been predicted in our framework on the basis of constraints from rare decays . </S>",
    "<S> conversely , we obtain a moderate deviation of the ratio @xmath8 of the cp - averaged @xmath5 and @xmath9 rates from the current experimental value . however , using the emerging signals for @xmath10 modes , this effect can be attributed to certain hadronic effects , which have a minor impact on @xmath2 and do not at all affect @xmath3 . </S>",
