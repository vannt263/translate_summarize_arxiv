    "ten years after abrikosov s classic prediction of a lattice of quantized vortices , the abrikosov vortex - line lattice ( vll ) , @xcite as the ground state of type - ii superconductors when the magnetic field is tuned beyond a lower critical value @xcite , gerd eilenberger suggested that the vll could melt close to the critical temperature of the system @xcite .",
    "the magnetic field versus temperature @xmath0-phase diagram of extreme type - ii superconductors has for some time been under intense investigation both theoretically and experimentally , following suggestions that the vll could undergo a melting transition in regime of the @xmath0-phase diagram of the high - temperature superconductor that could be experimentally resolved @xcite .",
    "this was soon confirmed by a more thorough theoretical analysis @xcite where it was shown that the vll of the high - temperature superconductors was particularly susceptible to thermal fluctuations due to the large anisotropy of these compounds .",
    "the anisotropy only affects the melting line of the vll when the pronounced nonlocal elastic properties of the vll in strong type - ii superconductors , first discussed for the isotropic case in the pioneering works of brandt @xcite , are taken into account @xcite .",
    "while it now appears well established both experimentally @xcite and theoretically for three dimensional vortex systems @xcite that the vll in the clean limit of type - ii superconductors melts in a first order phase - transition , much less consensus has been reached on how to describe the state which the vll melts into , even in the clean limit .",
    "only very recently has it been established , through numerical simulations @xcite that the vortex - liquid is always _ incoherent _ , i.e phase - coherence is destroyed in all direction , including the direction of the induction , as soon as the vll melts . inside the vortex - liquid _ regime",
    "_ , there is therefore no transition from a disentangled to an entangled vortex - liqiud .",
    "for such a transition to occur inside the vortex - liquid , the longitudinal superfluid density would have to be non - zero above the melting temperature .",
    "this however does not happen in the clean limit @xcite , even in the isotropic case @xcite .",
    "recently , questions have also been raised whether the vortex - line picture of the molten phase of the abrikosov vll is viable at all at low fields @xmath12 @xcite @xmath13@xcite .    in terms of fundamental physics ,",
    "extreme type - ii superconductors are interesting due to their large fluctuation effects not commonly seen in condensed matter systems .",
    "this is ultimately due to the fact that they are strong coupling superconductors arising out of doped mott - hubbard insulators .",
    "the latter fact gives rise to the effect that the phase - stiffness of the superconducting order parameter is low , due to a low value of the superfluid density @xmath14 @xmath15 where @xmath16 is a twist in the superconducting order parameter over the size of the system , and @xmath17 is the free energy density .",
    "this particular and important aspect of doped mott - hubbard insulators has been quite strongly emphasized already for some time @xcite , see also ref . .",
    "the strong coupling effect gives rise to a large @xmath8 , so that the ginzburg - landau parameter @xmath18 is large .",
    "this also softens the vortex matter in these systems , particularly when coupled with their strong layeredness @xcite .",
    "there is also a close connection between thermodynamic phase transitions in these systems , and phase - transitions in superfluids @xcite , liquid crystals @xcite , crystals @xcite , and cosmology @xcite . the close connection between these apparently different physical problems , is due to the similarity of the topological objects that appear in these problems . particularly in the context of superfluid @xmath19 , the proposition that an unbinding of topological phase - fluctuations in the form of vortex - loops is the microscopic mechanism for the superfluid - normal state transition , has been extensively studied in the past @xcite @xmath20@xcite , and early attempts at formulating a field - theory of this in the context of charged superfluids in zero magnetic field has also appeared in the literature @xcite .",
    "effective gauge - field theories with an internal @xmath9-symmetry all have in common that they support _ line - defect _ in the form of vortex - loop excitations as stable topological objects . understanding the role of such excitations on the @xmath0 phase - diagram of type - ii superconductors is an important problem in physics , and presumably will shed light on the related problems mentioned above as well .    in conventional low - temperature superconductors , the temperature where cooper pairs start to form , @xmath21 , is practically identical to the true superconducting transition temperature @xmath8 .",
    "the commonly applied ginzburg - criterion provides a useful estimate for the width of the critical regions in systems with weak fluctuation effects , showing that the width of the critical region is of order @xmath22 .",
    "a mean field description of the s - n phase transition is appropriate  for all practical purposes \" . in high-@xmath8 superconductors",
    ", this may no longer be the case .",
    "there appears to be mounting experimental evidence that the width of the critical region is as large as a few kelvin in ybco @xcite , which would encompass the melting line of the flux - line lattice up to a field of order @xmath23 @xcite .    in zero field",
    "the superconducting - normal phase transition is exclusively caused by a vortex loop unbinding @xcite .",
    "below the critical temperature @xmath8 vortex loops are confined to a typical perimeter @xmath24 , and cause only local disturbances in the macroscopic superconducting state .",
    "recently , this has been demonstrated clearly , by correlating an abrupt change in vortex tangle connectivity , a loss of vortex - line tension , loss of superfluid stiffness and specific heat anomaly precisely at the critical temperature of the superconductor , even for the isotropic case @xcite . at @xmath8 ,",
    "thermally induced vortex loops loose their effective line tension and therefore unbind .    in this scenario , at low fields , thermally induced vortex loops could conceivably interact strongly with field induced flux lines .",
    "this interaction is ignored in models using the line - only approximation , where the thermally induced vortex loops degrees of freedom are neglected , effectively being considered as irrelevant relativistic corrections in a corresponding @xmath25 quantum boson system .",
    "this model has met with considerable success in describing parts of the flux - line lattice melting curve at intermediate to elevated fields , where its position the phase - diagram as well as its dependence on anisotropy was explained using the lindemann - criterion @xcite . the melting line for fields of more than a few tesla",
    "is little affected by the vortex - loop unbinding , as pointed out recently @xcite .",
    "however , the question arises whether this is a tenable conclusion for low fields as well .",
    "the fact that the zero - field transition can be characterized precisely by a loss of line - tension of thermally induced flux lines , implies that there is a sharp change in the distribution function @xmath1 for vortex loops of a given perimeter @xmath2 .",
    "it changes from an exponential form @xmath26 to a power law @xmath27 at @xmath8 @xcite .",
    "this implies the existence of a diverging length scale @xmath28 @xcite .",
    "given this fact , it raises the question of whether the critical fluctuations can affect the melting line in a sizeable field - temperature regime , rendering the vortex lines tension - less .",
    "the vortex line tension is analagous to the mass of the bosons in a @xmath25 non - relativistic boson - analogy of the vortex system .",
    "if the vortex - line tension were to vanish , it would mean that the boson - mass wouild vanish in the corresponding analogy .",
    "there is no non - relativistic limit of any mass - less theory .",
    "the conclusion would be that any @xmath25 boson - model which is non - relativistic , is inapplicable in the part of the phase - diagram where the vortex - line tension vanishes .",
    "we reemphasize that at elevated fields , where the first order flux - line lattice melting line splits off from the new transition line proposed here , the lindemann - criterion of flux - line lattice melting @xcite is expected to correctly locate the position of the melting line @xcite .",
    "the outline of this paper is as follows . in section",
    "ii , we introduce the ginzburg - landau model studied in this paper , and various approximations and reformulations of it , as well as their inter - relations . in section",
    "iii we present the ideas underlying the simulations that are presented in this paper , and introduce and discuss the quantities we study . in section iv ,",
    "we present results of the simulations in zero magnetic field .",
    "_ in particular , we present results which demonstrate that the zero - field transition in an extreme type - ii superconductor is driven by a proliferation of unbound vortex loops , which therefore constitute the critical fluctuations of this system_. in section v , finite - field results are given .",
    "summary and conclusions are presented in section vi , and in this section we also list point by point the new results obtained in this paper .",
    "in this section we define the models considered in this paper : 1 ) the continuum ginzburg - landau model , 2 ) the lattice ginzburg - landau model in a frozen gauge approximation , and 3 ) the uniformly frustrated 3d xy model .",
    "we also discuss the approximations involved and the validity of the models .",
    "our starting point is the continuum ginzburg - landau ( gl ) model @xcite . in quantum field theory ,",
    "the gl model is also referred as the scalar qed or the @xmath9+higgs model or the abelian higgs model .",

    "the critical temperature @xmath8 where phase - coherence develops , is always smaller than @xmath21 ; the existence a finite copper - pair density does not imply that the system is in a superconducting state .",
    "later on , we shall recast the ginzburg - landau theory in a quite different form that also exhibts a @xmath9-symmetry , but where the field conjugate to the relevant phase is the number operator for the topological excitations destroying the order of the ginzburg - landau theory itself .",
    "although this may seem like an unnecessary complication , it has the advantage of facilitating a detailed discussion of the vortex - liquid phase of the gl - theory in terms of the ordering of some local field , namely the complex scalar field @xmath42 to be introduced and discussed in section iif .",
