    "a triangulation of a finite point set @xmath3 in the euclidean plane is a geometric simplicial complex covering @xmath4 whose vertex set is precisely @xmath5 .",
    "equivalently , it is a maximal non - crossing straight - edge graph with vertex set @xmath5 . in this paper",
    "we prove that a point set of cardinality @xmath0 can not have more than @xmath6 triangulations .",
    "an upper bound of type @xmath7 for this number is a consequence of the general results of @xcite .",
    "upper bounds of @xmath8 , @xmath9 and @xmath10 have been given , respectively , in @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the precise statement of our new upper bound is :    [ thm : main ] the number of triangulations of a planar point set is bounded above by @xmath11 where @xmath12 and @xmath13 denote the numbers of _ interior _ and _ boundary _ points , meaning by this points lying in the interior and the boundary of the convex hull , respectively .    in section [ sec : main ] we prove this result and in section [ sec : review ] we briefly review what is known about the maximum and minimum number of triangulations of point sets of fixed cardinality . in particular",
    ", we mention that every point set in general position has at least @xmath14 , as proved in @xcite . as a reference ,",
    "compare these upper and lower bounds to the number of triangulations of @xmath0 points in convex position , which is the catalan number @xmath15 .",
    "we will assume that our point set is in general position , i.e. , that no three of its points are collinear .",
    "this is no loss of generality because if @xmath5 is not in general position and we perturb it to a point set @xmath16 in general position without making boundary points go to the interior , then every triangulation of @xmath5 is a triangulation of @xmath16 as well . in particular , the maximum number of triangulations of planar point sets of given cardinality is achieved in general position .",
    "the same may not be true in higher dimension .",
    "for the proof of theorem  [ thm : main ] we will need the fact that the total number of vertices in a triangulation is bounded by a linear combination of the number of low - degree vertices :    [ lemma : euler ] let @xmath17 be a triangulation in the plane .",
    "for each integer @xmath18 , let @xmath19 denote the number of interior vertices of degree @xmath20 in @xmath17 .",
    "for each integer @xmath21 , let @xmath22 denote the number of boundary vertices of degree @xmath23 in @xmath17 .",
    "then @xmath24 and therefore @xmath25    let @xmath12 and @xmath13 be the numbers of interior and boundary vertices in @xmath17 , respectively .",
    "let @xmath26 and @xmath27 be the numbers of edges and triangles in @xmath17 . counting the edges of @xmath17 according to their incidences to triangles",
    "shows that @xmath28 .",
    "euler s formula says that @xmath29 .",
    "these two equations give : @xmath30 on the other hand , counting the edges of @xmath17 according to their incidences to vertices shows that @xmath31 substituting this into the previous equality and noting that @xmath32 and @xmath33 gives the first claimed equation . adding @xmath34 on both sides of this equality and dropping the negative summands on the left hand side yields the claimed inequality .",
    "let @xmath17 be a triangulation of @xmath5 and @xmath35 be one of its points .",
    "we say that a triangulation @xmath36 of @xmath37 is obtained by _ deleting @xmath38 from @xmath17 _ if all the edges of @xmath17 not incident to @xmath38 appear in @xmath36 . in the same situation",
    "we also say that @xmath17 is obtained by _ inserting @xmath38 into @xmath36_. observe that neither the deletion nor the insertion of a point into a triangulation is a unique process : more than one triangulation of @xmath16 can result from the deletion of @xmath38 from @xmath17 and more than one triangulation of @xmath16 can result from the insertion of @xmath38 into @xmath36 .",
    "however , these numbers can be bounded in terms of catalan numbers .",
    "[ lemma : delete ] let @xmath17 be a triangulation of @xmath5 and let @xmath38 be a vertex in @xmath5 with degree @xmath20 .",
    "the number of triangulations of @xmath39 that can be obtained from @xmath17 by deleting @xmath38 is at least 1 and at most @xmath40 .",
    "it suffices to note that the number in question is the number of ways in which the area formed by the intersection of @xmath41 and the triangles in @xmath17 incident to @xmath38 can be triangulated .",
    "[ lemma : insert ] let @xmath36 be a triangulation of @xmath42 . for each @xmath43 ,",
    "let @xmath44 be the number of triangulations of @xmath5 in which @xmath38 has degree @xmath20 and which can be obtained by inserting @xmath38 into @xmath36 .",
    "* if @xmath38 is an interior point of @xmath5 , then @xmath45 . in particular",
    "@xmath46 , @xmath47 , @xmath48 and @xmath49 .",
    "* if @xmath38 is a boundary point of @xmath5 , then @xmath50 .",
    "in particular @xmath51 , @xmath52 and @xmath53 .",
    "let us first assume that @xmath38 is interior .",
    "let @xmath54 be the triangle of @xmath36 that contains @xmath38 .",
    "after inserting @xmath38 with degree @xmath20 in @xmath36 , the union of the triangles incident to @xmath38 is a starshaped polygon @xmath55 , with @xmath38 in its kernel , with no other point of @xmath5 in its interior , and obtained as the union of @xmath56 triangles from @xmath36 .",
    "conversely , any polygon with those properties provides a way of inserting @xmath38 with degree @xmath20 .",
    "any triangle @xmath27 of @xmath36 in such a polygon will be _ visible _ from @xmath38 , meaning that @xmath57 contains no vertex of @xmath36 in its interior .",
    "let @xmath58 be the dual graph of @xmath36 , whose nodes are the triangles in @xmath36 with two of them adjacent if the triangles share a common edge .",
    "let @xmath59 be the subgraph in @xmath58 induced by the triangles visible from @xmath38 .",
    "this subgraph can not contain a cycle ( by non - degeneracy @xmath38 is not collinear with any two vertices of @xmath36 ) and thus it is a forest .",
    "let @xmath60 be the tree in @xmath59 that contains @xmath54 .",
    "the number @xmath44 coincides with the number of subtrees of @xmath60 with @xmath56 nodes that include @xmath54 .",
    "we can view @xmath60 as a planted tree with root @xmath54 , which has degree at most @xmath61 , and all of whose subtrees are binary trees .",
    "the number of @xmath62-node subtrees of @xmath60 that contain the root is upperbounded by the number of such subtrees of the infinte tree @xmath63 whose root has exactly three children each of which is root of an infinte binary tree . in turn",
    ", this number equals the number of binary trees with @xmath64 nodes whose right spine is not empty , because @xmath63 can be also described as the tree obtained contracting the first edge of the right spine in the infinite binary tree .",
    "the number of those trees is clearly @xmath65 .",
    "suppose now that @xmath38 is a boundary point .",
    "let @xmath66 be the edges for which @xmath38 is beyond , in order along the boundary of @xmath36 , and let @xmath67 . enlarge the triangulation @xmath36 by the traingles @xmath68 to a triangulation @xmath69 and proceed as in the first case but with @xmath70 playing the role of @xmath54 .",
    "the desired upper bound then turns out to be given by the number of @xmath64-node binary trees with exactly @xmath71 nodes on the right spine .",
    "let @xmath72 denote , for every pair of integers @xmath73 and @xmath74 , the maximum number of triangulations among all point sets with @xmath75 points and with _ at most _",
    "@xmath12 of them interior .",
    "we will prove by induction on @xmath75 that @xmath76 .",
    "induction starts with @xmath77 and @xmath78 , which gives @xmath79 .",
    "let @xmath5 be a point set with @xmath13 boundary points and @xmath12 interior points . for each @xmath18 ,",
    "let @xmath80 denote the sum over all triangulations of @xmath5 of the numbers of interior vertices of degree @xmath20 . for each @xmath81 ,",
    "let @xmath82 denote the sum over all triangulations of @xmath5 of the numbers of boundary vertices of degree @xmath23 .",
    "let @xmath83 be the number of triangulations of @xmath5 .",
    "observe that deleting an interior point from @xmath5 gives a point configuration with @xmath13 boundary points and @xmath84 interior points , while deleting a boundary point gives a point configuration with @xmath85 points , _ at most @xmath12 of which _ are interior .",
    "the number of triangulations of @xmath17 in which a certain vertex @xmath38 has degree @xmath20 is at most equal to the number of ways of inserting @xmath38 with degree @xmath20 in triangulations of @xmath37 .",
    "the inequality may by strict since insertions from different triangulations of @xmath37 can lead to the same triangulation of @xmath5 .",
    "then , lemma [ lemma : insert ] implies that @xmath86 @xmath87 @xmath88 on the other hand , from lemma [ lemma : euler ] we have that @xmath89    by inductive hypothesis , @xmath90 and @xmath91 .",
    "hence , @xmath92    [ rem : not - all - points ] in the theory of secondary polytopes and the so - called baues problem ( see , for example , @xcite and @xcite ) it is natural to consider as triangulations of @xmath5 those covering @xmath4 and with vertex set _ contained _ in @xmath5 , allowing not to use all of the interior points as vertices .",
    "we can bound the number of triangulations in this setting by adding the bounds of theorem [ thm : main ] for the different subsets of interior vertices .",
    "this gives the following upper bound , where @xmath72 is as in the proof of theorem [ thm : main ] : @xmath93",
    "let @xmath94 and @xmath95 denote the maximum and minimum number of triangulations among all point sets in the plane in general position and of cardinality @xmath0 .",
    "for @xmath95 it is necessary to assume general position since @xmath96 points on a line produce a point set with only 1 triangulation . for @xmath94 ,",
    "general position is no loss of generality .",
    "the following table , taken from @xcite , gives @xmath94 and @xmath95 for @xmath97 , compared to the number of triangulations of the convex @xmath0-gon :       concerning the asymptotic behaviour of @xmath95 and @xmath94 we know that : @xmath98 compare this with @xmath99 for the convex @xmath0-gon .",
    "the lower bound for @xmath95 comes from @xcite .",
    "the upper bound for @xmath94 is our theorem [ thm : main ] .",
    "the other two bounds come from the computation of the number of triangulations of the following point sets :    * * a double chain : * let @xmath5 consist of two convex chains of @xmath100 points each , facing one another and so that every pair of segments in different chains are visible from one another .",
    "see the center picture in figure [ fig : extremal ] , for the case @xmath101 .",
    "the edges drawn in the figure are `` unavoidable '' , i.e. , present in every triangulation .",
    "they divide @xmath5 into two convex @xmath71-gons , with @xmath102 triangulations each , and a non - convex @xmath103-gon which is easily seen to have @xmath104 triangulations ( see @xcite ) .",
    "hence , the number of triangulations of @xmath5 is : @xmath105 + = 10 cm * * a double circle : * let @xmath5 be a convex @xmath71-gon ( @xmath100 ) together with an interior point sufficiently close to each boundary edge .",
    "see the left part of figure [ fig : extremal ] , for the case @xmath101 .",
    "again , the edges drawn are unavoidable , and triangulating @xmath5 is the same as triangulating the central non - convex @xmath0-gon . an inclusion - exclusion argument ( see proposition 1 in @xcite )",
    "gives the exact number of triangulations of this polygon , which is @xmath106    it is interesting to observe that the double circle actually gives the minimum possible number of triangulations for @xmath107 .",
    "see @xcite , where this is conjectured to be true for all @xmath0 .",
    "( if @xmath0 is odd , the double circle has to be modified with an extra interior point . )    on the other hand , the double chain has only @xmath108 , @xmath109 and @xmath110 triangulations for @xmath111 , @xmath112 and @xmath113 respectively , which is less than @xmath94 .",
    "there is a simple way to modify it and get more triangulations , as shown in the right picture of figure [ fig : extremal ] .",
    "the big non - convex polygon is a double chain with @xmath114 vertices .",
    "this modified double chain has exactly @xmath115 triangulations , where @xmath116 as in the previous examples . that number is ( asymptotically ) four times the number of triangulations of the double chain .",
    "still , the modified double chain has @xmath112 , @xmath117 and @xmath118 triangulations for @xmath119 , which is not ( always ) the maximum .",
    "the numbers of triangulations of these configurations for @xmath120 appear in figure [ fig : extremal ] .",
    "the greatest number of triangulations for @xmath120 known so far is @xmath121 @xcite .",
