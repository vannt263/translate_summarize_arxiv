    "we find that the bigger the gauss - bonnet coupling is , the bigger the condensation value of the order parameter is , and the lower the critical temperature is .",
    "this reflects that the big gauss - bonnet coefficient will make the superconducting phase transition hard , which is consistent with our previous conclusions @xcite .",

    "<S> we investigate the phase transitions of holographic p - wave superconductors in @xmath0-dimensional einstein - yang - mills - gauss - bonnet theories , in a grand canonical ensemble . turning on the back - reaction of the yang - mills field </S>",
    "<S> , it is found that the condensations of vector order parameter become harder if the gauss - bonnet coefficient grows up or the back - reaction becomes stronger . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , the vector order parameter exhibits the features of first order and second order phase transitions , while only the second order phase transition is observed in the probe limit . </S>",
    "<S> we discuss the roles that the gauss - bonnet term and the back - reaction play in changing the order of phase transition . </S>"
