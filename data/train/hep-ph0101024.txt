    "as was shown in a number of papers , see refs . @xcite and references therein , the study of the radiative decays @xmath11 and @xmath12 can shed light on the problem of the scalar @xmath9 and @xmath10 mesons .",
    "these decays have been studied not only theoretically but also experimentally .",
    "present time data have already been obtained from novosibirsk with the detectors snd @xcite and cmd-2 @xcite , which give the following branching ratios : @xmath13 @xcite , @xmath14 @xcite and @xmath15 , @xmath16 @xcite",

    "note that the isovector @xmath9 meson is produced in the radiative @xmath18 meson decay as intensively as the well - studied @xmath19 meson involving essentially strange quarks @xmath20 ( @xmath21 ) , responsible for the decay .    as shown in refs .",
    "@xcite , the background situation for studying the radiative decays @xmath22 and @xmath23 is very good .",
    "for example , in the case of the decay @xmath22 , the process @xmath24 is the dominant background .",
    "the estimation for the soft , by strong interaction standard , photon energy , @xmath25 mev , gives @xmath26 .",
    "the influence of the background process is negligible , provided @xmath27 . in this paper , in sec .",
    "ii , we calculate the expression for the @xmath28 decay amplitude taking into account the interference between the @xmath29 and @xmath24 processes .",
    "we show that for the obtained experimental data the influence of the background processes is negligible everywhere over the photon energy region .",
    "the situation with @xmath30 decay is not much different .",
    "as was shown in @xcite the dominant background is the @xmath31 process with @xmath32 .",

    "the exact calculation of the interference patterns between the decays @xmath23 and @xmath34 , which we present in this paper in sec .",

    "iv we discuss the mechanism of the scalar meson production in the radiative decays and show that experimental data obtained in novosibirsk give the reasonable arguments in favor of the one - loop mechanism @xmath36 and @xmath8 of these decays . in the same place",
    "we discuss also distinctions between the four - quark , molecular , and two - quark models and explain why these data give evidence in favor of the four - quark nature of the scalar @xmath9 and @xmath10 mesons .",
    "as was shown in refs . @xcite the background process @xmath37 is dominant .",

    "one can see that in the region 950 - 1020 mev the function @xmath142 is suppressed by the @xmath144 low . in the mass spectrum",
    "this suppression is increased by one more power of @xmath150 , see eqs .",
    "( [ spectruma0 ] ) and ( [ f0 ] ) , so that we can not see the resonance in the region 980 - 995 mev .",
    "the maximum in the spectrum is effectively shifted to the region 935 - 950 mev . in truth",
    "this means that @xmath9 and @xmath10 resonances are seen in the radiative decays of @xmath18 meson owing to the @xmath79 intermediate state , otherwise the maxima in the spectra would be shifted to 900 mev .",
    "it is worth noting that the @xmath79 loop model is practically accepted by theorists , compare , for example , ref .",
    "@xcite with ref .",
    "@xcite , true there is exception @xcite .",
    "it was noted already in paper @xcite that the imaginary part of the @xmath79 loop is calculated practically in a model independent way making use of the coupling constants @xmath151 and @xmath152 due to the low s theorem @xcite for the photons with energy @xmath25 mev which is soft by the standard of strong interaction . in the same paper it was noted that the real part of the loop ( with accuracy up to 20% in the width of the @xmath139 decay ) is practically not different for the point - like particle and the compact hadron with form - factor which has the cutting radius in the momentum space about the mass of @xmath57 meson ( @xmath153 gev ) .",
    "in contrast to the four - quark state which is the compact hadron @xcite , the bound @xmath78 state is the extended state with the spatial radius @xmath154 , where @xmath155 is the binding energy .",
    "corresponding form - factor in the momentum space has the radius of the order of @xmath156 mev for @xmath157 mev , @xcite .",
    "the more detailed calculation @xcite gives for the radius in the momentum space the value @xmath158 mev . as a result ,",
    "the contribution of the virtual intermediate @xmath79 states in the @xmath79 loop is suppressed by the momentum distribution in the molecule , and the real part of the loop amplitude is negligible @xcite .",
    "it leads to the branching ratio much less than the experimental one , as it was noted above .",
    "in addition , the spectrum is much narrower in the @xmath78 molecule case that contradicts to the experiment , see the behavior of the imaginary part contribution in fig .",
    "[ g ] and in corresponding figures in @xcite .",
    "of course , the two - quark state is as compact as four - quark one .",
    "the question arises , why is the branching ratio in the two - quark model suppressed in comparison with the branching ratio in the four - quark model ? there are two reasons .",
    "first , the coupling constant of two - quark states with the @xmath78 channel is noticeably less @xcite and , second , there is the okubo - zweig - iizuka ( ozi ) rule that is more important really .",
    "if the isovector @xmath9 meson is the two - quark state , it has no strange quarks .",
    "hence @xcite , the decay @xmath159 should be suppressed according to the ozi rule . on the intermediate state level ,",
    "the ozi rule is formulated as compensation of the different intermediate states @xcite . in our case",
    "these states are @xmath160 , @xmath161 , @xmath162 and so on . since , due to the kinematical reason , the real intermediate state is the only @xmath79 state , the compensation in the imaginary part is impossible and it destroys the ozi rule",
    ". the compensation should be in the real part of the amplitude only . as a result",
    ", the @xmath159 decay in the two - quark model is mainly due to the imaginary part of the amplitude and is much less intensive than in the four - quark model @xcite .",
    "in addition , in the two - quark model , @xmath9 meson should appear in the @xmath159 decay as a noticeably more narrow resonance than in other processes , see the behavior of the imaginary part contribution in fig .",
    "as regards to the isoscalar @xmath10 state , there are two possibilities in the two - quark model . if @xmath10 meson does not contain the strange quarks the all above mentioned arguments about suppression of the @xmath159 decay and the spectrum shape are also valid for the @xmath163 decay . generally speaking",
    ", there could be the strong ozi violation for the isoscalar @xmath164 states ( mixing of the @xmath165 , @xmath166 and @xmath20 states ) with regard to the strong mixing of the quark and gluon degree of freedom which is due to the nonperturbative effects of qcd @xcite .",
    "but , an almost exact degeneration of the masses of the isoscalar @xmath10 and isovector @xmath9 mesons excludes such a possibility .",
    "note also , the experiment points directly to the weak coupling of @xmath10 meson with gluons , @xmath167 @xcite .    if @xmath10 meson is close to the @xmath20 state @xcite there is no suppression due to the the ozi rule .",
    "nevertheless , if @xmath9 and @xmath10 mesons are the members of the same multiplet , the @xmath163 branching ratio , @xmath168 , is significantly less than that in the four - quark model , due to the relation between the coupling constants with the @xmath78 , @xmath73 and @xmath78 , @xmath94 channels inherited in the two - quark model , see refs .",
    "@xcite . in addition ,",
    "in this case there is no natural explanation of the @xmath55 and @xmath83 mass degeneration .    only in the case",
    "when the nature of @xmath10 meson in no way related to the nature of @xmath9 meson ( which , for example , is the four - quark state ) the branching ratio experimentally observed @xmath163 could be explained by @xmath20 nature of @xmath10 meson .",
    "but , from the theoretical point of view , such a possibility seems awful @xcite .",
