    "twenty years ago , it might have been surprising to see elliptical galaxies featured at a conference on `` galaxy disks and disk galaxies '' . now",
    ", however , it is generally accepted that many elliptical galaxies have stellar and/or gaseous disks .",
    "luminosity ellipticals often show ` disky ' isophotes and/or rapid stellar rotation suggesting the presence of an inner stellar disk ( e.g. bender et al .  1988 ;",
    "rix & white 1990 ) . extended disks of gas and dust are often seen around giant ellipticals ( e.g. knapp et al .",
    "1985 ; sadler & gerhard 1986 ) , and are usually ascribed to a recent accretion event or merger .",
    "small central disks of ionized gas are also common in elliptical and s0 galaxies ( e.g. phillips et al .",
    "1986 ; buson et al .",
    "1993 ) .",
    "the existence of these disks has implications for our ideas about how early  type galaxies form and evolve .",
    "there is no clear photometric boundary between the e and s0 classes ( e.g. van den bergh 1989 ) , and it has been suggested that ` disky ' ellipticals form a continuous photometric sequence with s0s and spiral bulges and may have a different formation mechanism from the ( generally more massive ) ` boxy ' ellipticals ( capaccioli et al .",
    "1990 ; kormendy & bender 1996 ) .    for the past few years",
    ", we ( and others ) have been working to obtain high  quality hi images for a larger sample of early  type galaxies in order to learn more about the relationship between gas content , galaxy evolution , environment and the triggering of an active nucleus .",
    "jacqueline van gorkom ( this meeting ) has reviewed what we now know about the hi structure and kinematics in early  type galaxies . in this paper",
    ", we focus on two topics  star formation in the hi disks of low luminosity ellipticals , and the likely impact of the hi parkes all  sky survey ( hipass ) on hi studies of early  type galaxies . in the discussion which follows ,",
    "we assume h@xmath0=50 km s@xmath1 mpc@xmath1 , and that a ` low ",
    "luminosity ' galaxy has m@xmath2  mag .",
    "lake & schommer ( 1984 ) first showed that hi was common in low ",
    "luminosity e / s0 galaxies , detecting 11/28 such systems ( 39% ) in their hi survey at arecibo .",
    "four of these galaxies were later imaged with the vla and shown to have regular velocity fields ( lake et al .",
    "1987 ) . at about the same time ,",
    "phillips et al .",
    "( 1986 ) found hii region  like emission line ratios in the spectra of 5/18 low ",
    "luminosity e / s0s ( 28% ) , implying that these galaxies are currently forming massive stars .",
    "in contrast , none of the @xmath3200 luminous e / s0s observed by phillips et al .  showed evidence for the presence of hii regions .",
    "luminosity functions ( e.g. binggeli et al .  1988 ) show that low ",
    "luminosity e / s0 galaxies are more common than luminous ones in terms of their space density , yet they remain less well  studied because optical galaxy catalogues are strongly biased towards optically  luminous galaxies",
    ". many of the low  luminosity galaxies which have been studied lie in clusters ( because they are easier to find there ) and may not be typical of the field population .",
    "sadler et al .  ( 2000 ) studied the hi distribution and kinematics in four low ",
    "luminosity field e / s0 galaxies shown by phillips et al .",
    "( 1986 ) to have hii region  like optical emission",
    " line spectra .",
    "the hi typically extended to 23 times the optical radius ( see figure 1 ) , and the velocity fields were characteristic of settled disks with regular rotation . in two of the four galaxies the hi rotation axis was misaligned with the photometric axis of the optical galaxy . in all four galaxies",
    "the hi was very centrally concentrated , in contrast to early  type spiral bulges and luminous ellipticals which often show central hi holes .",
    "table 1 shows the current star  formation rate ( sfr ) for the four galaxies studied by sadler et al .",
    "( 2000 ) , derived from the h@xmath4 emission  line flux .",
    "optical images and spectroscopy show that massive star formation in these galaxies takes place in the central 0.51.0kpc , where the hi surface density is highest .",
    "thus the bulk of star formation is concealed within the central bulge of these galaxies .",
    "formation rates in table 1 are low compared to those in spiral disks ( e.g. around 4 m@xmath5/yr in the galaxy ) , and the currently  available gas supply could sustain the current rate of star formation for many gyr .",
    "the ubv colours of the galaxies in table 1 can be fitted by stellar  population models with a slowly  declining star ",
    "formation rate s @xmath6 ( searle et al .  1973 ) , i.e. intermediate between the giant ellipticals ( s @xmath7 and late  type spiral disks ( s @xmath3 constant ) . thus all the data so far are consistent with a picture in which these low  luminosity e / s0 galaxies have been forming stars at a slowly  declining rate over a hubble time .",
    "if so , it appears that bulges can be built up slowly over time , and that low ",
    "luminosity early  type galaxies may have a very different star ",
    "formation history from the giant ellipticals .",

    "it is still unclear whether the hi commonly seen in these galaxies is mainly primordial , or whether in some cases at least it has been accreted later on ( as the misalignment of hi rotation axes and optical photometric axes might indicate ) .",
    "it is also unclear exactly what triggers star formation , as the current star formation rate does not correlate in any simple way with hi surface density ( though stars do seem to form where the hi density is highest ) . to shed some light on these questions",
    ", we would like to have a larger sample of galaxies to study ( so that , for example , we could compare the distribution of m(hi)/l@xmath8 with that seen in giant ellipticals ) .",
    "fortunately , the recently  completed hi parkes all  sky survey ( hipass ) offers the possibility of doing this in the near future .",
    "hipass ( barnes et al .  2000 ) is an hi imaging survey of the entire southern sky ( @xmath18 , but now being extended further north ) carried out with a 13beam receiver on the 64 m parkes radiotelescope .",
    "hipass spectra cover the velocity range @xmath19 to @xmath20 km s@xmath1 .    a preliminary examination ( sadler 2000 ) of hipass spectra of @xmath21 bright early  type galaxies finds an hi detection rate of at least 5% for ellipticals and 12% for s0 galaxies catalogued in the rc3 ( de vaucouleurs et al .",
    "the detection rate is significantly higher for low ",
    "luminosity e and s0 galaxies than for more luminous ones ( 22@xmath225% for early  type galaxies with @xmath23m@xmath24 , versus 10@xmath25% for those with m@xmath26 ) , though the rc3 contains relatively few low  luminosity galaxies .",
    "however , automated galaxy finders will eventually detect many more uncatalogued galaxies in the hipass data cubes .",
    "predictions based on the optical luminosity function of e / s0 galaxies and the observed hi detection rate ( sadler 1997 ) suggest that as many as 100150 uncatalogued hipass detections will be low ",
    "luminosity e / so galaxies with apparent magnitudes in the range b=1518 .",
    "this will provide a data set large enough to derive a reliable hi mass function for nearby e and s0 galaxies , and to explore in detail the effects of both luminosity and environment on the hi content of early  type galaxies .",
    "luminous ( ` boxy ' ) and low  luminosity ( ` disky ' ) ellipticals appear to differ not only in their structure and kinematics , but in their hi content and star  formation history .",
    "hi gas disks are much more common in low  luminosity ellipticals than in high  luminosity ones , and the hi disks in low  luminosity ellipticals commonly support a modest level of ongoing massive star formation , which is not seen in the giant ellipticals .",
    "this implies that low ",
    "luminosity ellipticals form much more slowly than giant ellipticals , and in many cases are still forming stars today .",
