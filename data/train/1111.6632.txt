    "a body in orbital motion may undergo a radial decay of its orbit due to the loss of angular momentum by the negative torque caused by df drag .",
    "chandrasekhar ( 1943 ) derived the dynamical friction on a massive particle passing through a homogeneous and isotropic background of light stars .",
    "his formula is applied to estimate the merger timescale of satellite systems or to study the accretion history of galaxies .",
    "bondi & hoyle ( 1944 ) considered the problem of the mass accretion by a point mass @xmath4 travelling at velocity @xmath1 in a collisional homogeneous medium of sound speed @xmath2 in the limit where the perturber moves at supersonic velocities relative to the ambient gas ( i.e.  high mach numbers ) .",
    "if the perturber is an accretor , streamlines with small impact parameter may become bound because of energy dissipation in shocks , and can be accreted to the perturber .",
    "hence , the force on the perturber consists of two parts ; the gravitational drag and the momentum accretion force .",
    "the latter contribution may be decelerating or accelerating ( ruffert 1996 ) .",
    "if the size of the perturber is larger than the bondi - hoyle accretion radius defined as @xmath5 $ ] with @xmath6 , the density and velocity structure of the wake , at any mach number , can be inferred analytically in linear theory because the body produces a small perturbation in the ambient gaseous medium at any location .",
    "the gravitational drag is inferred as the gravitational attraction between the perturber and its own wake ( e.g. , dokuchaev 1964 ; rephaeli & salpeter 1980 ; just & kegel 1990 ; ostriker 1999 ; kim & kim 2007 ; snchez - salcedo 2009 ; namouni 2010 ) .",

    "he concluded that the df force on a supersonic body is reduced by a factor that depends on the ratio between the alfvn speed and the sound speed . since large - scale magnetic fields are ubiquitous in many astronomical systems such as molecular clouds ( tamura & sato 1989 ; goodman & heiles 1994 ; matthews & wilson 2002 ; heiles & crutcher 2005 ) or galactic nuclei , it is important to understand how the df force is affected by the presence of ordered large - scale magnetic fields .",

    "previous works have shown that , although the formulae of the gaseous drag force in a _ unmagnetized _ gas medium , were derived for rectilinear orbits in homogeneous and infinite media ( dokuchaev 1964 ; rephaeli & salpeter 1980 ; just & kegel 1990 ; ostriker 1999 ; snchez - salcedo & brandenburg 1999 ; kim & kim 2009 ; namouni 2010 ; lee & stahler 2011 ; cant et al .",

[ sec : results ] describes the structure of the resulting wake and evaluate the df force as a function of mach number , for different angles between the direction of the perturber s velocity and the direction of the magnetic field . in  [ sec : summary ] , we summarize our results and discuss their implications .",
    "under assumption of a steady state , dokuchaev ( 1964 ) , ruderman & spiegel ( 1971 ) and rephaeli & salpeter ( 1980 ) derived the drag force on a point mass @xmath4 moving at velocity @xmath1 on a straight - line trajectory through a uniform medium with unperturbed density @xmath9 and sound speed @xmath2 . for subsonic perturbers ( @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is the mach number ) , these authors found that the drag force is zero because of the front - back symmetry of the density distribution about the perturber .",

    "[ sec : introduction ] .    using a time - dependent analysis in the unmagnetized case , ostriker ( 1999 ) found that ( 1 ) the force is not zero at the subsonic regime because , although a subsonic perturber generates a density distribution with contours of constant density corresponding to ellipsoids , there are always cut - off ones within the sonic sphere that exert a gravitational drag , and ( 2 ) @xmath14 increases with time in the supersonic case .",
    "more specifically , she found that the coulomb logarithm is given by : @xmath17 for @xmath18 and @xmath19 , and @xmath20 for @xmath21 and @xmath22 .",

    "snchez - salcedo & brandenburg ( 1999 ) tested numerically that ostriker s formula is very accurate for non - accreting extended perturbers .",
    "in many astrophysical situations , one needs to assign a softening radius to the gravitational potential which in turn determines @xmath15 without any ambiguity . for a body described with a plummer model with core radius @xmath24",

    "the friction force has been derived by lee & stahler ( 2011 ) in the subsonic regime and by cant et al .",
    "( 2011 ) in the hypersonic limit .",
    "the presence of a small - scale magnetic field tangled at scales below @xmath15 will change the speed of sound . for isotropic compression of a random magnetic field ,",
    "the effective sound speed is @xmath26 ( e.g. , zweibel 2002 ) , where @xmath27 is the alfvn speed of the random small - scale component of the magnetic field .",
    "therefore , in order to include the effect of a small - scale magnetic field , one has to replace the sound speed by the effective sound speed in the definition of @xmath11 in eqs .",
    "( [ eq : ostriker1 ] ) and ( [ eq : ostriker2 ] ) .",
    "the extension of the drag force formulae is by no means straightforward if the gaseous medium is permeated by a regular magnetic field .",
    "dokuchaev ( 1964 ) derived the gravitational drag force in the steady state for perturbers moving along the lines of the unperturbed magnetic field .",
    "he found that the df drag is @xmath28 at @xmath29 , where @xmath30 is the alfvn speed of the regular magnetic field , and it is zero for @xmath31 . by comparing eqs .",
    "( [ eq : rephaeli ] ) and ( [ eq : dokuchaev_drag ] ) , we see that the drag in a uniform magnetized background is never larger than in the unmagnetized case .",
    "according to dokuchaev ( 1964 ) , the gravitational drag on a body with velocity @xmath1 in a uniformly magnetized medium is equal to the drag on a body with velocity @xmath32 in a unmagnetized medium .",
    "therefore , if one naively uses the nonmagnetic formulae ( [ eq : rephaeli])-([eq : ostriker2 ] ) by replacing the sound speed @xmath2 by the magnetosonic speed @xmath33 would yield to wrong results . in the next section ,",
    "we will show , however , that the paper of dokuchaev ( 1964 ) contains an error and it is not true that the drag force in the magnetized medium case is always smaller than in the unmagnetized case .    as ostriker ( 1999 ) demonstrated in the field - free case ,",
    "the steady state result found by dokuchaev that the net force is zero at @xmath31 , because of the front - back symmetry of the density perturbation in the medium , may be misleading .",
    "it is also unclear how @xmath34 varies in time for the magnetized supersonic case .",
    "moreover , it left unexplored how the drag force depends on the angle between the velocity of the perturber and the direction of the magnetic field . before addressing these questions , however , it is still worthwhile finding analytical solutions for the perturbed steady density and the resulting drag force in the simplest scenario in which the velocity of the perturber and the magnetic field are parallel .",
    "such a exact treatment will allow us to gain insight into more complicated situations .",
    "this will be done in the next section .",
    "we consider a gravitational perturber moving on a straight - line at constant velocity in a medium with unperturbed density @xmath9 and thermal sound speed @xmath2 . in the absence of magnetic fields ,",
    "the linearized equations of motion can be reduced to a nonhomogeneous wave equation for the relative perturbation @xmath35 ( e.g. , ruderman & spiegel 1971 ; ostriker 1999 ) .",
    "once a uniform magnetic field , @xmath36 , parallel to the direction of perturber s velocity is included , dokuchaev ( 1964 ) showed that the relative perturbation obeys an equation of fourth order in @xmath37 and solved it using a double fourier - hankel transformation .",
    "as it will become clear later , we prefer to describe the evolution of the system through wave - equations because it facilitates the physical interpretation of the problem and because the contact with the analysis of ostriker ( 1999 ) is easier .",
    "in addition , the extension of the equations for a case where the angle between @xmath36 and the velocity of the perturber is arbitrary , becomes straightforward in our approach .",
    "we study first the completely steady flow created by a mass on a constant - speed trajectory parallel to the lines of the unperturbed magnetic field @xmath38 . to do this ,",
    "consider a particle at the origin of our coordinate system , surrounded by a gas whose velocity far from the particle is @xmath39 , with @xmath40 .",
    "we will further assume that the gas evolves under flux - freezing conditions .",
    "our analysis begins with the linearized mhd equations to describe the medium s response to the perturber s presence @xmath41 , @xmath42 and @xmath43 , in a stationary sate ( @xmath44 ) @xmath45 @xmath46 @xmath47 @xmath48 where @xmath49 is the gravitational potential created by the perturber .",

[ eq : poisson ] ) , @xmath59 is coupled to the fluid motions through the flux - freezing equation ( [ eq : steady_induction ] ) .",
    "next , we need an independent equation for @xmath59 to close the system . this can be accomplished using the third component of the induction equation ( [ eq : steady_induction ] ) , which has the form @xmath60 our strategy is to eliminate @xmath61 in equation ( [ eq : induction99 ] ) .",
    "the third component of the equation of motion ( [ eq : steady_motion ] ) can be written as @xmath62 this equation does not depend explicitly on the frozen - in magnetic field because the @xmath63-component of the lorentz force vanishes in the linear approximation ( see eq .",

    ".    the surfaces of constant density for subsonic perturbers may be either ellipsoids or hyperbolae , depending on the mach number . at @xmath85",
    "it holds that @xmath107 and the isodensity surfaces are ellipsoids _ elongated _ along the trajectory of the perturber with eccentricity @xmath108 .",
    "this is in sharp contrast to what happens without any magnetic field where the ellipses are elongated along @xmath109 for perturbers at _ any subsonic mach number _",
    "( @xmath110 ) .",

    "the result of @xmath113 implies that the gas is being dragged by the gravitational pushing of the body . in order to understand the morphology of the wake in a magnetized medium , in the following we calculate @xmath114 and @xmath115 for a perturber with mach number in the interval i.    from eq .",
    "( [ eq : steady_third ] ) and using the result for @xmath91 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : alpha_axisymmetric ] ) , we find that @xmath116 which leads to @xmath117 it is simple to show that @xmath113 in case i , regardless the value of @xmath105 .",
    "the radial component of the velocity can be found using eq .",

    "thus , a parcel of fluid in the upstream region circulates around the perturber , reaching its maximum @xmath109-value at @xmath121 and then turning back again .",
    "since frozen - in magnetic field lines are dragged by the gas , the upstream magnetic field lines are decompressed radially , resulting in arched magnetic field lines with negative @xmath59-values .",

    "thus , an anticorrelation between density and @xmath59 arises .    at mach numbers close to @xmath125 ,",
    "that is , @xmath126 with @xmath127 a very small positive number , the density profile , at not extremely large @xmath63 distances , is @xmath128 hence , the density enhancement is large and its @xmath63-gradient very small .    at _ subsonic",
    "_ mach numbers in the interval @xmath86 , the surfaces of constant density exhibit no front - back symmetry .",
    "the isodensity contours correspond to hyperbolae in the @xmath129 plane , as occurs for supersonic perturbers in the absence of magnetic fields , but now the density perturbation is null in the rear mach cone and is non - vanishing in a modified mach cone leading the perturber .",
    "the physical reason is as follows .",
    "the density perturbation @xmath91 is non - positive at any location because the streamlines diverge at the front cone ( @xmath130 and @xmath131 ) .",
    "@xmath91 at the edges of the cone is minus infinity for a point mass . in the front cone , @xmath132 ,",
    "meaning that the flow in that region is being accelerated by the inward net pressure force . across the edge of the modified mach cone , there is a rapid rise in pressure and density , and the gas velocity quickly slows .",
    "in fact , the causality criterion used in appendix [ sec : appendix1 ] is tantamount to selecting the solution in which a rapid flow is slowed in a short distance , as occurs in shock waves .",
    "indeed , we will find numerically further below that the system adopts this solution (  [ sec : axisymmetriccase ] ) .    in case iii ,",
    "the body moves at intermediate velocities , i.e.  either in the range @xmath133 ( if @xmath134 ) or in the range @xmath135 ( if @xmath136 ) .",
    "it is only in this case that @xmath137 lies in the range @xmath138 and , therefore , the ellipsoids are flattened along @xmath63 .",
    "remind that in the unmagnetized background , a subsonic perturber also produces elliptical density distributions flattened along @xmath63 ( e.g. , ostriker 1999 ) ; the latter is a particular case of @xmath135 . for @xmath133 ( which requires that @xmath134 ) , however , the density perturbation is negative ( @xmath139 ) . in this case",
    ", the thermal pressure decreases towards the body .",
    "therefore , ahead of the perturber the gas is accelerated along the @xmath63-direction by the gravitational force plus the pressure gradient ( it holds that @xmath140 at @xmath112 ) .",
    "a negative @xmath91 is a consequence of the action of the pressure gradient plus the reduction of the radial convergence of the flow due to the presence of the ordered magnetic field that preferentially allows motions along @xmath63 , which lead to an accelerated flow falling towards the perturber . in the radial direction ,",
    "the magnetic field lines are compressed at @xmath112 because @xmath141 upstream of the perturber .    from eqs .",
    "( [ eq : alpha_axisymmetric])-([eq : lambda_complete ] ) we see that if the motion of the perturber is both supersonic and super - alfvnic , which corresponds to case iv , the density disturbance is confined to a rear cone defined by the condition @xmath142 . in this regime ,",
    "the surfaces of constant density within the wake correspond to similar hyperbolae in the @xmath129 plane , at the rear of the body , with eccentricity @xmath143 . from eq .",
    "( [ eq : xi_def ] ) , it is simple to show that @xmath144 in this case . therefore , given a sonic mach number @xmath11 , the angular aperture of the cone is larger in the presence of magnetic fields . in analogy to the unmagnetized medium , one could define the effective speed of propagation of the disturbance as @xmath145 in case iv . at large mach numbers ( say @xmath146 ) , the cone is very narrow ( @xmath147 ) and , as expected , the propagation speed coincides with the magnetoacoustic velocity , @xmath148 .",
    "hence , at these large @xmath11 values , the stationary flow is similar to that in the nonmagnetic case but replacing the sound speed by the magnetosonic speed .",
    "now consider case iv but when the perturber moves at the same velocity as the effective speed of the disturbance , so that @xmath149 or , equivalently , @xmath150 . in the non - magnetic case , this condition corresponds to @xmath151 and , therefore , the velocity of the body is in resonance with the sound speed in the medium .",
    "one could naively think that , at @xmath150 , the response of the medium is maximum because of the resonance between @xmath1 and @xmath152 .",

[ eq : eta_def ] ) and , thereby , @xmath97 . we learn that a mass moving at the alfvn speed in a medium with @xmath134 , does not generate any density disturbance in the ambient gas because the velocity field of the stationary flow is divergence - free ( @xmath155 ) .",
    "as already mentioned , dokuchaev ( 1964 ) calculated , for the first time , the properties of the wake created by a star moving along the field lines , by treating it as a linear perturbation .",

    "for the case without mass injected by the star ( @xmath158 ) , the physical stand points used by dokuchaev ( 1964 ) are exactly the same as those adopted in  [ sec : perturbed_density ] , except that he chose a reference frame in which the unperturbed background gas is at rest .",

    "however , the drag force is finite because the opening angle of the cone becomes very narrow .",

    "for instance , the width of that interval is only of @xmath197 for @xmath198 .",

    "the drag force is a factor @xmath201 stronger in the interval @xmath192 than it is at @xmath21 .",
    "the steady state analysis in the axisymmetric case predicts zero drag force at certain mach numbers because the perturber is surrounded by complete ellipsoids that exert no net force .",
    "as ostriker ( 1999 ) demonstrated in the field - free case , the time - dependent analysis in which the body is dropped suddently at @xmath23 allows to capture the asymmetric density shells in the far field which exert a gravitational drag on the body .",

    "this implies that @xmath314 will tend to redirect perturber s velocity to a higher @xmath243 . for the cases shown in figure [ fig : fig_45 g ] , the perpendicular force saturates in the run of the calculation ( @xmath303 ) only in two cases ; for @xmath319 and @xmath307 , and for @xmath251 and @xmath200 ( this latter case is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig_force_perp_45 g ] ) . in some cases with subsonic mach numbers ,",
    "the perpendicular component of the force is initially positive , achieves a maximum and then stars a linear decline up to negative values ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : fig_force_perp_45 g ] ) .      in figure",
    "[ fig : fig_force_angle ] we plot the drag force as a function of @xmath243 , for @xmath189 and @xmath320 .",
    "the dependence of @xmath318 on @xmath243 is not always monotonic .",
    "the strongest variation of @xmath318 with @xmath243 occurs for @xmath252 . for this mach number ,",
    "the drag force may decrease by a factor of @xmath271@xmath311 from @xmath246 to @xmath321 . for @xmath262 , the drag force may change up to a factor of @xmath271 depending on the @xmath243-value .",
    "for @xmath284 and @xmath275 , the drag force depends gently on the angle .    in many astrophysical scenarios ,",
    "the perturber will be subject to an external gravitational potential and will describe a nonrectilinear orbit .",
    "snchez - salcedo & brandenburg ( 2001 ) numerically treated the orbital decay of a perturber in orbit around a unmagnetized gaseous sphere .",
    "they found that the `` local approximation '' , that is estimating the drag force at the present location of the perturber as if the medium were homogeneous but taking appropriately the coulomb logarithm , is very successful .",
    "consider now a perturber on a circular orbit in a magnetized medium .",
    "if the orbit lies in a plane perpendicular to the magnetic field , the attack angle @xmath243 is always @xmath322 . in the local approximation ,",
    "the maximum drag for @xmath282 and @xmath84 occurs at @xmath323 and at @xmath324 for @xmath189 .",
    "however , if the plane of the circular orbit is parallel to the direction of the initial magnetic field , @xmath243 will change periodically in time as @xmath325 . therefore ,",
    "if the local approximation is valid , one can estimate the mean drag force over a rotation period , which is approximately equivalent to take the mean value of @xmath318 over @xmath243 .",
    "in particular , for @xmath189 , the @xmath243-average drag force is maximum at @xmath326 .",
    "this example illustrates how @xmath318 may depend on @xmath105 and on the inclination of the orbit respect to the magnetic field lines .",
    "a more detailed analysis of the drag force on a body on a circular orbit will be given somewhere else .",
    "understanding the nature of the df force experienced by a gravitational object that moves against a mass density background is of great importance to describe the evolution of gravitational systems . in this work ,",
    "we investigated the df on a body moving in rectilinear trajectory through a gaseous medium with a magnetic field uniform on the scales considered . in linear theory , the problem is largely characterized by three dimensionless parameters , @xmath11 , which is defined as the ratio of the particle velocity to the sound speed of the uniform gas , @xmath105 , defined as the ratio between the alfvn and sound speeds , and @xmath243 , the angle between the magnetic field direction and the particle velocity .",
    "we find that magnetic effects may alter the drag force , especially for @xmath297 , because the magnetic field affects the flow velocity field in the perpendicular direction of the ambient field lines , and thereby the morphology of the wake .",
    "note that the plasma beta , defined as the ratio of gas to magnetic pressure , is @xmath327 for an isothermal system .",
    "there are two major differences between the magnetized and unmagnetized case .",
    "one conceptual difference is that , while gravitational focusing in a unmagnetized medium always generates a positive density enhancement , this is not the case in a magnetized medium ( see , e.g. , figs .",
    "[ fig : map_0_141 ] , [ fig : map_07 + 09 ] and [ fig : fig_map_45 + 90 ] ) .",
    "a second result is that the peak value of the drag force is not near @xmath328 for a mass moving in a magnetized medium .",
    "in fact , the sharp peak of @xmath318 at @xmath328 found in the @xmath84 case is no longer present in a magnetized medium with @xmath297 .",
    "for instance , for a perturber in perpendicular motion to the field lines ( @xmath282 ) in a medium with @xmath200 , the drag force is essentially constant from @xmath319 to @xmath275 and its maximum is located around @xmath329 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : fig_90 g ] ) .",
    "the flat plateau in the drag force between @xmath319 and @xmath275 is partly because of the extra rigidity of the magnetic field in the @xmath330 and @xmath283 directions .    for a body traveling along the field lines , i.e.  @xmath246",
    ", the steady - state problem can be treated analytically .",
    "we focus first on this case . for @xmath331 ,",
    "the drag force presents two local maxima ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : dokuchaev ] ) ; one is located in the subsonic branch ( at @xmath125 ) and the other peak value is at the supersonic branch [ at @xmath195 ] .",
    "when the velocity of the perturber is supersonic and super - alfvnic ( and @xmath246 ) , the df force in a magnetized medium is weaker than it is in the unmagnetized case by a factor of @xmath333 , with @xmath334 .",
    "the physical reason is that the medium becomes more rigid in the radial direction and , hence , the opening aperture of the modified mach cone is the same as that in a unmagnetized medium with effective sound speed @xmath33 , but the density enhancement is smaller by a factor of @xmath333 .",
    "by contrast , the drag force for subsonic velocities is stronger if the medium is uniformly magnetized . for @xmath246 , an underdense region",
    "is formed upstream because of the gas channeling along the direction of the magnetic field , following the path of less resistance .",
    "the steady - state theory predicts that the gravitational drag on a body with @xmath246 vanishes at mach numbers in the following two ranges : ( 1 ) at @xmath85 and ( 2 ) at @xmath335 .",
    "however , using time - dependent analysis we find that the df force asymptotically approaches to a nonzero steady - state value at these mach numbers . for @xmath199 ( still @xmath246 ) ,",
    "the drag force is maximized for perturbers moving at a mach number close to @xmath125 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : fig_200_0 g ] ) . at mach numbers around @xmath125 ,",
    "the density enhancement is large but negative in a cone in front of the body . at those mach numbers",
    ", the df may be even more efficient than in the stellar case .",
    "for example , for a medium with @xmath200 , the drag force peaks between @xmath296 and @xmath336 . as a consequence of the stronger df force ,",
    "subsonic massive objects in a orbit elongated along the magnetic field lines in a constant - density core of a nonsingular gaseous sphere will suffer a orbital decay faster if the medium is pervased by a large - scale magnetic field .",
    "we have also explored the @xmath243-dependence of the df drag .",
    "for mach numbers around @xmath125 , the drag force exhibits the strongest variations with @xmath243 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : fig_force_angle ] ) . for magnetized media with @xmath337 and",
    "regardless the exact value of @xmath243 , we find that ( 1 ) the drag force for subsonic perturbers is higher by a factor of @xmath338@xmath271 than it is for the unmagnetized df drag , and ( 2 ) for supersonic perturbers ( @xmath21 ) , the magnetized drag force is always weaker than the unmagnetized drag force . at intermediate mach numbers , @xmath339 ,",
    "the drag force is a factor of @xmath271@xmath311 weaker than it is in the absence of magnetic fields for an evolved stage . ] . at high mach numbers , @xmath340 ,",
    "the suppresion of the drag force is more important at small values of @xmath243 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : fig_force_angle ] ) . at these high mach numbers and for an angle of @xmath282 ,",
    "the drag forces are similar with and without magnetic fields ( fig .",
    "[ fig : fig_90 g ] ) .    as a consequence , supersonic massive objects may make their way more slowly to the center of the system if the medium is pervased by a large - scale magnetic field . as a model problem , consider a singular isothermal spherical cloud threaded by a uniform magnetic field and a small - scale random magnetic field with alfvn speed @xmath27 everywhere constant .",
    "the density profile of the cloud is given by @xmath341 , where @xmath2 is the isothermal sound speed .",
    "the circular speed is @xmath342 .",
    "since the effective sound speed is @xmath343 , the mach number of a body on a quasi - circular orbit is @xmath344 which varies from @xmath345 to @xmath275 depending on the value of @xmath27 and whether the perturbations are isothermal or adiabatic ) and remains barely supersonic through most of the simulation . ] .",
    "if the uniform magnetic field component has a @xmath105-value between @xmath174 and @xmath320 , the time for the perturber s orbit to decay will be a factor of @xmath271@xmath346 larger than the corresponding decay time for @xmath84 .",
    "our results demonstrate that , in the presence of ordered magnetic fields with @xmath347 , the role of the magnetic field on the drag force should be taken into account to have accurate estimates of the timescales of orbital decay via gravitational df .",

    "it is interesting to note that when @xmath361 , the right - hand - side of equation ( [ eq : fourier_parallel ] ) vanishes and thereby the solution is @xmath97 , implying that the steady - state configuration satisfies @xmath362 .",
    "obviously , the drag force is exactly zero in this configuration .",
    "there exist two situations where the differential equation ( [ eq : fourier_parallel ] ) is not well - posed : ( 1 ) at @xmath328 and ( 2 ) at the critical mach number , @xmath125 , satisfying that @xmath363 so that @xmath82 it is clear that @xmath364 . if the dynamics is dominated by the magnetic field , i.e. when @xmath365 , then @xmath366 . if not specified , we will consider @xmath367 and @xmath368 throughout this section .",
    "we will now calculate the solution of eq .",
    "( [ eq : fourier_parallel ] ) when the perturber is a point mass @xmath4 , so that @xmath369 , which corresponds to the fourier transformation of @xmath370 , to obtain the green s function . using the convolution theorem ,",
    "it is possible to evaluate @xmath91 for any general distribution @xmath50 .",
    "hence , we solve for @xmath371 where @xmath372 and @xmath373 the integral ( [ eq : alphaks ] ) along @xmath374 is evaluated by transforming to the complex plane .",
    "it is convenient to define @xmath375 . either if @xmath11 stands in the range @xmath376 or in the range @xmath377 , then @xmath378 and thus none of the poles lie on the real axis .",
    "hence we may use cauchy s residue theorem to obtain : @xmath379    for mach numbers in any of the two ranges : @xmath380 , the integrand has poles on the real axis .",
    "hence we make ` indentations ' in the contour at the position of the poles .",
    "we consider first mach numbers larger than @xmath381 .",
    "then , for @xmath112 , we close the contour at @xmath382 , leaving the poles outside the contour to preserve causality , whereas for @xmath383 , we consider a domain containing the lower half - plane , that is where @xmath384 , and the contour slightly above the real axis , so that the two poles lie inside the contour . more specifically , for @xmath383 , the integration over @xmath374 can be evaluated as @xmath385 where @xmath386 and @xmath387 . the integration over @xmath388 and @xmath389 can be carried out in polar coordinates ( @xmath390 and @xmath391 ) : @xmath392    at mach numbers in the interval @xmath393 , causality is perserved at @xmath112 if we consider a domain containing the upper half - plane and the two poles lie inside the contour .",
    "putting all together , the solution is @xmath394 where @xmath395 this result can be compared with that in dokuchaev ( 1964 ) by noting that he used the variable @xmath396 to denote the combination @xmath397 .",
    "dokuchaev ( 1964 ) found the same functional form for @xmath91 , but failed to divide correctly the cases according to the mach number . in the absence of a background magnetic field , which corresponds to @xmath151 and @xmath398",
    ", we recover the classical form derived by previous authors .",
    "we consider a gravitational perturber moving at constant velocity @xmath399 in an unperturbed medium with density @xmath9 , sound speed @xmath2 and a magnetic field @xmath400 .",
    "therefore , the velocity of the perturber and the magnetic field are perpendicular .",
    "we are interested in the stationary wake formed behind the body . to do this",
    ", we assume that perturber is at rest and feels a wind with velocity @xmath401 at infinity .",
    "following the same approach as in appendix [ sec : appendix1 ] , the two coupled governing equations in this geometry are given by @xmath402 @xmath403 in the fourier space , these equations are transformed into @xmath404 @xmath405 in order to have an equation for @xmath353 , we eliminate @xmath354 using @xmath406,\\ ] ] and we obtain the solution of the density disturbance in fourier space : @xmath407 of course , the structure of @xmath91 in this case is different than in the axisymmetric case ( eq .  [ eq : fourier_parallel ] ) .",
