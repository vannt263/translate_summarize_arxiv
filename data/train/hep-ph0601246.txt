    "bhabha scattering , @xmath0 , is a crucial process in the phenomenology of particle physics .",
    "its relevance is mainly due to the fact that it is the process employed to determine the luminosity @xmath1 at @xmath2 colliders : in fact , @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is the rate of bhabha events and @xmath5 is the bhabha scattering cross section calculated from theory .",
    "two kinematic regions are of special interest for the luminosity measurements , since in these regions the bhabha scattering cross section is comparatively large and qed dominated . at colliders operating at c. m. energies of @xmath6 ,",
    "the relevant kinematic region is the one in which the angle between the outgoing particles and the beam line is of few degrees .",
    "this , for instance , was the case at lep , where the luminometers were located between 50 and 100 mrad , and it will be also the case at the future ilc ( luminometers between 25 and 80 mrad @xcite ) . at machines operating at c. m. energies of the order of @xmath7 ,",
    "the region of interest is instead the one in which the scattering angle is large ; as an example , at kloe , the luminosity measurement involves bhabha scattering events that take place at angles between @xmath8 and @xmath9 @xcite .",
    "moreover , the large angle bhabha scattering will be employed at the ilc in order to study the beam beam effects that lead to a non monochromatic luminosity spectrum @xcite .",
    "experimentally , bhabha scattering is measurable with a very high accuracy . at lep ,",
    "the experimental error on the luminosity measurement was @xmath10 @xcite . at ilc",
    "it is expected to be of the same order of magnitude or better ( the goal of the tesla forward calorimeter collaboration is to reach , in the first year of run , an experimental error of @xmath11 @xcite ) .",
    "this remarkable accuracy requires , as a counterpart , an equally precise theoretical calculation of the bhabha scattering cross section , in order to keep the luminosity error small .",
    "therefore , radiative corrections to the basic process have to be under control .    in order to match the detector geometry and experimental cuts of any particular machine ,",
    "a monte carlo event generator is needed . in the recent past ,",
    "several groups have been working on monte carlo generators for bhabha scattering , in both the large - angle and small - angle kinematic regions .",
    "the lep theoretical simulations of bhabha events were based on bhlumi @xcite , whose theoretical error , mainly due to missing higher order corrections , is estimated to be @xmath12 ( see for instance @xcite ) .",
    "the kloe collaboration employs the monte carlo event generators babayaga @xcite and bhagenf @xcite , which have an estimated theoretical error of @xmath13 ; within the error claimed , they are in agreement with each other .",
    "moreover , bhwide @xcite and mcgpj @xcite provided valuable checks .",
    "all the mentioned monte carlo programs for bhabha scattering employ the mass of the electron as a cut - off for collinear divergences ; this is to be taken into account when calculating nlo ( @xmath14 ) and nnlo ( @xmath15 ) corrections to the cross section .",
    "the complete @xmath14 corrections to bhabha scattering , in the full electroweak standard model , have been known for a long time @xcite .",
    "the corrections of @xmath15 to the differential cross section in the standard model are not yet known . in recent years",
    ", several papers were devoted to the study of nnlo corrections in pure qed . in @xcite",
    "the second order radiative corrections , both virtual and real , enhanced by factors of @xmath16 ( with @xmath17 , @xmath18 the c. m. energy squared , and @xmath19 the mass of the electron ) where studied .",
    "the complete set of these corrections was finally obtained in @xcite .",
    "this was achieved by employing the qed virtual corrections for massless electron and positrons of @xcite and the results of @xcite , as well as by using the known structure of the ir poles in dimensional regularization @xcite . in @xcite ,",
    "the complete set of photonic @xmath15 corrections to the differential cross section that are not suppressed by positive powers of the ratio @xmath20 was calculated .",
    "the virtual corrections of @xmath15 involving a closed fermion loop , together with the corresponding soft - photon emission corrections , were obtained in @xcite ; no mass expansion or approximation was employed , and the result retains the full dependence on the electron mass @xmath19 .",
    "the calculation was performed by means of the laporta - remiddi algorithm @xcite which takes advantage of the integration by parts @xcite and lorentz - invariance @xcite identities in order to reduce the problem to the calculation of a small set of master integrals .",
    "the master integrals were calculated using the differential equations method @xcite ; their expression in terms of harmonic polylogarithms @xcite is given in @xcite .",
    "several papers deal with the unapproximated calculation of the master integrals necessary for the evaluation of the photonic nnlo corrections @xcite ; in particular , the reduction to master integrals of these corrections is complete , and only the master integrals related to the two - loop boxes have not yet been all evaluated . the status of the calculation of these master integrals is discussed in @xcite . in @xcite , finally , the unapproximated calculation of the photonic vertex contributions to the @xmath15 bhabha scattering cross section , as well as the calculation of the subset of radiative corrections due to the interference of one - loop diagrams ( already considered in @xcite ) was completed .",
    "a few papers discuss the leading nnlo weak corrections to bhabha scattering cross section @xcite .    in summary , the complete nnlo corrections to bhabha scattering in the full standard model are still far from being completely known .",
    "concerning the pure qed contributions , from a phenomenological point of view , all the numerically relevant corrections to the nnlo differential cross section are known , with the only exception of the ones arising from the production of soft pairs , for which only the terms enhanced by @xmath16 with @xmath17 are present .",
    "if we consider instead the exact fixed order calculation , the situation is less satisfactory .",
    "the unapproximated two - loop qed photonic box contributions are still missing .",
    "moreover , it would be interesting to evaluate the corrections arising from diagrams with closed loops of heavier fermions ( like muons or taus ) .",
