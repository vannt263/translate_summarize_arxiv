    "the effects of long - range dispersive interactions ( lri s ) on the dynamics and thermodynamics of soliton - bearing systems have attracted a great deal of interest in the past decade @xcite .",
    "such attention is due to the fact that in realistic physical systems the interparticle forces are always long - ranged to some extent , and if the range of lri s exceeds some critical value , they change soliton features _",
    "qualitatively_. in particular , the competition between short - range and long - range interactions in anharmonic chains @xcite and nonlinear schrdinger ( nls ) models @xcite brings into existence several types of the soliton states . in the nonlocal discrete nls model",
    "two types of stable soliton states can coexist at the same excitation number @xcite .",
    "in other words , there occurs a bistability phenomenon with a possibility of controlled switching between states @xcite . besides , the power law lri manifests itself in algebraic soliton tails @xcite and can give rise to an energy gap between the spectra of plane waves and the soliton states @xcite .    in the present paper",
    "we consider the effects of lri s in discrete klein - gordon ( kg ) models .",
    "these models were successfully used in investigations of a number of physical phenomena such as dislocations in solids , charge - density waves , adsorbed layers of atoms , domain walls in ferromagnets and ferroelectrics , crowdions in metals , and hydrogen - bonded molecules ( see the review paper @xcite for references ) . as it is known @xcite the interparticle interactions in many of these systems are substantially long - ranged .    in the assumption of the harmonic interaction between particles the dimensionless hamiltonian of the discrete kg model can be written in the form @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the displacement of the @xmath2-th particle from its equilibrium position and @xmath3 is the coupling constant between particles @xmath2 and @xmath4 .    as far as we know , until now there was only one investigation @xcite of the kg model with the power law lri .",
    "it was shown that the asymptotics of the kink shape as well as the interaction energy of the kinks are power law and , because of this , the dependence of the peierls - nabarro barrier versus the atom concentration is similar to the `` devil s staircase '' .    but kg models with the exponential law ( usually called kac - baker ) lri @xmath5 were believed to have been investigated in an exhaustive fashion @xcite .",
    "as early as 1981 , sarker and krumhansl found @xcite an analytical kink solution for the @xmath6 model .",
    "the width and the energy of the kinks were found to increase indefinitely as @xmath7 decreases .",
    "an important role of the kac - baker lri in thermodynamics of the system was also shown .",
    "within the decade woafo _",
    "considered in a series of papers @xcite the discreteness effects in the same model .",
    "they have shown that the peierls - nabarro barrier vanishes as @xmath8 .",
    "more recently the sine - gordon ( sg ) model @xmath9 with kac - baker lri ( [ sys : jmn ] ) has been studied @xcite and all results of ref . @xcite have been extended to this model .",
    "an implicit form for the kinks has been obtained and the kink energy and width have been found to grow to infinity as @xmath8 in ref .",
    "the thermodynamics of the system has been thereafter studied in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "thus , the investigations performed in refs . @xcite give the impression that the kac - baker lri always results , in the limit @xmath8 , into infinite increasing of the kink width ( and , therefore , vanishing of the peierls - nabarro barrier ) .",
    "however , closer inspection shows that this conclusion is proper for the case @xmath10 only .    in the present paper",
    "we explore the effects of the kac - baker lri in the discrete sine - gordon model ( [ sys : hamil])-([sys : pot ] ) further so that we could cover the case @xmath11 .",
    "what is more , we investigate the internal kink dynamics and the radiation of moving kinks .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : eqs ] we derive the equation of motion of the system in the continuum limit using the technique of pseudo - differential operators .",
    "then , in sec .",
    "[ sec : kink ] we solve this equation and obtain an implicit analytical form of the kink solution for arbitrary values of @xmath7 and @xmath12 .",
    "turning back to the discrete case we calculate the form of the kinks numerically and compare it with the analytical solution .",
    "we show that in the case of @xmath13 the kinks are _ intrinsically localized_. the calculation of the peierls - nabarro barrier as a function of @xmath7 and @xmath12 finishes the section .",
    "it turns out that the peierls - nabarro barrier vanishes in the limit @xmath8 for @xmath10 but _ remains finite _ for @xmath11 . in sec .",
    "[ sec : internal ] we develop a variational approach to the internal kink dynamics and demonstrate that lri strongly enhances creation of kink s internal modes .",
    "then we validate this result by direct numerical calculations .",
    "we show that similar to the non - sinusoidal peyrard - remoissenet potential @xcite , the kac - baker lri ( [ sys : jmn ] ) with small @xmath7 creates _ several _ kink s internal modes . by this",
    "means our results support the recent conclusion of kivshar _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite that `` the internal mode is a _ fundamental concept _ for many nonintegrable soliton models '' .",
    "moreover , we show that for large values of @xmath12 , for which kink s internal modes do not exist , the kac - baker lri gives rise to pronounced _",
    "quasilocalized modes _ inside of the phonon spectrum . in sec .",
    "[ sec : radiation ] we show that due to break of the lorentz invariance by lri , there are no stationary moving kinks in the system ; arbitrary moving kink will radiate plane waves with the wavelength proportional to its velocity . in sec .",
    "[ sec : summary ] we summarize and discuss the obtained results .",
    "the hamiltonian ( [ sys : hamil])-([sys : pot ] ) generates the equation of motion @xmath14 to obtain its solution analytically we pass to the continuum limit treating @xmath2 as a continuous variable @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is the distance between particles .",
    "thus , using @xmath17 and keeping formally all terms in the taylor expansion of @xmath18 , we can cast eq .",

    "takes on the form @xmath26 where @xmath27 with @xmath28 here the parameter @xmath29 presents a measure for the soliton width  the continuum approximation should be good for large enough values of @xmath29 .",
    "acting on eq .",
    "( [ sys : eq - uz ] ) by the operator @xmath30 one can write the equation of motion in the differential form @xmath31 which coincides with the equation derived in ref . @xcite .",
    "the authors of that paper found the form of the moving kink solution neglecting the term @xmath32 .",
    "thus they have found in fact an exact solution for immobile kinks but approximate for moving ones . in sec .",
    "[ sec : radiation ] we will show that the term @xmath32 is responsible for the non - perturbative radiation of the kink .",
    "indeed , due to break of the lorentz invariance by lri there are no stationary moving kinks in the system  moving kinks always radiate and eventually stop .",
    "it is why in the next section we consider the immobile kinks only and write their exact shape in to some extent more simple and general form than that given in ref .",
    "in this section we obtain the immobile ( @xmath33 ) kink solution of eq .",
    "( [ sys : eq - uz ] ) . denoting this solution as @xmath34 , where @xmath35 and @xmath36 one can see that eq .",
    "( [ sys : eq - uz ] ) takes on the form @xmath37 using a new variable @xmath38 one can rewrite it in the polynomial form @xmath39 and multiplying by @xmath40 one can cast it in the form of the equation of motion of certain hamiltonian system with the hamiltonian @xmath41 imposing the kink s boundary conditions ( @xmath42 when @xmath43 ) we arrive at the constraint @xmath44 .",
    "thus we obtain the equation @xmath45 which after integration gives the kink solution of the form @xmath46 where a new variable @xmath47 is introduced . turning back to the function @xmath34 we obtain an exact form of the kink ( positive sign in eq .",
    "( [ sol : sol - y ] ) ) or antikink ( negative sign ) centered at @xmath48 : @xmath49 where the dependence of @xmath50 on @xmath51 is determined by eq .",
    "( [ sol : sol - y ] ) .",
    "it can be checked that in the nearest - neighbors interaction ( nni ) limit ( @xmath52 ) the solution reduces to the ordinary sg kink or antikink form @xmath53 where we have used the variables @xmath54 and @xmath55 defined in the previous section .    looking at eq .",
    "( [ sol : sol - y ] ) one can see that near the center of the kink , where @xmath50 is small , the first order term in the taylor series vanishes at @xmath56 .",
    "in this case the derivative @xmath57 goes to infinity in the center ( @xmath58 ) of the kink .",
    "it means that the slope of the kink becomes vertical for @xmath56 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : phi - y - form ] ) .",
    "if @xmath59 the slope of the kink assumes negative values and the solution ( [ sol : sol - phi ] ) becomes @xmath60-shaped ( multivalued ) and thus loses its physical meaning .",
    "thus , returning to the initial physical parameters @xmath12 and @xmath7 we can state that there exists a critical value of @xmath12 in the system : if @xmath10 the value of @xmath61 always exceeds @xmath62 and the form of the kink does not change drastically with @xmath7 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : u - n - form]-a ) .",
    "it was this case which was studied in details in refs .",
    "but if @xmath11 there is some critical value of @xmath7 for which @xmath56 and the transition from usual kinks to @xmath60-kinks occurs when @xmath7 decreases ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : u - n - form]-b ) . and",
    "now an interesting question should be raised : what is a physical _ single - valued _ analogue of the @xmath60-kink in the _ discrete _ case ?",
    "the best remedy to answer the above question is to solve eq .",
    "( [ sys : eq - un ] ) numerically .",
    "since for a static solution eq .",
    "( [ sys : eq - un ] ) turns itself into a system of @xmath63 nonlinear algebraic equations ( where @xmath63 is a number of particles ) , it is convenient to use the newton - raphson iterations . to avoid perturbations due to boundary effects ( we use a chain with fixed ends )",
    "the value of @xmath63 was chosen large enough ( typically @xmath64 , but it has been extended to 1000 for broad kinks at small @xmath7 and big @xmath12 ) .",
    "the choice of the initial kink form for zeroth iteration is not very important since for the given problem the newton - raphson iterations are very stable ( but to be specific we used eq .",
    "( [ sol : sol - u - local ] ) for this purpose ) . to obtain a stationary kink shape with the equilibrium positions @xmath65 of the particles in a chain we usually performed 720 iterations .    in figs .",
    "[ fig : u - n - form]-[fig :",
    "u - n - small - j ] we compare the form of the kinks found numerically for different @xmath12 and @xmath7 with the solution ( [ sol : sol - y])-([sol : sol - phi ] ) .",
    "one can see that at small @xmath7 the agreement between them is excellent for all values of @xmath12 .",
    "the only difference is that one should cut out the unphysical part of the @xmath60-kink and replace it with a vertical slope to obtain the form of the kink in the discrete case ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : u - n - small - j ] ) .",
    "in our opinion this result can be understood by reference to a two - component kink structure . indeed , as it was shown in refs .",
    "@xcite for the anharmonic chain with the kac - baker lri between particles , the existence of two length scales results into two - component soliton structure , where the short - range component is dominant in the center of the soliton , while the long - range component ( which can be properly described in the continuum approximation by eq .",
    "( [ sol : eq - b ] ) ) is dominant in the tails .",
    "thus , now we can conclude that in the discrete sg model the lri affects the kinks in two opposite ways in relation to the value of @xmath12 .",
    "when @xmath10 the increasing of the range of lri causes the increasing of the kink width in agreement with the conclusion of ref .",
    "but for @xmath11 the kinks become _ intrinsically localized _ as @xmath8 . in the latter case the form of the kink",
    "is perfectly described by the @xmath60-kink in the tails with a vertical slope in the center .",
    "numerical calculations show that in both cases the kink energy monotonically grows to infinity when @xmath7 decreases to zero .",
    "but the behavior of the peierls - nabarro barrier ( defined as an energy difference of the kink centered on a particle and the kink centered between particles ) completely correlates with the behavior of the kink form ( see fig . [",
    "fig : peierls ] ) .",
    "when ( for @xmath10 ) the kink width grows in the limit @xmath8 , the peierls - nabarro barrier vanishes .",
    "but when ( for @xmath11 ) the kink becomes intrinsically localized in this limit , the peierls - nabarro barrier remains finite .",
    "in the previous section we were concentrating upon the static properties of the kinks . but a considerable interest is also attracted to the phonon spectrum affected by the presence of the kink . it is common knowledge that the influence of the kink is to some extent similar to that of the impurity affecting the phonon spectrum in a solid .",
    "namely , not only quantitative changes in the spectrum , but qualitative ones consisting in emerging the _ localized modes _ with frequencies lying beyond the phonon band are to be expected and present special interest @xcite .",
    "there should be distinguished localized _ internal modes _ from the localized _",
    "translational mode_. the low - frequency translational mode ( which is in the continuum limit the goldstone mode associated with the translational invariance ) is universally present in an arbitrary kg model .",
    "its frequency is closely associated with the peierls - nabarro barrier considered above , so we shall not focus much attention on this mode in what follows ; instead , we shall consider in detail the internal modes .",
    "these latter play an important role in the kink dynamics because they can temporarily store energy taken away from the kink s kinetic energy , which can later be restored again in the kinetic energy .",
    "this gives rise to _ resonant structures _ in kink interactions @xcite .",
    "the most extensively studied is the rice internal mode @xcite which can be visualized as an oscillation of the kink s core width .",
    "although this mode does not exist @xcite in the usual continuum sg model ( which is integrable ) , even small perturbation of the model brings it into the existence @xcite .",
    "in particular , the rice mode exists in the _ discrete _ sg model with nni @xcite .",
    "but the discreteness just changes the dispersion of the system and the _ dispersive _ lri under consideration affects it even greater .",
    "thus , one might expect that the lri will enhance the creation of the rice internal mode in the system being considered . in the next subsection we recourse to a variational approach and show that this is so indeed .",
    "then we investigate kink s internal modes in more detail numerically .",
    "it turns out that at small @xmath7 there can exist either _",
    "kink s internal modes below the phonon spectrum or pronounced _ quasilocalized modes _ inside the phonon spectrum .",
    "when , as with the @xmath66model , the rice internal mode is pronounced it can be properly described by a variational collective coordinates approach @xcite .",
    "proceeding from eq .",
    "( [ sys : exp - sum ] ) and the identity @xmath67 one can pass to the continuum limit ( [ sys : cont ] ) and write the hamiltonian ( [ sys : hamil ] ) in the form @xmath68 where @xmath69 .",
    "it should be emphasized that the rice s collective coordinates approach @xcite can not be used in our case . indeed ,",
    "choosing the trial function of the form @xmath70 , where @xmath34 is the stationary kink solution ( [ sol : sol - y])-([sol : sol - phi ] ) and @xmath71 is a time - dependent variational parameter ( so - called `` effective kink width '' ) , we are unable to integrate analytically the long - range part of the hamiltonian ( [ var : hamil - x ] ) .    thus , we are forced to introduce another trial function .",
    "we call your attention to the fact ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : phi - y - form ] ) that the change of @xmath61 in the kink solution @xmath34 changes a slope of the kink and its width as well . therefore , to describe small - amplitude kink oscillations around its stationary form one can use equally well instead of rice s trial function a trial function of the form @xmath72 where @xmath73 is determined by eqs .",
    "( [ sol : sol - y])-([sol : sol - phi ] ) and @xmath74 is the time - dependent variational parameter .",

    "we just mention that @xmath80 grows to infinity as @xmath81 and has the asymptotics @xmath82 for big values of @xmath83 .",
    "thus the effective hamiltonian of the system takes on the form @xmath84 where the potential energy of the kink @xmath85 as it would be expected , is minimal in the point @xmath86 , where it equals to the energy @xmath87 of the stationary kink .",
    "the kink energy ( [ var : en - kink ] ) was calculated first ( although in a more bulky form ) in ref .",
    ".    for small deviations of @xmath83 from @xmath61 ( in the harmonic approximation ) the effective hamiltonian ( [ var : hamil - eff ] ) generates the equation of motion @xmath88 being the equation of motion for the harmonic oscillator with the frequency @xmath89^{1/2 } \\",

    "[ fig : freq ] .",
    "thus , a slightly excited kink will oscillate around its stationary shape with the frequency @xmath90 , depending upon the parameter @xmath61 which specifies the nonlocality of the system .",
    "when @xmath61 decreases ( nonlocality grows ) the frequency @xmath90 also decreases ( @xmath91 when @xmath92 ) .",
    "although eq .",
    "( [ var : freq ] ) is not fully precise even in the continuum limit ( to improve it an interaction with phonons should be taken into account @xcite ) it is in a good agreement with the numerical calculations ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : freq ] ) which are described below .",
    "the exposed variational approach ( even in a form complicated by introducing of several time - dependent parameters ) permits one to investigate only a limited number of oscillatory modes . to overview rather the entity of the whole phonon spectrum",
    "one should deal with the initial set of the equations of motion ( [ sys : eq - un ] ) . specifically , when all the equilibrium positions @xmath65 of the particles in a chain with a kink become known by the method described in sec .",
    "[ sec : barrier ] , we can study the spectrum of small - amplitude oscillations around this state by looking for a solution of eq .",
    "( [ sys : eq - un ] ) in the form @xmath93 we assume that the deviations @xmath94 of the particles from the kink shape are sufficiently small ( @xmath95 ) and ignore all nonlinear terms in the equations of motion for @xmath94 . introducing this ansatz into eq .",
    "( [ sys : eq - un ] ) , we obtain a system of linear equations that can be written in a matrix form @xmath96 where @xmath97 and a symmetric matrix @xmath98 is the dynamical matrix of the lattice in the presence of a kink with the components : @xmath99 by virtue of the fact that the matrix @xmath98 is symmetric all its eigenvalues are real .",
    "they give us the frequencies of the small - amplitude oscillations around the kink while the corresponding wavevectors describe the spatial profile of each mode .",
    "the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the matrix @xmath98 were calculated numerically using the householder matrix reduction to tridiagonal form and the @xmath100 diagonalization algorithm @xcite .",
    "the obtained results are presented in figs .",
    "[ fig : spectrum - big - alpha ] - [ fig : spectral - density ] . in the following discussion of these results",
    ", we assume that the reader is familiar with ref .",
    "@xcite where the basic features of the kink s linear spectrum are comprehensively expounded .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : spectrum - big - alpha ] we compare the kink s linear spectrum @xmath101 for @xmath102 with the spectrum obtained in ref .",
    "@xcite for the nni limit ( @xmath103 ) .",
    "as it has there been shown , in the discrete sg model with the interaction between nearest neighbors aside from the low - frequency translational localized mode there exist ( slightly expressed in the interval @xmath104 ) the rice internal mode .",
    "one can see from fig .",
    "[ fig : spectrum - big - alpha ] that for @xmath102 the situation remains qualitatively the same , except that the rice mode becomes evidently pronounced .",
    "thus , in agreement with the results of the variational approach , the lri strongly enhances creation of the rice mode ( see also fig . [",
    "fig : freq ] ) .",
    "furthermore , when @xmath7 yet decreases , there occur new qualitative phenomena .",
    "foremost , additional localized internal modes are split out from the bottom of the phonon spectrum .",
    "this process is easily observable in fig .",
    "[ fig : spectrum - j06 ] where the kink s linear spectrum @xmath90 as a function of @xmath7 is plotted for @xmath105 .",
    "one can see that the number of localized modes grows indefinitely as @xmath7 vanishes .",
    "in particular , there are four localized modes at @xmath106 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : spectrum - small - alpha]-a ) and seven at @xmath107 ( see fig . [",
    "fig : spectrum - small - alpha]-b ) .",
    "all the localized internal modes are best pronounced around @xmath108 .",
    "closer analytical examination of eqs .",
    "( [ mod : eq - vn])-([mod : dnm ] ) shows that all eigenstates are either symmetric or antisymmetric .",
    "one can state on the strength of the numerical calculations that the symmetric and antisymmetric states are always alternating , starting with the symmetric translational mode ( mode 1 in fig .",
    "[ fig : local - modes ] ) and antisymmetric rice mode ( mode 2 in fig .",
    "[ fig : local - modes ] ) .",
    "another interesting feature that appears in the kink s linear spectrum at small @xmath7 is that there exist an apparent transformation of the phonon spectrum ( in the plane @xmath109 ) along an imaginary line ( let us call it `` ridge '' ) which extends the localized internal modes inside the phonon spectrum in the direction of larger @xmath12 ( see fig . [",
    "fig : spectrum - small - alpha ] ) .",
    "this ridge is evidently parallel to the upper cut - off frequency of the phonon band , with the spectrum curves looking like essentially different left or right from the ridge . in the domain",
    "right to the ridge each symmetric eigenstate is equidistant from both nearest antisymmetric eigenstates . in the domain",
    "left to the ridge each symmetric eigenstate is paired with an appropriate antisymmetric eigenstate : their frequencies become almost coincident .",
    "the shapes of the symmetric and antisymmetric states in a pair are also in a close correlation : @xmath110 , where @xmath111 is the position of the kink center and @xmath112 is the heaviside function .",
    "the ridge is shifted towards the upper cut - off frequency as @xmath7 grows and completely disappears ( or rather coincides with the upper edge of the phonon band ) in the nni limit ( @xmath103 ) .",
    "the most interesting phenomenon however concerns the shape of the eigenstates in the vicinity of the ridge ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : quasilocal - modes ] ) .",
    "one can see that both above ( e.g. , mode 40 in fig .",
    "[ fig : quasilocal - modes ] ) and below ( e.g. , mode 8 in fig .",
    "[ fig : quasilocal - modes ] ) the ridge the eigenstates are delocalized as it is expected to be in the continuum spectrum . but the shape of the eigenstates undergoes essential changes when approaching the ridge frequency .",
    "namely , such eigenstates practically have no distortion in the oscillatory subspace and thus are _ quasilocalized _ ( see modes 1113 in fig .",
    "[ fig : quasilocal - modes ] ) .",
    "it should be indicated a similarity between these quasilocalized states and the `` exotic states '' investigated in refs .",
    "@xcite , although we could not yet provide an in - depth analysis of this analogy .",
    "it is notable that the quasilocalization of the eigenstates in the vicinity of the ridge frequency is accompanied by pronounced _ densening _ of the eigenstates which can be viewed in fig .",
    "[ fig : spectral - density ] where we plot ( at fixed @xmath7 and @xmath12 ) the density of the eigenstates as function of frequency .",
    "because of this peculiarity inside the phonon spectrum , the ridge of quasilocalized states should be observable experimentally .",
    "we expect that similar to the localized internal modes , the quasilocalized states could play a part in the kink dynamics .",
    "all the preceding was devoted to the properties of immobile kinks . in this section",
    "we go out of this restriction and consider effects of the lri on the moving kinks . to avoid discreteness effects",
    "we assume that @xmath10 and @xmath113 , so that the kinks are broad and the peierls - nabarro barrier can be neglected . in other words",
    "we assume that the kinks are properly described by eq .",
    "( [ sys : eq - uz ] ) .",
    "it is well known that in the limit of short - ranged dispersion ( @xmath114 in eq .",
    "( [ sys : eq - uz ] ) ) the kinks can move without changing their shape and velocity .",
    "in fact , it is a consequence of the lorentz invariance of eq .",
    "( [ sys : eq - uz ] ) for @xmath114 .",
    "but this invariance is broken by the lri ( as well as it would be broken by the discreteness ) .",
    "therefore , one might expect that similar to the discreteness @xcite the lri causes a radiation of moving kinks .",
