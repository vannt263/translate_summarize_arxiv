    ". we reduced and analyzed the data using the interactive analysis of observations ( ciao ) software .",
    "we reprocessed the level 1 event files using the latest gain files and without the pixel randomization which is applied in standard data processing , and filtered on grade , status , and good time intervals supplied by standard processing .",
    "we searched for , but did not find , times of elevated background .",
    "we selected an energy band of 0.5 - 4.5 kev to search for sources with maximum sensitivity while minimizing the background .",
    "we ran two wavelet detection algorithms , the ciao task _ wavdetect _ ( freeman et al .",
    "2002 ) , and the _ pwdetect _ algorithm ( damiani et al . 1997 ) , on acis chip 7 , with similar results . outside the cluster half - mass radius",
    "we select a detection sensitivity designed to identify a maximum of one spurious source on each chip . in this paper",
    "we do not analyze the other four active chips .",
    "we analyze the sources within the half - mass radius of the cluster ( 39 , harris 1996 ) in detail , where we expect only 0.8 background agn above 5 counts in our 0.5 - 4.5 kev detection band ( from giacconi et al .",
    "2001 ) . since globular cluster x - ray sources are generally more massive than the typical cluster star , they tend to concentrate towards the center of dynamically relaxed clusters . within the half - mass radius we increase our detection algorithms sensitivity to identify of order one spurious source , to calculate positions of as many cluster sources as possible",
    ". however , several sources obvious to the eye remained undetected , so we increased the sensitivity to allow calculation of source positions , and applied both algorithms in several energy bands .",
    "we compiled a list of robust ( significance @xmath12 , more than 3 counts , and visually confirmed ) source detections to give a final tally of nineteen sources within the half - mass radius .",
    "these sources , and the extraction regions used for later analysis , are shown in figure 1 along with the core and half - mass regions ( large circles ; astrometry is as calculated in  2.2 below ) .",
    "we give these sources shorthand names ( e.g. cx12 ) which we will use for the rest of this paper , descending with decreasing counts in the 0.5 - 4.5 kev band .",
    "the cluster source names , positions , counts in three bands , and luminosities ( calculated as below ) are listed in table 1 . note that excess unresolved emission remains in the core , probably representing numerous undetected sources , of which the brightest may contribute up to 7 counts .",
    "at least two sources ( cx9 and cx14 ) could be combinations of multiple sources ; however , we expect the bulk of the counts in each to be due to a single source .",
    "we used extraction regions of 125 radius circles for most sources , except for fainter sources in the core and near brighter sources where confusion was an issue , where we used 1or 075 extraction regions .",
    "we extract the counts of our identified sources in four bands ; a soft band ( 0.5 - 1.5 kev ) , a hard band ( 1.5 - 6 kev ) , a detection ( medium ) band ( 0.5 - 4.5 kev ) , and the _ rosat _ band ( 0.5 - 2.5 kev ) .",
    "we define an xcolor ( following ghe01a ) as 2.5@xmath13log(0.5 - 1.5 kev counts/1.5 - 6 kev counts ) .",
    "our exposure map is uniform to within 1% between the locations of different cluster sources , so we do not make exposure corrections to the observed counts .",
    "we extracted counts from a large source - free adjacent background region to estimate the background flux , finding 0.019 counts / pixel in the 0.5 - 4.5 kev band , 0.011 counts / pixel in the 0.5 - 1.5 kev band , and 0.012 counts / pixel in the 1.5 - 6 kev band .",
    "since the chance of having even one background count recorded in any band is less than 25% for our source extraction regions , we do not perform background subtraction upon our extracted numbers of counts , although we do extract background spectra for spectral fitting purposes .",
    "we derive aperture corrections from the percentage of a cxc point - spread function that falls within our extraction circles for 1.6 kev ( the mean energy of the core sources ) , and apply these to the luminosities below .",
    "we also list the positions , colors , and exposure - corrected photon fluxes of sources outside the half - mass radius of the cluster , but on acis chip 7 , in table 2 .",
    "these are derived using the wavelet detection program _ pwdetect _",
    ", with the final detection significance set to 4.5@xmath14 , leading to an expectation of less than one false source per field . a few spurious or multiply - detected sources were removed by hand , leaving 52 sources outside the cluster half - mass radius .",
    "the density of 10-count sources on the rest of the chip ( 0.55 arcmin@xmath15 ) indicates that 2.2 sources should be found between 1 and 2 cluster half - mass radii , while 3 are found .",
    "( only 0.7 sources are expected within the half - mass radius . ) beyond 2 half - mass radii the source numbers are equal to or lower than the mean chip density of 10-count sources . the 1 - 2 half - mass radii overdensity is not significant at even the 1@xmath14 level , but we can not rule out that one or two of these sources are associated with the cluster . assuming a power law spectrum with photon index 1.7 and the cluster @xmath8 , of order 22 background agn should be detected above 10 counts in our band over the entire chip ( giacconi et al .",
    "the 38 sources outside the cluster half - mass radius are thus a significant overdensity , implying a galactic population of x - ray sources in line with the results of ongoing galactic plane and bulge surveys ( e.g. grindlay et al . 2003 ) . however , further analysis of these sources is outside the scope of this paper .",
    "in line with analyses of other clusters ( e.g. pooley et al . 2002a , b , 2003 ) , we restrict ourselves in the subsequent analysis to the sources within the cluster half - mass radius , where massive objects will settle in dynamically relaxed clusters such as m80 .    we create two versions of an `` x - ray color magnitude diagram '' to assist with source classification . in the first version",
    "we follow the formalism of ghe01 , assigning the logarithm of the number of counts in the 0.5 - 4.5 kev band to the y - axis and 2.5 times the logarithm of the ratio of the numbers of counts in the 0.5 - 1.5 kev and 1.5 - 6 kev energy bands to the x - axis ( figure 2 ) .",
    "this version explicitly uses the observational quantities . in the second version we attempt to correct the color uniformly for the cluster absorption .",
    "we use the proposal tool pimms to investigate the effects of an absorbing column of @xmath16 @xmath10 upon the numbers of detected counts in our chosen bands .",
    "we use 0.2 and 0.3 kev blackbody spectra , 1 , 5 , and 10 kev bremsstrahlung spectra , and power law spectra with photon index 1 or 2 , which cover the range of spectral types seen in globular clusters .",
    "we calculate the average difference between the calculated colors and the colors without absorption as 0.305@xmath17 , and calculate new corrected colors for our sources . instead of using counts as the y - axis , we use the luminosity in the 0.5 - 6 kev band , where has its greatest sensitivity .",
    "this provides us with an x - ray cmd which can be compared directly to cmds of other clusters ( figure 3 ) .",
    "we compare figure 3 with the results from 47 tuc ( ghe01 , edmonds et al .",

    "these are essentially cooling tracks for neutron stars , since they show how the x - ray color of the qlmxb should change as the luminosity decreases for a ns of fixed radius . clearly cx2 and cx6 are in agreement with the predictions of these tracks .",
    "harder sources ( -1@xmath19xcolor@xmath191 ) associated with these clusters above @xmath20 ergs s@xmath1 seem to be almost entirely cvs ( ghe01a , ghe01b , pooley et al .",
    "2002a ) , so we identify cx2 , cx3 , cx4 , and cx5 as probable cvs .",
    "two eclipsing cvs in 47 tuc ( w8 and w15 ; ghe01 , edmonds et al . 2003a ,",
    "b ) show xcolor@xmath19 - 1 , due to high intrinsic absorption of the x - rays from the inner disk and/or wd passing through the edge - on accretion disk .",
    "x - ray spectra showing these colors without high intrinsic absorption ( from an accretion disk or other gas in the system ) are highly implausible .",
    "cx15 shows similar colors and luminosities to these systems , so we propose it is also a cv .",

    "soft msps in 47 tuc and ngc 6752 are uniformly less x - ray luminous than any systems in m80 , but the unusual nonthermally - emitting msps in ngc 6397 ( ghe01b ) and 47 tuc ( 47 tuc - w , edmonds et al .",

    "we believe such objects to be rare in globular clusters , but we can not exclude such an object , as our 3.2 s readout time does not allow pulsation searches at appropriate periods . ) therefore we regard our remaining sources as probably predominantly cvs , with some abs and perhaps msps mixed in .",
    "we identify probable cvs , qlmxbs , and unidentified sources with @xmath22 , @xmath13 , and @xmath23 symbols respectively in figures 2 and 3 .",

    "the uncertainty in the _ pwdetect_-derived position of hd 146457 is @xmath25=002 , @xmath26=03 , but our absolute astrometric errors may be slightly increased due to uncertainties in the plate scale and off - axis point - spread function modeling .",

    "although classification by color and luminosity can identify some x - ray sources with certain populations , optical identification of counterparts is necessary to be certain of most classifications .",
    "the full task is beyond the scope of this work , but we do consider previously identified possible counterparts .",
    "shara and drissen ( 1995 ) identified two faint blue stars in m80 that are candidate cvs .",

    "shara & drissen s preferred extrapolation of the auwers ( 1862 ) nova position ( using offsets from bright stars ) is 16:17:02.82,-22:58:32.1 .",

    "hakala et al .",
    "( 1997 ) provide three arguments against the identification of nova 1860 t sco with the ( confused ) rosat m80 x - ray source : the positional discrepancy , the rather high x - ray luminosity , and the rather high x - ray to optical flux ratio .",
    "the positional discrepancy is greatly reduced by the resolution of the rosat m80 source into numerous sources by chandra .",
    "the x - ray luminosity of cx1 is only @xmath27 ergs s@xmath1 ( 0.5 - 2.5 kev ) , compared to the total cluster @xmath28(0.5 - 2.5 kev)@xmath29 ergs s@xmath1 for the rosat pspc observation cited by hakala et al .",
    "( 1995 ) . while high , this luminosity is comparable to that of probable cvs in other globular clusters , e.g. , 47 tuc ( ghe01a ) , ngc 6440 ( pooley et al .",
    "2002a ) , and terzan 5 ( heinke et al .",
    "finally , the ( absorbed 0.5 - 2.5 kev ) x - ray to ( uncorrected v - band ) optical flux ratio ( @xmath30 ) of cx1 , if it is the counterpart of nova 1860 t sco , is 4.5 . while somewhat high for field systems , this is consistent with the range of @xmath30 found for cvs in 47 tuc by edmonds et al .",

    "we note that a fainter undetected cx1 counterpart would increase the @xmath30 ratio , and that in any case the x - ray and optical flux measurements are not simultaneous .",
    "thus we conclude that the association is plausible , but unproven .",
    "further analysis is in progress to look for additional x - ray counterpart candidates and improve the /astrometry .",
    "for the six brightest sources associated with the cluster ( over 50 counts ) , we extract source ( using at least 10 counts per bin ) and ( off - cluster ) background spectra using the ciao script _ psextract _ , and fit the spectra in xspec ( arnaud 1996 ) .",
    "we correct the effective area functions for the time - dependent low - energy quantum efficiency degradation we exclude bins with most photons below 0.3 kev or above 10 kev .",
    "we attempt to fit three models to these spectra , all with photoelectric absorption as a free parameter forced to be equal to or greater than the cluster value ( @xmath16 @xmath10 ) . for all analysis in this paper ,",
    "we use photoelectric absorption x - ray cross - sections of balucinska - church & mccammon ( 1992 ) in the xspec phabs model .",
    "our models are : a thermal bremsstrahlung spectrum as associated with cvs ; a power - law model ; and a hydrogen atmosphere model ( lloyd 2003 ) as appropriate for qlmxbs containing thermal neutron stars with @xmath31 g , with the radius fixed at 10 km .",
    "the dichotomy between harder and softer sources apparent in the x - ray cmds is also clear in the spectral fitting , with cx2 and cx6 showing good fits to the hydrogen atmosphere spectral models while cx1 , cx3 , cx4 , and cx5 do not .",
    "cx2 and cx6 require large values for a powerlaw photon index ( @xmath32 ) and very small bremsstrahlung temperatures ( @xmath33 kev ) , which are not consistent models for any known physical sources at these luminosities .",

    "mekal models ( liedahl et al . 1995 ) give indistinguishable results , given the low metallicity ( [ fe / h]=1.75 ) and high temperatures .",
    "this result confirms our tentative classification of these sources as cataclysmic variables in  2.1 .",
    "we note that cx6 requires a higher @xmath8 than the cluster value for any of our models , while the other sources are consistent with the cluster value .",
    "heinke et al .",
    "( 2003a ) note enhanced @xmath8 towards x5 and x7 in 47 tuc , presumably from gas inside or surrounding the system .",
    "our preferred spectral fits to these six sources are shown in figure 4 , and results for all three models are listed in table 3 .    for the remaining sources within the half - mass radius ( except cx15 , which has a very unusual spectrum ; see  2.1 ) ,",
    "we extract a combined spectrum and fit this to derive the mean spectral shape and luminosity / count ratio .",
    "we extract a total of 235 counts , and fit them with a thermal bremsstrahlung model of kt@xmath35 kev ( for fixed @xmath36 @xmath10 ) , ( @xmath37 for 8 dof ) .",
    "a mekal fit gives very similar results , while fits with a power law or blackbody require very different column densities;. the powerlaw requires @xmath38 @xmath10 with a photon index of 2.4@xmath39 ( @xmath40 for 8 dof ) , while the blackbody fit requires @xmath41 @xmath10 , much less than the cluster value .",
    "these results indicate that the fainter sources have lower temperatures than the bright cvs , as expected for a mix of active binaries and ( perhaps nonmagnetic ) cvs , as seen in 47 tuc ( edmonds et al .",
    "2003a , b ) .",
    "we use the bremsstrahlung spectral fits to derive fluxes . to calculate the luminosities of each of the fainter sources , we multiplied their integrated luminosity by the ratio of each source s counts to the combined source counts ( table 1 ) .",
    "we do this for both the 0.5 - 2.5 kev band and the 0.5 - 6 kev band .",
    "derived luminosity errors are simply poisson or gehrels errors from the detected counts , without including spectral uncertainties , and are thus underestimates .",
    "we extracted event files from each detected source within the half - mass radius and tested them using the iraf _ vartst _ to attempt to disprove the hypothesis that the source flux is constant .",

    "the large flare visible from cx8 is reminiscent of a flare from an ab , but we can not make any firm statements about these sources from their variability alone .",
    "the cramer - von mises and kolmogorov - smirnov tests are naturally far more sensitive to variability from bright sources than faint sources , so the lack of identified variability from faint sources does not indicate that they did not vary during the observation .",

    "this procedure is based on maximum - likelihood fitting of a parameterized form to the radial profile of the source distribution .",

    "it is necessary to correct the source sample for background contamination , and ensure a uniform completeness limit .",
    "we address the latter by using only sources with more than 10 counts , as we are complete to this flux limit from the cluster core out to four half - mass radii .",
    "the expected number of background sources above 10 counts is 0.7 sources within the half - mass radius , 2.2 between @xmath47 , 3.7 between @xmath48 , and 5.2 between @xmath49 .",
    "we correct for background using the monte - carlo procedure described by @xcite .",
    "this procedure is carried out as part of the bootstrap resampling experiment that is used to estimate the confidence ranges for the fit parameters .",

    "a set of background object positions is then generated with a uniform random distribution over this region and the sources that are closest to these positions are removed from the sample for that fitting trial .",

    "the rates of close encounters between stars in globular clusters are thought to scale with the square of the central density , the volume of the core , and inversely with the velocity dispersion , @xmath78 , or for a king model @xmath79 ( verbunt & hut 1987 , verbunt 2003 ) . according to this calculation",
    ", the production of close encounter products in 47 tuc should be 2.1 times larger than in m80 .",
    "this calculation does not account for the detailed dynamical history of the cluster , including factors such as mass segregation , core collapse , and possible destruction of wide binaries in dense environments .",

    "we identify three differences between the two ; a larger core in 47 tuc than m80 , a substantial metallicity difference between 47 tuc and m80 ( [ fe / h ] is -0.76 and -1.75 of solar respectively , harris 1996 ) , and a possibly high tidal destruction rate for m80 in the galactic potential ( dinescu et al . 1999 ; m80 s orbit is somewhat chaotic , which makes this prediction uncertain ) .",
    "the brighter x - ray population of m80 seems to be quite similar to that of 47 tuc ( ghe01a ) ; each have two qlmxbs and three cvs brighter than @xmath20 ergs / s .",
    "this makes m80 somewhat richer than expected , given its smaller core .",
    "differences may appear in the fainter x - ray sources , where m80 has 16 sources harder than qlmxbs above @xmath76 ergs s@xmath1 while 47 tuc has 24 ( inside its half - mass radius , heinke et al . in prep ; ghe01a s smaller area of study identified 18 ) .",
    "47 tuc may have perhaps four times as much x - ray emission from sources below @xmath76 ergs / s , and may have a steeper luminosity function ( see  2.5 and  2.6 above ) .",
    "the fainter sources in 47 tuc are a mixture of abs , faint cvs , and msps ( probably 30 - 40 above @xmath84 ergs s@xmath1 , edmonds et al .",
    "2003b ) . given the existence of two accreting neutron stars in m80 , it seems unlikely that m80 is much poorer in msps than 47 tuc ; but radio timing surveys now underway may soon constrain the m80 msp population .",
    "possible subtle differences between the clusters , if confirmed , may be caused by differences in metallicity or dynamical history , including destruction effects .",
    "a larger group of globular clusters is compared in heinke et al .",

    "( 2003 ) , to investigate these and other differences and their effects on x - ray source production .",
    "m80 is unusual in having over 300 identified blue straggler stars in its central regions ( ferraro et al .",
    "ferraro and collaborators claim that stellar density alone can not explain this large number ( citing the much smaller number in 47 tuc ) , and suggest that the large blue straggler population in m80 may be due to its dynamical state on the edge of core collapse . at this stage",
    "globular clusters are expected to destroy their binary populations to avert core collapse , possibly producing large quantities of blue stragglers ( e.g. fregeau et al .",
    "2003 ) . however , we note that a similarly thorough search for blue stragglers over the central several core radii of 47 tuc has not yet been done .",
    "ferraro et al . ( 1999 ) s observations of m80 included roughly three core radii on the pc chip , and their searches also extended to the wf chips .",
    "ferraro et al . ( 2001 ) identified 43 blue stragglers in just one pointing of pc images of 47 tuc ( which did not fully cover the core ) .",
    "this included 36 @xmath850.8 magnitudes in @xmath86 above the turnoff , comparable in brightness to the 129 bright blue stragglers identified in m80 by ferraro et al .",
    "( 1999 ) . assuming a radial distribution of blue stragglers in 47 tuc similar to that in m80 ( ferraro et al .",
    "1999 ) , we may expect some 130 bright blue stragglers in 47 tuc , similar to the m80 population .",
    "considering the similarity in the x - ray source populations , this suggests that many blue stragglers are produced by the same mechanisms that produce x - ray binaries .",
    "ferraro et al .",
    "( 2003 ) indeed find a good correlation between central density and blue straggler specific frequency for most globular clusters they study , although another formation route ( probably primordial binaries ) seems to be required to explain the blue stragglers in low - density environments such as ngc 288 and the outer regions of m3 .",
    "it will be of interest to see if these other routes also produce x - ray sources .",
    "the globular cluster m80 has a varied x - ray population similar to that of 47 tuc ( ghe01a ) , including two soft sources that are probable qlmxbs , numerous hard sources that are probable cvs ( including one probable high - inclination system with high extinction ) , and a sizable population of fainter x - ray sources .",
    "the two bright soft sources fall upon a calculated neutron star cooling track in an x - ray cmd and are spectrally fit with hydrogen - atmosphere neutron star models .",
    "the brightest cv in the cluster may be the x - ray counterpart of the old nova 1860 t sco .",
    "the radial distribution of the x - ray sources above 10 counts indicates an average system mass of @xmath87 @xmath3 , and is similar to the distribution of blue stragglers in the cluster .",
    "this is consistent with a mix of binaries containing neutron stars and lighter binaries .",
    "the overall x - ray population is slightly larger than expected when the cluster parameters are compared to those of 47 tuc ; this may be connected to the cluster s unusual orbit .",
    "the blue straggler population in m80 may be similar to that in 47 tuc , and we hope that further theoretical and observational studies will probe the connections between these different tracers of binary hardening and exchange .",
