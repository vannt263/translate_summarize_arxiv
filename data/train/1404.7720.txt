    "optical bistability is a benchmark of nonlinear light - matter interaction .",
    "initially , many decades ago , it has been demonstrated for a macroscopic nonlinear medium , typically a saturable absorber or a kerr - type dispersive medium , in a fabry  prot - type optical resonator @xcite . the effect consists in the multi - valued solution and hysteresis in the transmitted output mean - field intensity for a certain range of the input power and frequency .",
    "subsequently , owing to the development of high - finesse optical microresonators , the bistability effect could be observed at much lower light excitation level , with the medium size also reduced to hundreds of atoms @xcite .",
    "optical bistability can be theoretically described in the frame of a semiclassical mean - field approach based on the lossy and driven jaynes ",
    "cummings model .    with the advent of the strong coupling regime of cavity quantum electrodynamics ( qed ) , however , a much more refined picture of the non - linearity in the matter - light coupling must be conceived .",
    "the figure of merit is the saturation photon number @xmath0 which defines that intracavity intensity where the atomic response to excitation becomes nonlinear according to the classical theory .",
    "today , cavity qed extends to the range of @xmath1 which indicates an obviously quantum regime in the light - matter interaction .",
    "interestingly , some remnants of semiclassical bistability could be observed in a strong - coupling cavity qed system with only a few degrees of freedom and operated in the regime of @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "however , more generally , the nonlinear input - output relation is manifested beyond the mean - field level .",
    "dramatic effects can occur in the quantum statistics of the output field intensity and it can give insight directly to the anharmonic energy spectrum of the coupled atom - field system @xcite . provided the low - lying excitation levels are spectrally resolved , various quantum applications can be envisaged .",
    "a prominent example is the photon blockade @xcite , i.e. , when a single - photon pulse can be transmitted through the cavity but not a two - photon or higher one @xcite .",
    "another useful application is squeezed - light generation by a single atom @xcite .",
    "ultimately , stationary photon number states can also be prepared in the cavity @xcite .",
    "microwave circuit qed systems reached an unprecedented strong coupling regime of cavity qed , with saturation photon number @xmath3 .",
    "the ratio of @xmath4 ( coupling parameter between a single mode of the stripline resonator and the artificial atom ) to the loss rates is far larger than in atomic cavity qed realizations : typically @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is the cavity mode linewidth , and @xmath7 is the characteristic decay rate of the electronic dipole system @xcite .",
    "this is the regime which we refer to as ` extreme ' strong in the title . here",
    ", the formal semiclassical mean - field solution is expected to be invalid in general .",
    "an exception is the special case of very large detuning between the mode and the resonance of the artificial atom @xcite since the large detuning reduces the effective coupling between the two quantum systems . in this case",
    ", dispersive bistability can be expected and interpreted semiclassically @xcite , which is used , for example , for high - fidelity qubit readout @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we explore the nonlinear input - output relation of a resonator - driven circuit or cavity qed system in a broad frequency and intensity range of the driving . the resonator mode and the artificial atomic systems",
    "are assumed to be resonant .",
    "two distinct frequency domains of the driving field can be identified : ( 1 ) for large detuning from the resonator mode , resolved multi - photon transitions in the low - excitation part of the jaynes  cummings ladder appear ; ( 2 ) by tuning the external drive closer to resonance with the mode , the system evolves into a bistability - like steady - state .",
    "it is a mixture of two ` semiclassical ' states , represented by a two - peaked wigner quasi - distribution function in phase space .",
    "this is an unexpected result since the robust semiclassical bistable state is generated by a single atom .",
    "this solution is not connected by any limiting procedure to the result that could be obtained from an _ ab initio _ semiclassical description .",
    "moreover , the bimodal wigner function is not present in the case of exact resonance , as opposed to the familiar case of semiclassical absorptive bistability .",
    "the paper is structured as follows . in section [ sec :",
    "model ] , we introduce the model and present the semiclassical mean - field solution for later reference . section [ sec : nonlinearspectrum ] is devoted to the nonlinear features appearing in the mean - field cavity transmission as the pump intensity and frequency are tuned .",
    "we show that for pump intensities beyond the linear response regime , multi - photon resonances appear in contrast to the semiclassically expected dispersive bistability . as the main result of this paper , in section [ sec : quantumbistability ]",
    ", we present a bistability solution emerging in a frequency range where the multi - photon transitions are of very high order and can not be excited at the given pump intensity .",

    "the decreasing weight and the increasing photon number of the secondary peak are the two competing tendencies which govern the variation of the mean photon number .",
    "it is interesting that the combination of small photon numbers with large weight and larger photon numbers with small weight in the mixed steady - state density matrix amounts to the same mean photon number as the one derived from the _ ab initio _ semiclassical theory on the rising slope of the peak , cf .",
    "the agreement with the semiclassical dashed blue curve in the range @xmath104 in figs .",
    "[ fig : spectrum_n1 ] . note that the semiclassical solution in this range is simply that of an driven cavity without atoms .",
    "although the mean field description accidentally yields a correct mean intensity in this limited range of detuning , it does not account for the highly non - trivial photon number distribution .",
    "the bistability associated with such a two - peaked wigner function can be easily seized in the temporal behaviour .",
    "we plot the time evolution of the instantaneous quantum average of the photon number operator along the simulated quantum state trajectory .",
    "this is presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : trajectories ] .",
    "s. the telegraph signal is the temporal behavior in the bistability domain .",
    "parameters are the same as in fig .",
    "[ fig : spectrum_n1](d ) , the given value of detuning is marked by the vertical dashed line on those figures as i , @xmath105 in units of @xmath4.,title=\"fig : \" ] +    an arbitrary period of 30@xmath106s long after the initial transient is displayed for the detuning marked by i in [ fig : spectrum_n1](d ) .",
    "the quantum trajectory of the average intensity shows the alternation of periods with finite photon number around @xmath107 and periods where the state is close to the ground state .",
    "the evolution is reminiscent of a telegraph signal exhibiting a long time scale associated with the switching time between the two attractors .",
    "one can distinguish the fluctuations induced by quantum jumps , i.e. , the small wiggling of the mean intensity plateau at about @xmath107 , from the sharp upsurges associated with switching .",
    "fluctuations are due to the dissipative processes , whereas the switching originates from a highly nonlinear dynamics .",
    "the emergence of the characteristic switching time explains the vanishing of the mean photon number in figs .",
    "[ fig : spectrum_n1 ] when the detuning reaches the close vicinity of @xmath82 .",
    "the systematic variation of the steady - state photon number distribution with the two peaks as described above in connection with fig .",
    "[ fig : photondistribution ] , is not expected to change at this detuning range . however , as the secondary peak moves away and the separation of the attractors increases , the switching time diverges and the steady state can not be reached within the finite duration of the numerical simulation .",
    "this statistical effect explains also why the quantum bistability peak in fig .",
    "[ fig : spectrum_n1 ] is quite noisy : it takes very long time to accumulate a sufficiently good statistics .",
    "the suppression of the mean photon number at @xmath82 is thus simply a finite - time effect .",
    "it has a remarkable consequence : the bistability feature at exact resonance @xmath108 , i.e. , absorptive bistability can not be observed in reasonable time .",
    "circuit qed setups represent systems reaching hitherto unexplored regimes of the jaynes - cummings model .",
    "the qubit - photon coupling is so strong that the saturation photon number is tiny .",
    "the so - called optical bistability effect , which relies on the nonlinearity of the atom - light interaction , vanishes and there is no quantum limit of this effect for such a fractional saturation photon number . on one hand , the nonlinear response of the coupled qubit - photon system can directly reflect the anharmonic spectrum of the driven jaynes - cummings model .",
    "this response is dramatically nonlinear , since it involves multi - photon resonances . on the other hand",
    ", we identified a detuning range without multi - photon resonances in which the quantum system evolves into a bistability - like steady - state .",
    "the system sporadically flips between the ground state and a highly excited quasi - classical state with well - defined phase and amplitude .",
    "this solution with amplitude bimodality , obtained at finite detuning between the drive and the cavity mode frequencies , is markedly different from the spontaneous dressed - state polarization that has been predicted for the resonant case and @xmath109 @xcite .",
    "further work is needed to clarify the relation of these two solutions , e.g. , to investigate the effect of gradually increasing @xmath7 from zero . in the present work we performed numerical simulations at the borders of current possibilities . in other words , these phenomena are at the limit where the deeper insight into jaynes - cummings physics calls for experimental approach and veritable quantum simulation .",
