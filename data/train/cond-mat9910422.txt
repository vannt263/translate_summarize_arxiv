    "the genetic information of all organisms except for so - called rna - viruses is encoded in thier dna sequences .",
    "a dna sequence is a long unbranched polymer made of four different kinds of monomers  nucleotides .",
    "as long as the encoded information is concerned we can ignore the fact that dna exists as a double helix of two `` conjugated '' strands and treat it as a one - dimensional symbolic sequence made of four letters @xmath1 , @xmath2 , @xmath3 , and @xmath4 , representing the nucleotides @xmath5 , @xmath6 , @xmath7 , and @xmath8 , respectively . since the first complete genome of a free - living organism , _ mycoplasma genitalium _ , was sequenced in 1995 the number of available complete genomes has been growing steadily . as of 15 october 1999",
    "there are in total 4 864 570 sequences containing 3 841 163 011 letters in the _ genbank_@xmath9 . among these sequences",
    "there are more and more complete genomes , including 23 bacteria and a few eukaryotes .",
    "the availability of complete genomes of organisms allows one to ask many questions of global nature .",
    "for example , a biochemist might look at all enzymes that catalyze the thousands of biochemical reactions in a cell that make life going and to infer the whole network of metabolic pathways .",
    "perhaps the simplest global question one can imagine consists in whether there exist short strings made of the four letters that do not appear in a genome .",
    "first of all , this is a question that can be asked only nowadays when complete genomes are at our hands , as it does not make sense when dealing with small pieces of dna segments .",
    "secondly , as it will become clearer when we introduce some notions from language theory , there is a deeper reason to ask this question since in a sense a complete genome defines a language which is entirely specified by a minimal set of `` forbidden words '' .",
    "the visualization scheme of the string composition of long dna sequences described early in @xcite inspires a few neat mathematical problems which can be solved precisely by using at least two different approaches .",
    "brief accounts of these solutions are scheduled to appear in two conference proceedings@xmath10 .",
    "the data collected in tables  [ tab1 ] and  [ tab2 ] are presented for the first time . as language theory approach and",
    "the combinatorial technique used in the work may be quite instructive for other problems we think it appropriate to present them in more details in this review in order to enable more physicists to make acquaintance with these methods .",
    "given a bacterial complete genome of length  @xmath11 , i.e. , a linear or circular dna sequence made of @xmath11 letters from the alphabet @xmath12 , we are interested in the frequency of appearance of various strings of length  @xmath13",
    ". there are @xmath14 possible different @xmath13-strings so we need that many counters to do the counting .",
    "we display the counters in a fixed - size square frame on a computer screen .",
    "the frames for @xmath15 , 2 , and 3 would look like what are shown in fig .  [ f1 ] .",
    "if we present the @xmath15 frame as a @xmath16 matrix @xmath17,\\ ] ] then the @xmath18 frame is just a direct product of two copies of @xmath19 : @xmath20.\\ ] ] in general , a @xmath13-frame is given by @xmath21 whose element is expressed via the elements of the @xmath16 matrices as @xmath22 in order to facilitate the computation , it is better to use binary indices for the matrix @xmath19 , i.e. , let @xmath23 the indices @xmath24 follow from the input sequences @xmath25    by sliding a window of width  @xmath13 along the genome we get @xmath11 or @xmath26 total counts for a circular or linear sequence .",
    "every segment of length @xmath13 in the input sequence , taken as a number in base  4 , points to the array element of its own counter . in order to implement this",
    "we introduce a mapping @xmath27 for each letter in the input sequence .",
    "for the first @xmath13-string @xmath28 of the input sequence we get a number @xmath29 which is nothing but the index used to locate its counter . in order to get the new index @xmath30 for the next @xmath13-string ,",
    "it is enough to discard the contribution of the first letter in the previous string and take into account the next new letter .",
    "this is easily done by using binary operations : @xmath31    we display the @xmath14 counters as a @xmath32 square on the screen .",
    "the counter for the first @xmath13-string is centered at @xmath33 : @xmath34 where @xmath35 means logical and with the base-4 unit @xmath36 and @xmath37 means left shift by one .",
    "again , for the location @xmath38 of the next @xmath13-string one needs only to correct for the new input letter : @xmath39 we note that this leads to a counting algorithm that depends only on the total length @xmath11 of the genome but not on the string length  @xmath13 .",
    "this saves some computer time when @xmath13 gets large .    applying the above algorithm to the @xmath40 strings in the 4 693 221-letter long genome of _",
    ", we get the picture shown in fig .",
    "[ ecoli ] . and  [ mjan ] or the postscript file of this preprint to see colors . ]    [ ecoli ]",
    "we have used a very crude color code of 16 colors , including black and white .",
    "as our attention is concentrated on those strings that do not appear or that are under - represented , we allocate most of the bright colors to small counts with white color representing avoided strings .",
    "this is a kind of coarse - graining which makes some features of the figure more prominent . in particular , the presence of some seemingly regular patterns in fig .",
    "[ ecoli ] may be understood as caused by under - representation of strings that contain @xmath41 as a substring . in fig .",
    "[ templates ] we show the counting frames for @xmath42 , 7 , 8 , and 9 in which the locations of strings that contain @xmath41 , or in short , @xmath41-tagged strings , are marked with a small rhombic . we see that the basic features remain unchanged while more and more fine patterns appear with @xmath13 increasing .",
    "the most clearly seen patterns in the _ e. coli _ portrait are indeed given by these @xmath41-tagged strings .",
    "[ ecoli ] is to be compared with the `` portrait '' of a sequence ( not shown ) , obtained by randomizing the _ e. coli _ genome , i.e. , a sequence with the same number of nucleotides of each kind but with their positions shuffled at random .",
    "in such a figure all the characteristic patterns disappear , only some hardly perceptible contrast due to the @xmath43 to @xmath44 ratio not being equal may be noticed under a careful scrutiny .",
    "[ templates ]    _ e. coli _ is not the only bacterium that does not like the @xmath41 substring . now 9 bacteria are known to have a tendency of having under - represented @xmath41-tagged strings .",
    "other bacteria may avoid some other substrings and some may not show any apparent patterns of avoided substrings .",
    "for example , fig .",
    "[ mjan ] shows the `` portrait '' of _ methanococcus jannaschii_. using templates of various tetranucletides similar to those shown in fig .",
    "[ templates ] , one can identify at least five sets of under - represented strings tagged by @xmath41 , @xmath45 , @xmath46 , @xmath47 , and @xmath48 .",
    "a summary of what has been seen in `` portraits '' of all available bacterial complete genomes is given in table  [ tab1 ] .",
    "the fact that most of the under - represented tetranucleotides are palindromes , i.e. , words that happen to be the same when read in both direct and reversed directions with the watson - crick conjugation being performed at reverse reading , may hints on their relation with the recognition sites of some restriction enzymes .",
    "this has been known to the biologists for some time , see , e.g. , @xcite .",
    "our observation shows its a quite common phenomenon in many bacterial complete genomes .",
    "it is appropriate to mention the relation of the above visualization scheme to the `` chaos game representation '' ( cgr@xmath49 ) of dna sequences . in cgr",
    "the final picture can only be drawn in black / white and may look quite similar to what one would obtain in the above visualization scheme after xeroxing the color figures on a black / white copying machine .",
    "there are , however , several essential differences .",
    "first , the resolution is not entirely under control in cgr , as different neighboring nucleotides may be resolved to a different precision , depending , say , on the direction of the line joining the nucleotides .",
    "our method works at a fixed resolution  the string length .",
    "second , the algorithm of cgr looks a bit more complicated : put @xmath1 , @xmath2 , @xmath3 , and @xmath4 at the four corners of a square ; staring from the center of the square plot the middle point of the straight line connecting two consecutive nucleotides one by one .",
    "the results turn out to be much the same as simple counting with fixed string length .",
    "third , if one wish to introduce color in order to add more information one should calculate the density of points in cgr  an operation that requires big memory and that can not be realized in a single pass .",
    "therefore , it seems to us that the proposed visualization scheme makes cgr obsolete .",
    "in genomes of organisms there are no fractals in the rigorous mathematical sense . however , in our visualization scheme fractals may be well defined in the non - biological @xmath50 limit .",
    "these fractals may have some suggestion in the portraits of genomes of real organisms .",
    "just look at the templates shown in fig .",
    "[ templates ] , one naturally sees what left in the original framework after deleting all small squares at finer and finer scales that represent all possible @xmath41-tagged strings does lead to a fractal .",
    "what is the fractal dimension of the complementary pattern defined by one or more given tags ?",
    "this is not a trivial question as besides obvious self - similarity one has to deal with self - overlappings of the excluded patterns at different levels .",
    "let us look at two simple examples .",
    "the first example is the case of a one - letter tag , e.g. , @xmath3-tagged strings .",
    "denote by @xmath51 the number of strings of length  @xmath13 that do not contain the letter  @xmath3 . at the zeroth level the linear size is @xmath52 , that is the size of the whole square . since there is only one empty string which by definition does not contain  @xmath3 we have @xmath53 . at the next @xmath15 level ,",
    "the linear size is @xmath54 and among the four squares of that size three do not contain  @xmath3 , see the leftmost square in fig .",
    "therefore , we have @xmath55 . in general , we have @xmath56 and @xmath57 .",
    "the fractal dimension is @xmath58 in this simple example , we might have defined a trivial recursion relation for @xmath51 , namely , @xmath59 using the recursion relation one may derive a generating function @xmath60 for all @xmath51 : @xmath61 where @xmath62 is an auxiliary variable .",
    "in fact , one - letter - tagged strings exclude the largest number of @xmath13-strings , leaving a set of strings over an alphabet of three letters .",
    "this is the meaning of @xmath57 and this tells us that for any possible tags the dimensions are included in between the limits : @xmath63    next , look at @xmath64-tagged strings .",
    "we first note that it is an known fact that in many human genes the dinucleotide @xmath64 is less represented than , e.g. , the dinucleotide @xmath65 .",
    "this leads to a characteristic pattern in the portrait of the dna sequence that contain the gene . as seen from the template for the @xmath64-tag , shown in fig .",
    "[ cg_tag ] , the exclusion starts at the level @xmath18 : among the 16 possible dinucleotides only @xmath64 is avoided . at @xmath66 level , among the 64 trinucleotides the four combinations @xmath67 are excluded in addition to the four @xmath68 which have already been excluded at the @xmath18 level .",
    "so far , no overlap of exclusions has taken place . however , at the next @xmath69 level , one of the 16 @xmath70 type squares , where @xmath71 , namely , @xmath45 , is immersed in the @xmath18 excluded square and should not be doubly counted .",
    "there are 8 such overlaps at @xmath72 , 47 at @xmath42 ( not shown in fig .",
    "[ cg_tag ] ) , etc .",
    "the question is how to take into account these overlaps automatically .",
    "suppose we know how to calculate the generating function @xmath73 then the fractal dimension is given by @xmath74 where we have used the fact that @xmath56 . according to the cauchy criterion the radius of convergence of the series  ( [ eq1 ] ) defining the generating function",
    "is determined by @xmath75 where @xmath76 being the minimal module zero of @xmath77 .",
    "thus if we know the generating function , the fractal dimension is given by @xmath78 therefore , the problem of calculating the fractal dimensions reduces to that of finding the generating functions . this will be treated in sections  [ s5 ] and  [ s6 ] by using two different methods .",
    "we shall see that for the @xmath64-tagged strings the generating function is @xmath79 see table  [ t1 ] . consequently , @xmath80 and @xmath81 .",
    ".under - represented tetranucleotides seen in the bacterial genomes . [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     the negative numbers in the last row of table  [ t3 ] show the difference between @xmath51 and @xmath14 .",
    "they are precisely the coefficients in the expansion  ( [ eq13 ] ) of @xmath82 , shown at the end of section  [ s52 ] .",
    "we see that the transfer function and the incidence matrix contain more detailed information on the combinatorial problem than the generating function alone .",
    "the implication of this approach needs to be further elucidated .    in order to avoid any confusion we emphasize that the minimal deterministic automaton defined by the transfer function given in table  [ t2 ] accepts a regular language determined by the set @xmath83 of four forbidden words",
    "this language is larger than the language @xmath84 obtained from the complete genome of _ aquifex aeolicus_. by including more and more avoided strings into the set @xmath83 the minimal automaton gets larger but the language it accepts approaches @xmath84 gradually .",
    "however , the calculation becomes tedious .",
