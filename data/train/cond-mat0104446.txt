    "ce@xmath11rhin@xmath12 ( @xmath13 or 2 ) crystallize in the quasi - two - dimensional ( quasi-2d ) tetragonal structures ho@xmath11coga@xmath12 , and both are moderately heavy - fermion antiferromagnets ( @xmath3 mj / mol - ce k@xmath14 for both systems above @xmath15 k for@xmath16 and 2.8 k for @xmath17 ) .",
    "the evolution of the ground states of cerhin@xmath0 as a function of applied pressure , including a pressure - induced first - order superconducting transition at 2.1 k , is unlike any previously studied heavy - fermion system and is attributed to the quasi-2d crystal structure @xcite . in a similar manner to cerhin@xmath0",
    ", @xmath5 is seen to change only slightly with pressure and abruptly disappear in ce@xmath1rhin@xmath2 , though superconductivity has not yet been observed @xcite .",
    "a previous zero field heat capacity study on cerhin@xmath0 revealed that the anisotropic crystal structure leads to a quasi-2d electronic and magnetic structure @xcite .",
    "we have performed measurements of the heat capacity in applied magnetic fields for cerhin@xmath0 and ce@xmath1rhin@xmath2 in an attempt to further understand the electronic and magnetic properties of these compounds .",
    "we find that for magnetic fields applied along the tetragonal @xmath18-axis , both systems behave like typical heavy - fermion compounds @xcite as both @xmath5 and @xmath19 decrease as field is increased .",
    "very different behavior is seen when the field is directed along the @xmath20-axis as @xmath5 is found to increase and numerous field - induced transitions , both of first- and second - order , are observed .",
    "these transitions correspond to magnetic field - induced changes in the magnetic structure . in agreement with what one might expect ,",
    "the magnetic properties seem less 2d as the crystal structure becomes less 2d going from single layer cerhin@xmath0 to double layer ce@xmath1rhin@xmath2 ( note that as @xmath21 , one gets the 3d cubic system cein@xmath22 ) .",
    "single crystals of ce@xmath11rhin@xmath12 were grown using a flux technique described elsewhere @xcite .",
    "the residual resistivity ratio between 2  k and 300  k using a standard 4-probe measurement and was found to be greater than 100 for all measured crystals , indicative of high - quality samples .",
    "a clear kink was observed in the resistivity at @xmath15 k for cerhin@xmath0 and @xmath23 k in ce@xmath1rhin@xmath2 .",
    "magnetization measurements have shown that the effective magnetic moment is slightly reduced from the value expected for ce@xmath24 due to crystal fields thompson01 .",
    "the specific heat was measured on a small ( @xmath25  mg ) sample employing a standard thermal relaxation method .",
    "the single crystals were typically rods with dimensions from 0.1 to 10 mm with the long axis of the rod found to be along the @xmath26 axis of the tetragonal crystal .",
    "the samples were found to crystallize in the primitive tetragonal ho@xmath11coga@xmath12-type structure grin79,grin86 with lattice parameters of @xmath27 nm and @xmath28 nm for @xmath13 and @xmath29 nm and @xmath30 nm for @xmath17 hegger00,thompson01 .",
    "the crystal structure of ce@xmath11rhin@xmath12 can be viewed as ( cein@xmath22)@xmath11(rhin@xmath1 ) with alternating @xmath31 cubic ( cein@xmath32 ) and one ( rhin@xmath1 ) layers stacked along the @xmath18-axis . by looking at the crystal structure",
    ", we would expect that af correlations will develop in the ( cein@xmath22 ) layers in a manner similar to bulk cein@xmath22 lawrence80 .",
    "the  af  ( cein@xmath22 ) layers will then be weakly coupled by an interlayer exchange interaction through the ( rhin@xmath1 ) layers which leads to a quasi-2d magnetic structure .",
    "this has been shown to be true as the moments are af ordered within the tetragonal basal @xmath20-plane but display a modulation along the @xmath18-axis which is incommensurate with the lattice for cerhin@xmath0 @xcite .",
    "as @xmath31 is increased , the crystal structure should become more 3d ( @xmath33 being the 3d cubic system cein@xmath22 ) and the effects of the interlayer coupling should become less important causing the magnetic and electronic structure to be more 3d . indeed , the magnetic structure in ce@xmath1rhin@xmath2 does not display an incommensurate spin density wave ( sdw ) @xcite .    the zero field data from specific heat measurements are shown in fig .",
    "a peak at @xmath5 is clearly seen for both samples , indicating the onset of magnetic order .",
    "the entropy associated with the magnetic transition is @xmath34 with the remaining @xmath35 recovered by 20 k for both @xmath13 and 2 .",
    "for @xmath36 the data could not be fit by simply using @xmath37where @xmath38 is the electronic specific heat coefficient and @xmath39 is the lattice debye term .",
    "as found previously , one needs to use isostructural , nonmagnetic la@xmath11rhin@xmath40 to subtract the lattice contribution to @xmath41 @xcite .",
    "after subtracting the lattice contribution , it is still difficult to extract a value of @xmath38 from the data .",
    "however , by performing a simple entropy balance construction , a value of @xmath42 mj / mol - ce k@xmath4 is found for both @xmath13 and 2 .    for temperatures below @xmath5 , as found before on cerhin@xmath0 cornelius00 , the magnetic heat capacity data , where the corresponding la compound is used to subtract the lattice contribution , can be fit using the equation@xmath43where @xmath19",
    "is the zero temperature electronic term , @xmath44 is the standard af magnon term , and the last term is an activated af  magnon term .",
    "the need for an activated term to describe heat capacity data been seen before in other ce and u compounds cornelius00,bredl87,dijk97,murayama97 , and the term rises from an af sdw with a gap in the excitation spectrum due to anisotropy .",
    "as discussed previously , the cerhin@xmath0 magnetic structure indeed displays an anisotropic sdw with modulation vector ( 1/2,1/3,0.297 ) @xcite which is consistent with this picture .",
    "the inset to fig .",
    "[ cp ] shows the data for @xmath45 and the lines are fits to eq .",
    "[ magnon ] for @xmath46 .",
    "we find that the the activated term is notnecessary to fit the ce@xmath1rhin@xmath2 data .",
    "rather , there appears to be a small feature in the heat capacity centered around 2 k whose origin is unknown .",
    "this feature is also observed in transport measurements and is known to persist as a function of pressure @xcite .",
    "a summary of the fit parameters , along with data on cein@xmath22 @xcite , is given in table i. these results lead us to the conclusion that the magnetically ordered state in cerhin@xmath0 consists of an anisotropic sdw that opens up a gap on the order of 8 k in the fermi surface , while no such gap is seen in ce@xmath1rhin@xmath2 , consistent with its commensurate structure .",
    "note that the values for cerhin@xmath0 are slightly different from a previous report where the lattice contribution from larhin@xmath0 was not subtracted from the raw data @xcite . from the ratio of the electronic contribution for temperatures above and below @xmath47 we estimate that approximately @xmath48 ( 12% ) of the fermi surface remains ungapped below @xmath5 for cerhin@xmath0",
    "while for ce@xmath49rhin@xmath2 92% of the fermi surface remains ungapped .",
    "the results on cein@xmath22 of berton _ et al .",
    "_ are also shown in table i for comparison where @xmath50 ( 5.6% ) .",
    "clearly , the electronic structure , as evidenced by the ratio @xmath51 becomes more 3d in the ce@xmath11rhin@xmath12 series as @xmath31 is increased @xcite .",
    "[ c115 ] shows the heat capacity in applied magnetic fields for @xmath52 for both compounds ( cerhin@xmath0 on the top and ce@xmath1rhin@xmath2 on the bottom ) .",
    "as the magnetic moments are known to lie within the @xmath20-plane cerhin@xmath0 , the magnetic field is perpendicular to the magnetic moments in the ordered state in this orientation .",
    "the applied field is not sufficient to cause a field - induced magnetic transition in either compound .",
    "rather , it is found that @xmath5 and @xmath19 decrease as @xmath53 is increased as is usually observed in heavy fermion systems @xcite .",
    "[ a115 ] shows the heat capacity in applied magnetic fields for @xmath9 . for both samples ,",
    "the neel point ( the onset of antiferromagnetic order ) , and magnetic field - induced transitions of both first- ( @xmath54 ) and second - order ( @xmath55 ) are clearly observed .",
    "the complete phase diagrams for both cerhin@xmath0 and ce@xmath1rhin@xmath2 showing the various observed transitions are plotted in fig .",
    "[ phasediag ] .",
    "the open symbols correspond to second order transitions ( @xmath5 and @xmath55 ) and the filled symbols represent the first order transition ( @xmath54 ) @xcite .",
    "the dashed lines are merely guides for the eyes .",
    "remarkably , the phase diagrams for both cerhin@xmath0 and ce@xmath1rhin@xmath2 are extremely similar .",
    "region i corresponds to the standard modulated spin density wave that is incommensurate with the lattice as reported previously in cerhin@xmath0 bao00 .",
    "the nature of the first- and second- order transitions going from region i to regions ii and iii are not know , and work is underway to determine the magnetic structures in regions ii and iii . for ce@xmath1rhin@xmath56 , region ii  terminates at 70 koe while for cerhin@xmath0 it extends beyond the highest measured field of 90 koe .",
    "the first order transition going from region i  or region ii to region iii is the same hysteretic field induced transition observed in magnetization measurements on cerhin@xmath0 where an increase in the magnetization of @xmath57 @xmath58ce @xcite .",
    "these results clearly show that ce@xmath1rhin@xmath2 has some 2d electronic and magnetic character .",
    "in summary , we have measured the anisotropic heat capacity in applied magnetic fields in the quasi-2d heavy - fermion antiferromagnets cerhin@xmath0 and ce@xmath1rhin@xmath2 .",
    "the magnetic and electronic properties of cerhin@xmath59 can be well explained by the formation of an anisotropic sdw , leading to a 2d electronic and magnetic structure .",
    "the phase diagram of magnetic field - induced magnetic transitions is remarkably similar for both systems as both a first- and second - order transition are observed in both compounds when the magnetic field is along the tetragonal @xmath20-axis . from the heat capacity measurements , we estimate that 12%(92% ) of the fermi surface remains ungapped below the magnetic ordering temperature for cerhin@xmath60 ( ce@xmath1rhin@xmath2 ) .",
    "the 2d nature of the electronic properties is a result of the tetragonal crystal structure of ce@xmath11rhin@xmath12 which consists of @xmath31 cubic ( cein@xmath22 ) blocks which are weakly interacting along the @xmath18-axis through a ( rhin@xmath1 ) layer .",
    "not surprisingly , it appears that the case of @xmath13 ( cerhin@xmath0 ) is more anisotropic than the double layered ce@xmath1rhin@xmath2 where the amount of ungapped fermi surface below @xmath5 is greater than 90% , as is found for the 3d system @xmath61 cein@xmath22 .",
    "the similarity of the field - induced transitions in both cerhin@xmath0 and ce@xmath1rhin@xmath2 clearly shows that there is still some 2d character to the magnetic properties of ce@xmath1rhin@xmath2 .",
    "the results here shed light on the unusual magnetic and electronic structure of cerhin@xmath0 and ce@xmath1rhin@xmath2 .",
