    "@xcite the plot of the fss has been simplified for the purpose of illustrating the nesting conditions . according to the band structure calculation on the 3d crystal structure with the employ of the linear muffin - tin orbital ( lmto ) method ,",
    "the fs consists of three parts contributed by the p@xmath23 and p@xmath24 orbitals of metallic te layers : @xmath20-centered square like fs , m - centered fs mainly in the second brillouin zone and x / z - centered small - size fs .",
    "here we have unfolded the third part into the second brillouin zone .",
    "then , the fss could be approximately viewed as two @xmath20-centered pieces : inner and outer ones.@xcite the 4__f _ _ electrons of rare earth r are far below the fermi level and have little effect on _",
    "e@xmath1_. since there are two conducting te planes between the insulating _ _ r__te slabs in the crystal structure ( as can be seen from fig .",
    "4(a ) ) , the interlayer coupling of the two neighboring metallic te layers would break the degeneracy of conduction band and yields two nearly parallel fs crossings : bonding band ( bb ) and antibonding band ( ab ) , which is usually called bilayer splitting . @xcite then the fss are all double - wall like .",
    "it is noted that the outer fss come from the band folding effect due to the fact that the real three - dimensional ( 3d ) lattice structure actually doubles the unit cell of te square lattice of the te layers along its diagonal direction , @xcite then the bilayer splitting of inner fss ( s1 and s2 ) and the outer fss ( s3 and s4 ) are just opposite .",
    "since s1 and s2 are nearly parallel and have quite similar fs topology , and the same case applies to s3 and s4 , the nesting between the inner square and outer diamond , which is along _ * * c**@xmath19 _ axis , would have two possible selections : ( a ) s1 nests s3 and s2 nests s4 , ( b ) s1 nests s4 and s2 nests s3 . in case ( a ) , the nesting takes place between two different bands ( interband nesting between bb and ab ) and leads to a single nesting wave vector , and thus a single cdw transition .",
    "it is reminiscent of the blue bronze which , owning two partially filled bands and thus four fs sheets , has only one cdw and undergoes a metal - semiconductor transition .",
    "@xcite in case ( b ) , the nesting happens between the two fs sheets within each band ( intraband nesting within bb and ab ) , which implies two different nesting wave vectors and two separated cdw transitions , as well as two distinct cdw gap energy scales .",
    "our study favors the latter case .",
    "angle - resolved photoemission spectroscopy ( arpes ) measurements reveal that the fss on both bb and ab bands , which locate near the corner along _ * * c**@xmath19 _ axis , were completely removed at 10 k. @xcite meanwhile , two different energy gaps were observed on the two parallel band sheets , a larger gap on bb and the smaller on ab .",
    "@xcite therefore , it could be concluded that the nesting within bb leads to the first cdw order and that in ab causes the third one .",
    "the two cdw orders both occur along _ * * c**@xmath19 _ axis and the nesting vectors _ * * q**@xmath25 _ and _ * * q**@xmath0 _ differ very little since the bilayer splitting is rather small .",
    "the interpretation is supported by the recent studies of the single layer rare - earth di - telluride cete@xmath26 , @xcite where only one cdw order was identified along _ * * c**@xmath19 _ axis since the bilayer splitting is absent .",
    "@xcite it is worthy noting that yao _",
    "et al_. have addressed the question of occurrence of just one ordering transition or two distinct ones , which was determined by the comparison of relevant energy scales _",
    "t@xmath27 _ ( responsible for the bilayer splitting ) and the cdw gap 2@xmath12 .",
    "@xcite the present work clearly indicates that in _ _",
    "r__te@xmath0 series bilayer splitting is of primary importance and it can result in separated cdw orders .",
    "our optical study explicitly reveals the development of a third energy gap in _ _",
    "r__te@xmath0 series upon lowering t , which yields strong evidence for the existence of a new cdw order distinct from the prior two ones .",
    "surprisingly , this order has never been identified by any other techniques before . in the magnetic susceptibility and transport probes",
    ", neither measurement observes clear anomaly in consequence of formation of the third cdw order .",
    "@xcite in fig . 1 , we notice that , in contrast to the pronounced free carrier response and the sizable spectral weight of the other two orders , the peak signature ascribed to gap 3 is much less notable . in fig .",
    "3(d ) we find that just a very small amount of electrons response the third cdw transition .",
    "take cete@xmath0 as an example .",
    "the spectral weight of total free carriers in normal state is _ w = w0 + w1 + w2 + w3 _ and the percentage of the spectral weight lost to each cdw gap is _",
    "@xmath28 = w@xmath29/w_. the fitting results show that _",
    "@xmath31 66% while _",
    "@xmath31 8.9% , which means that about two thirds fss were gapped away in the first cdw transition while in the third one the lost density of states ( dos ) at _ e@xmath1 _ is substantially reduced .",
    "the very small spectral weight of gap 3 gives us some clues to understand the discrepancy .",
    "in magnetic susceptibility measurement of late@xmath0 , @xmath33 exhibits constant diamagnetic behavior .",
    "@xcite la and te are both heavy atoms with many closed shell core electrons .",
    "they collectively contribute considerable diamagnetism which overcomes the small pauli paramagnetism of the free electron gas .",
    "for the other compounds in _ _",
    "r__te@xmath0 , @xmath33 is dominated by the 4__f _ _ electrons and exhibits curie - weiss paramagnetism .",
    "@xcite the effect of little variation of dos near _",
    "e@xmath1 _ due to the third cdw is significantly reduced .",
    "the notion could also apply to the transport measurement , where resistivity _",
    "@xmath34(t ) _ is determined by several factors , e.g. fermi velocity , scattering rate and free carrier density .",
    "the reduction of dos near _",
    "e@xmath1 _ might be compensated by the other two factors . as a consequence ,",
    "this cdw order could have rather weak effect on _",
    "@xmath34(t ) _ and the corresponding signature becomes obscured .    since the bilayer splitting is very small , the two wave vectors",
    "q@xmath25 _ and _ q@xmath0 _ , as well as their associated modulation periodicity , are very close to each other .",
    "moreover , the scattering intensity of cdw superlattice peaks is several orders of magnitude smaller than that of the average structure bragg peaks .",
    "@xcite to distinguish between the first and third cdw orders becomes extremely hard in x - ray scattering measurement . in spite of this , we notice that , the temperature dependent integrated intensity of superlattice peak in tbte@xmath0 shows an evident dip near 150 k , @xcite which was considered as an experimental artifact by the authors .",
    "however , it is very likely that the feature actually signals the presence of the third cdw transition . in the early arpes measurement , the removal gaps on the fs sheets connected by the nesting wave vector",
    "were claimed to be unequal , @xcite which is in sharp contrast to the identical results in the later arpes probe .",
    "@xcite the seemingly controversial results are most likely caused by the bilayer splitting which was investigated in different resolution conditions .    _",
    "_ r__te@xmath0 systems represent a kind of rare compound which experiences multiple cdw transitions .",

    "3(a ) we note that gap 1 and gap 3 coexist in most compounds in the series and display the similar monotonic evolution from light rare - earth to heavier ones .",
    "since the cdw orders are nesting driven , certain difference in the nesting conditions for the two cdw orders should exist .",
    "it is noted that the ab actually exhibits stronger _ * * b**@xmath19_-axis dispersion ( perpendicular to the conduction _ ac_-plane ) and thus worse nesting conditions than bb .",
    "@xcite therefore , bb bears much stronger cdw instability than ab .",
    "the gap amplitude and the affected spectral weight of the first cdw order on bb are both much larger than that of the third one on ab .    the second cdw order , which occurs in the four heavy rare - earth compounds , displays monotonic evolution opposite to the other two ones .",
    "the transition temperature _ t@xmath14 _ , as well as the cdw gap , increases with enhanced chemical pressure , which is rather peculiar since pressure generally suppresses cdw transitions . @xcite in fig .",

    "@xcite    for the four heavy rare - earth compounds , the second cdw order occurring perpendicular to the other two ones , a bidirectional checkerboard cdw ground state would arise .",

    "the pseudogap is believed to be the preformed cooper pairs gap before the coherence necessary for superconductivity ( sc ) , which is rigidly tied to the superconducting phenomenon . in the latter point , the pseudogap is suggested to be a new phase , having no direct relationship with sc , which even competes and is harmful to sc . though the origin is still under debate , there is growing evidence that the pseudogap arises from a checkerboard cdw order with perpendicular wave vectors close to @xmath40 .",
