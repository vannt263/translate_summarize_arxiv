    "the hugoniot curves ( see [ 6 ] ) correspond to the linkage between the velocity @xmath2 and the pressure @xmath3 in a shock wave travelling through a material after an impact . by starting from a position at rest , the algebraic equation of such curves",
    "has the form @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the mass density of the material , @xmath6 is its speed of sound , and @xmath7 is a dimensionless constant retated to this material , obtained from experiments . for water , @xmath8 and @xmath9 by solving with respect to @xmath2 , we get @xmath10 where @xmath11 and @xmath12 whose unit is the inverse of an energy .",
    "we notice the relation @xmath13 the values of these parameters come from [ 5 ] .",
    "1.8ema general one dimension velocity - pressure model , with a constant mass density @xmath5 , is made of a dynamics equation of the form @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the time and @xmath16 is the position along a vertical upwards oriented axis ( with @xmath17 at sea level ) , and a hooke law of the form @xmath18 where @xmath19stands for the pressure depending wave velocity , to be identified .",
    "these two equations compose a hyperbolic system whose riemann invariants have the form@xmath20 by derivating the expression of @xmath21 from the hugoniot curves , one gets @xmath22 identifying the two expressions and using @xmath23 lead to the formula @xmath24 this reads like a state law for our velocity pressure model .",
    "1.8emup to now we were only concerned with homogeneous equations since riemann invariants only exists in this case .",
    "we also have to take in account the gravity effects , since the pressure is increasing with the depth of water , and some friction effect since stillness is a stable configuration .",
    "we use a friction term of the strickler type as usual in hydraulics , but other choices are possible and will lead to similar results .",
    "that way , the dynamics equation is replaced by @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the gravity constant and @xmath27 the friction parameter .",
    "the hooke law and the state law are unchanged , and we take @xmath28 in the numerical experiments . the size of the friction parameter is a priori unknown and will be discussed later .",
    "we look for a quantity @xmath29 satisfying the transport equation @xmath30 since @xmath31 depends on @xmath3 we get @xmath32 to be compared with the hooke law .",
    "we get @xmath33 which is easily solved and gives @xmath34 for the choice @xmath35 the wave velocity can be written as a function of the strain density @xmath31 as @xmath36 we check now the conservation of the momentum @xmath37 we get @xmath38 where @xmath39 we introduce a pressure term , standing as a strain pressure , @xmath40 and we get the conservative equation for the momentum @xmath41 the system made of  ( [ tsunami9 ] )  ( [ tsunami8 ] ) has the form of the well known euler equations for gas dynamics with a larger adiabatic coefficient @xmath42 instead of the usual value @xmath1 for gases , and can be handled in the same way , especially for the shock waves .",
    "the same rankine hugoniot condition is valid , connecting the velocity of a shock wave to the two states @xmath43 and @xmath44 by @xmath45",
    "we first compute the state at rest . in case of stillness the equations  ( [ tsunami9 ] ) and  ( [ tsunami8 ] ) reduce to @xmath46 since @xmath47 by denoting @xmath48 the strain density at rest",
    ", the integration gives @xmath49 recalling that @xmath50 we can use the atmospheric pressue @xmath51 at the surface ( @xmath17 ) and get @xmath52 which corresponds to the geostrophic equilibrium state .",
    "1.8emto compute the strain density profile we use the deviation variable @xmath53 and look for linkage of the form @xmath54 as in any @xmath55system with a source term ( see [ 4 ] , or annex below in section 5 ) , where @xmath56 and @xmath57 are constant .",

    "1.8emthe value of @xmath56 is determined by the strength of the sismic wave at the bottom of the ocean , whose depth is denoted @xmath77 this corresponds to a reference state @xmath78 we have @xmath79 we get @xmath80 whichs gives @xmath81     1.8emnow we can compute the profile of the stain wave as the solution of  ( [ tsunami5 ] ) .",
    "figure 1 presents a series of numerical computation tests using the reference value @xmath82 , for a depth @xmath83 meters , that is an increasing of about 1500% above the natural pressure on the bottom of the ocean .",
    "2.1emthe velocity field @xmath84 increases from a few meters per second near the bottom to more than 300 meters per second near the front shock wave drawn here , which is here an hypothetic one .",
    "the tests performed with too small friction coefficients ( observed here for @xmath85 ) yield decreasing profiles , as expected from the remark above about the size of the friction term .",
    "the real front shock wave will progress more slowly than the strain wave , and its amplitude will decrease rapidly , and the effective values of the velocity field @xmath84 will be strongly reduced near the front schock wave .     1.8emthe front shock wave connects the geostrophic equilibrium state @xmath60 , with the velocity @xmath86 , to a value @xmath31 on the strain wave , with the velocity @xmath87 the rankine hugoniot condition  ( [ tsunami4 ] ) gives the velocity of this shock wave , which reads here : @xmath88 we have the following result :     the shock wave propagates slower than the stain wave , and faster than the local wave speed @xmath89 , that is @xmath90     * proof : * we fix @xmath15 and set @xmath91 and @xmath92 , as the left and right values of the shock wave",
    ". then the shock velocity reads @xmath93 we shall use some @xmath94q_{0},q_{s}[$ ] such that @xmath95 we have @xmath96 where @xmath97 we get @xmath98 which reduces to @xmath99 and is equivalent to @xmath100 which is true since @xmath101 and @xmath102     1.8emon the other hand , since the expression @xmath103 is an increasing function of @xmath104 for @xmath105 , we get obviously the other inequality.(end of proof )        1.8emnow we can construct the whole wave , made of a regular part corresponding to a part of the strain wave and a front shock whose position is determined by the rankine hugoniot condition  ( [ tsunami6 ] ) intertpreted as a differential equation whose solution @xmath106 gives the position of the shock .",
    "figure 2 shows the different positions of the shock wave for different values of the friction coefficient .",
    "1.8emthe velocity @xmath56 is equal to @xmath107 that is @xmath108 .",
    "the shock on the bottom of the ocean , at the depth @xmath109 corresponds to 15 times the value of the usual geostrophic pressure , thai is @xmath110 this corresponds to strain densities @xmath111 we notice that the variation from @xmath112 to @xmath113 corresponds to an increasing of 11.5 % which is an increasing of about 1400 % of the pressure .",
    "the velocity of the wave is computed from the values @xmath114 we notice that the velocities @xmath115 and @xmath116are for more important than @xmath6 .",
    "the real profiles are drawn in red , and are shaped as a part of the strain wave profile cut by the slower shock wave .",
    "the eliminated parts are drawn in blue .",
    "we observe an important difference between the velocites of the different fronts , for several values of the friction coefficient .",
    "we denote by @xmath117 the mean depth of the ocean .",
    "the wavelength @xmath118 of the saint - venant waves must satisfy a condition of the form @xmath119 where @xmath120 the number of sonic interactions ( back - and - forth ) between the bottom and the surface of the ocean .",
    "this condition means that along a horizontal distance of a wavelength @xmath118 , there are at least @xmath120 such sonic interactions .",
    "the use of the saint - venant model is as more appropriate as @xmath120 is great . as in [ 2 ] for rogue waves ,",
    "we propose to require @xmath121 which implies for example a wavelength greater than @xmath122 for an ocean depth of @xmath123 .",
    "a tsunami wave is expected when the condition  ( [ tsunami7 ] ) is fullfilled . a linear model for the surface elevation propagation",
    "was proposed in the historical paper [ 1 ] by k.kajiura .",
    "1.8emthe numerical tests in section 3 show the effect of the friction , whose effect is to shape up the amplitude of the wave near the front shock . at the same time , this front shock magnitude is eroded progressively as the wave propagates upwards to the surface . since the amplitude of the front shock decreases , the velocity of this front shock decreases too .",
    "by following the propagation of a wave with an incidence of angle @xmath124 ( that is only changing @xmath26 into @xmath125 and @xmath16 into @xmath126 ) , we get a longer path to travel with a weaker gravity constant ) and a delayed wave compare to the case withou incidence .",
    "this is show on figure 3 .",
    "1.8emthe value of the initial amplitude has a capital effect .",
    "it must be large enough to get , after erosion by the friction , a remaining wave near the surface which is sufficient to raise up the sea surface and provoke a wave .",
    "the physical wave starts as a sperical wave , and propagates according to the incidences .",
    "the part with a small incidence will reach the surface later and will help the formation of the water wave .",
    "the part with a larger incidence will disappear because of the friction effect .",
    "the question of the value of the friction coefficient stays open , since the use of the strain density was never done before .",
    "it seems from the numerical tests that the correct values lay between 1 and 10 .",
    "too large values provoke a sharp front wave which erodes rapidly and will never reach the surface with a sufficient amplitude to make a wave , which is not expected , since sometimes , tsunamis really occur .",
    "we consider a general 2x2 hyperbolic system whose first equation has the form @xmath127 we denote by @xmath128 and @xmath129 the eigenvalues of the flux matrix , which depend on @xmath31 and @xmath130 only .",
    "then the general form of the second equation is @xmath131 or @xmath132 by using the notations @xmath133 and @xmath134 is a source term , assumed to be not identically zero .",
    "we have the following result :     the nonlinear non homogeneous system  ( [ tsunami21 ] ) ,  ( [ tsunami22 ] ) admits non constant local solutions which are also solutions to the linear homogeneous system @xmath135 where @xmath56 is a real constant , with the linkage @xmath136 another real constant .",
    "* proof : * we look for local solution with a linkage of the form @xmath137 . then the system becomes @xmath138 since @xmath139and @xmath140 , the second equation becomes @xmath141 which has the form @xmath142 by introducing a real function @xmath143 whose derivative is@xmath144 now , integrating with respect to @xmath145gives @xmath146 where @xmath147is an integrating constant which may depend on @xmath15 . next , derivating with respect to @xmath15 gives @xmath148 where we set @xmath149hence we get @xmath150 and recalling that @xmath151it remains @xmath152 a new derivation with respect to @xmath153 leads to @xmath154 and since the solution is not constant , we get @xmath155that is @xmath156with some constants @xmath56 and @xmath157 next , @xmath158 and we have got @xmath159 for some constant @xmath160 or , locally , @xmath161 , which satisfies to  ( [ tsunami23 ] ) , since @xmath162.(end of proof )        1.5emthis result is a very general one , since no special hypotheses were needed on the second equation  ( [ tsunami22 ] ) .",
    "such waves are very common in the nature : water waves such as roll waves , rogue waves , tidal bore waves or also many other waves as reported in [ 2 ] or [ 4 ] .",
    "for example the double property of being either a solution to a non linear , non homogeneous systems and a linear homogeneous system provides the linkage between acoustics and gas dynamics in a wind instrument ( see [ 3 ] ) .",
    "1.8emin the case of a conservative system , invariant by galilean transform , the only choice of the function @xmath163 is reduced to @xmath164 we easily construct this way the usual saint venant system in hydraulics or the euler equations in gas dynamics .",
    "1.8emin section 3 , the state at rest is not @xmath165 , but @xmath166 so we look for a solution with the linkage @xmath167 since @xmath168 at rest .",
    "we find a differentiel equation which is more complex than  ( [ tsunami24 ] ) .",
    "we have used the idea of source term linearization effects on waves as in [ 2],[3 ] and [ 4 ] .",
