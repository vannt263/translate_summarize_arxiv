    "violations of bell inequalities , which reject all lhv theories and attest for the validity of quantum mechanics , have been demonstrated in numerous experiments with massless photons @xcite , but in only a handful of experiments involving massive particles @xcite . in addition , all massive particle experiments have so far been restricted to exploiting entanglement between internal ( spin ) degrees of freedom , but never between external ( motional ) degrees of freedom such as translational momentum . here ,",
    "we propose and simulate a matter - wave experiment which , for the first time , can demonstrate a bell inequality violation for pairs of momentum - entangled ultracold atoms produced in a collision @xcite of two bose - einstein condensates ( becs ) . in such a motional - state bell inequality test ,",
    "particle masses become directly relevant , thus enabling extensions of fundamental tests of quantum mechanics into regimes which may involve couplings to gravitational fields and hence find connections to theories of gravitational decoherence @xcite .",
    "this is important in view of future possible tests of quantum mechanics or its modifications ( which currently go beyond established theories ) in an attempt to resolve the current incompatibility of quantum mechanics and the theory of gravity .",
    "the original bell inequality was formulated by john bell @xcite in response to einstein , podolsky , and rosen s ( epr ) argument @xcite that , under the premises of local realism , quantum mechanics appears to be incomplete and hence must be supplemented by hidden variables in order to explain the ` spooky - action - at - a - distance ' due to entanglement between space - like separated particles .",
    "the first conclusive experimental demonstrations of bell inequality violations with photons were reported in the early 1980s through to 1990s @xcite and used sources of pair - correlated photons , such as from a radiative cascade or parametric down - conversion .",
    "it took almost another two decades before the first massive - particle bell violations emerged , utilizing pairs of trapped ions @xcite or proton pairs from the radiative decay of metastable @xmath3he @xcite .",
    "these experiments all relied on entanglement between the internal degrees of freedom  either the photon polarizations or the particle spins , with the notable exception of the rarity - tapster experiment @xcite which explored entanglement between photons momenta ( see also @xcite ) .    in recent years",
    ", there has been an increasing number of experiments , particularly in the field of ultracold atoms @xcite and opto - mechanics @xcite , generating and quantifying various forms of massive - particle entanglement @xcite . however , these should be distinguished from experiments designed to rule out lhv theories via a bell inequality violation  the most stringent test of quantum mechanics .",

    "indeed , the rarity - tapster interferometric scheme can be mapped to a spin-@xmath34 or polarization - entangled system @xcite , wherein choosing the phases @xmath11 and @xmath12 directly controls the polarization basis in which each measurement is made .",

    "however , in general , when using spontaneous parametric down - conversion as a suitable source of pair correlated particles , one must keep in mind the contribution from the higher - order fock states ( whose relative weight is very small for @xmath58 , implying that the contribution of events that produce , e.g. , two or more photons in each of the correlated modes is extremely unlikely ) , leading to a breakdown of the mapping of the full state eq .

    "our numerical simulations take into account a range of physically important processes beyond the common analysis of oversimplified toy models .",
    "importantly this includes : ( i ) the multimode nature of the colliding bose - einstein condensates and subsequent scattering halo ; ( ii ) the spatial expansion and separation of the source condensates during the collision and hence during the pair production process ( for comparison , the ` pump mode ' in the optical down - conversion case remains practically unchanged in the required weak - gain regime ) ; and ( iii ) the fact that the atomic ` mirror ' and ` beam - splitter ' bragg pulses act , in fact , as momentum kicks ( translations ) rather than as actual ( optical ) reflections . by modeling the real - time application of the bragg pulses , without assuming ideal @xmath9 and @xmath10 pulses ( 100% and 50% transfer , respectively ) , we implicitly allow for small amounts of losses ( hence decoherence ) into higher - order bragg scattering modes .",
    "we also take into account the nontrivial effects of phase dispersion , absent in photonic experiments , by optimizing the timing and application of the bragg pulses in the interferometer .",
