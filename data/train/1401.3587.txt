    "networks , a set of nodes or vertices joined pairwise by links or edges , are commonly used for describing sociological ( scientific collaborations @xcite and acquaintance networks @xcite ) , biological ( proteins interactions , genes regulatory , food webs , neural networks , metabolic networks ) , technological ( internet and the web ) and communication ( airport @xcite , road @xcite , and railway network @xcite ) systems .",
    "the topological properties of these complex networks @xcite help in identifying underlying community structures @xcite , network motifs @xcite , connectivity @xcite and several other properties @xcite .",
    "the links of a network can also be weighted .",
    "some of the networks are associated with links of varying strengths @xcite represented by link weights .",
    "the topological properties of weighted networks @xcite are quite different and their study requires additional care .",
    "in particular when link weights vary in a wide range , one need to identify suitably the irrelevant links and ignore them to simplify the network @xcite .",
    "most networks in nature , whether weighted or not , exhibit community ( or modular ) structures .",
    "detection of communities in the complex networks provide invaluable information on the underlying synergism .",
    "nodes which belong to a particular module are more than likely to function together for some common cause ; being able to unravel such communities help in identifying functional properties of the network .",
    "for example in social networks @xcite , communities observed are based on interests , age , profession of the people .",
    "similarly , communities reflects the themes of the web - pages in world wide web , related papers on a single topic in citation networks @xcite , subsystems within ecosystems @xcite in food webs , and it may relate to functional groups @xcite in cellular and metabolic networks .    to identify the modular structures of complex networks , several algorithms @xcite are developed recently .",
    "but most of these methods are context based and a unique algorithm which could work universally is still out of reach .",
    "recently newman and girvan has proposed a couple of methods @xcite to detect the modules but they take high computational time for large networks . later , a faster algorithm @xcite is being put forward by the same authors , based on maximization of modularity @xmath2 defined as the number of edges present within the groups minus the expected number in an equivalent random network . according to this algorithm , best partition of a network is the one which has maximum modularity @xmath3 this modularization method @xcite is further generalized to include weighted networks @xcite .",
    "newman girvan s modularization algorithms ( ngm ) , though widely used for finding modules of both weighted and unweighted networks , has some shortcomings @xcite .",
    "it was argued that modularity maximization algorithm can resolve the network upto a scale that depends on the total number of links @xmath4 a module having more than @xmath5 links can not be resolved even when it is a clique and connected to external modules through just one link .",
    "moreover the situation gets worse when substantial number of small communities coexist with large ones .",
    "this observation is also true for weighted networks @xcite .",
    "therefore modularity maximization uncovers only large modules missing important substructures which are small . in this context",
    ", an clustering method has been proposed recently by mookherjee _ et .",
    "@xcite in context of microrna co - target network of human which is densely connected by weighted links .",
    "the authors claimed to obtain microrna clusters which reveal biologically significant processes and pathways .",
    "this algorithm also suffers from certain short comings .",
    "first , the method has in - built arbitrariness in determining the total number of clusters and then its sub - structures connected by large - weighted links , if any , remains undetectable .",
    "details of the algorithm and its shortcomings are discussed in the next section .    in this article",
    "we propose a new algorithm in an effort to overcome these shortcomings and to efficiently determine the communities of any dense weighted network .",
    "we demonstrate the algorithm using the microrna co - target network of _ homo sapiens _ and compare the modules with those obtained by ngm algorithm for weighted networks @xcite and the clustering algorithm @xcite .",
    "in a recent article @xcite , mookherjee _ et .",
    "al . _ have proposed an algorithm to find clusters of mirna co - target network of _ homo sapiens_. micrornas are short non - coding rnas which usually suppress gene expression in post - transcriptional level @xcite . taking the predicted targets of @xmath6 mirnas of _ homo sapiens _ from microcosm",
    "target database @xcite , the authors constructed the co - target network by joining mirnas pairwise by weighted links .",
    "the link weight @xmath7 corresponds to the number of common targets of the concerned pair .",
    "the network thus constructed consists of @xmath6 mirnas ( nodes ) and @xmath8 edges . since the network is fully connected ,",
    "it is evident that clusters containing less than half the number of nodes can not be resolved by standard algorithms @xcite . to obtain the clusters of this densely packed network mookherjee _ et .",
    "_ in @xcite have adopted the following strategy .",
    "the link weights of this network vary in a wide range : minimum being @xmath9 and maximum @xmath10 thus most links are considered irrelevant in determining the clusters . in an attempt to simplify the network , links with weights smaller than a pre - defined cutoff value @xmath11",
    "are erased ; the resulting network breaks into small disjoint components . denoting , @xmath12 as the number components",
    "the authors find that @xmath12 does not increase substantially until @xmath11 reaches a threshold value @xmath13 and then it breaks quickly into large number of components ( fig .",
    "2c in @xcite ) . thus the network is optimally connected at @xmath14 where @xmath15 is maximum . among all the components obtained at @xmath16",
    "the largest one @xmath17 contains @xmath18 mirnas .",
    "a large fraction of mirnas present in @xmath17 are found to down regulate expression of genes involved in several genetic diseases . to explore how mirnas are organized in @xmath19 @xmath11",
    "is increased further until the total number of components does not change much . at @xmath20",
    "the subgraph @xmath17 has @xmath21 components ( called mirna clusters ) and @xmath22 lone mirnas .",
    "note that if we consider all @xmath6 mirnas , instead of @xmath18 mirnas belonging to @xmath19 the total number of clusters would have been @xmath23 ( see table [ table : compare ] for details ) .",
    "further , the authors have analyzed these @xmath21 clusters and claimed that they are biologically relevant -either pathway or tissue or disease specific .",
    "note that , even though the targets are predicted based on sequence similarities , the microrna clusters reveals functionality quite well ; only about @xmath24 clusters are found to contain mirnas of identical seed sequence .",
    "thus it is suggestive that a group of mirna , instead of individual ones , are involved in carrying out necessary functions .",
    "_ limitations : _ although the cluster finding algorithm discussed in @xcite partitions the mirna co - target network into several components which provide significant information about the functions of mirna clusters , it suffers from certain limitations .",
    "firstly , there exists few clusters containing a large number ( as large as @xmath25 ) of mirnas ; such large clusters produce significant noise in identifying pathways and functions from enhancement analysis .",
    "secondly , if a mirna cluster has two or more sub - structures which are connected by a few links having weights much larger than @xmath26 it is beyond the scope of this algorithm to resolve them .",
    "for example the network in fig .",
    "[ fig : limitation ] clearly has two modules but weight of the few links that joins the two modules are larger than @xmath27 since the algorithm looks for disconnected components of the graph , it is not possible to uncover these two obvious modules ( a and b ) .",
    "lastly to reveal the sub - structures of a giant cluster @xmath19 @xmath11 is increase to an arbitrary value ( taken as @xmath28 in @xcite ) . in practice",
    "the actual number of clusters depends weakly on this choice , however it still introduces an arbitrariness in the algorithm .",
    "all these shortcomings necessitates exploring other appropriate algorithms for finding the community structure in dense weighted network .",
    "in this section we proposed an algorithm for finding modules of dense weighted networks .",
    "the algorithm primarily consists of two steps -first , finding the major communities and second , extracting their sub - structures .",
    "_ step i _ : for finding the modular structures , we consider a weighted network which is densely connected .",
    "let the network has @xmath2 nodes denoted by @xmath29 and a connected pair of nodes @xmath30 and @xmath31 has non zero weight @xmath32 thus , the network is represented by an adjacency matrix @xmath33 with elements @xmath34 we also assume that the network is densely connected .",
    "a preliminary simplification can be done following ref .",
    "@xcite , where links with weights smaller than a pre - decided cutoff @xmath11 are erased .",
    "the resulting network thus breaks up into smaller disconnected components -say @xmath12 in total .",
    "it is evident that @xmath12 is the number of diagonal blocks of a matrix @xmath35 with elements @xmath36 clearly @xmath37 must strictly be a non - decreasing function with @xmath38    we proceed further to calculate the modularity of the concerned weighted network for different values of @xmath0 in general , if a network ( weighted ) has @xmath39 partitions , one can calculate the modularity @xcite from knowing the set of nodes which belong to each partition , @xmath40 where @xmath41 represents sum of the weights of the edges attached to node @xmath30 and @xmath42 the term @xmath43 is @xmath9 only if vertices @xmath30 and @xmath31 belong to same group . for a given @xmath44",
    "we take the components as the modules ( thus @xmath45 ) and denote corresponding modularity as @xmath46 note that , unlike @xmath47 the modularity @xmath48 need not be a increasing function . a schematic plot of these functions are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : flowchart ] .",
    "since , large modularity is a feature of better community structure we choose the value @xmath49 where @xmath48 takes the maximum value and then collect set of components obtained there for further analysis .",
    "_ step ii _ : the number of mirnas present in each of the components , @xmath50 the component sizes obtained at @xmath51 are quite large . to get finner division of these components",
    "we can increase the @xmath11 value further , then although we will get smaller sized groups but the value of @xmath48 will decrease , which is not favorable . so keeping the value of @xmath11 fixed at @xmath49 where @xmath48 is maximum , we find the further groups present in these individual components by using ngm algorithm for weighted networks @xcite . taking the components one by one",
    "we then find their modules with help of ngm algorithm for weighted network @xcite , and accept the partition if the modularity value for this partition is positive or other wise we ignore it .",
    "likewise we consider each of the components formed at @xmath49 for further partitioning .",
    "collection of all the partitioned components of the network are then considered as the final modules of the weighted network .",
    "we demonstrate this algorithm for mirna co - target network of human , a dense and weighted network constructed and studied by mookherjee @xmath52 @xcite . micrornas ( mirnas )",
    "are small single stranded @xmath53nt long non - coding rnas @xcite that repress gene expression by binding @xmath54-untranslated regions ( @xmath54 utr ) of messenger rna ( mrna ) target transcripts , causing translational repression @xcite . being a secondary regulator ,",
    "mirnas usually repress the gene expression marginally .",
    "thus it is natural to expect that cooperative action of mirnas are needed for alteration of any biological function or pathway .",
    "microrna synergism has been a recent focus in biology for studying their regulatory effects in cell .",
    "recent articles @xcite have identified the assemblage of the mirnas for performing various activities . in this view finding the small clusters or communities of the mirnas that work together for regulatory functions",
    "is quite relevant . for completeness",
    ", first we describe the construction of mirna co - target network briefly and then proceed for obtaining its modules using the algorithm discussed here .",
    "mirnas and their targets transcripts .",
    "( b ) the adjacency matrix ( @xmath33 ) with elements @xmath55 corresponding to the number of common target transcripts .",
    "( c ) the mirna co - target network , where the mirnas are represented as nodes which are connected by links having weight @xmath32,width=491 ]      the mirnas which act as secondary regulators can target more than one mrna transcripts and a transcript can also be targeted by many mirnas .",
    "computationally predicted targets of mirnas for different species are available in microcosm target database @xcite . for constructing the mirna network the targets of mirnas",
    "are collected from the above mentioned database .",
    "the data predicts @xmath56 targets for @xmath6 mirnas for _ homo sapiens_.    the mirna co - target network is constructed by considering mirnas as nodes , and a link with weight @xmath7 is connected between two mirnas if they both target @xmath7 number of same target transcripts . the detailed procedure for constructing the mirna co - target network is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : dataset ] .",
    "the network thus formed is weighted and undirected . for convenience ,",
    "mirnas are given arbitrary , but unique , identification numbers @xmath57 where @xmath2 represents the total number of mirnas present in the species .",
    "the mirna network is represented as adjacency matrix @xmath58 where a element @xmath55 represents the number of mrnas co - targeted by mirna @xmath30 and @xmath31 together .",
    "thus @xmath55 represents the weight of the link joining the nodes @xmath30 and @xmath59 if a mirna pair @xmath30 and @xmath31 have no common targets , they are not connected and we set @xmath60 the diagonal elements of matrix @xmath33 are taken to be zero @xmath50 @xmath61 the link - weights of the mirna co - target network can not be ignored while finding the communities present in the network ; the community structure depends on both weights and the connectivity of the mirnas .",
    "we obtain the components of mirna co - target network by progressively deleting the links which have weight less than @xmath0 for each @xmath44 taking the components as the communities of the graph , we calculate modularity @xmath46 figure [ fig : hsa_mod ] shows @xmath12 and @xmath48 as a function of @xmath0 as expected @xmath12 is non - decreasing function whereas @xmath48 shows a maximum at @xmath62 here , the maximum modularity is @xmath63 and there are @xmath64 components , of which @xmath65 are isolated mirnas and the rest @xmath66 have two or more mirnas each ( for details refer to table .

    "are just combination of the modules ( denoted as @xmath2 ) obtained here . the number written as subscript of @xmath70 and @xmath2 represents the i d number of the clusters and modules.,width=472 ]",
    "in this article we propose an algorithm to detect community structure of dense weighted networks .",
    "if the network has adjacency matrix @xmath33 whose elements @xmath55 refer to the weight of the link connecting nodes @xmath30 and @xmath31 , one can implement the algorithm by the following steps , * i. * delete all the links having weight @xmath71 ; find the modularity @xmath48 of the network taking the disjoint components obtained here as the partitions .",
    "* ii . * find @xmath49 where @xmath48 is maximum .",
    "take all the components at @xmath72 containing two or more mirnas , one at a time , apply newman girvan s weighted algorithm to obtain its modules . to demonstrate the algorithm",
    ", we consider mirna co - target network of _ homo sapiens _",
    ", which is dense and weighted , and compare the modules with the mirna clusters obtained earlier @xcite .",
    "it turns out that most clusters are either identical to one of the modules , or composed of mirnas belonging to at most four different modules .",
    "thus , like the clusters , modules are also involved in specific biological functions .",
    "this algorithm has certain advantage over some of the standard ones .",
    "the ngm algorithm for weighted networks @xcite can not resolve small sub - structures if the network is dense .",

    "it has been known that a network containing @xmath74 connections can not resolve any module which has @xmath5 links .",
    "usually , a densely connected weighted network , with a wide distribution of link weights falls in this category and it is difficult to resolve small substructures of these networks .",
