    "broad band photometry from wide - field imagers mounted on dedicated telescopes and instruments has been and will continue to be our main source of information for a large fraction of the extragalactic universe .",
    "spectroscopy provides a more detailed and deeper understanding of the physical properties of individual objects than photometry .",
    "however , spectroscopy will never be able to fully sample the populations of galactic or extragalactic objects in either number or depth .",
    "it is therefore of great interest to determine whether it is possible to extract estimates of physical parameters , such as distance , metallicity , star formation rate , morphology and the presence or absence of an active nucleus , from the coarse information provided by photometry .    for a given object , photometric quantities , such as magnitudes in different bands , momenta of the light distribution and morphological indexes , define its position in a high dimensional parameter space which we shall call the observed parameter space ( or ops , cf .",
    "@xcite ) . the de - projection of the ops into the physical parameter space ( pps , i.e. the parameter space defined by the physical quantities ) , is however a complex operation , made in some cases almost impossible by the degeneracy existing in both the data and the physical parameters themselves .",
    "most of the time , such de - projections require an intermediate passage , i.e. the de - projection of the ops onto the spectroscopic parameter space ( or sps ) , i.e. the space defined by observable spectroscopic quantities such as redshift , equivalent widths of specific spectral lines and spectroscopic indexes .",
    "the parameters defining the sps are in fact more directly related to the intrinsic physical properties of the objects .",
    "spectroscopy , for instance , is more effective than photometry in disentangling normal galaxies from those hosting an agn , or in classifying different types of agn in broad classes ( e.g. , seyfert , liners , etc . ) . actually , the definition of nearly all agn classes is based on spectroscopic criteria through the equivalent widths of some lines ( see for instance @xcite ) .",
    "the problem of mapping the ops onto some subspaces of the sps and then on the pps , is frequently encountered in the literature .",
    "examples include the determination of photometric redshifts , which is an attempt to reproduce what is decidedly a spectroscopic quantity ( the redshift ) using photometry alone ; the search for candidate quasars and blazars using photometric diagnostics ; or the search for candidate agn and starburst galaxies .",
    "usually these mapping functions are quite complex and difficult ( if not plainly impossible ) to be derived in simple analytical forms and require statistical or empirical approaches which are common in the field of machine learning ( hereinafter ml ) .",
    "in fact , if higher accuracy information is available for a subset of objects ( in the case discussed here , spectroscopic parameters or flags in the sps ) , it can be used to teach a ml method how to map the available data ( the photometric data in the ops ) into the higher accuracy ones . in the ml field",
    "this approach is usually called supervised learning .",
    "we emphasize that , while supervised learning is very powerful in uncovering the hidden relationship between input parameters and the so - called knowledge base ( hereafter kb ) , there are two main limitations :    * the mapping function can not be extrapolated outside of the region of the ops that is properly sampled by the sps ; * any bias present in the kb is necessarily reproduced ( if not amplified ) in the output .    to better exemplify these two points",
    "let us focus on the main topic addressed in this work where we use a specific ml method , the mlpqna @xcite , to tackle a particular incarnation of the so called _ physical classification of galaxies _ problem .",
    "we will specifically address the possibility of disentangling normal , non - active galaxies from those hosting an agn using only photometric measurements .    in a previous paper",
    "we have discussed the use of the same method to classify different types of agn @xcite . in this work",
    "we shall instead focus on the question of whether it is possible to use only optical colors to produce reliable ( or at least statistically well controlled ) agn candidates and to disentangle normal - inactive galaxies from those hosting an agn .    as already pointed out in @xcite , in spite of the unique physical mechanism responsible for the nuclear activity @xcite , the phenomenological complexity of agns is so high that there can not be a unique method equally effective in identifying all agn phenomenologies in every redshift range ( cf .",
    "moreover , agn and starbursts , long studied separately , are now thought to be correlated @xcite and difficult to disentangle without using mid - ir data .",
    "furthermore , we also investigate the possibility of identifying a catalogue of candidate qsos , by comparing the efficiency of classification in terms of a compromise between purity and completeness following two different strategies : i ) by exploiting a self - consistent strategy starting from three different classes of objects ( for instance galaxies , stars and qsos ) ; ii ) by assuming a pre - determined separation between resolved and un - resolved objects ( star / galaxy ) , we performed the usual two - class classification between stars and qsos .",
    "the paper is structured as follows . in section  [ sec : thedata ] we discuss in same detail the data . in section",
    "[ sec : themethod ] we summarize the general methodology adopted and provide a short description of the ml method used . in section  [ sec :",
    "experiments ] we describe in some detail the various classification experiments performed and , finally , in section  [ sec : conclusions ] we discuss the results .",
    "among the countless merits of the sloan digital sky survey @xcite , there is also the fact that it has paved the way to the experimenting and wide adoption within the astronomical community of innovative methods based on ml ( or on statistical pattern recognition ) , thus fostering the birth of the emerging field of astroinformatics @xcite .",
    "the sdss in fact provides an ideal test ground for ml algorithms and methods : a large and complex photometric database with hundreds of features measured for hundreds of millions of objects ( defining the sdss subregion of the ops ) , complemented by spectroscopic information for a significant subsample ( roughly @xmath3 ) of objects ( i.e. the sps ) .",
    "furthermore , it offered to different groups , working with different methodologies , the possibility to address significant problems , thus allowing a robust and fair assessment of the performance of any new method .    even constraining ourselves to the specific interest of the present work",
    ", it would be difficult to summarize the applications of ml methods to sdss data and we shall just mention two .",
    "the search for candidate quasars has been widely discussed in @xcite . while the characterization of agn has been discussed in @xcite .",
    "last but not least , ml methods have been crucial for the first successful astronomical citizen science project : the galaxy zoo @xcite , where empirical methods were used to compare and evaluate the performance of a large number of human simple , repetitive , and independent classification tasks .    in this paper",
    "we use photometric and spectroscopic data extracted from the sdss data release 10 ( dr10 ; @xcite ) .",
    "the dr10 photometry covers @xmath4 @xmath5 of the celestial sphere for a total of more than @xmath6 millions unique ( i.e. without duplicates , overlaps and repeated measurements ) objects , but not necessarily unique _",
    "astrophysical _ objects .",
    "dr10 also includes spectroscopic information for more than @xmath7 million objects .",
    "these data come from a wide range of concurrent experiments : the @xmath8 initial sdss data releases , the sloan extension for galactic understanding and exploration ( segue-2 , @xcite ) , the apache point observatory galaxy evolution experiment ( apogee ; @xcite ) mainly targeted to milky way stars ; the barion oscillation spectroscopic survey ( boss ; @xcite ) and , finally , the multi object apo radial velocity exoplanet large - area survey ( marvels ; @xcite ) .    in order to build our kb we used the spectroscopic classification flags provided by the sdss dr10 .",
    "it includes also a spectroscopic classification ( parameters @xmath9 and @xmath10 ) obtained by the sdss team through the comparison of individual spectra with templates and from equivalent width ratios .",
    "this classification is articulated in three main classes : @xmath11 , @xmath12 and @xmath13 as follows : + * _ galaxy_*. objects having a galaxy template .",
    "its subclasses are :    * starforming : based on whether the galaxy has detectable emission lines that are consistent with star - formation according to the criteria : @xmath14 * starburst : set if the galaxy is star - forming but has an equivalent width of @xmath15 greater than @xmath16  ; * agn : based on whether the galaxy has detectable emission lines that are consistent with being a seyfert or liner according to the relation : @xmath17    * _ qso_*. objects identified with a qso template . based on the sdss definition ,",
    "if a galaxy or quasar has spectral lines detected at the @xmath18 sigma level with @xmath19 at the @xmath20 sigma level , the indication _ broadline _ is appended to their subclass . + * _ star_*. objects matching a stellar template ( among @xmath21 spectral subclasses ) .",
    "since we were not interested in these subclasses , they will be ignored in what follows .",
    "+ the total number of spectroscopic objects is @xmath22 divided in different types as summarized in table [ tab : kbdetails ] .",
    "we assumed all galaxies not flagged otherwise to be normal , i.e. neither agn or starburst .",
    "it is worth noting that sharp cuts based on crisp thresholds introduce ambiguities in the mapping of the sps onto the pps . to be more clear : a large fraction of the objects with spectroscopic features near the threshold values",
    "may be misclassified ( i.e a galaxy hosting an agn may be erroneously put in the normal galaxy bins due spectroscopic errors and viceversa ) .",
    "these ambiguities are intrinsic to the kb and will affect the projection of the ops onto the sps and therefore the pps",
    ".    for all spectroscopic objects we downloaded the sets of magnitudes listed in the upper part of table [ tab : features ] .",
    "the choice of using different sets of magnitudes was dictated by the fact that , since we were interested also in finding agn candidates , different apertures can be used to weight in different ways the contribution of the central unresolved source and of the extended surrounding galaxy .    [ cols=\"<,<,>,>\",options=\"header \" , ]     the results of the @xmath23 experiments are reported in table  [ tab : threeclass ] . by looking at the qso statistics",
    ", the purity / completeness results of @xmath24 experiment appeared very similar to those obtained in the @xmath25 experiment .",
    "although these two experiments led to comparable results , we consider the @xmath24 as the best , because obtained without any cut in the parameters . for a complete discussion",
    "[ sec : conclusions_1 ] .",
    "the classification experiments described in the previous sections aimed at producing a reliable catalogue of candidate qsos / agns by exploiting the photometric information available within the dr10 . in what follows we give a detailed overview of their results .",
    "the set of experiments described in sec .",
    "[ sec : normalgal ] aimed at investigating whether optical photometry could be used to isolate different types of galaxies as defined by the spectroscopic subclasses in the sdss dr10 spectroscopic archive . with reference to table  [ tab : kbdetails ] it is apparent that different types of objects are represented in the kb in a very uneven way . in the first couple of experiments ( _ all _ and _ cuts _ ) we tried to separate normal galaxies from those having a _ peculiar _ spectrum ( i.e. all the other subclasses in the sdss classification scheme ) .",
    "the performance of the method , shown in table  [ tab : goresults ] , were not affected by the application of color and magnitude cuts and the efficiency remained stationary around a value of @xmath26 . given the lack of improvements between the _ all _ and _ cuts _ experiments , we decided to perform supplementary experiments by freezing the _ all _ kb , the same configuration for the network and the input parameters .",
    "the statistics of misclassified objects , reported in tables [ tab : misall ] and [ tab : miscuts ] , show that the mlpqna is quite effective in disentangling starburst and starforming galaxies both narrow and broadline ( misclassification rates of @xmath27 and @xmath28 , respectively ) , and much less effective in identifying other types of objects such as , for instance , agn ( misclassification rate @xmath29 ) and agn broadline objects ( @xmath30 ) .",
    "the performance on the starburst broadline and starforming broadline types , however , are difficult to evaluate , since these two groups are very poorly represented in the kb and therefore the network may have failed in capture their specific signatures in the ops .",
    "the fact that @xmath29 of the agn , @xmath31 of the broadline and @xmath32 of the agn broadline were misclassified induced us to check whether different groupings of the subclasses could lead to improvements in the classification efficiency .    in the _",
    "nbonly _ experiment ( table  [ tab : nbonly ] ) the misclassification rate improved to @xmath33 for the normal galaxies and dropped to @xmath33 ( from @xmath31 ) for the broadline .",
    "the misclassification rates for agn broadline , starburst broadline and starforming broadline increased , confirming the fact that the network is not capable to disentangle these spectroscopic subclasses in an effective way . in the _ nball _ experiment ( table  [ tab : nball ] )",
    "the results did not change in a significant way .",
    "in fact , the normal , starburst and starforming type objects still maintain a misclassification rate of , respectively , @xmath33 , @xmath27 and @xmath28 .",
    "while for the broadline galaxies the misclassification decreases to @xmath28 .",
    "a slightly better result is obtained for the agn broadline type , going from @xmath32 in _ all _ and @xmath31 in _ nbonly _ , to @xmath34 .",
    "the agn and starforming broadline types are even worse reaching a misclassification of , respectively @xmath35 and @xmath36 . finally , the starburst broadline , although sparsely represented in the data set , resulted almost completely misclassified ( @xmath37 ) .",
    "the last experiment ( _ nba _ ) , resulted as the best one in terms of overall efficiency as well as for classes normal , broadline , agn broadline and starburst broadline , where the misclassification rates decreased to , respectively , @xmath38 , @xmath39 , @xmath40 and @xmath33 .",
    "only starburst type rate remains unchanged ( @xmath27 ) , while agn objects perform slightly worse ( @xmath41 vs @xmath29 obtained in the _ all _ case ) . on the other hand , the classification of starforming and starforming broadline type decreases to , respectively , @xmath33 and @xmath42 , although the starforming rate decreases by @xmath27 only . the strong decrease for",
    "the starforming broadline type could be due to its poor presence within the data set .",
    "already in the earliest sdss works @xcite optical colors were used to disentangle stars from quasars in the sdss color space .",
    "@xcite used an unsupervised clustering algorithm followed by an agglomeration phase to identify candidate qsos in a parameter space based only on photometric colors .",
    "@xcite used a difference boosting neural network ( dbnn ) on sdss optical colors only , achieving excellent performance ( @xmath43 ) in disentangling qso from normal galaxies in the unresolved source catalogues ( thus including stars , quasars and unresolved galaxies ) .",
    "they however applied a cut in colors by isolating the region of this space where most ( @xmath37 ) of the spectroscopically confirmed quasars lay .",
    "this choice , however , penalizes the recognition of peculiar objects which are likely to lay outside of the main distribution of normal _ well behaved _ objects .",
    "our experiments are described in sec .",
    "[ sec : twoclass ] and related results are shown in table  [ tab : twoclass ] . the immediate conclusion which can be drawn by analyzing the results is that our method is able to achieve @xmath1 of completeness and a purity of @xmath44 without having to apply any color cuts .",
    "in the three - class classification experiment the kb included all objects in the spectroscopic catalogue regardless their extended or unresolved nature .",
    "the first thing to notice is that all experiments reported in table  [ tab : threeclass ] have performance which differ only by very little amount .",
    "the experiment which led to the best results was the @xmath24 with an overall efficiency of @xmath45 .",
    "this experiment was performed using a @xmath46 layers mlpqna and a quite small training set ( only @xmath47 of the available kb ) using as input parameters the @xmath18 sdss magnitudes .",
    "having identified the experiment @xmath24 as the best one , two additional experiments were performed on the @xmath24 parameter space , by changing either the topology of the neural network or the amount of training set to evaluate their individual contribution to the performance . in the first case we used a @xmath48 layer mlpqna and in a second case a larger training set ( @xmath49 of the kb ) .",
    "the case with the increased training set led to a negligible improvement in the overall efficiency but at the price of a huge increase in computing time . while , in the case of a single layer mlpqna network , the performance decreased of about @xmath50 .",
    "this can be understood by taking into account that the complexity introduced by the second hidden layer in the architecture of the neural network is always justified when the kb samples the ops only sparsely . in the case",
    "discussed here , even with a reduced kb , the number of samples in the training set was sufficiently high to ensure a proper coverage of the ops and to minimize the requirements on generalization capabilities .",
    "the additional complexity introduced by the second layer proves indeed very useful in presence of much smaller kbs @xcite .",
    "surprisingly enough , the introduction of mag @xmath51 cuts in the parameter space ( experiment @xmath25 ) did not lead to any significant improvement in the method efficiency .    in summary",
    ", using optical data only , the mlpqna seems quite effective in identifying galaxies ( completeness @xmath52 and contamination @xmath53 ) from qso and stars ( table  [ tab : threeclass ] ) .",
    "we performed the supervised learning classification experiment to produce a catalogue of high fidelity candidate qso selected on photometric data only .",
    "the classification is based on a membership probability criterium : for each object the model output is based on three different membership pseudo - probabilities ( a confidence level for each class ) . therefore the values in table  [ tab : threeclass ] are referred to these confidence levels for all objects of the blind test set ( technique also known as _ winner - takes - all _ ; @xcite ) . with this method ,",
    "in the case of the selected best experiment , we reached a qso class purity of @xmath54 .",
    "afterwards , since our goal was to reach the highest level of purity in the produced catalogue , we performed a further statistical analysis of the test set starting from the results of the experiment @xmath24 , by assessing the variation of purity vs completeness as a function of the increasing confidence threshold used to evaluate the qso candidates from the trained mlpqna model output . at the end we reached a purity of @xmath1 in the blind test set , at the price of a reduced completeness .",
    "the resulting qso photometric catalogue contains @xmath55 candidates and will be made publicly available through the cds vizier facility .",
    "we wish to emphasize that a three - class classification approach offers a significant advantage with respect to the traditional approach based on serialized series of two - class classification steps , since it does not introduce systematic biases due to objects which are misclassified at each step of the sequence . specifically : the separation among star , galaxies and quasars could be achieved via two independent classification steps : first separating resolved ( galaxies ) from unresolved objects ( stars and quasars ) and then dividing the latter group into stars and quasars .",
    "objects misclassified at the first step would be propagated into the next step .    restricting ourselves to the qso vs star classification , in the three - class experiment we achieve an overall accuracy of @xmath56 , with a qso purity of @xmath57 and qso completeness of @xmath58 .",
    "therefore , by comparing this result with those of the two class experiment ( table  [ tab : twoclass ] ) there is a noticeable improvement of accuracy in the three - class experiment .",
    "this confirms the fact that a three - class approach is preferable to the hierarchical chain of two - class experiments .",
    "the slight decrease in qso completeness found in the three - class experiment may be simply due to the higher separation complexity of the experiment .",
    "it needs to be stressed , however , that the catalogue of candidate quasars needs to be used with some cautions .",
    "in fact , no a - priori defined photometric cuts have been applied to the data and our operative definition of a quasar was induced only by the properties of the spectroscopic knowledge base .",
    "hence , any bias , potentially present in the kb , would be reflected in the final definition of the catalogue .",
    "let us , for instance , take into account the bright end of the luminosity distribution .",
    "it is well known that the sdss quasar catalogue is fairly ( @xmath59 ) complete for @xmath60 .",
    "if we consider the produced catalogue , within the flux limit of @xmath61 we find @xmath62 more candidates than those present in the spectroscopic sample .",
    "but , as already discussed in the literature @xcite , this bright end is strongly contaminated by stars , uvx sources and , mainly , by narrow emission - line galaxies . in order to isolate luminous quasars , @xcite used a complex system of photometric cuts :    a ) : :    u - g@xmath63 g - r@xmath64    r - i@xmath65 ; b ) : :    u - g@xmath66 g - i@xmath67 ; c ) : :    u - g@xmath68 g - i@xmath69 ; d ) : :    galprob@xmath70 u - g@xmath71    g - r@xmath72 r - i@xmath73 ; e ) : :    galprob@xmath70 u - g@xmath74 .",
    "these cuts were indeed combined through the logical expression [ @xmath75 , to carve the optimal quasar locus in the observed parameter space .",
    "if we apply the above conditions to both spectroscopic kb and the final catalogue of candidate quasars , under the flux limit of @xmath61 the overabundance of objects in the produced catalogue is reduced of the @xmath76 .    in other words , while ml methods prove very effective in partitioning the ops accordingly to the information contained in the spectroscopic kb , the correct interpretation of their output needs to be fine tuned using the expert s ( i.e. the astronomer s ) knowledge . for this reason , in order to allow interested readers to apply their own filters to the data , the catalogue contains all the relevant photometric information .        in fig .",
    "[ fig : histo1 ] we compare the number of candidate qsos ( solid black line ) in our catalogue vs the number of objects in the kb which are spectroscopically identified as qsos ( solid grey line ) , both before and after ( dashed lines ) the cuts of @xcite . before the cuts ,",
    "the excess of spectroscopically confirmed agns / qsos at bright magnitudes ( @xmath77 ) can be easily explained by the fact that low luminosity agns , which are spectroscopically identified , can easily escape photometric detection since the relative weight of the agn contribution is negligible with respect to the contribution of the central regions of the galaxy .",
    "furthermore , in this magnitude range the sdss sample is highly unbalanced , thus causing the mlpqna model to be less accurate in terms of training performance on the qso class . after applying the @xcite selection criteria , however , the agreement between the two distributions becomes remarkably good and it is maintained down to the completeness limit of the sdss spectroscopic sample ( @xmath78 ) . beyond such limit , the two distributions begin to differ due to both new candidate quasars which were not spectroscopically confirmed in the sdss ( region between the two dashed lines ) and to a contamination from low / medium luminosity agns ( region between the two black lines ) which , as it has been discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec : galvsothe ] , can not be disentangled on the grounds of optical photometry only .",
    "the trends depicted in the diagram of fig .",
    "[ fig : histo1 ] find a statistical confirmation in fig .",
    "[ fig : cdf4 ] , where we show the results of the 1d kolmogorov - smirnov ( k - s ) test @xcite , graphically represented through the cumulative @xmath79 band distribution functions .",
    "the test has been performed to compare the distributions of qso / agn candidate sources , respectively , between the photometric catalog and the spectroscopic kb , before and after the completeness limit of the sdss spectroscopic sample ( @xmath78 ) and the @xcite cuts application . within the completeness limit",
    ", the k - s test confirms the similarity of the two distributions , perfectly overlapping after the application of @xcite cuts . beyond the completeness limit",
    ", the k - s test makes evident a difference between the two distributions , considered reasonable by taking into account the incompleteness of the spectroscopic sample .    in the produced catalogue ,",
    "a quality flag has been included to take the @xcite cuts into consideration .",
    "the main scope of the present work was to investigate the possibility of disentangling different spectral classes of objects , by exploiting the machine learning based model named mlpqna @xcite . in order to reach these goals , three categories of experiments",
    "have been performed .    in a first group of experiments we investigated the possibility to disentangle different spectroscopic types present in the galaxy class .",
    "all experiments , summarized in the tables [ tab : goresults ] and [ tab : nb ] were unable to separate agns from normal galaxies on the grounds of optical data only , although the overall efficiency is always @xmath26 , thus confirming what we found in @xcite . by excluding the agn class , in all other cases where the number of representative objects in the kb is sufficiently large , the disentangling appears quite feasible , in particular by considering results of the experiment _ nba _ ( table  [ tab : nba ] ) .",
    "the second one concerned distinguishing between qso and star classes .",
    "the results , shown in table  [ tab : twoclass ] , confirmed the findings of @xcite , that the use of @xmath18 colors , rather than the standard @xmath80 colors , although without carrying a great amount of additional information , may help machine learning methods to find better solutions .",
    "the third category focused on identifying candidate qsos from the whole catalogue including also stars and galaxies , thus permitting to release the candidate qso photometric catalogue . in this case , the possibility of avoiding the known downside of hierarchical pairwise classification ( multiplicative propagation of misclassification ) , induced an intrinsic advantage of a direct classification of qsos from the whole catalogue .",
    "the resulting catalogue of qso candidates contains @xmath55 objects , of which @xmath81 are flagged as robust candidates , according to the quality flag introduced to take into account the @xcite selection criteria .",
    "this catalogue will be made publicly available through the cds vizier facility .",
