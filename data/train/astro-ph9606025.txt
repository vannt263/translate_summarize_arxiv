    "in this paper we assess primordial nucleosynthesis in light of the new lyman limit system - derived deuterium abundance data @xcite . based on our analysis",
    "we adopt the view that currently we do not have a reliable handle on the primordial abundances of @xmath1he , @xmath2he , and @xmath3li ; whereas , the keck telescope may be providing us with a direct measurement of the abundance of the very fragile deuteron in relatively chemically - unevolved primordial material .",
    "this is a somewhat radical view , given that much of the past discussion on big bang nucleosynthesis ( bbn ) has been predicated on the idea of concordance  where a single global specification of the parameters characterizing nuclear statistical equilibrium ( nse ) freeze - out nucleosynthesis can lead the calculated abundances to agree with their observationally - inferred primordial values within errors . in a computation of nse freeze - out nucleosynthesis @xcite ,",
    "it is necessary to specify : ( 1 ) either the entropy - per - baryon @xmath11 ( cosmic average in units of boltzmann s constant @xmath12 ; where @xmath13 is the baryon closure fraction and @xmath14 is the hubble parameter in units of @xmath15 ) , or the baryon - to - photon ratio @xmath4 ( cosmic average @xmath16 ) ; ( 2 ) the spatial distribution of either of these quantities , both on scales smaller than the particle horizon at the epoch of nse freeze - out and on super - horizon scales ; ( 3 ) the three net lepton - to - photon numbers ; ( 4 ) the ratio of the axial vector to vector weak interaction coupling constants ( derived from the neutron lifetime ) ; and ( 5 ) the expansion rate through the epoch of freeze - out .",
    "the expansion rate is determined by the energy density in the horizon . in turn , in the expected radiation - dominated conditions of bbn , the energy density is usually parametrized as an effective number of light neutrino species @xmath9 , representing all relativistic particle degrees of freedom beyond those contributed by photons , electrons and positrons .",
    "the usual procedure has been to compute nucleosynthesis yields as a function of @xmath4 , for specifications of @xmath9 and the neutron lifetime , _ assuming _ that the entropy is homogeneously distributed on all scales and _ assuming _ that all net lepton numbers are small ( @xmath17 ) and neutrino masses are small and there are no other relativistic degrees of freedom .",
    "these simple occam s razor assumptions are then justified  by finding a concordant @xmath4 where all the independently - determined primordial abundances line up with their values predicted in the calculations ( _ cf .",
    "such concordance - based justification has been touted as being all the more impressive and secure , given that the predicted and observationally - determined abundances range over some ten orders of magnitude .",
    "the claimed precisions in the determinations of the primordial abundances of @xmath0h , @xmath1he , @xmath2he , and @xmath3li have increased to the point where , if taken at face value , they invalidate the simple picture of concordance outlined above @xcite .",
    "this is the recent so - called crisis  in bbn .",
    "in fact , there were even earlier hints at a potential problem with the standard picture of concordance @xcite .    with their adopted abundances of the @xmath0h and @xmath2he , the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite find no concordance for @xmath8 , and derive a best fit to concordance for @xmath18 with @xmath8 ruled out at the @xmath19 c.l .. these authors have suggested that perhaps this discrepancy could be eliminated with the introduction of new neutrino physics , essentially relaxing the usual assumptions regarding the above - discussed parameters ( 3 ) and ( 5 ) in bbn .",
    "this conclusion and interpretation has been disputed by copi _ et .",
    "@xcite , who take as a prior assumption that @xmath8 and then argue that @xmath2he has been underestimated .",
    "cardall and fuller ( @xcite , see also @xcite ) have done a re - analysis of this problem in light of the discordant determinations of @xmath0h in ly-@xmath20 clouds and with special attention to the dependence of the bbn yields on @xmath9 and to the @xmath3li non - concordance problem ( which they conclude can not be rectified with new neutrino physics ) .",
    "this work tends to support the copi _",
    "as we shall see , new work on the observationally - inferred abundances of @xmath0h and @xmath2he provides further support for this view and offers a hint of a new concordance .",
    "the deuteron is the most fragile of all nuclei , with a binding energy of only @xmath21 .",
    "as a result , the @xmath0h yield in bbn is exponentially sensitive to @xmath4 , though only mildly sensitive to @xmath9 @xcite .",
    "however , the fragile nature of the deuteron makes it extremely vulnerable to even small amounts of stellar processing and this , in turn , calls into question claims that we have a reliable handle on the primordial deuterium abundance .",
    "direct measurements using the keck telescope of isotope - shifted hydrogen lines in high redshift ly - limit systems along lines of sight to distant qso s may completely circumvent these stellar processing issues @xcite .",
    "this is because these systems have manifestly low metallicity and this argues against significant stellar processing - induced destruction of @xmath0h @xcite .    at present",
    ", however , there is no consensus on the primordial value of @xmath0h / h from this technique : the seattle - hawaii group @xcite obtains a very high range for this quantity ( @xmath22 from ref .",
    "@xcite ) ; whereas , the san diego group @xcite examining different clouds obtains a consistently much lower range ( @xmath23 , combined results from refs .",
    "@xcite and @xcite with @xmath24 statistical error and @xmath25 systematic error ) . here",
    "@xmath26h / h @xmath27 .",
    "an analysis of these discordant ranges is performed in ref .",
    "@xcite . in this analysis ,",
    "we have adapted the kawano bbn code ( with neutron lifetime from ref .",
    "@xcite , reaction rates from ref .",
    "@xcite , and a small , nearly @xmath4-independent correction to the @xmath2he yield , @xmath28 , from the time step and weak rate corrections of ref .",
    "the bbn yields for @xmath0h , @xmath2he , and @xmath3li are plotted as functions of @xmath9 and @xmath4 .",
    "such plots give insight into the leverage which each light element species has on concordance . since , in contrary fashion to @xmath0h , the bbn @xmath2he yield is relatively sensitive to @xmath9 and much less sensitive to @xmath4 , the tension between the overlap of these two species on our plots provides the most strigent criterion for concordance .",
    "this analysis shows that for the typically adopted range of the @xmath2he abundance @xcite and the spite plateau   @xmath3li abundance measured in old , hot pop ii halo stars @xcite , concordance is readily attained for the seattle - hawaii @xmath0h for @xmath8 . on the other hand ,",
    "no concordance with these values of @xmath2he and @xmath3li is possible for _ any _ @xmath9 with the san diego deuterium determination .",
    "lack of concordance with the spite plateau  @xmath3li abundance may not be a serious problem : this determination of primordial @xmath3li is fraught with potential sytematic uncertainty , as @xmath3li is destroyed readily by @xmath29 at temperatures as low as @xmath30 .",
    "therefore , rotation - induced mixing and turbulent diffusion could have destroyed most of the original @xmath3li on the surfaces of the old halo stars @xcite . however , the issue is complicated by the claimed observation of the even more fragile species @xmath31li in some of these objects@xcite .",
    "if mixing - induced destruction ( _ depletion _ ) of @xmath3li has indeed occurred , then the @xmath31li could have been produced _ in situ _",
    "@xcite ; alternatively , stellar wind - driven mass loss could deplete @xmath3li while leaving some @xmath31li present @xcite .",
    "we here present plots showing the concordance situation when allowance is made for some @xmath3li depletion . in figure 1",
    "we show the @xmath4-@xmath9 parameter space corresponding to the seattle - hawaii deuterium range ( dotted lines ) , along with the ranges for @xmath2he ( @xmath32 , solid lines ) and @xmath3li ( @xmath33 , dashed lines ) taken from ref .",
    "@xcite . here",
    "@xmath34 is the primordial mass fraction of @xmath2he , and @xmath35 .",
    "this range of @xmath36 reflects @xmath24 statistical errors and @xmath37 sytematic errors , and allows for a factor of @xmath38 depletion ( contained in the sytematic error ) on the spite plateau .",
    "concordance of all of these species is apparent for @xmath8 in figure 1 .",
    "however , if we adopt the san diego deuterium range as primordial , with the same ranges adopted for the other species ( figure 2 ) , then the crisis  is evident , as there is no statistically significant overlap for @xmath8 .",
    "the quality of the san diego group s data and the sophistication of their self - consistent analysis can not be dismissed .",
    "furthermore , there are a number of astrophysical problems which are partially or completely ameliorated if the san diego group s deuterium range is adopted as primordial .",
    "this range for @xmath0h / h would correspond to a range in baryonic closure fraction @xmath39 .",
    "in contrast , adoption of the seattle - hawaii @xmath0h / h as primordial would imply the much smaller closure fraction @xmath40 .",
    "there are hints from the x - ray galaxy cluster problem @xcite that the higher range for @xmath41 is to be preferred_e.g . _",
    "the coma cluster apparently has a fractional baryonic mass @xmath42 or @xmath43 for @xmath44 .",
    "likewise , the macho project gravitational microlensing results @xcite suggest that most or all of the galactic dark halo mass ( corresponding to @xmath45 to @xmath46 ) is composed of objects with masses in the range @xmath47 to @xmath48 .",
    "it is clear that the seattle - hawaii deuterium range implies a baryonic closure fraction which is difficult to reconcile with these macho results if the lensing objects had baryonic progenitors .",
    "finally , observation of the cosmic background radiation doppler peaks may require a high range of @xmath49 @xcite .",
    "an alternative to the adoption of the san diego deuterium as primordial would be to invoke super - horizon scale entropy fluctuations at the epoch of bbn ( _ i.e. _ , relax the homogeneity assumption of bbn parameter 2 ) @xcite .",
    "though such a scheme could give a comfortably high @xmath50 @xcite , it would require a fair degree of fine tuning of the fluctuation spectrum and would _ demand _ that the cosmic average primordial deuterium abundance be high @xmath51 @xcite .",
    "present statistics of lyman limit sytems and other uncertainties would have to improve significantly to establish such intrinsic inhomogeneity @xcite , so it seems reasonable to discount this scheme at present and see if a concordance can be found with adoption of the san diego deuterium as a homogeneous primordial value .",
    "a recent reinvestigation ( with new data ) of the linear regression method for estimating the primordial @xmath2he abundance has called into question the systematic uncertainties assigned to @xmath52 @xcite .",
    "in fact , this study derives @xmath53 , where the @xmath54 error is statistical .",
    "it is clear that the central value of this result is well above twice the systematic error assigned by refs .",
    "@xcite , confirming the suspicion @xcite that @xmath52 is not known well enough to draw sweeping conclusions regarding a lack of concordance .    in figure 3",
    "we show both the san diego and seattle - hawaii @xmath0h ranges ( dotted lines ) , along with the same @xmath3li range range ( dashed lines ) employed in figure 1 , but now with a band ( solid lines ) for @xmath2he ( @xmath55 , reflecting @xmath24 statistical errors and no systematic uncertainty ) meant to be representative of the ref .",
    "@xcite results .",
    "it is evident from this figure that there is now no statistically significant concordance between @xmath2he and the seattle - hawaii @xmath0h for @xmath8 , while there is now a hint of concordance for the san diego @xmath0h range for @xmath8 .",
    "the new concordance engendered by the san diego deuterium would be even better if allowance for systematic error were to be made in the @xmath2he range .",
    "such a new concordance would probably still require significant depletion of @xmath3li in old , hot pop ii halo stars @xcite , though the classic constraints on neutrino physics from bbn @xcite would survive intact and could be strengthened @xcite ."
