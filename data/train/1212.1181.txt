    "the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) of active galactic nuclei ( agn ) spans several orders of magnitude in frequency and results from the superposition of radiation emitted by different components .    in radio",
    " quiet type 1 sources , characterized by the presence of broad emission lines in their optical spectrum , the most luminous components are the `` big blue bump '' ( bbb , between @xmath01 @xmath2 m and @xmath03 nm , or @xmath314.517 ) and the `` infrared bump '' ( ir bump , between @xmath01 mm and @xmath01 @xmath2 m or @xmath411.514.5 ) .",
    "the former is the most prominent feature in the sed @xcite , while the latter accounts for 2040% of the bolometric agn luminosity .",
    "the bbb is thought to be thermal radiation from the accretion disk , while the ir bump is thermal radiation emitted from a dusty torus located a @xmath01 pc from the black hole @xcite .",
    "superimposed to the bbb there is often a minor component named `` small blue bump '' ( sbb , extending from 2200 to 4000 ) which is likely the blending of several iron lines and hydrogen balmer continuum @xcite .",
    "this scheme roughly describes the sed of agn over at least 5 orders of magnitude in bolometric luminosity @xcite .",
    "it also applies to powerful blazars , although in these cases two more components are needed to describe the entire sed : the `` synchrotron hump '' ( extending from radio to ir / optical wavelengths ) and the `` compton hump '' ( extending from x  rays to tev energies ) which may overwhelm the torus and the bbb radiation .",
    "these further components characterize radio  loud sources whose jet is closely aligned to the line of sight , and are due to the synchrotron and inverse compton processes , respectively .",
    "the common energy production process in agn is believed to be accretion onto a super  massive black hole ( @xmath5 ) , through a disk whose observational properties depend ( among other parameters ) on the black hole mass and accretion rate .",
    "this interpretation led several authors to use models of geometrically thin , optically thick accretion disks ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter ad model ) to fit the optical / uv sed of agn in order to determine the black hole mass and the accretion rate ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the ad fitting method allowed to estimate such quantities for those active nuclei which are too distant ( @xmath6 ) or too bright for other direct methods , such as resolved stellar / gas dynamics , to be applied @xcite .",
    "however , as discussed extensively in @xcite and references therein , such simple models provide only rough fits to the observed data . among the major issues with this interpretation",
    ", we point out a few ones : the broad  band continuum slopes @xmath7 ( with @xmath8 ) at optical  nuv wavelengths found in literature ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) are incompatible with the slope @xmath9 , expected from the ad model ; the spectrum from a simple accretion disk does not reproduce the observed power law extending at x ",
    "rays and the soft x  ray excess ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) ; the gross properties of the spectrum of radio  quiet agn appear to scale with the luminosity @xcite , but does not shift in frequency @xcite .",
    "the latter issue indicates that the bbb spectrum peaks always at , or near , the same frequency .",
    "however , this observation is hard to reconcile with reasonably broad distributions of black hole masses , accretion rates , inclinations and radiative efficiencies . given these difficulties , the ad fitting method is not widely employed as a black hole mass estimation method .",
    "rather , it is sometimes used to indirectly infer other parameters such as the accretion efficiency ( @xcite , but see @xcite ) or to explain specific quasar properties @xcite , while the black hole mass is usually estimated using reverberation mapping calibrated scaling relations ( the so  called  single epoch virial method  , or se virial , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the se virial method is currently employed to estimate black hole masses in large catalogs ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) for its simple applicability . however , the resulting black hole mass estimates are known to be affected by uncertainties of a factor of @xmath03 @xcite .",
    "in addition , there may be systematic uncertainties related to the broad line region ( blr ) geometry and inclination ; the role of radiation pressure ; the modeling of emission line profiles ; the contribution from other components ( e.g. host galaxy ) ; intrinsic differences between different agn ; and whether gravity dominates the motions of the blr clouds @xcite .",
    "black hole masses estimated in this way are subjected to a number of assumptions and may therefore be just order of magnitude estimates ( e.g. @xcite , but see @xcite ) .",
    "there has been claims about the existence of a correlation between the se virial mass and the radio luminosity , either absolute @xcite or normalized to the optical luminosity ( i.e. the radio loudness parameter , @xcite ) .",
    "it was further noticed that a black hole mass greater than @xmath10 would be required in order to develop a relativistic jet as observed in powerful blazars .",
    "later , these findings have been revisited with the availability of larger samples .",
    "@xcite found that both the radio  quiet and radio  loud agn span the same range of black hole mass , and that there is no evidence for a strong correlation between the radio  loudness and black hole mass .",
    "recently , the issue on the black hole mass threshold has been revisited by @xcite : by taking into account the radiation pressure on the blr clouds in computing the se virial masses they found that a black hole mass @xmath11 is required to produce a radio  loud agn .    in this paper",
    "we revisit the ad spectrum fitting method and show (  [ sec - ssad - bbb ] ) that the ad model provides a rather satisfactory description of the type 1 agn sed in the majority of cases ( at least at optical / nuv wavelengths ) once the contributions from other emitting components ( such as host galaxy and/or jet ) have been properly taken into account .",
    "therefore , the ad modeling method is a viable and independent way to estimate black hole masses .",
    "this is particularly interesting for a class of agn sources for which black hole masses are suspected to be systematically underestimated by the se virial method : the narrow line seyfert 1 ( nls1 ) galaxies @xcite .",
    "nls1 sources are characterized by the relatively small values of the full width at half maximum ( fwhm ) of the `` broad '' component of the h@xmath12 emission line ( fwhm(h@xmath12 ) @xmath13 2000 km s@xmath14 ) , by the presence of strong blended iron lines , and of a prominent soft x ",
    "ray excess @xcite . by estimating the virial black hole mass using the h@xmath12 emission line , and width as a surrogate for the bulge stellar velocity dispersion , @xcite and",
    "@xcite claimed that nls1 lie systematically below the @xmath15@xmath16 of non  active and active broad line galaxies ( bls1 ) .",
    "this indicates that the black hole masses of nls1 are systematically smaller than the black hole masses of bls1 for a given value of @xmath16 .",
    "the same considerations apply when considering objects of the same luminosity : nls1 appear to accrete at a higher eddington ratio with respect to bls1 , with some objects exceeding the eddington luminosity @xcite .",
    "recently , a few nls1 sources have been confirmed to be part of a new class of @xmath17ray emitting sources , as detected by _",
    "@xcite , besides blazars and radio  galaxies .",
    "variability of the @xmath17ray emission @xcite allows to exclude a starburst origin of the @xmath17rays and confirms the presence of powerful relativistic jets , such as those found in typical blazars .",
    "the emerging picture is that @xmath17nls1 sources are very similar to powerful blazars , except for their small widths of broad lines , and consequently their small se virial black hole masses ( @xmath18 , @xcite ) .",
    "hence these sources are the best candidates to settle the question on whether very massive black holes ( @xmath19 ) power relativistic jets .",
    "if the se virial mass estimates will be confirmed this would imply that a large mass is not required to produce a radio  loud agn . on the other hand ,",
    "if masses turn out to be systematically under  estimated in nls1 , we would then conclude that extragalactic jetted sources preferentially live in large black hole mass systems .",
    "furthermore we may find that nls1 too lie on the `` canonical '' @xmath15@xmath16 relation of broad line sources and accrete close to ( albeit below ) the eddington rate .",
    "possible explanations for the observed small widths of the broad lines in nls1 include : the virial mass scaling relations may need to be modified in order to account for radiation pressure effects @xcite ; the blr may have a disk  like geometry and be oriented almost face - on , so that the doppler shifted line velocity , projected along the line of sight , turns out to be small @xcite ; a combination of these effects @xcite .    in this work",
    "we show that the broad  band composite seds of agn are roughly compatible with a simple , non  relativistic ad model (  [ sec - ssad - bbb ] ) , and discuss a method to estimate the total disk luminosity using either the continuum (  [ sec - cont2ld ] ) or the line luminosities (  [ sec - line2ld ] ) as proxy .",
    "then , we perform a spectroscopic analysis of the sdss spectra of 23 radio  loud nls1 (  [ sec - sample ] ) in order to disentangle the host galaxy and/or jet contribution from the agn continuum , and estimate line luminosities (  [ sec - gasf ] ) . in  [ sec - method ] we discuss a new method to estimate the black hole mass and accretion rate , using ad spectrum modeling , and apply this method on the afore mentioned sample .",

    "the parameter for the ad model are : @xmath42=9 , @xmath43=0.05 and @xmath44 .",
    "the agreement between the ad model and the composite sed is rather good , therefore the association between the bbb and thermal emission from simple ad model is justified , at least in the interval 10005000 , or @xmath45=14.815.5 ( black dotted vertical lines ) .",
    "a few discrepancies between the ad model and the composite type 1 qso sed arise :    * at @xmath4614.7 a further component emerges in the spectrum , which may be either the host galaxy , the emission from a dusty torus or some other component ; * at @xmath4715 a small blue bump ( sbb ) is present , likely due to a blending of iron lines and hydrogen balmer continuum ; * at @xmath4815.6 other physical components contribute to the flux ( e.g. a corona ) .    note that , in this interpretation of the bbb , the portion of the ad spectrum characterized by the @xmath49 slope ( thick blue line ) is hidden by the host galaxy and the torus components , and can not be revealed directly with observations ( although in some case it may be detected in polarized light , @xcite ) .",
    "the average slopes at optical / uv and far uv ( green and purple lines ) are roughly consistent with the slopes near the peak of the ad spectrum .",
    "we notice however that fixed spectral features ( such as the sbb ) may affect the estimation of spectral slopes .",
    "furthermore , the value of the slope likely depends on the width of the wavelength range inside which it is defined .",
    "therefore it is not always possible to infer the presence of an ad spectrum by just checking the spectral slopes at optical / uv wavelengths .",
    "by contrast , at near ir the average slope ( green line ) is inconsistent with an ad spectrum , but this is likely due to the host galaxy component .",
    "we conclude that the ad model provides a reasonable description of the gross properties of type 1 agn sed at optical / nuv wavelengths , and the similarity between the predicted spectrum and the average bbb is rather strong . under this assumption",
    "it is possible to infer the black hole mass and the accretion rate by comparing the observed sed with the ad spectrum , as discussed in  [ sec - method ] .",
    "our black hole mass estimation method requires an estimate of the disk luminosity ( @xmath50 ) , as discussed in the following two sections .",
    "the broad  band similarity among agn spectra allows to use the continuum luminosity at a given wavelength as a proxy for the bolometric luminosity , that is @xmath51 . in order to explore this relationship",

    ". [ eq - cont2disclum ] provides a reliable estimate of @xmath67 as long as the source continuum is not dominated by other emitting components such as host galaxy starlight or synchrotron radiation from a relativistic jet ( for radio  loud sources ) . in these cases",

    "relations similar to eq .",
    "[ eq - cont2disclum ] can be obtained by using line luminosities .",

    "therefore it is possible to have a rough estimate of the luminosity of all emission lines by measuring the luminosity of a single line . also , according to the photo  ionization model , the line  emitting gas is ionized by the accretion disk continuum radiation",

    "this provides a way to estimate the disk luminosity using a single ( or a few ) line luminosity estimates . in order to calibrate the @xmath70 parameter we consider all sources in the s11 catalog having both a continuum and line luminosity estimate for at least one of the combinations : 5100h@xmath12 , 3000 and 1350. the number of sources in each subsample are 22644 , 85514 and 52157 respectively ( note that a single source typically belongs to two such subsamples )",

    "following these prescriptions the line method can be efficiently implemented as an automated procedure on large samples .      in order to assess the reliability of the line procedure we proceed with a visual localization of the ad spectrum peak using the sdss and galex observations .",

    "a similar situation ( jet component overestimated at optical / nuv wavelengths ) possibly occurs also for source # 22 . in order to be conservative , for this source we retained the original constraints to identify the best model . for the other sources the jet extrapolation is marginal at optical / nuv wavelengths ( tab .",
    "[ tab - results ] ) , hence the assumption discussed here has a negligible effect . * for the # 5 and # 15 sources the galex photometry does not follow the extrapolation from the sdss slope . therefore a single ad model is not compatible with both the sdss and galex observations .",

    "# 9 , # 10 and # 20 ) the observed sdss continuum appears `` flat '' in the @xmath97 representation , with no hints for a change of slope .",

    "the comparison with the se virial mass reveals a systematic discrepancy between our mass estimate and those from the y08 and s11 catalogs ( fig .",
    "[ fig - cmp - mass ] and [ fig - cmp - mass - h ] ) .",
    "although the discrepancy ( @xmath1290.7 dex , eq . [ eq - ratio - ad - vir ] ) is of the same order of the maximum uncertainty associated to the line procedure (  [ sec - method - auto ] ) , it appears systematic .",
    "therefore our black hole mass estimates are not compatible with the virial ones given in the y08 and s11 catalogs . on average ,",
    "our black hole masses turn out to be a factor @xmath06 ( 0.8 dex ) greater than virial ones . a possible explanation for this black hole mass discrepancy may involve a radiative efficiency which is a factor @xmath06 lower than assumed .",
    "however , a value of @xmath130 is lower than the minimum efficiency expected for accretion onto a maximally counter  rotating black hole ( @xmath131 ) .",
    "notice that the ad spectrum suggests that the accretion disk is still in the `` radiatively efficient '' regime : half the gravitational energy gained by matter at each radius is locally emitted as radiation , i.e. it is not advected into the hole .",
    "the mass discrepancy is not due to an inaccurate estimation of the jet contribution at optical / nuv wavelengths .",
    "if the actual jet contribution is lower than estimated , the corresponding agn continuum luminosity ( @xmath109 ( tab .",
    "[ tab - results ] ) would correspondingly be higher .",
    "the `` ceiling '' luminosity level , on the other hand , are not affected by the presence of the jet , since it relies on line luminosities . in order to reproduce an higher @xmath109 , retaining the same peak luminosity",
    ", the line ad model must shift to lower frequencies .",
    "therefore , if the actual jet contribution is lower than estimated , we would have obtained greater line black hole mass estimates , and greater discrepancy with se virial masses . furthermore , the mass discrepancy is not due to having neglected the general relativistic corrections in the ad model . as discussed in ",
    "[ sec - grcorrections ] , the ad model used throughout this work mimics the more sophisticated general relativistic one with @xmath132 , as long as frequencies below the peak are concerned .",
    "we speculate that a possible explanation for the mass discrepancy is a selection effect in calibrating the se virial method .",
    "the virial method relies on the calibration of both a blr size ",
    "continuum luminosity relation and of a virial factor @xcite . however , the sample used to perform the calibration consists of a few dozens of sources : the ones that has been reverberation mapped . as a consequence , the calibration of the method may be biased by selection effects . in particular , the method may provide significantly underestimated black hole masses if the blr has a flat disk  like geometry , and it is seen almost face  on @xcite .",
    "if these conditions apply , then the discrepancy between our mass estimates and the virial ones would be greater ( on average ) for agn showing the smallest widths of broad emission lines , i.e. the class of nls1 sources @xcite .",
    "the black hole mass estimates provided by our method , on the other hand , are scarcely affected by the viewing angle and the geometry of the blr (  [ sec - method - auto ] ) .",
    "the eddington ratios are in the range @xmath790.040.2 ( tab .",
    "[ tab - results2 ] ) , significantly below the values reported in y08 .",
    "this discrepancy is due both to our greater black hole mass estimates ( a factor @xmath06 ) and to the fact that we used the disk luminosity @xmath50 ( instead of @xmath133 ) to compute the eddington ratio ( a factor @xmath03.4 , eq .",
    "[ eq - lbol2ld ] and [ eq - ad - iso - corr2 ] ) . hence , our values of eddington ratio a factor @xmath134 smaller than se virial ones on average .",
    "with such small values of @xmath43 the role of radiation pressure in determining the se virial masses @xcite is expected to be small , not sufficient to explain the black hole mass discrepancy .",
    "if the assumptions discussed in  [ sec - method - hyp ] apply , then all the independently estimated black hole masses ( even the se virial ones ) should produce an ad spectrum compatible with the observed data .",
    "this provides a simple way to compare our results with those reported in y08 and s11 . the black hole mass discrepancy arises because the peak frequencies of the line and best ad spectra are significantly lower then the peak frequencies of the y08 and s11 ones , while the peak luminosities are compatible . if the y08 and s11 ad models ( blue and green lines in fig .",
    "[ fig - mass ] ) were the correct ones , there must be a physical process able to shift photon to lower frequencies ( i.e. to lower `` temperatures '' ) in order to account for the observed data .",
    "however , such a process can not exist on a thermodynamic basis , since black body spectra ( which build up the ad model ) already have the lowest temperature corresponding to a given luminosity and emitting surface .",
    "since the luminosities are the same , the only way to reduce the temperature is to increase the emitting surface , that is by increasing the black hole mass .",
    "in this work we analyzed the relationship between the big blue bump ( bbb ) observed in the sed of type 1 agn and a @xcite accretion disk model ( ad model ) . the characteristic disk spectral slope @xmath117 can not be directly observed in the agn sed because of the contributions from other emitting components such as the host galaxy , the torus or ( for radio  loud sources ) the jet (  [ sec - ssad - bbb ] ) .",
    "once these contributions are taken into account , the observations are compatible with the presence of an emitting component which is well described by an ad model . in particular , the peak of such component can be observed directly in the frequency range @xmath135 14.815.5 . by comparing the average type 1 agn sed from @xcite with the ad model",
    "we calibrate the relations to estimate the total disk luminosity using the continuum line luminosities ( at 1350 , 3000 and 5100 ) as proxy (  [ sec - cont2ld ] ) . furthermore , by using the emission line templates from @xcite , we calibrate analogous relations based on the line luminosities of h@xmath12 , and (  [ sec - line2ld ] ) .",
    "the latter provide more reliable disk luminosity estimates when the continuum is not dominated by the ad spectrum .",
    "the interpretation of the bbb as being due to the thermal emission from an ad allows to link the agn observed properties to the properties of the super massive black hole .",
    "in particular , the luminosity and frequency at the peak of the ad spectrum uniquely identifies a value for the black hole mass and the accretion rate (  [ sec - method ] ) .",
    "however , the direct observation of the peak of the ad spectrum requires broad  band multiwavelength observations . in order to estimate the black hole mass also for sources with a poor observational coverage",
    ", we propose a new method which relies only on spectral observations at optical wavelengths .",
    "in particular , we constrain the luminosity of the peak by using the line luminosities",
    ". then we constrain the frequency of the peak by requiring the ad model continuum and slope to reproduce the observed agn continuum beneath the emission lines (  [ sec - method - auto ] ) .",
    "the maximum uncertainty on our black hole mass estimates is @xmath136 dex ( on average ) .",
    "this uncertainty is greatly reduced if the disk luminosity can be accurately determined , namely when the peak of the ad spectrum is visible within the frequency range of the data .",
    "we applied our method to the sample of 23 radio  loud narrow line seyfert 1 galaxies ( rl  nls1 ) of @xcite .",
    "the method provides reliable black hole mass estimates for 17 sources over 23 , if our interpretation of the bbb is correct (  [ sec - results ] , [ sec - discussion ] ) .",
    "the remaining six sources are either dominated by synchrotron radiation from the jet , or do not show `` hints '' for the presence of an ad  like emitting component .",
    "the resulting black hole mass estimates are a factor @xmath137 ( on average ) greater than the corresponding single epoch virial mass estimates , and the eddington ratios are a factor @xmath134 below .",
