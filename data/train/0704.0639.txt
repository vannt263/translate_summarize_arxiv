    "gaussian states play a crucial role in quantum information processing with continuous variables .",
    "this is especially true for quantum optical implementations since radiation at thermal equilibrium , including the vacuum state , is itself a gaussian state and most of the hamiltonians achievable within the current technology are at most bilinear in the field operators , _",
    "i.e. _ preserve the gaussian character @xcite . as a matter of fact , using single - mode and entangled gaussian states , linear optical circuits and gaussian operations , like homodyne detection , several quantum information protocols have been implemented , including teleportation , dense coding and quantum cloning @xcite .    on the other hand quantum information protocols required for long distance communication , as for example entanglement distillation and entanglement swapping , rely on non - gaussian operations .",
    "in addition , it has been demonstrated that teleportation @xcite and cloning @xcite of quantum states may be improved by using non - gaussian states and non - gaussian operations .",
    "indeed , de - gaussification protocols for single - mode and two - mode states have been proposed @xcite and realized @xcite .",
    "it should be also noticed that any strongly superadditive function is minimized , at fixed covariance matrix , by gaussian states .",
    "this is crucial to prove extremality of gaussian states and gaussian operations @xcite for what concerns various quantities as channel capacities @xcite , multipartite entanglement measures @xcite and distillable secret key in quantum key distribution protocols .",
    "since in most cases these quantities can be computed only for gaussian states , a non - gaussianity measure may serve as a guideline to quantify them for the class of non - gaussian states .",
    "overall , non - gaussianity is revealing itself as a resource for continuous variable quantum information , and thus we urge a measure able to quantify the non - gaussian character of a quantum state .    in this paper",
    "we introduce a novel quantity , the non - gaussianity @xmath0 $ ] of a quantum state , which quantifies how much a state fails to be gaussian .",
    "our measure , which is based on the hilbert - schmidt distance between the state itself and a reference gaussian state , can be easily computed for any state , either single - mode or multi - mode .",
    "the paper is structured as follows . in the next section",
    "we introduce notation and review the basic properties of gaussian states .",
    "then , in section [ s : nong ] we introduce the formal definition of @xmath1 $ ] and study its properties in details . in section [ s : zoo ]",
    "we evaluate non - gaussianity of relevant quantum states whereas in section [ s : pro ] we analyze the evolution of non - gaussianity for known gaussification and de - gaussification maps .",
    "section [ s : out ] closes the paper with some concluding remarks .",
    "for concreteness , we will use here the quantum optical terminology of modes carrying photons , but our theory applies to general bosonic systems .",
    "let us consider a system of @xmath2 modes described by mode operators @xmath3 , @xmath4 , satisfying the commutation relations @xmath5=\\delta_{kj}$ ] . a quantum state @xmath6 of the @xmath2 modes is fully described by its characteristic function @xcite @xmath7({\\boldsymbol \\lambda } ) = \\tr[\\varrho\\,d({\\boldsymbol \\lambda})]\\ ] ] where @xmath8 is the @xmath2-mode displacement operator , with @xmath9 , @xmath10 , and where @xmath11 is the single - mode displacement operator .",
    "the canonical operators are given by : @xmath12 with commutation relations given by @xmath13=i\\delta_{jk}$ ] .",
    "upon introducing the real vector @xmath14 , the commutation relations rewrite as @xmath15 = i \\omega_{kj}\\ ] ] where @xmath16 are the elements of the symplectic matrix @xmath17 , @xmath18 being the @xmath19-pauli matrix .",
    "the covariance matrix @xmath20 $ ] and the vector of mean values @xmath21 $ ] of a quantum state @xmath6 are defined as @xmath22 where @xmath23 denotes the anti - commutator , and @xmath24 $ ] is the expectation value of the operator @xmath25 .    a quantum state @xmath26 is referred to as a gaussian state if its characteristic function has the gaussian form @xmath27({\\boldsymbol \\lambda } ) = \\exp \\left\\ { - \\frac{1}{2 } { \\boldsymbol \\lambda}^t { \\boldsymbol \\sigma}{\\boldsymbol \\lambda}+ \\x^t \\boldsymbol{\\omega } { \\boldsymbol \\lambda}\\right\\}\\ ] ] where @xmath28 is the real vector @xmath29 .",
    "of course , once the covariance matrix and the vector of mean values are given , a gaussian state is fully determined . for a single - mode system",
    "the most general gaussian state can be written as @xmath30 @xmath31 being the displacement operator , @xmath32 $ ] the squeezing operator , @xmath33 , and @xmath34^{a^\\dag a}$ ] a thermal state with @xmath35 average number of photons .",
    "in order to quantify the non - gaussian character of a quantum state @xmath6 we use a quantity based on the distance between @xmath6 and a reference gaussian state @xmath36 , which itself depends on @xmath6 . specifically , we define the non - gaussianity @xmath37 $ ] of the state @xmath6 as @xmath38 = \\frac { \\d_{hs}^2[\\varrho,\\tau ] } { \\mu[\\varrho ] } \\label{eq : nong}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath39 $ ] denotes the hilbert - schmidt distance between @xmath6 and @xmath36 @xmath40 & = \\frac{1}{2 } \\tr[(\\varrho - \\tau)^2 ] = \\frac { \\mu[\\varrho ] + \\mu[\\tau ] - 2\\kappa[\\varrho,\\tau ] } { 2},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath41=\\hbox{tr}[\\varrho^2]$ ] and @xmath42=\\hbox{tr}[\\varrho\\:\\tau]$ ] denoting the purity of @xmath6 and the overlap between @xmath6 and @xmath36 respectively .",
    "the gaussian reference @xmath36 is the gaussian state such that @xmath43 & = \\x[\\tau ] \\nonumber \\\\ \\boldsymbol{\\sigma}[\\varrho ] & = \\boldsymbol{\\sigma}[\\tau ] \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] _ i.e. _ @xmath36 is the gaussian state with the same covariance matrix @xmath44 and the same vector @xmath45 of the state @xmath6 .",
    "the relevant properties of @xmath46 $ ] , which confirm that it represents a good measure of the non - gaussian character of @xmath6 , are summarized by the following lemmas :    * lemma 1 * : @xmath37=0 $ ] iff @xmath6 is a gaussian state .    * proof * : if @xmath37=0 $ ] then @xmath47 and thus it is a gaussian state .",
    "if @xmath6 is a gaussian state , then it is uniquely identified by its first and second moments and thus the reference gaussian state @xmath36 is given by @xmath48 , which , in turn , leads to @xmath39=0 $ ] and thus to @xmath37=0 $ ] .",
    "* lemma 2 * : if @xmath49 is a unitary map corresponding to a symplectic transformation in the phase space , _ i.e. _ if @xmath50 with hermitian @xmath51 that is at most bilinear in the field operators , then @xmath52 = \\delta[\\varrho]$ ] .",
    "this property ensures that displacement and squeezing operations do not change the gaussian character of a quantum state .",
    "* proof * : let us consider @xmath53 .",
    "then the covariance matrix transforms as @xmath54 = \\sigma \\sigmacm[\\varrho ] \\sigma^t$ ] , @xmath55 being the symplectic transformation associated to @xmath49 . at the same time the vector of mean values simply translates to @xmath56 , where @xmath57 is the displacement generated by @xmath49 . since any gaussian state is fully characterized by its first and second moments ,",
    "then the reference state must necessarily transform as @xmath58 , _",
    "i.e. _ with the same unitary transformation @xmath49 . since the hilbert - schmidt distance and the purity of a quantum state are invariant under unitary transformations the lemma is proved .",
    "* lemma 3 * : @xmath37 $ ] is proportional to the squared @xmath59 distance between the characteristic functions of @xmath6 and of the reference gaussian state @xmath36 . in formula : @xmath38 \\propto \\int d^{2n}{{\\boldsymbol \\lambda } } \\ : [ \\chi[\\varrho]({\\boldsymbol \\lambda } ) - \\chi[\\tau]({\\boldsymbol \\lambda})]^2 \\:.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] since the notion of gaussianity of a quantum state is defined through the shape of its characteristic function , and since the characteristic function of a quantum state belongs to the @xmath59 space @xcite , we address @xmath60 distance to as a good indicator for the non gaussian character of @xmath6 .",
    "* proof * : since characteristic functions of self - adjoint operators are even functions of @xmath61 and by means of the identity @xmath62 = \\int \\frac{d^{2n}{{\\boldsymbol \\lambda}}}{\\pi^n } \\chi[o_1]({\\boldsymbol \\lambda})\\,\\chi[o_2](-{\\boldsymbol \\lambda})\\,,\\ ] ] we obtain @xmath63 = \\frac{1}{2 } \\int \\frac{d^{2n}{{\\boldsymbol \\lambda}}}{\\pi^n}\\ , \\left [ \\chi[\\varrho]({\\boldsymbol \\lambda } ) - \\chi[\\tau]({\\boldsymbol \\lambda } ) \\right]^2\\:.\\ ] ]    * lemma 4 * : consider a bipartite state @xmath64 .",
    "if @xmath26 is a gaussian state then @xmath37 = \\delta[\\varrho_a]$ ] .",
    "* proof * : we have @xmath65&= \\mu[\\varrho_a ] \\mu[\\varrho_g ] \\nonumber \\\\ \\mu[\\tau]&= \\mu[\\tau_a ] \\mu[\\tau_g ] \\nonumber \\\\ \\kappa[\\varrho,\\tau]&=\\kappa[\\varrho_a,\\tau_a]\\kappa[\\varrho_g,\\varrho_g ] \\ : . \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] therefore , since @xmath66=\\mu[\\varrho_g]$ ] we arrive at @xmath38 & = \\frac{\\mu[\\varrho_a ] \\mu[\\varrho_g ] + \\mu[\\tau_a]\\mu[\\varrho_g ] - 2 \\kappa[\\varrho_a,\\tau_a]\\kappa[\\varrho_g,\\varrho_g]}{2 \\mu[\\varrho_a ] \\mu[\\varrho_g ] } \\nonumber \\\\ & = \\delta[\\varrho_a]\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    the four properties illustrated by the above lemmas are the natural properties required for a good measure of the non - gaussian character of a quantum state . notice that by using the trace distance @xmath67 = \\frac{1}{2 } \\tr|\\varrho-\\tau|$ ] instead of the hilbert - schmidt distance we would lose lemmas 3 and 4 , and that the invariance expressed by lemma 4 holds thanks to the _ renormalization _ of the hilbert - schmidt distance through the purity @xmath41 $ ] .",
    "we stress the fact that our measure of non - gaussianity is a computable one : it may be evaluated for any quantum state of @xmath2 modes by the calculation of the first two moments of the state , followed by the evaluation of the overlap with the corresponding gaussian state .",
    "notice that @xmath0 $ ] is not additive ( nor multiplicative ) with respect to the tensor product .",
    "if we consider a ( separable ) multi - partite quantum state in the product form @xmath68 , the non - gaussianity is given by @xmath69 = \\frac { \\prod_{k=1}^n \\mu[\\varrho_k ] + \\prod_{k=1}^{n}\\mu[\\tau_k ]   - 2 \\prod_{k=1}^n \\kappa[\\varrho_k,\\tau_k ] } { 2 \\prod_{k=1}^n \\mu[\\varrho_k ] } \\label{eq : nongmultipartite } \\ ] ] where @xmath70 is the gaussian state with the same moments of @xmath71 .",
    "in fact , since the state @xmath6 is factorisable , we have that the corresponding gaussian @xmath36 is a factorisable state too .",
    "let us now exploit the definition ( [ eq : nong ] ) to evaluate the non - gaussianity of some relevant quantum states .",
    "at first we consider fock number states @xmath72 of a single mode as well as multimode factorisable states @xmath73 made of @xmath2 copies of a number state . the reference gaussian states are a thermal state @xmath74 with average photon number @xmath75 and a factorisable thermal state @xmath76^{\\otimes n}$ ] with average photon number @xmath75 in each mode @xcite .",
    "non - gaussianity may be analytically evaluated , leading to @xmath77 & = \\frac{1}{2}\\left ( 1 + \\frac{1}{2p + 1 } \\right ) - \\frac{1}{p+1 } \\left(\\frac{p}{p+1}\\right)^p \\nonumber \\\\",

    "[ f : states ] we show both @xmath78 $ ] and @xmath79 $ ] as a function of @xmath75 . as it is apparent from the plot non - gaussianity of fock states @xmath72 increases monotonically with the number of photon @xmath75 with the limiting value @xmath80 obtained for @xmath81 . upon considering multi - mode copies of fock states",
    "we obtain larger value of non - gaussianity : @xmath82 is a decreasing function of @xmath75 , approaching @xmath83 from above .",
