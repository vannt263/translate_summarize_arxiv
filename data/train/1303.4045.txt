    "cellular automata ( ca ) are dynamic systems in which space and time are discrete and physical quantities take on a finite set of discrete values . despite their simple construction , ca exhibit complicated behavior and generate complex patterns . by virtue of these properties , ca have been used as mathematical models for complex phenomena in the fields of physics , chemistry , biology , economics , and sociology@xcite .",
    "recently , one - dimensional conservative ca have attracted much attention as models for traffic flow@xcite .",
    "one of the simplest models is rule 184 , which is a neighborhood - three ca ( also called an elementary ca ) . since rule 184 exhibits phase transition from a free - flow state to a congestion state as real traffic flow does , it has been used as a basic model and extended to many other ca models .",
    "however , despite the intensive research on ca models for traffic flow , there are few studies dealing with all one - dimensional conservative ca in a unified way .",
    "a powerful method for dealing with ca is the ultradiscretization method@xcite , which connects difference equations and ca by applying the following simple formula for the transformation of variables : @xmath1 a conservative ca called the `` box and ball system '' ( bbs ) is obtained from the discrete kdv equation using this method , and other ca that possess a solitonic nature are obtained from soliton equations .",
    "moreover , rule 184 is derived from the discrete burgers equation@xcite .",
    "equation ( [ udlimit ] ) shows that the addition of the difference equations corresponds to the max operation of the ultradiscrete equation .",
    "the multiplication and division correspond to @xmath2 and @xmath3 , respectively , since we have @xmath4 though the subtraction is not well defined for the ultradiscrete equation , we can automatically obtain the ultradiscrete equation and its solution by replacing @xmath2 , @xmath5 and @xmath6 by max , @xmath2 and @xmath3 , respectively , if the subtraction is not included explicitly in the difference equations and their solutions . the algebra defined by operations of max , @xmath2 , and @xmath3",
    "is called `` max - plus '' algebra .",
    "binary operations such as and , or , and not can be easily converted to max - plus operations .    in a previous study@xcite",
    ", we investigated one - dimensional neighborhood - four conservative ca , referred to as particle cellular automata four ( particle ca4 ) , and found that evolution equations for particle ca4 - 1 , 4 - 2 , and 4 - 3 can be obtained in the form of max - plus expressions in combination with `` min , '' i.e. , `` max - min - plus '' expressions , which are the key to solving the equations and analyzing asymptotic behaviors .    in this study , we investigate particle ca5s and show that the evolution equations for particle ca5s that belong to certain types can be obtained in the form of max - min - plus expressions from fundamental diagrams .",
    "in addition , we show that the equations obtained are transformed into other max - min - plus expressions by ultradiscrete cole - hopf transformation , which enables us to analyze the asymptotic behaviors of general solutions . furthermore",
    ", we give the lagrange representation for the class of particle ca5s , which describes the motion of particles and can be obtained from a fundamental diagram .",
    "finally , we discuss the generalization to the neighborhood-@xmath0 ca case , that is , particle ca@xmath0 .",
    "let us consider the following equation @xmath7 where @xmath0 and @xmath8 are integers representing the timestep and space site number , respectively , and @xmath9 and @xmath10 are positive integer constants . assuming that @xmath11 takes the value of 0 or 1 , ( [ r - neighbor ca ] ) is an evolution equation for a one - dimensional ca with the rule defined by @xmath12 variable function @xmath13 .",
    "we call this ca a `` neighborhood-@xmath14 ca . ''",
    "following wolfram@xcite , to each rule @xmath13 , we assign a rule number @xmath15 such that @xmath16    in this study , we focus on the one - dimensional cas that satisfy @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the size of the one - dimensional lattices , and @xmath19 holds for all @xmath8 . from ( [ pca ] ) , the condition @xmath20 holds , which means that the sum of @xmath11 , that is the number of 1s at all space sites , is conserved for arbitrary @xmath0 .",
    "let @xmath21 denote the number of particles at the @xmath8th site and the @xmath0th timestep , and each `` 1 '' in the solution represents a particle .",
    "then , particles move among sites according to the evolution rule defined by ( [ r - neighbor ca ] ) without creation or annihilation .",
    "we call the ca satisfying this condition ( [ pcacond ] ) a `` particle ca '' in this sense .",
    "in @xcite , hattori and takesue showed that a neighborhood-@xmath14 ca with rule @xmath13 is a particle ca if and only if @xmath13 satisfies @xmath22 for all @xmath23 .    applying hattori and takesue s result to neighborhood - five ca expressed by the equation @xmath24 we obtain a system of @xmath25 linear equations with @xmath25 variables @xmath26 for all @xmath27 from ( [ ht1 ] ) and ( [ ht2 ] ) . by finding binary solutions to the system",
    ", we obtain 428 rules for one - dimensional conservative neighborhood - five ca ( particle ca5 ) .",
    "reflection symmetry @xmath28 and boolean conjugation symmetry @xmath29 for rules",
    "@xmath30 and @xmath31 reduce the 428 rules to 129 rules . furthermore , by excluding the rules for neighborhood - three and -four ca ( particle ca3 and particle ca4 , respectively ) , we have the following 115 rules :    which is the smallest rule number among their equivalent rules . in this paper",
    ", we assign a number `` @xmath32 '' in the range 1 - 115 to each rule , and call them particle ca5-@xmath32 .",
    "in the field of traffic - flow theory , a fundamental diagram is a useful tool for determining the traffic state of a roadway .",
    "this diagram relates traffic flux and traffic density . under periodic boundary conditions ,",
    "the density is defined by @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the period of sites .",
    "since the number of particles is conserved , @xmath35 is a constant irrespective of time @xmath0 .",
    "the average flux is defined by @xmath36 for large enough @xmath0 , the evolution often approaches a steady state where @xmath37 becomes a constant . in case of convergence ,",
    "the constant is defined by @xmath38 the graph of @xmath39 versus @xmath35 is called a `` fundamental diagram . ''    the following subsection shows that the evolution equations for particle ca5s that belong to certain types can be obtained in the form of max - min - plus expressions from a fundamental diagram .",
    "let us take particle ca5 - 34 ( rule 3163536512 ) as an example .",
    "the evolution equation for particle ca5 - 34 is given by @xmath40 together with the following rule table of @xmath13 .    [",
