    "ultracold atoms in an optical lattice allows us to simulate quantum phase transitions of lattice fermions and also bosons @xcite .",

    "the signature of the phase transitions can be observed in certain thermodynamic quantities @xcite .",
    "one of examples is to characterize the transition by observing the disappearance of a coherent peak structure in the number distribution of atoms in the momentum space @xcite .",
    "a spectroscopic measurement is another useful tool to detect phase transitions @xcite .",
    "this is because much information is included in spectra that reflect the dynamical response of many - body systems after excitations caused by a certain external field .",
    "furthermore , when the external field is very weak and perturbative , the dynamical response can be connected to thermodynamic quantities of thermal equilibrium states before excitations . in condensed matter physics , such a relationship , _",

    "it is thus required to deeply discuss such spectroscopic relationships specific to cold - atom systems .",
    "one of pioneering studies on spectroscopic measurement on atoms in a lattice is microwave spectroscopy experiments , where the mott shell structure has been observed by spectroscopically distinguishing the different number states of atoms @xcite .",
    "theoretically , the corresponding spectra have been studied with an approximation satisfying the ( first order ) spectral sum rule @xcite , which is derived from the general principle of spectroscopy @xcite .",
    "the first - order sum rule determines the relationship between the spectral peak position and the two - body correlation function of atoms @xcite .",
    "this is a prominent example that connects thermodynamics to dynamics in cold atom systems .",
    "this calculation assumed that the system is at zero temperature , while the realistic experiments have been done at low but finite temperatures .",
    "in addition , such a first order approximation is insufficient to discuss important properties of spectra , such as , a standard deviation and a spectral broadening , which can be connected to fluctuations of atoms in thermal equilibrium . on the other hand ,",
    "the laser spectroscopy is now being established @xcite .",
    "the laser and the microwave spectroscopy are understood as a similar type spectroscopy based on electromagnet - field excitations .",
    "however , the laser spectroscopy can not be straightforwardly described by the formulation of the previous studies @xcite . this is mainly due to the difference in wavelengths of the external fields .",
    "a reliable theoretical method for comprehensively analyzing these spectroscopy at finite temperatures is now required .    in this paper",

    "we start with analyzing the sum rules in the same way as the previous work @xcite , while we extend the approximation to the second order .",
    "this approach allows us to clarify that number fluctuations of atoms in thermal equilibrium can be connected to a broadening of spectra .",

    "a main role of thermal fluctuations is a decrease in the number of condensed atoms @xmath115 .",

    "we first explain the parameters and then discuss obtained results .",
    "we first point out intrinsic differences of the microwave and the laser spectroscopy , and provide parameters used in the calculations .",
    "a length of microwave is much longer than a lattice constant @xmath291 and a lattice laser wavelength @xmath292 ( e.g. , of @xmath293 nm ) , and as a result , a wavevector @xmath294 can be set zero .",

    "<S> we provide a numerical method to calculate comprehensively the microwave and the laser spectra of ultracold bosonic atoms in optical lattices at finite temperatures . our formulation is built up with the sum rules , up to the second order , derived from the general principle of spectroscopy . </S>",
    "<S> the sum rule approach allows us to discuss the physical origins of a spectral peak shift and also a peak broadening . </S>",
    "<S> we find that a spectral broadening of superfluid atoms can be determined from number fluctuations of atoms , while that of normal - state atoms is mainly attributed to quantum fluctuations resulting from hopping of atoms . to calculate spectra at finite temperatures , based on the sum rule approach , we provide a two - mode approximation assuming that spectra of the superfluid and normal state atoms can be calculated separately . </S>",
    "<S> our method can properly deal with multi - peak structures of spectra resulting from thermal fluctuations and also coexisting of the superfluid and the normal states . by combining the two - mode approximation with a finite temperature gutzwiller approximation </S>",
    "<S> , we calculate spectra at finite temperatures by considering realistic systems , and the calculated spectra show nice agreements with those in experiments . </S>"
