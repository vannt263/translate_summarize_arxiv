    "recently , the study of thermodynamical properties of the black holes using techniques explored in statistical physics and fluids has received a special interest @xcite .",
    "these researches have brought new understanding of the fundamental physics associated with the critical behaviors of several black holes in various dimensions using either numerical or analytic methods@xcite . in particular ,",
    "ads black holes in arbitrary dimensions have been extensively investigated in many works @xcite .",
    "more precisely , the state equations @xmath5 have been established by considering the cosmological constant as the thermodynamic pressure and its conjugate as the thermodynamic volume .",
    "in fact , this issue has opened a new way to study the behavior of the rn - ads black hole systems using the physics of van der waals fluids .",
    "indeed , it has been shown that the corresponding @xmath6-@xmath7 criticality can be linked to the liquid - gas systems of statistical physics .",
    "moreover , it has been realized that the criticality depends on many parameters including the dimension of the spacetime @xcite .",
    "more recently , a special interest has been devoted to study of maxwell s equal for some black hole solutions .",
    "more precisely , the state equations of various ads black hole in @xmath8 diagrams have been worked out showing the existence of undesirable negative pressure .",
    "they appear also thermodynamic unstable regions associated with the condition @xmath9 . in this way ,",
    "the corresponding system can be contracted and expanded automatically @xcite . in van der waals systems ,",
    "such problems have been overcame by using the maxwell equal area approach .",
    "the aim of this work is to contribute to these researches by studying higher dimensional uncharged and charged gauss - bonnet - anti - de sitter black holes in extended phase space .",
    "considering the cosmological constant @xmath0 as a thermodynamic pressure and its conjugate quantity as a thermodynamic volume , we present the maxwell s equal area law of higher gauss - bonnet - ads black holes in extended space .",
    "these black hole solutions involve critical behaviors like van der waals gas .",
    "it has been shown that below the critical temperature @xmath1 the stable equilibrium is violated .",
    "based on the maxwell s construction , we obtain the isobar line for which the liquid - gas phases coexist .    the paper is organized as follow . in section 2 , we give an overview on the thermodynamics of higher dimensional gauss - bonnet black holes in ads geometry . in section @xmath10 , we first study the equal area law of gauss - bonnet - ads black hole in extended phase space for uncharged solutions .",
    "next , we extend the analysis to the charged case in five dimensions . then , we present the results for higher dimensions .",
    "the last section is devoted to conclusion .",
    "in this section , we give an overview on thermodynamics of gauss - bonnet black holes in ads space .",
    "this matter is based on many works given by other authors @xcite . indeed , we start by considering a @xmath11-dimensional einstein - maxwell theory in the presence of the gauss - bonnet terms and a cosmological constant @xmath12 .",
    "the corresponding action reads as @xmath13 ,   \\label{action}\\ ] ] where @xmath14 is the gauss - bonnet coefficient with dimension @xmath15 ^ 2 $ ] . in this action , @xmath16 is the maxwell field strength given by @xmath17 where @xmath18 is an abelian gauge field . roughly speaking",
    ", the discussion will be given here corresponds to the case with a positive gauss - bonnet coefficient , namely , @xmath19 .",
    "as shown in @xcite , dynamical solutions appear only in higher dimensional theories ( @xmath20 ) .",
    "for this reason , it should be interesting to concentrate on such models . in this way",
    ", the above action produces a static black hole solution with the following metric @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the line element of a @xmath23-dimensional maximal symmetric einstein space with the constant curvature @xmath24 and volume @xmath25 .",
    "it is noted that @xmath26 takes three values @xmath27 , @xmath28 and @xmath29 , corresponding to the spherical , ricci flat and hyperbolic topology of the black hole horizon , respectively . according to  @xcite",
    ", the metric function @xmath30 takes the following form @xmath31 where @xmath32 . in this solution",
    ", @xmath33 represents the black hole mass , @xmath34 is linked to the charge of the black hole and @xmath35 . for well - defined vacuum solution associated with @xmath36 ,",
    "the effective gauss - bonnet coefficient @xmath37 and pressure @xmath6 must satisfy the following constraint @xmath38 it is recalled that the mass @xmath33 can be given in terms of the horizon radius @xmath39 of the black hole determined by the largest real root of the equation @xmath40 . it takes the following form @xmath41 similarly , the hawking temperature of the black hole reads as @xmath42 it is worth noting that in the discussion of the thermodynamics of the black hole in the extended phase space by considering the pressure @xmath35 , the black hole mass @xmath33 should be identified with the enthalpy @xmath43 rather than the internal energy of the gravitational system  @xcite .",
    "it turns out that many other thermodynamic quantities can be obtained using thermodynamical equations .",
    "for instance , the entropy @xmath44 , thermodynamic volume @xmath7 and electric potential ( chemical potential ) @xmath45 take the following forms @xmath46    @xmath47    @xmath48    these thermodynamic quantities satisfy the following differential form @xmath49    where @xmath50 is the conjugate quantity to the gauss - bonnet coefficient @xmath51 , being considered as a variable . by the scaling argument , the generalized smarr relation for the black holes can be written as @xmath52 moreover , many solutions treating other black holes are given in  @xcite .",
    "this class of black hole solutions has volume @xmath53 and an area given by @xmath54 . in this way",
    ", the black hole horizon has a scalar curvature @xmath55 .",
    "the gauss - bonnet term on the horizon is @xmath56 .",
    "in fact , the first term in ( [ beta ] ) can be put in the form @xmath57 , while the second term takes the form @xmath58 .",
    "it is observed that both terms vanish in the flat solution corresponding to @xmath59 .",
    "it is noted that the first term in ( [ beta ] ) is nothing but the second term in the black hole mass ( [ m ] ) , while the second term in ( [ beta ] ) is identified with the second term of the black hole entropy ( [ s ] ) multiplied by hawking temperature @xmath60 .",
    "using legendre transformations , the gibbs free energy and the helmholtz free energy read as @xmath61 however , it is recalled that the helmholtz free energy @xmath62 can be obtained by removing the contribution of the background of the ads vacuum solution . in this way , only the situation associated with a negative @xmath62 can be regarded as the black hole solution considered as a thermodynamically ads vacuum solution . in the case",
    "associated with the hyperbolic horizon ( @xmath63 )  @xcite , the black hole entropy could be negative .",
    "in fact , a negative entropy has no meaning in statistical physics . for these reasons , the constaints @xmath64 should be added .",
    "it is noted that in the case @xmath63 , the metric function @xmath30 ( [ fr ] ) shows the existence of a minimal horizon radius @xmath65 . however",
    ", the non - negative values of the black hole entropy ( [ s ] ) produce a more strong constraint on the horizon radius given by @xmath66 .",
    "having given the essentials on the thermodynamics of the gauss - bonnet - anti - de sitter black holes , we move to investigate the corresponding maxwell s equal area law .",
    "in the study of der waals system , for an isotherm below the critical temperature @xmath67 the two points , of the plan @xmath68 , solving the equation @xmath69 indicate the the stability limit of the system .",
    "it is observed that the critical point corresponding to the largest volume is interpreted as the stability limit of the gaseous phase .",
    "however , the critical point associated with the smallest volume corresponds to the stability limit of the liquid phase .",
    "the chemical potential of such thermodynamic systems should satisfy @xmath70 in the isotherm transformation , the difference of chemical potential between two states with the pressure @xmath6 and @xmath71 should have the following form @xmath72 it is realized that the gauss - bonnet - ads black holes present similar behaviors as illustrated in figure 1 .",
    "curve below the critical temperature.,title=\"fig : \" ]    it observed from this figure that , at the point @xmath73 , the black hole lies at `` gas '' phase .",
    "however , at point `` a '' , the black hole lies at `` liquid '' phase completely .",
    "moreover , the region between @xmath74 and @xmath73 can be considered as a coexistence phase",
    ". however , the oscillating part of the curve between @xmath74 and @xmath73 can not be the coexistence line due to the fact that the part @xmath75 violates the equilibrium conditions . at @xmath74 and @xmath73 , the chemical potentials @xmath76 and @xmath77 are @xmath78 this relation produces the thermodynamic condition for the phase equilibrium .",
    "indeed , the equation @xmath79 gives @xmath80 showing that the area @xmath81 and @xmath82 are equal .",
    "+ in what follows , the main aim is to investigate the position of the points @xmath74 and @xmath73 for gauss - bonnet - ads black holes in higher dimensions .",
    "first , we discuss the uncharged case then we will present numerical solutions for the charged black holes in the next section .",
    "in this subsection , we discus the neutral case corresponding to @xmath83 . identifying the pressure with the cosmological constant and the corresponding conjugate thermodynamic volume , the hawking temperature ( [ t ] )",
    "can be explored to write down the state equation .",
    "the latter reads as @xmath84 to make contact with the van der waals equation , we should use a series expansion with the inverse of specific volume @xmath85 .",
    "the calculation leads to @xmath86 identify the specific volume @xmath85 with the horizon radius of the black holes as proposed in  @xcite @xmath87 the specific volume @xmath85 can be related to the horizon radius @xmath39 . using  ( [ sv ] ) , one can recover all the results in terms of @xmath85 . in this way , the eq .",
    "( [ pq ] ) becomes @xmath88 to obtain the equal area isobar , @xmath89 , one use the following relations : @xmath90 and @xmath91 the equal area law requires the following equality @xmath92 leading to @xmath93 in the isothermal curves , the points @xmath94 and @xmath95 should satisfy @xmath96 @xmath97 from these equations , one can derive the relations @xmath98 and @xmath99 putting @xmath100,(@xmath101 ) , we get the following relations @xmath102 and @xmath103 and @xmath104 using eqs ( [ a]),([b ] ) and([c ] ) , we get a polynomial equation admitting @xmath105 as a real positive root @xmath106 where the coefficients @xmath107 , @xmath108 and @xmath109 read as @xmath110 solving the above polynomial equation , we get @xmath111 in the limit @xmath112 , one should have @xmath113 . in",
    "what follows , we discuss the convergence of this limit in terms of the topology and the dimension of the space - time .",
    "in fact , three situations can appear .",
    "they are classified as follows :    * in the case of @xmath114 corresponding to flat topology , this limit diverges for any dimensions @xmath11 .",
    "this shows the absence of the critical points .",
    "indeed , this can be seen from the equation of state eq .",
    "( [ states ] ) .",
    "the letter reduces to @xmath115 indicating that no phase transition can happen . * in the case of @xmath116 associated with the hyperbolic topology , a negative value of @xmath105 appears in @xmath2 . for @xmath117 , the limit also diverges .",
    "this implies that there does not exist any phase transition . * in the case of @xmath118 corresponding to the spherical topology , this limit diverges only when @xmath117 . in the case of @xmath2",
