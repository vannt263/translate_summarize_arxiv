    "nowadays , very accurate electron densities can be obtained both experimentally and theoretically .",
    "experimental methods of recovering charge densities require high resolution x - ray diffraction measurements on single crystals which are analysed within the context of aspherical models . from the theoretical point of view , not only crystals but also molecules , clusters and surfaces can be tackled using either quantum chemistry techniques ranging from standard hartree - fock calculations up to extremely accurate configuration interaction methods or techniques based on the density functional theory ( dft ) which are increasingly used to perform ab - initio calculations .",
    "once the total electron density is known , it can be analyzed in details by means of its topological properties within the quantum theory of atoms in molecules ( bader , 1990 ; bader , 1994 ) .",
    "with such an analysis one can go beyond a purely qualitative description of the nature and strength of interatomic interactions .",
    "it can also be used to define interatomic surfaces inside which atomic charges and moments are integrated .",
    "the topological features of the total electron density @xmath1 can be characterized by analyzing its gradient vector field @xmath2 .",
    "critical points ( cps ) are located at points @xmath3 where @xmath4 and the nature of each cp is determined from the curvatures ( @xmath5 , @xmath6 , @xmath7 ) of the density at this point .",
    "the latter are obtained by diagonalyzing the hessian matrix @xmath8 .",
    "the cps are denoted by a pair of integers @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the number of non - zero eigenvalues of the hessian matrix @xmath11 and @xmath12 the sum of the signs of the three eigenvalues . in a three dimensional stable structure ,",
    "four types of cps can be found : @xmath13 peaks corresponding to local maxima of @xmath1 which occur at atomic nuclear positions and in rare cases at so called non - nuclear attractors ; @xmath14 passes , corresponding to saddle points where @xmath1 is maximum in the plane defined by the axes corresponding to the two negative curvatures and minimum in the third direction , such bond critical points are found between pairs of bonded atoms ; @xmath15 pales where @xmath1 is minimum in the plane defined by the axes associated with the two positive curvatures and maximum in the third direction , such ring critical points are found within rings of bonded atoms ; @xmath16 pits corresponding to local minima of @xmath1 .",
    "the numbers of each type of cps obbey the following relationship depending on the nature of the system : @xmath17 or @xmath18 for a crystal or an isolated system respectively .",
    "the laplacian of the electron density @xmath19 which is given by the trace of @xmath11 is related to the kinetic and potential electronic energy densities , respectively g(@xmath20 ) and v(@xmath20 ) , by the local virial theorem , @xmath21    ( atomic units are used throughout the paper ) .",
    "the sign of the laplacian at a given point determines whether the positive kinetic energy or the negative potential energy density is in excess .",

    "a basin is associated to each attractor @xmath13 cp , defined as the region containing all gradient paths terminating at the attractor .",
    "the boundaries of this basin are never crossed by any gradient vector trajectory and satisfy @xmath22 , where @xmath23 is the normal to the surface at point @xmath20 .",
    "the corresponding surface is called the zero flux surface and defines the atomic basin when the attractor corresponds to a nucleus . only in very rare cases non - nuclear attractors",
    "have been evidenced ( madsen et al . , 1999 ) . within this space partionning , the atomic charges deduced by integration over the whole basin are uniquely defined .    during the last twenty years",

    "( iversen et al . , 1995 ) used a maximum entropy density and aray et al .",
    "( aray et al . , 1997 ) sampled a theoretical density on a homogeneous grid .",
    "however , these approaches are limited to the determination of cps . the present analysis of the topological features of total electron densities is independent of the way these densities are obtained and works for periodic or non - periodic systems .",
    "we show in this paper that this can be simply achieved by working with densities given on regular grids in real space .",
    "the developed software integrity uses a tricubic lagrange interpolation which makes the cp search and integration method both accurate and fast .",
    "the densities used to illustrate the performance of our approach are theoretical ab - initio densities obtained with the projector augmented wave ( paw ) method ( blchl , 1994 ) .",
    "the next section of this paper gives a short description of the method .",
    "test compounds and computational details are given in section 3 .",
    "section 4 is devoted to the determination of cps and their characteristics whereas section 5 concerns the determination of atomic basins and charges .",
    "we will discuss the effect of grid spacing of the input density and the plane wave cutoff used for the paw calculations on the properties of different type of interactions ( ionic , covalent and intermolecular ) .",
    "in order to achieve the topological analysis of any experimental or theoretical electron density , the density is given on a regular , not necessarily homogeneous grid in real space .",
    "a grid of stored values of @xmath1 must be prepared , preferably in binary format in order to save disk space and with double precision to ensure high precision .",
    "the grid which is defined by its origin , three meshgrid vectors and the number of points in each grid direction as well as atomic positions must be specified with respect to a cartesian coordinate system .",
    "determinations of the topological properties of @xmath1 requires the knowledge of @xmath1 , @xmath2 and @xmath11 at many arbitrary points .",
    "this can be achieved in an accurate and efficient way by using a tricubic lagrange interpolation ( press et al . , 1992 ) .",
    "in one dimension , it uses values of @xmath24 on two grid points on each side of the current point as illustrated in figure  [ lagrange ] . for a three - dimensional system",
    ", it uses 64 grid points surrounding the box containing the current point :    @xmath25    as the first and second derivatives of this expression are straighforward , the evaluation of @xmath2 and @xmath11 is numerically very cheap .",
    "it is clear that with respect to analytical expressions , the interpolation may introduce errors .",
    "however , as shown in section 4 and 5 these errors are small for reasonable values of the grid interval size , and insignificant when compared to those issued from the multipolar refinement of experimental structure factors .",
    "one should also notice that this interpolation is not suited to perform the topology of @xmath19 from the density .",
    "higher order interpolation would be required or the laplacian has to be supplied on a grid .",
