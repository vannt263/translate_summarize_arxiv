    "molecular hydrogen is the most abundant molecular species in the galactic interstellar medium .",
    "while h@xmath0 is an important constituent of diffuse interstellar clouds with visual extinctions @xmath2 less than about 1 magnitude , it becomes the dominant form of hydrogen in the so - called `` translucent '' clouds , which are characterized by @xmath2 in the range 15 mag .",
    "h@xmath0 dominates the dynamics , chemistry , and physics of denser clouds , and is the basic raw material for star formation .    due to the homonuclear structure of h@xmath0 and its lack of a dipole moment , ro - vibrational transitions within the electronic ground state",
    "are quadrupolar with low spontaneous emission coefficients .",
    "they are therefore very difficult to observe except where special excitation conditions produce detectable ro - vibrational emission in the near - ir ( e.g. gautier et al .  1976 ) or from a space - borne observatory such as iso , when a long enough line of sight ( @xmath2 @xmath9 20 ) allows detection of the mid - ir pure rotational emission from warm diffuse gas ( falgarone et al .",
    "cold h@xmath0 , the dominant form , can be widely observed through electronic transitions in the far uv ( @xmath10 @xmath11 1150  ) , or with difficulty in the ir , where the weak quadrupole transition can be observed in absorption only for very high column densities ( lacy et al .",
    "1994 ) .",
    "previous instruments capable of resolving the far - uv absorption bands of h@xmath0 include the _ copernicus _ mission ( savage et al .",
    "1977 ; spitzer & jenkins 1975 ) , the _ imaps _ experiment ( jenkins & peimbert 1997 ) , and the _ orfeus _ spectrometer ( richter et al .  1998 ; de boer et al .  1998 ) .",
    "all of those , however , were limited to relatively bright stars with @xmath2 @xmath12 1 .",
    "the _ fuse _ observatory ( moos et al .",
    "2000 ) is well suited for observations of cold h@xmath0 in the diffuse and translucent interstellar medium , owing to its high throughput in the wavelength region from 905   to 1187  , encompassing the strong werner and lyman bands of h@xmath0 .",
    "a survey of h@xmath0 in these regions was therefore identified by the _ fuse _ pi team as a project of high priority .",
    "we have assembled a list of 35 lines of sight , which sample a wide variety of interstellar environments .",
    "these lines of sight , with 0.3 mag @xmath12 @xmath13 @xmath12 1.1 mag , are also characterized by a range in extinction properties ( determined both from @xmath14 and from the shape of the far - uv extinction curve ) .",
    "most of the lines of sight have information on molecular abundances from previous optical and/or mm - wave data .    in conjunction with the _ fuse",
    "_ observing program , we and several collaborators are obtaining additional data using various ground - based telescopes .",
    "we have obtained very high - resolution ( r @xmath15 150,000250,000 ) spectra of interstellar , , , and ch absorption along most of the lines of sight to understand the cloud velocity structure ( welty , morton , & snow 2000 ) .",
    "we ( led by dgy ) are obtaining moderately high - resolution ( r @xmath15 50,000 ) , very high s /",
    "n , nearly complete optical spectra to measure many of the diffuse interstellar bands , and the molecules ch , ch@xmath16 , cn , c@xmath0 , and c@xmath17 . t. oka and b. j. mccall are pursuing near - ir measurements of h@xmath17@xmath16 , and we and f. chaffee are conducting near - ir observations to compare grain mantle features such as water ice , the 3.4-@xmath18 m hydrocarbon band , and the silicate feature at 9.6 @xmath18 m , with the uv data on dust extinction and gas - phase depletions",
    ". the ultimate goals of this program are to fully understand the masses of dense interstellar clouds , to probe the chemistry and physics of translucent clouds , and to probe the transition region between diffuse and dense interstellar clouds .    in this _ letter _ , we describe the first observations of h@xmath0 in a translucent cloud line of sight , toward the star hd 73882 .",
    "the following sections describe the properties of the line of sight deduced from previous observations (  2 ) , the _ fuse _ observations and our analysis of the data (  3 ) , and the insights gained from these new data (  4 ) .",
    "the star hd 73882 is well known in the translucent cloud community because it is of early spectral type ( o8.5v ) , it is bright enough ( @xmath19 = 7.27 ) to allow high - s / n observations at optical wavelengths , and it has sufficient foreground dust ( @xmath1 = 0.72 , @xmath2 = 2.44 ) and gas to have large column densities of many atomic and molecular species .",
    "fitzpatrick & massa ( 1986 , 1988 , 1990 ) derived the uv extinction curve and the column density of atomic hydrogen from low - resolution _ iue _ spectra .",
    "the extinction curve shows a steep far - uv rise with significant curvature , generally similar to other `` dense cloud '' curves , as characterized by cardelli , clayton , & mathis ( 1988 )  a conclusion reached previously for this star by massa , savage , & fitzpatrick ( 1983 ) .",
    "however , both the ratio of total to selective extinction ( @xmath14 = 3.9 ) and the wavelength of maximum polarization ( serkowski , mathewson , & ford 1975 ) suggest that small grains are not as important in this case as in most other molecular - cloud lines of sight .",
    "the molecular column densities listed in table 1 support the view that this line of sight is dominated by one or more dense clouds , consistent with translucent cloud models ( e.g. van dishoeck & black 1986 ) .",
    "a series of papers have provided ground - based data on co , ch , cn , ch@xmath20 , and c@xmath0 ( van dishoeck et al .",
    "1991 ; gredel et al .  1993",
    "; see table 1 ) .",
    "the co emission line profiles reveal three distinct components toward hd 73882 , at lsr velocities of + 5.9 , + 8.9 , and + 11.2 km s@xmath21 .",
    "the absorption from the other molecular species , however , is seen only in a single component near + 4.5 km s@xmath21 . using the 3.6-m reflector and coud echelle spectrometer at eso and the 0.9-m coud feed telescope and coud spectrograph at kpno",
    ", we have obtained very high - resolution ( @xmath22 @xmath15 150,000250,000 ) spectra of , , and absorption toward hd 73882 .",
    "a profile - fitting analysis of the and lines reveals no fewer than 20 velocity components , spread over 55 km s@xmath21 .",
    "however , the absorption is dominated by three narrow ( @xmath23 @xmath15 0.7 km s@xmath21 ) , blended components at @xmath24 @xmath9 + 2.7 , + 4.3 , and + 5.9 km s@xmath21 , with significant contributions from two others at + 7.7 and + 11.0 km s@xmath21 .",
    "the blend centered at + 4.3 km s@xmath21 probably corresponds to the single ( unresolved at @xmath22 @xmath15 60,000100,000 ) absorption component seen in ch , cn , ch@xmath16 , and c@xmath0 , and to the co emission component at + 5.9 km s@xmath21 .",
    "the two slightly weaker atomic components may correspond to the two other co components at + 8.9 and + 11.2 km s@xmath21 .",
    "( note that the co column density quoted in table 1 is only for the + 5.9 km s@xmath21 component . )",
    "the numerous weaker features seen in the optical data may arise in outlying less dense clouds .",
    "our _ fuse _ spectrum of hd 73882 is derived from time - tagged observations over the course of 8 orbits on 1999 oct 30 .",
    "several `` burst '' events occurred during the observation ( sahnow et al .",
    "we excluded all photon events that occurred during the bursts , reducing effective on - target integration time from 16.8 ksec to 16.1 ksec .",
    "strong interstellar extinction and lack of co - alignment of the sic channels with the lif channels prevented the collection of useful data shortward of 1010  .",
    "we performed a simple `` collapse '' of the 2-dimensional spectral image to a 1-dimensional spectrum , summing 100 pixels ( lif 1a segment ) or 120 pixels ( lif 2a ) in each column , and we determined the background level in a similar way .",
    "this extraction compares favorably to a subsequent pipeline processed spectrum . in the regions of interest",
    ", we obtained a maximum s / n of 20 per 15-pixel resolution element in the lif 1a segment , and 30 in lif 2a .",
    "the wavelength solution was derived from narrow lines in the diffuse cloud line of sight to lmc star sk@xmath2567 111 ( shull et al .",
    "some residual scatter remained in the wavelength solution ( @xmath26 @xmath9 6 km s@xmath21 ) , precluding a detailed analysis of line velocities in this study .",
    "figure 1 depicts a portion of our spectrum , along with our model of the h@xmath0 lines described in the following paragraph .",
    "the column densities for the @xmath6 = 0 and @xmath6 = 1 levels come from direct fits to the profiles of the corresponding heavily damped lines .",
    "the resolution of the _ fuse _ spectra ( r @xmath15 12,000 ) is not sufficient to separate the narrow , closely spaced components contributing to the interstellar line profiles of the high-@xmath6 lines . in view of the generally good correlation between the column densities of and h@xmath0 ( federman 1981 ; welty & hobbs 2000 ) for n(na i ) @xmath27 10@xmath28 @xmath5",
    ", we have used the five strongest components described in  2 to model the h@xmath0 lines .",
    "the velocity structure for was preserved for h@xmath0 , and the observed @xmath23-values for the components were scaled to h@xmath0 by the relation @xmath29 given the relatively narrow range of column densities , we have assumed a one - to - one scaling between and h@xmath0 .",
    "the predicted h@xmath0 component structure is given in table 2 . from this structure",
    "we calculated a curve of growth and determined the column densities for @xmath30 2 using 29 h@xmath0 lines .",
    "this curve of growth ( similar to a single component with @xmath23 = 3 km s@xmath21 ) is given in figure 2 , while the column densities are given in table 3 .",
    "the data in tables 2 and 3 were used to calculate the model of the h@xmath0 spectrum given in figure 1 .    lying on or near the saturation portion of the curve of growth , the column densities for @xmath6 @xmath8 4 are highly sensitive to the assumed component structure . if more than five components trace significant amounts of h@xmath0 , the larger `` effective '' @xmath23-value yields column densities for @xmath6 = 4 and @xmath6 = 5 decreased by an order of magnitude or more .",
    "similarly , if the h@xmath0 structure is less complex than we have assumed or if components 4 and 5 trace less h@xmath0 ( as suggested by the ch data of gredel et al .",
    "1993 ) , the opposite situation occurs .",
    "the @xmath6 = 5 lines would be shifted @xmath150.5 dex to the damping portion of the curve of growth , and the column densities for the @xmath6 = 6 and @xmath6 = 7 lines could be increased by @xmath150.5 dex or more .",
    "the total h@xmath0 column density of 1.2 @xmath3 10@xmath4 @xmath5 we have measured toward hd 73882 is statistically identical to the largest previously observed via far - uv absorption spectroscopy , 1.1 @xmath3 10@xmath4 @xmath5 toward hd 24534 ( mason , et al .",
    "the molecular fraction @xmath31 = 2n(h@xmath0)/[2n(h@xmath0 ) + n(h i ) ] is @xmath31 = 0.65 , nearly identical to that found toward zeta oph ( @xmath31 = 0.63 ; bohlin , et al .  1978 ) . the only known larger value , @xmath31 = 0.80 , toward hd 24534 ( snow et al .  1998",
    ") , will be redetermined via a planned _ fuse _ observation .",
    "the abundances of co , cn , ch , and c@xmath0 , relative to the total hydrogen abundance , are more similar to those found in diffuse clouds ( i.e. toward zeta oph ) than in dark clouds .",
    "because these molecular abundances represent only a small fraction of the presumed total carbon abundance , we conclude that the clouds toward hd 73882 have not reached the predicted transition point where carbon becomes primarily molecular ( e.g. van dishoeck & black 1986 ) .",
    "the limited data presently available also suggest that the depletions toward hd 73882 are similar to those found in cold diffuse clouds , an issue we will explore in more detail in a future paper ( rachford et al .",
    "2000 ) .    in principle , the co abundance can be derived from our _ fuse _ spectrum . however , the best candidate lines , from the c  x ( 0,0 ) band at 1088  , lie on the flat portion of the curve of growth where the derived abundance is highly sensitive to the chosen @xmath23-value .    our derived h@xmath0 column density , combined with the line - of - sight extinction properties cited above ,",
    "show that the ratio of hydrogen , both molecular and total , to dust extinction , is also similar to the value found for diffuse clouds ( bohlin et al .",
    "1978 ) .",
    "the ratio of molecules in @xmath6 = 1 to @xmath6 = 0 ( ortho- to para - hydrogen ) is usually interpreted as a measure of the gas kinetic temperature , because in these clouds the collisional timescale for depopulating these levels is shorter than the radiative timescale .",
    "our n(1)/n(0 ) ratio yields @xmath32 k , consistent with the average value @xmath33 k found for diffuse clouds with _",
    "copernicus _ data ( savage et al .  1977 ) .",
    "shull et al .",
    "( 2000 ) find a somewhat larger value in a small sample of _ fuse _ data .",
    "the excitation diagram in figure 3 shows that the levels @xmath34 in this line of sight are not in thermal equilibrium at @xmath35 , but instead follow a different distribution characterized by an excitation temperature , @xmath36 k. non - thermal excitation of the high-@xmath6 levels has been explained in terms of uv pumping , in which the molecules cascade down through upper rotational and vibrational lines following the absorption of a uv photon ( black & delgarno 1973 ) . in this case , the excited h@xmath0 may arise in the outer , optically thin regions of the cloud , rather than in the self - shielded interior .",
    "if so , the high-@xmath6 lines may exhibit small velocity shifts or enhanced @xmath23-values .",
    "however , the limited spectral resolution and uncertain wavelength scale of our _ fuse _ data precludes a sensitive search for these effects .",
    "it is noteworthy that even in a line of sight thought to be dominated by molecular cloud material within a single cloud complex , the velocity structure is very complicated .",
    "this structure , along with the similarities between the current results and previous results for diffuse clouds , suggests the possibility that we looking through several zeta oph - type clouds rather than a single very dense cloud .",
    "our analysis of the excited rotational levels of h@xmath0 depends heavily on high - resolution ground - based optical absorption and mm - wave emission line data to which we had access .",
    "it is thus imperative for future _ fuse _ interstellar - line observations to obtain appropriate high - resolution spectra in order to have any hope of unambiguous interpretation of the lower resolution data .",
    "we thank the referee , j. h. black , for helpful comments .",
