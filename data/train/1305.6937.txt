    "experiments in optical lattices have enhanced the interest in the nonequilibrium dynamics of isolated quantum systems @xcite .",
    "new life has been brought , for example , to the old pursuit of deriving thermodynamics from first principles .",
    "one of the main questions in this context refers to the conditions for an isolated quantum system initially far from equilibrium to reach thermal equilibrium .",
    "how decisive are regimes , initial states , and observables ?",
    "what is universal ?",
    "a general picture has been developed associating chaos with the onset of thermalization  @xcite , but several examples have been promoted as violations of this picture .",
    "cases have been presented of chaotic hamiltonians where thermalization was not observed for certain initial states  @xcite and of integrable systems where thermalization appeared to be reached  @xcite .",
    "it is important to emphasize that the mere appearance of signatures of chaos associated with the bulk of eigenvalues , such as level repulsion or rigidity  @xcite , is not sufficient for the onset of thermalization for any initial state .",
    "real systems have few - body and usually short - range interactions .",
    "contrary to full random matrices , their density of states has a gaussian shape  @xcite and their delocalized eigenstates are restricted to a region close to the middle of the spectrum  @xcite .",
    "if the initial state has energy close to the edges of the spectrum , the main contributions to its evolution may come from localized eigenstates , and thermalization may not occur .    in full random matrices ,",
    "the eigenstates are completely extended pseudo - random vectors . in real chaotic systems , even in the middle of the spectrum , the eigenstates are limited by the energy shell and their components may show correlations  @xcite . yet ,",
    "if the initial state is close to the middle of the spectrum , thermalization is expected to happen .",
    "thermalization requires a substantial sampling of delocalized eigenstates , but the latter do not need to be completely extended .",
    "it is then natural to presume that thermalization could happen also for integrable hamiltonians with delocalized eigenstates , provided the initial state be nearly chaotic .",
    "the reasoning above shows a change in perspective with respect to the condition for thermalization , putting emphasis also on the initial state rather than on the regime of the hamiltonian only . in the case of an integrable system",
    ", it was shown that the quasi - particle number operator behaves thermally for a thermal ( mixed ) initial state at sufficiently high temperature  @xcite .",
    "subsequently , it was argued that this would hold only for infinite temperature  @xcite . for a pure initial state corresponding to an eigenstate of an arbitrary hamiltonian",
    ", it was supported that thermalization could happen if this hamiltonian was chaotic  @xcite , but not if it was integrable  @xcite .",
    "notice , however , that the initial states considered in @xcite were not very close to the middle of the spectrum .",
    "as we stress in this work , an important factor for thermalization is the structure of the initial state with respect to the hamiltonian that evolves it .",
    "thermalization is assured for any initial state that fills the energy shell ergodically . in this case",
    "its coefficients become uncorrelated random variables following a gaussian distribution  @xcite .",
    "any eigenstate from a full random matrix projected on the energy eigenbasis of a delocalized system falls in this category .",
    "in fact , such states are similar to thermal states at infinite temperature  @xcite .",
    "the main question is then how close to such scenario of random vectors does an initial state need to be for the viability of thermalization .",
    "we explore this idea in the context of quenches .",
    "the system is initially in an eigenstate of an initial hamiltonian .",
    "a parameter is instantaneously changed , which leads to a different final hamiltonian and starts the system evolution .",
    "four quenches are considered : from an integrable to a chaotic hamiltonian and vice versa , and from an integrable interacting hamiltonian ( nonmappable to a noninteracting model ) to an integrable noninteracting hamiltonian and vice versa .",
    "we analyze how the structure of the initial state changes as it approaches the middle of the spectrum of the final hamiltonian . in finite systems with few - body interactions ,",
    "this state will never be completely extended , not even when one of the hamiltonians involved in the quench is chaotic .",
    "we study how close to the center of the spectrum one needs to go for nearly chaotic initial states to emerge and if any of the quenches precludes their existence .",
    "the system considered is a one - dimensional lattice of spins-1/2 .",
    "for each quench , we examine initial states with energies ranging from very close to the ground state to very close to the middle of the spectrum . as the initial state approaches the center of the spectrum ,",
    "the results for the observables get less dependent on position and momentum . independently of the hamiltonian , the results move toward those from thermal averages , although not so clearly for all observables . whether this picture will hold in the thermodynamic limit requires scaling analysis , which is currently unfeasible for systems with interactions , where only small system sizes are available .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "section [ sec : therm ] discusses the conditions for thermalization in isolated quantum systems . in sec .",
    "[ sec : shell ] , we introduce the concept of energy shell as employed here and how to quantify the level of delocalization of the initial state .",

    "[ sec : summary ] .",
    "the unitary time evolution of an isolated quantum system out of equilibrium is given by @xmath2 is set to 1 .",
    "the initial state @xmath3 is as an eigenstate of an initial hamiltonian @xmath4 .",
    "the dynamics is caused by the sudden change ( quench ) of some parameter(s ) of this hamiltonian in a time interval much shorter than any characteristic time scale of the model .",
    "this results in the final hamiltonian @xmath5 with eigenvalues @xmath6 and eigenstates @xmath7 .",
    "the coefficients @xmath8 are the overlaps of the initial state with the eigenstates of @xmath5 .",
    "the dynamics of the expectation value of an observable @xmath9 is computed as @xmath10 where @xmath11 corresponds to the matrix elements of @xmath9 in the energy eigenbasis . in the absence of too many degeneracies , @xmath12 for most states , the off - diagonal elements of @xmath13",
    "oscillate very fast and cancel out on average , so the infinite time average is given by @xmath14 since the steady state average depends only on the diagonal elements of @xmath9 , it is commonly referred to as the prediction from the diagonal ensemble ( de ) @xcite .",
    "thermalization implies that the expectation value of the observable is close to the thermal average most of the time .",
    "this holds under two essential conditions :    \\(1 ) the fluctuations of @xmath13 about the infinite time average are small and vanish in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "we can then talk about equilibration in a probabilistic sense .",
    "the rate of decay of these fluctuations with system size depends on the system investigated  @xcite .",
    "the important fact for us here is that for the models we study the temporal fluctuations are indeed small and should vanish for very large systems  @xcite .",
    "\\(2 ) the infinite time average and the thermal average are very close in finite systems and eventually coincide in the thermodynamic limit , @xmath15 above , @xmath16 is the average obtained with the microcanonical ensemble , which is the appropriate ensemble when dealing with isolated systems .",
    "@xmath17 is the mean energy of the initial state and @xmath18 stands for the number of energy eigenstates in the window @xmath19 .",
    "this window is sufficiently small compared with the energy spectrum , but large enough to contain many energy states .",
    "the de depends on the initial state via the components @xmath20 , while the me depends only on the energy . for initial states narrow in energy  @xcite",
    ", two scenarios may lead to the proximity between the two ensembles :    \\(1 ) the eigenstate expectation value of the observable , @xmath21 , is a smooth function of energy .",
    "when the values of @xmath21 do not fluctuate for states close in energy , the result from a single eigenstate inside the microcanonical window agrees with the microcanonical average .",
    "this is the point of view of the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis ( eth ) @xcite , which certainly holds when the eigenstates of the system are random vectors .",
    "computing @xmath21 with one or another random state leads to very similar results .",
    "however , for realistic chaotic systems , one needs to be careful with the region of the spectrum that is considered . as mentioned before ,",
    "nearly chaotic eigenstates are not ubiquitous to chaotic systems with few - body interactions .",
    "they are found away from the edges of the spectrum and the exact region of their predominance depends on the strength of the interaction .",
    "\\(2 ) the coefficients @xmath22 s behave as random variables .",
    "this happens when the initial state fills the shell .",
    "the fluctuations of the coefficients become uncorrelated with possible fluctuations of @xmath21 . in eq .",
    "( [ eq : diagonal ] ) , we can then deal with the average of @xmath20 @xcite .",
    "if the energy shell is filled and eth is satisfied through a chaotic @xmath1 , it is hard to identify which of the two conditions is the main condition for thermalization .",
    "however , if @xmath1 is integrable , then it is certainly the filling of the shell [ condition ( 2 ) ] that allows for thermalization .",
    "the notion of energy shell is often used in quantum chaos . the usual procedure in the field is to separate the total hamiltonian in an unperturbed part , which describes the noninteracting particles ( or quasi - particles ) , and a perturbation , which represents the inter-(quasi-)particle interactions and may drive the system into the chaotic domain .",
    "the hamiltonian matrix is written in the basis corresponding to the unperturbed vectors , which constitute the mean - field basis .    a mean - field basis vector @xmath23 projected on the eigenstates @xmath24 of the total hamiltonian",
    "is written as @xmath25 the smoothened distribution of the components @xmath26 in the eigenvalues @xmath27 is known as the strength function or local density of states  @xcite .",
    "the energy shell corresponds to the maximal strength function obtained in the limit of a very strong perturbation , that is when the mean - field part can be neglected in comparison with the perturbed part .",
    "the energy shell has a gaussian shape in the center of the spectrum and delimits the maximum possible spreading of the mean - field basis vectors in @xmath27 , as well as the maximum level of delocalization of @xmath24 in the energies of the mean - field basis vectors .",
    "away from the middle of the spectrum , the distribution of @xmath26 in @xmath27 becomes skewed to the left ( right ) when @xmath28 has low ( high ) energy  @xcite .",
    "the level of delocalization of the states increases with the perturbation , but they do not become totally extended as the eigenstates of full random matrices .",
    "when dealing with realistic systems of few - body interactions , a completely chaotic state is defined as a state that fills the energy shell  @xcite .",
    "we bring the concept of chaotic states in connection with the energy shell to our studies of quantum many - body systems after a quench .",
    "the unperturbed part of the hamiltonian now coincides with @xmath0 , and the total hamiltonian is @xmath1 .",
    "the latter is written in the basis corresponding to the eigenstates of the initial hamiltonian .",
    "the maximum possible spreading of an initial state with energy in the middle of the spectrum is given by a gaussian centered at @xmath29 and of variance @xmath30 the variance of the energy shell corresponds to the energy distribution of the initial state .",
    "it depends only on the sum of the square of the off - diagonal elements of the final hamiltonian  @xcite .",
    "the values of @xmath17 and @xmath31 are straightforward to obtain when @xmath0 is already in a diagonal form or trivially solved  @xcite .      to quantify the level of delocalization of the initial state we use the inverse participation ratio , @xmath32",
    "if the initial state is an eigenstate of a full random matrix , it is maximally delocalized .",
    "if the matrix comes from a gaussian orthogonal ensemble ( goe ) @xcite , its projection on the eigenstates of the systems we study here is again a goe - type of vector , with probability amplitudes from a normal distribution . in this case , @xmath33 @xcite , where @xmath34 is the dimension of the hamiltonian matrix .",
    "if the eigenstate comes from a gaussian unitary ensemble ( gue ) , the projection is again a gue - vector and , as we verified , @xmath35 .",
    "both states fill the energy shell ergodically .",
    "it has been shown that a state corresponding to a random superposition of ising states manifests thermal features .",
    "specifically , the results for local observables led to the same outcomes obtained with a mixed state at infinite temperature  @xcite .",
    "the state is constructed so that the probability amplitudes of the basis vectors have all the same absolute value , @xmath36 , but differ by a random phase @xmath37 , where @xmath38 is a uniformly distributed random variable in @xmath39 .",
    "we have checked that the projection of such a state onto the eigenstates of our spin-1/2 hamiltonians leads to vectors very similar to gue eigenstates , with @xmath35 .",
    "we therefore infer that an initial state with @xmath22 randomly distributed , as the coefficients of eigenstates from full random matrices , have properties similar to those of thermal states at infinite temperature .",
    "this is expected , since on average @xmath20 equals @xmath40 .",
    "we have indeed confirmed that , for the observables studied here , when the initial state is an eigenstate from a goe , @xmath41 where @xmath42 indicates the result for a thermal state @xmath43 at infinite temperature , @xmath44 .",
    "the initial states considered in this paper come from hamiltonians which , as those from goe s , are real and symmetric .",
    "but since our @xmath0 and @xmath1 have only two - body interactions , none of our initial states can reach maximum delocalization with @xmath33 .",
    "this does not discard , however , the possibility of having infinite time averages approaching microcanonical averages .",
    "we consider a one - dimensional system with open boundary conditions composed of @xmath45 coupled spins-1/2 and described by the hamiltonian , @xmath46 where @xmath47 above , @xmath48 are spin operators acting on site @xmath49 .",
    "@xmath50 indicates the presence of a defect on the first site of the chain .",
    "it is generated by applying a magnetic field in the @xmath51-direction , which is slightly larger than the magnetic field on the other sites .",
    "the coupling between nearest neighbors ( nn ) is given by @xmath52 , which contains the flip - flop term @xmath53 and the ising interaction @xmath54 .",
    "@xmath55 describes the coupling between next - nearest neighbors ( nnn ) .",
    "@xmath56 is the anisotropy parameter and @xmath57 refers to the ratio between nnn and nn exchange , and both are assumed positive .",
    "the exchange coupling constant @xmath58 determines the energy scale and is set to 1 .",
    "when both parameters @xmath56 and @xmath57 are simultaneously equal to zero , @xmath59 describes the xx model and can be mapped onto a system of noninteracting spinless fermions , being trivially solvable  @xcite .",
    "when @xmath60 and @xmath61 , we have the xxz model , which is still integrable but now solved by means of the bethe ansatz  @xcite .",
    "when @xmath62 the system is nonintegrable and may become chaotic  @xcite .",
    "notice that we refer here to the xx and the xxz hamiltonian when only nn couplings are present , so both cases correspond to integrable models .",
    "the purpose of the small defect on the first site of the chain is to break trivial symmetries , such as parity , conservation of total spin , and spin reversal  @xcite , without breaking the integrability of the system  @xcite .",
    "we fix @xmath63 .",

    "four quenches are investigated .",
    "two of them involve only integrable hamiltonians @xmath68 , @xmath56 being the parameter changed :    * @xmath69 : from the xx model ( noninteracting hamiltonian ) to the xxz model ( interacting hamiltonian ) .",
    "* @xmath70 : from the xxz model ( interacting hamiltonian ) to the xx model ( noninteracting hamiltonian ) .",

    "notice that for the quenches above , the perturbation is strong , as shown in refs",
    ".  @xcite .",
    "as the perturbation increases from zero , the shape of the initial state ( that is , the distribution of the components @xmath26 in @xmath27 ) expands from a delta function to a breit - wigner ( lorentzian ) form and eventually becomes a gaussian function as determined by the energy shell . in this paper , we are already in the limit where a gaussian shape is expected .",
    "we analyze a broad range of initial states with energies covering the lower half of the spectrum of the final hamiltonian .",
    "they correspond to eigenstates of @xmath0 and are selected according to the value of their energy with respect to @xmath1 , from very close to the ground state to very close to the middle of the spectrum .",

    "as the initial state further spreads out with temperature , the results for the observables become smoother and the infinite time averages ( diagonal ensemble ) approach the thermal averages ( microcanonical ensemble ) .",
    "this behavior is more evident when one of the hamiltonians of the quench is chaotic . in the presence of one chaotic hamiltonian ,",
    "the approach of the two ensembles as system size increases is also more perceptible .",
    "scaling analyses are crucial to resolving whether thermalization can indeed occur for the four quenches studied here .",
    "when comparing @xmath15612 , 15 , and 18 , we see that the filling of the energy shell improves for all quenches , this being more significant when the final hamiltonian is interacting .",
    "such spreading of the initial state with respect to the shell suggests that the diagonal ensemble should indeed approach the thermodynamic ensemble as @xmath45 increases , because filling of the shell implies an unbiased sampling of the energy eigenstates . nevertheless , larger system sizes and detailed scaling analysis for the observables are necessary to make this statement definitive .",
    "another essential aspect for future studies is the specification of the threshold in temperature above which thermalization holds and how it depends on the model and system size . if thermalization can occur only for initial states too close to the middle of the spectrum , the temperatures involved are unrealistically large and not of practical use",
