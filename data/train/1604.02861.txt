    "the exciton is one of the most important elementary excitations in condensed matter .",

    "this is particularly true for systems with high dielectric constants , in which the effective - mass approximation may be valid @xcite .",
    "it is believed that exciton observation in metals is quite difficult , because free carriers immediately screen the holes created by photon absorption .",
    "recently , however , cui et al . have reported that excitons exist in metals in the form of _ transient _ excitons , based on findings obtained through the application of multi - photon photoemission spectroscopy to a silver surface @xcite .",
    "the transient excitonic state that does not correspond to anything in the single - particle band structure develops into an image potential state within 100 fs , which is quite short compared to the exciton lifetime in typical insulators .",
    "the findings of this experiment pose the question of how to define the existence of an exciton within a short time scale , and move the field in the direction of developing an understanding of excitons in both space and time .",
    "the screening effect is significant as regards exciton existence .",
    "after the creation of the photohole , the coulomb potential between the electrons and holes is gradually weakened over time @xcite . since screening is incomplete in an insulator , the coulomb potential approaches an approximate ratio of the bare coulomb potential and the dielectric constant , which causes long - lived excitons to appear . on the other hand , the screening in a metal is complete .",
    "the coulomb potential approaches the well - known tomas - fermi potential , which generates no bound states in general @xcite .",

    "however , the present method of solving the bse can be applied to a system under a stationary interaction potential only .",
    "thus , to understand the kinetics of the exciton , it is highly desirable to develop a theory that passes beyond both the effective - mass approximation and the use of a stationary interaction potential in the bse . note that , although attaccalite et al . have derived an equation of motion for the non - equilibrium green s function that may be regarded as a time - dependent bse @xcite , the application of this theory has been limited to the calculation of the optical absorption spectra in finite systems and wide - gap semiconductors .    in this paper ,",
