    "several groups have carried out gravitational microlensing observations toward dense stellar fields , such as the magellanic clouds , the galactic center and disc . until now , hundreds of events have been found ( eros : @xcite ; ogle : @xcite ; @xcite ; macho : @xcite ; moa : @xcite ) , and thousands are expected in the upcoming years by moa , ogle - iii and other collaborations .",
    "it is well known that the gravitational microlensing survey data is well suited for numerous other scientific projects ( see @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the studies of the galactic structure certainly benefit from this type of data .",
    "the microlensing optical depth probes the mass density of compact objects along the line of sight and the event time - scale distribution is related to the mass function and kinematics of the lensing objects . observed high optical depth may be explained by the presence of the bar ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "there is substantial evidence that the galaxy has a bar at its center ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) . however , the parameters of the bar , e.g. , its mass , size , and the motion of stars within it , still remain poorly constrained .",
    "@xcite used the red clump giants ( rcgs ) to constrain the axial ratios and orientation of the galactic bar .",
    "these stars are the equivalent of the horizontal branch stars for a metal - rich population , i.e. , relatively low - mass core helium burning stars .",
    "rcgs in the galactic bulge occupy a distinct region in the colour magnitude diagram ( @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "the intrinsic width of the luminosity distribution of rcgs in the galactic bulge is small , about 0.2 mag ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "their observed peak and width of the luminosity function are related to the distance and radial depth of the bar .",
    "furthermore , @xcite suggested that the proper motion measurements of rcgs in the galactic center are useful in constraining the galactic bar parameters . by considering a sub - sample of bright rcgs , one should be able to isolate to a sufficient degree the stars that are on average closer to the near side of the bar .",
    "similarly , the stars in a faint sub - sample would be more on the far side of the bar .",
    "if there is a tangential streaming motion of 100 kms@xmath1 in the bulge / bar , there should be a detectable difference of 1.6 masyr@xmath1 in the average proper motion between the bright and faint rcg sub - samples .",
    "measurements of this difference provide constraints on the models of the galactic bar .    to test the feasibility of the method , in this paper we analyze stellar proper motions in one of the fields observed by the optical gravitational experiment ii ( ogle - ii ; @xcite ) . in ",
    "[ sec : data ] we describe the data .",
    "we present the analysis method in  [ sec : analysis ] and results in  [ sec : results ] .",
    "discussion and conclusion are given in ",
    "[ sec : disc ] .",
    "we use the data collected during the second phase of the ogle experiment , between 1997 and 2000 .",
    "all observations were made with the 1.3-m warsaw telescope located at the las campanas observatory , chile , which is operated by the carnegie institution of washington .",
    "the `` first generation '' camera has a site 2048 @xmath7 2048 pixel ccd detector with pixel size of 24 @xmath8 m resulting in 0.417 arcsec / pixel scale .",
    "images of the galactic bulge were taken in drift - scan mode at `` medium '' readout speed with the gain 7.1 @xmath9/adu and readout noise of 6.3 @xmath9 .",
    "a single 2048 @xmath7 8192 pixel frame covers an area of 0.24 @xmath7 0.95 deg@xmath10 .",
    "saturation level is about 55,000 adu .",
    "details of the instrumentation setup can be seen in @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we use 266 @xmath11-band frames of the bul_sc1 field centered at ( @xmath12 . the time baseline is almost 4 years",
    ". there are gaps between the observing seasons when the galactic bulge can not be observed from las campanas , each about 3 months long .",
    "the median seeing is @xmath13 .",
    "we use the @xmath14 photometric maps of standard ogle template ( @xcite ) as the astrometric and photometric references .",
    "only about 70% of the area of the bul_sc1 field overlaps with the extinction map made by @xcite and is used in the analysis .",
    "this ensures that we can accurately deredden stellar magnitudes .",
    "the standard ogle template serves as the fixed astrometric reference in our analysis . in the case of bul_sc1 field ,",
    "the frame adopted as the ogle template was taken at jd = 2450561.715 . in order to treat properly spatial psf variations and frame distortions the field",
    "is divided into 256 subframes before processing .",
    "subframes are 512@xmath7128 pixels with 14 pixel margin on each side to smooth out transitions between the local polynomial fits .",
    "the shape of the subframe reflects stronger y - axis ( declination ) gradients due to drift - scan mode of observation .",
    "the actual proper motion analysis includes only 180 subframes , that is 70% of the area of the bul_sc1 field for which the accurate interstellar extinction data is available from @xcite .",
    "we compute the pixel positions of stars in each of the subframes using the dophot package ( @xcite ) . at the start of the processing for each exposure ,",
    "the positions of stars in a single subframe are cross - referenced with those in the template and the overall frame shift is obtained . using this crude shift",
    "we can identify the same region of the sky ( corresponding to a given subframe of the template ) throughout the entire sequence of frames .",
    "for each of the subframes , about @xmath15 brightest ( @xmath16 ) stars categorized by dophot as isolated are used to derive the local transformation between pixel coordinate systems of a given exposure and the template .",
    "the search radius in matching the stars between templete and other frames is 0.5 pixel .",
    "we use first order polynomial to fit the transformation .",
    "the resulting piece - wise transformation adequately converts pixel positions to the reference frame of the template .",
    "typical residuals are at the level of @xmath17 pixels .",
    "an example of time dependence of the position for a star with the detectable proper motion is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : shiftcurve ] . also presented is the best fit model of proper motion @xmath18 with and without the differential refraction .",
    "the star s coordinates in the sky at the time @xmath19 are given as follows :    @xmath20    @xmath21    where @xmath22 , @xmath23 and @xmath24 are the differential refraction coefficient , the zenith angle and the angle made by the zenith , the star and the south pole ; @xmath25 and @xmath26 are constants . the parameter @xmath22 is a function of the apparent star colour .",
    "here we neglect the parallax effect due to the earth motion because we are interested in stars at the distance of the galactic center .",
    "we computed @xmath25 , @xmath26 , @xmath27 , @xmath28 and @xmath22 for all 46,961 stars used to transform coordinate systems ( approximately the number of used subframes times the typical number of stars per subframe , 180 @xmath7 300 ) . in cases when the star is measured in the overlap region of more than one subframe , the data set with the largest number of points is selected .",
    "stars with the number of data points fewer than 20 are rejected .",
    "a sample of fitted proper motions is listed in table [ tbl : list ] .",
    "the complete list of all 46,961 stars is available in electric format via anonymous ftp from the server _",
    "astro.princeton.edu_ , directory _ /sumi",
    "/ propermotion / bul_sc1.pm.gz_. the list contains star i d , number of data points , measured @xmath27 and @xmath28 with their errors , @xmath22 , standard deviation ( sdev ) of data points in the fitting , equatorial coordinates , apparent @xmath11-band magnitude and @xmath29 colour , and extinction corrected magnitude @xmath30 and colour @xmath31 estimated using the extinction map of @xcite .",
    "i d , coordinates , @xmath11 and @xmath29 for each object are identical with those in @xcite .    [ cols=\"<,^,>,^,>,^,>,>,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     both rg samples have same proper motion and values of @xmath32 are about a mid between the those of bright and faint rcgs .",
    "this can be explained by that rgs are on average at the center of the bar .",
    "the disc stars seem to be moving toward positive @xmath33 with @xmath34 masyr@xmath1 with respect to rgs , i.e. , the galactic center .",
    "this is roughly consistent with @xmath35 masyr@xmath1 estimated assuming that disc stars are on average on the @xmath36 kpc from the sun and the flat rotation curve of @xmath37 kms@xmath1 .",
    "here we also assumed that the sun has an additional velocity of 19 kms@xmath1 toward ( @xmath38 ) relative to the local standard of rest ( rsl ) ( @xcite ) , i.e. , @xmath39= ( 12 kms@xmath1 , 7 kms@xmath1 ) .",
    "as for the disc stars , their distance may be estimated from their apparent brightness .",
    "they are typically at the main sequence turn - off point for an old population , so very crudely they have absolute magnitude @xmath40 or so .",
    "the bright dss are at about @xmath30 = 14 mag , the faint are at about @xmath30 = 15.5 mag .",
    "so , their distance moduli are approximately 10 mag and 11.5 mag , which corresponds to the distance from us : 1 kpc and 2 kpc , respectively . for the faint dss , slightly larger proper motion with respect to rgs",
    "is expected than the measured one .",
    "this difference might be due to the difference in rotation curve along the line of sight .",
    "the values @xmath41 ( bright dss ) or @xmath42 ( faint dss ) might be explained by the solar motion @xmath39 relative to lsr .",
    "a detailed analysis of these results is beyond the scope of this pilot study .",
    "we have measured the proper motion for 46,961 stars in the ogle - ii bul_sc1 field covering baade s window .",
    "we dramatically increased the number of objects with large proper motions in this field compared to @xcite who detected 53 high proper motion objects in the same region of the galactic bulge .",
    "we have estimated the difference in the proper motion between the bright ( near - side ) and the faint ( far - side ) samples of rcgs .",
    "we found that the far - side rcgs have a proper motion of @xmath43 masyr@xmath1 toward the negative @xmath33 relative to the near - side rcgs .",
    "the results fit the picture with stars in the bar rotating around the galactic center in the same direction as the sun .",
    "the value @xmath44 1.5 masyr@xmath1 is consistent with 1.6 masyr@xmath1 estimated by @xcite who assumed a streaming motion of the bar at @xmath3 @xmath45 .",
    "the presented method used with the ogle - ii data is sensitive to the relative streaming motion of stars in the galactic bar down to about @xmath46 masyr@xmath1 .",
    "as discussed in the previous section , the measured proper motions of ds and rg samples seem consistent with the basic understanding of stellar motions in the galaxy , and the solar motion relative to lsr in particular .",
    "this consistency supports the reliability of our analysis .",
    "the question of possible contamination by stars in the galactic disc bears some discussion as we select the samples of rcgs using the cmd . only nearby disc main - sequence stars , or evolved disc stars are expected to fall in the same cmd region as our rcg samples .",
    "the effect can be considered negligible because these stars are not very numerous ( @xcite ) .",
    "one should keep in mind that all measurements of @xmath47 presented here are not absolute , but relative to the astrometric reference frame which is not well known .",
    "this problem can be solved by using background quasars that would be detected in the near future using the ogle - ii variability catalog ( @xcite ) .",
    "the primary goal of this paper is to demonstrate that proper motions can be measured with very high precision using the ogle - ii data , sufficiently high to clearly detect the presence of a strong streaming motion ( rotation ) of stars in the galactic bar .",
    "while the reference frame established by the large number of stars is not well defined with respect to the inertial frame of reference , the relative motions of groups of stars are well determined .",
    "a detailed analysis of these results is beyond the scope of the present study .",
    "we intend to expand our work to all 49 ogle - ii galactic bulge fields covering a large range of @xmath33 and @xmath48 around the bar .",
    "a thorough analysis of all available data is underway and will be published elsewhere .",
