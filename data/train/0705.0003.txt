    "the transiting planets hd209458b @xcite , hat - p-1b @xcite , and wasp-1b @xcite have anomalously large radii compared to theoretical models and are thought to require an external source of energy to remain inflated @xcite .",
    "however , recently @xcite explain the radii of transiting planets without the need for an extra source of energy by accounting for enhanced metallicity opacities and properly comparing observed radii to theoretical radii .",
    "in contrast , hd149026b has an extremely high density and small radius @xcite .",
    "there is general agreement that a pure h / he mixture can not explain the small radius of hd149026b , but a planet model with a massive central core , @xmath18 , of heavy elements along with a small h / he envelope can explain the radius of hd149026b @xcite .",
    "disentangling the effects of stellar irradiation , migration , central core mass , and composition on the observed properties of planets requires discovering more bright transiting planets @xcite .",
    "xo-2b  is the second contribution to the bright transiting planet sample provided by the xo project @xcite ; xo-1b being the first @xcite .",
    "of the bright transiting planet hosts ( @xmath19 ) , xo-2  has the highest metallicity ( [ fe / h]=0.45  see   [ sec : sme ] ) .",
    "in addition , from a recent catalog of extrasolar planets @xcite , xo-2  has a higher metallicity than 96% of all known extrasolar planet hosts .",
    "metallicity plays a crucial role in the formation of planets and the resulting hj atmospheres .",
    "the frequency of radial velocity detected planets is known to increase with metallicity @xcite . in the core accretion planet formation model",
    ", a high metallicity environment grows larger cores and enables more objects to reach the critical mass necessary for runaway gas accretion and transformation into a detectable gas giant planet @xcite .",
    "detailed fits to the mass and radius of the known transiting planets yields a mass estimate for the central refractory element core @xcite .",
    "these investigations derive a larger core mass for planets that transit higher metallicity stars .",
    "in addition to the bulk properties of extrasolar planets , metallicity plays an important role in the planet s atmosphere , especially for a hj experiencing large stellar irradiation .",
    "an increased metallicity results in a greater absorption of the stellar irradiation and larger equilibrium temperatures than a comparable planet of lower metallicity @xcite .",
    "the variations in equilibrium temperature can lead to variations in the dominant observable features in the planet s atmosphere .    amongst the other transiting",
    "hj planets , xo-2b  shares a common characteristic with another transiting hj , hat - p-1b @xcite .",
    "both planets orbit one member of a nearly - equal - mass , wide separation stellar binary .",
    "the xo-2  stellar binary system has a separation of 31@xmath8 ( @xmath20 4600 au separation with a distance of @xmath20 150 pc ) and both components have an identical within the uncertainties 157 mas  yr@xmath7 proper motion vector as measured with tycho-2 @xcite and the high proper motion catalog of @xcite .",
    "it is not unusual for planets to exist in binary systems .",
    "@xcite find @xmath2123% of stars with planets have a stellar companion , however , they find evidence that the extrasolar planet sample is deficient in stellar binaries when compared to the field . a stellar companion with a 4600 au separation is not expected to influence the planet formation process . even assuming an orbital eccentricity , @xmath22=0.8 , for the unknown eccentricity of the xo-2  stellar binary , planets within @xmath23 au of xo-2  are dynamically stable @xcite ( we assume the current measured projected binary separation is close to the actual semi - major axis of the orbit when calculating @xmath24 ) .",
    "empirically , @xcite do not find any statistically significant difference between planets around single stars and planets in wide ( @xmath25 au ) separation binaries .",
    "however , understanding the influence of a stellar companion on the planet formation process is complicated by the fact that the binary configuration during planet formation may be vastly different than what is currently observed @xcite .    the similar brightness of the xo-2  stellar binary components and their angular separation provides an excellent opportunity for detailed line abundance studies",
    ". the higher metallicity of the known planet host stars is thought to be of primordial origin rather than heavy element pollution due to infalling planets @xcite .",
    "the infalling planet model for explaining the higher metallicity of the known planet host stars has predominately come from observations showing differing element abundances between common proper motion binary components .",
    "these element abundance differences have typically been overturned by further independent analyses @xcite .",
    "the difficulty in reliable abundance differences results from systematic effects in analyzing stars of different @xmath26 and evolutionary state @xcite .",
    "such effects are reduced for the xo-2  stellar binary .    on the sky , xo-2  and a line joining its stellar companion has a position angle of 162@xmath27 , nearly along the north - south direction ( see the finder chart in figure  [ finder ] ) .",
    "xo-2  is the northern component of the binary ( indicated by the arrow in figure  [ finder ] ) .",
    "the magnitude difference between the components is @xmath28 mag .",
    "thus , in the optical , xo-2  is fainter than its southern companion .",
    "the traditional nomenclature for binary stars designates xo-2  as xo-2b and the planet xo-2bb . however , throughout this article we simply designate the transiting hj stellar host xo-2  and the planet around it xo-2b . when it is unclear from the context we alternatively designate xo-2  as xo-2n and the southern stellar companion as xo-2s",
    "we adopt this naming convention because the magnitude difference between the stellar components is small and the spectra are nearly identical , both of which make it difficult to distinguish the objects , whereas the 31@xmath8 separation readily distinguishes the stellar components based on declination .",
    "we refer to both stellar components as a unit as the xo-2  stellar binary .",

    "the box - fitting least squares algorithm , bls , @xcite was employed to search the nearly 3000 observations per star for repetitive transit events with periods ranging from @xmath32 day .",
    "we perform the transit search on two realizations of the light curve .",
    "one realization is the calibrated light curves as described in @xcite and the other realization of the light curve has the sysrem algorithm @xcite applied to the calibrated light curve in order to further remove systematics . in the case of xo-2 , there were no substantive improvements in the light curve quality after implementing sysrem and both analyses identified the same transit period and phase .",

    "in addition , for consideration the candidates must pass selection criteria as described in @xcite . in brief",
    ", we require observations covering more than 1.5 transit events , avoid 0.5 and 1.0 day periods where systematic aliases result in false - positive detections , require the transit depth , @xmath33 mag , and require the transit to have higher significance than systematic errors ( as measured by the transit to anti - transit ratio statistic , rs , of @xcite ) .",

    "light curves resolving the components of the xo-2  stellar binary result in twice the transit depth ( see figure  [ et436 ] ) , but in the discovery light curve the transit depth is 0.007 mag . with the xo cameras , we observed two nearly complete transits of xo-2b  at the end of 2004 , and beginning of 2005 ( julian dates 2453355 and 2453376 ) . in addition , on seven other nights , xo cameras captured partial ingress and egress events .",

    "also , xo-2s being brighter and thus more massive than xo-2n implies log@xmath52 for xo-2s should be lower than log@xmath55 of xo-2n , opposite of what is measured .",

    "the sme based log@xmath47 can result in higher values than the y@xmath51 isochrones allow for some objects in the spectroscopic properties of cool stars ( spocs ) catalog as a result of the numerous degeneracies that exist between the spectral parameters ( see figure 16 of @xcite ) . despite individual cases of an overestimated log@xmath47 ,",
    "comparing stars analyzed with sme in common with other independent spectral analyses does not reveal a systematic offset in log@xmath47 ( see figure 20 of @xcite ) .",
    "the 1-@xmath43 uncertainties in the stellar parameters given in table  [ table : sme ] are based on the typical rms scatter in parameters measured in independent , multiple spectra for stars in the spocs catalog .",
    "based on the 1-@xmath43 uncertainties in table  [ table : sme ] , the difference in log@xmath47 between xo-2n and xo-2s is significant . however , the distribution of repeat measurements for parameters in the spocs catalog ( see table 5 of @xcite ) display extended wings and the gaussian - based uncertainties underestimate the possibility of outlying measurements .",
    "thus , we also provide the 99.7% confidence intervals for the parameters based on table 5 of @xcite .",
    "since , the xo-2s parameters are based on a single spectrum , the 99.7% confidence interval is more appropriate than relying solely on the 1-@xmath43 error when deciding on the significance of any differences between the properties of xo-2n and xo-2s .",

    "given the much larger scale height for the thick disk , @xmath114 kpc , under the classification of @xcite , xo-2  belongs to the thin disk , since its orbit is well confined to the galactic plane .",
