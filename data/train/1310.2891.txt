    "the estimation of absolute and relative free energies lies at the very heart of computational chemistry .",
    "accordingly , a wide range of methods such as thermodynamic integration and umbrella sampling has been developed , see , e.g. , refs .   for recent reviews .",
    "with the advent of fluctuation theorems  @xcite and the jarzynski relation  @xcite , non - equilibrium methods have been added to this arsenal .",
    "these non - equilibrium methods promise to extract free energy differences from switching trajectories that are harvested out of equilibrium .",
    "it has been argued that non - equilibrium methods generally are less efficient than conventional methods  @xcite .",
    "there might be , however , situations where they constitute the only possibility , e.g. in force - probe experiments and molecular dynamics simulations of large biomolecules  @xcite .",
    "moreover , the free energy estimated from trajectories generated under uni - directional protocols is biased , a problem that can be alleviated by bi - directional sampling schemes employing bennett s acceptance ratio method  @xcite .    an open question in stochastic thermodynamics",
    "@xcite is how coarse - graining and hidden degrees of freedom influence the statistics , and therefore the fluctuation theorems , of work and heat  @xcite .",
    "for example , overdamped dynamics is typically used to model soft matter systems on time scales larger than the relaxation time of momenta . in this case a reduced description is found by eliminating fast degrees of freedom . however , in an environment with a spatially varying temperature there is a contribution to the entropy production ( due to microscopic cycles ) that is missed by the overdamped dynamics  @xcite .",
    "another possibility is to eliminate slow degrees of freedom : in ref .",
    "the position of a colloidal particles has been measured that is coupled to another `` hidden '' particle , leading to a modified slope of the fluctuation theorem . for discrete state spaces ,",
    "coarse - graining based on a time - scale separation has been discussed for removing fast states  @xcite and the clustering of microstates into mesostates  @xcite .    in this paper , we consider another kind of coarse - graining arising in many - body systems , where we might no longer be able ( or interested ) to fully resolve the microscopic particle positions . instead , we measure a coarse - grained density profile by counting particles in a probe volume over some time .",
    "this density fluctuates , i.e. , repeating the experiment we will obtain slightly different densities for each realization .",
    "such a behavior calls for a field theoretical treatment . in sec .",
    "[ sec : st ] , we make the link to stochastic thermodynamics by proving the jarzynski relation under two conditions : ( i ) the time evolution of density fluctuations are governed by the kawasaki - dean equation  @xcite and ( ii ) the free energy functional that enters the kawasaki - dean equation is given by the same functional that determines the equilibrium weight of density fluctuations away from the most probable density profile .",
    "there is a close link to density functional theory  @xcite , which has been applied successfully to study the structural and thermodynamics properties of a wide range of spatially inhomogeneous systems . as an illustration , in sec .",
    "[ sec : illu ] we consider the compression and expansion of a colloidal suspension .",
