    "resonant tunneling@xcite through double barrier structures , ( dbs ) has been one of the most active fields in research in solid state physics , both from theoretical and experimental standpoints .",
    "the main reason is that resonant tunneling has been considered to have a great potential applicability in electronic devices . in the same way ,",
    "the interaction of an external time - dependent potential with resonant structures is considered to have very interesting applications , for instance the use of dbs as detectors and generators of microwave radiation . in this paper",
    "we are going to study the effect of a photon field on both coherent and sequential tunneling current through a dbs . +    the work of sollner et al@xcite , is the experimental starting point for studies on the effect of time - dependent potentials in resonant tunneling through semiconductor microstructures : they studied the influence of electromagnetic radiation on resonant tunneling current .",
    "recently chitta et al@xcite have studied the far infrared response of double barrier resonant tunneling structures",
    ". theoretical work on tunneling devices under the influence of a time - dependent potential has a long history .",
    "tien and gordon@xcite , studied the effect that microwave radiation has on superconducting tunneling devices .",
    "several authors@xcite have investigated the effect that external ac potentials have in different problems .",
    "jonson@xcite , apell et al@xcite and johansson et al@xcite have studied the sequential contribution to the tunneling through a dbs under an electromagnetic field applied , using models based in the transfer hamiltonian formalism@xcite . in all those models above ,",
    "the coupling between electrons and the electromagnetic field is considered to take place just in a part of the structure : in most of them in the well , and in the case of apell et al@xcite in the emitter and collector , but in none of them affecting the whole structure .",
    "+    in this paper we have calculated how the transmission coefficient and the current for electrons in a dbs are changed due to the presence of light in the whole structure . in order to do that we have developed a quantum mechanical formalism to find the expression for the electronic state dressed by photons and we have calculated the resonant tunneling current under the influence of an external electromagnetic field .",
    "this quantum mechanical formalism based in a canonical transformation and in the time dependent perturbation theory , has been aplied to coherent and sequential tunneling processes , and the results we have obtained are in good agreement with the available experiments@xcite .",
    "the case of coherent resonant tunneling assisted by light in the presence of a magnetic field parallel to the current , has been also studied .",
    "+    this paper is organized as follows : in sec ii , we discuss and develop the theoretical formalism . in sec iii.a and b , we applied that formalism to coherent and sequential tunneling respectively . in sec",
    "iv , our results for both types of tunneling for different frequencies , external electromagnetic fields and magnetic fields are presented and compared with experimental@xcite results . we summarize our conclusions in sec v. +",
    "the quantum mechanical hamiltonian for an electron in the presence of an electromagnetic field represented by a plane electromagnetic wave of wave vector @xmath0 , parallel to the @xmath1 direction and polarized in the @xmath2 direction @xmath3 , ( see fig 1 ) , can be written as : @xmath4 in our problem we apply an external bias , such that the electrostatic and barriers potential depends only on the @xmath2 direction so we take the potential @xmath5 as @xmath6 . in the coulomb gauge @xmath7 then ( 1 ) becomes : @xmath8 in our case the vector potential operator @xmath9 . in general",
    ", @xmath10 is negligible compared to the @xmath11 term , therefore we can write in second quantization for the total hamiltonian : @xmath12 where @xmath13\\\\ w_{od}(t)&= & \\sum_{k}\\sum_{k^{'}\\neq k } [ ( e / m^{*})<k^{'}|p_{z}|k >    c_{k^{'}}^{+ } c_{k } ( \\hbar/2\\epsilon vw)^{1/2 }     ( a e^{-iwt } + a^{+ } e^{iwt})]\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath14 being @xmath15 the photon frequency , the wave vector of the electromagnetic field has been neglected , and where the term @xmath16 is already included in the state vector @xmath17 .",
    "@xmath18 is the independent , electronic hamiltonian and includes the double barrier potential and the external applied bias , therefore the eigenstates of @xmath18 , @xmath19 , are the tunneling states for bare electrons .",
    "@xmath20 , is the photon field hamiltonian whithout coupling with electrons and @xmath21 and @xmath22 , describe the coupling between electrons and photons in the total hamiltonian .",
    "we separate the coupling term in the `` diagonal '' ( 6 ) and the `` off - diagonal '' ( 7 ) contributions because we are going to be interested in problems where a quasi - localized state is connected by the electromagnetic field with a continuum of extended states .",
    "therefore @xmath22 , can be treated in first order time dependent perturbation theory . for problems in which two o more quasi - localized states should be connected by the light",
    ", the method could not be applied in the same way , requiring some generalization . .",
    "therefore the total hamiltonian can be written as : @xmath23 where @xmath24 +    the hamiltonian @xmath25 , can be solved exactly considering a canonical transformation@xcite,@xcite .",
    "it allows to obtain the exact electronic wave function dressed by photons : @xmath26 , where @xmath19 is the electronic double barrier eigenstate with no photon field present in the sample .",
    "once we have obtained the eigenstates for @xmath25 , we apply the time dependent perturbation theory in order to treat the @xmath22 term .",
    "the operator @xmath27 for the canonical transformation is given by @xmath28 , and @xmath29 can be written as : @xmath30 the hamiltonian under this transformation becomes : @xmath31 where @xmath32 and @xmath33 @xcite . in the transformed hamiltonian @xmath34 the electrons and photons",
    "are not coupled any more and the electronic eigenvalues are shifted in @xmath35 which is negligible with respect to the free electron eigenvalues .",
    "finally we can write the exact eigenstate for @xmath25 in terms of the electric field intensity @xmath36 @xcite : @xmath37}\\psi_{0}(k)=    \\psi_{0}(k ) \\sum_{n=-\\infty}^{\\infty}j_{n}(\\beta_{k } ) e^{-inwt}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath38 . +    at this point , and in order to obtain the total wave function where non - diagonal terms @xmath39 are included , we consider time dependent perturbation theory up to first order . for that purpose",
    "we calculate the total wave function time dependent coefficients , which are given by : @xmath40 where @xmath41 since we consider first order time dependent perturbation theory , we keep only the @xmath42 bessel functions terms because if we took the @xmath43 terms or terms of higher order in the bessel functions , that would mean to consider second or higher order processes giving a very small contribution to the total wave function .",
    "due to that we will see below that only one photon absorption and emission processes are considered in our formalism . from",
    "( 11 ) , ( 12 ) and ( 13 ) we have : @xmath44 dw_{k^{'}}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in the calculation of this integral , the principal part term results to be negligible compared to the @xmath45 term .",
    "if we carry out that integral , taking the above into account we can obtain for the coefficients : @xmath46 + therefore , denoting by @xmath47 , the wave vector of the initial electron we can write for the total wave function : @xmath48\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the normalization constant @xmath49 is the `` dressed '' reference state and @xmath50 , and @xmath51 , are the two coupled `` dressed '' states due to one photon absorption and emission processes and @xmath52 , are the corresponding coefficients for @xmath53 coming from the 1 photon absorption ( emission ) processes , @xmath54 .",
    "now we use the above electronic structure to analyze the problem of coherent resonant tunneling in a dbs assisted by light . before turning on the light we are going to calculate , applying the transfer matrix technique , the transmission coefficient for a double barrier .",
    "first of all we write in this framework , the wave function in the emitter and collector regions for an electron ( @xmath55 and @xmath56 , respectively ) crossing the double barrier ( see fig 1 ) : @xmath57 where @xmath58 , and @xmath59 , are the electronic wave vector perpendicular components in the emitter and collector respectively .",
    "the incident and transmitted currents are @xmath60 , and @xmath61 , respectively so that the transmission coefficient is @xmath62 . , where the factor @xmath63 is calculated by means of the transfer matrix formalism , i.e. imposing the boundary continuity of wave function and current at the barrier interfaces@xcite .",
    "+    if now we turn on the light , our state is transformed in the electron- photon wave function @xmath53 ( 16 ) . from",
    "that we calculate the new incident and transmitted currents , and after some algebra the transmission coefficient in the presence of light becomes : @xmath64 , @xmath65 and @xmath66 , ( @xmath67 , @xmath68 and @xmath69 ) , are the standard coherent double barrier reflexion ( transmission ) coefficients , evaluated at the reference energy , at one photon above and at one photon below the reference energy , respectively .",
    "this expression for the reflexion coeffient verifies the current conservation : @xmath70 , it means that the probability for an electron to tunnel with no photon absorption or emission is smaller than the corresponding with no light present in the sample .",
    "it is due to the finite probability associated to emission and absorption processes and it is a consequence of the unitarity @xcite , and comes directly from the normalization of the total electronic wave function where one photon absorption and emission processes are considered .",
    "as the electromagnetic field intensity increases , the inelastic processes are more probable and therefore , the elastic or direct tunneling has a smaller probability than for low field intensities . in order to analyze the dc current , which is the only one observed in the experiments@xcite , we have made a time average so that no interference terms appear .",
    "finally the total electronic current can be written as : @xmath71 being @xmath72 the fermi function , @xmath73 the electronic energy parallel part and @xmath74 the external dc applied bias .",
    "+    we can now consider the problem of adding a magnetic field @xmath75 , parallel to the current direction , i.e. , the @xmath2 direction . in the landau gauge : @xmath76 .",
    "the effect of this magnetic field is to change the parallel part of the density of states and due to that instead of a continuum of states we have now the landau levels ladder .",
    "the hamiltonian for an electron in the presence of an electromagnetic field in the configuration considered above and a magnetic field parallel to the current can be describe in second quantization as : @xmath12 @xmath20 , @xmath77,and @xmath78 , are exactly the same as the ones described in the general formalism , but @xmath18 has been transformed due to the presence of the magnetic field and can be written now in second quantization as : @xmath79 where @xmath80 is the magnetic field intensity , @xmath81 is the cyclotron frequency : @xmath82 , @xmath83 , and @xmath84 are the creation and destruction operators for the landau states , and @xmath85 is the electronic energy perpendicular part . with no magnetic field present in the sample the parallel component for the electronic wave vector",
    "is conserved during the photoassisted tunneling process .",
    "now as the magnetic field is switched on , is the landau level index what is conserved .",
    "the alignment of the landau levels in the emitter and in the well with the same index , gives a jump in the electronic current , giving@xcite eventually a sawtooth profile for the i - v characteristic depending on the magnetic field intensity .",
    "the expression for the current can be written then as : @xmath86 t(e , n)\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] being @xmath87 the landau level index , @xmath88 , the maximum ocupied landau level index , and @xmath89 the transmission coefficient when the photon field is present in the sample ( 19 ) .      in order to study the sequential tunneling ,",
    "we have developed a model that calculates separately the current for the first and the second barriers , @xmath43 , and @xmath90 .",
    "these currents are related to the fermi level in the well @xmath91 or in other words , to the amount of electronic charge stored into the well . in this model",
    "we adjust selfconsistently the fermi level till the currents through the first and the second barriers result to be equal .",
    "the values calculated in this way for the current and the fermi level in the well , are indeed the actual current which is crossing the whole double barrier sequentialy and the fermi level corresponding to the actual amount of charge stored into the well .",
    "this model takes into account macroscopically the possible scattering processes within the well .",
    "+    in order to calculate @xmath43 , and @xmath90 without light , we use the transfer hamiltonian method @xcite . we calculate for the first barrier , the probability @xmath92 for the electron to cross from the emitter to the well : @xmath93\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath94 is the transmission coefficient for a single barrier ; @xmath58 ( @xmath95 ) and @xmath96 ( @xmath97 ) are the perpendicular ( parallel ) component for the electronic wave vector in the emitter and well respectively ; @xmath98 , is the well state energy referred to conduction band bottom : @xmath99 ( where @xmath100 , is the well state energy referred to well bottom ) ; @xmath101 , @xmath102 ; @xmath103 , @xmath104 and @xmath105 are the first barrier , well and second barrier widths and @xmath106 is the total width for the whole structure .",
    "it is important to stress the presence of the @xmath107 term in the @xmath92 expression .",
    "it implies that only for those emitter states which resonate with the well state , will be possible to cross the emitter barrier to the well and therefore contribute to the current . with this probability @xmath92",
    ", we can calculate the current @xmath43 that , after integrating in the energy is given by : @xmath108 where @xmath109 and @xmath91 , are the fermi level energies in the emitter and in the well respectively . for the second barrier , we apply exactly the same formalism and we obtain for the probability of crossing from the well to the collector @xmath110 and for the current through the second barrier @xmath90 : @xmath111\\\\ j_{2}&=&(e/2\\pi\\hbar)\\frac{k_{w}t_{s}}{w_{2}+(1/\\alpha_{b})+ ( 1/\\alpha_{d } ) } e_{w}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where , @xmath96 is the perpendicular component for the electronic wave vector in the well . +    repeating the arguments we have made to study the effect of the light on coherent tunneling , it is straightforward to extend that formalism to the sequential tunneling case . before switching on the light",
    "the electrons have just one way to get into the well state from the emitter : from an emitter state which is resonant with the well state i.e. , having the @xmath107 term in the integral .",
    "now when we switch on the light , the electrons have three different ways to tunnel through the emitter barrier to the well .",
    "the first one is a direct way and it corresponds to an emitter state which resonates with the well state , the transmission takes place whithout light absorption or emission .",
    "the second one is through and absorption process from an emitter state which is found at one photon energy below the resonant well state . and",
    "finally the third way is through an emission process from an emitter state which is found at one photon energy above the resonant well state . for those reasons above we will have in the @xmath43 expression the sum of three terms in each one appearing a different @xmath45 function .",
    "the direct term has in its expression a @xmath112 $ ] , the absorption term a @xmath113 $ ] , and finally the emission term a @xmath114 $ ] .",
    "so the final expression we have for the current @xmath43 : @xmath115       \\frac{t_{s,0}}{1+k_{1}/k_{0}|c_{1,0}^{(1)}|^{2}+k_{-1}/k_{0 }         |c_{-1,0}^{(1)}|^{2}}+\\nonumber\\\\       & & \\delta[e_{z}-(e_{tn}-\\hbar w ) ]       \\frac{t_{s,1}|c_{1,0}^{(1)}|^{2}}{k_{0}/k_{1}+|c_{1,0}^{(1)}|^{2}+         k_{-1}/k_{1}|c_{-1,0}^{(1)}|^{2}}+\\nonumber\\\\       & & \\delta[e_{z}-(e_{tn}+\\hbar w ) ]       \\frac{t_{s,-1}|c_{-1,0}^{(1)}|^{2}}{k_{0}/k_{-1}+k_{1}/k_{-1 }        |c_{1,0}^{(1)}|^{2}+ |c_{-1,0}^{(1)}|^{2 } }       ] \\int_{e_{w}}^{e_{f}-e_{z}}de_{p}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] if we make this integral , we can finally obtain for @xmath43 : @xmath116\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where as above , the subscript `` 0 '' means the reference state energy that in our case is the resonant well state energy . the subscript `` 1 '' and `` -1 '' mean one photon energy above and below respectively , etc .",
    "+    for the second barrier we do not have the constraint of crossing to a specific discrete state , but what we have now is a continuum of states in the collector .",
    "the expression we have for the current through the second barrier in the presence of light is formally equal to the @xmath43 expression i.e. , it is formed for the sum of three contributions , each one at different energy . at this point",
    "we apply the same procedure as in the case where there is no light present , i.e. , we calculate selfconsistently the fermi level in the well till both currents for the first and second barriers , result to be equal .",
    "the values obtained in this way are the actual photoassisted sequential current and fermi level in the well .",
    "we have performed a calculation for a gaas - gaalas dbs with a well and barriers thicknesses of @xmath117 , in order to analyze the experimental information@xcite .",
    "the electromagnetic field is polarized along the sample growth direction ( fig .",
    "1 ) , and the carrier density @xmath118 @xmath119 .",
    "first of all we have calculated the total transmission coefficient for coherent tunneling , for a field intensity @xmath120 and energy @xmath121 and for different external bias ( @xmath122 and 0.14 v , figures 2a , b , c ) .",
    "the main features observed in the transmission coefficient as a function of the total energy are two satellite peaks coming from the one photon absorption and emission processes ( higher order processes are neglected in our model as it has been discussed above ) .",
    "as the bias increases , due to the asymmetry in the sample , the satellites become asymmetric too , and for high bias only the satellite coming from the one photon emission process shows up . in fig .",
    "3.a we have plotted the coherent resonant tunneling current density as a function of the external bias in the presence of the electromagnetic field .",
    "the effect of the light on the current density can be observed in fig .",
    "3.b where the calculated current difference between the case where there is light present in the sample , minus the case where there is not light present is drawn .",
    "one observes a main structure in the region corresponding to the current density threshold , the appearence of a shoulder for bias roughly at the center of the current peak and a smaller structure asociated with the current cut off .",
    "+ the change in the tunneling current as a function of the external bias comes mainly from the change in the transmission coefficient where two satellites appear corresponding to the one photon absorption and one photon emission processes .",
    "the current is then obtained integrating to all the available states with energies up to the fermi level . in fig . 3.b",
    "a main peak shows up at an external bias smaller than the current threshold bias for the case where no light is present in the sample .",
    "physically it comes from the fact that electrons in the emitter close to the fermi energy have a probability to absorb a photon and to tunnel through the resonant state .",
    "therefore the current increases in the presence of light and the threshold bias for the current is smaller than the corresponding to the case where the sample is not illuminated and a positive peak appears in the current difference . for higher voltages , as the resonant level crosses the fermi energy , there is also an additional contribution to the current coming from electrons absorbing a photon and tunneling non resonantly through the double barrier .",
    "finally , the physical reason for the structure appearing at the current cut off bias ( around .18 mv ) comes from the emission procceses once the resonant state in the well crosses the bottom of the conduction band of the emitter .",
    "this features are in good agreement with the experimental curve @xcite .    in order to compare with the experimental evidence we have to analyze the sequential contribution to the tunneling current and confront it with the coherent one .",
    "therefore we have calculated the sequential tunneling current density in the presence of light as well as the current difference with and without the photon field ( fig . 4.a and",
    "4.b respectively ) .",
    "one observes that the sequential current falls down at the bias corresponding to the current cut off more abruptly than the coherent one and that the current intensity is of the same order as the coherent one .",
    "more interesting is the fact that the current difference ( fig .",
    "4.b ) for sequential tunneling is one order of magnitud smaller than the corresponding to the coherent process ( fig .",
    "3.b ) , therefore we conclude that the experimental difference of currents , corresponds to the coherence tunneling proccess which dominates on the sequential one .",
    "we have also evaluated the coherent and sequential current densities for the same sample but considering photons with lower energy : @xmath123 ( fig . 5 and 6 ) in order to compare with the experimental results@xcite . in this case",
    "the same behaviour is observed as in the previous case when the coherent contribution is compared with the sequential one : the coherent tunneling current density is comparable in intensity with the sequential one and the current difference ( with and without light present in the sample ) is one order of magnitud larger in the coherent proccess than in the sequential one , therefore the last one is hidden by the coherent contribution and is this one which should be compared with the experiment .",
    "the agreement for this case ( lower frecuency ) , is not so good as for the previous one : the current difference for the coherent case ( fig .",
    "5.b ) presents a peak for a bias smaller than that corresponding to the threshold current density whithout light . as in the previous case ,",
    "this structure comes from electrons close to the fermi level which absorb one photon .",
    "this peak , which is less intense than in the previous case ( less electrons with energies below @xmath109 than in the case with higher photon energy ) and narrower , is not observed experimentaly , however the main features are well reproduced . in order to see how it changes the relative intensity between coherent and sequential tunneling current densities as a function of the barrier thicknesses",
    "we have performed the same calculations as explained above for thicker samples . for barrier thicknesses of @xmath124 and a well thickness of @xmath117 the same behaviour as before",
    "is observed , i.e. , the coherent tunneling prevaleces in the current density difference with and without light ( fig 7 and 8) .",
    "we do not have considered the case for thinner barriers , because our model developed to describe the sequential tunneling can not be applied properly to such cases and due to that we can not make a correct comparison with the coherent tunneling case .",
    "the reason is that we neglect in our model for sequential tunneling the finite width of the resonant state in the well which increases as the barrier thickness decreases .",
    "+    finally , we have analyzed the effect of an external magnetic field applied in the current direction on this sample in the presence of the photon field in the same configuration as in fig .",
    "we pay attention just to the coherent current which was dominant in the absence of magnetic field .",
    "we have analyzed two different cases : in the first one the magnetic field intensity is @xmath125 and the photon energy @xmath126 , therefore the cyclotron frecuency is twice the photon frecuency .",
    "the second case corresponds to the same magnetic field intensity but a photon energy of @xmath127 . for this magnetic field",
    "there are two landau levels which contributes to the current ( fig 9.a ) . as the electromagnetic field",
    "is schwitched on , the current density is modified independently for each landau level .",
    "this can be observed in fig . 9.b and 9.c . in the case",
    "that the cyclotron frecuency is twice the photon frequency ( fig 9.b ) , the way the light affects each landau level separately is well resolved . in the second case , where the cyclotron frequency is the same as the photon frequency ( fig .",
    "9.c ) the current difference structures associated to each landau level overlap but remain decoupled each other",
    ". this result does not give any aditional information to the photoassisted tunneling whithout magnetic field , because in this configuration the magnetic field only affects to the planes parallel to the interfaces while the light affects the tunneling in the current direction .",
    "therefore the effect of both fields on the tunneling current are compleately decoupled .",
    "more interesting would be to consider an electromagnetic field with a component of the electric field in the interface planes . in this case",
    "the effect on the current due to the magnetic field and the light will not be independent each other anymore and new physical effects could be expected , that is the task of a next coming paper .",
    "we have studied the problem of coherent and sequential tunneling through a double barrier structure assisted by light considered to be present all over the structure , i.e. , emitter , well and collector , which is a realistic description of the experiments . by means of a canonical transformation and time dependent perturbation theory up",
    "to first order , we have calculated the coherent transmission coefficient and the electrical current through the system , for this specific problem , resulting that the electromagnetic field couples states of different energies due to one photon absorption and emission processes .",
    "the higher order contributions to the current ( multiphoton absorption and emission processes ) are much weaker and their contribution can be neglected in first aproximation . as a result of that two satellite peaks",
    "appear in the transmission coefficient at both sides of the main resonant peak .",
    "therefore , the total transmission coefficient and the coherent tunneling current are affected by the photon field and new features in the current density are observed . in order to obtain the total density current we have developed a model to analyze the sequential tunneling current through a double barrier in the presence of light .",
    "we have calculated the electronic tunneling current through the first barrier , i.e. , from the emitter to the resonant state in the well in the presence of light and the current through the collector barrier coming from the electrons in the well .",
    "the current conservation is reached when both currents are equal and it determines the fermi level in the well , i.e. , the charge stored in the well .",
    "the sequential contribution to the current coming out , is of the same order as the coherent one . for the current difference with and without electromagnetic field",
    "the coherent part is one order of magnitud larger than the sequential one for the samples considered in our calculation .",
    "therefore it is the coherent current which should be compared with the experiments @xcite , turning out to be both , theory and experiment , in good agreement .",
    "we have also considered an external magnetic field applied in the growth direction on the double barrier structure and in the presence of light .",
    "the analysis of the coherent tunneling current has been done for different ratios between the cyclotron and the photon frecuencies .",

    "<S> our calculations have been compared with experimental results turning out to be in good agreement . </S>",
    "<S> also the effect on the coherent tunneling of a magnetic field parallel to the current in the presence of light , has been considered .    </S>",
