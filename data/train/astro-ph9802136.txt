    "the cross section of the reaction @xmath0be(p,@xmath1b has recently become the subject of renewed intense scrutiny [ 1 ] owing to the pre - eminence of the @xmath3b reaction products as the main source of high energy neutrinos in the interior of the sun and , hence , the possible implications for the so - called  solar neutrino problem \" .",
    "a number of new precision measurements of this cross section in various stages of preparation have been reported lately . we have set up an experiment for such a measurement at the weizmann institute , focusing on one of the major sources of uncertainty in previous experiments : the homogeneity of the areal density of the target material .",
    "in general , when a nonuniform particle beam impinges on a nonuniform target , the reaction yield is given by : y = ds where @xmath6 are the respective total numbers of beam and target particles and @xmath7 are areal densities .",
    "+ only when the target is known to be uniform and the beam is smaller than the target can eq.(1 ) be simplified to : y = ds = n_b in such a case , the evaluation of the cross section is independent of the areal distribution of the particle beam . on the other hand , in other cases - e.g. for radiochemically produced @xmath0be targets [ 2 ] -",
    "the target can not be assumed to be strictly uniform and the full relation ( 1 ) has to be used in the evaluation .",
    "the inherent uncertainties in the distributions @xmath8 and @xmath9 may thus lead to considerable uncertainties in the value of the integral and hence in the deduced cross section .",
    "we have addressed this problem by inverting the arrangement : we use a homogeneous beam - produced by raster scanning - impinging on a target than the beam .",
    "the relation ( 1 ) then reduces to : y = n_t independent of the potentially problematic determination of the target areal distribution .    as a first step we measured the cross section of the reaction @xmath0li(d , p)@xmath3li at the top of the resonance at e@xmath4(lab.)=776 kev",
    "the mirror nuclei @xmath3li and @xmath3b have very similar mean lives and similar @xmath10 decays ( @xmath11 and @xmath12 , respectively ) to @xmath3be @xmath13 2@xmath14 .",
    "the main differences are ( i ) the much easier preparation of a @xmath0li target and ( ii ) the much higher yield from @xmath0li(d , p ) .",
    "the reaction @xmath0li(d , p)@xmath3li can therefore provide a convenient check of the equipment and the method . beyond that , this reaction is of significance in its own right and as a stepping stone and calibration in some @xmath0be(p,@xmath5)@xmath3b experiments [ 1 - 4 ] .",
    "+    in the course of the present investigation we have examined a new issue : reaction - product nuclei being backscattered from the target backing , leaving the target assembly and reducing the number of detected @xmath14 particles .",
    "we present below experimental results which probe this issue and compare them to computer simulations .",
    "the influence of this effect on past and future measurements is discussed .",
    "the general scheme of the experiment is shown in fig .",
    "1a . a d@xmath15 beam out of the weizmann institute 3 mv van de graaff accelerator is raster scanned over a rectangle of 7 mm@xmath16 6 mm .",
    "the purpose of the scan is to obtain a beam of uniform areal density .",
    "the d@xmath15 beam ( as well as the p beam , see below ) is collimated by a 3 mm diameter hole and impinges on a circular target of lif of 2 mm diameter , evaporated on al and pt foils ( see discussion below ) ; the target spot is aligned with a set of variable collimators downstream of the target . the target is mounted on an arm which is periodically moved out of the beam and in front of a 40 micron surface barrier detector registering the delayed @xmath14 s following the @xmath10 decay of @xmath17 .",
    "the detector was surrounded by a shroud to prevent scattered beam particles from reaching the detector .",
    "the time sequence of the whole cycle is : a.- 1.5 s beam - on - target ; b.- 100 ms rotation ; c.- 1.5 s of target in the counting position ; d.- 100 ms rotation . in the counting position a gate signal from the control unit opens the adc for @xmath14 counting and the gated scaler for faraday - cup beam monitoring . this sequence results in an efficiency factor for the @xmath14 count ( see below ) of @xmath18(cycle ) = 0.400(1 ) ( fig .",
    "a liquid nitrogen cold cryofinger is placed close to the target area to protect the target surface from contamination .",
    "the vacuum in the chamber was @xmath19 8@xmath2010@xmath21 torr .",
    "the beam density @xmath8 was measured by collimating the beam by a series of holes of known areas downstream from the target position , integrating the collimated beam in an electron - suppressed faraday cup and counting the digitized counts in a gated scaler .",
    "the current digitizer and the scaler were checked during the experiment with a a calibrated current source .",
    "the beam homogeneity was virtually insured by the nature of the raster operation : a low frequency triangular @xmath22 scan and a high frequency triangular @xmath23 scan , in small , digitally controlled steps in clock - fixed time intervals .",
    "the beam homogeneity was checked in two direct ways : 1.- by measuring the areal density of x - rays from a tin foil induced by the scanned proton beam in a phosphor image plate ( fig . 2a ,",
    "5 ) , 2 ) by repeating the measurement with different downstream collimators of know apertures . for a homogeneous beam",
    "the faraday - cup counts of the integrated beam , normalized to the @xmath14 yield , should be proportional to the area of the hole ( fig .",
    "the collimator hole areas were measured to an accuracy better than 1@xmath24 by a microscope and by having an alpha source in front of the collimator - detector assembly .",
    "the number @xmath25 of @xmath0li nuclei in the 2 mm target was determined in a similar measurement using the reaction @xmath0li(p , n)@xmath0be with a proton beam of 1.985 mev ( refs . 6 and 7 ) .",
    "the same downstream beam collimator of 1.5 mm diameter was used in both measurements .",
    "the number of @xmath0be s produced was measured by registering @xmath5 s from the beta decay @xmath0be@xmath26li@xmath27 ( 478 kev ) in a ge detector at the low - background counting laboratory of the nrc - soreq center .",
    "we have also taken care to adjust the plate - voltage to ensure the same area for both the p and d@xmath15 beams , respectively .",
    "for the ratio of the two yields we get from ( 1 ) : @xmath28 where @xmath29 refer , respectively , to the total number of deuterons and protons registered .",
    "the number of @xmath3li products , y(@xmath3li ) , is evaluated from the measured @xmath14 counts : @xmath30 and y(@xmath0be ) is evaluated from the measured @xmath5 counts of the radioactive decay of @xmath0be : @xmath31 the efficiency factors @xmath32 and @xmath33 above are each products of individual and independent efficiency factors detailed below . inserting the expressions for n@xmath34 and n@xmath35 into ( 4 ) we obtain the @xmath0li(d , p)@xmath3li cross section in terms of the @xmath0li(p , n)@xmath0be cross section and measured quantities : @xmath36",
    "1 .   _ the solid angle_. + the detector solid angle was defined by a collimator of diameter d=8.14(3 ) mm which was placed at a distance @xmath37 = 81.92(10 ) mm from the target in the counting position .",
    "the solid angle is given by : @xmath38 = 6.16(6 ) 10@xmath39 of @xmath40 .",
    "2 .   _ the time - sequence efficiency - @xmath18(cycle ) _ + this factor relates to the time fraction of the @xmath14 counting out of the entire irradiation - counting cycle . from the description above and following refs . 2,3 , this factor",
    "is calculated to be : @xmath18(cycle ) = 0.400(1 ) .",
    "the time intervals of the rotation cycle were measured by counting a time - reference signal in the scaler gated by the cycle time windows ( fig .",
    "3 .   _ the spectral efficiency . _ + the @xmath14 spectrum in fig .",
    "was integrated from the point marked in the figure all the way to the top energy .",
    "the cutoff entailed a loss of low energy @xmath14 s on one hand and on the other - the inclusion of the high energy tail of the noise spectrum .",
    "these two quantities were estimated by rough extrapolations to be considerably less than 1@xmath24 and approximately equal and hence the integration error appears to be negligible .",
    "the low energy tail of the @xmath14 spectrum was also evaluated directly from the measured @xmath14 spectrum in ref .",
    "8 folded with the energy loss of the @xmath14 s in the target , yielding a lost fraction of 0.2@xmath24 .",
    "1 .   _ the @xmath5 branch . _",
    "+ the @xmath5 branch of the decay of @xmath0be to the first excited state of @xmath0li at 478 kev is 0.1052(6 ) [ 9 ] .",
    "_ absolute calibration of the @xmath0be activity . _ + the activity of the @xmath0be 478 kev @xmath5-ray source produced in the ( p , n ) reaction on the various targets was determined by comparison with calibrated @xmath41na , @xmath42cs and @xmath43ba @xmath5 sources at a fixed distance from a ge detector , shielded for low - background , at the @xmath5-counting laboratory of the nrc - soreq center .",
    "the absolute intensities of the @xmath5 sources used are known to within 2.5 - 3@xmath24 each .",
    "the number of 478 kev @xmath5 rays ( and hence the number of @xmath0li nuclei in the target ) is thus determined to an accuracy of 3@xmath24 .",
    "3 .   _ the @xmath10 decay of @xmath0be . _",
    "the lif targets were bombarded by protons for several hours and @xmath5 s were counted for about a day a short time later .",
    "the number of @xmath0be s was inferred from the number of @xmath5 counts through the relation : @xmath44 where @xmath45 is the @xmath5 counting time , @xmath46 is the time from the middle of the @xmath47 run to the middle of the counting time , @xmath48 is the @xmath0be mean life : @xmath49 d [ 9 ] and @xmath50 and @xmath51 are the efficiency factors referred to above .      1 .   _ current integration . _",
    "+ the quantity @xmath52 is the ratio of scaler counts from a current integrator monitoring the current in the faraday cup for the d@xmath15 and p beams , respectively , using the same collimator hole . the construction of the faraday cup , including the suppressor , ensures a reliable monitoring of the current .",
    "a calibrated current source was used to check the accuracy of the current integrator . in any case , as only the @xmath53 of the counts enters the cross - section determination , any possible error from this source cancels out in first order .",
    "2 .   _ counting statistics - @xmath54 . _",
    "+ the statistical errors of the @xmath14 and @xmath5 counts were typically 0.5@xmath24 and 0.7@xmath24 , respectively for all the targets used .",
    "there is in addition a 1@xmath24 systematic error in the @xmath5 counting due to uncertainties in the background subtraction procedure .",
    "3 .   _ the @xmath0li(p , n)@xmath0be cross section . _",
    "+ the cross section for this reaction exhibits a flat and constant region around the beam energy of e@xmath55 = 1.985 mev employed in this experiment .",
    "the cross section at this energy was taken from refs .",
    "6,7 , which are in very good agreement with each other .",
    "each of these references quotes , separately , an absolute error of 5@xmath24 .",
    "we therefore adopt the value of @xmath2li(p , n)@xmath0be ] = 269(9 ) mb at e@xmath55 = 1.985 mev .",
    "+ table i presents a summary of the experimental errors discussed above . + another source of error which was considered is the production of @xmath0be by @xmath56li(d , n)@xmath0be , adding on to the @xmath0be produced by @xmath0li(p , n)@xmath0be .",
    "the added fraction was evaluated from the known cross - sections [ 10 ] and the fraction of @xmath56li in the target to be less than 0.2@xmath24 and therefore insignificant . + a larger correction to",
    "the extracted cross section can arise from the effect of @xmath3li lost from the target due to backscattering .",
    "this issue is discussed in iii .",
    "a d@xmath15 beam at the 776 kev resonance corresponds to an accelerator voltage of 1.552 mv .",
    "the voltage was calibrated using the known thresholds of the @xmath57c(p , @xmath5 = 9.17 mev)@xmath58n reaction at 1.746 mev and the @xmath0li(p , n)@xmath0be reaction at 1.88 mev which are close to the d@xmath15 and p beam voltages .",
    "in the course of this experiment it became apparent that under some conditions the backscattering of recoil nuclei out of the target can be significant and can affect the cross section measurements . in order to obtain a quantitative estimate of these effects , the propagation of the reaction products of the @xmath0li(d , p)@xmath3li and @xmath0be(p,@xmath5)@xmath3b reactions was simulated with the aid of the trim [ 11 ] code .",
    "we have also determined these effects experimentally for the ( d , p ) reaction .      for the @xmath0li(d , p)@xmath3li reaction one has to take into account the broad angular distribution of the protons [ 12 ] ( and",
    "the @xmath3li recoils ) and also to evaluate the loss of the backscattered @xmath0be s from @xmath0li(p , n)@xmath0be reaction , used as a standard ( see section ii ) .",
    "one can then infer the total effect of backscattering loss on the cross - section measurement .",
    "calculations were carried out for lif targets on pt , ni and al backings at 776 kev deuteron energy .",
    "the results presented here are an average of simulations of reactions occuring at three positions in the lif target . at a given depth in the lif target",
    "the energy and angular distribution of @xmath3li ions were evaluated and used to obtain the angle and energy distributions of the backscattered @xmath3li ions from trim .",
    "the backscattered nuclei were then traced in the direction opposite to the beam to obtain the number of ions leaving the target .",
    "a similar procedure was carried out for the backscattered @xmath0be from the @xmath0li(p , n)@xmath0be reaction for the proton beam energy of 1.99 mev . the angle and energy distributions of the neutrons ( and the @xmath0be recoils )",
    "were taken from ref 13 .",
    "the results of the trim simulation are shown in table ii .",
    "as we see from the table , the effect of backscattered particles can give rise to a sizeable correction for high z substrates .",
    "similar backscattering effects also exist for the @xmath0be(p,@xmath5)@xmath3b reaction . in this case ,",
    "the kinematics of the reaction is much simplified as the @xmath3b nuclei from the proton - capture reaction all proceed in the proton - beam direction with the same center - of - mass momentum . as an example",
    "we have performed calculations which duplicate the conditions of ref .",
    "2 . in that experiment",
    "the target was electroplated on polished pt disks and contained 7 @xmath59 g of solid material with 11@xmath24 of @xmath0beo [ 14 ] . for low proton energy ,",
    "the number of backscattered particles depends very strongly on the ( unknown ) target composition .",
    "two hypothetical trial cases are shown in fig .",
    "the first is for @xmath0beo dissolved in pure iron ; the second case is for a hypothetical composition of equal number of cuo , cu@xmath15n@xmath60 and c molecules .",
    "the latter composition has been chosen following the statement in ref .",
    "14 that the solid materials remaining after the plating and flaming procedure are most likely to be traces of light metal oxides , nitrates and carbon .",
    "it is obvious from fig .",
    "4 that heavy atoms in the target and target backing should be avoided as much as possible in precision measurements of the @xmath0b(p,@xmath5)@xmath3b cross section .",
    "we have used several lif targets with al and pt backing materials in order to probe experimentally the backscattering issue .",
    "the results of the cross section measurements for five targets , together with the backscattering fraction as calculated by trim , are presented in table iii .",
    "the error of each measurement is about 5@xmath24 ( table i ) .",
    "the experiments yield a 9.1(2.2 ) @xmath24 difference between the 400 @xmath61 lif on pt and the lif on al targets .",
    "the relative error for the two types of targets is smaller than the individual errors since it does not include the common uncertainties of the @xmath0li(p , n)@xmath0be cross section and the @xmath5-detector efficiency .",
    "the trim simulations are in good agreement with the experimental results .",
    ".5cmas the final result of the @xmath0li(d , p)@xmath3li cross section we have adopted an average of the two aluminum - backed targets , believed to be free from the backscattering loss .",
    "we get : @xmath62[@xmath0li(d , p)@xmath3li ] = 155(8 ) mbarn . + a recommended value for this cross section",
    "is given in ref . 1 : @xmath62 = 147(11 ) mbarn .",
    "this value is based on four measurements , two of which should be corrected for backscattering loss . based on the available target details as presented in the respective publications , we estimate the corrected value to be in the range 150 - 152 mbarn , very close to our value .    previous measurements of the @xmath63be((p,@xmath1b cross section are also susceptible to backscattering losses . in particular , the results of ref .",
    "2 should be corrected for both the @xmath0be(p,@xmath5)@xmath3b and the @xmath0li(d , p)@xmath3li reactions .",
    "the @xmath0be(p,@xmath5)@xmath3b reaction was measured at various energies and , as can be seen from fig .",
    "4 , the backscattering correction diminishes at low energies .",
    "the @xmath0li(d , p)@xmath3li reaction at the resonance energy was then used by the authors to obtain the number of @xmath0li , and hence @xmath0be , atoms in the same platinum - backed target . since the correction due to this is a @xmath64 which is of the opposite sign and larger than the @xmath3b corrections ( table ii and fig .",
    "4 ) , the overall effect is to reduce the derived s factor , especially at lower energies .",
    "we would like to express our sincere thanks to ygal shahar for his expert help in operating the van de graaff accelerator and in constructing the beam line .",
    "we wish to thank meir birk and moshe sidi for designing and constructing the raster scanner , and leo sapir and boris levine for the target preparation .",
