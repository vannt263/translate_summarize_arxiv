    "thermal leptogenesis @xcite explains the observed matter - antimatter asymmetry of the universe in terms of neutrino masses that are consistent with neutrino oscillation experiments . in its simplest version ,",
    "the primordial lepton asymmetry is generated by the @xmath1 violating interactions of @xmath2 , the lightest of the heavy majorana neutrinos , the seesaw partners of the ordinary neutrinos .",
    "typical values for the @xmath2 mass and for the leptogenesis temperature are @xmath3 @xcite .    in supersymmetric theories such high reheating temperatures cause the ` gravitino problem ' for heavy unstable gravitinos @xcite .",
    "however , if the gravitino is the lightest superparticle ( lsp ) , this problem can become a virtue since for typical leptogenesis temperatures and for superparticle masses of the electroweak scale , thermal production of gravitinos can explain the observed amount of dark matter @xcite . the dominant contribution from qcd processes",
    "is given by @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the reheating temperature while @xmath6 and @xmath7 are gravitino and gluino masses , respectively ; the coefficient @xmath8 to leading order in the gauge coupling @xcite .",
    "has an @xmath9 uncertainty due to unknown higher order contributions and nonperturbative effects @xcite .",
    "resummation of thermal masses increases @xmath10 by about a factor of two @xcite . ]",
    "hence , for @xmath11 and superparticle masses characteristic of gravity or gaugino mediation one indeed obtains the observed amount of dark matter , @xmath12 @xcite .",
    "thermal leptogenesis is consistent with a reheating temperature @xmath5 much larger than @xmath13 , which is not the case for thermally produced gravitino dark matter .",
    "consistency of these two mechanisms for the origin of matter and dark matter then requires an explanation of why @xmath13 and @xmath5 have the same order of magnitude .",
    "successful leptogenesis , independent of initial conditions , favours the mass window @xmath14 @xcite for the light neutrino masses . for an effective neutrino mass @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is the dirac neutrino mass ,",
    "the decay width of the heavy majorana neutrino @xmath2 becomes @xmath17 where we have used @xmath18 for the vacuum expectation value of electroweak symmetry breaking .",
    "if the hot phase of the early universe is initiated by the decays of particles with decay width @xmath19 , the reheating temperature is given by @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the effective number of relativistic degrees of freedom and @xmath22 is the planck mass .",
    "if reheating occurs through the decay of @xmath2 neutrinos , one obtains @xmath23 which is indeed the temperature needed for thermal leptogenesis and gravitino dark matter .",
    "this observation raises the question whether in the thermal bath produced by heavy majorana neutrino decays both , the matter - antimatter asymmetry and gravitino dark matter , can be simultaneously produced . in the following",
    "we shall present an example which demonstrates that this is indeed possible .",
    "in supersymmetric extensions of the standard model the superpotential for matter fields including right - handed neutrinos reads @xmath24 where we have used @xmath25 notation for ordinary quarks and leptons , @xmath26 counts the generations and @xmath27 denote the charge conjugate of right - handed neutrinos ; @xmath28 , @xmath29 and @xmath30 are the electroweak and @xmath0 symmetry breaking fields , respectively , @xmath31 the heavy majorana neutrinos are given by @xmath32 .    for the yukawa couplings we shall use a representative model @xcite with a froggatt - nielsen @xmath33 flavour symmetry , which is consistent with the observed hierarchical quark and lepton masses , thermal leptogenesis @xcite as well as constraints from flavour changing processes @xcite .",
    "their order of magnitude is given by @xmath34 where the chiral @xmath33 charges are listed in table  [ tab : charges ] ; the parameter @xmath35 is determined by the hierarchy of quark and lepton masses .",
    "using the seesaw mass relation and the estimate @xmath36 , successful thermal leptogenesis determines the mass of the lightest heavy majorana neutrino , @xmath37 @xcite . from @xmath38 one then obtains @xmath39 .",

    "for instance , since @xmath49 and @xmath50 involve different yukawa couplings , the ratio @xmath51 can easily vary by two orders of magnitude . since this ratio will be important in the following phenomenological analysis , we shall parametrize this uncertainty explicitly by the effective neutrino mass @xmath52 introduced in eq .",

    "note that for @xmath55 , the estimate @xmath56 corresponds to the maximal possible @xmath1 asymmetry @xcite .",
    "for smaller heavy neutrino masses the asymmetry is reduced by the mass ratio , @xmath57 .",
    "the vacuum energy of a phase with unbroken @xmath0 symmetry can drive a period of inflation , which then rapidly ends due to the spinodal growth of long wave - length modes , a process known as ` tachyonic preheating ' @xcite .",
    "the true vacuum is reached at a time @xmath58 after inflation @xcite , @xmath59    during this phase transition the energy of the false vacuum is converted mostly into a nonrelativistic gas of @xmath30 bosons , with an admixture of heavy neutrinos whose contribution to the energy density is determined by their coupling to the higgs field @xcite , @xmath60 here @xmath61 and @xmath62 with @xmath63 . for the neutrinos @xmath47 one obtains @xmath64 the fraction @xmath65 and it is therefore negligible .",

    "technical details of the solution and a systematic study of the parameter space compatible with leptogenesis and gravitino dark matter will be presented in a forthcoming publication @xcite .",
    "the various components of the energy density and the comoving number densities are compared as functions of the scale factor @xmath119 in fig .  1 and fig .  2 , respectively . immediately after the end of tachyonic preheating the decay of @xmath72 and @xmath73 generates radiation , an initial @xmath0 asymmetry and subsequently a thermal abundance of @xmath2 neutrinos . at @xmath120 , the @xmath30 bosons decay .",
    "the produced @xmath2 neutrinos are relativistic , but nonthermal . at @xmath121 ,",
    "the thermal @xmath2 neutrinos reach thermal equilibrium , the initial @xmath0 asymmetry is washed out , a new @xmath0 asymmetry and the dominant part of radiation are produced in decays of the nonthermal @xmath122 neutrinos .",

    "the corresponding expression for the present gravitino abundance is given by @xmath130 where @xmath131 is the critical density .",

    ", the absolute neutrino mass scale is thus related to the gravitino mass .",
    "the case of rapid conversion is also realized in leptogenesis from inflaton decays @xcite . here",
    "the reheating temperature is determined by the decay width of the inflaton .",
    "one can then have @xmath142 and in this way avoid overproduction of gravitinos . for larger",
    "inflaton decay widths reheating temperatures @xmath143 can be reached , associated with larger baryon asymmetries @xcite , similar to the situation described in this paper .",
    "we have shown that reheating the universe by heavy majorana neutrino decays can simultaneously explain the cosmological baryon asymmetry and the observed dark matter abundance in terms of thermally produced gravitinos .",
    "starting from an initial state of unbroken @xmath0 symmetry , tachyonic preheating leads to an interplay of nonthermal and thermal leptogenesis , which is controlled by the heavy neutrino decay widths .",
