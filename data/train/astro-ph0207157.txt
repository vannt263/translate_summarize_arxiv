    "blazars are the best laboratory to study the physics of relativistic jets .",
    "the non - thermal continuum amplified by relativistic beaming ( e.g. , urry & padovani 1995 ) , is a unique tool to probe the physical processes acting in the jet . in the last decade",
    "the interest for blazars has been renewed by the egret discovery of 66 blazars ( hartman et al .",
    "1999 ) as strong @xmath1-ray emitters .",
    "in several cases the @xmath1-ray emission dominates the apparent bolometric luminosity .",
    "moreover the short variability timescales , together with the absence of absorption of high energy photons ( through the @xmath2-pair production ) , directly imply that the @xmath1-ray emission is also relativistically beamed ( e.g. dondi & ghisellini 1995 ) .    despite",
    "the large variety of classifications , there is growing evidence that blazars form a single population .",
    "their different spectral properties can be unified within a spectral sequence in which the leading parameter is the total luminosity ( fossati et al .",
    "1998 ) . at the high - luminosity extreme of the sequence we find the flat spectrum radio quasars , the most luminous blazars , characterized by the presence of bright emission lines in the optical - uv spectrum and , in some cases , strong _ uv bumps _ , signatures of the underlying accretion process ( e.g. pian et al .",
    "1999 and references therein ) .",
    "most of the blazars detected by egret ( hartman et al .",
    "1999 ) belong to this sub - class but not all fsrqs with comparable seds have been detected in the @xmath1-ray domain .    in the study of fsrqs , observations in the x - ray band play a fundamental role . the x - ray emission from fsrq",
    "is dominated by the continuum originating from inverse compton scattering between relativistic electrons in the jet and the soft photons produced by the disk and/or in the broad line region ( dermer & schlickeiser 1993 ; sikora , begelman & rees 1994 ) . the possibility to measure the ic component yelds important constraints on the emission models .",
    "moreover the study of the soft x - ray spectrum ( below 1 kev ) provides insight on the presence of intrinsic absorption , on the possible contribution of the high energy end of the synchrotron emission or on the minimum energy of emitting particles .",
    "the latter point is particularly interesting because the determination of the minimum energy of particles is a fundamental step in the estimate of the total power transported by the jet ( e.g. celotti , padovani & ghisellini 1997 ) .",
    "the _ beppo_sax satellite has the unique capability of covering the wide energy range @xmath3 kev . for this reason it is ideal to study fsrqs .",
    "in particular the knowledge of the spectrum in this band , together with the @xmath1-ray spectrum measured by egret , provide the most complete spectral information on the high energy component ( see e.g. , tavecchio et al . 2000 , hereafter paper i ) .",
    "for these reasons we started an observational program with _",
    "beppo_sax of a sample of fsrqs , ( containing a total of 50 sources ) extracted from the 2-jy sample by padovani & urry ( 1992 ) . using the flux threshold @xmath4jy",
    "the number of sources reduces to 19 . in paper",
    "i we discussed the case of three fsrq detected by egret , namely 0836 + 710 , 1510 - 089 and 2230 + 114 . here",
    "we report the analysis of @xmath0sax data of 6 other sources , 3 detected by egret and three without an egret detection . adding these 6 sources to the 3 fsrqs analyzed in paper i and other 3 sources ( 3c279 , 0528 + 134 , pks 0537 - 441 ) discussed elsewhere ( maraschi et al . 1998 ; ghisellini et al . 1999 ,",
    "pian et al . , in prep ) a total of 12 fsrqs ( out of 19 with x - ray flux @xmath5jy ) from the 2 jy sample were observed by @xmath0sax .",
    "the sources discussed here are listed in table 1 .",
    "partial and preliminary results were reported in maraschi & tavecchio ( 2001 )    the paper is organized as follows : in section 2 we report the analysis of _",
    "beppo_sax observations , in section 3 we discuss the emission models for the seds and finally in sect .",
    "4 we discuss our results .",
    "the scientific payload of the @xmath0sax satellite ( see boella et al .",
    "1997 ) contains four coaligned narrow field instruments ( nfis ) and two wide field cameras .",
    "two of the nfis use concentrators to focalize x - rays : the low energy concentrator spectrometer ( lecs ) has a detector sensitive to soft - medium x - ray photons ( 0.1 - 10 kev ) , while the medium concentrator spectrometer ( mecs ) can detect photons in the medium energy range 1.3 - 10 kev .",
    "the phoswich detector system ( pds ) , sensitive from 12 up to 200 kev , consisting of four identical units , uses rocking collimators so as to monitor source and background simultaneously with interchangeable units .",
    "we will not be concerned here with the fourth nfi , a high pressure gas scintillation proportional counter ( hpgspc ) .",
    "the _ beppo_sax journal of observations is reported in table 2 , with exposure times and observed count rates .",
    "none of the sources showed significant flux variations during the observations .",
    "we therefore obtained a cumulative spectrum for each source .",
    "we analyzed the _",
    "beppo_sax spectral data using the standard software packages xselect ( v 1.4b ) and xspec ( v 11.0 ) and the september 97 version of the calibration files released by the @xmath0sax scientific data center ( sdc ) . from the event files we extracted the lecs and mecs spectra in circular regions centered around the source with radii of 8@xmath6 and 4@xmath6 respectively",
    "( see the sax analysis cookbook ) .",
    "the pds spectra extracted with the standard pipeline with the rise - time correction were directly provided by the @xmath0sax sdc .",
    "we used pds data rebinned with s / n@xmath7 .",
    "for the spectral analysis we considered the lecs data in the restricted energy range 0.1 - 4 kev , because of known unsolved problems with the response matrix at higher energies .",
    "background spectra extracted from blank field observations at the same position as the source were used .",
    "we fitted rebinned lecs , mecs and pds spectra jointly , allowing for two variable different normalization factors to take into account uncertainties in the intercalibration of different instruments ( see sax cookbook ) .    the first model chosen for the fitting procedure was in all cases a single power law plus galactic absorption . in the following we discuss in detail the results for each source",
    "the results of the spectral fits are summarized in table 3 and 4 .",
    "the residuals of a simple power - law model to the lecs+mecs data show the presence of a prominent absorption feature , located at @xmath8 kev , ( see fig.1 ) and an excess at about 5 kev .",
    "inspection of the individual mecs2 and mecs3 spectra reveals that the emission feature at 5 kev is present only in the data obtained with the mecs3 indicating an instrumental origin .",
    "only the mecs2 data are used below .",
    "the low energy feature can be modeled either with an absorption edge ( @xmath9 ) or with an absorption trough ( @xmath10 ) with comparable probability ( @xmath11 ( @xmath12 ) and @xmath13 ( @xmath14 ) , respectively ) .",
    "however these features find no obvious interpretation at the redshift of the source .",
    "we then tried a warm absorber model ( absori of xspec ) , at the redshift of the quasar , obtaining a satisfactory fit ( @xmath15 ) .",
    "the fit requires a column density of the absorber equal to @xmath16 @xmath17 and an ionization parameter @xmath18 , providing a reasonable physical interpretation .",
    "the results of the fits are reported in table 4 .",
    "previous rosat ( sambruna 1997 ) and asca ( kubo et al .",
    "1998 ) spectra show a power - law x - ray spectrum with photon index @xmath19 , similar to that found with .",
    "notably these observations ( with comparable flux ) showed a smooth continuum , without any evidence for spectral features .",
    "the pds / mecs normalization factor required by the data ( @xmath20 ) is well above the 90% upper limit ( 0.93 ) given by the sax cookbook .",
    "0208 - 512 is located in a rich field : although the lecs and mecs images do not show other sources , a search using the nasa extragalactic database reveals the presence of 13 sources catalogued as qsos or x - ray sources , within a circular region with radius 1 deg centered on our target .",
    "it is then possible that the high - energy spectrum is contaminated by one or more sources present in the fov ( @xmath21 deg ) of the pds .    in the fit presented here the pds data are not included .",
    "the lecs+mecs spectrum is well fitted by an absorbed power - law ( @xmath22 [ 1.73 - 1.85 ] ) with column density consistent with the galactic value .",
    "previous x - ray observations with exosat ( @xmath23 , pian et al .",
    "1996 ) and rosat ( @xmath24 , sambruna 1997 ) are consistent with our results .",
    "a power law model ( @xmath25 ) with galactic absorption fits the mecs+pds data for @xmath26 kev up to @xmath27 kev .",
    "the inspection of the lecs image reveals the presence of several sources ( not present in the mecs image ) : in particular a low - luminosity seyfert galaxy , ngc 6212 , located 5@xmath6 away from the quasar hence within the standard extraction region of the lecs data .",
    "we conclude that the lecs spectrum could be contaminated by the presence of other sources close to 1641 + 399 .",
    "in fact the residuals of a fit with an absorbed power - law model of the lecs data alone ( @xmath28 , @xmath29 ) show large scatter around the model ( fig.3 ) , with the presence of possible features ( with no straightforward interpretation ) at energies @xmath30 kev and below @xmath311.0 kev .",
    "the features can not simply be modeled as due to absorption of the continuum by a warm absorber at the redshift of the source .",
    "a clear soft excess , interpreted as the hard tail of the uv bump , was present in the rosat data discussed by sambruna ( 1997 ) .",
    "an absorbed power - law with galactic absorption provides a good fit to the data .",
    "our spectrum ( @xmath32 ) is steeper than that measured on one occasion by ginga ( @xmath33 , lawson et al .",
    "moreover we do not confirm the rosat observations that seem to indicate an absorption column higher than the galactic value at the 99% confidence level ( sambruna 1997 ) .",
    "a power - law with intermediate spectral index ( @xmath34 ) fits well the data .",
    "the rosat observation reported by siebert et al .",
    "( 1998 ) showed a very steep spectrum , with @xmath35 and a flux about 2.5 times larger than during our pointing .",
    "given the large flux variation , the steep spectrum measured by rosat could possibly represent intrinsic spectral variability possibly due to the high energy end of the synchrotron component , extending up to the soft x - ray band .      as shown in table 3 a fit with a power - law model and galactic absorption",
    "gives an unacceptable fit to the data .",
    "using a free value for @xmath36 the fit improves significantly , requiring a column density higher than the galactic value at the 99% confidence level ( see the contour plot in fig.4 ) .",
    "the value of the required absorption column density in the quasar rest - frame is @xmath37 @xmath17 .",
    "an acceptable fit ( @xmath38 ) of the low - energy portion of the spectrum can also be obtained with a broken power - law model ( and galactic column density ) , with a very flat ( @xmath39 ) soft spectrum .",
    "this , as in the case of other sources ( e.g. 0836 - 710 , paper i ) , could be due to an intrinsic break in the continuum . from a statistical point of view",
    "both models have almost the same probability .",
    "using @xmath0sax and historical data we assembled the seds of the sources , shown in fig.5 .",
    "egret data are the average over the available observations as given by hartman et al .",

    "xie et al .",
    "( 1999 ) report a variability amplitude in the @xmath40-band @xmath41 mag ( which is shown in fig .",
    "5 ) , while for the other 2 sources the variability observed is rather small ( less than 1 mag . ) . for 0208 - 512 and 0521 - 365",
    "we report only the data we could find in literature .",
    "both sources have iue data .",
    "references to the data are reported in the figure caption .",
    "the double - humped shape of the spectral energy distribution ( seds ) is widely interpreted as due to synchrotron - inverse compton emission . the low energy component is synchrotron radiation from a population of relativistic electrons , while the high energy component is believed to be produced through inverse compton scattering of soft photons by the same electrons ( although other scenarios have been considered , e.g. hadronic models , see mannheim & biermann 1992 ) .",
    "the nature of soft photons involved in the ic process is still debated . in blazars where thermal features ( emission lines , the _ blue bump _ ) are weak or even absent ( as in bl lac objects ) the energy density of target photons",
    "is probably dominated by those produced by synchrotron ( ssc model , e.g. maraschi , ghisellini & celotti 1992 ) , while in powerful quasar ( fsrq ) photons coming into the jet from the external environment form the dominant population ( ec model , dermer & schlickeiser 1993 ; sikora , begelman & rees 1994 ) .",
    "we have reproduced the overall seds using a synchrotron - inverse compton ( ssc+ec ) model .",
    "the source is modeled as a sphere with radius @xmath42 , tangled magnetic field with intensity @xmath40 , in motion with bulk lorentz factor @xmath43 at an angle @xmath44 with respect to the line of sight .",
    "relativistic effects are then regulated by the relativistic doppler factor , given by : @xmath45^{-1}$ ] . usually for blazars @xmath46 , implying @xmath47 .",
    "relativistic electrons emit through synchrotron and ic mechanisms .",
    "ic emissivity is calculated taking into account the full klein - nishina cross - section ( following the jones 1968 treatment ) .",
    "the electron energy distribution is modeled with the form : @xmath48 where @xmath49 is a normalization factor , @xmath50 is the break lorentz factor , @xmath51 and @xmath52 are the spectral indices below and above the break , respectively .",
    "this particular form for the distribution function has been assumed on a purely phenomenological basis , in order to describe the curved shape of the sed .",
    "the external radiation field is modelled as a black - body peaking at @xmath53 hz and energy density @xmath54 .",
    "the last quantity is calculated assuming that the radiation , with total luminosity @xmath55 ( @xmath56 , usually assumed to be @xmath57 is the fraction of the central emission reprocessed by the broad line region ) is diluted into a sphere of radius @xmath58 . for 2251 + 158 which shows a clear uv bump we take @xmath59 , while for the other cases we inferred @xmath60 from the luminosity of broad emission lines , following the approach used by celotti et al .",
    "luminosities are reported in table 5 .",
    "the value of @xmath58 has been choosen to fit the observed data , but we checked that it is close to the value expected from the relation between the luminosity of the blr and the radius derived ( for radio - quiet quasars ) by kaspi et al .",
    "the external radiation energy density is amplified in the blob s rest frame by a factor @xmath61 ( e.g. ghisellini et al .",
    "moreover , as pointed out by dermer ( 1995 ) ( and confirmed by georganopoulos , kirk & mastichiadis 2001 ) , because of relativistic effects the beaming pattern of the ec radiation is narrower than that of the ssc emission .",
    "when @xmath62 ( as assumed here ) , the amplification is the same for both processes .    with these assumptions the model",
    "is well constrained by the observation and we can obtain fairly robust estimates of the principal physical quantities in the jet ( see paper i ) .",
    "the values of the parameters used to reproduce the seds are reported in table 5 . in all cases",
    "the bulk of the ic component is reproduced with the ec emission , while in some cases the ssc spectrum ( peaking at lower energies ) partly accounts for the low energy portion of the x - ray spectrum .",
    "the cut - off in the synchrotron spectrum around @xmath63 hz is due to self - absorption .",
    "clearly the adopted one - zone model can not account for the radio emission , widely considered to be due to the superposition of the emission produced in the outer ( @xmath64 pc ) regions of the jet ( e.g. blandford & konigl 1979 ) .",
    "we have presented the results of the analysis of 6 fsrqs observed with @xmath0sax . the smooth power - law ( @xmath65 ) x - ray continuum is produced through inverse compton scattering on photon external to the jet , except for the `` atypical '' source 0521 - 365 . in the case of two sources , 0208 - 512 and 2251 + 158 , there is evidence of more complex x - ray spectra .",
    "in particular 0208 - 512 shows an absorption feature at @xmath8 kev , that we suggest could be explained allowing the presence of a warm absorption intercepting the emission produced in the jet .",
    "the soft x - ray spectrum of 2251 + 158 shows a clear deficit of photons , consistent either with an intrinsic absorption ( with rest - frame column density @xmath66 @xmath17 ) or an intrinsic break in the continuum occurring below @xmath671 kev . in the latter case",
    "the position of the break could provide important insights into the physics of the jet , in particular regarding the value of the minimum energy of the radiating particles . on the other hand",
    "there is growing evidence that the presence of intrinsic absorption is common in high - redshift radio - loud quasars ( e.g. , reeves & turner 2000 ) .",
    "indeed @xmath0sax observations of two distant ( @xmath68 ) blazars ( fabian et al . 2001a ,",
    "b ) show the presence of huge absorption , with column density of the order of few @xmath69 @xmath17 .    for three sources ( 0208 - 512 , 1641 + 399 and 2251 + 158 ) we detect hard x - ray emission up to @xmath70 kev . for 1641 + 399 and 2251 + 158",
    "the hard x - ray component appears to be the smooth extrapolation of the soft - medium x - ray continuum , while in 0208 - 512 the pds spectrum is likely contaminated by another source present in the large fov of the instrument .",
    "we note however that 0208 - 512 is one of the few blazars detected by comptel ( blom et al .",
    "1995 ) and because of its exceptionally intense flux in the mev band is considered as a prototype of the so - called `` mev blazars '' .",
    "therefore we can not completely exclude the possibility that the spectral component responsible for the mev flux contributes also in the pds band , explaining the observed excess .",
    "the modelling of the seds shows that fsrqs ( except the case 0521 - 365 , see below ) are characterized by jets with doppler beaming factors larger than 10 and magnetic field of the order of @xmath71 g , roughly in equipartition with the emitting electrons .",
    "the size of the emitting region is of the order of @xmath72 cm , consistent with the absence of short - timescale variability ( @xmath73 day ) in this class of blazars .",
    "these results confirm , with a larger sample , the conclusions of paper i    an interesting issue for blazars is the value of the minimum lorentz factor of the emitting electrons , @xmath74 . in paper i",
    "we showed how , from the absence of a spectral break in the soft x - ray continuum , it is possible to infer that the electron energy distribution extends down to @xmath75 .",
    "in fact a break in the ec continuum is expected at the frequency @xmath76 ( e.g. sikora et al . 1997 ) , corresponding to an energy @xmath21 kev ( in the rest frame of the source ) .",
    "we recall that the lack of soft x - ray photons observed in 2251 + 158 ( as for the case of 0836 + 710 reported in paper i ) could be interpreted as due to such intrinsic break in the continuum .",
    "observations with larger signal to noise ( possible with @xmath77 or @xmath78 ) will allow to disentangle the two possible interpretations , intrinsic curved continuum or absorption .    in our fits",
    "@xmath51 , the index of the low energy portion of the electron energy distribution , is smaller than 2 .",
    "clearly such a flat spectrum can not be produced by the cooling of high energy electrons ( in that case ine would expect @xmath79 ) .",
    "on the other hand this spectrum is even flatter than the standard prediction @xmath79 for a population of non - thermal electrons produced through fermi acceleration by a non - relativistic shock ( e.g. blandford & ostriker 1978 ) .",
    "however recent calculations ( see the review by kirk & dendy 2001 ) show that relativistic shocks , such as those likely present in the jet of blazars , could produce extremely flat ( @xmath80 ) spectra .",
    "the case of 0521 - 365 is atypical .",
    "previous observational evidence suggested that the jet forms a relatively large angle with the line of sight .",
    "pian et al .",
    "( 1996 ) , using independent arguments ( in particular the presence of an optical jet , e.g .",
    "scarpa et al .",
    "1999 ) , concluded that @xmath81 .",
    "assuming that the bulk lorentz factor of the emitting plasma is similar to that of the other blazars , @xmath82 , this implies that the emission from 0521 - 365 is weakly boosted ( @xmath83 ) .",
    "the sed reported in fig.5 has been calculated assuming @xmath84 and @xmath85 , implying @xmath86 .",
    "in this situation the x - ray/@xmath87-ray continuum , contrary to the case of the other sources , is dominated by the ssc emission , while the ec spectrum gives only a small contribution in the @xmath1-ray band .",
    "part of the motivation for this investigation was to study the difference between the egret and non - egret sources .",
    "in the whole fsrq sample observed with there are 9 egret sources and 3 sources not detected by egret .",
    "the average x - ray spectral indices ( @xmath88 and @xmath89 for egret and no - egret sources , respectively ) indicate that , within the statistical uncertainty , the x - ray spectral characteristics are similar for both groups . the modelling of the seds confirms the strong similarity between the two groups .",
    "the lack of the egret detection could be attributed to the variability behaviour typical of these sources in the @xmath1-ray band ( e.g. mukherjee et al .",
    "1997 ) rather than to an intrinsic difference in the properties of the jet .",
    "new @xmath1-ray missions ( agile , glast ) will help to further investigate these problems .",
