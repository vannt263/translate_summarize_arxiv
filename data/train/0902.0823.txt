    "gaussian states are building blocks of quantum information processing with continuous variables .",
    "in fact , gaussian states can be generated and processed by means of linear operations . on the other hand ,",
    "successful implementation of quantum information protocols requires efficient tools for the analysis and characterization of the quantum states involved in the experiment @xcite .",
    "the standard approach to characterize optical continuous variables states is to perform homodyne measurements @xcite and reconstruct the measured quantum state on a subspace of the infinitely dimensional space describing a multi - mode quantum harmonic oscillator @xcite .",
    "this approach is rather general and , in principle , can be used for reconstructing both gaussian @xcite and non - gaussian @xcite states . on the other hand ,",
    "such a general procedure becomes inherently inefficient once the set of possible states is restricted .",
    "for example , the knowledge about the gaussian character of the measured state contributes a lot of prior information about the measured subject .",
    "this information can be used for reducing the number of relevant unknown parameters , making the reconstruction ( data inversion ) much simpler , also avoiding problematic issues of the standard approach , such as the rapid growth of reconstruction errors with the size of the reconstruction space @xcite .",
    "the main idea of the present contribution is to point out and exploit formal analogies between the description of gaussian states and that of finite - dimensional quantum states .",
    "based on this analogy we put forward a simple and efficient method for reconstructing gaussian states from homodyne data . since by definition the result of gaussian tomography is a gaussian state , the quality of gaussian fit can also be used to assess how far is the measured state from the family of gaussian states , thus providing an operational definition of gaussianity for quantum states @xcite .",
    "this will be demonstrated upon the application of the method to homodyne data taken on states produced by an optical parametric oscillator close to threshold @xcite .",
    "the paper is structured as follows . in section [ review ]",
    "we review few basics facts related to gaussian states and homodyne detection .",
    "this will be used in section [ reconstruction ] for the formulation of a reconstruction method based on the detection of rotated field - quadrature operator .",
    "the theory is then generalized to multidimensional gaussian states in section [ multimode ] .",
    "experimental results and data analysis are reported in in sec .",

    ", the sampled probability density ( [ p_theta ] ) may be conveniently expressed in the form @xmath23 there are several striking similarities between the reconstruction of spin @xmath24 states and covariance matrices .",
    "indeed , in both cases the state is described by @xmath25 matrices .",
    "the density matrix of the spin @xmath24 state is a hermitian , unit trace , semi - positive matrix , thus leaving three free parameters for its full description .",
    "the covariance matrix is real , symmetric matrix , again fully described by three parameters , constrained to the relation ( [ g - matrix ] ) .",
    "projections of a spin density matrix are conveniently sampled in a stern - gerlach experiment .",
    "similarly , detections of quadrature variables in a homodyne experiment provide sampling of quadrature variances representing projections of a covariance matrix .",
    "indeed , estimated matrix @xmath4 appears only in the variance of distribution ( [ sampled1 ] ) .",
    "single detected event do not say too much , but repeated detections do .",

    "the probability of finding the spin `` up '' is sampled by the number of particles deflected upwards in a stern - gerlach apparatus .",
    "similarly , for gaussian states the variance of a quadrature distribution ( i.e. a projection of the covariance matrix ) is sampled by properly normalized sum of squares of the detected quadrature values .",
    "having mentioned similarities between the two problems let us also identify three important differences between the estimation of a spin @xmath24 system and estimation of a gaussian state :    1 .",
    "the two problems have different underlying statics : binomial statistics for yes - no spin data and @xmath0 distribution for sampled variances ;",
    "2 .   there are slightly different constraints on the estimated quantities : semi - positivity of density matrix for spins and uncertainty relations constraint , stated in the form of the matrix inequality , for gaussian states ; 3 .",
    "the measured quantities have different nature : for spins the sampled probabilities are _ expectation _ values of stern - gerlach outcomes whereas for gaussian states we need sampled variances of the homodyne data , _",
    "i.e _ the information is contained in the data _",
    "noise_.    notice that properties ( ii ) and ( iii ) will be important for the discussion of our main result below .    in order to get a unique reconstruction of the measured gaussian state",
    ", quadrature measurement should be repeated with different settings of phases @xmath35 of the strong local oscillator .",
    "let us assume that each quadrature @xmath36 is sampled @xmath37 times with the results @xmath38 , and denote @xmath39 .",
    "the corresponding log - likelihood reads @xmath40 where @xmath41 . a reconstruction of the signal covariance matrix is then obtained by maximizing the likelihood function subject to the constraint @xmath42 .",
    "let us first consider the extremal equation for the covariance matrix .",

    "this yields @xmath44 where latexmath:[\\ ] ]",
    "the method exposed in the previous section has been applied to homodyne data samples acquired for two different kind of input state : a ( definitely gaussian ) reference vacuum state and slightly non gaussian state , close to squeezed thermal vacuum state , generated by an i - type optical parametric oscillator ( opo ) that operates close to the threshold . in the following ,",
    "we give a brief description of the experimental setup @xcite with particular attention payed to the homodyne detector and the data acquisition system .",
    "the setup can be divided into three distinct blocks : the state source , a below threshold fully degenerated opo , the detector , a quantum homodyne and related electronics , and the , pc based , acquisition board ( see fig .  [",

    "the electronic noise floor is kept @xmath99  db below the shot noise .",
    "mode matching at the bs has been accomplished by spatially filtering the local oscillator ( lo ) beam by a mode cleaner cavity whose geometrical properties match the opo s ones .",
    "the relative phase between the lo and the beam exiting the opo is scanned by a piezo mounted mirror to which a linear voltage ramp is applied ; the ramp is adjusted so to have a 2@xmath100 phase span in the acquisition time .",

    "the data were grouped into @xmath104 phase bins prior to reconstruction .",
    "the purpose of the experiment was to perform gaussian tomography and compare the results with that of the standard homodyne tomography @xcite where no assumption about the gaussianity of the measured state were made .",
    "the comparison of the reconstructed states may be seen as a test of gaussian behavior .",
    "such an approach is superior to a test based on evaluating certain quadrature moments due to the fact that all the relevant moments are encoded in the reconstructed state .",
    "the gaussian analysis starts with evaluating quantities @xmath105 for each phase bin @xmath35 , @xmath106 .",
    "these are used to construct operator @xmath46 appearing in the extremal equation for covariance matrix eq .  .",
    "the following covariance matrices were found for measured vacuum ( v ) and opo ( o ) data : @xmath107 matrix @xmath108 indicates that the reconstructed wigner function of the opo state is slightly rotated with respect to the @xmath109-@xmath110 axes , which are defined by the the phase of the local oscillator .",
    "the squeezed nature of the input signal is revealed by diagonalizing matrix @xmath108 . with that variances of @xmath111 and @xmath112",

    "notice that the reconstructed state is not a minimum - uncertainty state , @xmath113 and so the reconstructed covariance matrix is located well _ inside _ the set of physical covariance matrices , @xmath114 . to summarize the gaussian analysis ,",
    "a squeezed gaussian state is inferred from experimental data whose anti - squeezed quadrature has been contaminated by some classical excess noise . now it is interesting to compare the result of gaussian analysis with that of the generic quantum tomography applied to the same data set . in this case",

    "this conclusion , however , turns out to be incorrect when one is interested in qualitative , rather than quantitative properties of the reconstructed state .",
    "for instance , the shape of the reconstructed wigner function may help to classify the signal as being gaussian or non - gaussian .",

    "there remains a question whether the deviations from gaussian character that may be observed in the generic reconstruction even for large dimensions @xmath115 are real features of the measured state or not .",
    "this possibility may be confirmed or discarded by analyzing the scores ( likelihoods ) achieved by the gaussian and generic reconstructions respectively . here , a direct comparison is not possible due to different natures of involved data .",
    "instead , one may determine how much the quality of the fit degrades by replacing vacuum data with the more noisy opo signal .",
    "for gaussian analysis we find that the log - likelihood of the opo reconstruction is smaller by a factor @xmath125 compared to the vacuum reconstruction .",
    "standard tomography yields a smaller factor of @xmath126 , which indicates that a better fit of the opo signal generated near the threshold is obtained by abandoning the gaussian hypothesis .        in order to test the null hypothesis for our samples ( i.e.",
