    "regular satellites around gas - giant planets are thought to form in a surrounding gaseous disk .",
    "this notion is supported by the near - circular orbits of the moon systems in our own solar system , which are well - aligned to their equatorial - planes , except for irregular satellites that have been captured dynamically .    in analogy with a minimum mass solar nebula @xcite for planet formation",
    ", minimum mass sub - nebula models were introduced for satellite formation ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . for explaining certain characteristics of the galilean moons",
    ", @xcite introduced the so - called _ gas - starved _ disk model and reproduced the ratio between the planet mass and the total mass of the satellite system .",
    "satellite formation around gas giants in a _ solids - enhanced _",
    "minimum mass model was discussed by @xcite and @xcite moreover developed a scenario in _ gas - poor _ environment .",
    "@xcite introduced an inner cavity in a gas - starved disk and found that several moons in a resonance can be formed .",
    "based on this work , @xcite performed n - body simulations and have shown that moons are commonly captured in a 2:1 mean motion resonance outside the cavity and galilean - like configuration can be formed .",
    "in contrast to the _ nebula _ hypothesis , relatively small rocky satellites present today can be well explained by a formation scenario in a tidal spreading disk @xcite .",
    "the model is compelling , but it requires a disk of solid material as the starting point .",
    "such circumplanetary _ `` debris '' _ disks may originate from the capture of planetesimals ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) or from tidal disruption of a previous generation of satellites",
    ". however , larger satellites , especially those that maintain an atmosphere , need gas around them during their accretion .",
    "therefore , it is reasonable to assume that at least some of the regular satellite systems must have originated from gaseous circumplanetary disks ( cpds ) .",
    "when a protoplanet grows to the size of several earth masses in a protoplanetary disk ( ppd ) comparable to the one typically assumed for the early solar nebula @xcite , gas around the planet starts to accrete onto it . at that time , because of the conservation of angular momentum , a rotationally supported disk forms around the planet . on theoretical grounds",
    ", cpds can be observed in many hydrodynamic and magnetohydrodynamic ( mhd ) simulations ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . because of the orders of magnitude difference in spatial scales , however , resolving the very vicinity of the planet in those simulations is still difficult .",
    "@xcite has successfully measured the mass infall rate onto a cpd during the early stage of its evolution , but the long - term evolution remains to be established .",
    "yet , the modeling a cpd fully self - consistently during the full ppd and planetary gap evolution is difficult just like modeling the formation of ppds from cloud - collapse is difficult .    in ppds , the magnetorotational instability ( mri )",
    "is thought to play an important role in facilitating the accretion of the disk gas .",
    "although angular momentum transfer in a cpd was previously expected to be as effective as that in a ppd , sustaining the mri is more difficult in cpds @xcite .",
    "thermal ionization can trigger mri at the inner radii of a cpd if the temperature becomes sufficiently high @xcite . however , in absence of strong mri turbulence , gas accretion may not be efficient enough to prevent a cpd from becoming massive by accumulation of infalling material .",
    "an alternative scenario for angular - momentum transport within the cpd may be provided by a magnetocentrifugal disk wind which has been found to operate sporadically in resistive - mhd simulations @xcite .",
    "it remains to be shown whether cpd winds are equally emerging when including additional micro - physics such as ambipolar diffusion . in any case",
    ", disk outflows are generally competing with infall , and it is unclear how a steady state can be reached for cpds that are still deeply embedded in their parent disks .    if the sub - disk grows so massive as to become gravitationally unstable , spiral arms appear and transfer angular momentum . whether or not the gravitational energy is converted into heat _ in situ _ is still under debate , but supposed the energy deposition is local , the temperature with the cpd can become high .",
    "in such a situation , episodic accretion caused by a combination of the gravitational instability ( gi ) and the mri ( boosted by thermal ionization ) is to be expected . @xcite and @xcite studied this phenomenon in a layered cpd model that is developed in the context of ppds ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "as mentioned earlier , a cpd is likely to become massive in the absence of significant transport of angular momentum , that is if the temperature is insufficient to maintain mri turbulence . in this paper",
    ", we develop an alternative model of the satellite - forming region of cpds considering the mass inflow from the ppd as the dominant factor . because there still is a gap between the spatial scales that can be well - resolved by full - blown 3d mhd simulations and the actual satellite - forming region ( inside a few tens of planet radii ) ,",
    "we pursue the strategy of 1d modeling of the sub - disk by means of an effective description based on results from numerical simulations .    by doing so , in some of our models",
    ", we find a bump in the radial surface density structure .",
    "we will examine whether such a specific location can stop the migration of moons .",
    "given the situation that the innermost moon survives rapid inward type - i migration by convergent migration to the pressure maximum , we investigate the posibility of trapping the second and third moons in a mean motion resonance ( mmr ) .",
    "the inner three of galilean moons are known to be in a 4:2:1 mean motion resonance , a so - called laplace resonance . in some of our models",
    ", we successfully obtained a system in laplace resonance .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "[ sec : cpdmodel ] , we describe our sub - disk model and assumptions and resulting disks are shown in [ sec : disk ] .",
    "we then highlight several models with interesting structure and discuss the orbital evolution of moons in the disks in section [ sec : migration ] .",
    "discussion of the obtained results and a brief summary are given in sections [ sec : discussion ] & [ sec : summary ] , respectively .",
    "the equation for the time evolution of surface density is essentially derived in the same way as in @xcite , but in addition , here we simultaneously solve for the _ temperature _ structure of the embedded sub - disk .",
    "we determine the surface - density profile of the cpd by solving a diffusion equation with an additional source term stemming from mass infall from the parent ppd .",
    "when the sub - disk s angular velocity is taken to be keplerian , the evolution of the surface density is given by @xmath0              + f\\ , ,      \\label{dsdt}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath1 is the radius , @xmath2 is the kinematic viscosity coefficient , and @xmath3 is the mass flux from infall onto the cpd . we employ the standard @xmath4 prescription of @xcite , namely , @xmath5 with @xmath6 being the sound speed and @xmath7 the keplerian rotation frequency .    to determine a prescription for the source term @xmath3",
    ", we adopted the results of a detailed analysis of the 3d high - resolution simulations by @xcite .",
    "even though they employed 11 levels of nested grids , the resolution is insufficient to resolve the vertical structure of the cpd in the innermost several jupiter radii from the planet .",
    "therefore , @xcite measured physical values of infalling material at high altitude , where the infall is supersonic ",
    "the idea being that the infall rate obtained in this way is not affected by the uncertainty caused by the architecture of the cpd further downstream .",
    "the effective mass flux onto a inner part of cpd is @xmath8 ( see figure 15 of * ? ? ?",
    "we assume that the planet has 0.4@xmath9 and lies @xmath10au away from a solar mass star .",
    "based on the values at this distance in the minimum mass solar nebula @xcite , the local surface density and sound velocity of the ppd are @xmath11 and @xmath12 , respectively , where @xmath13 is a scaling factor representing the reduction of the surface density due to gas dissipation . with these values , we obtain the mass infall rate as @xmath14 where @xmath15 is one jupiter radius . as the power - law index of the mass infall rate drops outside @xmath16 hill radii from the planet @xcite , we set @xmath17 at @xmath18 .",
    "the initial value @xmath19 corresponds to the beginning of the mass infall and a smaller value indicates a smaller mass infall rate . since the viscous timescale of the cpd is sufficiently smaller than that of the ppd , we treat @xmath13 as a constant here .    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     systemes in other models are more compact or spread - out compared with the galilean moons , but most importantly , the moons are in the 4:2:1 mmr .",
    "once they are in this resonance , the orbits are locked and the moons migrate together as a system ; the separations of the bodies adjust accordingly , when the whole system moves radially during the evolution of the cpd .",
    "+    figures [ fig : cpd - ep ] and [ fig : cpd - ep - dep1 ] show that the disk is quite hot at this stage . at such high disk temperatures ,",
    "the radial pressure gradient may lead to sub - keplerian rotation velocities . actually , as fig .",
    "[ fig : omega ] shows , the angular velocity is smaller than the keplerian value in the outer part of the disk .",
    "the angular velocity is calculated as @xmath20 , where @xmath21 @xcite .",
    "we assumed keplerian rotation profiles when we derived disk models .",
    "however , since equation ( [ dsdt ] ) is only sensitive to the radial _",
    "slope _ of the angular velocity , the assumption is expected to be acceptable .",
    "hot cpds are suggested by @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite , but it may be difficult to form icy satellites in such an environment . since the outer disk is cooler , moons may gain icy materials simply by migrating in from larger radii .",
    "although fig .",
    "[ fig : b ] shows @xmath22 is positive in @xmath23 for model  4 , for instance , bodies about ten times smaller than io can migrate all the way from the outer radii because @xmath22 for them remains negative at all radii .",
    "another possibility is , that ice - rich planetesimals are captured when they enter into the cpd .",
    "@xcite found that the orbits of sub - io sized planetesimals captured in a cpd are highly eccentric .",
    "they also found that @xmath24 m or larger planetesimals can be efficiently captured in a cpd , thus those bodies may grow into the size of present moons .",
    "one problem is , however , whether the system can survive over the long - term evolution of the cpd . as mass infall decreases",
    ", the temperarure of the disk also decreases .",
    "when the disk structure that traps the innermost body disappears , the satellite system will start to migrate toward the planet .",
    "moons can survive if the cpd is quickly cleared before they are lost into the planet . a rough estimate of the viscous timescale of the disk is @xmath25yr , which is shorter than the migration timescale of the satellites . however , the actual timescale for the surface density to become small enought not to affect satellite migration is most likely to be much longer than this estimate .",
    "clearly , this depends on how the disk dissipate and many other unknown factors . in order to obtain a better understanding of how the infall terminates ,",
    "we need to further study the evolution of ppds including both gap formation and gas dissipation . in this work",
    ", we adopted mass infall rate derived from isothermal hydrodynamic simulations , however , @xcite suggested that taking magnetic field and radiative cooling into account leads to a different mass infall rate , which opens a perspective for future work .",
    "@xcite and @xcite found that the existence of an inner cavity in a cpd can prevent a moon system from being lost onto the planet .",
    "provided the planet rotates differentially ( given that it accretes material with non - negligible angular momentum this is not unreasonable to assume ) and maintains a convective or turbulent sub - surface flow , it can be expected to harbor an efficient planetary dynamo . in this case , such an inner cavity may form due to magnetospheric truncation of the sub - disk by the planet s dipole magnetic field . in the context of ppds ,",
    "not only photoevaporative but also magnetically driven disk wind have been reported to contribute to the formation of so - called `` transition disks '' @xcite with reduced surface density at small radii .",
    "to explore such currently unknown effects in the context of embedded sub - disks , the configuration of magnetic field at the very vicinity of the planet must be studied .",
    "we have modeled massive and comparatively hot cpds by solving the time evolution of surface density with mass infall from the parental ppd .",
    "the mass infall flux was determined based on the high - resolution numerical simulation of @xcite , where we have also considered the reduction of the flux caused by the dissipation of the ppd at the location of the sub - disk .",
    "the temperature profile of the cpd is derived by the balance of viscous heating and radiative cooling , as well as the radial advection .",
    "since the strength of viscosity is uncertain in the absence of mri , we employed a parameter to determine the minimum value of the viscosity .",
    "we considered the mri when the elssasser number exceeds unity due to thermal ionization .",
    "we furthermore monitored toomre s q parameter in order to consider effective viscosity when the value becomes lower than about two .",
    "when the evolution is governed by @xmath26 , the system settles into a steady state .    in many previous studies , the critical temperature for the onset of the mri",
    "is assumed to be at about 1000@xmath27k .",
    "as shown in figure  [ fig : mri ] , however , we found that this is not the case for massive cpds .",
    "this is because of the two reasons : ( i ) the ionization degree needed to sustain the mri in a cpd is higher than that in a ppd , and ( ii ) thermal ionization is less effective in higher density regions . in our models",
    ", mri is turned on by thermal ionization only around t@xmath28k .",
    "we found that opacity transitions change the radial dependence of the temperature structure , and especially , a transition near 2000@xmath27k makes a bump in surface density distribution .",
    "we estimated whether a moon migrating toward the central planet can be trapped at such a location . in the case of some of the parameter settings that are referred to as models 1 - 4 ,",
    "1 , 2 and 4 , the surface - density and temperature gradients were sufficiently steep to stop the migration of a moon .",
    "moreover , we have examined the migration timescales of the second and third moons migrating inward and compared them to the critical timescale to be captured in a 2:1 mmr with the inner moon . in all of models 1 - 4 ,",
    "1 , 2 and 4 , we obtained systems in 4:2:1 mean motion resonance that is known for inner three bodies of the galilean system .",
    "the satellite system obtained in our disk models may or may not survive until the dissipation of the cpd . in order to find out the long term evolution of these systems , futher studies on mass infall from ppds and on the origin of angular momentum transport in cpds are needed .",
