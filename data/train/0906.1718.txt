    "according to greisen , zatsepin and kuzmin @xcite the flux of cosmic - ray protons observed on earth should drop significantly at proton energies exceeding some @xmath2 due to proton interactions with the cosmic microwave background .",
    "this drop in the flux is also known as the gzk - cutoff .",
    "recent results from the pierre - auger observatory support these predictions @xcite .",
    "in addition to the direct measurement of the proton flux , the detection of secondary particles resulting from the gzk mechanism offers a complementary way to investigate this effect . along with other particles ,",
    "the gzk mechanism produces neutrinos via pion and neutron decays .",
    "due to the low flux of expected gzk neutrinos , of the order of @xmath3 @xcite , huge detectors have to be built .",
    "conventional neutrino detectors measure the cherenkov light emitted by secondary particles produced in a neutrino interaction .",
    "such an optical detector would comprise an extremely large number of sensors because the attenuation length ( @xmath4 m @xcite ) of light in water or ice is small .",
    "currently alternative methods of detecting ultra - high energy neutrinos are being investigated @xcite .",
    "one of these methods is acoustic particle detection , for which an upper limit is derived in @xcite .",
    "intensive studies are currently performed at various places to explore the potential of the acoustic detection technique . in a recent survey @xcite , an overview of these experimental activities",
    "the thermo - acoustic model , first discussed by g.a .",
    "askarian in 1957 @xcite , predicts the creation of sound waves produced by an instantaneous energy deposition of a particle cascade in a medium .",
    "the energy deposition results in a local rise of temperature causing the medium to expand ( or contract , depending on the medium s properties ) which in turn creates a sound wave , see fig .",
    "[ fig : sw ] .",
    "neutrino - induced sound wave .",
    "the typical shower length is about @xmath5 m , resulting in a disc - shaped volume , in which the particle - induced signal can be detected.,scaledwidth=49.0% ]    test measurements verifying the model for water were performed using proton and laser beams @xcite and electron beams @xcite .",
    "the signal amplitude is found to depend approximately linearly on the temperature and vanishes at the maximum density thus demonstrating the thermo - acoustic origin of the signal .",
    "an exemplary signal shape expected for a neutrino - induced hadronic shower is presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : sig ] .",
    "simulation of a neutrino induced acoustic pulse for a cascade energy of @xmath6 eev at a distance of @xmath7 km from the source .",
    "the contributions of the energy deposits at distances from the shower axis up to @xmath7 cm and @xmath8 cm and for the whole shower are shown .",
    "adapted from @xcite.,scaledwidth=49.0% ]    the signal is bipolar , with a maximum of the power spectrum at about 15 khz .",
    "the attenuation length of an acoustic signal in water is of the order of @xmath9 m at @xmath10 khz @xcite , yielding a large advantage over the optical method for the required large detector volumes .",
    "+ in this article we describe techniques for data processing and source position reconstruction for acoustic particle detection .",
    "the challenge of acoustic particle detection is not only to develop sensors sensitive enough to detect neutrino - induced acoustic signals .",
    "one essential problem is to separate the signal from the background from a wide range of sources , amongst them pressure changes due to current - induced turbulences , anthropogenic sounds ( e.g. ships ) , wind and precipitation , biological sources ( e.g. dolphins ) and thermal noise .",
    "figure [ fig : noisesp ] shows the power spectrum of the surface - induced noise measured in the deep sea compared to the signal expectation . while the lower frequencies are dominated by wind and waves , the higher frequencies are dominated by the thermal noise @xcite .",

    "integration of the frequency spectrum in the relevant frequency band results in a noise level of @xmath12 mpa .",
    "the expected signal amplitude is around the same value , for signals of a @xmath13ev shower at distances of about @xmath6 m. therefore methods for noise reduction and signal filters have to be developed to enhance the particle detection sensitivity ; examples are given in @xcite . besides increasing the detection sensitivity",
    "one also has to understand the signal contamination resulting from point sources other than neutrinos .",
    "of special interest are sources emitting neutrino - like , bipolar signals .",
    "a prerequisite to ultimately calculate the sensitivity of an acoustic particle detector is thus the knowledge of the density of sources producing bipolar pulses , and the rate of such background signals .",
    "since neutrino - induced acoustic signals are primarily expected in a frequency band of @xmath14 the application of a bandpass filter significantly improves the signal to noise ratio .",
    "simulations of neutrino - induced cascades with energies of @xmath15ev show that a band pass filter alone is sufficient to suppress the background to a level enabling the trigger of a possible signal , e.g. by a simple threshold trigger .",
    "sensitivity for lower energies can be achieved by using the cross correlation : @xmath16\\otimes s)(t)= \\\\ \\int_{-\\tau/2}^{+\\tau/2}d\\tau^ { ' } [ r + s](t+\\tau^{'})s(\\tau^ { ' } )    \\end{split}\\ ] ] where @xmath17 is the expected signal template and @xmath18 is the measured pressure amplitude containing background @xmath19 and possibly a signal @xmath20 .",
    "@xmath21 will have local maxima at times @xmath22 where the signal template matches the recorded data indicating the existence of a signal at a time @xmath22 .",
    "another effective method to further improve the signal to noise ratio is _",
    "stacking_. applied e.g. in geophysics for decades , this method uses arrays of sensors to identify a coherent signal . in the case of uncorrelated noise @xmath19 and a fully correlated signal @xmath20 in sensors",
    "@xmath23 the mean instantaneous signal power is @xmath24 while the mean noise reduces to @xmath25 thus resulting in a signal to noise ratio of @xmath26 where the sums run over the individual signals from all @xmath27 hydrophones and @xmath28 represents the mean .",
    "the @xmath29-dependence is the best - case scenario for completely uncorrelated noise , but clearly indicates the benefit of using a larger number of sensors operated in clusters . in geophysics",
    "this method can be applied passively by reading out the sensors in parallel since the duration of the signal is large compared to the difference in arrival time at the different sensors . in our case an active procedure known as _ beamforming _ has to be used .",
    "this method will be discussed in detail in section [ sec : dir ] . in figs .",
    "[ fig : ex1 ] to [ fig : ex3 ] we demonstrate the application of the introduced methods for signal to noise ratio improvement .",
    "the data for the noise and the signal were simulated assuming a sampling frequency of @xmath30 khz .",
    "the noise spectrum was modeled using the data from fig .",
    "[ fig : noisesp ] for @xmath31 knots knot @xmath32 of wind .",
    "a cascade energy of @xmath33ev at a distance of @xmath30 m and six hydrophones have been assumed .",
    "for this example the signal arrival time is the same for all hydrophones .",
    "figure [ fig : ex1 ] shows the output of a single hydrophone with a signal included at about @xmath34 s. identifying the signal is impossible in this case .",
    "applying a cross correlation significantly improves the signal to noise ratio of a single hydrophone as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : ex2 ] . stacking the output of all six hydrophones",
    "improves the signal to noise ratio to a point where a threshold trigger can be applied , see fig .",
    "[ fig : ex3 ] .",
    "evidently a combination of all introduced methods is useful in order to successfully identify a signal .",
    "the advantage of using clusters of hydrophones in order to identify signals is a promising approach for future detectors .",
    "furthermore , a cluster greatly simplifies the reconstruction of sources , which will be discussed in the next section .",

    "the signal at @xmath34 s becomes clearly visible.,scaledwidth=49.0% ]",
    "reconstructing the position of a point source by a small cluster of hydrophones ( @xmath35 ) becomes increasingly difficult the further the point source is away from the cluster .",
    "however , direction reconstruction is well possible and therefore yields the prime observable for a small cluster .",
    "it is performed by creating a sound intensity plot scanning all directions in space ( @xmath36 ) . given an array of @xmath27 hydrophones with coordinates @xmath37 , the signals @xmath38 of every single hydrophone will be shifted in time corresponding to the difference in path length of the sound wave to reach the respective hydrophone .",
    "hence every direction in space corresponds to a set of time differences @xmath39 in the data . for a direction @xmath40 , the overall signal at the time",
    "@xmath22 is given by @xmath41 where the @xmath42 represent weighting factors for the hydrophones .",
    "these factors can be adjusted to match the directional sensitivity of the hydrophones . in the following calculations",
    "@xmath43 was used .",
    "the time differences @xmath39 are computed assuming a plane wave .",
    "the algorithm scans @xmath36 with a predefined step size by applying the calculated time differences to the data , assuming a constant speed of sound .",
    "once all directions are scanned , the maximum value of the produced output indicates the direction of the signal .",

    "beam - forming output for a set of simulated data including noise and a signal .",
    "the plot shows a clear peak for the direction of the signal .",
    "the antenna configuration is the same as in fig .",
    "the time delays computed for the beamforming procedure depend on the relative positions of the hydrophones in an antenna . modifying the geometrical arrangement of the hydrophones in an antenna will alter its directional sensitivity . in this study",
    "different geometrical setups of six hydrophones were used ( an example is shown in fig . [",
    "fig : hydpos ] ) .",
    "the hydrophone positions of one local cluster.,scaledwidth=49.0% ]    these geometries were evaluated with respect to their directional sensitivity by simulating arrival times of a wave front from all directions in steps of @xmath44 .",
    "noise samples were generated and signals added to the noise corresponding to the time delays for a given direction .",
    "the maximum amplitude @xmath45 of the beamforming output divided by the rms of the output was computed for all given directions .",
    "figure [ fig : s1 ] shows a rather homogeneous reconstruction quality for all directions .",
    "maximum pressure amplitude from the beamforming algorithm divided by the rms of the data , for all directions.,scaledwidth=49.0% ]    the low @xmath45/rms values for @xmath46 and @xmath47 are a result of the symmetry of the detector in the given coordinate system : if a signal comes directly from the top or the bottom of the antenna , all @xmath48 values for the beamforming algorithm are going to contribute with the same value . increasing or decreasing the antenna size by a factor of two creates a negligible difference . as long as highly symmetric or two - dimensional geometries are avoided every setup will produce similar results .",
    "a simple technique for source position reconstruction using a given number of clusters is presented . after the successful application of the beamforming algorithm each antenna @xmath49 with a detected signal will point to a direction @xmath50 identifying where an event came from .",
    "since the cluster positions @xmath51 are known , one obtains a line pointing to the event for each cluster @xmath52 the source position of a signal is in principle given by the intersection point of the lines @xmath53 . due to uncertainties in the beamforming the reconstructed source location",
    "is where the lines are closest to each other .",
    "localising the point of closest approach for all lines is realized by calculating the square distance from a point @xmath54 to the reconstructed lines    @xmath55    and minimising the sum of these distances .",
    "this method was tested for a setup consisting of six antennas and was found to work well for distances up to @xmath7 km from the origin .",
    "the test was conducted as follows : first a source coordinate was defined , from where a spherical sound wave was emitted , propagating through the water at a constant speed of @xmath56 . as sketched in fig .",
    "[ fig : sw ] , a particle - induced sound pulse does not propagate as a spherical wave .",
    "however , since the technique discussed is independent of the radiation pattern a spherical wave was chosen as the most general case .",
    "a depth dependent velocity gradient was neglected because of the short distances evaluated with respect to the bending radius of about @xmath57 km @xcite .",
    "the arrival times of the spherical wave at each single hydrophone were computed and the beamforming algorithm used to determine the directions of the wave onto the storey .",
