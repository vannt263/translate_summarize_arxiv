    "<S> we present the results from the suzaku satellite of the surrounding region of a galaxy cluster , a2744 , at @xmath0 . to search for oxygen emission lines from the warm - hot intergalactic medium ( whim ) , we analyzed x - ray spectra from two northeast regions 2.23.3 and 3.34.4  mpc from the center of the cluster , which offers the first test on the presence of a whim near the typical accretion shock radius ( @xmath1 ) predicted by hydrodynamical simulations . </S>",
    "<S> for the 2.23.3  mpc region , the spectral fit significantly ( @xmath2% significance ) improved when we include and lines in the spectral model . </S>",
    "<S> a comparable whim surface brightness was obtained in the 3.34.4  mpc region and the redshift of line is consistent with @xmath0 within errors . </S>",
    "<S> the present results support that the observed soft x - ray emission originated from the whim . </S>",
    "<S> however , considering both statistical and systematic uncertainties , detection in the northeast regions was marginal . </S>",
    "<S> the surface brightness of the line in @xmath3 was measured to be @xmath4 , @xmath5 for the 2.23.3 , 3.34.4  mpc regions , giving the upper limit on the baryon overdensity of @xmath6 , @xmath7 , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> this is comparable with previous observations of cluster outskirts and their theoretical predictions . </S>",
    "<S> the future prospect for whim detection using the athena x - ifu micro - calorimeter is briefly discussed here . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , we also derived the icm temperature distribution of a2744 to detect a clear discontinuity at the location of the radio relic . </S>",
    "<S> this suggests that the cluster has undergone strong shock heating by mass accretion along the filament . </S>"
