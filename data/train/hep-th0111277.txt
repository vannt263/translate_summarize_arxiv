    "brane - world scenarios , where two or more parallel branes of dimension 3 + 1 are embedded in a `` bulk '' of larger dimension have recently been used in order to construct models of considerable phenomenological interest , both in particle physics and in cosmology @xcite . usually , these models admit an effective 4d description at low energies , where the distances between branes are represented by scalar fields @xmath14 , ( @xmath15 ) , called moduli .    an important example of a brane - world is the randall - sundrum i scenario ( rs ) @xcite , where the bulk is a slice of a 5-dimensional anti - de sitter space ( @xmath10 ) bounded by two branes of opposite tension .",
    "matter fields may be restricted to live on the branes , but in many extensions of the original model some of them are allowed to live in the bulk too @xcite . in rs there is a single modulus , called the `` radion '' , related to the thickness of the @xmath10 slice .",
    "it is given by @xmath16 $ ] , where @xmath7 is the physical interbrane distance , @xmath17 is the @xmath10 curvature radius and @xmath18 is the planck mass .",
    "although in the 5d theory all fields are assumed to have physical masses comparable to @xmath18 , the 4d effective mass of fields living in the negative tension brane , given by @xmath19 , turns out to be much smaller .",
    "this is due to a `` redshift '' effect induced by the ads geometry between the branes .",
    "the exponential dependence of the @xmath20 on @xmath21 can easily explain a large hierarchy between the planck scale and the electroweak scale without the need of invoking very large numbers , which is of course one of the main assets of the rs construction .    in general ,",
    "moduli fields are massless at the classical level .",
    "the reason is that they are introduced by substituting certain integration constants in the classical solutions ( e.g. the interbrane distances ) by slowly varying fields .",
    "since the solutions exist for a continuous range of the integration constants , it follows that the corresponding potential for the moduli must be completely flat .",
    "masslessness , however , is phenomenologically undesirable because it gives rise to long range scalar interactions which are severely constrained by observations , and therefore it becomes necessary to introduce a stabilization mechanism .",
    "needless to say , this can be done in an ad hoc manner , by introducing new interactions determining the equilibrium distances between the branes .",
    "alternatively , it is possible that a suitable mass may be generated by quantum effects .    in the absence of supersymmetry ,",
    "moduli fields tend to develop an effective potential .",
    "of course , this happens already in the simplest kaluza - klein ( kk ) compactification , and even if there are no branes @xcite .",
    "a five dimensional field @xmath22 can be split in an infinite tower of massive kk fields , labeled by a discrete index @xmath23 .",
    "the masses of the kk fields @xmath24 depend on the size @xmath25 of the extra dimension , and because of that an effective potential @xmath26 is generated at one loop . from the 5d perspective , this corresponds to the ( nonlocal ) casimir energy density due to the presence of compact directions .    in most cases , the self - gravity of brane and bulk matter content",
    "induce a warp in the extra dimension .",
    "in this situation the subtraction of infinities in the calculation of @xmath27 is more elaborate than it is in flat space .",
    "in particular , local terms proportional to worldvolume operators on the brane are generated , which may give rise to interesting ( and sometimes surprising ) physical effects .",
    "this paper follows up on our previous work @xcite , where we considered the particular case of the randall - sundrum ( rs ) model .",
    "a curious result @xcite was the absence of logarithmic terms in the effective potential .",
    "as mentioned above , in the 4d effective description , the fields living in the negative tension brane have masses which are proportional to the radion expectation value .",
    "this is reminiscent of the higgs mechanism in the standard model , and naively one might have expected the usual 4d logarithmic effective potential for the radion .",
    "however , we showed that a regularization which would preserve the five dimensional general covariance did not produce such logarithm .",
    "consequently @xcite , it was found that the one loop effective potential is not sufficient to stabilize the radion at a phenomenologically acceptable mass in this model .",
    "several papers have later appeared in the literature @xcite where the effective potential is obtained in dimensional regularization , through certain subtractions corresponding to a renormalization of the brane tensions in the dimensionally extended spacetime .",
    "the results obtained in dimensional regularization were eventually found to coincide with ours , giving an indication that both procedures are in fact equivalent .",
    "the rs model , however , is somewhat special in that the bulk and branes are maximally symmetric , and all possible counterterms amount to renormalizations of the brane tensions",
    ". therefore , in order to unveil the generic properties of the effective potential in the presence of self gravitating branes , the consideration of more general cases seems to be needed .    in this paper",
    "we shall study a more general class of warped brane - world models , in which the bulk is no longer @xmath10 .",
    "the model we consider contains a bulk `` dilaton '' scalar field with an exponential potential which is coupled to the 5-dimensional einstein gravity .",
    "this provides a family of solutions with two classically massless moduli ( a combination of which is the distance between branes ) .",
    "the solutions have a power - law warp factor @xmath28 in place of the exponential warp of the rs model . here",
    "@xmath2 is the proper distance in the extra dimension and @xmath29 is a constant which depends on the parameters in the lagrangian . for @xmath30",
    "this reduces to the heterotic m - theory brane - world of ref .",
    "@xcite , which may perhaps be relevant for the recently proposed ekpyrotic universe scenario @xcite , whereas the rs model is recovered in the limit @xmath31 .",
    "the plan of the paper is the following .",
    "section ii is devoted to the classical dynamics of the model .",
    "after introducing the background solution , in section ii.b we derive the action for the 4d moduli fields .",
    "these are massless at the classical level , due to a scaling symmetry of the 5d action which we discuss in section ii.b .",
    "the hierarchy between the planck scale and electroweak scale is discussed in section ii.c , since in general there are some differences between the present case and the rs case . in section iii",
    "we give a brief account of quantum effects by considering the effective potential induced by a conformally invariant field .",
    "this case is rather trivial , and it properly illustrates the casimir interaction between the branes .",
    "however , it misses the possibility of interesting local terms induced at one loop . section iv deals with the formalism for the calculation of @xmath27 in more general cases , and contains the core of the discussion on renormalization .",
    "we start , in section iv.a , with a digression on the specification of the measure of functional integration in a curved background .",
    "general covariance alone is not sufficient to determine the measure in the present situation , due to the presence of a nontrivial dilaton .",
    "because of that , we shall consider a one parameter family of possibilities , related with each other through dilaton dependent conformal transformations .",
    "sections iv.b , c and d are devoted to dimensional regularization and zeta function regularization , which are shown to give equivalent results .",
    "the explicit calculation of the effective potential in some simple cases is given in section v. the heterotic m - theory model is briefly discussed in section vi .",
    "possible consequences for the stabilization of the moduli are discussed in section vii , and our conclusions are summarized in section viii .",
    "some technical issues are left to the appendices .",
    "the classical background we shall consider in this paper is a 5-dimensional spacetime with a nontrivial background scalar field @xmath32 , which we shall refer to as the `` dilaton '' .",
    "the fifth dimension is compactified on a @xmath33 orbifold with two branes at the fixed points of the @xmath33 symmetry .",
    "the action for the background fields is given by @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the curvature scalar , @xmath36 , where @xmath37 is the 5-dimensional gravitational coupling constant .",
    "we have denoted the induced metrics on the positive and negative tension branes by @xmath38 and @xmath39 , respectively . to find a solution of the equations of motion",
    ", we make an ansatz where the 4-dimensional metric is flat , @xmath40 with a @xmath41-independent scalar field @xmath42 .",
    "the positive and negative branes are placed at @xmath43 and @xmath44 , respectively . under these assumptions ,",
    "the equations of motion for @xmath45 in the bulk become @xmath46 where @xmath47 , a dot represents differentiation with respect to @xmath2 and a prime represents differentiation with respect to @xmath32 .    as shown in @xcite ,",
    "there is a solution of eqs .",
    "( [ eom ] ) for any value of @xmath48 given by @xmath49 where @xmath50 ( constant rescalings of the warp factor are of course allowed , but unless otherwise stated , we shall take the convention that @xmath51 at @xmath52 . )",
    "assuming @xmath53 , the boundary conditions which follow from @xmath33-symmetry imposed on both branes are given by @xmath54 and they are satisfied if @xmath55 are tuned to @xmath56 in the absence of the branes , the spacetime ( [ solution ] ) contains a singularity at @xmath57 .",
    "since we are considering the range between @xmath44 and @xmath58 , this singularity is of course inocuous .",
    "our spacetime consists of two copies of the slice comprised between @xmath44 and @xmath58 , which are glued together at the branes .",
    "hence , the 5-th dimension is topologically an @xmath59 orbifold .    for @xmath30",
    "this solution is precisely the m - theory heterotic brane of ref .",
    "@xcite . on the other hand , the rs case ,",
    "where the bulk is ads and there is no scalar field , can be obtained by taking the limit @xmath31 and @xmath60 simultaneously , while its ratio is kept fixed , @xmath61 defining @xmath62 , we find that in the limit the warp factor becomes an exponential @xmath63 which corresponds to ads space with curvature radius equal to @xmath17 .      for fixed value of the coupling @xmath48 , the solution given above contains only two physically meaningful free parameters , which are the locations of the branes @xmath44 , and @xmath58 .",
    "this leads to the existence of the corresponding moduli , which are massless scalar fields from the 4-dimensional point of view .",
    "in addition to these moduli , the massless sector also contains the graviton zero mode . to account for it",
    ", we generalize our metric ansatz ( [ metricform ] ) by promoting @xmath64 to an arbitrary four - dimensional metric : @xmath65 it is easy to show that @xmath66 , where @xmath67 is the background ricci scalar in five dimensions and @xmath68 is the four - dimensional one . for constant values of the metric and moduli , we have a solution of the equations of motion whose action vanishes .",
    "hence , only the terms which depend on derivatives of the metric or derivatives of the moduli will survive after the five - dimensional integration .",
    "this fact can be used in order to simplify the derivation of the effective action for the moduli , since all terms without any derivatives can be dropped .    in the bulk",
    ", all terms will cancel except for the one which is proportional to the four - dimensional ricci scalar , @xmath68 .",
    "let us consider the contribution from the branes .",
    "the metric induced on the branes is given by @xmath69.\\ ] ] here , and in what follows , the subindices @xmath70 mean that the quantity is evaluated at the _ perturbed _ brane location .",
    "the brane tension terms in the action contain the determinant @xmath71 + \\cdots , \\ ] ] which induces kinetic terms for the moduli . here",
    ", the tilde on the kinetic term indicates that the derivatives are contracted with the metric @xmath72 .",
    "in fact , the five dimensional ricci tensor @xmath35 contains second derivatives of the metric and therefore it is singular on the brane , giving a finite contribution to the action . to handle this contribution",
    "it is simplest to introduce fiducial boundaries in the neighborhood of the branes , were we add ( back to back ) pairs of gibbons - hawking boundary terms .",
    "these have the form @xmath73 where @xmath74 is the trace of the extrinsic curvature of the fiducial boundary near each one of the branes .",
    "the action is separated into two parts .",
    "the first one is a `` bulk '' part , consisting of an integral over two copies of an open set which excludes the branes , @xmath75 , plus terms of the form ( [ ghterm ] ) at the boundaries @xmath76 and @xmath77 .",
    "then there is a `` brane '' part , which includes an integral of the action over the infinitessimal open sets of thickness @xmath78 around the branes , suplemented with terms of the form ( [ ghterm ] ) at the boundaries of these open sets ( these `` brane '' boundary terms sit back to back with the ones used in order to bound the `` bulk '' , and have opposite sign relative to them , since the normal to the fiducial boundary has opposite sign on each side of the boundary . thus the total effect of the boundary terms is to add zero to the action ) . as is well known , through integration by parts the boundary terms absorb the second derivatives in the einstein term @xmath79 .",
    "hence , the singular contribution from the gravity kinetic term on the brane disappears , and in the limit @xmath80 , the only contribution to the action from the interval of width @xmath81 around the branes ( together with the added boundary terms ) , is from the brane tension term itself , but not from the gravity kinetic term . on the other hand",
    ", the bulk contribution has to be supplemented with the boundary terms ( [ ghterm ] ) .",
    "the boundary terms can be evaluated as follows .",
    "consider , for instance the hypersurface which is located at @xmath82 . in terms of the new coordinate @xmath83 ,",
    "the brane is at @xmath84 , and the metric can be written as @xmath85 where we have introduced the lapse function @xmath86 and the shift vector @xmath87 then , the trace of the extrinsic curvature is given by @xmath88\\cr   & = &    \\int dx^4 { \\sqrt{g_+}\\over 2n}\\left [     { \\dot a\\over a}\\ g^{+\\mu\\nu } \\tilde g_{\\mu\\nu }      - { n^\\mu \\partial_\\mu",

    "we neglected the terms which are higher order in in derivatives of the modulus @xmath58 .",
    "as mentioned before , the subindices @xmath70 mean that the quantities are evaluated at the _ actual _ position of the brane , and the expression is in fact nonperturbative in the positions @xmath3 themselves ( although not in the derivatives ) .    substituting the previous expressions into the action ( [ general ] ) , with the addition of the extrinsic curvature terms , and using the background equations of motion we find @xmath89 . \\label{moac}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] this can be rewritten as @xmath90\\right\\}. \\label{moder}\\ ] ] here we have introduced @xmath91 and the four dimensional newton s constant @xmath92 given by @xmath93 the modulus corresponding to the positive tension brane has a kinetic term with the `` wrong '' sign .",
    "however , this does not necessarily signal an instability , because it is written in a brans - dicke frame . one may go to the einstein frame by a conformal transformation .",
    "it is convenient to introduce the new moduli @xmath25 and @xmath94 through @xcite @xmath95 and to define the new metric @xmath96 it is then straightforward to show that @xmath97 $ ] .",
    "substituting into the background action ( [ moder ] ) , we have @xmath98 therefore , both moduli have positive kinetic terms in the einstein frame . at the classical level ,",
    "the moduli are massless , but as we shall see in the following sections , a potential term of the form @xmath99 is generated at one loop , which should be added to ( [ einstein ] ) .    in the rs",
    "limit @xmath100 [ see eq .",
    "( [ ell ] ) ] the kinetic term for one of the moduli disappears .",
    "this is to be expected , because the bulk is the maximally symmetric ads space . in this case",
    "only the relative position of the branes @xmath101 is physically meaningful and the other modulus can be gauged away ( see also @xcite for a recent discussion of this case ) .",
    "matter does not couple universally to the 4d einstein metric @xmath102 .",
    "rather , it will couple to combinations of the metric and the moduli fields . for completeness , in appendix a we give an alternative form for the moduli action in terms of the induced metrics on either brane , to which brane matter fields are universally coupled .",
    "since we are interested in the effective potential for the moduli , it is perhaps pertinent to start by asking why these fields are massless at the classical level .",
    "the reason is that under the global transformation @xmath103 @xmath104 the action ( [ general ] ) scales by a constant factor @xmath105 here @xmath106 is the metric appearing in the action ( [ general ] ) .",
    "acting on a solution with one brane , the transformation simply moves the brane to a different location .",
    "hence , all brane locations are allowed , from which the masslessness of the moduli follows . however , we should hasten to add that this is just a global scaling symmetry which need not survive quantum corrections .",
    "it is interesting to observe that by means of a conformal transformation , we may construct a new metric @xmath107 which is invariant under the scaling symmetry @xmath108 in terms of this new metric the action takes the form @xmath109(\\partial^{(s ) } \\phi)^{2 }          + \\lambda \\right)\\nonumber\\\\      & - & \\sigma_+ \\int d^4x\\sqrt{g^{(s)}_+}\\ ,      e^{-3 c\\,\\phi/2 } -\\sigma_- \\int_{}d^4x\\sqrt{g^{(s)}_- }      \\,e^{-3 c\\,\\phi/2}.      \\label{general2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] now , the symmetry is a mere shift in @xmath32 .",
    "moreover , with our background solutions for @xmath106 and @xmath32 , the metric @xmath107 is just ads , as can be easily shown from ( [ aki ] ) and ( [ solution ] ) .    for certain discrete values of @xmath48 ,",
    "the action ( [ general2 ] ) can be obtained from dimensional reduction of @xmath110 dimensional pure gravity with a cosmological term @xmath111 , where the additional @xmath23 dimensions are toroidal @xcite . in this case , the factor @xmath112 is the overall scale of the internal @xmath23-dimensional volume , and the value of @xmath48 is given by @xmath113 , with @xmath114 it is not surprising , then , that the metric @xmath107 in ( [ general2 ] ) corresponds to the `` external '' components of a @xmath115 dimensional anti de sitter space , since the starting point is in fact pure gravity in @xmath110 dimensions with a negative cosmological term .",
    "the calculation of quantum corrections in this higher dimensional space , and its relation with the calculation of quantum corrections in the effective 5d theory which we consider in this paper , will be reported in a separate publication @xcite .",
    "as mentioned in the introduction , one of the motivations for studying brane - world scenarios has been the search for a geometric origin of the hierarchy between the effective planck scale @xmath18 and the electroweak scale . in the 5d description , all matter fields",
    "are assumed to have masses which are close to the cut - off scale of the theory @xmath116 . and",

    "we shall review this mechanism , including the case of a warp factor with arbitrary power @xmath29 , since there are some minor differences with the rs case .",

    "let us now consider the mass scales of fields which live on the branes .",
    "we expect these fields to couple not only to the metric , but also to the background dilaton @xmath32 .",
    "there are many possible forms for this coupling , but it seems reasonable to restrict attention to those which respect the scaling symmetry ( [ scaling1]-[scaling2 ] ) . for a free scalar field",

    "the function @xmath124 can be reabsorbed in a redefinition of @xmath121 , and thus the relevant warp which determines the hierarchy between mass scales on the positive and in the negative tension branes is the one corresponding to the metric @xmath125 .",
    "our field will be perceived from the point of view of the 4d effective theory as having a mass squared of order @xmath126 notice that there are two different factors which determine the hierarchy between @xmath20 and @xmath18 .",
    "the first one is the warp factor @xmath127 appearing in eq .",
    "( [ massn ] ) , which `` redshifts '' the mass scales of particles on the negative tension brane ( except for @xmath128 , in which case the particles on the negative tension brane appear to be heavier than those on the positive tension brane ) .",
    "this generates the hierarchy in the rs model .",
    "the second one is the possibly large volume of the internal space , which enhances the effective planck scale with respect to the cut - off scale [ see eq . ( [ massp ] ) ] .",
    "this generates the hierarchy in the add model @xcite with large extra dimensions . considering both effects , the hierarchy @xmath129 is given by @xmath130 it is known that without a warp factor",

    "if we allow any coupling of @xmath32 to the mass term for @xmath139 , then any hierarchy can be easily generated for any value of @xmath29 .",
    "] in particular , the heterotic m - theory model , with @xmath30 , does not seem to allow for such possibility .",
    "before embarking on a detailed discussion of renormalization , we shall consider in this section the case of a conformal bulk field @xmath22 .",
    "this case is rather easy to handle , and it is useful in illustrating the non - local contribution of the vacuum energy to the masses of the moduli .",
    "unfortunately , it misses possibly interesting effects which may arise due to renormalization of local operators on the brane , whose discussion we defer to the next sections .    following the discussion given in ",
    "iii of @xcite , we define the conformal coordinates by @xmath140 and we rewrite the metric as @xmath141 where @xmath142 here we should mention that the direction of increasing @xmath143 does not coincide with the direction of increasing @xmath2 when @xmath144 .    the casimir energy density @xmath145 of the conformally coupled scalar field in this spacetime is related to its counterpart in a flat spacetime with a compactified extra dimension ( @xmath146 in the above metric ) by a conformal transformation . the relation is @xmath147 , where @xmath148 is the flat space value : @xmath149 here @xmath150 and @xmath151 are the position of the positive and the negative tension branes in the conformal coordinate @xmath143 .",

    "must somehow be cancelled by some other term in order to have an acceptable four dimensional cosmological constant . also , the slope of the potential has to be cancelled at the place where the radion sits .",
    "these two conditions can be imposed if we allow for a finite renormalization of the brane tensions , which contribute proportionally to @xmath164 and @xmath165 for the positive and negative tension branes respectively . with these additions",

    "hence the mass of the radion induced by this quantum correction is given by @xcite @xmath172 again , in the last equality , we have taken @xmath17 to be similar to the planck scale .",
    "the radion mass is much lower than the electroweak scale and hence it is not enough for a phenomenologically viable stabilization of the radion .",

    ". the situation would be different if the potential took the form @xmath175 as in the coleman - weinberg case .",
    "then , the induced mass @xmath176 would be of the same order as the induced potential .",
    "remarkably , the absence of logarithmic terms seems to extend to the contribution from massive fields too @xcite , and so in the rs case it appears that the radion can not acquire a phenomenologically interesting mass solely from one loop quantum effects .",
    "for the more general case of a power law warp factor , the possibility of an efficient stabilization by quantum effects will depend on the nature of the local operators which are induced by quantum corrections .",
    "we now turn to a discussion of this subject .",
    "in this section we set up the framework for computing the contribution to the 1-loop effective potential from a scalar field @xmath22 propagating in the bulk with a generic mass term , which may include couplings to the curvature of spacetime as well as couplings to the background dilaton @xmath32 .",
    "the effective potential for the moduli @xmath3 will be defined as usual in terms of a gaussian path integral around the background solution . before presenting the actual calculation , however ,",
    "a digression on the choice of the measure of integration will be useful .",
    "a quantum field theory is defined not just by the classical lagrangian , but it is also necessary to specify the measure of functional integration .",
    "the latter is usually prescribed by demanding certain symmetries or invariances .",
    "for instance , for scalar fields in curved space , invariance under diffeomorphisms is an obvious requirement .",

    "nevertheless , it is interesting to do it explicitly since this calculation is closest in spirit to the standard flat space calculations in four dimensions .    adding up the dimensionally regularized effective potential per comoving 4-volume due to all kk modes ,",

    "the divergent part is given by the seeley - dewitt coefficient @xmath585 .",
    "in the present case , since the background is 4-dimensional flat space , @xmath585 consists of only one term proportional to @xmath586 for each kk mode .",
    "subtraction of this counter term for each mode leads to the expression @xmath587 , which is still divergent .",
    "this is not a surprising fact because the problem is essentially 5-dimensional as it is indicated by the existence of the infinite tower of the kk modes .",
    "usually , this point is bypassed in the literature by evaluating the divergent sum with the help of the generalized zeta function .      in section",
    "v , we were interested in the class of conformally related operators @xmath269 , and therefore it was important to do a dimensional extension of the spacetime such that all geometries labeled by @xmath256 would be conformally flat .",
    "in other words , we added dimensions `` parallel '' to the brane , whose `` size '' was also affected by the warp factor .",
    "it should be stressed that this was done for computational convenience , since @xmath297 is independent of the parameter @xmath256 only in this regularization .",
    "putting aside computational considerations , nothing prevents us to extend the spacetime in any way we please , and the results should still be the same . to illustrate this point ,",
    "let us consider an alternative dimensional extension of our 5-dimensional curved space @xmath588 to a simple direct product space given by @xmath589 .",
    "the dimensional regularization is done by an analytic continuation of the number of added dimensions @xmath78 , while the manifold @xmath588 is kept unchanged .",
    "since this is a direct product space , the eigenvalues of the ( @xmath590)-dimensional dalembertian are given by a simple summation of those in each space , @xmath588 and @xmath591 , @xmath592 then , the dimensionally regularized effective potential per unit comoving volume is given by @xmath593 this quantity is evaluated by introducing the function @xmath594 where @xmath595 is the zeta function defined in ( [ zepsilon ] ) with @xmath274 . then , using ( [ 5dzeta ] ) , we can rewrite ( [ 5dv ] ) as @xmath596 the above expression contains the object @xmath595 , which we have encountered in zeta function regularization .",
    "however , it should be noted that now the regularization parameter is not @xmath334 , the argument of the function @xmath597 , but the dimension of the product space @xmath78 .",
    "therefore , even after we take the limit @xmath329 , @xmath598 still diverges as @xmath298 .    the divergent piece in the dimensional regularization in the @xmath199 dimensional problem is the seeley - dewitt coefficient @xmath599 . from ( [ zepsilon ] ) and ( [ sdw ] ) , it is easy to relate this divergent piece with the value of @xmath600 as has to be evaluated in the regularized @xmath601-dimensional space .",
    "however , since the added @xmath78 dimensions are trivial , it is identical to @xmath602 . ]",
    "@xmath603 subtracting this divergent piece from ( [ 5dregeffpot ] ) , we obtain the renormalized value @xmath604 where @xmath605 is euler s gamma .",

    "the result ( [ skippy ] ) involves the two constants @xmath421 and @xmath421 .",
    "although the actual value of this constants seems to be irrelevant , since they can be shifted by finite renormalization of worldsheet operators , we will nevertheless for the sake of completeness give their definition in terms of the parameters of the model .",
    "we can express the asymptotic expansion of the combinations of modified bessel functions used in subsection [ sec : nonmin ] as @xmath607 since both @xmath608 , and the obsevration that @xmath609 , we can define coefficients @xmath610 for both @xmath611 and @xmath612 as @xmath613 defining the functions @xmath614 the coefficients @xmath421 and @xmath420 are defined as @xmath615          - r^i(\\rho)\\right ) ,   \\nonumber \\\\      { \\cal i}_k&=&-\\gamma \\beta_{4}+\\int_{0}^{\\infty } d\\rho\\ , \\rho^{3 }      \\left(\\ln\\left[\\sqrt{2\\rho/\\pi}\\ , e^{\\rho}k_{\\nu}(\\rho)\\right ]          - r^k(\\rho)\\right).\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]",
    "the behaviour of @xmath407 defined in ( [ calvo ] ) for @xmath435 is given by @xmath616 this corresponds to a large separation between branes . in this limit",

    ", @xmath620 is the usual riemann s zeta function @xmath621 . using the relation @xmath622 and substituting in ( [ veffnonmin2 ] ) ,",
    "we find that in the limit of small brane separation , the effective potential reduces to the one we had found in the massless conformally coupled case , given in equation ( [ ve1 ] ) : @xmath623 equation ( [ zetap ] ) is a particular case of a more general formula @xmath624 valid for positive integer @xmath23 .",
    "this can be derived from the perhaps better known relation @xcite @xmath625 by setting @xmath626 after differentiation of both sides of the equation with respect to @xmath143 .",
