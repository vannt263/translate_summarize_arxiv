    "the kondo effect was discovered experimentally in the 1930s @xcite and was theoretically explained first in the 1960s @xcite . however , the kondo problem and related subjects in many - body problem still evoke considerable interest in various theoretical and experimental researches @xcite .",
    "first , quantum impurity systems show universal critical behavior at low temperature , which is characterized by the ratio of the impurity susceptibility @xmath2 to the impurity specific heat @xmath3 divided by temperature @xmath4 : @xmath5 @xcite .",
    "we call it the wilson ratio .",
    "it was exactly shown by the bethe ansatz that it is given by 2 for the kondo model @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the effect of an impurity embedded in a one - dimensional interacting quantum system or in a tomonaga - luttinger liquid @xcite has been one of the topics evoking considerable interest during the 1990s and during the last decade .",
    "it has been investigated by different methods such as renormalization group techniques @xcite , conformal field theories ( cft ) @xcite , numerical techniques with cft @xcite , and the bethe - ansatz method @xcite .",
    "recently , it is studied by functional renormalization group @xcite and also experimentally in a quasi - one - dimensional conductor @xcite .",
    "however , it is still rare that the finite - temperature thermodynamic behavior is explicitly and exactly shown by a theoretical method for a large but finite lattice system without making any approximation or assumption .    in this paper",
    "we study the finite - temperature behavior of an integrable model of the spin-1/2 anti - ferromagnetic xxz periodic chain with a spin-1/2 impurity and make an additional report to ref . @xcite .",
    "in particular , we investigate how the crossover temperature @xmath6 for the impurity specific heat @xmath3 depends on the impurity parameter @xmath7 and show that the @xmath7-dependence of crossover temperature @xmath6 is consistent with the analytic expression derived by setting the impurity susceptibility @xmath2 to be proportional to the inverse of the crossover temperature : @xmath8 . here",
    "the impurity parameter @xmath7 is related to the coupling strength between the impurity spin and other interacting spins . in the xxz impurity model",
    "we can exactly study the effect of an impurity embedded in the interacting quantum spins in one dimension , while in the kondo model the effect of an impurity coupled with itinerant electrons in three dimensions .",
    "the xxz impurity model and its variants have been investigated by many authors .",
    "schlottmann studied the integrable spin-@xmath9 xxz spin chain with one spin-@xmath10 impurity @xcite in association with the multi - channel kondo effect @xcite .",
    "the spin-1/2 impurity in the open spin-1/2 xxx chain was studied by frahm and zvyagin @xcite and it was shown that the kondo - like temperature exists , while the periodic xxz chain with an impurity was studied by eckle et al . @xcite .",
    "the thermodynamic behavior of the spin-1/2 impurities in the spin-1/2 xxz chain was shown in ref .",
    "@xcite for several distributions of the impurity parameters . however , the analytic expressions of the impurity susceptibility and the impurity specific heat at low temperature in ref .",
    "@xcite are not accurate enough to evaluate the wilson ratio correctly , in particular , when the impurity parameter is small .    the integrable model of the spin-1/2 xxz periodic chain with a spin-1/2 impurity studied in ref .",
    "@xcite corresponds to the case of @xmath11 in the xxz impurity model of ref .",
    "the finite - temperature behavior of the integrable xxz impurity model is investigated by numerically solving the truncated integral equations of the thermal bethe ansatz @xcite and evaluate the specific heat and the entropy numerically @xcite . by plotting graphs of the impurity specific heat @xmath3 versus temperature @xmath4 and those of the impurity entropy versus temperature @xmath4",
    ", it is shown that the impurity spin gradually becomes a free spin through pseudo - decoupling from other spins , while in low temperature it couples strongly to them such as the kondo effect @xcite . here",
    ", we call it _ pseudo - decoupling _ , if the exchange coupling between the impurity spin and other spins is very small but nonzero .",
    "it occurs in the present model when the absolute value of the impurity parameter is very large .",
    "it is shown that the wilson ratio at low temperature is given by @xmath12 for the spin-1/2 anti - ferromagnetic xxz periodic chain with a spin-1/2 impurity , where the xxz anisotropy parameter @xmath13 is given by @xmath14 ( @xmath15 ) @xcite .",
    "it is independent of the impurity parameter @xmath7 if its absolute value is small enough with respect to the given temperature .",
    "thus , the hamiltonians of the xxz impurity model with the same xxz anisotropy parameter @xmath13 but different values of impurity parameter @xmath7 are classified in the same universality class @xcite .",
    "the contents of the paper consist of the following . in section 2",
    "we derive the expression of the xxz impurity hamiltonian in terms of the local spin operators @xmath16 .",
    "we show that the ground - state energy evaluated by diagonalizing the xxz impurity hamiltonian expressed in terms of the local spin operators is consistent with that obtained by solving the bethe ansatz equations numerically for several different values of the impurity parameter . in section 3",
    "we review the analytic expression of the impurity susceptibility at zero temperature derived by the wiener - hopf method in ref .",
    "in section 4 , after we briefly review the method for evaluating the specific heat via the thermal bethe ansatz in ref .",
    "@xcite , we plot the graphs of the impurity specific heat versus impurity parameter @xmath7 for five different values of temperature @xmath4 .",
    "we then show numerically that the crossover temperature @xmath6 as a function of impurity parameter @xmath7 is derived by setting the inverse of @xmath6 to be equal to impurity susceptibility @xmath17 : @xmath18 with some constant @xmath19 .",
    "finally , in section 5 we give concluding remarks .",
    "we now formulate the integrable spin-1/2 anti - ferromagnetic xxz chain with a spin-1/2 impurity through the algebraic bethe ansatz .",
