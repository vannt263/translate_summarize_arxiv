    "<S> it is suggested that quantum entanglement emerges from the holographic principle stating that all of the information of a region ( bulk bits ) can be described by the bits on its boundary surface . </S>",
    "<S> there are redundancy and information loss in the bulk bits that lead to the nonlocal correlation among the bulk bits . </S>",
    "<S> quantum field theory overestimates the independent degrees of freedom in the bulk . </S>",
    "<S> the maximum entanglement in the universe increases as the size of the cosmic horizon and this could be related with the arrow of time and dark energy .    </S>",
    "<S> the nonlocal quantum correlation ( quantum entanglement ) is nowadays widely treated as the valuable physical resource exploited in quantum information processing applications such as quantum key distribution and quantum teleportation  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , the origin of this mysterious phenomenon is unknown . </S>",
    "<S> if states of a composite system can be transformed into the product form @xmath0 by a basis transformation , the state are called separable . </S>",
    "<S> a quantum system is entangled , if its state is not separable . note that the superposition rule of quantum mechanics does not automatically guarantees the existence of quantum entanglement . </S>",
    "<S> actually , deciding the separability of a given superposed quantum state is one of the most important open problem in quantum information science .    on the other hand , the holographic principle  @xcite , including the ads </S>",
    "<S> / cft correspondence  @xcite , asserts a mysterious connection between the physics in a bulk and quantum field theory ( qft ) on its boundary surface . </S>",
    "<S> it claims that all of the information in a volume can be described by the degrees of freedom ( dof ) on the boundary of the volume and the number of bits @xmath1 ( times ln 2 ) involved in the description of the bulk must not exceed @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the area of the boundary  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> recently , there are renewed interests in describing gravity with thermodynamics and holography  @xcite </S>",
    "<S> .    there is an unexpected similarity between entanglement and the holographic principle . </S>",
    "<S> for example , in general , entanglement entropy has an area law and the holographic principle involves nonlocality by nature . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , it is possible to study black hole entropy using entanglement entropy  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> ryu and takayanagi proposed a holographic derivation of the entanglement entropy using the ads / cft correspondence  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> interestingly , a superluminal ( i.e. , faster than light ) communication is impossible even with the quantum nonlocality . </S>",
    "<S> these counterintuitive results imply that gravity and quantum mechanics somehow cooperate not to violate each other and there is a deep connection between them .    in this paper </S>",
    "<S> , we suggest that quantum entanglement emerges from holographic principle . t hooft proposed that quantum mechanics has a deterministic theory involving local information loss  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> zeilinger and brukner  @xcite suggested that every well - designed experiment tests some proposition which may return a yes / no answer , and quantum randomness arises from this discreteness of information . </S>",
    "<S> inspired by the digital nature of the holographic principle we assume that both of the bulk and the boundary dof can be treated as binary variables . </S>",
    "<S> we also restrict ourselves to pure states for simplicity . introducing mixed states does not change main conclusions .    consider a spherical bulk region @xmath4 in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 1 with radius @xmath5 and a causal horizon @xmath6 such as a black hole horizon . </S>",
    "<S> an inside observer @xmath7 can describe the bulk physics with bulk bits @xmath8 , whereas , according to the holographic principle , an outside observer @xmath9 can fully describe the bulk physics using only the bits @xmath10 on the boundary . </S>",
    "<S> starting from the holographic principle , it is simple to show the existence of quantum entanglement of the bulk quantum states by a proof by contradiction as follows . </S>",
    "<S> + i ) assume there is no entanglement at all in the bulk . </S>",
    "<S> ii ) then , all possible bulk states are product states @xmath11 by the definition of the entanglement . </S>",
    "<S> iii ) the number of independent bulk bits @xmath1 is volume proportional ( i.e. , @xmath12 ) , while the number of boundary bits @xmath13 is of @xmath14 . </S>",
    "<S> iv ) thus , one can not fully describe the bulk physics using only the boundary bits @xmath10 . </S>",
    "<S> v ) this is contradictory to the holographic principle ; therefore there should be some entangled states .     with a radius @xmath5 and a causal horizon @xmath6 . </S>",
    "<S> an inside observer @xmath7 can describe the bulk physics with bulk bits @xmath8 , while , according to the holographic principle , an outside observer @xmath9 can describe the bulk physics with the bits @xmath10 on the boundary fewer than @xmath8 . </S>",
    "<S> this redundancy could be the origin of the quantum entanglement of the bulk quantum states.,scaledwidth=40.0% ]    then , exactly how entanglement arises ? according to the holographic principle there is redundancy in the bulk bits </S>",
    "<S> @xmath8 . </S>",
    "<S> they are not independent of each other . </S>",
    "<S> simply ignoring some bulk bits could not be a solution , because the boundary bits should be able to reproduce arbitrary configuration of the bulk bits , at least probabilistically . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , only possible way seems to be @xmath15 to @xmath16 correspondence between the bulk bits and the boundary bits . </S>",
    "<S> mathematically , this could mean that there is a @xmath17 to @xmath18 mapping @xmath19 . </S>",
    "<S> since the boundary bits should fully describe the bulk bits ( at least probabilistically ) , this mapping is a surjective function .    as a toy example , consider a combination of two bulk bits @xmath20 and @xmath21 which is described by a common boundary bit @xmath22 such that both of @xmath23 and @xmath24 correspond to @xmath25 and both of @xmath26 and @xmath27 correspond to @xmath28 . </S>",
    "<S> some information in the bulk bits is lost during the mapping . </S>",
    "<S> ( this reminds us of the information loss process considered by t hooft in the quantum determinism proposal  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> he introduced equivalence classes of states that evolve into one and the same state . ) now , assume that @xmath28 . </S>",
    "<S> this specific mapping can be represented by a matrix relation @xmath29 where the vector on the left represents the bulk bits in the basis @xmath30 and the vector on the right represents the boundary bits in the basis @xmath31 , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> the 4 by 2 matrix represents @xmath32 . with only @xmath22 value </S>",
    "<S> the outside observer can not distinguish two cases @xmath26 and @xmath27 . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the statistical probability of @xmath22 estimated by the outside observer should be an addition of two probabilities , p_b = p_b((1,0))+p_b((0,1 ) ) , where @xmath33 is the probability that @xmath26 and @xmath34 is the probability that @xmath28 . in the path </S>",
    "<S> integral formalism , for the inside observer this probability could correspond to an entangled quantum state = ( |1|0+|0|1 ) . in ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite it was shown that quantum mechanics is not fundamental but emerges from the information loss at causal horizons , and that this approach even can lead to the holographic principle  @xcite . in the information theoretic formalism </S>",
    "<S> , a quantum state in the bulk corresponds to a statistical probability like @xmath35 estimated by the outside observer who sees the causal horizon . </S>",
    "<S> this formalism supports the correspondence between @xmath36 and @xmath37 .    </S>",
    "<S> we saw that quantum entanglement is unavoidable , once we accept the holographic principle . </S>",
    "<S> the conventional qft overestimates dof in the bulk than are actually present . </S>",
    "<S> then , how can we reconcile this factor with the great success of the conventional qft ? </S>",
    "<S> analysis in this work indicates that qft is valid only for small scales ( like particle accelerator scales ) compared to the horizon size . </S>",
    "<S> this means that , for example , to study cosmology at the large scale we should not fully trust the result of the conventional qft . </S>",
    "<S> dark energy could be a good example . </S>",
    "<S> it is well known that the zero point energy calculated from the quantum vacuum fluctuation is too large compared to the observed dark energy . however , if we invoke the holographic principle and consider only the actual independent dof of @xmath14 , the zero point energy can be comparable to the observed dark energy  @xcite and this could resolve the cosmological constant problem . </S>",
    "<S> in other words , there are only @xmath14 independent harmonic oscillators in the bulk qft . </S>",
    "<S> our theory predicts that in the bulk there should be always entangled states . </S>",
    "<S> the inside observer can make some of the quantum states separable but not all of the states _ at the same time _ </S>",
    "<S> , because the inside observer can not remove the redundancy .    </S>",
    "<S> another interesting implication of our theory is that there are @xmath38 redundancy in the bulk bits and hence at least @xmath38 entanglement among the bits . </S>",
    "<S> this fact implies that the total entanglement inside an expanding horizon increases as time goes . </S>",
    "<S> if the causal horizon is the cosmic event horizon expanding with time , we can say that this increase of entanglement is related to the arrow of time  @xcite . note that this entanglement is different from the entanglement between inside and outside dof of the horizon which is usually of @xmath14 .    </S>",
    "<S> the nonlocality of quantum entanglement is also intimately related to that of the holographic principle . </S>",
    "<S> since the size of the bulk bits are always larger than that of the corresponding boundary bits , some of the correlated bulk bits should be spatially further separated than the boundary bits do . </S>",
    "<S> thus , even if the boundary bits have the locality , the corresponding bulk bits apparently do not . </S>",
    "<S> however , even in this case , entanglement does not allow superluminal communication , because the inside observer can not choose the specific outcome of her / his measurements . </S>",
    "<S> neither the outside observer do influence the bulk bits faster than light . for a fixed outside observer seeing the causal horizons , due to a large redshift </S>",
    "<S> , it takes infinite time for observer s influence to reach the horizons . </S>",
    "<S> alternatively , if the outside observer free falls to reach the horizon , the horizon will disappear and the observer can not access the boundary bits properly </S>",
    "<S> . both of the holography and entanglement are observer dependent phenomena .    in summary </S>",
    "<S> , this paper shows that quantum entanglement is directly related to the holographic principle . in a series of paper@xcite </S>",
    "<S> , it was shown that quantum mechanics , einstein gravity and even holographic principle can be derived by considering phase space information loss at causal horizons . </S>",
    "<S> the analysis in this paper enhance this viewpoint . </S>"
