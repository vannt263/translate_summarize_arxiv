    "the development of quantum information processing have discovered different new techniques which are paving the way to accomplish quantum technological advancement .",
    "@xcite among these advances , spin qubits in quantum dots ( qds ) is certainly one of the most striking systems because of their potential scalability and miniaturization .",
    "@xcite furthermore , electrical readout and control of single spins in quantum dots ( qds ) have been proven very challenging , where spin blockade and charge sensors enable the observation of single / two - spin dynamics.@xcite    more recently , a significant progress in implementing an alternative scheme in double quantum dots ( dqds ) has been attained .",
    "@xcite in this approach , singlet and triplet states of two electrons are used to represent a logical qubit and , by means of this apparatus , a breakthrough experiment shows that a universal set of quantum gates can be reached .",
    "@xcite furthermore , the inter - qubit interaction can be implemented through a capacitively mediated dipole - dipole coupling that exploits differences between charge configurations of singlet and triplet states to control the interaction between logical qubits .    in this work",
    ", we present a theoretical model to describe the dynamics of two singlet - triplet qubits interacting with the environment . by using such a model ,",
    "we are able to quantitatively reproduce experimental results ; thereby , understanding how singlet - triplet qubits in gaas quantum dots interact with their environment .",
    "moreover , we show that qubits are weakly coupled to independent dephasing channels and we reproduce the entanglement dissipative dynamics observed experimentally in ref .  [ ]",
    ". such results can be used as a reference for further studies of open quantum system based on qds .",
    "we study the entanglement dynamics as a function of the temperature , which plays an important role in the characterization of entanglement .",
    "finally , with the correct description of the open quantum system , we exploit the role of the preparation time , _",
    "i.e. _ the time to prepare the necessary initial superposed state , in the entanglement dissipative dynamics .",
    "the present paper is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "ii we present the model that describes the dynamics of the open quantum system based on dqds . in sec .",
    "iii , we present the time local second - order master equation used to determine the reduced dynamics of the quantum states . in sec .",
    "iv , we present the concept of entanglement , measured by concurrence together with results of our theoretical model including a detailed study concerning the coupling constant , the temperature , the environment structure , and the role of the preparation time in the entanglement dynamics .",
    "finally , sec .",
    "v contains a summary of our results .",
    "the main focus of this work is related to the study of the dissipative dynamics of a pair of singlet - triplet ( @xmath0-@xmath1 ) qubits , where the information is stored in the spin state of two electrons .",
    "such states can be experimentally achieved by confining two electrons in each dqd system .",
    "@xcite moreover , the two - level system of a logical qubit ( @xmath2,@xmath3 ) can be isolated by applying an external magnetic field in the plane of the device in such a way that the zeeman splitting makes the parallel spin states @xmath4 and @xmath5 energetically inaccessible .    to extend such a two - level system to a two - qubit system",
    ", it is necessary to couple two @xmath0-@xmath1 qubits , where the tunnelling between them is suppressed and their coupling is electrostatic ( for more details , see ref .  [ ] ) .",
    "thus , the effective hamiltonian for two - qubits system can be written as follows :  @xcite @xmath6,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath7 are the pauli spin matrices , @xmath8 is the identity and the index 1 ( 2 ) is related to first ( second ) qubit ( hereafter , we use units of @xmath9 ) .",
    "this hamiltonian is able to implement universal quantum control , which is given by two physically distinct local operations , @xmath10 and @xmath11 , and by the interaction between the qubits given by @xmath12 .",
    "the exchange splitting , @xmath13 , between @xmath14 and @xmath15 applies rotations in the qubit @xmath16=1,2 around the @xmath11 axis , while rotations around @xmath10 axis are driven by a magnetic field gradient @xmath17 .",
    "moreover , @xmath17 is responsible to prepare each qubit in a superposition between @xmath18 and @xmath19 .",
    "the exchange splitting , @xmath20 , depends on the energy between levels of the left and the right dqd and it can be switched on and off during the quantum dynamics .",
    "@xcite when @xmath20 is different from zero , because of the pauli exclusion principle , the @xmath18 and @xmath19 states have different charge configuration , which makes the state of the first qubit to be conditioned to the state of the second qubit .",
    "in other words , when simultaneously evolving , they experience a dipole - dipole coupling that generates an entangled state . following the experimental steps ,",
    "@xcite each qubit is initialized in the @xmath18-state , then rotated by @xmath21 around the @xmath10 axis when @xmath22 , @xmath23 , for i=1,2 . after this stage , a large exchange splitting is switched on corresponding to @xmath24 , and @xmath25 .",
    "experimentally , it was found that the two - qubit coupling is given by @xmath26 .",
    "@xcite    to include the dissipative dynamics , we suppose that qubits are coupled to a bath of harmonic oscillators .",
    "@xcite such a coupling induces dephasing channels , which are the main source of dissipation in quantum dots .",
    "@xcite thus , the total hamiltonian that computes the environment contribution is given by @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the bath hamiltonian and @xmath29 is the interaction hamiltonian . in this work ,",
    "we want to determine if the environment interacts collectively or independently with the system , _",
    "i.e. _ , if both qubits noise are correlated or not . to verify such correlations ,",
    "we suppose two distinct interaction hamiltonian .",
    "first , the interaction hamiltonian is considered as a common dephasing environment @xmath30 where @xmath31 with @xmath32 and @xmath33 is a complex coupling constant . in the common environment case ,",
    "both qubits interact with a common bath , whose hamiltonian is given by @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the frequency of the @xmath36 normal mode of the bath and @xmath37 ( @xmath38 ) is the creation ( annihilation ) operator of the reservoir field .",
    "superscripts of @xmath39 and @xmath40 refer to collective bath .    in the second case ,",
    "the interaction hamiltonian is composed of independent dephasing environments for each qubit as follows @xmath41 where @xmath42 with @xmath43 and @xmath44 is a complex coupling constant of the @xmath45 qubit . in this case",
    ", we have two independent baths described by @xmath46 where @xmath47 is the frequency of the @xmath36 normal mode of the @xmath45 bath and @xmath48 ( @xmath49 ) is the creation ( annihilation ) operator of the @xmath45 reservoir field .",
    "superscripts of @xmath50 and @xmath51 refer to independent baths .",
    "the purpose of considering independent and common environment is to find a better physical model for the dynamics of the two dqds open quantum system . by comparing our theoretical results with experimental results ,",
    "we are able to extract such informations .",
    "to calculate the dissipative dynamics , we consider a time - local second - order master equation , which is given by @xmath52\\right]}\\right\\},\\label{master}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath53 is the reduced density matrix for two dqds , @xmath54 is the interaction hamiltonian in the interaction picture , namely , @xmath55 , with @xmath56 and @xmath57 . equation ( [ master ] ) is valid in the regime in which the strength of the coupling , expressed in frequency units , multiplied by the correlation time of the bath operators is much less than unity . to consider a collective environment in eq.([master ] ) , we must employ the interaction hamiltonian and the bath hamiltonian given by eqs .",
    "( [ hcol ] ) and ( [ hbcol ] ) ; on the other hand , eqs .",
    "( [ hind ] ) and ( [ hbind ] ) must be used for independent environments .",
    "we also suppose that the oscillator bath density matrix @xmath58 is initially decoupled from the system and it is given by @xmath59 where @xmath60 $ ] is the partition function . here",
    ", @xmath61 , @xmath62 is boltzmann constant , and @xmath63 is the absolute temperature of the environment .",
    "the bath of oscillators is characterized by its spectral density that , in the limit where the number of bath normal modes per unit frequency becomes infinite , it can be defined as @xcite @xmath64 where @xmath65 is a dimensionless constant coupling that describes the strength of the interaction between system and environment and @xmath66 is a cutoff frequency .",
    "in this work , we use the quantum correlation called concurrence to perform the analysis of our results .",
    "concurrence is a well known measure of entanglement , which is broadly accepted to be responsible for a set of important tasks in quantum information theory , such as quantum teleportation @xcite and quantum key distribution @xcite . for two qubits",
    ", there is an analytical solution to concurrence,@xcitewhich is given by @xmath67 where @xmath68 are the eigenvalues of @xmath69 listed in descending order .",
    "@xmath70 is the time - reversed density operator , @xmath71 where @xmath72 is the conjugate of @xmath73 in the standard basis of two qubits .",
    "the initial state of each dqd is set to @xmath74 , then a @xmath21 rotation around @xmath10-axis is performed during the preparation time @xmath75 , which put both qubits in a superposed state @xmath76 . following the experimental description given in ref .",
    "[ ] , we use @xmath77 mk , @xmath78 , @xmath79 , and @xmath80 . the system dynamics can be obtained by numerically solving the master equation ( eq .  ( 7 ) ) .",
    "we perform a systematic analysis to characterize the environment , _",
    "i.e. _ , we seek values for the cutoff frequency @xmath81 , for the constant coupling @xmath65 , and for the common or the independent character of the environment that better describes the experimental data presented in ref .  [ ] . to determine these characteristics , we assume a weak coupling between both dqds and the environment .",
    "in such a regime , the dissipative process is markovian and the cutoff frequency is higher than other controllable field frequencies .",
    "after detailed analysis ( not shown here ) we find , as expected , that low cutoff frequencies are unable to reproduce the experimental data and we checked that all results presented in this work do not change significantly if @xmath82 .",

    "( [ fig1 ] ) , we plot @xmath101 as function of time , considering a common environment coupled to both qubits and assuming different values for the coupling constant @xmath65 , for the experimental temperature @xmath77 mk .",
    "one can see in fig .",
    "( [ fig1 ] ) that the ddse oscillates on time and it has an envelope function which decays faster as the constant coupling is increased .",
    "we also perform an analysis of ddse as a function of time for a fixed coupling constant @xmath103 and different temperatures , which is shown in fig .",
    "( [ fig2 ] ) .",
    "the increasing of the temperature has a similar effect as the increasing of the constant coupling ( fig .",
    "( [ fig1 ] ) ; _ i.e. _ , the higher the temperature , the faster the decay of the envelope function as a function of time . based on results of fig .",
    "( [ fig1 ] ) and fig .",
    "( [ fig2 ] ) , we conclude that the description of common environment for both dqds does not describe the experimental results observed in ref .  [ ] because the ddse do not present negative values , as found experimentally .",
    "furthermore , the concurrence ( positive values of ddse ) theoretically obtained presents a sudden - birth @xcite which is not observed in the experiment .    to provide a better description of such a experimental result",
    ", we also assume independent environments for each qubit .",
    "we choose the experimental temperature @xmath77 mk , in fig .",
    "( [ fig3 ] ) , and we plot the ddse as function of time , considering different coupling constants .",
    "remarkably , for @xmath103 , @xmath104 , there is a very good matching between experimental results ( open circles in fig .",
    "( [ fig3 ] ) ) and ddse extracted from the reduced dynamics obtained for independent environments for each qubit . the experimental data for the ddse , plotted in fig .",
    "( [ fig3 ] ) , achieves its largest value ddse@xmath105 for @xmath106 ns ; also , concurrence ( positive values of the ddse ) is null for @xmath107 ns . the time where the concurrence is maximum can be related to term @xmath108 that couples both qubits , thus its amplitude @xmath20 is connected to the time where the maximum entanglement ( concurrence ) occurs .",
    "such relation is @xmath109 , which gives @xmath110 @xcite in such a case .",
    "numerical solutions for the maximum value of ddse as a function of @xmath96 for @xmath77 mk , @xmath88 , @xmath85 , @xmath111 , and independent environments assumption.,width=302 ]    by means of the correct description of the environment , we can analyze the entanglement dissipative dynamics through our theoretical model .",
    "we begin our analysis focusing on the role of the temperature in the dissipative process . in fig .",
    "( [ fig5 ] ) , we fixed the parameters as the ones that better fit the experimental results and plot the ddse as a function of time , for different temperatures . for @xmath91 k , we see that the electromagnetic vacuum has a negligible effect on the deterioration of the entanglement , which only oscillates as a function of time .",
    "moreover , from fig .",
    "( [ fig5 ] ) , we see that a change of just @xmath112 mk significantly influences the entanglement dynamics and for @xmath94 mk , the entanglement definitely disappears .",
    "we also study the role of the preparation time @xmath96 , _ i.e. _ the time to prepare the superposed state . in the experiment , each qubit",
    "is initially prepared in the @xmath74-state , then rotated by @xmath21 around the @xmath10-axis when @xmath22 to achieve the superposed state@xmath76 .",
    "this rotation around @xmath10-axis is driven by a magnetic field gradient @xmath17 . during the preparation time , the system is interacting with the environment , thereby affecting the entanglement dynamics . to probe such an effect , we study the role of @xmath96 in the maximum value of entanglement during the dissipative dynamics . in the experimental result ,",
    "for example , we have @xmath113 ns , @xmath114ns , and the maximum obtained entanglement is around @xmath115 for @xmath77 mk .",
    "naturally , another crucial aspect to maximize the entanglement between qubits is the exchange coupling between each dqd .",
    "the exchange coupling @xmath20 , which can be increased by controlling the dipole - dipole interaction , determines the time for achieving the maximally entangled state and , the faster the maximally entangled state is prepared , the smaller the environment perturbation . to illustrate the role of the preparation time in the entanglement dynamics , we plot the maximum value of entanglement between the qubits as a function of @xmath95 for a different preparation time @xmath96 in fig .",
    "( [ fig4 ] ) .",
    "as expected , such results show an enhancement of the entanglement when @xmath20 is increased and when @xmath96 is decreased .",
    "this behavior is related to the fact that a maximally entangled configuration is faster achieved for larger @xmath20 but the interaction with the environment disturbs the ideal initialization during the preparation time @xmath96 . to understand how the preparation time affects the maximally entangled state , in fig .",
    "( [ fig6 ] ) , we plot the maximum value of concurrence as a function of @xmath96 for a fixed @xmath116 .",
    "one can notice that the maximum concurrence linearly decreases as a function of @xmath96 .",
    "such results show what are the parameters to enhance the entanglement in @xmath0-@xmath1 qubits .",
    "in summary , we proposed a model to describe a open quantum system composed of two dqds . by employing such a model",
    ", we were able to compare the case where both dqds are coupled to a common environment to a situation where each dqd is coupled its own bath of harmonic oscillators . by performing a systematic analysis of the environment description , we found that the independent environment case agrees with the experimental data shown in ref .",
    "moreover , we study the role of the temperature and of the preparation time in the dissipative dynamics .",
    "we show that the temperature presents a crucial role in the entanglement evolution .",
    "furthermore , we show that the maximally entangled state decays linearly with the preparation time .",
