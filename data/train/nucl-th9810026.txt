    "quantum hadrodynamics ( qhd ) and the relativistic treatment of nuclear systems has been a subject of growing interest during recent years @xcite .",
    "the model of walecka @xcite and its non - linear extensions with cubic and quartic self - interactions of the scalar - meson field @xcite have been widely used to this end .",
    "this model contains dirac nucleons together with neutral scalar and vector mesons as well as isovector - vector @xmath0 mesons . at the mean field ( hartree ) level",
    ", it already includes the spin ",
    "orbit force , the finite range and the density dependence which are essential ingredients of the nuclear interaction .",
    "this simple model has become very popular in relativistic calculations and describes successfully many properties of the atomic nucleus .    from a theoretical point of view , the non - linear model with cubic and quartic scalar self - interactions was classed within renormalizable field theories which can be characterized by a finite number of coupling constants .",
    "however , very recently , generalizations of this model that include other non - linear interactions among the meson fields and tensor couplings have been presented on the basis of effective field theories by serot et al.@xcite .",
    "the effective theory contains many couplings of non - renormalizable form that are consistent with the underlying symmetries of qcd .",
    "consequently , one must find some suitable expansion parameters and develop a systematic truncation scheme .",
    "for this purpose the concept of naturalness has been employed : it means that the unknown couplings of the theory should all be of the order of unity when written in appropriate dimensionless form using naive dimensional analysis @xcite .",
    "then , one can estimate the contributions coming from different terms by counting powers in the expansion parameters and truncating the lagrangian at a given level of accuracy .",
    "one important fact is the observation that at normal nuclear densities the scalar and vector meson fields , denoted by @xmath1 and @xmath2 , are small as compared with the nucleon mass @xmath3 and that they change slowly in finite nuclei .",
    "this implies that the ratios @xmath4 , @xmath5 , @xmath6 and @xmath7 are useful expansion parameters when the effective field theory is applied to the nuclear many - body problem . from this viewpoint ,",
    "if all the terms involving scalar and meson self - interactions are retained in the lagrangian up to fourth order , one recovers the well - known non - linear model plus some additional terms @xcite . for the truncation to be consistent , the corresponding coupling constants should exhibit naturalness and can not be arbitrarily dropped out without an additional symmetry argument . the effective lagrangian truncated at fourth order",
    "contains thirteen free parameters that have been fitted to reproduce twenty - nine finite nuclei observables @xcite .",
    "remarkably , the fitted parameters turn out to be natural and the results are not dominated by the last terms retained .",
    "this evidence confirms the utility of the principles of naive dimensional analysis and naturalness and shows that truncating the effective lagrangian at the first lower orders is justified .",
    "the term with a vector - meson quartic self - interaction has been considered previously in relativistic mean field ( rmf ) calculations from a phenomenological point of view .",
    "bodmer @xcite considered this coupling to avoid the negative coefficient of the quartic scalar self - interaction that appears in many non - linear parametrizations that correctly describe the atomic nucleus @xcite . in some special situations",
    "this negative term can lead to a pathological behaviour of the scalar potential . on the other hand , the equation of state",
    "is softened at moderate high densities when the vector non - linearity is taken into account",
    ". the quartic vector self - interaction has also been phenomenologically used by gmuca @xcite in a non - linear model for parametrizing dirac  brueckner ",
    "fock calculations of nuclear matter .",
    "the same idea was developed by toki et al .  and applied to study finite nuclei @xcite and neutron stars @xcite .",
    "recently , the properties of high - density nuclear and neutron matter have been analyzed in the rmf approach taking into account scalar and vector non - linearities @xcite .",
    "the tensor couplings of the vector @xmath8 and @xmath0 mesons to the nucleon were investigated by reinhard et al .",
    "@xcite as an extension of the rmf model , and more recently by furnstahl et al.@xcite from the point of view of relativistic effective field theory . in these works",
    "it was shown that the tensor coupling of the @xmath8 meson has an important bearing on the nuclear spin ",
    "orbit splitting .",
    "the surface properties of nuclei play a crucial role in certain situations .",
    "this is the case , for instance , of saddle - point configurations in nuclear fission or fragment distributions in heavy - ion collisions . within a context related to the liquid droplet model ( ldm ) and the leptodermous expansion @xcite",
    ", the surface properties can be extracted from semi - infinite nuclear matter calculations either quantally or semiclassically ( though the total curvature energy coefficient can only be computed semiclassically @xcite ) . in the non - relativistic case",
    "most of the calculations of the surface properties have been carried out using skyrme forces , quantally @xcite or semiclassically with the help of the extended thomas  fermi ( etf ) method @xcite . in the relativistic case",
    "the nuclear surface has been analyzed within the model since a long time ago .",
    "the calculations have been performed semiclassically using the relativistic thomas  fermi ( tf ) method or its extensions ( retf ) , for symmetric @xcite and asymmetric @xcite matter , and also in the quantal hartree approach @xcite .    in the framework of the relativistic model and effective field theory ,",
    "the main purpose of the present work is to carefully analyze the influence on surface properties of the quartic vector non - linearity , of the newly proposed scalar - vector self - interactions and of the tensor coupling .",
    "we shall investigate quantities such as the surface energy coefficient , surface thickness , spin  orbit strength , surface stiffness coefficient and neutron skin thickness obtained from hartree calculations of symmetric and asymmetric semi - infinite nuclear matter .",

    "we realize that @xmath65 and @xmath49 are only weakly affected by @xmath66 ( the change is not appreciable in the scale of figure 1 ) .",
    "however , @xmath66 has a direct effect on the scalar - meson quartic self - interaction @xmath38 , moving it from a negative value when the quartic vector term is absent ( @xmath67 ) to a desirable positive value when @xmath68 .",
    "the change of sign of @xmath38 takes place at larger values of @xmath66 for larger @xmath46 and @xmath45 ; in fact , @xmath38 is already positive at @xmath69 if @xmath70 mev and @xmath71 .",
    "both non - linearities of the scalar field @xmath37 and @xmath38 remain in the natural zone for @xmath72 approximately , excepting the case of @xmath70 mev and @xmath71 , but they start to depart appreciably from their natural values when @xmath73 .",
    "these trends fairly agree with the assumption of naturalness : @xmath74 corresponds to the region where @xmath39 can be considered as natural ( see the figure ) , and for this range of @xmath66 values also the rest of coupling constants are natural .",
    "the behaviour gleaned from figure 1 is rather independent of the saturation density @xmath35 and energy @xmath32 , and e.g.  we have found similar trends with the specific nuclear matter properties used by bodmer in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "next we turn our attention to the surface properties . in figures 2 and 3",
    "we have plotted , respectively , the surface energy coefficient @xmath31 and the surface thickness @xmath75 of the semi - infinite density profile ( the 90%10% fall - off distance ) against the @xmath66 parameter .",
    "the selected values of @xmath66 are those employed in table 1 of ref .",
    "@xcite . with @xmath76 @xmath57 and @xmath77 mev ,",
    "we have performed the calculations for a few incompressibilities ( @xmath78 , 200 and 350 mev ) and effective masses ( @xmath79 and 0.7 ) .",
    "furthermore , we have considered two values of the mass of the scalar meson ( @xmath55 and 525 mev ) .",
    "this quantity governs the range of the attractive interaction and determines the surface fall - off : a larger @xmath64 results in a steeper surface and a reduction of @xmath31 and @xmath75 .    from figures 2 and 3",
    "we realize that the quartic vector self - interaction scarcely alters the values of the surface energy coefficient and of the surface thickness if @xmath39 remains in the natural domain , i.e. , if @xmath72 . at @xmath80 mev and @xmath81 , @xmath31 is raised by decreasing @xmath66 .",
    "this tendency may be inverted at smaller values of the incompressibility , depending also on the value of the nucleon effective mass , but the global trends are practically independent of the mass of the scalar meson .",
    "the thickness @xmath75 exhibits a more monotonous behaviour : in all cases it stays almost equal to its value at @xmath69 and goes down slightly for @xmath73 .",
    "noticeable departures of the surface energy coefficient and thickness from the @xmath82 values can be found only if @xmath66 is decreased beyond the natural limit , a situation where the interaction is mainly ruled by the vector - meson quartic self - interaction .    even though the impact of the vector - meson quartic self - interaction is small",
    ", it can help to find parameter sets for which both the surface energy coefficient and the surface thickness lie in the empirical region .",
    "this fact is illustrated in figure 4 , where @xmath31 and @xmath75 are drawn versus @xmath45 for @xmath69 , 2 and @xmath83 and for @xmath84 , 500 and 550 mev , using the nuclear matter conditions of ref .",
    "@xcite : @xmath85 @xmath57 , @xmath86 mev and @xmath87 mev .",
    "( we also performed the calculations for @xmath88 and @xmath89 to confirm the trends we discuss below . )",
    "the horizontal dashed lines in figure 4 serve to indicate the empirical region for the surface energy and thickness .",
    "if at @xmath69 we concentrate , for instance , on the parametrizations with @xmath90 mev we see that the one with @xmath91 yields , simultaneously , @xmath31 and @xmath75 within the empirical region .",
    "the agreement between the calculated values with @xmath90 mev and the empirical region improves for @xmath92 , where both @xmath31 and @xmath75 are acceptable for practically all the values of the effective mass considered .",
    "for @xmath74 the dependence of @xmath31 and @xmath75 upon the nucleon effective mass is similar to that found in the usual model without a quartic vector self - interaction @xcite .",
    "the general tendencies start to change when @xmath66 is lowered and leaves the natural region . as @xmath66 becomes smaller figure 4 shows that the slope of the curves of @xmath31 and @xmath75 as a function of @xmath45 changes , and that the curves for the different @xmath64 come closer together .    to get more insight about the influence of the vector - meson quartic self - interaction , we display in figure 5 the profiles of the baryon density @xmath93 and of the surface tension density ( swiatecki integrand ) @xmath94 , eq.([eq11 ] ) .",

    "results are shown for @xmath69 , 2 and 0.5 .",
    "the corresponding values of the surface energy coefficient and surface thickness can be read from figures 2 and 3 .",
    "it can be seen that the local quantities depicted in figures 5 and 6 oscillate as functions of @xmath9 ( friedel oscillations ) .",
    "both the surface tension density and the single - particle spin  orbit potential are confined to the surface and average to zero inwards as the bulk matter is approached .",
    "the local profiles for @xmath92 , which somehow marks the limit of naturalness as we have commented , are almost equal to those obtained in the absence of the quartic vector self - interaction . in agreement with figures 2 and 3 ,",
    "only when @xmath66 is decreased to non - natural values one can notice some changes in the profiles , which are more visible for @xmath99 than for @xmath71 .",
    "decreasing @xmath66 makes the surface steeper and the thickness @xmath75 smaller , produces an enhancement in the surface region of the density @xmath93 and of the mean field @xmath96 , and builds up friedel oscillations in @xmath100 and in the spin  orbit potential @xmath36 .",
    "it is well known that the experimental spin  orbit splittings require within narrow bounds a dirac effective mass @xmath45 around 0.6 in the conventional relativistic model @xcite .",
    "figure 6 shows that introducing a quartic vector self - interaction makes the spin  orbit well deeper .",

    "the surface properties are not much affected by these bulk terms either , and it turns out that @xmath41 has a marginal effect as compared to that of @xmath40 .    the equilibrium properties do not depend on the couplings @xmath13 and @xmath14 that involve the gradients of the fields . thus , these couplings serve to improve the quality of the surface properties without changing the bulk matter . in the conventional model",
    "the only parameter not fixed by the saturation conditions is the mass of the scalar meson . in the @xmath13@xmath14 plane",
    "the lines of constant @xmath31 have a different slope than those of constant @xmath75 .",
