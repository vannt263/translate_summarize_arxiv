    "since the early days of quantum mechanics , the peculiarities of this theory have not only fascinated and upset physicists , but have also become an issue of popular science . within the realm of scientific everyday - life ,",
    "the formalism of quantum mechanics is often merely applied as a well - oiled tool : as long as it makes correct predictions , many of its users do not need to reflect too much on what is going on behind the scenes . however , since living with the implications of quantum mechanics can constantly pose an intellectual challenge , its puzzling experimental consequences keep popping up continuously in physics literature .",
    "that is to say , because of the bewilderment quantum mechanics produces , numerous experiments have been carried out to put its predictions to the test .",
    "therefore , it is probably one of the best - verified theories of physics .",
    "so far , it has not failed , but  on the contrary  experiments have unambiguously demonstrated the existence of a great many of weird phenomena . among such quantum - optics experiments",
    "are those using electrons @xcite , photons @xcite , ions @xcite , atoms @xcite , large molecules @xcite , optomechanical devices @xcite , superconducting circuits @xcite and cavities @xcite .    a field that was early involved in investigations of quantum mechanics and also inspired many of the later undertakings mentioned above is neutron optics , in particular , neutron interferometry . since its invention in 1974 @xcite ,",
    "numerous pioneering experiments have been carried out doing perfect - crystal neutron interferometry , taking advantage of the macroscopic beam separation of several centimeters to observe ( and exploit ) the wave - like aspect of neutrons @xcite .",
    "a method that  due to its superior resilience against environmental disturbances  complements split - beam experiments , is spin - interferometry @xcite , a principle that bore neutron polarimetry . in the present paper ,",
    "the latter term is understood as comprehending also the spin - manipulation techniques employed in spin - echo spectroscopy @xcite and zero - field spin - echo spectroscopy @xcite . with neutron polarimeters , the interference between spin eigenstates or its entangled degrees of freedom is observed , mostly without spatial beam separation .",
    "the purpose of the present article is to give an overview of the last 15 years progress and development in experimental quantum physics , using neutron optics , with emphasis on neutron interferometry and neutron polarimetry",
    ". here , for space - reasons , relevant ongoing investigations using similar or related methods @xcite had to be spared .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in sec.[sec : devices ] , neutron - optical devices and techniques with relevance to the rest of the paper are discussed .",
    "section[sec : history ] offers a summary of earlier neutron - interferometry experiments , the majority of them beautiful textbook - like demonstrations of quantum - mechanical phenomena .",
    "section[sec : contextuality ] is dedicated to investigations of quantum contextuality ( of which quantum non - locality is a special case ) and multi - partite entanglement of single - neutrons .",
    "ongoing studies of geometric - phase properties are explained in sec.[sec : topologicalandberryphases ] , while sec.[sec : others ] is devoted to special topics , such as a polarimeter study of an error - disturbance relation to complement heisenberg s famous uncertainty relation .",
    "conclusion and outlook are offered in sec.[sec : concl ] .",
    "in 1965 , when semiconductor technology had advanced sufficiently to produce large monolithic silicon perfect - crystal ingots , bonse and hart conceived a single - crystal interferometer ( ifm ) for x - rays @xcite .",
    "this type of ifm was then applied to neutrons resulting in the first interference fringes observed in 1974 by rauch , treimer and bonse @xcite at the 250kw triga - reactor in vienna . in the experiment , a beam of neutrons  massive particles ",
    "is split by amplitude division , and superposed coherently after passing through different regions of space . during this space - like separation of typically a few centimeters",
    "the neutron wavefunction can be modified in phase and amplitude in various ways .",
    "it can be manipulated via nuclear , magnetic , electric or gravitational potentials .",
    "many different types of optical devices can be inserted . in the ifms , neutrons exhibit _ self - interference _ , since at most one single neutron propagates through the ifm at a given time .",
    "the ifm is geometrically analogous to a common mach - zehnder ifm in light optics , as illustrated in fig.[fig : ifmtheory ] .",
    "a neutron ifm consists of a single silicon perfect - crystal , cut in such a way that the incoming neutron beam is split by bragg diffraction at the first plate . for thermal neutrons  with de broglie wavelength of about 2  and silicon - crystals absorption is negligible .",
    "the sub - beams are split again by the second plate . in analogy to the mach - zehnder ifm for light , the second plate is often referred to as a mirror .",
    "elaborate geometries have been used : for instance , the skew - symmetric ifm in fig.[fig : ifmprinziposci](left and center ) has a split second plate to provide more space for samples or neutron - optical devices to be inserted in one of the paths .    at some point in the ifm ,",
    "before the beams are recombined at the last plate ( analyzer plate ) , a phase shifter is inserted such that it is traversed by both beams .",
    "its rotation changes the optical path - difference between the sub - beams and yields intensity oscillations behind the ifm [ see fig.[fig : ifmprinziposci](center and right ) ] .",
    "usually the beams after the ifm are referred to as 0- and h - beam .",
    "the quantum states of 0- and h - beam are both superpositions of the states in the ifm paths as will be shown later in this section . in the standard configuration ,",
    "a monolithic triple - plate ifm [ triple - laue ( lll ) geometry : surfaces of the plates are parallel to each other and perpendicular to the reflecting net planes ] is used .",
    "being split at beamsplitter 1 ( bs 1 ) and recombined at bs 3 .",
    "the phase shifter ps induces a relative phase difference ( @xmath0 ) between the two sub - beams to obtain interference fringes .",
    "right : interference fringes due to rotation of the phase shifter , observed in the 0- and h - beams.,width=566 ]    an intrinsic feature of diffraction by perfect crystals is the extremely small width of the reflection curves of only a few arcseconds .",
    "this presents a particular challenge for the alignment of beamsplitter , mirror and analyzer crystal .",
    "the diffracting planes in all involved crystal slabs must be parallel to a small fraction of an arcsecond and the distance between them must be the same to an accuracy of a few microns .",
    "thus , an elegant way to assure correct alignment is to cut the whole ifm out of a single , monocrystalline silicon ingot .    behind the first plate ( beamsplitter  bs 1 ) the wave function",
    "is found in a superposition of the transmitted ( @xmath1 ) and the reflected ( @xmath2 ) sub - beams , as shown in fig.[fig : ifmprinziposci](center ) . in terms of state vectors ,",
    "that superposition state after bs1 is given by @xmath3 .",
    "the factors @xmath1 and @xmath2 are probability amplitudes with @xmath4 .",
    "as mentioned above , an additional perfect - crystal slab produces an adjustable phase shift and one obtains @xmath5 , where @xmath6 , with the thickness of the phase shifter plate @xmath7 in paths i and ii , the neutron wavelength @xmath8 , the coherent scattering length @xmath9 and the atom number - density @xmath10 of the phase shifter plate . by rotating the plate , @xmath11 can be varied , introducing a phase difference @xmath12 . after passing the mirrors [ termed bs 2 and bs 2 in fig.[fig : ifmprinziposci](center ) ] , the state leaving the ifm at the third plate in directions parallel to the incident beam  the so - called 0-beam  is denoted as @xmath13 .",
    "this yields intensity oscillations described by @xmath14    similarly , the intensity expected in the h - beam is written as @xmath15 with @xmath16 .",
    "the fringe visibility ( or contrast ) of the oscillations is calculated as and can theoretically become 1 in the 0-beam , while it depends on @xmath17 and @xmath18 for the h - beam . in practice",
    ", it is always less than the above theoretical prediction because of unwanted scattering , vibrations , temperature instabilities and the like .",
    "the wave functions corresponding to the state vectors described here are calculated using dynamical theory of diffraction , which is discussed in detail in @xcite .",
    "@xmath19he- and bf@xmath20-gas detectors with high efficiency ( @xmath2199% ) are used for detection of thermal neutrons . in these detectors , the nuclides of the high - pressure filling gas",
    "are converted into charged particles according to , for instance , the following reaction for @xmath19he : n@xmath22he@xmath23h@xmath24p@xmath240.764mev .",
    "it is important to note that the state of a neutron in an ifm can be treated formally as a two - level system , where the two - dimensional hilbert space is spanned by the orthogonal states for paths @xmath25 and @xmath26 , just like spin state - space is spanned by the spin-1/2 eigenstates @xmath27 and @xmath28 .",

    "interestingly , in the arrangement the electrons only travel in regions where all electromagnetic fields  but not the potentials  are zero , which demonstrates the previously unexpected physical significance of the electromagnetic potentials alone . for the vector - potential effect , the induced phase shift merely depends upon the magnetic flux enclosed by the ifm paths and not on the energy of the electrons . due to the latter and the fact that the phase shift is independent of the particular geometry of the ifm paths as long as flux lines are encircled ,",
    "the term _ topological phases _ was coined .",
    "after decades of discussions about the existence of the aharonov - bohm phase ( aharonov - bohm effect ) , conclusive evidence was given in an electron - holography experiment by tonomura _",

    "for instance , by setting the rotation angle of the neutron spin to @xmath106 , one can realize @xmath555 , that is , operations represented by the pauli operators @xmath556 with @xmath557 , in the lab .    in 1997 , a neutron - ifm experiment @xcite demonstrated non - commutability of the pauli spin - operators for a special case : two successive @xmath106-rotations transformed the initial spinor @xmath132 to the final one @xmath133 by applying both the spin rotations @xmath558 and @xmath559 in subsequent runs , where @xmath73 and @xmath74 are the _ mutually orthogonal _ directions of two magnetic field rotation axes .",
    "a phase difference of @xmath106 between the results obtained with the above operations was measured using the ifm setup .",
    "the observed phase difference can be attributed to the geometric nature of spin rotations : different evolution paths from the same initial state to the final state induce the observed phase difference by @xmath106 .    shortly thereafter , another approach using a neutron polarimeter revealed the non - commutability of pauli spin - operators for non - orthogonal directions @xmath73 and @xmath74 @xcite .",
    "the experimental setup is depicted in fig.[fig_nonc](left ) .",

    "the operators for the corresponding @xmath106-rotations are given by @xmath563 and @xmath564 .",

    "a review of the field is given in @xcite .",
    "more than two decades ago , a neutron - ifm layout that is insensitive to the sagnac phase shift , an effect due to the neutron ifm being at rest in a non - inertial ( rotating ) frame of reference @xcite , was conceived @xcite .",
    "the sagnac effect is proportional to the area enclosed by the ifm paths .",
    "the resulting phase shift can be compensated by designing an ifm with crossed paths in the center such that the two paths enclose two equal areas with opposite orientations before and after crossing [ see fig.[fig : pushin2011](left ) ] .",
    "recently , it was noticed @xcite that such an ifm design could also provide remedy for low - frequency , low - amplitude vibrations that usually make elaborate anti - vibration systems necessary for doing perfect - crystal interferometry .",
    "a perfect - crystal ifm was made that can be operated in standard mach - zehnder mode ( three - blade mode ) and in crossed - paths mode ( four - blade mode ) by removing / inserting certain cd beam - blocks , as shown in fig.[fig : pushin2011](left ) .",
    "vibrations of well - defined frequency were induced and the visibility of intensity oscillations was measured for both modes of operation @xcite .",
    "the data shown in fig.[fig : pushin2011](right ) demonstrates resilience of the crossed - paths - mode against such vibrations . in @xcite",
    ", the neutron beam is modelled as a beam of particles bouncing off the bragg - planes of the crystal slabs at a particular instant , acquiring a random phase shift . since one",
    "measures expectation values , the obtained detector signal comprises an average over a distribution of such random phase shifts .",
    "as long as the vibrational spectrum contains only low frequencies , i.e. if the ifm is approximately in the same state of motion while a neutron passes it , all random momentum shifts accumulated from the first slab to the crossing are compensated after the crossing .",
    "the method can also be interpreted in terms of decoherence - free subspaces ( see , for instance , @xcite ) : the four possible paths in the ifm ( without any beam blocks inserted ) span a 4-dimensional state - space . in crossed - paths mode , only the subspace spanned by those two states that are insensitive to vibrations are used @xcite .          a light beam  considered as a superposition of plane waves  experiences a displacement @xmath585 in the plane of incidence along the surface of a totally reflecting medium .",
    "this phenomenon is referred to as goos - hnchen shift @xcite .",
    "it is essentially an interference effect resulting from the slightly different phase shifts the incident plane - wave components undergo upon total reflection by a surface .",
    "these phase shifts depend on the complex reflection coefficient , the angle of incidence and the wavelength .",
    "also , interpretations in terms of energy flux and evanescent waves are discussed @xcite .    for neutrons",
    ", there have been a couple of proposals on how to pin down the sub - micron effect ( see , for instance , @xcite ) .",
    "experimental data was limited to measurements of the reflectivity of magnetized surfaces for up- and down - spin incident beams due to the difference in the optical potential for orthogonal spin states [ see fig.[fig : dehaan2010](left , inset ) ] without explicit reference to the goos - hnchen shift @xcite .    in @xcite , an experiment is described that measured the polarization rotation upon total reflection occurring for an incident beam prepared in a spin superposition .",
    "this rotation is a result of relative phase that the up- and down - spin components accumulate on reflection from a magnetic material .",
    "the relative phase can  in turn  be attributed to the different distances the up- and down - spin components cover within the magnetic material due to the difference in goos - hnchen shifts @xmath589 and @xmath590 for up- and down - spin states .",
    "the results for two subsequent reflections are shown in fig.[fig : dehaan2010](right ) .",
    "the solid line is the theoretical prediction , while data points follow a simulated curve ( dashed line ) that includes a small magnetic anisotropy of the surface as well as a small dispersive phase .",
    "the conclusions drawn were criticized in a comment by ignatovich , who points out that the experiment does not constitute a direct measurement of the goos - hnchen shift because there is no clear - cut relation between larmor precession and @xmath591 @xcite .",
    "the issue is still to be clarified by an experiment that does not rely on the neutron spin and can directly measure the goos - hnchen shift @xmath585 of an unpolarized neutron beam upon total reflection by a non - magnetic surface .     upon total refection of a neutron beam by a material surface .",
