    "as successfully proven for ngc3147 ( bianchi et al .",
    "2008 ) , the key strategy to spot this class of agn is through simultaneous optical and x - ray observations in order to rule out variability as the cause of the optical and x - ray mismatch .",

    "interestingly , q2131 - 427 shows no signs of broad emission line components in its optical spectrum and the faint x - ray spectrum of this source is unabsorbed , with an upper limit on the intrinsic column density of @xmath26 @xmath4 9 @xmath5 @xmath6 @xmath7 , consistent with that from a host galaxy .",
    "this picture is hard to reconcile within the unified model predictions , where the blr is obscured by a toroidal absorbing medium of dust and gas , the former responsible of the optical extinction of the broad emission lines and the latter measurable in x - rays .",

    "the upper limit on the ew of the fek@xmath2 line at 6.4 kev does not rule out the compton thick hypothesis , however this measurement is not reliable , given the low statistics spectrum above 5 kev . instead , the f@xmath35/f@xmath1}$ ] ratio}$ ] has been reddening corrected ( bassani et al .",
    "1999 ) . ] of @xmath19 6 is typical of compton thin sources .",
    "tran ( 2001 ) studied the properties of type 2 seyfert galaxies with polarized ( hidden ) broad - line regions ( hblr ) seen in reflected light compared to the non - hblr seyfert 2 galaxies , introducing the use of a diagnostic diagram involving [ oiii]@xmath145007/h@xmath3 .",

    "as already invoked for the unabsorbed seyfert 2 in panessa & bassani ( 2002 ) , a dust - to - gas ratio 10 - 50 times higher than galactic would be enough to obscure the blr .",
    "however , this is an unlikely scenario as a dust obscuration is often observed to be lower than the associated gas column density ( see maiolino et al .",
    "moreover , the balmer decrement of the nlr , i.e. ( h@xmath2/h@xmath3)@xmath36 @xmath19 4.2 , suggests that the environment is not particularly dusty ( ward et al . 1987 ) and the optical extinction a@xmath37 @xmath19 1.3 mag derived from the balmer decrement is still too small to be able to completely obscure a standard blr .",
    "the hypothesis of a pc and/or sub - pc scale clumpy obscuring medium which results in a variable column density in x - ray spectra ( risaliti et al .",
    "2002 , elvis et al .",
    "2004 , risaliti et al .",
    "2005 , bianchi et al .",
    "2009 ) can not help to explain the complete absence of broad components in the optical spectrum . under the assumption that the x - ray absorption originates from the blr clouds ( see risaliti et al .",
    "2009 ) , we should expect variable column density in the x - ray spectra but still broad emission lines in the optical spectrum , indeed at these spatial scales the gas should be dust - free being within the sublimation radius .",
    "the most likely explanation for the observed optical / x - ray discrepancy is to assume that in this source the blr does not exist or its emission is gradually declining .",
    "indeed , the well documented optical flux decrease may favor the hypothesis that the blr fade away in response to a decrease of the continuum emission .",
    "recent models propose a dependence of the blr properties with luminosity and/or accretion rate ( wang & zhang 2007 , elitzur & shlosman 2006 , nicastro et al .",
    "2003 , nicastro 2000 , williams et al .",
    "according to elitzur & shlosman ( 2006 ) , the classical molecular torus is just the outer part of a clumpy wind that comes out off the accretion disk . at",
    "bolometric luminosities lower than @xmath19 @xmath38 ergs sec@xmath11 , the mass accretion can no longer sustain the cloud outflow rate causing the disappearance of the torus and , at lower luminosities , of the broad line clouds too . according to the above scheme , the absence of a blr in q2131 - 427 is not justified given the high bolometric luminosity ( l@xmath39 @xmath19 8 @xmath5 10@xmath40 ergs sec@xmath11 ) ; however the low eddington ratio measured ( l@xmath41/l@xmath42 = 0.0024 ) may favor the scenario in which the blr is formed in a vertical disk wind originating at a critical distance in the accretion disk , at accretion rates higher than a minimum value ( @xmath43 , nicastro 2000 ) . according to this model , below the critical accretion rate the blr can not be formed . in the case of q2131 - 427 , this is one of the best hypothesis to interpret the observational mismatch , taking into account that the eddington ratio is around this critical value and it is probably affected by uncertainties related to the determination of the black hole mass and of the bolometric correction .",
    "if the blr properties actually depend on the luminosity and/or accretion physics , this must have strong implications for agn unification models and also for population studies of obscured and unobscured agn samples ( e.g. fraction of type 2 objects versus luminosity ) as discussed in elitzur & shlosman ( 2006 ) ( see also wang & zhang ( 2007 ) for an evolutionary sequence of seyfert galaxies ) .      the q2130 - 431 optical spectrum shown here",
    "reveals that this source is a type 1.8 seyfert galaxy , i.e. we detect h@xmath2 and h@xmath3 broad line components ( see figure  [ opt1 ] ) .",
    "the h@xmath2 broad component was not detected by hawkins ( 2004 ) since , at the redshift of the source , the line is shifted out of their optical spectra . also the h@xmath3 broad component was not detected , maybe because it is difficult to identify given its width , being hidden under a galaxy continuum ( see figure 6 in hawkins 2004 ) .",
    "alternatively , it may be variable .",
    "note that the fwhm of the h@xmath3 narrow line component has not varied significantly between 2002 ( @xmath19 426 km s@xmath11 ) and 2006 ( 320@xmath44 km s@xmath11 ) observations .",
    "the simultaneous ultraviolet imaging with the optical monitor , allows us to detect the source in the uvw1 filter ( 245 - 320 nm ) , with a galactic reddening corrected magnitude of @xmath45 , slightly brighter when compared to the last measurement of @xmath46 mag , as shown in the 25 years light curve ( see fig . 8 , hawkins 2004 ) . in x - rays ,",
    "the 2 - 10 kev luminosity of @xmath19 4 @xmath5 10@xmath47 ergs s@xmath11 suggests that this is a typical type 1 seyfert galaxy with a standard photon index ( @xmath27 = 1.8 - 2 ; e.g. , piconcelli et al . 2005 ) and no intrinsic absorption ( @xmath4 2 @xmath5 @xmath6 @xmath7 , at 90% confidence level ) .",

    "our x - ray flux is in agreement with the _ chandra _ one found by gliozzi et al .",
    "( 2007 ) suggesting no particular variability in x - rays .",
    "according to the above observational evidence , q2130 - 431 should not be considered as a pure  naked \" agn , in the sense that it displays optical broad emission line components and , therefore , it has a blr .",
    "however , intermediate type seyfert galaxies are characterized by large balmer decrements consistent with reddening of the blr and determining the 1.8/1.9 spectroscopic type ( osterbrock 1981 ) .",
    "the weakness of the broad balmer lines is often ascribed to dust absorption ( maiolino & rieke 1995 ) and , indeed , moderate absorption is observed in x - rays ( risaliti et al .",
    "1999 ) . in q2130 - 431",
    ", the optical blr balmer decrement of 3.4 ( almost the same value of the nlr balmer decrement ) suggests that the blr does not suffer from heavy reddening .",
    "in addition , in the x - ray spectrum , no absorption has been measured , strengthening the idea that the blr is not obscured and that the weakness of the broad optical lines can be intrinsic , e.g. due to a small amount of gas in the clouds .",
    "a weak blr can be due to a luminosity / accretion rate related disappearance , as suggested for q2131 - 427 .",
    "interestingly the existence of this kind of objects should be hypothesized within an evolutionary sequence , as the one drawn in elitzur & shlosman ( 2006 ) , from type 1 objects to  true \" type 2s .",
    "however , the high x - ray luminosity and the eddington ratio ( l@xmath39/l@xmath48 @xmath19 0.37 ) disfavor the latter hypothesis .",
    "alternatively , the lack of a prominent blr in q2130 - 431 may simply be a peculiar intrinsic property of this object . in both scenarios ,",
    "q2130 - 431 can represent a case of  true \" intermediate seyfert galaxy , in which the blr is intrinsically weak instead of being obscured by dust or gas .",
    "we have obtained quasi - simultaneous x - ray ( xmm - newton ) and optical ( ntt - emmi ) spectra of two seyfert galaxies , q2130 - 431 and q2131 - 427 , belonging to the class of  naked \" agn characterized by hawkins ( 2004 ) and , currently , composed of six members . the strong optical brightness variability and the lack of broad emission line components in their spectra",
