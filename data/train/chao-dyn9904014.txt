    "magnetohydrodynamic ( mhd ) turbulence appears in many problems in nuclear fusion research as well as in astrophysics and geophysics ( see , e.g. refs . 1 and 2 for reviews ) .",
    "compared to the already complicated hydrodynamic turbulence there are additional degrees of complexity due to the presence of a magnetic field , the possibility of dynamos and the action of the magnetic field back on the flow through the lorentz force .",
    "in addition , the distribution of energy among the modes is controlled through the interaction of three cascade processes , related to the three conserved quantities of the dynamical equations in the inviscid limit : the total energy , the cross helicity , and for two dimensions the mean square magnetic potential .",
    "there is , however , a regime where some of the more complicated processes are subdominant or absent and where a rather complete analysis can be performed : two - dimensional ( 2-d ) magnetohydrodynamics with weak magnetic fields .",
    "this regime can be relevant to astrophysical applications , such as quasi - two - dimensional turbulent processes in thin accretion discs.@xcite    the situation we consider is that of a 2-d turbulent flow , maintained by some external force , in which a magnetic field is advected .",
    "the linearity of the equation for the magnetic induction implies that without an external seed field no magnetic field will ever be generated .",
    "moreover , the absence of dynamo action in two dimensions @xcite implies that without permanent driving the magnetic field will die out eventually .",
    "the action of the magnetic field back on the flow can be neglected if the lorentz force is sufficiently weak , i.e. , if the magnetic field is sufficiently small . because of the absence of dynamos in 2-d the amplitude of the external driving controls the magnitude of the magnetic field .",
    "we thus have a regime of kinematic evolution of a magnetic field passively advected by the turbulent flow which can be realized in any 2-d situation for sufficiently small driving of the magnetic field .",
    "the dynamics of the magnetic field and thus its correlation functions are nevertheless nontrivial since a transient growth and the development of fractal like structures on small scales are possible , as evidenced by numerical simulations .",
    "@xcite though the range of applicability of this kinematic approach is limited , it shows some interesting features which we would like to describe here .    on a technical level ,",
    "the restriction to a 2-d situation allows to connect the evolution of the vector potential to that of a scalar field for which detailed scaling predictions exist within geometric measure theory .",
    "@xcite on the assumptions of statistical stationarity , homogeneity , and isotropy for both the magnetic field and the scalar field , geometric measure theory provides a connection between the structure functions of the velocity field and the scalar field .",
    "in particular , the scaling behavior can be related and the dependence on the prandtl number and on another parameter that characterizes the strength of the driving and appears in 2-d only can be extracted . using an exact relation between the correlation function of the scalar and the magnetic field we can transfer these results to the magnetohydrodynamic problem and in particular",
    "discuss the dependence on the magnetic prandtl number .",
    "the latter can range from @xmath7 in the solar convection zone to @xmath8 in the interstellar medium .",
    "@xcite within the kinematic regime we are able to go beyond previous applications of geometric measure theory to mhd turbulence .",
    "@xcite    the outline of the paper is as follows . in sections ii and iii the theoretical background in 2-d magnetohydrodynamics and 2-d passive scalar advection is summarized . for details on the analysis of the 2-d passive scalar within geometric measure theory",
    "we refer to our previous work .",
    "@xcite in section iv both are combined and the correlation and structure functions of magnetic fields in the kinematic regime are discussed . in section",
    "v we compare with correlation functions and structure functions found in full numerical simulations ; this highlights features of the interaction between both fields which have to be included when the magnetic field becomes dynamically relevant .",
    "we conclude with a summary in section vi .",
    "the equations for a magnetic field @xmath9 in a conducting fluid moving with velocity @xmath10 are    @xmath11    2 where @xmath12 is the kinematic viscosity , @xmath13 is magnetic diffusivity , @xmath14 is the thermal pressure , and @xmath15 and @xmath16 are the external driving for each field .",
    "the quantity @xmath17 is the constant mass density and @xmath18 denotes the permeability in a vacuum .",
    "we estimate typical amplitudes for the velocity field and the magnetic field by the root mean square values @xmath19 and @xmath20 where @xmath21 denotes a statistical average over an isotropic and homogeneous ensemble .",
    "if then @xmath22 is an external length scale , the fluid reynolds number @xmath23 and the magnetic reynolds number @xmath24 can be formed .",
    "their ratio defines the magnetic prandtl number @xmath25 .",
    "the relative size of magnetic field and velocity field is measured by the alfvn - mach number @xmath26 , the ratio of the typical fluid velocity @xmath27 to the alfvn velocity @xmath28 , @xmath29 by the last line this is also the square root of the ratio between fluid kinetic energy and magnetic field energy .    with these definitions ,",
    "the dimensionless form of the first two equations reads    @xmath30    2 in two dimensions , both the velocity field and the magnetic field can be represented by scalar fields by introducing the vorticity @xmath31 and the magnetic flux function @xmath32 the mhd equations then take on the form @xmath33 with @xmath34 the @xmath35-component of the current density and @xmath36 and @xmath37 the scalar driving fields .",
    "the situation we want to consider is one of weak magnetic fields , i.e. very large @xmath26 , so that the term with the lorentz force density can be ignored .",
    "this can be estimated to be reasonable@xcite if the mach number exceeds the magnetic reynolds number , i.e. if @xmath38 .",
    "then the equations for the fluid do not depend on the magnetic field any more and the statistically stationary state that develops depends only on the strength of the force @xmath39 and the length scale @xmath40 on which it acts . in 2-d turbulence it is the enstrophy that cascades down to the viscous scales .",
    "so if we assume homogeneity and isotropy the appropriate smallest scale is the enstrophy dissipation length @xmath41 , defined in terms of the enstrophy dissipation rate @xmath42 .",
    "the quantities we want to study are the second order structure function @xmath0 , @xmath43 and the correlation function @xmath1 , @xmath44 of the magnetic field . @xmath0 and @xmath1 are related by @xmath45 continuity of the fields on small scales and decay of correlations on large scales implies the following limiting behavior for small and large distances @xmath4 : @xmath46 whereas it is the other way round for the correlation function , @xmath47 similar quantities can be defined for the velocity field and the magnetic flux function @xmath2 .",
    "the quantity @xmath48 is the magnetic energy dissipation rate .",
    "since @xmath2 obeys in the kinematic limit the equations of a passive scalar , we can use our previous results for the scaling of a passive scalar in a turbulent fluid to obtain the scaling regimes for @xmath2 .",
    "they can be transfered to the magnetic field case by use of the relations@xcite ( see appendix a for the derivation ) @xmath49 and consequently with ( [ definition_dc ] ) @xmath50 the quantity @xmath51 is the mean flux dissipation rate .",
    "in the limit of large @xmath26 the magnetic flux @xmath2 does not act on the flow field @xmath52 , so that ( [ indeq_nondim ] ) describes the passive advection of a scalar field in the velocity field that follows from the hydrodynamic driving . a connection between the scaling behavior of the fluid , as contained in the velocity structure function , @xmath53 and its longitudinal part , @xmath54 and the scaling behavior of the second order scalar field structure function , @xmath55 can be found within geometric measure theory.@xcite one estimates the fractal dimension @xmath56 of level sets",

    "8 we were able to obtain scale resolved and prandtl number dependent upper bounds for @xmath56 , which turned out to be rather sharp.@xcite if we assume that the bounds on @xmath56 are indeed equalities , ( [ ineq1 ] ) gives an upper bound on @xmath61 , viz .",
    "@xmath62 in the following we will evaluate the right hand side and in particular its dependence on the scaling of the velocity field and take this as an estimate for the scaling exponent @xmath61 . as mentioned , this relies on the assumption that several inequalites are in fact equalities and that intermittency effects are absent .",
    "a careful analysis of the derivation shows that the presence of intermittency in the scalar field modifies several approximations and that the cumulative effect is difficult to control .",
    "it is fairly straightforward , however , to allow for intermittency effects in the velocity structure function .",
