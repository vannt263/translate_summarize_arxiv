    "the discovery of the @xmath0 resonance by the belle collaboration in 2003 @xcite marked the beginning of a new era in charmonium spectroscopy .",
    "about a dozen new @xmath5 mesons above the open charm threshold have been discovered and many of them have properties that seem incompatible with their identification as conventional charmonium states .",
    "this presents a serious challenge to our understanding of the @xmath5 sector of qcd .",
    "of all the new @xmath5 mesons , the @xmath0 is the one for which the most experimental information is available .",
    "the preponderance of this information implies that the @xmath0 is a charm meson molecule whose constituents are a superposition of @xmath1 and @xmath6 .",
    "the structure of this molecule is remarkable , with the charm mesons almost always very well separated .",
    "however this identification of the @xmath0 is not universally accepted within the field .",
    "the leading alternatives are the @xmath7 charmonium state @xmath8 or a compact tetraquark @xmath5 meson . even among those who lean toward its identification as a charm meson molecule ,",
    "the remarkable structure of the @xmath0 is not universally appreciated .",
    "the only experimental information that is necessary to make the identification of the @xmath0 as a loosely - bound charm - meson molecule is the determination of its quantum numbers and the measurements of its mass .",
    "the quantum numbers of the @xmath0 can be inferred to be @xmath9 by combining the following information :    * the observation of its decay into @xmath10 @xcite or @xmath11  @xcite , which implies that it is even under charge conjugation , * analyses of the momentum distributions from its decay into @xmath12 , which imply that its spin and parity are @xmath13 or @xmath14 @xcite , * either the observation of its decays into @xmath15 @xcite , which disfavors @xmath14 because of angular - momentum suppression , or the observation of its decay into @xmath16 @xcite , which disfavors @xmath14 because of multipole suppression .",
    "a recent analysis of decays into @xmath17 by the babar collaboration favors the quantum numbers @xmath18 , but does not exclude @xmath9 @xcite . in the absence of definitive evidence to the contrary , we will assume that the quantum numbers of the @xmath0 are @xmath9 .",
    "the mass of the @xmath0 can be determined most directly by measurements in the @xmath19 decay channel . as pointed out in ref .",
    "@xcite , measurements in the @xmath15 decay channel are biased by the associated threshold enhancement just above the @xmath1 threshold . as pointed out in ref .",
    "@xcite , measurements in the @xmath1 decay channel are biased by the analysis procedure in which @xmath20 with invariant mass near the mass of @xmath21 is constrained to have invariant mass exactly equal to @xmath22 .",
    "this procedure assigns an energy above the @xmath1 threshold to a @xmath15 event whose energy is below the threshold . using the most recent measurements of the mass of the @xmath0 in the @xmath19 decay channel by the belle , cdf , babar , and d0 collaborations @xcite , the combined average for the position of the @xmath0 resonance relative to the @xmath1 threshold is @xmath23 where @xmath22 and @xmath24 are the masses of @xmath21 and @xmath25 .    the reason the quantum numbers @xmath9 and the measurement in eq .",
    "( [ mx - ave ] ) are sufficient to determine the nature of the @xmath0 is that quantum mechanics implies that an s - wave resonance whose energy is sufficiently close to the threshold has universal properties that are determined by its energy .",
    "if the energy is below the threshold , the state is a bound molecule consisting of pairs of particles that are almost always very well separated .",
    "one of the universal predictions is a relation between the mean - square separation of the constituents and the binding energy @xmath26 : @xmath27 , where @xmath28 is the reduced mass . in the case of the @xmath0 ,",
    "the quantum numbers @xmath9 imply that there is an s - wave coupling to @xmath1 .",
    "the tiny energy relative to the @xmath1 threshold implies that it is a resonant coupling .",
    "thus the @xmath0 is an s - wave threshold resonance . the binding energy given by eq .",
    "( [ mx - ave ] ) implies that the root - mean - square separation of the charm mesons in the @xmath0 is @xmath29  fm .",
    "this huge separation of the charm mesons makes the @xmath0 a truly remarkable hadron .",
    "one should distinguish between the nature of the @xmath0 , which is a weakly - bound charm meson molecule , and its origin , which has to do with the binding mechanism for the molecule .",
    "identifying the origin of the @xmath0 is crucial to understanding its implications for the other new @xmath5 mesons above the @xmath30 threshold .",
    "universality is a double - edged sword .",
    "while it allows the nature of the @xmath0 to be determined unambiguously from limited experimental information , universality makes it more difficult to identify the origin of the state .",
    "there are two primary candidates for the binding mechanism of the @xmath0 :    * .",
    "the @xmath0 could be generated dynamically by the interactions between the charm mesons .",
    "the interaction between @xmath21 and @xmath31 in the isospin-0 @xmath9 channel could be tuned to near the critical strength for the formation of a bound state . * .",
    "the @xmath0 could be generated by an isospin-0 resonance whose energy is tuned to near the @xmath1 threshold . an obvious candidate for the resonance is the @xmath8 , but it could also be any other type of @xmath5 meson with the appropriate quantum numbers , such as a compact tetraquark .",
    "one set of clues to the origin of the @xmath0 is its decay pattern .",
    "there are 6 decay modes that have been observed thus far : @xmath12 , @xmath17  @xcite , @xmath10  @xcite , @xmath11  @xcite @xmath15  @xcite , and @xmath32  @xcite . in order to exploit this information",
    ", one would need to understand the pattern of branching fractions that follow from each of the binding mechanisms .",
    "there is a well - developed phenomenology for decays of charmonium states , but there is no corresponding phenomenology for decays of compact tetraquark @xmath5 mesons or for the inelastic scattering of charm meson pairs .",
    "this makes it difficult to constrain the origin of the @xmath0 using the observed branching ratios .",
    "another class of observables that can provide clues to the origin of the @xmath0 is the energy distribution or line shape in specific decay channels . at energies",
    "much less than 8  mev from the @xmath1 threshold , the line shapes in these and other channels are universal in the sense that they are determined only by the binding energy and width of the @xmath0 resonance @xcite .",
    "the universal line shapes in the @xmath15 and @xmath32 channels , which receive contributions from the decay of a constituent @xmath21 or @xmath33 , are different from those in other decay channels , such as @xmath12 .",
    "braaten and lu presented simple analytic expressions for the universal line shapes that take into account the width of the @xmath21 and inelastic scattering channels for @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "the accuracy of these line shapes in the @xmath1 threshold region was verified in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "there have been several theoretical analyses of the line shapes for @xmath0 produced by the decays @xmath34 .",
    "the specific decay channels for which the line shapes have been measured by the belle and babar collaborations are @xmath12 @xcite , @xmath15  @xcite , and @xmath1  @xcite .",
    "hanhart et al .",
    "used a flatt parameterization of the line shapes to analyze the data on the @xmath12 and @xmath15 channels @xcite .",
    "they concluded that the data favored the @xmath0 being a virtual state with energy above the @xmath1 threshold .",
    "their analysis was biased towards such a result , because they assumed that the line shape in @xmath15 vanishes below the @xmath1 threshold , thus ignoring any contributions from a resonance below the @xmath1 threshold .",
    "braaten and lu used the universal line shapes to analyze data on the @xmath12 and @xmath15 channels @xcite .",

    "@xcite in using the flatt line shapes and ignoring @xmath15 and @xmath32 events from a resonance below the @xmath1 threshold .",
    "they concluded that @xmath0 can be identified as a @xmath7 charmonium state that is strongly distorted by coupled - channel effects .",
    "braaten and stapleton used the universal line shapes to analyze data on the @xmath12 and @xmath1 channels @xcite .",
    "they pointed out that the analysis procedure for @xmath1 in refs .",
    "@xcite assigns an energy above the @xmath1 threshold to a @xmath15 or @xmath32 event from decay of a resonance just below the @xmath1 threshold .",
    "when this effect is taken into account , the analysis of the @xmath1 data favors the @xmath0 being a bound state with energy below the @xmath1 threshold .",
    "kalashnikova and nefediev @xcite followed ref .",
    "@xcite in using the flatt line shapes and ignoring @xmath15 and @xmath32 events from a resonance below the @xmath1 threshold .",
    "they concluded that the babar data prefers the @xmath0 to be a virtual state with a small @xmath7 charmonium component while the belle data prefers a bound state with a @xmath7 charmonium component of about 30% .",
    "since the lines shapes very close to the @xmath1 threshold are universal , information about the origin of the @xmath0 can only come from the energy distributions away from the threshold .",
    "the line shapes outside the universal region depend on the binding mechanism .",
    "the flatt line shapes used in refs .",
    "@xcite can be derived from the assumption that the charm mesons scatter only through their couplings to a resonance with isospin 0",
    ". these would be the appropriate line shapes if the @xmath0 arises from a tuning of the energy of a resonance .",
    "alternative line shapes have been derived by braaten and lu under the assumption that the charm mesons scatter through zero - range interactions between the coupled channels consisting of neutral charm mesons and charged charm mesons @xcite .",
    "these would be the appropriate line shapes if the @xmath0 arises dynamically from interactions between the charm mesons .",
    "the zero - range line shapes in the @xmath12 and @xmath17 channels had been considered previously by voloshin @xcite , but his results were incorrect because of conceptual errors related to the treatment of isospin symmetry @xcite .    in order to discriminate between the two binding mechanisms identified above ,",
    "it is necessary to use line shapes that allow for either possibility .",
    "there are two criteria that we use as guiding principles in constructing the line shapes :    * .",
    "the line shapes should correspond to multichannel scattering amplitudes that are exactly unitary for real values of the interaction parameters .",
    "complex deformations of the parameters can then be used to take into account effects of additional channels that are not treated explicitly . * .",
    "the scattering amplitudes should be derivable from a renormalizable local quantum field theory .",
    "this guarantees that sensitivity to physics at much higher energies can be absorbed into the interaction parameters .    in a local quantum field theory ,",
    "the production of particles by a short - distance process can be represented by local operators .",
    "an advantage of a renormalizable field theory is that one can construct renormalized operators whose matrix elements are insensitive to physics at much higher energies .",
    "the line shapes from that production process are then determined by the interaction parameters and by the short - distance coefficients of those renormalized operators .    in this paper",
    ", we present a solution to the coupled - channel problem for pairs of neutral charm mesons @xmath1 and @xmath6 and pairs of charged charm mesons @xmath4 and @xmath35 that scatter through zero - range interactions and also through an isospin-0 resonance .",
    "the resulting scattering amplitudes satisfy the conditions of unitarity and renormalizability .",
    "they depend on 4 interaction parameters and reduce to the flatt scattering amplitudes of ref .",
    "@xcite and to the zero - range scattering amplitudes of ref .",
    "@xcite in the appropriate limits .",
    "we also solve the renormalization problem for the local operators that represent the production at short distances of pairs of neutral charm mesons , pairs of charged charm mesons , and the resonance .",

    "we assume that the resonance is the @xmath8 and we include constraints on the interaction parameters and on the @xmath37 short - distance coefficients from charmonium phenomenology .",
    "we use our line shapes to analyze data on the @xmath0 and data from the belle and babar collaborations on the production of @xmath1 above the threshold up to 4000  mev .",
    "we try to determine whether the data can discriminate between the two mechanisms for generating the @xmath0 that were described above .",
