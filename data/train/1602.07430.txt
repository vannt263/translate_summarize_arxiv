    "knowledge of the @xmath12 coherence factor and associated hadronic parameters is necessary for a measurement of the unitarity triangle angle @xmath4 ( also denoted @xmath13 ) in @xmath14 decays .",
    "( the symbol @xmath6 is used to denote a neutral charm - meson that is not in a flavour eigenstate , or where the flavour eigenvalue is not relevant for the discussion . )    the coherence factor @xmath0 and average strong - phase difference @xmath1 for the decay @xmath15 are defined as follows  @xcite : @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the decay amplitude of @xmath18 at a point in multi - body phase space described by parameters @xmath19 , and @xmath20 therefore @xmath21 is the cabibbo - favoured ( cf ) amplitude , averaged over phase space , and @xmath22 is the corresponding doubly cabibbo - suppressed ( dcs ) quantity .",
    "the coherence factor takes a value between 0 and 1 .",
    "it is also useful to define the parameter @xmath23 . in this letter",
    "the term ` hadronic parameters ' of the decay @xmath24 is employed to refer collectively to @xmath0 , @xmath25 and @xmath2 . throughout the discussion charge conjugation",
    "is implicit , the good approximation is made that @xmath11-violation can be neglected in @xmath7 mixing and decay  @xcite , and expressions are given in the convention @xmath26 .",
    "the role of the hadronic parameters in measurements sensitive to @xmath4 can be appreciated by considering the decay of @xmath27 mesons to a neutral charm - meson , reconstructed in the inclusive @xmath28 final state , and a charged kaon . neglecting small corrections from @xmath10 mixing , which can be included in a straightforward manner  @xcite ,",
    "the decay rates are given by : @xmath29 here @xmath30 is the absolute ratio of @xmath31 to @xmath32 amplitudes .",
    "the phase difference between these two amplitudes is @xmath33 , where @xmath34 is a @xmath11-conserving strong phase .",
    "the coherence factor , which is replaced by unity in the equivalent expression for a single point in phase space or two - body @xmath6-meson decays , modulates the size of the interference term that carries the dependence on @xmath4 .",
    "the hadronic parameters can be measured in the decays of coherently produced @xmath35 pairs at the @xmath9 resonance  @xcite , such as are available in the data sets collected by the cleo - c and besiii experiments .",
    "a double - tag technique is employed where one meson is reconstructed in the signal decay @xmath12 , and the other in a tagging mode , for example , a @xmath11 eigenstate .",
    "this method was applied by the cleo collaboration to obtain first constraints on @xmath0 and @xmath1 , together with @xmath36 and @xmath37 , the analogous parameters for @xmath38 decays  @xcite .",
    "a later analysis augmented the set of tags with the decay @xmath39 in order to improve the sensitivity to the hadronic parameters of both signal modes  @xcite .",
    "these results have been exploited by the lhcb collaboration to interpret a set of measurements with the decays @xmath5 , @xmath24  @xcite and @xmath38  @xcite , in combination with observables from other modes , to yield @xmath40  @xcite .",
    "observables sensitive to @xmath10 mixing in multibody @xmath6-meson decays are also affected by the same hadronic parameters  @xcite .",
    "the time - dependent ratio between @xmath41 and @xmath42 decay rates is @xmath43 where @xmath44 is the proper decay time , @xmath45 is the mean @xmath7 lifetime , @xmath46 @xmath47 , @xmath48 , and @xmath49 and @xmath50 are the commonly used mixing parameters , defined for example in ref .",
    "@xcite . as noted in refs .",
    "@xcite , a measurement of @xmath2 , @xmath51 and @xmath52 can either be used to determine @xmath49 and @xmath50 , given external information on @xmath0 and @xmath25 , or employed to set constraints on the latter parameters , provided @xmath49 and @xmath50 are known .",
    "both interpretations are presented in ref .",
    "@xcite , which reports a first observation of @xmath10 mixing with this multibody final state .",
    "improved knowledge of @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 is also needed to help understand the contribution of @xmath12 decays to the width difference in the @xmath10 system  @xcite .",
    "this letter reports a new analysis of @xmath24 decays in the cleo - c data set , and benefits from an updated monte carlo simulation sample to correct a biased estimate of the background contamination in several sets of double tags that afflicted the results reported in refs",
    ".  @xcite .",
    "in addition , the quasi-@xmath11-eigenstate @xmath53  @xcite is included as a new tagging mode to augment the sensitivity of the analysis .",
    "furthermore , an error is corrected in the formalism used to interpret the yields found with the @xmath39 tags  .",
    "the observables from this new analysis are then used to determine updated constraints on the hadronic parameters .",
    "finally , a global fit is made to the observables from this study and those measured in @xmath10 mixing by lhcb , to obtain more precise results for the @xmath24 hadronic parameters . since one of the re - measured @xmath9 observables",
    "couples the  and  systems , it is also possible to determine updated values of @xmath36 , @xmath54 and @xmath55 .",
    "in this section the observables sensitive to the hadronic parameters are reviewed , and a new analysis of the cleo - c data set is presented that updates the measured values with respect to those reported in ref .",
    "information on the hadronic parameters is then obtained from a fit to the updated measurements .",
    "two categories of observables exist , both based on double - tagged measurements in which one @xmath6 meson decays to the signal mode , and the other decays to a tagging mode . in the first category the tagging modes are two - body or higher multiplicity final states , which are treated in an inclusive fashion . in the second case ,",
    "the tagging mode is the self - conjugate final - state  and yields are measured in different phase - space bins of this tagging decay , defined in the plane of the dalitz plot .    in the category involving inclusive tags ,",
