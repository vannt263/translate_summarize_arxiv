    "the discovery of the quantum hall effect ( qhe ) in two dimensional electron gas ( 2deg ) opened a new pathway in the study of quantum phase transitions ( qpts ) . in the quantum hall regime the hall resistivity ( @xmath2 ) , measured as a function of the magnetic field or of the charge density , exhibits plateaus while the longitudinal resistivity ( @xmath3 ) vanishes , as a consequence of the 2deg quantum hall localization . in the region between two adjacent plateaus , in correspondence to the 2deg delocalization , @xmath3 shows shubnikov - de haas ( sdh ) peaks which has a temperature dependent width . in this region",
    "a qpt takes place , called plateau - plateau ( pp ) transition , which has been studied since the pioneering experimental works by tsui and coworkers  @xcite and the theoretical page - to - page one by pruisken @xmath4  @xcite in the limit of zero temperature the concept of delocalization can be understood assuming that the localization length @xmath5 diverges for some ranges of the fermi energy .",
    "then , there exist a singular energy @xmath6 in the energy spectrum where @xmath5 diverges with a power - like law @xmath7 , being @xmath8 its critical index that has been theoretically calculated and supposed to be universal .",
    "the first works dealing with the calculation of this index neglected the electron - electron ( _ e - e _ ) interaction and revealed a constant value @xmath9  @xcite for the localization length critical index .",
    "more recent and accurate calculations , carried out taking into account the _ e - e _ interaction , give an higher value @xmath10  @xcite .",
    "indications emphasizing the importance of interactions for the localization phenomenon also come from recent experiments on high - mobility low - density 2d electron structures , which have given evidence for the existence of an interaction - mediated metal - insulator transition  @xcite .",
    "experimental measurements have also lately revealed that electronic localization in graphene , in the quantum hall regime , is not entirely dominated by single - particle physics , but rather a competition between the underlying disorder and the repulsive coulomb interaction exists  @xcite .",
    "indeed , the effect of interactions near the qpts , and in particular the role of multifractality , are not well understood at the moment .",
    "for instance , at the integer quantum hall transition shortrange interactions seem to be irrelevant , in an renormalization group sense , at the critical point  @xcite , ( i.e. the critical exponent @xmath8 for the localization length and the multifractal spectrum remain the same as in the non - interacting problem ) .",
    "the @xmath11 coulomb interaction is relevant , however , and should drive the system to a novel critical point  @xcite .",
    "consequently , how the value of the critical exponent @xmath8 is affected , is far from being solved .",
    "experimentally it is possible to obtain @xmath8 from the magneto - transport measurement using an indirect method which relies on the calculation of the critical exponent @xmath12 .",
    "this method exploits the relation @xmath13 , being @xmath14 the temperature exponent of the inelastic scattering length ( @xmath15 ) , widely accepted  @xcite to be equal to @xmath16 within the framework of the anderson model ( when the disorder is of the alloy type an there is no electron - electron interaction ) . the pioneering experimental work of wei _ et al .",
    "@xcite gave @xmath17 , a value that has been recently reproduced extending the study to temperatures down to the milli - kelvin regime  @xcite .",
    "as explained above @xmath12 was accepted to be universal for pp transitions under the anderson model but recent experiments have shown that the value of the exponent depends on the type of disorder .",
    "indeed wanli li _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite observed different values for @xmath12 in algaas / ingaas heterostructures by changing the density of al , so that it could be possible that the clustering of al implies a change in the regime of the transition .",
    "this would mean that the anderson model is no more applicable in systems with long range disorder .",
    "this hypothesis has been strengthened by experimental studies that provided @xmath12 values between 0.2 and 0.9  @xcite . indeed in presence of this type of disorder or when interactions are playing an important role ,",
    "the electron transport is better described by a percolation picture through the so - called saddle points rather than by the anderson localization so that the scaling regime of the qpts has still to be reached and the obtained non - universal value at most represents a cross - over behavior .",
    "the magneto - transport measurements in a perfect two dimensional electron systems , such as graphene , in the quantum hall regime , presents another qpt , referred as plateau - insulator ( pi ) transition , which is the transition from the last hall resistivity plateau of the integer quantum hall effect ( iqhe ) ( @xmath18 in semiconductor @xmath16degs and @xmath19 in the case of graphene ) to an insulating phase which persists at higher magnetic fields .",
    "magneto - transport experiments in a semiconductor 2deg have shown that @xmath3 passes from a metallic phase ( in the delocalized state or sdh peak ) which value decreases by decreasing @xmath20 , to an insulating phase where @xmath3 increases by decreasing @xmath20 . in such transition",
    "there exists a t - independent crossing point corresponding to a critical magnetic field @xmath21 where all the isotherms collapse .",
    "the value obtained for the critical exponent of this transition in semiconductor samples ( ingaas / inp and ingaas / gaas )  @xcite was @xmath22 , but there still exist some controversy whether this transition belongs to the same universality class of the pp one .",
    "the recent discovery of graphene has implied a revision of the 2deg knowledge since it is the first truly two dimensional system studied and its properties differ markedly from the ones of the semiconductor - based 2deg .",
    "indeed , magneto - transport experiments performed in graphene have shown a new type of the iqhe  @xcite , as a consequence of the fourfold degeneracy of the charge carriers  @xcite , and the half - filling of the @xmath23 landau level ( ll )  @xcite .",
    "the fourfold degeneracy of the graphene carriers arises from the usual twofold spin degeneracy and from a novel twofold valley one .",
    "these two properties led to assume a special sequence of filling factor in graphene @xmath24 , in contrast with the well - established sequence of filling factors typical of the iqhe in semiconductor 2deg ( @xmath25 ) .",
    "this sequence of filling factors is no longer kept in clean graphene samples , and new integer plateaus close to the charge neutrality point ( cnp ) at @xmath26 appear , as well as fractional ones  @xcite .",
    "these exotic states have been observed in the presence magnetic field strong enough to lift the spin and valley degeneracy implying symmetry breaking effects and depend strongly on the homogeneity and purity of the graphene sample .",
    "sio@xmath0 substrate - supported monolayer graphene samples are usually far to be clean or homogeneous in sharp contrast with suspended or bn supported ones .",
    "some indicators of their quality are a high value of the mobility ( @xmath27 ) , the proximity of the charge neutrality point ( cnp ) to @xmath28  v , the narrowness of the dirac peak and its increase when applying an external magnetic field .",
    "moderate mobility samples ( with values in the range of @xmath29 ) and a cnp far from @xmath28  v indicate the presence of noticeable disorder like charged impurities , substrate effects , corrugations and strain ( see the work of mucciolo and coworkers for a complete review  @xcite ) .",
    "since it is not easy to control the homogeneity of the sample , it still remains unclear which type of disorder or interaction ( charged impurities , alloy , etc . )",
    "is the dominant one in each sample .",
    "for this major reason the study of the effect of the disorder and interactions in the qhe in graphene is at a preliminary stage yet .",
    "previous experiments have shown that in the vicinity of the the cnp @xmath3 may either decrease  @xcite , increase  @xcite at @xmath30 with decreasing temperature or exhibit a metallic state  @xcite without traces of an insulating one when crossing the cnp resulting of the coexistence of electron and hole puddles  @xcite .",
    "these observations have fueled the debate on the existence and origin of an insulating phase close or at the cnp at high magnetic fields .",
    "this confusion is partially clarified in the work by zhang _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite where it is clearly established that there are two different insulating regimes on the n=@xmath28 ll in sio@xmath0 substrate - supported monolayer graphene samples ( in the vicinity of not at the cnp ) and that they appear accordingly to the quality of the sample .",
    "a first transition to a quantum hall insulator occurs due to existence of disorder in the sample and can be followed by a second one to a bulk collective insulator state ( a pinned wigner crystal has been suggested ) at half ll filling regime .",
    "this latter transition arises from the symmetry breaking and would be observable in samples that exhibits high mobility ( @xmath27 ) , then it would be hindered by the presence of the disorder in low mobility samples .    as explained above",
    ", the non - interacting electrons model does not fully describe the critical phenomena of the iqhe so that the model must be improved , in order to clarify the mechanism that control the interplay between disorder and @xmath31 interaction on the electron transport in graphene in the quantum hall regime . in this work",
    "we try to shed more light to the case . actually , in a previous work  @xcite we observed the @xmath32 plateau in a graphene sample and we reported preliminary measurements on the pi qpt obtaining the value @xmath33 , in agreement with the one obtained with semiconductor alloys but in a limited range of temperatures . in the present work we present a detailed study of the quantum hall magneto - transport in various regimes of carrier concentration ( which were tuned by means of a gate voltage @xmath34 applied to the back - gate of the graphene hall bar ) in a moderate drude mobility sample .",
    "we have carried out the measurements from liquid he temperature up to 230 k. in this way we explore the interplay between the coulomb interaction , the thermal energy and the disorder landscape probed by the charge carriers and the overall effect on the transport in the quantum regime . in particular",
    "we reveal the non universality of the critical exponents when the spin - valley degeneracy is not lifted , a fact which give new insights in the knowledge of standard quantum hall insulator @xmath32 state .",
    "in this work we have used a single graphene monolayer sample used that was obtained by mechanical exfoliation of natural graphite and deposited onto a si wafer with a thermally grown @xmath35   nm sio@xmath0 top layer .",
    "the ohmic contacts of sample were patterned by means of nano - lithography using pmma resist whereas the graphene was not patterned into hall bar geometry by means of plasma etch in order to reduce the role of defects from edge states and the doping introduced by the mesa - etching process .",
    "the deposition of the ohmic contacts ( an adhesion layer of @xmath36 nm of ti followed by @xmath36 nm of au ) was performed in a ultra ( @xmath37 mbar ) high vacuum electron - beam evaporator .",

    "we recorded the signal decreasing @xmath53 from 28 t value to zero in order to exploit higher thermal stability , and we monitored the out - of - phase component of the signal to verify that it did not affect @xmath3 at high @xmath53 .",

    "<S> we studied the magneto - transport in sio@xmath0 substrate - supported monolayer graphene and the quantum phase transitions that characterize the quantum hall regime , using magnetic fields up to 28 t and temperatures down to @xmath1 k. the analysis of the temperature dependence of the hall and longitudinal resistivity reveals new non - universalities of the critical exponents of the plateau - insulator transition . </S>",
    "<S> these exponent depends on the type of disorder that governs the electrical transport , which knowledge is important for the design and fabrication of new graphene nano - devices . </S>"
