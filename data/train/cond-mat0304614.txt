    "elastic objects pinned by quenched disorder are central to the physics of disordered systems . in the last decades",
    "a considerable amount of research has been devoted to them . from the theory side",
    "they are among the simplest , but still quite non - trivial , models of glasses with complex energy landscape and many metastable states .",
    "they are related to a remarkably broad set of problems , from subsequences of random permutations in mathematics @xcite , random matrices @xcite to growth models @xcite and burgers turbulence in physics @xcite , as well as directed polymers @xcite and optimization problems such as sequence alignment in biology @xcite .",
    "foremost , they are very useful models for numerous experimental systems , each with its specific features in a variety of situations . interfaces in magnets @xcite experience either short - range disorder ( random bond rb ) , or long range ( random field rf ) . charge density waves ( cdw ) @xcite or the bragg glass in superconductors @xcite are periodic objects pinned by disorder . the contact line of liquid helium meniscus on a rough substrate is governed by long range elasticity @xcite .",
    "all these systems can be parameterized by a @xmath6-component height or displacement field @xmath7 , where @xmath8 denotes the @xmath9-dimensional internal coordinate of the elastic object ( we will use @xmath10 to denote fourier components ) .",
    "an interface in the 3d random field ising model has @xmath11 , @xmath12 , a vortex lattice @xmath13 , @xmath14 , a contact - line @xmath15 and @xmath12 .",
    "the so - called directed polymer ( @xmath15 ) has been much studied @xcite as it maps onto the kardar - parisi - zhang growth model @xcite for any @xmath6 .",
    "the equilibrium problem is defined by the partition function @xmath16\\ , \\exp(-{\\cal h}[u]/t)$ ] associated to the hamiltonian @xmath17= \\int { { \\mathrm{d}}}^d x\\ , \\frac{1}{2 } ( \\nabla u)^2 + v(u_x , x ) \\ , \\ ] ] which is the sum of an elastic energy which tends to suppress fluctuations away from the perfectly ordered state @xmath18 , and a random potential which enhances them .",
    "the resulting roughness exponent @xmath19 @xmath20 is measured in experiments for systems at equilibrium ( @xmath21 ) or driven by a force @xmath22 . here and below @xmath23",
    "denote thermal averages and @xmath24 disorder ones . in some cases",
    ", long - range elasticity appears e.g.  for the contact line by integrating out the bulk - degrees of freedom @xcite , corresponding to @xmath25 in the elastic energy .",
    "as will become clear later , the random potential can without loss of generality be chosen gaussian with second cumulant @xmath26 with various forms : periodic systems are described by a periodic function @xmath27 , random bond disorder by a short - range function and random field disorder of variance @xmath28 by @xmath29 at large @xmath30 . although this paper is devoted to equilibrium statics , some comparison with dynamics will be made and it is thus useful to indicate the equation of motion @xmath31 with friction @xmath32 .",
    "the pinning force is @xmath33 of correlator @xmath34 in the bare model .    despite some significant progress ,",
    "the model ( [ ham ] ) has mostly resisted analytical treatment , and one often has to rely on numerics . apart from the case of the directed polymer in @xmath35 dimensions ( @xmath15 , @xmath12 ) , where a set of exact and rigorous results was obtained @xcite , analytical methods are scarce .",
    "two main analytical methods exist at present , both interesting but also with severe limitations .",
    "the first one is the replica gaussian variational method ( gvm ) @xcite .",
    "it is a mean field method , which can be justified for @xmath36 and relies on spontaneous replica symmetry breaking ( rsb ) @xcite .",
    "although useful as an approximation , its validity at finite @xmath6 remains unclear .",
    "indeed , it seems now generally accepted that rsb does not occur for low @xmath9 and @xmath6 .",
    "the remaining so - called weak rsb in excitations @xcite may not be different from a more conventional droplet picture .",
    "another exactly solvable mean field limit is the directed polymer on the cayley tree , which also mimics @xmath37 and there too it is not fully clear how to meaningfully expand around that limit @xcite .",
    "the second main analytical method is the functional renormalization group ( frg ) which attempts a dimensional expansion around @xmath38 @xcite .",
    "the hope there is to include fluctuations , neglected in the mean field approaches .",
    "however , until now this method has only been developed to one loop , for good reasons , as we discuss below . its consistency has never been checked or tested in any calculation beyond one loop ( i.e.  lowest order in @xmath2 ) .",
    "thus contrarily to pure interacting elastic systems ( such as e.g.  polymers ) _ there is at present no quantitative method , such as a renormalizable field theory , which would allow to compute accurately all universal observables in these systems_.    the central reason for these difficulties is the existence of many metastable states ( i.e.  local extrema ) in these systems . although qualitative arguments show that they arise beyond the larkin length @xcite , these are hard to capture by conventional field theory methods .",
    "the best illustration of that is the so called dimensional reduction ( dr ) phenomenon , which renders naive perturbation theory useless @xcite in pinned elastic systems as well as in a wider class of disordered models ( e.g.  random field spin models ) .",
    "indeed it is shown that to _ any _ order in the disorder at zero temperature @xmath39 , any physical observable is found to be _ identical _ to its ( trivial ) average in a gaussian random force ( larkin ) model , e.g.@xmath40 for rb disorder .",
    "thus perturbation theory appears ( naively ) unable to help in situations where there are many metastable states .",
    "the two above mentioned methods ( gvm and frg ) are presently the only known ways to _ escape dimensional reduction _ and to obtain non - trivial values for @xmath19 ( in two different limits but consistent when they can be compared @xcite ) .",
    "the mean field method accounts for metastable states by rsb .",
    "this however may go further than needed since it implies a large number of pure states ( i.e.  low ( free ) energy states differing by @xmath41 in ( free ) energy ) .",
    "the other method , the frg , captures metastability through a non - analytic action with a cusp singularity . both the rsb and the cusp arise dynamically , i.e.  spontaneously , in the limits studied .",
    "the 1-loop frg has had some success in describing pinned systems .",
    "it was noted by fisher @xcite within a wilson scheme analysis of the interface problem in @xmath42 that the coarse grained disorder correlator becomes _ non - analytic _ beyond the larkin scale @xmath43 , yielding large scale results distinct from naive perturbation theory . within this approach",
    "an infinite set of operators becomes relevant in @xmath44 , parameterized by the second cumulant @xmath27 of the random potential .",
    "explicit solution of the 1-loop frg for @xmath27 gives several non - trivial attractive fixed points ( fp ) to @xmath45 proposed in @xcite to describe rb , rf disorder and in @xcite , periodic systems such as cdw or vortex lattices .",
    "all these fixed points exhibit a `` cusp '' singularity as @xmath46 at small @xmath47 .",
    "the cusp was interpreted in terms of shocks in the renormalized force @xcite , familiar from the study of burgers turbulence ( for @xmath15 , @xmath12 ) .",
    "the dynamical frg was also developed to one loop @xcite to describe the depinning transition .",
    "the mere existence of a non - zero critical threshold force @xmath48 ) .",
    "extension to non - zero temperature @xmath49 suggested that the cusp is rounded within a thermal boundary layer @xmath50 .",
    "this was interpreted to describe thermal activation and leads to a reasonable derivation of the celebrated creep law for activated motion @xcite .    in standard critical phenomena a successful 1-loop calculation",
    "usually quickly opens the way for higher loop computations , allowing for accurate calculation of universal observables and comparison with simulations and experiments , and eventually a proof of renormalizability . in the present context however , no such work has appeared in the last fifteen years since the initial proposal of @xcite , a striking sign of the high difficulties which remain .",
    "only recently a 2-loop calculation was performed @xcite but since this study is confined to an analytic @xmath27 it only applies below the larkin length and does not consistently address the true large scale critical behavior .",
    "in fact doubts were even raised @xcite about the validity of the @xmath5-expansion beyond order @xmath5 .",
    "it is thus crucial to construct a renormalizable field theory , which describes statics and depinning of disordered elastic systems , and which allows for a systematic expansion in @xmath2 .",
    "as long as this is not achieved , the physical meaning and validity of the 1-loop approximation does not stand on solid ground and thus , legitimately , may itself be called into question . indeed , despite its successes , the 1-loop approach has obvious weaknesses .",
    "one example is that the frg flow equation for the equilibrium statics and for depinning are identical , while it is clear that these are two vastly different physical phenomena , depinning being irreversible .",
    "also , the detailed mechanism by which the system escapes dimensional reduction in both cases is not really elucidated .",
    "finally , there exists no convincing scheme to compute correlations , and in fact no calculation of higher than 2-point correlations has been performed .",
    "another motivation to investigate the frg is that it should apply to other disordered systems , such as random field spin models , where dimensional reduction also occurs and progress has been slow @xcite .",
    "insight into model ( [ ham ] ) will thus certainly lead to progresses in a broader class of disordered systems .    in this paper",
    "we construct a renormalizable field theory for the statics of disordered elastic systems beyond one loop .",
    "the main difficulty is the non - analytic nature of the theory ( i.e.  of the fixed point effective action ) at @xmath39 .",
    "this makes it a priori quite different from conventional field theories for pure systems .",
    "we find that the 2-loop diagrams are naively `` ambiguous '' , i.e.  it is not obvious how to assign a value to them .",
    "we want to emphasize that this difficulty already exists at one loop , e.g.  _ even the simplest one loop correction to the two point function is naively `` ambiguous''_. thus it is not a mere curiosity but a fundamental problem with the theory , `` swept under the rug '' in all previous studies , but which becomes unavoidable to confront at 2-loop order .",
    "it originates from the metastability inherent in the problem . for the related theory of the depinning transition ,",
    "we have shown in companion papers @xcite how to surmount this problem and we constructed a 2-loop renormalizable field theory _ from first principles_. there , all ambiguities are naturally lifted using the known exact property that the manifold only moves forward in the slowly moving steady state .",
    "unfortunately in the statics there is no such helpful property and the ambiguity problem is even more arduous . here",
    "we examine the possible ways of curing these difficulties .",
    "we find that the natural physical requirements , i.e.that the theory should be ( i ) _ renormalizable _",
    "( i.e.  that a universal continuum limit exists independent of short - scale details ) , ( ii ) that the renormalized force should remain _ potential _ , and ( iii ) that no stronger singularity than the cusp in @xmath51 should appear to two loop ( i.e.  _ no `` supercusp '' _ ) , are rather restrictive and constrain possible choices .",
    "we then propose a theory which satisfies all these physical requirements and is consistent to two loops .",
    "the resulting @xmath0-function differs from the one derived in previous studies @xcite by novel static `` anomalous terms '' .",
    "these are different from the dynamical `` anomalous terms '' obtained in @xcite showing that indeed depinning and statics differ at two loop , fulfilling another physical requirement .",
    "we then study the fixed points describing several universality classes , i.e.  the interface with rb and rf disorder , the random periodic problem , and the case of lr elasticity .",
    "we obtain the @xmath4 corrections to several universal quantities .",
    "the prediction for the roughness exponent @xmath19 for random bond disorder has the correct sign and order of magnitude to notably improve the precision as compared to numerics in @xmath52 and to match the exact result @xmath53 in @xmath15 . for random field disorder",
    "we find @xmath3 which , for equilibrium is likely to hold to all orders .",
    "by contrast , non - trivial corrections of order @xmath4 were found for depinning @xcite .",
    "the amplitude , which in that case is a universal function of the random field strength is computed and it is found that the 2-loop result also improves the agreement as compared to the exact result known @xcite for @xmath54 . for the periodic cdw case we compare with the numerical simulations in @xmath13 and obtain reasonable agreement .",
    "some of the results of this paper were briefly described in a short version @xcite and agree with a companion study using exact rg @xcite ) .",
    "since the physical results also seem to favor this theory we then look for better methods to justify the various assumptions .",
    "we found several methods which allow to lift ambiguities and all yield consistent answers .",
    "a detailed discussion of these methods is given .",
    "in particular we find that correlation functions can be unambiguously defined in the limit of a small background field which splits apart quasi - degenerate states when they occur .",
    "this is very similar to what was found in a related study where we obtained the exact solution of the frg in the large @xmath6 limit @xcite .",
    "finally , the methods introduced here will be used and developed further to obtain a renormalizable theory to three loops , and compute its @xmath0-function in @xcite .",
    "let us mention that a first principles method which avoids ambiguities is to study the system at @xmath49",
    ". however , this turns out to be highly involved .",
    "it is attempted via exact rg in @xcite and studied more recently in @xcite where a field theory of thermal droplet excitation was constructed .",
    "a short account of our work has appeared in @xcite , and a short pedagogical introduction is given in @xcite .",
    "the outline of this paper is as follows . in section [ sec : model ]",
    "we explain in a detailed and pedagogical way the perturbation theory and the power counting . in section [ sec : renprog ] we compute the 1-loop ( section [ sec : oneloop ] ) and 2-loop ( section [ sec : twoloop ] ) corrections to the disorder .",
    "the calculation of the repeated 1-loop counter - term is given in section [ sec : rgdis ] . in section [ sec : finalbeta ] we identify the values for ambiguous graphs .",
    "this yields a renormalizable theory with a finite @xmath0-function , which is potential and free of a supercusp .",
    "the more systematic discussion of these ambiguities is postponed to section [ sec : ambiguities ] .",
    "we derive the @xmath0-function and in section [ sec : fixedpoints ] present physical results , exponents and universal amplitudes to @xmath4 .",
    "some of these quantities are new , and have not yet been tested numerically . in section [ sec : ambiguities ] we enumerate all the methods which aim at lifting ambiguities and explain in details several of them which gave consistent results . in section [ sec : correlations ] we detail the proper definition and calculation of correlation functions . in appendix",
    "[ sec : symm ] and [ sec : nona ] we present two methods which seem promising but _ do not _ work , in order to illustrate the difficulties of the problem . in appendix [ sec : finitet ] we present a summary of all one and 2-loop corrections including finite temperature . in appendix",
    "[ sec : sloopbc ] we give details of calculations for what we call the sloop elimination method .",
    "the reader interested in the results can skip section [ sec : model ] and section [ sec : renprog ] and go directly to section [ sec : fixedpoints ] .",
    "the reader interested in the detailed discussion of the problems arising in this field theory should read section [ sec : ambiguities ] .",
    "we study the static equilibrium problem using replicas , i.e.  consider the partition sum in presence of sources : @xmath55 = \\int \\prod_a { \\cal d}[u_a]\\ , \\exp\\left(- { \\cal s}[u ] + \\int_x \\sum_a j_x^a u_x^a\\right ) \\ , \\ ] ] from which all static observables can be obtained .",

    "we will denote @xmath62 for periodic systems the integration is over the first brillouin zone .",
    "a short - scale uv cutoff is implied at @xmath63 , but for actual calculations we find it more convenient to use dimensional regularization .",

    "if we had chosen non - gaussian disorder additional terms with free sums over @xmath68 replicas ( called @xmath68-replica terms ) corresponding to higher cumulants of disorder would be present in ( [ action ] ) , together with a factor of @xmath69 .",
    "these terms are generated in the perturbation expansion , i.e.  they are present in @xmath64 $ ] .",
    "we do not include them in ( [ action ] ) because , as we will see below , these higher disorder cumulants are not relevant within ( conventional ) power counting , so for now we ignore them .",
    "the temperature @xmath70 appears explicitly in the replicated action ( [ action ] ) , although we will focus on the @xmath39 limit .    because the disorder distribution is translation invariant , the disorder term in the above action is invariant under the so called statistical tilt symmetry @xcite ( sts ) , i.e.  the shift @xmath71 .",
    "one implication of sts is that the 1-replica replica part of the action ( i.e.  the first line of [ action ] ) is uncorrected by disorder , i.e.  it is the same in @xmath64 $ ] and @xmath72 $ ] @xcite .",
    "since the elastic coefficient is not renormalized , we have set it to unity .",
    "we first study perturbation theory , its graphical representation and power counting . everywhere in the paper",
    "we denote the exact 2-point correlation by @xmath73 , i.e.  in fourier : @xmath74 while the free correlation function ( from the elastic term ) used for perturbation theory in the disorder is denoted by @xmath75 and reads in fourier : @xmath76 which is represented graphically by a line : @xmath77{./figures / prop}{\\hspace*{0.8ex}}}\\parbox{\\bilderlength}{{\\hspace*{0.8ex}}\\includegraphics[scale={0.35}]{./figures / prop}{\\hspace*{0.8ex}}}}_{b } ~= \\frac{t\\delta_{ab}}{q^{2}+m^{2}}\\ .\\ ] ] each propagator thus carries one factor of @xmath78 .",

    "when the 2-points of a vertex are connected , this vertex is said to be `` saturated '' .",
    "it gives a derivative evaluated at zero @xmath84 .",

    "it is important to distinguish between _ fully saturated diagrams _ and _ functional diagrams_. the fs diagrams are those needed for a full average , e.g.  a correlation function .",

    "then instead of symmetrization , one uses identities derived from the fact that diagrams with free replica sums and which contain sloops can not appear in a @xmath39 theory and can thus be set to zero .",
    "further contracting such diagrams generates a set of identities which , remarkably , is sufficient to obtain unambiguously the 2-replica projection without any further assumption .",

    "( compare  @xmath496 with @xmath497 ) . by construction , this method ensures renormalizability , at least as long as there is only one possible path .",

    "8) renormalizability diagram by diagram : * in section iii we have used a _ global _ renormalizability requirement : the 1-loop repeated counter - term being non - ambiguous one could fix all ambiguities of the divergent 2-loop corrections .",
    "however , as will be discussed in @xcite , this global constraint appears insufficient at three loops to fix all ambiguities .",
    "fortunately , one notes that renormalizability even gives a stronger constraint , namely renormalizability _",
    "diagram by diagram_. the idea goes back to formal proofs of perturbative renormalizability in field - theory , see e.g.@xcite .",
    "these methods define a subtraction operator @xmath498 .",
    "graphically it can be constructed by drawing a box around each sub - divergence , which leads to a `` forest '' or `` nest '' of sub - diagrams ( the counter - terms in the usual language ) , which have to be subtracted , rendering the diagram `` finite '' .",
    "the advantage of this procedure is that it explicitly assigns all counter - terms to a given diagram , which finally yields a proof of perturbative renormalizability .",
    "if we demand that this proof goes through for the _ functional _ renormalization group , the counter - terms must necessarily have the same functional dependence on @xmath27 as the diagram itself . in general ,",
    "the counter - terms are less ambiguous , and this procedure can thus be used to lift ambiguities in the calculation of the diagram itself . by construction",
    "this procedure is very similar to the recursive construction discussed under point 7 .",
    "it has some limitations though .",

    "other possible contributions are given on figure [ other4point ] .",
    "however none of these diagrams contributes .",
    "the reason is that they are all descendents of a sloop .",

    "this means , that to any order in perturbation theory , at @xmath39 , no diagram contributes to a connected expectation value ( of a single replica ) , which has two lines parting from one @xmath86 towards external points .",
    "thus the leading contribution in @xmath86 to the connected 4-point function , as determined by the sloop method is the 1-loop diagram @xmath706 if one expressed this result in terms of the force correlator @xmath707 we thus find that this expression is formally _ identical _ to the one that we obtained for the same four point function at the @xmath39 quasistatic depinning threshold ( equation 5.4 in @xcite ) .",
    "this is quite remarkable given that the method of calculation there , i.e.  via the non - analytic dynamical field theory , is very different .",
    "of course the two physical situations are different and here one must insert the fixed point value for @xmath708 from the statics frg fixed point , while in the depinning calculation @xmath709 takes a different value at the fixed point . in both problems",
    "the connected four point function starts at order @xmath710 . however in some cases",
    "the difference appears only to the next order in @xmath5 .",
    "for instance , we can conclude that the results of @xcite still hold here for the _ static random field _ to the lowest order in @xmath5 at which they were computed there ( of course one expects differences at next order in @xmath5 ) . on the other hand .",
    "for the static random bond case , the result for the connected four point function will be different from depinning even at leading order in @xmath5 .",
    "it can easily be obtained from the above formula following the lines of @xcite .",
    "in this article we constructed the field theory for the statics of disordered elastic systems .",
    "it is based on the functional renormalization group , for which we checked explicitly renormalizability up to two loops .",
    "this continuum field theory is novel and highly unconventional : not only is the coupling constant a function , but more importantly this function , and the resulting effective action of the theory , are non - analytic at zero temperature , which requires a non - trivial extension of the usual diagrammatic formulation .    in a first stage",
    ", we showed that 2-loop diagrams , and _ in some cases even 1-loop diagrams _ , are at first sight ambiguous at @xmath39 .",
    "left unaddressed , this finding by itself puts into question all previous studies of the problem .",
    "indeed , nowhere in the literature the problem was adressed that even the 1-loop corrections to the most basic object in the theory , the 2-point function , are naively ambiguous in the @xmath39 theory . since the problem is controlled by a zero - temperature fixed point there is no way to avoid this issue .",
    "an often invoked criticism states that the problems are due to the limit of @xmath711 replicas .",
    "we would like to point out that even though we use replicas , we use them only as a tool in perturbative calculations , which could equally well be performed using supersymmetry , or at a much heavier cost , using disorder averaged graphs .",
    "so replicas are certainly not at the root of any of the difficulties . instead",
    "the latter originate from the physics of the system , i.e.  the occasional occurence of quasi - degenerate minima , resulting in ambiguities sensible to the preparation of the system .",
    "how to deal with this problem within a continuum field theory is an outstanding issue , and any progress in that direction is likely to shed light on other sectors of the theory of disordered systems and glasses .",
    "the method we have propose to lift the apparent ambiguities is based on two constraints : ( a ) that the theory be renormalizable , i.e.  yield universal predictions , and ( b ) that it respects the potentiality of the problem , i.e.  the fact that all forces are derivatives of a potential . each of these physical requirements is sufficient to obtain the @xmath243-function at 2-loop order , and the 2-point function and roughness exponent to second order in @xmath5 .",
    "next , we have proposed several more general , more powerful and mutually consistent methods to deal with these ambiguous graphs , which work even to higher number of loops and allow to compute correlation functions with more than two points .",
    "we were then able to calculate from our theory the roughness exponents , as well as some universal amplitudes , for several universality classes to order @xmath4 . in all cases ,",
    "the predictions improve the agreement with existing numerical and exact results , as compared to previous 1-loop treatments .",
    "we also clarified the situation concerning the universality ( precise dependence on boundary conditions , independence on small scale details ) of various quantities .",
    "another remarkable finding is that the 1-loop contribution to the 4-point function is formally identical to the one obtained via the dynamical calculation at depinning .",
    "this hints to a general property that _ all _ 1-loop diagrams are undistinguishable in the statics and at depinning .",
    "it would be extremely interesting to perform higher precision numerical simulations of the statics , and to determine not only exponents but universal amplitudes and scaling functions to test the predictions of our theory .",
    "we strongly encourage such studies .",
    "thus in this paper we have proposed an answer to the highly non - trivial issue of constructing a renormalizable field theory for disordered elastic systems .",
    "contrarily to the closely related field theory of depinning , which we were able to build from first principles , we have not yet found a first principle derivation of the theory for the statics .",
    "however , we have found that the theory is so highly constrained , and the results so encouraging , that we strongly believe that our construction of the field is unique .",
    "it is after all , often the case in physics that the proper field theory is first identified by recurrence to higher physical principles such as renormalizability or symmetries , as is exemplified by the ginsburg - landau theory of superconductivity , for which only later a microscopic derivation was found , or gauge theories in particle physics .",
    "the first observation is that one expects ( if decomposition in @xmath68-replica terms is to mean anything ) that one can write the ( local disorder part of the ) effective action as a sum over well defined @xmath68-replica terms in the form : @xmath712 & = & \\sum_{p } \\frac{1}{t^p } \\gamma_p[u ] \\nonumber \\\\ & = & \\sum_{p } \\frac{1}{p ! t^p } \\sum_{a_1, ... a_p } f^{(p)}(u_{a_1}, .... u_{a_p)}\\ , \\qquad \\label{lf195}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the functions @xmath713 have full permutation symmetry .",
    "the idea of the symmetrization method is that we also expect , even at @xmath39 that these functions @xmath713 should be _ continuous _ in their arguments when a number of them coincide .",
    "this seems to be a rather weak and natural assumption .",
    "physically these functions can be interpreted as the @xmath68-th connected cumulants of a renormalized disorder , i.e.  a random potential @xmath714 in each environment .",
    "discontinuity of the @xmath713 would mean that the @xmath714 would not be a continuous function .",
    "this is not what one expects .",
    "indeed discontinuity singularities ( the shocks ) are expected to occur only in the force @xmath715 as is clear from the study of the burgers equation ( see e.g.@xcite for the discussion of simple case , in the elastic manifold formulation the shocks corresponds to rare ground state degeneracies ) .",
    "one thus expects @xmath714 to be a continuous function of @xmath30 .",
    "a further and more stringent assumption , discussed above , is the absence of supercusp .",
    "a supercusp would mean @xmath716 .",
    "thus we assume that the non - analyticity in the effective action starts as @xmath717 . the usual interpretation .",
    "indeed one could argue that if there are many small shocks they could build a supercusp .",

    "then , in some definitions of a coarse grained disorder , e.g.  such as used in @xcite where this model was solved exactly , @xmath719 is a continuous one dimensional brownian motion , thus with a infinite number of small shocks and indeed a supercusp .",
    "however , in the present paper , @xmath719 is defined from the replicated effective action , and not from the action , and should possess - in that case - a weaker singularity . ]",
    "is that there is a finite density of shocks and just counting how many shocks there is in a interval between @xmath30 and @xmath720 yields the @xmath721 non - analyticity in @xmath27 .",
    "let us summarize the method before detailing actual calculations .",
    "we thus define here the symmetrization method assuming no supercusp as a working hypothesis .",
    "we then _ compute _ corrections to the ( local disorder part of the ) effective action up to a given order in powers of @xmath86 , with excluded vertices for any vector such that @xmath722 for @xmath557 , thus with no ambiguity .",
    "this yields , as in section [ sec : unambdiag ] , sums over more than two replicas with exclusions .",

    "thus we have a sum of terms of the form @xmath723 where @xmath724 is a short - hand notation for @xmath725 for all @xmath726 , i.e.  symmetrized exclusions .",
    "each function @xmath22 is fully permutation symmetric , as indicated by the @xmath727 superscript .",
    "next the non - trivial part is that we _",
    "explicitly verify _ that these _ symmetrized _ corrections can indeed be continued to coinciding points unambiguously , e.g the limit @xmath728 exist and is independent of the direction of approach .",
    "this in itself shows that the continuity discussed above seems to work .",
    "the existence of a four replica term obliges us to also consider three coinciding points .",
    "this is done by considering @xmath729 , i.e.symmetrizing the result of two coinciding points over @xmath730 and then taking @xmath731 .",
    "we check explicitly that this again gives a function which can be continued unambiguously .",
    "thus at first sight , it would appear as the ideal method to extract the functions @xmath713 above to order @xmath732 .",
    "let us reconsider the diagrams of fig .",
    "[ excl ] we first transform them in sum with symmetrized constraints . we illustrate this on diagram @xmath0 where the sum can be reorganized as : @xmath733 with clearly no ambiguity .",
    "performing similar rearrangement on all the graphs of class a yields the sum of the graphs : @xmath734 now we use the property that has worked on all the examples needed here , namely that a symmetric continuous function on @xmath735 is continuous on @xmath736 . writing for any @xmath737 symmetric and continuous : @xmath738 and expanding yields , for the three and four replica sums : @xmath739 in shorthand notations such that @xmath740 .",
    "this is just combinatorics .",
    "for the three replica sums the procedure is straightforward , as symmetrization makes manifest the continuity .",
    "one easily finds ( we drop an uninteresting single replica term ) : @xmath741 where in the first line we have applied ( [ lf201 ] ) to @xmath742 and so on ( we define @xmath743 as the sum over all permutations divided by @xmath744 ) .",
    "for the 4-replica term we find that @xmath745 has the following limits ( in a symbolic form , omitting the free summations ) @xmath746 where at each step we had to symmetrize before taking coinciding point limits ( checking that this limit was unambiguous in each case ) .",
    "the final result is found to be : @xmath747 the same procedure applied to the repeated counter - term confirms that it is unambiguous and give by ( [ 1-loop - rep - cc ] ) .",
    "thus because of the ominous @xmath748 coefficient above , rather than the expected @xmath176 the theory , using this procedure , is not renormalizable",
    ".    diagrams of class b and c behave properly .",
    "one finds with the same method their projections on the 2-replica part : @xmath749 note the @xmath562 which here is defined as @xmath750 since @xmath751 can be continued at zero .",
    "one has , using the expressions given in appendix [ sec : classc ] : @xmath752    these graphs ( more precisely their contribution to 2-rep terms ) sum exactly to zero :    @xmath753    in agreement with the result of the ambiguous diagrammatics in the case of an analytic function .    to conclude , although promising at first sight this method is not satisfactory .",
    "the projection defined here seems to fail to commute with further contractions .",
    "for instance one can check that upon building diagrams a by contracting the subdiagram ( a ) in fig .",
    "[ f : sloops ] onto a third vertex does give different answers if one first projects ( a ) or not . since ( a ) is the divergent subdiagram this spoils renormalizability .",
