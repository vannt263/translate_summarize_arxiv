    "the zeros of the derivative @xmath0 of the riemann zeta - function are intimately connected with the behavior of the zeros of @xmath1 itself . indeed , a theorem by speiser  @xcite states that the riemann hypothesis ( rh ) is equivalent to @xmath0 having no zeros to the left of the critical line .",
    "thus , understanding of the properties the zeros of @xmath0 can provide important tools and insight into the study of rh .",
    "after speiser s article this idea was explored by berndt  @xcite and spira  @xcite , but not much progress was achieved until the work of levinson and montgomery  @xcite , who proved a quantitative refinement of speiser s theorem .",
    "they showed that @xmath1 and @xmath0 have essentially the same number of zeros to the left of the critical line @xmath2 , and proved that as @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is the height on the critical line , a positive proportion of the zeros of @xmath0 lie in the region @xmath5    consider the group of unitary matrices @xmath6 with probably distribution given by haar measure , which is the unique measure invariant under the left and right action of @xmath6 on itself .",
    "such a probability space is often known as the _ circular unitary ensemble _ ( cue ) .",
    "let @xmath7 be the characteristic polynomial of a matrix in the cue .",
    "in recent years evidence has been accumulated suggesting that , in the limit as @xmath8 , the local statistical properties of @xmath1 can be modeled by the characteristic polynomials of matrices in the cue where @xmath9 .",
    "the connection between the riemann zeta - function and characteristic polynomials is extensive ; examples include the distribution of the zeros of @xmath1 , its value distribution and its moments .",
    "( for a series of review articles on the subject see  @xcite and references therein . )    assuming that random matrix theory ( rmt ) provides an accurate description of @xmath1 , the horizontal distribution of the zeros of @xmath0 in proximity of the critical line should be the same as the radial distribution of the roots of @xmath10 close to the unit circle .",
    "this idea was first developed by mezzadri  @xcite , who determined the distribution of the zeros of @xmath10 that are very far from the unit circle and conjectured the leading order term of the distribution very close to the unit circle . in this paper",
    "we prove his conjecture .",
    "we also perform an analogous calculation for the riemann zeta - function and conjecturally find that the result agrees with the rmt model .",
    "in addition , we do numerical computations in both cases and find a surprising feature in the distribution of zeros of the derivative , namely that the probability distribution is bimodal .",
    "we have mentioned that the main motivation for studying the zeros of the derivative of the riemann zeta - function is its connection with rh .",
    "indeed , levinson and montgomery s result is the basis for levinson s method  @xcite , which conrey  @xcite used to prove that at least 40% of the zeros of the zeta - function are on the line @xmath11 .",
    "levinson s method involves estimating a weighted average of the zeros of @xmath0 to the left of @xmath12 for some fixed  @xmath13 .",
    "thus , zeros of @xmath0 in the region @xmath14 are an inherent loss in levinson s method",
    ". it would be useful to understand the magnitude of this loss .",
    "alternatively , if we could find a lower bound for the number of zeros of @xmath15 in this region we could improve the estimate for the number of zeros on the critical line .",
    "[ 1.00 ] ( dot ) , @xmath0 ( triangle ) , @xmath16 ( square ) , and @xmath17 ( star ) , with imaginary parts in the range @xmath18 .",
    "[ fig : zzpzpp ] , title=\"fig : \" ]    figure  [ fig : zzpzpp ] gives a representative example of the location of zeros of @xmath0 and the relationship to the zeros of @xmath1 and various other derivatives of the zeta - function .",
    "it illustrates that zeros of @xmath0 close to the critical - line correspond to closely spaced zeros of  @xmath1 .",
    "we make this statement precise in section  [ sec : riemann ] .",
    "also , a zero of @xmath0 seems to be `` missing '' when zeros of @xmath19 are particularly far apart or when there are two successive large gaps . indeed , there ca nt be a zero of @xmath0 between every pair of zeros of @xmath1 because the density of zeros of @xmath1 is @xmath20 while the density of zeros of @xmath0 is @xmath21 .",
    "so on average there is a `` missing '' zero of @xmath0 in each @xmath4 interval of width  @xmath22 .",
    "conrey and ghosh  @xcite and subsequently guo  @xcite improved levinson and montgomery s result   and showed that a positive proportion of the zeros of @xmath0 are much closer to the line @xmath23 .",
    "indeed , for any fixed @xmath13 , the region @xmath24 contains a positive proportion of the zeros .",
    "soundararajan  @xcite made further progress and introduced the functions    [ eq : sound_fns ] @xmath25    where @xmath26 is the number of zeros @xmath27 of @xmath0 with @xmath28 .",
    "soundararajan proved that @xmath29 for @xmath30 , and conjectured that @xmath31 he also conjectured that @xmath32 is continuous , that @xmath33 for all @xmath34 , and that @xmath35 as @xmath36 .",
    "zhang  @xcite , feng  @xcite , garaev and yildirim  @xcite , and ki  @xcite proved refinements of soundararajan s results .",
    "in particular feng  @xcite showed that @xmath29 for all @xmath13 unconditionally of rh but assuming a conjecture on the frequency of small gaps between consecutive critical zeros of @xmath1 .",
    "suppose @xmath37 is a polynomial with all zeros on the unit circle .",
    "( eventually , @xmath38 will be a random polynomial obtained as the characteristic polynomial of a random unitary matrix . )",
    "the gauss - lucas theorem assures that all the roots of @xmath39 lie on or inside the unit circle ( zeros of @xmath40 on the circle occur only if @xmath38 has multiple zeros ) .",
    "if @xmath37 has two zeros which are very close together , then @xmath39 will have a zero close by .",
    "( this is a consequence of the continuous dependence of the zeros of @xmath40 on those of  @xmath38 .",
    "this dependence is actually piecewise analytic as will be described below . )",
    "the specific location of the nearby zero of @xmath39 will depend primarily on how close those two zeros of @xmath37 are , and on the general position of the remaining zeros of  @xmath37 .",
    "thus , to leading order ( with respect to the size of the gap ) , the distribution of zeros of @xmath39 near @xmath41 should largely depend on the distribution of small gaps between zeros of @xmath37 , that is , on the tail of the nearest - neighbor spacing of zeros of  @xmath37 .",
    "we will make this idea precise and treat in detail the case where @xmath42 is the characteristic polynomial of a cue matrix ( a matrix chosen from the unitary group  @xmath6 , uniformly with respect to haar measure ) .",
    "let @xmath43 be a root of @xmath10 and define the random variable @xmath44 denote by @xmath45 the probability density function ( p.d.f . ) of @xmath46 .",
    "mezzadri  @xcite showed that the limit @xmath47 exists , and proved that @xmath48 with @xmath49 .",
    "he also conjectured that @xmath50    formula   can be interpreted as the rmt counterpart of the levinson - montgomery bound   for the roots of @xmath0 .",
    "the rmt model of the riemann - zeta function is based on the observation that the local correlations of the non - trivial zeros of @xmath1 coincide with those of the eigenvalues of matrices in the cue . in order to make this correspondence quantitative ,",
    "the densities of the eigenvalues and of the zeros of @xmath1 must be made ( asymptotically ) equal , i.e. , @xmath51 it follows from   that the expected value of @xmath46 does not exist ",
    "its p.d.f .",
    "does not decay sufficiently rapidly . on the other hand , using  ( [ eq : m_r1 ] ) , the average of the values of @xmath46 not exceeding @xmath52 is @xmath53 recalling the relation  ( [ eq : dis_un_c ] ) between @xmath46 and @xmath54 , we conclude that a positive proportion of the roots of @xmath10 must lie within a distance from the unit circle bounded from above by @xmath55 from the unit circle .",
    "because of  , formula   corresponds to levinson and montgomery s result  .",
    "now consider the roots @xmath56 ( with @xmath57 ) of the characteristic polynomial  @xmath7 of a random unitary matrix distributed with haar measure .",
    "it is convenient for our purposes to define @xmath58 so that , on average , the distance between two consecutive @xmath59 s is one .",
    "the joint probability density function ( j.p.d.f . ) of the eigenvalues is given in terms of @xmath60 as @xmath61 where we have used the notation @xmath62 .",

    "fix integers @xmath68 and @xmath69 with @xmath70 .",
    "let us denote by @xmath71 the probability density function of @xmath72 .",
    "since the j.p.d.f .",
    "( [ eq : weyl_int ] ) is invariant under translations , which means @xmath73 it follows that @xmath71 does not depend on  @xmath69 .",
    "if @xmath74 , @xmath75 is known as the _",
    "spacing distribution_. it has an asymptotic expansion in powers of @xmath76 : @xmath77 this expansion follows from the pair correlation function for @xmath78 ( see @xcite ) , @xmath79 and the fact that the pair correlation function and the nearest neighbor spacing for @xmath78 agree to order  6 .    to describe our main result ,",
    "suppose that a root of @xmath7 is degenerate ( which means @xmath80 ) so that @xmath81 will also be a root of @xmath10 .",
