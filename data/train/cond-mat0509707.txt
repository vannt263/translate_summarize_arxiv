    "the electron gas with long - range coulomb repulsion and the hubbard model with screened on - site repulsion are two widely studied models that each describe large classes of materials .",
    "both models are generally studied with quite different theoretical methods . however , by gradually increasing the range of the interaction in the hubbard model and by reducing the density to average out lattice effects , one should be able to go continuously from the hubbard to the coulomb gas model .",
    "is there one unified theoretical framework that allows us to treat both limiting cases ?    to begin to answer this question , we generalize the two - particle self - consistent approach ( tpsc ) @xcite to study the extended hubbard model , that includes nearest - neighbor repulsion in addition to the usual on - site repulsion .",
    "this model is interesting in its own right , independently of the above - mentioned theoretical question .",
    "indeed , the extended hubbard model allows one to study materials where competition between charge and spin order manifest themselves . in high - temperature superconductors , where screening is not perfect , understanding the extended hubbard model is also of paramount importance .",
    "let us first motivate further our focus on the tpsc approach and then come back to the interesting physical phenomena that manifest themselves in the extended hubbard model . judging from comparisons with benchmark quantum monte carlo calculations,@xcite ( in the absence of exact solutions ) ,",
    "the tpsc approach provides us with the most accurate approximate solution to the hubbard model at weak to intermediate coupling .",
    "a detailed critical comparison with other methods such as the random phase approximation ( rpa ) , the self - consistent renormalized theory and the fluctuation exchange approximation is given in ref .",
    "( ) . in particular , tpsc satisfies the pauli principle , the mermin - wagner theorem in two - dimensions includes kanamori - brckner@xcite screening and is non - perturbative although limited to interaction strengths less than the bandwidth .",
    "the tpsc approach is a close relative to the singwi , tosi , land , sjlander ( stls ) method @xcite used in the electron gas problem .",
    "the stls approximation has been first introduced to describe the structure functions of an electron liquid where it provided much better results compared to the rpa .",
    "this approximation has been applied to a variety of systems that contain fermions , bosons or classical particles in all physical dimensions and different geometries . starting with the equation of motion for one - body density operator ,",
    "the authors were faced with the well - known problem that the two - body density operator appeared in their equation .",
    "they solved the problem approximately by replacing the two - body density operator by a product of two one - body density operators and then correcting the result with the pair correlation function .",
    "the result of this factorization appears as a correction in the response functions of the system , the so - called local field factor .",
    "this factor is then determined by using a sum - rule derived from the fluctuation - dissipation theorem .",
    "the present paper will give a new point of view on the stls method by comparing it to the tpsc approach . as we will show in more details ,",
    "the main difference between the latter method and the stls one , is the way we factorize the two - body density operator .",
    "it seems that for local _ vs _ non - local potentials , it is more accurate to use , respectively , local or non - local factorization and , as we will show in detail , a local factorization leads to better results for the extended hubbard model .",
    "that is not all .",
    "it will become clear in the formalism used to derive tpsc that the stls  method also neglects some higher - order correlation functions .",
    "the same type of approximation will be necessary to be able to generalize tpsc to treat the extended hubbard model@xcite . otherwise , as in stls , there is a shortage of sum - rules or conditions to find all unknowns that appear in the method .",
    "we believe that accuracy of the approximation is crucial for a real understanding of physical properties and for meaningful comparisons to experiments .",
    "bad approximations that agree with experiment only lead us astray .",
    "that is why we will benchmark our extension of the tpsc approach against the highly accurate results that can obtained by quantum monte carlo ( qmc ) simulations .",
    "we will carefully analyze the approximations involved in the method and discuss other possibilities for improvement .    back to the extended hubbard model .",
    "this model has a long history , so we can only discuss a small sample of the relevant literature . at half - filling ,",
    "when the on - site interaction strength @xmath0 tends to infinity so that super - exchange @xmath1 vanishes , the effect of the nearest - neighbor repulsion @xmath2 is to lead to an effective ferromagnetic interaction between localized spins .",
    "this is the physics of the so - called direct - exchange mechanism .",
    "the physics is quite different when @xmath0 and @xmath3 are of the same order and both in the weak to intermediate - coupling regime , namely less than or of the order of the bandwidth ( @xmath4 in @xmath5 ) . in that case",
    ", there is a competition between staggered charge and spin orders .",
    "that charge ordering phenomenon is particularly relevant for manganites , vanadates and various organic conductors , as discussed in a recent theoretical paper @xcite that uses a new correlator - projection method .",
    "the relevant theoretical literature for these compounds focuses on the square lattice @xcite and on ladders for the quarter - filled case @xcite .",
    "the competition between charge and spin orders has also been studied in one- @xcite two- avella:2004 , ohta:1994 , yan:1993 , three- @xcite and higher dimensions @xcite at various fillings .",
    "the combined effect of charge fluctuations in addition to the usual spin fluctuation in favouring one type or another of unconventional superconductivity has also been studied using this model @xcite .    in the present paper , we are interested in the possibility that a generalization of tpsc to the extended hubbard model can lead us to accurate estimations of the charge and spin structure factors and susceptibilities at finite temperature .",
    "we will use the qmc calculations of ref .",
    "( ) as a benchmark .",
    "we note that methods that have been quite successful in one- or infinite dimension are generally not applicable in the two - dimensional case that we will consider . in @xmath5 ,",
    "continuous symmetries can be broken only at zero temperature and , in addition , wave - vector dependencies that are neglected in high - dimension are generally not negligible .    in the following ,",
    "we first present the theory and give the details of the calculation based on the functional derivative of the dyson equation which gives us the response functions of the system .",
    "we also provide the equation of motion for the wigner distribution function to show that the two different methods basically lead to the same set of equations .",
    "this also allows us to discuss the different types of factorizations . in sec .",
    "[ sec4 ] we present the results of our numerical calculations and compare them with qmc results to find the region where the method works properly or is precise enough .",
    "finally , we discuss the influence of nearest - neighbor interaction @xmath2 on spin and charge fluctuations .",

    "there are quantum critical points at zero temperature where the exponential regime ends@xcite . in fig .  7 , the crossover temperature and the range of fillings where antiferromagnetic fluctuations are large both increase or decrease together .",

    "as mentioned above , each site has four nearest - neighbor sites , and our method is quite accurate as long at @xmath198    the apparent breaks in slope on the curves of the last figure correspond to a change from commensurate to incommensurate fluctuations .",
    "we have been using the terms antiferromagnetic and staggered rather loosely .",
    "8 corrects this by presenting the peak position at the crossover temperature of the spin response function ( or spin structure factor ) as a function of filling factor for the same parameters as fig .",
    "the maximum in the spin fluctuations changes with temperature but , at the crossover temperature , it is at a wave vector that is commensurate near half - filling and then becomes incommensurate as we decrease @xmath199 this comes mainly from the change in the peak position of the non - interacting susceptibility , but when @xmath2 is finite there is an also effect that comes from the presence of the cosine functions in the effective interaction appearing in the denominator of eq .",

    "the range of fillings where commensurate fluctuations appear is increased when @xmath200 and decreased when @xmath201 concomitant with the tendency to increase or decrease the antiferromagnetic crossover temperature at half - filling .",

    "the tpsc approach is usually studied in the functional derivative formalism and the stls approach in the wigner distribution function formalism , so we presented derivations in both languages to better illustrate the similarities and differences between the two approaches .    to derive either tpsc or stls , two main approximations are necessary :",
    "first we must factor a four - point correlation function ( two - body density matrix ) and correct the factorization with the pair correlation function ; second , we must treat the functional derivative of the pair correlation function with respect to a fictitious external potential .",
    "the stls factorization of the pair correlation function does not take into account the range of the interaction whereas tpsc does .",
    "in particular , at @xmath128 , the stls approximation involves the pair correlation function for all distances and does not enforce the pauli principle . on the other hand ,",
    "tpsc involves the calculation of @xmath202 only and , in addition , it enforces the pauli principle @xmath203 the pauli principle gives an additional equation that allows an approximate evaluation of the functional derivative entering the charge channel when one neglects the momentum and frequency dependence of that functional derivative . the local approximation ( where the functional derivative is replaced by a derivative with respect to density )",

    "analogous comparisons with the spin and charge structure factors obtained from qmc also show that tpsc is more accurate than stls .",
