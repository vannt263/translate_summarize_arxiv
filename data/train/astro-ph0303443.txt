    "the accretion of gas onto a protostar is accompanied by collimated jets observed in the optical and infrared ( mundt & fried 1983 ; schwartz et al . 1988 ) and swept up molecular gas outflows observed at millimeter wavelengths ( snell , loren , & plambeck 1980 ) .",
    "the resulting transfer of momentum and kinetic energy into a protostar s immediate surroundings may limit further accretion and thereby determine the final stellar mass ( shu , adams , & lizano 1987 ) . the combined effect of multiple outflows averaged over space and time may also regulate future star formation on larger scales by maintaining cloud turbulence ( mckee 1989 )",
    ". this paper addresses the latter issue by analyzing the energy injection rate into a cloud by a collection of very young outflows and the spatial distribution of high velocity gas .",
    "molecular outflows are most powerful in the earliest , class 0 , stage of protostellar evolution ( bontemps et al .",
    "a chain of such young protostars was found by chini et al .",
    "( 1997 ; hereafter c97 ) through mapping dust continuum emission at @xmath6 m along a ridge of dense molecular gas north of the orion nebula .",
    "subsequent maps at @xmath7 m and @xmath8 m were made by lis et al .",
    "( 1998 ) and johnstone & bally ( 1999 ) respectively .",
    "the ridge is split into two main groups , omc-2 in the southern half and omc-3 in the north .",
    "the ratio of sub - millimeter to far - infrared luminosity is higher in omc-3 than in omc-2 suggesting a trend toward younger protostars with increasing distance from the orion nebula ( c97 ; lis et al .",
    "however , all the sources found by c97 are deeply embedded and can be classified as either class 0 or borderline class 0/i .",
    "other papers that are pertinent to this work are @xmath9 m imaging of the @xmath10 s(1 ) line of shock excited 2   by yu , bally , & devine ( 1997 ; hereafter y97 ) and , more recently , stanke , mccaughrean , & zinnecker ( 2002 ; s02 ) .",
    "y97 found 80 knots of 2  emission which they connected into twelve jets from young protostars .",
    "the positions of these knots are used as a guide to deciphering the molecular outflows in the maps presented here .",
    "s02 mapped a much larger region in orion a and confirmed the positions of the y97 knots in omc2/3 .",
    "yu et al . ( 2000 ; hereafter y00 ) followed up their 2  imaging study with molecular line observations of several jets .",
    "c97 also presented molecular line observations . in both cases , the relatively large beamsizes ( @xmath11 ) of these singledish studies together with the high density of protostars and multiple",
    ", overlapping outflows prevented a firm association of molecular outflow gas with 2  jets .",
    "aso et al .",
    "( 2000 ; hereafter a00 ) mapped co(10 ) and denser gas tracers with the largest singledish telescope operating at 3  mm , the nobeyama 45  m , to achieve maps of the outflows at @xmath12 .",
    "they found eight outflows and their map is the most comparable to this work .    because of the high protostellar density in the region , it would be desirable to map the outflows at comparable resolution to the dust continuum maps that identified the young protostars .",
    "only interferometers can achieve such a resolution , @xmath1 , in the low frequency lines that the outflows generally excite .",
    "the ten 6  m antennae that make up bima provide excellent @xmath13coverage and a large primary beam which result in an efficient instrument for creating high resolution , large scale images of the millimeter sky .",
    "this paper presents a multi - field bima mosaic of the co(10 ) emission in the omc2/3 region and shows the network of young molecular outflows from the clustered protostars in unprecedented detail .",
    "the following sections present the observational technique used to produce the map , general results from the data and a description of each of the nine individual outflows that were identified .",
    "the paper concludes with a discussion of the implications of this work for outflow lifetimes , energetics , and cloud turbulence .",
    "a 46-field mosaic was observed with bima four times from october 1998 to march 1999 , twice each in the compact c and d configurations .",
    "baselines ranged from 6  m to 81  m. the total on - source integration time was 14 hours , or slightly less than 20 minutes per field .",
    "amplitude and phase were calibrated using 4 minute observations of 0530 + 135 interleaved with each 23 minute integration on source ( 30 seconds per field ) .",
    "observations of the bright quasar 3c454.3 at the start of each track showed the passband to be flat and no correction was applied .",
    "the flux density scale was set by observing mars during the 1998 observations resulting in a flux for 0530 + 135 of 2.0  jy .",
    "the co line was placed in the upper sideband centered in a 256 channel window with 25  mhz bandwidth with a corresponding velocity resolution of 0.25  .",
    "the total continuum bandwidth was 600  mhz but the integration time per field was too short to obtain more than a noisy detection of the brightest sources in the c97 map .",
    "the data were reduced in the miriad software package ( wright & sault 1993 ) and the final cleaned map had a spatial resolution of @xmath14 at a position angle of @xmath15 and a ( boxcar smoothed ) velocity resolution of 0.5  .",
    "the final map covers @xmath0 at a spatial dynamic range , @xmath16 .",
    "the 46 pointing centers were arranged in a hexagonal grid spaced by @xmath17 .",
    "this resulted in a separation between pointing centers of @xmath18 , about the same as the primary beam of the 6  m antennae",
    ". such a beam sampled mosaic is sensitive to compact structures and is suited to mapping large areas with minimal observing overhead . a comparison between a beam sampled and nyquist sampled mosaic of co outflows in ngc 1333 showed negligible differences ( plambeck & engargiola 2000 ) . the noise level , 0.6  k ( @xmath19 ) per 0.5  velocity channel , was nearly uniform across the final map with a sharp falloff in sensitivity from 80% to 30% over @xmath20 at the map borders .",
    "singledish data were taken at the five college radio astronomy observatory 14  m telescope ( fcrao ) in march 1999 with the 16 element , focal plane array sequoia and a system of autocorrelation spectrometers at a spectral resolution of 78  khz .",
    "the observing was carried out using standard position - switching procedures resulting in a nyquist sampled map with an rms noise of 0.3  k per 0.5  channel .",
    "antenna temperatures were converted to fluxes using a gain of 44.5  jy  k  and added to the bima data to fill in the short spacing information missing from the interferometer map through joint maximum entropy deconvolution .",
    "the addition of the singledish data partially compensates for the spatial filtering properties of the interferometer and makes possible flux recovery of extended objects .",
    "interferometers null out features that are uniform over angular sizes @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the shortest projected baseline separation and @xmath23 is a factor that theoretical considerations suggest may be @xmath24 ( wilner & welch 1994 ) .",
    "however , simulations by helfer et al .",
    "( 2002 ) show that the non - linear deconvolution process can effectively extrapolate structural information to larger values of @xmath23 .",
    "experience suggests that d - array observations are sensitive to angular sizes @xmath25 , i.e. @xmath26 . since the beamsize of the fcrao 14  m at 115  ghz is @xmath27 , the combined bima+fcrao dataset provides information on small scale and large scale structures but poorly represents features on angular scales in the range @xmath28 .",
    "average spectra over the mapped region for each of the two datasets are shown in figure 1 .",
    "in contrast to the singledish map , large areas of the interferometer map have very little emission so the average intensity is much lower .",
    "spectral profiles are also very different ; the fcrao spectrum is centrally peaked with weak extended line - wing emission , but the bima spectrum has a central dip and peaks in the line - wings .",
    "this is due to the spatial filtering properties of interferometers as described above . in this case",
    ", it can be concluded that the bulk of the cloud emission at @xmath29 to 12.5  is relatively smooth over angular scales @xmath30 but that the line - wing emission arises , at least in part , from more compact spatial features ( i.e. collimated outflows ) .",
    "similar singledish / interferometer profiles were observed toward ngc 1333 and hh 7 - 11 by plambeck & engargiola ( 2000 ) .",
    "the bima data accounts for only 0.5% of the flux of the total cloud emission , as measured from the fcrao data , demonstrating how smooth the co emission is . even in the line - wings , however , the bima data only accounts for 4.7% of the emission so a large fraction of the outflow emission must also be spatially extended over @xmath3 angular scales . for this reason outflow properties",
    "are calculated from the combined bima+fcrao dataset that contains the flux of the singledish map .",
    "the broad spatial extent of the high velocity gas has important implications on its origin : either outflows can rapidly distribute their momenta and energy over large regions or most of the line - wing emission arises from a cascade of larger scale processes such as galactic shear ( fleck 1981 ) .",
    "although the bima data accounts for only @xmath31 of the flux of the line - wing emission , the spatial filtering properties of the interferometer are advantageous in isolating the small scale features of collimated outflows .",
    "low and high velocity bima emission is plotted in figure 2 .",
    "several linear features can be seen and some clear outflows , mms5 and mms10 being the best examples , with separated blue - red lobes are apparent .",
    "nine outflows were found in these data and they are shown schematically in the map . all appear to originate from one of the c97 protostars .",
    "the y97 2  knots are also plotted in the figure and were an essential guide in the assignment of the line - wing emission to different outflows .",
    "most 2  knots were found to be associated with co line - wing emission and those that were not appear to be due to outflows in the plane of the sky .",
    "similarly most of the co features in figure 2 can be assigned to an outflow from a c97 protostar but there are also many clumps of high velocity gas whose origin remains unclear .",
    "the identification of each of the nine outflows was made from analysis of channel maps and position - velocity slices in conjunction with the positions of the y97 and s02 2  knots .",
    "physical properties are listed in table 1 ordered by the c97 driving source where mms stands for `` millimeter source '' and fir for `` far - infrared '' . for each outflow",
    "the mass , momentum and energy were determined by first outlining the extent of the blue and red lobes in position and velocity space using interactive cursor - based idl routines and then employing equations 6 and 9 of cabrit & bertout ( 1990 ) .",
    "the combined bima+fcrao dataset was used for the calculations and , following y00 , co line - wing emission was taken to be optically thin and at an excitation temperature of 30  k. eyeball estimates of sizes and velocity gradients were made from the channel maps and position - velocity slices shown in figures 37 .",
    "_ mms2/3 : _ this east - west outflow runs close to the plane of the sky ( figure 3 ) .",
    "there is a very weak red lobe coincident with a string of 2  knots and a compact blue lobe host to a cluster of 2  knots .",
    "because of its orientation , this outflow is one of the longest identified in these maps and only a very slight velocity gradient could be measured across it . mms2 and mms3 are too close to unambiguously identify one over the other as the driving source of this flow .",
    "a large clump of high velocity gas lies to the west that may be an expanding shell or loosely collimated outflow from any of mms2/3 , 4 , 5 or 6 but it is not associated with 2  emission and could not be conclusively connected to any source .",
    "_ mms5 : _ this is a small east - west outflow with blue and red peaks straddling mms5 along the same direction as a line of 3 2knots ( figure 3 ) . the position velocity map ( figure 7 ) along this line shows the second highest velocity gradient measured out of the nine flows and suggests a near pole - on orientation .",
    "two additional 2  knots point to a north - south jet from mms6 ( see also s02 ) but the co emission is too confused in this area to definitively identify the corresponding outflow .    _ mms7 : _ also known as iras 05329 - 0505 this source powers a bright reflection nebula and drives a well collimated , one - sided ( west ) optical jet hh294 ( reipurth , bally , & devine 1997 ) .",
    "y97 found a lone 2  knot @xmath32 to the east that they suggested was the end of a long flow from fir1c .",
    "the data here suggest that this knot is in fact associated with mms7 through a co filament that appears to be an outflow in the plane of the sky ( figure 4 ) .",
    "the line - wing map in figure 2 shows no high velocity gas associated with mms7 but careful inspection of channel maps revealed a linear feature connecting the 2  emission in hh294 with the eastern knot .",
    "this putative outflow is just distinguishable above a broad plateau of cloud emission in a small range of velocities near the systemic motion of the cloud .",
    "its direction is slightly different from the hh294 optical jet but agrees with the position angle of a small 3.6  cm radio jet observed with the vla ( reipurth et al .",
    "because of its orientation in the plane of the sky and immersion in the general cloud emission , no velocity gradient could be measured along the flow and only conservative estimates to its size and mass could be made .    _ mms8 : _ the identification of this flow is the most uncertain of the nine .",
    "channel maps and position - velocity cuts hint at an outflow around mms8 that connects several y97 2  knots ( figure 5 ) but there is confusion from high velocity co emission around mms9 and the dense chain of 2  knots from the well collimated jet that it powers . as originally noted by y00 , the powerful co outflow around mms8 discussed in c97 was misidentified due to erroneous plotting of source positions and is a combination of flows originating from mms9 and mms10 .    _",
    "mms9 : _ a prominent chain of 2  knots reveal a long east - west jet originating from mms9 ( y97 , s02 ) .",
    "the bima data show associated , collimated , high velocity @xmath33  co ( figure 5 ) . on the eastern side of the source ,",
    "the association of both 2  knots and gas is less clear but a long , high velocity collimated flow is discernable and best seen in figure 2 .",
    "the flow occurs over a narrow range of velocities and suggests an orientation in the plane of the sky , consistent with its projected length , almost 1  pc , by far the longest of the nine flows in table 1 .",
    "two compact cores of low velocity gas lie to the west of mms9 and were connected to the high velocity core north of mms10 by both y00 and a00 .",
    "however , the greater resolution of these data clearly demonstrate that the 2  jet is associated with the linear high velocity core @xmath34 further south .",
    "a more diffuse red lobe is also found toward the blue cores which suggests that this feature may be a pole on flow from an unidentified source or an expanding shell from an older outflow .",
    "_ mms10 : _ this is a strong , clearly defined outflow running northeast - southwest ( figure 5 ) .",
    "y00 suggest that the red lobe here is due to the outflow from mms9 . while there is likely to be some contribution from that flow ,",
    "the higher resolution of these data show a clear relationship in space and velocity ( figure 7 ) between mms10 and the strong blue and red lobes on either side of it .",
    "the 2  knots appear to be associated with the edges of the co lobes rather than directly lining up with a single jet from the source itself .",
    "this is one of the more massive flows identified in the cloud .    _",
    "fir1b / c : _ this outflow occurs in a highly confused area of the maps where the source density is high and there are multiple , overlapping flows . because of the large numbers of high velocity co clumps and scattered 2  knots here the identification of this outflow is uncertain",
    "the evidence for an outflow is based on the blue and neighboring red lobes on either side of fir1c and fir1b and 2  knots in close , but not exact , proximity ( figures 5 , 6 ) .",
    "a position velocity cut along a line through the two sources is unable to distinguish one over the other as the driving source ( figure 7 ) .",
    "_ fir2 : _ this is a very weak but high velocity flow running north - south .",
    "the two lobes almost overlap spatially ( figure 6 ) but extend over a wide range in velocity ( figure 7 ) resulting in an extremely high velocity gradient and suggesting a pole - on orientation .",
    "2  knots are found in the vicinity of fir2 but their association with this flow is uncertain and they may well be an extension of the powerful mms10 outflow .",
    "_ fir3 : _ a compact chain of 2  knots and intense , collimated",
    ", high velocity co emission reveal strong outflow activity .",
    "this source is a binary with @xmath35 separation ( pendleton et al .",
    "1986 ) and appears to drive two criss - crossed flows .",
    "channel maps show two blue lobes and a single , long , red lobe ( figure 6 ) .",
    "the position - velocity map in figure 7 shows the two blue lobes more clearly .",
    "their red lobe counterparts can be seen in the two lowest contour levels of the merged high velocity emission in the same figure .",
    "the sum of these two flows inject the most mass , momentum , and energy into the cloud of the nine flows discussed in this work .",
    "in addition , a potential tenth flow is seen in the bima map ( dashed line in figure 2 ) .",
    "this connects a single 2  knot in the southwest with a chain of high velocity clumps that appear to connect back to fir3 .",
    "it was , however , not possible to distinguish this flow clearly in the combined bima+fcrao dataset due to its length , lack of strong velocity gradient , and the confusion of background cloud emission .",
    "the omc-2 and omc-3 regions are highly active star forming centers with multiple , overlapping outflows .",
    "high resolution , large scale co mapping allows more secure identification of the flows and their driving sources and makes possible the determination of fundamental physical properties such as mass , momentum , and energy . in practice ,",
    "low and high velocity clumps are found to be widely distributed across the map and , particularly for the flows in the plane of the sky , it was essential to use the y97 and s02 2  maps to assign these features to outflows driven by a given source .",
    "the nine identified co outflows line up with @xmath36 of the 60 y97 2  knots in the mapped region .",
    "there were no clearly identifiable bipolar co outflows that were not associated with detectable molecular hydrogen shocks .",
    "this is partly , but not completely , due to the way in which the high velocity gas is assigned to outflows .",
    "the additional information provided by the co data , however , shows that the extremes of some of the jets found by y97 appear to be misidentified .",
    "for example , in y97 the 2  knots 74/77 , 76 and 79 define the ends of jets i , e and j respectively but the co data show that these knots are more likely to be associated with flows from closer sub - millimeter sources , mms10 , mms7 and either mms9 or 10 respectively .",
    "these jets are likely , therefore , to be significantly smaller than previously thought . on the other hand ,",
    "the mms2/3 and mms9 flows that lie in the plane of the sky appear to have a measurable effect on the co emission over a sizeable fraction of a parsec in length as has been well established for optical jets ( reipurth & bally 2001 ) .",
    "the large scale effect of outflows may also be apparent in the `` missing flux '' in the bima map due to structures that are larger than @xmath3 . over 95% of the line - wing emission",
    "is resolved out by the interferometer demonstrating that the high velocity gas is broadly distributed .",
    "similarly , a map of the co line - width at @xmath37 resolution made from the combined dataset is generally featureless across the cloud away from a few peaks toward individual sources such as fir3 and some 2  knots along the mms9 flow .",
    "the fact that the line - wing emission is widely distributed complicates the definition of the boundaries of the outflows and the measurement of their physical properties .",
    "additional uncertainties are the optical depth of the co line - wing emission and the inclination of the flow to our line of sight .",
    "since there are no @xmath38co observations at the same resolution , optically thin emission was assumed , providing a lower limit to the mass and kinematic estimates .",
    "no inclination correction was applied to the individual flow momenta and energies listed in table 1 since it is difficult to determine accurately .",
    "assuming , however , a mean inclination of @xmath39 for the outflow sample , total values of the mass , momenta and energy are @xmath40 , @xmath41  and @xmath42  erg respectively .",
    "the variation in masses of individual outflows is about a factor of five but the velocities do not greatly differ and the range of momenta and energies is only a factor of six .",
    "there is no clear correlation between outflow properties and the c97 driving source mass or luminosity .",
    "velocity gradients , @xmath43 , measured by eyeball fits to the position - velocity diagrams in figure 7 , are given in table 1 .",
    "velocity gradients for the two long outflows from mms2/3 and mms9 that lie nearly in the plane of the sky could not be accurately measured .",
    "the inverse of the gradient in  pc  is approximately the dynamical time in myr .",
    "the median dynamical time in this sample is @xmath44  yr which is similar to the statistical lifetime of class 0 protostars in the @xmath45 oph cluster ( andr & montmerle 1994 ) .",
    "however , the identification of the outflows here suffers from a bias toward either high velocity gradients or sharp , collimated features that stand out against the general cloud emission .",
    "the former corresponds to short dynamical timescales and the latter is a probable indication of youth ( masson & chernin 1993 ) .",
    "it is not necessarily surprising , then , that all nine flows described in this paper appear to be driven by a young class 0 , or borderline class 0/i , protostar in the c97 catalog .",
    "the dynamical time is only a lower limit to the age of an outflow ( parker , padman , & scott 1991 ) but is probably a good estimator for the young outflows observed here ( masson & chernin 1993 ) . if only the very youngest outflows , @xmath46  yr , have been identified , but ( less well collimated ) outflow activity continues throughout the class i phase , @xmath47  yr ( wilking et al .",
    "1989 ) , then the broadly distributed line - wing emission that was resolved out in the bima map can be accounted for by outflows alone . in principle",
    ", they should be apparent in a combined singledish+interferometer map such as the one presented in this paper , but higher signal - to - noise data are required to pick them out from the general cloud background .",
    "this paper has focused on the high velocity gas that can be identified with shocked 2  emission but there are several other high velocity clumps in figure 2 that were not associated with outflows .",
    "these unassigned clumps may be parts of older outflow shells which have broadened and slowed sufficiently such that the shocks with the ambient medium are too weak to excite the 2  @xmath48 m line .",
    "earlier single dish maps of co in orion indeed found several large scale , slowly expanding shells that were interpreted as resulting from young stellar outflows ( heyer et al .",
    "1992 ) .",
    "it has long been suggested that outflows can maintain cloud turbulence ( e.g. , norman & silk 1980 ) .",
    "the agreement between the ratio of class 0 to class i lifetimes , and the flux ratio between collimated and broad outflows , suggests an approximately uniform energy input into the cloud that can be estimated from the observed co outflows here , @xmath49 where @xmath50 is a factor that corrects for the assumption of optically thin co line - wing emission in the calculation of the outflow masses and energies .",
    "cabrit & bertout ( 1990 ) show that @xmath50 lies in the range @xmath51 .",
    "the cloud loses energy through turbulent decay .",
    "simulations of magnetohydrodynamic cloud turbulence show rapid dissipation with a timescale , @xmath52 where @xmath53 is the driving wavelength of the turbulence in units of the jean s length , @xmath54 is the rms mach number of the turbulence , and @xmath55 is the free - fall timescale ( maclow 1999 ) . the mass of the omc-2/3 complex is @xmath56 ( lis et al .",
    "the average temperature and 1-d velocity dispersion can be measured from the fcrao spectrum in figure  1 and are equal to 20  k and 1.5  respectively .",
    "the equivalent radius , measured from the projected area , is 0.9  pc , and implies an average number density , @xmath57  .",
    "these numbers imply a total kinetic ( turbulent ) energy @xmath58  erg , mach number @xmath59 , and free - fall time @xmath60  yr .",
    "parameterizing by @xmath61 , the dissipation time is @xmath62  yr , and the turbulent energy dissipation rate is , @xmath63    the average cloud density and temperature imply a jean s length , @xmath64  pc .",
    "if outflows sustain the turbulence , the driving wavelength can be no greater than their size @xmath65 .",
    "the average outflow length in table  1 , corrected for an average inclination angle of @xmath39 , is @xmath66  pc .",
    "thus @xmath67 .",
    "shorter wavelength `` harmonics '' may also be present , however , and maclow ( 1999 ) argues that the driving wavelength must be less than the jean s length , i.e. @xmath68 , for turbulence to support the cloud .",
    "taking @xmath69 and the maximum co optical depth correction @xmath70 , the data are consistent with an approximate balance between outflow energy injection rate and turbulent energy dissipation rate , @xmath71    to maintain the cloud turbulence over longer timescales than an individual protostar s outflow lifetime requires a star formation rate @xmath72  yrfor an average protostellar mass of @xmath73 based on the scalo ( 1986 ) imf . at this rate",
    "the omc-2/3 complex has enough mass to continue forming low mass stars for @xmath74  yr where @xmath75 is the overall star formation efficiency .",
    "even if the cloud ultimately converts most of its mass to stars , therefore , the high rate of turbulent energy dissipation restricts its lifetime to a few myr .",
    "this is shorter than predicted for more massive gmcs ( blitz & shu 1980 ; williams & mckee 1997 ) but consistent with the rapid cloud formation and evolution scenario proposed by hartmann , ballesteros - paredes & bergin ( 2001 ) and the observed small age spread of protostars in nearby star forming regions ( hartmann 2001 ) .",
