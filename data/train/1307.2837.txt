    "the use of molecules as electronic components is expected to surpass , at least temporally , one of the limits imposed to moore s law as the size of the electronic components shrinks towards the atomic limit .",
    "their particular properties would allow to develop more involved and efficient circuits and electronic devices with sizes much smaller that conventional silicon - based devices@xcite . among the properties that molecules in metallic junctions can show",
    "are rectification@xcite , negative differential resistance@xcite , switching@xcite , memory@xcite and sensing@xcite . adding a thermal gradient or a coupling to a thermal bath@xcite",
    "would also allow molecules to work as nanometer - size thermoelectric devices@xcite , which could be used in applications ranging from chip cooling to building refrigerators .",
    "one of the thermoelectric coefficients , the seebeck coefficient @xmath0 , is also specially suited to gather information on the mechanisms of molecular conduction@xcite and the chemistry of the junction@xcite .",
    "for instance , from the sign of @xmath0 it is possible to deduce if the fermi level lies close to the homo or the lumo orbital@xcite .",
    "a positive ( negative ) sign indicates @xmath1-type ( @xmath2-type ) conduction , which means the fermi level lies near the homo ( lumo ) .",
    "this implies that the sign and magnitude of the thermopower can be changed by gating the molecule@xcite .",
    "the seebeck coefficient is also a very sensible magnitude that depends on factors such as the molecular length@xcite , the molecular conformation@xcite , the contact group@xcite , the side groups@xcite , the surface reconstruction@xcite and the type of electrodes@xcite .",
    "the most important quantity that measures the thermoelectric efficiency of a system is the dimensionless figure of merit @xmath3 , which is proportional to the square of the seebeck coefficient ( @xmath0 ) and the conductance ( @xmath4 ) , and inversely proportional to the thermal conductance ( @xmath5 ) .",
    "this number , which determines how easy it is to transform heat into electricity , should be as high as possible ( closer to 1 or higher ) in order for a thermoelectric device to work effectively .",
    "values larger than 1 ( @xmath6 ) have already been measured in inorganic superlattice devices@xcite . in the field of molecular electronics , however , despite current efforts@xcite , the measured @xmath0 and @xmath7 are not yet very high ( @xmath8 @xmath9v / k@xcite and @xmath10@xcite ) .",
    "theoretical calculations predict that much higher values should be achieved when fano resonances@xcite or interference - related peaks@xcite cross the fermi level , but such predictions have not been confirmed experimentally yet .",
    "these values , calculated in the framework of coherent transport , should also be corrected by taking into account the phonon thermal conductance@xcite , inelastic scattering@xcite and , in general , coupling to phonons@xcite .    in this article",
    "we calculate the thermoelectric coefficients and figure of merit of molecules which show intereference - related features around the fermi level@xcite in the form of breit - wigner - like and fano resonances . in section [ thcoeff ]",
    "we give a brief theoretical introduction on the thermoelectric coefficients . in next section , [ firstp ] ,",
    "we include ab - initio simulations of molecular wires ( metalloporphyrins dithiolate ) .",
    "finally , in section [ tightb ] we present a model that can be used to study the evolution of the thermoelectric properties of molecular wires as a function of a series of parameters , among which are included the type of resonance that crosses the fermi level , which is related to the symmetry of the state , the strength of coupling between the resonance and other molecular levels and the coupling between the molecule and the electrodes .",
    "when a junction is subject to an electrostatic potential difference and a temperature gradient , electric and heat current flow from one electrode to another . with just an electrostatic potential ,",
    "electrons move from the negative to the positive electrode , whereas the electric current is defined to flow in the opposite direction . with a temperature gradient",
    ", however , there is no rule of thumb that allows one to determine how the current flows without accurate information on the electronic structure , i.e. the transmission , of the junction . if the transmission below the fermi level is higher , electrons flow from the cold to the hot electrode , whereas the contrary happens if the transmission is higher above the fermi level . the electrostatic potential and the temperature gradient generate also a heat current which in general flows from the hot to the cold electrode . for a system with spin polarization@xcite , this is summarized in the following equation :    @xmath11    where @xmath12 and @xmath13 are the electric and heat currents , respectively , and the moments @xmath14 ( @xmath15 ) of the transmission coefficients are given by@xcite    @xmath16    where @xmath17 is the fermi distribution function , which depends on voltage and temperature .",
    "equation ( [ eq1 ] ) can be expressed in terms of measurable thermoelectric quantities : the electric conductance ( @xmath4 ) , thermopower ( @xmath0 ) , peltier coefficient ( @xmath18 ) and the electronic contribution to the thermal conductance ( @xmath5 ) :    @xmath19    where    @xmath20    @xmath21    @xmath22    @xmath23    notice that , according to these formulae , in order to produce the highest thermopower it is necessary to have the factor in the denominator ( @xmath24 ) as small as possible .",
    "however , as we will see later , in a system with spin polarization both channels are usually different around the fermi level , one of them being much larger than the other in some cases , which decreases the value of @xmath0 .",
    "the figure of merit can also be expressed in terms of the transmission moments by substituting the above expressions in the @xmath7 definition :    @xmath25    in this case the figure of merit becomes large when the factor of the moments in the denominator decreases towards 1 .",
    "approximations to these expressions can be obtained in the limit of low temperatures by expanding @xmath26 about @xmath27 , which we take equal to 0 ev . in case of a single level coupled to featureless leads",
    ", whose transmission is given by a breit - wigner resonance ,    @xmath28    where @xmath29 is the strength of coupling of the level to the leads and @xmath30 is the energy of the level , the low - t bias conductance , seebeck coefficient and figure of merit are given by :    @xmath31    where @xmath32 and @xmath33 are the electrical and thermal conductance quantum units , and @xmath34 .",
    "for a fano resonance produced by a side level with the same on - site energy as the backbone level ( @xmath30 ) , and coupled to this last one by a matrix element @xmath35 , the transmission is    @xmath36 ^ 2+\\gamma^2(e-\\epsilon_0)^2}\\ ] ]    and the thermoelectric coefficients @xmath4 and @xmath0 and figure of merit are given by    @xmath37    where @xmath38 $ ] .",
    "notice the fano resonance diverges at @xmath39 , which is an unphysical singularity .",
    "this can be avoided by including a background transmission due to other resonances , which are always present in realistic systems .    with these expressions",
    "it is then possible to calculate the thermoelectric coefficients in a given junction , provided the transmission is known . in general , in order to obtain large @xmath0 and @xmath7 it is convenient to have large derivatives around the fermi level , since the first moment ( @xmath40 ) is , at least at low temperatures , proportional to the derivative of the transmission .",
    "notice again that these expressions can only be used at low temperatures , but qualitative trends derived from them ( i.e. the overall shape of the thermoelectric coefficients as a function of the level position ) are still valid at large temperatures .",
    "molecular junctions that show sharp features around the fermi level could very good candidates to act as thermoelectric enhancers . in particular , molecular junctions based on metalloporphyrin wires , which have recently been subjected to a lot of interest ,",
    "both theoretically@xcite and experimentally@xcite , show , for certain metallic elements , a series of resonances close to the fermi level which can be breit - wigner or fano - like .",
    "this property makes them specially appealing for thermoelectricity , since such resonances can be employed to finely tune the thermoelectric response with a gate voltage ( see below ) .    in order to have a clear picture of the influence of the electronic properties on the thermoelectric response we initially calculated from first principles the electronic and transport properties of metalloporphyrin dithiolate molecules between gold electrodes . in next section",
    "we pay attention to the most important features of these systems with the help of a simple model .",
    "the metallic elements which produce states close to the fermi level are fe and cu atoms@xcite .",
    "we therefore focus on this study only on fe and cu metalloporphyrins dithiolate .",
    "the first - principles calculations were performed in the framework of density functional theory ( dft)@xcite .",
    "we used the siesta code@xcite , which employs norm conserving pseudopotentials and a basis set of pseudoatomic orbitals .",
    "we included non - linear core corrections@xcite in the transition - metal pseudopotentials to correctly account for the overlap between the valence and the core states .",
    "we used for gold a single-@xmath41 basis ( sz ) with explicit @xmath42 and @xmath43 orbitals as valence orbitals .",
    "for all the other elements ( h , c , o , n , s and transition - metal ) we used a double-@xmath41 polarized basis ( dzp ) .",
    "the exchange and correlation potential was approximated with the generalized gradient approximation(gga ) , as parameterized by perdew , burke and ernzernhof@xcite .",
    "we defined the real space grid with an energy cutoff of 400 ry .",
    "we performed the structural relaxations and transport calculations in the @xmath29 point , which was enough to relax the coordinates and correctly determine the transmission around the fermi level .",
    "we also did tests with @xmath44points ( 2x2 in the perpendicular directions ) and the results were essentially the same around the fermi level .",
    "we relaxed the coordinates until all forces were smaller than 0.01 ev /  .",
    "we corrected the self - interaction and other errors produced by dft by using the dft@xmath45 approach , which yields qualitatively correct results in systems with transition - metal atoms@xcite . adding this parameter to the central metallic atom was equivalent to adding a gate potential which moves the states associated to it , as we shall see .",
    "take into account however that without a gate voltage only the results with @xmath46 can be trusted . to reproduce previous theoretical results for the gas - phase iron metalloporphyrin@xcite",
    ", we used @xmath47 ev .",
    "this value was also employed in the molecule between electrodes and in other metallic elements .",
    "notice that small differences in the @xmath46-term due to the electrodes or other metallic atoms do not affect the results and the only effect is a slight movement of the resonances around the fermi level , which produces qualitatively similar results .",
    "structurally , the gold electrodes were grown in the ( 001 ) direction .",
    "the sulfur atoms were contacted to the gold surfaces in the hollow position , which was found to be more stable than the top and bottom configurations , at a distance of 1.8  .",
    "the transport calculations were performed with the smeagol and gollum codes@xcite . according to the transport formalism junction",
    "was divided in three parts : left and right leads and extended molecule ( em ) , which included the central part of the junction and also some layers of the gold leads to make sure that the electronic structure was converged to the bulk electronic structure away from the surfaces .",

    "when the @xmath46-term is added the resonance moves to higher energies and its effect on the transmission around the fermi level decreases . in the cu case , however , there seems to be a sharp breit - wigner resonance which moves also to higher energies when the @xmath46-term is included .",

    "the results are shown in figs .",
    "( [ thp.fe.gga ] ) and ( [ thp.cu.gga ] ) . the temperature dependence on the horizontal axis enters in the fermi distribution function , as explained before . in the case of iron",
    "the electric conductance is almost constant , whereas the thermal conductance increases roughly linearly with temperature .",
    "the seebeck coefficient , which is negative and signals that the fermi level is close to the lumo , is relatively large and its evolution with temperature qualitatively changes when the @xmath46-term is included and the state moves to higher energies .",
    "the same happens to the figure of merit , but it is rather small . these evolutions can be explained by taking into account the spin - polarized fano resonance , which is a bit above the fermi level and produces large changes in the derivative of the transmission ( @xmath40 ) without @xmath46 but move to higher energies when the @xmath46-term is included and therefore leave an smoother transmission at the fermi level .",

    "again , the electric conductance is rather constant and the thermal conductance increases linearly .",
    "the seebeck coefficient shows however a dip at low temperatures , and becomes almost constant as the temperature increases .",
    "the dip disappears when the state moves to higher energies and the magnitude decreases to more negative values with @xmath49 .",
    "the figure of merit is again small but has a peak at low temperatures .",
    "such peak disappears when the @xmath46-term is included and is substituted by a smooth increase .",
    "this evolution is a consequence of the presence at the fermi level of a sharp spin - polarized resonance which moves closer to the lumo when the @xmath46-term is included .",
    "such resonance , which is just a bit above the fermi level gives rise to large derivatives and therefore dramatically increases , in absolute value , the seebeck coefficient @xmath0 .",
    "this coefficient is however not very large because the sum of the transmission ( @xmath50 ) of both spin channels is not small .",
    "the copper molecule could be a candidate to show large thermoelectric properties due to the presence of a resonance close to the fermi level .",
    "however , the introduction of the @xmath46 moves the resonance to higher energies and decreases the thermoelectric response .",
    "it is then interesting to consider the case of applying a gate voltage that brings back the resonance to the fermi level .",
    "we show that in fig .",
    "( [ thp.gate.gga ] ) . as can be seen , moving the resonance to lower energies increases the absolute value of both @xmath0 and @xmath7@xcite .",
    "the highest values are obtained when the largest slope of the resonance is just at the fermi level ( @xmath51 v ) . beyond that point @xmath0 and @xmath7 decrease ( @xmath52 v ) .",
    "the increase of the thermoelectric properties is not very spectacular however due to the fact that the resonance is not extremely sharp .",
    "more acute resonances can be however obtained by decreasing the coupling between the molecule and the gold electrodes , which reduces the width of all transmission features .",
    "we show in fig .",
    "( [ thp.gate.d_0.8.gga ] ) results for a system where the distance between the gold electrodes and the sulphur atoms on each side increases by 0.8   relative to the equilibrium configuration . as can be seen ,",
    "now the resonance is very sharp and the changes in the thermoelectric properties are more spectacular .",
    "notice that the thermopower changes sign when the resonance crosses the fermi level due to the change of slope . based on these results",
    "we can claim that stretching molecular electronic junctions increase in general the thermoelectric performance .",
    "the most important features in the transmission of metalloporphins dithiolate junctions can be reproduced with a simple model . with such model",
    "we have analysed in detail the impact of fano resonances on the charge transport properties of these systems@xcite .",
    "we have found that these molecules contribute with three broad resonances to the transmission coefficients of the junctions , which correspond to the homo-1 ( a @xmath53 molecular orbital ) , the homo and the lumo ( that has @xmath54 character ) . in addition",
    ", the 3d - atom contributes with a spin - polarized strongly localized state , which hybridizes with the homo-1 or the lumo , depending on the element , and gives rise to a fano resonance . to model these junctions",
    ", we use the hamiltonian    @xmath55     seebeck coefficient @xmath0 ( 1 ) and figure of merit @xmath7 ( 2 ) for a model system with a fano ( a ) and a breit - wigner - like ( b ) resonance in the homo - lumo gap , calculated at @xmath56 k. in the case of the fano ( breit - wigner - like ) resonance the coupling between the @xmath54 ( @xmath53 ) level and the @xmath43 level is @xmath57 ev ( @xmath58 ev ) , which corresponds to the continuous ( dashed ) lines . ]",
    "where the operators @xmath59 represent the homo-1 , homo and lumo molecular levels . the operator @xmath60 represents the @xmath43 level associated to the central metallic atom .",
    "we assume that this level couples only to either the homo-1 or to the lumo levels ( e.g. : only @xmath61 or @xmath62 are different from zero ) . we assume a wide band approximation for the band structure of the gold electrodes , so that its density of states @xmath63 and therefore the gamma matrices ( @xmath64 ) are constant .",
    "finally , we assume that the @xmath43-level is spin - polarized so that only the spin - up @xmath43-level enters the relevant energy window .    by using this model",
    "we have found@xcite that the presence of two types of resonances can be explained by how the @xmath43 state couples to other molecular states .",
    "if the @xmath43 state couples to the homo-1 , which is a @xmath53-like molecular orbital , the state produces around the fermi level a resonance which looks like a breit - wigner resonance .",
    "such peak comes really from a fano resonance , whose dip is note seen because it is masked by the larger transmission around the fermi level .",
    "if the @xmath43 state couples however to the lumo orbital a clear fano resonance appears around the fermi level because the dip affects the transmission of the lumo , which is not completely masked by the transmission of other states .      from the transmission it is easy to obtain the thermoelectric coefficients by using the equations in section [ thcoeff ] .",
    "we focus specially in the thermopower and figure of merit , which are the most relevant for thermoelectric efficiency . since we can easily vary the parameters of the model we study different effects such as the movement of the states across the fermi level and the change of the coupling between the @xmath43 state and other molecular states or between the molecule and the leads .",
    "we show in fig .",
    "( [ thp.model ] ) the thermopower and figure of merit calculated at @xmath56 k for fano and breit - wigner - like resonances as a function of the position of the state that gives rise to them .",
    "as can be seen the thermopower shows a peak - dip structure , which is a consequence of the change of the derivative of the transmission as the resonance crosses @xmath65 .",
    "such structure is asymmetric in the first case because the fano resonance is also asymmetric , as it is made of a resonance followed by an antiresonance . in the second case",
    "it is also slightly asymmetric because the resonance is not exactly in the middle of the homo - lumo gap .",
    "the figure of merit , which reaches values as high as 0.86 , follows roughly the square of the thermopower and therefore has two peaks and a dip , which corresponds to the highest point of each resonance .",
    "notice also both quantities @xmath0 and @xmath7 are larger in the fano case due to more pronounced changes in the derivative when the antiresonance follows the resonance .",
    "seebeck coefficient @xmath0 in units of @xmath9v / k for model metalloporphyrins dithiolate which have a fano - like resonance around the fermi level , as a function of temperature @xmath49 ( in kelvin ) and the level position @xmath30 ( in ev ) .",

    "one effect that can influence the values of the thermopower and figure of merit is the coupling @xmath35 between the @xmath43 level and the corresponding molecular level .",
    "this can be done e.g. by using a different metallic atom or straining / compressing the molecule . as can be seen ,",
    "changing such coupling increases the absolute value of both quantities , specially in the breit - wigner - like case , but the change is not very large because the only difference in the transmission is due to an increase of the width of the resonances , which does not affect the derivative too much .",
    "this seems to indicate a relative robustness of the absolute value of @xmath0 and @xmath7 as a function of the metallic atom or small molecular conformation changes . when the coupling increase there is also a movement of the peaks and dips to lower or higher energies , which is produced by the increase of the separation between levels .",
