    "in this paper we consider two families of hyperelliptic curves over @xmath0 : @xmath5 for @xmath3 , these equations define hyperelliptic curves of genus 3 with good reduction at primes @xmath6 for which @xmath7 ( in fact ,  @xmath8 also has good reduction at @xmath9 ) . for each such @xmath10",

    "up to dimension 3 , the sato - tate group of an abelian variety defined over a number field @xmath23 is determined by its ring of endomorphisms over an algebraic closure of @xmath23 .",

    "the problem of analysing the frobenius trace distributions and determining the sato - tate groups that arise in these two families was originally posed as part of a course given by the authors at the winter school _ frobenius distributions on curves _ held in february , 2014 , at the centre international de rencontres mathmatiques in luminy .",
