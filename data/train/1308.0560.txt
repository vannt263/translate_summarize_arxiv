    "theoretical investigations of systems of strongly correlated electrons in strong magnetic fields were started shortly after the discovery of the high-@xmath6 superconductivity .",
    "a number of works was carried out on small clusters using the exact diagonalization ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "it is worth noting that due to the peierls factor @xcite , the translation symmetry of the system is changed @xcite  in the magnetic field the size of the elementary cell increases significantly .",
    "clusters with sizes smaller than the size of this supercell violate the symmetry of the hamiltonian and , therefore , it is difficult to extend the obtained results to larger crystals .",
    "another approximation used for this problem is the mean - field approximation ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the main shortcoming of this approximation is the neglect of the dynamic interaction of fermions with spin excitations .",
    "this interaction defines the fermion dispersion in the underdoped case .",
    "the investigation of a system with strong electron correlations in the magnetic field is of interest in connection with the observation of quantum oscillations in the mixed state of underdoped yttrium cuprates @xcite .",
    "based on the onsager - lifshitz - kosevich theory for metals @xcite the observed decreased quantum oscillation frequencies were interpreted as a manifestation of small fermi surface pockets @xcite , despite the fact that this interpretation seems to be in contradiction with numerous photoemission experiments . to explain the appearance of these small pockets proposals for various states with broken translational symmetry",
    "were suggested @xcite .",
    "other theories for explaining the decreased quantum oscillation frequency suppose that it is connected with superconducting fluctuations @xcite or use phenomenology of the marginal fermi liquid @xcite .",
    "crystals , in which the decreased quantum oscillation frequencies were observed , belong to the underdoped region of the cuprate phase diagram , and , therefore , they are characterized by strong electron correlations . theoretically the behavior of such crystals in strong magnetic fields is poorly known . in this work we use an approach , which allows us to overcome some limitations of the approximations used earlier for this problem .",
    "the approach provides a way to consider large enough clusters and moderate magnetic fields , taking into account the interaction of holes with spin excitations .",
    "we use the exact diagonalization of the kinetic term of the two - dimensional ( 2d ) @xmath0-@xmath1 model of cu - o planes .",
    "the term contains the peierls factor describing the influence of the homogeneous magnetic field perpendicular to the plane . as known @xcite ,",
    "the energy spectrum of the kinetic term consists of the landau subbands , which substitute the landau levels in the lattice problem .",
    "the influence of strong electron correlations on these subbands is investigated using the mori projection operator technique @xcite .",
    "it should be noted that due to the complexity of the problem we were able to calculate only a few terms of the continued fraction of green s function .",
    "therefore , the obtained zero - field normal - state spectrum does not contain the pseudogap , which appears in other approaches both in the @xmath0-@xmath1 and hubbard models @xcite . since in the pseudogap the density of states ( dos ) does not completely vanish",
    ", we nevertheless suppose that the used approximation gives at least qualitatively a correct picture of the normal - state energy spectrum of the @xmath0-@xmath1 model in the perpendicular magnetic field .    in the used approximation , in the normal state the model has a large fermi surface for the hole concentrations @xmath7 .",
    "we found that in the range @xmath3 the density of hole states oscillates with frequency for a fixed field @xmath5 and with @xmath2 at the fermi level .",
    "the frequency of these latter oscillations with @xmath2 conforms with the large fermi surface .",
    "however , the amplitude of these high - frequency oscillations is modulated with a frequency which is smaller by an order of magnitude .",
    "the appearance of this modulation is related to van hove singularities in the landau subbands , which traverse the fermi level with changing @xmath5 .",
    "these van hove singularities are connected with bending the landau subbands due to the influence of strong correlations .",
    "the frequency of the modulation is of the same order of magnitude as the quantum oscillation frequency observed in underdoped cuprates .",
    "one of the main models used for the description of cu - o planes of cuprate superconductors is the 2d @xmath0-@xmath1 model .",
    "the hamiltonian of this model in the magnetic field , which is perpendicular to the plane , reads @xmath8 where 2d vectors @xmath9 and @xmath10 label sites of a square plane lattice , @xmath11 is the projection of the hole spin , @xmath12 and @xmath13 are hole creation and annihilation operators with the empty @xmath14 and singly occupied @xmath15 site states .",
    "these three states form the complete set of hole states for the site * l * in the @xmath0-@xmath1 model .",
    "the first term of the hamiltonian , the hole kinetic energy @xmath16 , contains the hopping matrix element @xmath17 and the exponential factor with the peierls phase @xcite , in which @xmath18 is the vector potential .",
    "the second term on the right - hand side of ( [ hamiltonian ] ) is the exchange energy of localized spins with the exchange constant @xmath19 and the spin-@xmath20 operators @xmath21 and @xmath22 .",
    "the last , zeeman term of the hamiltonian contains the g - factor @xmath23 , the bohr magneton @xmath24 and the magnetic induction @xmath5 of the external magnetic field .",
    "it is supposed that this field is homogeneous and is only weakly disturbed by internal currents @xcite .    in the following consideration",
    "we shall suppose that only the nearest neighbor hopping and exchange constants are nonzero , @xmath25 where @xmath26 are four vectors connecting nearest neighbor sites . in cuprate perovskites , the exchange constant @xmath1 is of the order of 100  mev . comparing the interaction energy between a spin with its four neighbors ( the second term of the hamiltonian ) and the energy of the spin in the external field ( the third term of the hamiltonian ) one can ascertain that the former energy is two orders of magnitude larger than the latter even for fields of the order of 50  t. therefore , the zeeman term of the hamiltonian can be neglected .    in the landau gauge @xmath27 , where @xmath28 is the @xmath29 component of the site vector @xmath9 and @xmath30 is the unit vector along the @xmath4 axis ( the 2d lattice is located in the @xmath31 plane , and the field",
    "is directed along the @xmath32 axis ) .",
    "hence the exponential in the kinetic term of the hamiltonian can be written as @xmath33    in the following discussion we shall restrict our consideration to the fields satisfying the condition @xmath34 where @xmath35 and @xmath36 is an integer . in this case the kinetic term of the hamiltonian defines its translation properties ",
    "@xmath16 is invariant with respect to translations by the lattice period along the @xmath4 axis and by @xmath36 lattice periods along the @xmath29 axis . to retain this symmetry we apply the periodic born - von karman boundary conditions to the sample with @xmath37 sites along the @xmath4 axis and @xmath38 sites along the @xmath29 axis .",
    "the boundary conditions define the set of allowed wave vectors with components @xmath39 and @xmath40 with integer @xmath41 and @xmath42 .",
    "as can be seen from ( [ pphase ] ) and ( [ condition ] ) , the momenta @xmath43 coincide with one of the wave vectors in this net .",
    "therefore , in @xmath16 we can perform the usual fourier transformation @xmath44 using the known result @xmath45 for the wave vector @xmath46 on the net . here",
    "@xmath47 and @xmath48 with integer @xmath49 and @xmath50 .",
    "after the fourier transformation the kinetic term acquires the form @xmath51 in deriving ( [ kterm ] ) we took into account that @xmath52 .",
    "it is convenient to split the brillouin zone into @xmath36 stripes of the width @xmath53 , which are oriented parallel to the @xmath4 axis .",
    "if we select one of these stripes , say , the lowest one with @xmath54 , and denote wave vectors in it as @xmath55 , momenta in the entire brillouin zone can be described as @xmath56 . here",
    "@xmath57 and @xmath58 . in these notations",
    "the kinetic energy acquires the form @xmath59 where the summation over @xmath55 is performed over the selected stripe , @xmath60 @xmath61 and @xmath62 .",
    "the cyclic hermitian matrix ( [ hmatr ] ) can be diagonalized by the unitary transformation @xmath63 & & \\label{transf}\\\\[-1ex ] & & \\sum_{j ' } h_{{\\bf k}jj'}u_{{\\bf k}j'm}=e_{{\\bf k}m}u_{{\\bf k}jm}. \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] this diagonalization gives the dispersion of the landau subbands @xmath64 of uncorrelated carriers in the reduced brillouin zone , which coincides with the above - mentioned lowest stripe .",
    "the applied procedure for deriving this dispersion is equivalent to the usually used approach , in which the magnetic supercell is introduced ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the derivation of the kinetic - energy matrix ( [ hmatr ] ) is simpler in our approach .",
    "since the kinetic energy defines symmetry properties of the total hamiltonian ( [ hamiltonian ] ) , states corresponding to operators @xmath65 in ( [ transf ] ) are appropriate starting states for the consideration of the influence of spin excitations on hole states . for this purpose",
    "we calculate green s function @xmath66 where the averaging over the grand canonical ensemble and the operator time dependence are determined by the hamiltonian @xmath67 , @xmath68 @xmath69 and @xmath70 are the inverse temperature and the chemical potential , respectively .",
    "green s function ( [ green ] ) does not depend on the spin projection .    to calculate this function we use the mori projection operator technique @xcite . in this approach ,",
    "the fourier transform of green s function ( [ green ] ) is represented by the continued fraction @xmath71 where the elements of the fraction are obtained from the recurrence relations @xcite @xmath72-v_{k-1}a_{k-1}-e_k a_k,\\nonumber\\\\ & & e_k=\\left\\langle\\left\\{[a_k,{\\cal h}],a_k^\\dagger\\right\\}\\right\\rangle   \\left\\langle\\left\\{a_k , a_k^\\dagger\\right\\}\\right\\rangle^{-1 } ,   \\nonumber\\\\[-1.5ex ] & & \\label{rrelations}\\\\[-1.5ex ] & & v_k=\\left\\langle\\left\\ { a_{k+1},a_{k+1}^\\dagger\\right\\}\\right\\rangle \\left\\langle\\left\\{a_k , a_k^\\dagger\\right\\}\\right\\rangle^{-1},\\nonumber\\\\ & & v_{-1}=0,\\ ; a_0=\\alpha_{{\\bf k}m\\sigma},\\ ; k=0,1,2\\ldots\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] operators @xmath73 depend on @xmath55 , @xmath74 and @xmath75 and numbers @xmath76 and @xmath77 on @xmath55 and @xmath74 . to simplify notations we suppressed these dependencies in ( [ cfraction ] ) and ( [ rrelations ] ) .",

    "notice that the hole operators do not satisfy the usual fermion anticommutation relations due to the prohibition of the double occupancy of sites by holes .",

    "<S> the energy spectrum of the two - dimensional @xmath0-@xmath1 model in a perpendicular magnetic field is investigated . </S>",
    "<S> the density of states at the fermi level as a function of the inverse magnetic field @xmath2 reveals oscillations in the range of hole concentrations @xmath3 . in the used approximation </S>",
    "<S> zero - field fermi surfaces are large for these @xmath4 , and oscillation frequencies conform with such fermi surfaces . </S>",
    "<S> however , the amplitude of these oscillations is modulated with a frequency which is smaller by an order of magnitude . </S>",
    "<S> the appearance of this modulation is related to van hove singularities in the landau subbands , which traverse the fermi level with changing @xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> the singularities are connected with bending the landau subbands due to strong electron correlations . </S>",
    "<S> the frequency of the modulation is of the same order of magnitude as the quantum oscillation frequency observed in underdoped cuprates . </S>"
