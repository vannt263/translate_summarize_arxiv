    "the _ penrose inequality in minkowski _ refers to a geometric inequality for a class of codimension - two spacelike surfaces @xmath0 embedded in the @xmath2-dimensional minkowski spacetime @xmath3 .",
    "the surfaces are restricted to be closed , connected , orientable and spacetime convex in the sense that their second fundamental form along one of its future directed null normals is non - positive with respect to the outer normal is positive definite . ] .",
    "it follows @xcite that this property can only happen for one such future null direction . indeed ,",
    "if both future null second fundamental forms were non - positive then the mean curvature vector @xmath4 of the surface would be future causal and not - identically vanishing ( because closed codimension - two surfaces in minkowski can not be totally geodesic ) .",
    "thus , @xmath0 would be future trapped and not minimal , which can not occur , e.g. by the results in @xcite .",
    "the ( unique ) future directed null normal for which the second fundamental form is non - positive will be denoted by @xmath5 ( note that this field is defined up to an arbitrary positive scaling ) and referred as the future directed _ inner _ null normal . the future directed _ outer _ null normal @xmath6 is defined by the conditions of being null , orthogonal to @xmath0 , future directed and satisfying @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is the scalar product with the minkowski metric @xmath9 .",
    "then the penrose inequality in minkowski can be written as @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the total area of a the unit @xmath1-sphere , @xmath12 is the induced measure on @xmath0 , @xmath13 its total area and @xmath14 is any choice of future directed unit timelike killing vector in minkowski ( referred from now on as a time translation ) .",
    "note that there is not just one penrose inequality in minkowski , but one for each choice of time translation @xmath14 .",
    "when a distinction is necessary , we will refer to `` the penrose inequality with respect to @xmath14 '' .",
    "the physical motivation for this inequality comes from a construction due to penrose @xcite where an incoming null shell of dust matter propagates in the minkowski spacetime along the null geodesics with tangent vector @xmath5 .",
    "the null hypersurface @xmath15 they sweep is smooth all the way from @xmath0 to past null infinity ( here is where the condition of spacetime convexity becomes important ) .",
    "then , the standard penrose inequality relating total ( bondi ) energy and area of trapped surfaces can be rewritten in terms of minkowskian quantities only .",
    "details on the construction can be found , for instance , in @xcite .    despite its apparent simplicity , inequality ( [ pi ] )",
    "is still a difficult open problem .",
    "it was proved by gibbons @xcite in the case of surfaces lying on the hyperplane orthogonal to @xmath14 , where it becomes precisely the classic minkowski inequality for convex surfaces in euclidean space . for surfaces lying in the past null cone of a point ( denoted as `` spherical case '' ,",
    "although obviously the surface @xmath0 is not in general spherically symmetric ) , the inequality was proved by tod @xcite in spacetime dimension four by using suitable sobolev inequalities and extended to arbitrary spacetime dimension ( bigger than three ) in @xcite as a consequence of the beckner inequality for spheres @xcite .",
    "in fact , the spherical case can also be viewed as a particular case of a penrose inequality for spacetimes admitting shear - free null hypersurfaces extending from the trapped surface to past null infinity proved by sauter @xcite .    in spacetime dimension four",
    ", the inequality ( [ pi ] ) has been established for a large class of surfaces @xcite using a geodesic flow of surfaces along @xmath15 starting on @xmath0 and adapting and extending previous ideas of ludvigsen and vickers @xcite and bergqvist @xcite .",
    "wang @xcite has proved the inequality for surfaces lying on a spacelike hyperboloid of minkowski with the properties of being mean convex and star - shaped with respect to the point of tangency of the hyperboloid with the foliation by constant time hyperplanes orthogonal to @xmath14 . very recently",
    "brendle and wang @xcite have proved the inequality for another large class of surfaces , namely those lying on a timelike cylindrical hypersurface with generator @xmath14 and base a convex surface in a constant time hyperplane orthogonal to @xmath14 .",
    "these cylinders are called _ convex static timelike hypersurfaces _ in @xcite .",
    "in fact , the case analyzed by the authors refers to a generalization of inequality ( [ pi ] ) conjectured for the schwarzschild spacetime , but the argument applies to the minkowski situation .",
    "the main idea behind their result consists in performing a projection of @xmath0 along the time translation @xmath14 onto a constant time hyperplane @xmath16 . by relating the geometry of @xmath0 to the geometry of the projected surface @xmath17 on @xmath16 , inequality ( [ pi ] )",
    "becomes a consequence of the standard minkowski inequality in euclidean space provided @xmath17 is convex .",
    "more precisely , brendle and wang prove the following result ( the result is established in @xcite in spacetime dimension four , but the argument is in fact dimensional independent ) :    [ thwang ] let @xmath18 be the ( n+2)-dimensional minkowski spacetime with @xmath19 a minkowskian time defining a unit killing @xmath20 .",
    "let @xmath0 be a closed , connected , orientable and spacetime convex surface in @xmath18 with contravariant metric @xmath21 .",

    "denote by @xmath25 its volume form and by @xmath26 its second fundamental form as a hypersurface of @xmath27-euclidean space with respect to the outer unit normal .",
    "then the penrose inequality with respect to @xmath14 for @xmath0 is equivalent to @xmath28 and holds if @xmath29 is convex .",
    "the aim of this paper is to analyze this case in further detail by writing out the condition of @xmath17 being convex explicitly in terms of the height function of @xmath0 ( defined below ) and the geometry of the convex surface @xmath30 obtained by intersecting the null hypersurface @xmath15 ruled by the null geodesics starting at on @xmath0 with tangent vector @xmath31 and the hyperplane @xmath16 .",
    "this requires analyzing the geometry of @xmath17 as a graph over @xmath30 .",
    "although a purely euclidean calculation we have not been able to find the result in the literature and most of our work consists in relating the induced metric and second fundamental forms of @xmath17 to those of @xmath30 .",
    "we devote section [ secglobalconstruction ] to present these calculations and the consequences they have on the penrose inequality on convex static timelike hypersurfaces .",
    "our main result is theorem [ t0 ] , where the explicit differential inequality that the height function of @xmath0 needs to satisfy for a surface @xmath0 to lie on a convex static timelike hypersurface is obtained .",
    "our second aim in this paper consists in presenting in a concise and unified manner the geometric relationship between the geometry of the codimension - two surface @xmath0 and its projection @xmath17 , which lies at the core of the argument by brendle and wang .",
    "some of these results have already appeared in several places in the literature , but in a somewhat scattered manner and not in a completely exhaustive form . given the potential usefulness for such `` vertical '' projection in other areas of physics and geometry , we believe it to be convenient to present all the results in a unified and complete manner . we do this for an arbitrary strictly static spacetime in the appendix .",
    "the following conventions and notation are used : if @xmath30 is any embedded spacelike submanifold in a semi - riemannian manifold , we denote by @xmath33 and @xmath34 the induced metric and corresponding covariant derivative .",
    "the second fundamental form and mean curvature vectors are @xmath35 and @xmath36 , where @xmath37 are tangent vector field to @xmath30 and @xmath38 denotes the normal component to @xmath30 . if @xmath39 is a vector field orthogonal to @xmath30 , the extrinsic curvature along @xmath39 is @xmath40 .",

    "choose any @xmath255 and let @xmath256 .",
    "the projection @xmath52 of @xmath30 onto @xmath16 along the orbits of @xmath14 defines a codimension - two surface which again can be taken to be embedded ( after restricting @xmath30 if necessary ) .",
    "thus , we have a diffemorphism @xmath257 defined by projection along @xmath14 . the induced metrics and covariant derivative on @xmath30 ( resp .",
    "@xmath52 ) are denoted as @xmath33 and @xmath34 ( resp . @xmath258 and @xmath259 ) .",
    "the function @xmath260 and @xmath261 will play an important role in relating the geometry of the two surfaces .",
    "as before , scalar functions on @xmath30 will be transferred to @xmath29 by means of @xmath262 while keeping their names .",
    "the precise meaning will follow from the context .",
    "for any vector field @xmath263 we denote its projection @xmath264 as @xmath265 . given any such vector @xmath265",
    "we extend it along the orbits of the killing vector by lie transport along @xmath14 , i.e. solving @xmath266=0 $ ] .",
    "again we keep the same name for the extension .",
    "note that @xmath265 is everywhere orthogonal to @xmath14 . with these definitions",
    "it is straightforward that , at any @xmath267 , @xmath268 as a consequence , the metrics @xmath33 and @xmath258 are related by @xmath269 where we have used @xmath270 and @xmath271 .",
    "so , we conclude @xmath272 the inverse metrics are then related by @xmath273 which has , as immediate consequences , @xmath274 the bound @xmath275 ( necessary for @xmath276 to be real ) is a consequence of @xmath30 being spacelike everywhere .",
    "it is also immediate to show that the respective volume forms @xmath277 and @xmath25 are related by @xmath278    in order to study the relation between the extrinsic geometries of @xmath30 and @xmath52 it is useful to choose a basis of the normal bundle of each surface .",
    "concerning @xmath52 , the natural choice is @xmath279 , where @xmath95 is a unit normal of @xmath52 as a hypersurface in @xmath16 .",
    "we denote by @xmath26 the second fundamental form of @xmath52 along @xmath95 . concerning @xmath30 ,",
    "the lie constant extension @xmath95 along the killing @xmath14 defines a spacelike and unit normal to @xmath30 , still denoted by @xmath95 .",
    "for the second vector , note that @xmath280 is nowhere tangent to @xmath30 and hence its normal component @xmath281 in the orthogonal decomposition @xmath282 is nowhere zero and , in fact , timelike .",
    "from @xmath253 we have , for any @xmath283 , @xmath284 which means that the tangential component of @xmath285 is @xmath286 , or equivalently @xmath287 .",
    "following @xcite we denote by @xmath288 the future directed unit vector tangent to @xmath281 .",
    "its explicit form is @xmath289 as a consequence of @xmath288 being unit and orthogonal to @xmath290 and the property @xmath291 .",
    "we note that @xmath292 defines an orthonormal basis of the normal bundle of @xmath30 .",
    "the extrinsic geometry of @xmath30 is encoded into its second fundamental form vector @xmath161 and the connection of the normal bundle @xmath293 . for the basis above",
    ", this geometric information is in turn given by the two symmetric tensors @xmath294 , @xmath295 and the one - form @xmath296 , @xmath297 . the following proposition relates these objects with the geometry of the projected surface :    [ proj ] with the notation above , @xmath298    inserting ( [ vectrelation ] ) in the defining expression @xmath299 gives , after using @xmath300 , @xmath301 now , @xmath302 , the second equality following from @xmath16 being totally geodesic . to elaborate this further , we note that @xmath303 as a consequence of @xmath253 .",
    "hence @xmath304 where in the first equality we used the killing equations and in the second the orthogonality of @xmath219 and @xmath14 .",
    "raising indices and recalling that @xmath305 = 0 $ ] we conclude @xmath306 and therefore @xmath307    with these expressions at hand , the first term in ( [ inter1 ] ) becomes @xmath308 , while the second term vanishes . finally , the last term gives the second fundamental form of @xmath52 and ( [ kmtensor ] ) follows ( to our knowledge , this identity appeared for the first time in @xcite ) .",
    "concerning @xmath309 , its symmetry properties allows us to write @xmath310 , which after inserting ( [ e4 ] ) yields @xmath311 the killing equations imply that the first two terms cancel each other .",
    "expanding the remaining terms it follows immediately @xmath312 in order to rewrite this in terms of the projected geometry , we need to find the relation between the hessians of @xmath157 on each one of the surfaces .",
    "to that aim , recall that the difference between connections @xmath34 and @xmath259 on a given manifold defines a type @xmath313 tensor @xmath314 such that the following identity holds for any one - form @xmath315 ( see e.g. @xcite ) : @xmath316 in our context , we can use @xmath317 on @xmath30 and the corresponding connection @xmath259 it defines .",
    "given the relation ( [ metrics ] ) , a straightforward computation gives @xmath318 inserting this into ( [ difunoformas ] ) with @xmath319 and using ( [ consecmetricainv ] ) it follows @xmath320 combining this and ( [ ke4geoms ] ) gives ( [ ke4tensor ] ) at once .",
    "it only remains to compute the connection 1-form @xmath321 . substituting ( [ e4 ] ) and recalling that @xmath219 is orthogonal to @xmath288 one finds @xmath322 where in the last equality we used ( [ kmtensor ] ) . replacing ( [ knprimerterm ] ) and using the first relation in ( [ consecmetricainv ] ) and the definition of @xmath276 , then @xmath323 as claimed .",
    "* although we have assumed @xmath14 to be timelike , all the calculations in the appendix are similar when @xmath14 is spacelike and nowhere zero . in particular the geometric relations between @xmath30 and its projection @xmath29 in a purely riemannian context where @xmath324 and @xmath325 are @xmath326 where this time the unit vector @xmath288 reads @xmath327    * remark . * note that the expressions above contain all the information needed to relate any geometric quantity on @xmath30 with geometric information on its projection @xmath52 .",
    "for instance , the mean curvature vector of @xmath30 can be related to the projected geometry simply taking the trace in @xmath328 with the metric @xmath21 and using ( [ metrics ] ) together with the results in proposition [ proj ] .",
    "similarly , the null second fundamental forms @xmath329 , @xmath330 of @xmath30 along a basis of null normals @xmath331 can be obtained directly from proposition [ proj ] after decomposing @xmath153 in the basis @xmath332 .",
    "the same applies to the corresponding null expansions .",
    "concerning the connection one - form , its behaviour under change of basis is not tensorial ( being a connection ) , so it may be worth giving its explicit expression in a null - basis @xmath153 of the form @xmath333 and @xmath334 where @xmath335 is smooth . with the usual definition of connection one - form in this basis given by @xmath336 we have @xmath337 and hence @xmath338",
