    "extensive studies of optically - selected star - forming galaxies seen at the epoch of peak cosmic star - formation density ( @xmath10 ) have revealed star - formation rates ( sfrs ) of 10 - 100m@xmath11yr@xmath4 and stellar masses of @xmath1210@xmath13m@xmath11 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "if these sfrs have been continously maintained , then these galaxies must have undergone their first major epoch of stellar mass assembly 12gyr earlier , at @xmath14 , when the bulk of the star - forming population was @xmath15 less massive @xcite .",
    "the star formation within these galaxies is fuelled by reservoirs of predominantly cold molecular hydrogen , h@xmath16 .",
    "since the h@xmath16 is not directly detectable , co emission at millimetre wavelengths has been employed to trace the cold molecular gas . however , exploring gas properties of galaxies beyond @xmath17 , is challenging ; not only does the apparent surface brightness reduce as @xmath18 , but the galaxies themselves also appear systematically smaller and intrinsically fainter making detections of their molecular gas emission difficult .    to date , studies of molecular line emission at @xmath19 have been limited to extreme populations such as gas - rich quasars ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and submillimetre galaxies ( smgs ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "detecting typical star - forming galaxies at @xmath20 has proven difficult because the co line luminosities are usually below the sensitivity limits of current facilities @xcite .    however , it is still possible to study less active high-@xmath21 galaxies which are strongly gravitationally lensed by massive galaxy clusters .",
    "the magnification provided by gravitational lensing has enabled detections of molecular gas in a number of star - forming galaxies up to @xmath22 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and more recently @xmath23 .",
    "the physical properties of the interstellar medium appear similar to those in local ulirgs , with high gas fractions , high densities and intense uv radiation fields .",
    "@xcite reported the detection of a multiply - imaged @xmath24 galaxy which is gravitationally lensed by the massive galaxy cluster ms1358 + 62 .",
    "correcting for lensing , this galaxy ( hereafter ms1358-arc ) appears to be representative of the star - forming population at this epoch ( its lensing - corrected apparent magnitude is i@xmath25=24.9 , marginally brighter than the characteristic luminosity of i@xmath26 at @xmath27 ; @xcite ) .",
    "* hereafter s09 ) carried out a detailed study of one image of the ms1358-arc system , using optical and infrared imaging combined with integral field spectroscopy , revealing a rotating system across 2kpc in projection , with star formation occuring in five bright clumps .    in this letter , we report observations with the plateau de bure interferometer to search for co(5 - 4 ) emission in ms1358-arc . throughout , we adopt a @xmath28cdm cosmology with @xmath29kms@xmath4mpc@xmath4 , @xmath30 and @xmath31 .",
    "the ms1358 + 62 system is illustrated in figure [ fig : hstimg ] , with the positions of the two images of ms1358-arc marked ( table [ tab : ims ] ) .",
    "we estimate the amplification of each image using the lens model of @xcite with ` lenstool ` @xcite , with errors accounting for the magnification gradient across the image .",
    "the combined magnification factor for image 1 and 2 is @xmath32 .    to search for the co(54 ) emission , we observed ms1358-arc with the iram plateau de bure interferometer , using six antennae in d ( compact ) configuration .",
    "the pointing centre was @xmath33 , and the frequency was tuned to the co(54 ) transition ( rest frame 576.2679ghz ) redshifted to 97.185ghz ( based on the [ oii]-derived systemic redshift of @xmath34 from ) .",
    "the observations were made between 2010 june 4 and 2010 june 6 with total on - source time of 10 hours , using widex with a resolution of 2.5mhz .",
    "the star mwc349 was observed as the primary flux calibrator , with the quasars 1749 + 096 , 0923 + 392 and 2145 + 067 as secondary flux calibrators .",
    "receiver bandpass calibration was performed against 0923 + 392 and 3c454.3 , and 1435 + 638 and 1418 + 546 were used for phase and amplitude calibration .",
    "the data were reduced with the ` gildas ` software package @xcite and resampled to a velocity resolution of 38.6kms@xmath4 .",
    "the synthesised beam is a gaussian ellipse with a fwhm size of @xmath35 at a position angle of @xmath36 .",
    "the pdbi observations were centered on the two brightest images of the @xmath27 galaxy .",
    "the images are both within 6  of the pointing centre , whereas the primary beam of pdbi at 3 mm is 50  ; we have therefore not corrected for primary beam attenuation , which is negligible .",
    "first , we construct a channel map from a 90kms@xmath4 window around the co(54 ) emission line centered at the systemic redshift , and show as an inset in figure [ fig : hstimg ] , with contours at @xmath37 intervals .",
    "the positions of the images within the pdbi cube are determined by aligning the cube with the _ hst _ image and taking the centre of the corresponding pixels .",
    "we also extract spectra from these positions and show these in figure [ fig : specs ] .",
    "individually , the two images are clearly extremely faint ; by comparing the @xmath38 of a gaussian profile to that of a continuum - only fit , measuring the noise over a 1200kms@xmath4 channel , the significances of the co(54 ) emission lines in images 1 and 2 are 3.3@xmath39 and 2.7@xmath39 respectively . however , since they are separated by more than one beam width , we can improve the signal to noise by coadding the spectra at the two positions using uniform weights ( figure [ fig : specs ] ) ; we then obtain a @xmath40 rms channel sensitivity of 0.4mjy per 38.6kms@xmath4 channel . again comparing the @xmath41 of a gaussian profile fit to that of a continuum - only fit",

    ".positions of the three images of ms1358-arc within the plateau de bure field of view and the mean linear magnification factor @xmath42 .",
    "the position of the third image is included for completeness , but is excluded from our analysis as it lies outside the primary beam . [ cols=\"<,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]             whilst the emission line centroid is extremely well - matched to the best - fit redshift of the nebular emission , the line is weak , highlighting the difficulty of these observations even with long integrations .",
    "we perform a number of tests to validate the robustness of the detection .",
    "first , we check how often a detection is made when coadding two random spectra from the original ( non - coadded ) cube .",
    "we generate 1000 combinations of two randomly - selected pixels on the map ( excluding pixels which lie within one beam of ms1358-arc ) , then fit a gaussian profile to the resulting coadded spectrum and compare this to a continuum - only fit .",
    "the probability of finding an emission line of equal significance to the target from two randomly - selected positions with a velocity centroid lying within @xmath43kms@xmath4 of the redshift of ms1358-arc and a line width in the range @xmath44kms@xmath4 is 0.05% .",
    "the co(54 ) emission line we measure is centered at @xmath45 with a line flux of @xmath3jykms@xmath4 and full width at zero intensity of fwzi @xmath46kms@xmath4 , comparable to the velocity gradient measured across the source by .",
    "error bars are obtained by fitting a gaussian profile to the line and perturbing it in intensity , velocity and width to obtain a @xmath47 error surface , using a monte carlo routine with @xmath48 realisations centered on the best fit .",
    "we also construct a coadded channel map from the pdbi cube by extracting regions centered on the two images and co - adding them .",
    "the coadded cube is then spatially convolved with the pdbi beam , and spectrally convolved with a gaussian with fwhm @xmath49kms@xmath4 .",
    "we estimate the noise at each spatial position using the off - line spectrum at that position , and divide the signal in the on - line slice of the convolved datacube by this noise map to construct a signal - to - noise map , shown in figure [ fig : coim ] .",
    "we find that 99.95% of the pixels have lower signal - to - noise than the target .",
    "this is equivalent to a detection significance of @xmath50 .    in the following analysis",
    ", we treat the line flux as @xmath3jykms@xmath4 , but discuss the implications of treating it as an upper limit in section [ sec : conc ] .",

    "we find that just @xmath51 of pixels have higher signal - to - noise than the emission seen from the source , suggesting a 3.5@xmath39 detection.,width=317 ]",
    "using the combined spectrum of images 1 and 2 , we first estimate the line luminosity and gas mass .",
    "following , the line luminosity is @xmath52 . adopting a magnification factor of @xmath32 ,",
    "this indicates an intrinsic @xmath53kkms@xmath4pc@xmath54 .    to convert this co(54 )",
    "luminosity to a total molecular gas mass , we must first estimate the corresponding co(10 ) line luminosity .",
    "we therefore exploit recent observations of @xmath55 galaxies where the ratio @xmath56 has been measured directly , e.g. @xmath57 for smm j2135 @xcite or @xmath58 for a sample of smgs @xcite .",
    "we adopt the latter value and applying it to ms1358-arc , we estimate @xmath59kkms@xmath60pc@xmath54 .",
    "if we instead assumed @xmath61 from either the antannae , 0.2 @xcite ; ngc253 , 0.7 ; or m82 , 0.7 this estimate would vary by a factor of @xmath62 in either direction and so we adopt this as the likely systematic uncertainty in our estimate .    to derive the molecular gas mass @xmath63 from @xmath64 , we assume @xmath65 where @xmath66 is the coefficient relating the co to h@xmath5+he gas mass",
    ". we can derive an absolute lower limit for @xmath66 by assuming that the molecular gas is enriched to solar metallicity and is optically thin to co radiation . from @xcite",
    ", we have @xmath67 , which is consistent with the value @xmath68 applied to local ( ultra ) luminous infrared galaxies .",
    "however , recent studies of high-@xmath21 star - forming galaxies have suggested that @xmath69 may be a more appropriate conversion factor ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "adopting this value , we find @xmath70 , where we conservatively estimate a factor of @xmath62 uncertainty in @xmath66 , comparable to the uncertainty in @xmath71 .    combining our gas mass estimate with the stellar mass @xmath72m@xmath8 derived by , we obtain a total baryonic mass of @xmath73 .",
    "this is consistent with the dynamical mass within 2kpc derived by of @xmath74m@xmath8 , if the inclination is @xmath75 .",
    "the gas fraction @xmath76 is typically @xmath77 in local large spiral galaxies , or @xmath78 in local ulirgs @xcite .",
    "other studies of molecular gas in high - redshift galaxies are beginning to find a trend for higher gas fractions at higher redshifts @xcite , which is in line with expectations from hydrodynamical simulations @xcite .",
    "for ms1358-arc , we find @xmath79 , with a systematic uncertainty of @xmath80 due to @xmath66 and @xmath61 .    in figure [",
    "fig : fgasz ] , we compare the gas fraction of ms1358-arc to samples at lower redshift ( see also * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "the sample size is currently too small to draw any firm conclusions , and there are of course significant selection effects involved .",
    "we therefore caution that there are limits to the extent of any physical interpretation of this result , although it clearly motivates a uniformly - selected survey of the gas properties of high - redshift star - forming galaxies .",
    "we can also use the dynamics of the [ oii ] emission to test whether the molecular gas is colocated with the star formation . in figure",
    "[ fig : specs ] , we overplot the redshifts of the two brightest star - forming knots , which are located at @xmath43kms@xmath4 from the dynamical centre . hence , if the co gas traced the [ oii ] emission we would expect a fwzi of @xmath81kms@xmath4 , higher than the observed line width .",
    "this may indicate that the co emission is associated with the dynamical centre of the galaxy rather than being concentrated in the star - forming regions or associated with the outflowing ly@xmath66 and uv - ism lines .",
    "derived a star formation rate ( sfr ) of @xmath82m@xmath83 using the conversion from [ oii ] luminosity to sfr .",
    "we note that this conversion is consistent with the empirical correction to this calibration of @xcite , which accounts for the metallicity dependence of the [ oii]-derived sfr .",
    "if ms1358-arc has sustained this sfr continuously , then the time taken to build up the current stellar mass of @xmath84m@xmath8 is just @xmath85 ( consistent with the age and star formation history used to derive the stellar mass ) .",
    "this suggests we may be seeing this galaxy in its first epoch of star formation .",
    "if this sfr is maintained at a constant level , the gas supply of @xmath86m@xmath8 will be exhausted in @xmath87myr , which would place the galaxy @xmath88 of the way through its starburst .",
    "the star formation ` lifetime ' of this galaxy would thus be very short compared to that inferred indirectly for the lbg population at @xmath89 , which have implied starburst lifetimes of @xmath90myr @xcite , but is consistent with the lifetime of the starburst - triggered ` lbg phase ' predicted by semi - analytic models @xcite .",
    "finally , we note that the ratio between far - infrared luminosity and molecular gas mass , @xmath91 , gives the star formation efficiency ( sfe ) , relating the ongoing star formation to the available molecular gas .",
    "@xcite obtained an upper limit on the @xmath92 m flux of ms1358-arc of @xmath93mjy which , accounting for the lensing magnification and using the @xmath94 calibration of @xcite , suggests a far - infrared ( fir ) luminosity @xmath95l@xmath8 ( we note that if we assume that the fir flux is re - emitted light from dust - obscured star formation and apply the relation to our [ oii]-derived sfr , we obtain @xmath96l@xmath8 , which is consistent with this upper limit ) .",
    "we thus obtain @xmath97m@xmath98 . for comparison ,",
    "the median @xmath99 in local ulirgs is @xmath100l@xmath8m@xmath98 when corrected to @xmath101 , although this rises to @xmath102m@xmath98 if @xmath103 , which is the factor commonly applied to ulirgs @xcite , while smgs give @xmath104m@xmath98 for @xmath101 @xcite .",
    "our upper limit is consistent with these values .",
    "we have used the iram plateau de bure interferometer to search for the co(54 ) emission in a @xmath105 galaxy lensed by the foreground cluster ms1358 + 62 .",
    "we were able to observe two images of the galaxy simultaneously , with a total magnification factor of @xmath106 .",
    "we measure a line flux of @xmath107jykms@xmath4 at the position of the galaxy , yielding a detection at 3.5 - 4.3@xmath39 .",
    "the molecular gas shows a relatively narrow velocity range around the systemic redshift , unlike the [ oii ] emission , which mainly arises from two clumps in the galaxy at @xmath43kms@xmath4 .",
    "this may suggest that the gas is more centrally concentrated than the star formation .",
    "we derive a total gas mass @xmath108m@xmath8 , suggesting that this galaxy has a gas fraction @xmath109 , with a systematic uncertainty of @xmath80 due to @xmath66 and @xmath71 , which is similar to the most gas - rich galaxies at @xmath10 .",
    "this could imply that gas fractions do not continue to rise significantly beyond @xmath10 , though a larger sample is clearly needed to draw any conclusions .",
    "finally , given the tentative nature of the detection , we consider the implications of treating the measured flux as a 4@xmath39 upper limit . in this case",
    ", the resulting gas mass @xmath110m@xmath8 would be lower than expected given the stellar and dynamical masses derived by , and the gas fraction would be @xmath111 .",
    "this would also imply a gas depletion timescale of @xmath112myr , placing the galaxy more than 40% of the way through a short starburst .",
    "our observations highlight the difficulty of measuring gas properties of ` representative ' star - forming galaxies at @xmath27 , an era when many of today s massive galaxies may be undergoing their first major episode of star formation . probing their basic properties -",
