    "cell movement over solid surfaces plays a key role in many every - day biological processes including embryogenesis , osteogenesis , wound healing , and immune defense @xcite . for example , neutrophils chemotax towards a wound in order to prevent infection  @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "cell motility can play a significant role in disease ; for instance , cancer cells spread out and intrude into healthy tissue by directed , active motion  @xcite . hence , deeper insight into the biochemical and mechanical processes involved in cell crawling would be of great interest and importance .    despite their apparent differences , many eukaryotic cells share essential characteristics of their crawling motion  @xcite . at the macroscopic level ,",
    "cell motion often consists of several distinguishable phases : ( i ) extension of a membrane protrusion ( pseudopod ) at the leading edge , ( ii ) attachment of the pseudopod to the substratum , and ( iii ) detachment and subsequent retraction of the cell rear .",
    "these mechanical changes are mainly driven by polymerizing f - actin ( protrusion ) and myosin motors ( retraction ) @xcite .",
    "both processes are regulated and synchronized in a spatio - temporal manner  @xcite .",
    "additionally , in many higher organisms , detachment is regulated via biochemical changes of focal adhesions @xcite .",
    "in other motile cells , on the other hand , focal adhesions are absent and a similar degradation mechanism has not yet been reported .",
    "much of our understanding of cell motility has come from experiments on the social amoeba _",
    "dictyostelium discoideum _ which has been established as an experimental model system during the past decades  @xcite .",
    "these cells move rapidly ( @xmath0 10 @xmath1m / min ) and can be very sensitive to chemical cues .",
    "also , the availability of a large variety of mutants allows quantitative insight into regulatory as well as mechanical aspects of cell motion .",
    "this paper is devoted to presenting a simple model for _ dictyostelium _ crawling , with specific emphasis on the biomechanics of adhesive contacts between the cells and the substratum .",
    "one motivation for this study relates to recent force cytometry experiments in which the traction forces exerted by motile _",
    "cells chemotaxing on elastic substrata have been measured very precisely @xcite .",
    "the observed stresses range up to @xmath050pa , giving rise to contractile pole forces , defined as the total force exerted in the front and back half of the cell , of @xmath090pn .",
    "typically , the contractile forces are concentrated in spots of @xmath2 m size .",
    "these experiments also reveal a strong correlation between force generation and morphological changes associated with the aforementioned three - stage cycle .",
    "thus , the cell motion exhibits a mechanical cycle consisting of ( i ) a contraction phase , initiated by pseudopod attachment , in which the stresses increase ; ( ii ) a retraction phase , in which the rear detaches and is brought forward .",
    "consequently the cell shrinks and the stresses relax ; ( iii ) a protrusion phase , in which the cell extends a pseudopodium in the direction of motion . at this stage",
    ", the pseudopodium does not exert noticeable forces on the substratum .",
    "the length of such a cycle is in the order of @xmath01 - 2min for wild - type ( wt ) _ dictyostelium _ cells and @xmath04min in cells lacking myosin ii , a motor protein responsible for cytoskeletal force generation @xcite .",
    "the cell displacement of 15@xmath3 m per cycle is roughly constant .",
    "the exact nature of the adhesive forces between _ dictyostelium _ cells and the substratum is not known .",
    "most likely , the observed forces are transmitted through discrete contact foci on the ventral side of the cell .",
    "these foci are associated with f - actin rich regions which appear in spatial and temporal proximity to stress foci @xcite .",
    "actin foci are spatially static but have a lifetime of @xmath020sec .",
    "wild - type ( wt ) cells have @xmath05 - 10 foci . on the other hand , based on experimental results on cell detachment in shear flow",
    ", the number of microscopic adhesive bridges between cell and substratum is estimated to be @xmath010@xmath4 @xcite .",
    "hence each adhesion focus is comprised of many bridges .    it is reasonable to expect that to some extent , the cell speed should be controlled by the strength of attachment and the dynamics of detachment . clearly , neither a non - adherent cell nor a cell that is unable to detach can move .",
    "however , between these extreme cases , the cell speed seems to depend only weakly on its adhesiveness  @xcite . in support of this , weakly adherent talin - null cells move with roughly the same speed as wt cells @xcite .",
    "mutants lacking myosin ii move more slowly than wild - type cells , but cover the same distance per contraction cycle , i.e. , the period of the cycle is increased .",
    "these cells do exhibit a much reduced motility on strongly adhesive substrata  @xcite , as this combination places the cells in the extreme case of not having enough strength to contract against the adhesive forces .",
    "finally , the over - expression of paxillin reduces the adhesion , but leaves the speed during folate chemotaxis relatively unchanged  @xcite .",
    "the importance of attachment / detachment dynamics for cell motility has been addressed in many theoretical studies @xcite .",
    "these typically predict a strong dependence of cell speed on cell - substratum adhesiveness .",
    "indeed , the prediction of an optimal adhesiveness is in excellent agreement with experimental findings on mammalian cells @xcite .",
    "but , as just discussed , the situation appears to be different in _",
    "dictyostelium_.    in these models ,",
    "cell motion follows either from the protruding activity at the front @xcite or from asymmetric detachment during cell contraction @xcite . in the latter models , cell contraction",
    "is represented by internal forces acting on a visco - elastic cell body and the attachment / detachment dynamics are represented by an effective friction term with the substratum @xcite .",
    "however , the experimental observation of discrete binding sites suggest that a representation by discrete , breakable springs as in refs .",
    "@xcite is more appropriate .    in this work",
    "we argue , that contraction takes place at a constant rate and that the cell speed is limited by the rate of detachment of the adhesive bridges .",
    "that is , the rate - limiting step in cell motility in this case is the peeling of the cell from the substratum .",
    "based on stress patterns observed in ref .",
    "@xcite we assume that cell detachment takes place mainly during the contraction phase and that protrusion forces contribute only a small amount to cell detachment .",
    "therefore , our theoretical model of cell motion emphasizes the role of cell detachment during the contraction phase .",
    "our model makes testable predictions about the cell speed under various experimental situations .",
    "these include crawling on substrata with varying adhesiveness and the variation of a number of cell - specific parameters .",
    "our model focuses on the contraction phase of the motility cycle and does not explicitly treat the protrusive forward motion part of the cycle . instead , as is shown schematically in fig .",
    "[ fig : crawling ] , the cell is assumed to maintain protrusive activity throughout the cycle during which cell material is constantly transported to the front .",
    "this notion is corroborated by the observation that over the entire cycle the cell speed shows only little variation ( del lamo , private communication ) .",
    "then , we can define the cell speed as the displacement of the back of the cell at the end of the contraction phase divided by the cycle period .",
    "we assume that during the contraction phase , with duration @xmath5 , myosins contract the cell body uniformly with a constant speed .",
    "this is motivated by ( i ) direct inspection of contracting _ dictyostelium _ cells @xcite and ( ii ) the observation that the _ in vitro _ myosin velocity is load - independent @xcite .",
    "the assumption of a constant contraction rate is an essential difference to earlier work in which the cell is described as a one - dimensional network of contractile elements , each of which is exerting the same force on the nodes of the network @xcite .",
    "our choice is motivated by the fact that force balance implies that , when attached elastically to a substratum , the interior of such networks is largely stress - free .",
    "this is , however , in contrast to experimental observations which show that the stress field extends into the interior of the cell - substratum area , indicating that cells do not operate a contractile network with prescribed forces .",
    "we also assume that the cell contraction is not hindered by viscous stress of the surrounding medium . indeed , as shown in ref .",
    "@xcite , the forces due to fluid drag on the moving cell are much smaller than the experimentally observed forces exerted on the substratum ( @xmath00.1pn vs. @xmath090pn , @xcite ) .",
    "thus , the cell is always in a state of mechanical equilibrium and the motion of the cell is quasi - static .",
    "further , we assume that the cell is attached to the substratum via adhesive bridges .",
    "these bridges form with a fixed on - rate @xmath6 and dissociate with an off - rate @xmath7 which is both force and position dependent .",
    "the force dependence accounts for the fact that the potential barrier between bound and unbound state is lowered by an external force @xcite .",
    "the position dependence incorporates a possible preferred detachment at the rear vs. the front @xcite .",
    "these asymmetric adhesion properties are known to play a major role in mammalian cells , where focal adhesion complexes are coupled to intra - cellular pathways @xcite . to our knowledge , and",
    "contrary to other systems @xcite , such a differential adhesion has not been measured yet in _",
    "dictyostelium_.          in our simulations , the adhesion area",
    "is represented by an ellipse with a fixed number ( @xmath8 ) of randomly distributed sites that can adhere to the substratum .",
    "their position @xmath9 at time @xmath10 is measured with respect to the center of the ellipse .",
    "the amount of contraction is parametrized by the contraction rate @xmath11 which can take on values between 0 and 1 and which is defined as @xmath12 where @xmath13 are the semi - major axes of the ellipse at the onset and end of contraction , respectively .",
    "we divide the contraction cycle into 100 equal timesteps @xmath14 and at each timestep the new position of node @xmath15 is given by @xmath16=(@xmath17 . here , @xmath18 is the location of the cell s center which is allowed to shift in order to ensure a vanishing net force on the cell ( see below ) .",
    "the position dependence of the off - rate is chosen to depend on the component @xmath19 along the direction of motion as follows : @xmath20\\frac{x - x_b}{x_f - x_b}\\ , \\ ] ] where @xmath21 represent the front / back of the cell at the start of the contraction cycle and where @xmath22 are independent parameters of our model .",
    "the probability that a particular site adheres is given by the equilibrium value @xmath23 .",
    "the attachments between cell and substratum are modeled by elastic springs with spring constant @xmath24 . in the case of a very rigid substratum we can ignore the deformations in the substratum . then , the force on a single bond is given by @xmath25 , where @xmath26 is the initial position of the bond . in principle",
    ", our prescribed displacement of the nodes can lead to a non - zero net force on the cell . to ensure a vanishing net force after each iteration we use the fact that the motion is quasi - static and allow the ellipse to shift and rotate . specifically ,",
    "we minimize the total energy of the springs at time @xmath27 , @xmath28 ^ 2\\    \\label{eq : total energy}\\ ] ] where @xmath29 is the matrix describing a rotation by @xmath30 .",
    "an implementation of this minimization procedure revealed that the shift of the cell s center is small ( @xmath31 5% ) compared to the translation of the cell for most of our model parameters and only became significant for small ratios of @xmath32 . to compute the resulting traction stress , @xmath33 , we tile the substratum into 0.05 @xmath34@xmath350.05 @xmath34 squares and compute the total force per area for each tile .",
    "the force dependence of the off - rate is approximated by an exponential factor @xcite , @xmath36 where we have defined the dimensionless parameter @xmath37 .",
    "the molecular length scale @xmath38 characterizes the width of the potential well which prevents the adhesive bridge from breaking and is of the order of 1 nm @xcite .",
    "attachment of bridges to the substratum is assumed to occur with a force - independent rate constant @xmath6 .",
    "binding rates decrease exponentially with the distance between membrane and substratum @xcite .",
    "therefore we assume that attachment occurs only inside the contracted ellipse .",
    "we assume that @xmath6 is uniform across the contact area .",
    "the density of bridges on the membrane is assumed to be constant , such that the total number of available bridges that can attach at time @xmath10 is proportional to the area of the contact area @xmath39 .",
    "the uniform contraction builds up stress and , consequently , a number of foci will detach during the contraction phase . to calculate the speed of the cell we first compute the smallest value of the @xmath19-component for all attached foci , @xmath40 , at the start of the contraction cycle .",
    "this corresponds to the left - most attachment point in fig .",
    "[ fig : crawling]a . at the end of one contraction cycle",
    ", we determine the focus with the smallest value of the @xmath19-component , @xmath41 ( left - most point in fig .",
    "[ fig : crawling]c ) .",
    "then , the speed of the cell is given by @xmath42 .",
    "for each parameter set , we performed 1000 independent contraction cycles and parameter values were chosen such that there is at least 1 remaining attachment point .",
    "traction force experiments that measure the position of fluorescent beads require the use of deformable substrata .",
    "the observed deformations are typically @xmath43 m @xcite , comparable to the typical length of adhesion molecules @xcite . under these conditions ,",
    "the adhesive bridges can not be treated as non - interacting springs .",
    "rather , the elongation of a bridge under a prescribed cell contraction is influenced by the amount of substratum deformation caused by neighboring springs .    to capture this effect , we simulated a deformable substratum with young s modulus @xmath44 as a two - dimensional triangular network of springs with spring constant @xmath45 and rest length @xmath46 . in these simulations , the initial conditions ,",
    "the on and off rates of the cell nodes and the contraction procedure are the same as described above .",
    "now , however , we need to compute the new positions of the triangular mesh vertices after each timestep . for this",

    "[ eq : energy elastic ] directly yields the new positions of the vertices and , thus , the deformation pattern of the substratum .",
    "the force exerted on the attachment point @xmath50 by the cell node @xmath51 can be calculated as @xmath52 .",
    "the total force @xmath53 on each attachment point is then the sum over all nodes @xmath54 connected to this point .",
    "these point forces are related to the local applied stress via @xmath55    note that our choice for the boundary condition will lead to non - zero net forces on the cell .",
    "we found , however , that for a substratum of sufficient size ( 4rx4r ) the net force is less then 5% of the pole force .",
    "of course , by repositioning the cell after each time step we could ensure a vanishing net force even in the case of fixed boundaries .",
    "furthermore , choosing periodic boundary conditions for the substratum will also guarantee a vanishing net force on the cell .",
    "we found that the resulting force pattern differs only slightly from the force pattern generated using fixed boundaries , demonstrating that the results are insensitive to the precise details of the numerical algorithm .      throughout the paper",
    "we will use a default set of parameters that were obtained , where possible , from experimental data .",

    "we have chosen the latter to be @xmath66n / m , which is in the range of experimental values @xcite , and @xmath67 nm @xcite .",

    "in this paper we have presented a mathematical model for cell motility motivated by experimental observations of the motion of _ dictyostelium _ cells .",
    "the emphasis of our model is on the interaction between the cell membrane and the substratum on which the cell is crawling while the actual cell deformation and translation are not explicitly taken into account .",
    "there are several distinct differences between our approach and previous modeling studies . the studies carried out by lauffenburger and co - workers @xcite , for example , considered a one - dimensional cells with only a handful of attachment points .",
    "these points were connected through springs that are exhibiting a prescribed force . in our model ,",
    "on the other hand , the foci are moving with a constant contraction rate .",
    "this choice was motivated in part by the observed stress and force patterns in traction force experiments .",
    "these experiments demonstrate that the forces are maximal within the contact area . in a model where the inter - foci springs exert a fixed force",
    ", the force field within the interior of the contact area will be very small and concentrated at its boundary .",
    "furthermore , experiments on talina- cells @xcite demonstrate that cells with a vastly reduced adhesion move with roughly the same velocity as wild - type cells .",
    "a prescribed force model would predict a strong dependence of the cell s speed on the adhesion strength .",
    "another major difference is the presence of dashpots , representing the viscous nature of the cell s cytoplasm , in the earlier models .",
    "these dashpots play an important role if one prescribes the force exerted by contractile elements . here , however , we prescribe the contraction velocity which alleviates the need for an explicit modeling of the viscous cytoplasm . the estimation of the contraction speed we used in our simulations , @xmath87m / min , is based on direct experimental observations . however , typical _ in vitro _",
    "myosin velocities measured in motility assays are @xmath88 times higher than the experimentally observed cell speeds @xcite .",
    "the _ in vivo _",
    "velocity is not known but will likely be of the order of the contraction speed . the mechanism responsible for this significant slow",
    "down is , to our knowledge , unclear .",
    "one possibility is that _ in vivo _ the disordered structure of the actin - myosin cortex hinders a rapid contraction .",
    "also , the viscosity of the cytoplasm may play an important role in limiting the myosin contraction speed .",
    "a final difference is that our two - dimensional model explicitly takes into account the displacement of the rear .",
    "another class of models describe the cell as a gel , with visco - elastic properties @xcite .",
    "contrary to our model , these studies prescribe the protrusion of the cell and do not focus on the contraction mechanism . in these models ,",
    "the adhesion has a front - to - back gradient and is represented by an effective friction force .",
    "thus , they are unable to address the role of contraction on the detachment of crawling cells .",
    "most of our results are obtained assuming that the substratum is rigid , corresponding to a typical experimental set - up where cells are crawling on glass surfaces . in this case , the displacement of the adhesion proteins is much larger than the displacement of the attachment point at the substratum .",
    "thus , the force field exerted on the substratum is simply determined by the forces on the adhesion proteins . as expected , this average traction force varies during the contraction cycle and reaches its maximum shortly after the start of the cycle ( fig .",
    "[ fig : frames ] ) .",
    "the pattern observed in figs .",
    "[ fig : frames ] and [ fig : comparison ] can be explained by realizing that in our model stress is generated by a prescribed isotropic contraction .",
    "this leads to radial increase of stress at the adhesions which , in the absence of binding / unbinding dynamics , is given by the geometry of the contraction only .",
    "thus , in our model the binding sites at the center of the adhesion zone are always almost stress free , resulting in the observed pattern .",
    "the default set of parameters of our model were based , where possible , on experimental values . to examine the effect of these parameters on the force patterns ,",
    "we have systematically changed one while keeping the remaining parameters fixed ( fig .",
    "[ fig : comparison ] ) .",
    "the stress pattern depends strongly on the molecular length scale @xmath38 with the stress increasing for smaller values of @xmath38 .",
    "this parameter determines the off - rate of the bridges ( eq . [ eq : off_rates ] ) and for small values of @xmath38 , this rate becomes small .",
    "correspondingly , the force per focus becomes large , leading to large stresses shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : comparison ] .",
    "note that the parameter @xmath24 also controls the off - rate . a change in @xmath24 , however , does not change the force pattern as dramatically as a change in @xmath38 since this parameter determines the force per bridge as well .",
    "the relative adhesiveness @xmath32 measures the asymmetry in the adhesion strength between the front and the back of the cell .",
    "such an asymmetry is essential to the motility of mammalian cell but its role in _ dictyostelium _ movement is unclear .",
    "variations in the amount of the relative adhesiveness @xmath32 have only little influence on the magnitude of the observed stress pattern .",
    "the pattern , however , becomes more asymmetric as @xmath32 decreases .",
    "clearly , a larger off - rate at the front than at the back will lead to a higher concentration of attached bridges at the front and thus a larger stress in the front half of the cell .",
    "the parameter @xmath11 describes the amount of contraction . in the absence of detachment",
    ", a larger contraction would lead to an increase in the elongation of the bridges and a larger force per area .",
    "however , the increased force on the foci will lead to an increase in the detachment and , as can be seen from fig .",
    "[ fig : comparison ] , these two effects compensate and lead to a slightly smaller time averaged stress for larger contractions .",
    "the on - rate @xmath6 describes the re - attachments of foci and increasing the value of @xmath6 will result in an increase in the number of attached foci during the contraction cycle .",
    "thus , the force per area increases for increasing values of @xmath6 , as is evident from fig . [ fig : comparison ] .",
    "the off - rate @xmath64 , on the other hand , determines the detachment dynamics of the foci",
    ". a higher value of @xmath64 leads to a smaller number of attached foci and thus a smaller force per area .",
    "the pole forces , defined as the sum of all the forces parallel or anti - parallel to the direction of the motion , increase rapidly and linearly at the start of the contraction cycle ( see fig . [",
    "fig : energy ] ) .",
    "this linear behavior can be understood by realizing that during the initial contraction period , the force dependence of the off - rates is insignificant and the number of bridges stays roughly constant .",
    "since the force on each adhesion is proportional to the contraction ratio , the pole force increases linearly .",
    "once force induced detachment becomes significant the bridges begin to break and the pole force starts to decrease .",
    "the maximum pole force , and the time at which this maximum is reached , depend on the model parameters ( fig .",
    "[ fig : energy ] ) .",
    "in particular , the maximum value increases for smaller values of @xmath64 ( fig . [",
    "fig : energy]a ) .",
    "after all , small values of the off rate lead to larger displacements and , thus , larger forces .",
    "furthermore , the pole force increases for larger values @xmath11 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : energy]b ) which can be understood by realizing that small contractions lead to small displacements and thus smaller pole forces .    using our model",
    ", we are able to vary systemically each parameter and determine the dependence of the speed on this parameter .",
    "the results ( fig .",
    "[ fig : scan ] ) can be viewed as experimental predictions even though we realize it might be difficult to vary some of these parameters in experiments . in particular , it is not always obvious which adhesion parameter is probed in a certain experiment and how the parameters are changed in a certain mutation . for example , the reduced adhesiveness of talina- mutant may result from an increased off - rate or from a smaller total number of adhesive sites .",
    "surprisingly , we find that the speed is only weakly dependent on the relative adhesiveness @xmath32 .",
    "this is in contrast to previous models where the speed depends critically on this ratio .",
    "our model assumes that the protrusion is decoupled from the contraction cycle ( fig .",
    "[ fig : crawling ] ) . thus , our speed is mainly determined by the peeling velocity of the back and can be significant even for uniform off rates .",
    "note that for small relative adhesiveness it becomes important to ensure a vanishing net force through a re - orientation of the cell outline .",
    "without this re - orientation the cell s speed would be purely given by the off - rate at the back and would be constant for all values of the relative adhesiveness .    as expected , we find that the cell speed increases for increasing values of the contraction rate @xmath11 ( fig . [",
    "fig : scan]b ) .",
    "after all , in the limit of vanishing contraction rate the speed approaches zero while for maximal contraction rate the speed reaches a maximum .",
    "furthermore , we find that high on - rates decrease the speed ( fig . [",
    "fig : scan]c ) . for high values of @xmath6 ,",
    "adhesive bridges are deposited at rates that are higher than the detachment rates , limiting the cell s speed .",
    "contrary to previous studies , we find that the speed does not depend strongly on the off - rate @xmath64 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : scan]d ) . of course",
    ", the speed will approach 0 for very small values of this off - rate where the foci will remain attached to the substratum . in this limit",
    ", we expect that our constant contraction speed assumption is no longer valid and that the forces on the myosin motors are large enough to lead to stalling . for large values of the off - rate ,",
    "all foci will detach and we have only considered the range of values for which at least one focus remains attached . in fact , in this limit the weakly adherent cells can exert only small forces on the substratum , see fig . [",
    "fig : scan_koff_frc ] .",
    "hence , for sufficiently large @xmath64 , the traction force that balances the viscous drag of the protruding cell ( @xmath89pn @xcite ) exceeds the detachment force . for approximately symmetric cells ,",
    "force balance then implies that a forward protrusion is accompanied by a backward motion of the same order .",
    "hence , there is no net motion for sufficiently large @xmath64 . for",
    "the parameter range studied , the traction force is always sufficient to support protrusive forward motion , see fig .",
    "[ fig : scan_koff_frc ] .",
    "our finding that the cell speed is roughly constant for a large range of values of adhesive forces is in agreement with recent experiments in which the stress patterns of crawling _ dictyostelium _ cells were examined .",
    "these experiments show that the cell motion can be described by a contraction - relaxation - protrusion cycle .",
    "thus , the cell s speed is determined by the ratio of the displacement per cycle and the period of this cycle .",
    "talina- cells exhibit a drastically reduced cell - substratum adhesion but were found to have the same cell speed as wild - type cells , with an identical period and , thus , identical displacement .",
    "of course , two data points can not rule out a significant dependence of the cell speed on the adhesion strength and a definitive test of our model would be to examine the cell speed for different mutants .",
    "one candidate would be cells in which the expression level of paxb , the _ dictyostelium _ orthologue of paxillin , is altered . both paxb- cells @xcite and cells in which paxb is overexpressed @xcite exhibit a decrease in cell - substratum adhesion .",
    "the cell speed in camp gradients is reduced in paxb overexpressed cells and is increased in paxb- cells .",
    "interestingly , the cell speed in folate gradients is largely independent of the expression level of paxb ( @xcite and d. brazill , personal communication ) .",
    "this might indicate a paxb role in the periodicity of the motion cycle , which would effect the cell s speed .",
    "a more detailed analysis of these mutants that can measure force patterns and motility cycles would be interesting .",
    "a quantitative comparison with the experimentally obtained stress patterns is only possible if we take into account a deformable substratum .",
    "after all , these experiments measure the displacement of fluorescent beads embedded in the substratum and require significant movement of these beads .",
    "thus , our model assumption that the displacement of the substratum is negligible compared to the stretching of the adhesive bonds is no longer valid . to compare to experiments ,",
    "we have extended our model and have explicitly simulated a triangular spring network , representing the substratum .",
    "this extension renders the simulations computationally more demanding and we have only performed a limited set of simulations ( fig .",
    "[ fig : displacements ] ) . using experimental values characterizing the substratum",
    ", we found that our results show a quantitative and qualitative agreement with the experimentally observed stress and strain patterns .",
    "for our experimentally based parameter values we obtained a maximum displacement that was comparable to the one observed in experiments ( @xmath90 m ) .",
    "furthermore , the computed peak stress is similar to the experimental peak stress : @xmath9140 pa vs. @xmath9150 pa .    in summary",
    ", we have presented a simple model for the motion of _ dictyostelium _ cells .",
    "we have shown that this model can produce a number of experimentally verifiable predictions and can be extended to include deformable substrata .",
    "our strongest prediction , that the cell speed is largely independent of the value of the adhesive forces , should be testable using force cytometry experiments .",
    "our model focused on the cell - substratum interaction and ignored the protrusion phase of the motility cycle .",
    "extensions that include intra - cellular signaling pathways that drive cell deformations are currently under investigation .",
