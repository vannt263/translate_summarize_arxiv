    "in 1984 bennett and brassard @xcite proposed the first quantum key distribution ( qkd ) protocol , which was named bb84 later and on which most the present - day practical realizations of qkd are based @xcite . in 1991",
    "eckert proposed a qkd protocol of another type ( based on quantum entanglement ) @xcite which is called e91 .",
    "there are also practical realizations of this type of protocols @xcite .",
    "recently the first commercial qkd systems @xcite became available on the market .",
    "some commercial , military and security institutions are interested in this new technology . in this connection ,",
    "the questions about the concept of the security of qkd protocols and keys generated by them are crucial .",
    "as with any product the problem of elaborating on some standards and specifications of qkd systems arises : what kind of characteristics a producer have to include in the specification .",
    "the necessity of the elaboration of some standards for the widespread deployment of quantum cryptography has been already pointed out in @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we propose and discuss a list of characteristics for the specification , which includes a numerical evaluation of the security of solution and can be considered as a standard for quantum key distribution solutions .",
    "the list is based on the average time of key generation depending on some parameters .    in the simplest case for the user the list includes three characteristics : the security degree @xmath0 , the length of keys @xmath1 and the key refresh rate @xmath2 .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "we remind some features of qkd .",
    "we give the comparison of the computational and information - theoretic ( unconditional ) approaches to cryptography , the notions of qkd protocol and keys security , a classification of adversary s attacks and some specific features of qkd . in section 3",
    "we discuss the problem of specification of qkd systems and propose a list of characteristics of these systems , which can be taken as a standard and which a producer has to indicate in the specification .    for a review on quantum cryptography",
    "see , e.g. , @xcite .",
    "in this section we discuss various properties of qkd which are relevant to specifications .",
    "two approaches are distinguished in cryptography depending on the nature of the assumptions about the adversary @xcite .    *",
    "_ computational approach _ is proposed in @xcite and based on the complexity of solving of some computational problems ( such that , for example , factorization of the whole numbers or discrete taking the logarithm ) and on the assumption that the adversary s computational power is bounded . however , as the adversary with the unbounded computational power can solve any such problem as quickly as he wish and , hence , break the cryptographic system , computational security is always conditional .",
    "the risk that the security of a system in computational sense will be broken exists always because of the progress in the computer engineering ( for example , in the engineering of quantum computers ) .",
    "* _ information - theoretic approach _ originates in @xcite and is based on the assumption that the information of the adversary is bounded . in quantum cryptography",
    "the adversary s information is bounded due to the uncertainty relations in quantum world . as there are no assumptions on the adversary s computational power ,",
    "information - theoretic security is called _ unconditional _ and is more desirable .",
    "theoretically , the adversary has no way to break an unconditionally - secure cryptographic system , even using infinite computing power .",
    "most the present - day cryptographic protocols ( for example , rsa ) are based on the computational approach , namely , on the lack of effective algorithms for solution of np - problems at present . besides the weaknesses of the computational approach pointed out above , the fact that impossibility of the effective solving the np - problems is nt proved",
    "is considered to be one more weakness of the present - day cryptosystems .",
    "if effective algorithms for solving np - problems are found , most of the present - day cryptosystems will lose their security .",
    "the problem of key distribution is an important problem in cryptography .",
    "two legal parties , alice and bob , want to get a pair of keys ( one key for alice and another one for bob ) using communication channels .",
    "a realization of a certain random variable on a finite set @xmath3 , or this random variable itself is regarded as a key .",
    "a pair of keys is called _ perfectly secure _ if    1 .",
    "they are uniformly distributed , 2 .",
    "they are identical , and 3 .",
    "a potential adversary ( eve ) has no information about them .",
    "accordingly , the adversary eve aims , firstly , to get as much information about the keys as possible and , secondly , to make the alice s and bob s keys different .",
    "it is necessary to evaluate the security of the pair of keys .",
    "it is natural to define the insecurity of the pair of keys as the distance from the ideal pair of keys which is perfectly secure @xcite .",
    "since the definition must be applicable to quantum cryptography , it must be given in terms of quantum states .",
    "classical state ( probability distribution ) is a particular case of quantum state .",
    "let @xmath4 be a joint distribution of alice s key @xmath5 and bob s key @xmath6 .",
    "let @xmath7 be a quantum state which includes both the keys @xmath5 and @xmath6 , and eve s ( in general , quantum ) information about these keys .",
    "let @xmath8 be the state which corresponds to the ideal pair of keys . then , the pair of keys @xmath9 is called @xmath0-_secure _ where @xmath10 $ ] , if @xmath11 the number @xmath0 we will call the _ security degree _ of the pair of keys . here @xmath12 $ ] is the distance measure between two quantum states .",
    "so , a pair of keys is as secure as @xmath0 is closer to 1 .",
    "a 1-secure pair of keys is perfectly secure .",
    "note that this security is information - theoretic ( unconditional ) , because there are nt any assumptions about eve s computational power .",
    "see appendix for the formal definition of the security degree of a pair of keys .",
    "here we give some important properties of this definition .    *",
    "this definition of security is _",
    "universally composable _ in sense of , which is important for the modern cryptographic protocols . *",
    "if the pair of keys is @xmath0-secure , then the probability @xmath13 that the adversary guesses the keys ( _ success probability _ ) is bounded by ( see @xcite and @xcite ) + @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the number of elements in the set of keys @xmath16 . for example , the success probability of the @xmath0-secure @xmath17-bit pair of keys is bounded by @xmath18 .",
    "if the pair of keys is perfectly secure , then the success probability is @xmath19 , i.e. , the adversary has no information and can only perform the completely random guessing from @xmath15 elements .",
    "* the fact that the pair of keys is @xmath0-secure can be interpreted as that the pair is perfectly secure with the probability @xmath0 .",
    "+ so , this definition is both useful , because it is universally composable , and obvious , because it is related to the adversary s success probability and the probability that the pair is perfectly secure .",
    "* if the pair of keys @xmath20 which is get by concatenation of two pairs @xmath21 and @xmath22 is @xmath0-secure , then both the pairs @xmath21 and @xmath22 are also @xmath0-secure .",
    "the same is hold for the concatenation of arbitrary number of pairs of keys .",
    "so , we can divide pairs of keys into shorter pairs of keys with the same degree of security .",
    "a practical quantum cryptography system with two legal parties ( alice and bob ) is a pair of hardware devices ( alice s hardware device and bob s one ) .",
    "these devices are connected with each other by a quantum channel ( mostly by optical fiber ) and a classical channel ( e.g. , ethernet or optical fiber ) , and each of the devices is attached to the corresponding ( alice s or bob s ) computer .",
    "it is clear that for operation of these devices the software is necessary .",
    "so , in the most general case a quantum cryptography protocol ( with two legal parties ) is a pair of programs ( algorithms ) for a pair of computers which interact with each other by quantum and classical channels using special hardware devices . besides the commands of a usual programming language",
    ", these programs must contain the additional commands for the hardware devices ( lasers , detectors etc . ) management .",
    "key distribution is one of the problems which can be solved by quantum cryptography . in qkd , in contrast to other applications of quantum cryptography , besides the legal parties there is also the adversary eve .",
    "she also has a computer with an attached hardware device which allows eve to eavesdrop the channels and to change the messages transmitting through them .",
    "so , in essence , the adversary s attack is a program for her computer with a special hardware . for a more formal discussion",
    "see , e.g. , @xcite .",
    "the qkd protocols usually include the following steps .    1 .",
    "photons transmission .",
    "alice transmits to bob a certain number of photons through the quantum channel in the states that she chooses from a certain set .",
    "her choices are unknown to eve .",
    "eve can perform different operations on the transmitted photons .",
    "bob measures these photons in the bases that he also chooses from a certain set .",
    "his choices are also unknown to eve .",
    "2 .   test .",
    "alice and bob estimate a certain measure of eve s interference by analysing the data transmitted and received through the quantum channel and communicating through the classical ( public ) channel . for bb84-type protocols the _ quantum bit error rate _ ( _ qber _ ) plays the role of the measure of eve s interference .",
    "in e91-type protocols the level of violation of bell s inequality plays the role of this measure . using the estimated value of this measure they estimate eve s information about the data .",
    "if the estimation of eve s information exceeds a certain bound , then alice and bob go to step 3 .",
    "if not , they go to step 4 .",
    "this analysis is based on the property of quantum world : the measurement of the quantum system changes the state of this system , so it is impossible for eve to get information by measuring the transmitted photons without introducing the noise in them .",
    "decision about the further course of the protocol .",
    "the negative result on step 2 may be caused by both eve s influence and statistical fluctuations .",
    "alice and bob may end the execution of the protocol , or return to step 1 and run the cycle once again .",
    "classical postprocessing of the quantum data .",
    "alice and bob perform the certain classical procedures by communicating through the classical ( public ) channel which allow them to correct errors , to reduce eve s information and so , to get a pair of keys with the desirable security degree . + on steps 2  4 eve taps the classical channel and , may be ( see the next subsection ) , actively intercept the classical communication of alice and bob .    in this way",
    ", one gets the quantum state @xmath7 which includes the alice s and bob s keys @xmath5 and @xmath6 , and eve s information about them , see the previous subsection .    in some cases , steps 3 and 4 can be omitted .",
    "for example , in @xcite another approach to quantum cryptography is proposed .",
    "but there is also the same sequence : photon transmission , then test .",
    "note the following features of qkd protocols :    * probability that eve guess all alice s and bob s choices during the photon transmission step is negligibly small , but not zero . in this case",
    ", eve will have full information about the keys . on the other hand ,",
    "privacy amplification procedure on step 4 can reduce eve s information to arbitrary small amount , but not to zero .",
    "so , a pair of keys generated by qkd system ca nt be perfectly secure .",
    "* it is possible that either alice or bob , or both of them retract the key distribution ( see step 3 ) .",
    "this is possible even in case of no eavesdropping , but noisy quantum channel : if there are too many errors due to the natural noise in the quantum channel ( this can happen with some nonzero probability ) , alice and bob could think that there is an eavesdropper and retract the key distribution . in order to reduce this probability ( i.e. , to reduce the statistical fluctuations )",
    ", alice have to send more photons to bob , which has an effect on the time of key generation ( see subsection [ secfcharactqkd ] ) .",
    "when we speak about the security degree of the pair of keys which is generated by the key distribution protocol , we must point out the class of adversary s attacks relative to which the pair of keys has the declared security degree .",
    "we consider the following classification .    1 .   by the degree of mastering of quantum technologies by the adversary .",
    "_ incomplete mastering of quantum technologies_. besides the laws of quantum mechanics , there are other restrictions on the adversary s operations on the photons transmitted through the quantum channel .",
    "for example , the adversary can perform only individual attacks , or the adversary ca nt perform the beam - splitting attack @xcite .",
    "complete mastering of quantum technologies_. during the photons transmission the adversary can perform with these photons any operations that are allowed by quantum mechanics .",
    "2 .   by the authenticity of the classical channel . 1 .",
    "_ authentic classical channel_. the adversary can freely tap the classical channel , but ca nt change and interrupt the messages sent by the legal parties , and send other messages .",
    "so , the adversary has read access , but hasnt write access to the classical channel . in case",
    "this assumption , the authenticity of the channel must be provided by technology .",
    "_ unauthentic classical channel_. the adversary can not only freely tap the classical channel , but also change and interrupt the messages sent by the legal parties , and send her messages to alice and bob .",
    "so , the adversary has read and write access to the classical channel .",
    "in this case , the authenticity of the channel in the protocol must be provided by mathematics .",
    "+ generally speaking , it is more preferable , if the classical channel is nt assumed to be authentic , but the technological methods of providing with the authenticity can be in more effective some cases from the viewpoint of other parameters of the qkd system ( e.g. , one can avoid the key degradation problem  see subsections [ seckeydegrad ] , [ secfcharactqkd ] and [ secncharactqkd ] ) .",
    "3 .   by the adversary s computing power . 1 .",
    "_ adversary has limited computing power_. 2 .   _ adversary has unlimited computing power_. + we should make a remark about the limitation of the computing power .",
    "assumption about the adversary s computing power can be applied for using the public - key methods ( e.g. , digital signatures ) as a mathematical method of authentication of the classical channel . in this case , the security of the pair of keys generated by the protocol , generally speaking , is nt unconditional .",
    "but there is an advantage over the public - key cryptosystems , which is noticed in @xcite . in public - key cryptosystems , even if the adversary hasnt unlimited computing power now , in future , when unlimited computing power probably will be available , she can calculate the secret key using the public key and so , break the cryptosystem . in case of the use of public - key methods for authentication in the qkd protocol , if the adversary hasnt enough computing power now , it is useless to have unlimited computing power later .",
    "so , one can say that , in general , such a pair of keys is unconditionally - secure against future attacks .",
    "accordingly , the most general class of attacks is the case when the adversary has complete mastering of quantum technologies and unlimited computing power , and the classical channel is unauthentic .",
    "this classification is rather rough , more precise classifications , e.g. , specifications of adversary s mastering of quantum technologies ( if it is incomplete ) and computing power ( if it is limited ) , are possible .",
    "the intermediate authenticity degrees of the classical channel , e.g. , the case when the adversary can send her messages , but ca nt change and interrupt other messages ( it is realistic in radio communication ) , are also possible .",
    "one more significant problem in quantum cryptography is the key degradation problem , which is considered in @xcite .    in case of unauthentic classical channel and unlimited eve s computing power ,",
    "alice and bob have to use the unconditional message authentication codes ( mac ) , and for that they have to have a common key , or , as shown in @xcite , at least correlated random variables about which eve hasnt complete information .",
    "a portion of each of the generated keys must be kept for the next session , where it will be used as the initial key ( for authentication ) .",
    "however , the obtained pair of keys is not perfectly secure .",
    "so , with every run of the qkd protocol alice and bob obtain less and less secure keys .    hence , after a number of runs of qkd protocol alice and bob need to obtain a new pair of keys not by qkd protocol",
    ". we will call these keys and source that generates them and deliver to alice and bob _",
    "external_. so , in this case , alice and bob need to have an external source of keys .",
    "if the classical channel is authentic , then it s not necessary to have an external pair of keys . if the channel is unauthentic , but the eve s computing power is limited , then alice and bob can use public - key methods for authentication , e.g. , digital signatures . in this case , they need to have an external initial key only at the beginning for the announcement of the first public key .",
    "then a portions of public and secret keys is used for the authentication of the current message , and another portion  for the authentication of the announcement of the next public key . in this case",
    "we have no problem of key degradation .",
    "the initial pair of keys can be used not only for the authentication @xcite .",
    "at present first commercial qkd systems come into the market @xcite .",
    "they provide specifications which include physical , environmental an some other characteristics of the qkd systems .",
    "note that for the commercial qkd systems the length of keys @xmath1 and the key refresh rate @xmath2 are indicated ( @xmath23 bits , @xmath24 times / second ) @xcite . in specifications and descriptions of these systems",
    "some important from practical point of view information is lacking .",
    "one asks the following questions :    1 .",
    "how secure can be pair of keys that the user obtain using these systems ? 2 .   against which class of attacks",
    "are these systems secure ?",
    "3 .   is the key degradation problem taken into account ?    concerning the security it is claimed that the keys generated by the commercial qkd systems are absolutely secure .",
    "it is not clear what does it mean .",
    "as we have said above , the security degree @xmath0 of the pair of keys generated by the qkd protocol ca nt be equal to 1 , i.e. , the pair of keys ca nt be perfectly secure in this sense .",
    "we suggest that such important characteristic as the security degree of the pair of keys should be indicated in the specification .",
    "these questions are important since one of the declared advantages of quantum cryptography over the conventional one is the availability of rigorous proofs and estimations ( see also discussion in @xcite ) .",
    "so , the lack of the rigorous numerical estimations of the security is a retreat from the original idea of quantum cryptography .",
    "certainly , any security estimation is relative : the adversary can perform an attack which is not concerned directly with the operations on the transmitted photons , i.e. , which is nt taken into account by the mathematical formalism ( the examples of such attacks see , e.g. , in @xcite )",
    ". however , the rigorous numerical security estimations in assumption that adversary s operations satisfy the declared class of attacks , in our opinion , are necessary . the estimation of the real security can be obtained only when numerous various attacks on the practical qkd systems are carried out .",
    "so , we need an army of `` quantum hackers '' ( see @xcite ) .    besides , the following general principle of cryptography is known @xcite : any statement about the security of a cryptographic scheme demand the precise specification of values of all of its parameters , and often even a small deviation from the established values completely destroys the security of the system .",
    "in subsection [ secwhatisqkdprotocol ] it was said about the measure of eve s interference ( qber for bb84-type protocols and the level of violation of bell s inequality for e91-type protocols ) .",
    "this measure is denoted by @xmath25 .    in @xcite",
    "the notion of secrecy capacity of the classical broadcast channel was introduced .",
    "this is an analogue of shannon s channel capacity for the case of the presence of an eavesdropper : besides the required transmission rate it is demanded in the definition of secrecy capacity that the eavesdropper has a negligibly small information . in @xcite",
    "these ideas were extended for the case when in addition to the broadcast channel alice and bob can communicate also through the public channel .",
    "the notion of secret key rate was introduced there .    a quantum channel with classical input ( alice s coding of classical bits into the quantum states ) and classical output ( bob s and eve s measurements ) can be considered as a classical broadcast channel .",
    "so , in quantum cryptography we can also use the notion of secret key rate .",
    "but , in contrast to the classical models , in the quantum case the secret key rate @xmath26 depends on eve s activity .",
    "alice and bob can estimate it by estimating the measure of eve s interference @xmath25 , i.e. , @xmath27 .    and",
    "there is a maximal value @xmath28 such that @xmath29 , if @xmath30 , and @xmath31 , if @xmath32 .",
    "for example , the maximal qber for the bb84 protocol is known to be 11% @xcite .",
    "this value @xmath28 is often used to characterize and compare different qkd protocols .",
    "larger value of @xmath28 for a protocol means that this protocol is more robust against the natural noise ( i.e. , the noise when there is no eavesdropping ) in the quantum channel .",
    "if @xmath28 is such that due to the natural noise the value of @xmath25 estimated by alice and bob is more than @xmath28 with high probability , then this protocol can not operate , since alice and bob would think that due to the eavesdropping they can not generate a secret key , whereas there is no eavesdropping .    of course",
    ", @xmath28 is an important characteristic of a qkd protocol , but , in our opinion , it has the following drawbacks for the specification of qkd systems :    * secret key rate , as well as secrecy capacity and usually shannon s channel capacity , is an asymptotic characteristic : it guarantees that it is possible to get a pair of keys with security degree arbitrarily close to one _ only for sufficiently large number of transmitted photons_. but alice and bob have only finite number of transmitted photons on the step of test ( see subsection [ secwhatisqkdprotocol ] ) .",
    "if they determine that this number is not enough to achieve the desired security degree with the given secret key rate , alice can transmit more photons to bob .",
    "but eve can change her strategy of interception of the quantum channel and , hence , change the value of secret key rate during this second transmission .",
    "so , the satisfaction of the condition @xmath32 does not mean that the distribution of the pair of keys with the desired security degree is possible ; * @xmath28 is not a universal characteristic of qkd protocol , since the different measures of eve s interference are used in the different protocols ; * @xmath28 is a rather internal characteristic of qkd protocol .",
    "it is of the interest of the engineer who develops the qkd solution , but not of the engineer who develops further applications using the qkd solution or of the end - user .",
    "@xmath28 is not a measure of robustness of the protocol against eve s attacks : if eve wants to break the communication between alice and bob , she can always do it by making @xmath25 greater than @xmath28 .",
    "@xmath28 is only a measure of robustness of the protocol against the natural noise .",
    "but then we can use the probability @xmath33\\ ] ] instead of @xmath28 .",
    "@xmath34 is the probability that both alice and bob do not retract the key distribution in case of no eavesdropping .",
    "this parameter is both universal and suitable for users .",
    "we will call @xmath34 the _ success probability in case of no eavesdropping_.    in fact , @xmath34 depends on the number @xmath17 of transmitted photons : alice can send more photons in order to decrease the statistical fluctuations and hence to increase @xmath34 .",
    "but we do not write this dependence ( like @xmath35 ) , because we consider @xmath34 as an external parameter , which is set by the user ( or it may be fixed ",
    "see subsection [ secfcharactqkd ] ) , and number of photons @xmath17 as an internal parameter of the current operating of the qkd system , which is not of the interest of the user .",
    "so , the number of photons @xmath17 depends on @xmath34 . and",
    "the computer program of qkd system determine the required number of photons @xmath36 for the given @xmath34 .",
    "we propose to use the following three characteristics for the specification of qkd parameters of the system in the simplest case :    * security degree @xmath0 , * length of keys @xmath1 , and * key refresh rate @xmath2 .",
    "here it is assumed that the security degree and the length of keys in the qkd system are fixed and in this sense this is the simplest case .",
    "if the user can vary @xmath0 and @xmath1 , then @xmath37 is a function depending on these parameters . a pair of keys which is longer or more secure requires more time for its generation , i.e. , the smaller key refresh rate .    but @xmath0 and @xmath1 are fixed for an individual launch of the qkd system .",
    "so , in all cases these parameters characterise the individual launch of the qkd system .",
    "here it is also assumed that there is no key degradation problem here , i.e. , the users do nt have to have external keys .      in this subsection",
    "we introduce functional characteristics of the qkd systems suitable for detailed specifications .      for the functional description of qkd system we propose to use the average time of key generation @xmath38 , if the qkd parameters ( security degree , length of keys etc .",
    ") are fixed .",
    "the average time @xmath38 describes the quality of the qkd system .",
    "higher security requires the longer time of key generation .",
    "note that the time @xmath38 includes the times required for both photons transmission and classical computations .",
    "that s why we use the time instead of the number of photons for the description .",
    "we suppose that the time depends on the following parameters :    1 .",
    "the desirable length of keys @xmath1 2 .",
    "the desirable security degree of keys @xmath0 , @xmath39 3 .",
    "the desirable success probability in case of no eavesdropping ( see subsections [ secwhatisqkdprotocol ] and [ secmaxmeve ] ) @xmath34 , @xmath40 4 .   the length of the initial pair of keys @xmath41 , @xmath42 5 .",
    "the security degree of the initial pair of keys .",
    "@xmath43 , @xmath44 .",
    "so , the average time @xmath38 is a function @xmath45 .",
    "the average time @xmath38 increases as @xmath1 , @xmath0 or @xmath34 increase , or @xmath41 or @xmath43 decrease .",
    "@xmath46 is interpreted as an impossibility of key generation with the given parameters .",
    "here it is assumed that the distance of the qkd system functioning is fixed .",
    "the average time @xmath38 describes the qkd system in details , but it depends on too many arguments .",
    "it is necessary to introduce functions which describes the qkd system not so detailed , but have less parameters .",
    "one of these characteristics is the _ key generation rate_. in order to define the key generation rate properly we must analyse what information is needed for user .    in the following we fix @xmath34 ,",
    "say , @xmath47 , and do not consider the dependence of the functional characteristics below on @xmath34 .",
    "furthermore , for simplicity we at first consider the case when @xmath48 ( no key degradation ) .",
    "so , the average time @xmath38 depends only on two arguments : the desirable length of keys @xmath1 and the desirable security degree of the pair of keys @xmath0 .",
    "we will write @xmath49 .",
    "the user is interested in the pair of values @xmath50 , i.e. , he want to generate a pair of keys ( only once or continuously ) with the length @xmath1 bits and the security degree @xmath0 . and he want to know the time @xmath49 ( is measured , e.g. , in seconds ) during which he can generate it . or , equivalently , he want to know the _ key refresh rate _ @xmath51 ( is measured in times / second ) , which is more common in specifications of key distribution systems",
    ". we must give the definition of the key generation rate so that the user knowing the key generation rate and the desirable parameters @xmath50 could find ( may be approximately ) the key refresh rate .",
    "it is natural to define the key generation rate as @xmath52 ( is measured in bits / second ) .",
    "but we want to eliminate the length @xmath1 from the arguments of the key generation rate , because it is natural to define the key generation rate which depends on the security degree , but does not dependent on the length .",
    "we define the key generation rate as @xmath53 ( it is assumed that the limit , may be infinite , exists ) .",
    "explain the introduced definition .",
    "let @xmath50 is the desired pair of parameters .",
    "@xmath54 where @xmath55 is a large number .",
    "let @xmath56 where @xmath17 is some natural number .",
    "we divide the pair of keys with the length @xmath55 into @xmath17 pairs of keys with the length @xmath1 .",
    "the security of each of these shorter pairs is also @xmath0 ( see the properties of the security degree at the end of subsection [ seckeyssecur ] ) .",
    "so , @xmath17 pairs of keys with the length @xmath1 and the security degree @xmath0 are generated during the time @xmath57 .",
    "the key refresh rate is @xmath58 .",
    "thus , the user knowing @xmath50 and @xmath59 can calculate the key refresh rate by the formula    @xmath60    it is possible that in concrete qkd systems there are faster ways for generating keys with the parameters @xmath50 than generating much longer keys with the same security degree .",
    "but the value @xmath61 gives the guaranteed key refresh rate .",
    "if @xmath62 , then arbitrarily large key refresh rates are achievable by the proper ( large enough ) choice of @xmath55 .    now consider the general case where @xmath45 ( @xmath34 is fixed as before ) .",
    "now alice and bob must have an external pair of keys in order to generate a pair of longer keys .",
    "so , the key refresh rate @xmath63 has an additional parameter : the length of initial ( external ) keys @xmath41 , i.e. , the length of the perfectly secure keys that alice and bob must have before the qkd session in order to generate the keys with the length @xmath1 and the security degree @xmath0 .",
    "smaller @xmath41 is more desirable , but it can decrease the key generation rate .",
    "for example , some security degrees becomes unavailable ( i.e. , the key refresh rate falls to zero ) when the length of the external pair of keys becomes too small . or more rounds in the authentication protocol @xcite , which require additional time , are needed in order to generate keys with the same security degree , but having the external pair of keys with a shorter length .",
    "so , @xmath64 times / second means that alice and bob using the qkd system can refresh @xmath65 times per second their keys with the length @xmath1 and security degree @xmath0 , and before each refreshing they must have for that at the average @xmath41 bits of the perfectly secure external keys ( if the external keys are not perfectly secure , then they must be longer than @xmath41 ) .",
    "now in order to define the key generation rate we should take @xmath66 and @xmath67 so that @xmath68 .",
    "the amount @xmath69 we will call _ external key consumption rate_. thus , in this case the key generation rate depends on two parameters : the security degree @xmath0 and the external key consumption rate @xmath69 . since @xmath70 , where @xmath71 denotes the floor of the real number @xmath72 , i.e. , the nearest to @xmath72 integer from below , we define the key generation rate as    @xmath73    knowing @xmath1 , @xmath41 and @xmath74 one can calculate @xmath75 by the formula    @xmath76    of course , it makes no sense to decrease the security degree to @xmath77 , or to increase the external key consumption rate to @xmath78 or greater ( in the first case the optimal way for alice and bob is to generate two keys independently , in the latter case the optimal way is to use the external pair of keys for the direct purpose instead of generation a pair with a shorter length ) .",
    "so , the domain of the function @xmath79 is @xmath80 , @xmath81 .    by implication",
    ", @xmath82 is a continuous function on its domain , a non - increasing function of @xmath0 and a non - decreasing function of @xmath69 .",
    "one more important functional characteristic of qkd system is the upper bound of the security degrees which can be achieved with the given external key consumption rate .",
    "it ca nt decrease as external key consumption rate @xmath69 increases .",
    "we define this function @xmath83 of @xmath69 , @xmath39 , by the following formula :    @xmath84    by implication , @xmath85 is a continuous function on its domain and a non - decreasing function of @xmath69 .    since there is the security degree among the arguments of the functions @xmath38 and @xmath82 , it is necessary to point out the class of attacks ( see subsection [ secclassattack ] ) relative to which the keys have the declared security .    in view of the key degradation problem ( see subsection [ seckeydegrad ] ) we will distinguish the systems with _",
    "one - time _ and _ permanent external key consumption_. formally , we will say that the system needs maximum one - time external key consumption ( no key degradation problem ) , if @xmath86 when @xmath0 is fixed ( hence , @xmath87 ) . otherwise we will say that the system needs permanent external key consumption .",
    "thus , for engineering description of the qkd system we have proposed the functions @xmath45 , @xmath79 , @xmath83 .",
    "it is worthwhile to simplify these functional characteristics to a set of numerical characteristics of qkd systems which may be useful both for engineers and end - users .",
    "so , there is a problem to choose a set of numbers which good describes the functions .      at first",
    ", we consider the simple case of one - time external key consumption rate , i.e. , @xmath88 and @xmath89 .",
    "it is clear that we are interested in the generation of keys with at most achievable security degrees .",
    "we are not interested in the behaviour of the function @xmath59 in the area where @xmath0 is close to zero .",
    "so , we must choose some numerical characteristics of the function @xmath59 which concerns with the interesting area .",
    "first , we are interested in the upper bound @xmath90 of the achievable security degrees . by continuity of the function @xmath82 , @xmath91 , so we can generate keys only at rates smaller than @xmath90 .",
    "but there is a difference how fast increases the rate as the security degree decreases from @xmath90 . in order to characterise this",
    "we approximate the function @xmath59 by its tangent in the point @xmath90 and introduce the _ marginal increment of key generation rate _ ( @xmath92 ) @xmath93 where the derivative is left - sided ( since @xmath59 hits zero in @xmath90 , this point may be salient ) . since @xmath59 is a non - increasing function , @xmath94 and @xmath95 .",
    "so , key generation rate with the desirable security degree of the pair of keys @xmath0 is approximately calculated by @xmath96 vice versa , the security degree of the pair of keys generated at a given rate @xmath82 is calculated by @xmath97    so , in this simple ( but practical ) case , we need only two numbers in order to approximately characterise a qkd system : the _ marginal security degree _ @xmath90 , @xmath98 and the marginal increment of key generation rate @xmath92 , @xmath99 .",
    "if a qkd system has greater @xmath90 and @xmath92 than another one , then the first qkd system is better because it allows to generate more secure keys at higher rates .",
    "now we consider the general case .",
    "we are interested in the key generation with the maximal security degree and the minimal external key consumption rate , i.e. , in the area where @xmath0 is close to @xmath78 and @xmath69 is close to @xmath77 .",
    "but the difficulty is that @xmath100 can be far from @xmath78 and this is an unacceptable variant .",
    "so , the user have to find compromise values of @xmath0 and @xmath69 .    the value that characterise the quality of the qkd system is the minimal achievable distance of the curve @xmath83 , @xmath81 , to the point @xmath101 :    @xmath102 where @xmath103 and @xmath104 , @xmath105 , are some fixed coefficients . for example",
    ", one can take @xmath106 .",
    "but it may be useful to set @xmath107 and @xmath108 so that @xmath109 , because the security degree and the external key consumption rate are not equivalent amounts .",
    "for example , @xmath110 ( i.e. , on each 10 bits of the new keys one have to spend 1 bit of the external keys ) may be acceptable , but the security degree @xmath111 may be too small . if @xmath109 , one pay larger penalty for the distance @xmath0 from 1 than for the distance @xmath69 from 0 .",
    "optimal values of @xmath69 and @xmath0 with respect to this distance we denote by @xmath112 and @xmath113 .",
    "these values can also be used as a characteristic of the qkd system : these are the parameters at which key generation is optimal .    but @xmath114 by definition of the function @xmath83 and continuity of the function @xmath115 . as in the case @xmath116",
    ", we have to introduce a characteristic showing how fast the key generation rate increases when @xmath0 decreases from @xmath117 and @xmath69 remains constant .",
    "we define marginal increment ( mir ) of key generation rate as    @xmath118 where the derivative is left - sided .",
    "we are also interested in the ends of the function @xmath83 .",
    "consider the right end .",
    "there are two possibilities for : either @xmath119 or @xmath120 . in the latter case ,",
    "define @xmath121    of course , the first case is more preferable than the second one . in the first case , it s possible to generate pairs of keys with some security degree without external key consumption . in the second case , the external key consumption rate ca",
    "nt be smaller than @xmath122 even if we want to generate a pair of keys with very small security degree .",
    "we define the quantity @xmath123 which we will call the _ security degree of the pair of keys without the external key consumption_. negative @xmath124 corresponds to the second case where the external key consumption rate ca nt be smaller than some value ( @xmath125 ) .    similarly analyse the right end of the function @xmath83 , i.e. , @xmath126    there are also two possibilities : @xmath127 or @xmath128 . in the first case , define @xmath129    the first case is more preferable than the second one . in the first case , it is possible to generate keys with the security arbitrarily close to perfect with external key consumption rate less than the amount @xmath130 . in the second case , the security degree ca",
    "nt be larger as @xmath128 even if the external key consumption rate is very close to 1 .",
    "we define the quantity @xmath131 which we will call the _ gain at the maximal external key consumption_.    thus , we obtain six characteristics of the qkd system with the external key consumption : @xmath132 , @xmath117 , @xmath112 , @xmath92 , @xmath133 and @xmath134 .",
    "approximately the key generation rate in a point @xmath135 , @xmath136 is given by    @xmath137    it is assumed that the user generates the keys with the parameters near the optimal point @xmath138 , so @xmath139 . and the user knowing the above numeric characteristics can approximately ( rather rough ) calculate the key generation rate in a point @xmath140 , @xmath136 , by the formula    @xmath141    vice versa , the security degree of pair of keys generated at a given rate @xmath82 and external key consumption rate @xmath69 is calculated by @xmath142 @xmath112 is an approximate value of the external key consumption rate , if the user generates the keys in a point near the optimum .",
    "@xmath133 and @xmath134 do nt participate in these approximations , but they characterise the potential abilities of a qkd system .",
    "and @xmath143 is an index of quality of a system .",
    "consider the simple case of no external key consumption from the point of view of the general case .",
    "it was said before that @xmath86 , when @xmath0 is fixed , and @xmath144 .",
    "evidently , @xmath145 , @xmath146 and @xmath147 .",
    "@xmath148 , if @xmath149 , and @xmath150 , if @xmath151 .",
    "the quantity @xmath92 coincides with the same quantity that we defined for the simple case .",
    "thus , one can use these characteristics for both the general and simple cases .",
    "of course , besides these numeric characteristics the user must know about the assumptions about the adversary and the distance within which these characteristics are valid .",
    "finally , we propose the following list of qualitative and quantitative characteristics which can be included in the specification :    1 .   the assumed degree of the adversary s mastering of quantum technologies : incomplete / complete 2 .   method of providing with the authenticity of the classical channel : technological / mathematical 3 .   the assumed adversary s computing power : limited / unlimited 4 .",

    "gain at the maximal external key consumption @xmath134 ( variation interval is @xmath155 $ ] , dimensionless value ) 10 . the distance within which these characteristics are valid ( km ) .",
    "larger value of each of the numeric characteristics ( except ( iv ) ) is preferable . in the first three ( qualitative ) characteristics",
    "the second value is preferable .",
    "it is assumed that the producer of the qkd system has to give to the engineer the functions @xmath156 , @xmath82 , @xmath85 ( analytical formulas or graphics ) and characteristics 1  10 . to the end - user",
    "the producer has to give characteristics 1  10 .",
    "the present - day commercial quantum cryptography solutions have the encryption systems ( aes and 3des ) attached to the qkd systems .",
    "the security of these encryption protocols when the keys are perfectly secure is a problem of conventional cryptography , but the above ( or similar ) characteristics about the security of keys and key generation must be given .    in subsection [ secsimpspec ]",
    "we have introduced three characteristics for the simplest case : security degree @xmath0 , length of keys @xmath1 and key refresh rate @xmath2 .",
    "length of keys @xmath1 drops out since @xmath1 is not a constant any more : in the general case the user can choose any @xmath1 .",
    "security degree @xmath0 is also not a constant any more , but some information about the values that @xmath0 can have is given in characteristics ( iv ) and ( v ) ( in the case of no key degradation problem , these characteristics are equal ) . @xmath157 as a function of @xmath1 and @xmath0 , which specifies the user , can be calculated by formulas ( [ eqrviav ] ) and ( [ eqvviamir&epsopt ] ) .    for",
    "the end - user ten characteristics may be too many and it s necessary to reduce the number of characteristics .",
    "firstly , some of the above characteristics may be equal for all or for a very wide class of the qkd systems and will be eliminated .",
    "secondly , some of these characteristics may be for engineers rather then for end - users . in our opinion , characteristics ( i)-(iv ) , ( vii ) and ( x ) ( i.e. , three qualitative and three quantitative characteristics ) are most important for the user .",
