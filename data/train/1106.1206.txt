    "atomic clusters of nanometer size have attracted a special attention of the present day research due to their applications in the field of optoelectronic,@xcite catalysis,@xcite data - storage,@xcite sensors@xcite etc .",
    "the first step to the theoretical study of the properties of clusters is the determination of the minimum energy structures .",
    "the equilibrium minimum energy structures of small clusters often prefer compact geometries@xcite like icosahedral or cub - octahedral symmetry based structures .",
    "it has also been found in several cases that the deformed three dimensional sections of the face centered cubic ( fcc ) or hexagonal closed packed ( hcp ) lattice appear as degenerate energy state or closely lying isomers.@xcite however , depending upon the local symmetry , they exhibit profoundly different properties . for example , planner gold clusters exhibit outstanding catalytic activity compared to their bulk counterpart of fcc symmetry,@xcite bi - layer ru - nanoclusters exhibit significant chemical activity towards h@xmath2o splitting compared to ru - clusters of hcp symmetry.@xcite similarly , the dependence of magnetic behavior of the pd clusters on cluster symmetry is found to be significant.@xcite all of these indicate that the determination of the local symmetry is an unavoidable part in a cluster calculation .    in this article , we have performed a first principles based analysis to understand the structural trend of transition metal clusters . transition metal clusters demand special attention because of their fascinating magnetic properties,@xcite the dependence of the equilibrium structure on magnetism@xcite as well as their potential biomedical applications.@xcite we focus our attention only to the 3@xmath0 late transition metal clusters . among the 3@xmath0 late transition metal elements ,",
    "mn has a half - filled @xmath0-level , while the others have more than half - filled @xmath0-level . considering the earlier studies on structure of the 3@xmath0 late transition metal clusters",
    ", it is seen that the small mn and fe clusters generally prefer a compact icosahedral growth pattern as has been shown by the first principles calculations for the mn clusters@xcite and fe clusters.@xcite for relatively less magnetic ni clusters and nonmagnetic cu - clusters , the first principles calculations and also some experimental evidences indicate mainly icosahedral growth pattern.@xcite@xmath3@xcite some recent calculations@xcite also highlight non - icosahedral or amorphous structural pattern for small clusters of coinage metals like cu , ag and au . on the other hand ,",
    "the ferromagnetic small cobalt cluster is quite different from the other members of the 3@xmath0 late transition metal series , particularly mn and fe clusters .",
    "the small co@xmath4 clusters rather prefer relatively non - compact layer - like structures . in our recent work@xcite using first - principles density functional study , we have shown a clear hexagonal growth pattern for the small co@xmath4 clusters ( 15@xmath5n@xmath520 ) .",
    "hexagonal symmetry based structures in this size range consist of 3-planes with hcp stacking .",
    "also recently , this layer - like structures of the small co@xmath4 clusters ( 13@xmath5n@xmath523 ) has been reported by gong",
    "_ et al_@xcite using density functional calculation",
    ". experimental work on small co@xmath4 clusters ( n@xmath650),@xcite though is unable to give any definitive conclusion , indicates non - icosahedral packing too .",
    "it is therefore curious why the small cobalt clusters prefer a hcp growth pattern with layer - like stacking , while the clusters of the other 3@xmath0 late transition metal elements apparently prefer a more compact icosahedral growth pattern . in order to have an understanding on this issue ,",
    "we have chosen these two close packed structures with hcp and icosahedral symmetries as the starting guesses and allowed them to relax under the assumption of _ collinear _ magnetic ordering .",
    "we have studied the relative stability between these two symmetry based structures in terms of energetics , structural and electronic properties .",
    "we have carried out our study for the entire series of 3@xmath0 late transition metal clusters i.e mn@xmath4 , fe@xmath4 , co@xmath4 , ni@xmath4 and cu@xmath4 .",
    "our study reveals that the contrasting behavior of the stability of co - clusters compared to the other members , arises due to the interesting interplay of the effects of magnetization and hybridization .",
    "we employed density functional theory within plane wave pseudo potential method as implemented in vienna _ ab initio _ simulation package.@xcite we used the projected augmented wave pseudo - potentials@xcite and the perdew - bruke - ernzerhof exchange - correlation functional@xcite of the generalized gradient approximation ( gga ) .",
    "the pseudo potentials for the transition metal elements studied in this work , were generated considering the 3@xmath0 and 4@xmath1 electrons as the valence electrons .",
    "the energy cut - off was 335 ev for the cluster calculation of each transition metal .",
    "we did both spin - polarized and non - spin polarized calculations at the @xmath7 point of the brillouin zone .",
    "geometry optimizations have been performed using the conjugate gradient and the quasi - newtonian methods until all the force components were less than a threshold value of 0.01 ev /  .",
    "for the cluster calculation , a simple cubic super - cell was used with periodic boundary conditions , where two neighboring clusters were kept separated by around 12  vacuum space , which essentially makes the interaction between cluster images negligible . to determine the magnetic moment of the minimum energy structure in spin - polarized calculations , we have explicitly considered all the possible spin multiplicities for each structure under the approximation of _ collinear _ atomic spin arrangements .",
    "to make our conclusion regarding structural and electronic properties of the clusters more general , we have chosen the cluster size of 19 atoms for each 3@xmath0 late transition metal cluster considered in this study , instead of cluster size of 13-atoms , which is the first geometric magic size for the icosahedral symmetry based structure of the most transition metal clusters .",

    "can be thought of two interpenetrating 13-atoms icosahedrons . as seen from fig.[tseries_str ] , a 19-atoms cluster structure of hcp symmetry appears more open in the sense of lesser value of average co - ordination of atoms as well as more layer - like structure compared to the 19-atoms icosahedral structure . in the first step of our optimization procedure ,",
    "we have started with ideal hexagonal and icosahedral structure for 19 atom clusters and have optimized them . in the second step , we have randomly displaced few atoms in the optimized structure , obtained in the first step , and have reoptimized to get the `` final optimized '' structure .",
    "the second step has been carried out considering all possible collinear spin arrangements of the atomic spins in each x@xmath8 ( x = mn , fe , co , ni , cu ) cluster within the spin - polarized calculation .",
    "the optimized clusters do not have perfect hexagonal or icosahedral symmetry but are heavily distorted .",
    "first , to analyze the optimized structures , we define the average nearest - neighbor bond length as @xmath9 = @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is the bond distance between the @xmath12-th and @xmath13-th atoms , and @xmath14 is the number of such bonds . in cluster calculation , we considered that the two atoms are said to be bonded if their inter atomic distance is within 2.75 , which is larger than any of the nearest neighbor bulk bond - lengths of these 3@xmath0 late transition metal elements .",
    "[ avgbl ] shows the plot of the average nearest - neighbor bond - lengths of the optimized structures of x@xmath8 clusters for both the symmetries .",
    "it is seen that the average nearest - neighbor bond - lengths for the hcp structures are consistently smaller than those of the icosahedral counterpart in agreement with the previous study,@xcite which indicates that the net attraction of nucleus on outer shell electrons is effectively more for the hcp symmetry based structure .",
    "as the @xmath0-shell gets filled one by one electron from mn @xmath15 fe @xmath15 co @xmath15 ni @xmath15 cu , the ion - electron interaction gets stronger , which increases the binding . on the other hand , electron - electron repulsion also increases , which starts to downplay the gain in electron - ion attraction . on top of this effect",
    ", the increased atom - centered magnetic moments also play a significant role , specially for the members left of co along co@xmath8 to fe@xmath8 to mn@xmath8 .",

    "conversely , the hcp symmetry based structure is energetically more favorable than the icosahedral structure for the co@xmath8 cluster , while both the structures are almost degenerate for the ni@xmath8 and cu@xmath8 clusters within the accuracy of our calculations . analyzing the atomic spin orientations in the optimized structures of both the symmetries of each x@xmath8 cluster",
    ", we found that the mn - mn interactions within the mn@xmath8 cluster is mostly antiferomagnetic for both the optimal hcp and optimal icosahedral phases as mentioned by the earlier works.@xcite on the other hand , each of the fe@xmath8 , co@xmath8 and ni@xmath8 clusters is ferromagnetic for either of the two structural symmetries , with decreasing total magnetic moment because the atom centered magnetic moments decrease as one goes along fe@xmath8 @xmath15 co@xmath8 @xmath15 ni@xmath8 .",
    "[ magdis ] shows the distribution of atomic magnetic moments of each of the x@xmath8 clusters derived from both the symmetries together with the corresponding optimized structures .",
    "note that bulk mn is also anti - ferromagnetic and bulk fe , co , ni are ferromagnetic ( with magnetic moment per atom 2.2 @xmath19 for fe,@xcite 1.72 @xmath19 for co@xcite and 0.616 @xmath19 for ni@xcite ) .",
    "the cu@xmath8 cluster is found to be non - magnetic with zero magnetic moment .    to have a visual representation ,",
    "we have plotted the binding energy per atom for the optimal hcp and optimal icosahedral structures of each x@xmath8 cluster in fig .",

    "[ cohesive ] ( right panel ) with shaded bars .",
    "interestingly , non - spin polarized calculation shows that the mn@xmath8 , fe@xmath8 and co@xmath8 clusters all stabilize in hcp symmetry based structures , while both the structures are again degenerate for the ni@xmath8 and cu@xmath8 clusters . from fig .",
    "[ cohesive ] , it is also clearly seen that the magnetic phase always has the higher binding energy for both the structures of each x@xmath8 cluster , indicating that the magnetic phase is the stable phase for both the structures . only in case of the cu@xmath8 cluster ,",
    "the binding energy of each structure is same for both the spin polarized as well as non - spin polarized calculations , indicating that the cu@xmath8 cluster is nonmagnetic . from the binding energy plot",
    ", we therefore conclude that the magnetism switches the stable phase from hcp to icosahedron in case of the mn@xmath8 and fe@xmath8 clusters , while the magnetism enhances further the stability of the hcp phase for the co@xmath8 cluster . for the ni@xmath8 and cu@xmath8 clusters ,",
    "the effect of magnetism is small and both the hcp as well as icosahedral symmetry based structures are almost degenerate for both spin polarized as well as non - spin polarized calculations .    for mn clusters ,",
    "the effect of noncollinearity has been discussed in literature.@xcite mn is prone to noncollinearity due to the presence of competing nature of magnetic interactions , though the degree of noncollinearity is found to decrease for cluster sizes larger than 13.@xcite for fe and co clusters , the degree of noncollinearity is reported to be further smaller compared to mn.@xcite noncollinearity is favored by the magnetic energy associated with larger magnetic moments , which competes with chemical bonding energy .",
    "one would therefore expect reduction of noncollinearity in moving to larger cluster size as well as moving from mn to fe and co. however , in order to check the influence of the possible noncollinearity which may arise due to competing magnetic interactions as well as orbital component of magnetic moment , driven by spin - orbit ( so ) coupling , we have repeated our calculations for fe@xmath8 and co@xmath8 clusters in terms of gga+so calculations .",
    "the obtained results indicate that the fe@xmath8 and co@xmath8 clusters are essentially collinear , with degree of noncollinearity being less than 2@xmath20 in agreement with that reported previously.@xcite though the orbital components of magnetism are found to be of finite values @xmath21 0.08 @xmath19 , importantly the calculations carried out considering noncollinearity leads to only small changes in the binding energy differences of the icosahedral and hexagonal geometries by 1- 2 @xmath22 , keeping the main conclusion of our study unchanged . in the following , we focus primarily on the fe@xmath8 and co@xmath8 clusters , for which the switching of the stable phase between hcp and icosahedral structures occurs .",
    "it is important to note that the trend in binding energy calculation is very robust , being independent of the type of pseudo - potential or the nature of the exchange - correlation functional used in this study .",
    "we also found that this trend to be general for clusters having sizes 15@xmath5n@xmath520.@xcite the structures for n=15 , 16 , 17 , 18 and 20 were obtained by removing or adding atoms from the optimal 19-atom cluster structure and then letting them to optimize for all possible collinear spin configurations of the constituting atoms . in fig .",

[ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     the pertinent question , therefore , is what drives this phenomena ? to see the effect of magnetism , we first calculated the magnetic energy which is defined as the energy difference between the magnetic ( spin - polarized ) and nonmagnetic ( non - spin - polarized ) calculations for each of the hcp and icosahedral structures of x@xmath8 clusters , estimated for their optimal structures in magnetic and nonmagnetic calculations .",
    "[ mag_energy](a ) shows the plot of magnetic energies of the x@xmath8 clusters for the hcp and icosahedral symmetry based optimal structures .",
    "it is interesting to note that the magnetic energy of icosahedral structure is much higher than that of the hcp symmetry based structure for the fe@xmath8 clusters ( and also for mn@xmath8 cluster , though we do not bring it into our discussion due to the assumption of collinearity in our calculation as mentioned before ) . on the other hand",
    ", it is of similar magnitudes for the hcp symmetry based structure of co@xmath8 cluster and its icosahedral counterpart , with hcp being somewhat higher .",
    "the magnetic energy difference between hcp and icosahedral structures is negligibly small in case of the ni@xmath8 and cu@xmath8 clusters .",

    "[ mag_energy](b ) in order to see the effect of magnetic energy more closely , which shows opposite trend of magnetic energy gain between fe@xmath8 and that of co@xmath8 more clearly .",
    "we note that the difference of magnetic energy gains between the hcp and icosahedral structures in the case of the co@xmath8 cluster , is relatively small compared to that of the fe@xmath8 cluster .",
    "as the @xmath0-shell gets progressively filled up , starting from the half - filled situation with the highest atom - centered magnetic moment for mn@xmath4 cluster , the magnetic energy gain gets progressively weaker , thereby the role of magnetism being more important for fe , compared to co.    in order to understand the gain in magnetic energy for the icosahedral structure of the fe@xmath8 cluster and for the hcp structure of the co@xmath8 cluster , we have studied the density of states ( dos ) of the optimized hcp and icosahedral structures of the fe@xmath8 and co@xmath8 clusters for both the magnetic and nonmagnetic calculations as shown in fig .",
    "we note that compared to the nonmagnetic dos , the gap in the majority spin channel is significantly enhanced in case of the icosahedral structure of fe@xmath8 and the hcp structure of co@xmath8 , indicating their enhanced stability . on the other hand , for the optimal hcp structure of fe@xmath8 and for the optimal icosahedral structure of co@xmath8 cluster in case of spin - polarized calculation , there are finite amount of states around the fermi energy , which reduces the stability of the system , compared to that of the corresponding icosahedral and hcp structures .",
    "we next study another relevant quantity which has been used previously to examine the relative stability between the various classes of isomers for the 3@xmath0 late transition metal clusters , namely the hybridization of the atomic 3@xmath0 and 4@xmath1 orbitals .",

    "the positive ( negative ) value of this difference , h@xmath29@xmath30 , indicates that the hcp ( icosahedron ) structure has higher @xmath1-@xmath0 hybridization .",
    "it is clearly seen that though the difference is positive for all the late transition metal clusters , it shows some variation across the series . the @xmath1-@xmath0 hybridization gain in favor of hexagonal structure is the maximum for the magnetic co@xmath8 cluster , showing a factor of about 6 times enhancement compared to nonmagnetic co@xmath8 .",
    "cu@xmath8 cluster being essentially nonmagnetic , @xmath1-@xmath0 hybridization gain between the two structural symmetries remains same both in magnetic and nonmagnetic calculation of cu@xmath8 .",

    "we therefore , conclude that the gain in @xmath1-@xmath0 hybridization stabilizes the hcp symmetry based structure over the icosahedral symmetry based structure for the co@xmath8 cluster .",
    "this is also helped in a way by the small but positive magnetic energy gain in favor of hcp phase of the co@xmath8 cluster .",
    "so the @xmath1-@xmath0 hybridization helped by magnetic energy gain stabilizes the hcp symmetry based structure in case of the co@xmath8 cluster . on the other hand , for fe@xmath8 cluster ,",
    "the large magnetic energy gain in favor of the icosahedral symmetry , decides the final stability , thereby counteracting the hybridization energy gain in favor of hexagonal symmetry .",
    "to summarize , we have investigated the relative stability of the 3@xmath0 late transition metal clusters specially of 19 atoms between hcp and icosahedral symmetries . among all the members",
    ", the co@xmath8 cluster prefers an unusual stabilization in hexagonal symmetry , while the rest show the preference of icosahedral symmetry .",
    "our study nicely demonstrates that this curious result is driven by the interplay of the gain in magnetic energy _",

    "<S> using first - principles density functional theory based calculations , we analyze the structural stability of small clusters of 3@xmath0 late transition metals . </S>",

    "<S> we find that the co clusters show an unusual stability in hexagonal symmetry compared to the small clusters of other members which are found to stabilize in icosahedral symmetry based structure . </S>",
    "<S> our study reveals that this is driven by the interplay between the magnetic energy gain and the gain in covalency through @xmath1-@xmath0 hybridization effect . </S>",
