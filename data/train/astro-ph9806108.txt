    "over 30 years ago , in a now seminal paper , hnon ( 1965 ) introduced the stability parameter @xmath0 , which distinguished whether a given periodic orbit is stable or not .",
    "this distinction is essential since the properties of the two types of orbits differ considerably .",
    "indeed stable periodic orbits trap regular orbits around them , while unstable ones trigger chaos .",
    "the use of hnon s stability parameter is , however , not limited to that . by allowing us to find precisely the value of the energy for which a given family changes from stable to unstable , or vice - versa",
    ", it allows us to find the point from which new families bifurcate , since for a periodic orbit a transition from stability to instability results in a bifurcation of a new stable family , while a transition from instability to stability introduces a new unstable family .    to calculate stability , hnon ( 1965 ) approached the differential of the poincar map by finite differences .",
    "this technique has been so far widely followed in galactic dynamics ( e.g. contopoulos & grsb@xmath1l 1989 and references therein ) .",
    "nevertheless it suffers from a number of disadvantages .",
    "we have found it quite adequate in regular regions , but found it could not cope with difficult chaotic regions .",
    "for this reason we present here an alternative approach , based on the differential of the poincar map using the first variational equation .",
    "we will hereafter refer to it as variational equation method .",
    "the variational equation technique is used in other domains that need very accurate results , like the study of the three - body problem , the strmer problem or a few others problems in celestial mechanics ( e.g. deprit & price 1965 ; markellos 1974 ; markellos & zagouras 1977 ) , as well as to obtain the lyapunov exponents ( benettin et al . , 1976 , 1980 ; contopoulos et al . , 1978 ; udry & pfenniger 1988 ) .",
    "in this paper the variational equation will allow us to obtain the differential of the poincar map exactly . in section [ sec : method ]",
    "we give a very brief mathematical justification of this method , which is well known from other applications , and then we apply it to the particular case of a two - dimensional system which is stationary in a rotating frame of reference , a case often encountered in galactic dynamics problems .",
    "section [ sec : axisym ] gives an example demonstrating the accuracy of the method we propose and section [ sec : bar ] another example for which this new method gives accurate results , while finite differences can not cope .",
    "we conclude in section [ sec : conclusions ] .",
    "let us consider an autonomous dynamical system , expressed by the ordinary differential equation ( hereafter ode ) .",
    "@xmath2 with @xmath3 and where @xmath4 . by a solution of this ode",
    "we will mean a map @xmath5 such that @xmath6 .    using the precepts of poincar ( 1892 ) we can reduce the study of a continuous time system ( ode ) to the study of an associated discrete time system ( map ) called the poincar map , @xmath7 ; @xmath8 where @xmath9 is a hyper - surface perpendicular to the flow @xmath10 , which we will hereafter refer to as section",
    ", @xmath11 is an open set in @xmath9 , and @xmath12 is the time necessary for the point @xmath13 to return for the first time to the section with the same sense of transversal of @xmath9 . with this technique",
    "the problem of calculating the stability of a periodic solution of a ode is reduced to the problem of calculating the stability of a fixed point of a map . for this we must check if solutions starting _ close _ to a fixed point at a given time remain _ close _ to it for all later times ( lyapunov stability ) .",
    "we thus compute the taylor series expansion and we study the linear term of such an expansion .",
    "let @xmath14 be a fixed point of @xmath15 and @xmath16 a point in its neighbourhood .",
    "the taylor expansion of @xmath17 is    @xmath18    if we denote @xmath19 , we have the linear relation @xmath20 .",
    "the eigenvalues of @xmath21 will determine the stability . in two dimensions , if @xmath15 is an area preserving map , the periodic orbit @xmath22 is stable if @xmath23 , where @xmath0 is the stability parameter introduced by hnon ( 1965 ) and defined as @xmath24 where @xmath25 .",
    "hnon ( 1965 ) approximated the elements of the jacobi matrix @xmath26 using finite differences , i.e.    @xmath27    as will be shown below , the above approximation gives sufficient accuracy in regular regions , but not in regions dominated by chaotic dynamics .",
    "we can calculate @xmath21 exactly , as : @xmath28    the matrix @xmath29 can be obtained as a solution of the first variational equation with initial condition @xmath30 .",
    "@xmath31    to compute @xmath32 we use the fact that we are on the hyper - surface .",
    "defining the hyper - surface @xmath33 and differentiating we obtain after some algebra : @xmath34 where @xmath35 and where the symbol @xmath36 represents the dot product .",
    "the denominator is different from zero since the hyper - surface @xmath9 is perpendicular to the flow @xmath10 .",
    "we will now apply the above general technique to a two dimensional system which is stationary in a rotating frame of reference .",
    "let us consider an autonomous dynamical system , expressed by the following ode @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the potential , @xmath39 is the pattern speed of the coordinate system in which the dynamical system is stationary , and @xmath40 and @xmath41 denote the partial derivatives of the potential with respect to @xmath13 and @xmath42 respectively .",
    "writing the above second order ode as a system of four first order ode , and using the momenta @xmath43 and @xmath44 we get @xmath45    this can also be expressed in vectorial form @xmath46 with @xmath47 and since below we will need the individual components of @xmath10 , we will denote them as @xmath48 with @xmath49 to 4 .",
    "hereafter , numbers as subindex indicate a component .    since on the poincar section @xmath50 and",
    "since the energy in a rotating frame , @xmath51 , is an integral of motion , we can express @xmath52 as a function of @xmath13 and @xmath53 , i.e. @xmath54 .",
    "this restricts the poincar map to the two - dimensional space @xmath55 . since , however , the system of first order odes has four equations , the variational equation and the method to calculate the differential of the poincar map hold in a four - dimensional space .",
    "we must therefore express the poincar map in four dimensions in order to calculate the differential and finally project in the two - dimensional space @xmath55 as shown schematically below    @xmath56[r]{$i$ } \\uparrow & &   \\downarrow\\makebox[0pt][l]{$\\pi$ } \\\\",
    "( x , x ) & \\stackrel{p}{\\longrightarrow } &   ( \\bar{x},\\bar{x } )   \\end{array } \\right\\}\\rightarrow p=\\pi\\circ\\psi\\circ i\\ ] ]    where @xmath57 includes @xmath55 in @xmath58 using the section equation and the integral of motion , @xmath59 is the poincar map in @xmath58 and @xmath60 projects the two first coordinates in @xmath61 .",
    "we can therefore write the differential of the poincar map as @xmath62 .",
    "let us now proceed as in the general case , taking the derivative of @xmath63 @xmath64    here @xmath65 , @xmath66 is the solution of the first variational equation with initial condition @xmath67 . to obtain",
    "@xmath68 we use the section equation @xmath50 , which in @xmath58 is equivalent to @xmath69 .",
    "we differentiate it and we obtain that the third vector of the matrix equation ( [ dpsi ] ) should be equal to zero , i.e. @xmath70 , from which it follows that    @xmath71    now we can express @xmath21 in matrix form @xmath72    where @xmath52 is , as discussed above , considered as a function of @xmath13 and @xmath53 .",
    "we see that in order to obtain @xmath21 we need to apply @xmath73 only to @xmath74 , that is , we need to apply @xmath29 only to @xmath74 .",
    "then , instead of solving the variational equation with initial condition @xmath67 , which gives us @xmath75 , we solve it applied to the vectors in @xmath74 , which means solving @xmath76 with initial condition @xmath77 and @xmath78@xmath79 .",
    "we will now show how it can be computed in practice .",
    "we integrate simultaneously the orbit and the variational equation for the two vectors in @xmath74 .",
    "@xmath80    @xmath81    with @xmath82 and with @xmath83    finally with those vectors we write @xmath21 as @xmath84 remember that @xmath85 indicates the first return to the section - in the same sense of traversal - after the point @xmath86 .",
    "this method involves the integration of a system of 12 rather than 4 equations , because we do nt move only the point , but also two vectors .",
    "this of course takes more computational time , but it gives us an accurate value for @xmath21 , since the error in @xmath21 is of the same order as that of the section points .",
    "as a first example let us take the axisymmetric logarithmic potential @xmath87    where @xmath88 and @xmath89 are constants taken , in our example , to be equal to @xmath90 and @xmath91 respectively ( binney & tremaine 1987 ) .",
    "the orbits of the main , circular family present no difficulty , so both finite differences and the variational equation method give roughly the same results .",
    "we can , however , compare the accuracy of the two methods by calculating the determinant of @xmath21 , which we will hereafter refer to as @xmath92 .",
    "its elements for finite differences are given by eq .",
    "( [ der - hen ] ) , while for the variational equation method by eq .",
    "( [ dp ] ) .",
    "a perfectly accurate calculation would of course give @xmath93 , and for less accurate calculations the determinant will deviate more from unity than for more accurate ones .",
    "we calculated finite differences for @xmath94 , @xmath95 , @xmath96 and @xmath97 and we found that @xmath98 gives the most accurate results .",
    "they are compared with those of the variational equation method in fig .",
    "[ axi - log ] , which shows for both the value of @xmath99 .",
    "the difference in accuracy between the two methods is striking !",
    "the finite difference method gives an accuracy between @xmath96 and @xmath100 , while the accuracy of the variational equation method is bound only by the accuracy of the orbit calculation .",
    "it is this limiting accuracy that results also in the `` quantisation '' of the resulting values .",
    "thus the variational equation method gives , in most cases , an accuracy of at least @xmath101 better than that obtained with finite differences .",
    "the improvement in accuracy depends on the case considered and is more important in more chaotic regions .",
    "in the previous section we discussed an example where the variational equation method gives quantitatively more accurate results . in other cases , however , the differences between the two methods can be even qualitative . for our second example we will use the model 1 of athanassoula ( 1992 , hereafter a92 ) . for most principal families the results of the two methods are in rough agreement , although the accuracy of the variational equation method is always better by at least as much as what we saw in the previous example .",
    "however , for families whose characteristic curve approaches the curve of zero velocity asymptotically , the differences can be much more important and there can be disagreement even as to whether a given orbit is stable or unstable . as an example let us take a lagrangian family , the second one from the right in the lower panel of fig . 2 of a92 .",
    "we calculated its stability using finite differences as well as using the variational equation method and compare the results in fig .",
    "[ lagr - mn92 ] .    using the variational equation method we were able to show that this family is stable for as long as we could follow it . on the other hand finite differences with @xmath102",
    "find that the orbits are unstable if @xmath103 , while for @xmath104 , @xmath105 and @xmath106 the values of the jacobi constant for which the family changes from stable to unstable are -126150 , -126000 and -126500 respectively .",
    "thus finite differences give results that are qualitatively different from those of the variational equation method and that depend heavily on the adopted value of @xmath107 . with the help of poincar sections we confirmed that indeed this family is stable and therefore that it is the variational equation method that gives the correct result .",
    "we next repeated the calculation again using finite differences but this time keeping only the points for which the value of the determinant @xmath92 is sufficiently close to unity and noted that in this way the erroneous values disappeared .",
    "although we are thus able to remove erroneous values , we are not able to find the correct value for the stability parameter , unless we use the variational equation method .",
    "in essence the difference between the two techniques is that finite differences involve the calculation of @xmath108 for every element in the jacobian matrix of the poincar map .",
    "numerically it is not possible to calculate the @xmath109 , so we have to calculate this expression for different @xmath110 in order to find the optimum one that gives the best approach to the limit .",
    "it is , however , well known that calculating the derivative from finite differences can be unstable , and that it may not be possible to obtain a good approximation of @xmath111 .",
    "thus this method may need several trials ( i.e. more computing time ) , an _ a posteriori _ check of the results , and , in certain cases , it may not be possible to find an appropriate value of @xmath110 .",
    "the new method here calculates the jacobian matrix accurately and does nt depend on any @xmath107 .",
    "it may involve some extra computing time because it involves the integration of more differential equations , but this is , more often than not , compensated by the fact that it needs only one trial .",
    "its assets are that it involves no tunable parameter , needs no _ a posteriori _ checking of the results and its accuracy is only limited by the method used to find the periodic orbits . in regular regions the two methods give similar results , although the variational equation method is always more accurate .",
    "in chaotic or `` difficult '' regions , however , e.g. regions involving small stable islands in a chaotic sea , using the variational equation method may prove essential for obtaining the correct value of the stability parameter .",
    "furthermore , a study of such regions may be very time consuming and the fact that with the variational equation method one can find precisely the bifurcation points of new families can be a big help .",
    "we thus recommend it for all calculations such as the ones presented here .",
