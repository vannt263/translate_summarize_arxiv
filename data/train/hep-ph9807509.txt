    "should r parity turn out to be an approximate symmetry of the minimal supersymmetric standard model , the truly quantitative tests of such a possibility would have to be sought in high energy colliders physics , as was first emphasized in @xcite .",
    "the great majority of the existing theoretical studies for the lep or the tevatron accelerators physics have focused on signals associated with the lsp ( lightest supersymmetric particle ) decays and certain rare decays of the standard model particles ( gauge @xcite or higgs @xcite bosons or top - quark @xcite ) .",
    "a few experimental searches have been attempted for @xmath19 boson decays @xcite , for inos decays @xcite and also in more general settings @xcite .",
    "proceeding one step further , interesting proposals were made recently to explain the so - called aleph anomalous four - jets events @xcite on the basis of r parity violating decays of neutralinos or charginos @xcite , squarks @xcite , sleptons @xcite or sneutrinos @xcite produced in pairs through the two - body processes , @xmath20 or @xmath21 .",
    "( see @xcite for recent updates and lists of references . )",
    "apart from precursor studies devoted to the hera collider @xcite , little consideration was given in the past to single production of supersymmetric particles in spite of the potential interest of a discovery of supersymmetry that might be accessible at lower incident energies .",
    "the reason , of course , is the lack of information about the size of the r parity odd coupling constants other than the large number of indirects bounds deduced from low and intermediate energy phenomenology @xcite .",
    "therefore , for obvious reasons , the existing single production studies have rather focused on resonant production of sneutrinos , charged sleptons @xcite or squarks @xcite .",
    "the interpretation of the anomalous high @xmath22 events recently observed at hera by the zeus @xcite and h1 @xcite collaborations , in terms of squark resonant production , has also stimulated a renewed interest in r parity violation phenomenology @xcite .",
    "the collider physics tests of supersymmetric models without r parity entail an important change in focus with respect to the conventional tests : degraded missing energy , diluted signals , additional background from the minimal supersymmetric standard model interactions and uncertainties from the r parity violation coupling constants compounded with those from the superpartners mass spectra .",
    "our purpose in this work is to discuss semi quantitatively the potential for a discovery and the tests of supersymmetry with @xmath2 body single superpartner production .",
    "although several order of magnitudes in rates are lost with respect to the resonant single production , one can dispose here of a rich variety of phenomena with multilepton final states non diagonal in flavor .",
    "besides , one may also test larger ranges of the sneutrino mass since this need not be restricted by the center of mass energy value . encouraged by the recent developments on r parity violation and by the prospects of high precision measurements at supercolliders @xcite , we propose to study single production at leptonic ( electron and muon ) colliders for the set of five @xmath2 body reactions , @xmath23 , @xmath24 , @xmath25 , @xmath26 , @xmath27,$ ] in a more systematic way than has been attempted so far .",
    "we limit ourselves to the lowest inos eigenstates .",
    "let us note here that precursor indicative studies of the inos single production reactions were already presented in @xcite and that recent discussions concerning the reactions , @xmath28 and @xmath29 , where the photon flux is radiated by one of the two beams , were presented in @xcite .",
    "we shall restrict our study to the lepton number violating interactions @xmath30 in association with the familiar gauge and yukawa couplings of the minimal supersymmetric standard model .",
    "the final states consist then of multileptons with or without hadronic jets .    this paper contains four sections . in section [ sectionf ] , we present the main formalism for superpartners production cross sections and decay rates . in section [ sectionr ] , based on the supergravity approach to supersymmetry soft breaking parameters , we present numerical results for the total rates and the various branching ratios in wide regions of the parameter space . in section [ sectioncd ] ,",

    "the relationship is most easily described at the level of the amplitudes squared obtained after summation over the spins . because of the simple action of cp on the initial state , @xmath41 , it can be seen that the amplitudes for the pairs of charge conjugated processes are related by the substitutions , @xmath42 and @xmath43 .",

    "second , the amplitude for right chirality slepton @xmath49 production has not been included in the above list of formulas for the reason that this is proportional to the coupling constants @xmath50 which vanishes by the antisymmetry property , @xmath40 .",

    "lastly , we observe that the relative signs between the @xmath53 and @xmath54 channels contributions are dictated by both the structure of the interaction lagrangian and the signs of the wick contractions for fermions .",
    "the results for the spin summed squared amplitudes are given by somewhat complicated formulas which we have assembled in appendix [ seca ] .",

    "+ a number of hypotheses and approximations , which we list below , will be employed in the evaluation of partial rates .",
    "* supersymmetric particles decays are assumed to have narrow widths ( compared to their masses ) and are produced on - shell with negligible spin correlations between the production and decay stages .",
    "this allows us to apply the familiar phase space factorisation formula for the production cross sections . *",
    "spin correlations are neglected at all stages of the cascade decays such that the branching ratios in single or double cascades can be obtained by applying recursively the standard factorisation formula .",
    "* sleptons belonging to all three families and squarks belonging to the first two families are degenerate in mass .",
    "therefore , for a given decay process as , for instance , @xmath61 , either all three generations will be energetically allowed or forbidden . furthermore , flavor off - diagonal channels such as , @xmath62 , ... are closed . * the lowest eigenstates of neutralinos @xmath63 and charginos @xmath64 ( @xmath65 ) are excited in the cascade chains .",
    "* all superpartners decay inside the detector volume . in the presence of broken r parity",
    ", the condition for electric charge neutral lsps to decay inside the detector yields comfortable lower bounds of order @xmath66 @xcite . *",
    "either a single rpv coupling constant is dominant in both the production and decay stages , or a pair of rpv coupling constants are dominant , one in the production stage ( @xmath44 ) and the other in the decay stage ( @xmath58 ) .",
    "the latter case with two dominant rpv may be of interest since strong bounds on quadratic products exist only for a few family configurations .",
    "the strongest bounds arise from the @xmath67 decay @xcite : @xmath68 $ ] , while other quadratic product bounds are of order @xmath69 .",
    "besides , as long as the coupling constant @xmath70 , which controls the rpv decays , is small in comparison with the gauge coupling constants but not very much smaller ( so that the lsp decays inside the detector ) , then the will depend weakly on @xmath70 since the last stage of the decay chain ( lsp decay ) is independent of @xmath70 .",
    "* the widths for the decays with four and higher body final states are neglected , such as those which occur in slepton ( sneutrino ) decays for , @xmath71 ( @xmath72 ) , mediated by virtual charginos or neutralinos , namely , @xmath73 and @xmath74 ( @xmath75 and @xmath76 . * a supergravity model for the soft breaking parameters",

    "the consideration of the various order relations in the superpartners mass spectrum leads to a list of decay schemes for the initially produced superparticles .",
    "these are displayed in tables [ tabloc ] , [ tabloa ] and [ tablob ] , for @xmath56 , @xmath78 and @xmath79 , respectively .",
    "the signals for the @xmath77 decays are very few in number and will be discussed separately in section [ neutralinosection ] .",

    ", one can deduce the various final states flavor configurations by an inspection of the tables ( cf .",
    "tables captions ) .",
    "the produced @xmath81 will decay according to cascade schemes dictated by the superpartners mass spectrum .",
    "it is important to distinguish the direct rpv induced decays : @xmath82 , @xmath83 , @xmath84 , @xmath85 , @xmath86 , @xmath87 , and @xmath88 , from the indirect rpc induced decays : @xmath89 , @xmath90 , @xmath91 , @xmath92 , @xmath93 , @xmath94 , @xmath95 , @xmath96 and @xmath97 for two - body final states and , @xmath98 ( f = leptons or quarks ) , for three - body final states .",
    "all the formulas needed to evaluate the partial decay widths are quoted in the appendix [ secappa ] .",
    "as can be seen from tables [ tabloc],[tabloa],[tablob ] , a given final state can arise from different processes , depending on the relative orderings of the masses .",
    "a reaction chain occuring through an intermediate particle which is produced on - shell leads obviously to the same final state when the production of this particle is kinematically forbidden and it must then occur through a virtual intermediate state . in the approximation of family",
    "degenerate sleptons , sneutrinos and squarks , the index @xmath99 in the tables runs over the three generations .",
    "a single exception is the hadronic decay , @xmath100 , which is restricted to the first two families because of the large top - quark mass .",
    "another subtle point concerns the multiplicity of a given signal , namely , the number of different configurations which can lead to the same final state . due to",
    "the antisymmetry property of @xmath58 , the final states from chargino rpv decays ( cf . a and b in table [ tabloc ] ) have a multiplicity of two .",
    "the reason is that these decays proceed through the exchanges of the sleptons ( or sneutrinos ) in families @xmath101 and @xmath102 , for a given @xmath58 .",
    "this fact is already accounted for in the virtual @xmath56 three - body decays ( a(1),b(1),table [ tabloc ] ) , but must be put by hand in the @xmath56 cascade decays proceeding through the on - shell production of sleptons or sneutrinos which decay subsequentially ( a(2),b(2),table [ tabloc ] ) .    to get a better understanding of the interplay between rpc and rpv decays , it is helpful to note that the can be written formally as , @xmath103 , for direct decays and , @xmath104 , for two - stages indirect decays , where @xmath105 is the lsp branching ratio , @xmath70 and @xmath106 are symbolic notations for the rpv and rpc coupling constants and @xmath107 are calculable constants .",
    "of course , @xmath108 , if the last decaying particle is the lsp , which is the generical case . for values of the rpv coupling constants small with respect to the gauge coupling constants ( @xmath109 ) , namely , @xmath110 , the dependence on @xmath70 of the indirect decays is weak and we have , @xmath111 . for large enough rpv ( for example , @xmath112 ) or for suppressed indirect decays ( due for example to kinematical reasons ) , the direct decays may become competitive and both the direct and indirect depend strongly on @xmath70 .",
    "we shall develop the study of single superpartner production within a non minimal supergravity framework , assuming the existence of a grand unified gauge theory and of family universal boundary conditions on the supersymmetry breaking parameters .",
    "the renormalization group improved classical spectrum of the scalar superpartners is determined in principle by the full set of soft supersymmetry breaking parameters at the unification scale , @xmath113 , namely , @xmath8 ( common scalars mass ) , @xmath9 ( common gauginos mass ) , @xmath114 ( trilinear yukawa interactions ) , @xmath115 ( bilinear higgs interaction ) ; by the parameters @xmath116 and @xmath117 , where @xmath118 denotes the running scale ; and by the gauge coupling constants , @xmath119 , along with fermions masses , @xmath120 .",
    "if one neglects the yukawa interactions of quarks and leptons with the higgs bosons , then the running masses of all sfermions remain family degenerate down to the electroweak breaking scale where they are described by the familiar additive formula ,    @xmath121    where @xmath122 are calculable coefficients depending on the gauge interactions parameters and the last term represents the d - term contribution , the upper and lower sign being for the left and right chirality sfermions , respectively .",
    "the most relevant yukawa coupling constants , namely , those of the third family of up - quarks or , for large @xmath123 , of d - quarks and leptons , are expected to induce downwards shifts for the third family squarks ( up and down ) and sleptons , which depend non trivially on the parameters @xmath114 and @xmath13 . in this work",
    ", we shall restrict consideration to the simple case of family independent running masses and employ the approximate representation in eq.([specsugra ] ) with the numerical values quoted in @xcite . note that the total rates do not depend on the squarks masses and ,",

    "we shall set the unification scale at @xmath152 and the running scale at @xmath153 .",
    "for definiteness , we choose the coupling constant , which controls the size of the production cross section , at the reference value : @xmath154 .",
    "this is the strongest bound for a slepton mass of @xmath155 @xcite .",
    "the dependence of integrated total rates on @xmath44 is then given by a simple rescaling @xmath156 but that of branching ratios on @xmath58 ( which may or may not be identified with @xmath44 ) is more complicated because of the interplay between the rpc and rpv contributions which add up in the total decay widths .",
    "the reference value used here , @xmath157 , is also an interesting borderline value since below this value the dependence of branching fractions on @xmath58 becomes negligible in generic cases .",
    "it will prove helpful in the following discussion to keep within sight the spectrum for the low - lying inos .",
    "we display in figure [ spec ] the results obtained by solving numerically the eigenvalues problem for the charginos and neutralinos mass matrices .",
    "recall the current experimental bounds @xcite , @xmath158 , @xmath159 , @xmath160 and @xmath161 . the following remarks about figure [ spec ] will prove relevant for the discussion on branching fractions : ( i ) the symmetry of the spectra under , @xmath162 , is spoilt at low @xmath123 as can be seen on the explicit expression for the inos masses in @xcite ; ( ii ) the mass differences @xmath163 increase with @xmath164 with a steep rise appearing at , @xmath165 , the borderline between the higgsino and gaugino dominant regimes ; ( iii ) the spacings @xmath166 and @xmath167 decrease in magnitudes , relatively to the @xmath77 mass , with increasing @xmath168 .",
    "although we show here the results for @xmath169 mass , the interesting possibility of exciting the second neutralino @xmath169 is not considered in the subsequent discussion .",
    "the total production rates are evaluated by taking the angular integral , @xmath170 $ ] , over the differential cross sections which are given explicitly in eqs.([eqrc4a])-([eqrc4e ] ) in appendix [ seca ] . to follow the usual practice we shall set an angular cut - off to account for the poor detection condition along the beam pipe : @xmath171 , corresponding to @xmath172 .",
    "the results for the integrated rates of the production of the lowest mass eigenstates @xmath173 and @xmath174 , at lepii energies , are displayed in figures [ chsect1 ] and [ neusect1 ] , respectively .",
    "the inos production rates depend smoothly on @xmath123 , and on the mass parameters , @xmath175 , in a way which closely reflects on the mass spectrum .",
    "thus , the symmetry under @xmath176 is upset only for low @xmath123 and the rates decrease with increasing @xmath168 .",
    "the only cases where fast variations of rates arise are for values of @xmath8 and @xmath168 at which the center of mass energy hits on the sneutrino s - channel pole , @xmath177 . as @xmath8 increases",
    ", the resonance occurs at smaller values of @xmath168 since the sneutrino mass depends on @xmath178 and @xmath179 ( see eq.([specsugra ] ) ) .",
    "the pole cross sections themselves , as parametrized by the conventional formula ,    @xmath180    can grow to values several order of magnitudes higher . for clarity , we have refrained from drawing the cross sections close to the resonant energy in the same plot .",
    "this is the reason why the curves corresponding to @xmath181 do not appear in figures [ chsect1](c)(d ) and [ neusect1](c)(d ) .",
    "the effect of the pole can be seen for @xmath182 in figures [ chsect1](a)(b ) and [ neusect1](a)(b ) .",

    "the sneutrino production cross section becomes infinite at the limiting energy point , @xmath212 .",
    "this accounts for the property of the numerical results for the integrated cross section to rise with @xmath213 , as seen in figure [ slsect](c ) .",
    "however , if one were to set @xmath209 at , say , the @xmath214-meson mass , in line with the vector meson dominance hypothesis , one would rather find the opposite behaviour with respect to the dependence on @xmath213 .",

    "the single production rates range from several 10 s of @xmath217 to a few 100 s of @xmath217 at lep energies and several units to a few 10 s of @xmath217 at nlc energies .",

    "moreover , it is important to note here that had we considered for the rpv coupling constants , constant values for the product @xmath220 , rather than for @xmath44 , the rates would get an important amplification factor @xmath221 for increasing superpartners masses . note that the slepton involved in the bound is of right chirality and thus is of opposite chirality than the slepton involved in the rate .",
    "of course , the masses of @xmath79 and @xmath222 are related in a given model . at @xmath187 and assuming @xmath223 , all the single production reactions should be potentially observable over a broad region of parameter space .",

    "the partial transition rates are readily obtained by multiplying the total rates for each reaction with the decay branching fractions .",
    "the various final states for each of the @xmath2 single production reactions have been listed in tables [ tabloc ] , [ tabloa ] and [ tablob ] .",

    "the branching ratios are then determined on the basis of simple combinatoric arguments . for a dominant coupling constant ,",
    "say , @xmath238 , there are four final states : @xmath239 , @xmath240 , @xmath241 and @xmath242 . accordingly , the branching ratios of @xmath174 into two charged leptons will depend on the type ( flavor , charge ) of the final state : the branching ratios equal @xmath243 for the flavor diagonal @xmath244 or flavor non diagonal @xmath245 channels , @xmath246 for the fixed charges and flavors @xmath247 or @xmath248 channels and @xmath249 for the lepton - antilepton pairs of unspecified flavors . for a dominant coupling constant @xmath250 , an analogous result is obtained .",
    "for @xmath251 ( case 2 ) , the branching ratio for @xmath174 decay is , @xmath252 where we have used the fact that in the present case , assuming a dominant coupling constant @xmath58 , @xmath253 .",
    "the factors @xmath254 in the denominator account for the number of families . for the intermediate case , @xmath255 ( case 3 )",

    "the approximate equality in eq.([eqap4 ] ) derives from the fact that @xmath258 , based on the expectation that an rpv 3-body decay should be much smaller than an rpc 2-body decay .",
    "an analogous argument to that of case 3 holds for the other intermediate case , @xmath259 ( case 4 ) . for the cases 2 , 3 and 4 , the multiplicity factors are the same as for the case 1 .",
    "the @xmath174 process may occur at the end stage in the decays of @xmath173 , @xmath16 and @xmath260 to be discussed below .",
    "the associated @xmath174 decay multiplicity factors for the two leptons final states will then take the same values as quoted above for the various selection criteria . in quoting numerical results below",

    "this two - body decay competes with the other two - body decay e , @xmath265 , when the latter is kinematically allowed , as is the case for @xmath266 in figure [ br1](d ) .",
    "the difference between the values of the branching ratios c(7 ) and e is explained by the relative phase space factors of the associated rates .",
    "the rpv direct decays ( a and b ) are three - body decays with small coupling constant and are thus suppressed . in the case ,",
    "@xmath267 , the only open channel for the sneutrino is , @xmath268 , so that the dominant mode for the chargino decay is the rpv decay b(4 ) ( high values of @xmath164 in figure [ br1](b ) ) . even for @xmath269 , the channel b(4 ) is competitive due to a small phase space ( @xmath270 in figure [ br1](a ) ) . in this case , for @xmath271 , the direct rpv decay b(4 ) can become dominant ( moderate negative values of @xmath13 in figure [ br1](c ) ) . for small values of @xmath164 , the difference between the two dominant leptonic ( c ) and hadronic ( d ) cascade decays is due to the flavor and color factors .",
    "we note also that in a small interval of @xmath13 near @xmath183 , @xmath272 ( see figure [ spec ] ) , and consequently the only open channels are the direct rpv decays ( figure [ br1](a)(c)(d ) ) . in this region ,",
    "the direct rpv decay a(1 ) is negligible because the branching ratio depends on @xmath273 which is small @xcite . in conclusion ,",
    "the highest branching ratios are associated with the cascade decays , c , d and e , except for the case in which the sneutrino is the lsp , where they are associated with the rpv decays b. the range of @xmath13 for which the chargino @xmath173 is the lsp is excluded by the experimental constraints on the inos masses ( see figure [ spec ] ) .",
    "we turn now our attention to the sneutrino decays . for high values of @xmath13 ,",
    "the cascade decay d has the highest probability ( figure [ br2](a)(d ) ) since the decay into chargino is either kinematically forbidden or suppressed by a small phase space . as for the chargino study , the rpv direct decay a is of course small except when the competitive channel is reduced by a small phase space factor ( @xmath274 in figure [ br2](a ) ) .",

    ". however , they have the highest probability if , @xmath278 ( figure [ br2](a)(c)(d ) ) .",
    "the relation between the leptonic ( e ) and hadronic ( f ) cascade decays can be explained in the light of the study on the chargino .",
    "we conclude that the cascade decays , b , d , e and f , are always the dominant modes , except when the sneutrino is the lsp .      finally , we concentrate on slepton decays . for high values of @xmath13 ,",
    "the cascade decays via charginos are reduced because of a small phase space ( @xmath279 in figure [ br3](b ) or for @xmath190 in figures [ br3](c)(d ) ) or even closed ( for @xmath190 in figure [ br3](a ) ) . in these cases ,",
    "the decay d via neutralinos dominates .",
    "elsewhere , the decays via charginos have higher branching ratios ( for @xmath192 in figures [ br3](a)(d ) ) since larger coupling constants are involved . in the higgsino limit , the slepton cascade decay d via @xmath77",
    "is suppressed for the same reason as in the sneutrino study .",
    "the decay via @xmath280 is then dominating .",
    "the interpretation of the difference between the decays , b , c , e and f , via charginos is based on the specific behaviours of the chargino branching ratios which have already been described above .",
    "we see in figure [ br3](c ) , that for @xmath271 , the rpv direct decay a is still very reduced .",
    "this is due to the important phase space for the slepton decay into neutralino .",
    "lastly , a new phenomenon appears for the slepton case . in the higgsino limit ( @xmath276 ) at large @xmath123 , the matrix element @xmath281 which forces the vertex @xmath282 ( see eq.[eqpr6 ] in appendix [ secappa ] ) and",
    "the branching ratios for the cascade decays through the chargino to vanish @xcite .",
    "this is the explanation of the fact that for @xmath283 , one observes a peak of the direct rpv decay branching fraction ( figure [ br3](b ) ) .",
    "similar peaks are also observed at shifted @xmath284 for the low @xmath123 cases ( figures [ br3](a)(c)(d ) ) .",
    "however this behaviour appears for ranges of the parameters which are forbidden by the bounds on the inos masses ( figure [ spec ] ) .",
    "the conclusion is that the cascade decays have always the highest probability for the reason that the l - chirality slepton can not be the lsp in generic supergravity models .      in summary",
    ", we have learned that the general behaviour of branching ratios is mainly determinated by the phase space and thus by the ordering of the supersymmetric particles masses .",
    "we have explored all the characteristic cases , @xmath285 , @xmath286 and @xmath287 . for high values of @xmath288 lying above @xmath168",
    ", the sleptons would have masses greater than the inos masses .",
    "we have not analysed this case since one has then the same situation in the mass ordering as for the case of small values of @xmath164 ( except for large enough values of @xmath8 where the on - shell @xmath289 production can take place in @xmath16 and @xmath15 decays g ) . in this situation , as we have explained above , the charginos principally decay into neutralinos , while the sleptons and sneutrinos decay into charginos .",
    "the main conclusion is that the cascade decays are the dominant modes except if the sneutrino is the lsp . in this case",
    ", the rpv decay , @xmath290 , is dominant for the chargino decays , and the only open channel for the sneutrino is of course the direct rpv decay . besides , for values of @xmath58 higher than @xmath10 , the rpv direct decay branching ratios can reach significant levels for the case where the cascade decays are suppressed due to small phase space factors .",
    "the excitation of the second neutralino @xmath291 deserves some attention since this may have in certain regions of the parameter space comparable , if not larger , production rates than the excitation of @xmath174 . assuming that the direct rpv widths are small enough so that the decay chain is initiated by the rpc contributions , then the desintegration mode , @xmath292 ,",
    "will also yield 2l+@xmath293 and 4l+@xmath293 final states , respectively , and the other desintegration modes , @xmath294 , will yield 2l+@xmath293 and 4l+@xmath293 final states according to decay schemes similar to those given in tables [ tabloa],[tablob],[tabloc ] . in our supergravity models ,",
    "the @xmath169 decay into @xmath295 should be suppressed by a small phase space ( fig.[spec ] ) . to determine which of the decay modes",
    ", @xmath296 or @xmath297 , leads to the dominant signal would require a detailed comparison of at the initial as well as the subsequent stages .",
    "let us ask in what way would alternate hypotheses on the family dependence affect our conclusions . especially regarding the multiplicities of final states ,",
    "this is relevant for the cases , @xmath298 , where the chargino can cascade decay to on - shell sleptons or sneutrinos ( a(2 ) and b(4 ) in table [ tabloc ] ) .",
    "as we have emphasized in the last paragraph of section [ sectiond ] , the chargino decays have a multiplicity of 2 for three degenerate families of sleptons . for the case of two",
    "degenerate families , labeled by the indices , @xmath299 , assuming a dominant rpv coupling constant @xmath58 , the multiplicity equals 2 for @xmath300 , since the two sleptons from families @xmath101 and @xmath102 can be produced on - shell , and equals 1 for @xmath301 or @xmath302 . for the physically interesting case of a single low mass family , labeled by the index , @xmath303",
    ", one finds that the multiplicity equals 1 for @xmath304 and 0 otherwise .",
    "the conclusion is that the rpv contributions a and b ( in table [ tabloc ] ) to the chargino branching ratios increase as the number of slepton families , which are lower in mass than the chargino , becomes higher .",
    "this effect , which is quite small , would affect the branching ratios in parameters regions for which the rpv contributions a and b are not weak , that is for @xmath190 in figures [ br1](a)(b)(c ) .    in figure [ bratewsb ] , we present results for the branching fractions for fixed @xmath8 in the infrared fixed point model with electroweak symmetry breaking . in this constrained version , where @xmath9 varies with @xmath13 ,",
    "the dependence on @xmath13 is rather similar to that of the non minimal model where we worked instead with fixed @xmath8 and @xmath9 .",
    "however , as we see from the mass spectrum , here the lsp is the neutralino @xmath174 for all the physical ranges of the parameters . due to the large mass difference between the @xmath174 lsp and the nlsp ( next to lsp ) , the cascade decays are the only dominant modes and the branching ratios for the rpv direct decays are very weak .",
    "let us add a few qualitative remarks on the predictions of gauge mediated breaking models .",
    "in order for the production rates in the minimal model @xcite to have the same order of magnitude as those obtained in the supergravity model of section [ sectionr ] , one needs a parameter @xmath305 , using familiar notations for the breaking scale ( @xmath306 ) and messenger scale ( @xmath307 ) . concerning the signals , by comparing the mean free paths for @xmath77 ( favourite candidate for lsp ) in both models ,",
    "one finds that the decay channel to the gravitino , @xmath308 , becomes competitive with the rpv decay channel , @xmath309 , for , @xmath310 .",
    "let us also comment briefly on some of the experimental issues .",
    "a given final state can possibly arise simultaneously from several of the single production processes .",
    "the important 4l+@xmath60 signal which occurs for @xmath311 productions is one such example where one may be forced to add all three types of cross sections in comparing with some given experimental data sample .",
    "similarly , for most signals , one must typically add the contributions from the two charge conjugate partner processes .",
    "concerning the competition with the standard model background , one expects that the most important contributions to the final states , 2l+@xmath60 and 4l , will arise from the reactions , @xmath312 . in spite of the large standard model rates of",
    "order one picobarn at @xmath313 @xcite , one should be able to distinguish the single production signals by exploiting their specific non diagonal flavor character ( final state b in table [ tablob ] and a in table [ tabloa ] ) .",
    "the other multileptons final states , generated by the cascade decays , 4l+@xmath60 , 4l+@xmath19 , 3l+@xmath19+@xmath289+@xmath60 , ... have a standard model background which is negligible .",
    "the potentially large two photons background processes , induced by @xmath314 photons pairs radiated by the initial leptons , can be significantly reduced by imposing suitable cuts on the leptons transverse momenta .",
    "finally , we note that the selection by the rpv single production of identical helicities for the initial state , @xmath315 , can be exploited to discriminate against the minimal supersymetric standard model and also the standard model , for which the identical helicities configuration only appears with the t - channel z - boson exchange .",
    "the distributions of rates with respect to kinematical variables associated with the final states offer helpful means to characterize the underlying production processes . as an indicative study we shall present here some characteristic dynamical distributions obtained for the production reactions , @xmath316 , from a monte carlo events simulation for which we have used the event generator susygen @xcite .",
    "we concentrate on the final state signals of 2l+@xmath60 , 4l and 4l+@xmath60 .",
    "note that for high values of @xmath13 , the final state 4l+@xmath60 is the dominant mode for the chargino , slepton and sneutrino decays .",
    "this signal also receives contributions from the reactions , @xmath317 , which however are not included in the simulation .",
    "the standard model background is expected to be small for the 4l+@xmath60 signal .",
    "the main background from the minimal supersymmetric standard model interactions arises from the neutralino rpc pair production , @xmath318 . following the analysis in @xcite",
    ", we consider an incident energy of @xmath319 and use a non minimal supergravity model for which we choose the set of parameters , @xmath320 , which yields the spectrum , @xmath321 .",
    "the integrated rates ( ignoring acceptance cuts ) are , for @xmath322 $ ] , @xmath323 and @xmath324 .",
    "we consider the following five dynamical variables for all types of final states : invariant missing energy , @xmath325 where the sum is over the neutrinos , as appropriate to a broken r parity situation ; average per event of the @xmath326 lepton transverse momentum , @xmath327 , where @xmath328 is the number of muons ; angle between the momenta of same electric charge sign ( ss ) muons pairs ; average per event of the summed transverse momenta for leptons pairs of same sign ( ss ) or opposite sign ( os ) , @xmath329 , where @xmath330 is the number of configurations and @xmath331 .",
    "we have generated the inos single production and the @xmath77 pair production in separate samples of 5000 events each .",
    "our choice of using equal number of events for both reactions has been made on the basis of the following three somewhat qualitative considerations , none of which is compelling .",
    "first , the single production reactions occur in company of their charge conjugate partners , which multiplies rates by a factor 2 .",
    "second , the other @xmath15 and @xmath16 single production reactions , which have not been included , would be expected to add contributions of similar size to the leptonic distributions .",
    "third , assuming for the rpv coupling constant the alternative bound , @xmath332 , there would result a relative enhancement for single production over pair production by a factor , @xmath333 .",
    "the above three points motivate our rough guess that the number of events chosen for the five single production processes ( together with their charge conjugate partners ) should be of comparable size to that of the @xmath77 pair production process .",
    "the results are shown in figure [ mc ] .",
    "the single production reactions present certain clear characteristic features : concentration of missing energy @xmath334 at low energies ; pronounced peaks in the muon transverse momentum @xmath335 and in the angular distribution for the same sign muons pairs ; and a double peak in the transverse momentum distribution for the opposite sign leptons pairs , @xmath336 .",
    "the large transverse momentum components present in the single production distributions in @xmath336 and in @xmath335 are explained by the fact that one of the two leptons ( namely , @xmath337 ) is created at the production stage .",
    "similarly , the existence of a strong angular correlation between same sign muons pairs is interpreted naturally by the momentum conservation balance between the lepton @xmath337 produced in the initial stage and the other lepton produced at the decay stage .",
    "although there are certain distinguishing properties between the single and pair production processes , the discrimination between the two may depend crucially on the relative sizes of the associated event samples .",
    "of course , the best possible situation would be for an energetically forbidden neutralino pair production .    finally , we comment on the effect of eventually excluding the @xmath169 single production component . in that case ,",
    "most of the signals for single production would become less diluted in comparison with neutralino pair production , the large missing energy signal would be removed while the large os lepton pair @xmath336 signal would become amplified .",
    "we have analysed the full set of @xmath2 single production processes at leptonic colliders induced by the rpv interactions @xmath338 , within a supergravity model .",
    "although our approximate study has obvious limitations ( factorisation and narrow resonance approximation , neglect of the spin correlations and omission of acceptance cuts ) , it uncovers the general trends of all the 5 single production reactions . over the whole parameter space , for an rpv coupling constant @xmath44 of order @xmath10 , the integrated rates are of comparable order of magnitudes although @xmath339 and @xmath15 are typically larger by factors of 2 compared to @xmath16 production and by factors of 5 compared to @xmath174 production .",
    "the detectability for each single production separately is modest at lepii but comfortable at nlc , corresponding to a few events and a few thousands of events per year , respectively .",
    "a wide region of the parameter space can be probed at @xmath340 . in spite of the rich variety of final states ,",
    "the dominant signals arise from the single or double rpc induced cascade decays to the lsp , which are also favored by phase space arguments . for the minimal supergravity model , assuming electroweak symmetry breaking , large mass differences occur between the scalar superpartners and the @xmath174 lsp , leading to dominant cascade decays modes with weak competitivity from the rpv direct decays .",
    "the signals , 4l+@xmath60,6l,6l+@xmath60 , arising from cascade decays are free from standard model background which make them quite interesting signatures for the discovery of supersymmetry and r parity violation .",
    "even the 4l signal arising from direct rpv decays could be observable due to a characteristic non diagonal flavor configuration .",
    "for center of mass energies well above all the thresholds , the 4l+@xmath60 signal receives contributions from all five single production processes and hence should be strongly amplified .",
    "we have presented some dynamical distributions for the final states which could characterise the single production reactions .",
