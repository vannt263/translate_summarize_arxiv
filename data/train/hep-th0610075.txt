    "black holes in higher dimensions received much interest in recent years , in particular in the context of string theory , and with the advent of brane - world theories , raising the possibility of direct observation in future high energy colliders @xcite .    while the generalization of the kerr metric to higher dimensions was obtained long ago @xcite , the higher dimensional generalization of the kerr - newman solutions of einstein - maxwell ( em ) theory is still not known analytically @xcite .",
    "em black holes in @xmath5 dimensions are characterized by their mass @xmath6 , charge @xmath7 , and @xmath8 $ ] angular momenta @xmath9 , their number corresponding to the rank of the rotation group so(d-1 ) @xcite .",
    "their event horizon has surface gravity @xmath10 and @xmath11-volume @xmath12 , electrostatic potential @xmath13 and @xmath8 $ ] angular velocities @xmath14 .",
    "these black holes satisfy the smarr formula @xcite @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the @xmath5-dimensional newton constant , and the first law of black hole mechanics @xcite , @xmath17    in odd dimensions , @xmath18 , the em action may be supplemented by a ` @xmath19 ' chern - simons ( cs ) term . while not affecting the static black hole solutions , this term significantly affects the properties of stationary black hole solutions @xcite , as discussed in this review .",
    "the cs term also yields a modified smarr formula , where eq .",
    "( [ smarr ] ) is supplemented by a further term , proportional to the cs coefficient @xmath0 and to the factor @xmath20 @xcite .",
    "thus @xmath21 is a rather special case among the class of odd - dimensional einstein - maxwell - chern - simons ( emcs ) theories , since the smarr formula eq .",
    "( [ smarr ] ) remains unmodified .",
    "the bosonic sector of minimal @xmath21 supergravity may be viewed as a special case of the general emcs theory with lagrangian @xmath22 \\ , \\label{lag}\\ ] ] and cs coefficient @xmath0 , where @xmath0 assumes the supergravity value @xmath1 . when @xmath3 , analytic solutions describing charged , rotating black holes are known @xcite .",
    "in contrast , for @xmath23 charged rotating black hole solutions are known only numerically @xcite .",
    "the extremal limits of rotating charged black hole solutions of @xmath21 emcs theory with @xmath3 are of special interest , since they encompass a two parameter family of stationary supersymmetric black holes @xcite .",
    "the mass of these supersymmetric black holes is determined in terms of their charge and saturates the bound @xcite @xmath24 while their two equal - magnitude angular momenta , @xmath25 , are finite and satisfy the bound @xcite @xmath26 in units for which @xmath27 .",
    "their horizon angular velocities @xmath28 , however , vanish .",
    "thus their horizon is non - rotating , although their angular momentum is nonzero .",
    "clearly , angular momentum is stored in the maxwell field , but surprisingly , a negative fraction of the total angular momentum is stored behind the horizon @xcite .",
    "the effect of rotation on the horizon is not to make it rotate but to deform it into a squashed 3-sphere @xcite .    these special properties of @xmath21 supersymmetric emcs black holes caused speculations on how the properties of @xmath21 black holes in general emcs theories depend on the cs coefficient @xcite , involving instability and counterrotation of black holes beyond @xmath3 .",
    "both these features turned out to be true @xcite .",
    "moreover further intriguing features appeared at and beyond the second critical value @xmath2 , involving non - uniqueness of black holes , the appearance of non - static black holes with vanishing total angular momentum , as well as the presence of black holes with negative horizon mass .",
    "to obtain stationary emcs black hole solutions , we consider black hole space - times with bi - azimuthal symmetry , implying the existence of three commuting killing vectors , @xmath30 , @xmath31 , and @xmath32 @xcite .",
    "while generic emcs black holes possess two independent angular momenta , we here restrict to black holes whose angular momenta have equal magnitude .",
    "the metric and the gauge field parametrization then simplify .",
    "in particular , for such equal - magnitude angular momenta black holes , the general einstein and gauge field equations reduce to a set of ordinary differential equations @xcite , since the angular dependence can be treated explicitly .",
    "we employ a parametrization for the metric based on bi - azimuthal isotropic coordinates , well suited for the numerical construction @xcite @xmath33            \\ , \\label{metric } \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath34 , @xmath35 , denotes the sense of rotation in the @xmath36-th orthogonal plane of rotation .",
    "the parametrization for the gauge potential , consistent with eq .",
    "( [ metric ] ) , is @xmath37 all metric and gauge field functions depend on @xmath38 only .",
    "at infinity we impose on the metric the boundary conditions @xmath39 , @xmath40 , i.e. , the solutions are asymptotically flat . for the gauge potential",
    "we choose a gauge , where @xmath41 .",
    "the regular event horizon resides at a surface of constant radial coordinate , @xmath42 @xcite , and is characterized by the condition @xmath43 @xcite . here",
    "the metric functions satisfy the boundary conditions @xmath44 , @xmath45 , where @xmath46 is ( related to ) the horizon angular velocity , defined in terms of the killing vector @xmath47 which is null at the horizon .",
    "the gauge potential satisfies @xmath48 , @xmath49 , with constant horizon electrostatic potential @xmath13 .      since the space - times we are considering are stationary , bi - axisymmetric , and asymptotically flat we may compute the mass @xmath6 and the two angular momenta @xmath50 of the black holes by means of the komar expressions associated with the respective killing vector fields @xmath51 with @xmath52 , @xmath53 , and for equal - magnitude angular momenta @xmath54 , @xmath55 , 2 .",
    "the electric charge @xmath7 associated with the maxwell field can be defined by @xmath56 with @xmath57 .",
    "these global charges and the magnetic moment @xmath58 , can be obtained from the asymptotic expansions of the metric and the gauge potential @xmath59 the gyromagnetic ratio @xmath60 is then defined via @xmath61      the expansion at the horizon shows , that the surface gravity @xmath10 @xmath62 is constant at the horizon , as required by the zeroth law of black hole mechanics , and that the electrostatic potential @xmath13 is constant at the horizon as well .",
    "for equal - magnitude angular momenta , the area of the horizon @xmath12 reduces to @xmath63 to have a measure for the deformation of the horizon we consider the circumferences of the horizon , the polar circumference @xmath64 , where @xmath65 and @xmath66 are kept constant , and the equatorial circumference , @xmath67 , where @xmath68 and @xmath65 is kept constant ( or equivalently @xmath69 and @xmath66 is kept constant ) .",
    "the horizon mass @xmath70 and horizon angular momenta @xmath71 are given by @xmath72 where @xmath73 represents the surface of the horizon , and for equal - magnitude angular momenta @xmath74 , @xmath55 , 2 .",
    "the mass @xmath6 and angular momenta @xmath50 may thus be reexpressed in the form @xcite @xmath75 where @xmath76 is a ` bulk ' integral over the region of @xmath77 outside the horizon , i.e. , @xmath77 is a space - like hypersurface with boundaries at spatial infinity and at the horizon .",
    "these black holes satisfy the horizon mass formula @xmath78 and the smarr formula @xcite @xmath79      the system of odes is invariant under the scaling tranformation @xmath80 with @xmath81 .",
    "the cs coupling constant is dimensionful and scales according to @xmath82 . ]",
    "the solutions then have the scaling symmetry @xmath83 , @xmath84 , @xmath85 , @xmath86 , @xmath87 , @xmath88 , etc .    we also note , that @xmath89 corresponds to @xmath90",
    ". then , without loss of generality we will assume @xmath91 hereafter .",
    "for the numerical calculations , we introduce the compactified radial variable @xmath92 @xcite . we employ a collocation method for boundary - value ordinary differential equations , equipped with an adaptive mesh selection procedure @xcite .",
    "typical mesh sizes include @xmath93 points .",
    "the solutions have a relative accuracy of @xmath94 .",
    "the set of numerical parameters to be fixed for a particular solution is @xmath95 . by varying these parameters we generate families of emcs black holes .",
    "let us first consider the dependence of the domain of existence of emcs black holes on the cs parameter @xmath0 . in fig",
    ".  1 we exhibit the scaled angular momentum @xmath96 of extremal emcs black holes versus the scaled charge @xmath97 for several values of @xmath0 : the pure em case , @xmath98 , the supergravity case , @xmath3 , @xmath99 , the second critical case , @xmath2 , and @xmath100 . for a given value of @xmath0 ,",
    "black holes exist only in the regions bounded by the @xmath101-axis and by the respective solid curves , which are formed by extremal black holes .    for fixed finite @xmath0",
    ", there is an explicit asymmetry between solutions with positive and negative electric charge .",
    "the properties of emcs black holes with positive @xmath7 are similar to those of em black holes , whereas for emcs black holes with negative @xmath7 surprising features are present .    as long as @xmath102",
    "the boundary is smooth , but asymmetrical , unless @xmath0 vanishes . as @xmath0 approaches the supergravity value @xmath3 , the boundary develops a kink , which turns into a singular point , when @xmath3 . in the supergravity case",
    "the boundary then consists of two parts : a smooth curve and a straight vertical line , where both parts join at the singular point .    when @xmath103 , the static extremal black holes continue to reside at the lower left edge of the boundary of the domain of existence .",
    "but beyond the second critical value , @xmath2 , they are located well within the domain of existence .",
    "( recall that the static black holes are independent of @xmath0 . )",
    "the staticity theorem of em theory claims , that stationary non - rotating black holes ( i.e. , black holes with vanishing horizon angular velocity ) are static @xcite .",
    "emcs black holes , in contrast , may possess a static horizon , while their total angular momentum is non - vanishing @xcite .",
    "not present below @xmath3 , these black holes arise in emcs theory at the critical value @xmath4 , where they constitute the left vertical boundary of the domain of existence .",
    "these @xmath3 solutions are very special , since they represent _ supersymmetric _ charged rotating black holes , where supersymmetry implies that the horizon must be non - rotating . since @xmath104 ,",
    "these solutions possess no ergoregion .",
    "these supersymmetric black holes saturate the mass bound eq .",
    "( [ m - bound ] ) , and they satisfy the angular momentum bound eq .",
    "( [ j - bound ] ) .",
    "thus while angular momentum is built up , the mass remains constant ( for constant charge ) , in accordance with the first law , since @xmath105 .    as the total angular momentum is increased from its static limiting value @xmath101 , angular momentum",
    "is built up in the maxwell field behind and outside the horizon , as seen in fig .",
    "2a , where the total angular momentum @xmath106 and the horizon angular momentum @xmath107 are exhibited .",
    "in particular , a negative fraction of the total angular momentum is stored in the maxwell field behind the horizon @xcite .",
    "thus , while one expects frame dragging effects to cause the horizon to rotate , these effects are precisely counterbalanced by frame dragging effects , due to the negative contribution to the angular momentum by the fields behind the horizon , allowing these black holes to retain a static horizon @xcite .",
    "all these supersymmetric black holes possess a regular horizon , except for the limiting solution , saturating the bound eq .",
    "( [ j - bound ] ) .",
    "the area @xmath12 of the horizon decreases as @xmath108 increases towards the bound eq .",
    "( [ j - bound ] ) , yielding a singular limiting solution with vanishing horizon area , @xmath109 .",
    "the effect of the rotation on the horizon is not to make it rotate , but to deform it from a round 3-sphere to a squashed 3-sphere as seen in fig .",
    "2b @xcite .    along the non - supersymmetric branch @xmath106 and",
    "@xmath107 have equal signs .",
    "below @xmath3 the only @xmath104 solutions are static black holes . at @xmath3 ,",
    "the supersymmetric black holes form a continuous set of non - static extremal @xmath104 solutions .",
    "as @xmath0 is increased beyond its supergravity value , the set of @xmath104 solutions becomes non - extremal , except for its extremal endpoint(s ) .",
    "the location of such sets of @xmath104 black holes within their respective domain of existence is indicated in fig .  1 for several values of the cs coupling constant @xmath110 .",
    "extremal static emcs black holes saturate the mass bound eq .",
    "( [ m - bound ] ) for any value of @xmath0 . for stationary emcs",
    "black holes demonstration of the bound eq .",
    "( [ m - bound ] ) relied on the fact that @xmath3 @xcite . while the mass bound eq .",
    "( [ m - bound ] ) is respected by stationary black holes as long as @xmath102 , it is violated , when @xmath110 , as seen in fig .  1 .",
    "as speculated before @xcite , the mass can indeed decrease with increasing angular momentum for fixed @xmath110 .",
    "thus while an extremal static black hole with zero hawking temperature and spherical symmetry can not decrease its mass by hawking radiation , it can however become unstable with respect to rotation , when @xmath110 , with photons carrying away both energy and angular momentum to infinity . in terms of the first law as applied to @xmath110 extremal black holes ( @xmath111 ) with fixed charge ( @xmath112 ) , such an instability then requires , that the horizon is rotating in the opposite sense to the angular momentum , since @xmath113 must be negative .    in fig .",
    "3a we demonstrate explicitly , that extremal static black holes can become unstable with respect to rotation , by exhibiting the deviation of the mass from the static value , computed via the second - order derivative of the mass with respect to the angular momentum at the extremal static solution .",
    "for @xmath114 the mass is seen to decrease with increasing magnitude of the angular momentum for fixed electric charge , as attributed to the presence of counterrotating solutions , connected to the extremal static solution .",
    "thus supersymmetry marks indeed the borderline between stability and instability .",
    "responsible for the onset of instability , counterrotating black holes appear beyond the critical value @xmath3 . for a given value of @xmath0 ,",
    "the ( main ) set of rotating @xmath104 black holes ( extending from a static solution to the corresponding extremal singular solution ) then divides the domain of existence into two parts , as seen in fig .  1 .",
    "the right part contains ordinary black holes , where the horizon rotates in the same sense as the angular momentum , whereas the left part ( the shaded region in fig .",
    "1a ) contains black holes with unusual properties .",
    "when @xmath115 , all black holes in this region are counterrotating , i.e. , their horizon rotates in the opposite sense to the angular momentum @xcite .",
    "when @xmath116 black holes with further intriguing features appear .      as expected from the change in stability , another special case is reached , when @xmath2 .",
    "indeed , as @xmath0 reaches @xmath117 , another new phenomenon arises : a ( continuous ) set of rotating @xmath101 solutions appears and persists as @xmath0 is increased beyond @xmath117 @xcite .",
    "the existence of these rotating @xmath101 solutions relies on a special partition of the total angular momentum @xmath106 , where the angular momentum within the horizon @xmath107 is precisely equal and opposite to the angular momentum in the maxwell field outside the horizon .",
    "in contrast , for @xmath118 only static @xmath101 solutions exist .",
    "the presence of @xmath101 solutions is seen in figs .",
    "3b and 4a for @xmath100 .    related to the @xmath101 solutions , the domain of existence of emcs black holes changes character , and extremal rotating @xmath101 solutions",
    "replace extremal static solutions as the left edge of the boundary on the @xmath101 axis , when @xmath119 .",
    "thus beyond @xmath2 the set of extremal solutions not only forms the boundary of the domain of existence , but continues well within this domain , until the static extremal black hole is reached in a complicated pattern of bifurcating branches .",
    "insight into this set is gained in fig .",
    "3b , where ( almost ) extremal solutions are exhibited for cs coefficient @xmath100 , together with non - static @xmath104 solutions .",
    "note , that all this new structure arises well within the counterrotating region , in the vicinity of the static extremal black holes .",
    "with increasing @xmath0 an increasing number of such extremal rotating @xmath101 black holes appears , and with them an increasing number of extremal @xmath120 solutions with non - rotating horizon , each forming the end point of a whole set of ( non - extremal ) @xmath104 , @xmath120 black holes .",
    "indeed , these sets of @xmath104 solutions always appear in pairs , connecting a static solution with an extremal solution , whose mass assumes an extremal value as well , in accordance with the first law .",
    "the numerical data further indicate , that at the critical value @xmath2 a ( continuous ) set of extremal rotating @xmath101 black holes with constant mass is present .",
    "this is illustrated in fig .",
    "4b . as the horizon angular velocity @xmath121 increases ,",
    "their mass @xmath6 can remain constant , as long as @xmath101 , and the angular momentum is redistributed appropriately ( as indicated by the steep rise of @xmath107 in fig .",
    "for these black holes , the deformation is oblate .",
    "4a further reveals that beyond @xmath2 black holes are no longer uniquely characterized by their global charges .",
    "thus the uniqueness conjecture does not hold for @xmath21 emcs stationary black holes with horizons of spherical topology , provided @xmath119 . for @xmath2 even an infinite set of extremal black holes with the same global charges appears to exist , as numerical data indicate ( see fig .",
    "4b ) .      to explore the properties of @xmath119 emcs black holes further ,",
    "let us now consider non - extremal black holes .",
    "we exhibit in fig .  5 a set of solutions for @xmath100 , possessing constant charge @xmath122 and constant ( isotropic ) horizon radius @xmath123 .",
    "5a and 5b show the total angular momentum @xmath106 and the horizon angular momentum @xmath107 , respectively , as functions of the horizon angular velocity @xmath121 , fig .",
    "5c and 5d show the corresponding masses @xmath6 and @xmath70 , and fig .",
    "5e and 5f the gyromagnetic ratio @xmath60 and the deformation of the horizon as measured by the ratio of equatorial and polar circumferences @xmath124 .",
    "5a exhibits the four types of rotating black holes , as classified by their total angular momentum @xmath106 and horizon angular velocity @xmath121 : type i black holes correspond to the corotating regime , i.e. , @xmath125 , and @xmath104 if and only if @xmath101 ( static ) .",
    "type ii black holes possess a static horizon ( @xmath104 ) , although their angular momentum does not vanish ( @xmath126 ) .",
    "type iii black holes are characterized by counterrotation , i.e. , the horizon angular velocity and the total angular momentum have oposite signs , @xmath127 .",
    "type iv black holes , finally , possess a rotating horizon ( @xmath128 ) but vanishing total angular momentum ( @xmath101 ) .      as seen in fig .  5b ,",
    "the horizon angular momentum @xmath107 of these black holes need not have the same sign as the total angular momentum @xmath106 , and neither does the ` bulk ' angular momentum @xmath129 . as the horizon of the black hole",
    "is set into rotation , angular momentum is stored in the maxwell field both behind and outside the horizon , yielding a rich variety of configurations .",
    "starting from the static solution , a corotating branch evolves , along which @xmath107 and @xmath130 have opposite signs .",
    "after the first bifurcation @xmath121 moves back towards zero and so does @xmath106 , but both @xmath107 and @xmath130 remain finite , retaining part of their built up angular momentum and thus their memory of the path , like in a hysteresis .",
    "this is important , since when moving @xmath121 continuously back to and beyond zero , the total angular momentum follows and changes sign as well .",
    "the horizon angular momentum , however , retains its sign .",
    "thus the product @xmath131 turns negative and remains negative up to the next bifurcation and still further , until @xmath121 reaches again zero .",
    "the presence of @xmath132 solutions explains the occurrence of black holes with negative horizon mass , @xmath133 , which are exhibited in fig .",
    "the correlation between @xmath132 and @xmath133 black holes is evident here .",
    "in fact , the sets of @xmath132 and @xmath133 black holes almost coincide , when @xmath134 is small , as seen from the horizon mass formula eq .",
    "( [ hor_mass_form ] ) .",
    "the angular momentum stored in the maxwell field behind the horizon is thus responsible for the negative horizon mass of the black holes .",
    "the total mass is always positive , however , as seen in fig .",
    "5c .    for larger values of @xmath135 the set of negative horizon mass black holes decreases , while it increases for smaller values of @xmath135 , as seen in fig",
    "in fact , as @xmath135 decreases , more branches of solutions appear in the vicinity of the static solution , giving rise to more branches of negative horizon mass black holes .",
    "another interesting feature of these charged rotating emcs black holes is their gyromagnetic ratio @xmath60 , exhibited in fig .",
    "when @xmath136 , the gyromagnetic ratio is unbounded , reaching any real value including zero .",
    "the main consequence of this is that , contrary to pure em theory , a vanishing total angular momentum does not readily imply a vanishing magnetic moment and viceversa .",
    "the gyromagnetic ratio is thus another indicator of the particularity of @xmath137 , as also seen in fig .",
    "stationary black holes of em theory in 4 dimensions now appear to be very special , since their familiar properties are not shared in general by black holes in higher dimensions or by black holes in the presence of more or different fields .      charged rotating black holes of emcs theory in five dimensions , which are asymptotically flat with a regular horizon of spherical topology , can exhibit remarkable features . classifying",
    "the emcs black holes by their total angular momentum @xmath106 and horizon angular velocity @xmath121 , four types of black holes arise : i. corotating black holes , i.e. , @xmath125 , for all values of @xmath0 , ii .",
    "black holes with static horizon and non - vanishing total angular momentum , i.e. ,",
    "@xmath104 , @xmath126 , for @xmath138 , iii . counterrotating black holes , where the horizon angular velocity and the total angular momentum have opposite signs , i.e. , @xmath127 , for @xmath139 , and iv .",
    "black holes with rotating horizon and vanishing total angular momentum , i.e. , @xmath140 , @xmath101 , for @xmath116 .    as the horizon of static emcs black holes is set into rotation , angular momentum",
    "is stored in the maxwell field both behind and outside the horizon .",
    "following paths through configuration space , the horizon angular momentum @xmath107 and the ` bulk ' angular momentum @xmath130 can retain part of the angular momentum built up in the maxwell field , even when the horizon angular velocity vanishes again .",
    "thus they retain the memory of the path , like a hysteresis .",
    "consequently , solutions with @xmath132 appear , which possess a negative horizon mass @xmath133 , as long as @xmath134 is sufficiently small .",
    "thus the angular momentum stored in the maxwell field behind the horizon is responsible for the negative horizon mass of these black holes .",
    "their total mass is positive , however .",
    "black holes surrounded by perfect fluid rings @xcite . ]",
    "moreover , these emcs black holes are no longer uniquely characterized by their global charges , i.e. , the uniqueness conjecture does not hold in general for stationary black holes with horizons of spherical topology ; and their gyromagnetic ratio may take any real value , including zero .",
    "a number of features of @xmath21 emcs black holes appear also for @xmath141 emd black holes , with dilaton coupling constant @xmath142 , when both electric ( @xmath7 ) and magnetic ( @xmath143 ) charge are present @xcite .",
    "in emd theory the kaluza - klein value @xmath144 represents the ( first ) critical value . for @xmath145",
    "only corotating black holes exist . for @xmath144 stationary black holes with non - rotating horizon appear and form the vertical part of the boundary @xcite .",
    "their angular momentum is bounded by @xmath146 ( analogous to eq .",
    "( [ j - bound ] ) ) . for @xmath147 corotating and",
    "counterrotating black holes exist @xcite .",
    "thus in emd theory the kaluza - klein value @xmath144 marks the change from stability to instability .",
    "stationary @xmath104 black holes and counterrotating black holes also exhibit squashed horizons @xcite .",
    "whether also @xmath101 , @xmath148 solutions are present , whether uniqueness is violated , or whether negative horizon mass black holes are present remains to be investigated .",
    "all these intriguing new types of stationary @xmath29 emcs black holes occur also for emcs black holes in higher odd dimensions @xcite .",
    "but since the cs coefficient then becomes dimensionful , it changes under scaling transformations eq .",
    "( [ scaling ] ) , unless @xmath150 .",
    "thus any feature present for a certain non - vanishing value of @xmath151 will be present for any other non - vanishing value ( although for the correspondingly scaled value of the charge ) .",
    "for that reason , the critical behaviour of the solutions can not be classified by @xmath151 alone , but only by a scale invariant ratio involving @xmath151 @xcite .",
    "interestingly , in @xmath152 , a further type of black holes appears : v. non - static @xmath153 black holes , possessing a finite magnetic moment @xcite .",
    "clearly , further surprises may be waiting in higher dimensions .",

    "<S> stationary black holes in 5-dimensional einstein - maxwell - chern - simons theory possess surprising properties . when considering the chern - simons coefficient @xmath0 as a parameter , two critical values of @xmath0 appear : the supergravity value @xmath1 , and the value @xmath2 . at @xmath3 , </S>",
    "<S> supersymmetric black holes with vanishing horizon angular velocity , but finite angular momentum exist . </S>",
    "<S> as @xmath0 increases beyond @xmath4 a rotational instability arises , and counterrotating black holes appear , whose horizon rotates in the opposite sense to the angular momentum . </S>",
