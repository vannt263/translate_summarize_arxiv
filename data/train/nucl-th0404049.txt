    "one of the fundamental problems in nuclear structure calculations is to describe nuclear properties , starting with realistic nucleon - nucleon ( nn ) interactions . however , since this kind of interaction has a repulsive core at a short distance , one has to derive an effective interaction in a model space from the realistic interaction , except for the case of precise few - nucleon structure calculations .",
    "recently , bogner _",
    "et al . _ have proposed a low - momentum nucleon - nucleon ( lmnn ) interaction which is constructed in momentum space for the two - nucleon system from a realistic nucleon - nucleon interaction , using conventional effective interaction techniques or renormalization group ones  @xcite . in the construction of the lmnn interaction a cutoff momentum @xmath0",
    "is introduced to specify a border between the low- and high - momentum spaces .",
    "the lmnn interaction is constructed in order to account for the short - range correlations of the two nucleons interacting in the vacuum .",
    "so the question is to what extent the obtained lmnn interaction is a good approximation also for describing correlation of nucleons interacting in a nuclear many - body medium .",
    "the medium effect could appear through the single - particle potential and three - or - more - body correlations . from a practical point of view",
    "it is of high interest to explore the sensitivity of calculated results to the cutoff momentum @xmath0 .",
    "et al . _ have constructed their lmnn interaction in a way to conserve in the low - momentum region not only the on - shell properties of the original interaction ( i.e. phase shifts and the deuteron binding energy ) but also the half - on - shell @xmath6 matrix  @xcite .",
    "they found that the lmnn interactions for @xmath7 @xmath4 corresponding to @xmath8",
    "mev become nearly universal , not ( or only weakly ) dependent on the choice of realistic interactions employed .",
    "they suggested to use their lmnn interaction directly in nuclear structure calculations , such as the shell - model  @xcite and the hartree - fock calculations  @xcite .",
    "they claimed that for the momentum cutoff in the vicinity of @xmath9 @xmath4 the calculated low - lying spectra for @xmath10o , @xmath11te , and @xmath12i are in good agreement with the experimental data and depend weakly on @xmath0 .",
    "their results have been found to agree with the data as good or even slightly better than the results based upon the @xmath13 matrix which is constructed by taking into account the short - range correlations , the pauli blocking effect , and the state dependence for each nucleus .",
    "kuckei _ et al . _",
    "@xcite investigated the nuclear matter and the closed - shell nucleus @xmath14o by using the lmnn interaction obtained by bogner _",
    "they concluded that the lmnn interaction can be a very useful tool for low energy nuclear structure calculations , and one should be cautious if the observable of interest is sensitive to the single - particle spectrum at energies above the cutoff momentum .",
    "however , one had better compare with the exact solutions once for all . in cases of three- and four - nucleon systems",
    "we can directly make such a comparison by solving the faddeev - yakubovsky equations  @xcite .",
    "we investigate the lmnn interaction by means of unitary transformation using two independent ( but equivalent ) approaches .",
    "one approach is based on the unitary transformation of the kubo form  @xcite in which a lmnn interaction is obtained from the scattering amplitude in momentum space  @xcite .",
    "another is the unitary - model - operator approach ( umoa )  @xcite .",
    "in contrast to the @xmath13-matrix theory the umoa leads to an energy - independent and hermitian effective interaction in a many - body system .",
    "contrary to the lmnn of ref .",
    "@xcite , we will not require conservation of the half - on - shell @xmath6 matrix , which does not represent an observable quantity .",
    "only low - momentum nn observables such as the on - shell @xmath6 matrix , phase shifts and binding energies are guaranteed to remain unchanged under an unitary transformation . in principle",
    ", one could achieve the equivalence of the half - on - shell @xmath6 matrix by performing an additional unitary transformation in the low  momentum space . we , however , refrain from doing that since we do not see any conceptual or practical advantage in requiring the equivalence of the half - on - shell @xmath6 matrix .    in the present study",
    "we first apply the above - mentioned methods to the two - nucleon system in momentum space to construct the lmnn interaction .",
    "although both approaches are based on the same idea of an unitary transformation , the calculation procedures for deriving the lmnn interaction are independent and quite different from each other .",
    "we calculate selected properties of the two - nucleon system using both schemes to confirm the numerical accuracy .",
    "this cross check is useful to ensure the reliability of the numerical calculations .",
    "secondly , we investigate the @xmath0 dependence in structure calculations of few - nucleon systems , where ( numerically ) exact calculations can be performed  @xcite , and discuss the validity of the lmnn interaction by comparing the obtained results with the @xmath15 values .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : transformation ] , after the basic formulation of the unitary transformation is presented , the two methods are given with emphasis on the different calculation procedures for deriving the lmnn interaction . in sec .  [",

    "we consider a quantum mechanical system described by a hamiltonian @xmath16 .",

    "we introduce the concept of the effective hamiltonian by means of the partition technique .",

    "@xcite .    in the present study ,",
    "the above unitary transformation is used in two different methods to derive lmnn interactions . in the following sections",
    ", we shall give details on the two methods .",
    "consider a momentum - space hamiltonian for the two - nucleon system of the form @xmath38 where @xmath39 with the reduced mass @xmath40 stands for the kinetic energy , and @xmath41 is the bare two - body interaction .",
    "our aim is to decouple the low- and high - momentum components of this two - nucleon potential using the method of unitary transformation . to achieve that",
    ", we introduce the projection operators @xmath42 where @xmath0 is a momentum cutoff whose value will be specified later , and @xmath25 ( @xmath26 ) is a projection operator onto low- ( high- ) momentum states .",
    "based on the unitary - transformation operator given in eq .",
    "( [ eq : okubo ] ) , the effective hamiltonian in the p space takes the form @xmath43 this interaction is by its very construction hermitian  @xcite .",
    "the requirement of decoupling the two spaces leads to the following nonlinear integral equation for the operator @xmath36 @xmath44 where we have denoted by @xmath45 @xmath46 a momentum of the p space ( q space ) state and by @xmath47 ( @xmath48 ) the kinetic energy @xmath49 ( @xmath50 ) .",
    "alternatively , one can determine the operator @xmath36 from the following linear equation , as exhibited in refs .",
    "@xcite : @xmath51 here the integration over @xmath52 goes from 0 to @xmath0 .",
    "consequently , the dynamical input in this method is the @xmath6 matrix @xmath53 .",
    "note that this is not a usual equation of the lippmann - schwinger ( ls ) type since the position of the pole @xmath47 in the integration over @xmath52 is not fixed but moves with @xmath54 . in solving the integral equation eq .",
    "( [ linear ] ) , the second argument @xmath54 in @xmath36 varies , whereas the first one @xmath55 is a parameter .    in this study",
    "we have used the linearised equation eq .",
    "( [ linear ] ) to project out high - momentum components from the realistic potentials . since the projection operators @xmath25 and @xmath26 do not carry any angular dependence , the integral equation eq .",

    "we have used a method proposed by glckle _ et al_.  @xcite .    another problem arising in solving the linear equation",
    "is caused by the fact that the driving term @xmath64 becomes very large when @xmath65 and @xmath66 go to @xmath0 .",

    "@xmath72 entering this equation we first diagonalize the operator @xmath73 and then take the square root .",
    "finally , the effective potential can be found by subtracting the ( not transformed ) kinetic energy term from the effective hamiltonian .      in eq .",
    "( [ eq : okubo ] ) , the unitary - transformation operator @xmath18 has been given by the block form with respect to the projection operators @xmath25 and @xmath26 .",

    "on the other hand , it is well known that all realistic nn interactions underbind light nuclei such as @xmath163h and @xmath164he . as a consequence , attractive three - nucleon forces",
    "are needed in order to reproduce the experimental numbers .",
    "it is , therefore , in principle possible , that the repulsive effective many - nucleon forces generated through elimination of the high - momentum components compensate , to some extent , these missing attractive forces , minimizing the total effect of the many - nucleon interactions .",
    "if this oversimplified picture reflects the real situation , one would observe a better agreement with the data for calculations based on the lmnn interactions as compared to the ones based on realistic nn forces .",
    "although the results provided by existing many - body calculations as well as by the present few - body calculations with lmnn interactions appear to be quite promising in this respect  , and thus might speak in favor of the above - mentioned tendency of counteracting these two kinds of many - body forces , to the best of our knowledge , no general proof of the validity of the above - mentioned picture has yet been offered .",
    "in addition , one should keep in mind that only a restricted information about many - nucleon forces , which might have very complicated spin and spatial structure , is provided by the discrete spectrum .",
    "a much better testing ground is served by a variety of scattering observables .",
    "it would therefore be interesting to test the lmnn forces in the three - nucleon continuum .",
    "further , we notice that the choice of the lmnn is not unique . preserving",
    "the half - on - shell @xmath6 matrix does not seem to be advantageous in any respect , at least from the conceptual point of view .",
    "if this condition is not required , infinitely many equivalent lmnn can be constructed by means of a unitary transformation in the low - momentum subspace .",
    "even if many - body effects appear to be small for one particular choice of lmnn forces , this might not be the case for a different choice .",
    "certainly , the lmnn interactions with small values of the cutoff , @xmath165 @xmath4 , are not disadvantageous compared to existing realistic nn forces regarding the nuclear structure calculations , if these realistic forces are viewed as purely phenomenological parametrizations with no physical content , underlying the only requirement of reproducing properly the low - energy nn data .",
    "the lmnn interactions have been derived through a unitary - transformation theory from realistic nucleon - nucleon interactions such as the cd - bonn and the nijm - i potentials .",
    "we have constructed the lmnn interactions by two different methods which are based on the common unitary transformation . in order to have a cross check of both computer codes ,",
    "we have shown that the lmnn interactions obtained by the two methods yield the same results .",
    "the lmnn interaction reproduces the low - energy observables in the two - nucleon system with high precision , which has been confirmed by the calculation of the deuteron binding energy and the phase shifts .",
    "the lmnn interaction has been successfully applied to the faddeev - yakubovsky calculations for three- and four - nucleon systems .",
    "the calculated binding energies of the few - nucleon systems begin to deviate from the values calculated using the original nn potentials for @xmath0 smaller than @xmath166 @xmath4 , whereas the results obtained by simply cutting off the high momentum components without performing a unitary transformation deviate considerably even at much higher values of @xmath0 . in an appropriately truncated ( i.e. with @xmath3 @xmath4 ) low - momentum space the lmnn interaction reproduces the exact values of the binding energies , at least , for the few - nucleon systems .",
    "however , we should keep in mind that the calculations of ground - state energies using the lmnn interaction for @xmath148 @xmath4 yield considerably more attractive results than the exact values .",
    "we note that as shown in fig . 1 of kuckei _ et al .",
    "_ s work  @xcite one needs more than @xmath167 @xmath4 as the cutoff value @xmath0 in order to reproduce at least qualitatively the saturation property of nuclear matter .",
    "thus , the application of the lmnn interaction to structure calculations should be done with care , though the lmnn interaction for @xmath148 @xmath4 may be suitable for the calculation of the excitation spectra of low - lying states as has been shown in the shell - model calculations  @xcite .",
