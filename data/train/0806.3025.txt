    "the nucleus @xmath1li has provided many challenges to nuclear physicists over the last decades , see e.g. @xcite for a recent overview .",
    "its beta - decay presents one of these challenges that have not yet been fully solved . the large q - value",
    "( 20.68 mev ) for the @xmath0 decay and the low particle separation energies in the daughter @xmath1be implies that many decay channels are open .",
    "the most extreme channel has a five - body final state consisting of two alpha particles and three neutrons .",
    "decays into this channel , a miniature multifragmentation , and the fact that the constituents ( n and @xmath3 ) are barely kept together allows structure interpretations in terms of cluster or few - body models to be tested . on the experimental side ,",
    "a thorough investigation of the decay is only possible through the recording of the decay products in coincidence .",
    "this has so far only been reported in one earlier experiment @xcite that had a quite limited angular resolution .",
    "the @xmath1li @xmath0-decay involves the largest number of decay channels ever detected and experimental results have been reported for @xmath0n @xcite , @xmath02n @xcite , @xmath03n @xcite , @xmath0 t @xcite and @xmath0d @xcite .",
    "the established channels involve the emission of @xmath3 particles ( 2@xmath3 + 3n ) , @xmath6he ( @xmath6he+@xmath3+n ) , tritons ( @xmath7li+t ) , deuterons ( @xmath8li+d ) and the emission of 1n and 2n feeding states in @xmath9be and @xmath10be , respectively .",
    "the @xmath0-delayed charged particle emission of @xmath1li has been the subject of several previous studies @xcite .",
    "the two channels involving coincident @xmath3 particles were studied in one previous experiment @xcite .",
    "the 2@xmath33n channel was established to have contributions from the break - up of two states in @xmath1be , one at 10.59 mev and the other at around 18.5 mev .",
    "the @xmath6he@xmath3n channel was established as the @xmath6he+@xmath3 break - up of a state at about 9.4 mev in @xmath9be fed in the neutron decay of the 10.59 mev state in @xmath1be .    by means of a gas - detector telescope for particle identification , the different @xmath6he@xmath3n , 2@xmath33n , @xmath9be+n , @xmath8be+2n , @xmath7li+t and @xmath8li+d decay channels of the @xmath1118.5 mev state in @xmath1be and its branching ratios were determined @xcite .",
    "an r - matrix analysis established the energy of this state to be 18.15(15 ) mev .",
    "the large reduced width of the @xmath8li+d channel with respect to the wigner limit @xcite was interpreted as evidence of the @xmath1li(gs ) @xmath0-decaying directly into the @xmath8li+d continuum .",
    "a recent @xmath0-@xmath12-n coincidence experiment using polarized @xmath1li @xcite determined the spin and parity of several levels fed in @xmath1be ( e@xmath1311 mev ) . in that work",
    "the 10.59 mev level was found to contribute to the neutron spectrum via transitions to the @xmath9be(gs ) and tentatively to the first 2@xmath14 state at 3.4 mev and to the unresolved doublet at @xmath119.27 mev ( 4@xmath15 ) and 9.4 mev ( 2@xmath14 ) .",
    "the @xmath0-decay asymmetry of these three neutron transitions consistently determines the spin and parity of the 10.59 mev level in @xmath1be as 5/2@xmath15 .",
    "its 210(40 ) kev width was determined from the reaction @xmath8be(t , p)@xmath1be  @xcite .",
    "additional information about the decay of the 10.59 and 18.15 mev states in @xmath1be is obtained from three - neutron emission probability , which is equal to the branching to the five body ( 2@xmath33n ) final state . from the average branching ratio to the only bound state in @xmath1be , and the p@xmath16/p@xmath17 , p@xmath18/p@xmath17 ratios determined by azuma _",
    "@xcite a value of p@xmath18=1.9(2 ) % is obtained .",
    "the different experiments summarized above paint a fairly complicated picture of the @xmath0-delayed charged particle break - up of @xmath1li .",
    "it is neither well understood which levels in @xmath1be are contributing to the charged particle channels nor their break - up mechanisms .",
    "one should notice that significant @xmath0-decay strength in the 10 - 18 mev energy range is predicted in shell model calculations @xcite .",
    "[ fig1 ] shows schematically the @xmath1li @xmath0-fed states in @xmath1be above the charged particle thresholds and the decay channels discussed above as established prior to this experiment . since it is still not clear whether the @xmath8li+d channel proceeds sequentially through a state in @xmath1be at 18.15 mev or directly from @xmath1li @xcite , the figure displays both possibilities as dashed lines .",
    "the main aim of the present paper is to provide significantly improved data on the @xmath0-delayed branches , especially those including two charged particles .",
    "these data allow a leap to be taken in the description of the break - up process following the weak decay .",
    "the interpretation presented here is based on known resonances in @xmath1be and intermediate nuclei in the decay chain .",
    "we consider not only decays through @xmath9be , but also channels involving @xmath4he intermediate resonances .",
    "the following section describes the experiment , section 3 presents the analysis of the data , and the final section summarizes the results .",
    "the experiment was carried out at the isolde psb facility at cern , where the @xmath1li activity was produced in fragmentation reactions in a ta target irradiated with 1.4 gev protons from the cern ps booster .",
    "the target container was connected to a surface ion source and the produced ions were accelerated to 30 kev .",
    "the 1@xmath14 lithium ions were mass selected from the different isobars using the general purpose separator .",
    "the @xmath1li beam was subsequently brought to the center of the particle detector setup where it was stopped in a 60 @xmath19g/@xmath20 carbon foil .",
    "the use of a thin foil , which minimizes the energy loss of the emitted charged particles , was possible due to the low acceleration voltage used in this experiment .",
    "the setup , shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , consisted of 4 particle telescopes with thin double - sided silicon strip detectors ( dsssd ) in front stacked with thick silicon pads , for @xmath0 detection .",
    "the telescopes were mounted on the surfaces of a 10x10x10 @xmath21 cubic frame , each covering 4% of 4@xmath22 .",
    "charge collection in these dsssd s was carried out by 16 vertical and 16 horizontal strips , constituting 256 detector pixels , with an angular resolution of @xmath113.5@xmath23 .",
    "each telescope combines large solid angle with high segmentation which gives large coverage with good angular resolution .",
    "the geometry of the setup defines three possible types of two - particle coincidences , depending on which detectors were hit .",
    "hits in dsssd d2 and dsssd d4 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ) , classified as _",
    "180@xmath23 _ coincidences , covered angles from 127@xmath23  to 180@xmath23  between the detected particles .",
    "hits in dsssd d3 and either dsssd d2 or dsssd d4 , classified as _ 90@xmath23",
    "_  coincidences , covered angles from 37@xmath23  to 143@xmath23  between the detected particles . finally , coincidences detected in the same detector , classified as _ 0@xmath23 _  coincidences , covered angles from 0@xmath23  to 50@xmath23  between the detected particles . from here on we will concentrate on the _",
    "180@xmath23 _ coincidences , which have an efficiency estimated from the simulations of 5% on average .",
    "the silicon detectors were calibrated using standard @xmath24gd and triple alpha sources ( @xmath25pu , @xmath26am and @xmath27 cm ) .",
    "furthermore , the effective thickness of the carbon foil used as stopper was obtained from the analysis of the @xmath3 particles coming from an online @xmath28na beam implanted in the foil before and after the experiment .",
    "the energy losses in non - active layers , such as the carbon - foil and the surface dead - layer of the silicon detectors are approximately 100 kev for @xmath3 particles of energies around 1 mev .",
    "since 60% of the @xmath1li @xmath0-delayed charged particles are expected to be emitted with 1 mev energy or less @xcite , it is crucial to take these energy losses into account .",
    "the method developed within our collaboration @xcite takes advantage of the highly segmented nature of the dsssd s to precisely define the path of the detected particle and thus allowing for the reconstruction of the energy losses in the non - active layers .",
    "the combined effect of the dead - layers and low energy noise gives detection thresholds around 180 kev .",
    "the use of highly segmented dsssd detectors gives to this experiment a significant advantage compared to the previous studies of the @xmath1li @xmath0-delayed charged particle emission . by using segmented detectors not only the energy of the particle is measured but also its direction with a good suppression of unwanted @xmath0-@xmath3 and @xmath0-@xmath6he pile - up events .",
    "this technique has successfully allowed to determine the decay mechanism of states in @xmath8be  @xcite , @xmath8b @xcite and @xmath29c @xcite . we apply here this technique to the study of the decay mechanism of the @xmath1li @xmath0-delayed @xmath6he@xmath3n and 2@xmath33n channels , trying to determine which levels in @xmath1be and @xmath9be are involved .",
    "moreover we discuss the possible role played by the @xmath30he and @xmath31he resonances in the break - up of @xmath0-fed @xmath1be states .",
    "we concentrate here on the analysis of @xmath1li @xmath0-delayed double coincidences detected in the dsssd s .",
    "the @xmath1li @xmath0-delayed events are enhanced over daughter activities by gating on the first 40 ms after the proton impact on the target . the combined effect of the release from the target and the half - life of @xmath1li ( t@xmath32=8.5(2 ) ms @xcite ) makes this time window optimum for the study of the @xmath1li activity with minimum contribution from the @xmath0-delayed @xmath30li+@xmath3 branch of the daughter nucleus @xmath1be ( see fig .",
    "[ fig3]@xmath33 ) .",
    "the particle emitting channels following @xmath1li @xmath0-decay are 5-body 2@xmath33n , 3-body n@xmath2he , 2-body @xmath7li+t and @xmath8li+d .",
    "all these channels involve the emission of two charged fragments , but the low recoil energy of the @xmath10li ions ( @xmath34 160 kev @xcite ) makes the contribution of the @xmath8li+d channel negligible .",
    "the @xmath7li + t channel is sorted out from the data by kinematics .",
    "the deduced branching ratio of 0.014(3)% is in agreement with the literature value @xcite .",
    "the total number of events assigned to this decay channel , 224 , is less than 3% of the total coincidence events .",
    "thus , the study of the charged particle coincidences greatly enhances the 5-body and 3-body channels .",
    "the study of the charged particle emission in @xmath1li is connected with several experimental difficulties .",
    "first , we lack complete kinematics information in the five body channel , as we can not reconstruct the three missing neutron momenta .",
    "second , although it is possible to calculate the missing neutron momentum in the three body channel , the lack of particle identification in our setup , makes the reconstruction rather inaccurate . because of these shortcomings",
    ", the analysis concentrates on studying direct observables , the individual energy and direction of the detected particles and simple transformations of these energies , such as sums and differences .",
    "the sum energy spectrum enhances the contribution of the channels where the two detected particles formed a resonance .",
    "the energy difference , defined as @xmath35 , is the best parameter to enhance channels where the decay kinematics group the events across the scatter plot instead of scattering them evenly , as expected from pure phase space kinematics .",
    ".level centroid and reduced widths used in the r - matrix description of the states modeled in the monte - carlo code .",
    "the @xmath36 was obtained from a gaussian fit of the r - matrix peak directly .",
    "[ table1 ] [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     @xmath37 only the statistical error is consider in this column .",
    "+ @xmath38 including the normalization uncertainty .",
    "+ @xmath39 assuming a 2% feeding to the ground state in @xmath1be , stated as upper limit in previous works @xcite .",
    "+    the energy difference distribution , @xmath40 , in the 8.2@xmath13e@xmath41+e@xmath42@xmath1310 mev region , is shown in the black histogram in fig .",
    "[ fig5]@xmath43 . as mentioned before",
    ", the @xmath40 parameter enhances the decay channels where the detected particles are one from the first step and the other from the final resonance .",
    "we chose this high energy region because one or maximum two channels could contribute to the spectrum .",
    "the phase - space break - up monte - carlo simulation is shown in dashed green in fig . [ fig5]@xmath43 , while the sequential break - up including the @xmath30he(gs ) channel is shown in dashed red .",
    "the data show a distribution with a clear dip in the middle that is contradicted by the phase - space model . on the other hand",
    ", the inclusion of the @xmath30he+@xmath3 channel nicely reproduces the double peak shape of the plot .",
    "this region is clearly dominated by the @xmath44he(gs ) channel ( see the black dashed line in fig . [ fig5]@xmath33 ) .",
    "table [ table3 ] shows the branching ratios to levels in @xmath1be obtained in this work .",
    "the values were calculated from the intensity distribution of the monte - carlo simulation , rather than from the direct experimental data , as the experimental coincidence efficiency is difficult to determine . in order to normalize the @xmath0-branching ratios we need to estimate the absolute @xmath1li activity .",
    "the activity was evaluated using the known branching ratio of the daughter , @xmath1be , decay into @xmath30li(gs and 1/2@xmath15)+@xmath3 .",
    "the @xmath1li @xmath0-decay branching ratio to the first excited state in @xmath1be , 7.4(3 ) % , is the weighted average of the values from @xcite .",
    "the value for @xmath1be @xmath0-decay branching ratio to the 9.8 mev state in @xmath1b is 2.9(4 ) % @xcite .",
    "the values shown in the second column in table [ table3 ] were obtained assuming negligible @xmath0-feeding to the @xmath1be ground state .",
    "the third column shows the branching ratios obtained assuming 2% @xmath0-feeding to the @xmath1be ground state .",
    "a possible source of uncertainty in the estimation of the @xmath0-feeding values is the presence of @xmath1be ions in the incoming @xmath1li beam .",
    "direct production of @xmath1be up to a few percent of the @xmath1li beam has been observed previously at isolde @xcite .",
    "if this is the case , the branching ratios will increase in the same few percent as the direct production of @xmath1be .",
    "comparison with previous branching ratio values @xcite is not considered pertinent . although the energy and width of the states in @xmath1be are taken from the literature @xcite , the break - up channels are different in this and previous analysis , thus resulting in different distribution of the @xmath0 feeding . as an additional check",
    ", we compare the branching ratio of the 2@xmath3 + 3n channel to the published p@xmath18 value , 1.9(2)% @xcite , obtained assuming no @xmath0-feeding to the ground state .",
    "the value obtained in this work , 1.4(5)% , is smaller , but one has to take into account that the 2@xmath33n breakup of the 10.59 mev state has a distribution that is below our particle threshold .",
    "the charged particles emitted in the @xmath0-decay of @xmath1li have been measured in coincidence using a highly segmented setup . the coincidence energy spectrum can be explained mainly by the 2@xmath3 + 3n and n+@xmath3+@xmath6he channels .",
    "the analysis presented in this work shows that the phase space energy description of the 2@xmath33n channel is not capable of explaining the correlations at high energy observed in the @xmath0-decay of @xmath1li ( fig .",
    "[ fig3]@xmath43 ) .",
    "in particular the lack of events in the central region of the scatter plot is intriguing .",
    "this was also visible in fig .",
    "@xcite although not considered by the authors , probably due to the low statistics .",
    "this minimum forms two lobes of slopes 7/4 and 4/7 indicating the involvement of mass 4 and mass 7 nuclei in the first stage of a sequential decay .",
    "this naturally brings @xmath4he isotopes into play , as they are involved in the break - up of all other be isotopes .",
    "a monte - carlo simulation was performed including these channels , @xmath1be(10.59 , 18.15)@xmath45he  @xmath46he@xmath47n and @xmath1be(18.15)@xmath48he@xmath49he@xmath50n , plus the confirmed n@xmath2he break - up of the 10.59 mev state in @xmath1be through the 9.5 mev state in @xmath9be , whose energy and width have been determined in this work .",
    "the resulting simulation reproduces well the correlations observed in the scatter plot , thus rejecting a description of the break - up of the 18.15 mev state in terms of phase space energy sharing only , although up to 20% mixture of direct break - up can not be statistically excluded .",
    "we also check the energy difference spectrum e@xmath41-e@xmath42 in the region where we expect the @xmath30he+@xmath3 sequential decay channel to dominate .",
    "neither 5-body 2@xmath3 + 3n break - up @xcite nor 3-body n@xmath2he break - up @xcite described by phase space energy distribution reproduces the structure observed in this spectrum . only by introducing the sequential break - up through @xmath30he(gs ) into n@xmath2he final state",
    "we are able to explain the two - peak structure observed in the energy difference distribution , @xmath40 .    the study of the @xmath1li @xmath0-delayed particle emission is an excellent tool to determine the highest excited states in @xmath1be , a difficult task to be singled out by other experimental techniques .",
    "these results constitute a significant step beyond the previous @xmath0-decay work @xcite .",
    "the experimental data presented in this work indicate that the decay of excited states in @xmath1be above the charged particle thresholds can not be explained solely as a multi - particle break - up dominated by the phase space energy distribution .",
    "we conclude that @xmath4he resonant states play a significant role in the sequential break - up of @xmath1be excited states .",
    "this naturally suggests a more prominent role of nuclear structure effects in the description of the break - up process of these states than previously assumed .",
