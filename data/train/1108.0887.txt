    "a main goal of string phenomenology is to discover the mechanisms by which the detailed properties of our universe may arise . among these are the standard model ( sm ) gauge groups , the number of generations of chiral fermions , and the observed mass hierarchies and mixings of quarks and leptons .",
    "of particular importance , the proton appears to have a very long lifetime .",
    "baryon ( @xmath3 ) and lepton number ( @xmath4 ) violating processes have to date never been observed , yet they are only conserved as accidental global symmetries of the sm .",
    "however , such global symmetries are generically broken by nonperturbative effects , and thus baryon number is expected to be violated at some level in the sm .",
    "in fact , dimension-4 operators appear in the minimal supersymmetric sm ( mssm ) which leads to proton decay at a disastrously high rate . usually these operators are eliminating by imposing a discrete symmetry on the mssm such as r - parity  @xcite .",
    "however , operators of dimension-5 also appear which are not eliminated by r - parity , leading to a proton decay rate which is generically too large .",
    "although imposition of r - parity may seem ad hoc , it provides a simple explanation for another mystery .",
    "observations in cosmology and astrophysics suggest the presence of a stable dark matter particle .",
    "a natural candidate for wimp - like dark matter is the lightest supersymmetric partner ( lsp )  @xcite in supersymmetric models which include r - parity conservation , which is usually the lightest neutralino @xmath5  @xcite .",
    "limits on the dark matter relic abundance and direct and indirect detection cross - sections can be used to constrain the possible superpartner and higgs spectra which may be observed at the large hadron collider ( lhc ) . in short , only superpartner spectra which possess a stable lsp consistent with all other constraints on dark matter are viable .",
    "of course , the mssm is just an effective theory which should be replaced at high energies by something more fundamental , such as string theory . in particular ,",
    "type iia string compactifications involving @xmath6-branes intersecting at angles ( and their type iib duals including f - theory extensions ) have provided a fruitful direction for studying this question .",
    "such models have been the subject of much study in recent years , and we refer the reader to @xcite for recent reviews . a phenomenologically interesting model of this type",
    "was first constructed in  @xcite and studied in  @xcite . in this three - generation pati - salam model , it is possible to obtain realistic yukawa matrices for quarks and leptons , tree - level gauge unification at the string scale , and obtain realistic supersymmetry spectra satisfying all experimental constraints .",
    "the phenomenological consequences of this model at the lhc were considered in  @xcite and  @xcite , and the implications for direct and indirect dark matter detection were initially studied in  @xcite . in the present work ,",
    "we show that a variation of this model originally constructed in  @xcite possesses an extra nonanomalous u(1 ) gauge symmetry that forbids all dimension-4 , 5 , and 6 operators found in the mssm which allow proton decay ( related four - generation models were considered in @xcite ) .",
    "thus , the proton is effectively stable in the model ( see  @xcite for a similar study in the context of free - fermionic heterotic string / m - theory compactifications ) . in particular , it is not necessary to introduce r - parity in order to eliminate the dimension-4 operators which allow proton decay at a dangerously high rate .",
    "nevertheless , r - parity may still naturally arise in the model via a @xmath7 gauge symmetry which is broken spontaneously to its discrete @xmath8 subgroup , resulting in a stable lsp .",
    "thus , we update the constraints on dark matter direct detection taking into account the recent limit on the dark matter direct detection cross - section from the cdmsii  @xcite and xenon100  @xcite collaborations .",
    ".general spectrum for intersecting d6 branes at generic angles , where @xmath9 and @xmath10 , where @xmath11 .",
    "in addition , @xmath12 is the multiplicity , and @xmath13 and @xmath14 denote the symmetric and antisymmetric representations of u(@xmath15 ) , respectively . [ cols=\"^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     since @xmath16 , associated with each the stacks @xmath17 , @xmath18 , @xmath19 , and @xmath20 are @xmath21 gauge groups , denoted as @xmath22 , @xmath23 , @xmath24 , and @xmath25 . in general",
    ", these u(1)s are anomalous .",
    "the anomalies associated with these u(1)s are canceled by a generalized green - schwarz ( g - s ) mechanism that involves untwisted r - r forms .",
    "the couplings of the four untwisted r - r forms @xmath26 to the u(1 ) field strength @xmath27 of each stack @xmath17 are given by  @xcite @xmath28 as a result , the gauge bosons of these abelian groups generically become massive .",
    "however , these u(1)s remain as global symmetries to all orders in perturbation theory . indeed , baryon and lepton number conservation are typically identified as arising from these global symmetries .",
    "these global u(1 ) symmetries may also result in the forbidding of certain superpotential operators , such as yukawa couplings and those which mediate baryon and lepton number violation .",
    "however , these _ global _ symmetries may be broken by nonperturbative effects , such as from d - brane instantons .",
    "the couplings of eq .",
    "( [ gscouplings ] ) determine the exact linear combinations of u(1 ) gauge bosons that acquire string - scale masses via the g - s mechanism . if u(1)@xmath29 is a linear combination of the u(1)s from each stack , @xmath30 then the corresponding field strength must be orthogonal to those that acquire g - s mass . thus , if a linear combination u(1)@xmath29 satisfies  @xcite @xmath31 the gauge boson of u(1)@xmath29 acquires no g - s mass and is anomaly - free , provided that the rr - tadpole conditions are satisfied .    for the present model ,",
    "precisely one linear combination satisfies the above conditions , and therefore has a massless gauge boson and is anomaly- free : @xmath32.\\ ] ] thus , the effective gauge symmetry of the model at the string scale is given by @xmath33.\\ ] ] as can be seen from table  [ spectrum ] , the superfields @xmath34 carry charge @xmath35 , the superfields @xmath36 carry charge @xmath37 , while the higgs superfields are uncharged under u(1)@xmath29 .",
    "thus , the trilinear yukawa couplings for quarks and leptons are allowed by both the global u(1 ) symmetries as well as the gauged @xmath38 symmetry . as was shown in  @xcite ,",
    "the resulting yukawa matrices are rank 3 , which allows for fermion mass textures that can easily accommodate the observed mass hierarchies and mixings for quarks and leptons .",
    "the pati - salam gauge symmetry is broken to the sm in two steps .",
    "first , the @xmath17 and @xmath19 stacks of d6-branes are split such that @xmath39 and @xmath40 , where @xmath41 , @xmath42 , @xmath43 , and @xmath44 .",
    "the process of breaking the gauge symmetry via brane splitting corresponds to assigning vevs along flat directions to adjoint scalars associated with each stack that arise from the open - string moduli  @xcite . after splitting the d6-branes ,",
    "the gauge symmetry of the observable sector is @xmath45 where @xmath46 and @xmath47,\\ ] ] and @xmath48 .",
    "just as was the case in  @xcite , one may also form linear combinations of @xmath2 and @xmath49 which couple to baryon number and lepton number respectively : @xmath50 , \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ u(1)_l = \\frac{1}{4}[-3u(1)_{b - l}+ u(1)_{3b+l } ] .",
    "\\label{gaugedbl}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    as mentioned in the introduction , the promotion of the sm to the mssm introduced operators which allow proton decay .",
    "the first of these is the rapid decay of the proton through the pair of @xmath51 @xmath52-term operators ( @xmath3- and @xmath4-violating , respectively )  @xcite : @xmath53 this problem is usually solved in the mssm by introducing @xmath54 parity , under which the known fermions are even while their susy partners are odd ( or the related `` matter parity '' , under which @xmath55 for @xmath56 and @xmath57 for @xmath58 ) . as a bonus",
    ", @xmath54 parity leads to a stable lightest susy particle ( lsp ) , which is a natural candidate for dark matter .",
    "although this idea is attractive , it is well known that a gauged @xmath7 also forbids the @xmath59 operators , and furthermore , @xmath54 parity [ more specifically , matter parity @xmath60 can result from @xmath61 broken spontaneously to its discrete @xmath8 subgroup  @xcite . for the present model , none of these operators are singlets under either @xmath2 or @xmath49 and so are forbidden .    even though the problem of rapid proton decay via @xmath59 operators can be eliminated through this mechanism ,",
    "one still faces the problem of @xmath62 operators that allow for proton decay with a lifetime too short to evade current experimental constraints unless the coefficients of these operators are chosen to be sufficiently small .",
    "first among these are single operators that allow ( at least in principle ) proton decay and preserve @xmath63 : @xmath64_f \\ , , \\",

    "similar considerations apply to the dimension-6 proton decay operators .",
    "of course , these results may be easily understood by considering that baryon and lepton number are effectively gauged in the model as given by eq .",
    "( [ gaugedbl ] ) .",
    "it should also be emphasized that since these operators are forbidden by gauged symmetries rather than global symmetries , none of these operators may appear either perturbatively or nonperturbatively .",
    "thus , the proton is essentially stable in this model with a lifetime in excess of the current experimental lower bounds .",
    "of course , the gauge symmetry must be further broken to the sm , with the possibility of one or more additional u(1 ) gauge symmetries .",
    "this may be accomplished in this model by assigning vevs to the vectorlike singlet fields with the quantum numbers @xmath67 and @xmath68 under the @xmath69 gauge symmetry from the @xmath70 intersections . in this case , the gauge symmetry is further broken to @xmath71_{observable } \\times \\left[su(2)\\times usp(2)^2\\right]_{hidden},\\ ] ] where @xmath72 is given in eq .",

    "on the other hand , other alternate scenarios for symmetry breaking are possible .",
    "for example , the u(1)@xmath75u(1)@xmath76u(1)@xmath77 gauge symmetry may instead be broken by assigning vevs to the right - handed neutrino fields @xmath78 . in this case , the gauge symmetry is broken to @xmath79_{observable } \\times \\left[su(2)\\times usp(2)^2\\right]_{hidden}.   \\label{mssm_b}\\ ] ] however , assigning vevs to @xmath78 breaks susy , which is expected not to occur until the tev scale .",
    "thus , it is possible to obtain a nonanomlous gauged u(1 ) which counts either lepton number or baryon number , depending upon the way in which singlet vevs are assigned .",
    "in the previous section we demonstrated that the gauge symmetry may be broken to @xmath80 at the gut scale by assigning vevs to the vectorlike fields @xmath81 , @xmath82 , or to @xmath83 at the tev scale by assigning vevs to the right - handed neutrinos @xmath78 .",
    "these two cases show that models of this type may be adapted to provide either a u(1)@xmath84 or u(1)@xmath85 that survives unbroken to low energies .",
    "the possibility of constructing models where baryon and lepton number are gauged at low energies has , of course , been considered before  @xcite . usually in such models ,",
    "extra matter must be arbitrarily added in order to cancel anomalies . for the present construction , the matter content and anomaly cancellation",
    "is fixed by the configuration of d - branes and the global consistency conditions .",
    "thus , it is possible to obtain nonanomlous u(1 ) gauge symmetries coupled to baryon and lepton number in a very natural way ( see  @xcite for a discussion of the implications of extra abelian gauge symmetries in string models ) .",
    "in addition to those fields discussed above , other singlet fields appear in the model whose vevs may break u(1)@xmath77 [ or equivalently , u(1)@xmath85 and u(1)@xmath84 ] at intermediate scales , namely , the singlets @xmath87 and @xmath88 , as well as the su(2)@xmath89 triplet fields @xmath90 . in particular , the @xmath91-term and a majorana mass term may be generated by superpotential operators of the form @xmath92 where @xmath93 and @xmath94 are yukawa couplings . in this case , the",
    "singlets @xmath88 and @xmath90 may obtain string or gut - scale vevs ( or lower ) while preserving the d - flatness of u(1)@xmath95 , and the singlets @xmath87 may obtain tev - scale vevs while preserving the d - flatness of u(1)@xmath96 , while the higgses couple through their electroweak - scale vevs .",
    "simple order - of - magnitude estimates then show that a tev - scale @xmath91 term may be generated by these operators , with @xmath97 and right - handed neutrino masses can be generated in the range @xmath98  gev for @xmath99 , assuming gut- or string - scale vevs for the @xmath81 and @xmath90 . in this is the case , the the only surviving abelian symmetry in the model which survives is the sm hypercharge , u(1)@xmath100 .",
    "however , it is also possible to generate a @xmath91-term and a right - handed majorana mass via nonperturbative effects such as d - brane instantons  @xcite . in this case , the singlet fields @xmath88 or @xmath90 need not receive vevs at high energy scales , and so either u(1)@xmath85 or u(1)@xmath84 may potentially survive unbroken .",
    "if either @xmath101 or @xmath74 survives unbroken down to the tev - scale , this may result in so - called leptophobic ( coupled to quarks , but not leptons ) or leptophilic ( coupled to leptons , but not quarks ) @xmath1 bosons which may be observable at the lhc .",
    "in particular , leptophobic z bosons have been obtained in unified models based on flipped su(5 ) and e@xmath102 , though typically with couplings which are family non - universal  @xcite .",
    "the possibility of observing z bosons in general has been much studied in the literature and we direct the reader to  @xcite and  @xcite for reviews .    the main constraints on z bosons with electweak scale couplings come from precision electroweak data , direct searches at the tevatron , and searches for flavor changing neutral currents ( fcnc ) . perhaps the most stringent constraints on z couplings comes from lep ii .",
    "for example , the process @xmath103 leads to a constraint of @xmath104  gev for @xmath1 masses above roughly 200  gev  @xcite . at lower mass scales ,",
    "the lep ii constraint , which is derived in an effective field theory formalism , is not directly applicable .",
    "below about a scale of 200  gev , off - shell @xmath1 production is not suppressed by the @xmath1 mass , but instead by the lep center - of - mass energy .",
    "a modest constraint is therefore @xmath105 for @xmath106  gev .",
    "constraints which are somewhat strong may be placed on the production and decay into @xmath107 pairs of on - shell @xmath1 bosons if the @xmath1 mass is near one of the center - of - mass energies at which lep  ii operated  @xcite .",
    "constraints from the @xmath108-channel production of @xmath107  @xcite and/or @xmath109  @xcite at the tevatron are also quite stringent ( @xmath110 final states are considerably less constrained  @xcite ) . a @xmath1 with standard model - like couplings , for example , must be heavier than approximately 1  tev to be consistent with the null results of these searches  @xcite .",
    "a so - called leptophobic @xmath1 , such as would result from u(1)@xmath85 , is much more difficult to observe at both lepton and hadron colliders .",
    "in particular , at hadron colliders the qcd background at low dijet mass introduces large theoretical uncertainties , overwhelming any resonance signal arising from a @xmath1 with electroweak - strength or smaller couplings , thus the naive expectation that a search for a peak in the dijet invariant mass distributions would suffice is not correct . for a leptophobic @xmath1 in the mass range @xmath111  gev , dijet searches at the tevatron ( @xmath112 ) constrain its couplings to quarks to be comparable to or less than those of the standard model @xmath113 @xcite . for a leptophobic @xmath1 below 300 gev , the uncertainties in the qcd background overwhelm the signal at the tevatron , and",
    "so the strongest constraints come from the lower energy ua2 experiment  @xcite . from the lack of an observed dijet resonance ,",
    "ua2 can place constraints on the order of @xmath114@xmath115 for @xmath1 masses in the range of 130 to 300 gev .",
    "from these constraints , we can see that a leptophilic z resulting from u(1)@xmath84 would require a mass greater than @xmath116  tev , while a leptophobic z resulting from u(1)@xmath85 may be light so long as its couplings to quarks are comparable to the z boson of the sm .",
    "both leptophilic and leptophobic z bosons have been put forward as explanations of various experimental anomalies in recent years .",
    "the possibility of leptophilic dark matter , such as might arise in the present context if the gaugino associated with u(1)@xmath84 is stable , has been suggested as an explanation  @xcite of the observed pamela  @xcite / atic  @xcite cosmic ray positron excess , while a relatively light leptophobic @xmath117 has been suggested as an explainion  @xcite of the tevatron anomalies in the measured @xmath118 forward - backward asymmetry  @xcite and the associated production of @xmath119s with jets  @xcite , although a more recent analysis by the cms collaboration has ruled out a z as an explanation of the forward - backward asymmetry  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the d0 collaboration has not observed the same w + dijet excess as cdf  @xcite .",
    "the goal of the present work is not to provide a solution for these issues , but rather to demonstrate that such z bosons may exist in the model and suggest possible applications ( see  @xcite and  @xcite for a similar recent discussion in the context of type ii string compactifications with a low string scale ) .    as the possibility of low - scale z bosons has been extensively studied in the literarure , including leptophilic and leptophobic varieties , it is not necessary to repeat these analyses in the present context .",
    "we have shown that the model may allow for such z bosons to be present at low - energies , and the results of previous studies on z bosons are applicable to these results .",
    "most importantly , the z couplings in this model are family universal , thus they do not give rise to flavor - changing neutral currents ( fcnc ) .",
    "perhaps the most exciting possibility for new physics involving z bosons at the moment is that a leptophobiz z can explain the w + dijet excess reported by cdf  @xcite .",
    "finally , let us recall that the gauge symmetry of the may be broken so that u(1)@xmath85 survives below the tev scale by assigning vevs to the right - handed neutrino fields , @xmath78 .",
    "as the vevs of these fields break supersymmetry , the scale at which this is expected is the tev scale .",
    "thus , a leptophobic z in the model is expected to have mass of the tev scale or lower , while a leptophilic z may have a mass intermediate between the tev scale and the unification scale .",

    "this results in a stable lsp , which can provide an excellent dark matter candidate in the case of a neutralino or gravitino lsp .",
    "however , as we have seen , it is not necessary to invoke r - parity in this model in order eliminate rapid proton decay .",
    "thus , it is possible that the lsp may not be stable in this model , and therefore would not provide a dark matter candidate .",
    "however , the model does possess a gauged @xmath7 at the string scale after the pati - salam gauge symmetry is broken .",
    "this can then provide a natural origin for a gauged r - parity , even though it is not required for proton stability .",
    "in particular , the model will possess an exact gauged r - parity provided that @xmath7 is broken by scalar vevs that carry even integer values of @xmath122  @xcite .",

    "likewise , the tan@xmath121 examined here are those from near the minimum tan@xmath121 possible to satisfy the experimental constraints , to a large tan@xmath121 value representative of the high tan@xmath121 region of the model space . the spin - independent contours in figs .",
    "[ fig : sigma_plot1]-[fig : sigma_plot5 ] represent the most current upper bounds from the cdms  @xcite and xenon100  @xcite experiments , as a function of the lsp mass .",
    "we find that the only regions significantly affected by the xenon100 constraints are those where the lightest neutralino and chargino are nearly degenerate .",
    "these points of chargino - neutralino degeneracy possess a nearly zero relic density , thus the neutralino would comprise only a tiny fraction of the total cold dark matter .",
    "nonetheless , those regions with both chargino - neutralino and stau - neutralino coannihilation do subsist for potential supersymmetry and lsp discovery .",
    "each figure is demarcated to clearly identify the appropriate areas of coannihilation .",
    "we have discussed the presence of an extra nonanomalous u(1 ) gauge symmetry in a realistic three - generation pati - salam model constructed with intersecting d6-branes in type iia string theory on a @xmath0 orientifold .",
    "as discussed in previous papers , the sm gauge couplings are unified at the string scale in this model and it is possible to obtain realistic yukawa matrices for quarks and leptons .",
    "besides these favorable phenomenological features , we have shown that the additional u(1 ) prohibits all dimension-4 , 5 , and 6 operators that mediate proton decay in the mssm .",
    "in particular , we have shown that this u(1 ) gives rise to a @xmath66 gauge symmetry once the pati - salam gauge symmetry is broken .",
    "furthermore , it is possible to find linear combinations with @xmath7 which lead to the effective promotion of baryon and lepton number to local gauge symmetries .",
    "thus , the proton is essentially stable in this model .",
    "as was mentioned , in the mssm rapid proton decay is allowed by the dimension-4 operators unless a discrete symmetry such as r - parity is imposed .",
    "however , even though these operators can be removed without invoking r - parity in the model considered here , r - parity can naturally surface from a spontaneously broken @xmath2 provided certain conditions are satisfied which can be accomplished in the model .",
    "thus , presuming the existence of r - parity giving rise to a stable lsp , we studied the direct detection cross - sections for neutralino dark matter through application of the most current constraints from the xenon100 and cdms experiments .",
    "we found that other than those regions with a lightest neutralino and chargino degeneracy , the @xmath6 model space remains relatively intact and unaffected by the xenon100 constraints .",
    "these include regions of the parameter space where the relic density is generated through neutralino coannihilation with the stau and lightest chargino .",
    "however , this experiment will soon have sufficient reach to thoroughly test the model predictions for stable neutralino dark matter .",
    "we should comment that it is really quite remarkable that a nonanomalous u(1 ) gauge symmetry arises in the model which automatically leads to a stable proton with a very long lifetime .",
    "given the observed long lifetime of the proton , proton stability can be considered one of the essential properties of any model of particle physics , string theory vacua in particular , given the existence of the string landscape .",
    "it is known that models built on minimal @xmath141 do not satisfy this criteria as the dimension-5 operators which mediate proton decay are present in such constructions . however , in unified models based on @xmath141 such as flipped su(5 ) , the proton may decay at a rate which is observable , but which satisfies current experimental limits .",
    "although the model considered in this paper has a pati - salam structure , we have pointed out that it is not possible to obtain this pati - salam from a gut such as @xmath142 due to the charges under the extra u(1 ) carried by the matter supermultiplets .",
    "thus , this scenario can be considered to give rise to a new gut - less  paradigm where the proton is stable and the gauge couplings are unified at high energies , but where the gauge symmetry does not unify to a grand theory ( other than of the pati - salam type ) .",
    "this was supported in part by the national science foundation under grant no .",
