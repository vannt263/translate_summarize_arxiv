    "the electron - doped high - t@xmath6 superconducting ( sc ) cuprates , e.g. ( ln , ce)@xmath7cuo@xmath8 ( ln = la , pr , nd , sm ) , have been extensively investigated since its discovery by tokura",

    "the hole - doped cuprates can exhibit superconductivity when introducing a sufficient concentration of hole carriers by either atom - substituting or oxygen doping in the insulating ln@xmath7cuo@xmath9 host material .",
    "however , the superconductivity does not appear in the electron - doped cuprates until a metastable t-phase is achieved by an extra annealing treatment of the as - grown samples .",
    "what happens during this annealing process is still a controversy . although oxygen reduction is widely considered as the crucial factor in this annealing process , it is hard to be determined stoichiometrically because the amount of the oxygen loss @xmath10 is always relatively small .",
    "the previous measurements of @xmath10 by either thermogravimetric analysis ( tga )  @xcite or iodometric titration analyses  @xcite can not come to an agreement .",
    "many efforts have been made to clarify this puzzling issue .",
    "based on the transport and the thermopower measurements , jiang _ et al . _",
    "proclaimed that both the redundant and the indigent of oxygen would induce more impurities and enhance the scattering  @xcite .",
    "the lacking of oxygen can introduce a positive contribution and the excess oxygen always results in a negative contribution to the hall coefficient , e.g. in nd@xmath0ce@xmath11cuo@xmath9 ( ncco ) thin films and single crystals as well as pr@xmath0ce@xmath11cuo@xmath9 thin films  @xcite .",

    "_ studied the infrared transmission of the pr@xmath12 crystal - field in the pr@xmath0ce@xmath11cuo@xmath9 single crystal , and they pointed out that the oxygen in the cuo@xmath7 plane is partially removed during the reduction  @xcite instead of the apical ones . using x - ray and neutron - scattering methods , kang _",

    "they suggested that both the repair of cu deficiencies and the creation of oxygen vacancies can effectively reduce the disorder and provide itinerant carriers for superconductivity in the reduction treatment of the samples .",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite claimed that if the reduction is not sufficient in the ncco thin films , the excess oxygen will occupy the apical oxygen sites to compensate the ce doping . while in the excessive reduction films , the oxygen deficiencies appear at regular oxygen sites in the cuo@xmath7 plane . in our previous work",
    ", we have also found that the extra annealing treatment can cause the hall coefficient shift in the positive direction in the dilute cobalt - doped la@xmath0ce@xmath1cuo@xmath15 thin films  @xcite .",
    "recently , the significant influence of the lattice constant on the oxygen reduction has been investigated by varying the doping concentration or substituting atoms with different radii  @xcite .",
    "it has been found that the decrease of the lattice constant @xmath16 in the _ ab_-plane of the electron - doped cuprates can make the reduction of excess oxygen more difficult .    in this paper , electron - doped la@xmath0ce@xmath1cuo@xmath15 ( lcco ) thin films with different thicknesses",
    "have been synthesized , and their annealing time were adjusted carefully to ensure the highest t@xmath6 accordingly . based on the transport measurement and the x - ray diffraction analysis , we have found that the decrease of the thickness may cause it difficult to create the oxygen vacancies in the films during the annealing reduction .",
    "the optimally doped lcco ( x=0.105 ) thin films with a thickness @xmath17 varying from 17 to 600  nm were fabricated on the ( 100)-oriented srtio@xmath5 substrates by the dc magnetron sputtering method  @xcite .",
    "all the samples were annealed at @xmath18c in vacuum lower than @xmath19  pa , and the annealing time was adjusted to assure the sharp sc transition and the highest t@xmath6 according to their thicknesses .",
    "we have found that the optimal annealing time is almost proportional to the film thickness @xmath17 .",
    "for the transport measurements , each sample was patterned into the standard six - probe hall bridge with 178 @xmath20 m in length and 10 @xmath20 m in width by photolithography and ion milling techniques .",

    "the ac susceptibility is measured in the quantum designed mpms by the zero - field - cooling course and the ac drive field is applied perpendicular to the _ ab_-plane with 1  oe in amplitude and 333  hz in frequency . both the real and imaginary components , i.e. , @xmath24 and @xmath25 , show that the film with larger thickness has a sharper sc transition and a relatively high t@xmath6 .",
    "additionally , the normalized shielding signal @xmath24 increases with the increase in thickness , which indicates that the sc component in the thick films are larger than those in the thin ones .",

    "this indicates that all the samples have quite similar temperature dependences .",
    "however , the ration of the residual resistance ( rrr ) , t@xmath21 and t@xmath26 decrease with the film thickness decreasing from 100 nm to 33 nm . if the sample is ultrathin , e.g. @xmath27  nm , it becomes an insulator no matter how we adjust the annealing time .",
    "the dependence of the resistance and t@xmath6 on the thickness can be attributed to the different influence of the substrate on the films .",
    "the thinner the film is , the more prominent the influence of the substrate on the properties is when @xmath28  nm .",
    "we propose that the influence of the substrate on the properties of the films can be worked out by the oxygen reduction during the annealing process .",
    "however , either the excess oxygen caused by insufficient reduction or the oxygen vacancies induced by the excessive reduction can act as impurities to enhance the scattering and suppress the superconductivity  @xcite . since hall effect is an effective method to disclose the type of the carriers",

    "[ rh ] shows the hall coefficient r@xmath30 of the lcco films with different thickness .",
    "we find that all the samples have an anomalous temperature dependence of r@xmath30 with sign reversals .",
    "since there are two kinds of carriers in electron - doped cuprates  @xcite , the hall sign reversals versus the magnetic fields and the temperatures can be attributed to competition between the hole - like and the electron - like carriers under the regime of the two - band model  @xcite . here",
    ", we will focus on the dependence of the hall coefficient on the film thickness . in fig .",
    "[ rh](a ) and ( b ) at h = 2  t and 7  t , the r@xmath30 curves show quite a similar temperature dependence when @xmath31  nm , respectively , while , in the case of @xmath32  nm , the nonzero hall resistance r@xmath30 shows clear bias from those of @xmath31  nm and shifts to the negative . as mentioned above  @xcite",
    ", the lack of oxygen will introduce a positive hole - like contribution to the hall coefficient .",
    "therefore , the enhancement of the negative r@xmath30 of the thin films with @xmath32  nm can be attributed to the excess oxygen due to the insufficient reduction process . since the annealing time of the films with different thickness",
    "are adjusted to their optimal conditions to get the sharp transition and the highest t@xmath6 , we may conclude that it is almost impossible to get rid of all the excess oxygen in the thin films .",
    "the excess oxygen caused by insufficient reduction in the thin films not only enhances the impurity scattering but also results in the strong negative response of the hall coefficient .",
    "x - ray diffraction diagram for the lcco films with different thicknesses .",
    "the substrate peaks are removed from the curves .",
    "the inset shows the dependence of the @xmath34-axis lattice length @xmath35 on the thickness.,width=302 ]    it is important to make clear that the mismatch effect between the substrate and the film originated from their different lattice constants in the @xmath36-plane , which may lead to the difficult oxygen reduction in the ultrathin films as we have studied above .",
    "[ xrd ] shows the @xmath33 x - ray diffraction of the lcco films with the thickness varying from 17to 600  nm . all the films exhibit good @xmath34-axis orientation and the amplitude of the @xmath37 peak increases monotonously with the film thickness .",
    "we calculate the lattice constant @xmath4 along the @xmath34-axis and show its dependence on the film thickness in the inset of fig .",
    "we find that the lattice constant @xmath4 does not depend on the thickness when @xmath38  nm , while if @xmath28  nm , @xmath4 decreases with the increase in thickness , which can be understood as that the apical oxygen is easy to escape from the lcco samples with the increase of the film thickness  @xcite .",
    "we may notice that the bond - length mismatch or the internal stress due to the small rare - earth atom ln@xmath12 substitution in the electron - doped ln@xmath0ce@xmath11cuo@xmath9 samples will cause it difficult for the oxygen reduction as reported in refs .",
    "@xcite and  @xcite .",
    "since the lattice constants of @xmath16 are 3.905 and 4.010    for the srtio@xmath5 crystal and the optimal doped lcco film , respectively , the mismatch effect between them will be very strong in the ultrathin lcco films , e.g. @xmath28  nm . due to the compression stress from the srtio@xmath5 substrate , the lattice constant @xmath16 of the ultrathin films probably decreases , which may lead to it being more difficult for the oxygen reduction during the annealing process .    regarding the position the excess oxygen occupies in the lattice , higgins  @xcite and yamamoto  @xcite",
    "agree on the apical oxygen site , while riou and richard  @xcite hold out for the o(1 ) site in the cuo@xmath7 plane .",
    "our previous studies  @xcite have indicated that the o(1 ) site vacancies can be caused by excessive reduction in the annealing process for the highest t@xmath6 . here , we want to emphasize that the annealing process on the thin films can remove the unwanted apical oxygen adequately , but the excessive annealing would induce vacancies mostly in the regular o(1 ) site .",
    "we have investigated the transport properties including both the longitudinal and the hall resistances , as well as the x - ray diffraction in the electron - doped lcco thin films with different thicknesses . with the decrease of the film thickness when @xmath39  nm , the rrr decreases and the hall coefficient shifts towards the negative direction .",
    "the x - ray diffraction data reveal that the c - axis lattice constant @xmath4 increases with the decrease of film thickness .",
