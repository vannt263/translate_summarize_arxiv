    "quantum walk ( qw ) was introduced by several researchers of different fields , such as a quantum probability theory , and quantum information theory @xcite . in recent years , as a quantum counterpart of the classical random walk , qw has attracted much attention of various fields , such as quantum algorithms @xcite , probability theory @xcite , physical systems @xcite . from the viewpoint of asymptotic behavior of qws , we emphasize that there are two kinds of limit theorems .",
    "the first one is localization theorem , which we focus on in this paper .",
    "localization is considered as a typical property of discrete - time qws @xcite .",
    "konno @xcite and konno _ et al . _",
    "@xcite investigated localization of inhomogeneous discrete - time qws in one dimension .",
    "let @xmath0 be the random variable of the position of the walker at time @xmath1 . in this paper",
    ", we say that the qw starting at the origin shows localization if its time - averaged limit measure is strictly positive , i.e. ,    @xmath2 the other definitions of localization were discussed in @xcite .",
    "the second one is the weak limit theorem for @xmath3 whose typical expression is described in @xcite .",
    "+ for the wide range of interest in two - phase systems in quantum scale @xcite , qw with two phases can be expected to be attributed to its broad applications to many fields .",
    "we call the qw `` the two - phase qw '' in this paper .",
    "qws are also naturally the systems of choice to explore fundamental issues in quantum physics . for instance , kitagawa _ et al . _",
    "@xcite reported that the experimental realizations of qws with cold atoms , photons , and ions come true non - trivial one - dimensional topological phase including a two phase system .",
    "hence , we expect that the two - phase qw provides the versatile resources for investigating topological insulators which are recently the intense issues of theoretical and experimental approaches as a key to construct quantum computer . in spite of such interest in two - phase systems , any limit theorems for the two - phase qw",
    "have not been described mathematically as much as ever . now preparing strictly analytical results for the two - phase qw may lead to more profound analyzing for the physical systems .",
    "+ in @xmath4 , konno _ et al . _",
    "@xcite introduced a method which solves the eigenvalue problem ; @xmath5where @xmath6 is an @xmath7 unitary matrix , and @xmath8 and @xmath9 are the solutions of the eigenvalue problem .",
    "the solutions of the eigenvalue problem lead to a stationary measure which is closely related to localization for some typical qws in one dimension @xcite .",
    "we take advantage of the splitted generating function of the solutions , and we call the method  the splitted generating function method ( the sgf method ) \" in this paper . using the sgf method , we derive the stationary measure for the two - phase qw with one defect . on the other hand , using the generating function of the weight of the passages ,",
    "we derive the time - averaged limit measure corresponding to localization . here",
    ", we call the method `` the generating function method '' .",
    "we see that the two measures agree with each other when the parameters of the model have specific periodicities .",
    "the fourier analysis @xcite and the stationary phase method @xcite are useful to study position - independent qws",
    ". we can analyze position - dependent qws using the cgmv method @xcite , however , the cgmv method allows for the general discussion of localization properties , that is , the cgmv method provides the time - averaged limit measure at the origin for the typical one - defect qws on the line , however , the analysis is more complicated than the sgf method and the generating function method in general .",
    "we emphasize that it is the first application of the generating function method to position - dependent qw without symmetry for the origin .",
    "the rest of this article is organized as follows . in section [ main ] ,",
    "we introduce the two - phase qw with one defect , the main target in this paper , and present our main results .",
    "then in section [ proof - theo1 ] , we give the proof of theorem [ stat ] .",
    "finally , the proof of theorem [ average ] is devoted in section [ proof - theo2 ] .",
    "let the qw be a one - dimensional discrete time model defined by the set of @xmath10 unitary matrices ; @xmath11 the subscript @xmath12 expresses the position . to consider the time evolution ,",
    "let us divide @xmath13 into two parts as follows ; @xmath14 with @xmath15 we should remark that @xmath16 and @xmath17 express the left and right steps , respectively . here",
    "the walker has a state at position @xmath12 and time @xmath1 , and the state can be expressed by a two - dimensional vector @xmath18 then the time evolution is determined by the recurrence formula @xmath19 in this manuscript , we focus on a one - defect two - phase qw on the line , whose unitary matrices are defined as follows ;    @xmath20 where @xmath21 .    the quantum walker shifts differently in positive and negative parts respectively , and the determinants are independent of the position , that is , @xmath22 for @xmath23 .",
    "hereafter , we call the model  the two - phase qw with one defect \" for short",
    ". we should notice that if @xmath24 , the model becomes a one - defect qw which has been so far analyzed in detail @xcite .",
    "furthermore , if @xmath25 , the model becomes a special case of the qw which has been studied in @xcite .",
    "we should remark that the two - phase qw has a defect at the origin , which enables us to analyze the model simply .",
    "thus , one of the future problems is to analyze a qw which has two phases and does not have any defect .",
    "we will report on the results in the forthcoming paper .",
    "we should recall    @xmath26    and the quantum walker shifts left or right in accordance with @xmath16 or @xmath27 @xcite , where @xmath12 is the position of the walker . here",

    "on the other hand , the coefficients depend on both the position and @xmath71 .",
    "moreover , the results indicate that the stationary measure strongly depends on the parameters of the model , and is not symmetric for the origin .",
    "localization of the qw with one defect is defined by the time - averaged limit measure @xcite . in this subsection",

    "<S> the analytical methods are mainly based on the splitted generating function of the solution for the eigenvalue problem , and the generating function of the weight of the passages of the model . in this paper , we call the methods `` the splitted generating function method '' and `` the generating function method '' , respectively </S>",
    "<S> . the explicit expression of the stationary measure is asymmetric for the origin , and depends on the initial state and the choice of the parameters of the model . on the other hand , </S>",
    "<S> the time - averaged limit measure has a starting point symmetry and localization effect heavily depends on the initial state and the parameters of the model . </S>",
    "<S> regardless of the strong effect of the initial state and the parameters , the time - averaged limit measure also suggests that localization can be always observed for our two - phase qw . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , our results imply that there is an interesting relation between the stationary and time - averaged limit measures when the parameters of the model have specific periodicities , which suggests that there is a possibility that we can analyze localization of the two - phase qw with one defect from the stationary measure .    </S>",
