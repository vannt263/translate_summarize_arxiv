    "clusters of galaxies are the largest gravitationally bound structures in the universe .",
    "the number and mass of the biggest clusters are highly sensitive to cosmological parameters including the mass density @xmath13 , the normalization of the mass power spectrum @xmath14 ( e.g. ,  press & schechter 1974 ; frenk et al .",
    "1990 ; eke et al .  1996 ; sheth & tormen 1999 ) , and the dynamics of dark energy ( e.g. ,  bartelmann et al .",

    "grossi & springel 2009 ) .",
    "understanding the properties of clusters is vital to test theories of structure formation and to map the distribution of cosmic matter on scales of @xmath15110mpc .",
    "theoretical predictions of structure formation deal directly with the total mass of clusters ; measurements are restricted to indirect proxies that can be observed .",
    "contaminating the translation between theory and observation are large uncertainties in the interpretation of galaxy richness , x - ray luminosity / temperature and the sunyaev - zeldovich decrement ( e.g.  bode et al .  2007 ;",
    "leauthaud et al .",
    "weak gravitational lensing , the coherent distortion of galaxies behind a cluster , can potentially provide direct measurements of the total mass regardless of its baryon content , dynamical state , and star formation history .    by measuring the shear ( coherent elongation ) of many background galaxies",
    ", we can reconstruct the two - dimensional ( 2d ) weak lensing convergence map , which is proportional to density projected along each line of sight .",
    "peaks in the convergence map with high signal - to - noise ratio @xmath16 generally correspond to massive clusters ( hamana et al .",
    "2004 ; haiman et al .",
    "since the three - dimensional ( 3d ) shear signal should increase behind those clusters in a predictable way that depends upon only the lens - source geometry , we can also use photometric redshift estimates of the background galaxies ( from multi - band imaging ) to measure the redshift and mass of each foreground cluster ( wittman et al .",
    "2001 , 2003 ; hennawi & spergel 2005 ; gavazzi & soucail 2007 ) .",
    "systematic weak lensing cluster searches have only recently become practicable .",
    "miyazaki et al .  ( 2002 ) used subaru / suprime - cam in excellent seeing conditions to find an excess of @xmath17 convergence peaks with @xmath18 in an area of @xmath19 .",
    "dahle et al .",
    "( 2003 ) and schirmer et al .",
    "( 2003 ) each identified several shear - selected clusters with redshifts @xmath20 determined from two - color photometry .",
    "hetterscheidt et al .",
    "( 2005 ) reported the detection of five cluster candidates over a set of @xmath21 disconnected very large telescope / fors images covering an effective area of @xmath22 , while wittman et al .",
    "( 2006 ) found eight detections in the first @xmath23 of the _ blanco _ deep lens survey .",
    "gavazzi & soucail ( 2007 ) presented a weak lensing analysis of initial canada - france - hawaii telescope legacy survey ( cfhtls ) deep data covering @xmath24 .",
    "they demonstrated that the image quality at cfht is easily sufficient for cluster finding .",
    "miyazaki et al .  ( 2007 ) presented the first large sample of weak lensing - selected clusters in the subaru weak lensing survey , with @xmath25 significant convergence peaks in a @xmath26 effective survey area .",
    "hamana et al .",
    "( 2009 ) reported results from a multi - object spectroscopic campaign to target @xmath27 of these cluster candidates , of which @xmath28 were confirmed ( and @xmath29 were projections along a line of sight of multiple , small groups ) . the main astrophysical systematic effect afflicting weak lensing cluster surveys is the projection of large - scale structure along the line of sight .",
    "random noise is also added due to the finite density of resolved source galaxies and the scatter of their intrinsic shapes .",
    "numerical studies ( white et al .  2002 ;",
    "hamana et al .",
    "2004 ) show that these contaminants significantly reduce the purity of cluster detection .",
    "to improve our analysis , we shall combine our weak lensing results with multi - wavelength imaging .",
    "simultaneous detection of a weak lensing signature plus an overdensity of galaxies with a single red sequence provides an unambiguous cluster identification .",
    "furthermore , 3d lensing tomography using photometric redshifts from the multi - wavelength data can remove the other potential hurdles of : lensing signal dilution by cluster member galaxies , and identifying the redshift of weak lensing peaks when no corresponding galaxy overdensity is apparent .    here",
    "we present a weak gravitational lensing analysis of the @xmath30 cfhtls - wide w1 field , which is sufficiently large to contain several hundred galaxy clusters .",
    "compared to the analysis of the cfhtls - deep survey by gavazzi & soucail ( 2007 ) , our shallower cfhtls - wide imaging ( and lower source galaxy density ) will favor the detection of higher mass , nearby clusters .",
    "the huge increase in survey area over any previous survey is expected to yield many more systems overall . in this paper",
    ", we shall primarily study the properties of the detected clusters , rather than the cosmology in which they are embedded .",
    "for this purpose , we adopt a default cosmological model with @xmath31 , @xmath32 , @xmath33 , @xmath34 , and @xmath35 .",
    "this paper is organized in the following way . in section  2",
    ", we describe the cfht and _ hubble space telescope _ ( _ hst _ ) data used . in section  3 ,",
    "we present the measurement of galaxy shapes in the cfht imaging , and their calibration against measurements of the same galaxies in the _ hst _ imaging . in section  4 , we reconstruct the 2d lensing convergence `` mass map '' signal , and extract a catalog of local maxima that represent cluster candidates . in section  5 , we search for optical counterparts of these candidates , dramatically cleaning the catalog . in section  6 ,",
    "we investigate the full 3d lensing signal around each cluster , further cleaning the catalog when the lensing signal behind spurious peaks does not increase as expected with redshift - but obtaining an independent estimate of the cluster redshift when it does .",
    "we finally explore global scaling relations between cluster mass observables , then conclude in section  7 .",
    "the cfht legacy survey is a joint canadian - french program to make efficient use of the cfht wide field imager megaprime , simultaneously addressing several fundamental questions in astronomy .",
    "each megaprime / megacam image consists of an array of @xmath36 e2v ccds with a pixel scale of @xmath37 and a total field of view of @xmath38 .",
    "the survey used most of the telescope dark and gray time from 2003 to 2008 .",
    "we analyze cfhtls - wide imaging from the terapix t0006 processing run , which is the first to include the complete survey and was publicly released on 2010 november 15 ( goranova et al . 2009 ) .",
    "these data cover @xmath39 in four fields ( w1 , w2 , w3 , and w4 ) of which the @xmath40-pointing , @xmath41 w1 field is the largest , and in five passbands ( @xmath42,and @xmath43 ) down to @xmath44 and @xmath45 .",
    "fu et al .  (",
    "2008 ) showed that the @xmath1-band exposures , taken in sub - arcsecond seeing conditions , provide the best image quality and resolve the galaxy population with highest median redshift .",
    "resolving the shapes of more distant galaxies is vital for weak lensing analysis , since the strength of the shear signal is proportional to the ratio of the lens  source and observer  source distances .",
    "we therefore choose to analyze the @xmath1-band images ( mean seeing @xmath46 ) in the contiguous w1 field .",
    "we also analyze the independent @xmath2-band imaging to check the calibration of our shear measurements .",
    "we also use photometric redshift estimates for source galaxies obtained from the multicolor imaging ( ilbert et al .",
    "2006 ; coupon et al .",
    "2009 ; arnouts et al .",
    "2010 ) .",
    "early releases of smaller regions of the cfhtls have also been used to measure the weak lensing cosmic shear signal ( semboloni et al .",
    "2006 ; hoekstra et al .",
    "2006 ; fu et al .",
    "2008 ) . as the survey size has increased ,",
    "the statistical errors have shrunk , and difficulty measuring shapes at a precision better than the statistical error has so far prevented publication of a cosmic shear analysis of the complete survey . however , weak lensing cluster searches are restricted by construction to regions of the survey where the signal is strongest , and the circular symmetry of our analysis removes the negative impact of additive shear measurement errors ( cf .",
    "mandelbaum et al .  2005 ) .",
    "the _ hst _ cosmos survey ( scoville et al .  2007 ) is the largest contiguous optical imaging survey ever conducted from space .",
    "high resolution ( @xmath47 ) imaging in the @xmath48 band was obtained during 20032005 across an area of 1.64 @xmath49 that also corresponds to the cfhtls d2 deep field .",
    "any galaxies resolved by cfht are very easily resolved by _ hst _ , which therefore provides highly accurate shape measurements almost without the need for point - spread function ( psf ) correction .",
    "we shall calibrate our cfhtls shape measurements against those from cosmos by leauthaud et al .",
    "( 2010 ) .",
    "note that measurements of the shapes of individual galaxies from ground - based and space - based observations need not necessarily match exactly , even without shape measurement errors , because the different noise properties of the data sets may make them most sensitive to different isophotes , which can be twisted relative to each other .",
    "the slightly different passbands may also emphasize different regions of a galaxy s morphology .",
    "however , across a large population of galaxies , these differences should average out , and a comparison of successful shear measurements between the two data sets should agree .",
