    "lithium depletion in gravitationally contracting , fully convective stars of mass @xmath4 ( hayashi & nakano 1963 ; bodenheimer 1965 ) and @xmath5 ( weymann & moore 1963 ; ezer & cameron 1963 ) has been studied for over thirty years .",
    "motivated by lithium observations of main sequence stars in young clusters and the halo ( e.g. , soderblom 1995 ) , many have calculated lithium depletion for stars of @xmath6 both before and during the main sequence ( vauclair et al.1978 ; dantona & mazzitelli 1984 ; proffitt & michaud 1989 ; vandenberg & poll 1989 ; swenson , stringfellow , & faulkner 1990 ; deliyannis , demarque , & kawaler 1990 ) . for stars with @xmath7 , most lithium burns after convection has halted in the stellar core .",
    "accurate predictions of lithium depletion then depend on the temperature at the bottom of the retreating convective zone .",
    "the location of the convective / radiative boundary and the amount of mixing across it depend on opacity , treatment of convection , and rotation ; proper handling of these effects remains an open question .",
    "lower mass ( @xmath8 ) stars are fully convective during lithium burning , which occurs before the star reaches the main sequence . ) that the energy released by its fusion does not appreciably slow stellar contraction . throughout this paper ,",
    "we only consider @xmath9 , as @xmath10 always depletes first and is less abundant in the local ism ( lemoine , ferlet , & vidal - madjar 1995 ) . ]",
    "the effective temperature @xmath1 of a fully convective star determines the contraction rate and is found by matching the entropy at the interior to that at the photosphere ( see stahler 1988 for a review of hayashi contraction ) . for these low mass stars with @xmath11 , the opacities are still uncertain , and there are still debates about the treatment of convection .",
    "these uncertainties have motivated many numerical calculations of lithium depletion ( pozio 1991 ; nelson , rappaport , & chiang 1993 ; dantona & mazzitelli 1994 ( hereafter dm94 ) ; chabrier , baraffe , & plez 1996 ) .",
    "the differing input physics results in different @xmath1 s for the same stellar mass .",
    "for example , dm94 found that , depending on the opacities used , @xmath1 ranges from @xmath12 to @xmath13 for a @xmath14 star .",
    "most calculations agree that @xmath1 remains approximately constant during the fully convective contraction phase .    in this paper , we present a different approach to calculating pre - main sequence ( or pre - brown dwarf ) lithium depletion in gravitationally contracting , low mass ( @xmath0 ) stars . rather than calculate @xmath1 , we calculate the dependence of lithium depletion on @xmath1 .",
    "given @xmath1 , @xmath2 , and mean molecular weight @xmath15 , we can reproduce the results of prior works .",
    "moreover , our approach allows the inferred effective temperature to be used directly in analyzing lithium depletion observations .",
    "efficient convection throughout the star allows it to be modeled as a fully mixed @xmath16 polytrope .",
    "our analytic calculations then yield the age , radius , and luminosity at a given level of lithium depletion .",
    "our results ( equations [ [ eq : fit - allmass ] ] and [ [ eq : fit - highmass ] ] ) can be used to constrain the mass and age of a star from its lithium abundance .",
    "we apply these same techniques to depletion of beryllium and boron in ushomirsky et al .",
    "a number of authors have undertaken detailed numerical evolutionary calculations of contracting pre - main sequence stars ( see burrows & liebert 1993 for a review ) .",
    "low mass stars ( @xmath8 ) remain completely convective at least through the end of lithium burning ( dm94 ) . for an ideal gas ( @xmath17 where @xmath18 is avogadro s number ) the adiabatic relation is @xmath19 , so that an @xmath16 polytrope describes the stellar structure . during later stages of contraction",
    ", electron degeneracy modifies the equation of state by reducing the central temperature below its non - degenerate value .",
    "however , partial degeneracy does not alter the polytropic structure .",
    "the central density and temperature are @xmath20 where @xmath21 accounts for the deviation in electron pressure from that of an ideal gas .",
    "we neglect coulomb and ionization corrections to the equation of state . except during deuterium burning ,",
    "gravitational contraction powers the star s luminosity , @xmath22 , which is independent of the degree of degeneracy .",
    "we define the time coordinate @xmath23 under the assumption that @xmath1 is constant during contraction from a formally infinite radius .",
    "this time therefore differs from chronological age because of the deuterium burning phase and the initial radius on the theoretical stellar birthline ( @xcite ) .",
    "lithium depletion , however , occurs long ( 10100 myr ) after these events , so that if the effective temperature used is correct at the time of lithium depletion , @xmath23 differs only slightly from chronological age .",
    "gravitational contraction then gives the stellar radius and luminosity as functions of time as @xmath24 we define the contraction timescale in terms of the central temperature , @xmath25 which we then compare to the timescale for lithium destruction due to the reaction @xmath26 . over the range of temperatures ( @xmath27 ) appropriate for this work , the reaction rate is @xmath28 where @xmath29 and @xmath30 ( caughlan & fowler 1988 ) and @xmath31 is the screening correction factor ( @xcite ) . raimann ( 1993 ) recently discussed new experimental results at low energies ( @xmath32@xmath33 ) and updated @xmath34 to @xmath35 .",
    "lithium is depleted when the local nuclear destruction time , @xmath36 ( @xmath37 is the hydrogen mass fraction and @xmath38 is the proton mass ) , becomes comparable to @xmath39 .",
    "although the full calculation involves integrating over the star (  3 ) , one obtains a flavor of the calculation by evaluating @xmath40 at the center of the star ( with @xmath41 and @xmath42 ) and equating it with @xmath39 .",
    "this gives a relation for the central temperature @xmath43 at the time of depletion , @xmath44 for example , if @xmath45 and @xmath46 , then @xmath9 depletes when @xmath47 .",
    "the temperature is only slightly different for other masses .",
    "for these temperatures , the reaction rate is extremely temperature sensitive ( @xmath48 ) , so that @xmath49 decreases rapidly as the temperature increases .",
    "hence the transition from no depletion to full depletion occurs rapidly as long as the central temperature reaches these values .",
    "this does not occur for very low masses ( @xmath50 ) , because electron degeneracy pressure dominates the equation of state ( pozio 1991 ; magazz , martn , & rebolo 1993 ; nelson et al .",
    "also , stars with @xmath51 develop radiative cores prior to depletion .",
    "we only discuss stars safely between these limits .",
    "since this depletion occurs on a contraction timescale ( 10100 myr ) , the central temperature during depletion is higher ( @xmath52@xmath53 ) than the temperature needed ( @xmath54 ) at the base of a main sequence star s convective zone to deplete @xmath9 while the star is on the main sequence .",
    "the narrow range of burning temperatures allows the solution of equation ( [ eq : trans ] ) to be approximated as a power law . for the non - degenerate case ,",
    "@xmath55 is @xmath56 at the time of depletion , and @xmath57 is @xmath58 .",
    "the radius at depletion , @xmath59 , is relatively insensitive to @xmath1 but nearly proportional to mass .",
    "these scalings , which are modified only slightly in the full calculation (  3 ) , provide an intuitive picture of lithium burning and a means to evaluate observations (  4 ) once the prefactors are known .",
    "since lithium burns near the center of the star , depleting lithium throughout the star requires mixing lithium - poor fluid outward and lithium - rich fluid inward . for efficient convection , the mixing timescale ( @xmath60@xmath61 is much shorter than both @xmath62 and @xmath40 ; convective mixing keeps the lithium to hydrogen ratio , @xmath63 , fixed throughout the star as the total lithium content decreases .",
    "thus we write the global depletion rate as @xmath64 changing to spatial variables and using the thermonuclear rate defined earlier , we obtain @xmath65 the temperature sensitivity of the nuclear reaction allows us to expand @xmath66 and @xmath67 about their central values . integrating the lowest order terms ( see ushomirsky et al .",
    "1997 for a discussion of the small errors introduced by this approximation ) yields @xmath68 where @xmath69 is a convenient representation of the central temperature .",
    "using equation ( [ eq : tcont ] ) and the fact that @xmath70 , we characterize the stellar state by @xmath71 and integrate from @xmath72 and initial abundance @xmath73 to find the depletion @xmath74 as a function of @xmath71 , @xmath75 where @xmath76 and @xmath77 is an incomplete gamma function .",
    "this transcendental equation is similar to that found from the simple arguments in  2 . for a given depletion @xmath74",
    ", the solution @xmath78 determines @xmath55 .",
    "the radius , luminosity , and age then follow from equations ( [ eq : rstar])([eq : tcont ] ) .",
    "our treatment of degeneracy and screening in equation ( [ eq : exact - depletion ] ) is approximate in the sense that we neglect the slight variation of @xmath79 and @xmath31 with @xmath71 .",
    "instead , we evaluate their values at the time of depletion to solve the resulting transcendental equation .",
    "we discuss this process in more detail in a forthcoming paper ( ushomirsky et al.1997 ) .    although solving the depletion equation ( [ eq : exact - depletion ] ) numerically is straightforward , an analytic fitting formula for the time ( and therefore the radius and luminosity from equations [ [ eq : rstar ] ] and [ [ eq : lstar ] ] ) as a function of depletion is also helpful . the age at a given depletion ( we use raimann s [ 1993 ] rates ; using caughlan s and fowler s [ 1988 ] rates changes @xmath57 by no more than a few percent ) for @xmath80 , @xmath81 , and @xmath82 is @xmath83 { \\rm myr}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the first line of equation ( [ eq : fit - allmass ] ) follows from the simple arguments of  2 , while the expression in square brackets accounts for the onset of degeneracy in lower - mass stars",
    ". a simpler fit , @xmath84 is obtained if degeneracy is not important during depletion ( @xmath85 ) .",
    "these fits agree with chabrier et al .",
    "( 1996 , table 1 ) for masses @xmath86 at 50% ( 99% ) depletion to better than 4% ( 8% ) , 7% ( 17% ) , and 12% ( 25% ) for the radius , luminosity , and age , respectively . ] and [ [ eq : fit - highmass ] ] ) from the stated references .",
    "] we also reproduce the results in tables 58 of dm94 for @xmath87 to better than 3% , 7% , and 15% for the radius , luminosity , and age , respectively .",
    "the strong temperature dependence of the burning rate makes @xmath55 at depletion very insensitive to our approximations .",
    "the central temperature is thus the most accurately determined quantity .",
    "indeed , our @xmath55 s at a given depletion level deviate from those reported in tables 58 of dm94 by less than 2%  ( chabrier et al .  [",
    "1996 ] did not report @xmath55 ) .",
    "our neglect of coulomb and ionization effects ( @xcite ) introduces a small error in mapping @xmath55 to @xmath88 ( roughly , @xmath89 ) .",
    "these errors then propagate into the age and luminosity determination at a given depletion level .",
    "since the age is @xmath90 ( see equation [ [ eq : tcont ] ] ) , the relative deviations in @xmath23 are roughly three times larger than those in @xmath88 .",
    "moreover , any changes in @xmath1 during contraction cause additional uncertainty ( typically up to @xmath91 , see ushomirsky et al .",
    "1997 ) in calculating how long a star takes to contract to a certain radius .    in summary ,",
    "the absolute error of age determination in our calculation is no more than @xmath92@xmath93 under any conditions , and the average discrepancy with published results is about half that amount . in light of these uncertainties , it is important to note that , because the age at a level of depletion is @xmath94 , the typical @xmath91 observational errors in @xmath1 lead to uncertainties in age that are comparable to the deviations of our results from the detailed numerical ones .",
    "our results therefore are adequate for observational work , and have the added advantage of enabling the observer to use the derived @xmath1 and @xmath95 in conjunction with lithium observations to constrain the stellar mass .",
    "this is in contrast to using detailed evolutionary tracks to infer the mass from the star s location on the hr diagram .",
    "as we show in the following section , the inferred mass can be in conflict with lithium depletion .",
    "in addition ( insofar as @xmath1 is nearly constant during contraction ) , our results can serve as benchmarks in comparing and evaluating detailed numerical calculations .",
    "the radii of pre - main sequence stars are typically inferred from @xmath1 and @xmath95 , but ( except in binaries ) masses must be estimated by relating colors to a grid of computed evolutionary tracks .",
    "there are potentially significant uncertainties , both observational and theoretical , associated with inferring masses and radii of stars from these observations . on the other hand , the presence or absence of lithium is an indirect indicator of the central temperature of the star . since lithium does not deplete until a characteristic central temperature ( @xmath96 ) is reached , the lithium abundance can be used to constrain the mass to radius ratio ( cf.equations [ [ eq : rstar ] ] and [ [ eq : fit - allmass ] ] ) .",
    "age determination is , in some sense , secondary to measuring the radius .",
    "since the central temperature is @xmath97 , the additional constraint provided by the lithium abundance measurements ( that are sensitive to the derived @xmath1 ) is most easily exploited by plotting stellar radii versus masses .",
    "figure [ fig : obs ] is a compilation of published mass and radius values of pre - main sequence stars where lithium abundances have been estimated or constrained .",
    "we divide the stars into high ( small circles ) , low ( large circles ) , and undetectable ( triangle ) lithium content bins ( see caption ) . also plotted",
    "are lines of constant depletion , which correspond to nearly constant central temperature , i.e. , @xmath98 .",
    "these lines are relatively insensitive to the effective temperature and divide the graph into an undepleted , a depleting , and a depleted region . the narrowness of the depleting region results from the reaction s strong temperature sensitivity",
    ". we do not continue our lines to high masses where the stars develop radiative cores prior to depletion , nor to low masses where the stars become strongly degenerate .",
    "a few stars appear depleted but lie above the depletion lines . since central burning can not have caused such a low lithium abundance , either the star was born with an anomalously low abundance or the reported masses and/or radii are in error .",
    "a challenge to our assumption of complete mixing would be a detection of lithium in a star lying beneath the depletion lines .",
    "we have found no such measurement for @xmath99 .",
    "we also display in figure [ fig : obs ] those stars for which no lithium is detected and no mass is reported ( filled triangles ) .",
    "we interpret the lack of lithium to imply that more than 95%  has burned and use the inferred radii to constrain their masses ( see table 1 ) .",
    "determinations of @xmath1 from the observed colors are still highly uncertain and depend on the temperature scale and model atmosphere used .",
    "we have not attempted to convert observed colors to a single temperature scale , but have just used the quoted results .",
    "however , our figure depends only on the value of @xmath1 and not the physics needed to infer it .",

    "_    as mentioned above , there are significant uncertainties in relating the observed colors to effective temperatures for low - mass stars , and in using the inferred @xmath1 s and evolutionary models to determine ages of stars .",

    ", @xmath105 always has a minimum ( due to the effects of degeneracy ) , @xmath106 which is the lower bound on age independent of @xmath1 for @xmath107 . because the minimum in @xmath57 is due to the effects of degeneracy , this technique is independent of @xmath1 only for low - mass stars ; this is fortunate because for these stars @xmath1 is more uncertain .",
    "we apply equation ( [ eq : tmin ] ) to the lithium - depleted star hhj 3 in the pleiades ( @xmath108=-2.78\\pm 0.05 $ ] [ @xcite ] ) .",
    "if the absence of @xmath9 in its spectrum implies that this star is more than 99%  depleted , then our calculations imply that it must be older than 100 myr for normal composition ( @xmath109 ) , regardless of its effective temperature or mass ( i.e. , regardless of an evolutionary track . ) basri et al .",
    "( 1996 ) reached the same conclusion by using the evolutionary tracks of nelson et al .",
    "( 1993 ) . that our estimates agree is a consequence of the age constraint ( in this low - mass range ) depending mostly on @xmath95 and being nearly independent of @xmath1 . as noted by basri et al .",
    "( 1996 ) , this age agrees with the age of the pleiades inferred from main sequence turn - off _ with _ convective overshoot ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "in contrast , to share the 6070 myr age of the pleiades inferred from main sequence turn - off _ without _ convective overshoot ( @xcite ) , hhj 3 must have either a hydrogen content @xmath110 ( very unlikely ) or a luminosity 50% higher than that reported .    if both @xmath95 and @xmath1 are known , the absence ( presence ) of lithium sets a meaningful lower ( upper ) limit on both the mass and the age of an individual star .",
    "this method had its first practical application in the work of basri et al .",
    "( 1996 ) , who used it to find a new age for the pleiades and argued that the pleiades faintest members are substellar objects . instead of plotting isochrones and evolutionary tracks on an @xmath95@xmath1 diagram",

    "the observed luminosity is represented by a line with positive slope found from the contraction relation ( [ eq : lstar ] ) , while the limit on lithium abundance is represented by a line with negative slope inferred from the depletion formula ( [ eq : fit - allmass ] ) .",
    "for a given @xmath1 , the star must lie in a swath of the @xmath2@xmath23 plane defined by the estimated luminosity range .",
    "the lithium abundance constraint intersects this swath , setting limits on age and mass .    as an example",
    ", the hatching in figure [ fig : pleiades ] denotes the allowed regions of the pleiads hhj 3 and calar 3 ( which shows lithium and appears undepleted ) ( basri , marcy , & graham 1996 ; rebolo et al.1996 ) . assuming that the stars are coeval",
    ", calar 3 must have a mass @xmath111 , and hhj 3 must have a mass @xmath112 , if the effective temperatures ( @xcite ) are correctly measured .",

    "assuming that a contracting star is fully mixed and that the time it spends prior to hayashi contraction is negligible compared to typical depletion times , we have derived simple analytical relations ( equations [ [ eq : rstar ] ] , [ [ eq : lstar ] ] , [ [ eq : fit - allmass ] ] , and [ [ eq : fit - highmass ] ] ) for the radius , luminosity , and age of a star as a function of lithium depletion .",
    "these formulae demonstrate the dependence of the time of lithium depletion on the mass , composition , and effective temperature of the star .",
    "reasonable agreement with other published theoretical calculations supports the use of our results to evaluate observations .",

    "this method ( complementary to that used by basri et al .  [",

    "these stars are relatively luminous ( @xmath119 ) when depleting lithium and are hence more easily observed .",
    "for example , a @xmath120 star will have depleted 50% of its lithium at about 16 myr , when it has a luminosity @xmath121 ( for @xmath122 ) . because stars with a range of masses will deplete simultaneously",
