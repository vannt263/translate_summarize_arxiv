    "the study of transport and response properties in exactly solvable one - dimensional ( 1d ) correlated fermion systems , e. g. the spinless fermion , hubbard , and @xmath9 models , has long been an important field of theoretical research @xcite .",
    "this theoretical interest has been supported by experimental studies that have found both qualitative and quantitative agreement between thermodynamic , spectral , and transport measurements in quasi-1d materials and the corresponding properties calculated in 1d correlated electron models @xcite .",
    "recently , several comparative numerical and analytical studies have explored the differences in the transport properties between integrable and non - integrable 1d models @xcite .",
    "most of these studies have dealt with generalizations to finite - temperature of kohn s zero - temperature concepts and approach @xcite . in reference ,",
    "the concepts of _ ideal insulator _ and _ ideal conductor _ at _ finite _ temperatures were introduced .",
    "these concepts refer to the temperature dependence of the real part of the optical conductivity @xmath10 , which is given by @xmath11 where we have taken @xmath12 , and @xmath13 being the electron charge .",
    "the quantity @xmath1 is called the charge stiffness and characterizes the response of the system to a static electric field , within linear response theory . according to kohn s zero - temperature criterion",
    ", the value of @xmath14 can be used to distinguish between an ideal insulator @xmath15  and an ideal conductor  @xmath16 .",
    "the quantity @xmath17 is called the regular part of the conductivity and describes the absorption of light of finite frequency @xmath18 by the system .",
    "at finite temperatures , the classification of a given system as an _ ideal conductor _ or an _ ideal insulator _ involves the values of both @xmath1 and @xmath19 as follows : ( i ) if @xmath20 , the system behaves as an _ ideal conductor _ ; ( ii ) if @xmath8 and @xmath21 the system behaves as an _ ideal insulator _ ; ( iii ) and , finally , if @xmath8 and @xmath22 the system behaves as a normal conductor .    motivated by the results of refs . , we compute in this article the curvature of levels @xmath0 and study the effect of the temperature on the charge stiffness of the simplest 1d lattice spinless fermion model , the hamiltonian for which is    @xmath23    where the spinless fermion operators @xmath24 obey the usual anti - commutation relations , @xmath25 means summation over nearest neighbors , @xmath26 is the usual local number operator , @xmath27 is the hopping integral ( normally called @xmath28 but here called @xmath27 to stress the important exact correspondence between this model and the ( anisotropic ) heisenberg s=1/2 chain ) , and @xmath7 is the nearest - neighbor coulomb repulsion .",
    "the model([spinless ] ) is solvable by the bethe ansatz ( ba ) @xcite and has a metal - insulator transition at half filling and zero temperature ( in this model half filling means a fermion for each _ two _ lattice sites , i.e. , fermionic density @xmath29 ) .",
    "the metal - insulator transition @xcite occurs when the first - neighbor coulomb repulsion @xmath7 is greater than @xmath30 .",
    "this is in contrast to the standard hubbard model , where the mott - hubbard transition occurs at half filling for any non - zero value of the on - site coulomb repulsion @xcite ( in the hubbard model half filling means one electron per lattice site , i.e. , electron density @xmath31 ) .",
    "the optical properties of the model ( [ spinless ] ) can be determined by studying the current operator @xmath32 , which is given by @xmath33 as in the case of the hubbard chain , the commutator of @xmath32 with the hamiltonian ( [ spinless ] ) is finite ( i.e. , non - zero ) _ operator _ ( i.e. , not a @xmath34number ) .",
    "this implies that the real part of the optical conductivity has finite - energy absorption , i.e. , @xmath35 .",
    "the exact calculation of @xmath10 requires the full computation of the kubo formula .",
    "the changes of the energy eigenvalues @xmath36 in response to an external flux @xmath37 piercing the ring ( formed by the 1d chain with periodic boundaries ) can be determined by solving hamiltonian ( [ spinless ] ) with the hopping integral modified by the usual peierls phase factor : @xmath38 .",
    "the charge stiffness @xmath1 can be evaluated as a thermodynamic quantity @xcite using @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the usual boltzmann weight , @xmath41 is the partition function , @xmath42 is the curvature of the level @xmath36 , @xmath43 is the mean value of the current operator in the eigenstate of energy @xmath36 , @xmath44 is the free energy , and @xmath45 is the number of lattice sites .",
    "the summation in eq.([dt ] ) is not in general simple to perform , and it must be computed for a given fermionic density @xmath46 , with @xmath47 the total number of fermions .",
    "many recent studies have provided crucial insight into various aspects of this general problem .",
    "first , using the mazur inequality , zotos and collaborators @xcite derived some analytical inequalities for @xmath1 , valid for @xmath48 .",
    "their results imply ideal conductivity away from half filling both for the spinless fermion and hubbard models but are inconclusive for the half - filled band case .",
    "second , for the hubbard model , a recent analytical study by fujimoto and kawakami @xcite , using the thermodynamic ba @xcite , confirmed the exponentially activated nature of the conductivity @xmath49 ( @xmath50 is the mott - hubbard gap @xcite ) at half filling , and ballistic transport of charge @xmath51 ( @xmath52 is a positive constant ) , for low temperatures and away from half filling .",
    "these results have been confirmed by kirchner _",
    "_ combining both monte carlo and ba methods @xcite . as a result of their study , these authors found numerical evidence that some of the conjectures of refs . may not be correct .",
    "third , a recent study @xcite of the `` _ kicked _",
    "@xmath53 '' model has focused on the transition from integrability to `` ergodicity , '' in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "this model is a modification of the hamiltonian ( [ spinless ] ) in which the interaction term @xmath7 is time dependent .",
    "reference related the infinite number of conservation laws @xcite that characterize the integrable model ( [ spinless ] ) to its _ nonergodicity _ , and argued that the deviation from the _ ergodic _ behavior led to the anomalous transport properties observed in refs . .",
    "in particular , ref . pointed out that _ nonergodicity _ implies an infinite transport coefficient and , therefore , ideal conductivity away from half filling . in the approach we develop in this paper , the infinite number of conservation laws manifest themselves in the existence of _ only _ forward scattering among the exact many - body excitations of the system ( called pseudoparticles below ) at all energy scales .",
    "fourth , in the regime @xmath54 ( so that the interaction in eq .",
    "( [ spinless ] ) is parametrized as @xmath55 ) the behavior of @xmath1 has been studied by narozhny _",
    "_ using exact diagonalization and finite - size scaling @xcite .",
    "these authors found ideal conductivity behavior arising from a non - zero fraction of degenerate states in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "it is worthwhile to remark that different authors associate ideal conductivity with different physical mechanisms  conservation laws , nonergodicity , degeneracy of the many - body energy states , forward scattering ( see below )  but at present the deep relation ( if any ) among all of them remains unclear .    in this article , we focus on the regime ( @xmath56 ) of the spinless fermion model in which the metal - insulator transition can occur and compute the needed mean values of the current operator in any eigenstate for the model ( [ spinless ] ) , as well as the respective curvature of levels . in the regime of the metal - insulator transition",
    "we introduce for later convenience the parametrization @xmath57 , with @xmath58 .",
    "to carry out part of our study , we use the formalism of the _ pseudoparticle operator algebra _ , which has recently been presented in detail for the hubbard model @xcite . in brief , the ba solution ( discussed in more detail below ) can be shown to refer to an algebra of operators describing `` pseudoparticle '' excitations .",
    "the energy eigenstates are characterized by the pseudoparticle momentum distributions , @xmath59 . here",
    "@xmath60 with @xmath61 are the quantum numbers that label the different pseudoparticle branches , with @xmath62 for @xmath63 in the ground state .",
    "the ba gives the energy and other operator mean values as functionals of the momentum distributions @xmath59 .",
    "hence , as in references @xcite , we can employ a _ functional deviation expansion _ ( fde ) which refers to the momentum _",
    "deviations _ , @xmath64 , where @xmath65 is the ground - state momentum distribution .",
    "this leads to fde expressions for the energy , current mean values , and other mean values , exactly as in a fermi liquid .",
    "in addition to the central role played by the fde expansions , there are other similarities between 1d quantum liquids and 3d fermi liquids @xcite .",
    "these similarities have justified the introduction of the concept of a `` landau liquid '' @xcite , which includes both the 3d landau fermi liquids@xcite and the 1d luttinger liquids @xcite as specific cases",
    ". there is , however , an important difference between the fermi liquid quasiparticles and the pseudoparticles in 1d integrable models : namely , the collisions between the quasiparticles are not , in general , of forward scattering type only , whereas in the case of the pseudoparticles in integrable models , there is only forward scattering .",
    "moreover , the quasiparticles are not the true many - body excitations of the quantum liquid .",
    "therefore , it is not to be expected that the transport properties behave in the same way for the two types of quantum liquids .",
    "the remainder of the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ lbethe ] we treat the ba equations in the thermodynamic limit and compute the low- and high- energy excitation spectra , and the corresponding energy gaps .",
    "we show that the elementary excitations ( the pseudoparticles ) interact via forward scattering interaction ( the @xmath66function ) only , and we give its explicit form .",
    "we show that the energy eigenvalues are fuctionals of the pseudoparticle occupancies and depend on the excitation spectra and on the @xmath66functions . using the ba equations with a flux we obtain general expression for @xmath67 and @xmath0 , in the low - energy hilbert subspace .",

    "we use our results to discuss the ballistic transport of charge at finite temperature in this model . in sec .",
    "[ lconc ] we discuss our results and present the conclusions .",
    "our approach will be to use the general ba solution @xcite for the hamiltonian ( [ spinless ] ) with a flux @xmath37 through the ring @xcite to compute the mean value of the current operator @xmath67 and the level curvature @xmath0 in a given eigenstate of energy @xmath36 using the formalism of refs .",
    "our results will follow directly from the structure of the hilbert space @xcite of the model ( [ spinless ] ) . in the following ,",
    "we discuss this structure in a finite - sized system and present a simple physical picture for this problem .",
    "it is well known that the model ( [ spinless ] ) can be mapped onto the heisenberg spin - one - half model by the jordan - wigner transformation . for a given canonical ensemble",
    "there are states with both @xmath70 and @xmath71 , where @xmath72 is the total spin and @xmath73 is its projection in the @xmath74 direction .",
    "we shall present the results for those states that are characterized by @xmath70 , but similar results would be obtained for the states with @xmath71 ( for example , the lowest energy state with @xmath75 and @xmath76 is degenerate , in the thermodynamic limit , with the ground state characterized by @xmath77 and @xmath76 ) .",
