    "the peccei - quinn ( pq ) mechanism  @xcite is widely regarded as the most promising approach to solving the strong @xmath8 problem  @xcite in quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) .",
    "not only does it offer a dynamical explanation for the absence of @xmath8 violation in strong interactions , it also gives rise to a rich and testable phenomenology .",
    "in particular , it predicts the existence of a new pseudoscalar particle , the axion  @xcite , which could even form dark matter ( dm ) or at least contribute a sizable fraction to it  @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the pq mechanism on its own is far from constituting a complete theory . at the conceptional level",
    ", it presumes the existence of an approximate global abelian symmetry , @xmath9 , which is spontaneously broken at some energy scale @xmath10 . in order to account for the tight experimental upper bound on the qcd vacuum angle ,",
    "@xmath11  @xcite , this global pq symmetry needs to be of excellent quality , which contradicts with general expectations in the context of quantum gravity  @xcite .",
    "in fact , it is believed that in a consistent quantum theory of gravity all global symmetries are necessarily broken by gravitational interactions  @xcite . at low energies ,",
    "this is reflected in a series of higher - dimensional , planck - suppressed operators which explicitly introduce large symmetry - breaking effects .",
    "it is , hence , unclear what ensures that the pq symmetry is actually of such high quality and not spoiled by gravitational effects at the planck scale .",
    "moreover , the origin of the pq scale @xmath10 remains obscure .",
    "in typical axion models  @xcite , the pq scale usually takes a value close to the axion decay constant , @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is conventionally constrained ( based on astrophysical  @xcite and cosmological observations  @xcite ) to lie somewhere within the so - called _ axion window _ , @xmath14 .",
    "the pq symmetry is therefore likely to be broken at some intermediate scale , which appears surprising , given that one would naively expect @xmath10 to be either tied to the electroweak scale  @xcite , @xmath15 , or , in absence of any other scale , to the string or planck scale , @xmath16  @xcite .",
    "the first of these two possibilities has , however , been ruled out experimentally a long time ago  @xcite , while the second one requires fine - tuning of the initial axion misalignment angle to avoid the overproduction of axionic dm  @xcite .",
    "this leaves one wondering what other new physics might possibly come into question as the dynamical origin of the scale @xmath10 .",
    "the above mentioned problems related to the pq mechanism appear in a new light as soon as supersymmetry ( susy ) is brought into play . just like the pq symmetry",
    ", susy needs to be spontaneously broken at some intermediate energy scale , @xmath17 .",
    "this entails the tempting idea to suppose that @xmath10 and @xmath17 are , in fact , determined by the same dynamics  @xcite .",
    "for instance , we may imagine that susy is broken dynamically by the interactions in some strongly coupled hidden sector .",
    "the virtue of such models of dynamical susy breaking ( dsb )  @xcite is that , in these models , the susy breaking scale is generated without any dimensionful input parameters via the effect of dimensional transmutation , i.e. , it ends up being related to the dynamical scale @xmath18 of the strong interactions , @xmath19 .",
    "if the same strong dynamics are responsible for the spontaneous breaking of the pq symmetry , we then have @xmath20 remarkably enough , this estimate coincides with the range of @xmath17 values that one typically encounters in models of _ pure gravity mediation _ ( pgm )  @xcite ( for closely related mediation schemes , see  @xcite ) . in this framework for the mediation of susy breaking to the visible sector ,",
    "sfermions receive large masses of the order of the gravitino mass @xmath21 via the tree - level scalar potential in supergravity ( sugra )  @xcite , while gauginos obtain one loop - suppressed masses via anomaly mediation  @xcite ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "pgm comes with a number of attractive features at the cost of a slightly fine - tuned electroweak scale : it easily accounts for a standard model ( sm ) higgs boson mass of @xmath22  @xcite thanks to large stop loop corrections  @xcite ; it ensures the unification of the sm gauge couplings , so that it may be readily embedded into a grand unified theory ( gut ) ; and it is capable of providing a viable candidate for dark matter either in the form of winos  @xcite , binos  @xcite or higgsinos  @xcite . at the same time",
    ", it avoids the polonyi problem usually encountered in models of gravity mediation  @xcite , as susy is required to be broken by a non - singlet field in pgm ; it is free of any cosmological gravitino problem  @xcite , as the gravitino decays way before the onset of big bang nucleosynthesis ; and it is in less tension with constraints on flavor - changing neutral currents ( fcncs ) and @xmath8 violation  @xcite , once again because of the high sfermion mass scale",
    ".      meanwhile , a common idea to protect the pq symmetry from the dangerous effects of higher - dimensional operators is to invoke some gauge symmetry which ensures that the pq symmetry survives as an approximate _ accidental _ symmetry in the low - energy effective theory  @xcite .",
    "a particularly attractive choice in this context , which we have recently examined in more detail in  @xcite , is to protect the pq symmetry by means of a gauged discrete @xmath23 symmetry , @xmath24",
    ". such a discrete @xmath23 symmetry may be the remnant of a spontaneously broken continuous symmetry in higher dimensions ( for instance , in string theory )  @xcite ; and it is an often important and sometimes even imperative ingredient in susy model building : it prevents too rapid proton decay via perilous dimension-5 operators  @xcite ; it forbids a constant term in the superpotential of the order of the planck scale , which would otherwise result in a huge negative cosmological constant  @xcite ; and it may account for the approximate global continuous @xmath23 symmetry which is required to realize stable  @xcite or meta - stable  @xcite susy - breaking vacua in a large class of dsb models .    on top of that , a discrete @xmath23 symmetry automatically suppresses the bilinear higgs mass in the superpotential , @xmath25 , and hence allows for a solution to the @xmath1 problem  @xcite in the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) .",
    "in fact , in absence of a bare @xmath1 term , a supersymmetric mass for the mssm higgs fields @xmath26 and @xmath27 needs to be generated in consequence of @xmath23 symmetry breaking .",
    "this can , for instance , be done as in the next - to - minimal supersymmetric standard model ( nmssm )  @xcite , where one introduces a sm singlet field @xmath28 that couples to @xmath29 and which obtains a vacuum expectation value ( vev ) @xmath30 during electroweak symmetry breaking ( ewsb ) . a more minimal and hence more elegant solution , however , consists in allowing for a higgs bilinear term  @xcite in the khler potential ( see also  @xcite ) , @xmath31 where @xmath32 is a dimensionless constant of @xmath33 and which readily yields a @xmath1 term of the order of the gravitino mass , @xmath34 , after @xmath23 symmetry breaking .",
    "this solution to the @xmath1 problem is typically employed in pgm models , where it renders the @xmath1 and @xmath35 parameters in the mssm higgs potential linearly independent , thereby ensuring the successful occurrence of radiative ewsb  @xcite . on the other hand , the term in eq .",
    "is only allowed in the khler potential as long as the total @xmath23 charge of the higgs bilinear @xmath29 is zero modulo @xmath36 . in order to assess",
    "for which @xmath24 symmetries this requirement can be fulfilled , it is important to remember that any discrete symmetry which is supposed to be relevant at low energies should be a good gauge symmetry even at the quantum level , i.e. , it should be free of any gauge anomalies  @xcite .",
    "this implies in particular as a minimal constraint that the fermions of the mssm should equally contribute to the weak and color anomalies of the discrete @xmath23 symmetry , multiplets , so as not to disturb the unification of the sm gauge couplings . as such ,",
    "they , too , should equally contribute to the weak and color anomalies of discrete @xmath23 symmetry , leaving the difference between these two anomalies unaffected  @xcite . ]",
    "@xmath37 - \\mathcal{a}\\left[z_n^r\\textrm{--}su(3)_c\\textrm{--}su(3)_c\\right ] = 0 $ ] . for generation - independent @xmath23 charges commuting with @xmath38 and together with the structure of the mssm superpotential ( supplemented by heavy neutrino majorana mass terms in accord with the seesaw mechanism  @xcite )",
    ", this condition then necessitates that  @xcite ( see also  @xcite ) @xmath39 here , we have introduced @xmath40 as the general symbol to denote the @xmath23 charge of the field @xmath41 and where @xmath42 serves as a shorthand notation for equality modulo @xmath36 .",
    "consequently , only for @xmath43 , the @xmath23 charge of the higgs bilinear vanishes , is not an actual @xmath23 symmetry ; instead it is equivalent to the non-@xmath23 matter parity of the mssm  @xcite . ] which singles out @xmath0 as the only discrete @xmath23 symmetry consistent with pgm and the generation of the @xmath1 term via the higgs khler term in eq .  .",
    "together , the above observations lead to a remarkably consistent picture in the context of pure gravity mediation : _ while the magnitude of the pq scale may be determined by the susy - breaking scale in some appropriate dsb model , the quality of the pq symmetry may be safeguarded by the discrete @xmath0 symmetry required to solve the @xmath1 problem .",
    "_ in this paper , we shall demonstrate that such a scenario is indeed feasible  we set out to construct an explicit dsb model featuring an approximate pq symmetry that is sufficiently protected by an anomaly - free discrete @xmath0 symmetry .",
    "in doing so , we will restrict ourselves to the arguably simplest case , i.e. , we will content ourselves with presenting a minimal example based on strong @xmath44 dynamics breaking susy  la iyit  @xcite . furthermore , to render the @xmath0 symmetry anomaly - free , we are lead to introduce a set of new @xmath38 multiplets , ( and several other discrete @xmath23 symmetries ) could also be rendered anomaly - free solely within the mssm , i.e. , without the need for an extra matter sector  @xcite . ] which obtain masses via their coupling to the susy - breaking sector . here ,",
    "the phenomenological constraints on our model surprisingly single out a unique number of extra matter fields : five pairs of @xmath3 and @xmath4 multiplets with supersymmetric masses close to @xmath45 .",
    "such additional matter states affect the gaugino mass spectrum in pgm  @xcite and thus play a crucial role in determining the composition of the lightest supersymmetric particle ( lsp ) .",
    "this has , in turn , important consequences for dark matter and susy searches at colliders . at the same time , for gravitino masses around @xmath46 ,",
    "our model predicts an axion decay constant @xmath13 of @xmath2 and an axionic contribution to the total abundance of dark matter of at most @xmath47 .",
    "meanwhile , the superpartners of the axion , the axino as well as the saxion , receive masses of the order of the susy breaking scale and hence do not cause any cosmological problems  @xcite . we therefore anticipate our model to offer an appealing solution to the strong @xmath8 problem in the context of dynamical susy breaking , which is consistent with all existing bounds , but which , at the same time , can be readily probed in a number of terrestrial experiments and astrophysical observations .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows : in the next section , we will show how to embed the pq mechanism into the iyit model of dynamical susy breaking . here ,",
    "some of the technical details regarding the vacuum configuration of the iyit model after taking into account @xmath23 symmetry breaking have been deferred to appendix  [ app : vacuum ] . in sec .",
    "[ sec : pheno ] , we will then comment on the quality of the pq symmetry in dependence of the free parameters of our model and discuss the resulting phenomenological constraints . finally , we will conclude and give a brief outlook in sec .",
    "[ sec : conclusions ] .",
    "the iyit model represents the simplest vector - like model of dynamical susy breaking . in its most general formulation ,",
    "it is based on strongly interacting @xmath48 gauge dynamics , while featuring @xmath49 matter fields @xmath50 in the fundamental representation of @xmath48 . at energies below the dynamical scale @xmath18 ,",
    "this theory exhibits a flat quantum moduli space , which is best described in terms of the @xmath51 gauge - invariant composite `` meson '' fields @xmath52 here , @xmath53 is a dimensionless coefficient which is supposed to ensure that the meson fields @xmath54 are canonically normalized at low energies .",
    "according to arguments from _ naive dimensional analysis _ ( nda )  @xcite , it is expected to be of @xmath55 ; but values as small as @xmath56 may perhaps also still be admissible .",
    "similar numerical coefficients are expected to appear in a number of places in the low - energy description of the iyit model . for simplicity",
    ", we will , however , ignore the possibility that these factors could numerically deviate from each other and simply account for the uncertainties in all dimensionless couplings of our model by means of a _ single _ nda factor @xmath53 .    as shown by seiberg , the meson fields in eq .",
    "are subject to the following quantum mechanically deformed moduli constraint  @xcite , @xmath57 where the dynamical scale on the right - hand side of this constraint arises in consequence of nonperturbative effects and where @xmath58 denotes the pfaffian of the antisymmetric meson matrix @xmath59 , @xmath60 ^ 2 = \\textrm{det}\\left(m\\right)$ ] . a convenient way to implement this constraint when studying the low - energy dynamics of the iyit model",
    "is to rewrite it in the form of a dynamical superpotential , @xmath61 \\ , , \\label{eq : wdynpf}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with the field @xmath41 acting as a lagrange multiplier .",
    "unfortunately , the dynamical khler potential for @xmath41 is uncalculable and hence the physical interpretation of @xmath41 is ambiguous .",
    "one possibility to account for this ambiguity is to _ define _ the dimensionless coupling @xmath62 such that @xmath41 is always canonically normalized , irrespectively of its physical status .",
    "more precisely , if a dynamical khler potential for @xmath41 should be generated , @xmath41 would be physical and we would expect @xmath62 to be some @xmath33 constant . on the other hand , if @xmath41 should remain unphysical , we could still introduce @xmath41 as in eq .  , the only difference being that , now , @xmath62 would formally blow up to infinity . in what follows , we will therefore stick to the dynamical superpotential in eq .",
    ", keeping in mind that there are two sensible regimes for the coupling @xmath62 : we should either set @xmath63 or take the limit @xmath64 .",
    "supersymmetry is broken in the iyit model by lifting the flat directions in moduli space by means of appropriate yukawa couplings .",
    "let us introduce a singlet field @xmath65 for each @xmath54 and couple these singlets to the corresponding `` quark '' bilinears in the tree - level superpotential , @xmath66 at low energies , these yukawa interactions then give rise to the following effective superpotential , @xmath67 where we have replaced the high - energies yukawa couplings @xmath68 by their low - energy analogues @xmath69 to account for their rge running from energies high above the dynamical scale to energies below the dynamical scale . for all yukawa couplings @xmath69 being nonzero , the superpotential in eq",
    ".   implies f - term conditions for the meson fields , @xmath70 , which contradict the deformed moduli constraint in eq .  , @xmath71 , signaling that susy is spontaneously broken .",
    "another way to put this is to say that the total effective superpotential at low energies , @xmath72 + \\frac{1}{2 } \\lambda_{ij}\\ , \\frac{\\lambda}{\\eta}\\ , z_{ij } \\",
    ", m^{ij } \\ , , \\label{eq : wtot}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] is of the oraifeartaigh type and , hence , susy is broken via the oraifeartaigh mechanism  @xcite .",
    "an interesting feature of the iyit model , which will be of crucial importance to us in the following , is that the superpotential in eq .",
    "is invariant under an axial @xmath73 symmetry associated with a global @xmath50 phase rotation , @xmath74 , which is anomaly - free under the strongly coupled @xmath48 gauge group . in @xcite , domcke et al .",
    "have promoted this @xmath73 to an exact gauge symmetry , @xmath75 , to point out a possibility how to dynamically generate a field - dependent fayet - iliopoulos ( fi ) d - term in field theory . in this paper , we will now identify the same global @xmath73 as the pq symmetry , @xmath76 , and show that it may very well serve as a basis for the construction of a viable axion model .      in the remainder of this paper",
    ", we shall focus on the simplest version of the iyit model , i.e. , susy breaking via strong @xmath77 dynamics .",
    "the extension of our construction to the general @xmath48 case is straightforward ; it merely requires a bigger notational effort . for @xmath78",
    ", we then have to deal with @xmath79 quark flavors , each consisting of a pair of fundamental quarks fields , @xmath80 and @xmath81 . under the @xmath73 flavor symmetry ,",

    "in fact , relabeling all meson and singlet fields , @xmath54 and @xmath65 , according to their @xmath73 charges , the low - energy effective theory ends up consisting of the following degrees of freedom ( dofs ) , @xmath83    in terms of these charge eigenstates , the effective superpotential in eq .",
    "now reads @xmath84 + \\frac{\\lambda}{\\eta } \\left(\\lambda_+\\ , m_+\\ , z_- + \\lambda_-\\ , m_-\\ , z_+ + \\lambda_0^a\\ , m_0^a\\ , z_0^a\\right ) \\ , , \\label{eq : weffcha}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath85 , where we have renamed the yukawa couplings @xmath69 in an obvious manner and where the pfaffian of the meson matrix can now be expanded into the following polynomial , @xmath86 the f - term scalar potential corresponding to this superpotential exhibits a saddle point at the origin as well as three local minima , in which the pfaffian constraint is either approximately satisfied by the meson bilinear @xmath87 , by @xmath88 or by @xmath89 , with all other meson vevs vanishing .",
    "the potential energies of these three vacua respectively scale with the products of the corresponding yukawa couplings , @xmath90 , @xmath91 , and @xmath92 . as we intend to identify the @xmath73 flavor symmetry with the pq symmetry , we need to make sure that the @xmath73 symmetry is spontaneously broken at low energies .",
    "this is , however , only achieved once the charged mesons @xmath93 and @xmath94 acquire nonzero vevs . in the following",
    ", we shall therefore assume that the product @xmath90 is ( at least slightly ) smaller than @xmath91 and @xmath92 , so that @xmath95 and @xmath96 in the true vacuum .",
    "setting all neutral mesons and singlets to zero in eq .  , we then obtain the effective superpotential describing the fluctuations of @xmath93 and @xmath94 around the symmetry - breaking vacuum , @xmath97 + \\frac{\\lambda}{\\eta } \\left(\\lambda_+\\ , m_+\\ , z_- + \\lambda_-\\ , m_-\\ , z_+\\right ) \\ , .",

    "the vevs of the meson fields @xmath93 and @xmath94 then readily follow from minimizing the f - term scalar potential corresponding to the above superpotential .",
    "for canonical khler potential , we obtain @xmath100 where @xmath101 denotes the positive square root of the geometric mean of @xmath102 and @xmath103 and with @xmath104 parameterizing the suppression of @xmath105 w.r.t .  the asymptotic expression in the limit @xmath64 ( or @xmath106 ) , @xmath107 here , @xmath108 can be interpreted as a measure for the coupling strength of the yukawa terms in eq .  ,",
    "@xmath101 , in comparison to the coupling strength of the lagrange term , viz .",
    "@xmath109 , which arises in consequence of the deformed moduli constraint . for fixed values of @xmath62 and @xmath53 , unitarity and the fact that @xmath108 must not exceed @xmath110 ( so that the meson vevs do not vanish and the pq symmetry is , in fact , broken ) then restrict the yukawa coupling @xmath101 to take a value between @xmath111 and @xmath112 .",
    "consequently , the parameters @xmath101 , @xmath108 and @xmath104 are allowed to vary within the following ranges , @xmath113 it is important to keep in mind that the above results for the meson vevs come with a certain irreducible uncertainty , given the fact that we are unable to calculate the precise form of the khler potential below the dynamical scale . in this sense , the exact parameter relations in eqs .  , and should be taken with a grain of salt , as they may easily receive corrections from the noncanonical khler potential .",
    "on the other hand , we will continue to use the above relations in the following analysis _ for definiteness_. after all , they allow for a _ consistent _ treatment of our model in terms of a well - defined set of parameters with a clear physical interpretation . in other words , in the following , we will study the iyit model for the special case of a canonical khler potential , guided by the notation that this should represent an important _ benchmark scenario for the more general case_a benchmark scenario that we have well under control .",
    "this will , in particular , help us to keep track of the various numerical factors in our analysis and provide us with better estimates for a handful of prefactors which one would otherwise simply take to be `` of @xmath33 '' .    plugging our result for the meson vevs in eq .",
    "back into the superpotential in eq .  , we are able to deduce the susy - breaking f - terms of the fields @xmath98 , @xmath99 and @xmath41 , @xmath114 the parameter @xmath108 can hence also be regarded as a measure for the size of the f - term of the field @xmath41 , @xmath115 here , the fact that @xmath116 can be nonzero in the first place indicates ( perhaps somewhat surprisingly ) that , for @xmath117 , the deformed moduli constraint is actually not exactly satisfied in the true vacuum , @xmath118 where @xmath108 serves again as a useful measure to parametrize the deviation from the situation in the limit @xmath119 ( where the moduli constraint _ is _ exactly fulfilled in the true vacuum ) .",
    "moreover , given the possibility of nonzero @xmath116 , the field @xmath41 may turn out to be the most important one among the three susy - breaking fields @xmath98 , @xmath99 and @xmath41 . according to eq .",
    ", we namely have @xmath120 so that @xmath121 for @xmath122 and @xmath123 for @xmath124 in a nicely symmetric fashion . at this point , we should mention that the authors of  @xcite exclusively focused on the regime of large @xmath62 and hence small @xmath108 , thereby disregarding the possibility that the meson vevs in eq .   could potentially be suppressed . in this paper , we shall , by contrast , refrain from making any such assumption regarding the size of @xmath108 and simply keep @xmath108 as a free parameter in our analysis .",
    "this will allow us to consistently account for the possibility of suppressed meson vevs , @xmath125 , relative to the naive expressions @xmath126 which we expect in the limit @xmath119 .",
    "we emphasize that , adapting this procedure , we are not only able to capture a possible suppression of the meson vevs due to a nonvanishing f - term for the field @xmath41 , but  at an effective , phenomenological level  also a possible suppression due to the uncalculable strong - coupling effects in the khler potential .",
    "this is one of the main reasons why we decide to stick to our parametrization in terms of @xmath108 in the following , despite the uncertainties induced by the unknown terms in the dynamical khler potential .    our results for the singlet f - terms in eq .",
    "now immediately provide us with an expression for the susy breaking scale @xmath127 , @xmath128 which leads us to yet another interpretation of the parameter @xmath108 . from eq .",
    ", we infer that @xmath129 counts what may be regarded as the effective number of `` active '' susy - breaking fields @xmath130 , so that @xmath131 . more precisely , for @xmath132 , the f - term of the field @xmath41 vanishes and susy is solely broken by the f - terms belonging to the fields @xmath98 and @xmath99 . hence , @xmath133 in this case . on the other hand , for @xmath134 , both @xmath135 and @xmath136 are zero .",
    "susy is then solely broken by the f - term of the field @xmath41 and @xmath137 .",
    "correspondingly , intermediate values of @xmath108 interpolate between these two extrema of @xmath130 .",
    "furthermore , we are now able to determine the gravitino mass @xmath45 , which appears as a constant term , @xmath138 , in the superpotential upon @xmath23 symmetry breaking , , which actually enters the right - hand side of this relation in form of a factor @xmath139 .",

    "this gives @xmath145 in conclusion , we find that , as anticipated in the introduction , both the susy breaking scale as well as the gravitino mass turn out to be controlled by the dynamical scale @xmath18 . in order to attain a gravitino mass consistent with pgm , say , @xmath5 , we thus need @xmath18 to be of @xmath146 . in the next section , we shall see how this scale can also be understood as the scale of pq symmetry breaking and , in particular , how it is related to the axion decay constant @xmath13 .      the nonzero vevs of the charged meson fields @xmath93 and @xmath94 in eq .",

    "the number of extra pairs is fixed to be @xmath411 , while the decay constant @xmath13 is generally expected to take a value of @xmath2 .",
    "in this paper , we have demonstrated how the pq solution to the strong @xmath8 problem might be inherently connected to the dynamics of spontaneous susy breaking . to give a concrete example of our idea",
    ", we have embedded the pq mechanism into the iyit model of dynamical susy breaking ( i.e.  into a strongly coupled @xmath44 gauge theory with four matter and six singlet fields ) , which has led us to a particular supersymmetric variant of the ksvz axion model . as a direct consequence of this embedding",
    ", we found that the scale of pq symmetry breaking , @xmath10 , is no longer an arbitrary ( and somewhat mysterious ) input parameter , but rather directly tied to the dynamical scale @xmath18 of the strong interactions in the susy - breaking sector , @xmath537 . as the same dynamical scale also determines the scale of susy breaking in the iyit model , @xmath19 , a pq scale of @xmath538 then implies a large susy breaking scale and , hence , a large gravitino mass , @xmath482 .",
    "the proposed connection between the dynamics of pq symmetry and susy breaking therefore turns out to go very well with the idea of pure gravity mediation .",
    "besides that , the notion of pure gravity mediation is also crucial to our axion model for another reason : in order to protect the pq symmetry from the dangerous effect of higher - dimensional operators induced by gravitational interactions around the planck scale , one has to invoke a protective gauge symmetry  for instance , as proposed in @xcite , a discrete @xmath23 symmetry . among all possible @xmath24 symmetries , pure gravity mediation singles out",
    "the special case of a @xmath0 symmetry , which is the only discrete @xmath23 symmetry that allows to generate the mssm @xmath1 term via a higgs bilinear term in the khler potential . as we were able to show",
    ", such a discrete @xmath0 symmetry then manages to suppress all pq - breaking operators in the superpotential and khler potential up to a high order , thereby ensuring that the pq symmetry is of sufficiently good quality . solely within the mssm ,",
    "however , a discrete @xmath0 symmetry does not represent a good symmetry , as it is anomalously violated at the quantum level by @xmath539 and @xmath540 instanton effects .",
    "therefore , in order to render the @xmath0 symmetry anomaly - free , the presence of further sm - charged is required .",
    "_ is _ anomaly - free and even preserved in the true vacuum .",
    "it is , therefore , neither broken explicitly nor spontaneously by the strong interactions , which retains @xmath23 symmetry as a useful tool to study the low - energy dynamics of the susy - breaking sector ( see our discussion related to eq .  ) . ] for this reason , we have assumed the existence of @xmath349 new quark / antiquark pairs @xmath541 in this paper , which obtain masses of the order of the gravitino mass from coupling to the susy - breaking sector .",
    "provided an appropriate @xmath23 charge , these new quark fields then cancel the @xmath0 anomalies , which puts us in the position to employ the @xmath0 symmetry as a protective gauge symmetry after all .",
    "the axion model presented in this paper comes with a number of attractive conceptional and phenomenological implications .",
    "the extra matter fields , for instance , contribute to the running of the sm gauge couplings , which increases the value of the gut gauge coupling constant . requiring that the sm gauge couplings should unify at a perturbative value therefore puts a lower bound on the mass scale of the new quark fields . for one thing , this constrains the parameter space of our model ( i.e. , it provides us with a lower bound on the axion decay constant ) . for another",
    ", we note that the effect of several new @xmath38 multiplets with masses @xmath542 on the running of the sm gauge couplings might also play the role of a selection criterion in the landscape of string vacua .",
    "of course , such an assertion is highly speculative ; but we have the feeling that it is worth being pointed out nonetheless .",
    "imagine , for instance , that the sm gauge couplings are bound to unify at some @xmath33 value at the gut scale .",
    "the fact that the new quark fields obtain their masses via couplings to the susy - breaking sector may then potentially bias the distribution of different values of the susy breaking scale  maybe the susy breaking scale happens to be very large , so that @xmath482 , simply because otherwise the sm gauge couplings would run over too long a distance between the gut scale and the new quark mass threshold .",
    "this would then alter the ratios of the sm gauge couplings at the electroweak scale and , for one reason for another ( in the context of nuclear and/or atomic physics ) , maybe exclude the possibility of habitable universes .",
    "apart from this perhaps far - fetched speculation , our model also makes a number of predictions which are testable in present - day or near - future experiments .",
    "first of all , the new quark fields may , for instance , be directly detectable in a multi - tev collider experiment . in this context",
    ", it is interesting to remark that our model ( at least in its simplest form ) surprisingly singles out a unique number of extra quark pairs : we have to add exactly five pairs of new matter fields .",
    "remarkably enough , this leads to a situation where the @xmath23 charges of the new quark fields , the @xmath23 charges of the fields in the susy - breaking sector as well as the @xmath23 charges of the mssm fields all look very similar .",
    "for @xmath411 ( and only for @xmath411 ) , the @xmath23 charges of all fields in our model turn out to be multiples of @xmath543 .",
    "whether or not this points at something deep remains to be seen ; but it is certainly an interesting observation .",
    "moreover , we find that a sufficient suppression of all pq - breaking effects typically requires the axion decay constant to take a value not much larger than @xmath530 .",
    "this has several interesting implications for cosmology . to begin with ,",
    "let us remark that , in our model , the pq symmetry should be broken before the end of inflation , i.e. , the pq scale needs to exceed the inflationary hubble scale , @xmath544 .",
    "if this was not the case , dangerous axion domain walls ( with domain wall number @xmath545 ) would form during the qcd phase transition , dominating the energy density of the universe soon after their production  @xcite . however ,",
    "if the pq symmetry is already broken during inflation , we have to pay attention that the isocurvature perturbations induced by the axion fluctuation during inflation , @xmath546 , do not violate any of the stringent bounds derived from the precise observations of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb )  @xcite . for @xmath530 and an initial axion misalignment angle @xmath179 of @xmath33",
    ", this constrains the hubble rate during inflation to a rather small value , @xmath547 .",
    "our axion model is therefore only compatible with small - field models of inflation . or put differently , from the perspective of our model , we are led to expect that upcoming cmb experiments will unfortunately not be able to see any signs of tensor perturbations in the cmb .",
    "that is , if the inflationary hubble rate should indeed be as small as @xmath548 , or even smaller , the tensor - to - ratio is at most of @xmath549 , which is unfortunately out of reach for any planned cmb experiment .",
    "besides that , an axion decay constant of @xmath550 ( in combination with @xmath551 and @xmath552 ) , results in an axionic contribution to the relic density of dark matter of about @xmath553  @xcite .",
    "the remaining dm density is then accounted for by weakly interacting massive particles ( wimps ) in the form of mssm neutralinos in our model .",
    "for this reason , we are confident that both axion as well as wimp dark matter searches may , in principle , be able to find positive signals .",
    "moreover , for @xmath554 ,",
    "the axion mass lies in the mev range .",
    "such relatively heavy axions could , for instance , be searched for in fifth - force experiments searching for axion - mediated long range forces  @xcite or in experiments aiming at measuring the proton electric dipole moment  @xcite .",
    "given the fact that @xmath295 may easily take a value only slightly below the upper bound @xmath555 in our model , @xmath556 , ( see the upper left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : k5 ] ) such experiments look indeed promising .    in summary , we therefore conclude that our axion model not only appears to provide an interesting link between dynamical susy breaking and the pq mechanism , it also gives rise to a rich phenomenology that is going to be tested in current and upcoming experiments .",
