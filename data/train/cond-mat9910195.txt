    "the present contribution is intended to further explore and refine our spin - glass way of looking at low - temperature anomalies in glasses developed earlier @xcite .",
    "the term ` low - temperature anomalies ' ( lta ) refers to a set of observations according to which a number of thermodynamic and transport properties of glassy and amorphous systems have been found to differ drastically and unexpectedly from those of their crystalline counterparts @xcite , when the temperature is lowered to a few degrees kelvin .    in particular , below approximately 1k the specific heat of glassy materials has been found @xcite to scale approximately linearly with temperature , @xmath0 , while the corresponding scaling for the thermal conductivity @xmath1 is approximately quadratic , @xmath2 . both findings",
    "contrast the @xmath3 behaviour of these quantities in crystals . between 1 k and approximately 20k the thermal conductivity displays a plateau and continues to rise as the temperature",
    "is further increased .",
    "the specific heat also changes its behaviour in the 120k regime .",
    "it exhibits a peak if displayed in @xmath4 plots , signifying an excess density of states in that energy range , which is often referred to as the bose peak .",
    "lta are remarkable both for their ubiquity , and for their peculiar pattern of universality and absence thereof in various temperature ranges @xcite ; for reviews , see @xcite and the recent collection @xcite .",
    "the anomalous properties of glasses at low temperatures are usually attributed to the existence of a broad range of localized low - energy excitations in amorphous systems  excitations not available in crystalline materials . at energies below 1k ,",
    "these are thought to be tunneling excitations of single particles or small groups of particles in double  well configurations of the potential energy ( dwps ) .",
    "this is the main ingredient of the phenomenological so  called standard tunneling model ( stm ) , independently proposed by phillips @xcite and by anderson et al .",
    "@xcite . as a second ingredient of the stm",
    ", it is supposed that the local dwps in amorphous systems are random , and specific assumptions concerning the distribution of the parameters characterizing them are advanced to describe the experimental data below 1k @xcite .",
    "excitations at energies between 1k and 20k responsible for the boson peak and ( via resonant scattering of phonons ) presumably for the plateau in the thermal conductivity are believed to be of a different nature , namely localized vibrations in anharmonic single - well configurations of the potential energy ( swps ) .",
    "the existence of such single - well potentials is the main additional assumption of the likewise phenomenological soft - potential model @xcite ( spm ) . within the spm",
    "it is supposed that locally the potential energy surface ( along some reaction coordinate ) can be described by certain fourth order polynomials , with coefficients distributed in a specific way so as to comprise both dwps and swps , the former giving rise to tunneling systems , the latter to localized vibrations .    in both , the stm and the spm , a weak coupling between localized excitations and extended ( phonon ) modes is assumed to describe the phenomenology of heat transport and the anomalous acoustic or dielectric properties of glasses at low temperatures @xcite .",
    "although the stm and the spm describe the phenomenology of glassy lta reasonably well , the situation can not be considered entirely satisfactory .    to begin with , neither model accounts for a _ mechanism",
    "_ that would explain _ how _ the required local potential energy configurations would arise , and how they would do so with the required statistics .",
    "indeed , as we have discussed elsewhere @xcite , the assumptions concerning the distributions of parameters characterizing the local potential energy configurations in either phenomenological approach are at best only partially plausible .",
    "moreover , neither model can explain the considerable degree of universality of the lta , or the observed absence of universality at intermediate temperatures . as phenomenological models for lta",
    ", they also have little to say about relations between low - temperature phenomena and the physics at the glass transition .",
    "finally , there is growing experimental evidence that things may go wrong with the assumptions of the stm ( and the spm ) as the temperature is lowered into the mk regime .",
    "let us mention ( i ) the unexpectedly rapid decay of coherent echos in glasses @xcite , ( ii ) the temperature dependence of acoustic attenuation and dispersion @xcite , ( iii ) unexpected behaviour in the long - time behaviour of hole - burning experiments @xcite , ( iv])the unreasonably large value of 3mk for the minimal tunneling matrix element deduced from specific heat data @xcite and dielectric measurements @xcite , and finally ( v ) the recently reported evidence for a macroscopic quantum states of tunneling systems in glasses below 5mk @xcite  all pointing towards the necessity for a better understanding of interaction effects in glasses at ( very ) low temperatures .",
    "it is with these observations in mind that our model based spin - glass way of looking at low - temperature anomalies in glasses attempts to fill a gap , and we believe it to carry considerable potential to clarify at least some of the unresolved issues that have emerged lately .    our approach is based on a born von karman expansion of the interaction potential of a glassy system about a set of reference positions , in which glassy aspects are modeled by taking the harmonic contribution within this expansion to be random .",
    "we derive the justification for such a procedure from the observation of universality : since the low - temperature anomalies observed in amorphous systems are apparently to a large extent insensitive to the the detailed form of the interaction , _ any _ interaction might be taken as a starting point , as long as it does give rise to a glassy low - temperature phase .",
    "the approach leads to a class of models of spin - glass type which exhibit both , glassy low  temperature phases , and double- and single - well configurations in their potential energy .",
    "the distribution of parameters characterizing the local potential energy configurations can be _ computed _ , and differ from those assumed in the standard tunneling model and its variants .",
    "still , the low - temperature anomalies characteristic of amorphous systems are reproduced , and we are able to distinguish properties which can be expected to be universal from those which can not .    we have organized our material as follows . in section 2",
    "we briefly describe the original variant of our approach and describe the main results derived from it .",
    "section 3 introduces a refined version in which the expansion at the harmonic level is modified to respect the principle of global translational invariance , from which we derive new insights concerning the relation between the original particle - particle interaction and the distribution of parameters characterizing the local potential energy configurations .",
    "section 4 is devoted to main results , and and section 5 to concluding remarks .",
    "we begin by briefly describing the main ingredients of our original model , referring to @xcite for details , numerical results , and illustrations .    in the original variant of our spin - glass approach to glassy low - temperature anomalies , we suggested to consider the following hamiltonian as a candidate for the description of a set of particles forming a glassy system , = _",
    "i=1^n + u_int(\\{u_i } )  , with an interaction energy given by u_int(\\{u_i } ) = - _ ij j_ij u_i u_j + _",
    "i g(u_i )  , [ uint ] in which glassy aspects are modeled by taking the the @xmath5 to be random . on ",
    "site potentials of the form g(u ) = u^2 + u^4 [ gv ] are included to stabilize the system as a whole . through the harmonic term in @xmath6 ,",
    "the parameter @xmath7 controls the number of modes that are unstable at the harmonic level of description .",
    "the parameter @xmath7 may be fixed , or chosen according to some non - degenerate distribution as well ( see below ) .",
    "the description is in terms of _ localized _ degrees of freedom , i.e. , the @xmath8 are interpreted as deviations of particle positions from a given set of reference positions as in a a born von karman expansion known from the dynamical theory of crystalline solids .",
    "thus , the system is assumed to be already in a solid state , and no attempt to provide a faithful description of the liquid phase is made .",
    "the random interactions are chosen in such a way that the system can be analyzed within replica mean - field theory , e.g. , as in the sk model @xcite .",
    "it implies that the potential energy surface of the system can be represented as a sum of effective independent single - site potential energies @xmath9 containing random parameters , u_int(\\{u_i } ) _ i u_eff(u_i )  .",
    "[ sumui ] in the replica symmetric ( rs ) approximations these potentials are of the form @xcite u_eff(u ) = - h_eff u -j^2 c u^2 + g(u )  , [ urs ] with h_eff = h_rs = j_0 p + j z [ hrs ] and @xmath10 . here",
    "@xmath11 denotes a macroscopic polarization , and @xmath12 and @xmath13 the diagonal and off - diagonal entries of the rs edwards - anderson order parameter matrix .",
    "apart from randomness that may be present in @xmath14 , the effective single - site potentials contain a single random parameter , viz .",
    "the gaussian distributed effective fields @xmath15 having mean @xmath16 and variance @xmath17 .",
    "the parameters of @xmath11 , @xmath13 and @xmath18 characterizing the @xmath19 ensemble are determined self  consistently through a set of saddle point equations . introduced in@xcite in favour of the interaction scale @xmath20 . it should be no problem for the reader to translate results whenever desired . ]",
    "the model exhibits non - ergodic low - temperature phases , which may be glassy or polarized , depending on the parameters @xmath21 and @xmath20 ; the glass - transition temperature ( or the transition temperature into the polarized phase ) depends on @xmath7 as well .",
    "replica symmetry breaking ( rsb ) occurs at low temperatures and small @xmath7 , and has been analyzed within a one - step replica - symmetry breaking ( 1rsb ) approximation in @xcite .",
    "its main effect is to modify the @xmath15distribution , and in particular to reveal correlations between the @xmath15 and whatever randomness one might have considered for the @xmath14 .",
    "the relevance of these results for glassy lta derives from the fact that the @xmath19 acquire a harmonic term @xmath22  entirely of collective origin  that renormalizes the local harmonic restoring force produced by @xmath14 .",
    "hence for j^2 c > a_2 the total harmonic contribution to @xmath19 becomes convex downward near the origin @xmath23 , so that for sufficiently small @xmath15 the effective single - site potential @xmath19 attains a dwp  form , which is of collective origin .",
    "the existence within the ensemble of effective single - site potentials of a spectrum of dwps with a broad distribution of asymmetries is mainly responsible for the appearance of glassy lta via low - energy tunneling excitations with a virtually constant density of states ( dos ) at low energies , giving rise to the well - known linear temperature scaling of the specific heat at low temperatures .",
    "higher order excitations in dwps and quasi - harmonic excitations in swps give rise to a peak in the dos , and consequently to a bose peak .",
    "these results were presented and discussed in detail in @xcite .",
    "let us close this section with a few remarks concerning the distribution of parameters in the effective single - site potentials .",
    "if we choose the parameter @xmath7 in ( [ uint ] ) , ( [ gv ] ) to be fixed and non - random , the effective single - site potentials @xmath24 contain only a single random parameter , namely the effective field @xmath15 , in contrast to the stm and the spm , both of which assume two randomly varying parameters . indeed , whereas the low - temperature specific heat comes out correctly without a randomly varying harmonic contribution to @xmath14 , dynamic properties such as ultrasound attenuation do require a broad @xmath7-distribution in order to be reproduced correctly @xcite",
    "while an assumption of this kind is natural within our approach in view of the fact that the harmonic contribution to @xmath14 might have been omitted in favour of diagonal entries @xmath25 in the ( random ) interaction matrix , it still creates the ( awkward ) need for an independent hypothesis concerning their distribution .",
    "we consider this awkward to a higher degree , as it affects _ local _ quantities , whereas assumptions about the @xmath5-distribution for @xmath26 contribute to the physics only via global _ collective _ effects less sensitive to details of the underlying assumptions .",
    "we now describe a modification of the above setup in which the need for an independent hypothesis concerning the distribution of _ local _ variables is avoided , while at the same time having the additional benefit of providing an element of physics that had been missing in our original formulation .    to wit , the interpretation we have given in support of the ansatz ( [ uint ] ) is that the first harmonic contribution originates from a born von karman expansion of the interaction energy about an ( unknown ) set of reference positions . within such an interpretation ,",
    "however , a bona - fide interaction matrix ought to respect the principle of global translational invariance  a feature that had been missing in our original approach .",
    "one way of enforcing this principle is to require @xmath27 for _ all _ @xmath28 , entailing that the diagonal entries @xmath25 of the interaction matrix are _ not independent _ of the off - diagonal ones : @xmath29 . in other words ,",
    "translational invariance fixes the diagonal entries of the @xmath20-matrix solely in terms of true interaction contributions .",
    "it turns out that this rather slight modification has pronounced effects on the structure of the theory , which we have only just begun to explore .    investigating the consequences of this idea quantitatively we choose a slightly different formulation , replacing ( [ uint ] ) by u_int(\\{u_i } ) = _ i , j j_ij ( u_i - u_j)^2 + _ i g(u_i )  . [ uintn ] it has the property that a global translation @xmath30 ( for all @xmath28 ) leaves the first contribution invariant , irrespectively of the choice of the @xmath5 . as in @xcite",
    "we take the @xmath5 to be gaussians , and we adhere to @xmath14 being non - random and of the form ( [ gv ] ) , serving stabilizing purposes .",
    "the on - site potentials @xmath14 do , of course , break translational invariance .",
    "however , we have also begun to look at variants in which the stabilizing contributions are themselves chosen in a translationally invariant form ; results will be presented elsewhere .    within a replica mean - field analysis ,",
    "we now need additional order parameters beyond the polarization and the matrix of edwards - anderson order parameters to characterize the collective properties of the system , namely three replica correlations @xmath31 , and four replica correlations @xmath32 , the former , however only for @xmath33 , the latter either for @xmath34 or for @xmath33 and @xmath35 .",
    "so far we have studied the system only in a rs approximation .",
    "details will be presented elsewhere .",
    "here we only state the main results . in rs",
    "one assumes @xmath36 , @xmath37 and @xmath38 for @xmath39 as before , and in addition @xmath40 , @xmath41 , and @xmath42 , @xmath43 for @xmath39 .",
    "it turns out that the four replica quantities cancel in rs expressions .",
    "the remaining order parameters are given as solutions of @xmath44 here @xmath45 denotes an average over two uncorrelated standard gaussians @xmath46 and @xmath47 , while @xmath48 is a thermal average corresponding to the rs single ",
    "site potential u_eff(u ) = - h_eff u + k_eff u^2 + g(u )  , [ ursn ] with h_eff = j_0 p - j^2 c_r + j p y + j z [ hrsn ] and k_eff = j_0 - j^2 c + j y  , [ krsn ] with @xmath49 as before , and @xmath50 .",
    "note that the structure of the theory is now no longer sk - like as in our original version .",
    "in particular , by enforcing translational invariance at the harmonic level of the born von karman expansion , we now have two random variables characterizing the local effective potentials instead of one ( on top of whatever local randomness one might wish to consider in the stabilizing on - site potentials @xmath14 ) .",
    "we now turn to results .",
    "the main properties of the system are : ( i ) it exhibits a transition into a glassy phase with @xmath51 at low temperatures ( and small @xmath7 ) .",
    "( ii ) at sufficiently large @xmath21 , the transition is into a phase with macroscopic polarization @xmath52 .",
    "( iii ) as in the original setup , the transition into the glassy phase is continuous .",
    "( iv ) in phases without macroscopic polarization we have @xmath53 . ( v ) though we have not yet performed the stability analysis , we expect rsb to occur at low temperatures ( and small @xmath7 ) .    with respect to the appearance of low - temperature anomalies ,",
    "the following features deserve mention : ( i ) the potential energy landscape as represented by the ensemble of effective single - site potentials ( [ ursn])-([krsn ] ) exhibits dwps and swps .",
    "( ii ) the ensemble is now characterized by _ two _ random variables , a random effective field @xmath15 , and a randomly varying contribution @xmath54 to the harmonic force constant . as a consequence , dwps will occur with a broad distribution of asymmetries and barrier heights , and both ` soft ' and ` hard ' swps will be observed .",
    "( iii ) in phases with @xmath52 the effective field @xmath15 and the harmonic force constants @xmath54 are correlated already in rs ; we expect correlations between them to emerge irrespective of the value of the macroscopic polarization through rsb effects , much like in the original setup @xcite .    at this point",
    "it is perhaps appropriate to connect our results with those of simulations performed to locate and characterize dwps in lennard jones systems @xcite .",
    "dwps observed in such systems can be parameterized ( along the reaction path ) by fourth order polynomials of the form @xmath55 ( or some equivalent form obtainable through shifts of coordinates ) .",
    "it is to be noted that such simulations will not have access to the full range of @xmath56-triples owing to the non - linear constraint @xmath57 which characterizes dwps , making it difficult to estimate the full distribution or to decide with confidence whether empirical correlations observed between the parameters are solely due to the nonlinear constraint that defines the data set or of deeper origin . for the model considered in the present paper",
    ", we have the chance to compare such numerical results with analytic predictions , e.g. with the marginal distributions of @xmath58 and @xmath59 _ conditioned on finding dwps_. to compare with the theory , we have to identify @xmath60 , @xmath61 and @xmath62 .",
    "if we assume , for instance , a non - random @xmath63 and fix the energy scale by choosing @xmath64 , and furthermore specialize to @xmath65 , entailing @xmath66 , we obtain the following conditioned marginal probability densities , -1 cm p(d_1 | dwp ) = ( - ) erfc ( ) and -1 cm p(d_2 | dwp ) = ( - ) erf ( )  .",
    "these are compared with simulation results in figure 1 . for @xmath58",
    "the agreement is quite good , though not for @xmath59 .",
    "remaining discrepancies are more likely due to rsb effects ( which induce a - priori correlations not related to the non - linear constraints ) than to finite size effects .",
    "indeed , a major effect of rsb is expected to be a reduction of the value of @xmath18 @xcite , which could already account for much of the observed discrepancy in the @xmath59-distribution .",
    "it should be interesting to see , how far our results might eventually carry to help rationalizing the findings in lennard jones systems .",
    "[ f.fp ]    continuing the list of results with a bearing on lta : ( iv ) as dwps in the glassy phase ( and in polarized phases ) , occur with a broad spectrum of asymmetries ( generated by the @xmath15-distribution ) they give rise to a broad spectrum of low - energy tunneling excitations with a nearly constant dos , and thereby to the universal low - temperature anomalies of specific heat and thermal conductivity .",
    "( v ) as in the original setup , higher order excitations in dwps and quasi - harmonic excitations in swps occur with a peaked dos , producing a bose peak .",
    "( vi ) because of the unbounded @xmath67-distribution ( gaussian in rs ) , we do no longer see a possibility of having amorphous phases _ without _ dwps , unlike in the original setup .",
    "( vii ) our previous analysis @xcite , as to which low - temperature properties might be universal ( those related to tunneling excitations ) and which not ( those related to bose peak phenomena ) , remains unaffected by the modifications of the present setup .",
    "( viii ) last but not least , the proposal ( [ uintn ] ) embodies for the first time a _ mechanism to generate a glassy potential energy landscape with an ensemble of swps and dwps entirely in terms of interactions at the microscopic level via collective effects _ , in which the distribution of both asymmetries and barrier heights of dwps is amenable to analytic characterization and follows solely from assumptions about microscopic interactions .",
    "we regard this general qualitative result as perhaps one of the most significant advances contained in the present contribution . indeed , whereas there have always been plausible arguments concerning relevant features of the distribution of asymmetries of dwps responsible for the lta ( broad , symmetric smooth , hence nearly constant in the interesting energy range ) , such arguments have been missing for the distribution of barrier heights ( or tunneling matrix elements ) ; within phenomenological modeling , it was always necessary to _ guess _ these distributions in a way that gets the main physics correct . within our refined approach",
    "there is no longer any need for guesswork at this level ; everything follows from assumptions about the interactions at the microscopic level via collective effects ( and should  in view of the universality of glassy lta  not critically depend on details of these assumptions ) .",
    "we are , of course , aware that this statement ought to be checked in greater detail than we have so far been able to do .",
    "whether the recent problems with the interpretation of some experiments at very low temperatures which we mentioned in our introduction are related to the fact that the above - mentioned guesses concerning tunneling matrix elements ( or concerning the absence of correlations between parameters characterizing local potential energy configurations ) have not been entirely correct , or whether these problems point to more fundamental issues , we can at present not tell , as we have not yet been able to address these problems within the refined formulation of our spin - glass approach presented above .",
    "the fact that the possibility for having phases without dwps virtually disappears when global translational invariance is taken into account within a born von karman expansion of the interaction energy , casts some doubt on the interpretation of the low internal friction results of liu et al .",
    "@xcite as being indicative of an amorphous system _ without _ low - energy tunneling excitations . while the density of such excitations may indeed be unusually low in the a - si samples of liu et al .",
    ", amorphous systems without dwps appear to be extremely unlikely within our new perspective .",
    "this issue certainly deserves deeper investigation .    among the interesting problems within reach of our approach we might mention in particular ( i ) an analysis of collective quantum effects @xcite via a full - fledged quantum statistical treatment of our spin - glass type models @xcite , ( ii ) a deeper understanding of relations between lta and the phenomenology at the glass transition , ( iii ) an investigation of potential energy landscapes which respects the three - dimensional nature of deviations from reference positions in view of possible consequences for magnetic field effects and aharonov - bohm phases in glasses @xcite , replacing ( [ uintn ] ) by @xmath68 , in which @xmath69 and @xmath70 label the three cartesian components of the @xmath71 , ( iv ) the investigation of dynamic effects in the vicinity of the glass - transition . in this respect",
    "finally note that  the glass transition in the present setup being continuous  there is still need for improvements on the modeling side .    *",
