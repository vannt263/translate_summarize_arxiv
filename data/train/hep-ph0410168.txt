    "the step in the real part represents an effective attraction , which helps bind any ` molecular ' state such as that suggested by braaten and t \" ornqvist .",
    "if the net effect of this attraction and meson exchanges is strong enough , a bound state appears .",
    "experimentally , the @xmath9 peak is at the @xmath169 threshold , not the threshold for charged particles .",
    "this charge dependence can arise from a combination of @xmath15 , @xmath70 and @xmath170 exchanges .",
    "a large isospin violation is then inevitable , since the @xmath36 phase shift changes by @xmath139 over @xmath140 mev ; this is only half the mass difference between the neutral and charged thresholds .",
    "isospin violation is consistent with the observed decays to @xmath89 .",
    "for this reason , the second cusp at the @xmath171 threshold is not shown on fig .",
    "2 , though it could in principle be present .",
    "the height of the cusp depends on the actual scattering length ; the cusp gets wider as @xmath165 gets smaller .",
    "a scenario worth consideration is that there is a regular charmonium @xmath37 state at 3941 mev , and in addition a threshold cusp or ` molecular ' state at the @xmath36 threshold .",
    "if @xmath15 exchange plays a strong role , as t \" ornqvist suggests [ 16 ] , it will produce a tensor interaction which mixes s and d - waves , as in the deuteron . in the next section , amplitudes will be given for the d - wave possibility .",
    "that mixing could well be absent for a pure cusp , and might allow a distinction between a cusp and a bound state .",

    "this requires good mass resolution and quite high statistics .",
    "charmonium radial excitations with @xmath90 or @xmath91 are likely to have decays to @xmath35 and @xmath325 , so information on these channels is important . for spin 0 , production and decay are isotropic . for spin 2 , there is an intensity dependence @xmath326 , where @xmath327 is the angle between @xmath324 and the direction of the recoil kaon in the rest frame of @xmath39 .",
    "however , the weak process @xmath328 is first forbidden , so the @xmath91 state may be suppressed there .    searches for open channels such as @xmath141_{l=1}$ ] are important . a knowledge of the rate of this process and that to @xmath36 would allow a proper calculation of the magnitude to be expected from a cusp .",
