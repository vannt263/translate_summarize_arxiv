    "optical , electrical , and mechanical dissipation in nanoscale devices produces heat accumulation that can result in structural damage and poor performance . understandably , heat management constitutes an important aspect when designing thermoelectric @xcite , optoelectronic @xcite , electromechanical @xcite , and photovoltaic @xcite elements",
    "however , the relatively slow thermal conduction in most materials @xcite imposes a serious limitation . finding new means of cooling nanostructures is therefore critical .",
    "an interesting possibility is provided by coupling to radiative degrees of freedom .",
    "indeed , the absorption and emission of radiation by a material structure contributes to reach thermal equilibrium with other surrounding structures and the electromagnetic environment .",
    "this is the dominant cooling channel for thermally isolated structures @xcite , in which energy is released through the emission of photons with wavelengths @xmath1 ( i.e. , the thermal wavelength at temperature @xmath2 ) . when the structures are separated by vacuum gaps of large size compared with @xmath3 , the planck and kirchhoff laws determine the exchanged power @xcite .",
    "in contrast , for neighboring objects separated by a small distance compared with @xmath3 , radiative heat transfer is dominated by evanescent waves @xcite .",
    "as these waves are incapable of propagating energy , their associated transfer rates can exceed the black - body limit by several orders of magnitude , enhanced by near - field coupling of resonances supported by the nanostructures , thus emerging as a potentially relevant transfer mechanism in solid state devices .",
    "following pioneering observations of near - field radiative energy transfer between two conducting plates @xcite , a theoretical explanation was offered @xcite based on the effect of thermal fluctuations in the electrical current of the involved surfaces .",
    "further experimental @xcite and theoretical @xcite studies have corroborated this interpretation of radiative heat transfer between structures of varied morphologies .",
    "this subject has generated fundamental insights that include important corrections due to nonlocal @xcite , phonon @xcite , and photonic band @xcite effects , as well as magnetic polarization @xcite .",
    "additionally , retardation , radiation emission , and crossed electric - magnetic terms in the optical response have been shown to strongly modify the transfer power @xcite . however , the so far observed and predicted transfer rates are slow compared with dissipative transport through the surrounding media , in which heat can cause undesired effects .    in this work",
    "we exploit the extraordinary optical and thermal properties of graphene to show that ultrafast radiative heat transfer can take place between neighboring nanoislands .",
    "the commonly accepted scheme for dissipation of the thermal energy produced by electronic and optical inelastic losses ( i.e. , energy transfer to valence and conduction electrons of the system , followed by relaxation into phonons and subsequent heat flow into the surrounding media ) is here challenged by the radiative transfer mechanism taking place between neighboring structures within femtosecond timescales , thus overcoming electron relaxation into the lattice . using attainable graphene nanostructure designs , we find that ultrafast radiative heat transfer produces thermalization of two neighboring islands that results in @xmath050% of the electronic heat of the hot one being radiatively transferred to its colder neighbor . this extraordinary phenomenon is made possible by the large plasmonic field concentration that mediates the coupling between the neighboring graphene structures , as well as by the low specific electronic heat of this material @xcite .    the competing mechanism ( relaxation into phonons ) was initially thought to be rather slow in graphene @xcite ( nanosecond scale ) , a prediction that was subsequently corrected to much shorter timescales ( picoseconds ) due coupling of hot charge carriers to optical phonons @xcite and so - called supercollision cooling @xcite .",
    "the latter is consistent with experimental observations @xcite .",
    "recent calculations have also identified a remarkably fast rate of radiative transfer between graphene films @xcite , graphene nanoribbons @xcite , and extended heterostructures of graphene and hexagonal bn @xcite , although all of them involve picosecond or even longer timescales .",
    "much faster transfer rates are required in order to prevent most of the electronic heat from being absorbed into phonons .",
    "we accomplish such a goal in this paper by resorting to graphene nanostructures capable of sustaining plasmons within an energy range that is commensurate with @xmath4 .    as an additional advantage",
    ", the large electrical tunability of graphene enables the active control of these phenomena . in a related context , electrical modulation of thermal emission of radiation has been accomplished in gated nanostructured graphene @xcite , while an optical - to - thermal converter has been proposed to be capable of efficiently transforming an optical pump into light emitted at longer mid - infrared wavelengths @xcite .",
    "electrical control of radiative heat transfer between graphene - coated surfaces or between extended graphene and other materials has been also proposed @xcite . in a similar fashion ,",
    "the ultrafast radiative heat transfer phenomenon here investigated can be actively switched on and off by gating the graphene structures .",
    "we focus on the system depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , consisting of two parallel coaxial graphene nanodisks of diameters @xmath5 and @xmath6 , separated by a distance @xmath7 between carbon planes , doped to fermi levels @xmath8 and @xmath9 , and having electronic temperatures @xmath10 . for simplicity ,",
    "we consider the disks to be placed in vacuum , as the conclusions of this work remain the same when the disks are surrounded by a dielectric material of moderate permittivity ( e.g. , @xmath11 ) .",
    "heat is radiatively transferred from the hotter disk to the colder one as a result of thermal fluctuations in both disks , whose interaction is mediated by their self - consistent electromagnetic response .",
    "in fact , for the small size of the structures under consideration compared with the thermal wavelengths @xmath12 ( with @xmath13 ) , retardation and magnetic response effects can be dismissed , so we only need to deal with charge fluctuations and their coulomb interaction .",
    "we calculate the heat transfer power ( htp ) as the net balance of the work done by the thermally fluctuating charges of the hotter disk on the colder one minus the work done on the former by the fluctuating charges of the latter .",
    "this leads to a classical electromagnetic expression involving thermal fluctuations , which are evaluated by means of the fluctuation - dissipation theorem @xcite .",
    "a detailed self - contained derivation is offered in the methods section , leading to a compact expression [ eq .",
    "( [ p1 ] ) ] that is proportional to the integral over the exchanged frequency @xmath14 .",

    "incidentally , the leading @xmath26 factor reflects the fact that @xmath18 and @xmath27 modes yield the same contribution .    in this formalism , the optical response of graphene",
    "is described through its surface conductivity @xmath28 , for which we adopt the local - rpa model @xcite [ see eq .",

    "we also observe a mild dependence of the htp on the value of the intrinsic electronic decay time ( fig .",

    "additionally , we find good convergence of the htp with the number of @xmath18 s and pwfs used in the calculations ( fig .",

    "their htp is much smaller than for graphene .",
    "in fact , plasmons in the graphene disks lie in the mid - infrared region for the parameters under consideration ( i.e. , they energies are commensurate with @xmath44 ) , while those of the gold disks appear at much higher energies , and thus do not contribute efficiently to the heat transfer .",

    "the electronic heat capacity provides a relation between the temperature and the amount of energy strored in the electron gas . in this respect , graphene is also advantageous relative to traditional plasmonic materials such as gold because its heat capacity is orders of magnitude smaller [ fig .",

    "the evolution is along the direction of the arrows , with positions at specific times indicated by the dashed curves .",
    "interestingly , the evolution toward the diagonal ( thermal equilibrium ) is characterized by a significant increase in the temperature of the colder disk ( @xmath61k ) within the first 100 - 200fs , much faster than relaxation to the lattice .",

    "[ fig3](b ) : when the disks are prepared at 1000k and 300k initial temperatures , nearly 50% of the electronic heat of the hot disk is transferred to the cold one within the first @xmath59fs .        in practical implementations , optical pumping with femtosecond laser pulses grants us access into the ultrafast regime , allowing us to reach high electron temperatures such as those considered in this work @xcite .",
    "additionally , the amount of optically absorbed energy depends on the pump frequency relative to the plasmons of the system @xcite .",
    "this idea can be exploited to pump neighboring graphene disks in such a way that one of them absorbs much more energy than the other , just by tuning the pump laser near the plasmon of one of the disks and away from the plasmons of the other disk .",
