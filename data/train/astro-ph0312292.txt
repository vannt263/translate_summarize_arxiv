    "galaxy scaling relations , such as the fundamental plane , and its various projections , and the colour - magnitude relation have been used to enhance our understanding of galaxy structure and evolution .",
    "early - type galaxies , in particular , form a relatively homogeneous population and hence rather well - defined scaling relations .",
    "most large samples of early - type galaxies come from the rich environments of galaxies clusters .",
    "studies of these high density regions benefit from the large numbers of galaxies in a small angular region of the sky ( hence making observations more efficient ) and from the morphology - density relation , which tells us that such environments are dominated by early - type galaxies .",

    "the field and group environments are less well studied in this respect , and provide a means to study environmentally - dependent processes .",
    "for example , galaxy mergers ( which can be about hundred times more efficient in today s groups than clusters , cf .",
    "@xcite ) may result in merger - remnant ellipticals that deviate strongly from the scaling relations ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "it is likely that the dip in the luminosity function at intermediate magnitudes arises from increased merging in low velocity dispersion systems .    of particular interest in this context are early - type galaxies , which are more abundant in clusters and groups than in the field . several well - known scaling relations ( such as the faber - jackson relation or the fundamental plane of elliptical galaxies )",
    "utilise galaxy velocity dispersions and hence require spectroscopic data .",
    "however , scaling relations like the kormendy relation @xcite and the photometric plane of galaxies @xcite can be constructed from photometric observations alone .",
    "there have been many studies aimed at understanding the differences in the structure of ellipticals ( e ) and dwarf ellipticals ( de ) , with mixed results . while some ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "* ) find evidence otherwise ( see @xcite for more details ) .",
    "traditionally , the surface brightness distribution of ellipticals and bulges of disk galaxies have been modelled by the de vaucouleursprofile .",
    "however , during the last decade , better photometry and advanced analysis have shown that their surface brightness distribution is , in general , better represented by the sersic profile ( @xmath0 , @xcite ) , of which the de vaucouleurs  profile ( @xmath4 ) is a special case @xcite .",

    "we examine the surface brightness distribution of ellipticals belonging to galaxy groups , where most galaxies in the universe reside . the relatively small number of galaxies in individual groups , compared to clusters , requires any analysis to be carried out on a large sample .",

    "the galaxies are classified based on the x - ray luminosity ( @xmath5 ) of their parent groups , which , being correlated with the velocity dispersion of the group ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "[ fig : absmaghist ] around @xmath44 is due to the dip in the lf of these groups , discussed in further detail by @xcite .",
    "the sersic parameter @xmath1 is often found to be correlated with the absolute magnitude of the elliptical galaxies @xcite , which would indicate that the sersic parameter is an intrinsic property of a galaxy . here",
    ", we find a highly scattered correlation between @xmath1 and @xmath43 for elliptical galaxies ( both e and de ) in groups , with a scatter of about 1.5  mag in @xmath43 , which is much larger than the scatter ( about 0.45  mag in @xmath45 ) found by @xcite .    in order to understand the origin of this scatter in the @xmath46 relation , we plot the galaxies as a function of their normalised projected distance from the centre of their parent group ( fig .  [ fig : nradial ] ) . since the distribution of the sersic parameter does not show a significant variation with x - ray properties of the group , we use galaxies belonging to all three sub - samples together to improve statistics .",
    "galaxies in the core of the groups ( @xmath47 ) have higher values for the sersic parameter ( mean value and 95% confidence level of @xmath48 ) , while in the outer regions ( @xmath49 ) , galaxies have lower values of @xmath1 and hence are less cuspy ( mean value and 95% confidence level of @xmath50 ) . the systematic variation in values of @xmath1 with the distance from the centre of the parent group appears to be independent of how bright the galaxies are .",
    "@xcite recently found a triangular distribution between the concentration index of galaxies ( related to @xmath1 ) and the projected two - dimensional local density of galaxies in clusters , which is expected even if @xmath1 ( and concentration parameter ) and @xmath43 were tightly correlated . at higher",
    "projected densities , galaxies with both low and high values of concentration index will be binned together due to projection . on the other hand ,",
    "since galaxies in low - density environments have low @xmath1 , at lower projected densities only galaxies with lower values of concentration index will be seen .",
    "[ fig : ndistance ] shows a similar triangular distribution between the sersic parameter @xmath1 and normalised projected distance for the galaxies in our sample . if @xmath1 and @xmath43 of elliptical galaxies were correlated for normal and dwarf ellipticals , fig .",
    "[ fig : ndistance ] would seem to indicate that the dwarf ellipticals are preferentially removed from the core of each group , but enhanced in the outer regions .",
    "however , from fig  [ fig : nradial ] it appears that the situation is more complicated .",
    "we find faint des ( @xmath51 ) , with relatively higher values of @xmath1 , at smaller normalised projected distances from the centre of the groups .",
    "this might suggest that these high-@xmath1 des are at the core of their groups .",
    "this strongly suggests that environmental effects can play a key role in the shape of the light profile ( characterised by values of @xmath1 ) , in galaxies and that this parameter is not an intrinsic property of a galaxy .",
    "this also shows that des , traditionally known to have near - exponential brightness profiles , can have cuspy cores , and can exist in the central regions of groups .",
    "these `` nucleated '' des have been found to be more centrally concentrated in their distribution in detailed studies of nearby clusters , e.g. virgo and fornax @xcite .",
    "it is interesting to note that such cusps are also known to exist in starburst des ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "one of the essential observational ingredients of the study of galaxy evolution is the family of scaling relations such as the fundamental plane , characteristic of dynamically relaxed elliptical galaxies @xcite .",
    "although the fundamental plane for bright elliptical galaxies is found to be scarcely affected by environmental factors , it may not be so for low mass ellipticals . while @xcite showed that dwarf ellipticals as dwarfs ( des ) and those brighter as normal ellipticals ( es ) .",
    "] follow the same trend defined by the fundamental plane of bright elliptical galaxies , albeit with a larger scatter due to structural variation , the dwarf ellipticals in virgo cluster studied by @xcite belong to a different fundamental plane .    in the absence of spectroscopic measures of velocity dispersion , which is a key parameter in constructing the fundamental plane , one can study those projections of the fundamental plane which are purely photometric .",
    "in this section , we will study the photometric characteristics of the elliptical galaxies in our sample ( those with @xmath52 , as defined in  3.1 ) , a subset of our sample of `` early - type galaxies '' ( @xmath53 )      elliptical galaxies are known to show a strong correlation between the mean surface brightness @xmath54 , and the half - light radius @xmath2 , known as the kormendy relation ( kr ) @xmath55 , with the slope @xmath56 lying in the range 2.03.0 @xcite .",
    "the kormendy relation for cluster ellipticals shows a r.m.s .",
    "scatter of about 0.1  dex , which would result in a 25% error in @xmath2 and hence in measuring distance to the galaxies .",
    "[ fig : kormendy ] shows the kormendy relation for elliptical galaxies in our sample , where galaxies belonging to parent groups which are x - ray bright ( @xmath57 erg / s ) , x - ray dim and x - ray undetected are plotted with different symbols .",
    "the plot shows two distinct populations : the `` normal '' ellipticals ( @xmath58 , mean kr slope @xmath59 ) and the dwarf ellipticals ( @xmath60 , mean kr slope @xmath61 ) .",
    "however , from fig .  [",
    "fig : kormendy ] , it is apparent that instead of a linear kr , we may interpret the distribution of des as one of high scatter , truncated by our magnitude limit ( @xmath62 ) .",
    "we also note that there are very few galaxies in the zone between the two populations , which results from the significant dip in the luminosity function of groups in the range @xmath63 , as seen in @xcite .    comparing with the kr for galaxies in rich clusters , we find that the slope of the kr for our brightest galaxies ( @xmath64 ) 2.75@xmath650.16 , compared to 2.43@xmath650.15 for a similar sample in the coma cluster ( @xcite , plotted as the solid line in fig .  [",
    "fig : kormendy ] ) .    extending the kr plot of the coma cluster to fainter galaxies ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , ellipticals in the magnitude range @xmath66 are found to follow a trend , at almost constant @xmath2 , quite distinct from that of the brighter galaxies , the latter having a slope similar to that found in our sample .",
    "our sample of dwarfs extends to fainter @xmath67 smaller ( @xmath68  pc ) galaxies , and shows the presence of substantial scatter in both axes .",
    "some contribution to this large scatter may also arise from dependencies on local environment , since we are merging galaxies from 16 groups in a single plot .",
    "our conclusion ( in agreement with @xcite ) is that the kormendy relation in itself does _ not _ provide strong evidence for any fundamental difference in structure between normal and dwarf ellipticals .",
    "recent developments in the study of the structure of galaxies and the modelling of brightness profiles , in particular with the use of the more general sersic model , provides a unified description of the photometric properties of normal ( e ) and dwarf ellipticals ( de ) , traditionally seen as two distinct families ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the discontinuity between these two extreme exponential ( @xmath69 , des ) and de vaucouleurs  profiles ( @xmath70 , es ) is now filled by both populations possessing a large range of values @xmath71 .",
    "the bulges of disk galaxies share the same photometric plane with ellipticals .",
    "the photometric plane ( pp , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) is a bivariate relation that links only photometric parameters , obtained by fitting a sersic model to a galaxy image , @xmath72 .",
    "our simulations show that fitting galaxy brightness distributions with unsuitable models ( e.g. the de vaucouleurs  model to a galaxy where @xmath73 ) , can result in a significant variation in the values of structural parameters .",
    "for example , assuming @xmath25 in the case of a @xmath74 galaxy can result in a change in the value of half - light radius by a factor of three .",
    "thus it is important to allow for a free parameter @xmath1 to account for the cusp and core in ellipticals or bulges of disk galaxies .",
    "most scaling relations , e.g. the kormendy relation or the fundamental plane , are insensitive to these variations , since the three parameters of the sersic model ( @xmath3 , @xmath1 , @xmath2 ) are correlated and their combinations used in these scaling relations are robust @xcite .",
    "the photometric plane , on the other hand , allows us to explore the entire range of these parameters for elliptical galaxies , and thus can be used more effectively as a tool to examine the connection between structural parameters and the evolutionary history of galaxies .",
    "the photometric plane for all ellipticals in our sample is given by @xmath75 this equation is similar to that found for the bright elliptical galaxies in the @xmath76-band study of 42 coma galaxies @xcite .",
    "however , the scatter in @xmath1 here is 0.13 @xmath77 , much larger than the scatter found for the coma cluster sample , which is 0.05 @xmath77 , which can be attributed to the fact that our sample is dominated by des . to verify this",
    ", we examine the ellipticals with @xmath78 in x - ray bright groups ( comparable to the coma sample ) , to find that the scatter about the photometric plane for es is only 0.06 @xmath77 in @xmath79 , compared to 0.10 @xmath77 for des .",
    "the fact that the scatter around the the photometric plane of normal es is lower than that of des indicates that es and des are structurally different systems even though their @xmath1 values might be similar .",

    "[ fig : photplane ] , where @xmath83 , @xmath84 and @xmath85 ( directly comparable to the similar plot for coma ellipticals in @xcite ) . since this sample has a fainter magnitude limit , it probes the pp for dwarfs more extensively , and demonstrates that the pp for the des has a is strikingly low scatter ( in contrast , for example , to their scatter in the kormendy plot ) .",
    "this strongly suggests that des might be a more homogeneous class than is normally thought , and follow well - defined structural trends .    to explore a more direct connection with the underlying physical changes in galaxy structure between es and des",
    ", we turn to a slightly different version of these correlations in the next section .",
    "@xcite , in their study of cluster ellipticals , showed that the photometric plane is close to a plane of constant specific entropy of galaxies , originally introduced by @xcite .",
    "although self - gravitating systems like galaxies do not posess stable states of absolute maximum entropy , the evolution of entropy via two - body relaxation will be a slow process , and @xcite argue that the violent relaxation process which occurs during galaxy formation may establish a quasi - equilibrium state of constant specific entropy , and they find evidence that both simulated and observed galaxies do indeed show approximately constant entropy per unit mass . in the case of observed galaxies , the properties of the photometric plane result from this approximate constancy of specific entropy .    on examination of the surfaces of constant entropy in detail",
    ", it is found that they actually exhibit some curvature when represented in the coordinate system of the pp .",
    "it can be seen , from the two edge - on views of our plane in fig .",
    "[ fig : photplane ] , that there are clear indications of curvature in the distribution of the dwarfs .",
    "this curvature , rather than stochastic scatter , accounts for much of the larger variance about the plane for des ( compared to nornal es ) discussed in section  4.2 .",
    "could this curvature be indicating that dwarfs really follow a surface of constant specific entropy ? in fig .",
    "[ fig : entropy ] we plot a representation of the photometric plane in terms of @xmath86 , for our sample , using eq .",

    "the latter has been calculated using eqs .",
    "( 23 ) & ( 24 ) of @xcite , in conjunction with the relevant relations from their appendix a. here , we have only adjusted the value of the specific entropy parameter ( @xmath87 ) to find the curve which best matches our data .",
    "the curvature seen in the distribution of dwarfs in fig .",
    "[ fig : entropy ] is similar to that the constant @xmath87 surface , although the shape does not match in detail .",
    "it is also apparent that the normal es fall above the dwarfs in the figure , which corresponds to the direction of increasing @xmath87 .",
    "the dashed line corresponds to a specific entropy plane with @xmath88 for our sample of elliptical galaxies dominated by des .",
    "this study confirms earlier results that massive ellipticals show higher values of the sersic parameter @xmath1 , _",
    "i.e. _ a cuspier surface brightness profile at their centre @xcite . from the large scatter in the plot of absolute r magnitude and @xmath1 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : nradial ] ) , we conclude that the shape of the radial profile , represented by the value of @xmath1 , is not uniquely related to the intrinsic luminosity of the galaxy .",
    "furthermore , the dependence of @xmath1 on the location of galaxies within their groups ( fig .",
    "[ fig : nradial ] ) shows that environmental dependence is responsible for part of this scatter .",
    "although we find no significant difference between the values of @xmath1 in groups of different x - ray luminosity , we do find that for both des and es ( though not the most luminous es ) , surface brightness profiles tend to be cuspier ( higher @xmath1 ) for galaxies located in the cores of groups .",
    "one explanation for this correlation could be the effects of interaction - induced star formation in triggering nuclear starbursts within more centrally located galaxies .    normal ellipticals in groups are found to yield similar photometric plane and kormendy relation parameters to those in rich clusters .",
    "there is no difference in the kormendy relation or photometric plane between ellipticals belonging to the the different classes of x - ray bright , faint or undetected groups .",
    "furthermore , the kormendy relation is found to be of little value in distinguishing structural differences between des and es , since the kr slope found for dwarfs is dominated by selection effects , most notably the magnitude limit of the sample .",
    "the sparse region in the kr plot , separating des and es , is easily interpereted as resulting from the dip seen in the galaxy luminosity function at @xmath89 , and discussed in more detail in @xcite .",
    "dwarf and normal ellipticals are distinguished much more effectively in terms of their location in the photometric plane in the space of @xmath1 , @xmath2 and @xmath3 .",
    "the dwarfs inhabit a non - flat surface in this space , with a curvature somewhat akin to a surface of constant specific entropy , as defined by the equations of @xcite , though the match is only approximate .",
    "even if galaxies do have constant specific entropy , a degree of mismatch between observation and the analytical expressions of @xcite is not surprising , given the numerous assumptions ( e.g. mass - traces - light , and isotropic velocities ) which have been made in deriving the equations of the isentropic surfaces .",
    "the well - defined nature of the locus followed by these dwarfs is a strong indicator of their structural coherence , and the larger scatter that they exhibit about their photometric plane is largely due to the curvature of the surface they inhabit , rather than to a large random scatter in their properties .",
    "normal galaxies , on the other hand , are offset relative to the dwarf locus , in a direction corresponding to higher specific entropy . in this context , it is interesting that @xcite find , from their simulations , that merging tends to increase specific entropy .",
    "hence the offset may indicate that normal ellipticals , which fall above the dip seen in the galaxy luminosity function , have undergone mergers , whilst dwarfs have not .",
    "this supports the idea @xcite that merging may have played a role in generating the dip in the luminosity function , by converting middle - ranking galaxies into larger ones , whilst dwarfs are largely unaffected due to their smaller merger cross - sections .",

    "<S> we present a photometric analysis of a large sample of early - type galaxies in 16 nearby groups , imaged with the wide - field camera on the isaac newton telescope . using a two - dimensional surface brightness decomposition routine </S>",
    "<S> , we fit sersic ( @xmath0 ) and exponential models to their bulge and disk components respectively . dividing the galaxies into three subsamples according to the x - ray luminosities of their parent groups , we compare their photometric properties . </S>",
    "<S> galaxies in x - ray luminous groups tend to be larger and more luminous than those in groups with undetected or low x - ray luminosities , but no significant differences in @xmath1 are seen . </S>",
    "<S> both normal and dwarf elliptical galaxies in the central regions of groups are found to have cuspier profiles than their counterparts in group outskirts .    </S>",
    "<S> structural differences between dwarf and normal elliptical galaxies are apparent in terms of an offset between their `` photometric planes '' in the space of @xmath1 , @xmath2 and @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> dwarf ellipticals are found to populate a surface , with remarkably low scatter , in this space with significant curvature , somewhat similar to the surfaces of constant entropy proposed by @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> normal ellipticals are offset from this distribution in a direction of higher specific entropy . </S>",
    "<S> this may indicate that the two populations are distinguished by the action of galaxy merging on larger galaxies .    </S>",
