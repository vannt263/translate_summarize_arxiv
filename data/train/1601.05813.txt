    "<S> in - plane structural and electronic anisotropy in iron based superconductors are usually assigned to the development of orbital or spin driven nematic instabilities . here </S>",
    "<S> , we reveal the fundamental role played by nonsymmorphic symmetry operations of the underlying space group . </S>",
    "<S> these symmetry operations include half - integer translations which introduce extra phases when applied to the hamiltonian in the orbital basis . </S>",
    "<S> although these phases do not affect the fourfold rotational symmetry of the band dispersion , they remove that symmetry for the response functions , leading to anisotropic fluctuations in both magnetic and density channels . </S>",
    "<S> the anisotropy is enhanced by interactions , leading eventually to broken symmetry .    </S>",
    "<S> an anisotropic electronic state has been found in iron based superconductors ( fescs ) using various experimental probes such as elastic shear modulus  @xcite , scanning tunneling microscopy  @xcite , neutron magnetic resonance  @xcite , magnetic torque with synchrotron x - ray measurements  @xcite , angle - resolved photoemission spectroscopy  @xcite , and transport measurements  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it is believed that this anisotropic state arises from orbital or spin driven nematic order in these materials . a nematic phase in a crystalline lattice breaks discrete rotational symmetry spontaneously , while preserving translational symmetry .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite    in the stripe - type antiferromagnetic ( af ) phase of fescs , @xmath0 symmetry ( the fourfold rotational symmetry , @xmath1 , around an fe - site followed by reflection about the fe plane ) is indeed broken down to @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> this phase is necessarily accompanied by a structural transition ( tetragonal - to - orthorhombic ) . </S>",
    "<S> however , experimental evidence shows that the structural transition ( @xmath3 ) happens before the magnetic one ( @xmath4 ) and that a nematic ( anisotropic ) , but paramagnetic ( pm ) , phase exists in a narrow temperature range above the magnetic transition line . </S>",
    "<S> they also show that nematic fluctuations appear at much higher temperatures .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite indeed , some suggest that an electronic nematic phase develops at temperatures @xmath5 with a minor ( although non - zero ) influence on the lattice structure at intermediate temperatures .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite in this picture , for @xmath6 the symmetry of the electronic structure is already @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> then , at @xmath3 the lattice reaches a tipping point and responds strongly to the nematic electronic structure , bringing a pronounced @xmath2 signature to the entire system .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite    two broad classes of electronic mechanisms , orbital and spin - driven ising - nematic ordering mechanisms , have been considered in theoretical studies . in the orbital ordering mechanism , </S>",
    "<S> nematic order is driven by spontaneous lifting of the degeneracy between fe @xmath7 and @xmath8 orbitals .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite it has also been proposed that the orbital order is induced by spin fluctuations , due to strong spin - orbital mode - coupling arising from aslamazov - larkin type vertex corrections .  @xcite these vertex corrections describe scattering processes involving the emission and reabsorption of pairs of fluctuations ( in this case spin fluctuations ) . for small hund coupling , </S>",
    "<S> these vertex corrections suppress the spin susceptibility and enhance the quadrupole susceptibility at low temperature , hence leading to a diverging quadrupole ( orbital ) susceptibility prior to the magnetic ones .    </S>",
    "<S> alternatively , in a spin - driven mechanism the nematicity is associated with the formation of magnetic order , for instance an ising spin - nematic state , before a conventional spin density wave state develops .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite in real space , this is a state with @xmath9 , while @xmath10 . in momentum space , </S>",
    "<S> the static magnetic susceptibility @xmath11 becomes different at @xmath12 or @xmath13 ( one - fe unit cell ) . for @xmath14 , </S>",
    "<S> the thermal fluctuations of the continuously varying spin orientation are too severe to allow magnetic ordering . in microscopic calculations however , due to the tetragonal symmetry of the one - fe unit cell , both @xmath15 diverge simultaneously at the magnetic transition temperature . </S>",
    "<S> thus , it is argued that to determine which magnetic state develops one needs to calculate nematic fluctuations that are higher order terms in the magnetic free energy .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite    inconsistent with the above proposals for the origin of nematicity , the doping - dependence of the nematic phase is uncorrelated with that of the orthorhombic and af phases for bafe@xmath16(as@xmath17p@xmath18)@xmath16 : while the latter phases show a similar sudden drop immediately below @xmath19 , the nematic phase is only monotonically suppressed toward the over - doped region .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite    here we show that anisotropic response functions are a fundamental consequence of the space group of iron - based superconductors . </S>",
    "<S> the tetragonal structure of the @xmath20 , @xmath21 and @xmath22 families belongs to the @xmath23 space group , which is nonsymmorphic . even for the @xmath24 family , the main building block , </S>",
    "<S> i.e. , the iron pnictide trilayer , has a nonsymmorphic space group . </S>",
    "<S> since a simple gauge transformation on the as orbitals allows one to write the one - particle eigenenergies of the non - interacting hamiltonian in a one - fe unit cell with symmorphic space group , all previous studies were performed in the one - iron unit cell . however , for response functions the relevant physics is not fully captured by the one - fe unit cell approach . indeed , working in the correct two - fe unit cell , </S>",
    "<S> we show that under nonsymmorphic symmetry operations of the underlying group , the hamiltonian of the system acquires some extra phases which in essence lift the @xmath1 symmetry of the response functions , even though they do not affect the symmetry of single - particle eigenenergies .    in general , </S>",
    "<S> a non - translation member of the space group can be described by @xmath25 , where @xmath26 is a point group operation ( rotation , reflection , etc . ) , which keeps at least one point ( the coordinate origin ) invariant , followed by a _ </S>",

    "<S> @xcite the half - integer translation vectors depend on the choice of the origin and axis . </S>",
    "<S> they can not be eliminated by shifting the origin for screw axis and glide - plane operations . </S>",

    "<S> the origin is chosen to be on the inversion center in the middle of an fe - fe link . </S>",
    "<S> we consider the three generators @xmath28 , @xmath29 and inversion @xmath30 , where @xmath31 is an anti - clockwise rotation through @xmath32 radians about the axis labeled by @xmath33 . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath28 operation is a screw axis operation where a rotation is followed by a translation along the rotation axis . for a nonsymmorphic space group , the non - translation elements @xmath25 do not form a group , since their combination may turn out to be a pure lattice translation </S>",
    "<S> however , the symmorphic elements @xmath34 by themselves form a group .    </S>",

    "<S> this is accompanied by a rotation in the associated orbital space along with a possible atom index exchange @xmath40 if there is more than one atom of the same kind in the unit cell . </S>",
    "<S> the peculiarity of a nonsymmorphic operation is that the new position may be in a unit cell adjacent to @xmath41 . defining @xmath42 as a real space lattice vector which connects atoms @xmath43 in these two unit cells , we have @xmath44 . </S>",
    "<S> the vector @xmath45 depends on the position of atom @xmath35 and on the vector @xmath27 . </S>",
    "<S> for example , under @xmath46 the @xmath47-site of the unit cell at origin transfers to @xmath48-site of the neighboring unit cell in the @xmath49-direction while the @xmath48-site transfers to @xmath47-site of the same unit cell ( see fig .  [ fig1 ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> thus , for this symmetry operation @xmath50 for sublattice @xmath47 and @xmath51 for sublattice @xmath48 , where @xmath52 denotes the real - space lattice unit vector in @xmath53th direction . </S>",
    "<S> these vectors @xmath54 introduce atom - dependent extra phases when we go to fourier space .    </S>",
    "<S> next we consider how the wave vectors appearing in the hamiltonian transform under the symmetry operations . with @xmath55 fe-@xmath56 and as-@xmath57 orbitals in the unit cell , the hamiltonian in the orbital basis </S>",
    "<S> is given by @xmath58 , where @xmath59 . </S>",
    "<S> as shown in the sm , under a symmetry operation , @xmath25 , the electron annihilation operators in the orbital basis @xmath60 transform as @xmath61 { \\bf u}^{\\prime}_{g{\\bf k},{\\bf l}}{\\bf u}_g\\psi_{g{\\bf k}}$ ] where @xmath62 is a @xmath63 unitary matrix that describes the effect of the @xmath25 operation in the orbital basis and where the action of @xmath26 on @xmath64 is represented by a @xmath65 orthogonal matrix . </S>",
    "<S> the existence of the above mentioned @xmath45 vectors lead to the diagonal @xmath63 unitary matrix @xmath66 with element @xmath67 . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , the invariance of the hamitonian follows from @xmath68 which is different from the result for a symmorphic operation , i. e. , @xmath69 for iron - based superconductors , the usual relation , eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ tran2 ] ) , is recovered under the @xmath30 and @xmath29 generators where the extra phase factors are absent . </S>",
    "<S> however under @xmath28 only one sublattice , @xmath47 , obtains the extra phase , @xmath70 $ ] , where @xmath71 is the @xmath49-component of the wave - vector in reciprocal lattice vector units . </S>",
    "<S> this implies that for this operation eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ tran2 ] ) is valid only for the intra - sublattice part of the hamiltonian , where the extra phases are canceled out , and not for the whole matrix . </S>",
    "<S> the same is true for all the symmetry operations of the group with non - zero @xmath27 , including the symmetry operation corresponding to @xmath0 and the glide - reflection symmetry ( see sm ) . </S>",
    "<S> it is not possible to eliminate these phases with a gauge transformation for the same reason that it is not possible to eliminate the half - integer translation with a shift of origin .    </S>",
    "<S> then a key question is what are the consequences of the symmetry properties of the hamiltonian eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ tran1 ] ) on observables . </S>",
    "<S> band energies and their degeneracy are clearly invariant under all symmetry operations . </S>",

    "<S> the situation is different for fluctuations of spin and charge , or equivalently response functions . </S>",

    "<S> . a density / magnetic susceptibility measures the response of the system to an applied conjugate field . </S>",
    "<S> a singular susceptibility indicates an instability ( a continuous phase transition ) towards an ordered phase . in an interacting system </S>",
    "<S> one can employ a diagrammatic series expansion to decompose the density / magnetic susceptibilities , @xmath76 , into bare susceptibility , @xmath77 , and vertex corrections , @xmath78 . with the help of the irreducible vertex functions in density / magnetic channels , @xmath79 , </S>",
