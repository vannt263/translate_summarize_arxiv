    "it is nowadays widely accepted that the low energy physics of 1d locally interacting quantum systems is captured by the so - called matrix product states ( mps ) @xcite .",
    "this idea , rooted in the numerical success of dmrg @xcite and based on the area - law principle @xcite , has had an enormous impact on the understanding of 1d quantum systems .",
    "on the numerical side , it has led to novel methods to extract the physics of strongly correlated quantum systems @xcite . on the theoretical side",
    ", it has served e.g. to understand and quantify the amount of entanglement present in 1d quantum systems @xcite , or to clarify the role of symmetries and its connection with the existence of string order parameters @xcite , and ultimately has led to a full classification of 1d quantum phases @xcite .",
    "a crucial concept in all the above references is the one of parent hamiltonian , a frustration free gapped local hamiltonian having the given mps as its ground state .",
    "parent hamiltonians are extremely useful as they allow us to use the framework of mps to also study the properties of one - dimensional hamiltonians .",
    "while analyzing systems with discrete symmetry breaking , equivalently mps with a discrete gauge symmetry , it has been observed in @xcite , that small local perturbations of the mps do not correspond to small perturbations in its parent hamiltonian , unless the perturbation preserves the gauge symmetry .",
    "the main aim of the present work is to provide a complete picture of this unexpected behavior . among other things ,",
    "this could help in the design of mps - based algorithms to simulate systems with discrete symmetry breaking in 1d or , more generally , systems with topological order in 2d .    in this work",
    ", we will study the parent hamiltonian corresponding to perturbations of mps with a gauge symmetry .",
    "we will show that in the limit where the perturbation goes to zero , the parent hamiltonian converges to a new hamiltonian with the following striking properties : ( i ) it has the same -finite dimensional- ground space as the parent hamiltonian , ( ii ) it is also frustration free , but ( iii ) it is gapless and its spectrum equals @xmath1 in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "these properties hold for _ any _ mps with a gauge symmetry , and for _ generic _ perturbations .",
    "as opposed to the parent hamiltonian , we will call this new hamiltonian an _ uncle _",
    "hamiltonian for the mps . unlike the parent hamiltonian , the uncle hamiltonian changes continuously under perturbations of the mps even in the presence of a gauge symmetry .    as a by - product",
    "we obtain new examples which shed new light on the properties inherent to critical systems and phase transitions , in the line initiated in @xcite .",
    "notice that all our examples are generic , as gapless as they can be since the spectrum is the whole positive real line , but they are frustration free and there is no power - law decay of correlations within the ground space . indeed , modifying our construction , for any injective mps ( which always has exponentially decaying correlations ) , one can obtain simple frustration free models with the same spectral properties but with the given mps as unique ground state in the thermodynamic limit  however , the finite dimensional kernels do not coincide in this injective case .",

    "section [ sec : example ] works out the illustrative example of the ghz - state which helps in understanding the main theorems presented in section [ sec : main ] .",

    ", we have moved some of the technical proofs to the appendices , where one can also find how to treat formally the thermodynamic limit using the gns construction and some basic facts we need about spectral theory of unbounded operators on a hilbert space .",
    "in this section , we will provide the necessary definitions and basic lemmas : we start by introducing matrix product states , their normal form , and the injectivity property .",
