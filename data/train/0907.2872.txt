    "<S> the total energy deposited into the medium per unit length by a fast parton traversing a quark - gluon plasma is calculated . </S>",

    "<S> the question of how the quark - gluon plasma responds to fast partons as they propagate through it has gained significance in light of measurements of hadron correlation functions that are consistent with a conical emission pattern @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> these measurements suggest that fast partons may generate collective conical disturbances in the medium . </S>",
    "<S> theoretical studies of how the quark - gluon plasma responds to fast partons are relatively recent @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> one of the primary challenges in this investigation is to determine the energy deposited into the medium per unit length by an energetic parton . </S>",
    "<S> as it propagates through the medium , the fast parton loses energy through collisions and medium induced radiation . </S>",
    "<S> the energy deposited into the medium per unit length is then the sum of the collisional energy loss of the primary parton and of the radiated gluons . </S>",
    "<S> the energy deposited into the medium per unit length is the sum of the collisional energy loss of the primary parton and of the radiated gluons .    in what follows </S>",
    "<S> , we calculate the total energy deposited into the medium per unit length by a fast parton traversing a quark - gluon plasma @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we start by considering the collisional energy lost per unit length by the fast parton for which we will use the familiar expression @xcite @xmath0 where the subscript @xmath1 denotes collisional energy loss and @xmath2 is the path - length traveled by the source parton . also , @xmath3 is the strong coupling </S>",
    "<S> , @xmath4 is the debye mass of the medium , which we take to be given by @xmath5 , @xmath6 is the energy of the fast parton , @xmath7 is the temperature of the medium , and @xmath8 is the eigenvalue of the quadratic casimir operator of the color charge of the source parton , which is 4/3 if the fast parton is a quark , and 3 for a gluon .    </S>",
    "<S> we next calculate the energy gained by the medium due to gluons radiated by the fast parton . </S>",
    "<S> we begin by deriving a partial differential equation through which one can determine the spectrum of radiated gluons in the medium , defined here as @xmath9 . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath9 will in general differ from the spectrum of gluons emitted by the fast parton , @xmath10 , because gluons , once emitted , lose energy in the medium due to collisions until they become part of the thermal bath . </S>",
    "<S> specifically , as a gluon with energy @xmath11 travels from @xmath2 to @xmath12 , it loses collisional energy @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is obtained from ( [ de_dx_c ] ) to be @xmath15 it follows that in order to find a gluon with energy @xmath11 at position @xmath12 , there must be a gluon with energy @xmath16 at position @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , we require @xmath17 , that is , the total number of gluons , to be invariant , which leads to the following relation @xmath18 finally , as the fast parton moves from @xmath2 to @xmath12 , it will emit additional gluons , @xmath19 , which add to @xmath20 , so that in the limit of @xmath21 the evolution equation for @xmath9 takes the form @xmath22 = \\frac{d i}{d \\omega d \\xi}(\\omega,\\xi).\\ ] ] to determine @xmath23 , it is necessary to specify @xmath24 , for which we choose the spectrum calculated by salgado and wiedemann in the multiple soft scattering approximation @xcite @xmath25}{\\omega^{3/2}}\\ ] ] where we use the following expression for the jet quenching parameter @xcite : @xmath26    we make the distinction that gluons with energy @xmath27 are sources of collisional energy loss , while those with @xmath28 immediately become part of the medium . for @xmath29 we solve for @xmath9 numerically from equation ( [ diff_e_q ] ) for a primary fast quark using the parameters : @xmath30 , @xmath31 mev , and @xmath32 gev . </S>",
    "<S> the total energy deposited into the medium by the secondary gluons per unit length takes the form @xmath33 where we set @xmath34 . </S>",
    "<S> the final term in equation ( [ de_dx_r ] ) accounts for energetic gluons which have lost enough energy to become a part of the medium and deposit their entire remaining energy . </S>",
    "<S> we multiply the spectrum ( [ specchoice ] ) by a factor of @xmath35 to ensure it goes to zero at @xmath36 when solving ( [ diff_e_q ] ) .    </S>",
    "<S> the result for ( [ de_dx_r ] ) is shown as the dashed line in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ total_energy ] for the parameters listed above , along with the differential collisional energy loss of the primary parton ( dotted line ) and its differential energy loss to radiation ( smooth line ) .    </S>",
    "<S> the energy deposited by the radiation into the medium per unit length has an approximately linear growth in pathlength , which results from the steady increase in the number of gluons that deposit energy in collisions . </S>",
    "<S> the total energy deposition into the medium per unit length , or time , is the sum of ( [ de_dx_c ] ) and ( [ de_dx_r ] ) , which we write as @xmath37 we make the connection to the hydrodynamic response of the medium by treating the fast parton as a point source of energy and momentum deposition in the medium , with velocity @xmath38 and energy @xmath6 . for a relativistic point source , the hydrodynamic source term , denoted as @xmath39 , takes the following form @xmath40 where @xmath41 is given by ( [ tot_diff_loss ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> the calculation is made more tractable by fitting the result of ( [ de_dx_r ] ) to a linear function of time , from which we find that for @xmath42 fm @xmath43    the source term couples to the hydrodynamic equations for the medium , @xmath44 , where @xmath45 is the energy - momentum tensor . </S>",
    "<S> we consider the source to be coupled to an otherwise static medium at temperature @xmath7 and that the energy and momentum density deposited by the fast parton is small compared to the equilibrium energy density of the medium so that the hydrodynamical equations can be linearized . </S>",
    "<S> we are here interested in calculating the energy density perturbation excited in the medium , denoted as @xmath46 . </S>",
    "<S> the equations of motion for a medium coupled to a source in linearized hydrodynamics are discussed in several places ( for instance , @xcite ) .    </S>",
    "<S> we calculate the medium response at a time @xmath47 fm for back to back quarks ( each with energy @xmath32 gev ) which are created at @xmath48 and @xmath49 , and propagate along the @xmath50 axis until @xmath51 fm . the result is shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ mach_wave ] , for a medium with the same parameters used above as well as @xmath52 and @xmath53 . </S>",
    "<S> the plot shows the energy density wave excited by the source quarks in the @xmath54-@xmath55 plane , however , the results are cylindrically symmetric about the @xmath50 axis . </S>",
    "<S> the mach cone formation is visible in the figure . </S>",
    "<S> the radiative contribution to the source term exhibits a linear growth with time , which is reflected in the shape of the resulting energy density wave . </S>"
