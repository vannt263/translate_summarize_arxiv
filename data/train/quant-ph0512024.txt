    "bulk spin - cooling procedures such as dynamic nuclear polarization are well known and capable of reaching polarizations near unity @xcite . this architecture is one realization within a large class of possible solid - state qip systems in which coherently controlled qubits can be brought into contact with an external system that behaves as a heat bath .",
    "the principles and methods applied in solid - state nmr qip will therefore apply to many other systems .",
    "an additional motivation is development of control techniques that future quantum devices will utilize . for this experiment",
    ", we develop a novel technique to implement the controlled qubit - bath interaction , and also report the first application of strongly - modulating pulses @xcite to solid - state nmr for high - fidelity , coherent qubit control .",
    "the three - qubit quantum information processor used here is formed by the three spin-@xmath0 @xmath1c nuclei of isotopically labelled malonic acid molecules , occupying a dilute fraction of lattice sites in an otherwise unlabeled single - crystal of malonic acid ( unlabeled , with the exception of naturally occurring @xmath1c isotopes at the rate of @xmath2 ) .",

    "malonic acid also contains abundant spin-@xmath0 @xmath4h nuclei , which comprise the heat - bath .",

    "[ fig : fig1 ] lists the parameters of the ensemble qubit hamiltonian obtained from fitting the spectrum , and also includes couplings involving the methylene protons calculated for this crystal orientation from the known crystal structure @xcite .",

    "multiplet assignments are indicated by the labels @xmath7 , @xmath8 and @xmath9 .",
    "the central peaks in each multiplet correspond to natural abundance @xmath1c in the sample , which are inconsequential for qip purposes .",
    "the peak height differences in the @xmath10-@xmath1c molecule peaks indicate the strong coupling regime , i.e. the @xmath1c-@xmath1c intramolecular dipolar couplings are significant compared to the relative chemical shifts .",

    "[ fig : fig1],height=359 ]",
    "in this orientation , the methylene carbon @xmath9 has a dipolar coupling of @xmath11 khz to @xmath12 of the methylene @xmath4h pair , whereas no other @xmath1c-@xmath4h dipolar coupling in the system is larger than @xmath13 khz .",
    "therefore , a spin - exchange hamiltonian of the form + @xmath14 that couples the two nuclear species will generate dynamics dominated by the large @xmath9-@xmath12 coupling at short times ( the @xmath15 are @xmath1c-@xmath4h dipolar couplings , indices run over @xmath1c,@xmath4h nuclei , respectively , and @xmath16 is the @xmath17-axis pauli operator for spin @xmath18 ) . starting from the natural coupling hamiltonian , + @xmath19 we applied a multiple - pulse time - suspension sequence @xcite synchronously to both @xmath1c and @xmath4h spins to create the effective spin - exchange hamiltonian ( in the toggling frame ) , to lowest order in the magnus expansion of the average hamiltonian @xcite .",
    "application of the sequence for the @xmath9-@xmath12 exchange period @xmath20 results in an approximate swap gate ( state exchange ) between the @xmath9 and @xmath12 spins . with an initial bulk @xmath4h polarization @xmath21",
    ", this procedure yields a selective dynamic transfer of polarization @xmath22 to @xmath9 , where @xmath23 and ideally @xmath24 .",
    "we define the effective spin - bath temperature to be that which corresponds to the experimentally obtained @xmath25 under this procedure , and refer to this transfer as a refresh operation .",
    "we obtained @xmath26 experimentally , and found that repeated refresh operations showed no loss in efficiency given at least a @xmath27 ms delay for @xmath4h-@xmath4h equilibration .",
    "however , we observed a decay of @xmath21 as a function of the number of repetitions , due to accumulated control errors , which lead to an identical loss in the refresh polarization .",
    "the experiment consists of the first six operations of the partner - pairing algorithm ( ppa ) on three qubits : three refresh operations , and three permutation gates that operate on the qubit register .",
    "this is described in the quantum circuit diagram of fig .",
    "[ fig : fig2 ] . during the register operations ,",
    "the @xmath4h polarization is first rotated into the transverse plane , and then spin - locked by a strong , phase - matched rf field that both preserves the bulk @xmath4h polarization and decouples the @xmath4h-@xmath1c dipolar interactions . since @xmath4h-@xmath4h dipolar interactions are merely scaled by a factor @xmath28 under spin - locking , @xmath12 is allowed to equilibrate with the bulk @xmath4h nuclei via spin diffusion .",
    "this occurs on a timescale longer than the transverse dephasing time ( @xmath29s ) , but much shorter than the spin - lattice relaxation time ( @xmath30s ) of @xmath12 .",
    "hence , @xmath12 plays the role of the fast - relaxing qubit described in the protocol of schulman et al . @xcite .",
    "the first two register operations are swap gates ; the third is a three - bit compression ( @xmath10bc ) gate @xcite that boosts the polarization of the first qubit , @xmath7 , at the expense of the polarizations of the other two qubits . ideally , the protocol builds a uniform polarization on all three qubits corresponding to the bath polarization ( first five steps ) , then selectively transfers as much entropy as possible from the first qubit to the other two ( last step ) . the last step ( @xmath10bc ) leads to a polarization boost by a factor of @xmath31 on the first qubit .",
    "subsequently , the heated qubits can be re - cooled to the spin - bath temperature , and the compression step repeated , iteratively , until the asymptotic value of the first - bit polarization is reached .",
    "this limiting polarization depends only on the number of qubits and the bath polarization @xcite , and is ideally @xmath32 for three qubits",
    "( for @xmath33 qubits it is @xmath34 in the regime @xmath35 , and @xmath36 in the regime @xmath37 ( refs .",

    "the gate sequence corresponds to the first six steps of the partner - pairing algorithm @xcite on three qubits .",
    "the input state is a collective polarization of the bulk @xmath4h spins .",
    "the refresh operation is approximately @xmath39s in duration , whereas the register operations are between @xmath40 and @xmath41 ms in duration .",
    "thermal contact takes place during @xmath4h spin - locking pulses that begin just prior to the register operations , and extend an additional @xmath42 ms after each operation .",
    "@xmath12 can be thought of as an additional special purpose qubit in this experiment ; despite non - selective @xmath4h control ( due to bulk hydrogenation ) , the refresh and thermal contact operations could be performed using collective @xmath4h control .",
    "thus , @xmath12 serves as a fast - relaxing qubit and the bulk @xmath4h - bath as a large heat - capacity thermal bath .",
    "[ fig : fig2],height=302 ]    the control operations performed herein are quantum control operations : state - independent unitary rotations in the hilbert space .",
    "however , it should be noted that the hbac gates are all permutations that map computational basis states to other computational basis states .",
    "therefore , gate fidelities were measured with respect to correlation with these known states , rather than the manifold of generic quantum states .",
    "we took advantage of this property to further optimize the control parameters of the @xmath1c gates ( register operations ) for the state - specific transformations of the protocol .",
    "these operations were carried out using numerically optimized control sequences referred to as strongly - modulating pulses @xcite .",
    "such pulses drive the system strongly at all times , such that the average rf amplitude is comparable to , or greater than , the magnitude of the internal hamiltonian .",
    "this allows inhomogeneities in the ensemble qubit hamiltonian to be efficiently refocused , so that ensemble coherence is better maintained throughout the gate operations .",
    "+ in this set of experiments , the @xmath1c qubit spins are initialized to infinite temperature ( a preceding broadband @xmath1c @xmath43 excitation pulse is followed by a dephasing period in which @xmath4h dipolar fields effectively dephase the @xmath1c polarization ) . following the fifth step , polarizations ( in units of @xmath25 ) of @xmath44 , @xmath45 and @xmath46 ( @xmath47 )",
    "are built up on @xmath7 , @xmath8 and @xmath9 , respectively .",
    "the final @xmath10bc operation yields @xmath48 , a boost of @xmath49 compared to the average polarization ( @xmath50 ) following step five . despite control imperfections that effectively heat the qubits at each step",
    ", we are able to cool the @xmath7 qubit ensemble well below the effective @xmath4h spin - bath temperature . +",
    "the results are summarized in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig3 ] ; in ( a ) are shown the spectral intensities corresponding to @xmath1c spin polarizations following each of the six steps , and in ( b ) the integrated intensities are graphed in comparison with the ideal values .",
    "we note that the overall fidelity of the experiment , @xmath51 , implies an error per step of @xmath52 .",
    "this error rate is only about a factor of two larger than the average error per two - qubit gate obtained in a benchmark liquid - state nmr qip experiment @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the state - correlation fidelity of the @xmath10bc gate over the polarizations on all three qubits is @xmath53 . from fig .",
    "[ fig : fig3](b ) , it can be seen that the fidelity of the refresh operation drops off roughly quadratically in the number of steps ; this is consistent with the loss of bulk @xmath4h polarization due to pulse imperfections both in the multiple - pulse refresh operations and in the spin - locking sequence .",
    "since the broadband pulses have been optimized for flip - angle in these sequences , we suspect that the remaining errors are mainly due to switching transients that occur in the tuned rf circuitry of the nmr probehead , and to a lesser extent off - resonance and finite pulse - width effects that modify the average hamiltonian @xcite .",
    "similar effects lead to imperfect fidelity of the @xmath1c control . with suitable improvements to the resonant circuit response and by incorporating numerical optimization of the multiple - pulse refresh operations",
    ", we expect that several iterations of the protocol could be carried out and that the limiting polarization of @xmath54 could be approached in this system .",
    "the same methodologies should also be applicable in larger qubit systems with similar architecture .",
    "for a @xmath27-qubit system using the ppa , a bath polarization @xmath55 would be sufficient , in principle , to reach a pure state on one qubit @xcite .",
    "such bulk nuclear polarizations are well within reach via well - known dynamic nuclear polarization techniques @xcite ; for example , unpaired electron spins at defects ( @xmath56 ) in a field of @xmath57 t and at temperature @xmath58 k are polarized to @xmath59 . +",
    "this work demonstrates that solid - state nmr qip devices could be used to implement active error correction .",
    "given a bath polarization near unity , the refresh operation implemented here would constitute the dynamic resetting of a chosen qubit .",
