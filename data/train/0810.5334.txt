    "further studies have shown that so long as the coherence time @xmath2 of the memories is much longer than the transmission delay @xmath3 , where @xmath0 is the distance between the two parties and @xmath4 is the speed of light in the channel , the above assertion still holds @xcite .",
    "it is not clear , however , how the required resources scale in the limit of large distances when @xmath2 is finite . here",

    "we obtain this rate , in the steady state , assuming that the resources in our system are being successively used , according to a proper protocol , to create entangled states .",
    "such a rate - over - cost measure is useful for applications in quantum key distribution ( qkd ) @xcite , where the generation rate of secure key bits is proportional to the rate of entanglement generation .",
    "moreover , it provides us with a fair and practical measure for comparing different quantum repeater setups and their contrast with alternative schemes for entanglement distribution that do not rely on using quantum memories , such as quantum relay structures @xcite or the direct transmission of entangled photons . in the latter cases ,",

    "this approach can not fully capture the memory decay problem as it neglects to account for the corresponding waiting times during initial entanglement distribution .",

    "this simple model is not , however , sufficiently realistic to properly account for the effect of memory errors on the rate , especially in the regime of short coherence times .    in this paper , we introduce a partial nesting protocol , inspired by the blind repeater protocol proposed in @xcite , and find the throughput in the two cases of perfect and imperfect memories , with or without purification , for a generic quantum repeater system that relies on probabilistic schemes for initial entanglement distribution as well as for its entanglement connection . such probabilistic architectures for",
