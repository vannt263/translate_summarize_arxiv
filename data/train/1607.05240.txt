    "electrons moving in a periodic potential under the influence of external magnetic field is an extensively studied problem in low dimensional systems , giving rise to many novel phenomenon like quantum hall effect  @xcite and hofstadter butterfly  @xcite structure in the non - interacting limit .",

    "is governed by interplay between kinetic and interaction energies of electrons and underlying lattices .",
    "these are layered , triangular lattice systems and are characterized by the presence of localized ( @xmath6- ) and itinerant ( @xmath7- ) electrons .",
    "the geometrical frustration from underlying triangular lattice coupled with strong quantum fluctuations give rise to a huge degeneracy at low temperatures resulting in competing ground states close by in energy .",
    "therefore , for these systems one would expect a fairly complex ground state phase diagram and the presence of soft local modes strongly coupled with the itinerant electrons .",
    "it has proposed that these systems may very well be described by different variants of the falicov - kimball model ( fkm )  @xcite on a triangular lattice .",
    "the fkm was introduced to study the metal - insulator transitions in the rare - earth and transition - metal compounds  @xcite .",
    "the model has also been used to describe a variety of many - body phenomenon such as tendency of formation of charge and spin density wave , mixed valence , electronic ferroelectricity and crystallization in binary alloys  @xcite .",
    "recently ground state properties of spinless fkm on a triangular lattice with correlated hopping ( @xmath8 ) are reported  @xcite .",
    "the correlated hopping term was taken into account due to fact that in some rare earth compounds ( specially the mixed - valence compounds ) , the rare earth ions with two different ionic configurations @xmath9 and @xmath10 have different ionic radii .",
    "the contraction of @xmath7-orbitals in ions having @xmath10 configuration , for reduced screening of nuclear charge , leads to increased localization of @xmath7-electrons .",
    "hence the @xmath7-orbital overlap between nearest neighbors depends on local @xmath6-electron configurations of neighboring ions , resulting in a correlated hopping ( @xmath8 ) of @xmath7-electrons . in this study",
    "several charge ordered states of varying periodicities and phase segregated configurations was reported for different parameters e.g. filling , on - site interaction between @xmath7- and @xmath6-electrons ( @xmath11 ) and correlated hopping @xmath12 . in presence of correlated hopping phase segregation was seen even at smaller @xmath11-values .",
    "a rich phase diagram of localized electrons was reported due to combined effects of correlation and frustration on a triangular lattice .",
    "many numerical and exact calculations are available for different extensions of falicov - kimball model on bipartite and non - bipatatite lattices in the absence of magnetic filed taking into account interactions between itinearant and localized electrons  @xcite .",

    "exploring the role of magnetic field on the ground state configurations in the presence of correlated hopping @xmath8 will also be quite interesting .",
