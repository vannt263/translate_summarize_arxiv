    "letter improves so - called `` sir '' results in @xcite where the author analyzes two discrete - time autonomous linear systems whose motivation comes from a neural network point of view . in @xcite a dynamic - system - version of sir ( `` signal''-to-``interference '' ratio )",
    "concept is introduced .",
    "let s first present the definition of the sir in @xcite .",
    "the sir is an important entity in commucations engineering which indicates the quality of a link between a transmitter and a receiver in a multi transmitter - receiver environment ( see e.g. @xcite , among many others ) .",
    "for example , let @xmath5 represent the number of transmitters and receivers using the same channel .",
    "then the received sir at receiver @xmath9 is given by ( see e.g. @xcite )    @xmath10    where @xmath11 is the transmission power of transmitter @xmath9 at time step @xmath12 , @xmath13 is the link gain from transmitter @xmath14 to receiver @xmath9 ( e.g. in case of cellular radio systems , @xmath13 involves path loss , shadowing , etc ) and @xmath15 represents the receiver noise at receiver @xmath9 .",
    "typically , in cellular radio systems , every transmitter tries to optimize its power @xmath11 such that the received sir(k ) ( i.e. , @xmath16 ) in eq.([eq : cir ] ) is kept at a target sir value , @xmath17 .",
    "the author defines the following dynamic - system - version of the `` signal - to - interference - ratio ( sir ) '' , denoted by @xmath18 , by rewriting the eq.([eq : cir ] ) with neural networks terminology in @xcite and @xcite :    @xmath19    where @xmath18 is the defined fictitious `` sir '' at time step @xmath12 , @xmath20 is the state of the @xmath9th neuron , @xmath6 is the feedback coefficient from its state to its input layer , @xmath21 is the weight from the state of the @xmath14th neuron to the input of the @xmath14th neuron , and @xmath22 is constant .    in this paper",
    ", we improve the results in @xcite where the author examines the ultimate sir in the following two discrete - time autonomous linear systems whose motivation comes from a neural network point of view .    1 .",
    "the discretized autonomous linear system : + @xmath23 + which is obtained by discretizing the autonomous continuous - time linear system in @xcite using euler method ; where @xmath24 is the identity matrix , @xmath25 is a positive real number , and @xmath26 is the step size .",
    "2 .   a more general linear system with symmetric weight matrix + @xmath27 + where @xmath24 is the identity matrix , @xmath28 is a positive real number , and @xmath29 is the system matrix .    in @xcite , the above linear systems with symmetric matrices and with zero noise term are examined . in this paper , we relax these two conditions , and examine the sir in the general discrete - time autonomous linear system in eq.([eq : generaldls ] ) where the weight matrix @xmath30 is any real matrix whose largest ( single or multiple ) eigenvalue is real and its norm is larger than 1 .",
    "it s well - known that in the system of eq.([eq : generaldls ] ) , the eigenvalues of the weight ( system ) matrix solely determine the stability of the system . if the spectral radius of the matrix is larger than 1 , then the system is unstable .",
    "the spectral radius of an @xmath31 matrix is equal to @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the eigenvalues of the matrix . in this paper",
    ", we examine the linear systems with system matrices whose spectral radius is larger than 1 .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : the results for system eq.([eq : generaldls ] ) are presented in section [ section : usir ] .",
    "section [ section : simuresults ] presents some simple simulation results , followed by the conclusions in section [ section : conclusions ] .",
    "in this paper , we examine the sir in the following autonomous linear system @xmath34    where @xmath35 is state vector at step @xmath12 , @xmath30 is any real square matrix with linearly independent eigenvectors whose largest eigenvalue is real and its norm is larger than 1 , and vector @xmath2 is constant . in",
    "what follows , we present the main result of this paper :    _ proposition : _    in the discrete - time linear system of eq.([eq : generaldls ] ) , if the matrix @xmath1 has linearly independent eigenvectors , and if the ( single or multiple ) eigenvalue with the greatest norm is real and its norm is greater than 1 , then the defined `` sir '' ( @xmath36 ) in eq.([eq : cira ] ) for any state @xmath9 converges to the following constant within a finite step number denoted as @xmath37 for almost any initial vector @xmath38 .    @xmath39    where @xmath8 is the ( single or multiple ) eigenvalue with maximum norm and @xmath6 is the diagonal elements of @xmath7 .    from eq.([eq :",
    "generaldls ] ) , @xmath40    where @xmath38 shows the initial state vector at step zero .",
    "it s well known that any real square matrix @xmath7 whose eigenvectors are linear independent can be decomposed into ( see e.g. @xcite )    @xmath41    where the matrix @xmath42 has the eigenvectors in its columns , and matrix @xmath43 has the eigenvalues in its diagonal , and where    @xmath44    the matrices in eq.([eq : symw3 ] ) are given as    @xmath45_{n \\times n } ,   \\quad   { \\bf d}_{\\bf \\lambda } = \\left [ \\begin{array}{c c c c } \\lambda_1    &    0    & \\ldots   &   0 \\\\ 0      &    \\lambda_2 & \\ldots   &   0 \\\\ \\vdots &       & \\ddots   &   0 \\\\ 0      &    0    & \\ldots   &   \\lambda_n \\end{array } \\right]_{n \\times",
    "n } ,   \\quad   { \\mathbf u } = \\left [ \\begin{array}{c c c } \\longleftarrow   &   { \\bf u}_1^t   &   \\longrightarrow \\\\   \\longleftarrow   &   { \\bf u}_2^t   &   \\longrightarrow \\\\      & \\vdots   &   \\\\   \\longleftarrow   &   { \\bf u}_n^t   &   \\longrightarrow   \\end{array } \\right]_{n \\times n}\\ ] ]    from eq.([eq : symw2 ] ) , ( [ eq : symw3 ] ) and ( [ eq : matmvdu ] )    @xmath46    from eq.([eq : gendlsolution ] ) and ( [ eq : n1 ] ) ,    @xmath47    from the denominator of eq.([eq : cira ] ) , we define the interference vector , @xmath48 , as follows    @xmath49    where    @xmath50_{n \\times n}\\ ] ]    defining @xmath51 and @xmath52 , eq.([eq : solution ] ) is rewritten as    @xmath53    let s show the ( single or multiple ) eigenvalue whose norm is the greatest among the eigenvalues as @xmath8",
    ". then , in eq.([eq : solution_sum ] ) , the term related to the @xmath8 , whose norm is greater than 1 by assumption , dominates the sum .",
    "this is because a relatively small increase in @xmath54 causes exponential increase as time step evolves , which is shown in the following : let s define the following ratio    @xmath55    where @xmath56 represents the decrease ( increase ) .",
    "the @xmath57 in eq.([eq : expdeltal2 ] ) is plotted in figure 2 in @xcite for some different @xmath56 values .",
    "the figure 2 in @xcite implies that the term related to the @xmath8 dominate the sum in eq.([eq : solution_sum ] ) .",
    "so , there exists a finite step number @xmath37 such that    @xmath58    where @xmath59 is the eigenvalue corresponding to the @xmath8 . from eq.([eq : gendlsolution ] ) , ( [ eq : symak ] ) and ( [ eq : j_k ] )    @xmath60    using eq.([eq : solution ] ) and ( [ eq : j_k ] )    @xmath61    as in the steps from eq.([eq : solution_sum ] ) to eq.([eq : x_sp ] ) , we see in eq.([eq : jk_solution ] ) that the term related to the maximum eigenvalue @xmath8 in magnitude , ( which is greater than 1 by assumption ) , dominates the sum in ( [ eq : jk_solution ] ) . in other words , comparing eq.([eq : solution_sum ] ) , ( [ eq : x_sp ] ) and ( [ eq : jk_solution ] ) , we obtain that    @xmath62    where @xmath63 and @xmath64 as defined in eq.([eq : x_sp ] ) . using eq.([eq : x_sp ] ) in ( [ eq : jk_sp ] )    @xmath65    in eq.([eq : jk_sp ] )",
    ", we assume that @xmath66 , i.e. , @xmath38 is not completely perpendicular to @xmath67 defined above .",
    "that s why we say `` for `` almost '' any initial vector '' in the proposition phrase .",
    "however , this is something easy to check in advance .",
    "if it is the case , then this can easily be overcome by introducing a small random number to @xmath38 so that it s not completely perpendicular to the @xmath67 .",
    "so , from eq.([eq : j_sp2 ] ) ,    @xmath68    we conclude from eq.([eq : eta_maxl ] ) and from the `` sir '' definition in eq.([eq : cira ] ) that    @xmath69    where @xmath8 is the ( single or multiple ) eigenvalue of @xmath7 with the maximum norm and @xmath37 shows the finite time constant during which the @xmath8 become dominant in the sum of ( [ eq : solution_sum ] ) , which completes the proof .",
    "_ definition : _ state - specific ultimate sir value : in proposition 1 , we showed that the sir in ( [ eq : cira ] ) for every state in the autonomous discrete - time linear networks in eq.([eq : generaldls ] ) converges to a constant value as step number goes to infinity .",
    "we call this converged constant value as `` ultimate sir '' and denote as @xmath70 .",
    "does the result in the proposition above have any practical meanings ?",
    "our answer is yes . in @xcite and @xcite , we present some ( continuous - time and discrete - time ) networks which are stabilized by the ultimate sir as applied to the binary associative memory tasks as compared to the traditional hopfield neural networks .",
    "so , similar to the networks in @xcite , the proposed autonomous network here is    @xmath71    where @xmath24 is the identity matrix , @xmath7 is the system matrix , @xmath72^t$ ] , and @xmath73^t $ ] is the sir vector at step @xmath12 whose elements are given by eq.([eq : cira ] ) , the function @xmath74 gives 0 if and only if its argument vector is equal to zero vector , and gives 1 otherwise , and @xmath75 is the output of the network .",
    "the proof of the proposition above shows that in the linear network of ( [ eq : generaldls ] ) , the defined sir in eq.([eq : cira ] ) for state @xmath9 converges to the constant sir value in eq .",
    "( [ eq : theta_const_general ] ) , for any initial condition @xmath38 within a finite step number @xmath37 .",
    "it s seen that the linear networks of eq.([eq : generaldls ] ) is nothing but the underlying network of the proposed network without the @xmath74 function .",
    "since the `` sir '' in eq.([eq : cira ] ) exponentially approaches to the constant ultimate `` sir '' in eq.([eq : theta_const_general ] ) , the delta function will stop the exponential increase once @xmath76 , at which the system output reach its steady state response .",
    "so , the the presented network is stable",
    ". furthermore , we note that the proposed networks in @xcite and @xcite which have been applied to the binary associative memory systems are special cases of the proposed network in eq.([eq : sal - usir2 ] ) and ( [ eq : sal - usir2n ] ) .",

    "in this section , we borrow the simple simulation examples in @xcite with 8 and 16 neurons .",
    "we plot some samples of the evolution of the sirs with respest to step number in the system of @xcite whose weight matrix is presented in @xcite as well as in the system of eq.([eq : generaldls ] ) whose weight matrix is chosen randomly for illustration purpose .",

    "figure [ fig : sirplot_n8_dhamming2_sample1].b shows a sample evolution of sir in case of the system in eq.([eq : generaldls ] ) with a random weight matrix .",
    "some sample evolution plots for the 16-neuron case are shown in figure [ fig : sirplot_randomw_n16_dhamming1_sample1a ] for the system of eq.([eq : generaldls ] ) with random weight matrix .",
    "the figures [ fig : sirplot_n8_dhamming2_sample1 ] and [ fig : sirplot_randomw_n16_dhamming1_sample1a ] show that the sirs converge to their ultimate values and confirm the results in previous section .",
