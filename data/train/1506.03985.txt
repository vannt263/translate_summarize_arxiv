    "mathematically , two parties @xmath0 and @xmath1 are separable iff their joint state @xmath2 can be expressed as @xmath3 acting on the hilbert space @xmath4 , where @xmath5 and @xmath6 @xmath7 , @xmath8 and @xmath9 are density matrices acting on @xmath10 and @xmath11 respectively .",
    "if the joint state ca nt be written in the above form , we call them entangled @xcite .    deciding whether a unknown state of a given bipartite quantum system is entangled or separable , remains as a challenging problem @xcite right from the initial stage of quantum information theory .",

    "if the state @xmath15 is entangled state they can always get an average pay - off which is more than the case when @xmath40 is any separable state .",
    "so , from the average pay - off values , the referee can conclude whether the corresponding shared state was entangled or separable ( by knowing the maximum average payoff for all possible separable states ) . to produce outcomes of the game",
    ", each party has to perform local joint projective measurement on their individual inputs and their individual subsystems of the shared state , see figure 1 for details .",
    "[ fig1 ]    the authors of @xcite described the aforesaid projective measurement in the maximally entangled state @xmath41 with probability of output @xmath42 for given quantum input pair ( @xmath43 ) being @xmath44 and showed that if the average payoff function , @xmath45 then @xmath46 where , the maximization is performed over all possible separable state @xmath21 of the bipartite system .",
    "the outcome ( 1,1 ) is nothing but the successful projection on the state @xmath47 by the tensor product of the operator @xmath48 and @xmath49 is pay - off value corresponding to the input state @xmath50 .",
    "if we want to use @xmath51 as a signature of entanglement witness , it has to be proportional to @xmath52 , and the witness operator @xmath53 needs to be expressed as a linear combination of the tensor product of the transposed input states , @xmath54    which , in principle , is possible in this case as the inputs @xmath55 ( to alice ) and @xmath56 ( to bob)-supplied by the referee- are sufficient enough to span the respective vector space of witness operators on @xmath57 .",
    "then the referee will determine the values of @xmath49 accordingly prior to the game , such that he can identify whether the shared state is entangled from the sign of @xmath58 ) . indeed this can be done as @xmath59 is hermitian and transposed input density matrices are also hermitian .",
    "the referee just have to choose the input states @xmath55 and @xmath60 in order to form a complete set of operators \\ { @xmath61 } to express @xmath53 as a linear combination of these operators .    in this scenario ,",
    "accuracy in preparation of the input states must be trusted . in ref .",
    "@xcite , it is proved that no noise introduced in the local measurement operator can lower the bound @xmath62 for separable @xmath63 , so , in this scheme , separable state will never be identified as an entangled one . in this sense",

    "authors of ref .",
    "@xcite and @xcite , address entanglement detection of arbitrary two - qubit states in mdi way , but their approach focus on optimization of entanglement witness operator instead of the question of the universality of that , as we discuss throughout this article .",

    "thus , the input hilbert space is @xmath88^{\\otimes 4 } \\otimes [ \\mathbb{c}^2 ] ^{\\otimes 4 } = \\mathbb{c}^{16 } \\otimes \\mathbb{c}^{16 } $ ] instead of @xmath89 . as a result of that",

    "( [ witform ] ) .",

    ", @xmath142 may turn out to be negative and thereby @xmath128 has npt .",
    "so , two copies of the shared state , @xmath143 is enough to determine npt - ness while both the inputs @xmath144 and @xmath145 are density matrices on hilbert space @xmath146 . but for the general case , the players have to share ` @xmath147 ' number of copies of the state @xmath148 whenever referee wants to know the sign of the coefficient @xmath131 . also the dimension of the input states ( @xmath55 and @xmath60 to be supplied by the referee ) should increase accordingly . for the worst case , we have to go upto the coefficient @xmath149 for which we need @xmath150 copies of @xmath143 and @xmath144 and @xmath145 will be density matrices on the hilbert space @xmath151 . as , for _ any _ ppt state @xmath152 all of @xmath153 are non - negative , all the coefficients @xmath154 are non - negative .",

    "note that , these witness operators do nt depend on the shared state @xmath15 , and so , we can use the scheme similar to that described in section [ sectwo ] to implement the measurement of these operator in measurement device independent way .",
    "a notable point is that , for two - qubit case , under partial transposition , the shared density matrix can have only one negative eigenvalue , if the state is entangled @xcite .",
