    "in cases when solving the lippmann - schwinger or bethe - salpeter type of equation is numerically involved , one often resorts to a partial - wave decomposition ( pwd ) in the center - of - mass ( cm ) frame . in doing",
    "so one can exploit the spherical symmetry of the interaction and perform the integration over the two - dimensional solid angle of the intermediate momentum analytically . while this reduces the equation s dimension by two , one has to deal with summing the partial - wave series , and hence this procedure is beneficial when only a few partial waves dominate . in the case",
    "when many partial waves must be taken into account , when restriction to the cm frame is not desirable , or when the potential is not spherically - symmetric , the partial - wave expansion is not helpful and one has to face the complexity of three- or four - dimensional integral equations .",
    "fortunately , as had been noted by glckle and collaborators  @xcite in the context of the nucleon - nucleon ( @xmath1 ) interaction , the dependence on the intermediate momentum azimuthal angle factorizes and can still be performed analytically without employing any kind of expansion or truncation .",
    "while this procedure has been successfully applied a number of times to the @xmath1 situation  @xcite , here we would like to examine general conditions which potentials must satisfy to factorize the azimuthal integration .",
    "we then apply it to solve a specific example of relativistic potential scattering in the pion - nucleon ( @xmath0 ) system and compare with the usual method of using the partial - wave expansion .    in section",
    "ii we give the general requirements on the potential that allow one to remove the azimuthal angle dependence in the integral equation . in section",
    "iii we focus on the bethe - salpeter equation for @xmath2n scattering with one - nucleon - exchange potential and show in detail how the azimuthal - angle dependence can be integrated out in this case .",
    "furthermore , in section iv , we solve the resulting equation using a quasipotential approximation and compare the solution to the one obtained using the partial - wave expansion . in section",
    "v we examine an extension of this approach to the calculation of pion electroproduction from the nucleon including the @xmath0 final state interaction .",
    "our conclusions are summarized in section vi .",
    "the starting point in calculating observables of a two - body scattering process is an equation for the scattering amplitude .",
    "we shall assume relativistic scattering , in which case the equation is a 4-dimensional integral equation of the bethe - salpeter type : @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the sought t - matrix , @xmath5 is the two - particle propagator , and @xmath6 is the two - particle - irreducible potential .",
    "moreover , throughout the paper , @xmath7 , @xmath8 , @xmath9 stand for the relative 4-momenta of the incoming / intemediate / outgoing channel while @xmath10 is the total 4-momentum with @xmath11 , @xmath12 , @xmath13 and @xmath14 , @xmath15 , @xmath16 the incoming / intermediate / outgoing momenta of particle one and particle two , respectively .    in order to investigate the conditions under which the above equation can be integrated over the intermediate azimuthal angle we work in the helicity basis and only display the dependence on the azimuthal angle and helicity : @xmath17    an important point here is that the two - particle propagator @xmath5 can always be made independent of the intermediate angle @xmath18 by choosing the total three - momentum along the @xmath19-axis , i.e. , choosing the _ co - linear frame _ : @xmath20 .",
    "furthermore , we shall observe that in the case when only spin-0 and spin-1/2 particles are involved , the azimuthal - angle dependence of the fully off - shell potential in the co - linear frame is given as follows @xmath21 where @xmath22 and @xmath23 stand for the combined helicities of the initial and final state , respectively .",
    "the half - off - shell potential then takes a very simple form : .",
    "v_( , )    @xmath22 is the helicity of the on - shell state .",
    "it is in this case , when conditions and are met , the exact integration over the azimuthal - angle can readily be done .",
    "first , by using in , we see that the azimuthal dependence of the t - matrix is given by : t_( , ) = e^-it_(- ) e^i .",
    "since @xmath24 and @xmath25 only depend on difference @xmath26 , we expand them in a simple fourier series : v_ ( ) = _ m v^(m)_ e^im , t_ ( ) = _ m t^(m)_ e^im .",
    "it is straightforward to show that their fourier transforms , v^(m)_ = _ 0 ^ 2 v_ ( ) e^-i m , t^(m)_ = _ 0 ^ 2 t_ ( ) e^-i m , satisfy the following equation which does not involve the @xmath27-integration : t^(m)_ = v^(m)_ + _  v^(m)_g t^(m ) _  .    in principle",
    ", @xmath28 runs to infinity and so we have an infinite number of equations to solve even though they are not coupled .",
    "fortunately , since only the half off - shell potential is needed to solve the equations and it obeys condition , the corresponding fourier transform is non - vanishing only for @xmath29 : .v^(m)_|_half - off - shell = ._-m v_(0)|_half - off - shell .",
    "the scalar system is the simplest one where this procedure can be demonstrated . in that case",
    "the potential is a scalar function of scalar products of relevant 4-momenta : v(q,q ; p)=v(qq , pq , pq , q^2 , q^2 , p^2 ) given @xmath30 and similarly for @xmath9 , we easily convince ourselves that , in the co - linear frame , the azimuthal dependence enters only through the product : qq = q_0 q_0 - ||||and hence it is of the necessary form given in .",
    "furthermore , in the half - off - shell case the momentum of the on - shell state , say @xmath31 , can always be chosen along the @xmath19-axis , i.e. , such that @xmath32 .",
    "hence the half - off - shell potential is independent of azimuthal angles which fulfills condition for the spinless case .",
    "the two - particle propagator @xmath33 is of course independent of @xmath27 in the co - linear frame .",
    "once we have found that conditions and are satisfied , while @xmath5 is independent of @xmath27 , the integration over @xmath27 can be done immediately .",
    "we will now show this more explicitly for the more complicated case of a scalar - spinor system .",
    "consider the bethe - salpeter equation for the case of elastic scattering of a scalar with mass @xmath34  the `` pion ''  on a spinor with mass @xmath35  the `` nucleon '' .",
    "we attribute the momenta @xmath14 , @xmath16 to the nucleon and @xmath11 , @xmath13 to the pion .",
    "the relative 4-momentum of the incoming channel is conveniently defined by @xmath36 , where lorentz scalars @xmath37 and @xmath38 are given by & = & pp / s= ( s+m_n^2-m_)/2s , + & = & kp / s=(s - m_n^2+m_)/2s , with @xmath39 .",
    "similarly one defines @xmath40 and @xmath41 as the relative 4-momenta of the outgoing and intermediate state , respectively . in terms of these variables ,",
    "the two - body @xmath2n green s function of is : @xmath42    projecting the equation onto the basis of the nucleon helicity spinors ( defined in appendix a ) , we obtain @xmath43 where the helicity amplitudes are defined as t^ _  ( q,q , p)=(1/4 )    @xmath6 , while the defining equation for @xmath44 is    , with @xmath45 and @xmath46 .    the most general lorentz structure of the fully off - shell potential in the helicity basis can be written in the form ] ] v^_  ( q,q;p ) =    the dot - products of the relevant momenta , i.e. , a_i = a_i(qq , pq , pq , q^2 , q^2 , p^2 ) .",
    "considering the dependence of these functions on the azimuthal angles of @xmath31 and @xmath9 , we see that  in the _ co - linear frame _  it is given by the difference @xmath26 , for the reason described below .",
    "the rest of the @xmath27-dependence resides in the nucleon spinors .",
    "according to , in the co - linear frame we need to consider only @xmath47 where @xmath48 s are the pauli spinors ( cf .",
    "appendix  a ) , @xmath49 , @xmath27 and @xmath50 , @xmath51 define the orientation of @xmath52 and @xmath53 , respectively . since , ^_ ( , ) _ ( , ) & = & e^-ie^i , + ^_ ( , ) _ 3 _ ( , ) & = & e^-ie^i , we observe that the @xmath27-dependence of these elements is of the desired form  . and for the half - off - shell situation , where we can choose @xmath32 ( hence @xmath54 , in the co - linear frame ) and use @xmath55 , we find the form , ^_ ( , ) _ ( 0 , ) & = & e^-i(-) d^1/2_( ) , + ^_ ( , ) _ 3 _ ( 0 , ) & = & e^-i(-)(-1)^1/2- d^1/2_( ) , which obeys the necessary half - shell condition .",
    "therefore , we have demonstrated that the azimuthal - angle dependence of a pion - nucleon potential in the co - linear frame always satisfies conditions and .",
    "it is also apparent from that the two - particle green s function does not have any azimuthal dependence in that frame .",
    "thus the integration over @xmath27 can exactly be done in the bethe - salpeter equation for @xmath0 system by means of the procedure of sec .",
    "similar arguments apply in the case when both particles have spin 1/2 , _ e.g. _ , the nucleon - nucleon ( nn ) scattering .",
    "it should only be noted that in this case the potential satisfies conditions and with @xmath56 , @xmath57 . in other words , helicities of the two particles",
    "must be combined .",
    "the standard route to solution of a potential scattering equation such as is to decompose it into an infinite set of equations for partial - wave amplitudes , see e.g.  @xcite .",
    "the advantage of doing a partial wave decomposition is that the equation for each partial wave is of 2 lesser dimensions than the original equation , while the partial - wave series is usually rapidly converging , hence only the first few partial - wave amplitudes need to be solved for .    on the other hand , solving for the full amplitude",
    "directly has its own important benefits . and",
    "if the exact azimuthal - angle integration can be done _ a priori _ , the numerical feasibility of this approach becomes comparable to the pwd method .    in this section",
    "we would like to compare the two methods for the example of solving a relativistic equation for the @xmath0 system .",
    "for our toy - calculation potential we take the one - nucleon exchange , , and use the _ instantaneous _ approximation , thus neglecting retardation effects in the potential .",
    "the latter approximation allows us to perform the relative - energy ( @xmath58 ) integration such that we are left with a relativistic 3-dimensional salpeter equation : t_^(,;p ) = v^_(,;p ) + _   v^_  ( ,;p ) g_et^()(;p)t_^  (  , ; p ) , where the equal - time two - particle propagator in the cm system is given by @xmath59 this 3-dimensional equation for @xmath0 has been described in detail and solved using a pwd in the cm system by pascalutsa and tjon  @xcite .",
    "we , on the other hand , solve this equation by using the framework of the two previous sections to reduce the @xmath27-integration analytically and solve numerically the resulting 2-dimensional integral equation for the @xmath28-th fourier component of the full amplitude : @xmath60 where , without loss of generality , we have also assumed the cm frame .",
    "the explicit form of the fourier transform of the one - nucleon - exchange potential is worked out in appendix b.    let us emphasize that it is necessary to solve for only one of the fourier components ( either @xmath61 or @xmath62 ) , the other ones either vanish or can be obtained by relations due to the parity and time - reversal invariance .",
    "we solve by the pade approximants as in refs .",
    "@xcite thus maintaining exact elastic unitarity .",
    "the numerical integrations are performed by the gauss - legendre method . the integral over @xmath63 in contains the cut singularity at @xmath64[s-(m_{n}+m_{\\pi})^{2}]/4s}\\equiv \\hat q$ ] , which is handled by the well - known identity : @xmath65 where @xmath66 denoted the principal - value integral . when computing the latter the integration region is divided into two intervals : @xmath67 $ ] , and @xmath68 .",
    "the gaussian points are then distributed separately for each interval to make use of the property that an even number of gaussian points falls symmetrically with respect to the middle of the interval hence the singularity in the middle of the first interval is avoided .",
    "the polar angle integration is straightforward for both the principal value term and the imaginary contribution .",
    "we find it sufficient to use 16 gauss points for the momentum integration and 8 points for the polar - angle integration . upon increasing the number of points to 32 and 16 respectively , the results change by less than @xmath69 in the considered energy range . in all cases we found that 6 iterations combined with the use of pad approximants works extremely well .    after we solve to find the full @xmath0 @xmath4-matrix , we can of course also find the partial wave amplitudes : @xmath70 where @xmath71 is the angle between @xmath72 and @xmath73 .",
    "we then investigate the convergence of the partial wave series : @xmath74 in particular , in fig.[angle300f3 ] and fig.[energy1pif4 ] we plot the on - shell values of @xmath75 compared with the truncation of the partial - wave series for 3 terms and 5 terms ( i.e. , @xmath76 and @xmath77 respectively ) .",
    "angular dependence for @xmath78 at @xmath79 mev .",
    "solid line is the full calculation , dashed and dotted are the resumming of partial terms . ]",
    "energy dependence for @xmath80 at @xmath81 .",
    "the lines are defined the same as in fig.[angle300f3 ] ]    in order to compare the computational efficiency of the two methods , we compare the number of partial waves needed to achieve convergence in the pwd method with the number of gauss points for the polar - angle integration which appear in the `` w / o pwd '' method .",
    "the figures show that the effect of truncations of the partial - wave series increases with the angle ( fig .",
    "[ angle300f3 ] ) the energy of the incoming @xmath2 ( fig .",
    "[ energy1pif4 ] ) . in our particular case of one - nucleon exchange",
    "computing @xmath82 or more partial wave amplitudes is sufficient to reproduce the full result to a 1 per cent accuracy in a broad energy domain .",
    "thus , in this case , the efficiency of the two methods is comparable since we need 5 multipoles versus 8 gauss points of the polar - angle integration .",
    "it is important to emphasize that the ability to do the azimuthal - angle integration analytically is necessary to achieve comparable efficiency .",
    "we have checked that it usually takes at least 16 gaussian points for the azimuthal integration which slows down the calculation by more than an order of magnitude .",
    "our procedure for performing the analytic @xmath27-integration is applicable in the photo- or electro - meson production to first order in the electromagnetic coupling . here",
    "we describe the extension to the case of @xmath2 photoproduction within a simple final - state - interaction model  @xcite .",
    "the model begins with the following coupled channel equation : (    cc t _",
    "+ t _ & t _    ) =(    cc v _ & v _ + v _ & v _    ) + (    cc v _ & v _ + v _ & v _    ) (    cc g _ & 0 + 0 & g _    ) (    cc t _",
    "+ t _ & t _    ) where @xmath4 and @xmath6 are the amplitudes and driving potentials of the @xmath2n scattering @xmath83 , pion photo - production @xmath84 , absorption @xmath85 , and the nucleon compton effect @xmath86 , respectively .",
    "the above equations are solved up to first order in the electromagnetic coupling @xmath87 , hence preserving two body unitarity to this order only .    in solving the photoproduction scattering equation",
    "we calculate first @xmath88 as described for @xmath2n scattering and we then iterate in the following manner : @xmath89 where we used @xmath90 from time - reversal invariance .",
    "this solution procedure is obviously suitable for our case since the half - shell @xmath91 has a simple azimuthal angle dependence similar to the case of @xmath88 ( see ) .",
    "the reduced kernel ( see ) has two terms rather than the one term in the @xmath2n case due to the  complication \" of having to couple a spin 1 photon to spin 1/2 as opposed to coupling a spin 0 meson to spin 1/2 .",
    "for example , if one considers the nucleon u - channel exchange ( compare to the @xmath2n case in ) the half - shell photoproduction potential can be written as : v_^(q,q)= _ 1v_^(q_0,|*q*,q_0,|*q*|,)e^-i(--) + _",
    "2v_^(q_0,|*q*,q_0,|*q*|, ) e^-i(+) where @xmath92 represents the helicity of the incoming photon .",
    "one sees that when is iterated in two de - coupled scattering equations are obtained ( each corresponding to @xmath93 or @xmath94 ) . for each of these equations , one can show that the corresponding @xmath51 dependence re - appears after doing the @xmath18 integration and therefore once again we can perform the azimuthal - angle integration analytically .",
    "as in the @xmath2n case , the resulting  reduced  kernels obey 2-d integral equations .    as a check of our procedures we calculated the @xmath95-channel contribution to pion photoproduction using the analytic azimuthal - angle integration along with 2-d numerical integration and compared to the results of refs .",
    "@xcite obtained using the multipole expansion . at @xmath96 of @xmath97 mev with five multipoles we found agreement to better than 1% over a wide angular range .",
    "in recent years glckle and collaborators  @xcite introduced a method which greatly simplifies the numerical integration of two - body scattering equations without performing the partial - wave expansion .",
    "the method exploits a certain azimuthal symmetry of the potential thus allowing exact integration of the azimuthal dependence . in this paper",
    "we have established general form of the azimuthal - dependence of the kernel which allows for this procedure to go through . we have argued that these conditions is in general applicable to any system of spin- 0 and/or spin- @xmath98 particles    we have applied this method to the case of @xmath2n system and . with some extra effort it can be applied to higher spin systems , however the procedure becomed increasingly complex with the increase of the spin of the involved particles .",
    "we have successfully applied the method to pion photo- and electro - production from the nucleon , however only to the leading order in electromagnetic coupling .",
    "even though we have used the salpeter equation for or numerical exercises , the method can of course be applied to the full 4-d bethe - salpeter equation , which for the @xmath0 system has so far been solved in partial waves only  @xcite .",
    "performing the azimuthal - angle integration analytically greatly facilitates finding the full solution and makes the numerical feasibility of this approach comparable to finging the solution using the partial - wave expansion .",
    "we define the four - component nucleon helicity spinors as follows : u_(e_p,*p*)= (    c + 2    ) _ ( , ) where @xmath99 is the helicity , @xmath100 is the energy , @xmath71 and @xmath27 are the spherical angles of the 3-momentum @xmath101 , and @xmath102 is the two - component pauli spinor .",
    "the positive- and negative - energy nucleon spinors in the convention of kubis  @xcite are defined as follows : u_^()(*p * ) = u_(e_p,*p * ) , they satisfy the following orthogonality and completeness conditions : & & u_^ ( ) ( ) u_^( ) ( ) = _  _  , + & & _ , u_^ ( ) ( ) u_^ ( ) ( ) = 1 .",
    "the pauli spinors along the @xmath19-axis are given by @xmath103 while along an arbitrary direction @xmath104 they can be obtained using the wigner rotation functions : @xmath105 or , explicitly , @xmath106",
    "as an example , we consider the @xmath95-channel nucleon exchange potential given by the graph in and the following expression , @xmath107 ^ 2-m_n^2+i\\veps } \\gamma^{5 } \\gamma \\cdot ( \\beta p - q ) ] , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath37 and @xmath38 are defined in . for simplicity",
    "we choose the cm frame , where the potential in the helicity basis takes the form : @xmath108u_{\\rho''}^{\\lambda''}({\\bf q''})\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath109\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath110 \\nonumber\\\\ & & + ( p'^{2}+m_{n}^{2})(p''_{0}-\\rho '' e_{p '' } ) \\nonumber \\\\ & & + ( p''^{2}+m_{n}^{2})(p'_{0}-\\rho ' e_{p'}).\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    the azimuthal dependence @xmath111 arises from dirac spinors and from various scalar products involving the the four vector @xmath8 .",
    "choosing the vector part of the total momentum @xmath112 to be along the @xmath19-axis ( or to be zero in the cm frame ) allows the @xmath113 dependence , for the fully _ off - shell _ potential , to be displayed in the form : @xmath114 where @xmath115 , @xmath116 , and @xmath117 are factors which depend on the type of the diagram and of the exchanged particle , but are independent of the azimuthal angle .",
    "the quantities , @xmath118 @xmath119 are factors which result from the helicity spinors . in we have employed the usual trigonometric relation between two arbitrary directions defined by @xmath120 and @xmath73 : @xmath121    it is easy to see that the fully off - shell potential in has the azimuthal dependence of .",
    "furthermore , in iterating the quantization axis is defined by the _ on - shell _ relative momentum @xmath72 ( i.e. @xmath122 ) , hence reduces to @xmath123 , therefore the _ half - off - shell _ potential reduces to : @xmath124 which if of the form of the result in .",
    "therefore , the azimuthal angle dependence can be removed from the bethe - salpeter equation for this case .",
    "we achieved this result by explicitly displaying the azimuthal angle dependence and align @xmath125 with the z - axis so that only @xmath126 and @xmath127 appear in @xmath128 .",
    "the presence of @xmath129 or @xmath130 would introduce additional azimuthal angle dependence in the spinor matrix elements and make the algebra much more complicated .",
    "for the @xmath95-channel nucleon exchange the coefficients @xmath117 are : @xmath131 @xmath132 from these relations one can exactly identify the angular dependence of potential given in in the 4-product , @xmath133 the relative momenta @xmath9 and @xmath8 , defined in section ii , are to be introduced in - by @xmath134 and @xmath135    where @xmath136    after applying standard trigonometric manipulations :    @xmath137,\\ ] ] and @xmath138.\\ ] ]    the integral over the azimuthal angle of the intermediate momentum in can be reduced to integrals of the following type : @xmath139 for values @xmath140 , this definite integral can be evaluated analytically to obtain : @xmath141\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath142 .",
    "the results given above in work for all standard particle exchanges in the s , t , or u channels .",

    "in addition , @xmath145 will , in general , contain a sum of various terms corresponding to each diagram included .",
    "however , all of these terms can be evaluated using .",
