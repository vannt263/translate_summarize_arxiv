    "<S> we report a detailed study of the polymorphic transitions in ternary stannide cerusn on high quality single crystals through a combination of x  ray diffraction experiments conducted at 300 , 275 and 120  k , and measurements of the thermal expansion , magnetization , and resistivity , along main crystallographic axes . </S>",

    "<S> the compound undergoes two successive transitions , first to a quintuple ( @xmath1  k ) and than to a triple cecoal superstructure at @xmath2  k. the transitions are accompanied by a tremendous volume change due to a strong shrinking of the lattice along the @xmath0 axis , which is clearly observed in thermal expansion . </S>",
