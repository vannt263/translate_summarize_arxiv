    "cognitive radio ( cr ) has attracted a lot of interest in the last decade from research and industrial communities of communications and networking . in general",
    ", a cr system allows the spectrum utilization of a licensed frequency channel by a secondary system ( unlicensed ) without significantly affecting the efficiency of spectrum utilization of the primary ( licensed ) user  @xcite . in order to exploit this functionality , a new type of deployment",
    "is needed using nodes that acquire the knowledge of channels occupancy .",
    "the new demands for cr networks ( crns ) deployment have shown via the standardization activities that a new type of wireless sensor networks ( wsns ) will be shaped targeting to exploit the benefits of the efficient spectrum utilization  @xcite .",
    "this type of crns were named cognitive radio sensor networks ( crsns ) that require a customized handling in order to achieve the desire results  @xcite .",
    "several issues are raised from such a new application of wsns such as the error free spectrum sensing ( spse ) , new communication protocols based on the spse results  @xcite and new resource allocation mechanisms as packet relaying through the secondary nodes  @xcite .",
    "packet relaying has originally proposed first in  @xcite in which a secondary node retains two queues one for its own secondary packets and one for providing the relay of primary packets .",
    "based on this concept , the authors studied the maximum allowable throughput achieved by the cognitive user while maintaining the stability of the overall distributed queueing system .",
    "however , the delay imposed on the secondary packets was not studied . moreover ,",
    "the additional power budget required for the relaying process were not taken into account that is very important in case of crsns with limited power resources . a recent work in  @xcite",
    "has considered a cognitive relaying framework that manage to forward relaying information ; however , although delay expressions were given , still power constraints were not considered and an optimization solution is not provided in general . a more recent work in  @xcite",
    "presents the tradeoff between the sensing and the energy consumption with relays ; however , the relaying process is not taken place at the mac layer but at the physical layer looking into corresponding cooperative strategies . in  @xcite",
    ", authors first describe the delay and the power consumption required by the relaying process in crsns and in this paper we extend this work defining and solving a specific optimization problem highlighting useful insights in this new topic .    specifically , we analyse the delay of secondary packets and the power consumption which are both requirements for the implementation of the packet relaying at the secondary node .",
    "we consider that the secondary node ( i.e. cognitive ) retains its own traffic in the secondary queue while the relayed primary packets are stored in a separate devoted primary queue .",
    "the secondary node is able to control the admission of primary packets passed through the relaying primary queue using an admission control parameter .",
    "we assume a scheduling strategy that provides priority to relayed primary traffic over the secondary one . based on this cognitive radio model",
    ", we obtain the formulation of the secondary delay and the required power budget whereby we highlight the following relaying trade - off : _ on one hand , the admission of more primary packets will reduce the secondary delay and on the other hand , it will increase the required power budget_. this particular tradeoff can be investigated taking into account different objectives . in our case",
    ", we opt to formulate a minimization problem for the secondary delay over the admission control parameter i.e. acceptance factor subject to the constraint in the power budget and the separate stabilities rules of each individual queue .",
    "using optimization theory and decomposition methods in particular , since the original is complicated and depends on several constraints , we prove that indeed an optimal acceptance factor value exists under several conditions in which the minimum delay is achieved and yet the power budget is sufficiently kept in the specific upper bound .",
    "finally , we discuss the relaying behaviour considering different queue models for the secondary queue in terms of buffer size ( i.e. infinite or finite ) giving more light from practical point of view .    the rest of this paper is organized as follows : section ii provides the system model and the necessary assumptions .",
    "the analysis is provided in section iii , and in section iv we formulate the optimization problem and in the sequel we provide its solution .",
    "section v presents the different behaviour of the relaying queue with infinite and finite buffers while the simulation results are presented in section vi .",
    "this paper is concluded with section vii .",
    "we consider the cognitive radio sensor network depicted in fig .",
    "1 that consists of a pair of a primary user ( pu ) transmitter and receiver denoted as pu - tx and pu - rx respectively and a pair of a secondary transmitter ( su - tx ) and receiver ( su - rx ) . there are three links of interest namely the primary link between the pu - tx and pu - rx with a channel gain denoted by @xmath0 , the link between the su - tx and pu - tx with a channel gain denoted by @xmath1 and the link between the pu - rx and su - tx with a channel gain denoted by @xmath2 .",
    "all channel gains are assumed to be zero mean circularly symmetric complex gaussian random variable with variance @xmath3 and independent for all @xmath4 where @xmath4 takes the values @xmath5 , @xmath6 , @xmath7 and @xmath8 indicating the primary , secondary , primary to secondary and secondary to primary links respectively .",
    "each link is affected by complex additive white gaussian noise awgn with zero mean and unit variance and independent for all links .",
    "we assume that successful transmission is achieved when the instantaneous signal to noise ratio ( snr ) on the @xmath9 link , employing the maximum transmission power @xmath10 , given by @xmath11 , exceeds a predefined threshold @xmath12 .",
    "the considered scenario throughout this paper is that the su - tx utilizes the spectrum resource in order either to serve its secondary receiver ( su - rx ) whenever the primary link is idle or to serve the pu - rx by relaying the primary packets in case the primary link is not able to achieve adequate communication ( i.e. outage condition ) . in this fashion ,",
    "the su - tx plays two roles in the presented cr scenario such as giving on one hand the opportunity to forward the primary packets whenever the primary link experiences outage conditions and on the other hand to exploit the spectrum for itself whenever is not used by the primary link thus forwarding the secondary packets to its own user . henceforth , we consider that the su - tx maintains two queues denoted as @xmath13 and @xmath14 for serving its own packer i.e. secondary packets and the primary packets respectively .",
    "moreover , we assume that the pu - tx retains a queue @xmath15 to store its own primary packets . afterwards , the presented model assumes that the su - tx has the capability to relay or not to relay the primary packets and this is a matter of making a decision taking into account the current channel conditions .",
    "+    for simplicity we assume that all packets are transmitted in a time - slotted fashion where they have the same size and one time slot is required for transmission of a single packet .",
    "initially , we assume that all queues are of infinite lengths",
    ". the packet arrival processes of self - traffic at each node are independent and with mean arrival rates @xmath16 and @xmath17 ( packet / slot ) for the @xmath15 and @xmath13 queues respectively . the mac layer is assumed to obey the following protocol . at a certain time slot and given the priority to grant the pu unconditional access to the channel , the pu - tx transmits a packet to the primary destination i.e. pu - rx .",
    "a correctly received packet by the primary destination is acknowledged by sending an ack message resulting in the primary queue @xmath15 dropping this packet . in case of packet failure ( indicated by ack timeout ) and assuming that the su - tx can listen to all pu - tx transmissions , the su - tx can accept a fraction of the undelivered primary packets in its relaying queue @xmath14 , if it was able to correctly decode them and send ack messages to the primary destination pu - rx . in case both the su - tx and the pu - rx fail to decode the primary data , a retransmission of the packet is initiated by the pu - tx .",
    "we assume that the overhead for transmitting the ack and nack messages is very small compared to packet sizes .",
    "in addition , we assume that the ack messages are always decoded perfectly at the pu - rx and the su - tx . at the beginning of each time slot , the su - tx is allowed to sense the channel and if it is declared idle , the su - tx transmits from one of its queues under the conditions discussed below .",
    "in this section , we present , the analysis and the corresponding metrics of interest for the considered cognitive sensor node with packet relaying capabilities .",
    "we tackle with two performance metrics and obtain their formulation and how these metrics are involved in the decision making mechanism at the su - tx for deciding on relaying the primary packets .",
    "the metrics considered are the su - tx s delay introduced to the secondary packets in the @xmath13 , called secondary delay and the power budget required by the @xmath14 to forward the primary packets .",
    "we assume a relaying factor @xmath18 $ ] that is managed by the su - tx for making the decision to relay or not relay the secondary packets . increasing @xmath19 to @xmath20 means that no admission control is accomplished at the @xmath14 thus relaying with any restriction is taken place and making @xmath19 equal to @xmath21 means that no relaying is accomplished thus the packets are blocked from the assumed admission control mechanism .",
    "relied on this factor , the su - tx performs the following scheduling strategy called prioritized cognitive relaying ( pcr ) where the primary packets have always priority against the secondary ones  @xcite . in particular , using this strategy , when an idle slot is detected , the su - tx attempts to access the primary channel in order to transmit first the primary packets using the relaying queue @xmath14 .",
    "if possible , the su - tx uses the minimum transmission power level sufficient to achieve the target ( signal - to - noise - ratio ) snr threshold @xmath22 at the primary destination which is equal to @xmath23 .",
    "thus , an outage probability is defined for each link denoted as @xmath24 with @xmath4 the index for each link .",
    "if the link between the relay and the primary destination experiences a deep fade or the relaying queue is empty , the su - tx will transmit from the secondary traffic queue @xmath13 ( its own traffic ) with the same procedure . according to the adopted pcr , the arrival and service rates of the crsn denoted as @xmath25 and @xmath26 for each @xmath4 queue respectively",
    "encompass the relaying factor @xmath19 in their formulation as follows :    * primary queue service rate @xmath27 : the primary queue @xmath15 will forward the packets once the primary link does not experience outage and when the primary to secondary link does not also experience outage taking into account the relaying factor and thus it is obtained as @xmath28 * relaying queue arrival rate @xmath29 : the relaying queue @xmath14 will arrive the packets once the primary link does not experience outage taking into account the relaying factor and when the primary to secondary link does not experience outage taking into account the outage of the primary link and thus it is obtained as @xmath30 * relaying queue service rate @xmath31 : the relaying queue @xmath14 will forward the packets once the secondary to primary link does not experience outage and thus it is obtained as @xmath32 * secondary queue service rate @xmath33 : the secondary queue @xmath13 will forward the secondary packets once the secondary to primary link does not experience outage and when the secondary link is also free of outage and thus it is obtained as @xmath34    where the outage probability @xmath24 for a given threshold in snr @xmath22 is obtained as follows @xmath35=1-e^\\frac{\\gamma_{th , i}}{\\sigma_i^2 p_i}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]      in this section , we analyse the secondary delay i.e. the delay experienced at the queue @xmath13 based on the considered traffic models for all queues in the system .",
    "firstly , we will deal with the primary queue @xmath15 . per the discussion given in  @xcite and  @xcite about the dominant systems",
    ", it is concluded that the primary queue can be uncoupled from the overall system of queues .",
    "this isolation allows us to model the primary queue as an @xmath36 queue .",
    "hence , the expected value of the delay imposed on the primary packets in the primary queue is given by : @xmath37    notably , each node chooses its arrival rate based on the application such that satisfying the stability conditions of its queue . for more detailed discussion about the stability and its conditions ,",
    "the reader is referred to  @xcite . for the relaying queue @xmath14 and the secondary queue @xmath13",
    ", we model their traffic model by adopting an @xmath38 priority queuing model . while their inter - arrival times are poisson random variables , we can model their service times ( @xmath39 and @xmath40 ) as geometric random variables based on the description of the scheduling strategy in   @xcite .",
    "the geometric random variables parameters @xmath41 and @xmath42 are given by @xmath31 and @xmath33 for the relaying queue and the secondary queue respectively .",
    "the first and the second moments of the average service time for the relaying queue ( @xmath43 $ ] and @xmath44 $ ] ) are given as follows @xmath45 = \\frac{1}{p_{ps}}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath46 = \\frac{1-p_{ps}}{p_{ps}^2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with the same logic , we can obtain the first and the second moments of the average service time for the secondary queue i.e. @xmath47 $ ] and @xmath48 $ ] .",
    "we are now ready to analyse and derive the secondary delay based on the delay experienced at secondary packets i.e. secondary queue @xmath13 that can be produced by three distinguished factors according to the model presented in   @xcite .",
    "taking also into account the scheduling strategy presented above , the different delay factors for a secondary packet of interest inside the secondary queue is assembled as follows :    1 .",
    "the waiting time for the currently transmitted packet being served in the secondary queue @xmath13 i.e. once the packet of interest is arrived well known as the ` residual ' time denoted as @xmath49 2 .",
    "the waiting time for being served the packets already appeared in the secondary queue @xmath13 upon the arrival of the packet of interest denoted as @xmath50 3 .",
    "the waiting time for being served the primary packets either from the primary queue @xmath15 or the relaying queue @xmath14 that will be appeared in that queues after the arrival of the packet of interest in the secondary queue @xmath13 denoted as @xmath51    we donate as @xmath52 the utilization factor for each queue @xmath4 that is given in general by the formula @xmath53 $ ] .",
    "the expected value of the delay @xmath49 will be the sum of the residual time at the secondary queue and the primary queue obtained as follows @xmath54}{2e[s_s]}+\\frac{\\rho_ps}{1-\\rho_p}\\frac{e[s_{ps}^2]}{2e[s_{ps}]}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath55 is the conditional probability , that the packet of @xmath9 user is being transmitted given that no primary packet is transmitted .",
    "we consider now the second component delay @xmath50 which as explained is due to other packets in the secondary queue found by the new arrival . considering the _",
    "little s _ law of queuing theory on which the long - term average number of customers in a stable system is equal to the long - term average effective arrival rate , @xmath56 , multiplied by the average time a customer spends in the system , we obtain the following formulation considering the summary of the waiting times introduced from the primary and secondary queues respectively @xmath57 in the same concept i.e. the little s law , we can define the third component delay @xmath51 where only the delay from the primary packets is considered as follows @xmath58 by adding the three components we can obtain the delay of the secondary queue @xmath13 that eventually become @xmath59}{2e[s_s]}+\\frac{\\rho_{ps}}{1-\\rho_p}\\frac{e[s_{ps}^2]}{2e[s_{ps}]}+2\\rho_p \\bar{d_p}}{1-\\rho_s}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]      except the delay at the secondary queue @xmath60 , the other important metric for our model is the power consumed on the relayed traffic relative to the total power consumed by the su - tx . an expression for the average power consumed by the su - tx on its own traffic as well as the relayed packets is analysed below . to this end , we define the relaying power budget as _ the ratio between the average power per slot consumed on the relaying effort @xmath61 and the total average power per slot consumed @xmath62 _ that is expressed as follows @xmath63}{\\lambda_{ps}e[p_{sp}]+\\lambda_{s}e[p_{s}]}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath64 $ ] is the average transmission power per relayed packet that is obtained as below considering the assumption of the considered crsn . first , the transmission power consumed on a relayed primary packet is @xmath65 where it is a random variable since it depends on the channel gain @xmath66 which is a chi - square distributed random variable . to calculate the average power per packet consumed on relaying ,",
    "we need the probability density function ( pdf ) @xmath67 that is defined as follows @xmath68 where @xmath69 that is obviously an exponential random variable .",
    "considering both ( [ eq13 ] ) and ( [ eq14 ] ) , we can assume the following for the pdf @xmath70 since the @xmath67 can not exceed the maximum limit @xmath71 then the average power can be obtained as follows @xmath72 = p(x ) = \\int_0^{p_{sp}^ * } p{sp}p(p_{sp } ) dp_{sp } \\\\    & = & \\int_0^{p_{sp}^ * } \\frac{\\gamma_{th , sp}}{\\sigma_{sp}^2 p_{sp } } e^{-\\frac{\\gamma_{th , sp}}{\\sigma_{sp}^2 p_{sp}^2 } }   dp_{sp } , \\forall p_{sp } \\geq 0\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] let @xmath73 and then @xmath74 that will give the lower limit of the integration as equal to @xmath75 and the upper limit as infinite where finally we have @xmath76= \\frac{\\gamma_{th , sp}}{\\sigma_{sp}^2 } \\int _ { \\frac{\\gamma_{th , sp}}{\\sigma_{sp}^2 p_{sp}}}^{\\infty } z^{-1 } e^{-z } dz\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the integral in ( [ eq18 ] ) is known as the upper incomplete gamma function and is calculated using ` the exponential integral '  @xcite denoted as @xmath77 $ ] and thus we have the following formulation @xmath78= \\frac{\\gamma_{th , sp}}{\\sigma_{sp}^2 } e_1(\\frac{\\gamma_{th , sp}}{\\sigma_{sp}^2 p_{sp } } ) = \\frac{\\gamma_{th , sp}}{\\sigma_{sp}^2 } \\varepsilon_{sp}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] substituting ( [ eq19 ] ) into ( [ eq13 ] ) and maintaining some simplification , yields @xmath79",
    "in the previous section , we analysed and established the formulation of the secondary delay @xmath60 and the required power budget @xmath80 of the secondary queue @xmath13 in relation to the acceptance factor @xmath19 of the admission control policy applied at @xmath13 . in this section",
    ", we present the relaying tradeoff by which the decision making to relay or not to relay will be built .",
    "this decision is based on the fact that on one hand increasing the acceptance factor @xmath19 the average delay @xmath60 increases and on the other hand the power budget increased is proportional to acceptance factor as depicted in fig.2 for some specific values of the considered network .     and",
    "power budget @xmath80,title=\"fig : \" ] +    this behaviour led us to the definition of a minimization problem over the acceptance factor @xmath19 considering the average delay @xmath60 as an objective function subject to a constraint on the required power budget @xmath80 . taking into account the constraints imposed by keeping the stability of each queue , then the optimization problem can be defined as follows    @xmath81    this problem is highly complicated and thus difficult to solve in this form due to the following reasons :    1 .   the objective function @xmath60 is not easily differentiable over the acceptance factor @xmath19 2 .",
    "there are four complicated coupling constraints related to the acceptance factor @xmath19 3 .",
    "the expectation is taking over three random variables @xmath82,@xmath83",
    "and@xmath84    henceforth , we will adopt the concept of decomposition methods for solving this optimization problem  @xcite .",
    "we will use decomposition methods in order to decompose the original complicated problem into equivalent sub - problems as presented in   @xcite  @xcite .",
    "the existing decomposition techniques can be classified into primal decomposition and dual decomposition methods ",
    "the primal decomposition provides the decomposition of the original primal problem and it is appropriate when the objective function is formulated over two parameters . on the contrary ,",
    "the dual decomposition is based on decomposing the lagrangian dual problem derived from lagrange multiplier application  @xcite .",
    "the problem is convex as it is proved in the appendix although using decomposition the dual problem can always be considered convex .    in our problem",
    ", we will follow an hierarchical decomposition that applies to our layered architecture by changing the primal and dual decompositions recursively .",
    "in particular , the basic decompositions are repeatedly applied to the problem to obtain smaller and smaller sub - problems .",
    "this approach corresponds to first applying a full dual decomposition , and then a primal one on the dual problem .",
    "as illustrated in fig.3 the master problem is decomposed into two levels using dual decomposition for the two pairs of constraints where the first level includes one lower and one higher master problems and the second level includes the dual and primal decomposition of the resulted master problems .",
    "+      for the problem in ( [ eq21 ] ) , we will use first dual decomposition using the following two pairs of constraints .",
    "which pair of constraints will be used is a matter of discussion and depends on how the system should be converged and stabilized . in general , using decomposition methods , the convergence and stability are guaranteed if the lower level problem is solved on a faster time scale than the higher level problem .",
    "thus , we choose to have at the low level the stabilities of primary and secondary queues @xmath15 and @xmath13 since we want to converge first in these constraints and at the high level the stability of secondary - primary queue @xmath14 and power budget @xmath80 is retained that are more significantly demanding for the considered optimization problem .",
    "going into details , while working at the first level , we obtain the lagrangian function of ( [ eq21 ] ) considering the constraints of the stability of secondary - primary queue @xmath14 and power budget @xmath80 that can be written as follows @xmath85 in which the lagrangian dual problem is based and obtained as follows @xmath86 the dual function in ( [ eq22 ] ) serves as a lower bound on the optimal value of the primal problem ( [ eq20 ] ) .",
    "for instance , if we denote the minimization problem in ( [ eq23 ] ) as @xmath87 and the optimal value of ( [ eq21 ] ) by @xmath88 , then the inequality @xmath89 holds for any non - negative values of @xmath90 and @xmath91 . having defined the lower master problem as in ( [ eq23 ] ) then the higher master problem using the dual optimization problem of ( [ eq21 ] ) is formulated as    @xmath92    this approach provides in fact the solution of the dual problem instead of the original primal one and it will only give appropriate results if strong duality holds .",
    "the problem in ( [ eq24 ] ) is convex even if the original problem is not convex because it is the point wise maximum of a family of affine function @xmath93 , and thus the karush ",
    "tucker ( kkt ) conditions are satisfied and the duality gap is indeed zero   @xcite .",
    "afterwards , we can solve the primal problem by solving the dual problem based on the dual function @xmath87 .",
    "this type of problem is solved by using iterative gradient or sub - gradient algorithms according to the differentiable capabilities of the dual problem . in our case , since the dual function is not differentiable , we will choose the sub - gradient solution   @xcite .",
    "the iterative algorithm will be described at the end of this section in conjunction with the solution of second level decomposition described in the next section .",
    "after the dual decomposition performed at the first level , the derived lower and higher master problems expressed by ( [ eq23 ] ) and ( [ eq24 ] ) respectively will be solved using dual and primal decomposition methods respectively .",
    "more specifically , the lower master problem presented by ( [ eq23 ] ) will be solved using dual decomposition since the optimization parameter is still the acceptance factor @xmath19 .",
    "thus , we obtain the lagrangian function of ( [ eq23 ] ) considering the constraints of the stability of secondary and primary queues that can be written as follows @xmath94 in which the lagrangian dual problem is based and obtained as follows @xmath95 for the known reasons discussed previously for the first level decomposition , the dual optimization problem of ( [ eq23 ] ) is written as @xmath96 where @xmath97 is the minimization problem in ( [ eq26 ] ) . again , as we will see below the dual problem in ( [ eq27 ] ) will be solved by using an iterative sub - gradient algorithm .    the higher master problem at the first level expressed by ( [ eq24 ] ) will be solved by using primal decomposition since the optimization is over two parameters i.e. @xmath90 and @xmath91 .",
    "this will be separated again into two levels of optimization for each optimization parameter and thus two sub - problems are produced named lower and higher sub - problems . in the same notion , which sub - problem will be considered lower or higher",
    "depends on the convergence conditions that we are willing to retain . to this end",
    ", we prefer to keep at the higher level the optimization over the lagrange multiplier @xmath91 that is related to the power budget constraint .",
    "afterwards , the lower sub - problem is defined as follows over the lagrange multiplier @xmath90 @xmath98 while in parallel at the higher level , we have the following problem in charge of updating the coupling variable @xmath91 by solving @xmath99 where @xmath100 is the optimal objective value of problem ( [ eq28 ] ) for a given @xmath91 . both lower and higher sub - problems in ( [ eq28 ] ) and ( [ eq29 ] ) are convex since the original problem in ( [ eq24 ] ) is a convex optimization as represents the dual problem of the master primal problem",
    "therefore , based again on sub - gradient method , we will use an iterative algorithm where the lower problem in ( [ eq28 ] ) will converge first for given @xmath91 .",
    "details will be given below for the overall algorithm .",
    "if we gather all aforementioned decompositions in one formula , we will realize that the equivalent optimization problem of the original problem in ( [ eq21 ] ) can be written as follows @xmath101    equation ( [ eq30 ] ) substitutes the original optimization problem in ( [ eq21 ] ) where the constraints have been introduced multiplied with the lagrange multipliers @xmath90,@xmath91 and @xmath102 that are actually the karush  kuhn ",
    "tucker ( kkt ) conditions and they can be considered as shadow prices giving a freedom to potentially improve our objective function i.e. minimize the average delay . the additional decrease in the objective function is accomplished due to the relaxation of some of the given constraints ",
    "usually , how much performance improvement we can achieve by over - optimizing the objective function is determined by an allowable gap .",
    "however , as we will see from the simulation results , we can achieve better relaying tradeoffs without breaking the initial rules i.e. the constraints .",
    "all this discussion will throw more light on the formulated relaying tradeoff by looking into the sensitivity ( shadow prices ) analysis based on the formulated kkt conditions that retains the restrictions of the initial constraints   @xcite .",
    "finally , the equivalent problem in ( [ eq30 ] ) will be solved by the following iterative subgradient - based algorithm as has been derived from the hierarchical decomposition described above .    1 .",

    ", we can prove the existence of the subgradient @xmath97 and then the problem can be solved by algorithm 1 , which requires the calculation of the subgradients @xmath87 and @xmath97 at each of their own iteration .",
    "one important issue in networks in general is to model the traffics of the primary users and secondary users   @xcite. in this section , we will translate the acceptance factor @xmath19 into a specific metric of @xmath38 queuing model throwing more light on the performance impact in the considered cognitive radio model under realistic applications . more specifically , since the acceptance factor determines whether or not a new primary flow can be admitted to the secondary queue , we can merge it in the overflow probability and blocking probability for the infinite and finite buffer cases respectively   @xcite.    _ infinite buffer _ : although in case of infinite buffer , the notion of admission control can not be claimed , we can adopt the term of overflow or tail probability that is defined as the probability in which an arriving packet finds no room in the hypothetical queue .",
    "this aspect is identical to the example where in a waiting room , there is limited number of chairs for the customers , and any customer that upon arrival does not find a seat has to stand  @xcite .",
