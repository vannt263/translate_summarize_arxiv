    "although such particularly regular ( or irregular ) trajectories may be very rare , they may be responsible for important physical phenomena as is the case for chemical reactions , where trajectories passing through unstable saddle points regions carry the system from one chemical species to another @xcite .",

    "the coefficient @xmath9 , the long - time averaged growth rate of infinitesimally small displacements defined as @xmath10 is called the lyapunov exponent of the system .",

    "since lyapunov exponents are defined as long - time averages , in an ergodic system every initial condition will yield the same @xmath9 . for finite periods of time",
    "however , trajectories can display very different chaotic properties .",
    "an example are trajectories in `` sticky regions '' in the phase space of the standard map , in which trajectories can spend a long time before escaping away into more chaotic regions @xcite .",
    "other parts of phase space may be filled with regular periodic orbits that have a vanishing lyapunov exponents and are dynamically disconnected with the chaotic surroundings . to describe such behavior of individual trajectories of finite length",
    "it is convenient to consider so - called finite time lyapunov exponents @xmath11 that depend on the initial condition @xmath12 and on the temporal trajectory length @xmath13 , @xmath14 such finite time lyapunov exponents can be used to quantify the chaoticity of finite length trajectories .",
    "one difficulty occurring in the definition of the finite time lyapunov exponent of equ .",
    "( [ equ_finite_time_lyapunov_exponent ] ) , however , is that @xmath15 also depends on the initial orientation of the displacement vector @xmath16 .",
    "this vector reorients into the direction of fastest growth , but , depending on the degree of chaos prevalent in the respective phase space region , this reorientation may take a time long with respect to the trajectory length @xmath13 .",
    "in fact , the time @xmath17 it takes to turn the displacement vector into the direction of the fastest growth is inversely proportional to the difference of the two largest lyapunov exponents @xmath18 @xcite . here ,",

    ", this procedure can require the computation of long additional trajectory segments causing large computational costs .",
    "an alternative way to quantify the chaoticity of individual finite length trajectories consists in determining the _ relative lyapunov indicator ( rli ) _",
    "@xcite , originally introduced to detect chaotic dynamics in planetary systems .",
    "this measure has been proven particularly useful to distinguish regular from chaotic trajectories in systems that are only weakly chaotic .",
    "the main idea of the rli is to exploit the fact that in the chaotic regions of phase space , finite time lyapunov exponents vary discontinuously as a function of the initial condition , i.e. ,  adjacent points can have very different local expansion rates @xcite .",
    "the rli is defined as the magnitude of the difference @xmath24 between the finite time lyapunov exponents of two trajectories separated by a small but finite amount @xmath25 , @xmath26 it has been shown that the rli is insensitive both to the separation @xmath25 as well as to the initial infinitesimal phase space displacement @xmath16 used to calculate the finite time lyapunov exponents @xmath27 . to reduce fluctuations ,",
    "one can average the rli over time , @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the time step used for the numerical integration of the equations of motion . in the following",
    "we will use this smoothed version of the rli to characterize the chaoticity of individual trajectories in various dynamical systems .",
    "as outlined in the introduction , the goal of the work presented in this paper is to identify trajectories that have particular stability properties .",
    "for instance , one might be interested in locating regions of phase space that are populated by regular trajectories or in finding those pathways that are most chaotic . to do that , we start by defining an ensemble of trajectories including an additional weight that favors trajectories with the desired chaoticity properties .",
    "we assume that the dynamics generates a stationary distribution @xmath30 .",
    "since we consider only deterministic systems here , we represent trajectories of length @xmath13 by their initial phase space point @xmath12 and define the _ lyapunov weighted path ensemble _ ( lwpe ) as @xmath31 where the factor @xmath32 normalizes the distribution . here , the parameter @xmath33 , which can be viewed as conjugate to the chaoticity indicator @xmath34 , controls how strongly the weight of initial condition @xmath12 is changed according to the chaoticity of the trajectory evolving out of @xmath12 .",
    "an analogous ensemble of trajectories can be easily defined using finite time lyapunov exponents if they can be calculated accurately ( simply replacing @xmath34 with @xmath35 in the above equation ) .",
    "large positive values of @xmath33 favor strongly chaotic trajectories with a large chaoticity indicator . for negative @xmath33s ,",
    "on the other hand , weakly chaotic or regular trajectories with a small chaoticity indicator are given a larger weight in the ensemble .",
    "note that a similar ensemble of trajectories can easily be constructed also for stochastic dynamics and appropriately defined lyapunov exponents .",
    "we sample the lyapunov weighted path ensemble with a technique borrowed from transition path sampling @xcite , a method originally developed to simulate rare but important transitions between long - lived stable states as they occur , for instance , in protein folding , chemical reactions and first order phase transitions . in a transition path",

    "the results obtained for this simple model of a chemical reaction indicate that it is possible to use lyapunov weighted path sampling to find rare reactive trajectories that pass through saddle points in the potential energy surface as they connect long - lived stable states with each other .",
    "further studies will be necessary to clarify to which degree identifying such trajectories is made difficult by the chaos arising from degrees of freedom not directly coupled to the reaction ( for instance solvent degrees of freedom ) and possibly eclipsing the dynamical instability of the reactive subsystem .",
    "it will also be interesting to investigate whether chaoticity indicators such as the maximum lyapunov exponent , the kolmogorov - sinai entropy or the relative lyapunov indicators used in the present study correlate with the measures of mobility used by chandler and collaborators to link the glass transition with a first order phase transition in trajectory space @xcite . in their work , these authors started from the equilibrium distribution of pathways and added to it a bias that favors trajectories with low dynamical activity .",
    "chandler an coworkers demonstrated numerically that this transition displays all the features of a first - order transition occurring in trajectory space .",
    "it would be interesting to study if an analogous bias based on chaoticity indicators also leads to an equivalent first order transition in path space .",
    "in such research it may be fruitful to combine lyapunov weighted path sampling with advanced equilibrium simulation methods such as umbrella sampling @xcite , metadynamics @xcite , or parallel replica sampling @xcite directly acting on chaoticity indicators .",
    "this work was supported via a junior research fellowship of pg at the erwin schrdinger international institute for mathematical physics ( esi ) in vienna and by the austrian science fund ( fwf ) under grant p20942-n16 .",
    "the calculations were carried out , in part , on the vienna scientific cluster ( vsc ) ."
