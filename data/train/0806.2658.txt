    "the so - called `` uv - upturn '' phenomenon @xcite , i.e. , the rising ultraviolet emission shortward of 2000  , sometimes featuring in the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) of elliptical galaxies and the bulges of spirals , has been for long a puzzling problem for old galaxy environments dominated by stars of mass comparable to the sun .",
    "in fact , the implied existence of an important contribution of ( long - lived ) b stars , hotter than @xmath9  k and providing up to about 2% of the galaxy bolometric luminosity @xcite , has been alternately identified with different evolutionary stages .",
    "such stages include binaries @xcite , blue stragglers @xcite , blue horizontal - branch ( hb ) stars @xcite , asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) _ manqu _ stars @xcite , and post - agb nuclei of planetary nebulae ( pne ) @xcite ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* , for an exhaustive review , and a more recent update by @xcite )    resolved color  magnitude ( c - m ) diagrams of stellar populations in m32 @xcite have definitely shown that even its relatively poor uv emission almost entirely arises from a fraction of hot hb stars , further complemented by a minority contribution from post - agb pn nuclei . still , facing the established interpretative scenario ,",
    "one is left with at least three important issues that need to be assessed to understand the real nature of the uv - upturn phenomenon . _",
    "( i ) _ the canonical evolutionary framework experienced in galactic globular clusters naturally predicts a blue hb morphology only for old , metal - poor stellar populations @xcite .",
    "if this is the case for ellipticals too , then uv stars should represent the @xmath10 tail of a ( supposedly ) broad metallicity distribution seen to peak at much higher values , around solar abundance .",
    "clearly , a more composite picture might be envisaged once one admits non - standard models ( i.e. , including the effects of stellar rotation , helium mixing , differential mass loss , etc . ) to account , in particular , for the well known `` second parameter '' dilemma @xcite .",
    "however , this unconventional approach still suffers from a somewhat arbitrary fine - tuning of the key physical assumptions .    _",
    "( ii ) _ hot hb stars might , nonetheless , also be naturally predicted among super metal - rich stellar models , as far as metal abundance ( and the linked helium content ) exceeds some critical threshold .",
    "presumably , in this case mass - loss allows stars to reach the hb phase with a conveniently low external envelope , compared to the helium core mass @xcite .",
    "such `` extreme hb '' stars ( ehb ) have actually been observed , for example , in @xmath11  cen @xcite , ngc  6388 and ngc  6441 @xcite , and in some old galactic open clusters as well , like ngc  6791 @xcite ; they clearly remain the favorite candidates to explain the evolutionary framework of uv - enhanced elliptical galaxies @xcite .",
    "this hypothesis implies , however , a direct relationship between chemical abundance ( modulating the helium core mass at the hb onset ) and mass - loss efficiency ( to suitably `` peel off '' the stellar envelope along the rgb ) . as a consequence",
    ", one has to expect the uv - to - optical color to be , eventually , one of the most quickly evolving features in the sed of elliptical galaxies @xcite . in theory ,",
    "the uv - upturn can fade by several magnitudes as the lookback time increases by a few gyr , although the effect is still detectable at intermediate redshift ( @xmath12 ) @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , the evolutionary details are extremely model - dependent , and a strong uv excess could be triggered at ages as early as @xmath13 gyr @xcite or as late as @xmath1415 gyr @xcite .    _ ( iii ) _ an established correlation seems to be in place between pn luminosity - specific rate and @xmath15 color for elliptical galaxies in the virgo and fornax clusters , and in the leo group @xcite .",
    "the sense is that reddest metal - rich systems display , at the same time , a stronger uv - upturn @xcite _ and _ a poorer pn population per unit galaxy luminosity @xcite .",
    "if the pn event is the final fate for agb stars at the end of their thermal pulsing phase @xcite , then the relative deficiency of nebulae might be evidence of an incomplete ( or fully inhibited ) agb evolution of low - mass stars under special environment conditions of the parent galaxy .    as a central issue in this discussion , _ it is clear therefore that a preeminent connection should exist between uv excess and agb distinctive properties of stellar populations in early - type galaxies . _    on account of the fuel consumption theorem @xcite , a 1  m@xmath2 star of solar metallicity enters its core he - burning phase with , at most , the equivalent of 0.43  m@xmath2 of h to be spent as nuclear fuel .",
    "star with solar abundance @xmath16 starts its hb evolution with a total he amount of roughly @xmath17  m@xmath2 , of which @xmath18  m@xmath2 are confined in the core @xcite and @xmath19  m@xmath2 reside in the envelope .",
    "metals amount to roughly @xmath20m@xmath2 and , accordingly , fresh h is 0.37  m@xmath2 .",
    "taking into account the nuclear rates ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the h+he fuel provides at most the equivalent of @xmath21  m@xmath2 of hydrogen . ]",
    "this means that , under quite general conditions , post - rgb evolution alone could easily account , in principle , for up to 3/4 of the total bolometric luminosity of a galaxy stellar population @xcite . whether this energy is eventually reduced ( if stars loose their fuel before they burn it ) , or whether it is finally released in the form of ultraviolet or infrared photons , crucially depends on mass - loss and its impact along the entire red - giant evolution .",
    "hence , it is of special pertinence to constrain the relevant physical conditions that affect agb evolution in favor of an earlier transition of hb stars towards high temperature and enhanced ultraviolet emission .    in this paper",
    "we would like to draw the reader s attention to a possibly new and powerful approach to the problem , that can find straightforward applications even to distant galaxies .",
    "as explained in sec .  2 , the method relies on surface - brightness fluctuation theory to safely tie infrared effective magnitudes ( that _ can _ be determined for unresolved stellar populations ) , to stellar luminosity at the agb tip ( that _ can not _ be directly observed in distant galaxies )",
    ". we will show , in sec .  3 , that these results tightly correlate with the ultraviolet properties of `` uv upturn '' elliptical galaxies , allowing a self - consistent physical picture and a quite accurate diagnostic of the post - rgb evolution of their underlying stellar populations , including hb morphology and agb deployment .",
    "our results will be finally summarized and discussed in sec .",
    "@xcite and @xcite first realized the potentially useful information about the composing stars hidden in the surface brightness fluctuations ( sbfs ) of galaxies with unresolved stellar populations .",
    "the problem has since received a more complete theoretical assessment by @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "briefly , the basic relationship upon which the theory relies is @xmath22 the l.h .",
    "side of the equation links an observable quantity ( namely , the relative variance of the galaxy surface brightness ) with the theoretical second - order statistical moment of the composing stars .",
    "this quantity , in turn , traces the distribution of stellar luminosity ( @xmath23 ) for the whole population ; it is also a natural output of any population synthesis code , and can easily be computed for different photometric bands and distinctive evolutionary phases of simple stellar populations ( ssps ; see , e.g. , the current theoretical databases of * ? ? ?",

    "( [ eq : eta ] ) , we can approximate with @xmath73    if we entirely ascribe the dimming in red - giant tip luminosity suggested by fig .",
    "6 to a mass - loss effect , then eq .  ( [ eq : eta ] ) implies a spread @xmath74 among the galaxy population , with uv - enhanced ellipticals requiring a reimers parameter @xmath48 - 0.4 , very similar to what @xcite derived , empirically , for the galactic globular clusters . according to fig .  5",
    ", this confirms that , overall , the agb is deployed in luminosity slightly above the rgb tip , so that the brightest stars in ellipticals should indeed always be genuine agb stars .",
    "[ fig201 ]     [ fig200 ]    there is an obvious caveat , though , in this simplified picture .",
    "if a standard monolithic scenario is assumed for early - type galaxy formation , then gravitational collapse of the primeval gas clouds should have proceeded over a free - fall timescale @xmath75 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , leading to a mass  age ",
    "metallicity relation for early - type galaxies , where more massive galaxies are both older and more metal - rich than less massive ones ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the combined action of age and metallicity plays an important role to modulate the red - giant luminosity tip , as the agb is `` naturally '' brighter among young or metal - rich ssps ( see , again , fig .",
    "the complex interplay of the different galaxy physical properties is well depicted in figs .  7 and 8 .",
    "for one , as @xcite had already shown , the uv upturn seems to appear among the most massive and metal rich ellipticals ( i.e. , there is a positive correlation with @xmath76 and the mg@xmath67 index , respectively ) .",
    "figure  7 indicates for these galaxies also a less extended agb , as for a lower stellar core - mass distribution .",
    "this feature is likewise expected to directly affect the pn rate per unit galaxy luminosity ( the so - called `` @xmath77 '' index , see fig .",
    "8) ; indeed , there is a scantier pn stellar population among old / metal - rich ( uv - enhanced ) ellipticals @xcite .",
    "[ hbeta ]      observations of local star samples show that the h@xmath4 index reaches its maximum strength for a - type stars in the temperature range t@xmath78  k @xcite . given this selected sensitivity , synthesis models of old ssps @xcite predict the integrated index to be strongly enhanced ( by roughly 0.8    or more ) in the presence of a broad color - extended hb , as observed for most metal - poor galactic globular clusters",
    ". this important piece of information could therefore usefully complement the more extreme @xmath66 color in the analysis of hb morphology for unresolved stellar populations in distant galaxies .",
    "the situation is summarized in fig .  9 , where elliptical galaxy data are compared with three illustrative cases of 15 gyr ssps with slightly supersolar metallicity ( [ fe / h]=+0.3 ) , and different ranges of hb temperature distribution .",
    "in particular , in the figure we account for _ ( i ) _ a red hb ( rhb ) morphology , that is , a clump of red stars very close to the rgb location , mimicking the real case of metal - rich galactic globular clusters , like 47 tuc ; _ ( ii ) _ an intermediate hb ( ihb ) morphology , with a broad ( roughly bell - shaped ) temperature distribution peaked about the a - stars temperature range and extending up to @xmath79  k ; _ ( iii ) _ a blue hb ( bhb ) morphology , peaked at @xmath80  k and with a tail of hot sdb stars , up to a temperature of @xmath81  k ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* , for further details ) .",
    "interestingly enough , the comparison with the observations shows that `` uv - upturn '' ellipticals _ can not _ be compatible with any bhb morphology alone .",
    "too many hot stars would make the 1550    galaxy luminosity exceedingly bright compared to the energy bulk released at the @xmath71 band . on the other hand , neither an ihb is viable , given the catastrophic impact of its a - star component on the integrated @xmath82 index of the population ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "definitely , an optimum match to these systems requires a mixed contribution , where the bulk of the galaxy luminosity ( over 80% ) is provided by `` standard '' ( metal - rich ) stellar populations with a red hb , upon which a 20% , or less , in terms of total optical contribution , bhb component is superposed .",
    "figure 10 provides an illustrative picture of this case , showing the synthetic c - m diagram and the integrated sed for the composite stellar population corresponding to the big triangle in fig .",
    "[ cmdhb ]    so , in full agreement with @xcite conclusions , a somewhat dichotomic scenario seems to emerge for giant ellipticals , where the occurrence of the `` uv - upturn '' phenomenon is intimately related to the appearence , among the galaxy hb population , of a hot and very low - mass stellar component ( m@xmath8  m@xmath2 , e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , that at some stage begins to join the standard red - clump stars .",
    "it could be useful to note , in this regard , that two metallicity ranges seem to favor the formation of ehb stars , through an optimum combination of msto stellar masses and subsequent mass - loss via stellar winds along the rgb . as displayed in fig .",
    "11 , [ fe / h ] values of either @xmath6  dex or @xmath7 provide in principle the needed low mass at the onset of hb evolution in a standard reimers mass - loss framework with @xmath83 .    to add even further to this challenging situation , however , one also has to report that high - resolution uv spectroscopy of a sample of six uv - strong ellipticals ( namely , ngc 1399 , 3115 , 3379 , 4472 , 4552 , and 4649 ) indicates for the claimed bhb component a moderately sub - solar ( @xmath84 ) metallicity @xcite . if confirmed , this result might lead to identify the _ metal - poor _ stellar component of giant ellipticals as the one responsible for the uv excess .",
    "whatever the exact mechanism , this will cause hb morphology to readily assume a bimodal distribution , with a relative lack of warm stars at the intermedate @xmath85 range pertinent to the a spectral type ( see fig .",
    "in this paper we have carried out a synoptic analysis of the different observational features that have to do with the uv luminosity excess in elliptical galaxies . as far as the canonical picture is assumed , with old stellar populations dominating early - type galaxy luminosity , the appearence of the `` uv upturn ''",
    "should readily call for a profound change in the c - m diagram of galaxy stellar populations , not only involving the hot stellar component of the galaxy but also reverberating on red - giant evolution at the low - temperature regime . as we mainly deal with distant , unresolved stellar populations ,",
    "our analysis has to rely on a combined approach , matching infrared and ultraviolet diagnostic tools in order to probe the main features of the stellar c - m diagram , starting with integrated galaxy photometry .",
    "theory of surface - brightness fluctuations provides , in this sense , a natural and quite powerful way to go deep inside the problem and , as far as the infrared wavelength interval is considered , we have demonstrated theoretically that a straight and very clean relationship is in place between a macroscopic measure , such as the galaxy fluctuation magnitude , and the corresponding individual magnitude of the brightest stars in turn at the tip of the red - giant ( agb+rgb ) phases ( fig .  2 ) .",
    "played in the @xmath28 band , this correlation leads , from a measurement of @xmath0 , to a value for @xmath34 : @xmath86 with a @xmath87  mag internal uncertainty . as we showed in sec .  2 ,",
    "our ssp theoretical predictions find full support from the observations , and a direct check on the mc star clusters confirms the @xmath0 vs.  @xmath34 relationship to be a much more general and deeply intrinsic property of stellar populations , virtually independent from any assumption about age , metallicity , imf , and mass loss parameters .",
    "given its nature , this relationship can not , by itself , help disentangle the problem of age / metallicity degeneracy ; however , quite fruitfully , it provides us with a very direct probe of agb properties , in a number of relevant details that directly deal with the mass - loss impact and the mass of dying stars ( fig .",
    "our effort toward exploring the infrared side of galaxy seds has a twofold aim since , as a consequence of the basic principle of energy conservation , any gram of stellar fuel spent to feed ultraviolet luminosity can not ( and will not ) be spent at longer wavelengths .",
    "this has led to the key issue of this paper , summarized in fig .",
    "6 , that the _ strengthening of the uv rising branch is always seen to correspond to a weakening in the agb luminosity extension _ , as traced by galaxy @xmath28 fluctuation magnitude .",
    "this `` shortening '' in agb deployment is mainly recognized among giant ellipticals ( @xmath0 becomes fainter with increasing galaxy velocity dispersion , @xmath76 , see fig .",
    "7 ) , and could mainly be ascribed to an age effect , as the agb tip naturally fades in luminosity with increasing age of the system ( fig .",
    "3 ) , and high - mass galaxies are recognized to be older than systems of lower mass ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "however , the relationship in place likely calls for a more elaborated physical scenario , once the full range of observing evidences is added to our analysis .     vs.  lick mg@xmath67 index , for the galaxy sample in table  [ tab_tot ] .",
    "the lick index is assumed to trace galaxy metallicity according to the @xcite calibration , as reported on the top axis of the plot . the observed decrease in @xmath34 with increasing @xmath88",
    "$ ] can be mostly explained if more metal - rich galaxies are also older , as in a standard monolythic scenario for galaxy formation . the dashed line on the plot marks the minimum luminosity required for stars to experience the thermal pulsing phase along their agb evolution , and thus end their evolution as pne .",
    "]    _ ( a ) _ besides being old , `` uv upturn '' galaxies are also metal rich ( i.e. , stronger in mg@xmath67 lick index ) . disregarding any change in mass - loss rate , stellar tracks predict slightly more massive stars to evolve off the ms at a fixed age , with increasing metallicity ( e.g. , *",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "this leads to correspondingly more massive agb stars and a brighter agb luminosity .",
    "facing the observed trend in galaxy distribution , as summarized in fig .",
    "12 , metallicity effects evidently enter by mitigating the dimming action of age on @xmath34 with increasing galaxy mass . in any case",
    ", the interplay between age and metal abundance actually makes the derived range for the reimers mass - loss parameter ( i.e.  @xmath74 , as discussed in sec .",
    "3 ) a safe upper limit . in fact , it suggests that metal abundance does _ not _ modulate by orders of magnitude mass - loss efficiency via stellar winds ..",
    "conversely , also from data of single stars , @xcite argues that @xmath89 is metallicity - independent . from a theoretical point of view , @xcite models suggest that , if mass - loss is really proportional to metallicity , its effect to dim near - ir effective luminosities on average almost exactly offsets the brightening effect of metallicity itself . ]",
    "_ ( b ) _ a match of galaxy @xmath0 data with the calibration of fig .",
    "5 confirms that , all the way , brightest stars in ellipticals are genuine agb members , reaching the thermal - pulsing phase ( see also fig .  12 ) , and with the agb tip exceeding the rgb tip by some 0.5 - 1.5  mag .",
    "in the temperature range of m giant stars , a major fraction of bolometric luminosity is emitted through the @xmath28 band , and bolometric correction is a nearly constant quantity that we can estimate from @xmath90  mag @xcite ; we can therefore straightforwardly translate the galaxy fluctuation magnitude into an estimate of the bolometric tip luminosity , @xmath91 , and therefrom of the corresponding stellar core mass . from our previous calibration ( eq .  [ eq : calib ] ) , we can write then @xmath92\\ ] ] ( where the sun has magnitude m@xmath93 ) . following @xcite , from the assumed core mass - luminosity relation for the solar metallicity range , this leads to @xmath94 .",
    "\\label{mctip}\\ ] ] figure  13 reports the inferred core - mass distribution , at the pn onset , for our galaxy sample .",
    "note that this is the _ maximum _ actual mass allowed to luminous stars in each galaxy environment , and demonstrates that the _ mass of dying stars tends to decrease with increasing uv - upturn strength _ , being in general @xmath95  m@xmath2 among giant ellipticals . for this mass range ,",
    "pn lifetime is the largest possible , but the timescale for the nebula to be visible is critically constrained by the transition time ( @xmath96 ) needed by the post - agb stellar core to be hot enough to `` fire up '' the ejected envelope and become a hard uv emitter @xcite .",
    "the evident drop of @xmath77 among strong uv - upturn galaxies ( fig .",
    "8) might be a direct consequence , therefore , of an increasing blocking effect of @xmath96 along the inferred @xmath97 range ( i.e. , the stellar core takes longer to heat - up than the shell to evaporate ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , to which one has to further add a size cut in the overall pn population , as a result of the ehb progenitors ( m@xmath98  m@xmath2 ) evolving as _ agb - manqu _ stars and therefore skipping the nebula event .    _",
    "( c ) _ we remarked , in sec .",
    "3 , the importance of the integrated @xmath82 index as a fairly selective tracer of the warm ( t@xmath99  k ) stellar component in the galaxy stellar population .",
    "a proper assessment of the photometric contribution from this range of temperatures is of paramount importance in the framework of early - type galaxy evolution , in order to single out any signature of recent ( i.e. , in the last few gyr or so ) star formation or , conversely , of intervening evolution of the hb morphology among old ssps , as in a more standard canonical scenario .    as far as uv - upturn galaxies are concerned",
    ", the study of @xmath82 distribution clearly points to _ a substantial lack of a - type stars _ in the galaxy mix ( see fig .",
    "while , on one hand , this definitely secures the `` quiescent '' nature of these galaxies , it also poses , on the other hand , a stringent constraint on hb morphology in their old - age context .",
    "in fact , a bimodal temperature distribution is required for the hb to assure , at a time , both an enhanced uv emission _ and _ a conveniently low @xmath82 feature .",
    "thus , in these systems the expected prevailing bulk of red hb stars should be accompanied , at some point , by a residual population of blue ( metal - poor ? ) hb objects ( coincident with ehb stars in the current empirical classification scheme ) , peaked at about 20000 - 40000  k , in a proportion of , roughly , @xmath100 $ ] .    on the other hand , to complete the picture , one can not neglect the masking effects of age distribution , facing a recognized evidence for low - mass ellipticals to display a more silent but also more continuous star formation along their entire galaxy life , that naturally feeds the a - star contribution , thanks to the bluer ms turn - off point ( msto ) exhibited by ssps in the @xmath101  gyr age range , and leads to a younger  average \" age , compared to high - mass systems .",
    "this is what we observe , for instance , among the resolved stellar populations of the local group dwarf spheroidals @xcite ( see , in this regard , the illustrative location of m32 in fig .  9 , and also consider the discussion by * ? ?",
    "( d ) _ along with our discussion of the @xmath0 vs.  @xmath66 relation , we noticed , in fig .",
    "6 , the presence of a few outliers about 0.7  mag brighter at infrared magnitudes , or alternatively @xmath102  mag `` bluer '' in the @xmath66 color , than the main galaxy population . in order to further investigate this issue",
    ", we tracked the relevant objects also in other figures , whenever possible .    if galaxy mass ( _ alias _",
    "@xmath103 ) is considered as the leading physical parameter to compare outlier location with respect to the bulk of the galaxy distribution ( see , for instance fig .",
    "7 ) , one must conclude that both ngc  4552 and ngc  1389 seem to have a brighter agb tip rather than a bluer @xmath66 color . with regard to ngc  1389 ,",
    "@xcite find that the @xmath104 sbfs of ngc  1389 are also too bright compared to its ( @xmath105 ) color , a fact that would be consistent with either a higher than average metallicity given the age of its most recent burst of star formation or a longer lifetime of its tp - agb stars @xcite . in the case of ngc  4552 , however , @xcite contribute an interesting piece of information .",
    "these authors measure near - ir sbfs for several galaxies in virgo , and their results are systematically fainter than those obtained by @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , the two groups use slightly different filters ( jensen et al .",

    "<S> relying on infrared surface brightness fluctuactions to trace agb properties in a sample of elliptical galaxies in the virgo and fornax clusters , we assess the puzzling origin of the `` uv - upturn '' phenomenon , recently traced down to the presence of a hot horizontal branch ( hb ) stellar component . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the uv - upturn actually signals a profound change in the c - m diagram of stellar populations in elliptical galaxies , involving both the hot stellar component and red - giant evolution . </S>",
    "<S> first , we encounter that the strengthening of the uv rising branch is always seen to correspond to a shortening in agb deployment ; this trend can be readily interpreted as an age effect , perhaps mildly modulated by metal abundance .    </S>",
    "<S> a comparison between galaxy @xmath0 magnitudes and population synthesis models confirms that , all the way , brightest stars in ellipticals are genuine agb members , reaching the thermal - pulsing phase , and with the agb tip exceeding the rgb tip by some 0.5 - 1.5  mag . the inferred core mass of these stars is found to be @xmath1  m@xmath2 among giant ellipticals . </S>",
    "<S> coupled with the recognized severe deficiency of planetary nebulae in these galaxies , this result strongly calls for an even more critical blocking effect due to a lengthy transition time needed by the post - agb stellar core to become a hard uv emitter and eventually `` fire up '' the nebula .    the combined study of galaxy @xmath3 color and integrated h@xmath4 index points , as an explanation for the uv - upturn phenomenon , to a composite hb with a bimodal temperature distribution , i.e.  with both a red clump and an extremely blue component , in a relative proportion of roughly [ n(rhb):n(bhb ) ]  @xmath5  [ 80:20 ] . as far as metallicity of the bhb stellar population </S>",
    "<S> is concerned , we find that [ fe / h ] values of either @xmath6  dex or @xmath7 may provide the optimum ranges to feed the needed low - mass stars ( m@xmath8  m@xmath2 ) , that at some stage begin to join the standard red - clump stars . </S>"
