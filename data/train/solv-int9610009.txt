    "random tiling models are ensembles of coverings of the plane , without gaps or overlaps , with a set of rigid building blocks or tiles .",
    "the most well - known application of such a model is perhaps the anti - ferromagnetic ising model on the triangular lattice,@xcite of which the ground state configurations are described by rhombus coverings of the plane .",
    "the discovery of quasi - crystals@xcite revived the modeling of structures by tiling models.@xcite quasi - crystals are solid metallic alloys without periodicity but with long range order ( i.e. they have sharp diffraction peaks ) .",
    "two competing scenarios have been put forward to explain the origins of such quasiperiodic ordering .",
    "one of them assumes a microscopic hamiltonian of which the ground state configuration is quasi - periodic .",
    "this would be something akin to the local matching rules used by penrose .",
    "these deterministic tilings are perfectly quasiperiodic in the sense that their diffraction peaks have zero width . as an alternative",
    "there is the random tiling picture , in which one abandons the strict quasiperiodic long range order .",
    "these models do have matching rules in the sense that tiles may neither overlap nor have gaps between them , but these are not strong enough to enforce a unique behavior at large distances .",
    "this then gives rise to an ensemble of different tilings , or atom packings , inside a fixed volume .",
    "assuming that all these configurations are ( nearly ) degenerate in energy such an ensemble has a nonzero entropy density .",
    "this entropy can reduce the free energy and lower it w.r.t the crystalline phase , which is supposed to be stable at zero temperature .",
    "this phenomenon thus provides a simple explanation of the stability of the quasi - crystalline phase .",
    "of special interest in two dimensional random tiling models are those that fulfill the following constraints : ( i ) each kind of tile has a unique atomic decoration , ( ii ) each member of the random tiling ensemble is an allowed packing of atoms and ( iii ) each arrangement of atoms forming an equally good packing belongs to the tiling ensemble .",
    "these tiling models are called physical or atomistic .",
    "examples of these are the binary tenfold rhombus@xcite and the twelve - fold square - triangle@xcite random tiling models .",
    "recently cockayne introduced a physical random tiling model with an eight - fold symmetric phase which he doped the octagonal analogue of the square - triangle tiling , despite of some distinctive characteristics.@xcite in this paper we show that the comparison certainly holds concerning the exact solvability of the random tiling model .",
    "we mean by this that , like for the square - triangle tiling,@xcite it is possible to calculate the entropy exactly in part of the phase diagram .",
    "we obtain closed expressions for the residual entropy as well as for the phason elastic constants.@xcite the main results of this paper have already been published elsewhere,@xcite here we present the full calculation .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section [ se : tmat ] we present the tiling model and give a transfer matrix description to be able to enumerate all possible tilings . in section [",
    "se : phas ] we give a brief review of phason strain concepts .",
    "the results of this section will be used to identify our results and to obtain expressions for the phason elastic constants .",
    "section [ se : ba ] describes the diagonalization of the transfer matrix by bethe ansatz .",
    "the resulting nonlinear coupled equations are solved in section [ se : thermlim ] .",
    "finally we calculate the entropy density from this solution in section [ se : entropy ] .",
    "the model that cockayne described is a tiling of the plane by squares and various hexagons . by placing discs of radius @xmath0 on each of the vertices ,",
    "one obtains a physical packing .",
    "the hexagons can be thought of as being built out of two isosceles triangles and several rectangles depending on the length of the hexagon .",
    "the rectangles have sides 1 and @xmath1 .",
    "likewise , by drawing one of the two diagonals , the squares can be viewed as two triangles .",
    "the square - hexagon tiling thus is equivalent to the ensemble of vertex configurations of the rectangle - triangle tiling .",
    "the latter ensemble in turn is equivalent to the rectangle - triangle random tiling ensemble ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : tflayerdecompo ] ) provided that the two ways of forming a square out of two triangles are counted as one.@xcite    like for the square - triangle tiling we make use of the transfer matrix to calculate thermodynamic quantities like the entropy .",
    "the transfer matrix * t * is introduced by decomposing the tiling into layers .",
    "different layers are bounded by the short horizontal edges , the horizontal diagonals of the squares and the almost horizontal diagonals of the @xmath2 tilted rectangles . here",
    ", @xmath3 refers to the tilt of the short edge of the rectangle w.r.t the horizontal axis .",
    "in addition , the layer boundaries cut the triangles and rectangles with a vertical long edge in half .",
    "the horizontal diagonals of the squares are denoted by the dashed lines in fig .",
    "[ fig : tflayerdecompo ] . in a similar fashion",
    "the tiling can be decomposed in ` columns ' .",
    "different columns are separated by the short + edge , the vertical short edge and the almost vertical diagonal of the @xmath4 tilted rectangle .",
    "the rectangles with a vertical long edge are cut by a column edge from the lower left to the upper right corner . in this way",
    "the tiles are deformed in such a way that the vertices of the tiling form a subset of those of the square lattice , see fig .",
    "[ fig : tflattice ] .",
    "+ on this regular lattice the definition of the transfer matrix * t * is obvious : a matrix element @xmath5 is 0 if layer @xmath6 can not be followed by layer @xmath7 .",
    "otherwise it is given by the statistical weight of layer @xmath7 .",
    "in this paper we shall adopt the convention that @xmath8 acts in the downward direction .    in the following",
    "we will call the tilted rectangles @xmath9 and the rectangles with the short and long horizontal edge by @xmath10 and @xmath11 respectively .",
    "because different tiles of the original tiling are mapped onto the same shapes on the square lattice , we have to decorate the new configurations .",
    "this is done with bold dashed and solid lines , see fig .",
    "[ fig : tflattice ] .",
    "thus it is apparent that the horizontal short and long edges of the original tiling form domain walls between regions of @xmath12 , which we denote by type s and l respectively .",
    "if we think of the vertical coordinate as a time coordinate ( increasing in the downward direction ) , the transfer matrix can be seen as an evolution operator for these domain walls .",
    "the transfer matrix * t * is block diagonal with sectors parameterized by the numbers of domain walls , which are conserved under the action of * t*.     + between two layer edges on the square lattice , the s - walls step one unit to the right and the l - walls do not move",
    ". when two walls cross , the s - wall may either jump over the l - wall moving two places to the right and thereby creating a rectangle @xmath11 , or , over _ two _ layers , the walls may exchange place creating a rectangle @xmath13 . in the latter case",
    "the crossing therefore is completed after application of the transfer matrix twice .",
    "it may also happen that two walls of type s and one of type l cross simultaneously over two layers .",
    "the l - wall and the s - wall nearest to it then exchange place , while the second s - wall jumps over both these walls moving three places to the right creating a rectangle @xmath14 .",
    "we can express the tile densities in terms of the domain wall densities .",
    "we shall denote the horizontal size of the tiling by @xmath15 and the corresponding system size of the lattice model by @xmath16 .",
    "let @xmath17 , i.e. both types of collisions of two domain walls occur with the same frequency , and let @xmath18 and @xmath19 be the number of s- and l - walls .",
    "apply the transfer matrix @xmath20 times on some initial configuration of domain walls at @xmath21 on the lattice , and suppose that both types of collisions occur for every _ pair _ of s- and l - walls .",
    "the final state at @xmath22 will then be the same configuration of domain walls as the initial one shifted by @xmath23 .",
    "counting the total number of tiles in this patch generated by * t * , we find the following relations between the wall densities and the rectangle densities per layer : @xmath24 similar expressions can be obtained for the different triangle densities . the total number of rectangles and of triangles per layer can then be calculated to be : @xmath25 the tile densities that belong to the quasi - crystalline phase are @xmath26 , corresponding to an area fraction of triangles @xmath27 . as a function of the domain wall densities , the model displays two incommensurate phases .",
    "a four - fold symmetric phase is formed in the high density region , @xmath28 , where the triangles form octagonal and square cells bounded by domain walls consisting of rectangles .",
    "there is a two - fold symmetric phase in the low density region where the rectangles from rectangular cells bounded by the domain walls consisting of triangles .",
    "as already mentioned above , the quantities @xmath29 and @xmath19 are conserved by the action of the transfer matrix * t*. to control the average value of @xmath30 , the tiles @xmath10 and @xmath11 are given a weight @xmath31 and @xmath32 respectively .",
    "furthermore , as the tiles @xmath10 and @xmath14 in the lattice representation have an area that is twice that of the other two transformed rectangles , we have to introduce a chemical potential for them to compensate for this asymmetry .",
    "the tiles @xmath10 and @xmath14 therefore get an extra weight @xmath33 .",
    "the free energy per layer of the lattice model is given by the logarithm of the largest eigenvalue of @xmath8 : @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the entropy per site of the lattice model . in section",
    "[ se : ba ] will be shown that we can actually diagonalize @xmath8 using coordinate bethe ansatz .",
    "in this section we will briefly review some of the phason strain concepts .",
    "details can be found in a review on random tiling concepts by henley.@xcite .",
    "the position of every vertex in the tiling is of the form : @xmath36 the tiling can therefore naturally be embedded in a four - dimensional hyper - cubic lattice using @xmath37 the vectors @xmath38 are chosen such that @xmath39 are orthogonal . the continuous height field , or representative surface",
    ", @xmath40 is as horizontal as possible for a perfect quasi - crystalline tiling .",
    "a generic member of the random tiling ensemble thus is described by fluctuations around this flat surface . by integrating out the short - wavelength fluctuations one gets a smoothed function @xmath41 , the phason field , that varies on length scales much larger than the tile edge length .",
