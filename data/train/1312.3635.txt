    "microstate geometries play a double role in the study of solutions in supergravity .",
    "first , microstate geometries involve a mechanism that supports time - independent , smooth , solitonic , horizonless solutions within massless supergravity theories and so such solutions can potentially represent completely new classes of end - states for stars .",
    "the second role is that there are vast classes of such solutions and these classes come with extremely large moduli spaces . as a result",
    ", the fluctuations of microstate geometries can capture a significant portion of the microstate structure of the black hole that possesses the same asymptotic structure at infinity . to understand the extent to which such classical solutions can capture microstate details it is important to understand and classify the moduli spaces of solutions and find all the ways in which such solutions can fluctuate .",
    "this has been the focus of much recent work and in this paper we will exhibit a new and broader class of bps fluctuations that we call _ species oscillation_.    the key building block of solutions with species oscillations is a new object of string theory , which we will call the _ magnetube_. the magnetube has m5 and momentum charges ( which are magnetic in five dimensions ) , as well as several electric m2 charge densities that can oscillate between positive and negative values along the m5-p common direction .",
    "the original motivation for studying this object , and species oscillation in general , was the idea that it can be used to create microstate geometries for schwarzschild ( electrically neutral ) black holes @xcite .",
    "the specific magnetube considered in @xcite involved a kk - monopole with ( ns5 , d5 ) charge specified by a vector at each point along a line in the kkm worldvolume .",
    "this charge vector rotates in the ( ns5 , d5 ) charge space as one goes around this line so that the resulting configuration has no overall ( ns5 , d5 ) charge . at each point on the line",
    "the configuration looks like a piece of a bps supertube , but at different locations the d5 charge of this object can have opposite signs , and so it does not preserve any supersymmetry associated with these charges .",
    "our first result is to show that the object found in @xcite , as well as the class of m5-p magnetubes that we construct in this paper , are secretly supersymmetric .",
    "normally one does not expect this , because the negative and positive m2 ( or d5 ) charge densities at two different locations will attract and will generically want to collapse into each other . however , the story is much richer : because of the presence of extra species one can arrange the m2-brane densities so that , at each point along the direction in which the charge densities vary , the killing spinors are those of the ( magnetic ) m5 branes and momentum , and are not affected at all by the presence of ( electric ) m2 branes . hence , the physics of the magnetube is the mirror of the physics of normal supertubes @xcite : for the magnetube the magnetic ( m5 and p ) charges control the supersymmetry , and the contributions of the fluctuating electric charges to the killing spinor equations cancel ; for normal supertubes the ( electric ) m2 branes control the supersymmetry and the ( magnetic ) m5 and momentum charges can fluctuate arbitrarily , as their contribution to the killing spinor equations cancel each other .",
    "the original spirit of @xcite was to try to bend the infinite magnetube with oscillating species ( whose solution they constructed ) into a round magnetube , which would be neutral and hence give microstate geometries for the schwarzschild black hole .",
    "it is clear that this would break the supersymmetry of the infinite magnetube , as the resulting configuration will have mass and no charge .",
    "however there is also an indirect and more useful way to see how supersymmetry is broken : bending an infinite tube in @xmath6 into a round one in @xmath7 can be realized by adding a taub - nut center to the solution and bringing this center close to the tube ( in the vicinity of the taub - nut center the metric is @xmath7 ) . for normal supertubes",
    "this procedure is supersymmetric @xcite , because the killing spinors of the taub - nut space are compatible with the m2-brane killing spinors of the supertube .",
    "however , the magnetube has m5 and p killing spinors , and those are not compatible with the taub - nut ones , and hence trying to create a neutral configuration results necessarily in the breaking of the supersymmetry preserved by the infinite magnetube solution .",
    "our second result is to find a way to embed m5-p magnetubes into some of the known supersymmetric solutions and to obtain new classes of bps solutions with species oscillation .",
    "using magnetubes and species oscillation to create more bps solutions may appear contrary to the original spirit of @xcite , which proposed these objects as building blocks for non - extremal microstate geometries .",
    "however , this is not so : our result strengthens the evidence for the existence of magnetubes , and proves that there is no obstruction to bending them , and hence to using them in principle for the purpose originally intended in @xcite .",
    "embedding a magnetube into a supersymmetric solution that has m2 killing spinors may , at first , seem impossible because the magnetic killing spinors of the magnetube are not compatible with the electric m2 killing spinors preserved by the background . specifically , given a killing spinor , @xmath8",
    ", one can define the vector @xmath9 and this is always a killing vector that represents the `` time''-translation generated by the anti - commutator of two supersymmetries . in electric bps solutions",
    "this killing vector is time - like and in magnetic bps solutions this killing vector is null : we therefore use the terminology `` time - like '' or `` null '' supersymmetry to refer to these two distinct and apparently incompatible classes .",
    "one can also verify that the supersymmetry projectors associated with the underlying magnetic and electric charges are also incompatible because the projectors do not commute with one another .    on the other hand , when lifted to six dimensions all supersymmetric solutions give rise to null killing isometries and so , from this perspective , there should be some possibility of interpolation between such supersymmetries . indeed , even in five dimensions there is a crucial loop - hole in the structure of the electric bps supersymmetries :",
    "the four - dimensional spatial bases are allowed to be ambi - polar , which implies that while the killing vector associated with the supersymmetry is time - like almost everywhere ( and particularly at infinity ) , there are _ critical surfaces _",
    ", where the signature of the base space changes from @xmath10 to @xmath11 , and where the killing vector becomes null .",
    "we will show that the usual time - like supersymmetries of electric charges actually get infinitely boosted and become magnetic or `` null '' supersymmetries on the critical surfaces .",
    "it is therefore possible to introduce species oscillation on magnetubes localized right on top of a critical surface , where the killing spinors of the background become magnetic and are therefore compatible to those of the magnetubes , preserving supersymmetry globally .    besides establishing the existence of magnetubes as fundamental building blocks of black hole microstates ,",
    "the new families of supersymmetric solutions that we construct are interesting in their own right .",
    "for example , in four dimensions the uniqueness theorems are very stringent but in five and six dimensions there are huge families of microstate geometries with the same asymptotic charges .",
    "it is thus interesting to explore the range of possibilities and our new classes of solution will have electric fields that fluctuate and yet the metric either does not fluctuate at all , or the fluctuation response is locally suppressed due to coherent combinations of fluctuating charge densities .",
    "this class of solutions is , in this sense , similar to @xmath12-balls @xcite .",
    "the latter solutions are supported by time - dependent matter fluctuations arranged so that the energy - momentum tensor and hence the metric are both time - independent .",
    "the solutions we construct here are not time - dependent but the fields fluctuate as a function of some @xmath13-coordinate , @xmath14 , and yet the energy - momentum tensor and metric can be arranged to remain invariant along @xmath14 .",
    "more generally , one can arrange the fields to fluctuate in such a way that the leading - order perturbations to the energy - momentum tensor near the source remain @xmath14-independent with the fluctuations only becoming visible at sub - leading orders .",
    "we will formulate species oscillation in five - dimensions using a @xmath15 compactification of m - theory that is essentially described in @xcite .",
    "there will be one spectator m2 brane wrapping a fixed @xmath16 and the species oscillation will take place between four classes of m2-branes that wrap the remaining @xmath17 in different ways .",
    "one can also reduce this to iia by compactifying on an @xmath13 inside the @xmath16 of the spectator m2 , converting it to an f1 string while the oscillating m2 s become oscillating d2 s .",
    "if one t - dualizes on the circle wrapped by the f1 , one obtains a iib compactification in which the f1 has become momentum charge and the oscillating species are simply three sets of d3-branes that intersect along a common circle while wrapping the @xmath17 in exactly the same manner as the original m2 s .",
    "the importance of the iib frame is that it is only in this frame that our solutions will be completely smooth microstate geometries .",
    "our formulation also has the advantage of having all the oscillating species originating from the same type of branes .",
    "it is also possible to relate some of our magnetube solutions to the smooth iib frame magnetubes obtained in @xcite , by a duality sequence that we will discuss in section [ sect : ten ] .    in section [",
    "sect : susytypes ] we discuss the two classes , time - like and null , of supersymmetry and their relation to electric and magnetic bps solutions in m - theory .",
    "we also show how both types of supersymmetry can be present in bps solutions with ambi - polar base metrics . in section [",
    "sect : addvms ] we discuss the relevant five - dimensional @xmath18 supergravity theories and their origins in m - theory . in section [",
    "sect : sixdim ] we discuss the six - dimensional uplifts and their relation to iib supergravity .",
    "we also discuss the regularity conditions that make supertubes into smooth microstate geometries in six dimensions .",
    "section [ sect : temp ] contains a `` template '' microstate geometry which is a standard , non - oscillating microstate geometry with two gibbons - hawking ( gh ) geometric charges and a `` supertube '' on the critical surface between the gh charges . in reality",
    "this `` supertube '' is actually a magnetube because it preserves a null supersymmetry .",
    "indeed , the constructions of supertubes and magnetubes are mathematically parallel and , following the logic of section [ sect : susytypes ] , one can think of magnetubes as infinitely - boosted supertubes . in section [",
    "sect : temp ] we also check the regularity and asymptotic structure of this magnetube solution . in section [ sect : sosoln ] we introduce species oscillation into the template magnetube and give an example in which the metric does not oscillate .",
    "we also see that the metrics of the oscillating solutions are almost identical to those of the template solutions and are therefore regular . in section",
    "[ sect : modes ] we give details of the green s functions and explicit mode functions that are the essential , though technical , part of our solutions with species oscillation . while our examples involve only very simple microstate geometries , they will nevertheless provide a good local model of what we expect from species oscillation in a generic bubbling solution .",
    "finally we make some concluding remarks in section [ sect : conclusions ] .",
    "in this section we illustrate one of the key ingredients of species oscillation : the fact that one can mix both time - like and null supersymmetric components within a single , five - dimensional solution .",
    "we will assume some familiarity with the five - dimensional microstate geometries that have been constructed over the last few years .",
    "one can find discussions of this in , for example , @xcite .",
    "in section [ sect : addvms ] we will discuss the general form of five - dimensional @xmath18 supergravity coupled to an arbitrary number of vector multiplets and this can also serve as something of a review of the relevant supergravity structure but in greater generality than is needed to understand the merging of the two types of supersymmetry . since the latter idea is something rather new , we have chosen to show how it works here first before diving more deeply into the technicalities of the more complicated supergravity theories that are needed to implement species oscillation . for newcomers to the microstate geometry program it might be useful to review section [ sect : addvms ] first .      in both eleven - dimensional and five - dimensional supergravity",
    "there are two distinct classes of supersymmetry , which are classified by whether the associated `` time '' translation invariance is actually time - like or null .",
    "more precisely , if @xmath8 is the residual supersymmetry then the vector @xmath19 is necessarily a killing vector , and it can either be time - like or null @xcite .",
    "it is relatively easy to see that the vector is dominated by its time component because , in frame indices , one has @xmath20 . to investigate the other components one needs to know a little more about the structure of the supersymmetry .",
    "one the simplest descriptions of bps three - charge black holes in five dimensions is obtained by compactifying eleven - dimensional supergravity on a six - torus , @xmath15 .",
    "the charges are then carried by three sets of mutually bps m2-branes and thus the supersymmetries obey the projection conditions @xmath21 where the five - dimensional space - time is coordinatized by @xmath22 and the @xmath15 is coordinatized by @xmath23 .",
    "the microstate geometries corresponding to such black holes are , by definition , required to have the same supersymmetries , in that they also satisfy ( [ proj1 ] ) .",
    "one should also note that because @xmath24 , the conditions ( [ proj1 ] ) also imply @xmath25 which constrains the holonomy of the spatial base .    one can now insert the @xmath26 into ( [ kvform ] ) and commute through the @xmath27 .",
    "the fact that @xmath27 , for @xmath28 , anti - commutes with at least one of the @xmath26 means that @xmath29 for @xmath28 and so the killing vector for such black holes and their microstate geometries is necessarily time - like .",
    "the bps three - charge black holes and their microstate geometries are dominated by their electric charge structure but can carry non - zero , `` dipolar '' magnetic charge distributions whose fields fall off too fast to give any net charge at infinity .",
    "there is a simple magnetic dual of this picture in which the m2 branes are replaced by m5 branes .",
    "we will take the m5 branes to have a common direction , @xmath30 , which , for the present , will be flat and either infinite or a trivially fibered @xmath13 .",
    "the m5-brane supersymmetries obey the projection conditions @xmath31 and these also imply the @xmath14-momentum projection condition : @xmath32 again one can insert the @xmath33 into ( [ kvform ] ) and commute through the @xmath27 and conclude that @xmath29 for @xmath34 . moreover",
    "( [ proj2a ] ) implies @xmath35 and so the killing vector is necessarily null .",
    "thus these systems of m2 branes and m5 branes are exemplars of the two classes of supersymmetric systems in five and eleven dimensions .    for our purposes ,",
    "it is important to note that , just as the bps three - charge black holes and microstate geometries can be given non - zero , `` dipolar '' magnetic charge distributions whose fields fall off too fast to give any net charge at infinity , the m5 brane system can be given non - zero , `` dipolar '' _ electric _ charge distributions whose fields fall off too fast to give any net charge at infinity . in this way one can make bps magnetubes that have no net electric charge and",
    "this observation will lie at the heart of supersymmetric species oscillation .",
    "so far we have considered rather simple classes of bps configurations and , as we will see , more complex bps backgrounds can lead to mixtures of both types of supersymmetry .",
    "specifically we want to consider backgrounds that have become the standard fare for the construction of microstate geometries and not use the more usual labeling , @xmath36 .",
    "we have therefore taken the standard description and replaced the label @xmath37 by @xmath38 everywhere . ] .",
    "the eleven - dimensional metric has the form : @xmath39 where the four - dimensional space - time metric has the standard gibbons - hawking ( gh ) form : @xmath40 with @xmath41 the eleven - dimensional maxwell three - form potential is given by @xmath42 with the five - dimensional maxwell fields , @xmath43 , given by : @xmath44 with @xmath45 .",
    "the whole solution is then specified by eight harmonic functions , @xmath46 , @xmath47 , @xmath48 and @xmath49 , on @xmath50 , and these are typically taken to have the form : @xmath51 @xmath52 where @xmath53 .",
    "the electrostatic potentials and warp factor functions , @xmath54 , are given by @xmath55 where @xmath56 .",
    "the angular - momentum vector , @xmath57 , decomposes into : @xmath58 where : @xmath59 and where @xmath60 is the solution to : @xmath61      one can uplift the five - dimensional supergravity solutions to six dimensions by using one of the vector fields to make a kk fiber .",
    "we will discuss this extensively in section [ sect : temp ] but here we simply want to note that in the six - dimensional uplift there is only one kind of supersymmetry @xcite : the null supersymmetry with @xmath62 .",
    "the two types of supersymmetry in five dimensions must therefore emerge from the details of the compactification to five dimensions . in this sense",
    "one might naturally expect to unify the two classes of supersymmetry , and we will now elucidate how this can be seen directly from the five - dimensional perspective .",
    "as have been extensively noted elsewhere @xcite the metric on the four - dimensional base is allowed to be ambi - polar , that is , it is allowed to change signature from @xmath10 to @xmath11 . in spite of this , the five - dimensional and eleven - dimensional metrics are smooth and lorentzian . in particular , this means that @xmath46 is allowed to change sign and the surfaces where @xmath63 are called _",
    "critical surfaces_. one can make a careful examination of the metric ( [ elevenmetric ] ) and maxwell fields ( [ aifield ] ) and show that the apparently singular terms involving negative powers of @xmath46 actually cancel out on critical surfaces , leaving a smooth background .",
    "it is also important to note that the functions @xmath64 must satisfy @xmath65 everywhere in order for the metric ( [ elevenmetric ] ) to be real and lorentizian .",
    "this is not to say that nothing is happening at the critical surfaces .",
    "observe the the norm of the killing vector , @xmath66 , is simply @xmath67 since the @xmath64 are globally positive , this means that @xmath68 is time - like except on critical surfaces , where it becomes null .",
    "thus the supersymmetries are time - like almost everywhere , except on critical surfaces where they momentarily become null .",
    "it is therefore possible , in principle , to have both types of supersymmetry within one class of solutions .",
    "indeed , black - hole microstate geometries have the same time - like supersymmetries at infinity as a black hole and generically have critical surfaces in the interior of the solution where the supersymmetries become null .",
    "it is instructive to see how this comes about in detail .",
    "introduce the obvious frames for the five - dimensional metric : @xmath69 where @xmath70 note that we have chosen to write these quantities in terms of the positive functions , @xmath64 , so that the fractional powers are unambiguous and have no branch cuts .",
    "also observe that the frames @xmath71 and @xmath72 are , respectively , degenerate or singular on critical surfaces .",
    "define null frames : @xmath73 and thus @xmath74    it is also convenient to introduce the quantity @xmath75 and recall @xcite that the general expression for @xmath76 can be written in terms of the @xmath77 invariant that determines the four - dimensional horizon area for black - hole solutions : @xmath78 in particular , it follows from ( [ qreduced ] ) that @xmath76 is smooth across the critical ( @xmath63 ) surfaces .",
    "the whole point is that while the frames @xmath71 and @xmath72 are singular on the critical surfaces , @xmath79 and @xmath80 are _ smooth _ on these surfaces . to see this , note that @xmath81 it follows from ( [ ziform ] ) and ( [ muform ] ) that @xmath82 and @xmath83 are well behaved on critical surfaces and thus @xmath79 is manifestly well behaved",
    "now observe that @xmath84 and that as @xmath85 , the second factor is finite .",
    "since @xmath76 is finite as @xmath85 , it follows that the first factor in ( [ qfac ] ) must be similarly finite and hence @xmath80 is finite on critical surfaces .",
    "more explicitly , define @xmath86 and note that global positivity of @xmath87 implies that @xmath88 on critical surfaces and so @xmath89 is real and smooth across these surfaces . as @xmath85 , one finds @xmath90 which are clearly regular as @xmath91 .",
    "finally , define new canonical lorentzian frames via @xmath92 these are also regular as one crosses the @xmath63 surface but more importantly , they manifestly represent a lorentz boost of the original frames ( [ obvframes ] ) with boost parameter , @xmath93 , determined by @xmath94 thus one can see that the original frames are singular at @xmath63 precisely because they are infinitely boosted relative to a smooth set of frames .",
    "this is consistent with the fact that the killing vector , @xmath95 , becomes momentarily null at @xmath63 .",
    "now recall the identity @xmath96 where we are using frame indices based on ( [ obvframes ] ) .",
    "this implies that in this singular frame basis the magnitude of @xmath8 vanishes as @xmath97 when @xmath91 .",
    "passing to the non - singular frames ( [ ehatdefn ] ) requires a lorentz boost that acts on @xmath8 : @xmath98 this means that on the @xmath63 surface only the components satisfying @xmath99 remain finite .",
    "thus the killing spinor is time - like everywhere except where @xmath63 , where it becomes momentarily null .",
    "we therefore conclude that if @xmath100 then the supersymmetry is precisely that of the three - charge m2-brane system , but on the @xmath63 surfaces this supersymmetry becomes compatible with the supersymmetry of m5 branes wrapped on the @xmath14-circle and with momentum charge on that circle .",
    "the fact that , despite appearances , the bps solutions described in section [ sect : classic ] are regular across @xmath63 surfaces enables one to take this somewhat further and find classes of bps solutions by taking @xmath101 everywhere . as one might anticipate from the discussion above , these solutions have null supersymmetry and are sourced primarily by m5 branes and momentum .    to take this limit one can rescale @xmath102 everywhere in the solutions of section [ sect : classic ] and take @xmath103 to zero .",
    "the metric ( [ elevenmetric ] ) simplifies to @xmath104 where @xmath89 is defined in ( [ ckdefn ] ) and @xmath105 is simply @xmath76 with @xmath101 : @xmath106 the angular momentum vector , @xmath107 , is now determined by the simpler equation @xmath108 the electromagnetic fields ( [ aifield ] ) reduce to the purely magnetic forms : @xmath109 this is the solution that corresponds to the infinite magnetube and , as expected , the killing vector , @xmath66 , is manifestly null everywhere in the metric ( [ red11metric ] ) .",
    "species oscillation requires the addition of extra vector multiplets to the @xmath110 supergravity theory employed in section [ sect : susytypes ] and we will therefore summarize the relevant aspects of these theories . our conventions and normalizations will be those of @xcite .    the action of @xmath110 , five - dimensional supergravity coupled to @xmath111 @xmath0 gauge fields is given by : @xmath112 with @xmath113 .",
    "the extra photon lies in the gravity multiplet and so there are only @xmath111 independent scalars .",

    "one now defines @xmath114 independent functions , @xmath54 by @xmath132 and then ( [ cconstr2 ] ) implies @xmath133 it is more convenient to think of the solution as parametrized by the @xmath114 independent scalars , @xmath54 , and that the warp factor is determined by ( [ zreln ] ) .",
    "supersymmetry requires that the maxwell potentials all have the form @xmath134 where @xmath135 are purely magnetic components on the spatial base manifold , @xmath131 .",
    "one defines the magnetic field strengths accordingly : @xmath136 having made all these definitions , the bps equations take on their canonical linear form @xcite : @xmath137 where @xmath138 is the hodge dual in the four - dimensional base metric @xmath130 , and @xmath139 is the ( four - dimensional ) laplacian of this metric .",

    "one can then use ( [ muform2 ] ) in ( [ simpcovkeqn ] ) to simplify the right - hand side to obtain @xmath154 one can verify that the covariant divergence ( using @xmath155 ) generates an identity that is trivially satisfied as a consequence of ( [ avreln ] ) , ( [ lorgauge ] ) , ( [ muform2 ] ) and @xmath156      from the eleven - dimensional perspective , we are going to add extra maxwell fields coming from three - form potentials with two legs on the @xmath17 defined by @xmath157 but leave the fields on the other @xmath16 , defined by @xmath158 unchanged and supporting only one maxwell field , which we have labelled as @xmath159 .",
    "thus the only non - zero components of intersection product , @xmath127 , are @xmath160 for some matrix , @xmath161 .",

    "however , some of these vector fields belong to @xmath18 gravitino multiplets and do not lie in an @xmath18 supergravity theory coupled to vector multiplets .",
    "indeed , the vector fields in such an @xmath18 supergravity theory are associated with forms in @xmath165 @xcite for a suitably chosen complex structure .",

    "we are ultimately seeking microstate geometries with species oscillation .",
    "this is most easily achieved by using charge density modes on supertubes and for such geometries to be smooth we must go to six - dimensional supergravity .",

    "remarkably , however , we can choose the oscillating charge densities in such a way that the metric is completely independent of @xmath14 .",
    "as described in the introduction , this works in a manner rather reminiscent of @xmath12-balls : the species fluctuate but the energy - momentum tensor , and hence the metric does not .",
    "the basic idea is to arrange that @xmath363 for some function @xmath364 . from the asymptotic properties of the @xmath337",
    ", it follows that we must have @xmath365 where @xmath180 is a constant .",
    "then will make the warp factor @xmath183 independent of @xmath14 , while makes the angular momentum density determined by a constant , and hence @xmath49 is independent of @xmath14 . since @xmath178 is unchanged by the addition of the supertube ( as in the non - oscillating template ) , the full metric preserves the killing symmetry , @xmath366 .",
    "it is clearly easy to choose the charge densities to satisfy ; this is just one constraint on the three free functions .",
    "it is a much taller order to satisfy , however , as this must be satisfied for all @xmath367 , and we only have the freedom to choose the source functions that are functions only of @xmath14 .",
    "however , the isometry of the base metric along @xmath14 means that the solution can be decomposed into fourier modes , and if we take the source charge densities to involve a single fourier mode , then we can take solutions @xmath368 that take a product form , @xmath369 , and the @xmath367 dependence factors out of which reduces simply to .",
    "thus , we can satisfy ( [ lamquad ] ) by taking , for example , @xmath370 where @xmath180 is a constant and @xmath371 is normalized so that @xmath372 as @xmath188 .    in this way , species @xmath373 is locked to species @xmath126 and they oscillate into species @xmath37 and @xmath234 .",
    "( there is obviously a family of choices of how to distribute the oscillations amongst species @xmath37 and @xmath234 in such a way as to satisfy ( [ rhoquad ] ) . )",
    "we will compute the details of the functions @xmath371 in section [ sect : modes ] , but before going into the technicalities we can make some observations about the solution .",
    "first note that ( [ rhoquad ] ) and ( [ rhohatreln ] ) imply that @xmath359 is constant , and the identity ( [ rhohatreln ] ) collapses precisely to that of the template solution ( [ constr3 ] ) .",
    "this means that the function @xmath49 is exactly as in ( [ mform ] ) .",
    "note , in particular , that @xmath49 still knows about the _ amplitude _ , @xmath180 , of the species oscillation .",
    "furthermore , having @xmath350 , @xmath344 and @xmath374 means that the @xmath337 cancel out in the function @xmath140 in ( [ muform ] ) and so it is exactly the same function as it was in the template solution of section [ sect : temp ] .",
    "similarly , the @xmath337 cancel out in ( [ simpomegaeqn ] ) and the fact that @xmath49 is independent of @xmath14 means that @xmath60 satisfies exactly the same equation as in the template solution and so is identical with the solution ( [ omres ] ) .",
    "the only difference between the metric of the oscillating solution and the metric of the template arises in the warp factor , @xmath183 , given by ( [ hdefn ] ) .",
    "it follows from ( [ ziform ] ) , ( [ samekform ] ) , ( [ newlform ] ) , ( [ z34simp ] ) and ( [ lamquad ] ) that @xmath375 ^ 2~-~   \\lambda(\\vec y)^2     \\ , . \\label{hsqident}\\ ] ] the important point is that this function is independent of @xmath14 and thus @xmath376 is still a killing vector of the metric even though the maxwell fields and scalars are @xmath14-dependent .",
    "because of ( [ rhoquad ] ) the function @xmath183 also has exactly the same behavior as @xmath341 as its counterpart ( [ htemp ] ) in the template solution .",
    "thus the local regularity of the metric is guaranteed by that of the template solution .",
    "the fact that the metric is unchanged apart from this change in the warp factor @xmath183 also implies that leading - order asymptotics of the metric are also the same as for the non - oscillating solution .",
    "indeed , the asymptotics is independent of the assumption that the full metric is @xmath14-independent .",
    "any @xmath14-dependence in @xmath183 is subleading at large distances , and thus so long as is satisfied so that the angular momentum is @xmath14-independent , the leading - order asymptotics will be the same as in the non - oscillating solution .",
    "thus , for all solutions satisfying , the overall amplitude of the oscillating charge densities is bounded by .",
    "furthermore , the @xmath377 in will not contribute to the asymptotic stress tensor : as we we will see in the next subsection , the functions @xmath378 represent higher multipole moments and therefore fall off faster than @xmath379 , so @xmath377 in falls off faster than @xmath380 .",
    "thus this term falls off too fast to contribute to the sub - leading part of the metric that gives the asymptotic charges . for the gauge fields",
    ", there was no contribution to charges in the non - oscillating case due to the absence of a logarithmic term in ; the faster fall - off in the oscillating solution does not change this .",
    "thus , the asymptotics of solutions with species oscillation where the angular momentum density is a constant is very similar to the non - oscillating case . the only notable difference in the asymptotics is that the suppression of @xmath378 implies that the wilson line noted in is absent in the oscillating solution .",
    "to obtain the explicit details of our oscillating solution we need to solve ( [ lharm ] ) on the base defined by ( [ ghmetric ] ) with ( [ vform ] ) .",
    "fortunately the relevant green s function was computed in @xcite .",

    "this description of the modes appears to be rather singular at @xmath432 , particularly given the form of @xmath424 in ( [ params3 ] ) .",
    "this limit corresponds to @xmath433 and represents the axis through all the source points .",
    "it is easy to see that this apparent singularity is an artifact of how we assembled the modes .",
    "indeed , one can easily take the limit of @xmath434 in ( [ fdefn ] ) and define @xmath435 and hence @xmath436 which is manifestly smooth and , in fact , only non - zero for @xmath417 .",
    "one can therefore take the view that @xmath431 has the role of generating the proper singular source at @xmath189 and then @xmath430 has the role of fixing all the other unphysical singularities in @xmath431 .",
    "as we have already seen , @xmath437 and this was used to set the normalization of the modes .",
    "the first few chebyshev polynomials are @xmath438 thus @xmath439 where we have used ( [ invparams1 ] ) and ( [ invparams2 ] ) .",

    "we can easily prove this form in general by recalling that the green s function was obtained in @xcite by taking the green s function on the @xmath206 space and kaluza - klein reducing to obtain the green s function on the ambi - polar base .",
    "the asymptotic behaviour of the fourier modes of the green s function on the @xmath206 space is then easily obtained by a conventional spherical harmonic analysis on the @xmath229 .    from the perspective of @xmath206 , since @xmath449 , our fourier expansion @xmath450 corresponds to an expansion @xmath451 the green s function can be decomposed in terms of the spherical harmonics @xmath452 on the @xmath229 ; in this decomposition , @xmath371 will only involve spherical harmonics with @xmath453 . doing a kaluza - klein reduction on the @xmath229 ,",
    "the massless wave equation on @xmath206 becomes a massive wave equation on @xmath239 for each spherical harmonic mode with a mass @xmath454 .",
    "thus , @xmath455 where at large @xmath277 @xmath456 so @xmath457 , that is at most @xmath448 . from the perspective of the @xmath206 asymptotics ,",
    "the species oscillation of the supertube is introducing a variation of the fields along the @xmath458 direction in the @xmath229 , so it corresponds to exciting higher kk harmonics , which produce vevs for higher - dimension operators in the dual cft rather than exciting local charge densities of the conserved currents .",
    "our aim has been to show that the object underlying the species oscillation idea introduced in @xcite is a supersymmetric magnetube : a combination of ( m5 and p ) magnetic charges as well as several oscillating ( m2 ) electric charges , that carries the same supersymmetries as m5 branes and momentum regardless of the oscillations of its electric charges .",
    "trying to bend this object into a ring in @xmath7 will break these supersymmetries , and will result in neutral configurations that have been proposed in @xcite to describe microstate geometries of neutral schwarzschild black holes .",
    "we have also succeeded in realizing the species oscillation idea in a supersymmetric context , by embedding the magnetube into supersymmetric solutions . in doing this",
    "we have uncovered a remarkable unification of the `` timelike '' and `` null '' types of supersymmetries directly in the framework of five - dimensional supergravity ; the `` timelike '' supersymmetry on an ambi - polar background becomes locally null on the surface @xmath63 .",
    "hence an object that would be invariant only under the magnetic - type `` null '' supersymmetries , like the magnetube , can be placed on this surface while preserving the global electric - type `` timelike '' supersymmetry .",
    "this enables us to construct solutions with species oscillation which preserve supersymmetry globally .",
    "we have carefully analyzed the smoothness conditions for magnetubes on the @xmath63 surface , initially for a magnetube without species oscillation and then for a magnetube with m2 electric charge densities that vary around the tube in such a way that the net m2 charges vanish .",
    "we found that this magnetube can be obtained by moving a supertube onto the @xmath63 surface ( which corresponds to giving it an infinite boost ) and that , in the @xmath459 limit , the smoothness conditions of the supertube are enough to ensure the smoothness of the magnetube .",
    "we constructed a simple example of a solution with species oscillation and gave an explicit description of its structure . in this example , the geometry is independent of the @xmath14 coordinate ; the gauge fields are oscillating but their combination in the stress tensor is @xmath14-independent , as in the exact near - tube solution discussed in @xcite .",
    "the simple example we have considered is asymptotically @xmath206 , and it would be interesting to understand the interpretation of the solution with species oscillation from the point of view of the dual cft .",
    "a key aspect is that when we introduce the @xmath14-dependent source , the non - diagonality of the metric in the angular coordinates makes the solution a function of @xmath460 , as can be seen in the green s function .",
    "this combination becomes an angle in the @xmath229 factor in the asymptotic solution .",
    "thus , from the point of view of the @xmath206 background , the species oscillation is not introducing dependence on the angular coordinate in the @xmath239 ( shifting @xmath461 at fixed @xmath458 remains a symmetry of the solution ) but on one of the angular coordinates on the @xmath229 .",
    "thus , understanding the interpretation of our solution in the dual cft will involve a kaluza - klein decomposition along the lines of @xcite",
    ".    it will obviously be interesting to further exploit this new freedom in constructing supersymmetric smooth microstate geometries .",
    "it gives us a new possibility to introduce dipole charges .",
    "examples of solutions with varying charge densities were previously constructed in @xcite , but we can now construct solutions with zero net charge . another interesting direction for further development is to consider species oscillation on supersymmetric black strings and black rings .      following the direction of @xcite ,",
    "probably the most interesting question to ask is if one can deform our supersymmetric solutions to construct non - supersymmetric asymptotically - flat solutions , as a step towards constructing microstates for black holes like schwarzschild .",
    "the solution we constructed above is asymptotically @xmath206 , but one should be able to construct similar supersymmetric solutions that are asymptotically flat in five dimensions by considering a supertube / magnetube at the @xmath63 surface in a more general gibbons - hawking base that gives rise to an asymptotically flat background .",
    "we have also seen that the oscillating charge distributions do indeed make no net contribution to the charges measured from infinity . on the other hand , the size of the oscillation is still bounded by the background magnetic fluxes and hence by the asymptotic charges .",
    "it is remarkable that one can have stationary asymptotically flat solutions ; one might physically expect that a varying charge density on a rotating object would give rise to time - dependent multipole moments , which would lead to electromagnetic radiation .",
    "however , the resolution is a familiar effect in supertubes ; the supertube is rotating , but the charge on the supertube corresponds to a charge density wave traveling around the tube in the opposite direction , so that we get a standing wave . as a result , the multipole moments of our supersymmetric solutions , whose oscillating parts may be viewed as superubes / magnetubes , will all be time - independent .    on the other hand , this cancellation of the time - dependence coming from having a standing wave is a fine - tuned phenomenon .",
    "if we excite the supertube / magnetube by adding some energy , we will need to make it rotate faster to maintain the stabilization by angular momentum , and it is possible that the counter - rotating charge density wave will then give rise to time - dependent multipole moments .",
    "if true , this would a real obstacle to finding stationary non - supersymmetric solutions .",
    "note also that the non - stationarity is associated with the emission of electromagnetic radiation , so the natural timescale for the decay is likely to be much faster than the gravitational timescales associated with a black hole .",
    "the solution discussed in @xcite is vulnerable to a similar problem . in the exact near - tube solutions the authors introduce dependence on a null coordinate @xmath462 , corresponding to a charge density that is a function of @xmath463 . in the near - tube solution",
    "@xmath464 is a coordinate along a straight black string , and this is related to a solution with charge density depending just on the position along the string by an ( infinite ) boost .",
    "but in the full asymptotically - flat solution this corresponds to a truly time - dependent charge distribution , and we expect that this will lead to electromagnetic radiation in the sub - leading corrections to the solution , introducing time - dependence in the metric on a timescale set by the electromagnetic radiation reaction .",
    "thus we believe that species oscillation has opened up an even larger , new moduli space of bps microstate geometries but remain uncertain whether this idea can be adapted to yield stationary non - bps configurations .",

    "<S> it is this property that enables the species oscillation of magnetubes to be compatible with supersymmetry . </S>",
    "<S> we give an example in which the species oscillate non - trivially around a circle within a microstate geometry , and yet the energy - momentum tensor and metric are completely independent of this circle : only the amplitude of the oscillation influences the metric .    </S>",
