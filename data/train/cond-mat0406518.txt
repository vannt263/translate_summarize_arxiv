    "in general , level splitting due to structure inversion asymmetry , sia , known as rashba s - o splitting@xcite is inversely proportional to the energy gap .",
    "s - o coupling is zero for s - like conduction bands and strong in p - like hole states .",
    "however , mixing of the conduction subbands with the valence subbands increases with decreasing energy gap .",
    "it has been shown that electrons in narrow gap heterostructures based on hgte@xcite , exhibit strong rashba s - o coupling .",
    "in addition to the small energy gap in hgte quantum wells , qw s , another important factor contributing to the large magnitude of the rashba s - o coupling is the inverted band structure of hgte qw s with well widths greater than 6  nm , in which the first conduction band has heavy hole character.@xcite    for possible applications in spintronics,@xcite the rashba effect has recently been investigated in a number of narrow gap iii - v systems@xcite in which typical values of the rashba s - o splitting energy , @xmath7 , are 3 to 5  mev .",

    "et al._@xcite demonstrated that the rashba s - o interaction is the dominant mechanism in such structures ; they studied the strong dependence of s - o splitting on gate voltage and its subsequent disappearance when the qw was symmetric as expected for the rashba effect .",
    "compared to the observation of a series of nodes in shubnikov - de haas , sdh , oscillations for an in@xmath8ga@xmath9as heterostructure@xcite at @xmath10  t , similar beating patterns are observable at higher magnetic fields in hgte heterostructures@xcite due to its larger rashba effect .    in this article",

    "ohmic indium contacts to the hall bars were formed by thermal bonding .",
    "magneto - transport measurements were carried out in several different cryostats using dc techniques with currents of 1 to 5  @xmath23a in magnetic fields ranging up to 15 t and temperature from 1.4 to 35 k. during the measurement , the applied electric field was kept low enough to avoid excessive electron heating.@xcite",
