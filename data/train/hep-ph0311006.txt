    "the qcd - inspired light - front constituent quark model  @xcite , with two components in the interaction , a contact term and a coulomb - like potential , was used previously to investigate the properties of mesons  @xcite with reasonable success .",
    "it was also applied to investigate the binding energy of the ground state of spin 1/2 @xmath0 baryons  @xcite , where the coulomb - like interaction was left out . in that work",
    ", a special regularization scheme was used in which the masses of the virtual two - body subsystems were constrained to be real , as a result the quark binding in the spin 1/2 low - lying states of the @xmath1 , @xmath4 and @xmath3 was qualitatively reproduced .",
    "recently , the integral equation for a three - boson system interacting with pairwise contact interaction in the light - front @xcite was regularized with a sharp cut - off @xcite and applied in the study of the nucleon . in the infinite cut - off limit",
    "it was previously shown that the three - boson system is stable for values of the two - boson bound state mass above a critical value @xcite .",
    "this motivate us to study the effect of different cut - offs in the @xmath0 ground state masses , obtained by solving the light - front integral equations with a contact interaction .",
    "our aim here is to check to which extend the qualitative properties of the quark binding is regularization independent .",
    "we use only the flavor independent contact interaction between the constituent quarks , which brings the physical scale of the ground state of the nucleon and includes the minimal number of physical scales to describe @xmath0 systems . the spin is averaged out .",
    "the model has as inputs the constituent quark masses and the nucleon mass is used to fix the interaction strength . in our previous work @xcite , where the masses of the virtual two - quark subsystems were constrained to be real with the nucleon mass fixed at the experimental value , there was no freedom left in the @xmath0 calculation",
    ". here , even with the nucleon mass kept fixed still the cut - off has some freedom , which will be varied in our calculations . to obtain the @xmath0 masses ,",
    "the mass of one of the constituent quark @xmath5 is varied while the strength of the effective contact interaction is supposed flavor independent .",
    "this work is organized as follows . in sec.2",
    ", we briefly discuss the coupled integral equations for the @xmath0 bound - state in the light - front and the regularization schemes . in sec . 3 , we present the numerical results for the binding energies of the @xmath6 , @xmath4 and @xmath7 and give a summary of the work with our conclusion .",
    "with the assumption that the spin is averaged out , the @xmath0 system interacting through a contact pairwise force is represented by two spectator functions or faddeev components of the vertex , which satisfies the coupled bethe - salpeter type equations , derived elsewhere @xcite , and shown diagrammatically in fig .  1 .     system . ,",

    "our results show that the general behavior of the experimental data of masses and binding energies of the spin 1/2 low - lying states of @xmath43 , @xmath4 and @xmath3 are reproduced with different momentum cut - off s constrained by the value of the nucleon mass .    in summary , in the present contribution",
    "we have studied how different regularization schemes in the relativistic coupled @xmath0 homogeneous integral equation affects the qualitative properties of the quark binding in @xmath0 baryons .",
    "our calculations indicate that the general features of the low - lying spin 1/2 baryon binding energy as a function of its mass , is model independent to a large extent ( small cut - off sensitivity ) as long as the relativistic @xmath0 model has a flavor independent effective short - range interaction . therefore , the conclusions drawn in our previous work @xcite does not qualitatively depend on the regularization scheme .",
