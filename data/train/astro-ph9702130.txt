    "the ambitious goal of characterizing the morphology of cosmic structure in a unique and complete way leads to the field of integral geometry . there ,",
    "this problem has been well  posed and hadwiger s theorem ( , see also for a proof ) gives a powerful answer : in @xmath0 spatial dimensions the global morphological properties ( defined as those which satisfy motional invariance and additivity ) of any pattern can be completely characterized by @xmath1 numbers , the so  called minkowski functionals @xcite .",
    "furthermore , in the interesting cases of two and three dimensions , all the minkowski functionals can be intuitively interpreted in terms of well  known geometric quantities .",
    "one of them is the euler characteristic @xmath2 , or equivalently the genus @xmath3 , which has long been used as a statistical tool in cosmology .",
    "the standard analysis technique starts from a density or temperature field . for a point process",
    "it is usually constructed by applying a smoothing filter with a constant width larger than the mean separation of points . for this field ,",
    "the euler characteristic of an isocontour at level @xmath4 is obtained , according to the gauss  bonnet theorem , through a surface integration of the gaussian curvature .",
    "this threshold level can be employed as a diagnostic parameter , and the genus represented as a function of @xmath4 ( see , , and references therein ) can be compared with analytically known values for gaussian random fields @xcite and even for some nonlinear dynamical models such as solutions of the lagrangian perturbation theory @xcite .",
    "this method for calculating the genus or , as advocated in the present _ letter _ , all four minkowski functionals , suffers from erasing small  scale information @xcite when going from point sets to smooth density fields .",
    "while this may actually be an advantage when trying to deemphasize poorly understood effects such as nonlinear evolution and biasing , some discriminatory power is lost . in this situation ,",
    "introduced minkowski functionals of point processes into cosmology . proceeding as directly as possible they decorate each point with a ball of radius @xmath5 , which becomes the diagnostic parameter for this method of analysis .",
    "thereby a union set of balls is constructed and probes the morphological properties of the point set .",
    "these are measured in a complete and unique way using minkowski functionals , so powerful methods of integral geometry @xcite become applicable .",
    "most notably , minkowski functionals contain a variety of other descriptors such as the `` void probability function '' @xcite , and depend on the complete hierarchy of correlations @xcite .",
    "analytically known results for the poisson process @xcite provide a useful standard of reference ; the additivity property in integral geometry leads to robustness against various sources of error @xcite ; the sensitivity to small  scale clustering properties allows for efficient discrimination , as has been demonstrated in recent applications to the abell / aco cluster catalogue @xcite and the iras 1.2jy catalogue @xcite .",
    "a brief tutorial on minkowski functionals in cosmology can be found in .    in this _",
    "letter _ we advocate the use of the whole family of minkowski functionals to analyze the continuous random fields encountered in cosmology .",
    "thereby we obtain more information than by measuring the genus alone .",
    "furthermore , recent work ( , see also for a direct comparison ) has shown that other minkowski functionals such as the surface area and the integrated mean curvature can possess greater discriminatory power than the euler characteristic . apart from this practical advantage , which was already pointed out for the area by",
    ", the use of all the minkowski functionals leads to a conceptual generalization of genus statistics , incorporates it into the firm mathematical framework of integral geometry and stereology and allows for a straightforward evaluation , including exact correction for boundary effects .",
    "the _ letter _ is organized as follows .",
    "section 2 uses the methods of differential geometry to reduce the evaluation of minkowski functionals to a spatial average of koenderink invariants .",
    "section 3 employs integral geometry , namely crofton s intersection formula , to derive a second calculational method that relies on the representation of the density field by its values at lattice points .",
    "section 4 gives the analytical formulae for all the minkowski functionals of gaussian random fields , while section 5 compares them to the results obtained by applying our two approximation formulae to numerically simulated gaussian random fields .",
    "section 6 provides an outlook .",
    "consider a random field @xmath6 on a @xmath0dimensional support @xmath7 . for a given threshold @xmath4",
    "the excursion set @xmath8 is the set of all points @xmath9 with @xmath10 .",
    "we wish to calculate its minkowski functionals @xmath11 per unit volume .",
    "the volume functional @xmath12 is simply given by volume integration of a heaviside step function @xmath13 , normalized to the whole volume @xmath14 , @xmath15    in three dimensions , the other minkowski functionals correspond to quantities known from differential geometry , namely the surface area , the integrated mean curvature and the euler characteristic @xcite .",
    "they can be evaluated by a surface integration @xmath16 the local minkowski functionals @xmath17 \\rv_2^{({\\rm loc})}(\\nu,\\bx)&=&\\dfrac{1}{6\\pi } \\left(\\dfrac{1}{r_1}+\\dfrac{1}{r_2}\\right)\\\\[1ex ] \\rv_3^{({\\rm loc})}(\\nu,\\bx)&=&\\dfrac{1}{4\\pi } \\dfrac{1}{r_1r_2 } \\end{array}\\ ] ] are nothing but appropriately normalized invariants made from the inverse radii of curvature @xmath18 and @xmath19 of the surface orientated towards lower density values .    using methods developed by koenderink @xcite in two  dimensional image analysis ,",
    "it is possible to express these local curvatures in terms of geometric invariants formed from first and second derivatives @xcite .",
    "the surface integration ( [ eq : surface ] ) is equivalent to taking the spatial mean over the whole volume , with a gradient for the surface element and a delta function for selecting the isodensity contour added as factors .",
    "the resulting formula is @xmath20 if the density field is sampled at some lattice points , we can therefore estimate the minkowski functionals by calculating the derivatives at each lattice point and replacing first the @xmath21-function with a bin of finite width and the average over all space with a sum over lattice points only .",
    "analogous formulae can be derived in two dimensions , so the most promising cosmological application of this particular method is an elegant way of calculating minkowski functionals for fields on the sphere , like all  sky maps of the cmb ( for existing work , see , and especially ) .",
    "another powerful approach to morphology of density fields comes through integral geometry @xcite . as above",
    "we consider a random field @xmath6 and measure the minkowski functionals @xmath11 of its excursion set over a threshold @xmath4 .",
    "to do this we use crofton s formula @xcite . for a body @xmath22 in @xmath0 dimensions we consider an arbitrary @xmath23dimensional hyperplane @xmath24 and calculate the euler characteristic @xmath2 of the intersection @xmath25 in @xmath23 dimensions . integrating this quantity over",
    "the space @xmath26 of all conceivable hyperplanes is normalized to give @xmath27 . ]",
    "we obtain the @xmath23th minkowski functional of the body @xmath22 in @xmath0 dimensions .",
    "crofton s formula states that is the volume of the unit ball in @xmath23 dimensions , so @xmath28 , @xmath29 , @xmath30 and @xmath31 . ]",
    "@xmath32 if the body @xmath22 is the excursion set of a homogeneous and isotropic random field sampled at @xmath33 points of a cubic lattice of spacing @xmath34 , we can as well average over the set @xmath35 of all dual lattice hyperplanes only .",
    "the integral is then replaced by a summation over these hyperplanes with an additional normalization factor and we obtain @xmath36 however , the euler characteristic of a body in @xmath23 dimensions can be approximated by counting the numbers @xmath37 of all elementary lattice cells of dimension @xmath38 within the body @xcite . in three dimensions , for example , @xmath39 gives the number of cubes within the body , @xmath40 and @xmath41 are the numbers of faces and edges of the lattice cubes , respectively , while @xmath42 gives the number of lattice points contained in @xmath22 .",
    "in general @xmath43 when summing equation ( [ eq : euler ] ) over all lattice hyperplanes , we notice that @xmath38dimensional lattice cells of the bodies @xmath25 result from intersections of a @xmath44dimensional lattice cell belonging to the body @xmath22 with @xmath23dimensional hyperplanes @xmath24 , so there are @xmath45 of them .",
    "so we can actually perform the summation @xmath46 and end up with the compact formula @xmath47 for a homogeneous and isotropic random field in three dimensions the minkowski functionals are thus given by @xmath48 \\rv_1(k)&=&\\dfrac{1}{al}(-\\tfrac{2}{3}n_3(k)+\\tfrac{2}{9}n_2(k))\\\\[1ex ] \\rv_2(k)&=&\\dfrac{1}{a^2l}(\\tfrac{2}{3}n_3(k)-\\tfrac{4}{9}n_2(k)+\\tfrac{2}{9}n_1(k))\\\\[1ex ] \\rv_3(k)&=&\\dfrac{1}{a^3l }   ( -n_3(k)+ n_2(k)-n_1(k)+n_0(k ) ) .",
    "\\end{array } \\label{eq : crofton}\\ ] ] note that the last relation for the euler characteristic @xmath49 per unit volume is not obtained from crofton s formula but is already given as a special case of equation ( [ eq : euler ] ) which results from the morse theorem @xcite .",
    "being conceptually simpler than the other approximations , it was proved rigorously by and used by to calculate the genus of isodensity contours in three dimensions . adding crofton s formula gives all the minkowski functionals without further computational effort , since the calculation requires nothing but the counting of all elementary lattice cells , which is already necessary for the genus .",
    "like the genus @xcite , all minkowski functionals are analytically known for a gaussian random field @xmath6 in @xmath0 dimensions , due to a highly instructive article by . again , consider the excursion set over a threshold @xmath4 and calculate its mean minkowski functionals @xmath11 per unit volume .    the result depends on only two parameters @xmath50 and @xmath51 , which in turn depend on the value of the correlation function @xmath52 and its second derivative @xmath53 at zero through @xmath54 both are easily measured from a given realization of the random field , since @xmath55 is the variance of the field itself and @xmath56 is the variance of any of its first derivatives @xcite .    with these two parameters",
    "all minkowski functionals in arbitrary dimension @xmath0 can be calculated for a gaussian random field @xcite . for the volume functional",
    "we obtain denotes the gaussian error integral , while @xmath57 defines a hermite function of order @xmath58 . ]",
    "@xmath59 while all other minkowski functionals are given by @xmath60 putting @xmath61 we obtain the minkowski functionals in three dimensions , we use the dimensionless argument @xmath62 , with @xmath63 . ]",
    "@xmath64 \\rv_1(\\nu)&=&\\tfrac{2}{3}\\dfrac{\\lambda}{\\sqrt{2\\pi}}\\expo\\\\[1ex ] \\rv_2(\\nu)&=&\\tfrac{2}{3}\\dfrac{\\lambda^2}{\\sqrt{2\\pi } } u \\expo\\\\[1ex ] \\rv_3(\\nu)&=&\\dfrac{\\lambda^3}{\\sqrt{2\\pi}}\\left(u^2 - 1\\right)\\expo .",
    "\\end{array } \\label{eq : tomita}\\ ] ]",
    "gaussian random fields provide a useful standard of reference and are always good for a pedagogical example . here",
    "we use a scale  invariant power spectrum to construct gaussian random fields on @xmath65 points in a unit cube .",
    "we apply a gaussian smoothing filter of width @xmath66 , which is chosen large in order to give a large variation between realizations .",
    "the field is normalized to @xmath67 and @xmath68 .",
    "then , we calculate the numerical estimates and the analytical predictions at 100 threshold values between @xmath69 and @xmath70 and obtain the mean and variance over 200 such curves .",
    "figure  [ fig : gauss ] shows three areas in each plot .",
    "one is measured by averaging koenderink invariants as in equation ( [ eq : koenderink ] ) , the second by using crofton s formula ( [ eq : crofton ] ) . however , these two are completely indistinguishable , so the two approximations are indeed equivalent .    a third area ( shaded , dotted lines ) is obtained by estimating the parameters @xmath50 and @xmath51 from each random field and computing the analytical mean minkowski functionals according to ( [ eq : tomita ] )",
    ". obviously the measured mean values fit the analytical expectations extremely well ; deviations are far from significant .",
    "since the analytical curves incorporate only statistical fluctuations in the determination of the parameters , their variance is reduced compared to the measured curves , which contain the full variance between and within samples .",
    "obviously , surface area @xmath71 and integrated mean curvature @xmath72 vary almost exclusively through parameter fluctuations , so these measures enhance the discriminatory power compared to considering the euler characteristic @xmath73 alone .",
    "we have extended the scope of genus statistics by considering all four minkowski functionals in three dimensions .",
    "two independent approaches gave us two different approximation formulae which we have tested by application to a gaussian random field .",
    "furthermore , we verified that our measurements fit the analytically known minkowski functionals of a gaussian random field .    even without analytical reference values",
    ", we have two complementary numerical formulae at our disposal which both rely on the approximation of a smooth density field by values at lattice points .",
    "the agreement between the two can be employed to determine the necessary smoothing length .",
    "too little smoothing would be easily detectable by discrepancies between the two formulae .",
    "forthcoming applications of the presented method will give intuitive interpretations of our novel access to cosmic morphology .",
    "practical issues such as boundary corrections ( see for point processes ) , and further tests of the robustness and discriminatory power are necessary beyond the promising results given here .",
