    "<S> using the density matrix renormalization group , we study domain wall structures in the @xmath0-@xmath1  model at a hole doping of @xmath2 . we find that the domain walls are composed of @xmath3   pairs and that the regions between the domain walls have antiferromagnetic correlations that are @xmath4 phase shifted across a domain wall . at @xmath2 , </S>",
    "<S> the hole filling corresponds to one hole per two domain wall unit cells . </S>",
    "<S> when the pairs in a domain wall are pinned by an external field , the @xmath3  pairing response is suppressed , but when the pinning is weakened , @xmath3  pair - field correlations can develop .    in the low temperature tetragonal ( ltt ) phase of la@xmath5nd@xmath6sr@xmath7cuo@xmath8 , the tilt pattern of the cuo@xmath9 octahedra form lines of displaced oxygens parallel to the cu - o bond directions . </S>",
    "<S> these lines are rotated by 90@xmath10 between adjacent layers . at a filling of @xmath2 , </S>",
    "<S> superconductivity is suppressed and neutron scattering studies@xcite reveal a striped domain wall ordering of holes and spins which is believed to be commensurately locked by the tilt distortion of the lattice . </S>",
    "<S> one model for this striped order@xcite is illustrated in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 1(a ) . here </S>",
    "<S> the charge domain walls are shown running vertically and centered along the cu - o - cu legs , although the phase information required to determine whether the domains should be leg centered or bond centered ( centered between two legs ) is not known . as shown , </S>",
    "<S> the domains are separated by four cu - o - cu spacings and for @xmath2 contain one hole per two @xmath11 domain wall unit cells . </S>",
    "<S> this latter feature is at odds with one - electron hartree - fock calculations@xcite which predict a domain wall filling of one hole per domain wall unit cell . </S>",
    "<S> the spins in the regions between the walls are antiferromagnetically correlated with a @xmath4 phase shift across a domain wall . when @xmath12 , superconductivity is found to coexist with a weakened domain wall ordering , suggesting a close connection between the two .    </S>",
    "<S> here we present results of numerical density matrix renormalization group calculations for a @xmath0-@xmath1  model with a hole doping @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> we find evidence for domain walls with @xmath4 phase - shifted antiferromagnetic regions separating the walls , and with a filling of one hole per two @xmath11 domain wall unit cells . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast to fig . </S>",
    "<S> 1(a ) , however , the domain walls are bond centered , and are made up of @xmath3   pairs of holes . </S>",
    "<S> we find that just as for the two - leg and four - leg ladder problems,@xcite there is a competition between a charge density wave ( cdw ) phase and a superconducting pair phase . </S>",
    "<S> the coulomb interaction , arising from the 90@xmath10 rotated domain walls on adjacent planes in the ltt phase@xcite , acts to pin the pairs within a domain wall for @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> we show that when this pinning is weakened , @xmath3   pair field correlations develop .    </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath0-@xmath1  hamiltonian we will study is given by @xmath13 here @xmath14 are near - neighbor sites , @xmath15 is a spin index , @xmath16 and @xmath17 , with @xmath18 ( @xmath19 ) an operator which creates ( destroys ) an electron at site @xmath20 with spin @xmath15 . </S>",
    "<S> the near - neighbor hopping interaction is @xmath0 , the near - neighbor exchange interaction is @xmath1 , and the gutzwiller projection operator @xmath21 excludes configurations with doubly occupied sites . </S>",
    "<S> we refer to the cu - cu lattice spacing as @xmath22 and measure energies in units of @xmath0 .    </S>",
    "<S> our calculations were carried out using a density matrix renormalization group@xcite ( dmrg ) algorithm in which transformation matrices were stored and used to construct the initial state for each superblock diagonalization@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we present results here for @xmath23 and @xmath24 doped systems . for the more difficult @xmath23 system </S>",
    "<S> , typically 10 equilibration sweeps were made through the lattice , keeping of order @xmath25 states per block on the final sweep . </S>",
    "<S> the transformation matrices were used to calculate the ground state expectation values of the desired operators at the end of the calculation . </S>",
    "<S> dmrg is extremely accurate for narrow systems , but its accuracy decreases rapidly as the width increases , and consequently , our @xmath23 systems may represent the most ambitious dmrg calculations to date . </S>",
    "<S> truncation errors were approximately @xmath26 , which we consider to be at the limits of acceptability . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , the calculations sometimes got stuck in metastable hole configurations , in cases where two or more states had a very close separation in energy but corresponded to completely different hole configurations . in these cases </S>",
    "<S> it was necessary to perform several calculations , with the holes initially localized in different configurations , using the total energy to choose between different runs . </S>",
    "<S> ( in contrast , the spin configuration equilibrated more readily . ) nevertheless , the domain wall configurations shown here were robust as long as the initial hole configurations were reasonably close to the final configurations displayed . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , three of the most robust features emerging from a variety of runs were that the domain walls are bond centered , composed of @xmath3   pairs , with @xmath4 phase shifted antiferromagnetic regions separating the walls .    </S>",
    "<S> figure 1(b ) shows the charge and spin density in the ground state of the @xmath23 system with @xmath27 and 8 holes , corresponding to a filling @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> periodic boundary conditions were used in the @xmath28-direction , and open boundary conditions in the @xmath29-direction . along the left and right edges of the system a small staggered magnetic field of @xmath30 was applied . </S>",
    "<S> the boundary conditions and the edge staggered field serve to orient and pin the domain walls in the configuration shown . in an ltt phase , the increased cu - o bond length in one direction would act to orient the domain walls through an anisotropic hopping and exchange , @xmath31 and @xmath32 , with @xmath33 , but for simplicity we have used @xmath34 throughout . the staggered edge field further acts to pick a direction for the spin order , which allows direct measurement of the spin configurations and reduces truncation errors in the dmrg calculation . </S>",
    "<S> the charge density in the @xmath29-direction shows a strong modulation with period 4@xmath22 , and the filling of the wall is consistent with that shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 1(a ) . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , a small charge density modulation , also with period of 4@xmath22 , is present in the @xmath28 direction@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this modulation is pinned in the @xmath28 direction despite periodic boundary conditions by the truncation errors in the calculation . </S>",
    "<S> we can not determine whether an exact calculation of the two - dimensional @xmath0-@xmath1 lattice would have small pinned charge density modulations along the walls , but it seems clear that the system is near a cdw instability , with period 4@xmath22 , along the walls . </S>",
    "<S> the spin response @xmath35 is also shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 1(b ) and corresponds to antiferromagnetic correlations which have a @xmath4 phase shift across the bond domain wall . </S>",
    "<S> this @xmath4 phase shift was purely the result of the simulation , not enhanced in any way by boundary or initial conditions .    in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 1(c ) , the black circles show the most probable configuration of the eight holes obtained by maximizing the ground state expectation value of @xmath36 with @xmath37 the hole projection operator for the @xmath38 lattice site . </S>",
    "<S> the thickness of the lines connecting various sites denotes the strength of the exchange field @xmath39 when the holes occupy the most probable configuration , consisting of four pairs . </S>",
    "<S> note that the most probable configuration of a pair is a diagonal configuration , with a strong exchange bond running diagonally between the spins adjacent to the holes . </S>",
    "<S> this configuration is the most likely configuration of a pair in a variety of @xmath0-@xmath1clusters@xcite .    from a strong coupling point of view </S>",
    "<S> , the pairing can be viewed as arising from a compromise in which two holes locally arrange themselves so as to minimize the disturbance of the background exchange energy while at the same time lowering their kinetic energy . in the unphysical regime of @xmath40 </S>",
    "<S> , the holes would tend to be near neighbors to reduce the number of broken exchange bonds . in the physical region @xmath41 , </S>",
    "<S> the kinetic energy plays an increasingly important role so that , as shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 1(c ) , the most probable pair configuration has the holes sitting on diagonal sites with strong singlet correlations on the other diagonal . in this case </S>",
    "<S> , four of the eight one - electron hops leads to a configuration with a near - neighbor exchange bond which stabilizes the pair . as previously discussed,@xcite </S>",
    "<S> the pair structure is such that it has an overlap with the undoped antiferromagnetic background through a hole pair field operator which has @xmath3  symmetry . here </S>",
    "<S> we will see the @xmath3  structure of the pairs from the pair field response discussed below .    in the ltt phase , </S>",
    "<S> the cuo@xmath9 tilt structure causes the domain walls to be perpendicular in adjacent planes@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this gives rise to an electrostatic potential , with a period of 4@xmath22 , along the domain wall @xcite . for @xmath42 , </S>",
    "<S> this corresponds to the cdw instability of the @xmath3   domain wall and can lead to a pinning of the pairs along the wall . </S>",
    "<S> here we have modeled this effect by adding a spatially varying site potential @xmath43 on the @xmath23 lattice shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 2 . </S>",
    "<S> the sites with the extra potential @xmath44 are shown by the shaded rectangles , which also indicate the domain walls in the adjacent planes . </S>",
    "<S> the potential pins the pairs , forming a cdw lattice of pairs .    the charge and spin structure factors @xmath45 and @xmath46 for this lattice </S>",
    "<S> are also shown in fig .  2 . </S>",
    "<S> the intensity in @xmath47 at @xmath48 is expected for vertical charged domain walls . </S>",
    "<S> the intensity at @xmath49 and @xmath50 reflect the pair correlations along the domain walls . with the 90@xmath10 rotations of the domain walls from layer to layer , it is the @xmath49 peak that would be important to observe . </S>",
    "<S> the spin structure factor at @xmath51 reflects structure of the @xmath4-phase shifted antiferromagnetic regions . </S>",
    "<S> the amplitude of the third harmonic intensities is much weaker .    at dopings away from @xmath42 , the la@xmath5nd@xmath6sr@xmath7cuo@xmath8 system becomes superconducting , and the size of the tilt modulation as well as the intensity of the magnetic bragg peaks decreases@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this suggests that when the pinning is weakened , either through a reduced pinning potential or through a mismatch in the periods of the pinning potential and the cdw instability , stripe order and superconducting pairing can coexist . as a test of this , we have used a @xmath24 cluster to model a single , longer domain wall , with a variable pinning potential @xmath44 which acts on the sites in the shaded regions shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 3(a ) . </S>",
    "<S> this cluster has open boundary conditions on all sides with a staggered magnetic field of magnitude 0.05@xmath0 applied along the top and bottom edges . </S>",
    "<S> the magnetic field has a @xmath4 phase shift between the edges in order to mimic the single domain wall structure shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 2(a ) . </S>",
    "<S> in order to measure the tendency for superconductivity , a weak pair field proximity effect term @xmath52 was added to the hamiltonian . here </S>",
    "<S> @xmath53 adds a singlet electron pair to sites @xmath20 and @xmath54 . </S>",
    "<S> note that the interaction @xmath55 couples equally to @xmath3-like and extended @xmath15-wave - like pairs . </S>",
    "<S> that is , it does not distinguish whether the internal structure of the pair field has a change in sign for the singlet components in the @xmath28-direction relative to those in the @xmath29-direction . in order to include this term , rather than use the number of electrons @xmath56 as a good quantum number to break up the hilbert space , @xmath56 modulo 2 was used . </S>",
    "<S> ( total @xmath57 was conserved in the usual fashion . ) </S>",
    "<S> we then measured the strength of the pair fields in the ground state in both the @xmath29 and @xmath28 directions , @xmath58 and @xmath59 for all sites @xmath20 . </S>",
    "<S> the charge and spin structure of the @xmath24 cluster with 8 holes is shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 3(a ) for @xmath60 . in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 3(b ) , the pair field strength is shown by the width of the lines , and the sign of the field is indicated by the type of line , dashed or solid . </S>",
    "<S> a relative sign difference between the @xmath29 and @xmath28 directions indicates @xmath3  pairing . in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 3(b ) we see a significant @xmath3  pair response coexisting with a modest charge density wave . in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 3(c ) , we show the pair field @xmath61 averaged over all the @xmath28-bonds in the middle four rungs as a function of @xmath44 . </S>",
    "<S> the suppression of pairing by the cdw is evident . </S>",
    "<S> we expect that a larger , two dimensional array of domain walls would show a more enhanced response versus @xmath44 .    </S>",
    "<S> these calculations show that holes doped into a @xmath0-@xmath1  lattice can form domain walls of pairs . for a filling @xmath2 , these walls have an average filling of one hole per two domain wall unit cells , and there is a tendency for the pairs to form a pinned cdw structure . </S>",
    "<S> if the pinning is weakened , the pairs fluctuate , developing phase coherence , and @xmath3   superconducting correlations appear . </S>",
    "<S> the idea that the domain walls are made up of pairs provides a natural explanation of the special filling @xmath2 and the intimate relationship between the stripes and superconductivity . </S>",
    "<S> the pairs give rise to a bond centered charge density periodicity of @xmath62 along a wall which should give a bragg peak at @xmath49 . </S>",
    "<S> other evidence of the pair structure of the domain wall should be seen in nmr measurements .    </S>",
    "<S> the structure we have discussed differs from the one - electron mean field domain walls found in hartree - fock@xcite and gutzwiller variational calculations@xcite in both its filling and its relationship to pairing . </S>",
    "<S> it also differs from the one - dimensional large @xmath63 hubbard model of a domain wall recently discussed by nayak and wilczek@xcite . at @xmath27 , </S>",
    "<S> our system is well away from the phase separation regime , and we have no long - range intraplanar coulomb interaction as in the frustrated phase separation domain wall model of kivelson and emery@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the singlet stripe phases discussed by tsunetsugu@xcite and the competing cdw - pairing phases in the 2- and 4-leg ladder systems recently discussed@xcite have some of the features found in this present study . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , they have the interplay of @xmath3  superconducting pairing and charge density wave order . </S>",
    "<S> clearly , it will be important to understand if this is the behavior that underlies the structure of the domain walls in la@xmath5nd@xmath6sr@xmath7cuo@xmath8 . </S>"
