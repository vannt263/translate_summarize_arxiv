    "on a vicinal face , which consists of an equidistant train of straight steps , the steps show two types of instability .",
    "one is step bunching , which is the instability of step distance , and the other is step wandering , which is the instability along steps .",
    "these instabilities are often observed during growth and melting .    during solution growth ,",
    "step wandering is caused by the flow in a solution . according to a linear stability analysis  @xcite",
    ", step wandering is induced by a step - up flow , in agreement with experimental results  @xcite .",
    "the flow in a solution also causes step bunching .",
    "chernov and coworkers  @xcite assumed that the step density is sufficiently high that the vicinal face can be treated as a linear sink of atoms , and they studied the step bunching caused by the flow in a solution .",
    "linear stability analyses and numerical studies  @xcite have shown that a growing vicinal face is unstable in the case of a long - wavelength fluctuation owing to a step - down flow .",
    "the time evolution of an unstable vicinal face was studied by bredikhin and malshakova  @xcite . according to numerical simulations based on a nonlinear equation",
    ", a quasi - regular array of high step density , which is similar to that of bunches observed in experiments  @xcite , is formed on an unstabilized vicinal face .    in previous studies",
    "@xcite , the modulation of step density during step bunching was investigated but the motion of each step has not been sufficiently studied .",
    "recently , we made a simple discrete model and , by carrying out a monte carlo simulation  @xcite , studied the motion of each step during bunching .",
    "in the model , we assumed that the steps are straight and we expressed the steps as points on a one - dimensional vicinal face .",
    "to represent the diffusion field in a solution , we introduced a square lattice and treated the diffusion in a solution as the hopping of atoms on the lattice . in the paper  @xcite , we carried out a monte carlo simulation and showed that the vicinal face is unstable in the case of a long - wavelength fluctuation .",
    "the width of fluctuation of the step distance , @xmath4 , increases as @xmath0 with @xmath5 . in the simulation",
    ", we used low flow rates . if the flow rate is changed , the time evolution of the fluctuation of step distance and the behavior of steps during bunching may be changed .    in this paper",
    ", we carry out monte carlo simulations with a flow in a solution whose flow rate is higher than that in previous paper  @xcite and study how the time evolution of bunching changes . in  [ sec : mc ] , we introduce our simplified model . in  [ sec : results ] , we report the results of monte carlo simulations .",
    "the width of the fluctuation of step distance increases with time in the initial stage and then becomes saturated .",
    "the growth law of the width of the fluctuation and the dependence of the saturated width on supersaturation are studied . in  [ sec : summary ] , we summarize the results and give a brief discussion .",
    "using a very simplified model ( fig .  [",
    "fig : vicinal face ] ) we carry out monte carlo simulations . in the model , a square lattice in a solution is considered .",
    "the diffusion of atoms in a solution is expressed as hopping on the lattice sites .",
    "the height of steps is neglected , a vicinal face is expressed as a line , and steps are treated as points on the line .",
    "the @xmath6-direction is the step - down direction and @xmath7 is the altitude of the vicinal face .        in our model ,",
    "the active atoms are solid atoms forming steps and atoms in solution . in each monte carlo trial",
    ", we randomly choose one active atom .",
    "when an atom in a solution is chosen , a diffusion trial is carried out .",
    "the flow in a solution is expressed as the asymmetry of the diffusion probability  @xcite . when a flow is prarallel to the @xmath6-direction , an atom at site @xmath8 moves to site @xmath9 with probability @xmath10 and to the site @xmath11 with probability , @xmath12 .",
    "the parameter @xmath13 represents the effect of the flow in the solution . with increasing parameter @xmath13 , the effect of the flow increases . the time is increased after each diffusion trial . in order",
    "that the diffusion coefficient @xmath14 is equal to @xmath15 , the increment of the time after each diffusion trial is given by @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is the number of atoms in the solution .    to take account of the viscosity in the solution",
    ", we assume that @xmath13 is proportional to the altitude from the vicinal face . when the @xmath18-coordinate is given by @xmath19 , @xmath13 is expressed as @xmath20 .",
    "thus , near the vicinal face , the effect of the flow in the diffusion trial vanishes .",
    "the sign of @xmath21 shows the direction of the flow .",
    "when @xmath21 is positive , the flow is in the step - down direction , and the flow is in the step - up direction for negative @xmath13 . if the altitude is sufficiently high that @xmath22(@xmath23 ) , we set the hopping probabilities @xmath24 and @xmath25 to be @xmath26 and @xmath27 , respectively . in general , we should consider a flow obeys that boundary - layer theory .",
    "however , according to the blasius s solution , the velocity of a smooth flow near a flat surface is proportional to the distance from the surface .",
    "thus , if the effect of the flow far from the surface is neglected , our model is valid as a simplified model .",
    "the solidification probability @xmath24 and the melting probability @xmath25 are given by  @xcite @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the chemical potential gain upon solidification .",
    "a solidification trial is carried out after a diffusion trial . if the position of the atom is @xmath30 and that of the step is @xmath31 , the step advances to @xmath32 and the atom in the solution vanishes after solidification ( fig .",
    "[ fig : solidification ] ) .",
    "a melting trial is carried out when the chosen active atom is an atom forming a step .",
    "if the melting of a step atom occurs at a step edge @xmath33 , the step recedes to @xmath34 and an atom is expelled to site @xmath35 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : melting ] ) . in our algorithm , only one atom can occupy a site . then , if site @xmath35 is already occupied by an atom , the melting trial is not carried out ( fig .  [",
    "fig : melting_non ] ) .",
    "we assume that the kinetic coefficient at steps is sufficiently large that the detailed balance stands up at step positions .",
    "namely , the concentration of atom is in equilibrium at steps .",
    "the equilibrium concentration in a solution , @xmath36 , satisfies @xmath37 from eq .",
    "( [ eq : detail valance ] ) , the equilibrium adatom density is given by  @xcite @xmath38 in our model , when the altitude is larger than the critical value @xmath39 , the concentration of atoms becomes a constant value @xmath40 .",
    "if @xmath40 is higher than @xmath41 , solidification frequently occurs and the steps advance . in the opposite case",
    ", melting occurs more frequently than solidification and the steps recede .",
    "we previously studied the motion of steps during step bunching using the same model  @xcite . in the previous paper",
    ", we showed that a step - up flow stabilizes the vicinal face and that the step bunching occurs with a step - down flow .",

    ", we studied the motion of steps with low flow rates . in an early stage of simulation",
    ", a vicinal face seems to be unstable for fluctuations with a long wavelength .",
    "the step density gradually modulates and small bunches are formed .",
