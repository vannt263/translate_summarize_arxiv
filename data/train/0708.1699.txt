    "magnetic reconnection is an important physical process , which serves as one of the possible ways of converting energy stored in the magnetic field into heat and non - thermal , accelerated , motion of plasma particles .",
    "this process operates virtually in all extra - galactic , stellar , solar , space and laboratory plasmas with varied degree of importance . for example , in solar and stellar flares magnetic reconnection plays a key role .",
    "in addition , it can be one of the main contributing factors to solar coronal heating problem amongst other mechanisms such as wave dissipation .",
    "as far as plasma heating is concerned , in the collisional regime , be it tokamak plasma or solar corona ( which perhaps is better described as a collisionless medium ) , spitzer resistivity is @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the electron temperature .",
    "thus , in becoming hotter , plasma essentially starts to behave as a superconductor , i.e. further heating ( increase in temperature ) is impeded due to decrease of the resistive properties . in this context",
    ", a direct conversion of magnetic energy into heat via reconnection seems rather attractive .",
    "as far as the particle acceleration is concerned , 50 - 80 % of the energy released during solar flares is converted into the energy of accelerated particles .",
    "thus , knowledge of the details of particle acceleration via magnetic reconnection ( which is deemed as a major mechanism operating solar and stellar flares ) is also important .",
    "the main aspects of the reconnection process can be classified as whether it is resistive ( collisional ) or collisionless ; spontaneous or forced ; and/or steady or time - dependent .",
    "each of these aspects have been studied extensively with varied level of progress .",
    "for example , both steady and time - dependent , _ resistive _ reconnection processes are very well studied [ see e.g. ref.@xcite and references therein ] , while it is only recently some progress has been made in the study of _ collisionless _ reconnection [ see e.g. ref.@xcite and references therein ] .",
    "this can be explained by the fact that resistive reconnection is simpler in its nature . changing structure ( connectivity ) of magnetic field lines , which essentially is the reconnection , requires some mechanism ( dissipation ) to break the frozen - in condition . in the case of resistive reconnection",
    "it is @xmath4 term .",
    "in fact , rate at which reconnection proceeds is given by an inflow velocity into the dissipation region @xmath5 , where @xmath6 and @xmath7 are width and length of the region , and @xmath8 is alfvn speed . in the simplest resistive , steady model of sweet - parker @xmath9 and @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is the macroscopic system size . in the collisionless regime however , other terms in the ohm s law , such as electron inertia term , hall term and electron pressure tensor become far more important than the usual @xmath4 term on which resistive reconnection models rely . each of these terms has an associated spatial scale with them , i.e. scale at which they start to play a dominant role .",
    "for example , electron inertia term is associated with the electron skin depth @xmath12 , hall term is with the ion skin depth @xmath13 , while electron pressure tensor is with ion larmor radius [ see e.g. p. 87 in ref.@xcite or p. 42 in ref.@xcite ] .",
    "one of the main outcomes of recent research in collisionless reconnection can be summarised by gem @xcite and newton @xcite reconnection challenges .",
    "these considered the same physical system : harris - type equilibrium with anti - parallel magnetic field , relevant to geomagnetic tail application , with finite initial magnetic perturbations in the case of gem challenge and time - transient inhomogeneous , driven inflow of magnetic flux in the case of newton challenge .",
    "the novelty of the approach was to use different numerical codes [ mhd , hall mhd , hybrid and particle - in - cell ( pic ) ] , in order to pin - point essential physical mechanism that facilitates the reconnection .",
    "these works established that as long as dispersive whistler waves are included ( these can only appear if one allows for the different dynamics for electrons and ions ) , the rate at which reconnection proceeds does not change , irrespective of which term breaks the frozen - in condition .",
    "yet another interesting analytical result corroborated by the numerical simulations is that in 2d steady reconnection , petschek reconnection rate functional form remains the same when the hall term is included ( in the hall mhd model ) , but what changes is the length from the x - point to the start of slow mode shocks @xcite . in mhd , this length is the half width of the resistive region , @xmath14 , but when hall term is included the length is replaced by @xmath15 @xcite .",
    "this important result essentially provides an analytical scaling for the collisionless reconnection ( when @xmath16 is zero ) for such physical system .",
    "thus , future kinetic studies that use pic simulation need to corroborate it .",
    "ref.@xcite already tested this scaling law via mhd and hall mhd simulation .",
    "importance of the electron inertia in the x - point with finite out - of - plane guide magnetic field has been investigated in ref.@xcite .",
    "particularly noteworthy result was that when the normalised collisionless electron skin depth [ @xmath17 exceeds the dimensionless resistive length scale ( @xmath18 ) , where @xmath19 is the lindquist number , the energy in a shear alfvn wave approaching an x - point is rapidly transformed into plasma kinetic energy and heat . assuming solar coronal parameters , the normalised electron skin depth is @xmath20 ( assuming @xmath21 mm and @xmath22 m ) , while dimensionless resistive length scale is @xmath23 ( in the corona typically @xmath24 ) .",
    "thus , the proposed in @xcite may well be effective .",
    "previous works on particle acceleration mostly focused on test - particle type calculations of the particle trajectories in different 2d @xcite or more recently 3d @xcite magnetic reconnection configurations . in such approach feedback on reconnection electromagnetic ( em ) fields from motion ( spatial redistribution ) of charged particles",
    "is ignored .",
    "our approach does not suffer from this drawback , as we use fully electromagnetic , relativistic pic numerical code in which em fields are calculated at each step from the spatial distribution of the charges .    according to ref.@xcite",
    ", resistive time - dependent reconnection other than well known tearing mode can be split into two main classes : x - type collapse , which was first considered by ref.@xcite ( a decade before tearing mode was discovered ) and petschek - type theory developed by ref.@xcite .",
    "previous work on x - point collapse is well described in chapter 7.1 of ref.@xcite .",
    "also see more recent work on the subject @xcite .",
    "a good example of combination of analytical and numerical work on magnetic reconnection at stressed x - type neutral points can be found in ref.@xcite .",
    "boundary conditions used in ref.@xcite , where such that they did not allow for flux or mass flow through the boundary .",
    "the studies with closed boundaries are physically justified by being isolated systems , whereas some of those with open boundaries lead to misleading results : for example , in an open system a potential x - point can collapse due to inflow of energy from outside",
    ".    initial analytical work on this topic considered unbounded self - similar solutions .",
    "these indicated that @xmath25 , the out - of - plane electric field at the magnetic null , which is the measure of reconnection rate , tends to infinity as @xmath26 [ e.g. fig.(7.3 ) from ref.@xcite ] .",
    "the main outcomes of the previous , stressed x - point collapse in the resistive mhd ( in the case of low - resistivity and low - beta ) can be summarised as following :    \\(i ) the x - point collapse is different depending whether initial stressing is weak or strong . in the weak case the average reconnection rate scale as @xmath27 , where @xmath28 is the dimensionless resistivity [ @xmath29 , while strong case it is independent of @xmath30 .",
    "\\(ii ) there is an issue related to efficiency of the process : ref.@xcite showed that for fast reconnection to occur @xmath31 , otherwise pressure in the current sheet chokes off the collapse process . for solar coronal conditions ,",
    "@xmath32 this requires @xmath33 , which is too low to match the observed values circa @xmath34 .",
    "however , this shortcoming seems to be alleviated by inclusion of non - linear effects , i.e. case of strong perturbations ( strong stressing ) @xcite . if the compression is sufficiently large , magnetic pressure of the imploding wave expels trapped gas in the current sheet from its ends , allowing it to thin and faster reconnection to occur .",
    "motivation of the present study is five - fold :    \\(i ) naturally , different boundary and initial conditions produce different scaling of reconnection rate e.g. with resistivity ( in the case of resistive reconnection ) . to our knowledge x - type collapse by a uniform stress ( compression ) along one of the axis ,",
    "as described in chapter 2.1 in ref.@xcite , has not been investigated numerically neither in the case of resistive ( mhd ) reconnection , nor in the collisionless regime ;    \\(ii ) this type of stress ( compression ) is likely to occur in the framework of a flare model ( see details below ) .",
    "\\(iii ) to our knowledge the most of previous collisionless reconnection studies considered anti - parallel , harris type magnetic field configuration , which is more relevant to earth magneto - tail application . for solar and stellar flares x - type configuration is more relevant .",
    "\\(iv ) some of the models of coronal mass ejections @xcite which use motion of photospheric footpoints as a driver , end up with situation physically similar to stressed x - point collapse ( strictly speaking y - points occur there ) .",
    "\\(v ) we aimed to investigate properties of the accelerated particles in the current using self - consistent electromagnetic fields , as a further extension of the test - particle type approach .",
    "[ fig : model ] represents magnetic field line geometry considered in this paper . in order to study",
    "stressed magnetic reconnection , we consider a magnetic x - point collapse which may naturally occur during solar flares [ see sketch in fig .",
    "[ fig : model](a ) ] .",
    "such stressed x - point may occur e.g. if photospheric footpoints of the coronal loops move towards each other ( e.g. pushed by convective motions ) or some compression from the sides in the corona forces them to do so .",
    "we study dynamics of such stressed x - point by means of kinetic , 2.5d , fully electromagnetic , relativistic particle - in - cell numerical code .",
    "we focus attention on the local region inside the dashed box which is is the region that our study tries to mimic by uniform stress in one direction [ see fig .  [",
    "fig : model](c ) ] . if there is no stress from the sides the considered magnetic configuration is stable [ fig .",
    "[ fig : model](b ) ] . interestingly , ref.@xcite investigated what happens when a fast magnetosonic shock wave associated with a coronal mass ejection collides obliquely with a coronal streamer with a stable current sheet .",
    "their set up is somewhat analogous to ours , but much more violent , as we only consider x - point compression , while they blasted it with a alfvn mach 6 shock .",
    "the initial magnetic field configurations used are @xmath35 where @xmath36 is magnetic field intensity at the distance @xmath11 from the x - point for @xmath37 , @xmath11 is the global external length - scale of reconnection , and @xmath38 is the stress parameter [ see chapter 2.1 in ref.@xcite ] .",
    "in addition , the uniform current is imposed at @xmath39 in the @xmath40-direction , @xmath41 this current appears because of the stress imposed on magnetic field lines .",
    "the simulation code used here is 2.5d relativistic and fully electromagnetic pic code , modified from the 3d tristan code @xcite . in this code , both the electron and ion dynamics are described as particles .",
    "equation of motion for each particle is solved using self consistent electromagnetic fields , @xmath42 @xmath43 @xmath44 @xmath45 where @xmath46 , @xmath47 , @xmath48 , @xmath49 and @xmath50 are electric and magnetic fields , current density , particle velocity and position , respectively .",

    "in addition to above eqs .",
    "( [ eq_motion])([eq_faraday ] ) , @xmath59 and @xmath60 must be satisfied initially ( @xmath61 is charge density , which is taken as 0 ) .",

    "we started by testing our code , reproducing published gem challenge results @xcite .",
    "[ fig : gem ] shows time evolution of the reconnected magnetic flux difference between and o and x - lines .",
    "open squares correspond to the published gem challenge values .",
    "we gather from this graph that match between our simulation results and that of gem challenge @xcite is good . we could also reproduce other figures from refs.@xcite , thus we were reasonably confident to start a new x - point collapse simulation , which is the subject of the present paper .",
    "the length of the system in two dimensions is @xmath62 ( this is excluding , so called , ghost cells needed for updating the boundary conditions ) , where @xmath63 is the simulation grid size corresponding to electron debye length , @xmath64 ( @xmath65 is electron thermal velocity and @xmath66 is electron plasma frequency ) .",
    "the global external length - scale of reconnection is set @xmath67 .",
    "number density is fixed at @xmath68 electron - ion pairs per cell .",
    "both electrons and ions are uniformly distributed throughout the system , hence total number is @xmath69 million pairs .",
    "zero - gradient boundary conditions are imposed both on the electric and magnetic fields in @xmath70- and @xmath71-directions .",
    "also , tangential component of electric field was forced to zero , while normal component of magnetic field was kept constant , both at the boundary .",
    "this ensures that there is no magnetic flux through the simulation boundary , i.e. the system is isolated and @xmath72 at every time step .",
    "the latter sum is the magnetic flux on the boundary . reflecting boundary conditions are imposed on particles in both the @xmath70- and @xmath71-directions .",
    "the latter ensures there is no mass flow across the boundary .",
    "the simulation time step is @xmath73 .",
    "ion to electron mass ratio is @xmath74 .",
    "electron thermal velocity to speed of light ratio is @xmath75 .",
    "electron and ion skin depths are @xmath76 and @xmath77 , respectively . electron cyclotron frequency to plasma frequency ratio is @xmath78 for magnetic field intensity , @xmath79 .",
    "the latter ratio is indeed close to unity in the solar corona , while it is much bigger than unity in the earth magnetosphere .",
    "electron and ion larmor radii are @xmath80 and @xmath81 , where @xmath82 is the ion thermal velocity .",
    "the temperatures of ions and electrons are the same , @xmath83 . at the boundary the plasma @xmath84 and alfvn velocity , @xmath85 .",
    "naturally these vary across the simulation box as the background magnetic field is a function of @xmath70 and @xmath71 .    in what follows , for the visualisation purposes",
    ", all spatial coordinates will be normalised by electron skin depth @xmath86 , while time is normalised by the inverse of plasma electron frequency @xmath87 .",
    "we investigated three x - point collapse cases with different stress parameters , @xmath88 ( stable ) , @xmath89 ( weakly stressed ) and @xmath90 ( strongly stressed ) . for @xmath88",
    ", we confirmed that the system is stable at least for @xmath91 , and no magnetic reconnection takes place .",
    "ref.@xcite has shown that when perturbations ( exerted stress on an x - point ) are small @xmath92 then the ( average ) reconnection rate scales as @xmath27 , while if they are large @xmath93 then the reconnection rate is independent of @xmath30 .",
    "this difference in behaviour points to a different relative importance of the physical mechanisms in action .",
    "the two different ( weakly and strongly compressed ) cases studied in this paper attempt the same approach as in ref.@xcite .",
    "however , one should realise that we use vastly different physical description .",
    "ref.@xcite uses resistive mhd , while our pic ( fully kinetic ) approach is collisionless , and , in turn , in our case @xmath94 .",
    "however , it has been observed before , that often scattering of plasma particles from the magnetic field lines , plays effective role of collisions .",
    "e.g. refs.@xcite have shown that the alfvn wave dissipation in the collisionless case ( using the same pic , kinetic code ) follows scaling law which is the same as in resistive mhd case @xcite . at the same time , this is not to say that we are confident that the effective particle scattering off the magnetic fields , which mimics resistive ( collisional ) effects , _ is _ the mechanism that breaks down the frozen - in condition here .",
    "the issue of which term in the generalised ohm s law is responsible for the reconnection in the collisionless stressed x - point collapse will be studied separately .",
    "it should be noted that @xmath38 , the measure of stress , is essentially the aspect ratio of the compression , i.e. since the limiting magnetic field lines are given by @xmath96 , @xmath97 means 1.2 - 1.0=0.2 i.e. 20% compression of the x - point in @xmath70-direction .",
    "similarly , @xmath98 case represents 124% compression , i.e. 1.24 times stressed .",
    "also , because change in @xmath38 means change of strength of the magnetic field on the boundary , the external alfvn speed also changes .",
    "e.g. we fixed alfvn velocity , @xmath85 for @xmath99 , but for @xmath100 , @xmath101 .",

    "because usually pic simulation suffers for large ( thermal ) noise especially towards high energy ends of the particle distribution function , a boxcar average scheme with width @xmath107 mesh points was applied for smoothing the line - data .",

    "we gather from this figure that for the case of @xmath99 no @xmath112 is generated , as such configuration is stable and no x - point collapse or reconnection occurs ( dotted line ) . on contrary , for the case of @xmath97 we see that the reconnection rate peaks at about 0.11 at @xmath108 which is the same as @xmath113 . here",

    "as expected @xmath99 case stays current free throughout the simulation , while @xmath97 produces a peak current of @xmath124 and then subsequently decays off .",
    "it should be noted that we have performed one additional numerical run with @xmath97 , but without imposing initial @xmath125 current prescribed by eq.(2 ) .",
    "this is because e.g. one might expect that in a x - point above the arcade of loops in the solar corona , only compression ( stress ) of the magnetic field from the two sides is likely .",

    "[ fig : jz_a224 ] panels ( a ) and ( b ) show spatial distribution of the @xmath120 current at the peak of the reconnection @xmath156 , and after the current sheet decayed , @xmath163 , [ the first bounce ",
    "see fig .",
    "[ fig : timed_ezjz_a224 ] ] . the noticeable difference from panels ( c ) and ( d ) in fig .",
    "[ fig : jz_a120 ] is that now current sheet becomes longer and thinner [ the same conclusion reached in ref.@xcite , in that large perturbations ( strong compression ) yields current sheet thinning and onset of more efficient reconnection ] . as in the weakly stressed case",
    ", we also did the following calculation : using data from fig .",
    "[ fig : jz_a224](a ) ( peak current time snapshot ) the width and length of current sheet was estimated by looking at half - width of the @xmath139 and @xmath140 peak ( in both @xmath70 and @xmath71-directions ) .",
    "the result is width , @xmath164 , and length , @xmath165 the ratio of the two gives the inflow mach number @xmath166 .",
    "this is 125 times smaller that peak reconnection rate of 2.5 from fig .",
    "[ fig : timed_ezjz_a224](a ) and 25 time smaller than average reconnection rate of 0.5 from the same figure .",
    "this discrepancy can only be attributed to the fact that formula @xmath167 only applies to the steady reconnection process . in the case of @xmath97",
    "the reconnection process was relatively steady thus the latter formula proved a good match , but for @xmath98 the process is too dynamic and thus @xmath143 as a measure of reconnection fails .",
    "[ fig : jz_a224 ] panels ( c ) and ( d ) again show familiar quadruple out - of - plane magnetic field structure , but now it is much more elongated .",
    "the panels ( e ) and ( f ) where we trace individual magnetic field lines at two different times provide another proof that the reconnection takes places and that the current sheet is now much longer and thinner .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : fl_a224 ] is an analog of fig .",
    "[ fig : fl_a120 ] but for @xmath98 .",
    "noteworthy difference from the weak case is that the plasma inflow into the current sheet is perpendicular to it , with the electron outflow speeds reaching external alfvn mach number of @xmath168 [ note arrow length in fig .",
    "[ fig : fl_a224](a ) ] , and ions again being about four times slower than electrons .",
    "mind that now @xmath104 .",
    "[ fig : ed_a224 ] shows the local electron energy distribution function in the current sheet at @xmath128 ( dashed curve ) and @xmath149 ( solid curve ) for @xmath103 .",
    "note that the dashed curves ( corresponding to @xmath39 ) in fig .",
    "[ fig : ed_a120 ] and fig .",
    "[ fig : ed_a224 ] are different .",
    "this is due to the fact that different @xmath38 s , mean different initial @xmath125 current [ see eq.(2 ) ] , which contribute to the calculation of the distribution function .",
    "we performed numerical fit to the high energy part of the distribution function ( @xmath169 mev ) and found that the electron distribution has the power law index of -5.5 which is quite close to the observed power law range of -4.8 and -5.3 @xcite .",
    "note that now attained energies are much higher @xmath170 mev ( at the high end of the spectrum ) .",
    "again , we note that values quoted in kev and mev should be taken with caution [ see discussion of fig .",
    "[ fig : ed_a120 ] above ] .",
    "we now try to estimate the efficiently of the x - point collapse by looking at the energetics of the process . in particular in fig .",
    "[ fig : e_mag ] we plot the magnetic energy , @xmath171 , for two cases @xmath97 ( solid line ) and @xmath98 ( dashed line ) . the normalisation in each case is @xmath172 .",
    "note that the latter is different in the both cases because different stress means different initial magnetic field .",
    "we gather from this graph that in the case of weak stress , 2% of the initial magnetic energy ( which is a dominant part of the total energy because our plasma beta is 0.02 ) is converted into heat and energy of super - thermal ( accelerated ) particles . in the case of large perturbations ( strong compression ) 20 % in the initial magnetic energy is converted into heating and particle acceleration .",
    "we studied magnetic reconnection during collisionless , stressed , x - point collapse using kinetic , 2.5d , fully electromagnetic , relativistic particle - in - cell numerical code .",
    "we investigated two cases of weakly and strongly stressed x - point . here by weakly and strongly we mean 20 % and 124 % unidirectional spatial compression of the x - point , respectively .",
    "the reconnection rate , defined as the out - of - plane electric field in the magnetic null normalised by the product of external magnetic field and alfvn speeds , peaks at 0.11 ( at 0.85 alfvn times ) , with its average over 1.25 alfvn times being 0.04 .",
    "we found that during the peak of the reconnection , electron inflow into the current sheet is mostly concentrated along the separatrices until they deflect from the current sheet on the scale of electron skin depth , with the electron outflow speeds being of the order of the external alfvn speed .",
    "ion inflow starts to deflect from the current sheet on the ion skin depth scale with the outflow speeds about four times smaller than that of electrons .",
    "electron energy distribution in the current sheet , at the high energy end of the spectrum , shows a power law distribution with the index which varies in time , attaining a maximal value of -4.1 at the final simulation time step ( this corresponds to 1.25 alfvn times ) .",
    "the obtained results in the strongly stressed case show that the magnetic reconnection peak occurs about 3.4 times faster ( at 0.25 alfvn times ) and is more efficient .",
    "the peak reconnection rate now attains value 2.5 ( at 0.25 alfvn times ) , with the average reconnection rate over 1.25 alfvn times being 0.5 .",
    "plasma inflow into the current sheet is perpendicular to it , with the electron outflow seeds reaching 1.4 alfvn external mach number and ions again being about four times slower than electrons .",
    "the power law energy spectrum for the electrons in the current sheet attains now a steeper index of -5.5 .",
    "this is close to the typical observed power law indexes in the vicinity of x - type region in the earth s magneto - tail @xcite .",
    "the reconnection rate versus time figures in both cases indicate that the reconnection has bursty , time - transient behaviour . in the considered",
    "two cases , 2% ( in weakly stressed ) and 20% ( in strongly stressed ) of the initial magnetic energy is converted into heat and energy of accelerated particles , respectively , both within about one alfvn time .",
    "this is somewhat similar to the previous resistive mhd analog @xcite of the present study , in that small perturbation ( weak stress ) initiates x - point collapse , but then reconnection process is choked off by the gas pressure . at present , it is unclear , however , whether we seem to observe similar behaviour in our simulation .",
    "after all , e.g. petschek mechanism reconnection can be choked off by a different ( other than pressure ) mechanism [ when the diffusion - region inflow magnetic field gets too small @xcite ] .",
    "we also found that in the both cases , during the peak of the reconnection , the quadruple out - of - plane magnetic field is generated .",
    "this most is likely to suggest that hall regime of the reconnection takes place @xcite .",
    "in addition to the fundamental interest of converting magnetic energy into heat and the energy of accelerated particles , these results are significant for e.g. solar coronal heating problem .",
    "it has been estimated that even if only 2% of the magnetic energy in the solar corona is converted into heat , the coronal heating problem would be solved .",
    "also , it is known that the typical resistive diffusion time in the corona is @xmath173 alfvn times ( @xmath174 years ) , while the time - transient phenomena such as flares ( one of the possible candidates of coronal heating ) occur on time scales of 10  100 alfvn times .",
    "our results for the strongly stressed case suggest that 20 % of initial magnetic energy can be released in just 1 alfvn time . on one hand",
    ", one has to realise , that the obtained results are for an x - point configuration , and naturally , the bulk of solar corona is not made of solely of x - points .",
    "on the other hand , it is also known that heating of the active regions would provide circa 82 % of the coronal heating budget @xcite . in turn , given the fact that x - points are common occurrence in the active regions , our results seem to be of importance for solving the coronal heating problem .",
    "it important to stress that the obtained main result of the 20% conversion of the initial magnetic energy into heat and energy of super - thermal particles , within about one alfvn time , is obtained in the collisionless regime , thus this result does not suffer from any uncertainty in the anomalous resistivity as in the case of resistive mhd reconnection .",
