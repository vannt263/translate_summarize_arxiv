    "a compact ( @xmath0 ) x - ray nebula around the vela pulsar was first detected in soft x - rays by harnden et al .",
    "( 1985 ) with the _ einstein _ high resolution imager ( hri ) .",
    "these authors suggested that it is a pulsar - wind nebula ( pwn ) powered by relativistic particles ejected by the pulsar .",
    "the soft x - ray emission from the vela x - ray nebula was further studied with _ rosat _ ( gelman , finley & zimmerman 1993 ; markwardt & gelman 1998 , and references therein ) . based on its `` kidney - bean '' shape ,",
    "markwardt & gelman ( 1998 ) proposed an interpretation in terms of a bow - shock produced by the supersonic motion of the pulsar through the ambient medium .",
    "the vela pulsar and its pwn have been later observed with both the high resolution camera ( hrc ) and the advanced ccd imaging spectrometer ( acis ) on board the _ chandra _ x - ray observatory ( pavlov et al.2000 , 2001a , b , 2003 ; helfand , gotthelf , & halpern 2001 ; kargaltsev et al .",
    "thanks to the excellent angular resolution of _ chandra _ , the morphology of the pwn was resolved in a complex structure resembling that of the crab pwn .",
    "such a structure can not be explained by a simple bow - shock model",
    ". the brighter part of the pwn , with a size of about @xmath1 , shows an approximately axisymmetric structure , with two arcs , a jet , and a counter - jet , embedded into an extended diffuse emission .",
    "the axis of symmetry , which can be associated with the pulsar rotational axis ( pavlov et al .",
    "2000 ) , coincides , within the errors , with the direction of the pulsar s proper motion ( p.a .",
    "= 301 e.g. , caraveo et al .",
    "2001a ) .",
    "the overall spectrum of the pwn can be described by a power law with an average spectral ( energy ) index @xmath2 ( see kargaltsev et al .",
    "2002 for details ) , which can be interpreted as synchrotron emission of relativistic electrons and/or positrons .",
    "the same electron distributions should emit optical and radio synchrotron radiation , provided that the electron power - law spectrum extends down to sufficiently low energies , @xmath3 gev ( where @xmath4 hz is the radiation frequency , and @xmath5 g is the magnetic field ) , and synchrotron self - absorption plays no role .    indeed ,",
    "highly polarized ( @xmath6% at 5.2 ghz ) extended radio emission has been recently detected around the vela pulsar ( lewis et al .",
    "2002 ; dodson et al .",
    "2003 ) , covering a region @xmath7 times larger than the x - ray pwn , as observed in the case of the crab .",
    "most of the diffuse radio emission comes from two lobes ( see figs .",
    "24 in dodson et al .  2003 )  the southeast lobe of an area of 18 arcmin@xmath8 ( @xmath9 mjy at 5.2 ghz ) and a brighter northeast lobe of an area of 5.3 arcmin@xmath8 ( @xmath10 mjy at 5.2 ghz ) .",
    "search for radio emission from the x - ray - bright compact nebula was hampered by the brightness of the pulsar .",
    "although some emission was detected ( e.g , about 30 mjy at @xmath11 ghz , in a 0.73 arcmin@xmath8 area around the pulsar ) , it can well be an unsubtracted pulsar contribution and should be considered as an upper limit on the compact pwn emission .",
    "one could expect to see optical nebula around the vela pulsar .",
    "indeed , optical pwne have been observed in several other young pulsars .",
    "the most famous example is the crab pwn ( see , e.g. , hester et al .",
    "2002 , and references therein ) which exhibits a complex structure featuring bright knots and sharp arc - like features dubbed `` wisps '' ( scargle 1969 ) located at the inner boundary of the x - ray torus and probably associated with a termination shock in the pulsar wind ( e.g. , hester et al .",
    "1995 ; kennel & coroniti 1984 ) . also , the comparison between the _ hubble space telescope _",
    "( _ hst _ ) and _ chandra _  observations of the lmc pulsar b054069 has clearly shown the presence of an optical pwn which follows exactly the morphology of the x - ray pwn ( caraveo et al .  2001b , 2003 ) .",
    "contrary to the crab and psr b054069 , searches for the vela pwn in optical have been inconclusive so far .",
    "the only marginal detection of an optical pwn was reported by gelman et al .",
    "( 1989 ) , who observed the vela pulsar field in the @xmath12 and @xmath13 bands with the eso 2.2 m telescope .",
    "these authors found evidence for optical diffuse emission ( typical size @xmath14 ) , with an average surface brightness of about 26 mag arcsec@xmath15 .",
    "however , the presence of bright filaments from the host snr , as well as of several bright stars in the field , made it difficult to assess the reality of the putative optical nebula .",
    "the increase in sensitivity and angular resolution provided by the _ hst _ prompted us to carry out a new optical investigation of the vela pulsar region . in the following ,",
    "we discuss spatial correlations between _ chandra _ acis images ( pavlov et al .",
    "2001b ; pavlov et al .",
    "2003 ) and the optical ones collected by both the _ hst _ wfpc2 ( mignani and caraveo 2001 ; caraveo et al .",
    "2001a ) and eso _ ntt _ ( nasuti et al .  1997 ) and _",
    "the multiple observations of the vela pwn with the _ chandra _   acis are described by pavlov et al .",
    "( 2003 ) . in all the observations",
    "the pwn was imaged on the same back - illuminated chip s3 , more sensitive to soft x - rays .",
    "although the individual images show some variability of the pwn elements , the overall pwn morphology remains stable . to obtain a very deep x - ray image to be compared with the optical ones",
    ", we stacked seven consecutive individual images , collected from 2001 november 25 through 2002 april 3 for a total exposure time of 141 ks , and adaptively smoothed the combined image .",
    "the accuracy of the image co - alignment was about 07 .",
    "the smoothed x - ray image of the pwn , in the energy band 18 kev , is shown in figure 1 .",
    "the logarithmic brightness scale was chosen to increase the dynamic range .",
    "the jet and the counter - jet , northwest and southeast of the pulsar , respectively , and two arc - like structures ( inner and outer arcs ) are the dominant features of the bright inner nebula ( upper panel ) .",
    "the inner nebula is surrounded by a bean - shaped region of diffuse emission ( outer nebula ) , @xmath16 in size ( lower panel ) .",
    "an elongated region of fainter extended emission southwest of the bright inner pwn is seen up to the edge of the acis image ( @xmath17 from the pulsar ) .",
    "a @xmath18-long outer jet is seen northwest of the inner pwn . the spectrum of the bright inner pwn , within a @xmath19 radius around the pulsar ,",
    "can be fitted by a single power - law model with a spectral index @xmath20 and unabsorbed flux of @xmath21 ergs s@xmath22 cm@xmath15 , in the 0.110 kev range ( kargaltsev et al .",
    "the unabsorbed surface brightnesses for the outer and inner arcs are about @xmath24 and @xmath25 ergs s@xmath22 cm@xmath15 arcsec@xmath15 , while the spectral indices @xmath26 are about 0.4 and 0.3 , respectively .",
    "optical observations of the vela pulsar field were collected at different epochs using different telescopes , instrumentation , observational set - ups , and filters .",
    "in addition to the recent high - resolution imaging data obtained with the _ hst _ , our data set includes archived ground - based images obtained from eso with the _ ntt _ and the _ vlt_. table 1 gives a detailed summary of the available observations .",
    "_ hst _ observations of the vela pulsar field were collected between 1997 june and 2000 march with the wfpc2 .",
    "several images have been taken through the filters @xmath27 ( @xmath28 ; @xmath29 ) , @xmath30 ( @xmath31 ; @xmath32 ) and @xmath33 ( @xmath34 ; @xmath35 ) with exposure times ranging between 2000 s and 2600 s. these data were originally taken as part of two independent programs aimed at the study of the multicolor flux distribution of the pulsar ( mignani & caraveo 2001 ) and at the measure of its parallactic displacement ( caraveo et al .",
    "2001a ) . to achieve the maximum spatial resolution , in all the exposures the pulsar was located near the center of the planetary camera chip , with a pixel size of @xmath36 and a field of view of @xmath37 .",
    "pipeline was applied for the image reduction and for the photometric calibrations .",
    "co - aligned exposures were finally combined to filter out cosmic ray hits ( see mignani & caraveo 2001 and caraveo et al .",
    "2001a for a detailed description of the observations and data reduction ) .    for each observation ,",
    "the iraf / stsdas task wmosaic was used to obtain a mosaic of the four wfpc2 images and correct for the instrumental geometric distortion of the cameras ( casertano & wiggs 2001 ) . to increase the signal - to - noise ratio , we combined all the available @xmath33 filter images . since the observations at different epochs were performed with different telescope pointings and roll angles , to superpose the frames we had to follow the procedure successfully applied in previous astrometric works , using a common reference frame defined by a grid of reference stars coordinates ( see caraveo et al .",
    "2001a and references therein for further details ) .",
    "images were registered within @xmath38 wfc pixels ( @xmath39 10 mas ) , an accuracy adequate to achieve the goals of the present investigation , co - aligned and stacked .      the vela pulsar field was observed with the _ ntt _ at the la silla observatory in january 1995 ( nasuti et al .",
    "1997 ) . to achieve the highest sensitivity both at longer and shorter wavelengths ,",
    "the emmi camera was used in both its red ( emmi - r ) and blue ( emmi - b ) arm modes .",

    "( 1997 ) .",
    "observations of the field were performed in april 1999 with the first unit telescope ( antu ) of the eso _ vlt _ located at the paranal observatory .",
    "images were obtained using the focal reducer and spectrograph # 1 ( fors1 ) instrument , a four - port @xmath53 ccd detector which can be used both as a high / low resolution spectrograph and an imaging camera .",
    "the instrument was operated in imaging mode with a @xmath54 binning and at its standard angular resolution of 0.2 arcsec / pixel , with a corresponding field of view of @xmath55 .",
    "two 300 s exposures were taken in the bessel filters @xmath50 ( @xmath56 ; @xmath57 ) and @xmath58 ( @xmath59 ; @xmath60 ) under good seeing conditions @xmath61 ) .",
    "the images have been retrieved from the eso public archive and reduced following standard procedures for debiassing and flatfielding .",
    "since no standard stars were observed , absolute flux calibration was performed using as a reference a set of secondary stars detected in the same passbands in the _ ntt _ images .",
    "three 20-min exposures of the vela pulsar field were taken in h@xmath62 ( @xmath63 , @xmath64 ) on 1999 april 4 with the wide field imager ( wfi ) at the eso / mpg 2.2  m telescope .",
    "the wfi is a wide field mosaic camera , composed of eight @xmath65 pixel ccds , with a scale of @xmath66 arcsec / pixel , providing a field of view of @xmath67 . to compensate for the loss of signal due to the interchip gaps ( 238 and 143 along right ascension and declination , respectively ) , the second and third exposures were taken with a relative offset of @xmath68 in ra and dec .",
    "the images were taken in fairly good seeing conditions with fwhm@xmath69 .",
    "data reduction with the usual ccd processing steps of bias subtraction , flat - fielding and trimming of images , was performed with iraf using the mosaic ccd reduction package ( mscred ) .",
    "individual exposures have been finally coadded and cleaned of cosmic - ray hits using the drizzle software ( hook & fruchter 1997 ) and the final image has been corrected for the effects of fringing that affects the ccds in the red part of the spectrum ( @xmath70  ) .",
    "the direct comparison of images taken in different energy bands ( e.g. , optical and x - rays ) can be achieved through accurate image superposition . following the approach used by caraveo et al .",
    "( 2001b ) , we superimposed the x - ray _ chandra _ image onto the optical ones with respect to the absolute ( @xmath26,@xmath71 ) reference frame , relying on the astrometric solution of each image .",
    "we used the combined _ chandra _ acis image , where individual images were co - aligned with an accuracy of @xmath72 ( pavlov et al .",
    "the error of the absolute _ chandra _ aspect solution is typically about @xmath73 .",
    "therefore , we adopt @xmath74 as a reasonable estimate for the uncertainty of the absolute x - ray astrometry .    for the wfpc2 images , the default astrometric solution across the focal plane",
    "is derived from the coordinates of the two guide stars used to point the telescope , which are taken as a reference to compute the astrometric reference point and the telescope roll angle .",
    "the accuracy of the _ hst _ astrometry is limited by the intrinsic error on the absolute coordinates of the gsc1.1 ( guide star catalog ) stars ( lasker et al .",
    "1990 ) which are used for the telescope pointing .",
    "according to the current estimates , the mean uncertainty of the absolute positions quoted in the gsc1.1 is about 08 per coordinate ( biretta et al .",
    "2002 ) .",
    "for this reason , we have recomputed a new astrometric solution for the wfpc2 images by using as a reference the positions of several stars from the usno - a2.0 catalog ( monet 1998 ) identified in the field of view .",
    "the astrom software was used to compute the pixel - to - sky coordinates transformation .",
    "the rms of the astrometric fit was @xmath75 , per coordinate .",
    "the astrometric calibrations of the the ground - based optical images was computed as described above .",
    "the astrometric fits yielded rms values of @xmath76 and @xmath77 per coordinate for the _ vlt _ and _ ntt _ images , respectively . for the wfi image , the astrometry was computed separately for each of the eight ccd chips , yielding an average rms of @xmath78 .    in all cases ,",
    "the final uncertainty on our astrometric solutions was evaluated by accounting both for the rms of the astrometric fits and for the propagation of the error on the intrinsic absolute accuracy of the usno - a2.0 coordinates , which is of the order of @xmath79@xmath80 .",
    "the absolute frame registration between the optical and x - ray images turned out to be accurate within @xmath81 , i.e. , compatible with the overall uncertainties of the absolute astrometry of each frame .",
    "unfortunately , the strong pile - up of the vela pulsar in the acis images hampered the use of the pulsar position for better co - alignment between the x - ray and optical images .",
    "as a first step , the central part of the x - ray pwn field ( corresponding to the inner nebula and the outer nebula ) was inspected to search for optical counterparts of the complex structures seen with _",
    "chandra_. our starting point was the combined wfpc2 @xmath33 image , which is by far the deepest optical image of the vela pulsar field .",
    "the final image is shown in figure 2 , where we superimposed the x - ray contour map obtained from the combined _ chandra _ acis exposure of the region .",
    "although a number of complicated patterns of diffuse emission are present in the @xmath82 field of view , no optical counterparts of the x - ray features seen in figure 1 can be identified , nor any other structure symmetric with respect to the axis of symmetry of the x - ray pwn .",
    "we thus conclude that the pwn is undetected in the optical .    to compute the upper limit on the optical surface brightness of the pwn , an accurate mapping of the background is required .",
    "this is complicated by the presence of diffuse , non - uniform , emission patterns which show sharp surface brightness variations on angular scales as small as @xmath83 arcsec .",
    "for this reason , we evaluated the background level in @xmath84 cells of 1 arcsec@xmath8 each , selected in a number of star - free regions across the whole image .",
    "statistical errors on the number of counts per cell were of the order of 0.3% .",
    "the background level , @xmath85 st magnitudes  arcsec@xmath15 on average , was found to vary typically by 4%5% across the whole field , with a maximum variation of @xmath39 7% .",
    "for an extended source , the upper limits on the surface brightness scale with the detection area @xmath86 as @xmath87 .",
    "an optimally chosen area should be large enough to reduce the statistical errors due to the background fluctuations but it should be smaller than the scale of sharp background variations . according to our mapping of the background , a detection area of 10 arcsec@xmath88 represents a resonable optimization .",
    "for the area chosen , the measured background variations affect the upper limit on the flux of an extended source ( at a 3 @xmath89 level ) by no more than @xmath393% , corresponding to surface brightness variations below 0.1 magnitudes arcsec@xmath15 .",
    "while variations in the sky background across the image play a minor role , we found that the derived surface brightness upper limits are different in different regions of the image .",
    "this is mainly due to the non - uniform coverage of the field performed by the wfpc2 .",
    "first , because of the intrinsic differences in the pixel size and in the physical characteristics of the ccds , the pc and the wfc chips contribute differently to the instrumental background per unit area .",
    "in addition , since the five wfpc2 @xmath33 observations listed in table 1 were executed at different epochs and with different telescope roll angles , the exposure map varies across the field .",
    "for instance , the central region of the field , which is covered by the pc ( @xmath90 ) , reaches an integration time of 11800 s , while the outer regions , covered by the three wfc chips , have integration times varying between 4600 and 11800 s.",
    "both effects clearly affect the evaluation of the surface brightness upper limits in different regions of the pwn , as they are covered differently by the four wfpc2 chips . as it is seen from figure 2 , some regions of the inner nebula ( inner arc , jet , and counter - jet ) fall entirely within the pc , while the outer arc is coincident with the inter - chip gaps and is covered partially by the pc and partially by the wfc chips . on the other hand , the outer nebula is entirely covered by the wfc chips .",
    "taking all these effects into account , we have computed the 3@xmath89 upper limits on the optical surface brightness of both the inner nebula ( inner arc , jet , counter - jet , outer arc ) and the outer nebula .",
    "we note that although our upper limits have been computed for a detection area of 10 arcsec@xmath88 , they can be easily rescaled to any other area .    using the _ hst _ pipeline photometric calibration",
    ", we computed an upper limit of 28.1 and 28.028.5 st magnitudes arcsec@xmath15 for the inner nebula and for the outer nebula , respectively . as we mentioned before , because of the non - uniformity of the exposure map the upper limit for the outer nebula turned out to be slightly position - dependent .",
    "to correct these limits for the interstellar reddening , we use the extinction @xmath91 , consistent with the hydrogen column density estimated from the x - ray observations of the vela pulsar ( pavlov et al .",
    "the corrected limits are 27.9 and 27.828.3 st magnitudes arcsec@xmath15 .",
    "the same analysis was then repeated for the other available wfpc2 images ( @xmath27 and @xmath30 ) as well as for the _ ntt _ ( @xmath92 ) and _ vlt _ ( @xmath93 ) ones ( see table 1 ) but no evidence for a compact optical nebula was found in either of these datasets .",
    "the computed upper limits are summarized in table 2 .      since the emission from the pwn could , in principle , be visible at optical wavelenghts on larger angular scales with respect to the x - rays , as it has been observed in radio ( see  1 ) , we took advantage of the larger field of view provided by the _ ntt _ images to search for extended features up to distances of @xmath94 arcmin .",
    "in particular , we searched for diffuse optical emission at the position of the southwest extension of the x - ray nebula ( see fig .  1 , lower panel ) . to go as deep as possible , we have combined all the available _ ntt _ @xmath92 band images ( fig .  3 , upper panel ) .",
    "the combined image shows many different enhancements in the background , with a rather complex spatial distribution .",
    "however , none of them can be firmly correlated with the known x - ray features .",
    "in addition , we note that almost all the diffuse emission patterns seen in the _ ntt _ @xmath92 image can be also identified in the eso/2.2 m h@xmath62 ( fig .  3 , lower panel ) .",
    "this suggests that they are most likely associated with the bright filaments of the vela supernova remnant .",
    "we note that the computed _ ntt _ upper limits on the optical emission of the compact x - ray nebula can be applied also at larger distances from the pulsar . the maximum variation in surface brightness for source - free regions , due to the complicated distribution of diffuse emission , is found to be of order 7% even in the outer regions of the _ ntt _ field , which corresponds to @xmath95 magnitudes arcsec@xmath15 variations of the upper limit across the field ( see  3.1 ) .",
    "we note that for the _ ntt _ images the measured upper limits in the @xmath43 and @xmath13 bands do not apply to the region @xmath39 2.5 arcmin southwest of the pulsar position , close to the southwest edge of the extended x - ray nebula .",
    "the background in this region is unrecoverably polluted by the presence of a bright ( @xmath969 ) b star that is not visible in the @xmath12 and @xmath50 band images because of the slightly narrower field of view .",
    "it is interesting to compare the measured upper limits on the optical brightness of the vela pwn with the x - ray and radio observations .",
    "the observed x - ray spectra of the vela pwn are described by a power law with spectral indices @xmath970.4 and @xmath980.5 , for the arcs and the extended diffuse emission southwest of the pulsar , respectively ( kargaltsev et al .",
    "the x - ray and radio surface brightness spectra , together with the optical upper limits , are shown in figure 4 for the outer arc ( upper panel ) and the diffuse emission southwest of the pulsar ( lower panel ) .",
    "since the inner pwn structures were not resolved in the radio ( see  1 ) , only radio upper limits are plotted in the upper panel . from the plot",
    "we see that both the optical and radio upper limits for the outer arc are within the uncertainty of the extrapolation of the x - ray spectrum towards lower frequencies .    in the case of the southwest diffuse emission",
    ", we note that the x - ray - to - radio extrapolation is well _ below _ the measured radio brightness values .",
    "this apparent inconsistency can be explained by the fact that the radio and x - ray brightnesses were measured in different areas ( the x - ray image is substantially smaller than the radio image ) .",
    "moreover , even within the smaller x - ray field - of - view , it is seen that the x - ray brightness of the southwest diffuse emission fades towards the region of maximum radio brightness ( which is outside the x - ray field of view ) .",
    "such behavior can be explained by radiative ( synchrotron ) and adiabatic cooling of the expanding cloud of relativistic electrons , which can result not only in the increase of the spectral index , but also in the shift of the lower - energy boundary of the power - law spectrum towards lower energies .",
    "therefore , we can expect maximum optical brightness to be observed in between the regions of the x - ray and radio maximum brightnesses .",
    "although the x - ray and radio spectra in the lower panel of figure 4 can not be directly compared with each other , a crude estimate of the expected optical brightness can be obtained by connecting the radio and x - ray points .",
    "this yields @xmath99 erg cm@xmath15 s@xmath22 hz@xmath22 arcsec@xmath15 , i.e. , about 3 magnitudes below our measured optical upper limit .    to summarize ,",
    "we conclude that it is very likely that just a slightly deeper optical observation would allow one to detect the outer / inner arc ( and other bright elements of the inner pwn ) , while much deeper optical observations are needed to detect the emission from the vela pwn at large .",
    "however , owing to the presence of background / foreground emission from the snr as well as numerous bright stars in the field , longer exposures would not help to detect the optical pwn  neither its x - ray - bright central part nor the radio - bright outskirts .",
    "to get rid of the contaminating emission , one should observe the field at uv wavelengths , where the radiation of most of the field stars would be much dimmer .",
    "observing in polarized light appears even more promising . since the synchrotron emission from the pwn",
    "should be highly polarized ( as confirmed by the radio observations ) , polarimetry observations should allow one to minimize the contamination from field sources and provide a clean pwn image .",
    "polarimetry observations of the vela pulsar field have been recently obtained by wagner and seifert ( 2000 ) but they did not yield a conclusive result .",
    "deeper , higher - resolution , observations are needed to unveal extended polarized emission from the pwn .",

    "<S> observations of the vela pulsar region with the _ chandra _ x - ray observatory have revealed the fine structure of its synchrotron pulsar - wind nebula ( pwn ) , which showed an overall similarity with the crab pwn . however , contrary to the crab , no firm detection of the vela pwn in optical has been reported yet . to search for the optical counterpart of the x - ray pwn , we analyzed deep optical observations performed with different telescopes . </S>",
    "<S> we compared the optical images with those obtained with the _ chandra _ acis to search for extended emission patterns which could be identified as counterparts of the x - ray nebula elements . </S>",
    "<S> although some features are seen in the optical images , we find no correlation with the x - ray structure . </S>",
    "<S> thus , we conclude that the diffuse optical emission is more likely associated with filaments in the host vela snr . the derived upper limits on the optical flux from the pwn are compatibile , within the uncertainties , with the values expected on the basis of the extrapolations of the x - ray data . </S>"
