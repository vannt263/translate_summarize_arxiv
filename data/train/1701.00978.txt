    "the problems of coherent control and efficient population transfer between atomic or molecular levels have been given plenty of attention and prominence both theoretically and experimentally @xcite over the past few decades .",

    "stirap @xcite has proven to be a robust technique to ensure an almost complete level - to - level population transfer .",
    "this transfer scheme results from a mechanism involving a counterintuitive sequence of two laser pulses , conventionally called the pump and the stokes pulses .",
    "the counterintuitive behavior is translated by an unforeseen phenomena that the stokes pulse , which is applied in a second time , precedes and overlaps the pump pulse .",
    "many studies have been carried out on the processes of stirap @xcite . according to the literature , stirap - type solution from local control theory ( lct ) has been already demonstrated @xcite .",
    "compared to lct , the optimal control theory ( oct ) appears to be more flexible and more efficient , particularly , for complex systems with many degrees of freedom .",
    "in fact , oct requires information only about the initial and the final ( target ) states .",
    "hence , to find the optimal field leading to the desired objective , oct adopts the most appropriate route using a forward - backward iteration process .",
    "however , lct needs information at every instant during the optimization cycle in order to ensure a monotonic increment in the sought objective . by using oct , yuan et al .",
    "@xcite have proposed an analytical derivation of a stirap - type solution for specific many - level systems in a peculiar framework , by assuming that the rabi frequency is not bounded .",

    "we show in this paper that by using a state - dependent constraint , the counterintuitive scheme generated from stirap can indeed be achieved .",
    "we compare here the efficiency of stirap and the new oct by analyzing the robustness with respect to the decay and with respect to the pulse fluctuations .",

    "[ fig : lambda_system ] ) by minimizing the population of the intermediate level @xmath2 .",
    "this loss mechanism could be modeled by adding an imaginary term @xmath56 to the energy of the level @xmath46 , where @xmath57 represents the decay rate and @xmath58 is a second factor parameter .",

    "the figure displays the population at the final instant of the target level @xmath4 as a function of @xmath55 parameter ( fig .",
    "[ fig : pop_robustness_energy](a ) ) or @xmath58 parameter ( fig .",
    "[ fig : pop_robustness_energy](b ) ) .",
    "in addition to the adiabatic following condition , for the results shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : pop_robustness_energy ] , we ensured that the energy of the stirap field is set to be equivalent to the energy of the optimized field generated by the new oct method . since in the stirap approach",
    "are defined analytically , one expect that this method would be more robust .",
    "but surprisingly , it is clearly seen from the solid black line of the upper panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : pop_robustness_energy ] that the new oct method is less sensitive to the field perturbation than the stirap approach .",
    "once a field perturbation is introduced , the dashed red line that describes the results obtained with the stirap decreases drastically .",
    "for example for @xmath64 , the population in the target state is only about 2% for the stirap method while it is greater than 90% for new oct method .",
    "the fact that the optimized pulses are more robust than the ones produced by stirap with regards to the pulse fluctuations is attributed to the pulses duration .",
    "in fact the fwhm of the optimized pulses is two times shorter than the stirap pulses .",
    "contrariwise in the lower panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : pop_robustness_energy ] we observe an opposite behavior .",
    "the stirap method appears to be more robust with respect to the decay .",
    "the dashed red curve shows a linear decrease of the population .",

    "at @xmath65 , the population in the target state is about 78% for the new oct method .",
    "hence , at first glance , one could conclude that the robustness of each of these methods depends on what we take into consideration which is usually dictated by the experiment setup .    .",
    "comparison of robustness for several field energies of the stirap method . ]    in order to investigate more the robustness and going further in respecting the adiabatic following condition @xmath67 , we show in figure [ fig : pop_robustness ] the same comparison as in fig .",

    "( a ) , the results corresponding to @xmath68 and @xmath69 show that the robustness of the stirap with respect to the pulse fluctuations does not necessarily increase when we increase the field energy as one could expect .",
    "however the efficiency with regard to the decay is significantly improved when we increase the energy of the initial pulse , fig .",
    "[ fig : pop_robustness_energy](a ) .",
    "yet we should emphasize on two points here , regarding the efficiency as a function of the decay , indeed stirap appears to be more robust , however the new oct still keep having high population within the target state , the minimum value is 78% when @xmath65 , in addition to the fact that we did not increase the energy of the initial pulse for oct .",
    "the second point is about the adiabatic following condition , it is of course very important to fulfill this condition to ensure a population transfer within stirap .",
    "however it implies to choose higher energies for the initial pulses , which usually represents a kind of burden for experimental setups .",
    "this analysis allows us to conclude that , for the population transfer from an initial state to a final one , the oct method with the sate - dependent constraint is more robust than the stirap when perturbations are introduced in the field .",
    "however stirap is more efficient when we refer to the decay in the intermediate state of the system .",

    "lct led to a population transfer within four- and nine - level systems .",

    "since the new oct method leads to equivalent results for three- and four - level systems , we expect that it would conduct to similar conclusion for n - level systems .",

    "<S> we demonstrate that optimal control theory ( oct ) with a state - dependent constraint which depends on the state of the system at each instant can reproduce the famous counterintuitive mechanism of stimulated raman adiabatic passage ( stirap ) . </S>",
    "<S> we examine this behavior in a @xmath0-type three - level system and we show that could be applied for sequentially coupled many - level systems . </S>",
    "<S> we study the robustness of the two methods with respect to pulse fluctuations and the decays . </S>",
    "<S> we show that new oct formulation appears to be more robust than stirap when a perturbation is introduced in the pulses . </S>",
    "<S> such method is of great use for systems involving coherence loss such as molecular systems with dissociation or ionization limits . </S>",
    "<S> it also may find potential applications in the control of chemical reactions , quantum optics , and quantum information processing .    </S>",
