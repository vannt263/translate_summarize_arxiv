    "<S> we study the so - called `` kaluza - klein regularization '' . </S>",

    "<S> .@xcite-@xcite it has been found that one - loop radiative corrections to the higgs mass are finite in the models with the scherk - schwarz susy breaking mechanism @xcite and also in the models with localized susy breaking 3-brane . in such perturbative calculations , </S>",
    "<S> the so - called `` kaluza - klein ( kk ) regularization '' is used , that is , infinite summation of all kk modes is taken first .    </S>",
    "<S> however , a doubt on the validity of the kk regularization has arisen @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it is claimed that the exchange between infinite sum and infinite integral would lead to an incorrect result . in ref  </S>",
    "<S> .@xcite , the momentum cut - off @xmath6 is introduced and the kk - tower is truncated at the level @xmath1 . in addition , it is also claimed that physically the level to contribute should be truncated around the momentum cut - off @xmath6 . in ref  .@xcite , such physical truncation is realized by a sharp cut , @xmath7 , where @xmath3 is the compactification radius . </S>",
    "<S> then , the quadratic divergence is found to appear in the higgs mass corrections due to finite numbers of kk modes .    </S>",
    "<S> moreover , there is a debate that the result of ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite may be because of the sharp cut of the kk - tower , and such procedure spoils symmetries of the underlying theory . instead of such truncation , in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite the suppression by a gaussian brane distribution is considered . there the infinite numbers of kk modes are summed , but the couplings of higher modes are suppressed by a finite width of the brane . then the result is the same as the kk regularization , that is , the higgs mass correction is finite . </S>",
    "<S> however , it is pointed out also that there are other distributions leading to a linear sensitivity with the momentum cut - off @xmath6 . also the pauli - villars regularization is discussed in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite .    in this letter </S>",
    "<S> , we consider the grounds for finiteness of the kk regularization . </S>",
    "<S> we calculate explicitly the correction to the higgs mass due to the kk modes by performing both of the momentum cut - off and the kk level truncation . </S>",
    "<S> our purpose is to show in which case the correction becomes insensitive to details of physics in the ultraviolet ( uv ) scale . </S>",
    "<S> we discuss by using the proper time regularization for the uv divergence . because the proper time regularization does not spoil four - dimensional symmetries . </S>",
    "<S> also the proper time regularization is in a sense smooth compared with the sharp momentum cut - off . </S>",
    "<S> actually , the proper time regularization was used to derive the power - law behavior of gauge couplings due to kk modes @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it was shown in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite that transition to the power - law behavior at the compactification scale appears smoothly in the proper time regularization compared with other regularization schemes , although qualitatively same results for the power - law bahavior are obtained in different regularization schemes . </S>",
    "<S> hence , we use here the proper time regularization as a first trial . </S>",
    "<S> then it will be shown that the finite result is obtained as long as @xmath2 for the compactification radius @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> this is seen also even when the sharp momentum cut - off is used @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> suppose that we have the following bosonic and fermionic kk modes , @xmath8 with @xmath9 , where we have normalized the compactification radius @xmath3 with the factor @xmath10 for convenience of the later calculations . for simplicity </S>",
    "<S> , we have assumed that only the bosonic modes have susy breaking masses . </S>",
    "<S> however , the following discussions are applicable for more generic case . on top of that , </S>",
    "<S> their coupling to the ( zero - mode ) higgs field is denoted by @xmath11 , which is assumed to be universal between bosonic and fermionic modes , and lower and higher kk modes .    in this setup , </S>",
    "<S> the fermionic contribution to the higgs mass is proportional to the following integral , @xmath12 thus , how to calculate this and the corresponding bosonic integral is the point to be investigated . </S>",
    "<S> here we use the scwinger representation , that is , we use the following identities : @xmath13 then the above integral ( [ integral-1 ] ) is written as @xmath14 here we truncate the kk - modes at the level @xmath1 and put the cut - off @xmath0 for the proper time integral </S>",
    "<S> . then what should be evaluated is the following integral @xmath15    now , both of the summation and integral are finite , and we can exchange safely the summation and integration , @xmath16 eq .  ( [ integral-2 ] ) includes the suppression factor @xmath17 for higher kk modes @xmath18 . </S>",
    "<S> thus , naively thinking , we can replace the finite summation by the infinite summation , @xmath19 we shall discuss implication of this replacement later . if the replacement ( [ replace-1 ] ) is allowed , the calculation is rather simple . </S>",
    "<S> we use the poisson summation formular , i.e. the modular transformation property of the @xmath20 function , ) and the poisson summation formular are used in order to derive the power - law behavior of gauge couplings due to kk modes @xcite . ] </S>",
    "<S> @xmath21 such that we obtain @xmath22 where @xmath23 , and that is finite . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , we have @xmath24 in the limit @xmath25 . </S>",
    "<S> thus we have the @xmath26 divergence for the fermionic modes only .    </S>",
    "<S> similarly , we can calculate the contribution due to bosonic modes with the masses @xmath27 . </S>",
    "<S> the divergent term is exactly the same as eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ integral-3 ] ) , although the finite part is different . </S>",
    "<S> thus , if the replacement ( [ replace-1 ] ) is allowed , we can deduce that the higgs mass correction due to bosonic and fermionic kk modes with the mass spectrum ( [ mass - sp ] ) is finite at the one - loop level of perturbative calculations .    in the above calculations , </S>",
    "<S> we have used the replacement ( [ replace-1 ] ) of the finite number of summation by the infinite number of summation . </S>",
    "<S> such replacement by the infinite number of summation may be doubtable from the viewpoint of the sharp truncation . </S>",
    "<S> here we discuss more about the replacement ( [ replace-1 ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> first of all , each fermionic ( bosonic ) kk mode would have a quadratic divergent correction @xmath28 to the higgs mass . if we have @xmath29 kk modes contributing to the higss mass corrections , we have totally the corrections of the order of @xmath30 . </S>",
    "<S> we compare this naive estimation with the result ( [ integral-3 ] ) , whose divergence part is proportional to @xmath26 . </S>",
    "<S> that implies that in the proper time regularization and the replacement ( [ replace-1 ] ) the kk modes higher than @xmath31 are decoupled effectively , but not by the explicitly sharp truncation , that is , the infinite summation seems not essential to obtain the finite result , but the summation over @xmath32 is enough . </S>",
    "<S> this result is also in agreement with the sharp cutoff case examined in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> next we examine the replacement ( [ replace-1 ] ) . for concreteness , we use the case with @xmath33 . for the moment , we require two points that 1 ) the positive and negative modes be treated on an equal footing and 2 ) the involved number of bosonic kk modes be the same as one of the corresponding fermionic modes in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ integral-2 ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> hence , the integral corresponding to @xmath34 ( [ integral-2 ] ) is obtained @xmath35 . </S>",
    "<S> \\label{integral - b1}\\ ] ] now we estimate what we have added in the replacement ( [ replace-1 ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> we have added the following contribution for the fermionic modes : @xmath36 in a similar replacement of bosonic contribution , we have added the following contribution : @xmath37 . </S>",

    "<S> ( [ level-1 ] ) can be expanded @xmath40 . </S>",
    "<S> \\label{level-2}\\ ] ] the terms corresponding to the quadratic divergence @xmath28 seem to be cancelled , but the terms corresponding to the logarithmic divergence @xmath41 are not cancelled . </S>",
    "<S> however , note that there is the suppression factor @xmath17 in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ level-1 ] ) with @xmath42 and @xmath43 . </S>",
    "<S> thus , if @xmath1 is large enough , such logarithmic divergence @xmath41 is decoupled . </S>",
    "<S> that is consistent with the previous result .    on the other hand , around @xmath44 </S>",
    "<S> , such suppression factor does not work . </S>",
    "<S> then , we have the logarithmic divergence @xmath41 for each mode . </S>",
    "<S> the divergence is enhanced by the number of relevant kk modes . </S>",
    "<S> thus , again , whether we have the divergence or not , depends on if we allow to take @xmath1 enough large . </S>",
    "<S> we need not the infinite number for @xmath1 .    </S>",
    "<S> the splitting of the modes with the masses @xmath45 and @xmath46 in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ integral - b1 ] ) might look artificial . </S>",
    "<S> the reason for such representation is that we cared the edge modes with @xmath47 . </S>",
    "<S> however , now it is obvious that such higher modes have no contribution for sufficiently large @xmath1 because of the suppression factor @xmath48 . actually , the integral </S>",
    "<S> is written @xmath49 and the result is same , that is , we have the finite result for large @xmath50 . even in the case </S>",
    "<S> that we differ the levels for truncation between the fermionic and bosonic modes , say @xmath51 and @xmath52 , we have the finite result for sufficiently large @xmath53 .    </S>",
    "<S> so far we have not been concerned about running of the gauge coupling ( and yukawa couplings , if any ) . in extra dimensions </S>",
    "<S> the scale dependence is given by power law . </S>",
    "<S> we can incorporate this running coupling into the higgs mass corrections by examining the renormalization group ( rg ) equations for @xmath54 ( [ integral - b1 ] ) and @xmath34 ( [ integral-2 ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> indeed the finiteness is clearly seen in the rg point of view . </S>",
    "<S> here we consider the rg equation in the wilson sense , which are given by @xmath55 \\equiv { g^2(\\lambda ) \\over 16\\pi^2 } \\lambda^2 { 1 \\over 2}\\varepsilon_b(r\\lambda ) ,   \\label{beta-2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath33 . </S>",
    "<S> actually it is not necessary to give the beta function for the gauge coupling in order to see the finiteness of the correction . </S>",
    "<S> what concerns us is @xmath56 </S>",
    "<S> . if this difference vanishes for the region @xmath57 , the corrections to the higgs mass would be uv insensitive and finite .    </S>",
    "<S> for example we take @xmath58 . </S>",
    "<S> fig .  1 shows @xmath59 and @xmath60 . </S>",
    "<S> behaviors of the two curves are almost same for @xmath61 . in the region with @xmath62 , i.e. @xmath63 , the curve of @xmath64 behaves linearly . </S>",
    "<S> this behavior is consistent with the previous result ( [ integral-3 ] ) that the divergence behaves like @xmath26 for @xmath65 . for large @xmath66 </S>",
    "<S> , @xmath64 goes close to the constant @xmath67 .    </S>",
    "<S> = 0.5    fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 2 shows the difference @xmath68 . </S>",
    "<S> the difference damps rapidly above @xmath69 . </S>",
    "<S> that implies that for @xmath70 , no correction arises to the higgs mass . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , as long as we keep the kk level truncation as @xmath65 , the correction is finite and of @xmath71 . </S>",
    "<S> it was mentioned above that we need large @xmath50 in order to obtain the finite result . </S>",
    "<S> this numerical calculation shows how large @xmath1 is necessary , and @xmath72 seems sufficient , although the explicit value 0.9 has no serious meaning . that suggests a huge gap between @xmath1 and @xmath73 is not required . </S>",
    "<S> there is a small lump starting from @xmath74 , i.e. @xmath75 . that corresponds to the sum of logarithmic divergences , which is mentioned in the level - by - level calculation around eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ level-2 ] ) , and that is also consistent with the calculation in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite showing the presence of divergence , where the level truncation is taken around @xmath7 . </S>",
    "<S> the difference @xmath68 behaves as @xmath76 at @xmath77 . </S>",
    "<S> this implies that the corrections depend on the uv cut - off @xmath6 logarithmically ( with constant @xmath11 ) , when we truncate the kk modes at much lower scale than @xmath6 .    </S>",
    "<S> = 0.5    we have calculated numerically the case with @xmath33 . </S>",
    "<S> we can easily extend to other cases , e.g. for other values of @xmath78 , @xmath79 for any value of @xmath78 , the difference @xmath80 behaves like fig .  2 in the region with @xmath81 </S>",
    "<S> that implies for @xmath82 the correction to the higgs mass is finite and of @xmath71 . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , in @xmath54 of eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ integral - b3 ] ) we can replace the truncated level @xmath1 by @xmath52 , which is independent of the truncated level of fermionic modes @xmath1 . even in this case </S>",
    "<S> , we have the same behavior of @xmath80 in the region with @xmath83 .    </S>",
    "<S> we have used the proper time regularization . however </S>",
    "<S> we can apply also other regularization schemes , e.g. the sharp momentum cut - off . </S>",
    "<S> explicitly we examine the beta function @xmath84 and the similar function for the bosonic contributions . </S>",
    "<S> then the power law behavior does not depend on the regularization scheme , except for the kk threshold corrections @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> therefore we obtain qualitatively the same results for the finiteness of the corrections .    </S>",
    "<S> also similar discussions seem useful not only for the model with the mass spectrum ( [ mass - sp ] ) , but more generic case . for any other mass spectra </S>",
    "<S> , we can define the difference @xmath68 like eqs .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ beta-1 ] ) and ( [ beta-2 ] ) </S>",
    "<S> . then it can be used as an index for the presence of quadratic divergences .    to summarize </S>",
    "<S> , we have calculated explicitly the higgs mass correction due to kk modes . </S>",
    "<S> the momentum cut - off @xmath6 and the level of truncation @xmath1 have been included . </S>",
    "<S> we have used the proper time regularization , which decouples effectively higher kk modes @xmath85 , and that would fit the philosophy of ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite that such higher modes should be decoupled . however , the decoupling by the proper time regularization is smooth compared with the sharp cut of ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> our results are in order . </S>",
    "<S> finiteness or the appearance of divergences does not depend on whether we put a finite truncation of the kk modes or we sum the infinite number of kk modes , but it depends on where we take the finite truncation @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> if we are allowed sufficiently large truncation compared with the momentum cut - off @xmath50 , we obtain the finite result . numerical study shows we need a large truncation @xmath1 , but not a huge gap between @xmath1 and @xmath73 . on the other hand , if we put @xmath7 , the divergence appears </S>",
    "<S> . that might be rather obvious . because truncating around the momentum cut - off means we would see how to truncate the modes . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , finiteness depends if theory allows @xmath50 . for the spectrum ( [ mass - sp ] ) </S>",
    "<S> , it might be artificial to assign the bosonic state of the mass @xmath86 with the fermionic state of the mass @xmath87 . </S>",
    "<S> the corresponding bosonic state might be the state with @xmath88 . </S>",
    "<S> for example , suppose a theory , which should be irrelevant to such artificial truncation of the edge . in this case one has to take @xmath50 , such that low energy physics becomes insensitive to how to treat such edge . </S>",
    "<S> the concept of locality in extra dimensions , which are discussed in refs .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite-@xcite , might forbid the truncation of kk modes around the cut - off . </S>",
    "<S> on the other hand , suppose a theory , where the cut - off @xmath6 has a real meaning , e.g. the string scale . in this case , we have to truncate at @xmath7 , above which new modes might appear . </S>",
    "<S> for such case , we have to know initial conditions at @xmath6 to discuss low energy physics .    </S>",
    "<S> the radiative corrections in the string theory with a large radius of compactification may be well approximated by using the effective field theroy with infinite tower of the kk modes @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> there the corrections are represented by a kind of proper time cutoff , with which the kk modes heavier than the string scale are decoupled . </S>",
    "<S> therefore the correction to the higgs mass is supposed to be insensitive to the string scale .    </S>",
    "<S> finite results for the higgs mass correction due to kk modes have been found first for models with susy breaking by the scherk - schwarz mechanism refs .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite -@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , what we have studied is the calculations of the correction under the mass spectrum ( [ mass - sp ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> whether the spectrum is obtained by the scherk - schwarz mechanism or other susy breaking mechanisms , is irrelevant to the calculations . </S>",
    "<S> thus , finite results are generic for models with the mass spectrum . to repeat , </S>",
    "<S> the key - point is whether models allow to take large truncation @xmath50 .    </S>",
    "<S> our discussions for finiteness are valid at the one - loop level of perturbation theory . </S>",
    "<S> the two - loop level @xcite and more are beyond the scope . </S>"
