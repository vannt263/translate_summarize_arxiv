    "although molecular outflows have been commonly identified around both low- and high - mass young stellar objects ( ysos ) ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , it is not clear how the bulk of the outflowing gas is accelerated .",
    "past observations show that molecular outflows can often be divided into two components  the `` classical '' less - collimated component with low - velocity and the highly collimated component with extremely high - velocity ( 50@xmath0150 km s@xmath4 , hereafter ehv ) @xcite .",
    "exploring the physical conditions of the ehv molecular gas in details will be helpful for clarifying its role in star formation processes .",
    "the massive star forming region g5.89@xmath00.39 ( hereafter g5.89 ) is associated with energetic co outflows with velocities up to @xmath1@xmath670 km s@xmath4 from its systemic velocity , among the highest gas velocities that have been detected in molecular outflows ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "g5.89 also harbors a shell - like ultracompact ( uc ) h region powered by a young o - type star ( hereafter feldt s star ) visible in the near - ir @xcite .",
    "based on the deduced gas temperature structure , @xcite conclude that feldt s star supplies the majority of energy for heating the dense gas enshrouding the uc h region .",
    "the outflowing gas associated with g5.89 was first identified by @xcite in co ( 1@xmath00 ) with the iram 30-m telescope .",
    "subsequent studies reported outflows with notably different orientations in various tracers .",
    "for example , sio ( 5@xmath04 ) observations with the submillimeter array ( sma ) resolved a bipolar structure along a position angle ( p.a . ) of @xmath130@xmath7 @xcite . on the other hand , sub - arcsecond co ( 3@xmath02 ) images",
    "made with the sma @xcite detected a well - collimated n - s outflow and tentatively a compact nw - se outflow associated with the br@xmath5 outflow revealed by @xcite .",
    "both co outflows demonstrate ehv gas , with velocities @xmath350 km s@xmath4 . furthermore , bima observations in co ( 1@xmath00 ) and hco@xmath8 ( 1@xmath00 ) identified an outflow along the e - w direction @xcite .",
    "these results imply the existence of multiple ysos toward g5.89 .",
    "indeed , five sub - mm dust sources ( denoted as sma1 , sma2 , sma - n , sma - e , and sma - s ) were located in the close vicinity of the uc h region g5.89 @xcite .    here",
    "we present sma observations of g5.89 in co ( 2@xmath01 ) and ( 3@xmath02 ) at resolutions of @xmath13@xmath2 .",
    "we perform large velocity gradient ( lvg ) calculations to explore the physical conditions of the ehv outflowing gas .",
    "we then discuss the nature of the ehv components and their connection to the gas accelerating processes .",
    "the observations were carried out with the sma on 2008 april 17 and may 2 in the band of 230 ghz , and on 2006 july 27 and september 10 in the band of 345 ghz .",

    "observations at 345 ghz band with also seven antennas in the compact configuration , the projected baselines ranged from about 9  m to 70  m ( 10 to 80 k@xmath12 ) . the half - power width of the sma primary beam was @xmath151@xmath2 at 230 ghz and @xmath134@xmath2 at 345 ghz .",
    "the total available double - sideband bandwidth was 4 ghz .",
    "the spectral resolutions of 230 ghz and 345 ghz observations were 0.41 mhz ( 0.53 km s@xmath4 ) and 0.81 mhz ( 0.71 km s@xmath4 ) , respectively .",
    "see @xcite for more complete specifications of the sma .",
    "for the 345 ghz band observations , the flux calibrator was uranus and the bandpass calibrators were uranus ( july 27 and september 10 ) , callisto ( july 27 ) , and 3c279 ( september 10 ) .",

    "see @xcite for the calibration information of the 230 ghz band observations .",
    "for both 230 ghz and 345 ghz band observations , the absolute flux density scales were estimated to have an uncertainty of @xmath120% .",
    "we calibrated the data using the mir software package adapted for the sma from the software package developed originally for the ovro mma @xcite .",

    "figure  [ co21chan ] shows channel maps of the blueshifted and redshifted co ( 2@xmath01 ) emissions associated with g5.89 . for display purposes , we have smoothed the channel maps to a velocity resolution of 20.0 km s@xmath4 .",
    "the spatial distributions of co ( 2@xmath01 ) and ( 3@xmath02 ) agree with each other very well , and the velocity extents of the co ( 2@xmath01 ) and ( 3@xmath02 ) outflows are comparable .",

    "the ehv line wing detected here is significantly broader than that reported by single - dish observations ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the difference is due to the relatively poor sensitivities of single - dish observations .",
    "the structure of the co gas with @xmath14 @xmath21 40 km s@xmath4 is extended and complex .",
    "due to the lack of short - spacing data to recover the extended structure filtered out by our sma observations , in figure [ co21chan ] the low - velocity components are excluded .    the _ left _ and _ right _ panels of figure [ co21mn0 ] show the integrated blueshifted and redshifted emissions of co ( 2@xmath01 ) and ( 3@xmath02 ) , respectively . for both transitions ,",
    "the emissions are integrated over the line wing , with 50 @xmath21 @xmath14 @xmath21 162 km s@xmath4 for the blueshifted gas and 42 @xmath21 @xmath14 @xmath21 80 km s@xmath4 for the redshifted gas .",
    "the outflow morphologies seen in co ( 2@xmath01 ) and ( 3@xmath02 ) are very similar .",
    "although only ehv line wing is integrated , the morphology of the ehv gas is complicated  at least three bluedshifted lobes ( denoted as b - n lobe , b - nw lobe , and b - s lobe ) and two redshifted lobes ( denoted as r - n lobe and r - s lobe ) are revealed in the vicinity of the uc h region g5.89 .",
    "there appears to be an additional redshifted lobe located @xmath14   southeast to feldt s star .",
    "both b - s lobe and r - n lobe have been identified by previous sma co ( 3@xmath02 ) observations at sub - arcsecond resolution , and were proposed to be a pair of the n - s bipolar outflow driven by the sub - mm dust source sma1 @xcite .",
    "the authors also proposed a second co outflow along p.a .",
    "about @xmath055@xmath7 associated with the br@xmath5 outflow reported by @xcite .",
    "our observations confirm the existence of this nw - se outflow , consisting of the b - nw lobe and r - s lobe .",
    "the b - n lobe was also identified by @xcite , although its driving source is less clear .",
    "the existence of the b - n lobe could be explained by the n - s outflow being close to the plane of the sky , but this is very unlikely from the kinematic viewpoint . after correcting for projection , the n - s outflow , if in the plane of sky , will have molecular gas with velocity up to @xmath22500 km s@xmath4 , about a factor of 3 higher than the highest gas velocities that ever identified in molecular outflows .",
    "figure [ copv ] shows the position - velocity ( p - v ) diagrams of the co ( 2@xmath01 ) and ( 3@xmath02 ) along p.a .",
    "175@xmath7 ( _ left _ panel ) centered on the dust source sma1 and 130@xmath7 ( _ right _ panel ) centered on the dust source sma2 . the hubble - like kinematic feature , i.e. , the outflow velocity increasing with the distance from the central yso , is clearly discerned in both outflows with a velocity gradient about 1000 km s@xmath4 pc@xmath4 .",
    "assuming an inclination of 45@xmath7 and a distance of 1.28 kpc @xcite , the inferred dynamical timescales range from 400 years to 650 years",
    ". since the axes of these outflows are unlikely close to either the plane of the sky or the line of sight , the derived dynamical timescales should be accurate to within a factor of 3@xmath04 .",
    "the observed outflow lobes therefore represent the most recent outflow activities in this region .",
    "given the fairly good signal - to - noise ratio of the co emission detected toward g5.89 even at ehv line wing , it is feasible to estimate the physical parameters with a relative narrow velocity bin ( 10 km s@xmath4 ) and investigate their velocity - dependence",
    ". table  [ tb - ratio - b ] summarizes the observed co ( 2@xmath01 ) intensities ( in brightness temperature scale ) as well as the intensity ratios of co ( 3@xmath23 ) and ( 2@xmath01 ) as a function of gas velocity for all the observed lobes .    for a proper comparison ,",
    "both co ( 2@xmath01 ) and ( 3@xmath02 ) maps were reconstructed with a clean beam of 3.4@xmath2 in order to match the resolutions . for each velocity bin , furthermore , we simply report the value calculated from the co ( 2@xmath01 ) peak toward each lobe rather than the value averaged over entire lobe to avoid the difficulty of emission separation from various lobes , in particular , at relatively low - velocity channels .",
    "we emphasize that for each outflow lobe , the peak positions of co ( 2@xmath01 ) and ( 3@xmath02 ) in various velocity bins agree very well with each other , with both median and mean offsets of @xmath10.25@xmath2 , and no systematic offsets can be discerned .",
    "consequently we do not expect any systematic bias for the physical conditions estimated afterward . as listed in table [ tb - ratio - b ] ,",
    "most deduced line ratios are in the range of 0.6@xmath01.2 .",
    "to estimate the physical conditions of the outflowing gas , we performed the lvg analysis with the code written by l. g. mundy and implemented as part of the miriad package @xcite .",
    "we assumed the canonical co fractional abundance of 10@xmath24 and a velocity gradient of 1000 km s@xmath4 pc@xmath4 as estimated from the hubble - like kinematic structure ( in figure [ copv ] ) .",
    "figure [ lvg - temp ] shows the gas temperature estimated from the lvg calculations versus gas velocity .",
    "the plot exhibits a clear increasing trend of gas temperature with outflow velocity .",
    "such a trend can be discerned toward all the lobes , although the trend of the b - n lobe is less clear . in the case of b - nw lobe",
    ", there appears to be a temperature jump at outflow velocities of @xmath1150 km s@xmath4 , with gas temperature ranging from 1200@xmath01800 k for _ _",
    "v__@xmath25 @xmath3150 km s@xmath4 and @xmath21150 k for _ _ v__@xmath25 @xmath21150 km s@xmath4 .",
    "the estimated temperature of the above highest - velocity bins in the b - nw lobe will be reduced to 400@xmath0500 k hence eliminating the above - mentioned temperature jump if the assumed co fractional abundance is lowered by a factor of 2 .",
    "the occurrence of abundance reduction may be attributed to partial dissociation or even ionization of co molecules under high - excitation conditions .",
    "a few factors may contribute to the uncertainty of the temperature estimates reported above .",
    "given the flux calibration uncertainty of 20% , the gas temperature obtained with lvg calculations would vary by a factor of 10 or so . in figure 4",
    ", we show with the blue - shaded area the 1-@xmath26 temperature range when allowing flux variations up to 20% in the b - nw lobe .",
    "although the temperature uncertainty appears fairly large , we emphasize that the general increasing trend of gas temperature with outflow velocity is indeed robust . for a given flux calibration error",
    ", the line ratios will be affected in the same way in all channels and render a simple temperature shift across all velocity bins . for the lvg calculations , variations in input parameters also lead to variations in the derived temperature by a similar factor and hence do not change the general increasing trend on temperature with gas velocity .",
    "for example , the derived temperature will decrease by about a factor of 3 if the adopted co fractional abundance is reduced by half or the velocity gradient increases twice .",
    "although variation in velocity gradient or co abundance across the line wings could mimic the derived temperature trend with velocity , the hubble - like kinematic feature shown in figure [ copv ] makes this confusion quite unlikely .",
    "a precise gas temperature estimate will need observations with better flux calibration .",
    "alternatively , observations in higher transitions of co will also help to constrain hot gas temperature .",
    "observations have shown that the kinetic temperature of high - velocity molecular gas in outflows associated with ysos can be as high as 100@xmath01000 k. for example , the inner sio knots in hh211 jet have a temperature excess of 300@xmath0500 k @xcite . in the case of extremely active molecular jets in l1448-mm , the kinetic temperature of the ehv bullets close to the yso is estimated to be @xmath3 500 k @xcite .",
    "gas temperature estimated from near - ir h@xmath27 observations typically ranges from 1000@xmath02500 k @xcite . both hot h@xmath27 emission and warm sio bullets are thought to trace shocked molecular gas .",
    "the broad velocity dispersions revealed from the kinematic structures of the ehv bullets further indicate their connections to ( bow ) shocks @xcite .",
    "could the heating of the ehv gas associated with g5.89 be dominated by shocks ?",
    "indeed , shock indicators have been detected around the highest velocity gas of the n - s and nw - se outflows @xcite .",
    "for example , as shown in figure [ co21mn0 ] the highest - velocity gas in the r - n lobe is associated with masers of h@xmath27o and class i ch@xmath28oh as well as h@xmath27 knots ( labeled as c1 and c2 by @xcite ) .",
    "furthermore , the positions of the highest velocity gas detected in the b - nw and b - s lobes coincide with the h@xmath27 knots b and group a , respectively , very well . the highest velocity in the b - nw lobe is also associated with masers of nh@xmath28 and class i ch@xmath28oh .",
    "the hot ( about 150 - 1800 k ) molecular gas in the highest - velocity bins of the n - s and nw - se outflows can be naturally interpreted as shock - heated gas , while the lack of velocity spread in the outflow tips ( figure [ copv ] ) can be attributed to insufficient sensitivity .    it is expected that the outflow driving process provides energetics to not only accelerate but also heat the ( ambient ) gas .",
    "estimations made from a simple jet - driven bow shock model predict temperature rising with outflow velocity and distance from the driving source @xcite , while such trends are different from the predictions of other classes of models @xcite .",
    "@xcite further argued that comparing with the molecular cooling mechanisms , the heating ( as a consequence of acceleration ) is sufficient to maintain outflowing gas temperature a few times higher than that of ambient materials . since the hubble - like kinematic structure can also be reproduced by the jet - driven bow shock model @xcite , all above - mentioned features of the ehv gas associated with g5.89 can be qualitatively interpreted by the jet - driven bow shock model .",
    "we note that most , if not all , available bow shock models have parameters typical of low - mass outflows .",
    "models with physical conditions more similar to outflows from high - mass young stars will be desired to have quantitative comparisons between observational results and model predictions .",
    "observations with better sensitivities and spatial resolutions are also essential to search for the bow shock signatures in both morphology and kinematics .",
