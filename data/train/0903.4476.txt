    "gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) are the most luminous explosions in the universe .",
    "they feature extremely relativistic outflows with bulk lorentz factors of @xmath6 and isotropic energies of @xmath7ergs .",
    "these energies are widely believed to be generated via the core - collapse of massive stars for conventional long(-duration ) grbs ( e.g. , @xcite ) or the merger of compact star binaries for conventional short(-duration ) grbs ( e.g. , @xcite ) . in the standard fireball model",
    "the prompt soft @xmath8-ray emission is powered by the collision of the material shells within the relativistic outflow ( i.e. , the internal shocks ) ; afterwards these material shells spread and merge into a single uniform outflow , continuing to move outwards ; then the long - lived x - ray , optical and radio afterglow emission is powered by the interaction of the overall outflow and the circum - burst medium ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "therefore , the temporal and spectral evolution of the multi - wavelength afterglow can be used to diagnose the underlying radiation mechanism and the profile of the circumburst medium ( e.g. , @xcite ) .    for short grbs ,",
    "the circum - burst medium is expected to be of the interstellar medium ( ism ) type or even of the intergalactic medium ( igm ) type , for which the number density is roughly constant and much lower than unity , being consistent with the current afterglow modeling ( see * ? ? ? * for a review ) . for long grbs , panaitescu & kumar ( 2002 )",
    "found that the afterglow modeling usually favors the constant density ( cd ) medium scenario , half cases in 10 bursts of a sample were better fitted by the cd medium while only one better described by a free wind ( fw ) medium . however , starling et al .",
    "( 2008 ) found that in 10 bursts of a sample , 4 were clearly in fw medium while only 1 consistent with cd medium .",
    "it seems that the circum - burst environments are unlikely to be drawn from only one of the cd or fw profile for long bursts .",
    "this is not obviously consistent with the collapsar model in which an ideal fw circum - burst medium would be created .",
    "the fw has a density profile @xmath9 , here @xmath10 is the parameter reflecting the density of the wind .",
    "one potential solution is that the ideal fw medium profile has been modified before the grb explosion .",
    "as is known , massive stars are believed to enter the wolf - rayet stage during their late evolution and have lost a major fraction of their masses in the form of the stellar wind .",
    "the interaction between this stellar wind and the surrounding medium creates a bubble structure ( e.g.,@xcite ) . in this scenario",
    "the free expanding supersonic wind is terminated at a radius @xmath11 cm , where the density jumps by a factor of 4 or more with the lower value expected for such an adiabatic shock . beyond the wind termination shock",
    "is the roughly constant density stalled wind , holding up to a rather large radius @xmath12 cm , outside this radius is the very dense swept - up ism ( the number density @xmath13 ) and then the ism .",
    "if the above picture is a good approximation of the circum - burst medium , it may be possible to observed afterglow signatures caused by the medium transition at @xmath14 or even at @xmath15 . in section 2 , we describe the signatures in grb afterglows for the first transition which is more easily observed and more of interest with respect to the second one .",
    "such a transition is possibly evident in grb050319 ( kamble et al .",
    "2007 ) and grb050904 ( gendre et al . 2007 ) . in section 3",
    ", we present the x - ray afterglow observations of grb081109a which leads to reach the conclusion that the fw - cd transition is quite clear in this event .",
    "the optical afterglow data are generally consistent with such a scenario . throughout this work we use the notation @xmath16 for the afterglow monochromatic flux as a function of time , where @xmath17 represents the observer s frequency",
    ", @xmath18 is the monochromatic flux decay index , and @xmath19 is the energy spectrum index . the convention @xmath20 has been adopted in cgs units .",
    "the grb afterglow emission in the cd or fw scenarios has been extensively discussed ( see zhang & meszaros 2004 for a review ) . we use the standard fireball afterglow theory with the simple microphysical assumptions of constant energy fractions imparted to the swept - up electrons , @xmath21 , and to the generated magnetic field , @xmath22 , respectively .",
    "the typical synchrotron radiation frequency @xmath23 and the cooling frequency @xmath24 are calculated in the standard way @xcite .",
    "both scenarios lead to the afterglow closure relations made of the temporal decay index @xmath18 and the spectral index @xmath19 , depending upon the spectral segment and the energy distribution index of @xmath25 of the swept - up electrons .",
    "usually the synchrotron self - absorption frequency , @xmath26 , is much lower than the optical band and thus neglected unless radio observation invoked .",
    "therefore , with good - quality temporal and spectral data , the circum - burst medium profile can be reliably constrained .",
    "we summarize the closure relation in table  [ table : closure ] apart from the @xmath27 cases ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    for the x - ray afterglow of our interest , there are two ways to diagnose the number density profile of the medium : + ( i ) when @xmath28 occurs , in the fw scenario the x - ray emission drops with time as @xmath29 while the optical emission drops faster by a factor of @xmath30 . on the contrary , in the cd scenario",
    "the optical emission drops more slowly than the x - rays .",
    "+ ( ii ) in the case of @xmath31 , i.e. , the x - ray emission is in the slow cooling phase , the temporal and spectral indices roughly satisfy @xmath32 in the fw scenario .",
    "then how does the afterglow evolve after the fw - cd transition at the radius @xmath33 ?",
    "it is known that the characteristic frequency @xmath23 decays with time as @xmath34 in both cd and fw scenarios .",
    "however , the cooling frequency @xmath24 evolves very differently . in the fw scenario it increases as @xmath35 but in the cd scenario it declines as @xmath36 .",
    "therefore , the following observational signatures would be evident before and after the transition . in case i ,",
    "the deceline of the x - ray emission remains unchanged while the optical decay becomes shallower by a factor of @xmath37 as long as the optical band is still below @xmath24 . in case",
    "ii , the x - ray decay will get flattened by a factor of @xmath37 as long as the x - ray band is still below @xmath24 .",
    "afterwards , when @xmath24 drops below the x - ray band , the x - ray decay steepens by a factor of @xmath38 . as we ll show in next section , the x - ray afterglow of grb081109a fits case ii .",

    "was needed in the modeling of the afterglow data of grb 050904 ( @xcite ) and grb050319 ( @xcite ) .",
    "the physical reason is that the cd medium has been heated by the termination reverse shock and then may be weakly magnetized .",
    "the optical data , though rare comparing with the x - ray ones , provide us a reliable test of the current afterglow model . as shown in fig.[fit ] , the h - band lightcurve is distinguished by a flat at early time and then a re - brightening at @xmath96 s. these features are generally consistent with our fw to cd medium model . in the fw medium , a flat segment is expected if the observer s frequency @xmath97 is above the synchrotron self - absorption frequency @xmath26 but below @xmath98 . in the cd medium ,",
    "a re - brightening is present if the relation @xmath99 still holds ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the re - brightening peaks when @xmath23 crosses the observer s frequency .",

    "the code used here to fit the x - ray light curves has been developed by @xcite , with small changes to adapt a density transition in surrounding medium .",
    "assuming a fw to cd medium transition , we find out that the observation data can be reasonably reproduced with the following parameters ( see fig.[fit ] and fig.[info ] ) : @xmath101erg , the initial lorentz factor @xmath102 , @xmath103 , @xmath104 , @xmath105 cm , @xmath106 , @xmath65 , @xmath107 and @xmath108 .",

    "@xmath111 and @xmath112 cm is lower than the typical value found in numerical simulations and may be due to a rapidly evolving wind of the progenitor close to the time of its core - collapse ( @xcite ) . assuming a redshift @xmath109 , the isotropic energy @xmath113 in the energy range of @xmath114 kev is about @xmath115ergs .",
    "the corresponding grb efficiency @xmath116 is @xmath117 .",
    "such a low efficiency , though not typical , is still reasonable , as found in previous estimates ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the observed optical flux is lower than the value extrapolated from x - ray observation , which implies that there is extinction in optical band . to agree with the optical observation ,",
    "our numerical fit for the @xmath118 and @xmath119 band has been adjusted by a factor of 0.3 , which requires about 1 mag extinction caused by the grb host galaxy at the observed @xmath118 and @xmath119 band .",
    "they are about 1 micron at the grb host galaxy .",
    "it essentially means e@xmath120 assuming milky way or smc extinction curves . with a galactic dust to gas",

    "the fit is shown in fig.[fit ] .",
    "the small differences around the termination radius may due to the sharp density jump we have assumed .",

    "when a grb jet finally enters into the very dense swept - ism region , strong reverse shock may be formed and an afterglow re - brightening is expected @xcite .",
    "the x - ray observation for grb081109a lasted to about @xmath133 s after the trigger and did not find obvious flux enhancement . in our numerical fit ,",
    "the jet front reached a radius @xmath134 cm at such a late time , much smaller than @xmath135 estimated by numerical simulations ( @xcite ) .",
    "so the grb outflow was still in the shocked wind material ejected in the wolf - rayet stage with an approximately constant density ( @xcite ) .",
    "although some grbs are inferred to occur in free stellar wind medium ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , most are inferred to occur in a medium with a constant number density ( even for some bursts associated with bright supernovae , see * ? ? ? * and the references therein ) , which may indicate that grb outflows expand into the wind bubble rather than the ideal free stellar wind .",
    "as shown in section 2 of this work , in some cases the x - ray afterglow data could shed light on the wind bubble structure .",
    "therefore the x - ray afterglow observation since the early time is required to trace the profile of the circum - burst medium . however , in many _",
    "swift _ grb events the early x - ray afterglow deviates from the standard afterglow model significantly ( @xcite ) . for instance , the prolonged activity of grb central engines would generate energetic x - ray flares that have outshone the regular forward shock emission ( e.g. , @xcite ) . fortunately , in grb081109a there is no flare accompanying the early x - ray afterglow .",
    "the temporal and spectral evolutions of the x - ray afterglow imply a medium transition at the radius @xmath136 cm ( see section 3 ) .",
    "such a small @xmath33 implies a small wind parameter @xmath53 and a large @xmath137 since @xmath138 where @xmath40 is the pressure in the shocked wind and @xmath139 is the boltzmann constant ( @xcite ) .",
    "indeed @xmath53 is found to be as small as @xmath140 in our numerical fit .",
    "grb081109a is thus a good candidate of long grbs born in wind bubble",
    ".    the rising behavior of the very early afterglow lightcurves can play an important role in probing the density profile of the medium .",
    "this is particularly the case if the reverse shock optical emission is very weak .",
    "as shown in @xcite and @xcite , in the free wind scenario the very early optical rise is usually not expected to be faster than @xmath37 while in the constant density medium the rise can be faster than @xmath141 .",
    "therefore the @xmath142-like rise in the early optical / infrared / x - ray afterglows of grb060418 , grb060607a ( @xcite ) , grb060801 , grb060926 , grb080319c , and grb080413b ( @xcite ) rules out the free wind medium for @xmath143 cm .",
    "thus the absence of the free wind signature in some grb afterglows is still a puzzle .",
    "one possible solution is that the mass loss rate due to the stellar wind before massive stars collapse is not a constant and might be much lower than previously assumed ( @xcite ) .",
