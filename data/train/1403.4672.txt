    "low mass x - ray binary ( lmxb ) is composed of a compact object ( neutron star or black hole ) accreting matter from its low mass companion star ( @xmath3 ) . according to the x - ray spectral proporties and rapid timing variabilities , the neutron star ( ns ) lmxbs are usually classified as the z sources and the atoll sources .",
    "they are named after the shapes which display in x - ray color - color diagram ( cd ) or hardness - intensity diagrams ( hid ) .",
    "the z sources produce approximate eddington luminosities with soft x - ray spectra , whereas atoll sources produce a lower luminosities in the range @xmath4 * ? ? ?",
    "a typical z source track shows three branches , from top to bottom , which are usually called the horizontal branch ( hb ) , the normal branch ( nb ) , and the flaring branch ( fb ; @xcite ) , respectively . for atoll sources , the three branches are called extreme island , island , and banana state .",
    "based on the orientation of branches , six typical z sources are further divided into the cyg- like z sources ( , and ) with a horizontal hb (  z \"- shaped tracks ) and the sco - like z sources ( , , and ) with a vertical hb (  @xmath5\"-shaped tracks ) .    the black hole ( bh ) and",
    "ns lmxbs show many similarities in their timing behaviors .",
    "low - frequency quasi - periodic oscillations ( lf - qpos ) are observed in z sources , atoll sources and bh lmxbs . in general , the centroid frequencies of lf - qpos are @xmath61 - 70 hz .",
    "the type c , b and a lf - qpos in bh lmxbs were considered as corresponding to hbos , nbos , fbos of z sources @xcite , respectively .",
    "moreover , the w - k relation , the strong correlation between the centroid frequency of lf - qpo and the break frequency in power density spectral , was identified in bh lmxbs , accreting millisecond pulsars and atoll sources @xcite .",
    "z sources show a similar but slightly shifted relation .",
    "these similar characteristics suggest that lf - qpos are likely produced from the same physical mechanism in lmxbs .",
    "lense - thirring precession was introduced to interpret hbos in ns lmxbs as well as type c lf - qpos in bh lmxbs @xcite . in this model",
    ", the lf - qpos were arisen from the misalignment between the compact star s spin axis and the rotational axis of the inner accretion disk @xcite .",
    "@xcite discussed the possible origin of hbo from hot inner flow precession .",
    "the evolution of accretion rate @xmath7 is studied from the hid of lmxb because it contains the variation of x - ray spectrum and radiation intensity . in bh lmxbs",
    ", @xmath7 increases in the following direction : the low hard state ( lhs )  the hard intermediate state ( hims )  the soft intermediate state ( sims )  the high - soft state ( hss ) @xcite",

    "the frequency of type c qpo positively correlates with accretion rate and energy flux @xcite .",
    "however , the evolution of accretion rate @xmath7 in the ns lmxbs is still controversial in the cyg - like and sco - like z sources .",
    "the ascending trend of accretion rate is not always consistent with the source intensity increasing direction in the hids . according to multi - wavelength campaigns of the classic z source cyg x-2 , accretion rate monotonically increases as hb - nb - fb @xcite .",
    "based on the boundary layer emission model , @xcite also found @xmath7 increasing from the hb to the fb in gx 340 + 0 .",
    "however , church and co - workers @xcite applied the extend adc model for the cyg - like z sources and suggested an opposite direction , i.e. , @xmath7 increases from the fb / nb vertex to the hb / nb vertex .",
    "@xcite considered that @xmath7 maintains constant along z tracks .",
    "for classical z sources , the frequency of hbo increased from hb to hb / nb vertex .",
    "so , three distinct correlations between the accretion rate and the frequency of hbo were proposed , that is , positive correlation , anticorrelation and non - correlation .",
    "the referred sources in the above works were analyzed either in the cyg - like source or in the sco - like source .",
    "the unique z source , , switched from a cyg - like z source to a sco - like z source at high luminosity and from z source to atoll source at low luminosity , which was observed by the rossi x - ray timing explorer ( rxte ) during its 2006 - 2007 outburst .",
    "the secular change of was driven by the accretion rate variation .",
    "@xcite studied the spectra evolutions of prudently , and suggested that the accretion rate @xmath7 maintains constant on the nb and fb of z sources .",
    "while on the hb , the @xmath8 correlation biased from the constant @xmath7 line because the disk component encountered a comptonization upscattering",
    ". the constant @xmath7 should be satisfied after the comptonization component accounted .",
    "in , the constant @xmath7 was also established @xcite .",
    "@xcite indicated that the accretion rate was invariant in the z sources and the oscillation of accretion rate @xmath7 produced the z tracks .",
    "however , @xcite concluded that the accretion rate of the disk follow @xmath9 after considering the magnetic field effect during the accretion .    in previous works , the relation between the spectra parameters and the characteristics of timing variability was not utilized to study the accretion rate variation . provides us a great opportunity to understand the temporal variabilities varying with the accretion rate evolution while the ns lmxb source transited from the cyg - like , via the sco - like z source , to an atoll source .",

    "each point represents 960 s duration in figure  [ fig4 ] .      to investigate the hbos for the intervals a and b and the hb / nb vertex , we extracted the light curves of channels 0 - 13 , 14 - 35 and 36 - 149 from sb_125us_0_13_1s , sb_125us_14_35_1s and e_125us_64m_36_1s , respectively .",

    "the choice of energy bands and their centroid energies are listed in table  [ tbl-2 ] .",
    "we created power density spectra ( pdss ) by using 16 s data segments for the full channel 0 - 149 and all sub - channel light curves .",
    "therefore , the fourier frequency is in the range 1/16 - 256 hz .",
    "a multi - lorentzian model is used to fit the pds . in figure",
    "[ fig5 ] , we show the pds with frequency - times - power representation ( @xmath12 ) of interval a. in order to obtain the best fitting result , four lorentzian components are needed @xcite .",
    "we obtain three characteristic frequencies of pds , which are the centroid frequency of hbo ( @xmath13 ) , the break frequency of low frequency noise ( @xmath14 ) and @xmath15 ( the frequency where the maximum of @xmath12 occurs , where @xmath16 is the full - width - half - maximum ( fwhm ) of the lorentzian component ) , respectively .",
    "we obtained the stages i - iii vertices and intervals a and b spectra with 16 s resolution from standard 2 model data and added a @xmath17 systematic error to each channel .",
    "we also extracted the hexte data from cluster b to study the high energy emission mechanism simultaneously .",
    "for the hexte data , we rebinned the spectra to obtain high s / n ratio . in the z stage of , @xcite fitted the spectral with the model * wabs(bbodyrad+diskbb+gaussian+cbpl ) * ( in xspec , hereafter model i ) , which accounted for the absorbed black body from the ns surface , the multi - color disk , the iron line , the comptonized component , respectively .",
    "suggested by @xcite , we fixed the hydrogen column density and the iron line width at @xmath18 and 0.3 kev respectively .",
    "for the constrained broken power law ( cbpl ) model , the break energy is fixed at 20 kev and the low energy photon index is set as 2.5 .",
    "we assume a 70 degree inclination and the source distance is 8.8 kpc with @xmath19 uncertainty@xcite .",

    "( 2012 ) provided opposite @xmath20 relations when the cbpl was replaced by the nthcomp in , i.e. , * wabs(bbodyrad+diskbb+gaussian+nthcomp ) * ( in xspec , hereafter model ii ) .",
    "therefore , we attempted to study the @xmath20 relation when these two different models were accounted for the comptonized component in .",

    "the apparent ns radius was derived from @xmath23 , where the @xmath24 is the normalization of blackbody component .",
    "it is noticeable that the inner radius from model ii in @xcite ( i.e. , marked as @xmath25 in their paper ) accounted the mcd component as well as the nthcomp component .",
    "we also attempted to account the high energy photon from nthcomp to obtain the refined inner disk radius .",
    "however , the inner disk radius did not vary significiantly after adding the nthcomp to mcd .",
    "hereafter , for both model i and model ii , the inner disk radius @xmath26 was deduced from @xmath27 , where the @xmath28 and @xmath29 are the normalization of mcd component and inclination angle , respectively .",
    "the individual component flux was integrated from the fitting model in the energy range @xmath63 - 60 kev .",

    "in figure  [ fig4 ] , the hb / nb and nb / fb vertex of the z source followed two straight lines in hid . in figure",
    "[ fig7 ] , we showed the black body component ( @xmath31 ) and the multi - color disk component ( @xmath32 ) as a function of total luminosity ( @xmath33 ) .",

    "both @xmath31 and @xmath32 increased with @xmath33 enhancement . for the nb / fb vertices",
    ", @xmath32 performed a similar behavior .",

    "we presented the disk accretion rate versus the inner disk radius in figure [ fig8 ] . for the hb / nb vertices ,",
    "the relation @xmath34 was obtained . however ,",
    "a more gradual relation was shown for the nb / fb vertices , @xmath35 .",
    "the obviously discrepancy of slop indicates that the accretion disk transfers from a slim disk in hb / nb vertex to a standard disk in nb / fb vertex @xcite .",
    "@xcite suggested that the disk accretion rate of hb / nb vertex could be traced by using @xmath36 in place of @xmath37 to take into account the comptonization emission in the hb .",
    "as we mentioned above , the @xmath38 component was ignored because of its faintness .",
    "hereafter , we adopted the disk accretion rate as @xmath39 , where we assumed the 1.4@xmath40 for the mass of neutron star and @xmath41 for the eddington accretion rate .",
    "the maximum @xmath42 is @xmath43 which located at the cyg - like stage .",
    "the total luminosity / disk accretion rate-@xmath42 relation of hb / nb vertex were displayed in figure  [ fig9 ] . with decreasing accretion rate ,",
    "the correlation coefficient between the total luminosity and the frequency of hbo is merely 0.36 .",
    "we used @xmath44 to fit the data from stage 1 and 2 displayed in figure  [ fig9 ] , and the least squared method was applied .",
    "then we obtained @xmath45 .",
    "we also discuss whether a constant model can fit better than the above model .",
    "we denote the above model as model 1 , and @xmath46 as model 2 . an approach to",
    "this question is using f - test .",
    "there are @xmath47 data points ( n=23 in our works ) to estimate parameters of model 1 and 2 .",
    "we can calculate @xmath48 statistic , which is @xmath49 , where , @xmath50 is the regression sum of squares of model @xmath29 , and @xmath51 is the residual sum of squares of model 2 . assuming the null hypothesis that model 1 does not provide a significantly better fitting than model 2 , the statistic @xmath48 will have f - distribution with degree of freedom of @xmath52 . for a given false - rejection probability ( eg . , @xmath53 ) , the null hypothesis is accepted if the statistic @xmath48 calculated from our data is less than the critical value of the @xmath48 distribution , @xmath54 . from our data",
    ", @xmath48 equals to 2.54 , which is less than @xmath55 .",
    "it means that model 1 does not provide a significantly better fit than model 2 .",
    "so , a constant model fits the data well enough .",
    "it means that the total luminosity as well as the disk accretion rate are independent with the hbo . in figure",
    "[ fig10 ] , we also show that the inner disk radius has no correlation to the @xmath42 at the hb / nb vertex .",
    "we fitted the hb of intervals a and b with model i and ii simultaneously .",
    "two models provided nearly the same results , which show positive @xmath56 relation in figure  [ fig8 ] . within these two models , @xcite offered two distinct opposite @xmath56 relations in .",
    "however , it was not appeared in our results .",
    "the presumable reason is that the comptonized component is relatively weak on hb in .",
    "since the maximum of the comptonized component occupies only 20% of the multi - color disk component in table  [ tbl-3 ] of our fitting results as well as in @xcite and @xcite , it could not strongly effect the @xmath56 relation .      from the energy spectral fitting by model",
    "i , the box 1 of interval a had minimum inner radius , which was roughly @xmath57 with 15% distance uncertainty accounted .",
    "causality , the radius of ns should be smaller than the minimum inner radius in accretion disk system .",
    "therefor , we utilized the minimum inner radius of accretion disk to constrain the upper radius of ns .",
    "the deduced inner radius depends on the inclination angle , which could not be directly measured in so far .",
    "however , the lack of dips / eclipses in the light curve of provided an upper limit of the inclination angle to a value close to 75 degrees @xcite . here , we plotted the upper limit of ns radius for a wide range of inclination angle in figure  [ fig11 ] .",
    "we computed the characteristic frequencies for the hb in intervals a and b and the hb / nb vertex in stages i - ii .",
    "the results accompany with data from @xcite displayed in figure  [ fig14 ] . at low frequency ( @xmath58 hz ) , the w - k relation of locates in the atoll sources region",
    ". however , at high frequency ( @xmath59 hz ) , the w - k relation of happens to locating between the z sources and the atoll sources .",
    "that is , follows a linear correlation between the break frequency and the hbo , without offset appearing .",
    "we studied the hbo - total flux dependence in both cyg - like phase and sco - like phase .",
    "the total flux was integrated in the energy range @xmath63 - 60 kev . in figure",
    "[ fig13 ] , the positive correlations between the frequency of hbo and the total flux were displayed .",
    "compared with the sco - like phase , the cyg - like phase showed more complicated correlation , that is , the frequency of hbo increases gradually at lower flux and smoothly at higher flux .      in order to investigate the energy dependence of hbo in interval a , we extracted six sub - bands and one full band lighcurves , and then fitted their pdss .",
    "when the @xmath42 is larger than 30 hz , we could not obtain high signal to noise ratio qpos in channel 0 - 10 , 11 - 13 and 36 - 149 . in our analysis , only upper hb regions ( i.e. , @xmath60 )",
    "were returned .",
    "the centroid frequency of full band and six subbands were derived . in left panels of figure  [ fig15 ] ,",
    "the qpo decreases with increasing photon energy . by using the bootstrap procedure , the correlation coefficients between the hbo frequency and energy",

    "all boxes show negative hbo - enenrgy correlations , but the boxes 1 and 5 have relatively large errors .",

    "the accretion rate @xmath7 played a leading role in the whole process . for",
    ", the nb / fb vertex was considered as reference position to trace accretion rate .",
    "however , we could not confirm the strength of accretion rate only from the source intensity in a single z track .",
    "the spectral state should be analyzed simultaneously .",
    "homan and co - workers @xcite argued that the accretion rate maintains constant along tracks in z stage of . @xcite considered the consequence of magnetic field during accretion and derived that @xmath66 . in this paper , we simultaneously studied the timing properties and spectral states on the relative regions ( the hb / nb vertex and the nb / fb vertex ) when the accretion rate decreased .",
    "we implemented a detailed temporal and spectral analysis of the hb / nb vertex and the nb / fb vertex in figure  [ fig4 ] .",
    "the hb / nb vertex and the nb / fb vertex trace two distinct lines in hid .",
    "their energy spectra can be well fitted by * wabs(diskbb+bbodyrad+gauss ) * without comptonization component . the inner radius and the apparent radius of ns can be deduced from normalizations of * diskbb * and * bbodyrad * respectively .",
    "the hb / nb vertices display @xmath67 relation , where the nb / fb vertices show a flatter trend , that is , @xmath68 .",
    "the hb / nb vertices have a slightly steeper @xmath69 relation compared with the nb / fb vertices , which indicate the accretion disk evolves from a slim disk to a standard disk @xcite because of decreasing accretion rate .",
    "since the disk accretion rate is proportional to @xmath70 , the disk accretion rate decreases with the luminosity decaying for the hb / nb vertices .",
    "the hb / nb vertices of stages i and ii present near 50 hz hbos with luminosity variation .",
    "we firstly conclude that the frequency of hbo is independent of the accretion rate or the source intensity , which might be applied in other z sources .",
    "this conclusion is obtained without prior model restriction .",

    "it spanned nearly three orders of magnitude in frequency .",
    "recently , the accreting millisecond pulsars were also found following this correlation @xcite .",

    "more interesting , the low characteristic frequencies locate in the atoll sources region . as mentioned above , the accretion rate in hb / nb vertex decreases towards lower source intensity in figure  [ fig4 ] . the well correlated w - k relation of hb / nb vertex in indicates that the characteristic frequencies on the hb are also not determined by the accretion rate .",
    "some other mechanisms , e.g. , the propagation of accretion flow instabilities @xcite , are presumably responsible for it .    the origin of lf - qpo is still puzzling .",

    "although the mechanism of type c qpo frequency - energy relation is still not known yet , the difference between the bh lmxbs and ns lmxbs may due to two reasons .",
    "the first is the affection of emission from ns surface which can cool down the corona comparable to the disk emission .",
    "the second is the central mass dependence of characteristic frequencies in the accretion flow as suggested by @xcite .    in the right panels of figure  [ fig15 ] , the rms of hbo increases with photon energy , from @xmath75 in 2 - 4.5 kev to @xmath76 in 9.4@xmath7714.8 kev , which indicates that the higher energy photon provide more contribution of hbo . from our fitting results ,",
    "the temperature of black body from ns surface is about @xmath78 and the temperature of multi - color disk is about @xmath79 , which are much less than @xmath80 of the maximum rms of hbo occurring .",
    "the amplitude of hbos as well as hard color dropped from upturn to hb @xcite , meanwhile , the strengh of the comptonization emission also became fainter from our spectral fitting results . on the nb , the inverse compton process turned into undetectable , while hbo disappeared simultaneously .",
    "the hb / nb vertex could be considered as a spectral state transition zone , where the spectral switched from a non - thermal emission contained state to a thermal emission completely dominated state .",
    "this feature of spectral transition also exhibited in gx 17 + 2 .",

    "if the normalization of comptoniztion component did not change significantly , the hbo in cyg x-2 and 4u 1728 - 34 were also anti - correlated with comptonization emission strength . based on the above observational evidences , we interpret that the hbo possibly arise in the corona , where the hbo generate in the process of comptonization emission @xcite . the frequency and rms of hbo maybe associate with the scale as well as the optical depth of corona region , respectively .",
