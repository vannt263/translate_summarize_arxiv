    "communication receivers are often based on digital signal processing , where the analog received signal is quantized into finite number of bits using analog - to - digital converters ( adc ) whose outputs are then processed in digital domain .",
    "these adcs are expected to operate at high speeds in order to meet the increasing throughput and bandwidth requirements . however , at high conversion speeds , the precision of adcs is typically low which results in loss of system performance @xcite . for example , low - precision receiver quantization can cause floors in the bit error performance @xcite,@xcite .",
    "also , it has been shown that in a single - input single - output ( siso ) point - to - point single user system with additive white gaussian noise ( awgn ) , low - precision receiver quantization results in significant loss of capacity when compared to an unquantized receiver @xcite .",
    "motivated by the increasing need to investigate the effect of receiver quantization in high - throughput communication , we , in this paper , address the issue of characterizing the achievable rate region of two different gaussian multiuser channels , namely ,    1 .",

    "gbc comes under the class of degraded broadcast channels , for which capacity is known . for a two - user gbc",
    ", it is known that the capacity is achieved when superposition coding is done at the transmitter assuming that the users messages are from gaussian distribution , and , at the receiver , the high snr user does successive decoding and the low snr user decodes its message alone considering the other user s message as noise @xcite .",

    "recently , achievable rate region for two - user gbc when the input messages are from finite signal sets and the received signals are _",
    "unquantized _ has been studied in @xcite , and it is referred to as the constellation constrained ( cc ) capacity of gbc @xcite .",
    "our present contribution first gives achievable rate region for two - user qbc in section [ sec_qbc ] .",
    "the main results on qbc are summarized as follows .    *",
    "the capacity region defined for a gbc does not carry over as such to qbc .",
    "* once quantization is done at the receiver in a gbc , the channel is no more degraded .",
    "therefore , the optimal decoding scheme for gbc ( i.e. , high snr user alone doing successive decoding ) does not necessarily result in achievable rate pairs for qbc .",
    "* we then propose achievable rate region for qbc based on two different schemes ( scheme 1 and scheme 2 ) . in scheme 1 ,",
    "user 1 will do successive decoding and user 2 will not , whereas , in scheme 2 , user 2 will do successive decoding and user 1 will not .",
    "in addition to this , in both the schemes , the message for the user which does not do successive decoding is coded at such a rate that the message of that user can be decoded error free at both the receivers .",
    "* rotation of one of the user s input alphabet with respect to the other user s alphabet marginally enlarges the achievable rate region of qbc when almost equal powers are allotted to both the users .",
    "next , in section [ sec_qmac ] , we address the achievable rate region of two - user qmac . with finite input alphabets and an _ unquantized _ receiver ,",
    "the two - user gmac rate region has been studied in @xcite . in @xcite , in terms of the achievable rate region , it was shown that , compared to having both the users transmit using the same finite signal set , it is better to have the second user transmit using a rotated version of the first user s signal set .",
    "we refer to the two - user gmac system model in @xcite ( with finite input alphabet and no output quantization ) as constellation constrained mac ( ccmac ) .    in this paper , instead of assuming an unquantized receiver",
    "as was done in @xcite , we consider quantized receiver .",
    "since uniform quantizers are commonly used in communication receivers , we first consider uniform quantization at the receiver , and show that with uniform quantization , there is a significant reduction in the achievable rate region compared to the ccmac rate region .",
    "this is due to the fact that the received analog signal is densely distributed around the origin , and is therefore not efficiently quantized with a uniform quantizer .",
    "this then motivates us to propose a _ non - uniform quantizer _ with finely spaced quantization intervals near the origin .",
    "we show that the proposed non - uniform quantizer results in enlargement of the achievable rate region of two - user qmac compared to that achieved with a uniform quantizer .",
    "it is further observed that , with increasing number of users , the probability distribution of the received analog signal is more and more dense around the origin .",
    "hence , it is expected that with increasing number of users , larger enlargement in rate region of qmac may be achieved with non - uniform quantization compared to uniform quantization .",
