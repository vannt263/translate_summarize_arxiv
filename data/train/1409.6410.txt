    "quantum computers exploit the coherent superposition nature of quantum states and involve numerous phase - sensitive manipulations @xcite .",
    "insofar as quantum algorithms , such as shor s factorization @xcite and grover s search @xcite , involve a great number of phase gates , the accuracy of the latter is of crucial importance for high - fidelity quantum information processing .",
    "as far as a phase shift of @xmath2 is concerned the simplest approach is to use a resonant @xmath3 pulse that couples one of the qubit states with an ancilla state . a variable phase shift @xmath1 ,",
    "however , requires a field with a suitable detuning , intensity and duration ; such a variable phase shift is required , for example , for the construction of conditional quantum gates and the quantum fourier transform @xcite .",
    "there are two major types of phase gates : dynamic @xcite and geometric @xcite .",
    "the dynamic phase gate benefits from the simplicity of implementation because it requires just a single far - off - resonant pulsed field , which determines its wide - spread use .",
    "the geometric phase gate has certain advantages in terms of robustness against parameter fluctuations , which come at the cost of more demanding implementations .",
    "an alternative phase gate uses adiabatic passage and relative laser phases @xcite .    in the present paper",
    "we propose a different approach to construct a phase gate with an arbitrary phase .",
    "our method is based on the use of composite pulses ( cps ) @xcite , which are a powerful method for quantum state control .",
    "cps combine high accuracy of manipulation with robustness to variations of the interaction parameters .",
    "a cp is a sequence of pulses with suitably chosen relative phases .",
    "these phases are used as control parameters to correct the errors which emerge in the interaction between a single pulse and a qubit .",
    "the vast majority of cps are designed to produce complete or partial population transfer in two - state or multi - state quantum systems . here",
    "we show how cps can be used to produce well - defined phase shifts of the two states of a qubit .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "first , we start with a brief overview of the theory of cps and we show how cps can be derived .",
    "then we explain how cps can be used to produce broadband ( bb ) , adiabatic , and universal robust phase gates , which are insensitive to various types of experimental errors .",
    "then we test the performance of the proposed gates in terms of fidelity and robustness .",
    "let us consider a two - state quantum system ( a qubit ) , in a general state @xmath4 , interacting with an external coherent field . our goal is to create a phase gate , which is defined as an operation which changes the phase difference between @xmath5 and @xmath6 by some predefined amount @xmath1 .",
    "in a matrix form it can be written as [ phase gate ] = . in order to achieve this",
    ", we are going to use the powerful method of cps .",
    "to explain the idea of cps , we first note that the evolution of our qubit is described by the schrdinger equation , i_t(t)=(t)(t ) , where @xmath7^t$ ] is a column vector with the probability amplitudes of the two states @xmath8 and @xmath9 .",
    "the hamiltonian after the rotating wave approximation @xcite reads ( t ) = ( /2 ) ( t ) ^-id(t ) |_1_2| + , with @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is the detuning between the field frequency @xmath12 and the bohr transition frequency @xmath13 .",
    "the rabi frequency @xmath14 is a measure of the field - system interaction : for laser - driven electric - dipole atomic transitions , @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is the laser electric - field envelope and @xmath17 is the transition dipole moment of the atom .",
    "it is convenient to describe the evolution of the quantum system by means of the propagator @xmath18 , which connects the probability amplitudes at any time @xmath19 to their initial values at time @xmath20 : @xmath21 .",
    "a general @xmath22 unitary propagator is parameterized by the cayley - klein parameters @xmath23 and @xmath24 as [ u ] = .",
    "a constant phase shift @xmath25 in the driving field , @xmath26 , is mapped onto the propagator as [ uph ] ( ) = .",
    "if we have a sequence of @xmath27 identical pulses , each with a phase @xmath28 , we obtain a cp whose effect upon the quantum system is described by the propagator ^(n)=(_n)(_2)(_1 ) . if now the phases @xmath28 are chosen appropriately , the propagator @xmath29 can be made much more robust to variations in the experimental parameters than the single - pulse propagator @xmath30 .",
    "this is the basic idea behind cps and in such way one can produce a huge variety of broadband @xcite , narrowband @xcite , and passband @xcite cps with respect to variations in essentially any experimental parameter .",
    "in this section we show how the phase gate can be constructed as a sequence of two cps , with a fixed phase difference between them . in order to explain the idea , we first consider a simple sequence of two single pulses , wherein the second one has a relative phase @xmath31 with respect to the first one . by using the single - pulse propagators and we find that for the sequence of two pulses , the total propagator is @xmath32.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] this simple expression reveals the idea of the phase gates proposed here : if each of the two single pulses is such that it causes complete population transfer ( @xmath33 and hence @xmath34 ) and if we choose the phase @xmath31 of the second pulse to be equal to @xmath0 , we obtain for the total propagator @xmath35 , which is exactly the phase gate defined by eq .  .",
    "this can be achieved by a sequence of two resonant pulses , for which the cayley - klein parameters are @xmath36 , @xmath37 , where @xmath38 is the pulse area .",
    "if we choose the area @xmath38 to be equal to @xmath2 , we obtain @xmath33 and the total propagator is exactly the phase gate of eq .  .",
    "this scheme , despite being quite simple and natural , has the same drawbacks as the single @xmath2 pulses , regarding the lack of robustness against variations of the interaction parameters .",
    "however , it is possible to overcome these shortcomings by replacing the two single @xmath2 pulses with two identical broadband cps ; then the cayley - klein parameters @xmath23 and @xmath24 are determined by each of these cps .",
    "each of the two cps is robust against variations in one or more experimental parameters and hence , we obtain a robust phase gate .",
    "explicitly , the total propagator reads [ phase gate propagator ] _ = _ _ 2__1 ,",
    "where [ cp1&cp2 ] @xmath39 and [ phases second cp ] _",
    "k = _ k++/2 .",
    "since the phases @xmath28 and @xmath40 are connected with this simple relation , from now on we will only refer to @xmath41 .",
    "the phases @xmath41 are chosen in such a way that they produce robust propagators @xmath42 and @xmath43 , which are insensitive to variations in different experimental parameters .",
    "it is straightforward to verify that if each of the two cps of eqs .   and produces complete population inversion up to the order @xmath44 , i.e. @xmath45 , where @xmath46 is the deviation from the desired value of some interaction parameter , then the composite phase gate of eq .",
    "will produce the desired target phase gate of eq .   with the same accuracy @xmath47 .",
    "in other words , the composite phase gate is accurate to the same order as the two composite @xmath2 pulses that it is composed of .",
    "depending on which type of cps we use , we can produce different types of phase gates . for example , a phase gate that is insensitive to errors in the pulse area can be produced by using bb cps , which are robust against variations in the pulse area too . in a similar way we can produce phase gates that are robust against any single parameter , or even such phase gates that are robust against _ all _ experimental parameters . in the next section",
    ", we will study these cases more closely .    in order to test the performance of our phase gates",

    ", @xmath51 , @xmath52 and @xmath53 .",
    "the target phase is @xmath54 ( left frames ) and @xmath55 ( right frames ) .",
    "the lower frames show the same infidelities as the upper frames , but in a logarithmic scale.,width=321 ]    a phase gate , which is robust against errors in the pulse area , is produced by using a sequence of two area - compensating cps .",
    "numerous such cps have been proposed and demonstrated in the literature @xcite .",
    "we use here the symmetric resonant cps that we have derived recently @xcite ; their phases are given by the analytic formula @xcite [ bbphases ] _ k = k(k-1 ) ( k=1,2,  ,n ) , where @xmath27 is the number of pulses , used in the cp .",
    "explicitly , the phases of the first few cp pulses are ( modulo @xmath3 ) @xmath56 the phases of the second cp are found from here and eq .  .",
    "these phases allow to suppress the error in the transition probability up to order @xmath57 where @xmath46 is the deviation of the pulse area @xmath38 from @xmath2 , @xmath58 . obviously , the total number of pulses needed for the composite phase gate is @xmath59 . as an example , for @xmath51 , the total number of pulses is @xmath60 and the relative phases are ( 0,,0 , + , + , + ) .",
    "figure  [ fidelitybb ] shows the infidelity of our composite phase gate as a function of the pulse area of the pulses in the sequence for target phases @xmath54 and @xmath55 .",
    "these phase gates are the most widely used ones in quantum information processing @xcite .",
    "we see that by increasing the number of pulses in the two cps , which compose the phase gates , the phase gates get increasingly robust to variations in the pulse area .       and",
    "@xmath52 , compared with the infidelity , produced by a sequence of two single ( non - composite ) chirped pulses .",
    "we use hyperbolic - secant pulses , @xmath61 , and hyperbolic - tangent detuning , @xmath62 , where @xmath63 is the peak rabi frequency , @xmath64 is the chirp rate and @xmath65 is the pulse duration .",
    "we have used chirp rate @xmath66 .",
    "the target phase is @xmath54 ( top frame ) and @xmath55 ( bottom frame).,width=264 ]    it was demonstrated in @xcite that cps can be used to improve the adiabatic passage by using a sequence of phase - shifted chirped pulses .",
    "it was shown that the composite phases do not depend on the particular shape of the pulse and the chirp , but only demand symmetric rabi frequency and antisymmetric detuning .",
    "the analytic formula for the phases is the same as the one for the bb pulses , eq .  .",
    "in fig .  [ fidelitycap ] we compare the infidelities of the composite adiabatic phase gates for @xmath51 and @xmath52 with the single - pulse adiabatic phase gate ( @xmath67 ) .",
    "we conclude that the composite adiabatic phase gate is extremely robust against variations in the peak rabi frequency , which is due to the high fidelity and robustness of the composite adiabatic passage @xcite .      ) and for a sequence of two cps with @xmath52 and @xmath53 .",
    "the composite phases are given by eq .  .",
    "the target phase is @xmath54 ( top frame ) and @xmath55 ( bottom frame).,width=264 ]    another major type of cps are the ones which stabilize the excitation profile with respect to the frequency detuning from exact resonance .",
    "these can be used to construct detuning - compensated composite phase gates .",
    "we have derived earlier @xcite several detuning - compensated cps , [ cp detuning ] @xmath68 the first , second and third cps of these produce a unit transition probability around single pulse areas of @xmath2 , @xmath69 , and @xmath70 , respectively .",
    "the detuning - compensated composite phase gates are obtained by using eqs .   and .",
    "for example , the six - pulse phase gate reads ( 0,,0 , + , + , + ) ,    in fig .",
    "[ fidelitydelta ] we plot the simulated infidelity of such gates .",
    "it is evident from the figure that the phase gates are robust against variations in the detuning , which makes the method very useful for applications in situations , when exact resonance is not possible ( for instance , in the presence of inhomogeneous broadening or doppler shift ) .",
    "if we want to achieve compensation of errors in more than one parameter , we need to use cps , which are robust against variations in several parameters , for instance pulse area and detuning @xcite . in the next subsection",
    "we examine the cases when a more general compensation of errors is possible .      .universal",

    "the composite phases are @xmath71 .",
    "the target phase is @xmath55.,width=302 ]    recently , genov @xcite derived cps , which compensate errors in any parameter of the driving field .",
    "this is done by using the most general parametrization of the propagator , without any assumptions for the properties of the constituent pulses and their parameters , which justifies the term `` universal '' cps .",
    "the phases of the lowest - order universal cps are given in table [ table : universal ] . by using these universal cps",
    ", we can build a universal phase gate , which is insensitive , up to a certain order , to any experimental error of the driving field .",
    "for example , the six- and ten - pulse composite phase gates read @xmath72 where _ a _ and _ b _ refer to different universal cp solutions @xcite .    in fig .",
    "[ fidelityuni ] , we test the performance of the universal phase gates by plotting the infidelity as a function of the pulse duration and the detuning .",
    "we see that by using the single - pulses approach , it is almost impossible to achieve high fidelity , while universal cps deliver quite large high - fidelity areas of @xmath73 , and even areas of ultrahigh fidelity @xmath74 .",
    "we have presented an approach to construct high - fidelity error - resistant composite phase gates for quantum information processing .",
    "these phase gates are formed by two identical composite @xmath2 pulses , the second of which is shifted by phase @xmath0 with respect to the first .",
    "the properties of these cps are directly transferred to the composite phase gate .",
    "for example , a composite @xmath2 pulse , which compensates errors in the pulse area to a certain order @xmath44 , produces a composite phase gate , which compensates errors in the pulse area to the same order @xmath44 .",
    "of special interest are the universal phase gates , which compensate errors in all field parameters ( pulse duration , pulse amplitude , detuning , unwanted chirp , stark shift , etc . ) .",
    "we note that these universal cps have the huge practical advantage that they simultaneously compensate all kinds of errors , even unknown ones , as far as the evolution is coherent and hence unitary ( no losses to other states ) .",
    "however , if we wish robustness against a single parameter , e.g. pulse area or detuning , then better performance is provided by the dedicated cp , which compensates this particular error .",
