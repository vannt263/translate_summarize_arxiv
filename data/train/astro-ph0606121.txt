    "despite the stunning success of the radial velocity ( rv ) technique in finding extrasolar planets ( e.g. mayor & queloz 1995 ) , which resulted in the discovery of more than @xmath11 planetary companions over the past decade , our understanding of planet formation is far from complete .",
    "we are especially lacking a general overview of the frequency of planetary companions to stars throughout the entire hr - diagram .",
    "doppler surveys have traditionally targeted bright solar type main sequence stars and it is no big surprise that most planets were found around g - type stars .",
    "but , is this entirely a result of an observational bias , or is it a true effect which could lead to a better understanding of the underlying physics of planet formation ?    the majority of the stars in the solar neighborhood are m  dwarf stars with masses of @xmath12 or less ( henry  1998 ) . in order to determine the overall galactic population of planets it is important not to `` overlook '' the faint and low mass regime of the hr - diagram and to control observational biases in order to arrive at statistically meaningful results . because of the intrinsic faintness of m dwarfs it is generally more difficult and time consuming to achieve the high quality rv data for the detection of planetary companions .",
    "this led to the situation that m dwarfs constitute only small subsets in the target samples of most precision doppler surveys .",
    "so far , we know of only one m dwarf , gj  876 ( m4  v , m=@xmath13 ) , to harbor a planetary system with jupiter - mass companions ( delfosse et al .  1998 ; marcy et al .  1998 ; marcy et al",

    "none of the m dwarfs surveyed by our programs reveal an increased rv scatter which can be attributed to keplerian reflex motion caused by a jovian planetary companion with @xmath37 .",
    "with this null result in hand , what kind of conclusions can we draw about the frequency of giant planets orbiting m dwarfs ?",
    "we follow the procedure outlined in the appendix of burgasser et al .",
    "( 2003 ) and mccarthy & zuckerman ( 2004 ) and estimate the companion frequency @xmath2 by using the binominal distribution :    @xmath38    @xmath39 is the probability that an ideal survey of @xmath40 targets will yield a detection rate @xmath41 , for a true frequency of companions @xmath2 .    for the estimation of the m dwarf planet frequency we remove gj  623 from the sample , as it is a short period binary with an eccentric orbit . using only the remaining m dwarf sample ( number of stars @xmath42 and detections @xmath43 )",
    "we find @xmath44% ( see fig .  [ prob ] ) .",
    "the error bar denotes the area of @xmath45% integrated probability ( i.e. @xmath46 confidence ) . at this confidence level",
    "we thus derive an upper limit for @xmath2 of @xmath47% .",
    "of course , no real survey is an ideal survey .",
    "we estimate the completeness of our m dwarf survey by using numerical simulations . we start with the null hypothesis that the observed scatter represents the distribution of our measurement errors ( i.e. that no additional signal is buried in the data ) . for each star",
    "we then add keplerian signals to our data ( at the times of observation ) and compare the resulting new rms scatter with the originally observed value .",
    "if the f - test shows a probability of less than @xmath48 that these two variances are drawn from two different samples , the planetary companion corresponding to the input signal is declared as `` missed '' by our program . for each period and amplitude we compute keplerian signals at @xmath49 different orbital phases and for eccentric orbits for each phase at @xmath49 different periastron angles .",
    "this results in @xmath50 simulated planets per period , amplitude and target .",
    "the amplitude of the input signal is increased until a certain overall threshold ( e.g. less than @xmath51 or @xmath52 of all planets are missed ) is reached .",
    "[ sens1 ] displays the survey sensitivity determined by this method for the case of circular orbits with semi - major axes @xmath53 to @xmath54  au .",
    "the limits shown in the figure are for @xmath55 , @xmath9 , @xmath5 and @xmath48 survey completeness . to transform the amplitude information into a mass value we adopt a primary mass of @xmath12 .",
    "note that the mass limits for the planets are conservative upper limits because for less massive stars these companion mass values would be lower . for less massive m dwarfs this diagram would also move inwards ( in terms of orbital semi - major axis ) , because companions around less massive stars orbit closer to the primary at a given orbital period .",
    "based on these results we find that we have a @xmath9 efficiency to notice all planets with @xmath56 at @xmath57  au and of @xmath5 for all @xmath58 companions at these orbital separations . with the exception of a sharp spike up to @xmath59 at @xmath60",
    "au we are @xmath48 complete for all planets with @xmath61 at @xmath57  au . for periods close to 1 year ( @xmath62  au for a @xmath12 star ) the efficiency drops rapidly due to the window function : @xmath55 of all planets with @xmath63 and @xmath9 of all @xmath64 companions .",
    "orbital eccentricity decreases the survey sensitivity further , because a doppler survey can easily miss critical orbital phases of eccentric orbits due to sparse sampling and the star can thus appear to be rv constant .",
    "we repeated the simulations with an orbital eccentricity of @xmath8 ( which would include the majority of known extrasolar planets ) and the results are displayed in fig .",
    "[ sens2 ] . for orbital separations of @xmath7",
    "au we are @xmath9 complete for planets with @xmath65 and @xmath5 for @xmath66 .",
    "again , the survey efficiency drops rapidly for periods close to 1 year .",
    "marcy et al . ( 2005 ) find a frequency of @xmath67 of `` hot jupiters '' with @xmath68  au around fgk - type stars and according to their fig.2 a frequency of @xmath69 of planets with @xmath70  au . while the frequency of  hot jupiters  is still consistent with our results",
    ", it appears that there is a difference emerging between the detection rate of jovian planets with @xmath70  au around fgk - type stars and m dwarfs .",
    "also butler et al .",
    "( 2004 ) noted that the combined results from all radial velocity planet search programs , which include m dwarfs in their target samples , point toward an upper limit for @xmath2 of @xmath71 .",
    "lineweaver & grether ( 2003 ) presented an analysis and extrapolation of the planet frequency for fgk - type stars currently monitored by doppler surveys .",
    "they find that the fraction of detected planets increases from @xmath72 for a survey duration of 2 years to @xmath73 for a 4 year survey . again",
    ", both values are higher than the upper limit we find . however , our upper limit of @xmath74 for m dwarf planets is only valid in the planet mass - separation range , to which our program is most sensitive ( with a @xmath75 completeness , see fig .",
    "[ sens1 ] and fig .  [ sens2 ] ) .",
    "but , also fgk - star surveys are not ideal surveys and they miss a small fraction of planets .",
    "gaudi et al .",
    "( 2002 ) also finds a low frequency for jupiter - mass companions around m dwarfs in the galactic bulge based on the results of the planet microlensing survey .",
    "however , one has to bear in mind that the planet survey samples a different region of our galaxy and a comparison with the solar neighborhood could be inadequate .",
    "a general observational bias as explanation for a lower m dwarf jovian planet frequency becomes increasingly unlikely but is not completely ruled out .",
    "doppler surveys of fgk - type stars usually have a higher rv precision than m dwarf programs .",
    "the bias introduced by a somewhat lower rv precision for m dwarfs is partly compensated by the fact that the rv amplitudes induced by giant planets around m dwarfs are larger because of the lower mass of the host star and thus easier to detect .",
    "using large aperture telescopes allows us to overcome their intrinsic faintness and to obtain high quality rv data also for these late spectral types .",
    "continuation , improvement and expansion of current m dwarf doppler surveys is necessary to allow a better determination of the planet frequency around these stars and to perform a more detailed comparison with the results from the fgk - star surveys .",
    "another issue which could still lead to an unintentional observational bias in our m dwarf sample is stellar metallicity . in recent years , it has became more and more obvious that the frequency of detectable planets is a function of the metal content of the stars included in doppler surveys ( fischer & valenti  2005 ; santos , israelian , & mayor  2004 ) .",
    "metal poor stars appear to harbor fewer planets detectable by the rv technique ( close in massive planets ) than metal rich stars .",
    "this could mean that the formation mechanism is somehow linked to the metal content in the protoplanetary disk ( at least for the stars included in these surveys ) .",
    "is it possible that we mostly targeted metal poor m dwarfs and that this is the reason for the observed low planet frequency ?",
    "our het and vlt samples are biased toward inactive and thus presumably older m dwarfs .",
    "thus , it is conceivable that the majority of these m dwarfs are metal poor . a survey including also more active m dwarfs as well as the determination of the metallicities of the targets can solve this issue . unfortunately , there are no large scale spectroscopic surveys to determine precise metallicities of m dwarfs , although there are efforts under way to find suitable techniques ( e.g. valenti et al .",
    "woolf & wallerstein  ( 2005 ) presented [ fe / h ] measurements for 35 m and k dwarfs .",
    "three m dwarfs from our sample , gj  411 , gj  412  a , and gj  687 are included in their study .",
    "they find that gj  411 and gj  412  a are metal poor ( @xmath76}\\approx-0.4 $ ] ) , while gj  687 is metal rich ( @xmath76}\\approx0.15 $ ] ) .",
    "iron abundances for three more stars ( gj  15  a , gj  109 , gj  849 ) of our sample are estimated by bonfils et al .",
    "( 2005a ) .",
    "these authors used visual binaries with m dwarf secondaries to calibrate a photometric method to derive m dwarf metallicities .",
    "gj  15  a ( @xmath76}\\approx-0.45 $ ] ) and gj  109 ( @xmath76}\\approx-0.2 $ ] ) turn out to be metal poor stars , while gj  849 ( @xmath76}\\approx0.14 $ ] ) has a higher than solar iron abundance . so far , four out of six target stars with [ fe / h ] measurements thus turn out to be metal poor stars .",
    "a detailed determination of the metallicity of our sample stars using the method of bean et al .",
    "( 2005 ) is currently in progress .",
    "the hyades m dwarfs are of course young and active stars .",
    "they should have a similar metal content as the cluster mean of [ fe / h ] = @xmath77 ( paulson , sneden , cochran  2003 ) .",
    "but the small number of m dwarfs included in the overall hyades sample prevents a meaningful comparison with the planet frequency of earlier type stars in that metallicity range .    how do our observations agree with current models for planet formation ?",
    "laughlin , bodenheimer & adams  ( 2004 ) explored the formation of gas giants around m dwarfs within the framework of the core accretion model ( e.g. pollack et al .",
    "these authors conclude that this model has severe problems in forming jupiter - class planets in the less massive protoplanetary disks of m dwarfs .",
    "also , ida & lin  ( 2005 ) show that close - in jovian planets should be relatively rare around m dwarfs .",
    "our data confirm so far their theoretical prediction that m dwarfs should harbor fewer gas giant planets . on the other hand ,",
    "boss  ( 2006 ) shows that the gravitational instability model has a higher efficiency in forming giant planets in less massive m dwarf disks .",
    "gj  876 remains the only unambiguous case of an m dwarf orbited by jupiter - mass planetary companions despite the accumulation of high quality rv data for more m dwarfs over the past years .",
    "so what makes gj  876 so special ? at the moment we can only speculate that gj  876 had either a more massive disk than other m dwarfs , albeit for unknown reasons , or these planets indeed formed by gravitational instability .",
    "as suggested by boss  ( 2006 ) , m dwarfs could be a used as a test ground for competing giant planet formation models .    in the case that orbital migration ( e.g. lin et al .",
    "1996 ) results in the observed small semi - major axes for many of the planets detected by doppler surveys , we can pose the question of whether this mechanism might be less efficient for m dwarfs .",
    "this would explain the current null detections ( again with the exception of gj  876 ) because high quality rv data for most m dwarfs do not have sufficient time coverage to find ( or exclude ) jupiter - type companions in long periodic orbits .",
    "in our sample we do observe rv trends indicating more distant companions , but most of them are quite large and most likely caused by stellar companions .",
    "highly precise astrometric studies using data from the upcoming space interferometry mission ( sim ) should allow the detection of planets at large orbital separations around nearby m dwarfs .",
    "firm upper limits from astrometry have been placed by benedict et al .",
    "( 1999 ) on the masses of planetary companions in the period range from @xmath78 to @xmath79 days , orbiting barnard s star and proxima centauri , using hst fine guidance sensor data .",
    "benedict et al .  ( 2002 ) succeeded in detecting the astrometric perturbation caused by the outermost planet in the gj  876 system , and derived a mass for the companion of @xmath80 .    despite their lack of close - in jovian planets ,",
    "m dwarfs remain attractive targets for current doppler surveys . because of",
    "their low primary masses the rv amplitude induced by an orbiting companion is higher than for f , g , or k type stars .",
    "the discovery of planets with extremely low masses ( a few @xmath81 ) using precise radial velocity measurements is feasible in the m dwarf regime ( e.g. krster et al . 2003 ) .",
    "model calculations ( e.g. wetherill  1996 ; laughlin et al .  2004 ) also show no difficulties in forming low mass planets via planetesimal accretion in disks around m dwarfs .",
    "ida & lin ( 2005 ) even predict a higher frequency of icy giant planets with masses comparable to neptune in short periodic orbits for m dwarfs than for g type stars .",
    "the lowest mass extrasolar planet our group has found so far is the fourth companion in the @xmath82  cnc ( g8  v ) system ( mcarthur et al .",
    "the rv semi - amplitude induced by this planet is only @xmath83 and hence a difficult signal to detect . if the same planet ( @xmath84 ) were to orbit a high mass m dwarf ( @xmath12 ) the rv semi - amplitude would increase to @xmath85 and for proxima centauri ( m5  v , @xmath86 ) the signal would be @xmath87 . the discoveries of the short - period neptunes by butler et al .",

    "the nasa kepler mission ( borucki et al .  2003 ) , planned for launch in late 2008 , should give much better insight into the true frequency of short - period planets ( @xmath89 year ) around m  dwarfs , provided a sufficiently large sample of m dwarfs is included in the kepler target list .",
    "m  dwarfs are particularly good targets for large photometric transit surveys such as kepler because their significantly smaller radius than solar - type stars results in a much larger photometric signal for a given planet size .",
