    "in the present article , we are concerned with gauge theories in a discretized formulation on some sort of lattice , triangulation or cellular decomposition .",
    "this includes the standard formulation of lattice gauge theory , see , for example  @xcite , but we can also think of a smooth manifold with a large collection of embedded curves and surfaces on which we place the variables of the theory .",
    "the main point is that we keep group elements for the parallel transports along the curves , but that we do not pass to the differential picture and do not replace the group by its lie algebra .",
    "the discrete structure is represented by an abstract simplicial complex ,  a collection of vertices , edges , triangles ,  which we call _",
    "lattice_. we do not discuss here how these simplices are mapped to or embedded in some given manifold .",
    "the theory can be classical , in this case we have to define some action and the variables in the lagrangian picture , or it can be a quantum theory in the path integral formulation whose path integral is the sum or integral over all classical configurations .",
    "let us consider a gauge theory whose gauge group is any lie group @xmath5 .",
    "we concentrate on pure gauge fields .",
    "there are no dynamical matter fields .",
    "the fundamental variables are taken to be the parallel transports of the gauge connection along the edges ( links ) of the lattice ,  one associates a group element @xmath6 with each edge @xmath7 .",
    "we call the source and target vertices of the edge @xmath8 and @xmath9 , respectively",
    ".    the gauge connection encodes what happens to charged point particles if we propagate them on the lattice .",
    "a charged particle is a vector @xmath10 in some representation @xmath11 of @xmath5 .",
    "if we propagate such a particle from @xmath8 along the edge @xmath7 to @xmath9 , then the parallel transport @xmath12 acts on the vector , @xmath13 .",
    "observe that composition and orientation reversal of the edges correspond precisely to the group structure of @xmath5 .",
    "since the choice of internal reference frame , essentially the choice of basis of @xmath14 , is arbitrary , all physically meaningful quantities are required to be invariant under _ local gauge transformations _ , @xmath15 for each edge @xmath7 .",
    "the _ generating function _",
    "@xmath16 assigns a group element @xmath17 to each vertex @xmath18 and thus parameterizes the local changes of basis .",
    "the action of the theory is a physical quantity and therefore gauge invariant .",
    "it turns out that the easiest way to obtain a gauge invariant expression is to calculate the product of group elements around a closed loop and then to evaluate a character of @xmath5 .",
    "the action originally proposed by wilson makes use of the loop around an elementary square ( plaquette ) and calculates the real part of the character of the fundamental representation of @xmath5 .",
    "now let us try to generalize the setting .",
    "the charged particles are replaced by line - like objects which are to be propagated along surfaces .",
    "we therefore need additional variables associated with the faces ( plaquettes ) of the lattice .",
    "as the faces are two - dimensional objects , we have to deal with various ways of composing individual faces to larger surfaces , for example putting them below each other ( _ vertical composition _ ) or next to each other ( _ horizontal composition _ ) .",
    "the algebraic structure we use has to reflect these geometrical conditions",
    ".    it is known that one possible solution is to label the faces with elements of an abelian group @xmath5 and to consider these as the fundamental variables .",
    "the edges are not labeled . for @xmath0",
    ", such a model is called _",
    "@xmath3-form electrodynamics _ , or more generally @xmath1-form electrodynamics if the fundamental variables are associated with the @xmath1-cells of the lattice ( vertices , edges , faces , @xmath19 ) .",
    "the continuum formulation of the theory for @xmath4 involves so - called kalb ",
    "ramond fields  @xcite .",
    "the higher level models were originally introduced in the language of lattice models in statistical mechanics  @xcite where they correspond to the @xmath20-model ( @xmath21 ) , @xmath22-lattice gauge theory ( @xmath23 ) , a theory for an antisymmetric rank-@xmath3 tensor field ( @xmath4 ) and so on .",
    "their continuum counterparts have been studied in  @xcite .",
    "consider the case @xmath4 .",
    "can we do any better than just using an abelian symmetry group ?",
    "as long as we insist on colouring only faces , this is not possible as a classic argument from algebraic topology shows .",
    "but a generalization is possible if we colour both edges and faces with suitable algebraic structures .",
    "the main result of the present article is the construction of such a generalized @xmath3-form gauge theory with its local gauge transformations and gauge invariant expressions .",
    "we emphasize the geometrical properties of our model , namely that we have an assignment of non - abelian quantities to geometrical objects in a coordinate free way .",
    "there exists a considerable literature on the interplay of lie algebra valued @xmath24- and @xmath3-forms and their extended ` gauge ' symmetries , but there is usually  @xcite no geometrical interpretation for the non - abelian @xmath3-form comparable to the parallel transport along curves which can be constructed from a connection @xmath24-form . in this article , we pursue a complementary approach .",
    "we require a consistent geometrical picture and then deduce how much freedom we have in choosing the structure of our model .    at the technical level",
    ", the only thing we do is to combine two recent ideas .",
    "the first  @xcite is the construction of _ lie @xmath3-groups _ which serve as the algebraic structure in order to label edges and faces in a consistent way with non - abelian quantities .",
    "the second  @xcite is the use of ideas from category theory in order to rephrase lattice gauge theory in a way that does admit the desired generalization .",
    "a related construction was presented in  @xcite where the discrete framework is used in order to derive the corresponding continuum expressions .",
    "one can say that the construction presented here is somewhat more general than a discrete version of a theory of the @xmath24- and @xmath3-connections of non - abelian gerbes .",
    "for mathematical background on gerbes , see  @xcite .",
    "although we do not use the most general setting and restrict ourselves to strict lie @xmath3-groups , we still have plenty of examples and our construction includes a discrete version of non - abelian gerbes as a special case .",
    "the motivation sketched so far , namely to replace a theory for charged point particles by a theory for both charged point and charged line - like particles , seems to be mainly related to string theory . in fact , the simplest case , abelian @xmath3-form electrodynamics or kalb  ramond fields  @xcite play an important role in string theory so that it is interesting to understand possible generalizations .    in the context of quantum field theory",
    ", one might naively claim that in four dimensions any theory with a local non - abelian symmetry is a gauge theory .",
    "of course , this is not the full truth , and it is of general interest to understand in conceptual terms which other theories can have local symmetries .    beyond these general ideas ,",
    "we sketch how the model constructed here might provide further insight into the refined state sum models of quantum gravity and into the role of centre monopoles and vortices in lattice qcd .",
    "we also comment on the hierarchy of models that generalize @xmath1-form electrodynamics to non - abelian symmetries .",
    "we try to keep the present article self - contained and to make it readable by physicists who are not yet familiar with category theory .",
    "therefore we carefully review the required background material .",
    "the article is organized as follows . in section  [ sect_ordinary ] ,",
    "we rephrase conventional lattice gauge theory in the language of category theory in order to prepare for the generalization . in section  [ sect_background ]",
    ", we recall the argument which forces the symmetry group to be abelian if we colour only the faces , and we present the relevant algebraic structures in order to circumvent it .",
    "the construction of our non - abelian @xmath3-form lattice gauge theory is presented in section  [ sect_construction ] .",
    "section  [ sect_examples ] contains some examples and comments on their physical relevance .",
    "finally , in section  [ sect_conclude ] , we discuss open questions and the relationship with other approaches .",
    "in this section , we review the basic structures of lattice gauge theory for pure gauge fields and rephrase everything in the language of category theory .",
    "this might seem to be much too complicated at first sight , but it turns out that the category theoretic language is the key to the generalization to higher level , including dynamical variables both at the edges and at the faces of the lattice .",
    "the idea to rephrase lattice gauge theory in the language of category theory was , to our knowledge , first proposed by baez  @xcite and then generalized by grosse and schlesinger  @xcite .",
    "here we review this construction in a language adapted to the examples we are going to present . for a mathematical introduction to category theory ,",
    "see , for example  @xcite",
    ".    informally speaking , a category is a collection of points ( _ objects _ ) and arrows between these points ( _ morphisms _ ) with enough structure so that we can compose arrows and that we have _ identities _ ,",
    "arrows that behave like neutral elements under composition .",
    "the precise definition is as follows .",
    "we restrict ourselves to _ small _ categories ,  the collections of objects and morphisms form proper sets .",
    "[ def_category ] a _ small category _ @xmath25 consists of a set @xmath26 of _ objects _ , a set @xmath27 of _ morphisms _ and maps @xmath28 ( _ source _ ) , @xmath29 ( _ target _ ) , @xmath30 ( _ identity _ ) and @xmath31 ( _ composition _ ) such that the following axioms hold , @xmath32 for all objects @xmath33 and morphisms @xmath34 and @xmath35 where composable .",

    "this is stated in the following two examples .",
    "[ ex_group ] let @xmath5 be a lie group .",
    "then there is a groupoid @xmath46 associated with @xmath5 which has only one object , @xmath47 , and whose morphisms are the group elements , @xmath48 .",
    "composition is the multiplication in @xmath5 .",
    "obviously , the source and target maps @xmath49 are trivial , and the identity map associated with the object @xmath50 is the unit in @xmath5 , @xmath51 .    [ ex_graph ] let @xmath52 be a directed graph , given by a set @xmath53 of _ vertices _ and a set @xmath54 of _ edges _ together with maps @xmath55 and @xmath56 indicating the source and target of each edge . then there is a category @xmath57 whose objects @xmath58 are the vertices .",

    "the maps @xmath68 and @xmath69 are given by the directed graph and extended to compositions such that   holds .    this construction looks complicated at first sight , but the only thing we have done is to take vertices as objects and edges as morphisms and make everything else fit the picture .",
    "so far we have introduced two categories .",
    "one of them , @xmath57 , encodes the information about the lattice while the other one , @xmath46 , is the gauge group .",
    "we will see that configurations of lattice gauge theory are maps from the former to the latter .",

    "the map @xmath103 in the definition of the natural equivalence plays the role of the generating function .    which expressions are gauge invariant and can therefore correspond to physically meaningful quantities ? we know that the simplest such expressions are wilson loops , group characters evaluated at the holonomy around loops .",

    "in standard lattice gauge theory , the properties mentioned so far are much easier to verify in direct computations . the category theoretic language presented here ,",
    "however , provides a structural framework which would have allowed us to derive all these properties in a systematic fashion even if we had not known them in advance",
    ". we will exploit this conceptual advantage when we generalize lattice gauge theory to the next level , colouring both edges and faces with dynamical variables . in section  [ sect_construction ]",

    "let us first review the argument of eckmann and hilton  @xcite which explains why we are forced to use abelian groups as long as we colour only the faces .",

    ", there will occur mixed compositions such as that shown in figure  [ fig_eckmann](c ) .",
    "we require that this composition is well defined without parentheses ,  it does not depend on the ordering by which horizontal and vertical compositions are performed .",
    "this means that the _ exchange law _",
    ", @xmath116 is satisfied .",
    "this implies first that the units actually agree because @xmath117 therefore we can write @xmath118 .",

    "if we wish to escape this abelianness , we have to change some of the initial assumptions",
    ". there are _ a priori _ various conceivable approaches .",
    "since we aim for a setting similar to lattice gauge theory , we have to require that figure  [ fig_eckmann](c ) is well - defined without parentheses so that the exchange law   is not in question .",
    "it turns out that it is a viable strategy to colour both edges and faces with different algebraic structures in such a way that there is a non - trivial interplay and that the identities no longer agree .",

    "at the technical level , there are a number of natural questions to ask . what is the most general gauge invariant expression ? in standard lattice gauge theory , these are _ spin networks _",
    "@xcite , generalizations of wilson loops that include branchings of the lines with intertwiners of the gauge group at the branching points .",

    ", we have to study the representation @xmath3-category of a lie @xmath3-group .",
    "work on the representation theory of @xmath3-groups is in progress  @xcite .",
    "it is desirable to find a gauge invariant expression which combines both holonomies of morphisms around loops and @xmath3-holonomies around closed surfaces so that this expression reduces to the wilson action if we choose the trivial @xmath3-group .",
    "at the moment we have either the old observables ( characters of holonomies ) which are not @xmath3-gauge invariant or very special new ones ( @xmath3-actions of @xmath3-holonomies ) which disappear for the trivial @xmath3-group .",

    "the requirement to use real numbers is , of course , imposed by the physical framework , but the @xmath3-categorical treatment might indicate that one should try to categorify the action or the path integral .    given a path integral formulation of lattice @xmath3-gauge theory as sketched in section  [ sect_partition ] , we have the _ connection picture _ of this theory which is given in terms of continuous variables .",

    "how does the dual formulation of lattice @xmath3-gauge theory look like ?",

    "we emphasize that the dual theory will involve one higher level of the given simplicial complex because the @xmath3-action is associated with the @xmath335-simplices .",
    "thinking about the representation picture of lattice @xmath3-gauge theory , the entire program of the lattice gauge and state sum models is worth reconsidering : topological models , diagrammatic techniques generalizing the chain mail  @xcite and generalizing the ribbon diagrammatics of  @xcite .",

    "how does it collapse in the case of a @xmath398-gauge theory ?",
    "the lattice is a @xmath398-category ,  just a set , a collection of points without structure .",
    "similarly the set of labels ( ` @xmath398-gauge group ' ) .",
    "a configuration is then a @xmath398-functor which is just a map from the set of points to the @xmath398-gauge group .",
    "there is no notion of natural equivalence and therefore no local symmetry .",

    "@xmath400 . no local symmetry .",
    "the variables are associated with the vertices and the action terms with the edges .",
    "gauge ` invariant ' quantities are arbitrary functions . for models with a certain global symmetry ,",

    "@xmath402 . the model constructed in the present article .",
    "the generic gauge invariant quantities are certain spin foams . from the assignment of variables one can already see that the strong coupling expansion will lead to coloured @xmath335-complexes .",
    "it seems that we can minimally couple the model at level @xmath399 with the model at @xmath403 .",
    "the classic example at @xmath400 is the abelian higgs model with frozen radial mode  @xcite , but this construction can be extended to non - abelian symmetry groups as well  @xcite .",
    "the next more general step would therefore be to couple a @xmath3-gauge theory to standard lattice gauge theory .",
    "it is an interesting question whether one can construct a topological quantum field theory ( tqft ) from our @xmath3-gauge theory .",
    "we should therefore require the higher level analogue of the flatness condition in order to obtain topological invariants .",
    "this means we should restrict the partition function of our quantum theory to those configurations for which the @xmath3-holonomy @xmath404 vanishes at every tetrahedron @xmath405 .",
    "this is the _",
    "zero @xmath3-curvature condition_.    for certain finite crossed modules this tqft was constructed by yetter  @xcite using the language of categorical groups , group objects in the category of groupoids . in the topological case",
    "one can choose an arbitrary triangulation as the lattice and then construct the infinite refinement limit .",
    "this means in physical terms that the tqft has a trivial renormalization .",
    "the continuum counterpart of the higher lattice gauge theory was developed in  @xcite and , for non - abelian gerbes , in  @xcite .",
    "in the continuum , it has turned out to be difficult to find fully gauge invariant actions . in the discrete approach , however , see also  @xcite , invariant actions arise naturally from the tetrahedron diagram , figure  [ fig_commutative ] .",
    "our result is that the admissible @xmath3-actions are sensitive only to @xmath176 , an observation which may help to better understand the continuum situation .",
    "in particular for the automorphism @xmath3-group , @xmath334 is often a discrete group . in this case",
    ", it will be impossible to write down a naive continuum expression for the @xmath3-action which just uses lie algebras instead of lie groups .",
    "continuum @xmath3-actions will rather involve some kind of topological defect or singularity and will be given by non - local expressions similar to topological charges .",
    "it should generally be possible to consider ` infinitesimal ' simplices as in  @xcite in order to infer the continuum formulas corresponding to the given discrete expressions .",
    "it is open whether the converse is possible ,  to integrate the differential continuum expressions in order to recover the non - infinitesimal formulas .",
    "the problem is that there is no ` surface ordered product ' available yet . because of this obstacle , we favour the discrete approach , at least for now .",
    "finally , the model constructed here together with the continuum counterparts developed in  @xcite demonstrates that there exist theories with local symmetries beyond conventional gauge theory .",
    "are the corresponding quantum field theories relevant in nature ?",

    "<S> in conventional gauge theory , a charged point particle is described by a representation of the gauge group . if we propagate the particle along some path , the parallel transport of the gauge connection acts on this representation . </S>",
    "<S> the lagrangian density of the gauge field depends on the curvature of the connection which can be calculated from the holonomy around ( infinitesimal ) loops . for abelian symmetry groups , </S>",
    "<S> say @xmath0 , there exists a generalization , known as @xmath1-form electrodynamics , in which @xmath2-dimensional charged objects can be propagated along @xmath1-surfaces and in which the lagrangian depends on a generalized curvature associated with ( infinitesimal ) closed @xmath1-surfaces . in this article , we use lie @xmath3-groups and ideas from higher category theory in order to formulate a discrete gauge theory which generalizes these models at the level @xmath4 to possibly non - abelian symmetry groups . an important feature of our model is that it involves both parallel transports along paths and generalized transports along surfaces with a non - trivial interplay of these two types of variables . </S>",
    "<S> our main result is the geometric picture , namely the assignment of non - abelian quantities to geometrical objects in a coordinate free way . </S>",
    "<S> we construct the precise assignment of variables to the curves and surfaces , the generalized local symmetries and gauge invariant actions and we clarify which structures can be non - abelian and which others are always abelian . a discrete version of connections on non - abelian gerbes is a special case of our construction . </S>",
    "<S> even though the motivation sketched so far suggests applications mainly in string theory , the model presented here is also related to spin foam models of quantum gravity and may in addition provide some insight into the role of centre monopoles and vortices in lattice qcd . </S>"
