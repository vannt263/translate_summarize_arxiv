    "comparison of galaxy and absorber redshifts along common lines of sight demonstrates that a significant and perhaps dominant fraction of low - redshift ( @xmath1 ) -forest absorption systems arise in extended gaseous envelopes of galaxies ( lanzetta et al .",
    "1995a ; chen et al .",
    "but it has not yet been possible to extend this comparison to higher redshifts , because normal surveys fail to identify galaxies at redshifts much beyond @xmath2 . nevertheless , determining the origin of high - redshift -forest absorption systems bears crucially on all efforts to apply the absorbers as a means to study galaxies in the very distant universe and to study how the extended gas of galaxies evolves with redshift .",
    "previous arguments based on the apparent low metal content and lack of clustering of the absorbers suggested an intergalactic origin ( sargent et al .",
    "1980 ) , but these arguments are weakened by recent keck measurements of the actual metal content and clustering of the absorbers ( songaila & cowie et al .  1996 ; fernndez - soto et al .  1996 ) .    to extend the comparison of galaxies and absorbers to higher redshifts ,",
    "it is necessary to systematically identify normal galaxies at redshifts @xmath3 . over the past few years , it has become clear that high - redshift galaxies can be reliably identified by means of broad - band photometric techniques . for example",
    ", several groups have determined photometric redshifts of galaxies in the hubble deep field ( hdf ) to redshifts as large as @xmath4 ( lanzetta , yahil , & fernndez - soto 1996 ; sawicki , lin , & yee 1997 ; connolly et al .",
    "1997 ; lanzetta , fernndez - soto , & yahil 1998 ; fernndez - soto , lanzetta , & yahil 1999 ) .",
    "spectroscopic redshifts of nearly 120 of these galaxies obtained using the keck telescope ( see fernndez - soto et al .",
    "1999 for a complete list of references ) have demonstrated that the photometric redshifts are both reliable enough and accurate enough to establish galaxy surface density versus redshift to large redshifts ( lanzetta et al .",
    "1998 ; fernndez - soto et al .  1999 ) .    here",
    "we combine an _ empirical _ measure of the galaxy surface density versus redshift , obtained from the hdf , with an _ empirical _ measure of the gaseous extent of galaxies , obtained by chen et al .",
    "( 1998 ) , to predict the number density of  absorption systems that originate in extended gaseous envelopes of galaxies versus redshift .",
    "previous comparison of galaxies and  absorption systems at redshifts @xmath1 showed that ( 1 ) galaxies of all morphological types possess extended gaseous envelopes and ( 2 ) the gaseous extent of galaxies scales with galaxy @xmath5-band luminosity but does not depend sensitively on redshift ( chen et al .",
    "if these results apply to galaxies at all redshifts , then known galaxies of known gaseous extent must produce some fraction of  absorption systems at all redshifts .    on the basis of our analysis",
    ", we find that this fraction is significant .",
    "specifically , considering  absorption systems of absorption equivalent width @xmath0  , we find that galaxies can account for nearly all observed  absorption systems at @xmath6 and that galaxies of luminosity @xmath7 can account for approximately 50% of the observed  absorption systems at higher redshifts .",
    "we further argue that if the gaseous extent of galaxies does not decrease with increasing redshift , then known galaxies must produce _ at least _ as many  absorption systems as our predictions .",
    "we show that we can already explain 70% and perhaps all of the observed  absorption systems at @xmath8 after correcting for faint galaxies that are below the detection threshold of the hdf images .",
    "we adopt a hubble constant , @xmath9  mpc@xmath10 , and a deceleration parameter , @xmath11 , throughout the paper , unless otherwise noted .",
    "to calculate the predicted number density of  absorption systems that originate in extended gaseous envelopes of galaxies versus redshift , we multiply the galaxy number density per unit comoving volume by the absorption gas cross section of galaxies , which is known to scale with properties of galaxies .",
    "our previous comparison of galaxies and  absorption systems at @xmath12 showed that the amount of gas encountered along a line of sight depends on galaxy impact parameter @xmath13 and @xmath5-band luminosity @xmath14 but does not depend strongly on galaxy average surface brightness @xmath15 , disk - to - bulge ratio @xmath16 , or redshift @xmath17 ( chen et al .",
    "namely , galaxies of all morphological types possess extended gaseous envelopes , and the absorption gas cross section scales with galaxy @xmath5-band luminosity but does not evolve significantly with redshift .",
    "the left panel of figure 1 shows a statistically significant correlation between galaxy @xmath5-band magnitude and the residuals of the @xmath18 versus @xmath13 anti - correlation .",
    "in contrast , the right panel of figure 1 shows no correlation at all between galaxy redshift and the residuals of the @xmath18 versus @xmath13 anti - correlation accounting for galaxy @xmath5-band luminosity .",
    "the predicted number density of  absorption systems @xmath19 originating in extended gaseous envelopes of galaxies can now be written @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the speed of light , @xmath22 is the galaxy luminosity function , and @xmath23 is the gaseous extent .",
    "the minimum galaxy @xmath5-band luminosity @xmath24 is determined by the detection threshold of either the galaxy redshift survey or the  absorbing galaxy survey .",
    "it is taken to be the brighter of the magnitude limits at which the galaxy luminosity function or the scaling relation was determined . supplementing results of chen et al .",
    "( 1998 ) with new measurements ( chen et al .",
    ", in preparation ) , we find that galaxy gaseous radius @xmath23 scales with galaxy @xmath5-band luminosity @xmath14 as @xmath25 with @xmath26 and with @xmath27 at @xmath28   for galaxies of luminosity @xmath29 .    given a complete galaxy sample",
    ", we can evaluate equation ( 1 ) by establishing an empirical galaxy luminosity function without adopting any particular functional form .",
    "first , we write the galaxy luminosity function as a discrete sum of @xmath30 functions , @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the angular survey area , @xmath33 is the angular diameter distance , and @xmath34 is the @xmath5-band luminosity of galaxy @xmath35 . next , we substitute equation ( 4 ) into equation ( 1 ) and rearrange terms to yield @xmath36 where @xmath37 marks the boundary of each redshift bin .",
    "equation ( 5 ) indicates that the number density of  absorption systems originating in the extended gaseous envelopes of galaxies is equal to the product of the galaxy surface density and the average of luminosity weighted gas cross sections .",
    "here we adopt a galaxy sample from the hubble deep field ( hdf ) galaxy catalog published by fernndez - soto et al .",
    "( 1999 ) , which contains coordinates , optical and near - infrared photometry , and photometric redshift measurements of 1067 galaxies .",
    "this galaxy catalog is unique for studying galaxy statistics at high redshifts , because it is sensitive to objects of surface brightness down to @xmath38 and is complete to @xmath39 within the central @xmath40 area of the hdf image ( zone 1 of fernndez - soto et al .  1999 ) .",
    "photometric redshifts ranging through @xmath41 were measured from broad - band spectral energy distributions established from the optical ( williams et al .",
    "1996 ) and infrared ( dickinson et al .  1999 , in preparation ) images .",
    "spectroscopic redshifts of nearly 120 of these galaxies have been obtained using the keck telescope ( see fernndez - soto et al .",
    "1999 for a complete list of references ) .",
    "comparison of the photometric and spectroscopic redshifts shows that the photometric redshifts are accurate to within an rms relative uncertainty of @xmath42 at all redshifts @xmath43 ( lanzetta et al .  1998 ;",
    "fernndez - soto et al .",
    "1999 ) , except that there are not spectroscopic redshifts available for comparison at redshifts @xmath44 to @xmath45 .",
    "reliable galaxy statistics as a function of redshift can therefore be measured on the basis of the hdf galaxy catalog .",
    "the goal of the analysis is to compare the predicted number density of  absorption systems originating in extended gaseous envelopes of galaxies ( using the hdf galaxy catalog ) with the observed number density of   absorption systems .",
    "here we evaluate equation ( 5 ) for galaxies observed in the hdf , given the photometric redshift measurements .",
    "galaxy @xmath5-band luminosity is calculated from the apparent f814w magnitude corrected for luminosity distance , color @xmath46 correction ( between rest - frame @xmath5 band and observed - frame f814w band , calculated based on the spectral type determined from the photometric redshift techniques ) , and bandpass @xmath46 correction .",
    "errors in the predicted number density are estimated using a standard bootstrap method , which incorporates the sampling error with the uncertainties of photometric redshift measurements and the scaling relation . to model the uncertainty of photometric redshift measurements correctly , lanzetta et al .",
    "( 1998 ) have shown that both photometric error and cosmic variance with respect to the spectral templates must be accounted for .",
    "the first can be simulated by perturbing galaxy photometry of different bands within the photometric errors .",
    "the second can be characterized by the rms dispersion of photometric and spectroscopic redshift measurements , which is 0.08 at @xmath6 and 0.32 at @xmath47 ( lanzetta et al .",
    "the uncertainty of photometric redshift measurements is then calculated by forming a quadratic sum of the two .",
    "the results are shown in table 1 and figure 2 in comparison with observations . in figure 2 ,",
    "filled circles represent the observations and open circles represent our predictions .",
    "the observations at @xmath48 are taken from the sample 2 of weymann et al .",
    "( 1998 ) , which we normalize to refer to  absorption lines of @xmath0  .",
    "the observations at @xmath49 are taken from the sample 9 of bechtold ( 1994 ) .",
    "we select a bin size , @xmath50 , when calculating the predicted values .",
    "experiments with different bin sizes show that the redshift distribution of the predicted number density of  absorption systems is insensitive to the selected bin size .",
    "we also repeat the calculation , using a deceleration parameter , @xmath51 .",
    "it turns out that the predicted number density of   absorption systems does not depend sensitively on the adopted deceleration parameter either .",
    "our predictions have so far been limited to including galaxies of luminosity @xmath52 .",
    "to estimate the contribution of faint galaxies to the predicted gas cross section , we calculate the number density of  absorption systems originating in galaxies of luminosity @xmath53 by choosing a schechter luminosity function .",
    "we evaluate equation ( 1 ) by adopting a faint - end slope obtained by ellis et al .",
    "( 1996 ) , which is @xmath54 , and by extrapolating the scaling relation ( equation 2 and 3 ) to obtain the extended gaseous radii for galaxies of luminosity @xmath55 .",
    "increments of the predicted number density versus redshift due to the inclusion of faint galaxies are shown in figure 2 as well ( crosses with dashed horizontal bars ) .",
    "the hdf images have provided us with a unique chance to relate statistical properties of high - redshift galaxies to statistical properties of   absorption systems , thereby studying the origin of  absorption systems at high redshifts .",
    "combining an _ empirical _ measure of galaxy surface density versus redshift with an _ empirical _ measure of gaseous extent of galaxies , we have predicted the number density of  absorption systems that originate in extended gaseous envelopes of galaxies versus redshift .    for  absorption systems of absorption equivalent width @xmath0  ,",
    "comparison of the predicted and observed number densities of   absorption systems shows that ( 1 ) known galaxies with known gas cross sections can account for all the observed  absorption systems to within measurement errors at redshifts @xmath56 , ( 2 ) known galaxies of luminosity @xmath57 with unevolved gas cross sections can account for all  absorption systems at redshifts @xmath58 , and ( 3 ) known galaxies of luminosity @xmath59 with unevolved gas cross sections can account for approximately 50% of observed  absorption systems at @xmath47 .",
    "apparently , bright galaxies alone can account for a significant portion of the observed  absorption systems at all redshifts .",
    "after correcting for faint galaxies that are below the detection threshold of the hdf image , we can already explain 70% and perhaps all of the observed  absorption systems at @xmath8 to within errors .",
    "here we discuss three factors that may invalidate the result .",
    "first , we consider evolution of the galaxy luminosity function .",
    "there has been some evidence showing that galaxies at the faint end of galaxy luminosity function evolves significantly with redshift ( e.g. ellis 1997 , and references therein ) .",
    "namely , faint galaxies may be more numerous at higher redshifts . to address this issue",
    ", we evaluate equation ( 1 ) with @xmath60 to calculate the relative change in the predicted number density , given a different faint - end slope .",
    "it turns out that the predicted number density of  absorption systems increases by as much as @xmath61 dex , if we vary the faint - end slope from @xmath62 to @xmath63 .",
    "apparently , a steeper faint - end slope brings the predicted values closer to the observed ones .",
    "we conclude that known galaxies must produce _ at least _ as many   absorption systems as the predictions .",
    "next , we consider evolution of neutral gas surrounding galaxies . in the right panel of figure 1",
    ", we show that the residuals of the @xmath18 versus @xmath13 anti - correlation after accounting for the scaling of galaxy @xmath5-band luminosity @xmath14 do not correlate with galaxy redshift .",
    "although there is no direct observational evidence to support the extension of the redshift independence of the scaling relation to redshifts beyond @xmath64 , the gaseous extent of galaxies is unlikely to decrease with increasing redshift in these early epochs .",
    "theoretically , it is believed that galaxies were formed through accretion of cooled gas over time , indicating a larger gaseous extent of galaxies at higher redshifts .",
    "observationally , the mass density of neutral gas measured from damped  absorption systems increases significantly with increasing redshift at redshifts between @xmath65 and @xmath66 ( lanzetta , wolfe , & turnshek 1995 ; storrie - lombardi , mcmahon , & irwin 1996 ) , supporting that galaxies may possess more neutral gas and therefore no less gaseous extent at higher redshifts .",
    "we again conclude that known galaxies must produce _ at least _ as many  absorption systems as the predictions .",
    "finally , we consider galaxy clustering effects . due to limited resolutions of spectroscopic observations ,  absorption lines with small velocity separation",
    "are sometimes blended together and considered as one absorption system .",
    "lanzetta , webb , & barcons ( 1996 ) first reported an absorption system which may arise in a group or cluster of galaxies .",
    "it was later confirmed by ortiz - gl et al .",
    "( 1999 ) , who identified eight absorption features in this system based on a spectrum of higher spectral resolution .",
    "their analysis suggested that the degree of clustering of  absorption systems may be underestimated on velocity scales of several hundred kilometers per second ( see also fernndez - soto et al .",
    "similarly , the number density of   absorption lines derived from a known galaxy population would be in excess of the observed number density of  absorption lines , because galaxies are strongly clustered and the predicted number density does not suffer from the line blending effect . as a result , the fraction of  absorption systems originating in extended gaseous envelopes of galaxies may be overestimated .    to estimate the amount of excess at different redshifts",
    ", we calculate the expected number of neighbouring galaxies of luminosity @xmath67 , @xmath68 , that are seen at impact parameters @xmath69 kpc along a line of sight with a velocity difference of @xmath70 from an absorption redshift .",
    "we adopt a two - point correlation function measured by magliocchetti & maddox ( 1999 ) and arnouts et al .",
    "( 1999 ) for the hdf galaxies at redshifts @xmath71 , which is characterized by @xmath72 with @xmath73 and @xmath74 mpc , and evaluate the integral of the two - point correlation function over a comoving volume spanned by @xmath75 in depth and 200 kpc in radius .",
    "the velocity span , @xmath70 , is taken to be the spectral resolution of which the observations were carried out .",
    "it is @xmath76 for the sample from weymann et al .",
    "( i.e.  absorption systems at @xmath48 ) and @xmath77 for the sample from bechtold ( i.e.  absorption systems at @xmath78 ) .",
    "we show in table 2 that the estimated excess in our predictions ( represented by the number of neighbouring galaxies ) can be at most a factor of four at @xmath6 , but is negligible at @xmath47 .",
    "therefore , we conclude that the fraction of  absorption systems originating in extended gaseous envelopes of galaxies remains significant even after correcting for galaxy clustering .    in summary ,",
    "we present our first attempt at relating statistical properties of galaxies to statistical properties of  absorption systems at high redshifts based on the hdf galaxy catalog . combining an _ empirical _ measure of galaxy surface density versus redshift with an _ empirical _ measure of gaseous extent of galaxies , we have predicted the number density of  absorption systems that originate in extended gaseous envelopes of galaxies versus redshift .",
    "we show that at approximately 50% and as much as 100% of observed  absorption systems of @xmath0   can be explained by extended gaseous envelops of galaxies .",
    "the result remains valid after taking into account possibile evolutions of faint galaxies and extended gas around galaxies , as well as galaxy clustering effects .",
    "therefore , we conclude that known galaxies of known gaseous extent must produce a significant fraction and perhaps all of  absorption systems over a large redshift range .",
