    "rose and newton @xcite proved a nodal theorem for a single fermion moving in three dimensions in an attractive central potential which was not too singular at the origin .",
    "the dirac spinor for this problem is constructed with two radial functions , @xmath16 and @xmath17 , with respective numbers of nodes @xmath4 and @xmath18 the nodal theorem is to the effect that if @xmath19 then @xmath20 and if @xmath21 then @xmath22 where @xmath23 it is the purpose of the present paper to generalize this nodal theorem to @xmath0 dimensions .",
    "we find it convenient to consider the cases @xmath2 and @xmath24 separately , since the parities of the radial functions are important only for @xmath2 : thus we arrive at two theorems . in one dimension",
    "we find @xmath20 and in @xmath25 dimensions we prove a theorem which corresponds to the rose - newton result with @xmath26 replaced by @xmath12 where @xmath13    it it always interesting to know _ a priori _ the structure of the solution to a problem .",
    "for want of suitable theorems , the nodal structures of bound - state solutions of the dirac equation have often been tacitly assumed in the recent derivations of relativistic comparison theorems , to the effect that @xmath27 earlier , such theorems were not expected since the dirac hamiltonian is not bounded below and consequently it is difficult to characterize it s discrete spectrum variationally : thus comparison theorems are not immediately evident .",
    "the first results @xcite were for ground - state problems in @xmath28 dimensions where the nodal structure was given by the rose - newton theorem .",
    "this dirac comparison theorem was later extended to the ground state in @xmath29 dimensions by g. chen @xcite .",
    "more recent results were based on monotonicity arguments and yielded comparison theorems for the excited states @xcite ; subsequently , applications to atomic physics @xcite were considered .",
    "these theorems and their application required either the precise nodal structure of the ground state , or the knowledge that , for an interesting class of problems , it made sense to compare the eigenvalues of states with the same nodal structure ; in particular , the states needed to be suitably labelled . from a practical perspective , we have found that knowing the nodal structure is very helpful in computing bound - state eigenvalues numerically ( by shooting methods ) and for plotting the graphs of the radial functions @xmath30 or the corresponding ` dirac spinor orbits ' @xmath31 .",
    "articles by leviatan _",
    "et al _ @xcite show how dirac nodal structure is important for nuclear physics .",
    "a dirac equation in one spatial dimension and in natural units @xmath32 for a potential @xmath33 which is symmetric with respect to reflection i.e. @xmath34 reads @xcite : @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the mass of the particle , @xmath37 and @xmath38 are pauli matrices , and the energy @xmath39 satisfies @xmath40 , @xcite .",
    "taking the two - component dirac spinor as @xmath41 the above matrix equation can be decomposed into a system of first - order linear differential equations @xcite :",
    "@xmath42 @xmath43 where prime @xmath44 denotes the derivative with respect to @xmath45 . for bound states , @xmath46 and @xmath47",
    "satisfy the normalization condition @xmath48 now we can state the theorem concerning the number of nodes of the dirac spinor components for the one - dimensional case .    * nodal theorem in @xmath2 dimension : *  _",
    "we assume @xmath33 is a negative even potential that is monotone for @xmath49 and satisfies @xmath50 where @xmath51 is a positive constant .",
    "then @xmath46 and @xmath47 have definite and opposite parities . if @xmath4 and @xmath5 are , respectively",
    ", the numbers of nodes of the upper @xmath46 and lower @xmath47 components of the dirac spinor , then @xmath52 _    * proof : *   we suppose that @xmath53 is a solution of eqs.([d1l ] ,  [ d1r ] ) . since @xmath33 is an even function of @xmath45 , then by direct substitution we find that @xmath54 and @xmath55 are also solutions of eqs.([d1l ] ,  [ d1r ] ) with the same energy @xmath39 .",
    "therefore , by using linear combinations , we see that the solutions @xmath53 of eqs.([d1l ] ,  [ d1r ] ) can be chosen to have definite and necessarily opposite parities , that is to say , @xmath56 is even and @xmath57 is odd , or _",
    "vice versa_. also the energy spectrum of bound states is non - degenerate : details of this can be found in refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "now we analyse the asymptotic behavior of @xmath46 and @xmath47 . at positive or negative infinity , after some rearragements , the system of eqs.([d1l ] ,  [ d1r ] ) becomes asymptotically @xmath58 @xmath59 solutions at infinity are given by @xmath60 and at negative infinity @xmath61 where @xmath62 and @xmath63 are constants of integration and @xmath64 .",
    "substitution of these solutions into eqs.([d1l ] ,  [ d1r ] ) as @xmath65 gives us the values for @xmath63 @xmath66 considering the following two limits : @xmath67 we conclude that at positive infinity @xmath46 and @xmath47 have to vanish with the same signs and with different signs at negative infinity .",
    "we note that physics does not favour @xmath68 over @xmath69 : @xmath46 and @xmath47 can be interchanged by choosing a different representation for the matrix spinor equation leading to the coupled equations eqs.([d1l ] ,  [ d1r ] ) .",
    "we now introduce the following functions @xmath70 in terms of which eqs.([d1l ] ,  [ d1r ] ) become @xmath71 @xmath72 since @xmath33 is even , and @xmath46 and @xmath47 have definite and opposite parities , for the remainder of the proof we restrict our attention to the positive half axis @xmath49 . as @xmath33 is negative , and",
    "@xmath40 , it follows that @xmath73 , @xmath74 .",
    "also @xmath33 is monotone nondecreasing and vanishes for large @xmath45 .",
    "thus @xmath75 is monotone nonincreasing and @xmath76 , but for small @xmath45 , depending on @xmath33 , @xmath75 may be positive . hence , @xmath75 is either always negative or is positive near the origin and then changes sign once , say at @xmath77",
    ". we shall prove now that the wave functions @xmath46 and @xmath47 may have a nodes only on the interval @xmath78 $ ] where @xmath79 , and that these nodes are alternating . we observe parenthetically that , if @xmath75 is always negative , there are no excited states .",
    "let us start from the interval @xmath80 where @xmath81 .",
    "without loss of generality , we assume that at the point @xmath82 the function @xmath47 is increasing and has a node , so @xmath83 and @xmath84 .",
    "then eqs.([d3l ] ,  [ d3r ] ) lead to @xmath85 since @xmath46 and @xmath47 have to vanish at infinity , as @xmath45 increases @xmath47 has to reach a local maximum at some point @xmath86 ( @xmath87 is such that there are no nodes or extrema of @xmath47 between @xmath88 and @xmath87 ) and then decrease ; thus @xmath89 , @xmath90 , and @xmath91 . from",
    "it follows that @xmath92 and from that @xmath93 , which is not possible .",
    "a similar contradiction is reached if instead we consider a node of @xmath56 at @xmath88 .",
    "thus nodes of @xmath46 and @xmath47 can occur only on @xmath78 $ ] .",
    "indeed , if we apply the same reasoning as above with @xmath88 , @xmath94 $ ] , we find no contradiction ; for @xmath95 , the functions @xmath46 and @xmath47 can have more nodes or vanish as @xmath96 . we also conclude that the nodes of @xmath46 and @xmath47 are alternating .",
    "the same conclusions are reached if @xmath47 is decreasing at @xmath88 , or , as we observed above , if , instead of @xmath47 , we consider @xmath46 first .",
    "if we assume that @xmath46 is even and @xmath47 is odd , this leads to four cases at the origin : @xmath97 @xmath98 @xmath99 @xmath100 we can reduce these four cases to two because _ case  1 _ and _ case  2 _ correspond to _ case  4 _ and _ case  3 _ , respectively , multiplied by @xmath101 . we choose to keep",
    "_ cases  1 _ and _ 2_. now , at @xmath102 , @xmath46 is positive and has a local maximum .",
    "eqs.([d3l ] ,  [ d3r ] ) then imply : @xmath103 and @xmath104 , which rules out _",
    "case 2_. thus , for @xmath46 even and @xmath47 odd , we need only consider _ case 1_.    finally , _ case  1 _ ( and _ case  4 _ ) describe the behavior of @xmath46 and @xmath47 at the origin ; the fact that the nodes of these components are alternating tells us how they behave further out , and we know that at infinity the components vanish with the same signs .",
    "also we have assumed that @xmath46 is even , so @xmath47 is odd , and reflection of their graphs gives us their behavior on @xmath105 $ ] . in particular ,",
    "@xmath46 and @xmath47 vanish at negative infinity with different signs . from the above",
    "it follows that @xmath47 has one node more than @xmath46 .",
    "if @xmath46 is odd , then @xmath47 is even , and , by a similar analysis , we again find that @xmath106 we observe that although @xmath46 can be node free when @xmath47 is odd , when @xmath46 is odd , @xmath47 must have at least two nodes .",
    "this completes the proof of the theorem .",
    "@xmath107    as an illustration for this result we plot wave functions for the laser - dressed coulomb potential which is studied , for example , in refs .",

    "for a central potential in @xmath25 dimensions the dirac equation can be written @xcite in natural units @xmath32 as @xmath112 where @xmath36 is the mass of the particle , @xmath33 is a spherically symmetric potential , and @xmath113 and @xmath114 are the dirac matrices which satisfy anti - commutation relations ; the identity matrix is implied after the potential @xmath33 . for stationary states , some algebraic calculations in a suitable basis , the details of which may be found in refs .",
    "@xcite , lead to a pair of first - order linear differential equations in two radial functions @xmath115 , namely @xmath116 @xmath117 where @xmath118 , prime @xmath44 denotes the derivative with respect to @xmath119 , @xmath120 , @xmath121 , @xmath122 , @xmath123 , @xmath124 , @xmath125 .",
    "it is shown in refs .",
    "@xcite that the energy for bound states lies in the interval @xmath126 .",
    "we note that the variable @xmath127 is sometimes written @xmath128 , as , for example in the book by messiah @xcite , and the radial functions are often written @xmath129 and @xmath130 as in the book by greiner @xcite .",
    "for @xmath131 these functions vanish at @xmath132 , and , for bound states , they may be normalized by the relation @xmath133 we use inner products _ without _ the radial measure @xmath134 because the factor @xmath135 is already built in to each radial function .",
    "we shall assume that the potential @xmath33 is such that there is a discrete eigenvalue @xmath39 and that eqs.([dcel1 ] ,  [ dcer1 ] ) are the eigenequations for the corresponding radial eigenstates .",
    "now we can state the nodal theorem for @xmath25 .    * nodal theorem in @xmath25 dimensions : *  _",
    "we assume @xmath33 is a negative nondecreasing potential which vanishes at infinity . if @xmath4 and @xmath5 are the numbers of nodes of the upper @xmath16 and lower @xmath17 components of the dirac wave function , then : @xmath136 and @xmath137 _",
    "here we shall prove that near the origin the two components of the dirac wave function start with the same signs if @xmath138 and with the different signs if @xmath139 .",
    "we rewrite the system of eqs.([dcel1 ] ,  [ dcer1 ] ) in the following way @xmath140 @xmath141 where @xmath142 since @xmath40 and the potential @xmath33 is negative , the function @xmath73 .",
    "meanwhile , @xmath143 is a monotone nonincreasing function which can change sign at most once , and if so from positive to negative ; for reasons which will be clear later in section v we consider now only a region where @xmath79 .",
    "we first assume that @xmath138 . since @xmath144 , if @xmath145 near the origin , clearly @xmath146 .",
    "then eq.([dcel3 ] ) implies that @xmath147 .",
    "similarly , if @xmath148 , near @xmath149 , then @xmath150 and it follows from eq.([dcel3 ] ) that @xmath151 .    in the case",
    "@xmath139 , we put @xmath147 near the origin , then @xmath152 has to be nonnegative as well and eq.([dcer3 ] ) leads to @xmath148 .",
    "finally , if @xmath151 , it follows that @xmath153 and eq.([dcer3 ] ) gives @xmath145 .",
    "consequently , near the origin the wave functions @xmath16 and @xmath17 have the same signs if @xmath138 and opposite signs if @xmath139 .      in that section",
    "we shall prove that the two components of the wave function vanish at infinity with different signs . since @xmath154 ,",
    "at infinity , dirac coupled equations eqs.([dcel1 ] ,  [ dcer1 ] ) become @xmath155 @xmath156 we know that the bound - state wave functions must vanish at infinity , so if @xmath145 before it vanishes , then @xmath150 , and if @xmath148 , then @xmath146 . now",
    "if we assume @xmath145 , the above equations lead to @xmath151 and _ vice versa_. this means that at infinity , the component functions @xmath16 and @xmath17 vanish with different signs .",
    "this feature does not depend on the sign of @xmath157 .",
    "now we study the graphs of the wave functions .",
    "we use figures 3 to 10 as illustrations of the nodal theorem for @xmath25 .",
    "we plot upper and lower components of the dirac wave function , @xmath16 and @xmath158 respectively , corresponding to the hellmann potential @xcite in the form @xmath159 , with @xmath160 , @xmath161 , @xmath162 , @xmath111 , @xmath163 , @xmath164 , and @xmath121 .",
    "if @xmath138 ( figure 3 ) both wavefunction components start at the origin with the same sign , but at infinity they must have different signs : thus one of the wave function components will have at least one node more than the other .",
    "when @xmath139 ( figure 4 ) @xmath16 and @xmath17 start with different signs and then vanish with different signs , thus the numbers of nodes in @xmath16 and @xmath17 must be the same or differ by an even number .",
    "we can see from this easiest possible example that the number of nodes of the dirac wave functions depends on the sign of @xmath157 .",
    "these results are generalized by the nodal theorem for @xmath25 .",
    "now we let @xmath165 and @xmath166 . on the interval @xmath167 ,",
    "the nodes of @xmath46 and @xmath47 coincide with the nodes of @xmath16 and @xmath17 , and eqs.([dcel1 ] ,  [ dcer1 ] ) in terms of @xmath46 and @xmath47 become @xmath168 @xmath169 where @xmath142 we immediately have that @xmath73 @xmath170 . as in the one - dimensional case",
    ", we shall prove that the nodes of the radial wave functions @xmath16 and @xmath17 occur only when @xmath75 is nonnegative .",
    "since @xmath154 , and @xmath171 , @xmath81 for @xmath119 sufficiently large .",
    "consider the interval @xmath172 on which @xmath81 and suppose that at a point @xmath173 the function @xmath47 is increasing and has a node . then at @xmath174 , according to eqs.([dcel2 ] ,  [ dcer2 ] ) , the function @xmath46 obeys the following conditions @xmath175 using the fact that @xmath46 and @xmath47 ( @xmath16 and @xmath17 respectively ) must both vanish at infinity we see that at some point @xmath176 , such that there are no nodes or extrema of @xmath47 between @xmath174 and @xmath177 , the function @xmath47 must reach a local maximum and then eventually decrease to zero",
    ". therefore @xmath178 , @xmath179 , @xmath180 . then implies @xmath181 , but leads to @xmath182 , which is a contradiction .",
    "thus the upper and lower components of the dirac wave function intersect the @xmath119 axis only on @xmath78 $ ] where @xmath79 .",
    "if we apply the same reasoning for @xmath183 $ ] , we find no contradiction , and moreover we conclude that the nodes of @xmath16 and @xmath17 are alternating . as in the one - dimensional case",
    "we arrive at the same results if @xmath47 is decreasing near @xmath174 or if we consider @xmath46 instead of @xmath47 .",
    "now , following rose and newton @xcite and using what we call ` dirac spinor orbits ' @xcite , we now consider the graphs generated parametrically by the points @xmath184 , @xmath185 .",
    "we form a vector with initial point at the origin and terminal point @xmath186 , @xmath185 , which makes an angle @xmath187 with @xmath16 axis .",
    "thus @xmath188 from this follows @xmath189 since @xmath190 is positive then @xmath191 direct substitution of @xmath192 and equations eqs.([dcel1 ] ,  [ dcer1 ] ) shows us that @xmath193 satisfies the ricatti equation @xmath194 in the limit as @xmath193 approaches zero we have @xmath195 then if @xmath196 , we have @xmath197 since we consider only the region where nodes occur , i.e. @xmath79 .",
    "thus , from , it follows that @xmath198 is a negative function of @xmath119 for @xmath199 ( or @xmath200 ) and @xmath196 ( or @xmath201 ) , which means that @xmath187 is a decreasing function in the region @xmath202 $ ] where nodes of @xmath16 and @xmath17 occur .",
    "therefore in the @xmath16@xmath17 plane , the vector rotates clockwise .",
    "thus when @xmath157 and @xmath193 are positive ( first and third quadrants ) , a node of @xmath17 occurs first ; and when @xmath157 and @xmath193 are negative ( second and fourth quadrants ) , a node of @xmath16 occurs first .",
    "the case when @xmath138 is illustrated in figure 7 . without loss of generality we consider the first quadrant , thus the wave functions start with the same positive sign and a node of @xmath17 occurs first ; after this , @xmath16 has a node , and so on . at infinity @xmath16 and",
    "@xmath17 vanish with different signs .",
    "therefore the number of nodes in the lower component of the dirac wave function @xmath17 must exceed the number of nodes of @xmath16 by 1 . using the same reasoning for the case @xmath139 , illustrated in figure 8 , we see that when @xmath139 the number of nodes in the upper and lower components of the dirac wave function is the same .",
    "this completes the proof of the theorem .",
    "@xmath107    we also plot the ` dirac spinor orbits ' , figures 5 , 6 , 9 , and 10 , and they confirm the clockwise rotation of .",
    "we note that corresponding orbits can be plotted for @xmath2 case , but the vector would in this case rotate counterclockwise in the representation we have used .",
    "at first sight a general nodal theorem for the dirac equation in @xmath203 dimensions might appear to be out of reach .",
    "however , for central potentials , the bound states in all cases are built from just two radial functions .",
    "for attractive potentials which are no more singular than coulomb and which vanish at large distances , the logical possibilities are limited in a similar fashion to the three - dimensional case first analysed by rose and newton in 1951 .",
    "we are therefore able to establish nodal theorems for all dimensions @xmath0 .",
    "such theorems are useful for the study and computation of bound - state solutions , and they are essential for the establishment of relativistic comparison theorems .",
