    "massive star formation in the milky way spans a broad spectrum , from dispersed , low intensity ob associations to concentrated , high intensity starbursts . within a few hundred parsec of the sun ,",
    "high mass stars ( @xmath2 ) are rather distributed , typically located in loose , spatially extended ob associations ( de zeeuw et al .",
    "a notable exception is orion ob1 , which hosts the orion nebula cluster ( onc ) , responsible for our closest hii region .",
    "further afield , large numbers of massive stars are associated with relatively intense bursts of star formation such as the high mass , compact clusters ( trumpler 14 , 16 ) within the carina nebula giant hii region .",
    "it is generally accepted that the majority of stars form within star clusters ( lada & lada 2003 ) , although recent evidence suggests star formation occurs in a continuum of stellar densities ( e.g. evans et al . 2009 ) . nevertheless , given their short - lifetimes ( 350 myr ) only a few percent of massive stars appear genuinely ` isolated ' ( de wit et al .",
    "2005 ) such that they either tend to be associated with their natal cluster or are plausible runaways from it .",
    "according to weidner & kroupa ( 2006 ) , there is a tight relation between cluster mass , and the most massive star formed within the cluster , although this remains controversial ( calzetti et al .",
    "2010 , eldridge 2012 ) . examples of well known star clusters spanning a range of masses are shown in table  [ table1 ] , all of which are sufficiently young ( @xmath3 myr ) that the most massive stars have yet to end their lives .",
    "we include the most massive star in each cluster , which increases towards the highest mass clusters .    if there is a relation between a cluster and its most massive star , the galaxy - wide stellar initial mass function ( imf ) will also depend upon the cluster mass function and the range of cluster masses , as set out by pflamm - altenburg et al .",
    "( 2007 ) . in normal star - forming galaxies",
    "the cluster mass distribution follows a power law with index @xmath42 , albeit this is truncated at high mass depending upon the rate of star formation ( gieles 2009 ) .",
    "consequently , similar absolute numbers of stars are formed in low mass ( @xmath5 ) , intermediate mass ( @xmath6 ) and high mass ( @xmath7 ) clusters , while high mass stars should be rare in the former .",
    "this is not always the case , since star formation in some nearby dwarf irregular starbursts is strongly biased towards a few very high mass clusters ( e.g. ngc 1569 , hunter et al .",
    "2000 ) .",
    ".selected young star clusters spanning a range of masses , @xmath8 , for which ( initial ) masses of the highest mass stars , @xmath9 , have been determined . [",
    "cols=\"^,>,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]      mindful of the spatial resolution issue , let us turn to the kelly et al .",
    "( 2008 ) study of sne locations with respect to the continuum @xmath10-band light from their low redshift ( @xmath11 ) host galaxies .",
    "kelly et al",
    ". revealed that ic sne are much more likely to be found in the brightest regions of their hosts than ib or ii sne .",
    "an earlier analysis of high redshift galaxies by fruchter et al .",
    "( 2006 ) revealed that long grbs ( @xmath12 = 1.25 ) were also strongly biased towards the brightest pixel of their hosts , in contrast to core - collapse sne ( @xmath12 = 0.63 , presumably mostly type ii - p ) which merely traced the light from their hosts .",
    "kelly et al .",
    "( 2008 ) concluded that if the brightest locations correspond to the largest star - forming regions , type ic sne ( and long grbs ) are restricted to the most massive stars , while type ib and especially type ii - p sne are drawn from stars with more moderate masses , results in common with anderson & james ( 2008 ) .",
    "however , one significant difference between the low - redshift sn h@xmath13 study of anderson & james ( 2008 ) and the high - redshift grb study of fruchter et al .",
    "( 2006 ) is that hosts of the former are relatively high mass , metal - rich spirals , while those of the latter are low mass , metal - poor dwarfs . in normal disk galaxies",
    "the number of stars forming across the mass distribution of star clusters is relatively flat , albeit with a cut - off linked to the star formation intensity ( gieles 2009 ) .",
    "the star cluster mass function is repeated in nearby dwarf galaxies ( cook et al .",
    "2012 ) , but galaxy - wide triggers may induce intense , concentrated bursts of star formation , leading to disproportionately numerous massive star clusters ( billett et al .",
    "2002)11 mpc ) only a quarter of the star formation from dwarf galaxies is formed during starbursts ( lee et al .",
    "2009a ) ] .",
    "we have attempted to set out the potential association between hii regions , ccsne and long grbs in table  [ table3 ] for star forming spirals and irregulars , based upon the above arguments , although exceptions are anticipated ( and subject to uncertainties regarding the main progenitors of type ib / c sne ) .",
    "relatively massive , metal - rich galaxies would represent the primary site of all star formation for the sample of fruchter et al .",
    "( 2006 ) , resulting in ( type ii - p ) ccsne unassociated with the brightest regions in their hosts .",
    "yet , when localised starburst activity does occur , it is very intense ( billett et al .",
    "2002 ) , leading to very massive clusters , and in turn large numbers of high mass , metal - poor stars , a subset of which would be progenitors of the long grbs witnessed by fruchter et al .",
    "the lower limit to the mass of stars is relatively well known ( e.g. burrows et al . 1993 ) , yet establishing whether there is a corresponding upper mass limit has proved elusive ( massey 2011 ) . in part , this is because obtaining robust masses for vms is extremely challenging , and in part because of the scarcity of star clusters that are sufficiently nearby , young and massive for their most massive stars to be studied in detail .",
    "up until recently , a mass limit of @xmath14 has been commonly adopted , based upon a near - ir photometric study of the arches cluster ( figer 2005 ) .",
    "however , it is well known that the temperature of hot , massive stars is rather insensitive to optical / ir photometry .",
    "spectroscopic analysis is required for robust temperatures and in turn luminosities , from which stellar masses are derived .",
    "the situation is especially difficult for the brightest main - sequence members of the most massive young clusters , which possess unusual ( emission line ) spectral morphologies , reminiscent of wolf - rayet stars ( e.g. drissen et al .",
    "the mass - luminosity relationship for main - sequence vms is relatively flat , @xmath15 ( e.g. crowther et al .",
    "2012 ) , so inferred masses are particularly sensitive to temperature , @xmath16 .",
    "recent advances in atmospheric models for stars with dense stellar winds has led to an upward revision to the temperatures of such stars , by @xmath1725% , corresponding to as much as an 80% increase in the resulting mass .",
    "fortunately , several very massive , double - lined eclipsing binaries have been identified within the past few years , including the wolf - rayet binary ngc 3603 a1 ( schnurr et al . 2008 ) , permitting an independent check on spectroscopic results for similar systems .",
    "r136 , the central ionizing cluster of 30 dor , has both a very high stellar mass ( @xmath1755,000 @xmath18 ) and a sufficiently young age ( 12 myr ) for its most massive stars not to have undergone core - collapse .",
    "previous estimates of their stellar masses , based on conventional o star calibrations , implied 120  155 @xmath18 ( massey & hunter 1998 ) .",
    "schnurr et al .",
    "( 2009 ) searched for close binaries among the visually brightest members , but none revealed radial velocities , with the possible exception of r136c .",
    "still , their near - ir integral field datasets provided spatially resolved spectroscopy of individual stars within r136 , which , together with archival uv / optical spectroscopy and ao - assisted photometry permitted a reassessment of their stellar masses .",
    "spectroscopic analyses together with new evolutionary models for vms enabled crowther et al .",
    "( 2010 ) to revise their ( current ) stellar masses upward to 135265 @xmath18 .",
    "initial masses of 165320 @xmath18 were inferred , adopting standard main - sequence mass - loss rates for vms ( vink et al .",
    "2001 ) which closely matched spectroscopically - derived values , and were reinforced by the close agreement between spectroscopic and dynamical masses obtained for ngc 3603-a1 .",
    "overall , r136 supports the trend that higher ( initial ) mass stars reside within the most massive star clusters set out by weidner & kroupa ( 2006 ) .",
    "however , statistics of high mass clusters for which accurate stellar masses have been determined remain very poor .      based upon their re - assessment of the most massive stars in r136 and other young , high mass clusters ( arches , ngc 3603 ) , crowther et al .",
    "( 2010 ) concluded that their stellar content was consistent with a revised upper mass limit of @xmath19 .",
    "regardless of the physical origin of this limit , such high initial masses raise the prospect of extremely luminous core - collapse sne ( waldman 2008 ) or even pair - instability sne ( heger & woosley 2002 ) .",
    "models have recently been calculated for the post - main sequence evolution of vms spanning a range of metallicities ( n. yusof , these proc . ) . from these , would appear that the vms in r136 will end their lives as core - collapse sne , with lower metallicity ( smc - like ) required to reduce mass - loss rates sufficiently for pair - instability sne , as has been proposed for sn 2007bi ( gal - yam et al .",
    "however , details remain very sensitive to mass - loss prescriptions for the post - main sequence evolution ( e.g. crowther et al . 2012 ) ."
