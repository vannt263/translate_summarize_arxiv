    "in two previous papers @xcite we have outlined a new approach to the @xmath0nnn  nnn problem , which can be regarded as the natural extension of the grassberger ",
    "sandhas ( gs ) n  body method @xcite to situations in which the number of particles is no longer conserved .",
    "as is well  known , the gs formalism represents a basic achievement in modern n  body scattering theory .",
    "it casts in a physically transparent form the connected  kernel yakubovski ( y ) scheme @xcite , which enjoys the distinctive feature of being completely free from non  physical solutions .",
    "indeed , not only it guarantees that the fredholm alternative holds , so that non  physical solutions do not contaminate the physical one in the scattering region , but it satisfies also a constrained fredholm alternative @xcite ; the non  trivial solutions of the associated homogeneous equations are in one  to  one correspondence with the bound states of the total system .",
    "most of the connected  kernel n ",
    "body equations proposed in the literature satisfy the former condition , but fail in guaranteeing the latter .",
    "the extension of the gs formalism considers scattering and pion production / absorption processes on equal footing , thus providing a coupled treatment of all the relevant processes in the same dynamically consistent framework .",
    "the @xmath0 production introduces radical changes in the structure of the dynamical equations and gives rise to challenges and problems which were not possible in standard n  body theories .    on a fundamental level",
    ", there is the problem with nucleon renormalization , which is unavoidable in theories where the fock space is truncated to states with at most one pion .",
    "this problem is well acknowledged in the literature @xcite , and herein is not discussed .",
    "the first problem considered in this paper concerns the connectedness of the @xmath0nnn integral equations , and we arrive at the conclusion that , contrary to our previous belief @xcite , these equations are not connected . in this paper",
    "we identify a class of graphs , previously overlooked , which prevents the kernel from being connected .",
    "we show that the problem arises when the @xmath1 ( ( @xmath0nn)n ) and @xmath2 ( ( nn)(@xmath0n ) ) partitions are treated on equal footing , and that connectedness can be restored with two iterations of the kernel if the coupling between the @xmath0nnn and nnn sectors is switched off in the @xmath2 partitions , whereas it is treated exactly in the @xmath0nn sub  systems . as a matter of fact",
    ", connectedness is guaranteed also when production / absorption processes are allowed in @xmath2 partitions , provided that the exact sub  system amplitudes are projected in the sole @xmath0nnn sector .",
    "the second problem we analyze in detail is the problem with the identification of certain physical transition amplitudes which refer to the nucleon  deuteron channel .",
    "the ambiguities in the definition of these amplitudes are originated by the delicate interplay between the @xmath2 and @xmath1 partitions , and are closely related with the connectedness problem .",
    "indeed , with the same approximation scheme we restore the connectedness in our equations and solve these amplitude ambiguities .",
    "the extension of the gs approach to the @xmath0nnn system is briefly illustrated in sect .",
    "[ revrev ] . starting from the transition",
    "amplitudes for @xmath3 processes , one first extracts operators referring to three ",
    "cluster@xmath4 three ",
    "cluster transitions , which satisfy dynamical equations formally identical to the afnan  blankleider ( ab ) equations for the @xmath0nn  nn system @xcite . by resorting to the powerful gs matrix technique ,",
    "the two  cluster partitions are introduced into the theory , and one gets at the end dynamical equations quite similar in structure to the gs four  body equations .",
    "the presence of emission / absorption processes , however , implies some noticeable differences , when these equations are analyzed in detail . the chain  of  partition labelling , characterizing the ygs approach , is now more complex , since one has to regard nucleon pairs both as three  cluster partitions in the @xmath0nnn sector , and as two  cluster partitions in the nnn space . as a consequence , one deals with a set of 24 coupled equations , in place of the 18 characterizing the standard ygs scheme .    in sect .",
    "[ res ] we establish the relation between the employed operators , labelled by chains of partitions , and the physical amplitudes connecting the various partitions of the system . as is well - known in non ",
    "relativistic scattering theory , the physical transition amplitudes can be identified by exhibiting the momentum ",
    "space singular terms of the total green function , in correspondence to the bound states of the various sub ",
    "systems @xcite .",
    "this procedure , which has its relativistic counterpart in reduction formulae of quantum field theory @xcite , is often referred to as the residue method @xcite .",
    "alternatively , one can work in the language of transition operators .",
    "for the standard n  body problem , by combining the residue rule with the gs matrix technique , it has been shown @xcite that the two  cluster@xmath4two - cluster transition amplitudes can be related to the solution of the n  body ygs equations , starting from the transition amplitudes for n@xmath4n processes . here ,",
    "as anticipated in @xcite , we generalize this procedure to the @xmath0nnn  nnn case , where the coupling between spaces with different numbers of particles has to be taken into account . starting from the relations expressing the @xmath3 transition",
    "amplitudes in terms of operators referring to less and less clusterized partitions , we systematically identify the poles associated to the bound  states or resonances in the various two and three  body sub ",
    "systems . as the outcome of this procedure , we express both the rearrangement and the meson absorption / emission transition amplitudes in terms of the solution of our chain ",
    "labelled equations . finally ,",
    "in the same section , we discuss also the ambiguities in the identification of the physical amplitudes , and the associated role played by the @xmath1 and @xmath2 partitions in this problem .    in sect .",
    "[ qps ] we consider the quasi  particle ",
    "approximation ( qpa ) . in the four  body case",
    ", this amounts to a two  step procedure @xcite .",
    "one first replaces the two  body t  matrices with finite ",
    "rank operators , thereby re  writing the ygs equations as effective faddeev equations for two elementary particles and a composite object ; as a second step , one approximates again the three  body and @xmath2 sub  system amplitudes by finite  rank operators .",
    "one thus obtains multichannel lippmann ",
    "schwinger  type ( ls ) equations in one vector variable , coupling the elastic / rearrangement transition amplitudes .",
    "the physical transition amplitudes for break  up processes can be evaluated starting from the solution of the effective ls equations through simple quadratures .",
    "we show here that the qpa can be extended to the present situation . here",
    "also the two  fragment@xmath4two  fragment transition amplitudes satisfy ls equations , all the break  up and emission / absorption amplitudes being expressible in terms of them by quadratures .",
    "the qpa approach is particularly attractive because it shows the theory through diagrams which can be easily interpreted .",
    "it is then possible to view the diagrams which are at the origin of the disconnectedness problem .",
    "these disconnected graphs are self  energy  type contributions to the transition from a ( @xmath0n)(nn ) to a n(@xmath0nn ) configuration with intermediate zero  pion state .",
    "if this term is disregarded , one gets connected  kernel equations , much as in the standard four  body problem .",
    "needless to say , the same is true if emission / absorption processes are switched off in @xmath2 sub ",
    "systems , or allowed only in the sub  system amplitudes referring to the four  body sector .    given the present situation , we review in sect .",
    "[ finis ] the approaches available in literature @xcite . in @xcite one applies the quasi ",
    "particle approximation to the basic ab equations , and removes the disconnected pieces occurring in the standard four  body problem first , by resorting to the usual gs method . all disconnected terms due to pion emission / absorption are then treated together , by use of a two  potential formula .",
    "disconnected contributions are formally regarded as an auxiliary problem , whose solution gives the input for connected  kernel equations yielding the physical transition operators . as a consequence",
    ", the actual transition amplitudes can be evaluated only solving nested sets of integral equations . finally , these rigorous fy  type approaches are compared to the effective , coupled  channel formalism of ref .",
    "it turns out that this phenomenological method is at variance with present few ",
