    "the production of @xmath1 mesons in nucleon - nucleon collisions has attracted a considerable attention in the last years @xcite .. @xcite . due to the relatively high mass of the @xmath1 meson",
    "its production requires a large momentum transfer between the initial and final states . at threshold",
    "this momentum transfer is given by @xmath2 , where @xmath3 and @xmath4 are the nucleon and @xmath1 meson masses , and amounts to 770 mev / c .",
    "this large momentum transfer translates into a short distance between the two interacting nucleons ( @xmath5 fm ) .",
    "therefore @xmath1 production permits the investigation of short range hadron dynamics and provides a tool to probe the behavior of nucleon - nucleon interaction at small distances .",
    "the mechanism of @xmath1 production in nucleon - nucleon collisions is yet not well understood . as the @xmath1 meson couples strongly to the @xmath6(1535 mev ) , it has been assumed that this resonance is predominantly involved in its production .",
    "the mechanism of the excitation of this resonance in hadronic collisions remains in turn an open question .",
    "as the dominant excitation mechanism both @xmath7 and @xmath1 exchange have been assumed @xcite . according to other calculations however , @xmath8 meson exchange is supposed to be responsible mainly for the excitation of the @xmath6 resonance @xcite , @xcite .",
    "the shape of the angular distribution in the @xmath9 reaction reflects the properties of the exchanged meson in the excitation of the @xmath6 resonance . in ref .",
    "@xcite it is shown that in spite of the dominance of the resonance amplitude the effects of relatively small mesonic currents can be seen in the shape of the @xmath1 angular distribution due to interference .",
    "on the other hand , according to a recent approach @xcite the @xmath6 resonance is less involved in the production of the @xmath1 meson . in this approach",
    "the @xmath1 meson production is mainly due to the short range amplitude of the nucleon - nucleon interaction . as the @xmath1 is the lightest meson containing @xmath10 quarks",
    "the question of direct production channels is interesting because it may be related to the @xmath10 content of the proton .",
    "the production of the @xmath1 meson also poses another interesting aspect .",
    "the @xmath1 meson interacts strongly with the nucleon and in its production the final state @xmath1-nucleon interaction should play an important role .",
    "the near threshold dependence of the observed total cross section for @xmath1 production differs substantially from that for @xmath7 and @xmath11 production , pointing to an enhancement of the measured cross section which can be ascribed to a strong attraction in @xmath1-nucleon interaction @xcite .",
    "more data of improved precision will undoubtedly contribute to a better understanding of the @xmath9 reaction .",
    "the external proton beam with a diameter of 1 - 2  mm impinges on a 4  mm thick liquid hydrogen target enclosed with plastic foils of only 0.9  @xmath12 thickness @xcite .",
    "the start and stop counters have azimuthal symmetry with holes for the beam such that only reaction particles hit the counters .",
    "three scintillators with holes of 8  mm , 5  mm and 2  mm diameter placed 1  m , 0.5  m and 10  cm in front of the target are used to veto the beam halo .",
    "the incident beam and the whole detection system are enclosed in vacuum in order to minimize multiple scattering and secondary reactions ( fig .",
    "[ experimentalsetup ] ) .",
    "a 0.5 mm thick scintillator counter is used as start counter .",
    "it has an inner hole of 3 mm diameter and is arranged in two cones each of 16 individual counters @xcite .",
    "the stop counters are divided into the inner part ( quirl counter with 96 channels in 3 layers@xcite ) , the ring counter with 192 channels in 3 layers and the barrel counter with 192 channels @xcite . the high granularity of the stop scintillators results in a resolution for the azimuthal angle of @xmath13 - @xmath14 and for the polar angle of typically @xmath15 .",
    "the acceptance for charged particles in @xmath16 is @xmath17 , for @xmath18 it ranges from @xmath19 - @xmath20 .",
    "the time of flight is measured with a resolution of 1% of the typical time of flight for protons of the @xmath21 reaction close to threshold . for the measurement with a beam momentum of 2025 mev / c ( corresponding to an excess energy @xmath22 of the pp@xmath1 system of 15  mev ) the trigger condition was to measure at least two charged tracks in the quirl and at least one charged track in the start counter . for the beam momentum of 2100 mev / c ( @xmath22 = 41  mev ) the charged tracks in the ring counter were added to the trigger in order to take into account the larger opening angle of the protons .",
    "the @xmath1 is reconstructed from the tracks of both protons . for each track",
    "the particle momentum is calculated from the time of flight and the measured directions with the mass of the proton assumed .",
    "the missing mass is calculated from momentum and energy conservation as @xmath23 @xmath24 is the four momentum of the particles .",
    "only two charged track events are taken into account , such that events with the @xmath1 decaying into charged particles hitting the ring or quirl counter are discarded .",
    "pion tracks result in very low or negative squared missing masses if the mass of the proton is assumed . near the kinematical limit , which corresponds to a missing mass of 562.5 mev/@xmath25 ( @xmath22 = 15  mev ) and 588.5 mev/@xmath25 ( @xmath22 = 41  mev ) , only proton tracks from pp@xmath1 and multi - pion production events are contributing . in order to reduce the amount of background events , a first selection on the squared missing mass is applied ( @xmath26  @xmath27 ) .",
    "this cut and the condition on the particle time of flight corresponding to velocities of @xmath28 are the only cuts applied in the analysis .",
    "the measured data are compared with simulated data obtained with a monte carlo program , which is based on the geant3 code .",
    "it generates a data sample which is analyzed using the same evaluation routines as for the measured data .",
    "as time resolution for each layer of the scintillation counters 250 ps ( @xmath29 ) for the stop counters and 150 ps ( @xmath29 ) for the start counters was determined .",
    "the width of the @xmath1 signal in the missing mass distribution is well reproduced for both excess energies ( fig .",
    "[ missing - mass - data - mc ] ) .",
    "the width of the @xmath1 signal is 0.8% ( fwhm ) of the @xmath1 mass for @xmath22=15  mev and 1.3% for @xmath22=41  mev . the overall reconstruction efficiency including the acceptance and the constraint of having no charged pions of the @xmath1 decay in the forward detector was 68% for @xmath22=15 mev and 69% for @xmath22=41  mev .",
    "the distribution of the invariant proton - proton mass is parameterized by the measured distribution and used instead of the pure phase space as input for the monte carlo calculation .",
    "this influences the monte carlo results mainly at forward - backward @xmath1-directions for the lower excess energy .",
    "the normalization of the angular distributions affected by this correction amounts to less than 10 % ( s. fig .",
    "[ wineta - mc ] ) . for the excess energy of 41  mev",
    "this correction is less than 2% .",
    "the pp@xmath1 system in the final state is described by 12 variables , of which 7 are fixed by momentum and energy conservation and the particle masses .",
    "2 variables are given by the invariant masses @xmath30 and @xmath31 .",
    "the remaining 3 variables describe the orientation of the pp@xmath1 system with respect to the incoming proton axis . for these variables",
    "we choose the angle of the @xmath1 momentum in the center of mass frame with respect to the beam axis ( @xmath32 ) and the angle of the relative momentum of the proton proton system to the beam axis ( @xmath33 ) .",
    "the remaining variable is the azimuthal orientation , which is of no significance in this unpolarized measurement .    in order to obtain differential cross sections with respect to the quantities @xmath34 , @xmath35 , @xmath36 , and @xmath37 for @xmath38",
    "the continuum background in the pp missing mass has to be subtracted .",

    "[ winetaueberblick ] . for each of 10 equidistant bins between @xmath39 and @xmath40 pp",
    "missing mass spectra were generated . in each missing mass distribution",
    "the number of @xmath1 events is determined by fitting a polynomial of 3rd degree to the background and a gaussian distribution to the @xmath1 signal .",
    "the fit is done recursively by removing the fitted signal from the overall measured distribution and fitting the background again .",
    "the width of the @xmath1 signal in the missing mass varies with the center of mass angle of the @xmath1 due to the corresponding different velocities of the protons resulting in different missing mass resolutions .",
    "therefore the limits for integrating the @xmath1 signal are varying .",
    "these limits are determined from the width of the @xmath1 signal of monte carlo calculations .    in the same way differential cross section distributions for @xmath34 , @xmath35 , and @xmath37",
    "were obtained by fitting background and @xmath1 peak in the pp missing mass and subtracting the background as a function of @xmath34 , @xmath35 , and @xmath37 respectively .",
    "the angular distributions are normalized to the total cross sections of 2.11 @xmath41 ( @xmath22=15  mev ) and 4.92 @xmath41 ( @xmath22=41  mev ) which are taken from ref .",
