    "closed - orbit theory @xcite has proven to be the key tool to analyze the photoabsorption spectra of atoms in external fields .",
    "it interprets spectral oscillations semiclassically in terms of closed orbits of the underlying classical system , i.e. of classical orbits starting at and returning to the nucleus .",
    "a complete semiclassical description of an atomic spectrum therefore requires a sufficiently detailed understanding of the classical closed orbits .",
    "in particular , the possible types of closed - orbit bifurcations must be described , so that the generation of new closed orbits upon varying the external field strengths can be accounted for .    for the hydrogen atom in a magnetic field",
    ", the systematics of closed orbits and their bifurcations has been known for a long time @xcite . for the hydrogen atom in crossed electric and magnetic fields ,",
    "the classical mechanics is much more complicated because three non - separable degrees of freedom have to be dealt with .",
    "although a number of closed orbits have been identified in experimental or theoretical quantum spectra @xcite , a systematic study of these orbits and their bifurcations is still lacking .",
    "considerable effort has been spent during the past decade on the study of the classical mechanics of the crossed - fields hydrogen atom in the limit of weak external fields @xcite .",
    "that work relies on the observation that for weak external fields the principal quantum number @xmath0 , or its classical analogue @xmath1 , is conserved to a higher degree of precision than the angular - momentum and lenz vectors @xmath2 and @xmath3 .",
    "the latter are conserved in the pure kepler problem , but acquire a slow time - dependence in weak fields , so that the electron can be visualized as moving on a slowly precessing kepler ellipse .",
    "the most important result in the present context is the finding first described in @xcite that there are four kepler ellipses that remain unperturbed by the external fields to first order in the field strength , i.e. among the continuous infinity of periodic orbits of the unperturbed kepler proble there are four orbits that are periodic even in the presence of external fields .",
    "these fundamental periodic orbits can be regarded as the roots of `` family trees '' of periodic orbits .",
    "more complicated orbits are created out of the fundamental orbits by bifurcations as the field strengths increase .    however",
    ", none of the fundamental periodic orbits is closed at the nucleus .",
    "their knowledge therefore does not aid in the classification of closed orbits .",
    "a first systematic study of closed orbits in the crossed - fields system and their bifurcations was performed by wang and delos @xcite .",
    "these authors presented orderly sequences of bifurcations of planar closed orbits ( i.e. orbits in the plane perpendicular to the magnetic field ) , which they interpreted in terms of an integrable model hamiltonian .    in the present paper",
    "we undertake a systematic investigation of closed orbits and their bifurcations in the crossed - fields hydrogen atom . in section  [ sec : classham ] , the symmetries of the hamiltonian are briefly reviewed .",
    "section  [ sec : bifgen ] presents the general framework of a local bifurcation theory of closed orbits , and section  [ sec : cod1bif ] describes the generic codimension - one bifurcations .",
    "a discussion of complex ghost orbits is included in each case because they are known to play an important role in semiclassics @xcite . in section  [ sec : closeddkp ] , the closed orbits in the hydrogen atom in a magnetic field are surveyed .",
    "section  [ sec : xco ] then details the bifurcation scenarios actually observed in the crossed - fields system .",
    "it is shown that the elementary codimension - one bifurcations actually form the building blocks of the bifurcations scenarios , but that in many cases complicated scenarios consisting of several elementary bifurcations occur . in section  [ sec : class ] , a heuristic classification scheme for the closed orbits in crossed fields is proposed which is based on the well - known classification for the closed orbits in a magnetic field .",
    "the actual semiclassical quantization of the crossed - fields hydrogen atom in the framework of closed - orbit theory , which is based on the results presented here , is described in an accompanying paper @xcite .",
    "throughout this work , we will assume the magnetic field to be directed along the @xmath4-axis and the electric field to be directed along the @xmath5-axis . in atomic units ,",
    "the hamiltonian describing the motion of the atomic electron then reads @xmath6 where @xmath7 , @xmath8 and @xmath9 is the @xmath4-component of the angular momentum vector . by virtue of the scaling properties of the hamiltonian  ( [ specham ] )",
    ", the dynamics does not depend on the energy @xmath10 and the field strengths @xmath11 and @xmath12 separately , but only on the scaled energy @xmath13 and the scaled electric field strength @xmath14 . upon scaling ,",
    "all classical quantities are multiplied by suitable powers of the magnetic field strength @xmath11 . in particular ,",
    "classical actions scale according to @xmath15 .",
    "these scaling prescriptions will be used throughout this work .    in crossed fields ,",
    "two angles are required to characterize the starting or returning direction of a closed orbit .",
    "we will use the polar angle @xmath16 between the trajectory and the magnetic field axis and the azimuthal angle @xmath17 between the projection of the trajectory into the @xmath5-@xmath18-plane and the electric field axis .",
    "the hydrogen atom in crossed fields does not possess any continuous symmetries so that , apart from the energy , no constant of the motion exists and three non - separable degrees of freedom have to be dealt with .",
    "there are , however , three discrete symmetry transformations of the crossed - fields system , namely    * the reflection  at the @xmath5-@xmath18-plane , * the combination  of time - reversal and a reflection at the @xmath5-@xmath4-plane , * the combination =  of the above .    the effects of the transformations on the initial and final angles of a closed orbit are summarized in table  [ tab : symmang ] .",

    "singlets satisfy @xmath19 and @xmath20 . [ cols=\"^,^,>,^,>,^ \" , ]     an overview of the bifurcation scenarios to be expected when @xmath21 can be obtained from a description of the possible modes of behavior of the poincar map .",
    "this can most conveniently be achieved if the poincar map is represented by a generating function @xcite .",
    "the generating function can be chosen to depend on any combination of initial and final positions and momenta , as long as they form a complete set of independent coordinates .",
    "we adopt the well - known conventions of goldstein @xcite for denoting different types of generating functions , which are summarized in table  [ genfcttab ] .    for a generic symplectic map ,",
    "all possible sets of coordinates and momenta are independent , so that generating functions of any type exist . at a closed - orbit bifurcation , however , a degeneracy indicated by the condition that @xmath22 be singular arises , so that care must be taken in choosing a generating function . loosely speaking ,",
    "if @xmath11 is singular , @xmath23 can not be determined from @xmath24 and @xmath25 , so that it may be conjectured that no generating function of type @xmath26 exists . to confirm this conjecture , we study a linear symplectic map @xmath27 with four matrices",
    "@xmath28 satisfying the symplecticity conditions @xcite @xmath29 where @xmath30 denotes the transpose . a generating function for the linear map ( [ linsymp ] ) must be quadratic in its variables . from the ansatz @xmath31 with matrices @xmath32 ,",
    "the map ( [ linsymp ] ) is obtained if @xmath33 the two expressions given for @xmath34 are equal by virtue of  ( [ sympcond ] ) .",
    "as expected , a generating function of type @xmath26 does not exist if @xmath11 is singular .",
    "a similar calculation can be carried out for the other types of generating functions . for each type ,",
    "one of the matrices @xmath35 must be non - singular .",
    "these results are given in table  [ genfcttab ] .",
    "locally , they can be extended to non - linear maps by means of the implicit function theorem .",
    "thus , at a bifurcation of closed orbits the poincar map generically possesses generating functions of all types except @xmath26 .",
    "the most convenient choice is a function of type @xmath36 .",
    "the transformation equations associated with this type of generating function read @xmath37 closed orbits are characterized by @xmath38 .",
    "they therefore agree with the stationary points of the @xmath39 function .",
    "the classification problem of closed - orbit bifurcation theory can thus be rephrased as the problem to determine how stationary points of a real function change upon the variation of parameters .",
    "this question is the subject of catastrophe theory @xcite .",
    "catastrophe theory studies smooth real - valued functions @xmath40 and @xmath41 defined in a neighborhood of the origin in an @xmath0-dimensional configuration space .",
    "they are said to be equivalent if there is a diffeomorphism @xmath42 of the configuration space so that @xmath43 the coordinate transformation @xmath44 maps the stationary points of @xmath45 to those of @xmath46 . in this sense , the distributions of stationary points of @xmath46 and @xmath47 agree qualitatively . without loss of generality",
    "it can be assumed that @xmath46 and @xmath47 have stationary points at the origin , because any stationary point can be moved there by a coordinate transformation . after adding a constant",
    ", one has @xmath48 .",
    "@xmath46 is said to be structurally stable if any small perturbation @xmath47 of @xmath46 ( i.e. @xmath49 with a smooth function @xmath50 and sufficiently small @xmath51 ) is equivalent to @xmath46 .",
    "notice that catastrophe theory is a purely local theory .",
    "it is concerned with the structural stability or instability of a single stationary point and the pattern of stationary points that can be generated from a structurally unstable stationary point by a small perturbation .     in @xmath52 for the case ( a )",
    "@xmath53 and ( b ) @xmath54 .",
    "the dashed lines indicate the position of the manifold at slightly varied parameter values . only in case ( a ) additional intersections with the plane @xmath55 can arise.,title=\"fig : \" ]   in @xmath52 for the case ( a )",
    "@xmath53 and ( b ) @xmath54 .",
    "the dashed lines indicate the position of the manifold at slightly varied parameter values . only in case ( a ) additional intersections with the plane @xmath55 can arise.,title=\"fig : \" ]    in the present context ,",
    "non - bifurcating closed orbits correspond to structurally stable stationary points of @xmath39 , because a small variation of parameters will bring about a variation of @xmath39 which is small in the above sense and preserves the stationary point .",
    "the most elementary result of catastrophe theory states that a stationary point of a function @xmath46 is structurally stable if its hessian matrix , i.e. the matrix of second derivatives of @xmath46 , is non - singular . for the linear symplectic transformation ( [ linsymp ] ) ,",
    "the @xmath39 generating function is @xmath56 so that its hessian determinant at @xmath57 can be found to be @xmath58 the hessian matrix of @xmath39 is thus singular if either @xmath59 or @xmath60 is .",
    "it has been shown above that bifurcations of closed orbits can only occur if @xmath21 , i.e. a bifurcating orbit corresponds to a degenerate stationary point of @xmath39 .",
    "the case @xmath61 also leads to a degeneracy of @xmath39 , but it can not be associated with a closed - orbit bifurcation .",
    "this can also be understood geometrically : as illustrated in figure  [ degenfig ] , if @xmath62 , the lagrangian manifold given by @xmath63 is tangent to the plane @xmath55 , so that it can develop further intersections with that plane upon a small variation of parameters .",
    "if @xmath61 , the manifold is tangent to the plane @xmath64 , whence , upon a variation of parameters , it can acquire additional intersections with that plane , but not with the plane @xmath55 , so that no bifurcation of closed orbits can arise .",
    "the discussion of stationary points with degenerate hessian matrices , also called `` catastrophes '' , is simplified considerably by the splitting lemma of catastrophe theory  @xcite .",
    "it states that if the dimension of the configuration space is @xmath0 and a function @xmath46 on the configuration space has a stationary point at the origin whose hessian matrix has rank @xmath65 , a coordinate system @xmath66 can be introduced in a neighborhood of the stationary point so that @xmath67 where @xmath68 is a non - degenerate quadratic form of @xmath65 variables and the function @xmath69 has a stationary point with zero hessian matrix at the origin . as the non - degenerate stationary point of @xmath68",
    "is structurally stable , the behavior of the stationary points of @xmath46 under a small perturbation is determined by @xmath69 only .",
    "the number of relevant variables is thus only @xmath70 , which is called the corank of the catastrophe .",
    "it will be assumed henceforth that a splitting according to  ( [ splitting ] ) has been carried out and the non - degenerate part @xmath68 is ignored , so that the hessian matrix of @xmath46 vanishes at the origin .    under a small perturbation of the function @xmath46 , a degenerate stationary point will in general split into several distinct stationary points .",
    "this process will be used to model bifurcations of closed orbits .",
    "the degenerate stationary points relevant to bifurcation theory are those of finite codimension , i.e. those for which there are smooth functions @xmath71 so that any small perturbation of @xmath46 is equivalent to @xmath72 with suitably chosen constants @xmath73 .",
    "the function @xmath74 is called an unfolding of @xmath40 , because the degenerate stationary point of @xmath46 can be regarded as a set of several stationary points that accidentally coincide and are `` unfolded '' by the parameters @xmath73 .",
    "the smallest value of @xmath75 that can be chosen in ( [ unfolding ] ) is called the codimension of @xmath46 .",
    "an unfolding of @xmath46 with @xmath75 equal to the codimension of @xmath46 is referred to as universal .    in the bifurcation problem ,",
    "the generating function @xmath39 depends on external control parameters @xmath76 such as , e.g. , the energy @xmath10 or the external field strengths .",
    "if , for a critical value of the parameters , @xmath39 has a degenerate stationary point equivalent to that of @xmath46 , in a neighborhood of the critical value @xmath39 is equivalent to the unfolding ( [ unfolding ] ) , where the unfolding parameters @xmath73 are smooth functions of the control parameters @xmath77 .",
    "the critical parameter values themselves are characterized by the condition that all unfolding parameters vanish , i.e. by the set of equations @xmath78 these are @xmath75 equations in @xmath79 unknowns .",
    "they can `` generically '' only be expected to possess a solution if @xmath80 , that is , the codimension of the degenerate stationary point must not be larger than the number of external parameters .",
    "this construction introduces a notion of codimension for bifurcations of closed orbits which is entirely analogous to the codimension of bifurcations of periodic orbits : bifurcations of a codimension higher than the number of external parameters can not be expected to occur because they are structurally unstable . under a small perturbation of the system they would split into a sequence of `` generic '' bifurcations of lower codimensions .",
    "the considerations of the preceding section reduce the bifurcation theory for closed orbits to the problem of determining all catastrophes having a codimension smaller than the number of external parameters .",
    "in particular , it explains why only catastrophes of finite codimension are relevant . in the crossed - fields system ,",
    "the number of parameters is two , if the scaling properties are taken into account .",
    "however , we will only describe bifurcations of codimension one in the following .",
    "they suffice to describe the bifurcations encountered if a single parameter is varied while the second is kept fixed . they also give a good impression of the codimension - two scenarios because a bifurcation of codimension two must split into a sequence of codimension - one bifurcations as soon as any of the parameters is changed .    for generic functions without special symmetries ,",
    "a list of catastrophes of codimensions up to six with their universal unfoldings is readily available in the literature @xcite .",
    "the classification of closed - orbit bifurcations presented here relies on these results .",
    "there is a single catastrophe of codimension one , which has corank one and is known as the fold catastrophe .",
    "its universal unfolding is given by @xmath81 with @xmath82 denoting the unfolding parameter .",
    "the fold has two stationary points at @xmath83 where it assumes the stationary values @xmath84 the second derivative in the stationary points is @xmath85 the stationary points are real if @xmath86 . if @xmath87 , there are no stationary points on the real axis , because the solutions ( [ foldstat ] ) are imaginary .",
    "these complex stationary points correspond to closed ghost orbits in the complexified phase space .",
    "as @xmath82 is varied , a tangent bifurcation occurs at @xmath88 , where two complex conjugate ghost orbits turn into two real orbits or vice versa .",
    "all qualitative features of the bifurcation are described by the normal form ( [ fold ] ) .",
    "the stationary points , i.e. the closed orbits , initially move apart as @xmath89 . a more detailed connection between the properties of the normal form and the closed orbits can be made in the context of uniform semiclassical approximations .",
    "the difference between the stationary values gives the action difference between the closed orbits , whereas the second derivatives  or , if the normal form has corank greater than one , the hessian determinants  at the stationary points are proportional to a parameter @xmath90 describing the stability of the closed orbit ( see @xcite for details ) .",
    "all these quantities are shown in figure  [ foldfig ] .",
    "when they are compared to the corresponding quantities calculated for an actual bifurcation in section  [ sec : xco ] , the qualitative agreement will become clear .",
    "the fold catastrophe ( [ fold ] ) describes the generation of two closed orbits in a tangent bifurcation .",
    "as this is the only generic catastrophe of codimension one , it follows that the tangent bifurcation is the only possible type of closed - orbit bifurcations .",
    "in particular , once it has been generated a closed orbit can not split into several orbits , as periodic orbits typically do .",
    "however , this statement needs some modification due to the presence of reflection symmetries in the crossed - fields system .",
    "if the orbit under study is symmetric under one of the reflections , i.e. it is a singlet or a doublet orbit , the generating function @xmath39 in the neighborhood of this orbit must also possess this reflection symmetry . by this constraint ,",
    "several of the elementary catastrophes are excluded altogether . for others ,",
    "the codimension is reduced because the unfolding can only contain symmetric terms .",
    "one additional catastrophe of codimension one arises , viz . the symmetrized version of the cusp catastrophe @xmath91 this normal form possesses the reflection symmetry @xmath92 , so that the origin is mapped onto itself under the symmetry transformation .",
    "there is a stationary point at the origin for all values of the parameter @xmath82 , corresponding to a closed orbit which is invariant under the reflection .",
    "additional stationary points are located at @xmath93 they are real if @xmath86 and are mapped onto each other under a reflection . thus , the symmetric cusp ( [ cusp ] ) describes a pitchfork bifurcation at @xmath88 , where two asymmetric orbits bifurcate off a symmetric orbit , generating a quartet from a doublet or a doublet from a singlet .",
    "the stationary values at the asymmetric stationary points are given by @xmath94 the second derivative is @xmath95 both the stationary values and the values of the second derivative are real even for @xmath87 , when the stationary points themselves are complex .",
    "therefore , these stationary points correspond to ghost orbits having real actions and stability determinants .",
    "the existence of this remarkable type of ghost orbits is again a consequence of the reflection symmetry : as the stationary points  ( [ cuspsp ] ) are imaginary , the reflection @xmath92 changes a stationary point and its stationary value into their complex conjugates . on the other hand ,",
    "the stationary values are invariant under the reflection , so they must be real .",
    "a ghost orbit having this symmetry property will be referred to as a symmetric ghost orbit .",
    "the characteristic quantities of the symmetric cusp catastrophe are shown in figure  [ cuspfig ] as a function of @xmath82 .",
    "again , they describe the qualitative behavior of the bifurcating orbits close to the bifurcation .",
    "it should be noted that the stationary values ( [ cuspval ] ) are negative for all values of @xmath82 , so that for a bifurcation described by ( [ cusp ] ) , the actions of the asymmetric orbits must be smaller than those of the symmetric orbit .",
    "an alternative bifurcation scenario is described by the dual cusp , viz .",
    "the negative of ( [ cusp ] ) .",
    "the dual cusp is inequivalent to the regular cusp , but the scenario it describes agrees with the above except that the stationary values and the second derivatives change their signs , so that the actions of the asymmetric orbits are now larger than that of the symmetric orbit .",
    "as a basis for the description of closed orbits in the crossed - fields hydrogen atom , we will choose the closed orbits in the diamagnetic kepler problem ( dkp ) , i.e. in the hydrogen atom in a pure magnetic field .",
    "for these orbits a complete classification is available @xcite .",
    "it will now be recapitulated briefly .    for low scaled energies @xmath96 ,",
    "there are two fundamental closed orbits : in one case , the electron leaves the nucleus parallel to the magnetic field until the coulomb attraction forces it back .",
    "this orbit is purely coulombic because the electron does not feel a lorentz force when moving parallel to the magnetic field .",
    "the second closed orbit lies in the plane perpendicular to the magnetic field .",
    "its shape is determined by the combined influences of the coulomb and magnetic fields .    due to time - reversal invariance",
    ", both elementary orbits possess arbitrary repetitions . as the scaled energy increases , each repetition of an elementary orbit undergoes a sequence of bifurcations labelled by an integer @xmath97 in order of increasing bifurcation energy .",
    "the orbits born in these bifurcations can be characterized by the repetition number @xmath98 of the bifurcating orbit and the bifurcation number @xmath99 .",
    "they are referred to @xcite as vibrators @xmath100 if they bifurcate out of the orbit parallel to the magnetic field and as rotators @xmath101 if they bifurcate out of the orbit perpendicular to @xmath102 .     as functions of the starting angles @xmath103 of closed orbits in the dkp for @xmath104 . ]",
    "further bifurcations create additional orbits from the @xmath100 and @xmath101 or `` exotic '' orbits not related to one of the two fundamental orbits .",
    "these orbits are of importance at scaled energies higher than those considered in this work , so that they will not be discussed further . for the scaled energy @xmath104 ,",
    "the scaled actions and starting angles of the closed orbits are presented in figure  [ dkpfig ] .",
    "it can be seen that only orbits fitting into the classification scheme described above are present .",
    "furthermore , orbits having a common bifurcation number @xmath99 lie on a smooth curve in the plot . for this reason",
    ", we will refer to orbits characterized by a fixed @xmath99 as a series of rotators or vibrators , respectively , and call @xmath99 the series number .",
    "in the presence of a pure magnetic field , the atomic system possesses a rotational symmetry around the field axis . as a consequence ,",
    "all closed orbits except for the orbit parallel to the magnetic field occur in continuous one - parameter families obtained by rotating a single orbit around the symmetry axis . when a perpendicular electric field is added ,",
    "the rotational symmetry is broken . out of each family , only two orbits survive  @xcite , or , in other words , each family of orbits splits into two independent orbits .       and azimuthal starting angles @xmath105 for planar orbits at @xmath104 and @xmath106 ( @xmath107 symbols ) and @xmath108 ( @xmath109 symbols ) . ]",
    "the splitting of a family of orbits upon the introduction of an electric field can most clearly be seen for planar orbits , i.e. for orbits lying in the plane perpendicular to the magnetic field . due to the -symmetry , this plane is invariant under the dynamics .",
    "thus , the initial direction of an orbit can be specified by means of the azimuthal angle @xmath105 only .",
    "figure  [ planar0fig ] shows the actions and initial directions of the planar orbits for a scaled energy of @xmath104 and scaled electric field strengths @xmath106 and @xmath108 . at @xmath110 ,",
    "the orbits bifurcate off a certain repetition of the planar closed orbit of the diamagnetic kepler problem . for low @xmath111",
    "they can therefore be assigned a repetition number .",
    "it can clearly be discerned in figure  [ planar0fig ] from the actions of the orbits .     and @xmath112 .",

    ". moreover , the starting angle varies linearly with the repetition number .",
    "these findings are illustrated in figure  [ planartrajfig ] , where for a few low repetition numbers one of the two orbits is shown .",
    "it can be seen that the orbits consist of more and more `` loops '' and that the starting angle increases regularly .",

    "these plots should be compared to figure  [ cuspfig ] , which displays the scenario described by the symmetric cusp catastrophe .",
    "the qualitative agreement between the catastrophe theory predictions and the numerical findings is evident",

    "the bifurcation theory of sections  [ sec : bifgen ] and  [ sec : cod1bif ] sheds new light on this question , suggesting that normal sequences can actually be expected to occur even more generally than surmised by wang and delos . in particular ,",
    "although the crossed - fields system is close to integrable at the field strengths considered here , integrability is not needed to make pitchfork bifurcations a generic phenomenon .",
    "instead , the presence of a reflection symmetry suffices to reduce its codimension from two to one .",
    "the sequence of a tangent and a pitchfork bifurcation , represented as a sequence of a fold and a symmetric cusp catastrophe , can be regarded as an unfolding of the symmetrized version of the butterfly catastrophe @xcite @xmath134 which is of codimension two , so that its unfolding can be expected to occur frequently in codimension one .",
    "a third bifurcation can be discerned in figure  [ bife45afig ] : at @xmath135 , a singlet orbit generated at @xmath133 and a singlet orbit generated in the tangent bifurcation discussed above collide and are destroyed .",
    "this is an instant of an inverse tangent bifurcation , which can be described by the fold catastrophe in the same way as the `` regular '' tangent bifurcation .",
    "it forms the third building block for the bifurcation scenario changing the pattern of planar orbits as the electric field strength is increased .    besides the three bifurcations described above , in figure  [ bife45afig ] three further zeros of the stability determinant @xmath115 occur for certain real orbits , indicating the presence of even more bifurcations .",
    "these bifurcations involve non - planar orbits , i.e. they are pitchfork bifurcations breaking the -symmetry all planar orbits possess .",
    "they will be discussed further in subsequent sections . at the moment it suffices to note that in this scenario six individual bifurcations take place in a comparatively small interval of the electric field strength .",
    "this is the first example of a phenomenon to be encountered repeatedly : in the crossed - fields hydrogen atom bifurcations of closed orbits abound , exacerbating both the classical and the semiclassical treatment of the dynamics .       and @xmath133 ( pure magnetic field , @xmath107 symbols ) , @xmath108 ( @xmath109 symbols ) and @xmath136 ( @xmath137 symbols ) . due to the -symmetry",
    ", the figure should be extended to be symmetric with respect to the line @xmath138 . ]    the transition from the rotationally - symmetric case of a pure magnetic field to crossed fields occurs for non - planar orbits in much the same way as for planar orbits .",
    "as soon as a small perpendicular electric field is present , a one - parameter family of dkp orbits is destroyed and splits into two isolated closed orbits .",
    "these orbits start in opposite directions with respect to the electric field , so that their azimuthal starting angles @xmath105 differ by @xmath139 , in complete analogy with what was shown in figure  [ planar0fig ] .",
    "an additional complication arises because the polar starting angle @xmath103 is no longer bound to the fixed value @xmath140 , so that the two orbits will in general have different @xmath103 .",

    "only angles @xmath142 need to be shown because orbits with @xmath143 can be obtained by a -reflection .",
    "it is obvious from the figure how a family of orbits splits in two isolated orbits and the two orbits move apart as the electric field strength is increased .",
    "this process takes place in the same way for both rotator and vibrator orbits .",
    "an exceptional role is played by the dkp orbit parallel to the magnetic field .",
    "this orbit is isolated even in a pure magnetic field . in the presence of a perpendicular electric field",
    "it is distorted and torn away from the magnetic field axis , but it remains isolated rather than splitting into two orbits .",
    "this process is also apparent from figure  [ rotsymmfig ] .",
    "notice again that closed orbits in crossed fields do not possess repetitions .",
    "any repetition of the parallel dkp orbit gives rise to a closed orbit in crossed fields ( for sufficiently small @xmath144 ) , but these orbits are not repetitions of each other .",
    "they have , in particular , different starting angles .",
    "the symmetries of the closed orbits are worth noting .",
    "all non - planar orbits described so far are doublets",
    ". more precisely , the vibrator orbits are -doublets , i.e. they are invariant under the  operation .",
    "their initial and final polar angles are small , as the orbits are mainly directed along the magnetic field axis .    for the rotator orbits",
    "the situation is more complex .",
    "their main component is the motion in the plane perpendicular to the magnetic field , whereas the @xmath4-component is comparatively small .",

    "their general pattern can be identified in figures  [ rotsymmfig ] and  [ discsymmfig](a ) .",
    "the most obvious consequence of the bifurcations is the appearance of quartet orbits in each series of both rotator and vibrator orbits .",
    "they are generated by pitchfork bifurcations from the adjacent doublet orbits . as figure  [ bifr38fig ] reveals if it is compared to figure  [ bife10fig ] , this bifurcation is very similar to a pitchfork bifurcation of planar orbits .",
    "a difference arises because , due to the absence of -symmetry , the angle @xmath103 is not restricted to a fixed value . as the -symmetry to be broken concerns the azimuth angles , it still is predominantly the angle @xmath105 that shows a square root behavior at the bifurcation and obtains an imaginary part when ghost orbits exist .",
    "nevertheless the polar angle @xmath103 also acquires a small imaginary part .",
    "the real part of @xmath103 apparently behaves linear close to the bifurcation , although for electric field strengths above the critical value a square root behavior must be present .",
    "it is too small to be seen in the figure .",
    "even though in quantitative terms the @xmath16-direction is only marginally involved in the bifurcation , its presence has the important consequence that the quartet orbits are no longer constrained to be periodic . as the distance from the bifurcation",
    "is increased , the periodicity condition @xmath118 is increasingly , albeit slowly , violated .",
    "the same features can be found for the bifurcations introducing the quartet orbits into the vibrator series .    .",

    "an example of this bifurcation is given in figure  [ bifr54fig ] .",
    "the tangent bifurcation involves both angles to roughly equal extent .",
    "the two doublet orbits thus generated are implanted into the regular pattern of their series , so that one of them subsequently undergoes a pitchfork bifurcation which creates a quartet .",

    "those orbits moving towards higher values of @xmath103 eventually hit the plane @xmath138 , where they collide with their -reflected partners and are destroyed .",
    "one might suspect the destruction of the two orbits to occur in a tangent bifurcation , but from the discussion of section  [ sec : cod1bif ] it is clear that a tangent bifurcation can only create or destroy orbits having different actions , so that it can never involve two orbits related by a symmetry transformation .",
    "thus , the bifurcation must be of pitchfork type , and it must involve a -symmetric planar orbit . depending on whether the non - planar orbits colliding with the plane are doublets or quartets , the planar orbit must be a singlet or a -doublet , respectively .",
    "if the destruction scenario is regarded in the direction of decreasing field strengths , it appears as the creation of orbits with broken -symmetry from an orbit possessing this symmetry .",
    "it is therefore the -breaking analogue of the - and -symmetry breaking bifurcations described above .",
    "as this type of bifurcation involves a planar orbit , it must give rise to a zero in the stability determinant @xmath115 of the planar orbit .",
    "in fact , the examples given in figures  [ biftefig ] and  [ bifqefig ] for both the destruction of a doublet and a quartet are two of the three bifurcations whose presence was inferred from figure  [ bife45afig ] the discussion of the planar orbits .",
    "the scenario just described is not restricted to rotator orbits .",
    "as can be seen in figure  [ rotsymmfig ] , the short vibrator orbits can , even at low electric field strengths , reach rather high values of @xmath103 . at @xmath151",
    "the first of them collides , at @xmath138 , with its -reflected counterpart and is annihilated .",
    "this is a pitchfork bifurcation in which one of the planar orbits with repetition number @xmath152 takes part .",
    "similarly , longer vibrators are destroyed in collisions with planar rotators of the appropriate repetition numbers .",
    "this example demonstrates that the distinction between vibrators and rotators , which was borrowed from the case of vanishing electric field , does not apply , strictly speaking , if an electric field is present .",
    "although it is generally useful for rather high electric field strengths , it can fail in some instances .",
    "this is clearly the case when a bifurcation involves both vibrator and rotator orbits .    .",
    "( @xmath153 . ) ]    a collision with the plane perpendicular to the magnetic field occurs only for vibrators of low repetition numbers , and only for vibrators that descend from the orbit parallel to the magnetic field . for longer orbits",
    ", the usual scenario is different . at low electric field strength",
    "there is , for sufficiently high repetition numbers , one orbit stemming from the orbit parallel to the magnetic field and one or several pairs of orbits created from non - parallel vibrators .",
    "it can be seen in figure  [ rotsymmfig ] , however , that for certain repetition numbers two of these orbits can be missing .",
    "this happens when the descendant of the parallel orbit and one of the other vibrators annihilate in a tangent bifurcation .",
    "a simple example of how this can come about is provided by the orbits with the repetition number @xmath154 .",
    "their bifurcations are illustrated in figure  [ bifv41fig ] .",
    "two of the orbits obviously bifurcate from a common family at @xmath133 , whereas the orbit proceeding from the parallel orbit is isolated there and starts at @xmath155 .",
    "it then merges with one of the other orbits in a tangent bifurcation to form a pair of ghost orbits .    .",

    "it is illustrated in figure  [ bifv42fig ] . in this case ,",
    "one of the orbits generated in the rotational symmetry breaking at @xmath133 , which is a -doublet , undergoes a pitchfork bifurcation and gives birth to a quartet of orbits before it annihilates with the descendant of the parallel orbit .",
    "the quartet then collides with the third , leftover -doublet and is destroyed in a second pitchfork bifurcation .",
    "corresponding to the three elementary bifurcations , there are three ghost orbits involved in the scenario . for one of them ,",

    "neither the action nor the stability determinant of the orbit , on the contrary , show any kind of special behavior . in particular , @xmath115 is non - zero , so that there can not be a bifurcation of the ghost orbit .     specifying the starting direction of the ghost orbit ( @xmath159 , @xmath160 , @xmath161 ) .",

    "the cartesian components of the unit vector @xmath163 in the starting direction are given in figure  [ cartesianfig ] .",
    "for all of them either the real or the imaginary parts are small , so that their numerical calculation is hard",
    ". nevertheless , to within the numerical accuracy all components are smooth at @xmath164 , although the angles @xmath103 and @xmath105 used to calculate them are not .",
    "thus , the singularity must be due to the transformation from cartesian to angular coordinates . in the real case it is obvious that the @xmath165 coordinate chart",
    "is singular at @xmath166 . to elucidate the details in the case of ghost orbits , assume a model situation where @xmath161 is exactly real and @xmath167 at @xmath168 . for ghost orbits , @xmath169",
    "is not bound to be smaller than 1 , so that generically , to first order in @xmath170 , @xmath171 .",
    "therefore , @xmath172 shows a square root behavior and changes from purely real to purely imaginary values . at the same time",
    ", @xmath173 has a zero , so that for @xmath159 and @xmath160 to assume finite values , @xmath174 and @xmath175 must diverge as @xmath176 .",
    "this is only possible if the imaginary part of @xmath105 is large .",
    "more precisely , if @xmath177 is assumed to be large , @xmath174 and @xmath175 are proportional to @xmath178 , whence @xmath179 achieves the desired divergence of @xmath174 and @xmath175 . now @xmath180 diverges at @xmath181 , whereas @xmath182 changes discontinuously from 0 to @xmath183 , depending on what branch of the logarithm is chosen .",
    "this behavior results in the observed divergence of @xmath162 and a discontinuous jump in @xmath184 of size @xmath140 .     of the ghost orbit close to the coordinate singularity .",
    "solid line : real part , dashed line : imaginary part .",
    "note the logarithmic scale . ]    in the actual scenario @xmath169 will not be exactly equal to  1 at @xmath164 because this is a situation of real codimension two .",
    "however , if @xmath185 is small , the singular behavior described above will be closely approximated .",
    "indeed , a closer look at @xmath103 ( see figure  [ thetaifig ] ) reveals that it is actually smooth , but close to @xmath168 it changes extremely rapidly from almost real to predominantly imaginary values .",
    "similarly , the real part of @xmath105 is smooth , although it changes over an even smaller range of @xmath111 . from the numerical data it can not be determined if @xmath162 is also smooth or actually diverges . from the above discussion",
    "it is clear that it must be smooth , because the coordinate singularity at @xmath155 is not actually encountered .",
    "it should be noted that the singularity described here can occur for ghost orbits only . in the real case , as the pole @xmath155 on the real unit sphere ( which still has codimension two ) is approached , both @xmath186 and @xmath187 must vanish instead of assuming finite values , so that no divergences of any kind are required .",
    "the fundamental classification scheme used in the above description of closed orbit bifurcations is the distinction between rotators and vibrators .",
    "this distinction was adopted from the case of vanishing electric field strength , so it can be expected to be applicable if the electric field is not too strong . in fact , from figure  [ discsymmfig](a ) it is obvious that for @xmath104 and @xmath136 orbits can uniquely be classified as rotators or vibrators and can be assigned both a series number and a repetition number . however , for long orbits neighboring series of rotators already start to overlap in the plot , and if the electric field strength is increased to @xmath148 , all orbits get completely mixed up , producing the somewhat messy picture shown in figure  [ discsymmfig](b ) . the relative strengths of the electric and magnetic fields can conveniently be compared if , instead of scaling the magnetic field strength to @xmath188 as described in section  [ sec : classham ] , the scaling properties of the hamiltonian are used to scale the energy to @xmath189 . for the present parameter values , the scaled field strengths are then @xmath190 and @xmath191 , so that the magnetic field is still stronger than the electric field , although the latter is no longer negligibly small .",
    "thus , the pattern of orbits should still be dominated by the magnetic field , but figure  [ discsymmfig](b ) suggests that there is no way to achieve a classification .     as a function of the scaled pseudotime @xmath192 for @xmath104 and @xmath125 . ]     as a function of the scaled pseudotime @xmath193 for @xmath104 and @xmath125 . ]    a more suitable starting point for a classification is provided by the complete trajectories .",
    "of course , since the classification must gradually break down for sufficiently strong electric fields , it can only be based on heuristic criteria .",
    "the criteria we are going to propose are largely based on the behavior of the @xmath4-coordinate of the motion as a function of time . to illustrate them",
    ", this function is plotted for rotators of roughly equal length from different series in figure  [ rotfig ] .",
    "figure  [ vibfig ] shows the analogous data for vibrators .",
    "first of all , vibrators are connected to an orbit along the @xmath4-axis in the pure magnetic field case . in this limit",
    ", the motion takes place either `` above '' the @xmath5-@xmath18-plane , i.e. in the half - space @xmath194 , or `` below '' the plane .",
    "rotators , on the contrary , stem from the elementary orbit in the plane .",
    "their motion takes place both above or below the plane .",
    "rotators can therefore be distinguished from vibrators if the maximum and minimum values of the coordinate @xmath4 are compared : for a rotator , they must have roughly equal absolute values , whereas for a vibrator `` above '' the plane , the minimum value is much smaller in magnitude than the maximum value .    for the vibrators of a given length shown in figure  [ vibfig ] ,",
    "this criterion gets better the higher the series of the vibrator is chosen . for the vibrator of the first series , which is closest to the domain of rotators , the excursion into the lower half space is of the same order of magnitude as that into the upper half space .",
    "as the electric field strength increases further , the vibrator orbit will eventually become indistinguishable , by the present criteria , from a rotator of the second series .",
    "it has already been noted in the discussion of orbital symmetries that a rotator of the first series that starts from the nucleus into the upper half space returns to it from the lower half space , whereas a rotator of the second series returns from the upper half space .",
    "this alternation between motion in the upper and lower half spaces is obvious from figure  [ rotfig ] .",
    "it can be used to determine the series of a rotator .",
    "if the value of @xmath195 in a maximum is compared to its value in the subsequent minimum , the transitions between motion in the upper and lower half spaces can easily be monitored .     and",
    "( a ) @xmath196 , ( b ) @xmath197 , and ( c ) @xmath148 .",
    "-doublets are indicated by @xmath109  symbols , quartets by @xmath198  symbols . ]",
    "assigning a series number to a vibrator is considerably more difficult .",
    "it relies on the beat structure present in @xmath195 for a vibrator .",
    "subsequent maxima of this function have varying heights .",
    "we consider the maxima that have minimal height compared to neighboring maxima , i.e. the minima of the beats apparent in figure  [ vibfig ] .",
    "the height of these beat minima slowly oscillates , and the number of their oscillations turns out to give the series number of the vibrator .",
    "it can be found by counting the number of minima in the oscillation .",
    "notice that the method uses extrema of the third order : the minima in the minima in the height of maxima .",
    "it therefore requires vibrators of sufficiently high repetition numbers , so that many maxima of @xmath195 exist .",
    "the method will fail when applied to vibrators of very small repetition numbers . however , these vibrators exist for fairly high scaled energies only , where even in the absence of an electric field the dynamics is mixed or chaotic . in these regions ,",
    "the classification suggested here might not be meaningful at all .",
    "finally , orbits can be assigned a repetition number . for vibrators ,",
    "this can be done by simply counting the number of maxima in @xmath195 . for rotators ,",
    "maxima in @xmath199 must be counted , where @xmath200 is the distance from the magnetic field axis . in this case",
    ", an additional difficulty arises because @xmath201 can not assume negative values , so that between two maxima corresponding to repetitions of the elementary orbits , additional maxima arise from the `` swing - by '' around the nucleus .",
    "these maxima tend to be extremely small and narrow close to the beginning and the end of an orbit , so that they are hard to detect , but they can reach considerable heights in the middle of an orbit . the present form of the classification algorithm , which is certainly open to improvements , counts a maximum in @xmath199 if its height exceeds a certain fraction of the height of the previous maximum .",
    "in this form , the assignment of rotator repetition numbers turns out to be the least robust part of the classification procedure .",
    "the criteria described above readily lend themselves to a numerical implementation , so that the classification of orbits can be achieved automatically . as an example , the rotators of the first series are shown in figure  [ seriesfig ] for three different electric field strengths .",
    "although the neat `` wiggly - line '' structure characterizing the series in figure  [ rotsymmfig ] quickly breaks down for larger electric field strengths , the distinction between different series persists .",
    "figure  [ seriesfig](c ) should be compared to figure  [ discsymmfig](b ) .",
    "it might appear surprising that the messy - looking set of orbits still permits a classification , but with the help of the criteria just described an ordered pattern of closed orbits can still be discerned . in this sense ,",
    "the classification scheme derived from the dkp turns out to be remarkably robust .",
    "in this work , a systematic study of the closed classical orbits of the hydrogen atom in crossed electric and magnetic fields has been carried out . as an important step towards a complete understanding of the complicated pattern of closed orbits , a bifurcation theory of closed orbits",
    "was developed and the generic bifurcations of codimension one were identified .    a variety of bifurcation scenarios observed in the crossed - fields system was described .",
    "they demonstrate that , even though only two types of elementary bifurcations exist , they combine into a wealth of complicated bifurcation scenarios .",
    "the abundance of bifurcations exacerbates both a complete classical description of the crossed - fields hydrogen atom and its semiclassical treatment @xcite .",
    "based on the classification of closed orbits in the hydrogen atom in a magnetic field , heuristic criteria have been proposed which allow a systematization of closed orbits for moderately high electric field strengths .",
    "although the present analysis can not yet claim to have achieved a complete classification of closed orbits in the crossed - fields hydrogen atom , it does give a detailed impression of how orbits bifurcate as the electric field strength increases .",
