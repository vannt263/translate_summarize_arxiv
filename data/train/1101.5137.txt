    "the _ spitzer space telescope _ @xcite , with its superb sensitivity and resolution at infrared ( ir ) wavelengths , provides an excellent opportunity to study planetary debris disks around stars @xcite .",
    "for instance , a comprehensive _ spitzer _ 24  survey of main - sequence a - type stars has shown that up to @xmath150% of young ( @xmath230 myr ) stars have little or no 24  excess emission from debris disks , large debris - disk excesses decrease significantly at ages of @xmath1150 myr , and much of the dust detected may be generated episodically by collisions of large planetesimals @xcite .",
    "the dust in these debris disks would have dissipated long before the stars evolve off the main sequence .",
    "dust can be replenished during late evolutionary stages . as a low- or intermediate - mass star loses a significant fraction of its initial mass to become a white dwarf ( wd ) , its planetary system expands .",
    "sub - planetary objects , such as asteroids and comets , can be injected to very small radii and be tidally pulverized by the wd , while orbital resonances with giant planets can raise the collision rates among sub - planetary objects and generate dust @xcite .",
    "this freshly produced dust can be detected through ir excesses and allows us to peer into the late evolution of planetary systems .",
    "the first two wds reported to possess dust disks were g29 - 38 and gd362 , both exhibiting near - ir excesses that were confirmed spectroscopically to be dust continuum emission @xcite .",
    "a subsequent _ spitzer _ survey of 124 wds at 4.5 and 8.0 @xmath3 m found one additional dust disk , around wd2115@xmath4560 @xcite .",
    "as g29 - 38 , gd362 , and wd2115@xmath4560 are wds with photospheric absorption lines of heavy elements , searches for dust disks have been conducted for daz and dbz wds , and indeed many more dust disks were discovered .",
    "for example , a near - ir spectroscopic survey of 20 daz wds found a dust disk around gd56 @xcite , the presence of a dust disk around the daz wd1150@xmath4153 was diagnosed by @xmath5-band excess and confirmed spectroscopically @xcite , and _ spitzer _",
    "photometric observations of 9 daz / dbz wds revealed dust disks around gd40 , gd133 , and pg1015 + 161 @xcite",
    ". one common characteristic of these dust disks around daz / dbz wds is that they are all small , with outer radii @xmath60.01 au . as the dust disks are completely within the roche limits of the wds and the dust mass",
    "is estimated to be only @xmath110@xmath7 g , it is suggested that tidally disrupted asteroids produce the dust disks and that the accretion of this dust enriches refractory metals , such as ca , mg , fe , and ti , in the wd atmospheres @xcite . to date , @xmath120 dust disks around daz / dbz wds have been reported , all consistent with this suggested origin of tidal disruption of asteroids @xcite .",
    "more dust disks of this type are being found from the _ wide - field infrared survey explorer _ observations of wds ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "an entirely different kind of dust disk has been discovered around the central wd of the helix planetary nebula ( pn ) , wd2226@xmath4210 @xcite .",
    "_ spitzer _ observations of the helix nebula show a bright compact source coincident with the central wd in the 24 and 70  bands , and follow - up infrared spectrograph ( irs ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) observations have verified that the mid - ir emission originates from a dust continuum .",
    "the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) of this ir - emitter indicates a blackbody temperature of 90 - 130 k , and its luminosity , 5 - 11@xmath810@xmath9 ergs s@xmath10 , requires an emitting area of 3.8 - 38 au@xmath11 .",
    "these properties can only be explained by the presence of a dust cloud ; furthermore , little extinction exists toward the wd , so the dust cloud must be flattened with a disk geometry . adopting a stellar effective temperature of 110,000 k for wd2226@xmath4210 @xcite and assuming astronomical silicates with a power - law size distribution and a maximum grain radius of 1000  for the dust grains , models of the sed",
    "indicate that the dust disk extends between 35 and 150 au from the wd and has a mass of @xmath10.13 @xmath12 .",
    "since this dust must have been generated recently and since the radial location of the dust disk corresponds to that of the kuiper belt in the solar system , @xcite suggest that the dust disk around wd2226@xmath4210 was produced by collisions of kuiper belt - like objects ( kbos ) or the break - up of comets .    to simulate the dust disk of wd2226@xmath4210 ,",
    "the dynamic evolution of a debris disk around a 3 @xmath13 star has been modeled from the main sequence ( corresponding to @xmath1a0v ) to the wd stage , and it is found that collisions among kbos may produce the amount of dust observed @xcite .",
    "if the dusk disk around the helix central star is indeed produced by collisions of kbos , similar dust disks should be found around other wds and a survey would allow us to assess their frequency of occurrence and physical properties .",
    "these results can then be compared with models of debris disks evolution @xcite for implications on their planetary systems .    to search for dust disks similar to that around the central wd of the helix nebula",
    ", we have conducted three surveys using _ spitzer _ observations : ( 1 ) 24  survey of hot wds and pre - wds ( this paper ) , ( 2 ) archival survey of ir excesses of wds @xcite , and ( 3 ) archival survey of ir excesses of central stars of pne ( cspns ; * ? ? ?",
    "the combined results from these three surveys will provide a comprehensive picture of post - main sequence dust production and dynamic evolution of debris disks .",
    "this paper reports the results of the _ spitzer _ 24  survey of hot wds as well as follow - up spectroscopic and imaging observations for a subset of hot wds with 24  excesses .",
    "section 2 describes the target selection and observations , section 3 reports the results , and section 4 discusses the implications .",
    "a summary is given in section 5 .",
    "the large dust disk around the central wd of the helix nebula is detectable at 24  because wd2226@xmath4210 has a high temperature and thus high luminosity .",
    "stellar luminosity is a steeper function of temperature than of radius , and wds span a small range of radii ; furthermore , stellar effective temperatures are more readily available in the literature than distances and luminosities .",
    "therefore , we use stellar effective temperature as our main target selection criterion and selected targets from two sources for our 24  survey .",
    "first , we use the web version of the @xcite wd catalog to search for wds whose spectral classifications indicate temperatures near or higher than 100,000 k ; 58 such hot wds are found .",
    "hot wds are the youngest wds and often surrounded by evolved pne ; 22 of the 58 wds selected are in known pne . to probe",
    "whether dust disks are present around pre - wds , we have selected 14 hot cspns @xcite whose effective temperatures are @xmath14100,000 k but whose surface gravity is not yet high enough to be classified as wds . although pre - wds evolve along tracks of almost constant luminosities in the hr diagram , we do not select cspns with lower effective temperatures as they are usually surrounded by smaller and brighter pne , making it difficult to obtain accurate photometric measurements of the cspns . these 58 wds and 14 pre - wds form the target list of our _ spitzer _ 24  survey for dust disks .    among the 72 targets ,",
    "`` wd 0123@xmath4842 '' was a misnomer from wrong coordinates , and has been removed from the web version of the mccook & sion wd catalog ( e.  sion , personal communication ) ; thus , this spurious object will not be discussed further in this paper .",
    "the 71 valid targets are listed in table 1 .",
    "the coordinates in columns 2 - 3 are measured from the digitized sky survey 2 ( dss2 ) , and in many cases represent an improved accuracy when compared with those given by mccook & sion or simbad . unless noted , the effective temperatures ( @xmath15 ) in column 4 are taken from @xcite or converted from the spectral classification in column 5 taken from mccook & sion s wd catalog . the common name and png number of associated pne",
    "are given in columns 6 - 7 .",
    "the _ spitzer _ observations reported in this paper were obtained from three programs .",
    "the main program is our 24  survey of the hot wds or pre - wds ( program 40953 ) using the multiband imaging photometer for _ spitzer _ ( mips ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . to assess the nature of hot wds 24  excesses , we have further obtained",
    "_ spitzer _",
    "irs , infrared array camera ( irac ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and mips 70  observations ( program 50629 ) . as the mips",
    "24  survey was not completed before the proposal deadline for _ spitzer _ cycle 5 , the last cryogenic cycle of the _ spitzer _ mission , irs and mips 70  observations were obtained for only a subset of hot wds with 24  excesses : cspn k1 - 22 , wd0103 + 732 ( cspn egb1 ) , wd0127 + 581 ( cspn sh2 - 188 ) , and wd0439 + 466 ( cspn sh2 - 216 ) . among these four targets ,",
    "archival irac observations are available for wd0439 + 466 ; we have thus obtained new irac observations for only the other three .",
    "finally , we have obtained a mips 70  observation of kpd0005 + 5106 (= wd0005 + 511 ) through a _ chandra x - ray observatory _ observing program ( go8 - 9026 ) .",
    "this mips observation was merged with our _ spitzer _ program 40953 for convenience .        in the mips",
    "24  survey of hot wds , each of the 71 objects in table 1 was imaged using the small - field photometry mode which obtained a sequence of 14 dithered exposures in a preset pattern ( see the _",
    "spitzer space telescope _",
    "observer s manual for more details ) .",
    "the observations used an exposure time of 10  s and cycled through the pattern 3 times , yielding a total exposure time of 420  s in the central 32@xmath832 region . in a typical median background condition ,",
    "the depth of the survey will reach a 1-@xmath16 point - source sensitivity of 33.6  @xmath3jy .",
    "the raw data were processed using the data analysis tool ( dat ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) for basic reduction ( e.g. , dark subtraction and flat fielding ) .",
    "all individual exposures were first corrected with a scan - mirror - dependent flat to correct for the dark spots due to particulate matter on the pick - off mirror . for targets that have no large - scale extended emission ( from either the surrounding pne or the background galactic cirrus ) , a second flat field generated from the data itself was applied to correct the possible dark latency and scattered light gradient in order to enhance photometric sensitivity .",
    "details of these processing procedures can be found in @xcite .",
    "the final mosaics were then constructed with a pixel size of 1245 ( half the size of the physical pixel ) for photometry measurements . the calibration factor",
    "4.54@xmath810@xmath17 mjy sr@xmath10 ( dn s@xmath10)@xmath10 was used to convert the instrumental unit to physical units @xcite .",
    "all final mosaics were astrometrically calibrated by comparisons with the two micron all sky survey ( 2mass ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) sources in the field to establish the world coordinate system ( wcs ) , the accuracy of which is generally better than @xmath11 .",
    "we first performed source extraction using _ starfinder _ @xcite with a smoothed theoretical point spread function ( psf ) generated by the stinytim program ( krist 2006 ) .",
    "we consider the wd detected if the extracted source position is within 15 from the given wd position .",
    "in other words , this method ensures a point - source - like object is required to be coincident with the given wd position . for sources that are not detected",
    ", we estimate their `` observed '' point source flux by fixing the psf at the given wd position on the psf - subtracted ( source - free ) image and using the minimum @xmath18 technique . in some cases where the nebular emission is bright ,",
    "this psf flux is totally dominated by the background ( e.g. , cspn ic 289 , cspn mewe 1 - 3 , and wd1958 + 015 in ngc6852 ) .",
    "these psf fluxes ( non - color corrected ) are listed in column 3 of table 2 .",
    "we have estimated the 1-@xmath16 point source sensitivity of the observation using the pixel - to - pixel variation inside a radius of 44  centered at the source position on the source - free image ( i.e. , the systematic background noise ) .",
    "the final photometry error includes ( 1 ) the systematic error of the observation , estimated from pixel - to - pixel variations ; ( 2 ) 24 @xmath3 m detector repeatability , @xmath11% of the measured flux ; and ( 3 ) 24 @xmath3 m confusion noise , @xmath115 @xmath3jy , a median value estimated from the extragalactic source counts @xcite .",
    "these error contributions are summed in quadrature and listed in column 4 of table 2 as `` uncertainty '' .",
    "this `` uncertainty '' has no direct relationship to the detectability of the source .",
    "it simply reflects the photometric accuracy if a point source was coincident with the given wd position .",
    "for non - detections , we also list 3-@xmath16 upper limits in column 5 of table 2 , computed as the three times of the uncertainty plus the psf flux . in most cases , these 3-@xmath16 upper limits are totally dominant by the surrounding bright nebular emission as remarked in column 8 in table 2 .    for detected sources ,",
    "we have also carried out aperture photometry using a source aperture of 6225 radius , a sky annulus of radii 1992  2988 , and an aperture correction of 1.7 .",
    "these results are compared with those determined from the psf - fitting method .",
    "when the two measurements for a source are discrepant , we examine the field for nearby objects or background structures that might compromise the photometry , and adopt the measurement that is less compromised .",
    "the aperture photometry result is adopted for wd0439 + 466 , and the psf - fitting results are adopted for the other eight cases of detections .",
    "when irs observations are available , we use the background - subtracted flux densities near 24  to further constrain the mips 24 photometric measurements .",
    "four targets were included in the mips 70  observations as part of our program 50629 .",
    "the three original targets , cspn k1 - 22 , wd0103@xmath19732 , and wd0439@xmath19466 , were observed in the photometry raster map mode with 3@xmath81 maps in the array column and row direction and a step size of 1/8 array .",
    "this yields a uniformly covered area within a diameter of 32 centered at the target .",
    "each map was repeated 4 times ( cycles ) with 10 s integration per frame , resulting in a total effective integration of 960 s. wd0005 + 511 was a target from the _ chandra _ program go8 - 9026 .",
    "its 70  observations were made in the default photometry mode , with 10 s integration per frame and three cycles , and the total integration time was 240 s.    the basic reduction ( dark subtraction , illumination correction ) of the 70  data was processed using dat , similar to that of the 24  data .",
    "the known transient behavior in the 70  array was removed by masking out the sources in the field of view and time filtering the data @xcite . for the objects in pne with extended nebulosity seen at 70 , the size of the masked area was adjusted to cover most of the nebulosity accordingly .",
    "the final mosaics were combined using the wcs with a subpixel size of 493 .",
    "figure 1 shows the 70  images alongside the 24  images of k1 - 22 , wd0103 + 732 , and wd0439 + 466 .",
    "the 70  image of wd0103 + 732 shows bright extended emission with a central peak at the expected wd position .",
    "the diffuse emission at 70 , appearing more extended than that in the 24  band , is most likely dominated by bright emission lines such as the [ ] 88  line . to minimize the nebular contamination , we performed aperture photometry with a very small ( 16 ) aperture and sky annulus of 1839 .",
    "we have also used psf fitting to estimate the source brightness .",
    "both methods give a point source flux of @xmath155 mjy .",
    "the pixel - to - pixel variations in the data suggest 1-@xmath16 point source sensitivity of 8.4 mjy .",
    "wd0439 + 466 is coincident with a very faint 70  source .",
    "the source is superposed on diffuse emission , similar to the case of wd0103 + 732 .",
    "using the same approach as for wd0103 + 732 , we estimate the source to have a 70  flux density of 9.0@xmath208.4 mjy .    unlike the above two wds , cspn k1 - 22",
    "has no obvious source coincident with the wd .",
    "the data were very noisy , probably due to many foreground and background sources ( evident at 24  as well ) .",
    "the estimated 1-@xmath16 point source sensitivity is @xmath14 mjy .",
    "wd0005 + 511 is not detected at 70 , either ; its 1-@xmath16 sensitivity is 5.4 mjy .",
    "irac observations of three targets , cspn k1 - 22 , wd0103@xmath19732 , and wd0127@xmath19581 were obtained at 3.6 , 4.5 , 5.8 and 8.0   in our program 50629 . these observations all used a 30  s frame time and a cyclic dither pattern with medium offsets to obtain 5 frames for a total integration time of 150",
    "s for each target .",
    "the basic calibrated data ( bcd ) frames from these observations were reduced using standard routines within the mopex package .",
    "we have measured flux densities in each of the irac bands using the iraf task to perform aperture photometry .",
    "these measurements used a 36 radius source aperture with a background estimated from the surrounding annulus of radii 36 to 84 .",
    "an aperture correction based on the results tabulated in the irac data handbook ( ver 3.0 ) was then applied to obtain the flux densities reported in table  3 .",
    "archival irac observations are available for wd0439 + 466 ( program 30432 ; pi : burleigh ) , wd0726 + 133 ( program 30285 ; pi : fazio ) , and the cspn ngc2438 ( program 68 ; pi : fazio ) .",
    "these archival data were downloaded and reduced in the same manner as our own observations .",
    "their flux densities are also reported in table  3 .",
    "we have also obtained follow - up irs observations for cspn k1 - 22 , wd0103 + 732 , wd0127 + 581 , and wd0439 + 466 in our program 50629 .",
    "all sources were observed using the low - resolution modules sl1 ( 7.414.5 ) , sl2 ( 5.27.7 ) , ll1 ( 19.538.0 ) , and ll2 ( 14.021.3 ) .",
    "see @xcite for a more detailed description of the irs and its capabilities .",
    "cspn k1 - 22 and wd0103 + 732 were observed in the irs staring mode after a peakup on a nearby source .",
    "wd0127 + 581 , the faintest target , was observed in mapping mode where the target was sequentially stepped along the slit to facilitate an improved background subtraction .",
    "the sl1 and sl2 observations of wd0127 + 581 used 8 pointings spaced by 3  while the ll1 and ll2 observations used 12 pointings spaced by 6 .",
    "the mips 24  observations of wd0439 + 466 showed diffuse emission around the wd , thus the irs observations of wd0439 + 466 were made in the mapping mode to obtain spectra of the wd and the diffuse emission by taking spectra from a series of dense slit positions centered on the wd and sequentially offset in the direction perpendicular to the slit . specifically , the sl1 and sl2 maps were comprised of 9 pointings spaced by 36 while the ll1 and ll2 maps are comprised of 5 pointings spaced by 106 .",
    "we summarize the modules , exposure times , and setups used in table  [ tab_irssetup ] .",
    "all spectra were reduced using the cubism software @xcite with the latest pipeline processing of the data and the most recent calibration set ( irs_2009_05_20-pb - pfc - trim - omeg - lhllbiasfork.cal ) .",
    "each low - resolution module contains two subslits that are exposed at the same time , e.g. , sl1 on - source and sl2 off - source , and vice versa .",
    "we examine the off - source frames , select the ones free of any source contamination , trim the maxima and minima , and use the average to produce a background frame .",
    "this 2d background frame is then subtracted from all on - source frames in the corresponding module to remove astrophysical background and to alleviate the bad pixels that contaminate the irs data .",
    "after the 2d background subtraction , we flag the global and record - level bad pixels first using the default cubism parameters for automatic bad pixel detection , and then through manual inspection of each bcd record , as well as by backtracking the pixels contributing to a given cube pixel .",
    "the spectra are extracted with aperture sizes large enough to enclose the 24  source .",
    "see table 5 for the aperture sizes used for the spectral extractions . for the ll orders ,",
    "two local background spectra on either side of the source are extracted and averaged for a 1d subtraction of the local background . for the sl orders ,",
    "a single background spectrum is used for the local 1d background subtraction .",
    "special notes for spectral reduction of individual objects are given below : + .",
    "the frames used for the construction of ll1 background contain a very faint point source . as the wd is bright and the point source",
    "is practically removed in the min / max trimming and averaging process , we choose to ignore this faint source so that we can perform the 2d background subtraction to maximize the quality of the final data cube .",
    "in addition , the frames used for the construction of the ll2 background show a small knot of h@xmath21 line emission at 17 .",
    "this h@xmath21 emission knot is near the center of one slit position , and at the edge of the other slit position .",
    "we therefore use only the latter slit position for background subtraction .",
    "the pixels of the on - source bcd frames affected by over - subtraction of the emission knot are flagged as record - level bad pixels , and not used for cube construction .",
    "furthermore , this h@xmath21 knot is far enough from the wd position that both a target spectrum and a local background spectrum can be extracted outside the position of the h@xmath21 emission knot in the slit . the spectrum of wd0103 + 732 is not detected in the sl2 observations .",
    "this wd is faint , with @xmath22 = 0.34 mjy .",
    "the orientation of the irs slit , determined by the roll angle of the spacecraft , was such that a very bright neighboring star was included in the slit .",
    "consequently , the weak emission of wd0127 + 581 was overwhelmed by the elevated background from the neighboring star .",
    "the spectrum of the wd is not unambiguously detected in the background - subtracted frame ; the signal - to - noise ratio is too low for meaningful spectral extraction .",
    "+ . in its sl2 order ,",
    "the bcd frames from the three final mapping positions show an abrupt jump in brightness across the center of each frame . since these slit positions do not contain the target wd , we do not use them for the sl2 cube construction or the sl1 background construction .",
    "in our mips 24  survey of hot wds , nine of the 71 objects show 24  point sources detected at the given wd positions . to assess the physical significance of these 24  detections and the 3-@xmath16 upper limits ( see table 2 ) ,",
    "we have computed the expected photospheric emission at 24  by extrapolating from the optical and near - ir measurements of each wd . we first searched the web version of the mccook and sion wd catalog and the simbad database for available photometric measurements in the @xmath23 bands and the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) @xmath24 bands . for wds that were discovered from the sdss @xcite ,",
    "usually only @xmath24 photometric measurements were available .",
    "we also searched the 2mass point source catalog @xcite for near - ir counterparts to the wds .",
    "the effective temperatures of our program wds are so high that it is reasonable to approximate their photospheric emission with a blackbody in the rayleigh - jeans limit , i.e. , the flux density @xmath25 @xmath26 @xmath27 .",
    "the amounts of extinction to most of these wds are unknown , but will have smaller impact at longer wavelengths .",
    "we thus use the photometric measurement with the longest wavelength and without extinction correction to extrapolate the expected flux density at 23.7 , the central wavelength of the mips 24  band . the fiducial photometric measurement and the expected photospheric emission at 24  are given in columns 6 and 7 of table 2 , respectively .",
    "the expected photospheric emission from these hot wds are all less than the nominal sensitivity of the 24  observations , 0.034 mjy .",
    "it is not surprising that all nine detections are at least two orders of magnitude higher than the expected photospheric emission , and thus represent ir excesses . in the cases of non - detections , the 3-@xmath16 upper limits are several to several tens times higher than the expected photospheric emission .",
    "these non - detections do not exclude the existence of low - level ir excesses , but no useful deductions can be made from these results ; thus , the non - detections will not be discussed further in this paper .",
    "we have combined all available photometric measurements of the nine wds and pre - wds with 24  excesses to produce the seds plotted in figure 2 .",

    "( 2011b , in preparation ) .",
    "multi - wavelength optical and ir images of cspn k1 - 22 are displayed in figure 3 .",
    "the dss2 red image shows a source at 2  north of the cspn , but no counterpart of this source is seen in any of the other optical or ir images .",
    "it is not clear whether this red source is spurious or transient .",
    "the _ hst _",
    "images show two sources separated by 035 at the center of k1 - 22 ; the blue northeast component is the cspn and the red southwest component is a cool companion @xcite .",
    "the ir images show a source coincident with this close pair of stars , but can not resolve them .    in the sed plot in figure 2 ,",
    "the flux densities of cspn k1 - 22 and its close companion are individually plotted in the _ hst _ f555w and f814w bands , while the flux densities in the 2mass @xmath28 and _ spitzer _ irac and mips bands are for the two stars combined .",
    "an extinction of @xmath29 @xcite has been corrected from the observed flux densities .",
    "the atmospheric emission of the wd has been modeled as a blackbody ; for the companion , we adopt the kurucz atmospheric model for a k2v star , the spectral type implied by the _ hst _ photometry .",
    "these stellar emission models are plotted in thick solid curves in figure 2 .",
    "the irac and mips flux densities are all higher than the expected atmospheric emission from these two stars .",
    "the ir excesses in the near - ir and in the mid - ir can not be described by a single blackbody ; however , two blackbody emitters at temperatures of 700 and 150 k appear to match the ir excesses in the irac and mips 24   bands .",
    "the combined sed of the wd , its companion , and the two blackbody emitters is plotted as a thin solid line in figure 2 .    the irs spectra extracted from cspn k1 - 22 and adjacent background regions all show [ ] 15.55 @xmath3 m , [ ] 18.71 , [ ] 25.89 , and [ ] 33.48  line emission ( see figure 4 ) . the background - subtracted irs spectrum of cspn k1 - 22 shows a weak continuum component and residual line emission , especially prominent in the [ ] line .    to determine the nature of the residual line emission , we compare the spatial distributions of the continuum and line emission .",
