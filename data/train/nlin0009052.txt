    "the three decades that passed since the completion of gutzwiller s pioneering work on the trace formula @xcite ( see also @xcite ) have witnessed a flourishing development of semiclassical methods in connection with trace formulae .",
    "gutzwiller himself , e.g. , applied his semiclassical representation of the spectral density in terms of a sum over classical periodic orbits to the quantisation of the anisotropic kepler problem @xcite .",
    "later , in the context of the then developing field of quantum chaos , it was realised that the gutzwiller trace formula can quite generally be employed for a semiclassical quantisation of classically chaotic systems , where no bohr - sommerfeld ( or einstein - brillouin - keller ) type quantisation is available .",
    "a number of semiclassical quantisation schemes were invented and successfully passed various tests , see @xcite for collections of examples . on the other hand , hannay and ozorio de almeida @xcite and berry @xcite realised that a semiclassical analysis of spectral correlations can be based on trace formulae .",
    "these techniques , which have meanwhile been refined in several aspects , still provide the strongest analytic support for the conjectured universality in energy level statistics @xcite .",
    "shortly after gutzwiller established his trace formula , and apparently independently thereof , mathematicians began to prove various versions of semiclassical trace formulae @xcite .",
    "moreover , generalisations of the trace formula as a semiclassical representation of the spectral density were developed , e.g. , to include also expectation values of observables @xcite .",
    "thus , by now the gutzwiller trace formula is a well developed and well established tool in semiclassical quantum mechanics .",
    "so far , trace formulae have been derived for quantum systems with only translational degrees of freedom .",
    "these possess a well defined classical limit and thus semiclassical methods can be applied in a straight forward manner . from a physical point of view , however , spin degrees of freedom are of particular importance .",
    "quantum mechanically a spin 1/2 of , say , an electron is described in a two- ( i.e.  finite- ) dimensional hilbert space , lacking a direct classical counterpart , so that a semiclassical description of quantum systems with coupled translational and spin degrees of freedom is less obvious than in the previous cases .",
    "however , the semiclassical formalism that was primarily developed in the mathematical community ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) can also be applied to derive a trace formula for dirac- and pauli - hamiltonians @xcite . for these , alike in gutzwiller s original trace formula , the spectral density can be expressed in terms of a sum over classical periodic orbits ( of the translational motion ) .",
    "spin enters through weight factors that depend on a phase derived from a ` classical ' spin precessing along the classical periodic orbits .",
    "it is the goal of this paper to develop a semiclassical theory for expectation values of observables in the case of relativistic particles with spin 1/2 . to this end",
    "we first extend the trace formula @xcite for dirac - hamiltonians to also include expectation values and then discuss averages of expectation values in eigenstates of the hamiltonian that correspond to a certain spectral interval . in this way",
    "average expectation values and fluctuations thereabout are expressed in terms of classical quantities .",
    "the article is organised as follows : in section  2 we recall spectral properties of dirac - hamiltonians and represent them as weyl operators .",
    "bounded observables are then introduced in section  3 .",
    "subsequently , in section  4 the semiclassical description of the time evolution operator in terms of a van vleck - gutzwiller propagator for dirac - hamiltonians that was developed in @xcite is discussed .",
    "section  5 is then devoted to the derivation of the trace formula for the spectral density weighted by expectation values .",
    "finally , in section  6 we calculate averages of expectation values semiclassically .",
    "in relativistic quantum mechanics a point particle of mass @xmath0 and charge @xmath1 that is exposed to external electromagnetic fields @xmath2 and @xmath3 is described by the dirac equation . here",
    "we fix an inertial frame and work with fixed coordinates @xmath4 for minkowski space - time .",
    "we moreover assume that in the given frame the fields are static so that the dirac equation reads @xmath5 with the dirac - hamiltonian @xmath6 where @xmath7 are electromagnetic potentials so that @xmath8 and @xmath9 .",
    "the dirac algebra @xmath10 , @xmath11 , is realised by the hermitian @xmath12 matrices @xmath13 where @xmath14 , @xmath15 , are the pauli matrices and @xmath16 denotes the @xmath17 unit matrix . for more details",
    "see @xcite .",
    "if the potentials @xmath18 are smooth functions , or at most have coulomb singularities at some points @xmath19 such that @xmath20 , @xmath21 and for all @xmath22 , the dirac - hamiltonian ( [ diracham ] ) is essentially self - adjoint on the domain @xmath23 in the hilbert space @xmath24 of square - integrable dirac spinors ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the quantum hamiltonian is then given by the ( unique ) self - adjoint extension which we also denote by @xmath25 .",
    "as an example consider an electron in the coulomb potential of a nucleus with charge @xmath26 , such that @xmath27 .",
    "since the fine structure constant @xmath28 is approximately given by @xmath29 , the bound ( [ esssacond ] ) implies essential self - adjointness for @xmath30 . in the case @xmath31 and @xmath32 spherically symmetric , however , the bound on @xmath33 can be improved by a factor of @xmath34 , leading to @xmath35 . for larger",
    "@xmath36 one has to choose special self - adjoint extensions , see @xcite for further details .",
    "dirac - hamiltonians ( [ diracham ] ) possess spectra that are not bounded from below .",
    "in fact , if the electromagnetic fields vanish as @xmath37 , the essential spectrum of @xmath25 is given by @xmath38 \\cup [ + mc^2,+\\infty ) \\ .\\ ] ] ( this is also true under appropriate weaker conditions , see @xcite . ) in what follows we will always consider situations where @xmath25 is ( essentially ) self - adjoint and where ( [ essspec ] ) holds . since below we are only interested in properties of the discrete spectrum of dirac - hamiltonians , we will therefore concentrate on the eigenvalues @xmath39 of @xmath25 with @xmath40 .",
    "more precisely , we choose some energy @xmath41 in the gap of @xmath42 and introduce an interval @xmath43\\ , \\qquad { \\omega}>0 \\quad\\text{fixed}\\ , \\ ] ] that has no overlap with the essential spectrum of @xmath25 .",
    "this only requires @xmath44 to be sufficiently small .",
    "we are then interested in the eigenvalues @xmath45 and the expectation values @xmath46 of observables @xmath47 in eigenstates",
    "@xmath48 related to these eigenvalues .    for the purpose of semiclassical asymptotics",
    "it is advantageous to view the hamiltonian , as well as all further observables , as weyl operators . for simplicity",
    "we now assume that the potentials are smooth so that the weyl representation @xmath49 of @xmath25 holds for @xmath50 . here",
    "@xmath51 is the weyl symbol of @xmath25 , which for all @xmath52 is a hermitian @xmath12 matrix with the two twofold degenerate eigenvalues @xmath53 such that @xmath54 .",
    "these eigenvalues are the classical hamiltonians for relativistic particles ( without spin ) with positive and negative kinetic energies , respectively , that are exposed to the electromagnetic fields generated by the potentials @xmath32 and @xmath55 .",
    "the presence of these two eigenvalues is a remnant of the fact that the dirac equation ( [ diraceq ] ) describes both particles and anti - particles , and the dimension of the corresponding eigenspaces follows from the spin 1/2 of the particles and anti - particles , respectively .",
    "one can now introduce an orthonormal basis of @xmath56 consisting of the eigenvectors @xmath57 of @xmath58 with eigenvalue @xmath59 and the eigenvectors @xmath60 with eigenvalue @xmath61 .",
    "this basis allows to construct the @xmath62 matrices @xmath63 and @xmath64 with @xmath57 and @xmath60 , respectively , as columns @xcite , @xmath65 where @xmath66 the columns of @xmath67 being orthonormal implies that these matrices represent isometries from @xmath68 into @xmath56 so that @xmath69 .",
    "moreover , the projectors @xmath70 onto the eigenspaces corresponding to the eigenvalues @xmath71 are given by @xmath72 .",
    "the kind of observables we are going to consider are given by matrix valued weyl operators as in ( [ hweyl ] ) , i.e. @xmath73 that yield bounded and self - adjoint operators on @xmath74 . notice that here the symbol @xmath75 is allowed to depend on @xmath44 . in order to ensure that the operator @xmath47 defined by ( [ bweyl ] ) is bounded",
    "one can impose the following condition on its symbol : it shall be smooth in the variables @xmath76 and , moreover , possess an asymptotic expansion @xmath77 in the sense that for all @xmath78 and all multi - indices @xmath79 @xmath80 in particular , @xmath81 and all of its derivatives shall be bounded . here",
    "@xmath82 denotes an arbitrary matrix norm and the short - hand @xmath83 has been used .",
    "the leading term @xmath84 in the semiclassical asymptotics ( [ asymptot ] ) is called _ principal symbol _ and will be viewed as the classical observable corresponding to the quantum observable @xmath47 . for scalar symbols a proof for the fact that ( [ asympdef ] ) implies the boundedness of @xmath47 can , e.g. , be found in @xcite ; this immediately carries over to the present situation , see also @xcite .",
    "the operator @xmath47 defined by ( [ bweyl ] ) for @xmath85 hence can now be extended to all of @xmath74 and is self - adjoint as soon as its symbol @xmath75 is hermitian . in the following",
    "we will always assume this to be the case .",
    "two particular classical observables are the projectors @xmath86 onto the eigenspaces of the symbol ( [ w - symb ] ) of the dirac - hamiltonian . if we assume that the potentials and all of their derivatives are bounded , which poses no severe restriction since we want the electromagnetic fields to vanish as @xmath37 , an inspection of ( [ vwdef ] ) reveals that @xmath86 together with all derivatives are also bounded .",
    "a weyl quantisation of @xmath86 hence yields bounded operators @xmath87 .",
    "these , however , are not yet projection operators on @xmath74 , but a semiclassical construction , see @xcite , allows to introduce bounded and self - adjoint operators @xmath88 with principal symbols @xmath89 that obey @xmath90 .",
    "moreover , up to terms of order @xmath91 these operators fulfill @xmath92 , @xmath93 and commute with @xmath25 . with respect to these semiclassical projectors",
    "one can now split an observable @xmath47 of the type introduced above according to @xmath94 where @xmath95 denote the diagonal and the non - diagonal part , respectively . according to the product rule for",
    "weyl operators ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) @xmath96 and @xmath97 are again bounded and self - adjoint weyl operators with principal symbols @xmath98",
    "in this section we mainly review the derivation of the van vleck - gutzwiller propagator for dirac - hamiltonians that was developed in @xcite . for a detailed exposition see @xcite .",
    "the aim here is to obtain the semiclassically leading asymptotics of the schwartz kernel @xmath99 for the unitary time evolution operator @xmath100 . given an initial state @xmath101 , the solution @xmath102 of the dirac equation ( [ diraceq ] ) with initial condition @xmath103 reads in coordinate representation @xmath104 so that the initial condition for the kernel is @xmath105 .",
    "up to terms of order @xmath91 this kernel can be approximated by a semiclassical fourier integral operator , i.e. @xmath106\\ { \\text{d}}\\xi + o(\\hbar^\\infty ) \\ . \\end{split}\\ ] ] the two additive contributions under the integral refer to the two eigenvalues @xmath107 of the symbol @xmath108 of the dirac - hamiltonian , which each serve as a classical hamiltonian .",
    "the amplitude factors @xmath109 take values in the @xmath12 matrices and are assumed to allow for the asymptotic expansions @xmath110 with initial conditions @xmath111 together with the initial condition @xmath112 for the phase function this ensures the desired behaviour of the representation ( [ scfio ] ) for @xmath113 .",
    "the strategy to obtain a semiclassical approximation for @xmath99 now is the same as in the wkb method : one inserts the ansatz ( [ scfio ] ) with the expansion ( [ ampexpand ] ) into the dirac equation , groups terms together with like powers of @xmath44 , and equates these terms to zero .",
    "this yields a hierarchy of equations for the phase functions @xmath114 and the coefficients @xmath115 that have to be solved order by order in @xmath116 .",
    "the lowest order ( @xmath117 ) equation , together with the definition @xmath118 , relates the phase functions @xmath114 to the solutions @xmath119 of the associated hamilton - jacobi equations @xmath120 hence @xmath119 generate canonical transformations @xmath121 with @xmath122 and @xmath123 such that @xmath124 and @xmath125 are starting and end points , respectively , of solutions @xmath126 , @xmath127 , of the classical equations of motion generated by @xmath107 .",
    "the leading semiclassical asymptotics for the amplitudes then follows from both the equations in leading and next - to - lowest order . for sufficiently small @xmath128",
    "the result reads @xmath129 the restriction to small @xmath128 stems from the non - uniqueness of the solutions @xmath119 of the hamilton - jacobi equations ( [ hjeq ] ) for times beyond which caustics appear .",
    "one is , however , faced with the same problem already in the context of non - relativistic , spinless particles where the respective solution merely consists of the first factor on the right - hand side of ( [ a0sol ] ) . for this case",
    "gutzwiller showed @xcite that one can pass beyond caustics with a correct choice of the phase in the first term of ( [ a0sol ] ) when sign changes occur under the square - root .",
    "the appropriate phase factor that gutzwiller introduced essentially consists of the morse index of the related classical trajectory",
    ". a mathematically rigorous justification of this construction can , e.g. , be found in @xcite .",
    "obviously , exactly the same procedure can be applied to extend ( [ a0sol ] ) to arbitrary , however finite , times .",
    "the factor @xmath130 appearing in ( [ a0sol ] ) is a solution of the spin transport equation @xmath131 with initial condition @xmath132 , in which the time derivative is to be taken along the solutions @xmath133 of the classical equations of motion that are generated by the solutions @xmath119 of the hamilton - jacobi equations ( [ hjeq ] ) .",
    "the @xmath134 matrices @xmath135\\cdot{\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}}\\ ] ] are hermitian and traceless so that according to ( [ spintranseq ] ) the spin transport matrices @xmath130 take values in @xmath136 .",
    "since the solutions @xmath133 of hamilton s equations of motion depend on the initial points @xmath124 , below we also write @xmath137 for @xmath138 . in these variables",
    "the composition law of the spin transport matrices reads @xmath139 in order to calculate the leading semiclassical asymptotics of the time evolution kernel @xmath99 further one employs the method of stationary phase to the integral ( [ scfio ] ) . due to the connection of the phases @xmath114 with the solutions @xmath119 of the hamilton - jacobi equations ,",
    "the stationary points @xmath140 of @xmath114 are such that the canonical transformations generated by @xmath141 map @xmath125 to @xmath142 .",
    "these are therefore the end and starting points , respectively , of the associated solutions @xmath126 of the equations of motion .",
    "thus the stationary points @xmath140 are in one - to - one correspondence with the classical trajectories @xmath143 connecting @xmath144 to @xmath145 in time @xmath128 .",
    "the expression that finally results from the application of the method of stationary phase is to a large extent analogous to the van vleck - gutzwiller propagator ( see @xcite ) for non - relativistic , spinless particles .",
    "differences arise due to ( i ) the presence of two kinds of classical dynamics ( generated by the two hamiltonians @xmath107 ) instead of one , and ( ii ) the presence of the additional factors in the amplitude ( [ a0sol ] ) .",
    "the latter , however , need only be evaluated at the stationary points @xmath140 . as a result one therefore obtains @xmath146 here the sum extends over all solutions @xmath143 of the equations of motion from @xmath144 to @xmath145 in time @xmath128 , and @xmath147 denotes their morse indices .",
    "moreover , the phase functions @xmath114 evaluated at the stationary point @xmath140 related to @xmath143 turn out to be hamilton s principal functions @xmath148 , and @xmath149 we also introduced the abbreviation @xmath150 .    inspecting ( [ scprop ] )",
    "reveals a close similarity to the van vleck - gutzwiller propagator .",
    "the summation goes over the classical trajectories of relativistic particles , such that here only the translational dynamics is relevant .",
    "the spin dynamics then enters through the additional factor @xmath151 that describes the precession of a two - component spinor along the trajectory @xmath143 in the given external fields @xmath2 and @xmath3 . in order to see this recall that @xmath152 , being an isometry from a subspace in @xmath56 to @xmath68 , projects four - component ( dirac ) spinors to two - component spinors .",
    "these two components are the expansion coefficients of the projection to the eigenspace @xmath153 in the basis @xmath154 or @xmath155 , respectively . the @xmath136 matrix",
    "@xmath156 then propagates the two - component spinor along the trajectory @xmath143 towards its end point .",
    "the propagated two - component spinor is then converted back into a four - component ( dirac ) spinor by @xmath157 .",
    "one can thus view the combined dynamics of the spin and translational degrees of freedom as it enters the semiclassical propagator ( [ scprop ] ) to be of a mixed quantum - classical type : the translational dynamics are classical and drive the quantum mechanical spin dynamics .",
    "however , it can be shown that expectation values of the spin operator , which is proportional to @xmath158 , in the two - component spinors exhibit the well known thomas precession of a ` classical ' spin along @xmath143 , see @xcite for more details . moreover , knowing the classical spin precession , one can recover the full spin dynamics , as described by the spin transport matrices @xmath156 , with the help of a certain dynamical and geometric phase @xcite .",
    "having the semiclassical propagator ( [ scprop ] ) available , one could now proceed to derive a semiclassical trace formula , very much in analogy to gutzwiller s original trace formula for non - relativistic , spinless particles @xcite .",
    "one only has to localise in energy first , in order to project out the essential spectrum of the dirac - hamiltonian .",
    "to this end one chooses a smooth function @xmath159 that is supported in the interval @xmath160 where the eigenvalues of @xmath25 are located that one is interested in .",
    "then @xmath161 , defined by the functional calculus given by the spectral theorem , is a bounded and self - adjoint operator with pure point spectrum located in @xmath162 ; its eigenvalues are @xmath163 .",
    "hence the truncated time evolution operator @xmath164 has a schwartz kernel with spectral representation @xmath165 in terms of eigenspinors @xmath48 and eigenvalues @xmath166 of @xmath25 . since @xmath167 , where @xmath161 acts on the variable @xmath145 , the leading semiclassical asymptotics of @xmath168 can immediately be concluded from ( [ scprop ] ) .",
    "the only modification is provided by an additional factor of @xmath169 , where @xmath170 denotes the energy of the trajectory @xmath143 .",
    "the result can then be used to derive a semiclassical trace formula ; see @xcite , where this procedure has been carried out .    here , however , our aim is to include the expectation values @xmath171 of observables @xmath47 as they have been introduced in section [ 3sec ] . to this end",
    "one considers a suitably regularised trace of the operator @xmath172 .",
    "the regularisation requires a test function @xmath173 with compactly supported fourier transform , @xmath174 , so that @xmath175 : = \\frac{1}{2\\pi}\\int_{{\\mathbb r}}\\tilde\\rho(t)\\,\\hat u_\\chi(t)\\ { \\text{d}}t\\ ] ] defines a bounded operator . the map @xmath176 $ ] , where @xmath177 is the operator trace on @xmath74 , then yields a tempered distribution , if the sum @xmath178 is absolutely convergent .",
    "the latter condition certainly holds when the eigenvalues do not accumulate in @xmath162 .",
    "one hence should choose @xmath179 in such a way that possible accumulation points of eigenvalues lie outside of @xmath162 , and that @xmath179 vanishes sufficiently fast towards accumulation points .",
    "under this condition one can calculate the trace of the operator @xmath180 $ ] , @xmath181 the right - hand side of ( [ pretrace ] ) already provides the spectral side of the trace formula we are aiming at .",
    "the semiclassical side of this trace formula can then be obtained from the left - hand side upon introducing the kernel @xmath168 for @xmath182 and calculating the trace in coordinate representation .    before one can perform this computation",
    ", however , one needs the schwartz kernel for the operator @xmath183 , or at least a semiclassical expression for it .",
    "the latter can be derived from the representation ( [ scfio ] ) of the time evolution kernel , when one employs the action of a weyl operator @xmath184 with symbol @xmath185 on functions of the form @xmath186 .",
    "this reads @xmath187 see , e.g. , @xcite .",
    "in a first step one therefore has to apply the operator @xmath188 to @xmath99 , which can be done with the help of ( [ weylonwkb ] ) since according to the functional calculus of @xcite @xmath161 is a weyl operator with principal symbol @xmath189 .",
    "then , in a second step , one repeats the procedure with the observable @xmath47 .",
    "thus @xmath190 yields the leading semiclassical asymptotics for the integrand of the schwartz kernel for the operator @xmath172 in an analogous representation to ( [ scfio ] ) . calculating the trace on the left - hand side of ( [ pretrace ] ) in coordinate representation",
    "therefore requires , in leading semiclassical order , to evaluate the integrals @xmath191 where @xmath192 denotes a matrix trace .",
    "since the integration can not be performed in closed form , one employs the method of stationary phase .",
    "the connection of the phase with the generating functions @xmath119 then reveals that stationary points @xmath193 are such that @xmath194 lies on a periodic orbit @xmath195 with energy @xmath41 and period @xmath196 of the classical dynamics generated by @xmath107 .",
    "one therefore concludes that up to terms of order @xmath91 the expression ( [ pretrace ] ) is given by a sum over the periodic orbits @xmath195 with periods @xmath197 .",
    "we recall that the method of stationary phase also demands that at stationary points the phase be non - degenerate . here",
    "this means that transversal to the ( connected ) manifolds of stationary points , which are at least one dimensional , the matrix of second derivatives of the phase with respect to @xmath198 must have a ( constant ) rank of seven minus the dimension of the respective manifold .",
    "let us explicitly mention two examples :    1 .",
    "the entire hyper - surfaces @xmath199 of constant energy are manifolds of periodic points with trivial periods @xmath200 .",
    "thus @xmath201 are five dimensional manifolds of stationary points . in this case",
    "the non - degeneracy condition means that @xmath41 is a regular value for the hamiltonians @xmath107 , i.e.  @xmath202 for all @xmath203 .",
    "an isolated periodic orbit @xmath195 is non - degenerate , if its monodromy matrix @xmath204 , i.e.  the restriction of the linearised poincar map to the directions transversal to the orbit , has no eigenvalue one .",
    "for simplicity , below we will always restrict attention to these cases , i.e.   we require @xmath41 to be a regular value for the hamiltonians and assume that all periodic orbits with energy @xmath41 are isolated and non - degenerate .",
    "the latter condition is , e.g. , fulfilled by hyperbolic periodic orbits , where all eigenvalues of @xmath204 are different from one in modulus .",
    "however , we would like to stress that a semiclassical trace formula can be derived under more general conditions .",
    "one only needs a non - degeneracy condition for the manifolds of stationary points in order to be able to apply the method of stationary phase .    for the explicit computation of the semiclassical side of the trace formula one should treat each connected manifold of stationary points separately . to this end",
    "we now introduce the partition of unity @xmath205 , with @xmath206 , under the integral ( [ traceint ] ) such that @xmath207 contains only one period @xmath208 of a periodic orbit @xmath195 with energy @xmath41 ; in particular , @xmath209 .",
    "then each summand , labeled by @xmath210 , corresponds to a contribution of exactly one ( isolated and non - degenerate ) periodic orbit .",
    "we , furthermore , reserve the label @xmath211 for the contribution of the manifolds @xmath212 for which @xmath200 .",
    "the necessary computations are almost identical to the case of the trace formula without expectation values of an observable and thus we can direct the reader to @xcite for the details .    it turns out that the leading semiclassical order of the weyl term , i.e.   of the contribution with @xmath211 , reads @xmath213 \\ . \\end{split}\\ ] ] introducing the notation @xmath214 for liouville measure on @xmath212 , the leading order of the weyl term can also be given as @xmath215 \\ .\\ ] ] since the matrices @xmath216 are projectors , the integrands in ( [ weylterm2 ] ) also read @xmath217 , and as a short - hand we will also use @xmath218 for the integrals over @xmath212 .",
    "in the case of an isolated and non - degenerate periodic orbit @xmath195 the evaluation of its contribution to the semiclassical side of the trace formula also proceeds in close analogy to the case without an observable , until it comes to the point where an integration over the primitive periodic orbit associated with @xmath195 is required . in the present situation",
    "the object that has to be integrated along the primitive orbit is the matrix trace of @xmath219 where the last three factors derive from the spin contribution to the semiclassical propagator ( [ scprop ] ) . for the integration we parametrise the periodic orbit by @xmath220 , @xmath221 , where @xmath222 denotes the primitive period associated with @xmath195 , and hence have to evaluate ( [ integrandpo ] ) at @xmath223 .",
    "the quantity that finally enters the trace formula then is a particular average of the principal symbol @xmath224 of the observable along the primitive periodic orbit , @xmath225\\ { \\text{d}}t \\ . \\end{split}\\ ] ] the integrand appearing in ( [ b0pomean1 ] ) can be interpreted as follows : the right - most term projects a four - component ( dirac ) spinor at @xmath220 to the local @xmath107-eigenspace @xmath226 in a two - component representation .",
    "this two - spinor is then propagated once around the periodic orbit and subsequently converted back to a dirac spinor which is finally mapped by @xmath224 .",
    "the integration then averages the result of this procedure over the primitive orbit related to @xmath195 .",
    "altogether , if all periodic orbits generated by the two hamiltonians @xmath107 with an energy @xmath41 that is not a critical value for these hamiltonians are isolated and non - degenerate , the semiclassical trace formula we have been aiming at reads @xmath227 where as usual the action of a periodic orbit is denoted as @xmath228 and the amplitude associated with a periodic orbit , @xmath229 incorporates the monodromy matrix @xmath204 and the maslov index @xmath230 of that orbit .",
    "let us remark that this trace formula reduces to the one derived in @xcite in the case @xmath231 .",
    "obviously , on the left - hand side of ( [ stf ] ) the expectation value then disappears and in the weyl term @xmath232 .",
    "in order to see what happens to the weights @xmath233 of periodic orbits we notice that after a cyclic permutation under the trace in ( [ b0pomean1 ] ) one can employ the fact that @xmath234 , and that @xmath235 is independent of @xmath76 ; hence @xmath236 . with these identifications the trace formula of @xcite is hence recovered .    as a final comment on the trace formula ( [ stf ] )",
    "let us mention that one can view the left - hand side of ( [ stf ] ) as resulting from an application of the weighted spectral density @xmath237 to the test function @xmath238 ( after a suitable shift of the variable ) . in this context the trace formula ( [ stf ] ) can be converted into a distributional identity for the weighted spectral density ( [ specdens ] ) , @xmath239 it is in this form that trace formulae are frequently presented ( see , e.g. , gutzwiller s original work @xcite ) .",
    "the left - hand side of the trace formula ( [ stf ] ) can be seen as a weighted superposition of the expectation values @xmath46 corresponding to the eigenvalues @xmath39 in some interval about @xmath41 of width proportional to @xmath44 .",
    "this is so since @xmath173 is a test function with fourier transform @xmath240 .",
    "thus @xmath238 itself is , indeed , a schwartz function , i.e.  it is rapidly decreasing , and therefore essentially cuts off all terms corresponding to eigenvalues outside of some interval @xmath241 $ ] .",
    "although the length of this interval shrinks to zero in the semiclassical limit , the number of eigenvalues it contains grows , since according to the weyl term of the spectral density ( compare ( [ stfdense ] ) with @xmath231 ) the mean density of eigenvalues increases like @xmath242 . in the following we therefore want to study a semiclassical average of the expectation values @xmath46 related to the @xmath243 eigenvalues @xmath244 $ ] , see ( [ idef ] ) .",
    "more precisely , we want to express the limit @xmath245 in terms of classical quantities .      1 .   for the trace formula ( [ stf ] ) we assumed that all periodic orbits be isolated and non - degenerate .",
    "this is a condition which is , e.g. , met by hyperbolic classical dynamics .",
    "however , hyperbolicity is a strong chaotic property which is not at all necessary for the result we are aiming at",
    ". in fact , a considerably weaker condition suffices : it is only required that the points on the energy shells @xmath212 that lie on periodic orbits are of liouville measure zero .",
    "any ergodic dynamical system shares this property , but even many integrable ones as well .",
    "2 .   for the test function @xmath238 in the trace formula one can not simply choose the characteristic function @xmath246}$ ] of the interval",
    "@xmath247 $ ] , which would provide the sharp cut - off ( [ szegoeaim ] ) in the summation over the eigenvalues , since @xmath246}$ ] is not smooth and , moreover , its fourier transform @xmath248 is not compactly supported .",
    "it even decreases too slowly to make the sum over periodic orbits in ( [ stf ] ) convergent .    despite of these objections",
    "it is nevertheless possible to calculate the limit ( [ szegoeaim ] ) in rather general situations . for the case of pauli - hamiltonians",
    "this has , indeed , been carried out in @xcite .",
    "however , to achieve this one does not employ the trace formula ( [ stf ] ) directly , but rather starts off from ( [ pretrace ] ) , which served as the basic relation from which the trace formula was derived .",
    "again one has to calculate the integral ( [ traceint ] ) , but here we are only interested in the leading semiclassical order . by an inspection of the trace formula one",
    "realises that this is completely determined by the weyl term , i.e.  by the stationary points @xmath193 with @xmath200 and @xmath249 . as a non - degeneracy condition",
    "we therefore only need that @xmath41 is not a critical value for the two hamiltonians @xmath71 . for later purposes",
    "we , however , require this condition to hold for all @xmath250 $ ] with some @xmath251 .",
    "it is then ensured that the non - trivial time components @xmath252 of stationary points can not accumulate at zero ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "we stress that no assumptions on the periodic orbits have to be made apart from the condition that they form a measure - zero set on the energy shells . under the integral ( [ traceint ] ) one now only needs a simple partition of unity , @xmath253 , that separates the stationary points @xmath254 from those with @xmath252 . in order to estimate the latter contribution one",
    "exploits the fact that the points on periodic orbits , which are precisely the stationary points @xmath194 with @xmath252 , are assumed to be of liouville measure zero on @xmath212 . as a consequence one obtains that the leading semiclassical order is solely determined by the weyl contribution ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) , so that @xmath255 in a next step one would like to get rid of the test function @xmath238 and to replace it by a sharp cut - off . under the conditions mentioned above , which led to the relation ( [ preszegoe1 ] ) , this can indeed be done with the help of the tauberian lemma of @xcite .",
    "the only point that still has to be clarified is that the tauberian lemma requires the expectation values of @xmath47 to be non - negative . since , however , @xmath47 is bounded , this condition can be satisfied after shifting the observable by a suitable constant . in effect",
    ", the tauberian lemma of @xcite then allows to simply replace @xmath238 by the characteristic function @xmath246}$ ] , and its fourier transform by @xmath248 .",
    "we also recall that @xmath41 was chosen to be somewhere inside the gap @xmath160 of the essential spectrum of @xmath25 .",
    "thus , for sufficiently small @xmath44 the interval @xmath256 is completely contained in @xmath160 so that the function @xmath257 that serves as to cut off the essential spectrum can be chosen such that @xmath258 for all @xmath45 .",
    "hence @xmath259 furthermore , the choice @xmath231 in ( [ preszegoe2 ] ) yields a semiclassical representation for the number @xmath243 of eigenvalues in the interval @xmath256 , @xmath260 so that ( [ preszegoe2 ] ) and ( [ scn_i ] ) finally allow to determine the limit ( [ szegoeaim ] ) , @xmath261 as desired , the right - hand side of this relation involves only classical quantities .    the result ( [ szegoe ] ) can be converted into a statement about averages of the wigner transforms @xmath262({\\boldsymbol{p}},{\\boldsymbol{x } } ) : = \\int_{{{\\mathbb r}}^3}{\\text{e}}^{-\\frac{{\\text{i}}}{\\hbar}{\\boldsymbol{p}}\\cdot{\\boldsymbol{y } } } \\,\\overline{\\psi_n}\\bigl({\\boldsymbol{x}}-\\tfrac{1}{2}{\\boldsymbol{y}}\\bigr)\\otimes   \\psi_n\\bigl({\\boldsymbol{x}}+\\tfrac{1}{2}{\\boldsymbol{y}}\\bigr)\\ { \\text{d}}y\\ ] ] of the eigenspinors @xmath263 , since expectation values of weyl operators can be expressed as @xmath264({\\boldsymbol{p}},{\\boldsymbol{x}})\\,b({\\boldsymbol{p}},{\\boldsymbol{x}};\\hbar)\\bigr ) \\",
    "{ \\text{d}}p\\,{\\text{d}}x\\ .\\ ] ] here @xmath192 denotes a matrix trace , whose presence prevents an immediate conclusion from ( [ szegoe ] ) . to proceed nevertheless",
    ", we remark that if one replaces the observable @xmath47 by its diagonal part @xmath96 , see ( [ bsplit ] ) and ( [ bsplitdef ] ) , the right - hand side of ( [ szegoe ] ) remains unchanged .",
    "this immediately follows from the form ( [ bsplitpsymb ] ) of the principal symbols of the diagonal part and the non - diagonal part , respectively .",
    "thus , in particular , @xmath265 we can therefore now restrict attention to observables @xmath47 that are weyl quantisations of symbols @xmath266 . starting with a quantisation of , e.g.",
    ", @xmath267 one splits this matrix valued symbol into a sum of contributions where all matrix entries but one vanish , so that now one essentially deals with scalar operators and symbols . applying ( [ szegoe ] ) to these then finally yields @xmath268({\\boldsymbol{p}},{\\boldsymbol{x } } ) \\\\ & = \\frac{1}{2}\\,\\frac{\\operatorname{vol}({\\omega}_e^+)\\,{\\delta}(h^+({\\boldsymbol{p}},{\\boldsymbol{x}})-e)\\,p_0^+      ( { \\boldsymbol{p}},{\\boldsymbol{x}})+\\operatorname{vol}({\\omega}_e^-)\\,{\\delta}(h^-({\\boldsymbol{p}},{\\boldsymbol{x}})-e)\\,p_0 ^ -({\\boldsymbol{p}},{\\boldsymbol{x } } ) }     { \\operatorname{vol}({\\omega}_e^+)+\\operatorname{vol}({\\omega}_e^- ) } \\ . \\end{split}\\ ] ] here the convergence as @xmath269 has to be understood in the sense of distributions , i.e.  after an application to ( matrix valued ) test functions . in ( [ szegoe ] ) the latter are given by the symbols of weyl operators .",
    "let us add a few remarks on the result ( [ szegoe ] ) .",
    "relations of this kind , which express semiclassical averages of quantum observables in terms of classical averages are known as ( weak versions of ) _ szeg limit formulae _",
    "they are well known for schrdinger - hamiltonians ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) and have recently been established for pauli - hamiltonians @xcite . in the present case",
    "the classical side contains the two contributions that arise from projections of the classical observable @xmath224 to the two eigenspaces of the symbol @xmath108 and hence correspond to ` particles ' and ` anti - particles ' , respectively .",
    "the relative weights of the two terms are fixed by the relative volumes of the corresponding energy shells .",
    "it often occurs that for a given energy @xmath41 only one of the energy shells is non - empty , and then only one contribution appears on the right - hand side of ( [ szegoe ] ) .",
    "the only exceptional situations are those where the klein paradox occurs , i.e.   where a tunneling between particle and anti - particle states is possible . the corresponding mixture",
    "is then accounted for by the presence of both terms on the classical side of ( [ szegoe ] ) .",
    "due to the relation ( [ szegoend ] ) , however , semiclassically transitions from particle to anti - particle states , or vice versa , play no role . on the right - hand side of ( [ szegoewigner ] )",
    "this effect is caused by the fact that only terms proportional to the projectors @xmath216 occur so that the semiclassically averaged wigner transforms are block - diagonal with respect to the particle and anti - particle subspaces .",
    "obviously , szeg limit formulae of the kind ( [ szegoe ] ) contain considerably less information on expectation values than trace formulae like ( [ stf ] ) .",
    "they demonstrate that the semiclassically leading term of the weighted spectral density ( [ stfdense ] ) is the semiclassical average of the observable multiplied by the leading weyl - term of the spectral density .",
    "fluctuations of expectation values about the semiclassical average are then described by the sum over periodic orbits in ( [ stfdense ] ) and therefore depend on classical properties more sensibly than the average itself .",
    "however , the trace formula ( [ stf ] ) does not allow to draw conclusions about individual expectation values since on its spectral side it contains the test function @xmath238 , whereas on its semiclassical side the fourier transform @xmath270 appears .",
    "thus , by fourier duality , shrinking the ( effective ) support of @xmath238 results in a growing ( effective ) support of @xmath270 , finally leading to a divergent , and thus uncontrollable , sum over periodic orbits . the smallest support of @xmath238 that can , indeed , be handled leads to the semiclassical average ( [ szegoe ] ) .",
    "however , in the same way as the gutzwiller trace formula is not suited for the representation of individual eigenvalues , but enables a semiclassical analysis of spectral correlations ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) , the trace formula ( [ stf ] ) can be used to determine correlations of expectation values as , e.g. , in @xcite .",
