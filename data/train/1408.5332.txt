    "real - world design problems in engineering and industry are usually multiobjective or multicriteria , and these multiple objectives are often conflicting one another , which makes it impossible to use any single design option without compromise .",
    "common approaches are to provide good approximations to the true pareto fronts of the problem of interest so that decision - makers can rank different options , depending on their preferences or their utilities ( abbass and sarker 2002 ; babu and gujarathi 2007 ; cagnina et al .",
    "2008 ; deb , 1999 , 2000 , 2001 ; reyes - sierra and coello 2006 ) . compared with single objective optimization , multiobjective",
    "optimization has its additional challenging issues such as time complexity , inhomogeneity and dimensionality .",
    "it is usually more time consuming to obtain the true pareto fronts because it usually requires to produce many points on the pareto front for good approximations .",
    "in addition , even accurate solutions on a pareto front can be obtained , there is still no guarantee that these solution points will distribute uniformly on the front .",
    "in fact , it is often difficult to obtain the whole front without any part missing . for single objective optimization",
    ", the optimal solution can often be a single point in the solution space , while for bi - objective optimization , the pareto front forms a curve , and for tri - objective cases , it becomes a surface .",
    "in fact , higher dimensional problems can have extremely complex hypersurface as its pareto front ( madavan 2002 ; marler and arora 2004 ; yang 2010a ; yang and gandomi 2012 ) .",
    "consequently , it is typically more challenging to solve such high - dimensional problems .    in the current literature of engineering optimization",
    ", a class of nature - inspired algorithms have shown their promising performance and have thus become popular and widely used , and these algorithms are mostly swarm intelligence based ( coello 1999 ; deb et al .",
    "2002 ; geem et al . 2001 ; geem 2009 ; ray and liew 2002 ; yang 2010,2010b,2011a ; gandomi and yang 2011 ;",
    "gandomi et al .",
    "metaheuristic algorithms such as particle swarm optimization , harmony search and cuckoo search are among the most popular ( geem 2009 ; yang 2010 ) .",
    "for example , harmony search , developed by zong woo geem in 2001 ( geem et al .",
    "2001 ; geem 2006 , 2009 ) , has been applied in many areas such as highly challenging water distribution networks ( geem 2006 ) and discrete structural optimization ( lee et al .",
    "2005 ) . other algorithms such as shuffled frog - leaping algorithm and particle swarm optimizers have been applied to various optimization problems ( eusuff et al .",
    "2006 ; he et al .",
    "2004 ; huang 1996 ) .",
    "there are many reasons for the popularity of metaheuristic algorithms , and flexibility and simplicity of these algorithms certainly contribute to their success .",
    "the main aim of this paper is to extend the flower pollination algorithm ( fpa ) , developed by xin - she yang in 2012 ( yang 2012 ) , for single objective optimization to solve multiobjective optimization , and thus developed a multi - objective flower pollination algorithm ( mofpa ) .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows : section 2 outlines the basic characteristics of flower pollination in nature and then introduce in detail the ideas of flower pollination algorithm . section 3 then presents the validation of the fpa by numerical experiments and a few selected multiobjective benchmarks .",
    "then , in section 4 , two real - world design benchmarks are solved to design a welded beam and a disc brake , each with two objectives .",
    "finally , some relevant issues are discussed and conclusions are drawn in section 5 .",
    "it is estimated that there are over a quarter of a million types of flowering plants in nature and that about 80% of all plant species are flowering species .",
    "it still remains a mystery how flowering plants came to dominate the landscape from the cretaceous period ( walker 2009 ) .",
    "flowering plants have been evolving for at least more than 125 million years and flowers have become so influential in evolution , it is unimaginable what the plant world would look like without flowers .",
    "the main purpose of a flower is ultimately reproduction via pollination .",
    "flower pollination is typically associated with the transfer of pollen , and such transfer is often linked with pollinators such as insects , birds , bats and other animals .",
    "in fact , some flowers and insects have co - evolved into a very specialized flower - pollinator partnership .",
    "for example , some flowers can only attract and can only depend on a specific species of insects or birds for successful pollination .",
    "pollination can take two major forms : abiotic and biotic .",
    "about 90% of flowering plants belong to biotic pollination .",
    "that is , pollen is transferred by pollinators such as insects and animals .",
    "about 10% of pollination takes abiotic form which does not require any pollinators . wind and diffusion help pollination of such flowering plants , and grass",
    "is a good example of abiotic pollination ( sciencedaily 2001 ; glover 2007 ) .",
    "pollinators , or sometimes called pollen vectors , can be very diverse .",
    "it is estimated there are at least about 200,000 varieties of pollinators such as insects , bats and birds .",
    "honeybees are a good example of pollinators , and they have also developed the so - called flower constancy .",
    "that is , these pollinators tend to visit exclusive certain flower species while bypassing other flower species .",
    "such flower constancy may have evolutionary advantages because this will maximize the transfer of flower pollen to the same or conspecific plants , and thus maximizing the reproduction of the same flower species .",
    "such flower constancy may be advantageous for pollinators as well , because they can be sure that nectar supply is available with their limited memory and minimum cost of learning , switching or exploring . rather than focusing on some unpredictable but potentially more rewarding new flower species ,",
    "flower constancy may require minimum investment cost and more likely guaranteed intake of nectar ( waser 1986 ) .",
    "pollination can be achieved by self - pollination or cross - pollination .",
    "cross - pollination , or allogamy , means pollination can occur from pollen of a flower of a different plant , while self - pollination is the fertilization of one flower , such as peach flowers , from pollen of the same flower or different flowers of the same plant , which often occurs when there is no reliable pollinator available .",
    "biotic , cross - pollination may occur at long distance , and the pollinators such as bees , bats , birds and flies can fly a long distance , thus they can considered as the global pollination .",
    "in addition , bees and birds may behave as lvy flight behaviour with jump or fly distance steps obeying a lvy distribution ( pavlyukevich 2007 ) .",
    "furthermore , flower constancy can be considered as an increment step using the similarity or difference of two flowers .    from the biological evolution point of view",
    ", the objective of the flower pollination is the survival of the fittest and the optimal reproduction of plants in terms of numbers as well as the most fittest .",
    "this can be considered as an optimization process of plant species .",
    "all the above factors and processes of flower pollination interact so as to achieve optimal reproduction of the flowering plants .",
    "therefore , this may motivate us to design new optimization algorithms .",
    "flower pollination algorithm ( fpa ) was developed by xin - she yang in 2012 ( yang 2012 ) , inspired by the flow pollination process of flowering plants .",
    "fpa has been extended to multi - objective optimization ( yang et al .",
    "for simplicity , the following four rules are used :    1 .",
    "biotic and cross - pollination can be considered as a process of global pollination , and pollen - carrying pollinators move in a way which obeys lvy flights ( rule 1 ) .",
    "2 .   for local pollination , abiotic pollination and self - pollination are used ( rule 2 ) .",
    "pollinators such as insects can develop flower constancy , which is equivalent to a reproduction probability that is proportional to the similarity of two flowers involved ( rule 3 ) .",
    "the interaction or switching of local pollination and global pollination can be controlled by a switch probability @xmath0 $ ] , slightly biased towards local pollination ( rule 4 ) .    in order to formulate the updating formulas , the above rules have to be converted into proper updating equations .",
    "for example , in the global pollination step , flower pollen gametes are carried by pollinators such as insects , and pollen can travel over a long distance because insects can often fly and move in a much longer range .",
    "therefore , rule 1 and flower constancy ( rule 3 ) can be represented mathematically as _ i^t+1=_i^t + l ( ) ( _ * -_i^t ) , where @xmath1 is the pollen @xmath2 or solution vector @xmath3 at iteration @xmath4 , and @xmath5 is the current best solution found among all solutions at the current generation / iteration .",
    "here @xmath6 is a scaling factor to control the step size .",
    "here @xmath7 is the parameter , more specifically the lvy - flights - based step size , that corresponds to the strength of the pollination .",
    "since insects may move over a long distance with various distance steps , a lvy flight can be used to mimic this characteristic efficiently .",
    "that is , @xmath8 is drawn from a lvy distribution l ~ , ( s s_0>0 ) .",
    "[ levy - power ] here @xmath9 ) is the standard gamma function , and this distribution is valid for large steps @xmath10 . in theory , it is required that @xmath11 , but in practice @xmath12 can be as small as @xmath13 .",
    "however , it is not trivial to generate pseudo - random step sizes that correctly obey this lvy distribution ( [ levy - power ] ) .",
    "there are a few methods for drawing such random numbers , and",
    "the most efficient one from our studies is that the so - called mantegna algorithm for drawing step size @xmath14 by using two gaussian distributions @xmath15 and @xmath16 by the following transformation ( mantegna 1994 ) s= , u ~n(0 , ^2 ) , v ~n(0,1 ) . here",
    "@xmath17 means that the samples are drawn from a gaussian normal distribution with a zero mean and a variance of @xmath18 .",
    "the variance can be calculated by ^2 = ^1/. this formula looks complicated , but it is just a constant for a given @xmath19 .",
    "for example , when @xmath20 , the gamma functions become @xmath21 and ^2=^1/1=1 .",
    "it has been proved mathematically that the mantegna algorithm can produce the random samples that obey the required distribution ( [ levy - flight ] ) correctly ( mantegna 1994 ) . by using this pseudo - random number algorithm ,",
    "@xmath22 step sizes have been drawn to form a consecutive 50 steps of lvy flights as shown in fig .",
    "[ levy - flight ] .    for the local pollination , both rule 2 and rule 3 can be represented as _ i^t+1=_i^t + ( _ j^t -_k^t ) , where @xmath23 and @xmath24 are pollen from different flowers of the same plant species .",
    "this essentially mimics the flower constancy in a limited neighborhood .",
    "mathematically , if @xmath23 and @xmath24 comes from the same species or selected from the same population , this equivalently becomes a local random walk if @xmath25 is drawn from a uniform distribution in [ 0,1 ] .",
    ", width=384,height=288 ]    in principle , flower pollination activities can occur at all scales , both local and global .",
    "but in reality , adjacent flower patches or flowers in the not - so - far - away neighborhood are more likely to be pollinated by local flower pollen than those far away .",
    "in order to mimic this feature , a switch probability ( rule 4 ) or proximity probability @xmath26 can be effectively used to switch between common global pollination to intensive local pollination . to start with",
    ", a naive value of @xmath27 may be used as an initially value .",
    "a preliminary parametric showed that @xmath28 may work better for most applications .",
    "a multiobjective optimization problem with @xmath29 objectives can be written in general as f_1 ( ) , f_2 ( ) , ... , f_m ( ) , [ mofpa - obj ] subject to the nonlinear equality and inequality constraints h_j()=0 , ( j=1,2, ... ,j ) , g_k ( ) 0 , ( k=1,2 , ... , k ) . in order to use the techniques for single objective optimization or extend the methods for solving multiobjective problems , there are different approaches to achieve this .",
    "one of the simplest ways is to use a weighted sum to combine multiple objectives into a composite single objective f=_i=1^m w_i f_i , [ single - obj ] with _ i=1^m w_i=1 , w_i > 0 , where @xmath29 is the number of objectives and @xmath30 are non - negative weights .",
    "the fundamental idea of this weighted sum approach is that these weighting coefficients act as the preferences for these multiobjectives . for a given set of @xmath31",
    ", the optimization process will produce a single point of the pareto front of the problem . for a different set of @xmath32 , another point on the pareto front can be generated . with a sufficiently large number of combinations of weights , a good approximation to the true pareto front can be obtained .",
    "it is has proved that the solutions to the problem with the combined objective ( [ single - obj ] ) are pareto - optimal if the weights are positive for all the objectives , and these are also pareto - optimal to the original problem ( [ mofpa - obj ] ) ( miettinen 1999 ; deb 2001 ) . in practice ,",
    "a set of random numbers @xmath33 are first drawn for a uniform distribution @xmath34 .",
    "then , the weights @xmath32 can be calculated by normalization .",
    "that is w_i= , so that @xmath35 can be satisfied .",
    "for example , for three objectives @xmath36 , @xmath37 and @xmath38 , three random numbers / weights can be drawn from a uniform distribution @xmath39 $ ] , and they may be @xmath40 , @xmath41 and @xmath42 in one instance of sampling runs . then , we have @xmath43 , and @xmath44 .",
    "indeed , @xmath45 is satisfied .    in order to obtain the pareto front accurately with solutions",
    "relatively uniformly distributed on the front , random weights @xmath32 should be used , which should be as different as possible ( miettinen 1999 ) . from the benchmarks that have been tested , the weighted sum with random weights usually works well as can be seen below .",
    "there are many different test functions for multiobjective optimization ( zitzler and thiele 1999 ; ziztler et al .",
    "2000 ; zhang et al . 2009 ) , but a subset of some widely used functions provides a wide range of diverse properties in terms of pareto front and pareto optimal set . to validate the proposed mofpa , a subset of these functions with convex , non - convex and discontinuous pareto fronts have been selected , including 7 single objective test functions and 4 multiobjective test functions , and two bi - objective design problems .      before proceeding to solve multiobjective optimization problems , the algorithm",
    "should first be validated by solving some well - known single objective test functions .",
    "there are at least over a hundred well - known test functions .",
    "however , there is no agreed set of test functions for validating new algorithms , though some review and literature do exist ( ackley 1987 ; floudas et al . 1999 ; hedar 2012 ; yang 2010a ) . here",

    "<S> multiobjective design optimization problems require multiobjective optimization techniques to solve , and it is often very challenging to obtain high - quality pareto fronts accurately . in this paper , the recently developed flower pollination algorithm ( fpa ) is extended to solve multiobjective optimization problems . </S>",
    "<S> the proposed method is used to solve a set of multobjective test functions and two bi - objective design benchmarks , and a comparison of the proposed algorithm with other algorithms has been made , which shows that fpa is efficient with a good convergence rate . </S>",
    "<S> finally , the importance for further parametric studies and theoretical analysis are highlighted and discussed .    </S>",
