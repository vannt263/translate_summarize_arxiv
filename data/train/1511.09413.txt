    "conveying information over a distance has been a problem over decades , and is urgently demanded for different dimensions and various environments . the conventional solution is to utilize electrical- or electromagnetic - enabled communication , which is unfortunately inapplicable or inappropriate in very small dimensions or in specific environments , such as in salt water , tunnels , or human bodies .",
    "recent breakthroughs in bio - nano technology have motivated molecular communication @xcite to be a biologically - inspired technique for nanonetworks , where devices with functional components on the scale of 1 to 100 nanometers , namely nanomachines , share information over distance via chemical signals in nanometer to micrometer scale environments .",
    "diffusion - based mc is the most simple , general and energy efficient transportation paradigm without the need for external energy or infrastructure , where molecules propagate via the random motion , namely brownian motion , caused by collisions with the fluid s molecules .",
    "examples include deoxyribonucleic acid ( dna ) signaling among dna segments @xcite and calcium signaling among cells @xcite . in a practical bio - inspired system , the surface of a receiver",
    "is covered with selective receptors , which are sensitive to a specific type of information molecule ( e.g. , specific peptides or calcium ions ) .",
    "the surface of the receiver may adsorb or bind with this specific information molecule @xcite .",
    "one example is that the influx of calcium towards the center of a receiver ( e.g. , cell ) is induced by the reception of a calcium signal @xcite . despite growing research efforts ,",
    "the chemical reaction receiver is rarely accurately modeled and characterized in most of the literature except the works from yilmaz @xcite and chou @xcite , since the local reactions complicate the solution of the reaction - diffusion equations .",
    "unlike existing works on mc , we consider the reversible adsorption and desorption ( a@xmath0d ) receiver , which is capable of adsorbing a certain type of information molecule near its surface , and desorbing the information molecules previously adsorbed at its surface .",
    "a@xmath0d is a widely - observed process for colloids @xcite , proteins @xcite , and polymers @xcite .",
    "also , the a@xmath0d process simplifies to the special case of an infinitely absorbing receiver .",
    "however , its modeling , analysis , and simulation in the mc domain have never been investigated since the dynamic concentration change near the surface is more challenging than existing works with a passive receiver or an absorbing receiver .    from a theoretical perspective",
    ", researchers have derived the equilibrium concentration of a@xmath0d @xcite , which is insufficient to model the time - varying channel impulse response ( and ultimately the communications performance ) of an a@xmath0d receiver . from a simulation perspective , the simulation design for the a@xmath0d process of molecules at the surface of a _ planar _",
    "receiver was proposed in @xcite .",
    "however , the simulation procedure for the _ mc communication system _ with a _ spherical _ a@xmath0d receiver , where the information molecules , triggered by the transmission of multiple pulses , propagate via free - diffusion through the channel , and contribute to the received signal through a@xmath0d at the surface of the receiver , has never been solved and reported .",
    "this is due to the complexity in modeling the coupling effect of adsorption and desorption under diffusion , as well as accurately and dynamically tracking the location and the number of diffused molecules , adsorbed molecules and desorbed molecules .    despite the aforementioned challenges , in this paper we consider the diffusion - based mc system with a point transmitter and an a@xmath0d receiver .",
    "the goal of this paper is to characterize the impact of the a@xmath0d receiver on the net number of newly - adsorbed molecules expected .",
    "our major contributions are summarized as follows .    1 .",
    "we present an analytical model for the diffusion - based mc system with an a@xmath0d receiver .",
    "we derive the exact expression for the channel impulse response at a spherical a@xmath0d receiver in a three dimensional ( 3d ) fluid environment due to a single release of multiple molecules ( single transmission ) .",
    "we then derive the _ net _ number of _ newly_-adsorbed molecules expected at the surface of the a@xmath0d receiver in any time duration .",
    "we propose a simulation algorithm to simulate the diffusion , adsorption and desorption behavior of information molecules based on a particle - based simulation framework .",
    "unlike existing simulation platforms ( e.g. , smoldyn @xcite , nanons @xcite ) , our simulation algorithm captures the dynamic process of a mc system , which are the molecule emission , free diffusion , and at the surface of the receiver .",
    "our simulation results are in close agreement with the derived number of adsorbed molecules expected .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii , we introduce the system model . in section iii , we present the channel impulse response of information molecules . in section iv ,",
    "we present the simulation framework . in section v , we discuss the numerical and simulation results . in section",
    "vi , we conclude our contributions .",
    "we consider a 3-dimensional ( 3d ) diffusion - based mc system in a fluid environment with a point transmitter and a spherical a@xmath0d receiver .",
    "we assume spherical symmetry where the transmitter is _ effectively _ a spherical shell and the molecules are released from random points over the shell ; the actual angle to the transmitter when a molecule hits the receiver is ignored , so this assumption can not accommodate a flowing environment .",
    "the point transmitter is located at a distance @xmath1 from the center of the receiver and is at a distance @xmath2 from the nearest point on the surface of the receiver with radius @xmath3 .",
    "the extension to an asymmetric spherical model that accounts for the actual angle to the transmitter when a molecule hits the receiver complicates the derivation of the channel impulse response , and may be solved following @xcite .",
    "we assume all receptors are equivalent and can accommodate at most one adsorbed molecule .",
    "the ability of a molecule to adsorb at a given site is independent of the occupation of neighboring receptors .",
    "the spherical receiver is assumed to have no physical limitation on the number of molecules adsorbed to the receiver surface ( i.e. , we ignore saturation ) .",
    "this is an appropriate assumption for a sufficiently low number of adsorbed molecules , or for a sufficiently high concentration of receptors .",
    "we also assume perfect synchronization between the transmitter and the receiver as in most literature @xcite .",
    "we consider three processes : emission , propagation , and reception , which are detailed in the following .",
    "the point transmitter releases one type of information molecule ( e.g. , hormones , pheromones , or deoxyribonucleic acid ( dna ) ) to the receiver for information transmission .",
    "the transmitter emits @xmath4 information molecules at @xmath5 , where we define the initial condition as @xcite @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the molecule distribution function at time @xmath8 and distance @xmath9 with initial distance @xmath1 .",
    "we also define the first boundary condition as @xmath10 such that a molecule that diffuses extremely far away from the receiver is effectively removed from the fluid environment .",
    "once the information molecules are emitted , they diffuse by randomly colliding with other molecules in the environment . this random motion",
    "is called brownian motion @xcite .",
    "the concentration of information molecules is assumed to be sufficiently low that the collisions between those information molecules are ignored @xcite , such that each information molecule diffuses independently with constant diffusion coefficient @xmath11 . the propagation model in a 3d environment",
    "is described by fick s second law @xcite : @xmath12 where the diffusion coefficient is found experimentally @xcite .",
    "we consider the reversible a@xmath0d receiver , which is capable of counting the net number of newly - adsorbed molecules at the surface of the receiver .",
    "any molecule that hits the receiver surface is either adsorbed to the receiver surface or reflected back into the fluid environment , based on the adsorption rate @xmath13 ( length@xmath14time@xmath15 ) .",
    "the adsorbed molecules either desorb or remain stationary at the surface of receiver , based on the desorption rate @xmath16 ( time@xmath15 ) .    at @xmath5 ,",
    "there are no information molecules at the receiver surface , so the second initial condition is @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the average concentration of molecules that are adsorbed to the receiver surface at time @xmath19 .    for the solid - fluid interface located at @xmath3 ,",
    "the second boundary condition of the information molecules is @xcite @xmath20 where @xmath13 and @xmath16 are non - zero finite constants . here",
    ", the adsorption rate @xmath13 is approximately limited to the thermal velocity of potential adsorbents ( e.g. , @xmath21 @xmath22 for a 50 kda protein at 37 @xmath23c ) @xcite ; the desorption rate @xmath16 is typically from @xmath24 @xmath25 and @xmath26 @xmath27 @xcite .    the surface concentration @xmath18 changes over time as follows : @xmath28 which shows that the change in the adsorbed concentration over time is equal to the flux of diffusion molecules towards the surface .",
    "combining and , we write @xmath29 which is known as the robin or radiation boundary condition , and shows that the equivalent adsorption rate is proportional to the molecule concentration at the surface .",
    "in this section , we first derive the spherically - symmetric spatial distribution @xmath30 , which is the probability of finding a molecule at distance @xmath9 and time @xmath19 .",
    "we then derive the flux at the surface of the a@xmath0d receiver , from which we derive the exact number of adsorbed molecules expected at the surface of the receiver . in the following theorem",
    ", we solve the time - varying spatial distribution of information molecules at the surface of the receiver .    the expected time - varying spatial distribution of an information molecule released into a 3d fluid environment with a reversible adsorbing receiver is given by @xmath31 where @xmath32 and @xmath33 is the complex conjugate of @xmath34 .",
