    "in a series of recent papers we have studied the consequences of local impurity - induced magnetic order in fe - based systems .",
    "specifically this concerns 1 ) the effect of the induced magnetization on the local density of states near potential scatterers@xcite , 2 ) unusual rkky couplings of magnetic impurities@xcite , 3 ) the emergence of nematogen impurities in the spin - density wave ( sdw ) phase@xcite , and 4 ) the generation of elongated scattering centers in the nematic phase of the pnictides@xcite .",
    "the latter two properties are directly related to the existence of electronic c@xmath0 dimer states in underdoped pnictides@xcite , and has been recently proposed as a crucial player in explaining e.g. the temperature dependence of the resistivity anisotropy of the 122 systems.@xcite    the slowing down of magnetic fluctuations and subsequent induction of static short - range magnetic order near spatial inhomogeneities has been extensively discussed within one - band models relevant for cuprates.@xcite this applies to non - magnetic disorder@xcite , grain boundaries@xcite , and vortices@xcite .",
    "typically , in these cases @xmath1-wave superconductivity is crucial for the generation of local magnetic order due to the significant enhancement of the local density of states ( ldos ) near the fermi level only in the presence of the superconducting gap allowing for disorder - induced bound or resonant states .",
    "this is not the case for the typical models applicable to iron pnictides as will be discussed below .    here",
    ", we revisit the properties of local magnetic order induced by non - magnetic point - like impurities in the iron pnictides .",
    "we obtain the general phase diagram for induced order , and explain it in terms of a strongly local modified density of states near the fermi level by the impurities .",
    "the five - orbital model hamiltonian is given by @xmath2 the first term is a tight - binding model , @xmath3 here the operators @xmath4 ( @xmath5 ) create ( annihilate ) an electron at the @xmath6-th site in the orbital @xmath7 and with spin projection @xmath8 , and @xmath9 is the chemical potential . the indices @xmath7 and @xmath10 run through 1 to 5 corresponding to the five @xmath11 , @xmath12 , @xmath13 , @xmath14 and @xmath15 iron 3d orbitals .",
    "the hopping integrals @xmath16 are the same as those in ikeda _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite , included up to fifth nearest neighbors .",
    "the third term in eq.([eq : h ] ) describes the onsite hubbard interaction @xmath17 including the intraorbital ( interorbital ) on - site repulsion @xmath18 ( @xmath19 ) , the hund s coupling @xmath20 and the pair hopping energy @xmath21 .",
    "we assume spin rotational invariance @xmath22 , @xmath23 , and fix @xmath24 . finally , @xmath25 is the impurity potential , adding a potential energy @xmath26 at the impurity site @xmath27 .",
    "we neglect the orbital dependence of the impurity potential for simplicity .",
    "after mean - field decoupling of eq .  , we solve the following eigenvalue problem @xmath28 , where @xmath29 ,   \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] on a @xmath30 lattice with self - consistently obtained densities @xmath31 for each site and orbital .",
    "ev and @xmath32 ev . ]",
    "the mean field ground state of the hamiltonian   without disorder can be controlled by the interaction parameter @xmath18 . for @xmath18 lower than a critical value of @xmath33 ev",
    ", the undoped homogeneous system remains non - magnetic . above @xmath34",
    "the system is unstable to @xmath35 [ or @xmath36 ordering . depending on parameters it can , however , be energetically favorable to spin polarize regions around the non - magnetic impurities even in the normal paramagnetic state .",
    "figure  [ fig:1](a ) shows the real space magnetization in a case where impurity - induced order is present . in this particular case",
    ", the impurity site itself exhibits the largest induced moment in contrast to the similar one - band result where the nearest - neighbor sites contain the largest spin polarization@xcite .",
    "the fourier transform of the magnetization in fig .",
    "[ fig:1](a ) is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:1](b ) .",
    "it is dominated by broad peaks at @xmath37 and @xmath38 , and weaker but sharp peaks at @xmath39 .",
    "the latter originate from the longer - range but weaker tails of the induced magnetization@xcite .    in order to map out",
    "when magnetization is locally nucleated , we explore the parameter space by varying the interaction @xmath18 and impurity strength @xmath26 . for the band structure of ref .",
    ", only repulsive potentials , @xmath40 , are capable of inducing magnetic order locally at zero temperature and @xmath41 filling .",
    "the resulting moment at the potential site is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:2 ] .",
    "the triangular - shaped region of finite impurity - induced magnetization exhibits a clear asymmetry by a linear ( curved ) phase boundary in the large ( low ) @xmath26 limit .",
    "it is noteworthy that due to the curved lower phase boundary , there exist values of the potential @xmath26 ( around @xmath42 ev for the present band structure and doping level ) where it is favorable to locally nucleate magnetism only for weak values of @xmath18 , contrary to naive expectations from a standard stoner instability criterion .     and @xmath26 in the normal state .",
    "]    the above results can be understood by studying the evolution of the ldos in the presence of the impurity .",
    "specifically , by tracking the formation of impurity resonant states close to the fermi energy ( @xmath43 ) as a function of @xmath18 and @xmath26 at the impurity site .",
    "we focus initially on the effect of correlations @xmath18 for a fixed potential @xmath44 ev ( horizontal dashed white line in fig .",
    "[ fig:2 ] ) with results shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:3](a ) . without correlations ( @xmath45 ) , the resonant state exists at high positive energies ( @xmath46 ev ) . for increasing @xmath18 ,",
    "however , as seen from fig .",
    "[ fig:3](a ) the resonant state is pushed to lower energies , crosses @xmath43 , and moves to negative energies .",
    "the largest density of states near @xmath43 is found around @xmath47 ev which explains the curved lower edge of the magnetization region .",
    "ev and several @xmath18 , and ( b ) for @xmath47ev and a representative range of potential strengths @xmath26 as shown in the legend . ]",
    "figure  [ fig:3](b ) shows the ldos at the impurity site for @xmath48 ev for different values of the impurity strength @xmath26 ( vertical dashed white line in fig .",
    "[ fig:2 ] ) .",
    "evidently , the resonant state exhibits the opposite trend to fig .",
    "[ fig:3](a ) by moving to higher energies upon increasing the impurity strength .",
    "thus , the enhanced ldos at @xmath43 by the resonant state is maximal inside the triangular wedge - shaped region of fig .",
    "[ fig:2 ] , and the fact that impurity - induced magnetization exists in this same region agrees well with the stoner instability criterion .",
    "the reason resonant states can exist in the normal state is due to the `` gapped '' @xmath49 orbitals near the fermi level . for the present band ,",
    "the density of states of e.g. the @xmath15 orbital is negligible in the energy range of fig .",
    "[ fig:3 ] , and hence it is possible to generate reasonably sharp resonant states of mainly @xmath15 character in this energy window .",
    "we have verified that indeed the orbital content of the resonant states of fig .",
    "[ fig:3 ] ( as well as the onsite magnetization ) is almost entirely of @xmath15 character .",
    "this is unlike the case of e.g. lifeas where the induced magnetization exists mainly on nearest - neighbor sites , and is made up from the @xmath11 and @xmath12 orbitals@xcite .",
    "these results highlight the importance of using realistic five - band models in studies of impurity - induced local order of the iron pnictides .",
    "in summary , we have discussed the generation of local magnetic order in the normal state of the fe - based superconductors within a five - band model that includes onsite coulomb interactions at the mean - field level .",
    "we have mapped out the phase diagram as a function of @xmath18 and @xmath26 for the existence of local magnetic order , and explained the main topology of the phase diagram in terms of impurity - resonant states near the fermi level .",
