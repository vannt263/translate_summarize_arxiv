    "we have known for a while that the baryonic mass of galaxies , including that of our own milky way , falls short of what is expected for their total mass ( @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "this `` missing '' mass is either ejected from galaxies into the intergalactic medium ( igm ) or still resides in the circumgalactic medium ( cgm ) .",
    "our galaxy is a member of the local group of galaxies , and it is possible that the matter ejected from the galaxy resides in the local group . either in the cgm or in the local group medium ( lgm ) , the baryonic mass is expected in a warm - hot gas phase at temperatures between @xmath5 .",
    "this is probably the reason why earlier studies probing only cooler gas could not account for it .",
    "the warm component of this phase at @xmath6 has been observed in the uv traced by absorption lines of ionized metals , in particular @xcite .",
    "recent observations with the hubble space telescope ( hst ) have shown that the cgm around star - forming galaxies is large ( @xmath7 kpc ) and the mass of the warm phase traced by exceeds that of the gas in the galaxies themselves @xcite .",
    "using other absorption lines , e.g. and in the uv @xcite found that there is a large reservoir of warm ionized gas around our galaxy as well .",
    "the hotter phase of the warm - hot gas , at temperatures @xmath8 can be probed by even more highly ionized metals .",
    "the dominant transitions from such ions lie in the soft - x - ray band and indeed , absorption lines due to and at redshift zero have been detected toward extragalactic sight - lines by the chandra x - ray observatory and the xmm - newton observatory @xcite .",
    "the distribution , spacial extent , and mass of the warm - hot gas provide important constraints to the models of large scale structure formations ( e.g. , @xcite ) and/or outflows / inflows from galaxies ( e.g. @xcite ) , but these parameters are difficult to measure in part due to the limited spectral resolution of and and in part because of the inherent difficulty in using the absorption line studies alone . here",
    "we use both absorption and emission observations to derive the physical properties of the warm - hot plasma .",
    "we show that the x - ray observations probe million degree gas , with low density , extending over @xmath9 kpc and having mass over ten billion solar masses .",
    "this is several times more than previously found in the cgm of the milky way .",
    "alternatively , the warm - hot gas we probe is from the extended lg medium .",
    "we search for and measure the absorption lines from highly ionized gas at @xmath10 , as seen in the spectra of most of the extragalactic sight - lines toward bright active galactic nuclei ( agns ) .",
    "we use high signal - to - noise ratio observations with high energy transmission grating ( hetg ) or low energy transmission grating ( letg ) with focus on and absorption lines at @xmath11and @xmath12  respectively .",
    "we began by selecting all the chandra grating observations of agns that were publicly available as of 2011 october 30 and that had exposure time of at least @xmath13 .",
    "this resulted in multiple observations of @xmath14 targets with both grating spectrometers aboard chandra ( hetg and letg ) .",
    "we reduced the data using the standard chandra interactive analysis of observations ( ciao ) software ( v4.3 ) and chandra calibration database ( caldb , v4.4.2 ) and followed the standard chandra data reduction threads . for the chandra acis / hetg and acis / letg observations , we co - added the negative and positive first - order spectra and built the effective area files ( arfs ) for each observations using the _ fullgarf _ ciao script .",
    "those pertaining to the acis / letg observations were corrected for the acis quantum efficiency degradation . unlike acis",
    ", the hrc does not have the energy resolution to sort individual orders , and each spectrum contains contributions from all the diffraction orders . for the hrc / letg observations we used the standard arf files for orders 1 through 6 and convolved it with the relevant standard redistribution matrix file ( rmf ) .",
    "for the targets with multiple observations , we added the grating spectra and averaged the associated arfs using the ciao script _",
    "add_grating_spectra _ , to increase the signal to noise ratio of the spectra .",
    "we only add the observations with the same instrumental configuration and the observations made with different instruments are analyzed separately .",
    "of the 50 sight lines initially selected , 29 have good enough signal - to - noise ratios ( s / n ) near @xmath15 to detect absorption lines .",
    "the strong k@xmath2 absorption lines near @xmath15 are clearly visible in 21 out of 29 sources with good signal - to - noise spectra ; thus the covering fraction of the systems is @xmath16 . in  30% of the sources significant k@xmath2 lines near @xmath17",
    "are also observed .",
    "here we consider a sub - sample of @xmath18 targets ( table 1 ) , where both and k@xmath2 local absorption has been confidently detected ( we have not included 3c273 in this sample of 29 sources because the @xmath1 absorption lines in this sight - line might be from a nearby supernova remnant ) .",
    "the detailed analysis of the complete sample will be presented in a forthcoming paper ( gupta et al .",
    "2012 , in preparation ) .",
    "the local ( @xmath10 ) and absorption lines in @xmath19 of our @xmath18 targets have been reported previously by other authors , but to ensure the consistency of data analysis , we reanalyzed all the data and obtained the fit results independently ; for the other five targets we present new detections of @xmath10 lines .",
    "the hetg and letg spectra are binned to @xmath20 and @xmath21 respectively and analyzed using the ciao fitting package _",
    "sherpa_. since we are interested in oxygen absorption lines we fit the spectral continuum in the @xmath22 range with a simple power law and a galactic absorbing column density ( n@xmath23 , from @xcite ) . for the targets",
    "mrk290 and ngc3783 we need to add a black - body component to account for the soft excess , that could come from a standard optically - thick accretion disk . in our sample ,",
    "the photon index of the power - law varies from @xmath24 with average value of @xmath25 .",
    "our targets are nearby type 1 agns , which have their own intrinsic absorption and emission features .",
    "we carefully study all the spectra to confirm that none of the agn intrinsic features contaminates the local ( @xmath1 ) absorption lines . except for one source , ngc4051 ,",
    "the intrinsic lines are sufficiently red - shifted that they do not contaminate the local and absorption lines . for this reason we do not include ngc4051 in our final sample .",
    "we then modeled all the statistically significant agn intrinsic absorption and emission features with gaussian components .",
    "after fitting the continuum and intrinsic features as described above , the local and k@xmath2 absorption lines are detected with @xmath26 and @xmath27 significance levels respectively . in 6 sources",
    ", we also detected the @xmath28 absorption line near @xmath29 .",
    "we fit these lines in _ sherpa _ with narrow gaussian features .",
    "since with chandra gratings ( @xmath30 for leg and @xmath31 for meg ) the lines are unresolved , we fix the line width to @xmath32 .",
    "errors are calculated using the _ projection _ command in _ sherpa _ , allowing the overall continuum normalization to vary along with all parameters for each line . for the observations with no detection of @xmath28",
    ", we fixed the line centroid at @xmath33 and obtained the upper limits on equivalent widths ( ew ) .",
    "the best - fit line equivalent widths ( ews ) and statistical uncertainties are given in table 2 and the spectra are shown in figure 1 .",
    "for optically thin gas the ionic column density depends simply on the observed equivalent width : @xmath34 , where @xmath35 is the ionic column density ( @xmath36 ) , @xmath37 is the equivalent width ( @xmath38 ) , @xmath39 is the oscillator strength of the transition , and @xmath40 is in @xmath38 .",
    "however , at the measured column densities of n ( ) , saturation could be an important issue as suggested by simulations @xcite and observational studies of mrk421 @xcite .",
    "therefore to correctly convert the measured equivalent widths to ionic column densities , we require knowledge of the doppler parameter _",
    "b _ ; at a fixed ew , column density decreases with increasing _",
    "b_. the low velocity resolution of gratings makes it unfeasible to directly measure the line width .",
    "if multiple absorption lines from the same ion are detected , the relative equivalent widths of these lines can instead be used to place limits on the column density n ( ) and the doppler parameter _ b _ of the medium .    to use this technique , we searched for and detected @xmath28 line at @xmath41  in 6 out of 8 targets and measured the upper limit for the remaining two . for , the expected @xmath42 ratio is @xmath43 .",
    "our observations indicate that most k@xmath2 lines are saturated ( table 2 ) . to place quantitative constraints on n ( ) and the _ b _ parameter we employ the technique described in details in @xcite . for a given absorption line with a measured equivalent width and known oscillator strength",
    "f _ value , the inferred column density as a function of the _ b _ parameter can be calculated using the relations from @xcite .",
    "the _ b _ and n ( ) can be determined for a range of doppler parameters for which both k@xmath2 and k@xmath3 transitions provide consistent n ( ) measurements .",
    "figure 2 shows such @xmath44 contours for the measured k@xmath2 and k@xmath3 transitions for ngc3783 . as the figure show , the @xmath44 constraints on doppler parameter _ b _ and column densities are @xmath45 and @xmath46logn()@xmath47 , respectively .",
    "for mrk421 and pks2155 - 304 we used the _",
    "b _ parameter values from @xcite .",
    "following the same method , we constrained the _ b _ parameter and column densities for all other observations .",
    "our measured column density toward mrk 421 is consistent with that in @xcite .",
    "the upper limit on the column density through the galactic halo by yao et al . is based on several assumption which , in our opinion , are faulty , but a detailed discussion is beyond the scope of this _ letter_. the column densities for our sample range from @xmath48()@xmath49 to @xmath50 @xmath51 , with a weighted mean value of @xmath48()@xmath52 @xmath51 .",
    "these values of n ( ) are higher than measured by other authors @xcite who assumed the lines to be unsaturated .",
    "column density ratios of different ions of the same element depend on the physical state of the medium and provide the rigorous constraints on the temperature of the absorbing medium .",
    "given that we detect both and , we place a tight constraint on the temperature @xmath53 , assuming the gas to be in collisional ionization equilibrium .    with the spectral resolution of current x - ray gratings it is difficult to resolve the absorption lines into galactic and local group components .",
    "however a comparison between emission and absorption measurements , provides us with a great tool to analyze the properties of the x - ray absorbers .",
    "the absorption lines measure the column density of gas @xmath54 , where @xmath55 is the mean molecular weight @xmath56 , @xmath57 is the electron density and @xmath58 is the path - length . the emission measure ,",
    "on the other hand , is sensitive to the square of the number density of the gas ( @xmath59 , assuming a constant density plasma ) .",
    "therefore a combination of absorption and emission measurements naturally provides constraints on the density and the path - length of the absorbing / emitting plasma .",
    "@xcite and @xcite using and data respectively , found that the galactic halo temperature is fairly constant across the sky @xmath60 , but the halo emission measure varies by an order of magnitude @xmath61 with an average of @xmath62 , assuming solar metallicity .",
    "other measurements of galactic halo emission @xcite also reported @xmath63 for solar metallicity , close to the average . thus using @xmath64",
    ", we solve for the path length and electron density of the absorbing gas . combining absorption and emission",
    "the density is :    @xmath65    and the path length :    @xmath66    where the solar oxygen abundance of @xmath67 is from @xcite , @xmath68 is the ionization fraction of and @xmath69 is the metallicity .",
    "newer values of oxygen abundance are even lower @xcite ; making @xmath70 larger . for the observed temperature of about @xmath0k , it is reasonable to expect @xmath71 ( see , e.g. , figure 4 in @xcite ) .",
    "cosmological simulations @xcite of formation and evolution of disk galaxies show that outside the galactic disk the mean metallicity of gas is @xmath72 .",
    "these values of metallicities are also consistent with observational results for the outskirts of groups @xcite and clusters of galaxies ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "thus it is highly unlikely that in the cgm metallicity is as high as @xmath73 . as such",
    ", @xmath74 sets a lower limit on the pathlength and an upper limit on the electron density .",
    "the @xmath44 limits on the pathlength and density are @xmath75 kpc and @xmath76 @xmath77 . for @xmath78 , which is far more likely ,",
    "the path - length becomes as large as @xmath79 kpc .",
    "we can also estimate the total baryonic mass traced by the absorbers , assuming a homogeneous spherically symmetric system :    @xmath80    for @xmath81 kpc and @xmath82 is the covering factor , @xmath83% for our entire sample .",
    "for the @xmath44 lower limit on the path - length ( @xmath84 kpc ) , the mass is @xmath85 . for the solar abundance used by @xcite @xmath86 , compared to @xmath87 found by @xcite in systems .",
    "thus we find that the /systems probe the reservoir of gas in the cgm extending to over 100 kpc .",
    "the mass probed by this warm - hot gas is larger that that in any other phase of the cgm and is comparable to the entire baryonic mass of the galactic disk @xmath88 @xcite .",
    "the baryonic fraction @xmath89 of this warm - hot gas varies from @xmath90 depending on the estimates of the virial mass of the milky way , from @xmath91 to @xmath92 ( @xcite and references therein ) , bracketing the universal value of @xmath93 .    the oxygen mass in the cgm as traced by /is",
    ":    @xmath94    and with the effective oxygen yi eld @xmath95 for a salpeter imf , the stellar mass needed to produce this amount of oxygen is @xmath96 , which is of the order of the disk+bulge stars .",
    "@xcite calculate all sky column density distributions for halos of three milky way - like disk galaxies , resulting from cosmological high - resolution n - body / gasdynamical simulations .",
    "these simulations predict the mean logn ( ) ranging from @xmath97@xmath98 , which is significantly lower than the average column density we find .",
    "our observations , however , are consistent with those of other such studies @xcite .",
    "we note that in the `` pure hot halo '' models of @xcite , the local group contribution is not included ; this might be a part of the reason for the discrepancy ( see section @xmath99 ) .",
    "our path - length and density measurements are in excellent agreement with the recent estimates of the distribution of hot @xmath100 circum - galactic gas , based on high resolution cosmological hydrodynamical simulations of @xcite .",
    "these simulations predict the presence of ionized circum - galactic gas with a density of @xmath101 out to 100 kpc and beyond .",
    "hydrodynamic simulations of cgm at @xmath102 by @xcite found that their simulated galaxies contain metal enriched warm - hot gas extending to approximately the virial radius ( @xmath103 ) . while their simulations do not track the or producing gas , it is of interest to note that the mass in the cgm is several times higher than the stellar mass of their simulated galaxies , similar to what we find .",
    "they argue that the missing baryons exist in the cgm .",
    "we have combined our measurements of the and column densities with the published values of emission measure ( em ) to derive physical conditions in the absorbing / emitting plasma , viz .",
    "temperature , density , path - length and mass .",
    "the constraint on the temperature is robust ; it depends simply on the to column density ratio , under the assumption of collisional ionization equilibrium . for our measured density of a few times @xmath104 , which is several thousand times larger than the mean density of the universe ( @xmath105 )",
    ", photoionization becomes unimportant and collisional ionization is a reasonable assumption .",
    "we have assumed that the absorbing / emitting plasma is of uniform density ; this need not be the case .",
    "the distribution of warm - hot gas around several galaxies follows a beta - model profile in which the density is high in the center and falls off with radius ( see @xcite and references therein ) ; gas in clusters and groups of galaxies also follows similar profile . in any case , if the gas is not of uniform density , the ew would be weighted by the denser gas and for the same observed column density the average density would be smaller and the inferred path - length would be larger extending into the lg medium .",
    "we can not rule out the possibility that the warm - hot gas we trace is from the lg medium instead .",
    "we note , however , that in the simulations of @xcite , the density is roughly constant above the galactic disk out to about 100 kpc .",
    "as noted above , our sample is made of sight - lines in which both and k@xmath2 absorption lines at @xmath1 are securely detected .",
    "does this mean that our sample is biased toward high column density systems ?",
    "if so , the path - length and the mass of the warm - hot plasma could be severely over - estimated . in figure 3",
    "we have plotted the ew distribution of line in all 29 sources in the parent sample .",
    "the sub - sample of 8 sources is marked by the red shaded region ; it is clear that this sub - sample is _ not _ biased toward high ew systems .",
    "the high ew systems are not in the sub - sample of this paper because they do not have clean detections of lines , in large part because of the contamination from intrinsic absorption .",
    "it is also worth noting that the upper limits on the ews in targets with non - detections of k@xmath2 line is higher than the average of the parent sample in all but one cases .",
    "all together , we argue that the average ew of our sub - sample is a fair representation of the large sample and that our sample is _ not _ biased toward high column density systems .",
    "for reasonable values of parameters and with reasonable assumptions , the observations of and absorption lines at @xmath1 imply that there is a huge reservoir of ionized gas around the milky way",
    ". it may be in the halo of of the milky way or in the surrounding local group . either way , its mass appears to be very large .",
