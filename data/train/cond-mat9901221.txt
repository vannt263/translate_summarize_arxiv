    "if the bulk band structure projected onto the surface presents an energy gap near the vacuum level , an electron located in front of the surface can not propagate into the solid .",

    "later on , the decay of the first image state on the ( 111 ) surfaces of copper and nickel metals to the @xmath0 crystal - induced surface state was calculated@xcite , in terms of auger transitions , with the use of a three band model to describe the surface band structure . in ref . , hydrogenic - like states with no penetration into the solid were used to describe the image - state wave functions , a simplified parametrised form was used for the surface - state wave functions , and screening effects were neglected .",

    "the more realistic result of @xmath80 for the total linewidth is in good agreement with the experimentally measured lifetime@xcite of @xmath82 at @xmath83@xcite . within the vacuum side of the surface",
    "the @xmath1 image state couples dominantly to the @xmath0 surface state ( this coupling approximately represents a @xmath84 of the total @xmath63 linewidth ) ; however , the coupling of image states with all bulk crystal states occurring through the bulk penetration plays an important role and can not , therefore , be neglected if one is to accurately describe the lifetime of image states .",
    "we note that simplified jellium models for the evaluation of the screened interaction lead to unrealistic results for the contribution of the surface state to the linewidth of image states@xcite .",
    "first , we compare our full rpa calculations ( see table i ) with the results we obtain , also with use of our model initial and final wave functions ( mwf ) , when our realistic screened interaction is replaced by that obtained within the specular reflection model ( srm ) and the model of persson and zaremba ( pz ) .",
    "bulk contributions to the linewidth are approximately well described within the specular reflection model , small differences resulting from an approximate description , within this model , of the so - called _ begrenzung _ effects .",
    "as the approximate treatment of ritchie and marusak@xcite ignores the quantum mechanical details of the surface , this model fails to describe both vacuum and interference contributions to the linewidth .",
    "these quantum mechanical details of the surface are approximately taken into account within the jellium model of ref .",
    ", thus resulting in a better approximation for the vacuum contribution to the linewidth .",
    "discrepancies between vacuum contributions obtained within this model ( pz ) and our more realistic full rpa calculations@xcite appear as a result of the jellium model of ref . being accurate provided @xmath85 and @xmath86 ( @xmath87 is the fermi momentum , i.e. , @xmath88 ) .",
    "in order to investigate the dependence of @xmath89 on the details of both @xmath1 and @xmath0 wave functions , we present in table i calculations , within srm and pz models for the screened interaction , in which our realistic wave functions are replaced by the simplified models ( awf ) described in the previous section .",
    "as the hydrogenic - like wave function used to describe the @xmath1 image state on the vacuum side of the surface presents an image - state charge gravity center localized further away from the surface than our more realistic model wave function , both vacuum and interference contributions to the linewidth are largely underestimated within this approximation .",
    "furthermore , we note that the linewidth is highly sensitive to the details of the image - state wave functions .",
    "this is a consequence of the critical behavior of the imaginary part of the non - local self - energy coupling points near the surface , as we will discuss below .",
    "now we focus on our full rpa calculation of the total linewidth of the @xmath1 image state on cu(111 ) ( see table ii ) , with all effective masses set equal to the free - electron mass .",
    "we show in fig .",
    "[ band]b separate contributions to the linewidth , @xmath71 , coming from the decay into the various @xmath90 bulk crystal states , @xmath91 , such that @xmath92 fig .",
    "[ band]a exhibits the bulk band structure projected onto the ( 111 ) surface of copper .",
    "the arrows indicate the available phase space in the decay of the @xmath1 image state at the @xmath93 point ( @xmath61=0 ) into the unoccupied portion of the @xmath0 surface state and a generic @xmath90 bulk state , which are represented by their characteristic @xmath94 and @xmath95 parabolic dispersions , respectively .",
    "@xmath63 , @xmath64 and @xmath96 contributions to @xmath91 are represented , together with the total contribution , @xmath91 , as a function of @xmath97 .",
    "the lower edge , at the @xmath93 point , of the energy gap projected onto the cu(111 ) surface lies below the fermi level ( @xmath98 ) and , consequently , the decay from the ( @xmath99 ) image state occurs through finite parallel momentum transfer . hence , as the coupling of the image state with the crystal occurring through the tails of bulk states outside the crystal is expected to be dominated by vertical transitions ( @xmath100 ) , vacuum contributions to the @xmath91 linewidth are very small , especially for those bulk states located at the bottom of the valence band ( decay into these states is only allowed for large values of the momentum transfer ; also , their vacuum penetration is small ) . actually , the coupling of the @xmath1 image state with all bulk states taking place at the vacuum side results in a linewidth of only @xmath101 mev , which approximately represents a @xmath102 of the total @xmath63 linewidth @xcite .",
    "a realistic description of motion along the surface can be approximated by introduction of the effective mass , as described above .",
    "the effective mass of all final states with energies @xmath72 , @xmath103 , is found to be smaller than the free - electron mass , thus both @xmath78 and @xmath71 being about @xmath13 smaller than in the case of free - electron behavior along the surface ( see tables i and ii ) .",
    "this is the result of two competing effects : first , there is the effect of the decrease of the available phase space , which is easily found to scale as @xmath104 .",
    "secondly , as the effective mass decreases the decay from the image state occurs , for a given energy transfer , through smaller parallel momentum transfer , which may result in both enlarged and diminished screened interactions , depending on momentum and energy transfers .",
    "this is illustrated in fig .",
    "3 , where the impact of the introduction of the effective mass on the evaluation of the various contributions ( vacuum , bulk , and interference ) to both @xmath91 and @xmath78 ( see eq . ( 9 ) ) is exhibited through the percentage ratio @xmath105 as a function of the final state energy @xmath97 .",
    "if the screened interaction were independent of the parallel momentum transfer , all ratios would scale as @xmath104 , which is represented in fig . 3 as @xmath106 .",
    "instead , as the parallel momentum transfer decreases the screened interaction is predominantly larger , which results in the ratio @xmath107 to be larger than @xmath108 , especially in the case of vacuum contributions to the linewidth which are expected to be dominated by vertical transitions .",
    "when the decay from the image state may occur through very small parallel momentum transfer @xmath109 , [ this is the case of final states that are just below the bottom of the gap and also the case of the @xmath0 surface state ] , a decrease in @xmath109 may result in a diminished screened interaction ( see fig .",
    "4 ) , thus @xmath107 being slightly smaller than @xmath108 for these states .    now",
    ", we analyze the behavior of the imaginary part of the image - electron self - energy , which results in vacuum and interference contributions to the linewidth to be comparable in magnitude and opposite in sign ( see table [ ttb1 ] ) .",
    "[ self ] shows full rpa ( solid line ) and srm ( dashed - dotted line ) calculations of @xmath110 ( see eq .",
    "( [ sigmas ] ) ) for cu(111 ) with all effective masses set equal to the free - electron mass , together with the @xmath1 image - state wave function , as a function of the @xmath111-coordinate and for @xmath112 .",
    "we note that the probability for electron - hole pair creation ( the dominant channel for the decay of these states is provided by this process ) is underestimated within the srm .",
    "the coupling between electronic states is well known to be maximum , within the bulk , at the position of the electron . nevertheless , as the electron moves into the vacuum the maximum of the imaginary part of the electron self - energy stays ( see fig . [ self ] ) near the surface ( @xmath34 ) , as demonstrated , within a jellium model of the surface , by deisz _",
    "et al_@xcite . hence , for any given value of @xmath35 , main vacuum and interference contributions to the linewidth are determined ( see eq .",
    "( [ gamma1 ] ) ) by the specific shape of the image - state wave function in regions @xmath113 and @xmath114 of fig .",
    "[ self ] . as the image - state on cu(111 ) is located right at the top of the energy gap and the corresponding wave function has , therefore , a node at the surface ( @xmath115 ) , an inspection of fig .",
    "[ self ] leads us to the conclusion that vacuum and interference contributions to the linewidth are comparable in magnitude and opposite in sign . on cu(100 )",
    "the image state is located close to the center of the gap , and the corresponding wave function has a node at @xmath116 a.u . on this surface ,",
    "total vacuum and interference contributions to the linewidth are still opposite in sign , though interference contributions coming from the decay into states at the bottom of the valence band are now positive due to their minor vacuum penetration .",
    "if the image state were located at the bottom of the gap , matching at the surface would occur at maximum amplitude and the total interference contribution might be positive , as the sign of the image - state wave function would be the same on both sides just around the surface ( @xmath34 ) .",
    "finally , we investigate the dependence of interband@xcite linewidths on the momentum of the image electron parallel to the surface , @xmath14 .",
    "first , we use the mwf image state wave function evaluated at the @xmath57 point and introduce , within this model , the dependence on @xmath14 of the quasiparticle self - energy , as indicated in eq .",
    "we find that for image state total energies lying below the top of the gap ( @xmath117 ) , the linewidth of the first image state of cu(111 ) increases less than @xmath8 .",
    "secondly , we also account for the change of the @xmath4-dependent initial wave function along the dispersion curve of the image state , by solving the schrdinger equation for a one - dimensional model potential that we build following ref . with various values of @xmath118 : @xmath119 , @xmath120 , and @xmath121 .",
    "the penetration into the bulk of the @xmath1 image state with these values of @xmath118 is found to vary from @xmath59 at @xmath122 to @xmath123 , @xmath124 and @xmath125 at @xmath126 a.u .",
    ", @xmath120 a.u . and @xmath127 a.u .",
    ", respectively . our results , as obtained with all effective masses set equal to the free - electron mass , are presented in table iii . though the penetration of the image state wave function increases with @xmath118 , the amplitude of this wave function on the bulk side and near the jellium edge decreases , thus the absolute value of both bulk and interference contributions to the linewidth decreasing with @xmath118",
    "nevertheless , the total overlap between image state and final wave functions becomes more efficient as @xmath118 increases , which results in larger values of the total linewidth .",
    "also , it is interesting to notice that especially sensitive to the variation of the momentum of the image state parallel to the surface is the contribution to the linewidth from damping into the @xmath0 surface state .",
    "we have reported calculations of the inelastic broadening of the first image state at the ( 111 ) surface of copper , and we have investigated , in particular , the role that the intrinsic crystal - induced surface state plays in the decay of this image state .",
    "we have presented self - consistent rpa calculations , by going beyond a free - electron description of the metal surface .",
    "we have also considered simplified models for both the electron wave functions and the screened coulomb interaction , showing that a detailed description of these quantities is of crucial importance in the understanding of the origin of linewidths of image states .",
    "we have accounted for potential variation parallel to the surface through the introduction of the effective mass .",
    "we have analyzed the origin and magnitude of the various contributions to the linewidth .",
    "though the dominant contribution to the decay of the first image state into the crystal - induced surface state comes from the coupling between image and surface states within the vacuum part of the surface , it appears to be approximately canceled out by the contribution from the interference between bulk and vacuum coordinates .",
    "for the vacuum contribution to the decaying rate into the intrinsic surface state , we have found that it approximately represents a @xmath84 of the total vacuum contribution .",
    "we also conclude that the coupling of image states with all bulk crystal states occurring through the bulk penetration plays an important role in the determination of lifetimes , and that this penetration can not be neglected if one is to accurately describe the lifetime of image states .",
    "we have found , within our full rpa scheme , that in the case of @xmath128 the decaying rate of the first image state on cu(111 ) into the intrinsic surface state results , with all effective masses set equal to the free - electron mass , in a linewidth of @xmath76 mev , while use of more realistic effective masses leads to a linewidth of @xmath77 . with the use of either the free - electron mass or more realistic effective masses for both bulk and crystal - induced surface states ,",
    "@xmath78 approximately represents a @xmath2 of the total linewidth , @xmath79 ( @xmath75 ) or @xmath129 ( @xmath81 ) .",
    "the more realistic result of @xmath80 for the total linewidth is in good agreement with recent experimental results reported in ref ..    we have investigated the dependence of interband linewidths on the momentum of the image electron parallel to the surface , showing that for image state total energies lying below the top of the gap the linewidth of the first image state increases with @xmath118 up to a @xmath13 .",
    "we conclude that this increase appears mainly as a consequence of the change of the @xmath4-dependent initial wave function with @xmath118 , and our results indicate that the contribution to the linewidth from damping into the @xmath0 surface state is responsible for the dependence of the total linewidth with the momentum parallel to the surface .",
