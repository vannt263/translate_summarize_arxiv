    "grbner bases are the most widely applicable computational tool available in the context of commutative algebra and algebraic geometry .",
    "however they also are an important theoretical tool , as they can be used to establish properties such as , e.g. , primality , normality , cohen - macaulayness , and to give formulas for the height of an ideal .",
    "liaison theory , or linkage , on the other hand , is mostly regarded as a classification tool .",
    "in fact , much effort has been devoted in recent years to the study of liaison classes , in particular to deciding which ideals belong to the g - liaison class of a complete intersection . however , a clear understanding of the liaison pattern of an ideal often allows us to recursively compute invariants such as its hilbert function and graded betti numbers .    in this paper",
    "we introduce liaison - theoretic methods as a tool in the theory of grbner bases .",
    "more precisely , we deduce that a certain set @xmath0 of polynomials is a grbner basis for the ideal @xmath1 that it generates by understanding the linkage pattern of the ideal @xmath1 and of the monomial ideal generated by the initial terms of the elements of @xmath0 .",
    "concretely , we apply this reasoning to ideals generated by minors or pfaffians , whose liaison pattern we understand .",
    "ideals generated by minors or pfaffians have been studied extensively by both commutative algebraists and algebraic geometers .",
    "the study of determinantal rings and varieties is an active area of research per se , but it has also been instrumental to the development of new techniques , which have become part of the commonly used tools in commutative algebra .",
    "ideals generated by minors and pfaffians are studied in invariant theory and combinatorics , and are relevant in algebraic geometry . in fact ,",
    "many classical varieties such as the veronese and the segre varieties are cut out by minors or pfaffians .",
    "degeneracy loci of morphisms between direct sums of line bundles over projective space have a determinantal description , as do schubert varieties , fitting schemes , and some toric varieties .",
    "ideals generated by minors or pfaffians are often investigated by commutative algebraists by means of grbner basis techniques ( see , e.g. , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) . using such tools , many families of ideals generated by minors or pfaffians have been shown to enjoy properties such as primality , normality , and cohen - macaulayness .",
    "a different approach to the study of ideals generated by minors is via flags and degeneracy loci , and was initiated in  @xcite .",
    "such an approach allows one to establish that these ideals are normal , cohen - macaulay and have rational singularities ( see , e.g. , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .    in recent years",
    ", much progress has been made towards understanding determinantal ideals and varieties also from the point of view of liaison theory .",
    "a central open question in liaison theory asks whether every arithmetically cohen - macaulay scheme is glicci , i.e. , whether it belongs to the g - liaison class of a complete intersection . in  @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and  @xcite ,",
    "several families of ideals generated by minors or pfaffians are shown to be glicci .",
    "more precisely , it is shown that they can be obtained from an ideal generated by linear forms via a sequence of ascending elementary g - biliaisons . moreover , each of the elementary g - biliaisons takes place between two ideals which both belong to the family in question .",
    "since the linkage steps are described very explicitly , in theory it is possible to use the linkage results to recursively compute invariants or establish properties of these ideals .",
    "this has been done , e.g. , in  @xcite using the linkage results from  @xcite .    rather than contributing to the theory of liaison ( see for instance  @xcite ) , in this paper we give a new method of using liaison as a tool .",
    "more precisely , we consider large families of ideals generated by minors or pfaffians in a matrix or a ladder , namely pfaffian ideals of ladders , mixed determinantal , and symmetric mixed determinantal ideals . combining the liaison results from  @xcite , @xcite , and  @xcite with a hilbert function computation , we are able to prove that the pfaffians or the minors are a reduced grbner basis for the ideal that they generate , with respect to any anti - diagonal or diagonal term - order . moreover ,",
    "we show the simplicial complex corresponding to the initial ideal of any ideal in the family that we consider is vertex decomposable .",
    "vertex decomposability is a strong property , which in particular implies shellability of the complex and cohen - macaulayness of the associated initial ideal .    in section  [ mainlemma ] ,",
    "we prove a lemma which will be central to the subsequent arguments ( lemma  [ inid ] ) .",
    "the lemma gives a sufficient criterion for a monomial ideal to be the initial ideal of a given ideal @xmath2 .",
    "both the ideal @xmath2 and the `` candidate '' initial ideal are constructed via basic double linkage or elementary biliaison . in section  [ ex_sect ]",
    "we use lemma  [ inid ] to prove that the maximal minors of a matrix of indeterminates are a grbner basis of the ideal that they generate with respect to any diagonal ( or anti - diagonal ) term - order .",
    "although the result is well - known , we wish to illustrate our method by showing how it applies to this simple example . in sections",
    "[ pfaff_sect ] , [ symm_sect ] , and [ ladd_sect ] , we apply our technique to ideals generated by : pfaffians of mixed size in a ladder of a skew - symmetric matrix of indeterminates , minors of mixed size in a ladder of a symmetric matrix of indeterminates , and minors of mixed size in a ladder of a matrix of indeterminates .",
    "we prove that the natural generators of these ideals are a grbner basis with respect to any diagonal ( in the case of minors of a symmetric matrix ) or anti - diagonal ( in the case of pfaffians or minors in a generic matrix ) term - order .",
    "we also prove that the corresponding initial ideals are cohen - macaulay , and that the associated simplicial complexes are vertex decomposable .",
    "while sections  [ mainlemma ] and  [ ex_sect ] are meant to be read first , sections  [ pfaff_sect ] , [ symm_sect ] , and  [ ladd_sect ] can be read independently of each other , and in any order . in the appendix , we indicate how our liaison - theoretic approach can be made self - contained in order to derive also all the classical grbner basis results about ladder determinantal ideals from one - sided ladders .",

    "our criterion depends on the linkage pattern of the ideal @xmath1 and of the monomial ideal generated by the initial terms of the elements of @xmath0 .    in order to use geometric language",
