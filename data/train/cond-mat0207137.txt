    "driven interfaces in quenched disordered systems display with increasing driving force a transition from a pinned interface to a moving interface  ( see e.g.  @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "this so - called depinning transition is caused by a competition of the driving force and the quenched disorder .",
    "the first one tends to move the interface whereas the latter one hinders the movement .",
    "depinning transitions are observed in a large variety of physical problems , such as fluid invasion in porous materials ( see , for instance , sec .  6.2 in @xcite and references therein ) , depinning of charge density waves  @xcite , impurity pinning of flux - line in type - ii superconductors  @xcite , contact lines  @xcite as well as in field driven ferromagnets , where the interface separates regions of opposite magnetizations  @xcite .",
    "a well established model to investigate the depinning transition in disordered ferromagnets is the driven random - field ising model ( rfim )  ( see for instance  @xcite ) .",
    "here , the disorder induces some effective energy barriers which suppress the interface motion . a magnetic driving field  @xmath0 reduces these energy barriers but they vanish only if the driving field exceeds the critical value @xmath1 .",
    "the transition from the pinned to the moving interface can be described as a continuous phase transition and its velocity  @xmath2 is interpreted as the order parameter . without thermal fluctuations ( @xmath3 )",
    "the field dependence of the velocity obeys the power - law behavior @xmath4 for @xmath5 , where @xmath6 denotes the reduced driving field @xmath7 .",
    "the depinning transition is destroyed in the presence of thermal fluctuations ( @xmath8 ) which may provide the energy needed to overcome local energy barriers .",
    "although thermal fluctuations drive the system away from criticality the order parameter obeys certain scaling laws and for sufficiently low temperatures the order parameter can be described as a generalized homogenous function  @xcite @xmath9 similar to usual equilibrium second order phase transitions . setting @xmath10",
    "one recovers eq.([eq : v_h_01 ] ) for zero temperature . choosing @xmath11 one gets for the interface velocity at the critical field  @xmath1",
    "@xmath12 this power - law behavior was observed in two- and three - dimensional simulations of the driven rfim  @xcite as well as in charge density waves in computer simulations and mean - field calculations  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , thermal fluctuations cause a creep motion of the interface for small driving fields ( @xmath13 ) characterized by an arrhenius like behavior of the velocity @xcite . recently",
    ", this creep motion was observed in experiments considering magnetic domain wall motion in thin films composed of co and pt layers  @xcite , in renormalization group calculations  @xcite regarding the edwards - wilkinson equation with quenched disorder ( qew ) , as well as in numerical simulations of the rfim  @xcite .    in equilibrium physics",
    "a scaling ansatz according to  eq.([eq : v_scal_01 ] ) usually describes the order parameter as a function of its control parameter and of its conjugated field .",
    "although eq.([eq : v_scal_01 ] ) can be applied to the depinning transition , i.e. the temperature is a relevant scaling field ,  @xmath14 is not conjugated to the order parameter .",
    "the conjugated field would support the interface motion independent of its strength .",
    "but strong thermal fluctuations destroy the interface instead to support the interface motion .",
    "therefore , one has to interpret the value of the thermal exponent  @xmath15 carefully .",
    "for instance , it is not clear wether the obtained values of  @xmath15 are a characteristic feature of the whole universality class of the depinning transition or just a characteristic feature of the particular considered rfim .",
    "this point could be important for the interpretation of experiments which naturally take place at finite temperatures .",
    "in this paper we reinvestigate the interface dynamics of the driven rfim and focus our attention to higher dimensions @xmath16 .",
    "in particular we consider the scaling behavior at the critical point and determine the exponents @xmath17 and @xmath15 .",
    "our results suggest that the so - called upper critical dimension of the depinning transition of the driven rfim is @xmath18 . above this dimension",
    "the scaling behavior is characterized by the mean - field exponents .",
    "we compare our results with those obtained from a renormalization group approach of the quenched edward - wilkinson equation which is expected to be in the same universality class as the driven rfim .",
    "a summary is given at the end .",
    "we consider the depinning transition rfim on cubic lattices of linear size @xmath19 in higher dimensions ( @xmath16 ) .",
    "the hamiltonian of the rfim is given by @xmath20 where the first term characterizes the exchange interaction of neighboring spins ( @xmath21 ) .",
    "the sum is taken over all pairs of neighbored spins .",
    "the spins are coupled to a homogenous driving field @xmath0 as well as to a quenched random - field @xmath22 with @xmath23 and @xmath24 .",
    "the random field is assumed to be uniformly distributed , i.e. , the probability @xmath25 that the random field at site  @xmath26 takes some value @xmath22 is given by @xmath27 using antiperiodic boundary conditions an interface is induced into the system which can be driven by the field @xmath0 ( see  @xcite for details ) .",
    "a glauber dynamics with random sequential update and heat - bath transition probabilities is applied to simulate the interface motion ( see for instance  @xcite ) .    due to this algorithm not only spins adjacent to the interface but throughout the whole system can flip with a finite probability at temperatures @xmath8 . in general , this may cause nucleation which always starts with an isolated spin - flip .",
    "the minimum energy required for an isolated spin - flip is @xmath28 with @xmath29 nearest neighbors on a bcc lattice .",
    "although the corresponding spin - flip probability @xmath30 $ ] is small for the considered temperatures ( @xmath31 ) , isolated spin - flips are possible and occur .",
    "but we observed that these spin - flips are unstable in our simulations , i.e. , an isolated spin will flip back in the next update step .",
    "thus the originally induced interfaces is stable during the simulations .",
    "the moving interface corresponds to a magnetization  @xmath32 which increases in time  @xmath33 ( given in monte carlo step per spin ) .",
    "the interface velocity , which is the basic quantity in our investigations , is obtained from the time dependence of the magnetization @xmath34 where @xmath35 denotes an appropriate disorder average . starting with a flat interface we performed a sufficiently number of updates until the system reaches after a transient regime the steady state which is characterized by a constant average interface velocity .     for @xmath36 , @xmath37 , and @xmath38 in @xmath39 .",
    "in order to show the details we stretched the interface in the vertical direction by a factor 15 . , width=325 ]    as pointed out in previous works  @xcite an appropriate choice of the interface orientation is needed in order to recover that the interface moves for arbitrarily small driving field in the absence of disorder .",
    "an appropriate choice is to consider the interface motion along the diagonal direction of a simple cubic lattice . for @xmath16",
    "an alternative is to examine the interface motion along the @xmath40-axis on a body - centered cubic ( bcc ) lattice . since it is much more convenient to implement the latter case in higher dimensions we consider in this work bcc lattices , the more as the lattice structure usually does not affect the universal scaling behavior .",
