    "with the benefit of hindsight it can be argued that even the second gravitational lens discovered , pg1115 + 080 ( weymann et al .",
    "1980 ) , foreshadowed what has turned into an embarrassment of riches  a superabundance of quadruply imaged quasars .",
    "but only with the advent of systematic lens surveys ( king and browne 1996 ; rusin and tegmark 2001 ) has it become clear that the high ratio of quadruple to double systems is not an artifact of observational selection and therefore presents a genuine challenge to our understanding of lensing of galaxies .",
    "furthermore , individual fits on a system - by - system basis often require large amplitude ( 0.1 - 0.3 ) external shear @xcite , significantly higher than values of 0.02 - 0.05 expected ( keeton , kochanek and seljak 1997 ; henceforth kks ) from large scale structure or nearby galaxies .",
    "there are three factors that will probably have some part to play in the ultimate resolution of these problems : galaxy ellipticities , shear due to random superpositions of mass along the line of sight , and shear due to structures that are associated with the lens galaxy . in this paper",
    "we concentrate on the shear from associated structures .    the relative importance of tides and ellipticity has been considered by kks . in computing the expected tidal shear",
    "they consider three contributions : a ) random shear due to unassociated foreground and background structure , b ) the effect of associated galaxies , through the two point correlation function , and c ) the effect of clusters of galaxies , with a term proportional to the number density of clusters .    in the present paper",
    "we take a different tack to estimate the expected tidal shear due to nearby structures .",
    "we use the gif project recipe ( kauffmann et al .",
    "1999 ) for galaxy formation within a cold dark matter ( cdm ) simulation to compute the shear expected along random lines of sight , in the directions of galaxies , and specifically in the directions of early - type galaxies , which appear to be the predominant type of lens galaxy . in this way , the effects of correlated structure are naturally included , without artificial distinctions between different types of structures , and we can also include the clustering properties of different types of galaxies . this is similar to recent work by @xcite , where a high resolution hydrodynamical simulation was used to find typical values of external shear at the positions of typical galaxies , rather than specifically at the positions of massive early - type galaxies .    in   2 we outline our methods for using the gif simulations to estimate the effects of correlated structure on the statistics of external shear in gravitational lens systems . in ",
    "3 we describe two selection effects which will further increase the typical external shear measured in quadruple gravitational lens systems ; high shear systems have a larger cross - section for quadruple lensing ( which is partly offset by `` magnification bias '' ) and regions of high external shear are likely to be regions of higher convergence , due to large scale structure .",
    "we finish with a discussion of the consequences of our calculations for various problems associated with quadruply imaged systems .",
    "studies of cosmic shear have noted _ rms _ shear of a few percent @xcite from studies of weak distortions of background galaxies .",
    "this result can not be directly applied to estimates of typical shear values for lens systems because a strong gravitational lens is not at a random position in the sky but is instead at the position of a fairly massive galaxy , typically an early - type ( elliptical or s0 ) galaxy @xcite .",
    "such galaxies are known to be located preferentially in overdense regions , where it would also be expected that the typical shear would be higher .    to estimate the effects of large scale structure that is correlated with the lens galaxies , we used the publicly available simulations from the gif project .",
    "the simulations provide the dark matter distribution as well as estimates of the positions , velocities , luminosities and colors of galaxies @xcite .",
    "the galaxy information is derived from a semi - analytic model of galaxy formation .",
    "the simulation box was 141.3 @xmath1mpc ( comoving ) on a side , the 256@xmath2 particles each had a mass of 1.4@xmath3 , the gravitational softening length was @xmath4kpc , and the cosmological model was a flat universe with @xmath5 .",
    "we made projected mass maps of the outputs at @xmath6 at a resolution of 50 @xmath1kpc and used these maps to generate shear maps , assuming a source at @xmath7 .",
    "the critical surface density for lensing for our assumed cosmology is approximately 2800@xmath8 . at this redshift",
    "the box size corresponds to @xmath9 and our comoving 50 @xmath1kpc resolution element corresponds to an approximate angular size of @xmath10 , much larger than the typical einstein radius of a galaxy ( @xmath11 ) .",
    "the relation between convergence ( mass surface density in units of the critical surface density ) and shear are algebraic in fourier space ( e.g. , kaiser and squires 1993 ) , so we used an fft method to generate shear maps from convergence maps .",
    "the fourier transforms of the convergence map , @xmath12 , and the two shear components , @xmath13 , are simply related : @xmath14 where a tilde denotes a quantity in the fourier domain and @xmath15 and @xmath16 are fourier space variables ( i.e. , wavenumbers ) . after making the convergence map from the particle data of the n - body simulation , the map was fourier transformed ,",
    "the algebraic operations were performed to construct the shear components in the fourier domain and the fourier shear maps were inverse transformed to produce shear image maps .    with the gif catalog , we measured the shear at all positions that were marked as having massive early - type galaxies .",
    "our criteria for being a massive early - type galaxy were @xmath17 and @xmath18 .",
    "we also measured the shear at the position of all galaxies in the gif catalog , as well as at a comparable number of random points in the map .",
    "the measured shear at random points , shown in figure 1 , was typically less than 1% , as would be expected from a box with redshift extent of approximately @xmath9 .",
    "the few percent cosmic shear is built up from having many volumes of this extent along the line of sight .",
    "typical shear values around galaxies were noticeably higher , while the mean shear at the position of bright early - type galaxies was yet    0.1 in    higher , 0.058 , with an rms shear of 0.071 and an extensive tail past @xmath19 . the probability of shear greater than 0.1 is 0.16 .",
    "this is a consequence of early - type galaxies being preferentially found in or near clusters of galaxies .",
    "previous estimates ( e.g. , kks ) took into account that galaxies were correlated with other galaxies in estimating external tidal effects , but ignored the preferential location of lenses inside larger structures in estimating the contribution from large scale structure .",
    "this is an important consideration for two reasons .",
    "more massive galaxies , which have a higher cross - section for producing gravitational lens systems , are strongly correlated with large scale structure .",
    "furthermore , early - type galaxies are even more highly correlated with large scale structure than late - type galaxies .    thus we see that the material correlated with the lens galaxies can contribute a significant amount of shear .",
    "the results presented here are probably an underestimate of the likelihood of high shear events , as the finite box size results in missing long - wavelength power .",
    "other material along the line of sight will be much less correlated , but will add a significant amount of _ rms _ shear ( kks find typically @xmath20 for this cosmological model ) .",
    "the typical shear at the position of a massive early - type galaxy is therefore likely larger than @xmath21 .",
    "note that this is applicable to all gravitational lens systems ( and early - type galaxies in general ) and that we have not introduced any distinctions between two - image and four - image systems .    in making the maps smoothing was done on a scale of approximately 50 @xmath1kpc , reducing the effects of nearby galaxies .",
    "there is a trend in our results for increasing shear with increasing resolution , suggesting a non - negligible amount of shear from near neighbors , as also suggested by @xcite ; with a smoothing length of 200 @xmath1kpc the mean shear at the position of early - type galaxies drops to 0.03 .",
    "the larger smoothing primarily reduces the probability of high shear values , perhaps suggesting that higher resolution would lead to an even larger probability of high shear . in the case of the gravitational lens system b1422 + 231",
    "@xcite it appears that most of the shear ( @xmath22 in this case ) does in fact come from neighbors closer than 50 @xmath1kpc .",
    "when all particles within a spherical radius of 50 @xmath1kpc ( comoving ) from the centers of early - type galaxies were removed before creating the initial mass map the statistics were nearly unchanged ; for example the mean shear decreased by only 0.003 .",
    "when this radius of excision was doubled the mean shear was reduced to 0.045 , a fractional reduction of more than 20% .",
    "this agrees with both the above discussion on smoothing and the work of @xcite , and points to the importance of substructure that is associated with the lens galaxy but in the outer regions of the dark matter halo .",
    "the previous section demonstrated that not all positions on the sky are equally likely to host a bright early - type galaxy ; it is also true that not all positions on the sky hosting bright early - type galaxies are equally likely to host a quadruple gravitational lens system .",
    "the cross - section for quadruple lensing by a galaxy can be enhanced by external shear , while the magnification statistics are affected by both external shear and convergence from large scale structure .",
    "a bright early - type galaxy in a region of high shear and high convergence has a higher probability of being observed to be a quadruple gravitational lens .    in this section ,",
    "we calculate the relative number of quadruple images expected in samples , taking into account three effects : 1 ) cross - section for quadruple lensing increases with increasing shear ; 2 ) magnification for quadruple systems decreases with increasing shear ; 3 ) magnification increases with increasing convergence .",
    "the cross - section for producing a quadruple lens is simply the solid angle subtended by the part of the source plane that is able to produce four observable images ( and a fifth highly demagnified , thus very difficult to observe , image ) for a given lens position ; i.e. , the cross - section is the area inside the `` diamond caustic . '' for a singular isothermal sphere ( sis ) lens model in the presence of external shear , the cross - section for producing a quadruply imaged system scales as @xmath23@xcite .",
    "the probability of an object producing four images therefore scales roughly as @xmath24 , increasing the probability of galaxies in the presence of high external shear being in a catalog of observed lenses .",
    "the magnification is important through the effects of `` magnification bias '' @xcite .",
    "the number of quasars increases toward lower unmagnified flux ; high magnification increases the possible number of observable sources .",
    "the effects of magnification bias are often in the opposite direction of the change in cross - section . calculation of the expected number of lens systems requires the number of sources per unit sky area ( in the source plane ) that could be sufficiently magnified to enter the sample .",
    "the number of sources per _ source plane _ solid angle expected above a given observed flux limit @xmath25 , in a region of magnification @xmath26 , and assuming a power - law unmagnified flux distribution @xmath27 is @xmath28 employing a change of variable , this reduces to simply @xmath29 times the number per source plane solid angle expected in the absence of magnification . for a single lens system",
    ", there is a distribution of magnifications in the source plane , so the factor by which magnification increases the number of observable quasars is then @xmath30 , where the average is over the source - plane distribution of magnifications . for the special case of @xmath31 , close to the observed value @xcite , the factor by which the number of observable sources per source plane solid angle",
    "is increased ( often called `` magnification bias '' ) is equal to the mean magnification .",
    "the mean magnification of a quadruple system for an sis model in the presence of external shear @xcite scales as @xmath32 .",
    "magnification bias , in the presence of external shear , therefore has the effect of reducing the number of observed lens systems , but by a factor that is smaller than that by which the cross - section is increased . the net effect of external shear is to enhance the number of quadruple lenses , and we would expect instances of high external shear to be overrepresented in catalogs of quadruple gravitational lenses relative to massive early - type galaxies in general or two - image lenses .    the effect of additional convergence @xmath33 is to scale the magnifications by a constant factor @xmath34 and to enhance the effects of external shear , causing an `` effective shear '' @xcite @xmath35 . in practice ,",
    "for the shear and convergences due to large scale structure the difference between @xmath36 and @xmath37 is negligible .",
    "if we approximate the effects of magnification bias as scaling the fraction of lenses by the mean magnification ( i.e. , assume @xmath31 ) , the net effect ( including cross - sections and magnification ) of external shear and additional convergence is that the probability of a system being observed ( assuming a sis lens with external shear ) to be a quadruple lens is proportional to @xmath38 .",
    "the tendency of early - type galaxies to reside in overdense regions , where both external shear and additional convergence are likely , leads to a significant selection effect in the direction of enhancing the typical shear at the position of a quadruple image lens system .",
    "this is shown in figure 2 , where we show the effects of this selection on the shear ( true shear , not effective shear ) expected for a typical four - image lens system , assuming that the lens can be modeled as an sis with external shear . as the input shear distribution we used the results from the previous section , using only the contribution from the material in the simulation volume and not including the contribution from other material along the line of sight .",
    "the shear distribution was then constructed , with each galaxy position weighted by the appropriate quadruple lens probability .",
    "the mean convergence at each galaxy position was measured using the original mass map smoothed on a scale of 300 @xmath1kpc to ensure that the additional convergence was truly from large scale surrounding material .",
    "this will underestimate the extra convergence expected at the position of lens galaxies , but significantly reduces shot noise as well as ambiguity concerning what should be considered part of the lens galaxy .    including these selection effects",
    ", the mean shear expected from only the immediately surrounding material is 0.11 and the rms shear is 0.15 , with a @xmath045% probability of @xmath39 .",
    "therefore , it is to be expected that measured shear in typical four - image systems should be @xmath40",
    ".    0.1 in    we have assumed that galaxy ellipticity is not important , but ellipticity of the lens galaxy can significantly reduce the enhancement of the cross - section due to external shear . for galaxies more elliptical than an axis ratio of about 0.7:1 the cross - section is nearly unaffected by external shear ( rusin and tegmark 2001 ) . observed samples of early - type galaxies in nearby clusters @xcite contain many significantly flattened objects , so if typical lens galaxies are morphologically similar to typical early - type galaxies ( of all masses ) in galaxy clusters , then the selection effects outlined in this section will be reduced .",
    "previous studies have concluded that external shear is not a viable solution to the apparent excess of quadruples ( rusin and tegmark 2001 and references therein ) but on a system - by - system basis it is apparent that external shear is significantly higher in lens systems than had been predicted .",
    "the calculations in the previous sections demonstrate that the external shear expected in a typical quadruple lens system is roughly 0.10 , with a large tail extending to @xmath41 , much larger than previously predicted .",
    "the effects of large scale structure uncorrelated with the lens , structures within 50 @xmath1kpc of the lens , and substructures within the lens galaxy will increase typical shear values further .",
    "using the compilation of lens models from the castles web site , the mean reported external shear ( for all lens systems , not just quadruple systems ) is 0.10 , with an rms of 0.12 .",
    "this should be treated as anecdotal evidence for typical shear of @xmath00.1 ; several models have a non - positive number of degrees of freedom , the reported uncertainties have been ignored in our calculations ( i.e. , not inverse variance weighted ) and many of the fits have been performed holding the galaxy ellipticity fixed .",
    "we have shown that such a distribution of shears can comfortably be accommodated within the current understanding of galaxies and their environments .",
    "the observation that lens galaxies are predominantly early - type galaxies is fully consistent with the observed external shears of @xmath42 .",
    "as would be expected , the observed shear in quadruple - image systems appears to be systematically larger than for double - image lenses .    to solve the excess of four - image systems compared to two - image systems , typical external shear on the order of 0.3",
    "is required ( kks ; finch _ et al .",
    "we are in agreement with previous work that such high shears are not expected from currently viable cosmological models .",
    "a combination of external shear and galaxy ellipticity is not efficient for increasing the fraction of quads , as they are most likely not correlated and therefore do not add coherently .",
    "the main effect of external shear in the presence of a distribution of ellipticities is to increase the fraction of quadruple images only in the low ellipticity regime .",
    "other possible solutions to the problem of too many quadruple images can be enhanced by the addition of external shear .",
    "for example , adding a core to the mass profile or making the central density profile less steep can enhance the fraction of quadruple images @xcite .",
    "the additional convergence due to large scale structure will introduce a moderate selection effect , as the image separations will be increased , making it more likely that small splittings could be resolved .",
    "however , it does not appear that external shear can by itself solve the problem of the apparent excess of four - image systems .",
    "we have shown that the relatively high amounts of external shear found in most lens systems naturally arise from non - linear large scale structure in the vicinity of the lenses .",
    "early - type galaxies are systematically in more overdense regions and therefore would be expected to experience higher amplitude tidal fields .    the fact that quadruple lens galaxies are mainly early - type galaxies is enough to explain the observed values of external shear , previously considered high . the dominance of early - type galaxies in lens samples arises simply from the bias in lens samples toward more massive galaxies , which are more likely to be early - type galaxies @xcite .",
    "this amount of shear expected from nearby structures is not sufficient to , by itself , solve the `` quad problem '' ( the apparent relative super - abundance of four - image systems ) but the effect goes in the right direction and should add with other effects , such as making density profiles in the centers of galaxies less steep . paying careful attention to the preferred positions of galaxies relative to typical places in the universe , as we have done here ,",
    "will almost certainly have an important role in understanding these observations .",
    "typical shear values are sufficiently high that external shear should be of comparable or greater importance in lens modeling to internal shear ( galaxy ellipticity ) , in agreement with model fits to known lenses .",
    "we do not expect the introduction of galaxy ellipticities to significantly change our conclusions , but it would be a natural direction for future work .",
    "selection effects are important in gravitational lens systems .",
    "the results presented here suggest that our knowledge of structure formation and galaxy environments can be usefully applied to understanding the observed statistics and characteristics of lens systems . as numerical simulations of large scale structure ,",
    "models of galaxy formation , and gravitational lens catalogs all continue to improve we can expect the importance of an integrated approach to only increase ."
