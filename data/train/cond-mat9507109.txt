    "when atoms or molecules with orbitally degenerate valence levels are arranged to form a solid , the degeneracy of the isolated constituents is often broken , once the solid is formed . in many cases , in fact , the crystal field , produced by the surrounding atoms / molecules , is able to remove the original degeneracy . yet ,",
    "if the crystal symmetry is sufficiently high the orbital degeneracy may not be completely lifted .",
    "in this situation the jahn - teller ( jt ) effect , arising from coupling electrons to vibronic modes , may play an important role .",
    "in particular it can induce a global symmetry - lowering lattice deformation lifting the residual degeneracy ( `` static '' jahn - teller effect ) .",
    "however if the phonon frequencies are high in comparison with the electron hopping , the static distortion may become disadvantageous and the original symmetry may be recovered dynamically ( `` dynamic '' jahn - teller effect ) .",
    "a primary and well known consequence of the dynamic mixing between electronic and vibronic degrees of freedom , is the renormalization of several electronic matrix elements by the so - called ham factors .",
    "apart from this suppression factor , other interesting properties may arise when dynamical jt effect is important .",
    "for instance , in the context of superconductivity in fullerenes , it has been recently proposed@xcite that the dynamical jt effect may be associated with an increase of the electronic pairing interaction . in the specific case of charged fullerene molecules ,",
    "the jt effect arises mainly from coupling the partially occupied @xmath0 orbitals with the @xmath1 vibronic modes , even though for a realistic description one has to take into account other modes such as @xmath2 @xcite and other orbitals , such as @xmath3 and @xmath4 .",
    "since the physical model is very complicated , in ref .",
    "a simplified version was introduced , aimed at capturing the essential physics of the problem .",
    "the model consists of a lattice of molecules , each with two degenerate orbitals coupled to a doubly - degenerate vibronic mode .",
    "the hamiltonian of each molecule is described by a so - called e - e jt hamiltonian , which is the simpler case of dynamic jt effect@xcite . in spite of its simplicity ,",
    "the lattice of e - e molecules was shown@xcite to exhibit in the strong coupling limit rather striking and unexpected features .",
    "in particular it was found that , even if the polaronic attraction is disregarded , two electrons in the vacuum still bind with a binding energy proportional to the effective hopping ( the bare hopping reduced by the ham factor ) . at higher density",
    "however the model could only be analyzed numerically and in one dimension@xcite .    besides the application to @xmath5",
    ", the doubly degenerate jahn - teller model might provide useful information for other systems where the jahn - teller effect is expected to be important , such as compounds containing magnetic ions with unfilled @xmath6 or @xmath7 shells . in this case it is well known that the interplay between the jahn - teller effect and the strong electronic correlations plays a very important role in determining both the structural and the magnetic properties ( for a review mainly on transition metal compounds see e.g. ref . and ref . , and for rare earth compounds see ref . ) .",
    "a typical example where the doubly degenerate jt model could be relevant is a transition metal ion , whose valence state is five - fold orbitally degenerate . in cubic symmetry , the crystal field splits the @xmath6-levels into a three - fold degenerate @xmath8 level and a two - fold degenerate @xmath9 .",
    "exactly for a tetrahedral distortion , the two - fold degenerate @xmath9 is the ground state .    in this paper",
    "we study the lattice of e - e molecules in the weak electron - phonon coupling regime and for phonon frequencies higher or comparable to the electron bandwidth .",
    "since any perturbation , however small , has always important consequences for degenerate levels , most of the interesting features originally recognized in ref . for strong electron - phonon coupling ,",
    "are already present in the weak coupling regime .",
    "this limit has in addition the big advantage of allowing an analytical approach which will provide new useful results valid in any dimension .",
    "moreover in one - dimension , where powerful analytical techniques are available , we are able to characterize the whole phase diagram of the model , both in the weak and in the strong coupling regimes .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [ molecule ]",
    "we introduce the model and discuss the properties of a single molecule both in the weak and strong coupling limit . in the former limit , we find an unitary transformation which , when applied to the molecular hamiltonian , provides an effective hamiltonian without electron - phonon coupling which nevertheless can reproduce all the correct results up to fifth order in the electron - phonon coupling constant . a lattice of such jt molecules is introduced and analyzed in section [ lattice ] . in section [ bcs ] we study the model within a bcs mean field approach .",
    "finally , in section [ one_d ] , we calculate the phase diagram of the model in one - dimension .",
    "the model we are going to discuss describes an array of molecules with two degenerate electronic orbitals @xmath10 and @xmath11 ( later referred to as `` band '' ) , coupled to a two - dimensional molecular vibration ( henceforth called phonon ) with energy @xmath12 ( @xmath13 ) .",
    "each molecule is described by the so called e - e hamiltonian : @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the two - dimensional coordinate of the local phonon mode , and @xmath16 being @xmath17 the pauli matrices .",
    "the hamiltonian ( [ model : eqn ] ) has to be compared with that describing single - band electrons coupled to a non - degenerate phonon @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the one - component phonon coordinate and @xmath20 is the local density of single band electrons .",
    "in what follows we will show that the additional degrees of freedom of ( [ model : eqn ] ) give rise to new interesting properties .    in the absence of electron - phonon coupling , each molecular level of the hamiltonian ( [ model : eqn ] ) with vibronic energy @xmath21 and @xmath22 electrons is degenerate , with degeneracy @xmath23 the binomial coefficient counts the number of ways of distributing @xmath22 fermions among 4 levels ( 1 and 2 , @xmath24 and @xmath25 ) .",
    "these states can be for instance labeled by the total spin @xmath26 , its _",
    "z_-component @xmath27 , and by @xmath28 ( which is half the difference between the number of electrons in orbital 1 and that one in orbital 2 ) .",
    "the factor ( m+1 ) is instead the degeneracy of each vibrational state and corresponds to the possible values that the vibron angular momentum @xmath29 can assume ( @xmath30 ) .",
    "when the electron - phonon coupling is switched on , this degeneracy is lifted .",
    "the total spin and its _",
    "z_-component are still good quantum numbers , but now only the _ z_-component of the total pseudo - angular momentum @xmath31 commutes with the hamiltonian@xcite . notice that for odd number of electrons @xmath28 is half an odd integer , and consequently is @xmath32 .",
    "due to the symmetry @xmath33 , each state ( also the ground state ) with odd number of electrons is at least four - fold degenerate ( @xmath34 , @xmath35 ) . on the contrary for even number of electrons",
    "the starting degeneracy is split and the ground state turns out to be an orbital as well as a spin singlet .    at weak electron - phonon coupling @xmath36",
    "each multiplet is split by energy shifts of order @xmath37 , but different multiplets are still well separated by energy @xmath38 . if we are interested in the behavior of the model at energies @xmath39 , we can neglect all but the lowest multiplet .",
    "since this is adiabatically connected to the multiplet without excited vibrons ( @xmath40 , @xmath41 ) , it can be labeled by the electronic quantum numbers only ( @xmath26 , @xmath27 and @xmath28 ) . this suggests that it is possible to define an effective hamiltonian for this lowest multiplet which acts only on the electronic degrees of freedom and is able to reproduce the energy shifts inside the multiplet . a standard way to derive",
    "this hamiltonian is via an unitary transformation @xmath42 . for the non - degenerate model ( [ standard ] ) , this unitary transformation simply shifts the origin of the harmonic oscillator to a new one , namely @xmath43 . in the degenerate two - band model , the components of the new origin @xmath44 do not commute among themselves , and this gives rise to some of the interesting properties of the model . up to order @xmath45 , the operator @xmath46 for the degenerate model is given by ( see e.g. m. wagner in ref . for a comprehensive review of unitary transformations in jt models )",

    "the molecular ground state with an odd number of electrons ( @xmath52 ) is four  fold degenerate ( @xmath53 ) , and its ground state energy is , up to order @xmath54 , @xmath55 .",
    "on the other hand , for two electrons , the electron - phonon interaction splits the initial six  fold degenerate ground state state into a multiplet whose lowest member is a non  degenerate singlet ( @xmath56 ) .",
    "more precisely ( in units of @xmath38 ) : @xmath57 in the strong coupling limit @xmath58 , the situation is quite different .",
    "the ground state has the same quantum numbers as in the weak coupling limit , i.e. @xmath59 and @xmath60 for odd numbers of electrons , and @xmath61 and @xmath62 for even numbers . on the contrary",
    "the lowest excited states are identified by the same spin of the ground state but higher @xmath32 ( apart from the trivial case of 0 and 4 electrons , where there is no jahn - teller distortion ) .",
    "they are separated from the ground state by an energy of the order @xmath63 . in order to describe this limit , ref .",
    "introduced an effective model with a single electronic level which guarantees that the doubly occupied site is always in a singlet state .",
    "the larger occupancies were disregarded by imagining a strong on - site repulsion able to cancel the strong polaronic binding energy ( of order @xmath37 ) .",
    "the role of the quantum number @xmath32 was played by a quantum rotator .",
    "the main difficulty with this representation is to implement the constraint that @xmath32 has to be half integer for a singly occupied site and integer otherwise .",
    "this condition is automatically verified in the original two - band model , but has to be enforced by imposing a constraint once the effective single - band plus pseudo - spin picture is used .",

    "the last term in square brackets acts only when a triply occupied site is involved in the hopping process , and is crucial to maintain the particle - hole symmetry around half - filling ( two electrons per site ) .",
    "the effective hopping hamiltonian ( [ hopping ] ) plus the molecular term ( [ effhamiltonian : eqn ] ) therefore describe the lattice of e  e molecules for sufficiently small electron - phonon coupling @xmath68 , even in the interesting weakly anti - adiabatic limit @xmath69 .    from eq.([hopping ] ) we see that the electron ",
    "phonon interaction modifies the hopping amplitude according to the occupation of the sites involved in the hopping process .",
    "in particular , if we restrict to the lowest - energy molecular states , the hopping amplitude from ( or into ) a doubly occupied site ( @xmath70 ) increases relatively to the hopping from a single occupied site ( also in the molecular ground state ) to an empty one .",
    "for instance the hopping process from a doubly occupied site to a nearest neighboring empty site , relatively to that from a singly occupied site to an empty site is @xmath71 for small @xmath68 ( see fig .  1 ) , while @xmath72 at large @xmath68@xcite .",
    "as soon as this ratio @xmath73 ( i.e. @xmath74 ) a two particle bound state appears in one and two dimensions , even if we neglect the polaronic binding energy . for instance",
    "the two - particle problem in vacuum is easily solved ( in analogy with ref . ) and the self  consistency condition for the energy @xmath75 reads : @xmath76 where @xmath77 is the hopping energy in momentum space .",
    "this equation indeed admits a bound state solution @xmath78 in one and two dimensions as soon as @xmath74 .",
    "notice that this bound state is a feature peculiar to the degenerate model and it is absent for the non - degenerate version ( [ standard ] ) .    at strong coupling",
    "the situation is more complicated .",
    "in fact the number of lowest excited states , characterized by higher @xmath32 , with excitation energy @xmath79 , grows like @xmath68 for large @xmath68 , and therefore greatly exceed the analogous number in the weak coupling limit ( which coincides with the number of states in the lowest multiplet , i.e. six ) . in order to simplify the analysis , in refs .",
    "the excitations into these higher-@xmath32 states were forbidden .",
    "this amounts to assume that the matrix elements due to the hopping processes which mix these states with the molecular ground state configurations , are much smaller than the excitation energies , that is @xmath80 which is therefore the limit of validity of the results found in ref .. even with this simplification , the model in the strong coupling limit remains analytically quite intractable due to the constraint that @xmath32 should be half integer for odd occupancy and integer otherwise , as previously discussed .",
    "this is the reason why the analysis@xcite was done only numerically and in one - dimension .",
    "in the previous sections we have shown how the lattice of e - e molecules can be mapped in the weak coupling limit ( @xmath36 and @xmath65 ) onto the model with the hamiltonian ( [ effhamiltonian : eqn ] ) plus ( [ hopping ] ) where only electronic degrees of freedom appear .",
    "this model can easily be analyzed by standard many - body techniques .",
    "for instance we can study within bcs mean - field theory the instability to superconductivity . in order to describe a more realistic system",

    "the critical line between the superconducting and the normal state can be obtained analytically : @xmath95 the first two terms on the right hand side represent a negative pairing energy , originating from a gain of molecular zero  point energy upon pairing  @xcite . finally the correlated hopping contribution @xmath96 provides an additional pairing mechanism ( note that @xmath97 ) which is the analog of that described in ref . in the electron  pseudospin model .",
    "this term , being intersite , is favored by a large coordination number .",
    "we recall that this term is originated by the degeneracy of the electronic band and vibronic modes and has no equivalent in a standard non degenerate polaronic model .",
    "it is interesting to compare the properties of the degenerate two - band model with those of a single - band model in one - dimension ( 1d ) , where several rigorous results are known for both weak and strong electron - phonon coupling . in the following analysis",
    "we will restrict to densities less or equal to one electron per site .",
    "a peculiar feature of 1d systems , which is absent in higher dimensions but for particular band structures and fillings , is the nesting property of the fermi surface .",
    "this induces a strong coupling between the @xmath98-phonons and the @xmath98 charge density waves ( cdw ) ( peierls s instability ) .",
    "in fact , as a result of the diverging @xmath98 density - density electronic correlation function , the @xmath98 phonon frequency softens which in turns leads to an increase of the coupling of these phonons with the cdw .",
    "the lower the bare @xmath98-phonon frequency compared to the electron bandwidth , or alternatively the stronger the electron - phonon coupling constant , the more favored the cdw with respect to singlet superconductivity ( ss ) ( see e.g. ref . ) .      in the standard single - band model ( [ standard ] ) , the resulting phase diagram has a region at large phonon frequency and small electron - phonon coupling where ss dominates . upon decreasing the @xmath98-phonon frequency or increasing the electron - phonon coupling constant",
    ", the model has a cross - over to a region where cdw dominates .",
    "further inside this region a better approach is to represent the @xmath98 lattice - distortion with its phase and amplitude .",
    "the amplitude fluctuations around the _ finite _ average value can be neglected . on the contrary",
    "the phase fluctuations are gapless and so strongly coupled to the cdw to be practically indistinguishable ( the two move together ) ( see e.g. ref . ) .",
    "although the two regimes look different ( at weak coupling the amplitude of the lattice distortion is still not developed due to quantum fluctuations ) there is no real transition between them and only a cross - over from ss to cdw characterizes the overall phase diagram , as qualitatively drawn in fig .",
    "2 . an additional electron - electron repulsion enlarges the regime of dominant cdw at expenses of ss@xcite .",

    "in our case we have to describe the @xmath98 lattice distortion by the amplitudes @xmath135 and @xmath136 and the phases of each phonon component ( @xmath137 or @xmath138 ) .",
    "the two phases are locked to the symmetric charge mode and the three describe a single gapless sound mode . moreover @xmath139 gets locked to the antisymmetric charge mode and the two also describe a single gapless mode . the amplitude @xmath92 , which acquires at mean field level a finite value , feels on the contrary a finite restoring force , so that its fluctuations can be neglected at low temperature .",
    "analogously , the spin modes get gapped . in conclusion",
    "we find that : 1 ) the gap of the anti - symmetric charge mode vanishes while the spin gaps remain finite ; 2 ) the dominant fluctuations are now inter - band charge density waves or better pseudo angular momentum density waves identified by the @xmath98 components of the operators @xmath140 in a sense we find in this regime an orbitally quasi - ordered ground state ( in 1d a continuous symmetry can not be broken ) .",
    "the vanishing gap in the antisymmetric charge mode can also be inferred from the weak coupling regime .",
    "in fact as the electron - phonon coupling increases we find that the operator which couples the charge mode to the spin modes gets more and more irrelevant , so that even if the spin modes remain gapped they will eventually become unable to induce a charge gap .",
    "therefore the two approaches , weak and strong coupling , are perfectly compatible . in comparison to a non - degenerate single - band model",
    ", we find that in the degenerate two - band case the increase of the electron - phonon coupling , or equivalently the decrease of the phonon frequency , is accompanied by the closing of a gap in the excitation spectrum .",
    "notice that , even at quarter filling ( one electron per site ) the antisymmetric charge mode remains gapless .",
    "in fact the @xmath111 umklapp processes only couple to the symmetric charge mode , which eventually acquire a gap , but do not affect the antisymmetric charge sector . therefore at filling 1/4 the difference between the weak coupling regime ( where the whole spectrum has a gap , as we previously discussed ) and the strong coupling regime ( where we find one gapless branch of excitations ) is even more pronounced .",
    "we are now able to discuss the phase diagram of the two - band model both at weak and strong electron - phonon coupling . the phase diagram is qualitatively drawn in fig .  3 .",
    "we find three different regions :    * at weak coupling or high phonon frequency , the system has dominant ss fluctuations ( ss in fig .",
    "3 ) ; * upon increasing the coupling constant or decreasing the phonon frequency , we find a cross - over to a region of dominant @xmath107 cdw ( see fig .",
    "3 ) ; * finally , further inside this region , the gap in the antisymmetric charge sector closes and the model has dominant inter - band @xmath98 density waves which can be also interpreted as orbital density waves ( @xmath98-odw in fig .  3 ) .",
    "the addition of the on - site repulsion ( [ onsiterepulsion ] ) does not modify qualitatively this phase diagram until the hund coupling @xmath85 is sufficiently large to make the triplet state for two electrons favorable [ see eq .",
    "( [ multiplet ] ) ] .",
    "if @xmath85 is not so large , we expect that the on - site repulsion simply reduces the region of stability of ss in favor of cdw .",
    "moreover it also suppresses the cdw components where the charge fluctuates between 0 and 2 , and increases the components where it fluctuates between 0 and 1 .",
    "this implies : 1 ) that the @xmath111-cdw component is enhanced against the @xmath107 one ; and 2 ) that the @xmath107 pseudo angular momentum density wave component is enhanced against the @xmath98 one .",
    "in summary we have investigated how level degeneracy and dynamical jahn ",
    "teller effect influence the phonon - induced attraction in a simplified model of two degenerate bands coupled to a doubly degenerate optical phonon .",
    "we have shown that a new intersite attraction is generated to fourth order in the electron - phonon coupling which is not present in a standard one band model .",
    "this new process has many advantages with respect to the on - site polaronic attraction , for instance it is robust to the presence of local repulsion and it does not lead to phase separation  @xcite .",
    "however its strength is much smaller , at least in the weak coupling limit we have analyzed , than the on - site polaronic term , so that it is still an open question whether it may play a relevant role as a mechanism for phonon - induced superconductivity .    in one dimension",
    "the model can be analyzed in detail in the whole range of the parameters .",
    "we have calculated the phase diagram which displays quite new features as compared to the one band model . together with a standard cross - over from a superconducting region to a charge - density wave regime as the electron - phonon coupling increases ( or equivalently the phonon frequency decreases ) , we have found a new region at strong coupling where a kind of modulated - orbital ordering is present .",
    "such orderings have been already proposed in connection to systems with magnetic ions , but they were mainly ascribed to the strong electronic correlations@xcite .",
    "we have shown that modulated orbital - ordering may also arise from purely vibrational mechanisms .",
    "we are grateful to a. parola , s. sorella , g. santoro and n. manini for discussions .",
    "ec sponsorship under erbchrxct 940438 and of nato crg920828 are acknowledged .",
    "more precisely @xmath49 contains terms of order at least @xmath54 which do not commute with the hamiltonian @xmath141 of the free two - dimensional oscillator .",
    "in fact ( [ effhamiltonian : eqn ] ) contains terms of order @xmath54 which however commute with @xmath142 ."
