    "an interesting example is a boundary value problem for a fractional power of an elliptic operator .",
    "for example , in a bounded domain @xmath0 , we search the solution of the problem @xmath1 @xmath2 where @xmath3 .",
    "different approaches are employed to solve numerically such boundary value problems .",
    "the simplest variant is associated with the explicit construction of the solution using the known eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of the elliptic operator with diagonalization of the corresponding matrix @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , this approach demonstrates too high computational complexity for multidimensional problems .",
    "another approach is based on the representation of an elliptic operator power in the form of a contour integral ( the dunford - cauchy representation ) and the application of appropriate quadrature formulas with nodes of integration on the complex plane .",
    "the approximate operator is written as the sum of resolvents @xcite that provides the exponential convergence of quadrature approximations .",
    "the paper @xcite uses quadrature formulas with nodes on the real axis , which are constructed using the corresponding integral representation for the operator power @xcite . in this case , for the inverse operator of the problem , we have an additive representation , where each operator term is the normal inverse elliptic operator .",
    "it is also necessary to note the possibility of finding the solution for the fractional power of an elliptic operator as the solution of an elliptic boundary value problem of higher dimension , i.e. , we introduce a new variable @xcite . in the paper @xcite , this possibility is discussed at the differential level along with the justification of the proposed computational algorithm .",

    "we arrive at the problem of multiplication of the fractional power of the matrix corresponding to elliptic operator by the vector , which corresponds to the right - hand side .",
    "for such a matrix problem , different approaches are used @xcite : krylov subspace methods , contour integration and so on .",
    "special attention should be given to the methods that solve the cauchy problem for the corresponding evolutionary equation .",
    "the first work in this direction for matrix problems with @xmath4 is the work @xcite , where the approximate solution is searched as the solution of the unsteady problem within the unit time interval .",
    "this type of computational algorithms have obvious advantages , related , in particular , to their relative simplicity and regularity : the numerical solution of steady - state problems is often based on the transition to solving pseudo - time evolutionary problems .    in the present paper , for solving the boundary value problem for a fractional power of an elliptic operator",
