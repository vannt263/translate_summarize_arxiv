    "in fact , heisenberg s uncertainty relation @xmath263 that follows from ( [ 4.7 ] ) by writing @xmath264 , seems to imply that , given a fixed energy e , a state can be constructed with arbitrarily large @xmath265 , contrary to caianielloassumption . an upper bound on @xmath265 can be found , however , if @xmath154 is taken to represent the fixed _ average _ energy measured from an origin @xmath266 . in what follows @xmath267 for simplicity",
    ". then the correct interpretation of ( [ yy ] ) is that a quantum state with spread in energy @xmath268 takes a time @xmath269 to evolve to a distinguishable ( orthogonal ) state .",
    "this evolution time must satisfy the more stringent limit @xcite @xmath270 which determines a maximum speed of orthogonality evolution @xcite . obviously , both limits ( [ yy ] ) and ( [ & & & ] ) can be achieved only for @xmath271 ,",
    "while spreads @xmath272 , that would make @xmath273 smaller , are precluded by ( [ & & & ] ) .",
    "this effectively restricts @xmath265 to values @xmath274 , as conjectured by caianiello .",
    "one can now derive an upper limit on the value of the proper acceleration .",
    "in fact , in the instantaneous rest frame of the particle , where the acceleration is largest @xcite , @xmath275 and ( [ 4.7 ] ) gives @xmath276    it also follows that in the rest frame of the particle , where @xmath277 , the absolute value of the proper acceleration is @xcite @xmath278 eq.([9 ] ) is a lorentz invariant .",
    "the validity of ( [ 9 ] ) under lorentz transformations is therefore assured .",
    "result ( [ & & & ] ) can also be used to extend ( [ 8 ] ) to include the average length of the acceleration @xmath279 . if , in fact , @xmath280 is differentiable , then fluctuations about its mean are given by @xmath281 eq.([del ] ) reduces to @xmath282 for sufficiently small values of @xmath283 , or when @xmath284 remains constant over @xmath283 .",
    "( [ & & & ] ) then yields @xmath285 and again ( [ 8 ] ) follows @xcite .",
    "classical and quantum arguments supporting the existence of a maximal acceleration have long been discussed in the literature @xcite .",
    "ma also appears in the context of weyl space @xcite and of a geometrical analogue of vigier s stochastic theory @xcite .",
    "ma has been used to obtain model independent limits on the mass of the higgs boson @xcite and on the stability of white dwarfs and neutron stars @xcite .",
    "it is significant that a limit on the acceleration also occurs in string theory . here",
    "the upper limit manifests itself through jeans - like instabilities @xcite which occur when the acceleration induced by the background gravitational field is larger than a critical value @xmath286for which the string extremities become causally disconnected @xcite .",
    "@xmath28 is the string mass and @xmath287 is the string tension .",
    "frolov and sanchez @xcite have then found that a universal critical acceleration @xmath288 must be a general property of strings .",
    "recently castro @xcite has derived the same ma limit ( [ 8 ] ) from clifford algebras in phase space and schuller @xcite has rigorously shown that special relativity has a ma extension .",
    "applications of the caianiello model range from cosmology to particle physics . a sample of pertinent references can be found in @xcite .",
    "clearly ( [ 4.2 ] ) implies that the effective space - time metric experienced by accelerated particles is @xmath289 and is therefore altered by ma corrections that induce curvature , violate the equivalence principle and make the metric observer dependent as conjectured by gibbons and hawking @xcite .",
    "these corrections vanish in the classical limit @xmath290 , as expected .",
    "recent advances in high resolution spectroscopy are now allowing lamb shift mesearements of unprecedented precision , leading in the case of simple atoms and ions to the most stringent tests of quantum electrodynamics ( qed ) .",
    "ma corrections due to the metric ( [ 4.2 ] ) appear directly in the dirac equation for the electron that must now be written in covariant form and referred to a local minkowski frame by means of the vierbein field @xmath291 . from (",

    "hermitian @xcite .",
    "however , when one splits the dirac spinor into large and small components , the only non - hermitian term is @xmath308 .",
    "if @xmath309 varies slowly in time , or is time - independent , as in the present case , this term can be neglected and hermiticity is recovered . here",
    "the nucleus is considered to be point - like and its recoil is neglected .    in qed the lamb shift corrections",
    "are usually calculated by means of a non  relativistic approximation @xcite which is also followed here @xcite .",
    "for the electric field @xmath310 , the conformal factor becomes @xmath311 , where @xmath312 and @xmath313 .",
    "the calculation of @xmath314 is performed classically in a non  relativistic approximation .",
    "this is justified because for the electron @xmath315 is at most @xmath316 . neglecting contributions of the order @xmath317 , @xmath318 .",
    "this expansion requires that in the following only those values of @xmath319 be chosen that are above a cut  off @xmath320 ,",
    "such that for @xmath321 the validity of the expansion is preserved .",
    "the actual value of @xmath320 is chosen below .",
    "the length @xmath322 has no fundamental significance in qed and depends in general on the details of the acceleration mechanism .",
    "it is only the distance at which the electron would attain , classically , the acceleration @xmath238 irrespective of the probability of getting there .    by using the expansion for @xmath323 in ( [ eq4 ] )",
    "one finds that all ma effects are contained in the perturbation terms @xmath324 by splitting @xmath325 into large and small components @xmath326 and @xmath327 and using @xmath328 one obtains for the perturbation due to @xmath329 @xmath330 the perturbation due to @xmath331 vanishes . in ( [ eq9 ] )",
    "@xmath332 are the well known eigenfunctions for one  electron atoms .",

    "in order to calculate the @xmath337 lamb shift corrections it is now necessary to choose the value of the cut  off @xmath320 .",
    "while in qed lamb shift and fine structure effects are cut  off independent , the values of the corresponding ma corrections increase when @xmath320 decreases .",
    "this can be understood intuitively because the electron finds itself in regions of higher electric field at smaller values of @xmath319 .",
    "@xmath320 is a characteristic length of the system .",
    "it must also represent a distance from the nucleus that can be reached by the electron whose acceleration and relative perturbations depend on the position attained .",
    "one may tentatively choose @xmath338 . according to the wave functions involved , the probability that the electron be at this distance ranges between @xmath339 and @xmath340 .",
    "smaller values of @xmath320 lead to larger acceleration corrections , but are reached with much lower probabilities . this is the case of the compton wavelength of the electron whose use as a cut  off is therefore ruled out in the present context . for @xmath338 , eqs .",

    "they represent research areas where both theoretical and experimental developments are possible .",
    "the sensitivity of measurements in g-2 and lamb shift experiments can respectively set upper limits on violations of p and t invariance in spin - rotation coupling and on the magnitude of ma corrections .    further advances in these fields as well as in heavy particle interferometry , would greatly help in filling a gap of over forty orders of magnitude between planetary scales , over which einstein s views on inertia and gravity are tested , and planck length .",
