    "the problem of two dimensional non - relativistic fermions coupled to a gauge field has been intensively studied over the last couple of years in a variety of different contexts .",
    "it appears as a low energy description of different models of strongly correlated electronic systems , such as electrons in the fractional quantum hall regime and in theories of non - fermi liquid phases for the underdoped cuprates .",
    "our study is motivated by the remarkable recent observations @xcite of quantum oscillations in the underdoped cuprate superconductors at high magnetic fields .",
    "so far , these observations have been consistently interpreted using fermi liquid models of the formation of fermi pockets .",
    "the fermi liquid theory of quantum oscillations @xcite yields periodic behavior as a function of @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the applied magnetic field , with an amplitude given by the lifshitz - kosevich ( lk ) prefactor @xcite",
    ".    however , as the precision and range of the observations increase , it would be useful to have theoretical predictions for other candidate metallic ground states of the underdoped cuprates .",
    "to this end , we will examine the amplitude of the quantum oscillations in ` algebraic charge liquids ' ( acl)@xcite .",
    "the charged excitations in these states are described by fermi surfaces of spinless electrons coupled to an emergent u(1 ) gauge field , as we will review in more detail in section  [ sec : cuprates ] .",
    "we will find that these systems also exhibit oscillations which are periodic in @xmath2 , with a prefactor with small but detectable deviations from the lk theory .",
    "@xcite has also addressed this problem in the clean limit .",
    "however , they do not include the oscillatory terms in the gauge field propagator , which are responsible for the main effects we describe below .",
    "it is also possible that our results have implications for quantum hall systems , where similar theories apply to compressible states at even denominator fillings .",
    "however , we will not explore this connection further here .",
    "our main analysis is a computation of the free energy of a system of @xmath1 species of fermions coupled to a fluctuating , emergent u(1 ) gauge field .",
    "we compute the de haas - van alphen oscillations in the presence of an applied magnetic field in the dirty limit to order @xmath0 .",
    "the @xmath4 theory co - incides with the lk result .",
    "our main results for the order @xmath0 corrections are shown in eq .  , eq .  , and eq .  .",
    "most interestingly , we find a qualitative difference in the behavior of the oscillations as a function of @xmath5 , _",
    "i.e. _ temperature over the cyclotron frequency , compared to fermi liquid theory  @xcite .",
    "this comparison is plotted in fig .",
    "additionally , for the specific heat , @xmath6 , we find that the gauge field correction to the oscillatory term has a temperature ( @xmath7 ) dependence @xmath8 which differs from the @xmath9 dependence in the lk term , and so may be experimentally detectable in recent and future experiments  @xcite .",
    "the organization of the paper is as follows . in section  [ sec : model ]",
    "we introduce the generic model of fermionic degrees of freedom in the presence of weak scalar disorder coupled to an internal gauge degree of freedom . in section  [ ll ]",
    "we discuss the landau level structure , and the role of disorder together with its treatment on a phenomenological level .",
    "we conclude this section by deriving the effective theory for the gauge field in the presence of disorder and landau levels in section  [ polarization ] .",
    "in section  [ oscillatorygauge ] we present a formalism to extract the oscillatory part of the gauge field contribution to order @xmath0 . to this end",
    "we have to calculate oscillatory thermodynamic and transport quantities , part of which is outlined in appendix  [ app : grandpotential ] . in section  [ freespec ]",
    "we show how to calculate the specific heat of the entire coupled system to order @xmath0 . in section  [ specelec ]",
    "we review the derivation of the specific heat and the associated de haas - van alphen oscillations of a disordered gas of electrons subject to a magnetic field . in section  [ specgauge ]",
    "we calculate the specific heat of the gauge field . in a first step ( section  [ nonosc ] ) we derive the specific heat of the non - oscillatory part , whereas in section  [ oneelec ] we calculate the oscillatory correction . in section  [ sec : cuprates ] we explain the meaning of our results in the context of a very recent spin density wave ( sdw)+ gauge field description of the cuprates .",
    "finally , we summarize in section  [ summary ] .",
    "the effective model which forms the basis for this paper was introduced in different contexts and its main characteristics are reviewed here .",
    "we consider a conventional fermi gas with quadratic dispersion , which is minimally coupled to an internal @xmath10 gauge field .",
    "the lagrangian for this system generically reads @xmath11 where @xmath12 denotes the internal @xmath10 gauge field .      in our problem",
    "we consider the above system subject to an external perpendicular magnetic field @xmath13 , which implies the fermions also couple minimally to the external gauge field @xmath14 and causes the electronic system to organize its spectrum into landau levels . in the absence of the internal @xmath10 gauge field @xmath15",
    "we can diagonalize the electronic part and cast it as @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the cyclotron frequency , @xmath18 the landau level , and the degeneracy of the landau levels is given by @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the density of states of the two dimensional electrons at the fermi level .",
    "in addition , we want to consider dilute disorder which couples to the electromagnetic charge but not to the spin sector .",
    "a consistent treatment of such a system was presented in the context of the two dimensional disordered electron gas in a perpendicular magnetic field by ando  @xcite , who incorporated this in the framework of the self - consistent born approximation . on a phenomenological level in the oscillatory regime this can be done by introducing a finite lifetime for the electronic degrees of freedom .",
    "the one particle retarded green s function reads @xmath21 the major effect of the disorder is thus to broaden the landau levels into a lorentzian shape .",
    "the regime of magneto - oscillations , which is what we are interested in , is characterized by @xmath22 . in this regime",
    "the density of states , for instance , has a constant part with a smooth oscillatory part on top of it , see eq .  .",
    "in order to calculate the specific heat in a @xmath0-expansion , we need to derive the photon propagator of the internal @xmath10 gauge field in the presence of disorder and landau levels .",

    "i. e. _ @xmath24 . in a next step",
    "we integrate out the fermions , leading to @xmath25\\;. \\nonumber \\\\\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] expanding the above expression to second order in * a * using @xmath26 we obtain the effective gauge field propagator from the polarization operator . in principle",
    ", one could derive the effective polarization operator in the presence of disorder in the basis of the landau levels  @xcite .",
    "however , here we choose a different route .",
    "in general , the polarization operator is obtained by expanding to second order in the internal gauge field and performing the functional derivative according to @xmath27 following halperin _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite we keep the following two - component form of the photon - propagator @xmath28 subsequently , we concentrate on the low energy form of the photon propagator in the diffusive regime . the form of the photon propagator is highly constrained by conservation laws and generically reads @xmath29 the diffusive limit of the system is accounted for by replacing @xmath30 which on a formal level is achieved including impurity ladders in the vertex function .",
    "the dependence upon the magnetic field enters through @xmath31 , @xmath32 , @xmath33 , and @xmath34 .",
    "@xmath35 denotes the diffusion constant and is set by @xmath36 in two dimensions .",
    "the free energy due to the gauge field is readily calculated ( see halperin _ et al . _",
    "@xcite ) @xmath37 the upper cutoff @xmath38 is set by roughly twice the fermi momentum , thus @xmath39 , which is the upper bound for the existence of low - energy excitations .",
    ".   is the central expression which will allow to calculate the contribution of the internal gauge field with and without applied external magnetic field .",
    "in the following we decompose the inverse photon propagator ( eq .  ) into two parts , one containing the non - oscillatory contributions , called @xmath40 and another part containing the oscillatory contributions , called @xmath41 .",
    "the quantities @xmath42 , @xmath43 , @xmath34 , @xmath35 , and @xmath33 naturally decompose into a non - oscillatory part and an oscillatory part @xmath44 where all oscillatory contributions are expressed as a power series in @xmath45 , which on a formal level is obtained through a poisson summation duality .",
    "as long as @xmath46 it suffices to retain the first moment in this power series to isolate the leading oscillatory contribution .",
    "the results for the oscillatory components are given in the subsequent section ( sec .",
    "[ oscquant ] ) .    using the property from standard perturbation theory @xmath47",
    "we can formulate the contribution of the gauge field to the free energy as @xmath48 it is important to note that the second term is now proportional to @xmath49 and thus small compared to the first term .",
    "the first term in the above expression has been analyzed by halperin et al .",
    "@xcite , and is known to yield a contribution to the free energy of the type @xmath50 , which is reviewed later .",
    "the additional factor of @xmath51 is the manifestation of the well - known altshuler - aronov  @xcite correction .    in the following",
    "we retain the leading order temperature dependence of the density - density and current - current response in @xmath52 , however we will allow for arbitrary @xmath5 .      the dos can be calculated in a way analogous to the grand potential ( see appendix  [ app : grandpotential ] ) . at the fermi level ,",
    "in the regime @xmath53 , the expression for the dos reads @xmath54 whose leading oscillatory behavior in the limit @xmath55 reads @xmath56 we can calculate the longitudinal conductivity accordingly  @xcite , yielding @xmath57 with @xmath58 and @xmath59 .    using the well known einstein relation for diffusive systems",
    "@xmath60 we can determine the oscillatory part of the diffusion constant @xmath35 .",
    "it turns out that to leading order we have @xmath61 where we introduced the function @xmath62 for notational convenience .",

    "furthermore , it is straightforward to show that @xmath66 to all orders in @xmath67 .    the diamagnetic susceptibility can be obtained from the grand potential ( eq .  ) by @xmath68 using eq .   in the limit @xmath55 , @xmath69 , and",
    "@xmath70 we obtain @xmath71",
    "in the spirit of the large-@xmath1 treatment we can expand the free energy @xmath72 of the system to order @xmath0 , which yields the following result @xmath73 where @xmath74 is the free energy of the non - interacting fermionic system and @xmath75 denotes the free energy associated with the fluctuations of the emergent gauge field .",
    "the specific heat of this expression can be obtained by the well - known formula @xmath76 .",
    "this implies that the specific heat decomposes into two parts @xmath77 which are analyzed independently .",
    "the free energy is related to the grand potential via legendre transform according to @xmath78 which allows to obtain the specific heat via @xmath79 the dependence of the chemical potential upon the magnetic field is subdominant , thus @xmath80 with the oscillatory contribution obtained from eq .",
    "@xmath81 where @xmath82 this function is dimensionless and compared to the oscillatory contribution from the gauge field in fig .  [ fig1 ] .    in the limit @xmath83",
    "this reduces to the well - known @xmath84 per spin species .      in the following",
    "we calculate the non - oscillatory and oscillatory contributions of the gauge field to the specific heat separately .",
    "we start with a calculation of the non - oscillatory part of the specific heat of the gauge field . in order to do",
    "so we analyze @xmath85 we can rewrite the contribution to the specific heat as @xmath86 with @xmath87 for @xmath88 and @xmath89 . in order to analyze the asymptotic behavior of the above @xmath90-integral , we start noting that the @xmath90-integration is cut off by the factor @xmath91 on the order of @xmath92 . if we consider the factor @xmath93 , we know that for @xmath94 it becomes @xmath95 , whereas for @xmath96 it becomes @xmath97 . only in the former case will the integral contribute a logarithmic dependence upon temperature , hence @xmath98 we furthermore introduce the short form @xmath99 which is a number of order @xmath100 .",
    "this leaves us with @xmath101 as the non - oscillatory contribution .      in this section",
    "we analyze the oscillatory contribution of the gauge field .    following the prescription given in eq .",
    "we decompose the gauge - field propagator according to @xmath102 using the oscillatory expressions derived in section  [ oscquant ] we identify @xmath103 where @xmath69 was used . calculating @xmath104",
    "we realize that the first term on the right hand side of eq .",
    "does not contribute an imaginary part , thus @xmath105 looking at eq .",
    "it is interesting to note that there are two contributions .",
    "the first contribution survives in the limit @xmath106 , whereas the second part goes to zero . additionally , the second term is down by a factor @xmath107 and is thus parametrically small compared to the first term .",
    "consequently , we will discard the second contribution for our analysis .",
    "the remaining constants read @xmath108 the constants of the disordered electronic system involved in the above expression assume the well - known values @xmath109 we now calculate the temperature dependent part of the free energy ( see appendix  [ app : photon ] ) .",
    "this part reads @xmath110 with @xmath111 .",
    "we introduce the dimensionless functions @xmath112 which allows to express the specific heat as @xmath113 with @xmath114 as defined in eq .  .",
    "if we compare the oscillatory contribution of the lk type ( eq .  ) with the @xmath0 corrections we realize that their ratio behaves as @xmath115 for low temperatures the logarithmically diverging part dominates the @xmath0 correction , which is why we plot the functions @xmath116 and @xmath117 only . for a reasonable qualitative comparison of the functional forms of the two contributions we take the dimensionless prefactor to be of the order @xmath118 . assuming this number , fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] shows a comparison of the temperature dependent dimensionless functions @xmath116 and @xmath119 .",

    "it was known for a long time that the existence of spin density wave order , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath139 is responsible for a fermi surface reconstruction  @xcite . in a very simple approximation we can take this fact into account by introducing @xmath140 and @xmath141 for the electronic pockets sitting at the antinodal points ( ( @xmath142))and @xmath143 , @xmath144 , @xmath145 , and @xmath146 for the hole degrees of freedom sitting at the nodal points ( ( @xmath147 ) ) : @xmath148 and @xmath149 where @xmath150 and @xmath151 . as explained before , all the fermionic degrees are coupled to the internal @xmath10 gauge field , but carry different charges under the transformation .    the generic phase diagram of the above model has been worked out in very recent publications  @xcite and is not repeated here .",
    "our work concentrates on the metallic sdw and acl states with small fermi pockets , _",
    "i.e. _ for magnetic fields @xmath152 bigger than the critical field strength @xmath127 above which superconductivity is destroyed .    in the above model we again introduce disorder and magnetic field on the level of the single particle propagator .",
    "we realize that there are two cyclotron frequencies @xmath153 and @xmath154 , associated with the two different sorts of electrons .",
    "additionally , there are two scattering times @xmath155 and @xmath156 .",
    "the following discussion is again valid in the limit @xmath157 .",
    "the specific heat of the system is this time composed of four different contributions @xmath158 the first term is due to the bosonic spinons and was calculated in ref .",
