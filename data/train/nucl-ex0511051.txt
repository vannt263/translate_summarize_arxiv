    "early in 2005 , hardy and towner @xcite published a complete survey of all half - life , decay - energy and branching - ratio measurements pertaining to 20 superallowed @xmath11 decays . for nine of these ,",
    "the decay @xmath12 values were determined with a precision of 0.15% or better .",
    "these data , further adjusted for radiative and isospin - symmetry - breaking corrections @xcite , yielded corrected @xmath13 values that were all the same to within their derived uncertainties .",
    "this is a highly satisfactory situation since it confirms the expectations of the conserved vector curent ( cvc ) hypothesis that the corrected @xmath13 values for fermi transitions between states of a particular isospin should all be the same .",
    "indeed , this is a prerequisite if the up - down element , @xmath14 , of the cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa ( ckm ) matrix is to be determined from the average @xmath13 value . the singular advantage that nuclei",
    "have over the neutron or the pion for the determination of @xmath14 is that there are many examples , currently nine with good precision , that can be averaged together to reduce the uncertainties while concurrently building confidence that no unforeseen pitfalls are lurking in the data .    later in 2005",
    ", the first penning - trap mass measurement of one of these nine most precisely determined superallowed transitions was published @xcite .",
    "of the nine transitions , @xmath0v had the largest uncertainty associated with its @xmath15 value and , for this reason , it was selected for the penning trap measurement .",
    "the result was startling .",
    "the mass obtained for the parent , @xmath0v , and the daughter , @xmath0ti , both differed substantially from the adopted values in the 2003 mass tables @xcite , and the mass difference yielded a decay @xmath15 value nearly three standard deviations away from the average value quoted in the hardy - towner compilation @xcite .",
    "all nine of the prime superallowed transitions feed stable daughter nuclei . in these cases",
    "four principal methods have been used in the past to determine their decay @xmath15 values : _ ( a ) _ a @xmath16 threshold measurement , _ ( b ) _ a @xmath17he@xmath18 @xmath15-value measurement , _",
    "( c ) _ a @xmath15-value difference measurement ( between two superallowed transitions ) with @xmath17he@xmath18 reactions on a composite target , and _ ( d ) _ a combination of @xmath19 and @xmath20 measurements . for @xmath0v ,",
    "there had only been two previous measurements : a threshold @xmath16 measurement of squier _ et al . _",
    "@xcite giving @xmath21 kev and a @xmath17he@xmath18 measurement of vonach _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite giving @xmath22 kev .",
    "the new penning - trap result @xcite of 7052.90(40 ) kev agrees with the former but is in strong disagreement with the latter , which claims smaller error bars .",
    "this latter @xmath17he@xmath18 result appeared in a publication @xcite that included six other @xmath15 values in the prime series of superallowed emitters , all quoted with similarly small uncertainties . since the energy calibration used nearly 30 years ago in ref .",
    "@xcite can not be reconstructed and most of its other six results differ from more recent measurements , savard _ et al . _",
    "@xcite opted to remove all seven measurements from the high - precision data set .",
    "the consequences are dramatic . in the upper panel of fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] we show the corrected @xmath13 values as published in the hardy - towner compilation @xcite where all values are seen to be in accord . in the lower panel ,",
    "we show the results of removing the @xmath17he@xmath18 measurements of vonach _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite and including the penning trap measurement of savard _",
    "there is serious deterioration .",
    "the data are no longer all consistent as required by the cvc hypothesis : the @xmath13 value for @xmath0v is significantly above the average .    from a purely experimental perspective",
    ", the new penning - trap result for the @xmath0v @xmath1 value disagrees only with a single previous experiment @xcite , one whose results for other nuclei also appear to be aberrant .",
    "nevertheless , the @xmath13-value anomaly it creates clearly raises suspicion and emphasizes the critical importance of extending these penning - trap measurements to other cases .",
    "suspicion is now further aroused by a preliminary result @xcite for the mass of @xmath23sc , which may also lead to a @xmath1 value that is higher than the previous average from reaction measurements @xcite . at issue",
    "now is the question of whether @xmath15 values measured in penning traps are consistently higher than those determined by other methods , or whether @xmath0v is an isolated occurrence .",
    "if the latter is the case , then the restoration of cvc consistency would seem to depend on there being a deficiency in the current nuclear - structure dependent corrections @xcite obtained for @xmath0v .",
    "if the former is the case , then all @xmath15-value measurements , past and present , need to be scrutinized even more carefully for undetected systematic effects .    in this paper",
    ", we critically examine two key reactions used in the past to measure the @xmath15 values of superallowed transitions .",
    "we compare @xmath19 and @xmath20 reactions in the @xmath7 mass region with very precise ( conventional ) penning - trap measurements of stable nuclei , and set limits on possible undetected systematic effects in these reactions .",
    "we then derive a very conservative range for the mass excess of radioactive @xmath9al based on these reactions alone . when @xmath9al is measured by ( on - line ) penning trap",
    ", it should provide a critical test for the presence of systematic effects .",
    "if the penning - trap result does not lie within our range , then considerable urgency will have to be placed on resolving the discrepancy and possibly completely re - evaluating all the accepted superallowed @xmath15 values .",
    "the masses of @xmath8 mg , @xmath9 mg @xcite and @xmath10si @xcite have all been measured with penning - trap mass spectrometers .",
    "these same masses can also be interconnected by reaction @xmath15 values , the masses of @xmath8 mg and @xmath9 mg being related by a pair of ( @xmath4,@xmath5 ) reactions , on @xmath8 mg and @xmath24 mg ; and the masses of @xmath9 mg and @xmath10si being related by a pair of ( @xmath6,@xmath5 ) reactions , on @xmath9 mg and @xmath25al .",
    "this provides a so - far unique situation in which penning - trap and reaction measurements can be directly compared at relatively high precision .",
    "the reaction results are quoted to a precision of 80 - 300 ev and the penning - trap results are quoted to 2 - 32 ev .",
    "lclll & & & & + penning trap & @xcite & @xmath26 & & @xmath27 +   + ( @xmath4,@xmath5 ) & @xcite & & @xmath28 & @xmath29 + & @xcite & & @xmath30 & @xmath31 + & @xcite & & @xmath32 & @xmath33 + & @xcite & & @xmath34 & @xmath35 + & @xcite & & @xmath36 & @xmath37 +    since the trap and reaction techniques are very different , they should not share any common sources of systematic error .",
    "therefore , by combining the two ( @xmath4,@xmath5 ) reaction @xmath15 values and comparing the result with the ( @xmath9mg@xmath38 mg ) mass difference obtained from the penning - trap measurements , we can have some measure of systematic errors associated with that reaction ; and similarly by combining the two ( @xmath6,@xmath5 ) reaction @xmath15 values and comparing the result with the ( @xmath10si@xmath39 mg ) mass difference we can determine possible systematic errors in ( @xmath6,@xmath5 ) measurements .",
    "the outcome will allow us to judge the validity of reaction @xmath15-value results in general , but particularly among short - lived exotic nuclei , for which penning - trap measurements are unavailable or are known with less precision .",
    "in the first row of table [ table1 ] we give the mass excesses of @xmath8 mg and @xmath9 mg as measured with a penning trap @xcite .",
    "there have been five independent measurements of the @xmath15 values for ( @xmath4,@xmath5 ) reactions on the three stable isotopes of magnesium @xcite .",
    "we have taken the @xmath8mg(@xmath4,@xmath5)@xmath24 mg and @xmath24mg(@xmath4,@xmath5)@xmath9 mg @xmath15 values as obtained in each measurement and combined them with the @xmath8 mg mass excess from the first row of the table to derive a mass excess for @xmath9 mg .",
    "these five results appear in rows 2 through 6 of the last column , where they can each be compared with the higher precision @xmath9 mg mass excess from the top row .",
    "this comparison is also illustrated in the bottom panel of fig [ fig2 ] where the ( @xmath4,@xmath5 ) results appear as solid diamonds with error bars , and the penning - trap result is presented as a shaded band .",
    "it can be seen that two of the ( @xmath4,@xmath5 ) data points for @xmath9 mg differ significantly from the penning - trap value , one of them by three standard deviations .    .[table2]the @xmath15 values for the @xmath40n(@xmath4,@xmath5)@xmath41n reaction as accepted at various dates in the past 30 years .",
    "the value @xmath42 gives the difference between that @xmath15 value and the one accepted in 2003 .",
    "[ cols=\"<,<,^ , < \" , ]     the next step is to examine measurements of the @xmath24mg(@xmath6,@xmath5)@xmath9al @xmath15 value , from which the @xmath9al mass can be derived .",
    "although there is only one publication @xcite that claims precision below 500 ev , it originates from the same laboratory as , and with one author in common with , the two ( @xmath6,@xmath5 ) papers @xcite we considered in section [ b ] .",
    "even though it was published 13 years later , equivalent calibration adjustments to those made successfully on the earlier results might be expected to achieve similar success with the later one .",
    "the uncorrected @xmath15 value appears as it was published in table [ table4 ] , and we now deal with what corrections must be applied so that it can be made to conform with modern standards .",
    "the proton resonance energies in the @xmath24mg(@xmath6,@xmath5)@xmath9al measurement @xcite were calibrated relative to the same resonance in the @xmath25al(@xmath6,@xmath5)@xmath10si reaction as were the earlier measurements . however , by the time of the later measurement , the resonance energy was taken to be 991.86(3 ) kev , 20 ev lower than had been accepted previously . as explained in section [ b ] , more recent evaluations and measurements",
    "have led us to adopt the value 991.780(60 ) kev for the resonance energy and , after conversion to the center - of - mass system , this requires an increase of 76(60 ) ev in the total @xmath15 value .",
    "the excitation energies in @xmath9al that were used in ref .",
    "@xcite were taken from earlier work at the same laboratory @xcite , which measured the energies of @xmath5 rays in @xmath9al based on those from @xmath43ga decay .",
    "unfortunately , the @xmath43ga @xmath5-ray energies were not listed in ref .",
    "@xcite but instead were attributed to alderliesten _ et al . _",
    "@xcite , whose results did not actually appear in print until 5 years later . assuming",
    "that the energies of the @xmath43ga @xmath5 rays did not change in the time between their use in calibration and their publication , we can compare the alderliesten _",
    "_ energies with the recent review by helmer and van der leun @xcite : in the important region around 4 mev they are , on average , 35 ev higher than the currently accepted values but by a slightly larger amount at higher energies . because the specific @xmath5 rays used in calibration are impossible to ascertain at the end of this tortuous path , we choose to reduce the @xmath15 value by 50(50 ) ev , a conservative approach .",
    "applying these two corrections , which tend to cancel one another , we obtain the corrected value for the @xmath24mg(@xmath6,@xmath5)@xmath9al @xmath15 value of 6306.426(98 ) kev , where the uncertainty simply includes the original experimental uncertainty and the uncertainties we have assigned to the calibration corrections . in section [ b ] , we concluded that we could not rule out systematic uncertainties in ( @xmath6,@xmath5 ) @xmath15-value measurements below the level of 200 ev ; so , once again to be safe , we increase the overall uncertainty on our final value to 200 ev to accommodate possible undetected systematic effects .",
    "both our calibration - corrected and final results for the @xmath15 value are also listed in table [ table4 ] .",
    "finally , we combine our values for the @xmath24 mg mass excess and the @xmath24mg(@xmath6,@xmath5)@xmath9al @xmath15 value to obtain a value for the @xmath9al mass excess .",
    "we do this first with the results that are not adjusted for possible systematic effects : _",
    "i.e. _ we use the first number listed for the @xmath24 mg mass excess in table [ table4 ] and the second number listed for the ( @xmath6,@xmath5 ) @xmath15 value .",
    "the result is @xmath44 kev .",
    "next , using the numbers that take account of possible systematic effects , we obtain the result @xmath45 kev .",
    "both results compare favorably with the value @xmath46 kev listed in the 2003 mass tables @xcite but , because we incorporate updated calibration standards and , for our second result , include provisions for possible systematic effects , our uncertainties are considerably larger .",
    "one note of caution should be added .",
    "although the mass of @xmath24 mg is derived from two independent but concordant ( @xmath4,@xmath5 ) measurements that also correctly obtain the mass excess for @xmath9 mg , the link between @xmath24 mg and @xmath9al depends on a single ( @xmath6,@xmath5 ) measurement and must be regarded as less secure . although that measurement came from the same laboratory , and used the same calibrations as ( @xmath6,@xmath5 ) measurements that we have demonstrated to agree with precise penning - trap results on stable nuclei , no corroborating ( @xmath6,@xmath5 ) measurements on @xmath24 mg exist .",
    "obviously , we can not rule out an experimental aberration .",
    "we have carefully analysed measurements of ( @xmath4,@xmath5 ) and ( @xmath6,@xmath5 ) @xmath15 values in the @xmath7 mass region and , after updating the results ( where possible ) to modern calibration standards , compared them with very precise penning - trap mass measurements of stable isotopes .",
    "this has allowed us to set upper limits on possible systematic effects of 100 ev for ( @xmath4,@xmath5 ) reactions and of 200 ev for ( @xmath6,@xmath5 ) reactions .",
    "based on ( @xmath4,@xmath5 ) and ( @xmath6,@xmath5 ) reactions , we then established two values for the mass excess of radioactive @xmath9al , one excluding and the other including the adjustment and limits we obtained for possible unobserved systematic contributions .",
    "neither result should be regarded as a value we recommend for use in determining the superallowed transition energy from @xmath9al . instead",
    ", together they provide a critical standard for reaction - based results , to which a future on - line penning - trap mass measurement can be compared .",
    "if the penning - trap result turns out to lie within the limits of our first value ( the one uncorrected for possible systematic effects ) , then one can be reasonably confident that actual systematic effects are below the upper limits we set ; in that case penning - trap measurements , when they proliferate , can simply be averaged in with the earlier reaction - based results . if the penning - trap result lies outside the limits of our first value but inside the limits of our second value ( adjusted for systematics )",
    ", then one must suspect that reaction measurements in general may suffer from undiagnosed systematic effects ; wherever their quoted uncertainties are in the few - hundred - ev region , they will need to be increased accordingly .",
    "if the penning - trap result lies outside the range of even our systematics - adjusted result , then that could be a sign of serious systematic difficulties , which could call into question all reaction - based measurements of superallowed transition energies or , conversely , could cast doubt on the precision of on - line penning - trap measurements of radioactive isotopes .",
    "this would require serious and urgent attention , particularly in the evaluation of superallowed @xmath3 decay and its associated weak - interaction tests .",
