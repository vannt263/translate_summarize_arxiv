    "the main aim of this article is to establish an averaging principle saying that fast diffusion processes on domains separated by semi - permeable domains may be approximated by certain markov chains .",
    "more specifically , if diffusion s speed in each domain increases while the flux through the boundaries remains constant , in the limit , all points in each domain are lumped together to form a single state , and the limit process is a markov chain whose state - space is composed of these lumped states ( theorems [ t.l2conv ] and [ t.lpconv ] ) .",
    "the jump intensities in the chain are in direct proportion to the total permeability of the membranes , and in inverse proportion to the sizes of the domains ( see eq .  ) .",
    "we note that the principle just described is akin to the famous freidlin  wentzell averaging principle ( @xcite , see also @xcite ) , though it is motivated by biological rather than physical models .",
    "moreover , in contrast to the freidlin  wentzell principle , in our case the crucial role is played by transmission conditions .",
    "predecessors of our principle have been studied in @xcite and @xcite , see also @xcite . in @xcite , in an attempt to reconcile two models of so - called neurotransmitters ( a macroscopic one of aristizabal and glavinovi @xcite , and a microscopic one of bielecki and kalita @xcite ) it has been shown that fast diffusions in three domains , corresponding to the so - called large , small , and immediately available pools , may be approximated by a markov chain with three states , see figure [ figure2 ] .",
    "in fact , in @xcite merely a one - dimensional variant of this limit theorem has been proved , in which the three 3-dimensional pools are replaced by three adjacent intervals .",
    "this result has later been generalized to the case of fast diffusions on arbitrary finite graphs in @xcite ; in both cases the limit theorems are stated as convergence theorems for semigroups in banach spaces of continuous functions . in @xcite ,",
    "a related result has been proved in a space of integrable functions .",
    "see also @xcite for a generalization .",

    "as already mentioned , the key role in this analysis is played by transmission conditions ( see ) describing the permeability of membranes . in the context of heat flow , these conditions may be plausibly interpreted : according to newton s law of cooling , the temperature at the membrane changes at a rate proportional to the difference of temperatures on either sides of the membrane , see @xcite . in this context , j.  crank uses the term _ radiation boundary condition_. ( although , strictly speaking , these are not _ boundary _ , but _ transmission _",

    " wentzell s boundary conditions @xcite ( see @xcite for a more thorough stochastic analysis ) .",
    "a systematic study of semigroups and cosine families related to such transmission conditions has been commenced in @xcite .",
    "we note also the recent paper @xcite , where a heat problem for such transmission conditions is studied for quite irregular boundaries , and the monograph @xcite in which related transmission conditions are analyzed .",
    "one of the fundamental properties of diffusion in a bounded domain is that it ` averages ' solutions of the heat equation over the domain ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the effect is probably best known in the context of neumann boundary conditions . to restrict ourselves to the simplest one - dimensional case ,",
    "consider the heat equation in the interval @xmath4 $ ] ( @xmath5 ) @xmath6 where @xmath7 is a diffusion constant , with neumann boundary conditions @xmath8 .",
    "then , regardless of the choice of the initial condition , say a continuous function @xmath9 on @xmath4 $ ] , @xmath10 uniformly with respect to @xmath11 $ ] . the same is true also when @xmath9 is a member of @xmath12 , the space of functions on @xmath13 that are absolutely integrable with @xmath14-th power , and convergence is understood in the sense of the norm in this space .",
    "( in @xmath15 this can be demonstrated by looking at the fourier expansion of the solution . )",
    "a physical interpretation of is that as time passes the temperature distribution in an isolated finite rod ` averages out ' and becomes constant throughout the rod .    in modeling biological phenomena",
    ", one sometimes may assume that diffusion involved in the model is of several magnitudes faster than other processes .",
    "this leads to a study of the situation where diffusion coefficient(s ) converge(s ) to infinity .",
    "for example , in our simple model , we could be interested in letting @xmath16 .",
    "a counterpart of would than say that , if heat is propagated in the rod without hindrances , then ` before other forces intervene ' the temperature will become constant throughout the rod .",
    "so , if the rod is a part of a larger system , its state at time @xmath17 may in fact be described by a single number , and not by a comparatively more complex object , i.e. , a temperature distribution function .",
    "to look at a more interesting situation , consider @xmath18 and diffusion in two adjacent intervals , @xmath19 and @xmath20 separated by semi - permeable membrane at @xmath21 .",
    "assuming , for simplicity , that diffusion coefficients in both intervals are the same , we write the diffusion equation @xmath22 and impose neumann boundary conditions @xmath23 at the intervals ends .",
    "the membrane at @xmath21 is characterised by the following pair of transmission conditions : @xmath24 where @xmath25 and @xmath26 are positive parameters to be described below . to explain the meaning of these conditions , we interpret @xmath27 as a distribution of temperature throughout the rod , and introduce the total sum of temperatures at the right part of the rod : @xmath28 .",
    "then @xmath29 since a similar calculation shows that , for @xmath30 , we have @xmath31 the first equation in transpires to be a balance condition : the amount of heat lost or gained by one part of the rod is the amount of heat gained or lost by the other .",
    "furthermore , assume for a moment that @xmath25 in is zero .",
    "then the second equation there becomes all - familiar robin boundary condition for diffusion on @xmath32 with partial heat loss at @xmath21 .",
    "then , both conditions combined can be interpreted by saying that some particles diffusing in @xmath32 may permeate through the membrane and thus transfer heat from the right interval to the left .",
    "the larger is @xmath33 , the larger is the heat loss at the membrane ( as seen from the perspective of the right interval ) , and thus the larger is in fact the heat transfer from the right to the left .",
    "hence , @xmath33 is a permeability coefficient for the membrane and describes the possibility for particles to filter through the membrane from the right interval to the left interval .",
    "an analogous statement is true about @xmath34 : it characterises permeability of the membrane when approached from the left .    the main point , though",
    ", is that as @xmath35 , temperatures at both parts of the rod will average out , so that in the limit , @xmath36 and @xmath37 may be replaced by @xmath38 and @xmath39 , respectively , yielding @xmath40 remarkably , these equations describe transient probabilities of a markov chain with two states , say @xmath41 and @xmath42 ; this chain starting at state @xmath42 spends an exponential time there with parameter @xmath43 , and then jumps to the state @xmath41 . while at state @xmath41 , it forgets its past and waits for independent exponential time with parameter @xmath44 before jumping to @xmath45 and so on .",
    "quantity @xmath46 is then the probability that at time @xmath47 the chain is at state @xmath42 , and @xmath48 is the probability that it is at state @xmath41 .",
    "our analysis illustrates that speeding up diffusion in two intervals while decreasing permeability of the membrane in such a way that the flux through the membrane remains constant , leads to the limit in which heat conduction is modeled by two state markov chain : ` heat ' is gathered in two containers and its ` particles ' may jump ` over the membrane ' from one container to the other .",
    "these intuitions are supported by simulations ( see figure [ fig1 ] ) .",
    "the main goal of this paper are general theorems describing such limit results ( see theorems [ t.l2conv ] and [ t.lpconv ] ) . in these theorems ,",
    "intervals are replaced by @xmath0-dimensional adjacent regions with adequately smooth boundaries ( lipschitz continuity suffices ) playing the role of semi - permeable membranes ( see figure [ figure1 ] ) .",
    "analysis of partial differential equations in dimensions @xmath49 is technically more demanding than that in @xmath50 ( the case just shortly described and discussed in more detail in our previous papers ) , but the idea is quite the same : we consider a diffusion process in such adjacent regions , and assume that particles may filter through the membranes from one region to another . as it transpires , if diffusion in each region becomes faster and faster , and at the same time permeability of membranes separating regions diminishes in such a way that fluxes through these membranes remain constant , then the diffusion process so described is well approximated by a markov chain .",
    "what happens , figuratively speaking , is that diffusion tries to average everything out , but in practice , ultimately , this averaging takes place in each region separately , since the membranes , being less and less permeable , in the limit become reflecting barriers .",
    "hence , all diffusion can do is to make all points of each region identical , indistinguishable . on the other hand ,",
    "since the flux through each of the membranes is kept constant along the process of increasing the speed of diffusion , in the limit process there is still some kind of communication , a heat or probability mass exchange between the lumped regions , and interestingly , this communication is that characteristic to a markov chain .",
    "stochastic analysis allows a deeper insight into the way particles filter through the membrane , under transmission conditions .",
    "each of them , starting in the interval @xmath32 , performs a brownian motion in this interval with two reflecting barriers at @xmath21 and @xmath51 .",
    "however , while times of reflections at @xmath51 are soon forgotten , those at @xmath21 are measured by a highly nontrivial , nondecreasing process , called local time ( see e.g. @xcite ) . when an exponential time with parameter @xmath52 with respect to this local time elapses , a particle filters through the membrane , and starts performing a reflected brownian motion on the other side .",
    "( in particular , the larger the @xmath26 , the shorter the time ` at the membrane ' before filtering to its other side , confirming the interpretation of @xmath33 as a permeability coefficient . )",
    "this agrees nicely with the description of the limit process , in which a particle in the right ` container ' stays there for an exponential time with parameter @xmath43 .",
    "hence , from the viewpoint of stochastic analysis , our result says that as @xmath53 , the local time , i.e. , the time the process spends at the membrane , divided by @xmath54 , becomes the standard time divided by @xmath55 .      a short discussion of mathematical tools used to accomplish our goal is now in order .",
    "as we have already mentioned , analysis of partial differential equations in @xmath56 dimensions is significantly more involved than in @xmath50 . by far the simplest ( of several known ) approaches",
    "is that via sesquilinear forms . to begin with",
    "let us note that equations and are particular instances of equations of the form @xmath57 where @xmath58 belongs to a certain region in @xmath59 , and @xmath60 is a differential operator . in both examples presented above @xmath60 is the operator of second derivative ; we note , however , that boundary and transmission conditions influence the domain of such an operator in a crucial way . for instance , in the first example this domain is composed of twice continuously differentiable functions whose derivatives at the interval ends vanish .",
    "in fact , instead of saying that boundary and transmission conditions influence the domain of @xmath60 , it would be more proper to say that these conditions characterise , and are characterised by this domain .",
    "it is clear from this short discussion that properties of hinge on @xmath60 . in recognition of this fact , and to draw an analogue with the case where @xmath60 may be identified with a number or a finite matrix , it is customary to write solutions to with initial value @xmath9 as @xmath61 provided existence , uniqueness and continuous dependence on initial data of such solutions is granted . in such notation , the uniqueness of solutions yields @xmath62 which makes the analogue even more appealing , and justifies viewing @xmath63 as an exponential function of @xmath64 we note that , though both @xmath63 and @xmath60 are operators ( in that they both map functions into functions ) their nature is quite different : while @xmath60 may map functions with small norm into functions of arbitrarily large norms , @xmath63 can not do that ; there is a universal constant bounding the ratio between the norm of the image and the norm of a non - zero argument of @xmath65 nevertheless , the theory of semigroups of operators ( see @xcite , for example ) shows that all properties of @xmath60 have their mirror images in the family @xmath66 , and vice versa .    in particular , the initial value problem for",
    "is well - posed for @xmath9 in the domain of @xmath60 and solutions depend continuously on initial data @xmath9 , if and only if @xmath60 is a generator of a so - called strongly continuous semigroup of operators , which is nothing else but exponential function of @xmath60 , as introduced above .",
    "the question of whether a given operator @xmath60 is a generator is in general quite difficult to answer .",
    "as it turns out , it requires detailed knowledge of the spectrum of the operator @xmath60 , i.e.  knowledge of solutions of the elliptic equation @xmath67 where @xmath68 is given and @xmath27 is searched - for , for a number of complex lambdas . in hilbert spaces , these equations can be studied using the theory of sesquilinear forms which takes its origin in the variational approach to elliptic partial differential equations .    to explain , let us look once again at the heat equation with neumann boundary conditions .",
    "for ease of notation we set @xmath69 . here , we have @xmath70 , the second derivative , and the domain incorporates the neumann boundary conditions .",
    "to solve the elliptic equation @xmath71 , we take the scalar product with a test function @xmath72 ( the sobolev space of functions with weak derivatives in @xmath73 ) and integrate by parts : @xmath74 since the boundary terms vanish due to the neumann boundary conditions @xmath75 .",
    "thus , if @xmath27 solves our elliptic equation , then @xmath27 solves equation . doing the above computations in reverse",
    ", we see that , conversely , if @xmath27 satisfies equation for all @xmath72 then @xmath27 satisfies the elliptic equation @xmath71 and the neumann boundary conditions .",
    "equation is called the variational formulation of the problem .",
    "it involves the sesquilinear form @xmath76 { \\mathrel{\\mathop:}=}\\int_0 ^ 1 u'(x ) \\bar v'(x){\\ , \\mathrm{d}}x\\ ] ] associated to the operator @xmath77 with neumann boundary conditions . here",
    "@xmath27 and @xmath78 belong to the sobolev space @xmath79 .",
    "the relation between the operator @xmath80 and the form @xmath81 is that @xmath76 = - \\langle { \\mathscr{l}}u , v\\rangle , \\qquad u \\in d ( { \\mathscr}l ) , v \\in h^1(0,1),\\ ] ] where @xmath82 refers to the usual inner product of @xmath73 : @xmath83    as it turns out , it is relatively easier to study the form @xmath81 than the operator @xmath84 and basically all the relevant information is contained in the numerical range @xmath85 : u \\in h^1(0,1 ) , \\|u\\|_{l^2(0,1 ) } = 1\\}\\ ] ] of the form .",
    "the numerical range in turn involves the associated quadratic form @xmath86 { \\mathrel{\\mathop:}=}\\operatorname{\\mathfrak{a}}[u , u]$ ] . in the example",
    "above , we have @xmath87 = \\int_0 ^ 1 |u'(x)|^2{\\ , \\mathrm{d}}x,\\ ] ] which can be interpreted as the ( kinetic ) energy of the ` state ' @xmath27 . for symmetric forms , i.e. ,  if @xmath88= \\overline { \\operatorname{\\mathfrak{a}}[v , u]}$ ] , the quadratic form can often be interpreted as an energy .",
    "one should think of quadratic forms as of distant cousins of the quadratic form @xmath89 associated with a square matrix @xmath90 .",
    "( if @xmath90 is @xmath91 , then the form is defined in @xmath92 . )",
    "note that @xmath90 is hermitian , i.e. , @xmath93 , if and only if the quadratic form takes only real values , and that this is a condition on the numerical range .",
    "there are other conditions on the numerical range which frequently appear in connection with matrices , for example : that the numerical range is contained in @xmath94 , resp .",
    "@xmath95 , which are equivalent with the matrix being positive definite , resp .",
    "negative definite .",
    "the main point is that analogous conditions on forms related to differential operators may be employed in studying solvability of .",
    "the quadratic forms appearing in the main theorem of this paper are not symmetric , whence the numerical range is not contained in the real axis , but it is a subset of the complex plane . as we will see in the next section , the right condition to get",
    "the generator of a semigroup is for a form to have numerical range in a sector around the real axis .      for a form @xmath81",
    "we define its adjoint by @xmath96 { \\mathrel{\\mathop:}=}\\overline { \\operatorname{\\mathfrak{a}}[v , u ] } $ ] . in the case considered in this paper , both @xmath81 and @xmath97",
    "are related to operators that transpire to be generators of semigroups of operators .",
    "these generators , and these semigroups , describe the same stochastic process seen from two different viewpoints , but are related to apparently different transmission conditions ; one semigroup provides solutions of the backward kolmogorov equation , the other provides solutions of the forward kolmogorov equation .",
    "we will explain this point by taking the system  as a case study .",
    "as already remarked , solutions of the system  may be interpreted as densities of temperature distribution . alternatively ,",
    "if @xmath98 is a probability distribution density of an initial position of a diffusing particle then @xmath99 is the probability distribution density of this position at time @xmath100 .",

    "the operator @xmath102 governing the whole dynamics is that of the second derivative multiplied by @xmath103 ( we need to denote this operator by @xmath102 and not by @xmath60 to comply with the notation in the main body of the text ) .",

    "all kinases , whether active ( i.e. , phosphorylated ) or inactive , are diffusing inside the ball . binding",
    "a receptor located at the cell membrane ( the sphere ) by an extracellular ligand is a signal which is to be conveyed to the cell .",

    "we will show that this convergence for @xmath53 is a special case of our averaging principle .",

    "this is also the case in the model of bielecki and kalita @xcite , in which a terminal bouton , playing the role of our @xmath201 , is modeled as a @xmath467 region ( see figure [ figure2 ] ) and the concentration of ( vesicles with ) neurotransmitters is described by functions on those subregions .",
    "however , no clear distinction between the subregions is made ; in particular , no transmission conditions on the borders between pools are imposed , and it appears as if diffusing vesicles with neurotransmitter may freely cross from one pool to the other . for reasons explained in @xcite ,",
    "such a model can not be easily connected with the older , and apparently better known model of aristizabal and glavinovi @xcite where the situation is described by three scalars , evolving with time , i.e. , by the levels @xmath510 of neurotransmitters in the pools @xmath207 , @xmath208 and @xmath209 respectively . arguably , to draw such a connection , specifying the way the particles may filter from one region to the other is necessary , and it transpires that the appropriate transmission conditions are of the form with @xmath511 .",
    "( one should note here , however , that no physical membranes separating pools exist in the secretory cells , and the interpretation similar to the newton s law of cooling seems to be more suitable , for example the one provided by fick s law . )    to see that the connection in question is a particular case of our averaging principle , we rewrite the governing equation for the neurotransmitter level @xmath27 in @xmath243 in the form ( compare ( * ? ? ?",

    "clearly this governing equation is of the form considered in corollary [ cor.main ] with @xmath515 independent of @xmath516 in this case , the space @xmath359 is composed of functions that are constant on each of the three pools ( separately ) , and the projection on this space is a particular case of with @xmath517 . as explained in section [ sect.conv ] , @xmath359 is isometrically isomorphic to @xmath518 with suitable norm . in particular , since @xmath33 vanishes on @xmath207 and @xmath208 , the function @xmath519 may be identified with the vector @xmath520 where @xmath521 hence , identifying isomorphic objects , we see that corollary [ cor.main ] establishes convergence of solutions of to a @xmath518-valued function @xmath27 solving the equation : @xmath522    in order to find a more explicit form of the limit matrix @xmath416 we note that , because of the special arrangement of pools , @xmath523 borders only with @xmath208 , and @xmath207 is the only region having common border with the complement of @xmath201 . as a result",

    "the last example concerns calcium dynamics in eukaryotic cells .",
    "calcium plays a crucial role in mediating and recognising signals from the extracellular space into various parts of the cell , in particular to the nucleus . on the other hand , an elevated concentration of calcium ions inside",
    "the cytosol is harmful and may induce the cell s apoptosis .",
    "for that reason it is stored also in intracellular compartments , like endoplasmic reticulum or mitochondria .",
    "( a large amount of calcium is also bound to so - called buffer protein molecules . )",
    "the average concentration of free calcium inside the cytosol does not exceed 1 @xmath529 , while the average concentration of calcium inside endoplasmic reticulum and mitochondria may be two orders of magnitude bigger @xcite .",
    "this is possible due to the action of special pumps , which by using different forms of energy can push free calcium into the regions of higher concentration , e.g. serca pumps ( reticulum ) or mitochondrial sodium - calcium exchangers ( mncx ) . in this way",
    ", cells can transport calcium against the diffusional flux .    in some circumstances , oscillations of calcium concentration between the internal stores and cytosol are observed .",
    "such oscillations are usually described by means of systems of ordinary differential equations ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) . in these descriptions , inhomogenities in the spatial distribution of calcium inside the regions corresponding to different cell compartments are neglected .",
    "as we will argue , our theorem [ t.l2conv ] justifies such a simplified description , provided diffusion in the cell is fast .    to begin with , we assume that the processes of binding and unbinding of calcium ions by buffer molecules , characterized by certain parameters @xmath530 and @xmath531 , respectively , are very fast .",
    "this allows applying the reduction method of wagner and keizer @xcite , so that equations for buffer molecules are neglected .",

    "an extension of the main theorem of our paper to the case of nonlinear transmission conditions is a very interesting topic for future research . )",
    "we thus suppose that the transport of calcium through the membranes separating the reticular and mitochondrial subregions from the cytosol is governed by the transmission conditions : @xmath557 respectively , where @xmath558 s are permeability functions , as in .",
    "recall that @xmath558 s in general depend on @xmath58 .",
    "several remarks are here in order .",
    "first of all , we note that since is to describe distribution of calcium ions , we use transmission conditions akin to and not ( see remark [ dualnosc ] ) .",
    "secondly , the first of the equations in the first line describes the flux of calcium from the cytosol to the reticulum , while the second describes the flux of calcium from the reticulum to the cytosol .",
    "thirdly , in the first of these equations , @xmath559 refers to the derivative of @xmath27 in direction of the outer normal of @xmath207 , whereas in the second it refers to the derivative of @xmath27 in direction of the inner normal of @xmath207 .",
    "note that the inner normal of @xmath207 is the outer normal of @xmath209 .",
    "the other two equations are interpreted in the same way .    additionally , we have the equation @xmath560 governing the outflow of free calcium ions through the outer boundary of the cell and through the membrane separating the cytosol from the cell s nucleus . since the latter part of @xmath561 is impermeable for the ions , we assume that @xmath562 vanishes there .",
    "we note that condition implies that we assume either that the local free calcium concentration in the extracellular space is zero or the influx of calcium from outside the cell is blocked .",
    "we stress that transmission conditions are not yet of the form , because the right - hand sides are not yet the conormal derivatives for the operator @xmath563 appearing in .",
    "biologically , this is a reflection of the fact that only free calcium ions can pass through the separating boundaries  the buffer molecules ( either free or with bound calcium ions ) can not do that .",

    "in modeling biological processes one often needs to take into account different time - scales of the processes involved @xcite .",
    "this is in particular the case when one of the components of the model is diffusion which in certain circumstances may transpire to be much faster than other processes .",
    "for example , in the alt and lauffenberger s @xcite model of leucocytes reacting to a bacterial invasion by moving up a gradient of some chemical attractant produced by the bacteria ( see section 13.4.2 in @xcite ) a system of three pdes is reduced to one equation provided bacterial diffusion is much smaller than the diffusion of leukocytes or of chemoattractants ( which is typically the case ) .",
    "similarly , in the early carcinogenesis model of marcinak  czochra and kimmel @xcite , a system of two odes coupled with a single diffusion equation ( involving neumann boundary conditions ) is replaced by a so - called shadow system of integro - differential equations with ordinary differentiation , provided diffusion may be assumed fast .    in this context",
    "it is worth recalling that one of the fundamental properties of diffusion in a bounded domain is that it ` averages ' solutions ( of the heat equation with neumann boundary condition ) over the domain .",
    "as it transpires , it is this homogenization effect of diffusion , when coupled with other physical or biological forces that leads to intriguing singular perturbations ; this is exemplified by the analysis of the models in section [ sec:6 ] ( see also @xcite ) .    in this paper",
    "we describe the situation in which fast diffusion in several bounded domains separated by semi - permeable membranes is accompanied by low permeability of the membranes . assuming that the flux through the membranes is of moderate value , we show that such models are well - approximated by those based on markov chains . more specifically , because of the homogenization effect , all points in each domain of diffusion are lumped into a single state , and the non - negligible flux forces so - formed new states to communicate as the states of a markov chain ( eq .",
    "provides the entries in its intensity matrix ) .",
    "certainly , applicability of the theorem depends in a crucial way on whether and to what extend diffusion involved in the model is faster than other processes .",
    "nevertheless , the literature of the subject provides numerous examples of such situations .",
    "two of them : the model of intracellular dynamics and that of neurotransmitters are discussed in detail in section [ sec:6 ] .",
    "our third example is of slightly different type : its main purpose is to show that diffusion of kinases in a cell can not be too fast for signaling pathways to work properly .    from the mathematical viewpoint ,",
    "the established principle is a close relative of the famous freidlin - wentzell averaging principle ( @xcite , see also @xcite ) , but it differs from its more noble cousin in the crucial role played by transmission conditions , which are of marginal or no importance in the latter .",
    "these conditions , sometimes referred to as radiation boundary conditions , describe in probabilistic and analytic terms the way particles permeate through the membranes , and thus , indirectly , the flux , which influences the model in a critical way ( see eq . again ) .",
    "in this appendix , we prove lemma [ l.intersect ] , which states that the set of points in the boundary which are adjacent to three or more of the subdomains @xmath707 , @xmath708 has hausdorff measure zero .",
