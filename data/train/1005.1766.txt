    "appearance of the cavity is connected with local change of reflective properties of the photonic structure . in other words ,",

    "trapping pulse inside the photonic crystal is a prospective effect for such possible applications as optical limiters ( which transmit light only with proper intensity ) , optical buffers or memory ( which allows to store light for time , large in comparison with characteristic transmission time ) .",
    "large advantage of the scheme considered is absence of necessity to introduce nonuniformity or any imperfections in the structure of nonlinear photonic crystal .",
    "the article is divided into several sections . in section [ seceq ]",
    "the main equations are given and the approach for numerical solving the wave equation is considered .",
    "section [ sectrap ] is devoted to some phenomenological aspects of pulse trapping effect . in section [ secmech ] the physical mechanism of pulse trapping in photonic crystal with relaxing cubic nonlinearity",
    "is discussed .",
    "finally , in section [ secdep ] we consider some conditions for pulse trapping observation connected with the proper choice of pulse duration and relaxation time .",
    "in this paper we consider ultrashort pulse interaction with one - dimensional photonic crystal made of substance with relaxing cubic ( kerr ) nonlinearity .",
    "light propagation along @xmath0-axis is governed by the maxwell wave equation @xmath1 where @xmath2 is electric field strength , @xmath3 is medium refractive index that depends on light intensity @xmath4 as @xmath5 here @xmath6 is a linear part of refractive index .",
    "time dependence of nonlinear term @xmath7 is responsible for relaxation process and is described by the first - order differential equation due to the debye model of nonlinearity @xcite @xmath8 where @xmath9 is kerr nonlinear coefficient , @xmath10 is the characteristic relaxation time .",

    "however , in the case of abrupt changes of refractive index ( photonic crystal ) it may fail , so that we should solve the full eq .",
    "( [ maxdl ] ) .",

    "let us consider propagation of ultrashort ( femtosecond ) light pulse in one - dimensional photonic crystal shown in fig .",
    "spatial periodic modulation of the background refractive index @xmath26 defines the structure of it , so that it can be treated as a set of alternate layers .",
    "the parameters used in calculations are as follows : refractive indices of the layers @xmath27 , @xmath28 ; their thicknesses @xmath29 , @xmath30 @xmath31 m ; number of layers @xmath32 .",
    "nonlinear coefficient of the material is defined as @xmath33 , i.e. the pulse amplitude is normalized by the value @xmath34 .",
    "this value of cubic coefficient provides refraction index change of thousandth and hundredth of unity and was used in calculations of ref .",
    "note that nonlinear coefficient is positive ( focusing nonlinearity ) , so that refractive index increases with the intensity . the incident pulse is assumed to have gauss envelope @xmath35 . here",
    "@xmath36 is a pulse duration which further takes on the value of @xmath37 fs , while the carrier frequency lies on the wavelength @xmath38 @xmath31 m .",
    "figure [ fig2 ] shows the results of calculations of pulse interaction with nonlinear photonic structure with and without relaxation .",
    "one can easily see that the effect of pulse compression ( obtained at @xmath39 ) is completely absent when @xmath40 fs .",
    "this result is in strict accordance with the conclusions of ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "vanishing of compression effect in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] was obtained for pulse peak intensity @xmath41 , where @xmath42 is the value of intensity corresponding to @xmath33 .",
    "if we take greater @xmath43 , the transmitted pulse continues to decrease . as it is seen in fig .",
    "[ fig3](a ) , only small part of incident light can pass through the nonlinear photonic crystal at @xmath44 .",
    "this situation is observed at @xmath45 as well , though the reflected pulse gets larger in this last case [ fig . [ fig3](b ) ] . when we integrate intensity of reflected and transmitted light over a certain time interval ( @xmath46 in our calculations , i.e. large enough in comparison with time required for pulse to pass through the photonic crystal which is about @xmath47 , see fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ) , we obtain the characteristic energy curves ( fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] ) that describe the change in behavior of pulses as their peak intensity is increasing .",
    "it is seen that , when @xmath43 gets larger than @xmath48 , reflected , transmitted and overall ( summarized ) energies demonstrate dramatic decrease . after reaching the minimum ( output energy is about @xmath49 percent of the input one )",
    ", the curves begin to rise slowly .",
    "this slow growing of transmitted energy continues , while , for reflected and total ones , rise becomes more steep ( especially , when @xmath50 ) and , finally , the plateau is observed for @xmath51 .",
    "thus , the input energy almost entirely transforms to reflected light at high intensities of incident pulse .",
    "it is obvious that the energy of pulses with amplitudes between @xmath52 and @xmath53 is confined inside the photonic crystal .",
    "figure [ fig5](a ) demonstrates light intensity distributions along the length of the structure at different instants of time for the pulse peak amplitude @xmath44 . at first ( @xmath54 ) ,",
    "the most part of pulse energy is localized in a narrow region of the nonlinear photonic crystal , near the position @xmath55 @xmath31 m ( the total length of the structure is about @xmath56 @xmath31 m ) .",
    "as time goes by , energy tends to redistribute more uniformly .",
    "nevertheless , there is still pronounced maximum of intensity distribution , moreover it is shifted towards larger positions , namely @xmath57 @xmath31 m at @xmath58 . at large time points",
    "this distribution stays almost invariant , or stationary .",
    "its maximum only slightly decreases , which seems to be connected rather with further redistribution than with output radiation . anyway , even at @xmath59 approximately @xmath60 percent of pulse energy is still confined inside the photonic structure , just as at @xmath61 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] ) . this time is more than 100 times higher than the interval needed for pulse to pass through the system .",
    "recalling that @xmath62 , this delay time in absolute units is greater than @xmath63 ps .",
    "therefore we can say about _ pulse trapping _ in this case .",
    "only for @xmath64 the system starts to slowly emit light so that the sharp distribution shown in fig . [",
    "fig5](a ) becomes violated .",
    "more detailed calculations show that even at @xmath65 about @xmath66 percent of the initial energy is still inside the photonic crystal , though it is distributed much more uniformly .",
    "now let us consider the pulse with @xmath45 .",
    "the corresponding spatial distributions are shown in fig . [ fig5](b ) .",
    "it turned out that in this case the pulse is localized near the very beginning of the structure . in this position",
    "it rapidly loses energy which is mainly radiated through the front ( input ) end of the system .",
    "so this radiation gives significant contribution to reflection [ see fig . [ fig3](b ) ] .",
    "after light intensity becomes lower than a certain threshold , the pulse starts moving and widening .",
    "it moves quite slowly , so that some part ( about @xmath49 percent ) of the input energy is confined inside the photonic crystal for a long time , but the peak intensity of the distribution is very low if we compare with the case of @xmath44 .",
    "it is interesting to compare pulse behavior considered with pulse propagation in photonic crystal with relaxation - free nonlinearity , i.e. at @xmath39 .",
    "intensity distributions inside the system for this case are demonstrated in fig .",
    "it is seen that there is no any long - term energy localization in non - relaxing photonic structure .",
    "light exhibits only chaotic `` wander '' inside it and simultaneous attenuation due to emitting through input and output ends .",
    "finally , almost all energy of the pulse is already radiated by the instant of time @xmath67 .",
    "therefore we can say that relaxation of nonlinearity is a necessary condition to obtain the effect of pulse trapping inside a photonic crystal .",
    "what is the physical reason , or mechanism , of this phenomenon ? as pulse propagates inside the photonic crystal possessing cubic nonlinearity , refractive index of the structure changes dynamically according to light intensity . if nonlinearity is relaxation - free , these changes are instantaneous and depend entirely on field distribution at current instant of time . in the case of relaxing nonlinearity ,",
    "nonlinear variation of refractive index ( @xmath7 in our notation ) can form a certain stable structure due to retardation in its change .",
    "appearance of this nonlinear dynamical `` cavity '' results in pulse trapping : light tends to change the distribution of @xmath7 and leave the cavity , but inertia of nonlinearity stabilizes it so that intensity is transformed to provide steady spatial distribution @xmath68 .",
    "the example of this is shown in fig . [",
    "fig7](b ) .",
    "one can see that maximal values of nonlinear variation of refractive index @xmath7 ( so - called primary maxima ) are achieved in the layers with low linear refractive index @xmath69 [ see fig . [ fig7](a ) ] .",
    "this is in accordance with the effect of light concentration in low refractive index regions of photonic crystal for radiation tuned to high - frequency side of reflection spectrum @xcite as it is in the case considered ( see the inset in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ) .",
    "on the other hand , high refractive index layers of the structure contain minor ( secondary ) maxima of @xmath7",
    ".    obviously , low - intensity initial pulses are insufficient to produce high enough nonlinear contribution @xmath7 , so that pulse is mainly transmitted and reflected during short time after pulse incidence . for higher intensities [ e.g. @xmath44 as in fig .",
    "[ fig5](a ) ] pulse forms nonlinear cavity inside the photonic crystal which localizes the most part of pulse energy .",
    "though this cavity slowly tends to uniformity of @xmath7 and loses its energy , it allows to trap pulse light for relatively large time interval .",
    "this behavior is obtained in wide range of pulse amplitudes , approximately from @xmath70 to @xmath71 . as pulse intensity increases , cavity formation position moves towards the front end of the photonic structure .",
    "finally , for @xmath72 the nonlinear cavity appears so close to the entrance of the system [ fig . [ fig5](b ) ] that it rapidly emits almost all its energy in the form of reflected light .",
    "that is why only intermediate intensities of pulse ( not too low and not too high ) are suitable to obtain the effect of trapping pulse inside the structure considered .",
    "finally , we should explain the role of photonic crystal in this process .",
    "is it necessary to use photonic - band - gap structure or , maybe , the effect of pulse trapping can be observed in a uniform cubic medium ? to clarify this question we performed calculations of pulse interaction with the medium possessing relaxing nonlinearity and mean refractive index @xmath73 .",
    "one can see [ fig . [ fig8](a ) ] that in this case there is no any light localization for pulse amplitude @xmath44 .",
    "only much more intensive pulses start to lose considerable part of energy inside the medium .",
    "for example , about @xmath74 percent of pulse energy is found to be trapped for @xmath75 [ fig . [ fig8](b ) ] .",
    "this part of energy stays inside the uniform medium for a long time and is connected with corresponding nonlinear variation of refractive index ( see fig .",
    "[ fig9 ] for the instant of time @xmath76 )",
    ". however , the distribution of light intensity in the uniform medium seems to be stochastic and does not resemble pulse envelope as in the case of nonlinear photonic crystal [ compare the distributions in figs . [ fig9](a ) and [ fig5](a ) ] .",
    "therefore we can not call light localization in the uniform medium with relaxing nonlinearity by the pulse trapping in the full sense of this term .",
    "moreover , in photonic crystals we need pulse intensities which are less by an order of magnitude than in the case of the uniform medium .",
    "perhaps , the nonlinear cavity formation is connected with local change of reflective properties of photonic crystal .",
    "this results in dynamical shift of the band spectrum of the structure . to examine this situation",
    "we consider the refractive properties ( for the central wavelength @xmath38 @xmath31 m ) of the structure with refractive index variations shown in fig . [",
    "fig9_1](a ) [ it corresponds to intensity distribution of fig .",
    "[ fig5](a ) at @xmath76 ] .",
    "we calculate reflectivity of the partial structures , which include the layers from the input to a certain final position ( inside the whole photonic crystal ) , and compare it with the case of linear structure .",
    "difference between reflectivities in this two cases as a function of final position is demonstrated in fig .",
    "[ fig9_1](b ) .",
    "it is seen that the structure with modified refractive index modulation provides locally large reflectivity deviations from the linear case .",
    "this deviations mainly appear at large positions inside the crystal where @xmath7 is high enough , so that they can prevent light propagation in forward direction .",
    "similar situation is observed if we consider backward propagation .",
    "hence , it turns out that light is trapped in the central region of the structure .",
    "finally , it is worth noting that this picture of refractive index variations and reflectivity deviations is permanently changing , though it is stabilized by the relaxing properties of nonlinearity .",
    "in previous sections we considered the effect of pulse trapping in photonic crystal with relaxing cubic nonlinearity only for a single set of time parameters : @xmath40 fs and @xmath78 fs .",
    "[ fig10](a ) shows the dependence of output energies ( reflected , transmitted and total ) on relaxation time at fixed value of pulse duration @xmath78 fs .",
    "the behavior of these dependencies is similar to that of the curves in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] : abrupt drop in the range of small @xmath10 ( less than @xmath79 fs ) , smooth increasing and , finally , steep rise of the curves for reflected and total energies .",
    "the full range of relaxation times where the pulse trapping can be observed is rather wide : from a fraction of femtosecond ( relaxation is so fast that it does not influence the pulse ) to about @xmath80 fs that is much greater than @xmath36 ( medium reacts so slowly that the nonlinear cavity forms near the very entrance of the system ) .",
    "the optimal value is @xmath81 fs .",
    "if we fix relaxation time @xmath82 fs and vary pulse duration , the behavior of output energies is quite different [ fig . [ fig10](b ) ] .",
    "as in the previous case , it demonstrates abrupt decrease for small times , namely , pulse durations @xmath83 fs which correspond to only a few optical cycles .",
    "such very short pulse is not able to create a stable nonlinear cavity . on the other hand ,",
    "if @xmath36 is increasing , there is only stepless growth of output energies , reflected and transmitted ones being approximately of the same magnitude .",
    "the reason is the same : nonlinear cavity is not formed as long as a whole pulse can not be placed inside the structure .",
    "the optimal value of pulse duration is about @xmath49 fs .",
    "since the limits of pulse trapping region are due to different reasons in the cases of fixed @xmath36 and @xmath10 , the width of this region will be different , too . in fig .",
    "[ fig11 ] we plotted the curves of fig .",
    "[ fig10 ] versus the ratio @xmath84 .",
    "this figure shows explicitly that relaxation time can be varied in much more wide range than pulse duration .",
    "this also implies that we can use media with relatively slow relaxing nonlinearities to obtain the effect of pulse trapping .",
    "another question is connected with the role of sign of nonlinearity .",
    "so far we considered only positive nonlinearity coefficient such that @xmath33 .",
    "if we take @xmath85 ( defocusing nonlinearity ) , there is no any symptoms of pulse trapping as one can see in fig .",
    "[ fig12 ] for the amplitude @xmath44 .",
    "though this problem should be studied in detail , the preliminary conclusion is that trapping can be observed only for @xmath86 , at least for comparatively low intensities .",
    "to summarize , we have analyzed the possibility of trapping pulse in photonic crystal with relaxing cubic nonlinearity . by using numerical simulations",
    ", we showed that this process is due to the balance between light spreading and inertia of nonlinearity which results in steady nonlinear cavity formation and pulse trapping within it .",
    "photonic crystal is a necessary element for this cavity to appear , due to the processes of dynamical local change of reflection and transmission of the nonlinear structure , and , in addition , leads to decreasing of pulse intensity required to observe trapping .",
    "we discussed the reasons for pulse trapping disappearance at high and low values of both pulse duration and relaxation time resulting in existence of the range of optimal magnitudes of these parameters .",
