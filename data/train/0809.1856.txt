    "the residuals carry important information concerning the appropriateness of assumptions that underlie statistical models , and thereby play an important role in checking model adequacy .",
    "they are used to identify discrepancies between models and data , so it is natural to base residuals on the contributions made by individual observations to measures of model fit .",
    "the use of residuals for assessing the adequacy of fitted regression models is nowadays commonplace due to the widespread availability of statistical software , many of which are capable of displaying residuals and diagnostic plots , at least for the more commonly used models . beyond special models , relatively little is known about asymptotic properties of residuals in general regression models .",
    "there is a clear need to study second - order asymptotic properties of appropriate residuals to be used for diagnostic purposes in nonlinear regression models .",
    "the unified theory of generalized linear models ( glms ) , including a general algorithm for computing the maximum likelihood estimates ( mles ) is extremely important for analysis of real data . in these models ,",
    "the random variables @xmath2 are assumed independent and each @xmath3 has a density function in the linear exponential family @xmath4,\\ ] ] where @xmath5 and @xmath6 are known appropriate functions .",
    "we assume @xmath7 continuous and @xmath8 a probability density function with respect to lebesgue measure and that the precision parameter @xmath9 , @xmath10 is the so - called dispersion parameter , is the same for all observations , although possibly unknown .",
    "we do not consider the discrete distributions in the form ( @xmath11 ) such as poisson , binomial and negative binomial . for two - parameter full exponential family distributions with canonical parameters @xmath12 and @xmath13 , the decomposition @xmath14 holds",
    ". the mean and variance of @xmath3 are , respectively , @xmath15 and @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is the variance function . for gamma models ,",
    "the dispersion parameter @xmath18 is the reciprocal of the index , whereas for normal and inverse gaussian models , @xmath18 is the variance and @xmath19 , respectively .",
    "the parameter @xmath20 is a known one - to - one function of @xmath21 .",
    "a linear exponential family is characterized by its variance function , which plays a key role in estimation .",
    "a glm is defined by the family of distributions ( [ exp ] ) and the systematic component @xmath22 , where @xmath23 is a known one - to - one continuously twice - differentiable function , @xmath24 is a specified @xmath25 model matrix of full rank @xmath26 and @xmath27 is a set of unknown linear parameters to be estimated .",
    "let @xmath28 be the mle of @xmath29 .",
    "residuals in glms were first discussed by pregibon ( 1981 ) , though ostensibly concerned with logistic regression models , williams ( 1984 , 1987 ) and pierce and schafer ( 1986 ) .",
    "mccullagh and nelder ( 1989 ) provided a survey of glms with substantial attention to definition of residuals .",
    "pearson residuals are the most commonly used measures of overall fit for glms and are defined by @xmath30 , where @xmath31 and @xmath32 are respectively the fitted mean and fitted variance function of @xmath3 . in this paper we consider only pearson residuals appropriate to our particular asymptotic aims when the sample size @xmath33 . cordeiro ( 2004 ) obtained matrix formulae for the expectations , variances and covariances of these residuals and defined adjusted pearson residuals having zero mean and unit variance to order @xmath0 .",
    "pearson residuals defined by cordeiro ( 2004 ) are proportional to @xmath34 , although we are considering here @xmath35 as usual without the precision parameter @xmath12 . while cordeiro s adjusted pearson residuals do correct the residuals for equal mean and variance , the distribution of these residuals is not equal to the distribution of the true pearson residuals to order @xmath0 .",
    "further , cordeiro and paula ( 1989 ) introduced the class of exponential family nonlinear models ( efnlms ) which extend the glms .",
    "later , wei ( 1998 ) gave a comprehensive introduction to these models .",
    "recently , simas and cordeiro ( 2008 ) generalized cordeiro s ( 2004 ) results by obtaining matrix formulae of the @xmath36 expectations , variances and covariances of pearson residuals in efnlms .    in a general setup ,",
    "the distribution of residuals usually differ from the distribution of the true residuals by terms of order @xmath0 .",
    "cox and snell ( 1968 ) discussed a general definition of residuals , applicable to a wide range of models , and obtained useful expressions to this order for their first two moments .",
    "loynes ( 1969 ) derived , under some regularity conditions , and again to order @xmath0 , the asymptotic expansion for the density function of cox and snell s residuals , and then defined corrected residuals having the same distribution as the random variables which they are effectively estimating . in all but the simplest situations , the use of the results by cox and snell and loynes will require a considerable amount of tedious algebra .",
    "our chief goal is to obtain an explicit formula for the density of pearson residuals to order @xmath0 which holds for all continuous glms .    in section 2",
    "we give a summary of key results from loynes ( 1969 ) applied to pearson residuals in glms .",
    "the density of pearson residuals in these models corrected to order @xmath0 is presented in section 3 .",
    "we provide in section 4 applications to some common models . in section 5",
    "we compare the corrected residuals with the adjusted residuals proposed by cordeiro ( 2004 ) .",
    "we present in section 6 simulation studies to assess the adequacy of the approximations for a gamma model with log link .",
    "some concluding remarks are given in section 7 .",
    "finally , in the appendix , we give a more rigorous proof of the general results discussed by loynes ( 1969 ) .",
    "the @xmath37th contribution for the score function from the observation @xmath3 follows from ( [ exp ] ) @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the weight function and from now on the dashes indicate derivatives with respect to @xmath40 .",
    "let @xmath41 be the true pearson residual corresponding to the pearson residual @xmath42 .",
    "suppose we write the pearson residual as @xmath43 .",
    "we can write the following conditional moments given @xmath44 to order @xmath0 ( loynes , 1969 ) @xmath45 @xmath46 where @xmath47 is the @xmath48th element of the inverse information matrix @xmath49 for @xmath29 , @xmath50 is the @xmath36 bias of @xmath51 and @xmath52 is the conditioned score function . the mean and variance of the asymptotic distribution of @xmath53 , given @xmath44 , are to order @xmath0 @xmath54",
    "@xmath55 where @xmath56 , @xmath57 , @xmath58 and @xmath59 .",
    "we obtain by simple differentiation @xmath60 and @xmath61 conditioning on @xmath44 leads to @xmath62 and @xmath63 where @xmath64 and @xmath65 for canonical models ( @xmath66 ) , ( [ efunction ] ) and ( [ hfunction ] ) become @xmath67 conditioning the score function @xmath68 on @xmath44 , yields @xmath69 , and then using ( @xmath70 ) we find @xmath71 where @xmath72 , @xmath73 is the diagonal matrix of weights , @xmath74 is a @xmath75-vector with the @xmath76th element equal to one and all other elements equal to zero and @xmath77 is an @xmath1-vector with one in the @xmath37th position and zeros elsewhere . defining @xmath78",
    ", we can easily verify that @xmath79 cordeiro and mccullagh ( 1991 ) showed that the @xmath0 bias of @xmath28 is given by @xmath80 where @xmath81 , @xmath82 , @xmath83 is a diagonal matrix with the diagonal elements of @xmath84 and @xmath85 is an @xmath1-vector of ones .",
    "the asymptotic covariance matrix of the mle @xmath86 of the linear predictor is simply @xmath87 .",
    "we obtain @xmath88 where @xmath89 is the @xmath37th element of the @xmath90 bias @xmath91 of @xmath86 .",
    "the bias expression depends on the model matrix , the variance function and the first two derivatives of the link function .",
    "also , @xmath92 the conditional mean @xmath93 from ( [ meancond ] ) is then a second - degree polynomial in @xmath94 given by @xmath95 where @xmath96 and @xmath97 are obtained from ( @xmath98 ) and ( @xmath99 ) .",
    "we now compute the conditional variance @xmath100 . from ( @xmath101 )",
    "it follows @xmath102 hence , @xmath100 is also a second - degree polynomial in @xmath94 .",
    "a simple calculation from ( @xmath11 ) gives the probability density function ( pdf ) of the true pearson residual @xmath103,\\ ] ] where @xmath104 .",
    "table 1 gives the densities of the true residuals for the normal , gamma and inverse gaussian distributions , where @xmath105 is the gamma function .",
    ".densities of the true residuals for some distributions . [ cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     we conclude the study providing an application of the corrected residuals to assess the adequacy of the above gamma model .",
    "we could expect that under a well - specified model , the distribution of the corrected residuals will follow approximately the distribution of the true residuals .",
    "however , even though it is common to compare the distribution of the pearson residuals with the normal distribution , it is not clear that this approximation should be good in small samples .",
    "therefore , we compare the empirical distribution of the corrected residuals with the distribution of the true residuals and the distribution of the uncorrected residuals with the normal distribution . for doing this ,",
    "we use a qqplot which displays a quantile - quantile plot of the sample quantiles of the corrected and uncorrected residuals versus theoretical quantiles from the estimated distribution of the true residuals and the normal distribution with mean zero and variance @xmath106 , respectively .",
    "if the distribution of the corrected residuals is well approximated by the distribution of the true residuals , the plot will be close to linear .",
    "therefore , we expect that a qqplot of the studentized corrected residuals versus the estimated distribution of the true residuals should be closer to the diagonal line than that qqplot of the uncorrected residuals against the normal @xmath107 distribution .",
    "moreover , we also consider the qqplot of the adjusted residuals suggested by cordeiro ( 2004 ) against the theoretical quantiles of a standard normal distribution .",
    "figure 1 gives two qqplots , one for the vector of the @xmath108 ordered uncorrected residuals and other for the vector of the @xmath108 ordered corrected residuals .",
    "these figures show that even for a well - specified model , the plot for the uncorrected residuals is very distant from the diagonal line when compared with the plot for the corrected residuals .",
    "the adjusted residuals given in figure 2 provides an improvement in regard to the uncorrected residuals , but the plot is also distant from the diagonal line when compared to the corrected residuals .",
    "therefore , the corrected residuals have a good behavior that leads to the right conclusion , i.e. , that the model is well - specified .",
    "we thus recommend the corrected residuals to build up qqplots .",
    "using the results given in loynes ( 1969 ) , we calculate the @xmath109 distribution of the pearson residuals in glms ( see , for instance , mccullagh and nelder , 1989 ) .",
    "it is important to mention that the distribution of residuals in regression models are typically unknown , and therefore all inference regarding these residuals are done by asymptotic assumptions which may not hold in small or moderate sample sizes .",
    "then we can use this knowledge to define corrected pearson residuals in these models in such a way that the corrected residuals will have , to order @xmath109 , the same distribution of the true pearson residuals , which is known .",
    "the corrected residuals have practical applicability for all continuous glms .",
    "we simulate a gamma model with log link to conclude the superiority of the corrected pearson residuals @xmath110 over the uncorrected residuals @xmath35 and also over the adjusted residuals suggested by cordeiro ( 2004 ) with regard to the approximation to the reference distribution , which for the corrected and uncorrected residuals was the distribution of the true residuals and for the adjusted residuals was the standard normal distribution .",
    "the paper is concluded with an application of the corrected residuals to assess the adequacy of the model .",
    "suppose we write the residual @xmath111 in terms of the true residual @xmath112 as @xmath113 , where @xmath112 and @xmath114 are absolutely continuous random variables with respect to lebesgue measure and @xmath114 is of order @xmath115 .",
    "our goal is to define a corrected residual @xmath116 having the same density of @xmath112 to order @xmath0 .",
    "initially , we have @xmath117 expanding @xmath118 in a taylor series around @xmath119 gives @xmath120 let @xmath121 and @xmath122 .",
    "thus , @xmath123 where @xmath124 is the density function of @xmath112 . by using formulae ( 25 ) and ( 26 ) from cox and snell ( 1968 ) with @xmath125",
    ", it is possible to conclude that @xmath126 and var@xmath127 ( and thus @xmath128 ) are of order @xmath36 and , in the same way , that the higher moments of @xmath114 are of order @xmath129 . in a similar manner , we can show that @xmath130 and var@xmath131 are also of order @xmath36 , and that the higher - order conditional moments are of order @xmath129 .",
    "then , we can rewrite equation ( [ expect ] ) as @xmath132 note that we can express the integral on the right side of ( [ expect2 ] ) as a sum of three integrals .",
    "then , integration by parts , one time for the integral containing @xmath133 on the integrand and two times for the integral containing @xmath134 on the integrand , yields the following formula @xmath135dx + o(n^{-1}).\\ ] ] the uniqueness theorem for characteristic functions yields the density of @xmath111 to order @xmath0 @xmath136 equation ( @xmath137 ) is identical to formula ( 5 ) in loynes ( 1969 ) .",
    "further , we now define corrected residuals of the form @xmath138 where @xmath139 is a function of order @xmath36 used to recover the distribution of @xmath112 .",
    "we may proceed as above , noting that @xmath140 , to obtain the density of @xmath116 to order @xmath0 @xmath141 since the quantities @xmath142 and @xmath134 are all of order @xmath36 , we have that @xmath143 to this order .",
    "therefore , the densities of @xmath111 and @xmath112 will be the same to order @xmath0 if @xmath144 integration gives @xmath145 equation ( [ eqloynes ] ) is identical to equation ( 6 ) given by loynes ( 1969 ) and it is clear from the proof that the support of @xmath112 does not need to be the entire line and we can have proper intervals as support .",
    "we should note that the assumptions needed can be made weaker if we require that an expansion of the taylor polynomial of order two with a remainder term ( for instance , lagrange remainder ) can be done instead of the complete series .",
    "we could also prove loynes ( 1969 ) results by using the equivalence of ( 3c ) and ( 4c ) , together with ( 5 ) and ( 6 ) of cox and reid ( 1987 ) and appropriate regularity conditions .",
    "the idea to this approach is as follows : consider in equation ( 3c ) of cox and reid ( 1987 ) @xmath146 , @xmath147 and @xmath148 .",
    "this means that we are writing @xmath149 as @xmath150 , where @xmath112 and @xmath114 are of orders @xmath151 and @xmath115 , respectively .",
    "then , from ( 4c ) , ( 5 ) and ( 6 ) of cox and reid ( 1987 ) , we can write de cdf of @xmath149 as @xmath152 where @xmath153 and @xmath154 are the cdf and pdf of @xmath112 , respectively . the expression above implies equation ( [ densloynes ] ) . we can also obtain the expansion for @xmath155 from the equivalence of ( 3c ) and ( 4c ) of cox and reid ( 1987 ) by setting @xmath156 and @xmath157 . the rest of the proof is identical to the one given before .",
    "note also , that for this proof @xmath112 does not need to have a support in the entire line since this is not an assumption in the usual regularity conditions .",
