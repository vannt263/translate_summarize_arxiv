    "galaxy - galaxy interactions lead to the redistribution of stars and gas about each system , and an infusion of material into the local intergalactic medium , promoting star formation ( @xcite ) .",
    "tidal tails are signatures of galactic mergers ( @xcite ) , illuminated by the ignition of star formation ( @xcite ) .",
    "turbulent energy injected into the local hi through these mergers compresses the gas , forming new stars ( @xcite ) ; this is observationally shown in @xcite , who were able to link the presence of star clusters candidates ( sccs ) to turbulent regions of hi .",
    "while the young , in - situ formed sccs of tidal tails have been studied in the past through imaging and spectroscopy ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) , the composition of the underlying stellar material remains a mystery .",
    "we know that gas is easily extracted from the parent galaxies during interactions ( e.g. @xcite ) , but whether or not stars follow suit has not yet been established .",
    "the extracted gas can collapse to form stars in a clustered manner , yet at the same time , simulations have shown that clusters in tails can be easily disrupted ( @xcite ) .",
    "this sparks an obvious question : what are tidal tails made of ? what is the relative fraction of gas and old stars within the interaction ejecta ?",
    "the answer can inform dynamical simulations of interactions , and therefore help refine our understanding of the enrichment of the intergalactic medium .",
    "in fact , current dynamical simulations ( e.g. @xcite ) use an older stellar component as a gravitational ` anchor ' for the gas .",
    "is this requirement justified by the observations ?",
    "existing studies have focused on the young stellar components of tidal tails , and therefore do not have the capability to probe deep into these regions .",
    "we have developed a new observing program designed to do just this , using deep , photometric _ ugriz _ imaging . to derive an accurate age estimate for a tidal tail",
    ", we plan our exposure times to view across the stellar sequence in our diffuse tidal tail light .",
    "these tails are imaged in each filter to an adequate signal to noise ratio , allowing us to derive an average colour and age of their diffuse light .",
    "this has the additional benefit of allowing us to age date star clusters within the tail .",
    "we choose the twin tidal tails of ngc 3256 as a case study for our method .",
    "the system is relatively nearby at a distance of 38 mpc ( @xcite ) , with an interaction age of 400 myr ( @xcite ) - not so young that our observations will be drowned out by ob stars , yet young enough so that the tidal structure is still visible",
    ". it has been well studied in the past through spectroscopic ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) , photometric ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) and hi ( @xcite ) observations , giving us benchmarks to compare to .",
    "we will begin in section [ sec:2 ] by describing our data and our reduction process . in section [ sec:3 ]",

    "both h@xmath12 and [ o iii ] fall in the _ g_-band , while [ o ii ] is in the _ u_-band . depending on the relative strengths of the oxygen lines , this can cause the @xmath14 colour to become bluer or redder . to show a possible range of nebular emission",
    ", we also include a track setting [ o iii]/h@xmath12 to its 90th percentile value ( 0.66 ) and [ o ii]/h@xmath12 to its 10th percentile value ( 0.22 ) .",
    "this provides a better fit for several data points in the eastern tail , although the position of these clusters on the diagram is likely due to a combination of varying emission line strengths and dust extinction .",

    "but for the eastern tail .",
    "several young objects show strong nebular emission .",
    "19 sccs are detected in the eastern tail , with a median age of 7.96 log yrs . ]    in examining figure [ fig : w_scc_colour ] , we see a clear overdensity of sccs in the western tail compared to objects outside of the tail . in the eastern tail ( [ fig : e_scc_colour ] ) , a number of sccs exist at blue values of @xmath14 and @xmath13 which are distinct from those outside the tail .",

    "results for the total masses and median ages of sccs are shown in table [ table : mass_all ] , with masses and ages shown in figure [ fig : mass_age ] ; dashed lines represent our scc detection limits based on our colour and magnitude criteria from section [ sec : cluster_colours ] .",
    "error bars show the maximum and minimum age and mass for each data point . at low masses ,",
    "there are several points which do not fall within the detection band .",
    "these objects are subject to internal extinction , which dims them to fall within our scc colour and magnitude cutoffs .",
    "there is a gap in age between the young objects in the eastern tail and the main distribution with ages of 8.0 - 8.8 log yrs .",
    "this indicates a recent small burst of isolated star formation in the eastern tail , small enough that only low mass clusters are present .",
    "other similar bursts could have occurred in either tail between 7.0 and 8.0 log yrs , but would have faded from view by the present .",
    "it is clear , however that there is not continuous star formation at the level of that seen during the main interaction period , 8.0 - 8.8 log yrs ago .",

    "the difference in age between the tails is evident in the abundance of younger regions , represented by cyan and yellow , in the western tail , compared to older regions , represented by orange and red , in the eastern tail .",
    "the spatial location of sccs does not appear to influence the colour of the diffuse light .",
    "this is not too surprising , as these objects were masked out in section [ sec : masking ] .",
    "both of the tails show colour gradients across their lengths , with bluer colours near the galactic bulges and redder colours at the far tips . likewise",
    ", the edges of the tails appear redder than their interiors .",

    "the diffuse light colours between the two tails are clearly distinct from one another . the distribution of scc colour in the western tail overlaps its diffuse light colour distribution , suggesting a common origin .",
    "sccs in the eastern tail are much younger than any of the sccs in the western tail . ]",
    "we can summarize figure [ fig : colour_hist ] with the following points :    1 .",
    "the difference in @xmath14 colour between the eastern and western tail shows the total diffuse stellar light of the two tails are separated in age by over 500 myr , with a significantly larger contribution from a young population in the western tail .",
    "2 .   assuming the two tails",
    "were formed at the same time , we find the stellar masses of the eastern and western tails to be dominated by old ( @xmath2210 gyr ) populations drawn from the parent galaxies . 3 .   while the western tail contains a significant old ( @xmath2210 gyr ) population , the stellar light is largely comprised of a population which formed soon after the interaction , with an age of 8.29 log yrs .",
    "the similarity of the @xmath14 colour distribution of sccs in the western tail compared to the diffuse light gives credence to the idea that the western tail is comprised of disrupted star clusters formed shortly after the formation of the tail , with the ones we see today being the ones that survived .",
    "the stark contrast in @xmath14 colours for sccs in the eastern tail as compared to the diffuse light colours suggests some very recent star formation as compared to the age of the tail .",
    "stellar populations in the two tails of ngc 3256 have different compositions .",
    "we base our conclusions on the assumption that the tails were formed at the same time .",
    "it s possible to interpret figure [ fig : lsbphot ] as due to the eastern tail having formed first , with the stellar light we observe being formed from a burst of star formation caused by that earlier interaction . however , prograde collisions between galaxies are required to form tidal tails ( @xcite ; @xcite ) , as in the case of ngc 3256 . in such a case , these tails form simultaneously , which indicates a common age between ngc 3256 s tails .",
    "@xcite found three nuclei within the centre of ngc 3256 , leading them to construct a merger scenario involving two separate mergers and three galaxies .",
    "the eastern tail could be explained to have formed during the first merger , while the western tail formed later with a prograde interaction between the merger remnant and the third galaxy .",
    "however , @xcite suggests a more likely scenario with the two major galaxies initially merging , and a smaller satellite galaxy merging after the major interaction , supported in further work by @xcite .",
    "additionally , @xcite only observed two broad hi tails , leading them to conclude that ngc 3256 is likely created by a two galaxy prograde merger .",
    "given these works , it is very probable that the two tails were formed at the same time .",
    "we also find possible evidence for the small satellite merger in the separate diffuse structure , seen in the western tail . this structure is younger than either tail , supporting the theory of a late minor merger , occurring after the major merger .",
    "the diffuse light in the western tail is dominated by a younger population , formed soon after the formation of the tail .",
    "this population is also present in the eastern tail , although at a lower concentration .",
    "the source of the young population is uncertain , as stars may form in a variety of methods : in bound clusters , unbound stellar associations , down to near individual stellar formation .",
    "the fraction of stars forming in clusters can be up to 70% in regions of large gas density ( @xcite ) . however , these clusters are subject to frequent tidal shocks which will preferentially destroy low mass clusters ( @xcite ) , dispersing their material into the diffuse tidal light and making clusters an ideal candidate for the source of our young population .",
    "the destruction of star clusters is modeled in two parts : number loss ( removal of stars in a cluster ) and mass loss ( removal of mass in a cluster ) .",
    "number loss can be understood as effects from stellar feedback , such as stellar winds and supernovae , which expel gas in a cluster , causing it to become unbound .",
    "mass loss will remove stars from a cluster via two - body interactions .",
    "number loss , also known as infant mortality , will only be important for the first @xmath2210 myr , as the hot and massive stars evolve and explode .",
    "the remnants of these clusters are thus seen as the diffuse light of the tail .",
    "a similar effect is seen in ngc 7714  ages of hii regions within the tidal tails have been shown to be older than star clusters residing within them , suggesting previously formed clusters have been dispersed and surround the newly conceived clusters ( @xcite ) .",
    "the coincidence of peaks in histograms of @xmath14 colour between the diffuse light of the western tail and its sccs ( figure [ fig : colour_hist ] ) strongly suggests the two are intertwined .",
    "results of ks tests show the populations are distinct from each other , however , this is likely due to the presence of an old stellar population in the diffuse light of the tail .",
    "the timescale between tail formation and cluster formation is separated by @xmath22200 myr .",
    "we compare this to simulations of ngc 4038/9 , a similar merger , which found a peak in star formation @xmath2225 myr after the interaction ( @xcite ) .",
    "individual masses of sccs in the western tail are on average more massive than in the eastern tail , as shown in figure [ fig : mass_age ] , although the eastern tail has several very young , low mass objects absent in the western tail .",
    "the greater number of sccs for the western tail can be attributed to its larger hi mass .",
    "this can be related back to the diffuse light as well , as the western tail s higher abundance of gas led it to form more star clusters which could be disrupted and dispersed in the tail .",
    "we compare the ages of our clusters to those found in the nuclei from previous studies .",
    "@xcite spectroscopically studied 23 star clusters inside the centres of the galaxies , finding an average age of @xmath2210 myr . @xcite",
    "performed photometry on several hundred objects within the centre finding bright and blue objects .",
    "our sccs are substantially older than those found within the nuclei , suggesting the star formation in the tails was cut off earlier relative to the interior .",
    "this is consistent with spectroscopic observations of star clusters in the western tail by @xcite and photometric analysis of sccs in the eastern tail by @xcite , both of whom found ages of clusters to be older than those in the interior .",
    "a similar viewpoint is shared in the antennae simulations , which show a cessation of star formation in the tails , while star formation in the interiors is ongoing ( @xcite ) .",
    "star formation in the interiors can be stimulated as material previously thrown out during the initial encounters falls back into the centre of the potential well .",
    "of particular interest are the very young objects found in the eastern tails , with @xmath23 .",
    "these objects indicate relatively recent star formation in a tail whose diffuse light suggests a limited star formation history .",
    "it is possible these objects are now being formed as material falls back through the tail to the interiors , creating turbulence in the hi gas and sparking small bursts of star formation .",
    "we do not see these very young objects in the western tail .",
    "however , note that they are low mass , with masses @xmath24 .",
    "they will fade from detectability as they age ( see figure [ fig : mass_age ] ) ; additionally , they may subject to tidal shocks from regions of dense gas which can disrupt them .",
    "this suggests that there may be small star formation events periodically in both tails , but the evidence of these events will rapidly fade away .",
    "@xcite found that tidal tails with large hi line of sight velocity dispersion @xmath25 and high hi column densities were ideal locations for sccs .",
    "both the 3256 tails fit these criteron , and the majority of their sccs , as determined by @xcite using _ hst _ wfpc2 data , lie in hi pixels with these characteristics .",
    "however , the tails can be distinguished by measurements of shear ( @xmath26 ) , with the western tail s shear about one - third that of the eastern s .",
    "@xcite found that sccs were preferentially located in regions of low shear , which is suggestive that these areas can be ideal for star formation .",
    "we reproduce spatial maps of hi shear from figures 4.18 and 4.19 in @xcite , and compare them to our spatial @xmath14 maps in figure [ fig : e_shear ] for the eastern tail and figure [ fig : w_shear ] for the western tail .    from figure",
    "[ fig : e_shear ] , two pockets of low shear are visible in yellow .",
    "the first of these , closest to the bulge , corresponds to the location of the youngest sccs in the eastern tail , visualized as beige circles .",
    "the second low shear region does not contain any sccs , although the diffuse light near this area is younger than its surroundings .",
    "the western tail has a ridge of low shear seen in figure [ fig : w_shear ] , running from the middle of the tail to the tip .",
    "we find the majority of sccs within the hi field of view reside in this region , with few ( @xmath223 out of 23 ) outside .",
    "the diffuse light appears to follow the shear as well . at the tip of the tail , the low hi shear seen in blue matches the yellow diffuse light boxes . as the shear increases to yellow and orange , the diffuse light reddens and the boxes shift to orange and red .",
    "the effect of dust on the diffuse light in these tails is similar to that of an older population ; in either case the colours are reddened . to investigate this effect , we redden the eastern tail colour to match the western s , by minimizing the distance between the two values .",
    "we find the amount of extinction needed for this is @xmath27 , which we find unrealistic , as tidal tails are regions of relatively low extinction ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "additionally , examination of archival _ galex _ nuv data ( @xcite ) show similar brightnesses for the two tails , suggesting similar levels of low extinction .",
    "extinction in the eastern tail would dim the _ galex _ data , with respect to the western tail , but this is not seen .",
    "@xcite examined the @xmath28 colour distribution within the eastern tail , finding negligible levels of reddening , supporting the lack of dust within the tails .",
    "we finally look at extinction in the three star clusters spectroscopically studied in the western tail from @xcite , which are listed at 0.0 , 0.3 , 0.5 @xmath29 mag , showing minimal extinction . additionally ,",
    "as mentioned in section [ sec : cluster_mass ] , several of our young sccs are subject to internal extinction .",
    "extinction values of these objects range from 1.1 to 0.7 @xmath29 mag .",
    "dust can be expected to associate with star clusters , as dust is needed for star formation , so we expect to see the most extinction in these regions . however",
    ", such levels of extinction exist for a small handful of objects , and as these are masked and do not factor into our lsb measurements , we are lead to believe extinction does not significantly affect our analysis of the stellar age and mass distribution .",
    "our observational program has proven successful in allowing us to characterize the stellar populations of our tidal tails .",
    "we find ngc 3256w to be bluer than its twin tail , ngc 3256e .",
    "measured colours indicate that diffuse light in the western tail has a large contribution from a young population formed after the interaction , perhaps from dispersed star clusters , as compared to the eastern tail , which is primarily illuminated by an old population derived from the host galaxy . both tails exhibit colour gradients along their lengths , suggesting a gradient in the time scale of star formation . despite these colour differences ,",
    "both tails appear to be dominated in mass by an old , underlying population , originating from the interacting galaxies .",
    "analysis of sccs shows a lack of old objects in either tail ( > @xmath30 yr ) , but a clustering of objects below 400 myr in the western tail and eastern tail .",
    "the eastern tail shows an interesting clustering of young objects , with ages < @xmath31 yr . these objects are low mass structures and are not likely to be detected as they age , disappearing as they fade beyond our detection limits , or are dispersed into the tail . the @xmath14 colour distribution of the western sccs is proven to be distinct from the diffuse stellar light in the western tail through ks probability tests , however the peaks of the colour distributions of the diffuse light and sccs match well , suggesting these objects and regions are intertwined . the fact that the ks test shows separate populations can be explained by the addition of an old , underlying stellar population to the diffuse light .",
    "ngc 3256 has been shown in past studies to contain a large number of sccs compared to other systems ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "we plan to apply our current observational program to additional tidal tail systems with varying amounts of sccs and hi properties , particularly those with low numbers of sccs .",
    "the presence of a tidal dwarf galaxy may also play a role in determining the composition of tidal tail diffuse light .",
    "_ galex _ observations of the antennae galaxy reveal a gradient in colour along the tail , with bluer colours near the tip of the southern tail , where two tidal dwarf galaxies reside ( @xcite ) .",
    "@xcite found that tails with tidal dwarfs did not contain as many sccs as those without them .",
    "have these structures already dispersed their clusters into their tails , or has there been a complete absence of star cluster formation ? this remains to be seen .",
