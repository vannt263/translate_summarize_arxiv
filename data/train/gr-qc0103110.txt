    "a problem which still remains unsolved in general relativity is the energy - momentum localization .    although an adequate coordinate - independent expression for energy and momentum density has not given yet , various energy - momentum complexes including those of einstein [ 1]-[2 ] , landau and lifshitz [ 3 ] , papapetrou [ 4 ] , bergmann [ 5 ] , weinberg [ 6 ] and mller [ 7 ] lead to acceptable results for many space - times .",
    "cooperstock [ 8 ] gave his opinion that the energy and momentum are confined to the regions of non - vanishing energy - momentum tensor of the matter and all non - gravitational fields .",
    "also , chang , nester and chen [ 9 ] showed that the energy - momentum complexes are actually quasilocal and legitimate expressions for the energy - momentum .",
    "the above energy - momentum complexes , except that of mller , need to carry out the calculations in `` cartesian coordinates '' .",
    "the results obtained for some well - known space - times are encouraging [ 10]-[25 ] .",
    "aguirregabiria , chamorro and virbhadra [ 15 ] obtained that several energy - momentum complexes `` coincide '' for any metric of the kerr - schild class . in [ 19 ] virbhadra established that several energy - momentum complexes ( ellpw ) comply with the quasi - local mass definition of penrose for a general non - static spherically symmetric metric of the kerr - schild class .",
    "he obtained the expression of the energy distribution for this general metric .    in this paper",
    "we first show that using an adequate coordinate transformation we can express the charged regular black hole ( ayn - beato and garcia , ( abg ) ) [ 27 ] metric in kerr - schild cartesian coordinates .",
    "then we compute the energy distribution in this space - time using the energy expression given by virbhadra [ 19 ] .",
    "the result is the same as we obtained in the einstein prescription [ 26 ] using the schwarzschild cartesian coordinates .",
    "we use the geometrized units @xmath0 and follow the convention that latin indices run from @xmath1 to @xmath2 .",
    "a solution to the coupled system of the einstein field and equations of the nonlinear electrodynamics was recently given by e. ayn - beato and a. garcia ( abg ) [ 27 ] .",
    "this is a singularity - free black hole solution with mass @xmath3 and electric charge @xmath4 .",
    "also , the metric at large distances behaves as the reissner - nordstrm solution .",
    "the usual singularity of the rn solution , at @xmath5 , has been smoothed out and now it simply corresponds to the origin of the spherical coordinates .",
    "this solution is given by the line element    @xmath6    where    @xmath7    if the electric charge vanishes we reach the schwarzschild solution . at large distances ( 1 )",
    "resembles to the reissner - nordstrm solution and can be written    @xmath8    the kerr - schild class space - times have the form    @xmath9    where @xmath10 is the minkowski metric .",
    "@xmath11 represents the scalar field and @xmath12 is a null , geodesic and shear free vector field in the minkowski space - time .",
    "we also have    @xmath13    aguirregabiria , chamorro and virbhadra [ 15 ] showed that for the space - times of the kerr - schild class the energy - momentum complexes of einstein , landau and lifshitz , papapetrou and weinberg `` coincide '' .",
    "we use the transformation    @xmath14    and we get    @xmath15    also , we obtain    @xmath16    using ( 8) the line element ( 1 ) becomes    @xmath17    that is the static case of the general non - static spherically symmetric space - time of the kerr - schild class used by virbhadra [ 19 ] to calculate the energy distribution with the energy - momentum complexes of einstein , landau and lifshitz , papapetrou and weinberg ( ellpw ) .",
    "now , with the transformations    @xmath18    the metric given by ( 9 ) can be written    @xmath19 ^ 2 .",
    "\\label{1.11}\\ ] ]    for ( 11 ) we have @xmath20 and @xmath21 .",
    "we evaluate the energy using the expression obtained by virbhadra [ 19 ] , ( see eq .",
    "( 31 ) therein ) , in the case of a general non - static spherically symmetric space - time of the kerr - schild class , and which is the same in the ( ellpw ) prescriptions .",
    "our case is the static case , which is a special case of the metric considered by virbhadra .",
    "we get    @xmath22    we obtain for the energy distribution of the abg black hole    @xmath23    and    @xmath24    also , for ( 14 ) we can write    @xmath25    where the term @xmath26 represents the energy of the reissner - nordstrm solution that corresponds to the penrose [ 28 ] quasi - local mass definition .",
    "we define @xmath27 , @xmath28 and @xmath29 and we have @xmath30 .",
    "we plot the expression of @xmath31 in the figure 1 ( @xmath31 on y - axis is plotted against @xmath32 on x - axis , for @xmath33 ) .",
    "bondi [ 29 ] gave his opinion that a nonlocalizable form of energy is not admissible in relativity .",
    "for the charged regular black hole solution given by ayn - beato and garcia we make a coordinate transformation that allow us to evaluate the energy distribution using the expression of the energy obtained by virbhadra [ 19 ] ( see eq .",
    "( 31 ) therein ) , for a general non - static spherically symmetric space - time of the kerr - schild class .",
    "the new form of the ( abg ) metric is a special static case of the metric considered by virbhadra [ 19 ] .",
    "the energy distribution depends on the mass @xmath34 of the black hole and electric charge @xmath35 . also , the result is the same as we obtained [ 26 ] in the einstein prescription using the schwarzschild cartesian coordinates .",
    "our result sustain the viewpoint of virbhadra [ 19 ] that the einstein energy - momentum complex is the most adequate to evaluate the energy distribution of a given space - time .",
