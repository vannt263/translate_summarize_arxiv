    "in particle and nuclear physics intensity interferometry provides a direct experimental method for the determination of sizes , shapes and lifetimes of particle - emitting sources ( for recent reviews see @xcite ) .",
    "in particular , boson interferometry provides a powerful tool for the investigation of the space - time structure of particle production processes , since bose - einstein correlations ( bec ) of two identical bosons reflect both geometrical and dynamical properties of the particle radiating source .    for our analysis",
    "we use a sample of about 500 thousand two - jet events , selected by the durham algorithm @xcite with @xmath1 , from e@xmath2e@xmath3annihilation data collected by l3 at a center - of - mass energy of 91.2 gev .",
    "the two - particle correlation function is defined as : @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the two - particle invariant momentum distribution , @xmath6 the single - particle invariant momentum distributions and @xmath7 the four - momentum of particle @xmath8 . since we are only interested in bec , the product of single particle densities is replaced by the so - called reference sample , @xmath9 , the two - particle density that would occur in the absence of bose - einstein interference . here",
    "we use mixed events as a reference sample@xcite .    after some assumptions @xcite , this two - particle correlation function is related to the fourier transformed source distribution . in this case @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the invariant four - momentum difference , @xmath12 and @xmath13 is the fourier transform of the density of the source , @xmath14 .",
    "the simplest assumption is that the source has a symmetric gaussian distribution , in which case @xmath15 and @xmath16              \\left ( 1 + \\delta q \\right),\\ ] ] where the parameter @xmath17 is a constant of normalization , @xmath18 is an intercept or incoherence factor , which measures the strength of the correlation , and @xmath19 is introduced to parametrize possible long - range correlations not adequately accounted for in the reference sample .",
    "a fit of eq.([gauss ] ) to the data results in an unacceptably low confidence level @xcite from which we conclude that the shape of the source deviates from a gaussian .",
    "the fit is particularly bad at low @xmath11 values .",
    "adopting nolan s @xmath20 convention @xcite for the symmetric lvy stable distribution with rescaling of the scale parameter @xmath17 to @xmath21 and the location parameter @xmath22 to @xmath23 , the fourier transform ( characteristic function ) @xmath24 has the following general form : @xmath25 the index of stability , @xmath26 , satisfies the inequality @xmath27 .",
    "the case @xmath28 corresponds to a gaussian source distribution . for more details",
    "see @xcite .",
    "then @xmath29 has the following , relatively simple form @xcite : @xmath30            ( 1 + \\delta q).\\ ] ] after fitting eq.([symlev ] ) to the data it is clear that the correlation function is far from gaussian : @xmath31 . the confidence level ,",
    "although improved compared to the fit of eq.([gauss ] ) , is still unacceptably low @xcite .",
    "a model of strongly correlated phase - space was developed @xcite to explain the experimentally found invariant relative momentum @xmath11 dependence of bose - einstein correlations in @xmath32 reactions .",
    "this model also predicts a specific transverse mass dependence of @xmath29 , that we subject to an experimental test here . in this model , it is assumed that the average production point @xmath33 of particles with a given momentum @xmath34 is given by @xmath35 in the case of two - jet events , @xmath36 , where @xmath37 is the longitudinal proper - time and @xmath38 is the transverse mass .",
    "the second assumption is that the distribution of @xmath39 about its average , @xmath40 , is narrower than the proper - time distribution .",
    "then the emission function of the @xmath0-model is @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the longitudinal proper - time distribution , the factor @xmath43 describes the strength of the correlations between coordinate space and momentum space variables and @xmath44 is the experimentaly measurable single - particle spectrum . in the plane - wave approximation the yano - koonin formula",
    "@xcite gives the following two - pion multiplicity distribution : @xmath45 \\right).\\ ] ] approximating the @xmath46 function by a dirac delta function , the argument of the cosine becomes @xmath47 then the two - particle bose - einstein correlation function is obtained as @xmath48 where @xmath49 is the fourier transform of @xmath42 .",
    "thus an invariant relative momentum dependent bec appears .    guided by the result of the previous section",
    ", we use a one - sided lvy distribution for the longitudinal proper - time density .",
    "the corresponding bec function has an analytic form @xcite : @xmath50    b %         ( 1+\\delta q_{\\mathrm{inv } } ) , % \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the parameter @xmath51 is the proper - time of the onset of particle production , @xmath52 is a measure of the width of the proper - time distribution , @xmath53 and @xmath54 .",
    "assuming that particle production starts immediately and defining an effective radius , @xmath21 , @xcite @xmath29 simplifies to @xmath55             \\exp \\left(-(rq)^{2\\alpha } \\right ) \\right ] ( 1 + \\delta q),\\ ] ] where @xmath56 is related to @xmath21 by @xmath57 .",
    "the fit of eq.([asymlev ] ) to the data is statistically acceptable @xcite .",
    "the data are well described by the fit . for @xmath11 between 0.5 @xmath58 and 1.5 @xmath58",
    "the data points go below the level of the long - range correlations extrapolated to lower @xmath11 values .",
    "these data points indicate an anti - correlation in the @xmath59 gev region .",
    "this property of the data is well reproduced by the fitted curve , which also goes below unity as a result of the cosine term in eq.([asymlev ] ) , which comes from the asymmetric lvy assumption .    after fitting eq.([big_tau ] ) for various @xmath60 intervals",
    "we find that the quality of the fits is statistically acceptable and the fitted values of the model parameters are stable and within errors the same in all investigated @xmath61 intervals , confirming the @xmath61-dependence predicted by the @xmath0-model .",
    "the @xmath0-model with a one - sided levy proper - time distribution describes the data with parameters @xmath62 fm , @xmath63 and @xmath64 fm ( the difference in @xmath61 of the two pions is required to be less than 0.2 @xmath58 ) .",
    "in order to reconstruct the space - time picture of the emitting process we assume that the emission function can be factorized in the following way : @xmath65 where @xmath66 is the single - particle transverse distribution , @xmath67 is the space - time rapidity distribution of particle production , which approximately coincides with the single - particle rapidity distribution , and @xmath42 is the observed proper - time distribution .    with these assumptions one can reconstruct the longitudinal part of the emission function integrated over the transverse distribution .",
    "it is plotted as a function of @xmath68 and @xmath69 in fig .",
    "[ longemis ] .",
    "it exhibits the typical boomerang shape with a maximum at low @xmath68 and @xmath69 but with tails reaching out to very large @xmath68 and @xmath69 values .",
    "the transverse profile , which follows from eq . ( [ source ] ) , is given by @xmath70 this equation describes the particle production in coordinate space as a function of the proper - time @xmath0 .",
    "it describes the expansion of the source as the proper - time increases .",
    "the particle production probability is proportional to the proper - time distribution @xmath42 .",
    "[ movie ] shows the transverse part of the emission function for various proper - times .",
    "particle production starts immediately , increases rapidly and decreases slowly .",
    "a ring - like structure , similar to the expanding , ring - like wave created by a pebble in a pond , is reconstructed from l3 data , as shown in fig .",
    "an animated gif file that shows this effect is available from @xcite .",
