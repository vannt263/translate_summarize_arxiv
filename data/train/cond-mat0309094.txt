    "in recent decades , elucidation of unconventional superconductivity in strongly correlated electron systems ( sces ) has been one of the central issues both in experimental and theoretical research fields of condensed matter physics .",
    "as is well known , sces form a vast category , including varieties of materials such as transition metal oxides , molecular conductors , and @xmath4-electron compounds . here",
    "we briefly introduce these superconducting materials in this order .    among transition metal oxides ,",
    "cuprate superconductors have certainly attracted the most attentions of researchers in the condensed matter physics since the discovery in 1986 @xcite , due to the high superconducting transition temperature @xmath2 as well as several kinds of anomalous behaviors in the electronic properties .",
    "in fact , the high-@xmath2 cuprate is one of main targets of this review article .",
    "it is emphasized here that varieties of superconducting materials have been also discovered in other transition metal oxides .",
    "especially , sr@xmath0ruo@xmath1 @xcite with isostructure of la@xmath0cuo@xmath1 ( the parent compound of high @xmath2 superconductors ) exhibits the superconductivity with triplet pairing , which has been confirmed by nuclear magnetic resonance ( nmr ) measurements @xcite .",
    "the ruthenate has attracted attentions in spite of its low @xmath2 as large as 1.5k , since it is one of rare materials that show triplet superconductivity in the solid state .",
    "the ruthenate will be also discussed in detail in this review article .",
    "in addition to @xmath3-electron systems , materials composed of atoms with lighter mass are also the member of sces . in general , those are called molecular conductors , including organics and fullerides . in 1980 ,",
    "( tmtsf)@xmath0pf@xmath5 has been discovered as the first organic superconductor @xcite , which has triggered the vigorous experimental researches on these materials .",
    "a characteristic issue of the molecular conductors is that it is possible to construct artificial molecule by controlling the synthesis in the atomic level .",
    "then , much effort has been made to elevate @xmath2 by using several techniques to synthesize new molecular superconductors .",
    "let us turn our attentions to @xmath4-electron materials including rare - earth or actinide ions .",
    "the pioneering discovery of superconductivity in the heavy fermion material cecu@xmath0si@xmath0 @xcite has triggered the rapid increase of investigations on exotic properties of @xmath4-electron superconductivity , leading to a chain of further discoveries of superconductivity in uranium and cerium compounds .",
    "as we will review in sec .  5 ,",
    "numbers of new superconducting materials in heavy fermion systems have been discovered in recent years .",
    "here it is noted that new superconducting states such as coexisting one with magnetic orders are increasing .    even in the above brief survey",
    ", there are several kinds of superconductors categorized in sces .",
    "it is quite natural for experimentalists to make the research field rich , as a result of high activities to synthesize new superconducting materials .",
    "however , the purpose in the theoretical research is not to pursue the variety in materials , although at some stage it is necessary to investigate a particular material as a typical example .",
    "there should exist a universal picture to explain the common essence in all sces .",
    "a task imposed on theoreticians is to unveil this universal concept , and to clarify the interesting aspects in materials .",
    "we believe that we have arrived at a unified view on the superconductivity in sces .",
    "thus , the main purpose of this review article is to convey this viewpoint by showing explanations for typical materials .    before proceeding to the clarification of our unified viewpoint ,",
    "let us consider first the conditions on the theory of superconductivity in sces . without any restrictions , the present review article may be just the exhibition of previous theories for sces .",
    "the most exotic possibility for the superconducting mechanism was superconductivity due to single - electron condensation , but the experimental results on the unit of magnetic flux in high-@xmath2 materials have confirmed that the existence of cooper - pair in high-@xmath2 cuprates @xcite . also in heavy - fermion superconductors , the existence of cooper - pair has been experimentally confirmed .",
    "those are quite important , since the basic point of the bcs theory for superconductivity are invariant even for sces .",
    "thus , in this review , issues on exotic superconductivity based on the non cooper - pair formation are simply ignored .",
    "furthermore , here we clarify our strategy to understand the electric properties in the normal state before discussing the pairing mechanism . in the normal state of strongly correlated materials , `` anomalous '' metallic behaviors have been frequently observed .",
    "namely , behaviors of physical quantities are sometimes deviated from those understood from the fermi - liquid theory . especially in high-@xmath2 cuprates ,",
    "such `` anomalous '' bahaviors have provided many challenging issues and stimulated much interests .",
    "indeed , the understanding of the `` anomalous '' metallic state is one of the central issues in this review .",
    "one way to explain such non fermi - liquid behaviors is , of course , to pursue the non fermi - liquid ground state , appearing due to the combined effects of strong correlation and low dimensionality .",
    "in fact , as is well known in one dimension , there appears the tomonaga - luttinger liquid state , essentially different from the fermi - liquid state , due to the restriction in the phase space of one dimension .",
    "no doubt is cast on the results in one dimension and we know that there exist several approaches based on the non fermi - liquid ground state in order to understand the anomalous normal - state properties of strongly correlated metals . however , it should be noted that non fermi - liquid behaviors do @xmath6 immediately indicate the breakdown of the fermi - liquid theory in strongly correlated materials with two or three dimensionality .",
    "we believe that the fermi - liquid state is a good starting point to understand the non fermi - liquid behaviors in some compounds .",
    "if there is no discontinuity from the fermi - liquid state , the deviation from the fermi - liquid behaviors should be derived from such a starting point . in this review",
    ", we will actually explain the non fermi - liquid behaviors from this point of view , but it is worth while to stress here that the fermi - liquid state is a robust concept in two or three dimensions",
    ". the essential issue of the fermi - liquid state is the continuity principle , which means that quasi - particles can be obtained by the adiabatic continuations from the non - interacting systems .",
    "even if the overlap between bare electron state and dressed quasi - particle state is vanishingly small like in @xmath4-electron materials , the continuity principle can be still effective .    here",
    "readers may have a naive question in their minds : then , how to understand anomalous behaviors in the normal state ?",
    "first note that the conventional fermi - liquid bahaviors may be restricted to the very low - temperature region , even if the ground state is a fermi liquid .",
    "such a situation is considered to be realized in some heavy - fermion compounds , owing to a strong renormalization of the fermi energy .",
    "even if the quasi - particle renormalization is not so strong like in high-@xmath2 cuprates , this situation can be caused by some kinds of fluctuations , which give corrections to the fermi - liquid behaviors .",
    "the latter effect possibly appears more significantly , when the long - range order exists in the ground state .",
    "since the fermi - liquid state is eventually destroyed by the long - range order , it is quite natural that the fermi - liquid behaviors are altered by its precursor , namely , by the fluctuation .",
    "we will attribute the non fermi - liquid behaviors in the high-@xmath2 cuprates and some organic superconductors to the latter origin .",
    "in particular , the superconducting ( sc ) fluctuation as well as the anti - ferromagnetic ( af ) spin fluctuation should be taken into account . in those compounds , the effects of such fluctuations",
    "are significantly enhanced owing to quasi - two - dimensionality .",
    "the effective inclusion of fluctuations in the fermi - liquid state will lead to understandings of anomalous behaviors in the normal state .",
    "a trial to take into account the effect of af spin fluctuations in the fermi - liquid normal state has been developed for a long time , since the af insulating phase can be ubiquitously found in strongly correlated materials .",
    "the af fluctuations are especially important near the phase boundary between metallic and af insulating phases .",
    "for instance , the self - consistent renormalization ( scr ) theory developed by moriya and co - workers is one of the powerful methods to include effects of spin fluctuations , but the details will be simply skipped , since readers can consult with the textbook @xcite .",
    "it is commented here that the af spin fluctuation theory should be interpreted as an extension of the fermi - liquid theory @xcite , which is called `` nearly anti - ferromagnetic fermi - liquid theory '' at present .",
    "the af spin fluctuation is actually effective in high-@xmath2 cuprates , in which the nmr and neutron scattering measurements have clearly observed the spin fluctuations . for example , the anomalous temperature dependence of the electric resistivity is explained by including the af spin fluctuation .",
    "interestingly , the cross - over from the conventional @xmath7-square to the anomalous @xmath7-linear resistivity has been observed in tl - based cuprate superconductors @xcite , which occurs together with the enhancement of the af spin fluctuation .",
    "then , a coherent understanding is obtained by extending the fermi - liquid theory to take into account the af spin fluctuation .",
    "such a continuity clearly indicates that the theory based on the fermi - liquid picture is quite useful and effective for strongly correlated systems .",
    "another effort has been devoted to include the effect of sc fluctuations .",
    "this is closely related to the most challenging issue in the``anomalous '' metallic state , the pseudogap phenomenon , which is focussed in this review . among many theoretical proposals suggested before",
    ", we will introduce an understanding based on the sc fluctuation .",
    "since high-@xmath2 cuprates and organic superconductors have the superconducting ground state , it is expected that the sc fluctuation should be active in these materials at least near the phase transition .",
    "it has been common knowledge that the sc fluctuation is usually negligible , but the recent theoretical efforts , which has been stimulated by the recent experimental results , have revealed the importance of the sc fluctuation for the electronic properties .",
    "we will clarify the condition for the appearance of the sc fluctuation and show that the condition is actually satisfied in high-@xmath2 cuprates and some organic superconductors .",
    "then , the precursor of the phase transition destroys the fermi - liquid state and induces the excitation gap .",
    "many aspects of the anomalous properties , including the magnetic and transport properties , are successfully explained by starting from the fermi - liquid state and taking into account appropriately the effect of af spin fluctuation and/or sc fluctuation @xcite , as will be explained in sec .  4 in details .",
    "the scenario based on the fermi - liquid theory is rather simple , but the simple and unified scenario makes it easy to understand anomalous behaviors in sces .",
    "now our footing of this review article becomes clear , and the next point is how to clarify the mechanism of the cooper - pair formation . first it is emphasized that a couple of quasi - particles form the cooper - pair .",
    "typically , in heavy - fermion superconductivity , the cooper - pair is composed of heavy quasi - particles themselves , as confirmed by the large jump in the specific heat at @xmath2 .",
    "the investigation of pairing mechanism is reduced to the determination of the residual interaction among quasi - particles .",
    "as easily understood , non @xmath8-wave pairing should appear for superconductivity in highly correlated systems due to the effect of strong short - range coulomb interaction .",
    "in fact , anisotropic cooper - pair has been found in common in strongly correlated superconductors , experimentally suggested by the power - law behavior of physical quantities in the low - temperature region .",
    "the value of the power sensitively depends on the node structure of the gap function on the fermi surface . thus , by analysing carefully the temperature dependence of physical quantities in experiments , it is possible to deduce the symmetry of the cooper - pair under the group - theoretical restriction .",
    "the phenomenological theory , which is not focused in this review , plays an important role for the determination of the pairing symmetry .",
    "since the superconducting transition is the second - order phase transition even for sces , the ginzburg - landau theory has been still applicable to those systems , by paying due attentions to the symmetry of cooper - pair as well as the group - theoretical restrictions on the crystal structure .",
    "in fact , there have been significant advances in the phenomenological understandings on unconventional superconductivity without special knowledge on the mechanism of cooper - pair formation @xcite . in particular ,",
    "when the degeneracy remains in the internal degree of freedom in the triplet superconductor , the phenomenological ginzburg - landau theory has been quite useful to identify the pairing symmetry .",
    "when ones tried to discuss the microscopic aspects of the mechanism of unconventional superconductivity , again af spin fluctuations were considered to play crucial roles to induce singlet @xmath3-wave superconductivity , consistent with the node structure in high-@xmath2 cuprates .",
    "indeed , the theory based on the af spin fluctuations has provided many important understandings in high-@xmath2 superconductors , as will be explained later . however , in order to arrive at the unified understanding of superconductivity in sces , more general viewpoint should be considered , since the pairing potential originating from the residual interaction among quasi - particles is @xmath6 always dominated by the spin fluctuations .",
    "the most general conclusion is that the origin of the cooper - pair formation is the momentum dependence of the residual interaction .",
    "we believe that this point of view is important for the comprehensive understanding of superconductivity in sces including high-@xmath2 cuprates .    a clear example for our belief can be found in the triplet superconductivity confirmed in some @xmath3- and @xmath4-electron systems such as sr@xmath0ruo@xmath1 and upt@xmath9 @xcite . in order to understand the triplet pair formation",
    ", one may naively consider the effect of ferromagnetic spin fluctuations , which was proposed for the origin of spin - triplet superfluidity in @xmath10he .",
    "however , in the triplet superconductors , paramagnons are @xmath6 always dominant in the spin fluctuation spectrum .",
    "the ruthenate sr@xmath0ruo@xmath1 is a typical example .",
    "we have found that the incommensurate af spin fluctuation is enhanced , as observed in the neutron scattering experiment @xcite .",
    "then , in contrast to the naive expectation , paramagnons do @xmath6 seem to play a central role in the occurrence of triplet superconductivity .",
    "in such a case , we have to consider the momentum dependence of the residual interaction from the general point of view .",
    "as we will discuss in detail in this review , it is possible to explain triplet as well as singlet superconductivity , in addition to several anomalous behaviors in the normal state , based on the microscopic hamiltonian , leading to the unified picture for unconventional superconductivity in sces .    for the purpose , it is indispensable to choose appropriately the method for the calculation .",
    "one is the application of numerical techniques such as exact diagonalization and quantum monte carlo simulations .",
    "there is a clear advantage that in principle we can include the effect of electronic correlation correctly , but in the exact diagonalization , the size of the model is severely restricted due to the limitation in computer memory .",
    "also in the quantum monte carlo simulations , it is quite difficult to increase the strength of correlation because of the negative sign problem and the system size is still restricted . on the other hand , recently developed technique such as density matrix renormalization group method is very powerful to analyze quantum systems even with frustrations .",
    "however , the target material is essentially limited to the one - dimensional system , even though it may be possible to treat ladder - like compounds .",
    "complementary to the numerical method , another traditional technique is the quantum field theory , or more specifically , the green s function method , based on the assumption that it is allowed to perform the perturbation expansion in terms of the interaction .",
    "it is an advantage that we can calculate , in principle , physical quantities in the thermodynamic limit , while it is inevitable to resort to approximations for actual calculations , since it is quite difficult to carry out the exact calculation based on the green s function method .",
    "another important advantage is that the physical picture is to be clarified . in this article , we focus on the green s function technique and the results obtained by this method .",
    "it matches our principle based on the fermi - liquid theory .",
    "we will introduce an understanding obtained by the combination of the numerical techniques and the green s function approaches @xcite , but the techniques of numerical methods will not be introduced in this review article .",
    "readers consult with other review articles regarding those issues ( see , for instance , ref .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "next , we need to define a microscopic model hamiltonian . in this paper",
    ", the hubbard hamiltonian will be focussed , since it is widely recognized as a canonical model for sces , although for @xmath4-electron systems , we need to pay due attentions for its application .",
    "we will also consider the multi - orbital hubbard model , in which orbital degree of freedom of @xmath3 electrons is explicitly included , especially for the analysis of ruthenate . for the purpose to study electronic properties of sces , ones sometimes considered the so - called @xmath11-@xmath12 model , obtained by the strong - coupling expansion in the hubbard or @xmath3-@xmath13 model .",
    "the prohibition of double occupancy at each site is imposed on the model , which is an essential point to include the strong correlation effect in the @xmath11-@xmath12 model .",
    "since the hilbert space becomes smaller than that of the hubbard model , the @xmath11-@xmath12 model has been frequently used for the analysis based on numerical techniques . however , in the green s function method or even in simpler mean - field calculations , it is difficult to include correctly the prohibition of double occupancy .",
    "thus , results and analysis on the @xmath11-@xmath12 model are out of the scope of this review article .",
    "readers interested in the @xmath11-@xmath12 model can also consult with other previous review papers @xcite .    in this review article",
    ", then we will show the unified picture to understand unconventional superconductivity in sces based on the fermi - liquid framework by using the hubbard ( or hubbard - like ) hamiltonian and the green s function method .",
    "the calculations will be done based on the dyson - gorkov equations @xcite , composed of normal and anomalous green s functions to characterize the normal and superconducting states .",
    "formally those are the coupled equations , related by the irreducible four - point vertex functions representing the interaction processes among quasi - particles . depending on the effective strength of the interaction , we change our approaches to evaluate the four - point irreducible vertex .    for the weak correlation systems ,",
    "we adopt the third - order perturbation theory with respect to the on - site coulomb interaction @xmath14 @xcite . by solving the linearized dyson - gorkov equations",
    ", we can determine @xmath2 , which will well reproduce the critical temperatures for cuprates from overdoped to optimally doped regions .",
    "moreover , this perturbation theory gives reasonable values of @xmath2 also for organic superconductors @xmath15-type ( bedt - ttf)@xmath0x @xcite .",
    "the symmetry of these two superconductors is considered to be the @xmath3-wave one from various experimental results .",
    "theoretical calculations also predict the @xmath3-wave symmetry .",
    "in addition to the above results , it should be stressed that the perturbation theory gives also a reasonable explanation of the mechanism of triplet superconductivity in sr@xmath0ruo@xmath1 @xcite .",
    "the third - order terms in the vertex function play main roles in realizing the triplet superconductivity . note that these terms are @xmath6 attributed to the contribution from the spin fluctuations .",
    "this fact is in sharp contrast with the spin fluctuation mechanism adopted in cuprates , while it is consistent with the absence of paramagnon peak in neutron diffraction experiments on ruthenate .    for the intermediate coupling systems such as optimally doped cuprates , we adopt the fluctuation - exchange ( flex )",
    "approximation @xcite to evaluate the irreducible four - point vertex parts .",
    "this theory based on the spin fluctuations has been developed by many groups and used to give reasonable value of @xmath2 for the @xmath3-wave superconductivity .",
    "we confirm the reliability of these calculations by comparing the flex and the third - order perturbation calculations with each other . from the above calculation",
    "we conclude that the momentum dependence in the effective interaction between quasi - particles originating initially from the on - site coulomb repulsion @xmath14 induces the superconductivity .",
    "the flex approximation is again used for the analysis of the anomalous properties in the normal state . in order to take into account the effect of the superconducting fluctuations , the flex approximation is modified to be combined with the t - matrix approximation . by using this flex + t - matrix approximation",
    ", we develop a microscopic theory on the sc fluctuation and analyze the under - doped cuprates .",
    "the organization of this review article is as follows . in sec .  2",
    ", experimental review will be provided regarding high-@xmath2 cuprates , organic superconductors , and ruthenate .",
    "the interests from the theoretical point of view will be also explained . as is easily understood",
    ", those materials should include millions of references , and it is almost impossible to cite all papers .",
    "thus , we will refer several papers , which will be relevant to the later theoretical discussions . in sec .  3 ,",
    "theoretical results are reviewed based on the green s function techniques .",
    "first we introduce some basic equations which will be needed for the later analysis .",
    "then , the results for cuprates , organic superconductors , and ruthenate will be discussed in this order . in sec .",
    "4 , as a typical result in the anomalous normal - state properties of high-@xmath2 cuprates , pseudogap phenomena will be discussed somewhat in detail . in sec .  5 , after the brief review of experimental results on @xmath4-electron superconductors , we will discuss the mechanism of superconductivity in heavy - fermion materials . in sec .",
    "6 , we summarize this review article . in appendix",
    "a , the correct derivation of the generalized fermi - liquid theory on the london penetration depth is presented and we provide our picture to understand the so - called uemura plot by taking account of the quasi - particle interaction . in appendix b , the convergence of the perturbation expansion with respect to @xmath14 is examined by calculating the forth - order terms .",
    "the convergence is satisfactorily good for @xmath3-wave pairing cases , while for @xmath13-wave pairing cases @xmath2 shows oscillatory behavior depending on the calculated order . by summing up the ladder diagrams up to infinite order",
    ", we can eliminate this oscillation and recover the convergence also for @xmath13-wave pairing case .",
    "the discovery of high-@xmath2 cuprates @xcite was a trigger of the intensive studies on superconductivity in strongly correlated electron systems ( sces ) .",
    "the theoretical efforts stimulated by high-@xmath2 superconductivity have clarified many basic properties of strongly correlated materials .",
    "especially the understanding of the quasi - two - dimensional system has been developed .",
    "high-@xmath2 cuprates have the perovskite - type crystal structure and the parent compounds are the mott insulators with anti - ferromagnetic ( af ) order .",
    "carrier doping into this mott insulating state induces high-@xmath2 superconductivity , which essentially occurs in the two - dimensional ( 2d ) cuo@xmath0 plane .",
    "note here that both hole and electron dopings induce superconductivity @xcite . from the early stage of the research , high-@xmath2 cuprates",
    "have been recognized to be one of sces @xcite .",
    "now the cuprate is confirmed to be the most established unconventional superconductor .",
    "namely , it is predominantly believed that cooper - pairs with @xmath16-wave symmetry originates from the electronic mechanism .",
    "we can understand also several normal - state anomalous properties such as @xmath7-linear electric resistivity @xcite and strongly enhanced af spin correlation @xcite , considering the effect of strong electron correlation . in the following , we survey these experimental results on unconventional superconductivity and anomalous normal - state properties in high-@xmath2 cuprates .",
    "first let us see the results on pairing symmetry , since the symmetry of the cooper - pair is an important issue to consider the superconducting mechanism .",
    "the non-@xmath8 wave pairing is a direct evidence for the unconventional superconductivity . according to the crystal symmetry of the square lattice composed of copper and oxygen ions ,",
    "the pairing symmetry is classified as @xmath8-wave , @xmath17-wave , @xmath18-wave , and so on . among them , in the theoretical point of view , the appearance of the conventional @xmath8-wave superconductivity is suppressed , because the strong on - site repulsion easily destroys the @xmath8-wave pairing .",
    "in fact , the theoretical studies on the electron correlation have predicted the @xmath17-wave symmetry : for instance , in the literatures , we find several works based on the rpa @xcite , scaling theory @xcite , variational method @xcite , and quantum monte carlo simulation @xcite . in 80 s , however , the many experimental results supported the @xmath8-wave symmetry .",
    "only a few experiments including the nmr measurement have supported the @xmath3-wave superconductivity @xcite .",
    "this discrepancy has been clearly resolved by the intensive investigations in 90 s , which have demonstrated the various evidence for the anisotropic gap structure with line node @xcite .",
    "some deviations from the clean @xmath3-wave superconductivity has been explained by taking account of the strong impurity scattering @xcite . finally , the phase - sensitive measurements have clearly confirmed the @xmath17-wave symmetry @xcite .",
    "nowadays the momentum dependence of the excitation gap is directly observed in the angle resolved photoemission spectroscopy ( arpes ) , where the line node appears in the diagonal direction of @xmath19 @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , the pairing symmetry in electron - doped systems has not been settled for a long time , because node - less behaviors were reported by several groups @xcite .",
    "however , recent experiments have finally concluded that the electron - doped systems are also the @xmath17-wave superconductors @xcite .",
    "also in this case , crucial roles have been played by the phase - sensitive measurement @xcite and arpes @xcite .",
    "these results seem to be natural , since from the theoretical point of view , the same pairing mechanism is expected both for hole- and electron - doped materials .",
    "note , however , that interesting particle - hole asymmetry has been found in some aspects .",
    "for instance , in electron - doped systems , we have observed that ( i ) the transition temperature is relatively low , ( ii ) the superconducting region in the phase diagram is narrow , and ( iii ) the af order is robust in comparison with hole - doped compounds .",
    "later in this review , this asymmetry will be discussed in our theoretical approach by considering the detailed electronic structure .",
    "now we can conclude that the issues on the paring symmetry in high-@xmath2 cuprates have been settled . in the next stage ,",
    "the following two issues are especially important .",
    "one is , of course , the pairing mechanism for high-@xmath2 cuprates .",
    "this theoretical subject will be discussed in sec .",
    "particularly we focus on the intensive studies from the microscopic point of view , which have opened a new way to understand the superconductivity in sces .",
    "another issue is to explain the anomalous properties in the normal state , which is one of the main points of this review .",
    "this subject will be discussed in detail in sec .  4 with our main interests on the pseudogap phenomena . as for the latter problem ,",
    "intensive experimental investigations have been performed and lots of important results have been piled up .",
    "thus , here we survey the experimental results on the normal - state properties in the following subsections @xcite .      before proceeding to the review of normal - state properties of high-@xmath2 cuprates ,",
    "it is instructive to explain first the outline of the @xmath7-@xmath20 phase diagram .",
    "both the theoretical and experimental investigations have been focussed on the hole - doped systems , but recently , the electron - doped systems also have been studied intensively .",
    "then , the whole phase diagram as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : high - tcphasediagram2 ] has been clarified .",
    "let us see some characteristic points of this phase diagram in the following .    in general , the properties of high-@xmath2",
    "cuprates are controlled by the carrier doping concentration @xmath20 , which is defined as @xmath20=1@xmath21 and @xmath22 is the carrier number per copper site .",
    "the system is the af mott insulator at half - filling ( @xmath20=0 ) and the af order is easily destroyed by the slight amount of hole - doping ( @xmath20@xmath230 ) .",
    "then , there appears the metallic phase with the superconducting ground state .",
    "the transition temperature @xmath2 takes its maximum value ( @xmath24100k ) at the optimally - doped region ( @xmath20@xmath240.15 ) and decreases in the over - doped region .",
    "here it is stressed that anomalous behaviors in the normal - state properties are significant from the optimally - doped to the under - doped region , although the meaning of `` anomalous behavior '' will be discussed in detail in the following subsections . as indicated by thin and thick dashed curves in fig .",
    "[ fig : high - tcphasediagram2 ] , there exist two characteristic temperatures , determined from the several experimental results .",
    "one is @xmath25 , shown by the thin dashed curve , a temperature at which the af spin correlation begins to develop with decreasing temperature .",
    "for instance , the nmr @xmath26 and hall coefficient @xmath27 increase from the temperature @xmath28 .",
    "another characteristic temperature is @xmath29 , indicated by the thick dashed curve .",
    "this is a temperature for the onset of the opening of pseudogap , observed in arpes , nmr @xmath26 , tunnelling measurements , and so on .",
    "the enormous investigations have been dedicated to the clarification of the pseudogap because this issue has been regarded as a central problem in high-@xmath2 superconductors .",
    "note that these experiments have indicated some similarities between the pseudogap and superconducting gap .",
    "we consider that the sc fluctuation becomes apparent around @xmath7=@xmath30 .",
    "as shown in sec .  4 ,",
    "our interests on the pseudogap phenomena are concerned with this lower cross - over curve .",
    "note also that somewhat uncertainty may be included in the definitions of @xmath25 and @xmath30 , since two curves just denote the cross - over temperatures , not the phase transition .",
    "nevertheless , we believe that the above classifications are useful to understand the anomalous properties in a coherent way .",
    "as already mentioned , the electron - doped systems ( @xmath20@xmath310 ) are also superconducting",
    ". however , some different features from hole - doped ones are observed , as explained in the previous subsection .",
    "for instance , the af order is robust for the carrier doping in these systems and superconductivity occurs in the narrow doping region with relatively low transition temperature .",
    "especially , in the normal metallic state , the pseudogap phenomena and the under - doped region have _ not _ been observed in electron - doped systems . in secs .  3 and 4 ,",
    "we provide our understanding of the phase diagram including this particle - hole asymmetry .",
    "as is well known , nmr and neutron scattering measurements are the powerful methods to investigate spin correlations .",
    "these experiments have played crucial roles to reveal that the magnetic properties in the high-@xmath2 cuprates are `` anomalous '' in many aspects . here",
    "let us summarize these anomalous behaviors in the normal state .",
    "first we emphasize that the pseudogap phenomenon has been first discovered in the nmr measurements @xcite .",
    "as shown in fig .",

    "these behaviors are consistent with the transport properties in the normal state .",
    "the power of the temperature dependence of @xmath75 is larger than unity in the low - temperature region @xcite .",
    "the origin of this nature is in common with the incoherent c - axis conductance in the pseudogap state .",

    "the london constant just below @xmath2 shows a rapid growth rather than that obtained in the bcs theory @xcite .",
    "this is regarded as an appearance of the critical fluctuation .",
    "the critical behavior of the 3d - xy universality class has been confirmed @xcite . this clear appearance of the sc fluctuation supports the pairing scenario on the pseudogap phenomena .",
    "the growth of @xmath75 below @xmath2 is more rapid than that of @xmath63 @xcite .",

    "simultaneously , this continuity confirms the applicability of the spin fluctuation theory in the optimally - doped region .",
    "next we discuss the effect of the normal self - energy .",
    "we can see from fig .",
    "[ fig : various ] that the value of @xmath2 is reduced by the de - pairing effect . because the reduction factor is about a half in the top , the same order of the magnitude of @xmath2 still remains , even if the de - pairing effect is considered .",
    "the realistic value @xmath2=0.01@xmath24100k is found around @xmath247=3.2 , where @xmath80=0.4 . on the other hand",
    ", @xmath2 is remarkably reduced in the topwovc , since the rpa terms intensify each other and give rise to a large self - energy . indeed ,",
    "the rpa terms in the normal self - energy are considerably compensated by the vertex correction .",
    "this is the reason why the reduction of @xmath2 is moderate in the top .",
    "the third - order terms in the normal self - energy completely cancels each other in the particle - hole symmetric case , namely @xmath248=0 for @xmath249 and @xmath250 .",
    "the remained contribution in the particle - hole asymmetric case rather reduces the quasi - particle damping ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : damping ] ) . as a result",
    ", the value of @xmath2 in the top can be higher than that in the topwovc owing to the de - pairing effect .",
    "thus , it is generally expected that the normal self - energy is overestimated in the spin fluctuation theory , and thus , the magnitude of @xmath2 is underestimated .",
    "finally , we show the doping dependence of @xmath2 in fig .",
    "[ fig : tc ] . for simplicity , here we ignore the normal self - energy , which is not important to see the qualitative behavior within the top . if @xmath251 , @xmath2 takes the maximum value just at half - filling , because both the staggard susceptibility @xmath252 and the electronic dos becomes largest at @xmath20=0 . by introducing the next nearest - neighbor hopping ,",
    "the peak position is shifted to the hole - doped region .",
    "this is mainly due to the fact that the dos takes its maximum value in the hole - doping side , since the fermi surface crosses the van hove singularity .",
    "these features will again appear in the flex approximation .",
    "it is considered that the spin fluctuation plays an important role in the optimally- and under - doped region , where the strong enhancement of the spin fluctuation is observed @xcite . since the perturbation theory is not sufficient to describe the strong spin fluctuation ,",
    "some approximation beyond the top is required .",
    "a simple microscopic theory on the spin fluctuation is the rpa , but the tendency of the magnetic order is seriously overestimated in the rpa .",

    "[ fig : nmr ] ( see also @xcite ) . applying the flex approximation to the hubbard model @xcite or @xmath3-@xmath13 model @xcite ,",

    "the higher - order corrections beyond the flex approximation will be discussed in the next subsection .",
    "it should be mentioned that the accuracy in the quantitative estimation from the microscopic level is still questionable , because the flex approximation is also a partial summation of the perturbation series .",
    "however , we consider that the flex theory has a robust meaning as a semi - phenomenological theory , since the effect of spin fluctuations is qualitatively well grasped in this approximation .",
    "moreover , it is noted that unphysical results inherent in the phenomenological theory are considerably excluded .",
    "the flex approximation is one of the conserving approximation , formulated in the scheme of baym and kadanoff @xcite ( see eqs .",

    "the superconducting transition is determined by solving the liashberg equation , eq .",

    "then , the expressions are similar to those of the phenomenological theory with @xmath192 replaced by @xmath14 .",

    "the flex approximation was first performed by bickers et al .",
    "@xcite for the 2d hubbard model with only the nearest - neighbor hopping .",
    "they have shown that the af order exists near the half - filling and the @xmath16-wave superconductivity occurs in the vicinity to the af state .",
    "after that , intensive studies on the hubbard model @xcite and on the @xmath3-@xmath13 model @xcite have commonly obtained the @xmath16-wave superconductivity .",
    "we show the momentum dependence of the static spin susceptibility in fig .",
    "[ fig : kaiflex ] , where the results for the optimally - doped , under - doped , and electron - doped cases are shown .",
    "it is observed that the spin fluctuation is strongly enhanced around @xmath258 .",
    "thus , the @xmath16-wave superconductivity is mainly induced by the scattering process shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fs ] .",
    "the order parameter is deformed , but similar to the conventional form @xmath259 , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : phifs ] . since the scattering process between the zone boundary region ( the circle in fig .",
    "[ fig : fs ] ) plays a dominant role , the order parameter takes large absolute value around @xmath36=0 or @xmath260 .",
    "this deformation is in agreement with the experimental results of arpes @xcite .",
    "we show the results of @xmath2 for the hubbard model and those for the @xmath3-@xmath13 model in figs .",
    "[ fig : electron - dope ] and [ fig : takimoto ] , respectively .",
    "figure [ fig : electron - dope](a ) shows the results for the electron - doped case , together .",
    "in general , the transition temperature increases with the development of the spin fluctuation , namely with decreasing @xmath20 and/or increasing @xmath14 .",
    "in contrast to the top , @xmath2 tends to saturate near the magnetic instability , since the de - pairing effect becomes stronger in that region .",
    "the maximum value of @xmath2 is commonly obtained as @xmath261 @xcite , which is consistent with the experimental value @xmath187 in order of magnitude .",
    "it is straightforward to extend the flex approximation to the superconducting state .",
    "actually , the calculation has been performed for the hubbard model @xcite and for the @xmath3-@xmath13 model @xcite .",
    "the ratio @xmath262 is commonly obtained , which is much larger than the bcs value @xmath263 .",
    "this is mainly due to the feedback effect on the spin fluctuation : since the de - pairing effect is remarkably reduced by the finite excitation gap , the order parameter at @xmath58 exceeds the bcs value .",
    "this feature is qualitatively consistent with the experimental value @xmath264 in the optimally - doped region .",
    "this value is over - estimated in the flex approximation probably because the de - pairing effect around @xmath150 is over - estimated ( see sec .",
    "3.2.3 ) .",
    "the other interesting property in the superconducting state is the resonance peak .",
    "when the system is near the magnetic order , a sharp resonance peak appears in the magnetic excitation with a smaller energy than the maximum gap @xmath265 @xcite .",
    "it is considered that the resonance peak corresponds to the @xmath266 peak observed in the neutron scattering experiments in yba@xmath0cu@xmath9o@xmath267 @xcite .",
    "the influence of the resonance peak appears in the dip - hump structure in the quasi - particle spectrum and `` kink '' in the quasi - particle dispersion around @xmath268 @xcite , which is also consistent with the arpes measurements @xcite .",
    "finally let us review the application of the flex approximation to the electron - doped cuprates which has been recently performed @xcite .",
    "the flex approximation also indicates the @xmath16-wave superconductivity in the electron - doped region , which has been confirmed by the recent experiments @xcite .",
    "moreover , the drastic particle - hole asymmetry in the phase diagram @xcite is explained simply by taking account of the next - nearest - neighbor hopping @xmath239 and choosing the electron number . in general , the electron correlation is relatively weak in the electron - doped region , because the electronic dos decreases with electron - doping .",
    "therefore , more conventional behaviors are expected in the normal state @xcite .",
    "the detailed discussion will be given in sec .",
    "4.3.2 . on the other hand ,",
    "the af order is robust for the carrier doping ( fig .",
    "[ fig : electron - dope](a ) ) because of the nesting property of the fermi surface , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fermi ] . an interesting nature of the af state appears in the electron - doped region @xcite , which has been well explained by the numerical calculation on the @xmath11-@xmath239-@xmath12 model @xcite .",
    "more interestingly , the superconducting @xmath2 is very low and the doping region possessing the superconductivity is narrow @xcite .",
    "this is understood by the following two reasons : one is the localized nature of the spin fluctuation in the momentum space ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : kaiflex ] ) .",
    "then , the total weight of the spin fluctuation becomes small .",
    "it should be noted that the effective interaction @xmath269 is not determined by the magnetic correlation length .",
    "the other is the small dos due to the fact that the fermi level is apart from the flat dispersion around @xmath268 .",
    "thus , the effective coupling @xmath270 decreases in the electron - doped region , and thus , @xmath2 becomes low .",
    "these features are consistent with the experimentally observed phase diagram @xcite , and lead to the no appearance of the pseudogap phenomena ( see sec .",
    "4.3.2 ) .",
    "another interesting feature is the strong modulation in order parameter .",
    "namely , the order parameter has its maximum magnitude around the magnetic brillouin zone .",
    "this is an inevitable result of the spin fluctuation - induced superconductivity , because the commensurate spin fluctuation ( fig .",
    "[ fig : kaiflex ] ) induces the strongest interaction between the magnetic brillouin zone .",
    "recent raman scattering measurement has supported this modulation of the order parameter @xcite .",
    "such a detailed consistency supports the importance of the spin fluctuation in the electron - doped cuprates .    summarizing",
    ", some detailed and interesting properties including the particle - hole asymmetry are well reproduced by the microscopic theory starting from the fermi - liquid state .",
    "we consider that this is an important suggestion for the wide applicability and possibility of the microscopic theory for other strongly correlated electron materials .",
    "in fact , secs .  3.3 and 3.4 are devoted to the application to the organic superconductor and sr@xmath0ruo@xmath1 , respectively .",
    "thus far , we have not provided any explicit justification of the spin fluctuation theory and/or the flex approximation .",
    "they correspond to a partial summation in the perturbation series .",
    "the role of the neglected terms is not clear .",
    "needless to say , an absolute work on this problem is very difficult .",
    "however , several types of the higher - order corrections have been estimated and the positive results have been obtained to some extent .    on the basis of the perturbation theory ,",
    "the corrections first appear in the third - order terms , which have been discussed in sec .",
    "there are two types of the correction in the effective interaction .",

    "we furthermore find that the reduction from the two terms is nearly the same magnitude .",
    "this effect from the diagrams in figs .",
    "[ fig:3rddiagrams](e ) and ( f ) is natural , because they are the lowest - order vertex correction included in the kanamori - type t - matrix diagram ( fig .",

    ", the higher - order correction represented by the t - matrix was approximately estimated by bulut et al .",
    "they have concluded that the bare interaction @xmath271 is renormalized to @xmath272 , where @xmath273 denotes the renormalized interaction .",
    "the coupling constant @xmath192 in the phenomenological theory , and further @xmath14 in the flex approximation should be regarded as the renormalized coupling constant including the screening effect .",
    "the combination of the diagrammatic techniques and the quantum monte carlo simulation has shown that the effective pairing interaction and the spin susceptibility are consistently obtained by the generalized rpa , where the renormalized particle - hole vertex @xmath274 is used @xcite .",
    "the renormalized vertex in the intermediate coupling region @xmath247=4 is estimated as about 80% of @xmath14 , namely @xmath275 .",
    "then , the expression for the effective pairing interaction , given by @xmath276 provides an appropriate estimation , when the renormalized coupling constant @xmath277 is used with the spin susceptibility , obtained by the quantum monte carlo simulation .",
    "these results have indicated that the other scattering process , such as the multi - paramagnon exchange ( see fig .  [ fig : vc](b ) ) , is negligible at least in the high - temperature region @xmath278 .",
    "we find the other intensive investigations on the higher - order corrections , namely , the vertex correction arising from the spin fluctuation @xcite .",

    "the strong cancellation of the effective vertex between the fermion and spin fluctuation was suggested by schrieffer @xcite .",
    "his suggestion raised a serious question on the spin fluctuation - induced superconductivity , but it was just based on the mean - field theory in the sdw state . on the contrary , the studies in the normal state with diffusive spin fluctuation have commonly concluded that the vertex correction represented in fig .",

    "the explicit calculation is difficult , but the enhancement of @xmath2 has been suggested commonly .    it should be noted that the diagrams in figs .",
    "[ fig:3rddiagrams](g ) and ( h ) provide an opposite contribution , i.e. , reduce the effective vertex .",
    "this is because only the longitudinal component of the spin fluctuation appears in the the vertex correction within the top .",
    "the transverse component appears in the higher - order correction and changes the sign .",
    "combined with the corrections included in the t - matrix ( fig .",

    "most of the above proposals are classified into the spin - fluctuation theory .",

    "for example , ( tmtsf)pf@xmath5 is considered to be the case , where the possibility of not only the @xmath3-wave pairing , but also the triplet pairing has been proposed @xcite . the present microscopic calculations @xcite seem to indicate the predominance of the @xmath3-wave superconductivity .",
    "we believe that the development of the microscopic theory for organic materials is one of interesting future issues .",
    "now let us review the theoretical investigations on sr@xmath0ruo@xmath1 with main interests on the pairing mechanism , since interestingly this material is confirmed to be a triplet superconductor ( see sec .",

    "the electronic structure of @xmath230 is relatively simple , deduced from such points as two - dimensional fermi surfaces , a few degenerate orbitals , weak spin - orbit coupling , and relatively weak electron correlation .",
    "thus , both from experimental and theoretical points of view , @xmath230 is considered to be a typical compound for the microscopic investigation on the triplet superconductivity , which will provide new understanding on the unconventional superconductivity .      referring to the successes for the pairing mechanism in cuprates and @xmath10he ,",
    "the spin fluctuation - induced superconductivity was examined for sr@xmath0ruo@xmath1 at the first stage .",
    "several authors discussed the ferromagnetic spin fluctuation , which can induce the triplet @xmath13-wave superconductivity @xcite ( see the last in sec .",
    "along this line , mazin and singh have insisted that ferromagnetic spin fluctuation is sufficiently strong to induce the triplet superconductivity in this compound @xcite .",
    "monthoux and lonzarich discussed the @xmath13-wave superconductivity by phenomenologically introducing the ferromagnetic spin fluctuation in a square lattice model @xcite .",

    "neutron scattering measurement by sidis _",

    "af fluctuation has been observed at the wave vector @xmath310 @xcite .",
    "this incommensurate spin fluctuation is due to the fermi surface nesting effect , as predicted by the band calculation with the use of local - density approximation ( lda ) @xcite and also derived from simpler models @xcite . under those circumstances",
    ", it has been proposed that the triplet superconductivity is possibly derived by assuming the strong anisotropy of the af spin fluctuation @xcite .",
    "the experimental support for the strong anisotropy has been obtained from the nmr measurement @xcite , but according to the recent neutron scattering experiment by servant et al .",
    "@xcite , the spin susceptibility is very isotropic at @xmath311 .",
    "this discrepancy should be resolved experimentally .",
    "theoretically , such anisotropy arises from the spin - orbit interaction in the ru ions @xcite .",
    "it should be commented that the significant exchange enhancement is needed to explain the anisotropy observed in nmr measurement .",
    "note also that the effective interaction in the cooper channel does not coincide with the observable spin susceptibility , when the spin - orbit interaction is explicitly taken into account @xcite .",
    "thus , more explicit calculation is required for this scenario in the present stage .",
    "takimoto has proposed that the orbital fluctuation is important for the triplet superconductivity in sr@xmath0ruo@xmath1 @xcite .",
    "this type of fluctuation is similarly due to the nesting effect of the fermi surface .",
    "he estimated the pairing interaction by using the rpa on the three - band model and obtained the following results : ( i ) the instability to the @xmath4-wave superconductivity is generally derived by the rpa .",
    "( ii ) the @xmath90 and @xmath91 bands are mainly superconducting .",
    "( iii ) the strong orbital fluctuation is necessary for the triplet pairing to overcome the singlet one .",
    "( iv ) as a result , the triplet superconductivity is stabilized , when the inter - orbital repulsion is larger than the intra - orbital one . among them , the condition for ( iv ) is difficult to be satisfied and thus , somewhat convincing evidence may be needed for the scenario based on orbital fluctuations .",

    "@xcite and @xcite are summarized in the following : ( i ) the non - rpa terms neglected in the fluctuation theory are significantly attractive in the @xmath13-wave channel .",
    "these terms are the same ones discussed in the two - dimensional fermi gas model @xcite , while the singularity in the isotropic model disappears in the hubbard model .",
    "( ii ) the irreducible spin susceptibility derived from the @xmath92 band shows rather weak momentum dependence .",

    "the results of the perturbation theory and their differences from the @xmath3-wave superconductors are discussed in the next subsection .",
    "the failure of the spin - fluctuation theory will be clarified there .",
    "recently , honerkamp and salmhofer found the @xmath13-wave superconducting phase in the single - band hubbard model on the basis of the one - loop renormalization group theory @xcite . they have adopted a band structure similar to that of the @xmath92 band . according to their results",
    ", it seems that the momentum dependence of the effective interaction is not dominated by the ferromagnetic spin fluctuation .",
    "rather it is similar to the one obtained within the naive third - order perturbation theory , in spite of the adjacent ferromagnetic phase .",
    "note that this renormalization group analysis has an advantage that the magnetic , pairing , and the other instabilities can be treated on an equal footing .      in this subsection",
    "the results on the perturbation theory are reviewed .",
    "first let us show the results on the single - band hubbard model corresponding to the @xmath92 band @xcite . referring to the fact that the @xmath92 band has the largest dos , we assume that the superconductivity is mainly determined by the @xmath92 band",
    ". this assumption will be justified later from the results on the three - band model .",
    "the @xmath92 band is mainly constructed from the ru@xmath312 and o2p orbitals , which hybridize each other . since the correlation effect is dominated by the coulomb interactions at the ru sites , the hubbard model eq .",
    "( [ eq : hubbard - model ] ) can be a reasonable starting point .",
    "this simplification of the model is similar to the case of high-@xmath2 cuprates , where the @xmath3-@xmath13 model is reduced to the hubbard model . for ruthenate ,",
    "the dispersion relation is given as @xmath313 due to the wave function of the 4d@xmath314-orbitals , the sign of the next - nearest neighbor hopping is opposite to the case of cuprates .",
    "note that the unit such as @xmath315 is used in this subsection .    in fig .",
    "[ fg : pdtc ] , we show @xmath2 obtained by the top for the @xmath13- and @xmath17-wave superconductivity .",
    "we can see that the triplet pairing is more stable than the singlet one for the electron filling @xmath316 , corresponding to the case of sr@xmath0ruo@xmath1 @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the singlet pairing gives higher @xmath2 near the half - filling .",
    "this is because the af component of the spin fluctuation is enhanced and induces the @xmath17-wave superconductivity .",
    "the latter situation corresponds to the case of cuprate superconductors .",
    "thus , the electron number away from the half - filling is essential for the appearance of the triplet superconductivity . the transition temperature in the triplet channel increases with the electron number .",
    "this trend is consistent with the recent experiment @xcite .",
    "this @xmath22-dependence of @xmath2 is dominated by the effective interaction @xcite , not by the electronic dos .",
    "let us explain the detailed roles of the respective terms in the perturbation expansion @xcite .",
    "it should be noted that the rpa terms cancel each other and do @xmath6 appear in the third - order term of @xmath317 ( eqs .",
    "( [ eq : third - anomalous - triplet])- ( [ eq : third - anomalous - triplet - vc ] ) ) .",
    "that is , all of the third - order terms are non - rpa terms . in the present case ,",
    "both the second- and third - order terms are attractive in the triplet channel .",
    "namely , the rpa- and non - rpa terms cooperatively induce the triplet superconductivity .",
    "in contrast to high-@xmath2 cuprates , however , the contribution from the rpa term is not large , since the momentum dependence of @xmath318 is insignificant . on the other hand ,",
    "the momentum dependence of the third - order terms are particularly attractive .",
    "figure [ fg : comparison - p - wave ] shows the development of the eigenvalue of the liashberg equation in various calculations .",
    "we can see that the contribution from the third - order terms is important even in the moderately weak - coupling region ; it overcomes the contribution from the second - order term around @xmath319 , where the experimental @xmath320 is obtained .",
    "thus , an important role of the non - rpa terms is expected for the appearance of the triplet superconductivity .",
    "we have confirmed that the averaged magnitude of the third - order term is still 1/3 of the second - order term in this region , which does not contradict with the perturbative treatment adopted here .",
    "the effect of the higher - order corrections will be discussed in appendix b.    on the other hand , the rpa gives the observed value of @xmath321 only in the vicinity of the mean - field magnetic instability ( @xmath322 ) .",
    "this is mainly because the rpa term is not so suitable to the triplet pairing and the magnetic order is significantly overestimated in the rpa .",
    "it is also important that the contribution from the magnetic fluctuation to the triplet pairing is 1/3 of that to the singlet pairing ( see eqs .",
    "( [ eq : anomalous - rpa - singlet ] ) and ( [ eq : anomalous - rpa - triplet ] ) ) . note that this situation is not improved in the flex approximation , as is shown in the figure .",
    "this is mainly because the de - pairing effect is very strong , when the spin fluctuation has a local nature , namely , nearly @xmath323-independent .",
    "we have pointed out in sec .",
    "3.2 that the de - pairing effect is usually overestimated in the flex approximation , which is quite serious for the @xmath92 band just due to the local nature of the spin fluctuation . also from this reason ,",
    "the spin fluctuation theory is not suitable for the @xmath92 band .",
    "in fact , the @xmath90 and @xmath91 bands provide larger value of @xmath149 in the flex approximation at @xmath324 , where the spin susceptibility has a sharp peak around @xmath325 .",
    "the obtained @xmath149 in this case is shown in fig .",
    "[ fg : comparison - p - wave ] , but too small to lead to the observed value such as @xmath321 .",
    "these comparisons with the spin fluctuation theory indicate the importance of the non - rpa term .",
    "the results of the perturbation theory have supported this indication .",
    "note that the top is the lowest - order theory for the non - rpa terms .    here",
    "we comment on the roles of the perturbative terms in the singlet channel .",
    "they are qualitatively the same as in the previous subsections for high-@xmath2 cuprates and organic superconductors .",
    "however , there is one significant difference ; the third - order term is totally repulsive in the @xmath219-wave channel .",
    "that is , the vertex corrections completely suppress the rpa terms in the third order .",
    "it is expected that the spin - fluctuation theory loses its justification in this case .",
    "the electron filling far from the half - filling is also essential for this conclusion .",
    "we have compared in detail the stability of the @xmath13-wave , @xmath219-wave , and @xmath326-wave superconductivity @xcite .",
    "we found that the @xmath219-wave symmetry is most stable within the sop , but the @xmath13-wave symmetry becomes stable owing to the third - order terms even in the rather weak - coupling region ( @xmath327 ) . note that if we increase the electron number furthermore , the @xmath13-wave symmetry is most stable even in the sop .",
    "in other words , the parameter region stabilizing the triplet superconductivity is obtained in the lowest - order theory and it is much enlarged in the top .    in the next stage ,",
    "the discussion is extended to the three band model @xcite , given by @xmath328 where @xmath329 is written as @xmath330 with the spin - orbit coupling term @xmath331 the coulomb interaction term @xmath332 is given by @xmath333 where @xmath334 denote the wannier states @xmath335 corresponding to the ru@xmath336 orbitals .",

    "this is the physical background by which the theoretical approach based on the single - band model is justified . the approximate treatment for the mixing term @xmath351 is simultaneously justified , because this term only couples the @xmath90 and @xmath91 bands .",

    "thus , the second phase transition observed under the parallel magnetic field is not the rotation of the @xmath3-vector .",
    "this phenomenon may be a transition within the two - dimensional representation @xmath404 or that of the vortex configuration .",
    "our estimation indicates that the @xmath3-vector can be altered by the small magnetic field along the @xmath200-axis , since the splitting of the degeneracy is small .",
    "while the @xmath405 is small in this direction as @xmath406tesla , our estimation for splitting of the degeneracy corresponds to the magnetic field @xmath407tesla .",
    "since our estimation includes ambiguity in the order unity , the @xmath3-vector perpendicular to the @xmath200-direction is possible in the high - field region .    in the next stage , we compare several pairing states from the viewpoint of the internal degree of freedom . assuming the pairing symmetry and the main band , we investigate which pairing state is stabilized in the respective case .",
    "then , the `` symmetry breaking interaction '' is microscopically estimated within the lowest order .",
    "we believe that this semi - phenomenological comparison is meaningful , for which the applicability of the perturbation theory may be wider .",
    "this is because the perturbation series of the `` symmetry breaking interaction '' has smaller coefficient than the total effective interaction .",
    "the obtained results will restrict the possible pairing symmetry , which is consistent with the time - reversal symmetry breaking @xcite .",
    "we restrict the discussion to the two - dimensional model , because the three - dimensional pairing state is hardly promising .",
    ".stabilized state for each symmetry and main band . [ cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     the obtained results are summarized in table  [ tab : symmetry - d - vector - relation ] , where the stabilized state is shown for each pairing symmetry .",
    "we see that the chiral state is stabilized _ only when _ the symmetry is the @xmath13-wave and the main band is @xmath92 .",
    "the other paring states including the @xmath4-wave symmetry @xcite provide other @xmath3-vector , which is incompatible with the time - reversal symmetry breaking .",
    "after all , it is concluded that the most favorable pairing state is the @xmath13-wave on the @xmath92-band , as expected in the perturbation theory . in other words ,",
    "the perturbation theory provides the probable pairing symmetry and furthermore the compatible @xmath3-vector along the @xmath98-axis .",
    "here we point out that our systematic treatment for the spin - orbit interaction is necessary to discuss the internal degree of freedom .",
    "the spin - orbit interaction contributes to the symmetry breaking interaction through ( i ) the virtual process in the effective interaction and ( ii ) the unitary transformation of the quasi - particles .",
    "when the chiral state is stabilized , the dominant contribution comes from the cross - term of ( i ) and ( ii ) .",
    "thus , we have to treat the two effects on the same footing .",
    "the estimation of the effect ( i ) only @xcite or the effect ( ii ) only @xcite may be inadequate in the microscopic theory .",
    "we should further mention that the effective interaction derived here is quite different from the phenomenological assumption in ref .",
    "indeed , the chiral state is not stabilized , if we take account of only the effect ( ii ) .    at the last of this section , we comment on the heavy - fermion superconductor @xmath308 , which is a spin - triplet superconductor exhibiting three different superconducting phases under the magnetic field .",
    "the phase diagram has been explained by assuming the weak spin - orbit interaction @xcite because this assumption is necessary to explain the nmr knight shift @xcite .",
    "however , this assumption has raised a serious question , since the spin - orbit coupling is generally strong in the heavy - fermion system @xcite .",
    "we think that the result obtained here gives a clue to this question .",
    "it has been shown that the hund s coupling term is required for the violation of the su(2 ) symmetry in the @xmath3-vector space .",
    "on the contrary , the su(2 ) symmetry in the real spin space is violated even for @xmath408 ; the spin susceptibility is anisotropic , for example .",
    "therefore , the violation of the su(2 ) symmetry can be much smaller in the @xmath3-vector space than in the real spin space .",
    "in other words , it is possible that the anisotropy is almost absorbed in the character of the quasi - particles , and only a weak anisotropy is remained in the residual interaction .",
    "the examination of this possibility for @xmath308 will be an interesting future issue .",
    "in this section , we discuss the normal - state properties of high-@xmath2 cuprates . as we have noted in the review of the experimental results in sec .  2.1 @xcite , many anomalous aspects of the normal state have been central issues of high-@xmath2 superconductors .",
    "we should clarify the nature of the normal state , because the comprehensive understanding of the whole phase diagram is highly desirable . among them , the pseudogap phenomena , which are widely observed in the optimally- to under - doped region ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : high - tcphasediagram2 ] ) , have attracted much interests .",
    "since the superconductivity arises through the pseudogap state in optimally- and under - doped systems , the resolution of the pseudogap state is an essential subject for the high-@xmath2 superconductivity .",
    "furthermore , the pseudogap phenomena have many interesting aspects , because they are in sharp contrast to the conventional fermi - liquid theory @xcite .",
    "the unusual nature has indicated an appearance of a new concept in the condensed matter physics .",
    "the introduction of our understanding on this issue is one of the purposes of this review . among many theoretical proposals ,",
    "we have adopted the `` pairing scenario '' in which the pseudogap is a precursor of the superconducting ( sc ) gap .",
    "this scenario has been indicated by several experimental results , as have been explained in sec .",
    "since there are several kinds of `` pairing scenario '' , we will explain later them somewhat in detail to avoid confusion . before introducing the pairing scenarios , we briefly review other scenarios , which have been widely investigated .",
    "an interesting proposal is the appearance of the rvb state @xcite .",
    "historically , the rvb theory was proposed for the quantum spin system with frustration @xcite .",
    "motivated by the high-@xmath2 superconductivity , the superconductivity arising from the rvb state has been investigated intensively @xcite .",
    "naively speaking , the spin - liquid state is the underlying state which results in the superconductivity if holes are lightly doped . among the several descriptions ,",
    "the slave - boson method for the @xmath11-@xmath12 model has been widely used @xcite . in this theory , two essential excitations , spinon and holon ,",
    "appear in the mean - field level and couple through a gauge field .",
    "the pseudogap state is regarded as a singlet pairing state of the spinons and the superconductivity is described as bose - einstein condensation ( bec ) of the holons",
    ". some characteristics of the pseudogap state as well as the whole phase diagram are reproduced within the mean - field theory .",
    "the electric transport is explained by taking account of the u(1 ) gauge field @xcite .",
    "the gauge - field theory has been extended to the su(2 ) symmetry @xcite .",
    "these approaches are essentially from the mott insulating state .",
    "the metallic state is described as a `` doped mott insulator '' .",
    "this starting point is contrastive to our approach from the fermi - liquid state .",
    "another class of the proposal is the `` hidden order scenario '' , where some long - range order exists in the pseudogap state .",
    "for example , the anti - ferromagnetism @xcite and the `` stripe '' order @xcite have been proposed as candidates . recently , `` the @xmath3-density wave '' has been proposed as a new type of the long - range order @xcite . if a finite value of some `` hidden '' order parameter is confirmed experimentally , the corresponding scenario will be the best candidate , but it is not the case up to now .    in other class of the scenarios , a fluctuation of the order parameter",
    "is considered as an origin of the pseudogap .",
    "the fluctuation - induced pseudogap has been investigated from the old days @xcite .",
    "then , the ( quasi- ) one - dimensional peierls transition was mainly investigated @xcite . since any long - range order does not exist at finite temperature , an extraordinary wide critical region is expected in one dimension .",
    "the pseudogap in the spectrum is expected as a precursor of the long - range order .",
    "this mechanism may be generally expected in the low - dimensional system .",

    "@xcite on the basis of the fluctuating `` stripe '' state . in the emery s proposal ,",
    "the proximity effect from the insulating region induces the spin gap .",
    "now let us introduce the pairing scenarios , which are classified into some kinds . because this concept is adopted in this review , a detailed explanation is given , including the related theories .",
    "the superconducting phase transition is usually described by the bcs theory which is an established mean - field theory .",
    "as is well known , the superconducting correlation does not appear above @xmath2 within the mean - field theory .",
    "therefore , we have to consider the breakdown of the bcs theory in order to discuss the pairing scenario .",
    "there are following two origins for the breakdown .",
    "one is the strong - coupling superconductivity and the other is the low - dimensionality .",
    "the justification of the bcs theory is based on the long coherence length , which is @xmath409 in the conventional superconductors and makes the fluctuation negligible . however , the strong - coupling nature of the superconductivity results in the short coherence length , which causes the softening of the fluctuation . here",
    ", the coupling of the superconductivity is indicated by the parameter @xmath410 , which determines the coherence length in the clean limit . note that the non-@xmath8-wave superconductivity is always clean .",
    "here , @xmath59 is the transition temperature in the mean - field theory and @xmath411 is the fermi energy renormalized by the electron correlation .",
    "the fluctuation is generally enhanced by the low - dimensionality . in the strictly two - dimensional case , @xmath2 is always zero according to the mermin - wagner theorem , expect for the kt transition .",
    "then , wide critical region is expected even in the weak - coupling case .",
    "while the three - dimensional long - range order occurs owing to the inter - layer coupling , the quasi - two - dimensionality induces the strong fluctuation .",
    "these two conditions are surely satisfied in the high-@xmath2 cuprates , where @xmath412 .    the first proposal of the pairing scenario was based on the nozi@xmath413res and schmitt - rink ( nsr ) theory @xcite , where the central subject is the cross - over problem from the bcs superconductivity to the bose - einstein condensation ( bec ) . in the weak - coupling region ,",
    "the cooper - pairing and phase coherence occur at the same time according to the bcs theory .",
    "in contrast to that , in the strong - coupling limit , the fermions construct pre - formed bosons above @xmath2 and the bec occurs at @xmath2 .",
    "the latter situation is called `` real space pairing '' in contrast to the `` momentum space pairing '' in the bcs theory . the cross - over of two regions",
    "was first formulated at @xmath58 by leggett @xcite and extended to the finite temperature by nozi@xmath413res and schmitt - rink @xcite . after that , the application to the two - dimensional system has been investigated @xcite .",
    "these two regions are continuously described by adjusting the chemical potential .",
    "we note that this argument does not prohibit the phase transition .",
    "the first - order phase transition with phase separation has been reported in the dynamical mean - field theory @xcite .",
    "the nsr theory at finite temperature takes the lowest - order correction to the thermodynamic potential ( @xmath414 ) , which is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : nozieres ] .",
    "the particle number is obtained as @xmath415 , where @xmath416 is the usual fermion contribution and @xmath417 is the contribution from the fluctuation , namely @xmath418 .",
    "the chemical potential is set below the conduction band in the strong - coupling region .",
    "then , the fermionic excitation is fully gapped even in the anisotropic superconductivity @xcite . in this limit",
    ", the system is regarded as a bosonic system with residual interactions .",
    "it should be noted that the nsr theory is basically justified in the low - density system , since the shift of the chemical potential is the leading effect in the low - density limit .",
    "when the bcs - bec cross - over was proposed for the pseudogap phenomenon @xcite , the pseudogap state was regarded as a cross - over region .",
    "the strong - coupling limit is evidently not relevant for cuprates , because the excitation is clearly gapless along the diagonal direction .",
    "note here that this picture is adopted in the phenomenological theories which assume the coexistence of the fermions and bosons @xcite . by taking advantage of this proposal ,",
    "intensive studies have been devoted to the cross - over problem @xcite .",
    "for example , the description beyond the original nsr theory has been given by the self - consistent t - matrix ( sct ) approximation @xcite and by the pairing approximation @xcite .",
    "the electronic spectrum has been calculated for the essentially low - density model by the t - matrix approach @xcite .",
    "in particular , janko _ et al .",
    "_ have shown that the pseudogap in the single - particle spectrum appears near the cross - over region in the 3d jellium model .",
    "then , the importance of the self - energy correction has been pointed out .",
    "the quantum monte carlo simulation has been performed as a non - perturbative method for the same problem @xcite .",
    "then , the results in the strong - coupling region commonly show the pseudogap in the single - particle and magnetic excitations both in the high- and low - density region .    we , however , believe that the bcs - bec cross - over is not an essential viewpoint for the high-@xmath2 cuprates @xcite .",
    "this point of view is especially important in order to clarify the origin of the pseudogap . in sec .",
    "4.2 , we show that the excitation gap is induced by the sc fluctuation even far from the cross - over region , if we adopt an appropriate model @xcite .",
    "then , the anomalous behaviors of the self - energy correction , which is derived by the t - matrix approach , play an essential role .",
    "this scenario is rather conventional in the fluctuation theory @xcite , but several conditions are required in the sc fluctuation theory .",
    "the self - energy correction arising from the sc fluctuation has been investigated in 1970 s @xcite , which shows the decrease of the electronic dos due to the sc fluctuation .",
    "however , it seems that this idea has not attracted much interests , because this is a very weak effect in the conventional superconductor .",
    "we would like to stress that this common knowledge should be altered for cuprates , where the sc fluctuation is remarkably enhanced by the short coherence length and the quasi - two - dimensionality .",
    "then , the more pronounced phenomenon is derived ; the pseudogap appears in the single - particle spectral function .",
    "the high-@xmath2 cuprates are probably the first example for the clear appearance of this phenomenon .",
    "it should be noticed that the t - matrix approach is commonly used for the nsr theory and for the estimation of the self - energy . actually , if we regard the fig .",
    "[ fig : nozieres ] as a luttinger s functional eq .",
    "( [ eq : variation ] ) , the self - energy should be estimated by the sct approximation .",
    "two aspects of the t - matrix approach , the bcs - bec cross - over and the pseudogap , appear depending on the selected microscopic model .",
    "indeed , the essential differences arise from the electron density and the dimensionality .",
    "if we use the 3d jellium model , the pseudogap appears from the cross - over region @xcite .",
    "then , the leading scattering process is called `` resonance scattering '' since the sc fluctuation has a resonance nature in this region . on the other hand ,",
    "if we use the quasi-2d square lattice model near the half - filling ( the nearly half - filled system should be regarded as high density ) , the self - energy correction gives rise to the pseudogap under more moderate condition .",
    "this is mainly because the quasi - two - dimensionality leads to the strong fluctuation and induces the pseudogap for the relatively small value of @xmath410 .",
    "moreover , the high electron density makes the bcs - bec cross - over difficult . if we consider the repulsive hubbard model as in sec .",
    "4.3 , the bcs - bec cross - over is practically impossible .",

    "we see from this observation that the 3d jellium model is too simplified to discuss the high-@xmath2 cuprates , while several aspects are common . in two dimensions ,",
    "the resonance nature of the sc fluctuation is not necessary for the pseudogap , while the renormalization effect induces more propagating character @xcite . in the following part ,",
    "however , we will commonly use the term `` resonance scattering '' keeping in mind that a kind of the resonance between quasi - particle state and cooper - pairing state is expected .    along this line",

    "basically , the pairing symmetry is not important ; the @xmath8-wave model shows the pseudogap in a similar way @xcite except for the difference in the momentum dependence .",
    "the sct approximation is one of the methods to include the higher - order correction , which is taken into account within the renormalization of the green function .",

    "another approach is the `` phase fluctuation theory '' @xcite . in this approach ,",

    "the description of the normal state may require further discussions ; the amplitude fluctuation certainly affects there .    here",
    "we stress that the phase fluctuation theory is not intrinsically incompatible with the t - matrix approach .",
    "we consider that the former is an approach from the low - temperature side and the latter is that from the high - temperature side , which will be complementary .",

    "a sophisticated numerical method has shown that the sadovskii s solution is qualitatively a good approximation for the complex order parameter @xcite ; the commensurate cdw is not the case , but the sc is the case .",

    "it is shown that the sct approximation properly reproduces the low - energy dos , while the high - energy behavior @xmath421 is not .",
    "since the gaussian fluctuation is inappropriate near the critical point , a more sophisticated treatment for the statistical ensemble is required for the critical behaviors .",
    "the cross - over from the gaussian fluctuation region to the phase fluctuation region has been described on the basis of the lee - rice - anderson model with a careful treatment of the statistical ensemble @xcite .",

    "another solvable model is the bcs pairing model with sufficiently long - range attractive interaction .",
    "this model is almost exactly solvable in any dimension with the use of the sadovskii s method @xcite .",

    "then , we see that the characteristic magnetic field @xmath512 for the sc fluctuation is expressed as @xmath513 . that is , the effects of the magnetic field are scaled by the magnetic flux penetrating the correlated area @xmath514 .    as we have stressed above",

    "this effect has been unclear since it is masked by the sizable decrease from 50 k. the magnetic field dependence has played a key role to identify the contribution from the sc fluctuation .",

    "this assumption seems to be incompatible with the pseudogap induced by the `` resonance scattering '' , where the extremely large damping is the origin of the pseudogap .",
    "however , this difficulty is removed by the characteristic momentum dependence ; the pseudogap occurs at the hot spot , while the in - plane transport is determined by the cold spot as explained below . because the coherent nature of the quasi - particles is sufficiently maintained at the cold spot ( figs .",

    "now let us explain the microscopic theories .",
    "first the results of the spin fluctuation theory are reviewed @xcite .",
    "we show the calculated results of the resistivity and hall coefficient in the flex approximation .",
    "the four - point vertex in the flex approximation includes three terms ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : afmt ] ) . because the spin - fluctuation maki - thompson ( spmt ) term shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : afmt](a ) is dominant among them , only the spmt - term is taken into account @xcite    we provide a detailed explanation because a part of the following understanding is obtained in recent years .",
    "the @xmath7-linear law of the electric resistivity and the enhancement of the hall coefficient are discussed .",
    "these behaviors are the characteristics of the nearly af fermi liquid and observed in the experimental results above @xmath29 .",
    "we point out three important properties from which the unconventional transport above @xmath29 is explained .",
    "the first is the momentum dependence of the quasi - particle lifetime @xmath618 .",
    "the typical results are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : lifefs ] .",
    "we see that the lifetime is long at the cold spot @xmath619 and short at the hot spot @xmath620 or @xmath621 @xcite . when the exchange of the af spin fluctuation is the dominant scattering process , the quasi - particle damping @xmath622 is almost determined by the low - energy dos around @xmath623 . then , the lifetime is short around the magnetic brillouin zone boundary and/or around the van hove singularity .",
    "the electric transport is practically carried by the quasi - particles at the cold spot which is located around @xmath624 ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : hotcold.tgif ] ) .",
    "this momentum dependence of the lifetime affects the spectral function , as is explained in sec .",
    "4.3.1 , which is actually observed in the arpes measurements @xcite .",
    "also the magnetic - transport measurement has confirmed this momentum dependence @xcite .",
    "the second is the @xmath7-linear dependence of the damping rate @xmath625 , where @xmath626 is the momentum at the cold spot .",
    "the @xmath7-linear resistivity originates from this @xmath7-linear dependence @xcite .",
    "it have been pointed out that the @xmath52-resistivity is always obtained in the low - temperature limit even in the quantum critical point unless the fermi surface is perfectly nested @xcite .",
    "this is because the quasi - particles at the cold spot are not directly scattered by the af spin fluctuation at @xmath587 .",
    "note that the anomalous power - law can be induced by the slight impurity scattering near the quantum critical point @xcite .",
    "however , the crossover temperature from @xmath7-square to @xmath7-linear resistivity is sufficiently small in the under - doped region ( fig .",
    "[ fig : flex - r](a ) ) .",
    "the transformation of the fermi surface plays a role to reduce the crossover temperature @xcite .",
    "the third is the temperature dependence of the vertex correction @xcite .",
    "we will see that the contribution from the spmt - term to the total current vertex @xmath627 significantly enhances the hall coefficient . the schematic figure ( fig .",
    "[ fig : hotcold.tgif ] ) shows that the total current vertex @xmath627 is significantly altered from the band velocity @xmath628 .",
    "this is an effect of the af spin fluctuation .",
    "then , the four - point vertex @xmath599 is significantly enhanced around @xmath629 . in the vicinity of the magnetic instability , the differential @xmath630 increases around the cold spot",
    ". therefore , the hall coefficient increases with the development of the spin fluctuation ( fig .",
    "[ fig : flex - r](b ) ) .",
    "the vertex correction is not so important for the resistivity .",
    "the resistivity is enhanced by the spmt - term , however , the qualitative temperature dependence is not altered ( fig .",
    "[ fig : flex - r](a ) ) .",
    "the nearly af fermi - liquid theory explains the transport phenomena also in the electron - doped region .",
    "then , the cold spot is located around @xmath563 and @xmath631 , as is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : lifefs ] , where the fermi surface is far from the magnetic brillouin zone ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : fermi ] ) .",
    "the large damping around the magnetic brillouin zone is consistent with the observation in the arpes measurements @xcite , which confirms this picture .",
    "then , the electric transport shows considerably different behaviors .",
    "combined with the sharp commensurate structure of the magnetic excitation ( fig .",
    "[ fig : kaiflex ] ) , the quasi - particle lifetime at the cold spot follows the usual @xmath7-square law .",
    "note that the lifetime is much longer than the hole - doped case .",
    "therefore , the resistivity shows the @xmath7-square law with a small magnitude @xcite .",
    "more interestingly , the hall coefficient changes its sign because the differential of the angle @xmath630 has negative sign around @xmath563 @xcite .",
    "these behaviors are consistent with the experimental results @xcite .    in the following part ,",
    "we take account of the sc fluctuation and discuss the electric transport in the pseudogap state @xcite . in order to make the discussion clear",
    ", we classify the effects of the sc fluctuation in the following way .    1 .   the pseudogap in the single - particle properties .",
    "2 .   the feedback effects through the af spin fluctuation .",
    "3 .   the vertex corrections from the sc fluctuation .",
    "the al - term is classified into them .",
    "the following calculation identifies the effect ( 2 ) as a main contribution .",
    "that is , the coupling between the spin and sc fluctuations plays an essential role for the electric transport .",
    "therefore , we perform the self - consistent flex+t - matrix ( scft ) approximation @xcite in which the dynamical spin susceptibility , t - matrix , and the green function are determined self - consistently .",
    "we first discuss the resistivity . the effect ( 1 )",
    "obviously reduces the longitudinal and transverse conductivities . however , the increase of the resistivity is not significant because the pseudogap occurs at the hot spot which is not important for the transport phenomena .",
    "it should be noted that the self - energy at the cold spot is always dominated by the spin fluctuation .",
    "then , the effect ( 2 ) increases the conductivity and gives the larger contribution than ( 1 ) .",
    "the quasi - particle damping arising from the spin fluctuation @xmath632 is reduced by the pseudogap in the spin excitation .",
    "thus , the sc fluctuation induces the downward deviation of the resistivity around @xmath32 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : sc - resistivityu=2.0](a ) ) through the feedback effect .",
    "this downward deviation becomes more remarkable as decreasing the hole - doping , which is consistent with the experimental results @xcite .",
    "it is another important property that the deviation of the resistivity is only a slight one , while the nmr @xmath26 is remarkably reduced by the sc fluctuation .",
    "this is because the cold spot is not so sensitive to spin fluctuation at @xmath587 . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : imkai_under_flex ] , the suppression of the magnetic excitation is moderate for the incommensurate component @xmath633 .",
    "this is an origin of the incommensurate peak in the pseudogap state . since the quasi - particle damping at the cold spot",
    "is determined by some average of the incommensurate component , the enhancement of the lifetime is not so significant .",
    "thus , the weak response of the resistivity to the pseudogap is explained by the detailed analysis of the momentum dependence .",
    "this explanation is in sharp contrast with that in the rvb theory @xcite .",
    "we have clarified the role of the vertex correction arising from the sc fluctuation @xcite .",
    "then , we have estimated the lowest - order term within the liashberg theory ( `` scmt - term '' ) and the al - term @xcite beyond the liashberg theory ( fig .",
    "[ fig : scmt2 ] ) .",
    "both contributions increase the conductivity .",
    "it should be noted that the scmt term is not equivalent to the maki - thompson term @xcite which has been investigated in the fluctuation theory @xcite .",
    "the scmt term includes the lowest order contribution with respect to @xmath634 , and take into account the vertex correction iteratively .",
    "note that the diffusion propagator , which is important in the @xmath8-wave superconductor , is negligible in the @xmath3-wave superconductor .",
    "figure [ fig : sc - resistivityu=2.0](b ) shows that the scmt - term does not affect the temperature dependence , qualitatively .",
    "this is mainly because of the momentum dependence of the @xmath3-wave order parameter .",
    "although the contribution from the scmt - term increases as the temperature decreases , it is not visible in the temperature dependence of the resistivity because the other contribution to the conductivity also increases .    the role of the al - term may be interesting because this contribution has been intensively investigated in the fluctuation theory @xcite .",
    "the al - term is interpreted as the conductivity carried by the fluctuating cooper - pairs  @xcite , and should be written as the superconducting part @xmath635 in contrast to the normal part @xmath636 included in the liashberg theory .",
    "we have concluded that the al - term is almost negligible in the wide temperature range ( see fig.[fig : sc - resistivityu=2.0](b ) ) .",
    "this is simply because the al - term is higher order with respect to the parameter @xmath637 .",
    "the al - term becomes dominant just above @xmath2 because this term is more divergent with respect to @xmath638 .",
    "however , this temperature range is narrow because of the long lifetime of the quasi - particle at the cold spot .",
    "the detailed analysis on the fluctuation conductivity in the vicinity of the critical point has been performed within the weak - coupling theory @xcite . here",
    "we stress that the downward deviation of the resistivity is not attributed to the al - term , but to the feedback effect through the suppression of the spin fluctuation .    here",
    "we discuss the role of the al - term furthermore , since some characteristics of the high-@xmath2 cuprates manifest .",
    "there are two important points in the above discussion on the al - term .",
    "one is the strong - coupling superconductivity .",
    "while the resonance scattering is strong in the superconductor with short coherence length , the al - term does not directly depend on the coherence length in two dimensions @xcite .",
    "this is because the short coherence length means the small velocity of the fluctuating cooper - pairs .",
    "then , the pseudogap occurs under not so small value of @xmath447 where the al - term is still small .",
    "the other is the characteristic momentum dependences in high-@xmath2 cuprates .",
    "for example , in case of the strong - coupling @xmath8-wave superconductors , the al - term will be much more important .",
    "this is because the pseudogap opens on the whole fermi surface and therefore the normal part @xmath636 is remarkably suppressed .",
    "let us comment on the c - axis transport , which shows qualitatively different behaviors from the in - plane transport .",
    "that is , the _",
    "c_-axis transport is strongly incoherent in the pseudogap state , while the in - plane transport is sufficiently coherent @xcite .",
    "we can understand these qualitatively different behaviors in a consistent way .",
    "then , the momentum dependence of the inter - layer hopping matrix plays an essential role @xcite .",
    "the result of the band calculation has shown the following behavior @xcite , @xmath639 in short , the inter - layer hopping matrix vanishes at the cold spot and the _",
    "c_-axis transport is mainly determined by the hot spot .",
    "therefore , the _ c_-axis conductivity is significantly reduced by the effect ( 1 ) .",
    "actually , the incoherent nature of the _ c_-axis optical conductivity has been obtained in the pseudogap state within the flex+t - matrix approximation , together with the coherent nature of the in - plane optical conductivity @xcite .",
    "this is an experimentally observed behavior @xcite .",
    "naively , it may be expected that the al - term is important in the c - axis transport instead of the quasi - particle transport . however , the al - term is higher order with respect to the inter - layer hopping , _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath640 while @xmath641 @xcite .",
    "therefore , the al - term is negligible in the quasi-2d system .",
    "we stress that the qualitative difference between the _ c_-axis and in - plane transport is not attributed to the difference of the al - term @xcite , but to the difference of the normal part @xmath636 . in order to arrive at this conclusion",
    ", we have to consider the spin and sc fluctuations simultaneously and to take account of the momentum dependent inter - layer hopping matrix .",
    "finally let us discuss the hall coefficient .",
    "the hall coefficient increases owing to the effect ( 1 ) , because the momentum dependence of the lifetime is enhanced by ( 1 ) .",
    "actually , the sc fluctuation was proposed to be the origin of the enhancement of the hall coefficient @xcite .",
    "however , the situation is quite altered by taking account of the spmt - term .",
    "the kernel of the bethe - salpeter equation ( eq .  ( [ eq : currentvertex ] ) ) includes the four - point vertex arising from the spin fluctuation and the absolute value of the green function .",
    "therefore , the vertex correction is reduced by the feedback effect ( 2 ) and furthermore by the effect ( 1 ) . as a result",
    ", the hall coefficient is reduced by the sc fluctuation through the spmt - term .",
    "we have confirmed that the feedback effect ( 2 ) is dominant also for the hall coefficient .",
    "the calculated results in fig .",
    "[ fig : sc - hallu=2.0 ] clearly show the pseudogap behavior of the hall coefficient .",
    "the hall coefficient shows the peak around @xmath642 and decreases with decreasing the temperature .",
    "this phenomenon becomes moderate with increasing the hole - doping .",
    "these results qualitatively explain the experimental results in the pseudogap state including the doping dependence @xcite .",
    "the vertex correction arising from the scmt - term enhances the momentum dependence of the angle @xmath611 @xcite .",
    "therefore , the hall coefficient is enhanced by the vertex correction arising from the sc fluctuation .",
    "it is notable that this enhancement does not occur without the spmt - term . in other wards , the scmt - term",
    "indirectly enhances the hall coefficient through the combination with the spmt - term .",
    "figure [ fig : sc - hallu=2.0](b ) shows that this enhancement is not so significant to alter the qualitative behaviors .",
    "this is also because of the wave function of the @xmath3-wave superconductivity . including the al - term in the longitudinal conductivity , the suppression of the hall coefficient becomes clearer .",
    "thus , the transport coefficients in the pseudogap state are explained by simultaneously taking into account the spin fluctuation and sc fluctuation .",
    "it is confirmed that characteristic behaviors of the electric transport are mainly caused by the feedback effect through the pseudogap in the spin fluctuation .",
    "this effect is not outstanding in the resistivity , but rather apparent in the hall coefficient .",
    "this difference reflects the importance of the spmt - term for these quantities .",
    "we stress that the conventional theory on the fluctuation conductivity is not satisfactory , but detailed knowledge on the electronic structure are required for the understanding of high-@xmath2 cuprates .",
    "recently , the theory including the spin and sc fluctuations has been extended to the thermal transport @xcite .",
    "it is shown that the vertex correction from the scmt - term combined with the spmt - term significantly enhances the nernst coefficient .",
    "this feature is also consistent with the experiments @xcite .",
    "although the vortex excitation has been considered as an origin of this behavior @xcite , we consider that the contribution from quasi - particles is dominant in the wide temperature region like for the electric conductivity .",
    "that is , the understanding within the liashberg theory will be relevant also for the thermal transport .",
    "the importance of the superconducting part in the vicinity of the critical point is common .",
    "the analysis on the superconducting part under the magnetic field has been recently given @xcite .",
    "at the last of this section , we show the phase diagram in fig .",
    "[ fig : phasediagram ] .",
    "the scft approximation is used to estimate @xmath2 suppressed by the fluctuation .",
    "the effects of the sc fluctuation are similarly classified into the following two parts : ( 1 ) the pseudogap in the single - particle properties .",
    "( 2 ) the feedback effect through the spin fluctuation .",
    "we have concluded that the feedback effect enhances the transition temperature @xcite .",
    "the spin fluctuation has both the pairing and de - pairing effects .",
    "since the low - frequency component mainly affects as a de - pairing source , the pseudogap in the spin fluctuation rather enhances the superconductivity ( see also sec .",
    "however , the effect ( 1 ) is dominant in the present case and significantly suppresses @xmath2 .",
    "note here that strictly speaking , the transition temperature should be always zero ( @xmath643 ) in the two - dimension , which is known as the mermin - wagner theorem .",
    "however , the singularity of the two - dimensional system is always removed in the layered systems . taking account of the weak inter - layer coupling ,",
    "we determine the critical point as @xmath644 instead of @xmath548 .",
    "this criterion corresponds to the 2d-3d crossover of the sc fluctuation with the anisotropy being @xmath645 and @xmath646 .",
    "it is shown that the suppression of @xmath391 from the mean - field value becomes remarkable with under - doping .",
    "this is a natural consequence because the sc fluctuation becomes strong with under - doping ( see sec .",
    "in other words , the pseudogap develops with under - doping and the reduced dos gives the suppressed @xmath2 .",
    "it is an interesting result that the transition temperature takes the maximum value at @xmath647 and decreases with under - doping in the scft approximation for @xmath648 .",
    "this feature is in sharp contrast to the flex approximation where the @xmath391 goes on increasing with decreasing @xmath20 ( see also sec .",
    "thus , the mean - field transition temperature develops with under - doping , however , the strong sc fluctuation decreases the @xmath2 in the under - doped region .",
    "this picture is consistent with the experimental results from the tunnelling measurements @xcite , where the sc gap develops with decreasing @xmath20 in the under - doped region .",
    "we can see from fig .",
    "[ fig : phasediagram ] that the decrease of @xmath2 in the under - doped region is only a slight one in case of @xmath649 .",
    "thus , the strong electron correlation plays an essential role for describing the under - doped region .",
    "it is also important that we can treat the strong correlation by considering the sc fluctuation which suppresses the af order .",
    "the stabilization of the metallic state by the sc fluctuation is actually expected in the hole - doped cuprates .",
    "it is worth while to write again that the strength of the sc coupling is indicated by the ratio @xmath554 , and not by @xmath391 .",
    "since the mean - field transition temperature @xmath475 increases and the effective fermi energy @xmath650 decreases with under - doping , the superconductivity becomes strong coupling in spite of the decreasing @xmath391 .",
    "thus , the decreasing @xmath391 in the under - doped region is obtained by starting from the microscopic hamiltonian and taking account of the sc fluctuation .",
    "this is an important development for the theory starting from the fermi - liquid state . as has been discussed in sec .",
    "3.2.5 , the scft approximation underestimates the effects of the sc fluctuation .",
    "therefore , the more significant doping dependence is expected in the higher - order theory , which is beyond the scope of this review .",
    "it is quite clear that the scft approximation is not sufficient to show the disappearance of the superconductivity .",
    "if we describe the phase boundary between the sc phase and the spin glass phase , the loss of the metallic behavior will be an essential aspect .",
    "then , the validity of the flex approximation will be a subject .",
    "the systematic treatment for the electron correlation and the disorder will be necessary for this issue .",
    "this is an interesting and open problem .    #",
    "in previous sections , we have discussed the superconductivity in high-@xmath2 cuprates , organic superconductors , and sr@xmath0ruo@xmath1 . the pairing mechanism and several physical properties of these materials have been explained . in the calculation of the transition temperature within the mean - field theory ,",
    "we have adopted the third - order perturbation ( top ) theory with respect to the on - site coulomb repulsion @xmath14 for the weak - coupling case . when the anti - ferromagnetic ( af ) spin fluctuation is strongly enhanced , the fluctuation - exchange ( flex ) approximation has been applied . in general , these two methods are useful for the weak and intermediate coupling regimes in @xmath14 .    here note that the above approaches stand on a common basis of the fermi - liquid state .",
    "as far as the system is in a metallic state , or more strictly , the existence of fermi - liquid quasi - particles is insured , such methods have an established basis .",
    "this is related to the analytic property in @xmath14 and the continuity principle stressed by p. w. anderson @xcite . in this case",
    ", the long - lived fermi - liquid quasi - particles form the fermi surface at low temperatures .",
    "the superconductivity is induced by the effective interaction among quasi - particles and the paring symmetry is determined by the momentum dependence of the four - point vertex function , which is naturally caused by the short - range repulsion through the many - body effect .",
    "thus , the superconductivity in strongly correlated materials discussed above can be understood from such a unified view .    on the other hand ,",
    "the superconductivity in heavy - fermion compounds , which are the typical sces materials , has not been explained from the microscopic point of view , mainly due to the complicated band structures and the strong correlation effect .",
    "however , we believe that the key mechanism of the superconductivity in these compounds should be also explained on the same footing as described in previous sections . it is expected that such efforts will extend the universality of the understanding on the superconductivity .",
    "then , the identification of the residual interaction between the quasi - particles is an essential task for this purpose .    in this section ,",
    "we introduce a strategy to treat heavy - fermion superconductors and discuss the possible applications to some ce - based and u - based heavy - fermion superconductors .",
    "then , we analyze the effective single @xmath4-band model by choosing one dominant band . further analysis based on more realistic models",
    "is a desirable future issue , but we believe that the essential physics will be unchanged and the discussion in this section will be a basis in the future progress .",
    "most of intermetallic compounds with several localized @xmath4-electrons at each atomic site exhibit some kinds of magnetic transition by the ruderman - kittel - kasuya - yosida ( rkky ) interaction .",
    "some of ce - based and u - based compounds , however , form coherent itinerant electron bands at low temperatures due to the mixing effect with conduction electrons , while they possess magnetic characters at high temperatures .",
    "such electron systems are frequently called `` heavy - fermion systems '' @xcite , since the effective mass of the itinerant electron becomes several hundred times larger than free - electron mass @xmath651 due to the strong electron correlation . in 1979 ,",
    "the superconductivity in cecu@xmath0si@xmath0 , which is one of typical heavy - fermion systems , has been reported by steglich et al . @xcite .",
    "the discovery of the superconductivity in the material with remarkable magnetic characters has implied a scenario clearly different from the electron - phonon mechanism in the conventional bcs theory .",
    "in fact , physical properties in the superconducting phase at low temperature have shown power - law temperature dependence , different from exponential decay observed in the conventional @xmath8-wave superconductor .",
    "thus , cecu@xmath0si@xmath0 has become the pioneering discovery of unconventional superconductivity in sces .",
    "it is now considered as an even - parity superconductor with line - nodes , probably @xmath3-wave pairing symmetry .",
    "since then , many unconventional superconductors have been discovered in heavy - fermion systems .",

    "ce - based heavy - fermion compounds possess the typical nature of what is known as `` kondo effect '' in the impurity case @xcite .",
    "the impurity kondo problem is a typical example of the fermi - liquid formation in many - body systems .",
    "the local spin fluctuation at impurity ( ce ) site , observed at high temperatures , is quenched at low temperature by the mixing effect with the conduction electrons .",
    "the system forms the local fermi - liquid state and has the singlet ground state as a whole . in the process",
    ", the resistivity shows the @xmath662-behavior with decreasing @xmath7 and eventually arrives at the value of the unitarity limit .",
    "the change of the behavior is marked by a characteristic temperature @xmath663 , which is called the kondo temperature . in the actual case",
    ", there remains degeneracy in @xmath4 orbitals .",
    "for instance , assuming that the crystal - field ( cf ) ground state is @xmath664 doublet and the excited state is @xmath665 quartet , we obtain the characteristic kondo temperature as @xcite @xmath666 where @xmath667 , @xmath668 , and @xmath669 represent the conduction band - width , the cf splitting , and the kondo coupling constant , respectively . for @xmath670 ,",
    "the higher kondo temperature @xmath671 is effective , while for @xmath672 , the lower kondo temperature @xmath673 becomes effective .",
    "then , the resistivity shows the broad peak around @xmath674 and the typical @xmath662 dependence around @xmath675 .",
    "this is the case also in the periodic lattice system .",
    "the different point from the impurity case is that in the periodic lattice systems , the resistivity smoothly changes into a power - law decay ( typically @xmath50 ) with a large coefficient @xmath676 at lower temperature .",
    "this corresponds to the formation of coherent quasi - particle states with a large effective mass @xmath68 , typically @xmath677 . here",
    "note that there exists a heuristic relation between the effective mass and the coefficient of the @xmath50-resistivity .",
    "actually , the kadowaki - woods relation , @xmath678 , has been found in many heavy - fermion compounds @xcite , where @xmath92 denotes the sommerfeld coefficient in the electronic specific heat .",
    "for instance , the resistivity in cecu@xmath0si@xmath0 exhibits two hump structures at @xmath679k and @xmath680k .",
    "then , it smoothly changes into @xmath50 dependence at low temperatures @xcite .",
    "these two characteristic temperatures ( @xmath681k and @xmath680k ) correspond to @xmath674 and @xmath675 , respectively .",
    "the metallic behavior with the @xmath50-resistivity at low temperatures indicates the formation of the coherent itinerant band of heavy quasi - particles .",
    "the coefficient @xmath676 is also consistent with the large enhanced value of the electronic specific - heat coefficient , @xmath682j / k@xmath683mol .",
    "the compound cecu@xmath0si@xmath0 undergoes the transition into the sc phase at @xmath684k @xcite , marked by the discontinuity in the specific heat .",
    "the ratio of the jump to the normal - state specific heat @xmath685 is of the order of unity ( @xmath686 ) , which could be explained in terms of the conventional bcs theory .",
    "this fact is a strong evidence for the fact that the superconductivity in this compound is a cooperative phenomenon in the heavy quasi - particles .",
    "it is natural to consider that the heavy quasi - particles on the fermi surface form the cooper - pairs with use of the residual interaction . in this case ,",
    "a couple of quasi - particles prefer to form some anisotropic pairing state , not an @xmath8-wave one , in order to avoid the strong on - site repulsion .",
    "actually , cecu@xmath0si@xmath0 in the sc phase exhibits the power - law dependence in physical quantities at low temperatures , such as @xmath82-dependence in the nmr / nqr @xmath658 @xcite and @xmath50-dependence in the thermal conductivity @xmath15 @xcite .",
    "all these facts imply zeros of the gap along lines on the fermi surface .",
    "in addition , the knight shift decreases irrespective of directions of the crystallographic axis @xcite .",
    "thus , the pairing symmetry is considered as an even - parity state with line nodes , and presumably @xmath3-wave symmetry from many similarities with the cuprates and the organic superconductors .",
    "one of the remarkable similarities is the existence of the neighboring af phase in the @xmath656 phase diagram and the phase diagram of chemical substitutions in a series of the isostructural compounds .",
    "the ground state of cecu@xmath0(si@xmath652ge@xmath86)@xmath0 , with increasing @xmath687 , changes from the sc phase to the af phase through the coexistent phase , owing to negative chemical pressures by ge substitution for si @xcite .",
    "this property is similar to that of the organic superconductor , as is explained in sec .",
    "an isostructural compound cecu@xmath0ge@xmath0 is the incommensurate spin - density - wave ( sdw ) state with @xmath688 at ambient pressure @xcite . under high pressures around 7gpa ,",
    "the magnetic phase abruptly disappears , accompanied by the sc transition with @xmath689k @xcite .",
    "cepd@xmath0si@xmath0 @xcite , cerh@xmath0si@xmath0 @xcite , and ceni@xmath0ge@xmath0 @xcite also exhibit the transition from the af metals to the sc phases ( @xmath690k ) under high pressures .",
    "this is also the case in cein@xmath9 @xcite ( @xmath691k ) with the cubic aucu@xmath9-type structure .",
    "the remarkable af spin fluctuation in these compounds is actually implied by some measurements .",
    "the power smaller than two of temperature ( @xmath692 ) is observed in the resistivity @xcite , and the nmr / nqr @xmath693 increases at low temperatures @xcite .",
    "these properties are typical ones in the nearly af fermi - liquid in quasi-2d and 3d systems .",
    "the relationship of such af spin fluctuation with the unconventional superconductivity has been intensively investigated , especially in the cuprates , from the microscopic point of view ( see sec .",
    "a series of cetin@xmath654 ( t = co , rh , and ir ) discovered recently @xcite possess many similarities with the cuprates and the organic superconductors .",

    "indicate that the superconductivity appears in the neighborhood of the af phase .",
    "the power - law behavior of the resistivity in the normal phase with @xmath694 in ceirin@xmath654 ( @xmath695k ) @xcite and @xmath7 in cecoin@xmath654 ( @xmath655k ) @xcite implies the strong quasi-2d af spin fluctuation . in the sc phase ,",
    "no coherence peak just below @xmath2 , @xmath82-behavior at low temperatures in the nmr / nqr @xmath658 , and the decrease in the knight shift irrespective of directions indicate the anisotropic even - parity superconductivity , similar to other ce - based heavy - fermion superconductors @xcite .",
    "in addition , the four - fold symmetry in the thermal conductivity in cecoin@xmath654 @xcite strongly suggests the @xmath16-wave singlet pairing .",
    "furthermore , the pseudogap phenomenon has been reported in the @xmath696in - nqr measurement in cerhin@xmath654 in the range of pressures ( @xmath697gpa ) , under which the coexistent phase exists @xcite .",
    "these similarities , especially the af spin fluctuation and @xmath16-wave pairing , indicate that the underlying physics in the superconductivity in these ce - based heavy - fermion superconductors is in common with the cuprate superconductors .",
    "this is also inferred from the microscopic electronic state , where one @xmath4-electron exists per ce site and the @xmath4-electron band itself is almost half - filled when the hybridization with the conduction electron band is not taken into account .    in the latter section ,",
    "we verify the validity of the argument by estimating @xmath2 in the ce - based heavy - fermion superconductors on the same framework as in the cuprates .",
    "we introduce neither the coexistent phase in the boundary between the sc and af phases nor the @xmath676 phase with anomalous magnetic features @xcite . although these are one of interesting issues of @xmath4-electron systems , here we focused our interests on the superconductivity itself .",
    "next we briefly review u - based heavy - fermion superconductors .",
    "they exhibit various kinds of sc phases probably owing to multi @xmath4-band structures with two or three @xmath4 electrons per u site",
    ". we will show a possibility of our argument even in such complicated systems .",
    "first we note that u - based compounds do not necessarily display clear @xmath662 dependence in the resistivity .",
    "this is attributed to the multi @xmath4-orbitals and relatively large hybridization terms with the conduction electrons .",
    "these properties also provide the complicated multi - band structures and many fermi surfaces with dominant @xmath4 character .",
    "the fermi surfaces obtained by the band calculations well explain the dhva measurements .",
    "one of the characteristics of u - based compounds different from ce - based compounds is the clear coexistence between the sc phase and some kind of magnetic ordered phase .",

    "although such a variety of interesting phenomena have been observed experimentally , there are little theoretical progress from the microscopic point of view .",
    "one of the causes is the complicated band structure , since u - based compounds possess several @xmath4 electrons per u site and many fermi - surface sheets originating from multi @xmath4-orbitals . on the one hand ,",
    "the complicated nature is unfavorable for the theoretical effort , but on the other hand , it is related to a great variety of the ground states .",
    "it seems to be natural to consider that part of the fermi surfaces stabilizing the magnetic phase is different from that leading to the sc state , even though we can not completely decouple them .",
    "then , we can discuss possibility of the superconductivity by investigating the remaining fermi surfaces in the magnetic phase .",
    "we will introduce the simple application on the unconventional superconductivity in the af phase in upd@xmath0al@xmath9 and uni@xmath0al@xmath9 later . the former is considered as an even - parity superconductor , while the latter is an odd - parity one .",
    "we will discuss how this difference occurs .",
    "first we introduce a theoretical treatment of the heavy - fermion superconductors from the microscopic point of view .",
    "as indicated in a variety of experiments for heavy - fermion compounds , the superconducting transition occurs after the formation of the coherent quasi - particle state with heavy effective mass . here",
    "we formulate a way to calculate @xmath2 on the quasi - particle description based on the fermi - liquid theory .",
    "let us start our discussion on the periodic anderson model ( pam ) as a typical model for heavy - fermion systems .",
    "this model well describes the dual nature of @xmath4-electron systems .",
    "the perturbation expansion in terms of the hybridization matrix element leads to the rkky interaction between the localized @xmath4-electron spins .",
    "this is the origin of the magnetic transition in @xmath4-electron systems . on the other hand ,",
    "if no magnetic transition occurs , the system goes to a singlet ground state as the whole .",
    "this is the fermi - liquid state of quasi - particles with heavy effective mass . in this case",
    ", we should treat the pam by the perturbation theory with respect to the on - site coulomb repulsion @xmath14 between @xmath4 electrons , expecting the analyticity about @xmath14 as long as no phase transition occurs .",
    "the analytic property has been exactly proved in the impurity anderson model @xcite .",
    "although such an exact proof does not exist for the pam , the continuity principle is believed to justify the applicability of the perturbation theory with respect to @xmath14 .",
    "from such a point of view , yamada and yosida have developed the fermi - liquid theory for the heavy - fermion state based on the pam @xcite .",
    "the momentum independent part of the four - point vertex functions @xmath708 between @xmath4 electrons with spin @xmath113 and @xmath709 plays an important role .",
    "this dominant @xmath8-wave scattering part leads to the nearly momentum independent large mass enhancement factor @xmath710 .",
    "in fact , when the momentum dependence of the mass enhancement factor can be ignored , the @xmath7-linear coefficient of the specific heat in the pam , is given by @xmath711 where @xmath712 is the boltzmann s constant and @xmath713 is the @xmath4-electron density of states at the fermi level .",
    "this indicates that the large mass enhancement factor @xmath714 is represented as @xmath715 with use of the @xmath8-wave scattering part of the four - point vertex .",
    "this result implies that the interaction between the quasi - particles @xmath716 holds the order of magnitude of the effective band - width of quasi - particles @xmath717 , where @xmath25 is the characteristic energy scale of the heavy - fermion state . for @xmath718",
    ", the low - energy excitation can be described by the fermi - liquid theory .    on the other hand ,",
    "the imaginary part of the @xmath4-electron self - energy , which is proportional to the electric resistivity , is given by @xmath719 when the momentum dependence of the vertices can be ignored .",
    "thus , the coefficient @xmath676 of the @xmath50-term of the electrical resistivity is proportional to @xmath720 through the vertex @xmath721 .",
    "this relation @xmath678 , which is well known as the kadowaki - woods relation @xcite , holds when the momentum dependence of the vertices is sufficiently weak to be ignored .",
    "note that the relation does not hold when the momentum dependence of the quasi - particle interaction is remarkable .",
    "the high-@xmath2 cuprate is the typical case , as is explained in sec .",
    "4.3 . in most of heavy - fermion systems ,",
    "the kadowaki - woods relation has been confirmed , indicating that the four - point vertex function , i.e. , the interaction among quasi - particles , possesses rather weak momentum dependence .",
    "the heavy - fermion superconductivity appears under this situation for @xmath718 .",
    "the large @xmath8-wave repulsive part @xmath721 prevents an appearance of the @xmath8-wave singlet superconductivity . in this case ,",
    "anisotropic pairing states such as @xmath13- or @xmath3-wave will be formed due to the remaining momentum dependence of the four - point vertices in the particle - particle channel . here",
    "we discuss such anisotropic paring on the quasi - particles .",
    "first we divide the four - point vertex function @xmath722 into the large @xmath8-wave scattering part @xmath723 and the non-@xmath8-wave part @xmath724 ; @xmath725 where @xmath726 and @xmath727 are the incident momenta , while @xmath728 , @xmath729 the outgoing .",
    "the second term @xmath724 has remarkable momentum dependence leading to the the anisotropic cooper - pairing .",
    "our purpose is to formulate how to calculate @xmath724 for the heavy - fermion quasi - particles , which are renormalized by the large local part @xmath721 .",
    "corresponding to these two terms of the vertex function , we can also separate the self - energy into the local and non - local parts as @xmath730 in this case , the @xmath4-electron green s function below @xmath25 is given by @xmath731 where @xmath72 is the mass renormalization factor , @xmath732 is the renormalized @xmath4-electron dispersion , @xmath733 is the renormalized hybridization term , @xmath734 is the renormalized @xmath4-electron self - energy , and @xmath735 denotes the momentum independent incoherent part of the green s function . the imaginary part of @xmath736 in proportion to @xmath737 can be included in the remaining renormalized self - energy @xmath738 , as indicated by hewson for the impurity anderson model @xcite . from the ward - takahashi identity ,",
    "we can obtain the large mass enhancement factor as @xmath739 in addition , we can set the large local vertex @xmath721 as a constant value at zero frequencies , as far as the frequency of external lines is less than @xmath25 . in this case , the effective on - site interaction @xmath716 works on the quasi - particles . in the impurity anderson model , @xmath740 , where @xmath668 and @xmath663 are the width of the virtual bound state and the kondo temperature , respectively .",
    "thus , we can assume that @xmath716 is of the order of @xmath25 in the periodic system .",
    "this is also consistent with the above - mentioned discussion of the specific - heat coefficient .",
    "it should be noted again that the renormalized @xmath8-wave interaction among quasi - particles becomes comparable with the quasi - particle band - width , while the on - site repulsion among the bare @xmath4-electrons is sufficiently larger than the bare @xmath4-electron band - width .",
    "now we show that in the region @xmath741 , the renormalized self - energy @xmath738 and vertex function @xmath742 can be discussed with the perturbation scheme with respect to the effective @xmath8-wave interaction , which is expected to be in the order of @xmath743 .",
    "first , let us consider the renormalized self - energy @xmath734 . because we have divided the green s function into the two parts as @xmath744 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : g ] ) , we can correspondingly divide all diagrams in the perturbative series into diagrams with and without the remarkable momentum dependence .",
    "the latter is contained in the local self - energy @xmath745 .",
    "on the other hand , the former can be rewritten as the expansion with respect to the effective @xmath8-wave interaction @xmath746 by concentrating on diagrams with the same momentum dependence .",
    "for instance , let us consider the third - order self - energy @xmath747 , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fighv : sig ] .",
    "the particle - hole line @xmath748 is divided into @xmath749 and @xmath750 including @xmath751 .",
    "the former part contributes mainly for @xmath752 , while the latter does not possess remarkable momentum dependence after the @xmath753 summation .",
    "then , the third - order diagram is also divided into three parts : @xmath754 with only the coherent part , @xmath755 , and the remaining terms with no remarkable momentum dependence .",
    "the last terms only contributes to the local self - energy . by ignoring the frequency dependence of @xmath750",
    ", the second term @xmath756 has the same momentum dependence as that in the second - order diagram in @xmath14 .",
    "then , one of the bare vertex @xmath14 is replaced by @xmath757 .",
    "this is one of vertex corrections for the second - order self - energy .",
    "also in the higher - order diagrams , we can pick out diagrams with three lines of @xmath758 producing the same momentum dependence .",
    "we get together such terms and reduce them to a second order diagram with respect to the effective coupling constant @xmath759 . by counting @xmath760 in three lines of @xmath761 and @xmath72 in the definition of the renormalized self - energy ,",
    "the renormalized second - order diagram @xmath762 can be regarded as the second - order diagram with respect to the effective @xmath8-wave interaction @xmath763 . here",
    "we replace the effective coupling constant for each reduced diagram to be @xmath746 and approximate it as @xmath764 .",
    "then , we can estimate the renormalized self - energy in the same manner as explained in sec .",
    "3.1 . likewise , within the low - order diagrams , the vertex function @xmath765 can be reconstructed as the expansion with respect to the quasi - particle green s function @xmath766 and the effective @xmath8-wave interaction @xmath764 . strictly speaking , in the higher order",
    ", there appear diagrams which can not be reduced to the expansion in this manner .",
    "for instance , higher - order vertex generally remains .",

    "then , we take a change of energy scale in the band - width and the interaction between quasi - particles . a better convergence is expected for this renormalized scheme rather than the original perturbation scheme .",
    "this procedure just corresponds to an approximation similar to the pseudo - potential method , such as the ladder summation of the divergent hard - core potential in @xmath10he shown by galitskii @xcite .",
    "the concept of our scheme corresponds to that the effective hamiltonian obtained by the renormalization group method can be written as the renormalized pam .",
    "then , the essential assumption is the locality of the interaction and the unimportance of the higher order vertex , when the renormalization is performed to the energy scale @xmath42 . of course",
    ", we must directly treat the expansion in the bare interaction @xmath14 to describe the crossover from the localized feature at high temperatures to the itinerant feature at low temperatures , which is characteristic in heavy - fermion systems .",
    "this is one of the future problems .",
    "next we formulate the gorkov equation for the sc transition on the quasi - particle description discussed above . as usual , the sc transition is marked by divergence of the full vertex in the cooper channel .",
    "this is determined by evaluating the linearized dyson - gorkov equation ( see sec .",

    "thus , in order to treat the heavy - fermion superconductivity , we start by introducing the quasi - particle state renormalized by the dominant @xmath8-wave scattering part , which itself does not yield the stable pairing interaction .",
    "then , we calculate the momentum dependent interaction between the quasi - particles , using the perturbation expansion in terms of the renormalized on - site repulsion .",
    "this leads to the transition into unconventional sc phases as a cooperative phenomenon of the heavy - fermion quasi - particles .",
    "note that the extension of the above procedure is straightforward , even if the af spin fluctuation is relatively strong and the effective interaction has rather strong momentum dependence as seen in a kind of ce - based heavy - fermion superconductors and the cuprate superconductors .",
    "now we can begin by the pam and the hubbard model describing the quasi - particle fermi surface .",
    "note also that such quasi - particle description implicitly includes the following two important arguments .",
    "the renormalized @xmath8-wave interaction among quasi - particles is expected to be moderate as compared with the quasi - particle band - width , even if the on - site repulsion among the bare @xmath4 electrons is sufficiently larger than the bare @xmath4-electron band - width .",
    "the electron - phonon interaction between quasi - particles is renormalized more severely , since it does not possess enhancement due to the vertex corrections as @xmath774 .",
    "thus , the conventional superconductivity mediated by the electron - phonon interaction is excluded at this stage .",
    "we proceed to the results of the perturbation theory based on the renormalized formula in the typical heavy - fermion superconductors ; cecu@xmath0x@xmath0 ( x = si and ge ) , cetin@xmath654 ( t = co , rh , and ir ) , cein@xmath9 , and um@xmath0al@xmath9 ( m = pd and ni ) .",
    "it should be noted that the following calculations do not strictly obey the above renormalization scheme .",
    "for instance , we do not include explicitly the contribution from the imaginary part of the local self - energy and the cut - off of the energy .",
    "rather the perturbative scheme explained in sec .",
    "3.1 will be directly applied . however , these differences do not alter the qualitative results such as the pairing symmetry of the stable state .",

    "thus , the result obtained by top for this simplified model can well explain the emergence of the different sc states in upd@xmath0al@xmath9 and uni@xmath0al@xmath9 .",

    "for instance , the effects of the af order , three - dimensionality , multi - band effect , and the relation with the ` resonance ' peak at @xmath700 should be investigated in more details .",

    "they are cuprate superconductors , organic superconductors , sr@xmath0ruo@xmath1 , and heavy - fermion superconductors .",
    "we have analyzed the superconductivity realized in these substances on the basis of the single- and multi - orbital hubbard hamiltonian . in the single - band hubbard hamiltonian ,",
    "the on - site electron correlation @xmath14 is the only many - body interaction .",
    "although the coulomb repulsion suppresses the @xmath8-wave superconductivity , it induces various types of anisotropic superconductivity through the momentum dependence of quasi - particle interaction , which originates from the many - body effect .",
    "while some inter - orbital interactions exist in the multi - orbital hubbard hamiltonian , anisotropic superconductivity is induced by essentially the same mechanism , namely the momentum dependence of quasi - particle interaction .",
    "this is an important understanding of the mechanism of superconductivity in strongly correlated electron systems ( sces ) .",
    "only the above understanding is believed to be the unified one . in other words",
    ", some simplified ideas will be insufficient for the purpose to provide a unified picture .",

    "we can easily understand this fact from the result on sr@xmath0ruo@xmath1 , where the approach from the fluctuation theory clearly fails . as is explained in sec .",
    "3.4 , the pairing mechanism of sr@xmath0ruo@xmath1 is appropriately clarified on the basis of the understanding proposed above .",
    "now we emphasize that the quasi - particle in the fermi - liquid theory is an essentially important concept to describe the sces .",
    "the basis of this fact is the continuity principle existing in the fermi liquid .",
    "this widely accepted idea not only ensures the applicability of the perturbative methods but also promises some universal understandings in the sces .",
    "while the superconducting materials in sces frequently show the non fermi - liquid behaviors , the usefulness of the fermi - liquid theory as a starting point is robust . in the general statement ,",
    "the existence of fermi - liquid quasi - particle is justified when the damping rate is smaller than its energy .",
    "if we adopt the nearly anti - ferromagnetic ( af ) fermi - liquid theory , the energy width of single - particle spectrum sometimes approaches to their energies , as seen in the vicinity of hot spots in the under - doped cuprates ( sec .",
    "however , it is still possible to consider the quasi - particle states with strong damping effects .",
    "the usefulness of the approach from the fermi - liquid theory has been confirmed by the arguments on the pseudogap phenomena ( sec .",

    "the self - energy shows anomalous behaviors : the real part possesses positive slope around fermi energy and the imaginary part shows a large peak around fermi energy in its absolute value .",
    "these behaviors are in sharp contrast to the normal fermi liquid .",
    "we have clarified that these anomalous behaviors of the self - energy are the origin of the pseudogap .",
    "because the superconducting long - range order violates the continuity principle , it is natural for its precursor to destroy the picture of quasi - particles by degrees .    on the basis of the above standpoint",
    ", we have reviewed several topics .",
    "we have clarified the mechanism of superconductivity for each system with the corresponding pairing symmetry .",
    "they are the @xmath3-wave pairing for cuprates and organic superconductors , @xmath13-wave pairing for sr@xmath0ruo@xmath1 , and @xmath3- or @xmath13-wave pairing for heavy - fermion superconductors .",
    "these results have been obtained by solving the dyson - gorkov equation derived by perturbation calculation or flex approximation .    in particular",
    ", we should stress that the physical properties related to the cuprate high temperature superconductivity have been explained appropriately in the normal and superconducting states .",
    "the hole - doped and electron - doped systems have been explained in common on the basis of the same hubbard hamiltonian by only adjusting the carrier number to that in real systems .",
    "moreover , pseudogap phenomena have been also explained by taking the sc fluctuations into account without any other assumptions .    in this review",
    "we have shown the following unified view for strongly correlated electron systems :    * 1 . *",
    "the anisotropic superconductivity in sces originates from the momentum dependence of the quasi - particle interaction , stemming from the on - site coulomb repulsion .",
    "the triplet @xmath13-wave pairing in sr@xmath101ruo@xmath1 also can be explained on the basis of this unified understanding .",
    "the obtained mechanism is a new one , which is different from the paramagnon mechanism . in general , the @xmath3-wave superconductivity is stabilized near the half - filling , while the @xmath13-wave superconductivity is stabilized apart from the half - filling .    * 2 . *",
    "the pseudogap phenomena arise from the sc fluctuation in the quasi - two - dimensional system .",
    "in addition to the quasi - two - dimensionality , the strong - coupling superconductivity possessing short coherence length @xmath196 is necessary for the appearance of the pseudogap phenomena .",
    "the sc fluctuation itself originates from attractive interactions induced by af spin fluctuation .",
    "starting with the repulsive hubbard hamiltonian , we have derived the pseudogap phenomena and succeeded in explaining not only the single particle properties but also the magnetic and transport ones consistently in the pseudogap region .",
    "it is important that the explanation of pseudogap is the natural extension of our theory applied to the other regions with different hole- and electron - dopings .",
    "a kind of resonance between quasi - particle states in fermi - liquid and cooper - pairing states give rise to the pseudogap .",
    "this is an essentially new physical phenomenon discovered in quasi - two - dimensional sces .",
    "the pseudogap above @xmath2 gains the energy without superconducting long - range order .",
    "* 3 . * among the anomalous properties in high-@xmath2 cuprates , we have made an important progress in the analysis of transport phenomena .",
    "it is shown that the vertex correction in the linear response theory ( kubo formula ) sometimes plays an essential role in sces .",
    "in other words , not only the properties of quasi - particles but also those of the residual interaction is necessary to understand the transport phenomena .",
    "for example , the hall coefficient , the magnetic penetration depth , and the nernst coefficient in high-@xmath2 cuprates are the cases .",
    "this is one of the characteristic features in the sces with significant momentum dependence .",
    "the seemingly anomalous behaviors in cuprates are reasonably explained on the basis of the fermi - liquid theory .",
    "* 4 . * to describe the superconductivity in sces",
    ", the following renormalization procedure offers an important perspective .",
    "first we include the on - site coulomb interaction and then , band energy and effective interaction are renormalized .",
    "the momentum dependence of the effective interaction between quasi - particles gives rise to the anisotropic superconductivity .",
    "this perspective gives the explanation on the enhanced jump of the specific heat at @xmath2 in heavy fermion materials .",
    "furthermore , important knowledge for the superconductivity in sces is obtained .",
    "for instance , by considering the renormalization effect due to electron correlation , we can show that the electron - phonon interaction is generally reduced by the renormalization factor @xmath200 compared with the electron - electron interaction .",
    "therefore , the @xmath8-wave pairing is almost impossible in heavy - fermion systems .",
    "the above argument is mainly related to a strategy to understand the superconductivity in heavy - fermion systems . by following this strategy ,",
    "we have analyzed the superconductivity in the ce - based and u - based heavy fermion superconductors .",
    "concerning the systems possessing not so heavy effective mass such as the @xmath3-electron and organic materials , we can treat simultaneously both the mass enhancement and the superconductivity , as has been done in this review .",
    "recently , the higher - order correction beyond the third - order perturbation theory , which is mainly used in this review , has been discussed .",
    "the fourth order perturbation with respect to @xmath14 has been performed by nomura and yamada ( appendix b ) .",
    "it is shown that the effective interaction for @xmath3-wave pairing converges very smoothly .",
    "the fourth - order terms considerably cancel each other and as a result , their contribution becomes small in total .",
    "the superconducting critical temperature also shows a good convergence .",
    "these results qualitatively justify the understanding reviewed in sec .",
    "3.2 . on the other hand ,",
    "the obtained critical temperatures for the @xmath13-wave pairing case show an oscillatory behavior with respect to the calculated order .",
    "this behavior originates from the oscillation in particle - particle scattering terms . for the @xmath13-wave case",
    ", the correction from the particle - particle ladder diagrams induces the important contribution to the quasi - particle interaction .",
    "as is well known , the particle - particle ladder terms can be collected up to the infinite order to give a smooth function .",
    "it is shown that rather convergent results are obtained by applying this procedure .",
    "thus , it is expected that the higher - order terms can be treated so as not to change the result obtained within the third - order perturbation theory .",
    "of course , the theory to treat the electron correlation in a closed form is highly desirable .",
    "the results given in appendix b imply a possibility to develop the theory of unconventional superconductivity in a closed form by starting with an appropriate renormalized form .    new superconducting systems are continuously found in the various systems such as heavy - fermion systems .",

    "however , the description based on the bogoliubov quasi - particle is similarly possible .",
    "the london constant @xmath63 is obtained by subtracting the paramagnetic contribution from the diamagnetic contribution .",

    "the interaction between the quasi - particles is taken into account in the same way as in the drude weight @xcite and in the cyclotron resonance frequency @xcite .",

    "however , the momentum dependence of the effective pairing interaction would not be affected at least qualitatively and thus , the most probable pairing symmetry would not be changed .",
    "now all fourth - order terms are at our hands , but unfortunately , it is not feasible task to perform faithfully the summation in momentum and frequency for the fourth - order terms . up to the third order",
    ", we could carry out the summation numerically both in momentum and frequency by exploiting the fast fourier transformation ( fft ) algorithm , but the fourth - order terms include contributions which can not be summed up in the same manner . in order to proceed to further calculations",
    ", we consider the momentum dependence @xmath939 on the fermi surface for @xmath935 and the anomalous self - energy @xmath122 .",
    "this simplification is justified as far as we discuss low - energy phenomena including superconductivity , for which the quasi - particles in the vicinity of the fermi level play the most important roles .",
    "we define @xmath940 points , @xmath941 ( @xmath942 ) , on the fermi circle .",
    "then , the effective interaction @xmath943 and the gap function @xmath944 are expressed as functions of the positions @xmath945 and @xmath946 on the fermi surface . by fixing momenta @xmath945 and @xmath946 on the fermi surface",
    ", we can numerically perform the summation with respect to the internal momenta and frequencies up to the fourth order with the use of fft algorithm .",
    "the above simplification is summarized as follows : @xmath947 where @xmath13 symbolically denotes @xmath13=@xmath948 , @xmath949 , @xmath950 , ... etc .",
    "the quantity @xmath951 is regarded as the scattering amplitude in the pair scattering process , where the two electrons ( or fermi - liquid quasi - particles ) with the momenta and spins , @xmath952 and @xmath953 , are scattered to the states characterized by the momenta and spins , @xmath954 and @xmath955 , respectively . as a result of the simplification for eq .",
    "( 16 ) , we obtain the bcs - like gap equation as @xmath956 where the summation @xmath957 is performed only with respect to the fermi surface points @xmath958 , and @xmath940 is the total number of the fermi surface points at which the vertex function @xmath959 and the gap function @xmath960 are calculated .",
    "@xmath961 is the circumference of the fermi circle , @xmath79 is the cut - off energy , and @xmath962 ) is the euler s constant .",
    "the cut - off energy is taken as @xmath963 throughout the present calculation .",
    "we can determine the transition temperature at which the maximum eigenvalue @xmath964 is equal to unity and the eigenfunction giving @xmath964 is related to the most probable pairing symmetry .",
    "details of the formulation are given in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "now we show the numerical results of the gap function @xmath965 and the transition temperatures as functions of the repulsion @xmath14 . for the case ( i )",
    ", we have taken the hopping parameters @xmath966 and @xmath967 and set the electron number as @xmath968 .",
    "the fermi surface is depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : afhf](a ) . the obtained gap function @xmath965 exhibits the @xmath16-wave state in all the cases of the second- , third- , and fourth - order perturbation theories .",
    "this may be natural if we recall that the momentum dependence of the pairing interaction is well approximated by using the susceptibility as @xmath969 in sec .",
    "3.2.2 for the superconductivity induced by the strong anti - ferromagnetic spin fluctuations .",
    "we show the transition temperatures as functions of the repulsion @xmath14 for the case ( i ) within the second- , third- , and fourth - order perturbation theories in fig .",
    "[ fig:4thdtc ] .",
    "the values of @xmath2 for the third- and fourth - order theories are quantitatively close to each other , although @xmath2 for the second - order theory is very low .",
    "if we further take account of the perturbation terms beyond fourth order , the curve of @xmath2 as a function of @xmath14 is considered to converge to a single curve , leading to a better estimation for @xmath2 than that of the present fourth - order calculation .",
    "let us discuss the validity of the perturbation expansion by comparing the magnitude of the third- and the fourth - order vertex functions , @xmath970 and @xmath971 .",
    "this naive analysis justifies the expansion in @xmath14 up to @xmath972 @xcite .",
    "although there are much more perturbation terms in the fourth order than in the second or third order , most of the fourth - order contributions cancel each other , and therefore the total magnitude of @xmath971 is smaller than that of @xmath970 .",
    "thus , the convergence of the perturbation expansion in @xmath14 becomes good up to moderately strong @xmath14 within the fourth - order perturbation theory .",
    "in addition , the momentum dependences of the functions , @xmath973 , @xmath970 , and @xmath971 are all similar to each other",
    ". therefore the perturbation expansion would give a good estimation of the effective pairing interaction and a reasonable analysis of the pairing symmetry up to moderately strong @xmath14 in this case .",
    "next we consider the other case ( ii ) . according to the recent work @xcite ,",
    "the convergence of the perturbation expansion is not good for the spin - triplet channel , in contrast to the spin - singlet channel near the half - filled case ( i ) . in one word ,",
    "this is due to an oscillatory behavior in terms of @xmath14 . as shown in sec .",
    "3.4.2 , the third - order terms give the momentum dependence much favorable for the @xmath13-wave pairing .",
    "after the momentum dependences of all fourth - order terms are examined , it is found that dominant contributions have the momentum dependence similar to that of the third - order term , but their signs are opposite .",
    "further analysis on higher - order terms has revealed that the contributions shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : vertcor ] provide the dominant momentum dependence in each order .",
    "these contributions in each higher - order term have positive ( negative ) sign for odd ( even ) order of @xmath14 and thus , these contributions can be summed up to the infinite order . for the pairing interaction ,",
    "then we use @xmath974 , which is obtained by adding the higher - order corrections shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : vertcor ] to @xmath975 . due to this improved procedure ,",
    "the most probable pairing symmetry is triplet @xmath13-wave .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : afahf ] , we show the fermi surface and the gap function for the case ( ii ) , where we have taken the hopping parameters @xmath966 and @xmath976 and set the electron number as @xmath977 .",
    "the gap functions obtained for the third - order and the above mentioned improved fourth - order perturbation theories show the highly anisotropic @xmath13-wave symmetry with the nodes on the line @xmath978=0 , while the gap function obtained in the second - order theory has eight additional nodes on the fermi surface .",
    "we show the transition temperature as functions of the repulsion @xmath14 in fig .",
    "[ fig : ptc ] .",
    "note that the second - order perturbation theory gives only low @xmath2 , because the momentum dependence of the effective interaction @xmath979 is less favorable for the triplet @xmath13-wave pairing than @xmath980 and @xmath981 .",
    "finally we again emphasize that the momentum dependence induced by the electron correlations is important for the anisotropic pairing in sces . in some cases , the picture that some magnetic fluctuations induce",
    "the anisotropic superconductivity would be valid .",
    "however , we could @xmath6 always consider that the essential momentum dependence of the pairing interaction originates from some strong fluctuations .",
    "the most essential point for anisotropic pairings is what momentum dependence the effective pairing interaction could acquire as a result of many - body effects or correlation effects , as we have stressed throughout this review article . in general",
    ", we could expect that the perturbation theories developed in this review capture qualitatively well the essential momentum dependences of the pairing interaction .",
    "it is highly believed that the anisotropic pairing deduced within the weak - coupling perturbation theory evolves smoothly up to the realistically strong @xmath14 .",

    "<S> * abstract * + in this article we review essential natures of superconductivity in strongly correlated electron systems ( sces ) from a universal point of view . </S>",
    "<S> first we summarize experimental results on sces by focusing on typical materials such as cuprates , bedt - ttf organic superconductors , and ruthenate sr@xmath0ruo@xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> experimental results on other important sces , heavy - fermion systems , will be reviewed separately . </S>",
    "<S> the formalism to discuss superconducting properties of sces is shown based on the dyson - gorkov equations . here </S>",
    "<S> two typical methods to evaluate the vertex function are introduced : one is the perturbation calculation up to the third - order terms with respect to electron correlation . </S>",
    "<S> another is the fluctuation - exchange ( flex ) method based on the baym - kadanoff conserving approximation . </S>",
    "<S> the results obtained by the flex method are in good agreement with those obtained by the perturbation calculation . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , a reasonable value of @xmath2 for spin - singlet @xmath3-wave superconductivity is successfully reproduced by using both methods for sces such as cuprates and bedt - ttf organic superconductors . as for sr@xmath0ruo@xmath1 exhibiting spin - triplet superconductivity </S>",
    "<S> , it is quite difficult to describe the superconducting transition by using the flex calculation . </S>",
    "<S> however , the superconductivity can be naturally explained by the perturbation calculation , since the third - order terms in the anomalous self - energy play the essential role to realize the triplet superconductivity . another important purpose of this article is to review anomalous electronic properties of sces near the mott transition , since the nature of the normal state in sces has been one of main issues to be discussed . </S>",
    "<S> especially , we focus on pseudogap phenomena observed in under - doped cuprates and organic superconductors . a variety of scenarios to explain the pseudogap phenomena based on the superconducting and/or spin fluctuations are critically reviewed and examined in comparison with experimental results . according to the recent theory , </S>",
    "<S> superconducting fluctuations , inherent in the quasi - two - dimensional and strong - coupling superconductors , are the origin of the pseudogap formation . in these compounds , </S>",
    "<S> superconducting fluctuations induce a kind of resonance between the fermi - liquid quasi - particle and the cooper - pairing states . </S>",
    "<S> this resonance gives rise to a large damping effect of quasi - particles and reduces the spectral weight near the fermi energy . </S>",
    "<S> we discuss the magnetic and transport properties as well as the single - particle spectra in the pseudogap state by the microscopic theory of the superconducting fluctuations . as for heavy - fermion superconductors , </S>",
    "<S> experimental results are reviewed and several theoretical analyses on the mechanism are provided based on the same viewpoint as explained above .    _ keywords _ : unconventional superconductivity , strongly correlated electron systems , fermi - liquid theory , dyson - gorkov equations , pseudogap phenomena , spin fluctuations , superconducting fluctuations .    </S>",
