    "early gan - based light emitting diodes exhibited an external quantum efficiency of 4% despite containing threading dislocations with a density exceeding @xmath2  @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "this fact was met with considerable surprise , since other iii - v semiconductors require drastically lower dislocation densities for reaching comparable efficiencies . to explain this phenomenon , it was proposed that dislocations in group - iii nitrides are more benign than in other iii - v compounds due to their high ionicity @xcite .",
    "alternatively , it was suggested that the diffusion length of minority charge carriers in gan is smaller than the average distance between dislocations @xcite . in later work , however , it was often reported that the diffusion length seems to be actually limited by this distance @xcite .    in cathodoluminescence ( cl ) or electron - beam induced current ( ebic ) maps of the surface of heteroepitaxial gan(0001 ) layers ,",
    "threading dislocations are observed as dark spots directly reflecting the fact that they represent nonradiative centers @xcite .",
    "intensity profiles recorded across these areas of reduced luminous efficiency contain , in principle , information on both the minority - carrier ( or , in gan , exciton ) diffusion length and the recombination strength of the dislocation @xcite .",
    "to determine these quantities , however , it is required to consider the generation , diffusion and recombination of electron - hole pairs in the presence of a surface and a dislocation both possessing finite recombination strengths .",
    "this problem belongs to the classical problems of semiconductor physics and is under investigation since the 1950s @xcite , but a general solution has not been obtained so far . in particular ,",
    "most of the existing theoretical work @xcite is restricted to either zero or infinite surface recombination velocity in addition to an infinite recombination strength at the dislocation , with the sole exception of the study by jakubowicz @xcite in which a finite recombination strength was introduced in an _ ad hoc _ fashion .",
    "this body of theoretical understanding has been largely ignored by experimentalists .",
    "et al_. @xcite were the first to correlate the outcrops of dislocations visible in atomic force micrographs of a gan(0001 ) layer with the contrast fluctuations in cl maps . due to the high dislocation density in the layer under investigation",
    ", individual dislocations were not resolved in the cl map , and the authors hence resorted to a simple phenomenological expression ( first proposed by suzuki and matsumoto @xcite ) for describing the impact of dislocations on the cl intensity . in subsequent experimental work ,",
    "individual dislocations were resolved in cl maps which would have been eligible objects for a more detailed analysis using appropriate models . however , in all of these studies @xcite , the simple expression proposed by rosner _",
    "et al_.@xcite was adopted despite the fact that it does not represent a sensible approximation of the intensity profile across threading dislocations even in the most simple case of zero surface recombination velocity and infinite recombination strength at the dislocations .",
    "this fact has recently been noted by yakimov @xcite , who pointed out that the analysis of the experimental data in this purely empirical way leads to a significant underestimation of the exciton diffusion length . as a consequence , values for the exciton diffusion length derived in this way from cl or ebic",
    "maps are to be viewed with caution @xcite . since either of these techniques gives , in principle , simultaneous access to three technologically important quantities ( the exciton diffusion length , the surface recombination velocity , and the dislocation recombination strength ) , the problem clearly merits further theoretical and experimental attention .",
    "in the present paper , we derive a rigorous analytical solution for the problem of excitons being generated within a finite volume and subsequently diffusing and recombining in the bulk as well as annihilating at the surface and at threading dislocations with arbitrary recombination velocities . for this purpose ,",
    "the reciprocity theorem @xcite is generalized .",
    "the solution of the problem for finite exciton recombination velocities at the planar surface is obtained by considering , instead of the half - space , a finite - thickness slab , whose thickness can be taken sufficiently large .",
    "this solution is also generalized for the case of thin films with finite recombination velocity at the back surface , as it is required for solar cells @xcite .",
    "the solution for a point source of excitons ( the green function ) is directly convolved with the numerically calculated distributions of excitons generated by electron beams of different energies .",
    "the results of the calculations are applied to describe the contrast of threading dislocations in a freestanding gan layer with an average distance between dislocations of more than 10 m. a fit of the expression derived in this work to an experimental profile yields both the exciton diffusion length and the recombination strength at the dislocation .",
    "we consider the generation of electron - hole pairs by an electron beam incident on the surface of a gan\\{0001 } layer with the three - dimensional generation function @xmath3 . because of the exciton binding energy of 26mev in gan",
    ", these electron - hole pairs rapidly bind to form excitons which then diffuse as a stable entity up to room temperature .",

    "nonradiative exciton annihilation at the surfaces is described by the boundary conditions @xmath10 where @xmath11 are the surfaces , @xmath12 the surface normals , @xmath13 the surface recombination velocities , and @xmath14 correspond to the planar surface of the half - space and the cylindrical surface of the dislocation , respectively .",
    "the total number of excitons annihilating at the respective surfaces is equal to the fluxes integrated over these surfaces , @xmath15 particularly , the flux of excitons to the planar surface @xmath16 can be measured in an ebic experiment , using a schottky barrier to dissociate excitons into electrons and holes and separating them prior to recombination .",
    "the cl intensity is proportional to the total number of excitons recombining radiatively in the bulk .",

    "since the measured cl intensity is arbitrarily scaled , the factor @xmath21 can be included in the normalization constant and is omitted in the further analysis .",

    ". then all cl curves tend to 1 in the limit @xmath175 .",
    "the result of this normalization is presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : absorb](d ) , and it is seen that the normalized intensity only weakly depends on the surface recombination velocity .",
    "note that the calculations in fig .",
    "[ fig : absorb ] are performed assuming that the dislocation line is a perfect sink for the excitons . if the dislocation possesses a finite recombination velocity ( finite @xmath25 ) , the contrast decreases , in the same way as it is shown by the dotted line in fig .  [ fig : reflcond](b ) .      ) and an exciton diffusion length of @xmath158  m. ]    the solutions obtained in sec .",
    "[ sec : calculation ] are the green functions that describe the cl and ebic signals due to a point source of excitons located at a distance @xmath61 from the dislocation line and at a depth @xmath62 .",
    "since the diffusion problem is linear , the solution for an arbitrary finite source of excitons can be obtained as the convolution integral ( [ eq:3a ] ) of the green function with the initial exciton distribution produced by the electron beam .",
    "we employ the common assumption @xcite that the number of thermalized electron - hole pairs ( and hence excitons ) produced in a volume element by the electron beam is proportional to the energy loss of the electrons in that volume , and use the monte carlo software @xmath176 @xcite to simulate the distributions of the energy losses at different acceleration voltages of the electron beam .",
    "we do not attempt to describe the initial exciton distribution by any analytical function , as it is done in other works @xcite .",
    "rather , we simulate the initial exciton distribution by @xmath176 on a @xmath177 grid and perform a direct summation of intensities considering each point of the grid as a point source , with the number of excitons in it proportional to the local energy loss of the electron beam .",
    "figures [ fig : source](a ) and [ fig : source](b ) compare , respectively , the cl and ebic profiles at different acceleration voltages , assuming that both the planar surface and the dislocation are perfect sinks for the excitons ( @xmath178 ) .",
    "one can see that , for low acceleration voltages up to 3  kv , the profiles are affected only in a very narrow range near the dislocation line . as the acceleration voltage is beyond 3  kv , however , the profiles broaden significantly and the contrast decreases .",
    "the cl profiles are noticeably broader than the ebic profiles .",
    "the widths of the cl profiles monotonously increase with the acceleration voltage , while the ebic profiles saturate at high acceleration voltages , since the excitons that are generated at depths exceeding the diffusion length do not reach the surface @xcite .      .",
    "the cl intensity is essentially uniform except at the outcrops of threading dislocations , where clearly defined dark spots are observed .",
    "the inset shows a magnified view of two threading dislocations . for further analysis ,",
    "a linescan was taken across the dislocation marked with a dashed circle ( see fig.[fig : clprofile ] ) . ]",
    "cl spectroscopy was carried out in a zeiss ultra55 field - emission scanning electron microscope equipped with a gatan monocl4 system and a he - cooling stage .",
    "a photomultiplier tube was used for the acquisition of panchromatic cl images .",
    "the acceleration voltage was set to 3  kv , and the probe current of the electron beam to 0.75  na , with the aim to minimize the generation volume of excitons as much as possible [ cf.fig.[fig:source](a ) ] .",
    "figure [ fig : climage ] presents a panchromatic cl map of a @xmath179  m thick free - standing gan(0001 ) layer grown by hydride vapor phase epitaxy . the average threading dislocation density present at the surface of this layer amounts to about @xmath0  @xmath1 , low enough to allow us to perform intensity line scans of individual dislocations not influenced by other ones .",
    "furthermore , the exciton diffusion length in this sample is certainly not limited by the average distance between dislocations .",
    "m , a surface recombination length of @xmath180  m , a dislocation radius @xmath159  nm , and a dislocation recombination length of @xmath181  m. ]    figure [ fig : clprofile ] compares an experimental intensity profile with the calculated one based on the analytical expressions derived in sec .",
    "[ subsec : finite ] and a summation over the initial spatial distribution of the excitons , simulated by the calculated energy loss distribution of the incident electron beam . as we have already seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : absorb](d ) , the cl intensity profile , after it is scaled such that the intensity far from the dislocation is unity , is fairly insensitive to the recombination velocity at the planar boundary .",
    "hence , we estimate the surface recombination length using the results of an independent experimental determination of the surface recombination velocity and the exciton lifetime in gan epilayers grown by metalorganic chemical - vapor deposition @xcite .",
    "this latter study provides values of @xmath182  @xmath183/s , @xmath184  cm / s , and @xmath185  ns , which gives @xmath186  m and @xmath187  m.    we fit the experimental curve in fig .",
    "[ fig : clprofile ] taking the surface recombination length fixed at @xmath180  m and obtain a diffusion length @xmath188  m , in an excellent agreement with the results of ref .",

    "m. when we fix the surface recombination length @xmath24 at values either larger or smaller by an order of magnitude , we obtain fits practically coinciding with the one shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : clprofile ] .",
    "the values of the exciton diffusion length and the dislocation recombination length are found to be @xmath189  m and @xmath190  m in the former and @xmath191  m and @xmath192  m in the latter case , respectively .",
    "these values provide an estimate of the accuracy in determination of the parameters in the case when the surface recombination length is not known .",
    "we have presented a rigorous , complete , and general solution for the problem of excitons with an arbitrary initial distribution recombining in the bulk as well as diffusing toward a planar ( the surface ) and a linear ( the dislocation ) defect both being characterized by arbitrary , finite recombination velocities .",
    "this solution gives access , in principle , to three technologically important quantities : the surface recombination velocity , the recombination strength at the dislocation , and the exciton diffusion length .",
    "our calculations have shown , however , that the former of these quantities has only a minor impact as long as the cl intensity can not be measured on an absolute scale . as a result ,",
    "normalized intensity profiles allow one to uniquely extract both the recombination strength at the dislocation and the exciton diffusion length .",
    "regarding the former , our analysis shows that the threading dislocations in gan(0001 ) layers are extremely efficient nonradiative centers , similar to those in other iii - v compounds @xcite . concerning the latter ,",
    "let us first stress that the diffusion length is not a material constant , as it seems to be often perceived , but a figure of merit for the purity and perfection of a given sample .",
    "more specifically , the diffusion length depends on the exciton diffusivity , and thus , via the einstein relation , on its mobility , as well as on its lifetime . at room temperature ,",
    "the exciton mobility should be limited by polar optical phonon scattering , and is thus expected to not vary significantly among samples with moderate defect densities . however ,",
    "the exciton lifetime in gan is still far from being determined by intrinsic radiative recombination , but is controlled by nonradiative , shockley - read - hall type recombination at defect states @xcite .",
    "the room temperature diffusion length in samples with very low dislocation density , as the one used in the present work , thus provides insight into the impact of point defects on the internal quantum efficiency of gan .",
