    "large efforts have been devoted to explore the origin of cosmic rays .",
    "most puzzling are the observed ultra - high energy cosmic ray events ( uhecrs ) above the gzk - cutoff @xcite : protons lose energy drastically due to pion photo - production processes on the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) at energies higher than @xmath6  ev , and this limits the proton mean free path to some tens of megaparsecs ( see @xcite and @xcite for more discussion on the gzk cut - off ) .",
    "two distinctly different classes of models are commonly considered , the top - down and bottom - up scenarios . in the former ones ,",
    "uhecrs are associated e.g. with the decay of some supermassive particles , whereas in the latter scenarios uhecrs are assumed to be accelerated by astrophysical objects ( e.g. @xcite , and for a latest review we refer the interested reader to @xcite ) .",
    "a growing number of bottom - up explanations have been proposed , including active galactic nuclei , gamma ray bursts and neutron stars . however , at present there seems to be no clear association of uhecr events with any of these objects although by tuning the model parameters one enables the highest energy events to be accounted for .",
    "identifying sources of the observed uhecr events remains uncertain and debated leaving room for speculation ( @xcite ) .",
    "as such we wish to consider in this paper the possibility that hypothetical quark novae ( hereafter , qne ; @xcite ) contribute to the cosmic ray flux , especially above @xmath3  ev . in the qn explosion",
    "the core of a neutron star ( ns ) shrinks into the equilibrated quark object / star ( qs ) .",
    "the overlaying crust material free - falls following the core contraction releasing enough energy to form an ultra - relativistic ejecta .",
    "the ultra - relativistic shock interaction with its surroundings environment ( namely the randomised relativistic wind of the progenitor ) leads to the first cosmic ray component in our model .",
    "the compact remnant acting as a magnetohydrodynamic propeller provides the second component , injecting ions to be boosted by the ultra - relativistic quark nova shock .",
    "most of the propelled wind of relativistic particles is injected into interstellar space with low energies ( from gev to tev ) , and these particles can be further on accelerated by galactic supernova shocks .",
    "thus the propeller can contribute to cosmic ray flux also below the knee as an injector .",
    "it appears that the qn model can largely contribute for the extragalactic cosmic rays above the ankle and contribute a few percent of the galactic cosmic rays around and below the knee .",
    "the main assumption in this paper is the conversion of a highly magnetised , rapidly spinning ns to a qs .",
    "this phase conversion ( or second explosion )  which remains to be confirmed  leads to unique conditions where two uhecr components are feasible .",
    "it is this unique aspect of the model that makes this investigation worth pursuing .",
    "we note however that the approach presented here ( including the acceleration mechanisms as related to the dynamics of the explosion ) borrows heavily from what has already been presented in the literature for models of uhecrs in the context of isolated pulsars and binary coalescence ( e.g. , @xcite to cite only few ) .",
    "this paper is presented as follows : we start with a brief review of the concept of quark nova and its features (  2 ) . in  3 we describe conditions under which the compact remnant is born in a propeller regime . in ",
    "4 we explain how cosmic rays are produced and isolate the two components ( with energies @xmath0 and @xmath1  ev ) .",
    "here we describe the qn compact remnant as an injector of relativistic particles to the galaxy . in  5 we predict uhecr events in future detectors and discuss multiple events and the isotropy of sources in our model . a discussion and a conclusion follow in  6",
    "it has been suggested that the core of neutron stars may deconfine to a composition of up ( @xmath7 ) and down ( @xmath8 ) quarks during or shortly after some supernova explosions when the central density of the proto - neutron star is high enough to induce phase conversion ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "it has also been speculated that when the density in the core increases further , a phase with strange quarks ( @xmath9 ) becomes energetically favoured over the pure _ ( u , d ) _ phase and soon the entire star is contaminated and converted into this _ ( u , d , s ) _ phase .",
    "this is one of the scenarios introduced to convert an entire ns to a qs ( e.g. , @xcite ) . in the qn picture",
    "the _ ( u , d , s ) _ core is assumed to shrink to a corresponding stable quark object before the contamination is spread over the entire star . by physically separating from the overlaying material ( hadronic envelope ) the core drives the collapse ( free - fall ) of the left - out matter leading to both gravitational energy and phase transition energy release as high as @xmath10  ergs ( @xcite ) .      the qn - ejecta consist mainly of heavy nuclei ( the ns crust ) , protons , electrons and neutrons .",
    "the total amount of the ejecta has been estimated to be of the order of @xmath11 with corresponding lorentz factor @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is the percentage of the qn energy transfered to the qn shock front which we assume to 10% .",
    "the radius of the newly formed qs is given by @xmath14 where the ns core density , @xmath15 , and the qs density , @xmath16 , scale as @xmath17 @xcite  _ hereafter parameters with no subscripts refer to the quark star_. the qs spins up during the phase transition due to contraction , with a rotational period @xmath18 . in the process , the magnetic field",
    "is amplified , @xmath19 .",
    "fall - back of material onto a newly formed quark star may take place ( similar to what has been suggested in the supernova case ; @xcite ) . in the early stages",
    "the accretion rate is given by @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the average density of fall - back matter ( @xmath22  g/@xmath23 , representing the crust material , and the matter below the neutron drip line densities ) .",
    "the hyper - eddington accretion rate given above is understood by noting that ( i ) the fall - back matter in the initial phase of the explosion is not accreted onto the surface ( but is propelled away before radiating ) , and ( ii ) the crust would not form in the early stages leaving the quark star bare ( not subject to the eddington limit since the bulk of the star is bound via strong interaction rather than gravity ; see e.g. @xcite , and @xcite for a recent discussion on the matter ) .",
    "for the remainder of this paper , we consider a qs ( ns ) mass of @xmath24 ( @xmath25 ) , a radius @xmath26  km ( @xmath27  km ) , a surface magnetic field of @xmath28  g ( @xmath29 g ) .",
    "since the fastest pulsar has a period of @xmath30  ms @xcite , we use @xmath31  ms as a representative value for the period @xmath32 of the new born quark star ( @xmath33 ms ) .",
    "clearly these are unique constraints ( millisecond , highly magnetised ns ) favouring a scenario where the qs forms immediately following a sn explosion , or that where the ns has been spun up by accretion from a companion .",
    "the newly born quark star is defined by its three critical radii : the keplerian `` co - rotation radius '' @xmath34 the magnetospheric radius at which the ram pressure of the in - falling matter balances the magnetic pressure @xmath35 ( see , e.g. @xcite ) , and the light cylinder radius @xmath36 given our fiducial values , the qs is born in the propeller regime @xcite , i.e. @xmath37 , where the infalling material may be accelerated in a wind that carries away angular momentum from the magnetosphere and hence from the qs itself (  4.2 ) .",
    "note that the propeller regime is only possible if the quark star is born with a magnetic field exceeding the critical value @xmath38 g , which corresponds to a parent neutron star initial magnetic field @xmath39 g. here  c \" stands for  critical \" while the factor 4 ( derived from our fiducial values ) is the result of the amplification of the magnetic field following the quark - nova explosion .",
    "these critical values explain our assumption of a highly magnetised , rapidly spinning ns .",
    "the star loses rotational energy at a rate defined by the gravitational radiation losses ( @xmath40 ) , electromagnetic radiation losses ( @xmath41 ) and the propeller s torque ( @xmath42 ) .",
    "that is , @xmath43 with @xcite @xmath44 where @xmath45 is the moment of inertia and @xmath13 the equatorial eccentricity ; and with @xcite @xmath46 the spin - down due to the propeller is @xcite @xmath47 the expression above assumes that the material flung away by the propeller effect has been accelerated to an angular speed corresponding to that of the star .",
    "we note that gravitational losses would be important in the spin - down for very short periods @xmath48  ms ( not our case ) and propeller losses dominate over the electromagnetic dipole radiation losses given our accretion rates .",
    "the propeller regime lifetime can be obtained using eq .",
    "( [ eq7 ] ) and eq .",
    "( [ eq10 ] ) .",
    "we find , assuming a constant accretion rate , @xmath49 where @xmath50 and @xmath51 , initial and final periods , are in milliseconds .",
    "for a constant accretion rate , and taken the total amount of the qn ejecta , the lifetime of the propeller phase would not exceed a hundred seconds during which time the qs would have spun - down by no more than 30% thus remaining within milliseconds period . following this phase ,",
    "the spin - down is governed by the magnetic dipole radiation losses of the qs .",
    "we assume that the pulsar wind is composed of electron - positron pairs and ions , as would be expected if pulsars operate as open - circuited systems with ions carrying the return current @xcite .",
    "some fraction of ions can be heavy like iron , originating from the surface of the pulsar .",
    "we also assume that the wind has been subject to a termination shock as to acquire a randomised direction of particle momenta @xcite .",
    "the number density of electron - positron pairs is @xmath52 ( @xmath53 is the goldreich - julian density ; @xcite ) where @xmath54 is the electron charge .",
    "we adopt @xmath55 as the relativistic factor of most of the wind particles ( see e.g. @xcite ) , and the ratio of ions to electron - positron pairs to be @xmath56 ; ions carrying most of the energy of the wind . for future purposes , we write the ion density as @xmath57 where the index @xmath58 describes the radial dependency",
    ".    the qn ejecta will interact with the parent ns wind .",
    "the randomised wind particles will be boosted with one shock crossing by a factor of @xmath59 before they leave the region .",
    "the maximum number of particles that can be accelerated is limited by the qn fireball energy and can be written as ( here the energy of the pairs will be negligible , since energetically they are at much lower gamma factors due to synchrotron losses ) @xmath60 where @xmath61 is the proton mass , @xmath62 can vary from @xmath63 to @xmath64 ( iron ) and @xmath13 is the fraction of qn energy transferred via the qn shock to the pulsar wind particles . if all ions are protons and approximately accelerated to the energies of the ankle ( around @xmath65  ev ) , then up to @xmath66 particles would gain that energy .",
    "heavier ions will correspondingly reach higher energies with the same total relativistic factor @xmath67 , e.g. iron will easily gain energies over @xmath68  ev . therefore in this model at higher energies there should be a natural increase in heavier ions . since the above follows closely calculations already presented in @xcite , the corresponding spectrum also in our case can be shown to be @xmath69 or even flatter given its dependency on @xmath70 .",
    "we would like to emphasize that further studies of our model are needed in order to make better predictions of the spectrum .",
    "such an injection spectrum might agree with agasa measurements but let us recall that in the high energy region we discuss here , currently there seems to be a disagreement between the agasa ground array ( takeda et al .",
    "1999 ) and the hires fluorescence detector ( abu - zayyad et al .",
    "2002 ) which seems consistent with the gzk - cutoff .",
    "clearly there is a need for much larger experiments such as auger , euso , and owl , that can increase the number of detected events by one or two orders of magnitude before the injection spectrum is known conclusively .",
    "as we have said , for now , our model lacks the details to predict the exact spectrum .",
    "the number of particles per unit volume from qne in all the galaxies is @xmath71 , where @xmath72 is the residence time of a particle at the ankle initially injected at higher energy @xcite .",
    "the qn rate per galaxy is given by @xmath73 while @xmath74 is the galaxy density . with @xmath75  yr@xmath76 and @xmath77  mpc@xmath78 , this implies @xmath79 as compared to the observed value @xmath80  @xmath81  s@xmath76  ster@xmath76 ( 1 event per square kilometer per year ; @xcite ) , assuming @xmath82 . for particles at energies higher than @xmath65 ev we used an average @xmath83  gyr ( biermann&strittmatter 1987 ; berezinsky & grigoreva 1988 ; bertone et al .",
    "2002 ; see also figure 5 in sigl 2004b ) .",
    "the qn flux calculated above is short of the observed one unless the qn is very efficient in transferring energy via the qn shock into relativistic particles .",
    "however the presence of large scale magnetic field complicates the interpretation of uhecrs data and could lead to an overestimate of the observed flux .",
    "more specifically , the energy spectrum of particles emitted from a ( nearby ) source depends very strongly on the relative position of the observed source and the observer to the direction of the large scale field . in some cases",
    "the flux can be enhanced by a factor of @xmath84 for energies below @xmath5 ev ( see stanev et al .",
    "2003 and references therein ) .",
    "the observed flux and spectrum might not reflect the ones at the source making uncertain a direct comparison with the numbers derived above .",
    "the ejecta remain in expansion phase until the shock starts to decelerate .",
    "the transition between these two phases occurs at a radius @xmath85 at which the energy in the swept - up material becomes of the order of the energy released in the qn , i.e when a large fraction of the fireball energy has been used to reaccelerate the wind particles ( @xcite ) .",
    "using eq.([ni ] ) , @xmath86 which gives @xmath87  cm for @xmath88 .",
    "if the ion density decreases as @xmath89 ( @xmath90 ) , the fireball will be in the expansion phase much longer and the distance should be defined by using interstellar matter density together with the wind ( we estimate @xmath91 cm for @xmath92 ) .",
    "these numbers will define the timescale of the highest energy cosmic ray component acceleration .",
    "the case with @xmath93 would more closely follow the magnetic field value and therefore the charge density of the pairs .",
    "we use it as an example .",
    "the corresponding time is @xmath94  s. if all wind particles are iron , then the timescale would be shorter , @xmath95  s. one should notice however that the ion density profile in the pulsar wind bubble is not known and therefore the timescale of the expansion phase could be much larger ( with @xmath96 up to weeks ) .",
    "the second cosmic ray component occurs when rapidly rotating millisecond pulsars with large magnetic fields , @xmath97 g , undergo a qn explosion . in this case",
    "the born qs is in the propeller regime ( see  3 ) .",
    "the material flung away by the propeller expands as a magneto - hydrodynamic wind to reach the speed of light ( with lorentz factors up to @xmath98 at the light cylinder for @xmath99 g ; see @xcite for detailed calculations ) .",
    "the mhd nature of the propeller ensures that acceleration occurs at large distances from the star where synchrotron losses are likely to be minimum . as demonstrated in @xcite the magnetic field above the alfvn surface",
    "is predominantly toroidal .",
    "such a geometry will allow the particles to escape freely along the poloidal direction in the acceleration zone without being deflected by the magnetic field lines .",
    "particles with @xmath100 can reach eventually the qn shock , as to reach lorentz factors as high as @xmath101 .",
    "it is roughly @xmath102  ev for protons and @xmath3  ev for iron in one shock crossing .",
    "since an efficient propeller needs strong magnetic field and a short period , this component is created in young pulsars soon after the supernova explosion or in binaries where the neutron star spins up ( which also provides extra mass to trigger the qn ) .",
    "if the propeller works with the extreme accretion rate of @xmath103  g  s@xmath76 , then the rate of particle number is @xmath104  s@xmath76 .",
    "that is , after one crossing , where a particle is boosted by a factor @xmath105 , the energy in time unit used to accelerate the propeller wind is @xmath106 ; only the particles with @xmath107 will be accelerated by the qn shock .",
    "this indicates that particle acceleration consumes the energy of the shock wave in @xmath108 ms , and the shock dies out .",
    "we expect the propeller to function efficiently in its early stages with most particles acquiring @xmath109 . in reality",
    "this timescale is longer because the propeller wind particles can not propagate straightforwardly to the shock ( due to magnetic field and turbulence ) , their energies must have spread out and the most energetic particles reach the shock first ; nevertheless , it is short compared to the timescale of the expansion phase .",
    "it also means that a tiny amount of the bulk of the propeller wind will be accelerated to energies of the order of @xmath110  ev and at most up to @xmath3  ev for those few particles that managed to get one more kick in the process . here again , given the many similarities to the calculations and approach presented in @xcite , we expect the boosted propeller wind to acquire a power law spectrum , @xmath111 with @xmath112 .",
    "using the milky way dimensions with a radius of 15  kpc and a scale height of @xmath113 1  kpc , we obtain the number density of galactic cosmic rays for one qn to be of the order of @xmath114 .",
    "we assume a leaky box model @xcite for the galactic cosmic rays diffusing out of the galaxy where we adopt the leakage timescale expressed as @xmath115 ( see e.g. webber 1998 ; biermann et al . , 2001 and biermann & sigl , 2001 ) .",
    "the estimated time - averaged flux in our model is , @xmath116 which is similar to the observed value of @xmath117  @xmath81  s@xmath76  ster@xmath76 ( @xcite ) as long as the hyper - eddington accretion rates can be accepted and if the accelerated particles are mainly protons .",
    "notice that below the knee @xmath118 is too low to account for the observed cosmic ray flux ; the shock is not energetic enough to accelerate more particles as to extend the spectrum to lower energies .",
    "therefore , the steeper spectrum above the knee provided by the qn shock can not dominate at energies below the knee .",
    "more important , the flux in  eq.(14 ) is averaged over time , @xmath119 . above the knee",
    "the cosmic ray diffusion time is shorter than the qn occurrence , @xmath120 .",
    "for example , at the knee @xmath121 years for protons and it is @xmath122 years at the ankle , while the qn occurrence time is @xmath123 years .",
    "therefore the propelled wind of the qn model can account for the galactic cosmic ray flux locally , i.e. in the vicinity and shortly after the qn event . over the whole galaxy and in timescales",
    "longer than millions of years , qne can contribute on average a few percent of the galactic cosmic rays around the knee .",
    "closer to the ankle the contribution is negligible due to the very short diffusion time @xmath124 .",
    "more accurate estimates of the leakage times at high energies and qne occurrence would be needed to make the above conclusions firm .",
    "in particular , the qn rate carries substantial uncertainties ; among them the difficulty of determining the critical density for the transition to quark matter , the burden of not knowing which equation of state better describes the parent ns , and the lack of a complete theory that can describe the qcd phase diagram that would describe the path followed by the ns during its transition to a quark star .",
    "we note however that recent studies show that qn rates can be as high @xmath125 ( yasutake , hashimoto , & eriguchi 2004 ) . which is above our fiducial value of @xmath126 .",
    "finally , since the propelled wind consists of the crust material of the parent ns , we expect this cosmic ray component to be rich in heavier ions , up to iron .",
    "their rigidity ( @xmath127 ) means that these heavy nuclei would leak out of the galaxy at a lower rate than protons .",
    "it implies an increase of the heavy nuclei to hydrogen ratio in the chemical composition over time for those cosmic rays originating in qne .      in our model",
    "the propeller injects relativistic particles .",
    "as discussed above , some of this propelled material can be re - accelerated by the qn shock .",
    "the remaining bulk will populate interstellar space .",
    "these particles with lorentz factors @xmath128 ( or energies 1 - 1000  gev for protons ) could later be reaccelerated by galactic supernova shocks . for the number of injected particles",
    "a simple estimate gives @xmath129 that are accelerated to gev energies by the propeller .",
    "here @xmath130 is the maximum rotational energy of the qs . using eq .",
    "[ mwrays ] this implies @xmath131 , which is a few percent of the observed value ( see e.g. @xcite ) . in this case the particle density in the galaxy can reach @xmath132 from a single qn using up the qs rotational energy .",
    "the spectrum of the population of these injected particles will be shaped by later encounters and acceleration by galactic supernova shocks .",
    "we note here as well that at most a few percent of the cosmic rays below the knee can be of the qn origin .",
    "the qn model predicts three cosmic ray components , two galactic ones and an extragalactic one .",
    "this should in principle lead into transitions or steps in the cosmic ray flux .",
    "the galactic components will be subject to many sn shocks that will smoothen the discontinuity around the knee .",
    "note however that these signatures will be dwarfed by the much higher contribution from other galactic cosmic ray sources . having",
    "shown that qne are candidate sources of uhecrs above the ankle , we next discuss how observational features can be explained within the qn model .",
    "with a rate of @xmath133 per galaxy per year and a galaxy density @xmath134  mpc@xmath78 one should expect about @xmath135  qne a year within a @xmath136  mpc sphere .",
    "this 100  mpc region contains galactic and intergalactic magnetic field regions to which gzk - energy cosmic rays are subject to .",
    "this may lead to arrival time delay and therefore clustering of events around the source .",
    "the arrival timescales can spread from years to millions of years depending on the strength and the configuration of the magnetic field as well as the distance to the qn . here",
    "we refer the interested reader to sigl ( 2004a ) for a recent discussion on the effect of the magnetic field on the ultra - high energy cosmic rays . given these numbers",
    ", there may be a tiny energy window with the particles clustering within a few degrees towards the source ( e.g , kronberg 1994a and 1994b ) .",
    "this wishful possibility lead us to consider such events in the future detectors what we refer to as observational particle astronomy .",
    "naturally , such observations will be better guided if the qn can be detected by other means as well ( e.g. x - rays , gamma - rays ) .",
    "the energy lost by the uhecrs as they propagate and interact with the cosmic microwave background is transformed by cascading into secondary gev - tev photons ( protheroe&stanev 1996 ) .",
    "this tev - gamma - uhecr trace could in principle be detected in the future ( catenese&weekes 1999 ) and be used to test our model ( see discussion in akerlof et al . 2003 and references therein ) .",
    "however photons and uhecrs may have very different arrival times that are not easily quantified .",
    "this again calls for better understanding of magnetic field effects before such connections between the tev photons and the related uhecrs can be made .",
    "also , since protons can be accelerated up to @xmath137 ev in our model , significant neutrino fluxes ( with energies above @xmath3 ev ) can be generated ( e.g. , waxman&bahcall 1999 ; engel et al .",
    "this is below the currently advertised threshold of @xmath138 ev for euso and owl and most of the potential events will go undetected ( halzen&hooper 2002 ) .",
    "nevertheless future neutrino detectors should be able to signal any neutrino - uhecr trace with the arrival direction of ultra - high - energy neutrinos as a good indication of the qn location .",
    "the above mentioned traces are the subject of another study of qne as sources of uhecrs .      assuming that the cosmic rays above the ankle are accelerated in qne , we obtain roughly @xmath139 particles above @xmath5  ev per qn .",
    "the integrated flux f per unit area from one qn is @xmath140 where the @xmath141 is the qn distance .",
    "this is the total flux integrated over time including the spread in arrival time induced by magnetic fields , which can vary from years to millions of years ( sigl 2004a ) . in a detector like auger",
    "this implies ( integrated over the year and aperture and assuming that the qn is within the sky coverage ) few hundred events per one qn at a distance of 100  mpc . in a detector like euso and owl",
    "one can expect one to two orders of magnitude more events per qn .",
    "if the time delay and thus the spread in arrival time is e.g. 1000 years , one could expect doublets and triplets around a given qn within 10 year time in auger , and equivalently dozens of clustered events with euso and owl . for completeness",
    ", if the average time delay of cosmic rays above @xmath5  ev is around 1000  years , in our model it would mean that uhecrs from roughly 100 qne can presently be detected within 100  mpc .      unlike the arrival directions of uhecrs , the galaxy distribution is not isotropic within 100  mpc distance .",
    "this may mean that uhecr accelerators are not all within galaxies .",
    "it is natural to attribute uhecr sources to galaxies and the almost perfect isotropy , sofar observed both below and above the ankle ( e.g. torres&anchordoqui 2004 ) , to magnetic fields . despite the uncertainties on the magnetic field strength",
    "it has indeed been shown that if our local supercluster contains a large scale magnetic field it can provide sufficient bending to the cosmic ray trajectories ( sigl , lemoine & biermann 1999 ; farrar&piran 2000 ) .",
    "heavy ions like iron , if present in the pulsar wind , will have unique consequences .",
    "iron has a higher cutoff energy ( @xcite ) than lighter nuclei thus allowing a longer path of propagation in a tiny energy window allowing for more distance sources to contribute to the flux .",
    "furthermore , being bent in galactic and intergalactic fields , heavy nuclei would acquire a more isotropic distribution of arrival directions than protons .",
    "finally , heavy nuclei will naturally acquire higher energies than protons and contribute to the extreme end of the uhecr flux in our model .    of interest to the qn model ,",
    "old population pulsars with large peculiar velocities to @xmath142 km s@xmath76 and their mean three - dimensional speed is @xmath143 km s@xmath76 ( lyne & lorimer , 1994 ) . ]",
    "could cover tens of mpc distances from their origins in a hubble time .",
    "some of these run - away pulsars may undergo a qn explosion as a result of an increase of their core densities following spin down or accretion from the surrounding space .",
    "this would lean towards a more isotropic distribution - the extent of isotropy in the runaway pulsar population remains to be determined - of the arrival directions of the uhecrs ( the qn - shock boosted pulsar wind ) .",
    "this favours weak magnetic field ( @xmath144 g ) millisecond pulsars in our model , with the assumption that these old isolated pulsars still sustain their wind bubbles .",
    "we note that these candidates are probably not born in the propeller regime following the qn explosion , given their weak magnetic field and long periods ( see   3 ) .",
    "for a given distant extragalactic qn source the more energetic particles should arrive first since the associated time delay induced by the intergalactic magnetic fields is short",
    ". therefore it would appear as if there is a monoenergetic flux of particles from the source at one given time .",
    "later , the lower energy particles will arrive with larger time delay ( g. sigl - private communication ) .",
    "in the case of galactic cosmic rays , the propelled wind consists of the crust material of the parent ns ; the rigidity ( @xmath127 ) implies that the heavy nuclei would leak out of the galaxy at a lower rate than that of protons .",
    "we thus expect an increase of the heavy - nuclei - to - hydrogen ratio in the chemical composition over time scales of some ten thousand years for cosmic rays originating in qne .",
    "note , however , that this is effect is local and could have importance only if we detect a nearby quark star . if the star has undergone a qn phase in the past , the local cosmic ray composition may reflect the time passed since the qn explosion .",
    "the cosmic ray acceleration in the qn model consists of three different components as illustrated in figure  1 .",
    "the first component is due to the acceleration of the high energy particles in the pulsar wind bubble by the qn shock .",
    "we predict few hundred uhecr events above @xmath5 ev for the pierre auger detector per a distant qn , while some thousands are predicted for the proposed euso and owl detectors .",
    "magnetic fields can lead into clustering of the predicted events with timescales spread from years to millions of years .",
    "the second component stems from qne with the compact remnant born in the propeller regime ( pulsars with high magnetic field and small period undergoing a qn explosion immediately following a sn ) ejecting relativistic particles with @xmath128 .",
    "the particles with @xmath145 will eventually interact with the qn shock , as to reach roughly @xmath102  ev ( protons ) and @xmath3  ev ( iron ) in one shock crossing .",
    "given the energy of the qn shock , only a tiny amount of the propelled wind particles can be accelerated , i.e. a maximum of @xmath146 particles around the knee energy ( see eq .  [ mwrays ] ) .",
    "the propelled particles that were not accelerated by the qn shock are injected into the galactic space and will eventually become accelerated by the supernova shocks in the galaxy .",
    "qne as possible uhecr sources seem to account for the observed extragalactic flux and can contribute partially ( a few percent ) to the galactic cosmic rays .",
    "we conclude by stating that despite the fact that there is no guarantee that qne occur in nature , the model possesses features that can be tested in future cosmic ray detectors .    we thank the anonymous referee for the constructive comments that challenged our cosmic ray model and that helped us improve it .",

    "<S> we explore acceleration of ions in the quark nova ( qn ) scenario , where a neutron star experiences an explosive phase transition into a quark star ( born in the propeller regime ) . in this picture , </S>",
    "<S> two cosmic ray components are isolated : one related to the randomized pulsar wind and the other to the propelled wind , both boosted by the ultra - relativistic quark nova shock . </S>",
    "<S> the latter component acquires energies @xmath0 while the former , boosted pulsar wind , achieves ultra - high energies @xmath1  ev . the composition is dominated by ions present in the pulsar wind in the energy range above @xmath2  ev , while at energies below @xmath3  ev the propelled ejecta , consisting of the fall - back neutron star crust material from the explosion , is the dominant one . </S>",
    "<S> added to these two components , the propeller injects relativistic particles with lorentz factors @xmath4 , later to be accelerated by galactic supernova shocks . </S>",
    "<S> the qn model appears to be able to account for the extragalactic cosmic rays above the ankle and to contribute a few percent of the galactic cosmic rays below the ankle . </S>",
    "<S> we predict few hundred ultra - high energy cosmic ray events above @xmath5  ev for the pierre auger detector per distant qn , while some thousands are predicted for the proposed euso and owl detectors . </S>"
