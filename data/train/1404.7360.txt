    "for living cells , motility is as essential to their life as are the nutrients that sustain it .",
    "if food becomes scarce in the vicinity of a cell , this must move to survive . as neatly explained in wolgemuth s recent review",
    "@xcite , cell motion involves interaction with the environment : to move , a cell must exert an _ active _ force on its environment , which is counteracted by a _",
    "resistive _ force , or reaction . at the cellular length scale inertia is negligible , hence a motion results only from the balance of the active force produced by the cell and the reactive force exerted by the environment . a cell that stops producing a propelling force",
    "is brought to a halt in virtually no time .",
    "one way of classifying cellular motion is by distinguishing the environments against which a cell moves into two gross categories : fluids and solids . in the former case ,",
    "a cell is a _ swimmer _ , as it moves surrounded by a resistive fluid , in the latter case , it is a _ surfer _ , as it moves about a rigid surface .",
    "like most gross classifications , also this joins the advantage of simplicity to the disadvantage of inexactness . according to @xcite , what we called a _ surfer _",
    "actually may exhibit one or more of the following different motility patterns , namely , _ swarming _",
    ",    _ twitching _ , _ sliding _ , and _",
    "gliding_. this paper will only be concerned with the latter .",
    "we shall adopt here the neat definition of gliding given by jarosch  @xcite in 1962 ( also reproduced in @xcite ) :    _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ gliding _ is `` the active movement of an organism in contact with a solid substratum where there is neither a visible organ responsible for the movement nor a distinct change in the shape of the organism .

    "here we are mainly concerned with modeling quantitatively the possible connection between slime extrusion and thrust force on the bacterium that secretes it .",
    "it should be clear from the start that the mechanism that we shall envisage is different from that of jet propulsion in the absence of inertia that has recently been studied in @xcite for swimming bacteria : in this view , it is not the slime extrusion that generates the propelling thrust , but the adhesion of the secreted slime on the rigid substrate that sustains the advancing motion .",
    "we shall return later to the gliding mechanism modeled in this paper , after having briefly reviewed the families of bacteria to which it could be potentially applied .",
    "many bacteria glide over surfaces , including cyanobacteria and myxobacteria @xcite .",
    "the former are among the fastest gliders , with a velocity as high as @xmath0 @xcite , whereas the latter are among the slowest , with _",
    "myxococcus xanthus _  going at the most at a speed of @xmath1 , @xmath2 slower than typical flagellated bacteria @xcite .    _",
    "_  is presumably the most studied among gliding bacteria for the variety of propulsion mechanisms it exhibits and the complexity of its life cycle .",
    "it is a common gram - negative bacterium that lives in the soil @xcite ; it is rod - shaped with typical length and diameter of @xmath3-@xmath4 and @xmath5 , respectively .",
    "_ m. xanthus _  makes use of two genetically distinct mechanisms for gliding ; one , the other , or both may be present in an individual cell .",
    "one mechanism , called _ social _ , is characteristic of synergetic , coordinated motions involving a colony of cells @xcite , while the other , called _ adventurous _ , is typical of single cells living at the outskirts of a colony @xcite .",
    "what distinguishes social from adventurous gliding in _",
    "m. xanthus _",
    "is not just the collective character of the former , as opposed to the solipsism of the latter .",
    "they also differ in their mechanics .",
    "extrusion and retraction of pili are involved in social gliding : each cell emits a filament , typically of nearly @xmath6 in diameter and a few microns in length , which adheres to either the supporting substrate or to another cell nearby ; by retracting the adhered filament , a cell propels itself in coordination with those in its vicinity .",
    "if social gliding of _ m. xanthus _  is rather well understood , its adventurous gliding remains a mystery .",
    "apart from not being powered by pili , little is known about the actual mechanism of adventurous gliding of myxobacteria , as none of the hypotheses advanced so far has proven able to explain the full body of available experimental evidence .",
    "one such hypothesis , put forward nearly 90 years ago @xcite , hinges on the observation that myxobacteria secrete slime @xcite . more recently , wolgemuth _ et al . _",
    "@xcite gave direct evidence that slime extrusion is associated with the adventurous gliding of _",
    "m. xanthus _",
    ": the micrographs in fig .",
    "[ fig : mx_micrograph ] ,    which lately have been repeatedly reproduced , are rather striking illustrations of the slime filaments ejected by the cell .",
    "a mathematical model was also proposed in @xcite to describe the extrusion of slime from the cell s nozzles ; it treated it as a polyelectrolyte gel and assumed that its extrusion resulted from the swelling induced by a hydration process taking place within the nozzle s body .",
    "this rather sophisticated jet emission mechanism allowed for an estimate of the propelling force , which was found sufficient to explain the observed gliding velocity both for myxobacteria and cyanobacteria .",
    "an opposing hypothesis has recently been advanced , according to which adventurous motility is provided by protein motors distributed along the length of the cell , which tend to form complexes that remain stationary relative to the supporting rigid substrate while the bacterium moves @xcite .",
    "focal adhesion _ complexes seem to require slime secreted underneath the cell both to produce specific adhesion sites and to lubricate the area of contact between cell and substrate , as also confirmed by some other recent observations @xcite . also compromising hypotheses",
    "have been proposed to the effect of regarding both slime extrusion and focal adhesion as viable coexisting mechanisms for myxobacteria gliding .",
    "no wonder if in such a state of affairs controversies have grown @xcite .",
    "one , in particular , concerned the necessity for a gliding cell to rotate along its long axis while advancing : this was first believed to be the case for the focal adhesion theory to be confirmed , as the _ m. xanthus _  cytoskeleton along which the motive proteins are supposed to move is helicoidal with axis coincident with the cell s long axis @xcite .",
    "very recently , evidence has been brought against cell rotation @xcite , though _ per se _ this would neither rule out completely the focal adhesion hypothesis @xcite , nor prove the slime extrusion hypothesis .    as controversial as this latter hypothesis may be to explain in full the gliding of myxobacteria , since the work of hoiczyk and baumeister @xcite , it is well established as an explanation for the gliding of cyanobacteria .",
    "these latter are filamentous bacteria ( blue - green algae ) with a number of septa , for which the slime extrusion hypothesis assumes that slime filaments are ejected through the pores that surround each cell septum ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "hoiczyk and baumeister showed in @xcite how slime formed bands about the cell surface that could be removed by a fluid flow .",
    "they also were able to establish that the slime was emanated at a rate of @xmath7 , which compared well with the gliding velocity ( a coincidence to which we shall return later ) .",
    "a previous study had shown the distribution of pores ( @xmath8-@xmath9 in diameter ) close to the cyanobacteria septa @xcite .",
    "these pores were recognized in @xcite as parts of a more complex system ( called _ junctional pore complex _ ) which appeared to constitute the extrusion organelles @xcite .",
    "figure  [ fig : nostoc ] presents recent optical images illustrating the gliding of a _ nostoc _  cyanobacterium , belonging to the _ nostocales _  , a group that contains most of the cyanobacteria capable of gliding @xcite .",
    "the general mathematical model put forward in @xcite builds on the assumption that external fluids perfuse into the nozzle - like organelles hydrating the polysaccharide material constituting the slime ; the swelling thus produced forces the slime out of the pores and causes the swollen gel to fall on the substrate and adhere to it .",
    "this , as it were , produces a footing for the cell to advance in a way that only superficially resembles walking @xcite .",
    "though the extrusion mechanism and the force associated with the gel swelling are fairly well described by the model in @xcite , to my knowledge , the forces associated with both adhesion and footing have not yet been studied . in particular",
    ", it would be desirable to know how the propelling force would be determined by the full gliding mechanism , which includes slime extrusion , adhesion , and footing",
    ".    this will be the subject of this paper , which builds on a theory that has recently been proven useful to explain the forces at play in the popular , fascinating phenomenon of the _ chain fountain _ @xcite , a common chain that under the action of gravity alone raises spontaneously out of the pot that contains it before plunging down towards the floor @xcite .",
    "the feature of the theory presented in @xcite that distinguishes it from the earlier theory of biggins and warner @xcite is the assumption that the pickup and putdown points of the steady , shape preserving motion of the chain fountain are standing _ shocks _ that dissipate energy at the rate dictated by a classical law for internal impacts . here",
    "the same theory is applied to the extruded slime filament , which comes in contact with the substrate over which a bacterium glides . both the _ foot _",
    ", where contact is established between filament and substrate , and the _ pore _ , where the filament is extruded from the bacterium , will be treated as _ dissipative shocks _ , though of two different natures .",
    "figure  [ fig : cartoon ] illustrates the model : a cigar - shaped bacterium glides on a flat substrate with constant velocity @xmath10 while ejecting a slime filament from its back ( actually , the bacterium is apolar and its temporary back is just the end opposite to the direction of its motion ) .    ; both its pore and its foot are represented as thick ( red ) points . ]    in a steady gliding motion , the foot itself glides over the substrate and the filament shape is dislocated in time in the substrate rest frame . however , in the bacterium rest frame , both the filament shape and its foot remain unchanged as time elapses , making the extruded filament completely analogous to the `` ejected '' chain studied in @xcite . in this frame , both the ejecting pore and the adhering foot of the filament will be regarded as standing shocks ; they will be treated following a paper of oreilly and varadi  @xcite who , elaborating on earlier work of green and naghdi  @xcite , proposed an elegant and rather comprehensive theory of shocks in one - dimensional continua , which in section  [ sec : shocks ] is extended to the case at hand .",
    "section  [ sec : shocks ] , which is largely based on @xcite and serves the purpose of making our development here self - contained , is split in several subsections to make it easier for the reader retrace the different elements of the theory developed here . in section  [ sec",
    ": gliding ] , we shall describe in quantitative terms the solution that the theory recalled in section  [ sec : shocks ] affords for a gliding bacterium . in particular , we shall compute both the bacterium gliding velocity and the force resulting on it from the complete motion of the extruded slime filament .",
    "one simple result , which has already echoed in the observations recalled above , will follow from a kinematic compatibility condition on shock propagation , that is , that the absolute gliding velocity must equal the relative extrusion velocity .",
    "the analysis in section  [ sec : shocks ] does not neglect gravity and in a way treats the ejected slime filament macroscopically , as it were composed of coherent chain links fired away from an orifice .",
    "this assumption is discussed in section  [ sec : zero_gravity ] together with the consequences of relaxing it .",
    "finally , the paper is closed by section  [ sec : conclusion ] , where we collect the theoretical conclusions reached here and comment about the want for their experimental scrutiny .",
    "in this section we recall the theory presented in @xcite adapting it to the special problem envisaged here .",
    "think of a slime filament as an _ inextensible _ string with uniform mass density @xmath11 per unit length , parameterized in the reference configuration by the arc - length @xmath12 .",
    "the position in space occupied by a material point of the filament is represented by the mapping @xmath13 .",
    "here @xmath12 , which designates the convected variable , could as well be used to designate the arc - length in the present configuration .",
    "correspondingly , the velocity @xmath14 is defined by @xmath15 , where a superimposed dot represents differentiation with respect to time @xmath16 .",
    "similarly , @xmath17 is the acceleration .",
    "let @xmath18 denote the _ external _ force acting per unit length of the filament and @xmath19 the internal tension that arises as a reaction to the inextensibility constraint .",
    "the balance of linear momentum along any smooth arc of the filament is expressed by @xmath20 where a prime @xmath21 denotes differentiation with respect to @xmath12 ( see , for example , ( * ? ? ? * section34 ) ) .",
    "equation is written for an observer gliding at uniform speed along with the bacterium .",
    "though the bacterium gliding motion on the substrate will be assumed to have uniform speed as a result of neglecting its inertia , in describing the filament s motion , with the objective of determining the bacterium thrust , we shall neither neglect the filament s inertia nor the gravity ( which we regard somehow on the same footing ) ; we defer the reader to section  [ sec : zero_gravity ] for a quantitative discussion of this assumption .      in this context",
    ", a _ shock _ propagating along the filament is described by a function , @xmath22 , identifying the point in the reference configuration carrying a discontinuity in speed .",
    "specifically , we assume that @xmath23 is continuous at @xmath24 , because the ejected filament breaks nowhere , but @xmath14 is discontinuous .",
    "similarly , both the unit tangent @xmath25 , the principal unit normal @xmath26 , and the curvature @xmath27 of the curve representing the present shape ( at time @xmath16 ) of the filament are discontinuous at @xmath28 , as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : shock ] .     of the filament .",
    "the points @xmath29 and @xmath30 , with @xmath31 , delimit the arc under consideration .",
    "the point @xmath32 is a singular point , where the unit tangent @xmath25 is discontinuous , with traces @xmath33 and @xmath34 on the two sides . ]",
    "we shall call @xmath32 a _ singular point_. we denote by @xmath33 and @xmath34 the two limiting values of @xmath25 across a singular point . here and below ,",
    "for any quantity @xmath35 , superscripts @xmath36 refer to the traces of @xmath35 across @xmath32 from the sides of increasing and decreasing @xmath12 , respectively .",
    "also , we shall employ the customary notation @xmath37 , for the _ jump _ of @xmath35 across a singular point .",
    "the shock speed is @xmath38 relative to both the reference and present shapes ( as a consequence of the filament s inextensibility ) .",
    "a kinematic compatibility condition arises for the jump of @xmath14 , as a result of the requirement that the velocity of the geometric point which instantaneously coincides in space with a singular point can be expressed in two different , but equivalent ways ( see , for example , @xcite ) : @xmath39 the balance of linear momentum for an arbitrary small arc enclosing a singular point ( that is , for @xmath40 and @xmath41 in fig .",
    "[ fig : shock ] ) , requires that @xmath42 where @xmath43 is the concentrated supply of momentum that must be provided at a singular point to sustain the shock . in a similar way ( see again @xcite for more details ) , the energy balance at a singular point results into the following equation , @xmath44 where @xmath45 is the concentrated power supply involved in the shock .",
    "of @xcite ; what here is denoted @xmath45 was there denoted @xmath46 . for @xmath47 , energy is lost in the shock . according to the treatment of _ chains _ in sommerfeld s book @xcite ( see ,",
    "pp.2829 and problem i.7 , pp.241 , 257 ) , the energy loss in chain dynamics is a concept first introduced by lazare carnot , the father of sadi ( this latter known for his contributions to the theory of heat ) , who was a writer on mathematics and mechanics ( besides later becoming one of the most loyal of napoleon s generals ) .",
    "see also @xcite , @xcite and @xcite . ] for a dissipative shock , @xmath45 is negative and measures the energy lost per unit time by the internal frictions that hamper the shock as it goes by .",
    "while in our setting the force @xmath43 will be provided through the contact of the slime filament with the external world , @xmath45 is of a constitutive nature , which needs to be further specified ( see section  [ sec : shock_dissipation ] ) .",
    "equations and express only the mechanical balances at a singular point .",
    "the former is also known as the _ rankine - hugoniot _ jump condition for one - dimensional continua @xcite .",
    "interesting versions of the jump conditions in , , and above occur when the material constituting the filament is amorphously quiescent on one side of the shock . in this context ,",
    "for definiteness , we shall refer to such a shock as _",
    "external _ , while the shock described so far will be referred to as _ internal_. an external shock is an attempt at formalizing the notion of _ continually _ imparted impacts introduced in the work of cayley  @xcite ; as such , it is more than just an internal shock with vanishing velocity on one side . at an external shock ,",
    "mass is not conserved , as the filament is there in contact with a slime reservoir , where a shapeless deposit of matter serves as a supply of mass abruptly injected into the moving filament .",
    "more generally , the moving system receives from the external reservoir supplies of mass , linear momentum , and energy , which enter the corresponding balance laws .",
    "this concept will inspire our mathematical treatment of the extrusion process that takes place at the bacterium pore whence the slime filament is extruded .    assuming that at the pore , where mass is instantaneously ejected with velocity @xmath14 along the direction @xmath48 , a shock is propagating with speed @xmath38 , the same kinematic condition that led us to now requires that    [ eq : jump_external_plus ] @xmath49 similarly , by applying the balance laws of linear momentum and energy to an arbitrarily small arc of the ejected filament near the pore , we obtain @xmath50 @xmath51    where we have denoted by @xmath52 the filament s tension at the pore , and @xmath53 and @xmath54 are the appropriate supplies . combining , , and",
    ", we see that @xmath55    equation , in particular , allows us to interpret @xmath53 as the _ continuous - impact _ force envisaged by cayley @xcite to describe mechanical systems in which particles of infinitesimal mass are continuously taken into `` connexion '' .",
    "an external shock is propagating backwards relative to the filament at the same scalar velocity as the material in the filament , so that the shock results steady in space .",
    "the complementary expressions for @xmath54 give the energy lost ( or gained ) by the filament in being set in motion instantaneously .",
    "when the shock is internal , that is , the singular point is both followed and preceded by mass in motion , the shock dissipation @xmath45 should depend only on the impact mechanism responsible for the abrupt change in velocity .",
    "as in @xcite , to posit a constitutive law for @xmath45 , we seek inspiration in the laws of impact which were already introduced in 1668 by wallis and wren  @xcite , as recounted , for example in whittaker s treatise @xcite .",
    "when in a system of mass - points all impacts happen to be characterized by the same restitution coefficient @xmath56 , the kinetic energy after a single impact decreases by @xmath57 times the kinetic energy of the _ lost _ motion , the motion that would have been composed with the motion before the impact to reproduce the motion after the impact @xcite . by applying this law to the elementary transfer of mass through the shock suffered by a filament , interpreted as an internal impact , we justify setting @xmath58 where @xmath59 will be treated as a phenomenological parameter .",
    ", we note that for a _ plastic _",
    "impact , @xmath60 and @xmath61 , whereas , for a _ perfectly elastic _ impact , @xmath62 and @xmath63 .",
    "however , in the absence of a microscopic mechanism illuminating the origin of @xmath45 , these correspondences are purely formal and @xmath64 remains a constitutive parameter of the filament .",
    "] in the ideal limit where @xmath65 , the shock is not dissipative . on the other hand , for @xmath61 ,",
    "the shock is maximally dissipative . in practice , for a slime filament @xmath64 should depend on the material that constitutes it .",
    "could equally well be regarded as an external energy sink , instead of the energy lost in an internal impact .",
    "this interpretation could indeed provide a better justification in the present context for the explicit law posited in , as the impact model recalled in the text , if appropriate for chain links , may be a bit too strained for a slime filament . ]      before solving the balance equations for an ejected slime filament , we need to specify , albeit in an idealized fashion , the mechanisms at work at both pore and foot .",
    "figure  [ fig : sketch ] illustrates the view taken here .",

    "this shows already that , however we shall determine @xmath52 , the resulting thrust on the bacterium provided by an unbroken slime filament partially adhered to a rigid substrate will be less than that provided by pure jet propulsion . letting @xmath68 and combining , , and , we arrive at @xmath120 where @xmath94 is yet to be determined .",
    "now we resolve the two shocks shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : sketch ] by applying equations through to @xmath67 and to @xmath66 . in the bacterium rest frame",
    "the slime filament is seen to approach the substrate with velocity @xmath121 before adhesion and to glide on the substrate with velocity @xmath122 after adhesion ; here the unit vectors @xmath123 are as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : arc_and_jumps](c ) , @xmath74 is the ejecting velocity , and @xmath124 is the gliding velocity .    by , we immediately conclude that @xmath125 and @xmath126 .",
    "thus , kinematic compatibility requires that in a steady motion that preserves the filament s shape the bacterium gliding velocity @xmath124 ( relative to the substrate ) must coincide with the slime ejecting velocity @xmath74 ( relative to the bacterium ) .",
    "thus , is turned into an equation for the admissible ejecting velocity : @xmath127 which depends on the filament s shape through the unknown constant @xmath94 .    at @xmath67 , equation can now be enforced in the form @xmath128 in a similar way , with the aid of , at @xmath67 becomes @xmath129 it is expedient recording here that , in accord with , the explicit expressions for the unit vectors @xmath130 featuring in and are @xmath131    while equation determines the momentum supply @xmath72 , the jump condition ties @xmath94 to @xmath106 via .",
    "overall , there are four unknowns that need to be determined to identify completely the steady solution we seek here , namely , @xmath106 , @xmath74 , @xmath94 , and @xmath132 , where the latter designates the tension in the adhered filament , just after its foot @xmath67 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : sketch ] ) .",
    "the bacterium equation of motion and the shock kinematic compatibility condition combined in together with the jump condition provide only two equations : two others are missing .",
    "one missing equation comes from the geometric condition @xmath133 which prescribes the total downfall of the filament ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : sketch ] ) .",
    "the other is the boundary condition that must be required at the filament s foot @xmath67 to reflect the contact mechanism with the substrate envisaged in the model . here , to the purpose of showing that theoretically gliding is also possible on smooth substrates",
    ", we shall assume that the reactive supply of linear momentum @xmath72 can only be directed vertically upwards , @xmath134 , with @xmath135 .",
    "thus , the second missing equation will be @xmath136    there are two compatibility conditions that a solution must meet to be acceptable : both concern the positivity of the tension @xmath97 .",
    "one is , which amounts to require that @xmath137 , and the other is @xmath138    to expedite the search for solutions and to retrace more easily in them signs of universality , it is advisable to scale all lengths to @xmath69 and all velocities to @xmath139 which represents a velocity characteristic of both the environment opposing the bacterium gliding and the material constituting the extruded slime . thus , @xmath74 will be replaced by @xmath140    by and , we readily rewrite as @xmath141 by which reduces to @xmath142 by inserting into , we obtain the following expression for @xmath143 , @xmath144 where @xmath145 which represents the velocity acquired by any body falling from rest over the distance @xmath69 scaled to @xmath146 , combines in a dimensionless parameter both @xmath69 and @xmath146 .",
    "similarly , using both and , we easily see that amounts to @xmath147 which makes automatically satisfied since @xmath59 .",
    "making use of in , we finally determine @xmath148 as    [ eq : addition_14 ] @xmath149 in terms of which we express all other unknowns : @xmath150 @xmath151 @xmath152    equation , combined with , shows in particular that @xmath132 satisfies the inequality .",
    "similarly , it follows from that @xmath153 .",
    "we record here for later use that by the thrust in can also be expressed as @xmath154      this is an active system , and so the energy dissipated in the gliding process must come from the bacterium itself .",
    "the theory developed here identifies with @xmath54 the rate at which such an active energy is produced to sustain the bacterium locomotion . in the bacterium rest frame , where the kinetic energy of the slime filament extruded between pore and foot",
    "is constant in time , balance of energy requires that @xmath155 where @xmath156 is the extra kinetic energy associated with the sliding motion of the filament on the substrate . in , @xmath54 is the power supply at the bacterium pore , given by , @xmath45 is the concentrated power supply involved in the dissipative internal shock at the filament s foot , given by , @xmath157 is the power expended by the gravitational forces , and @xmath158 is the power expended by the free end of the adhered filament ( seen gliding with velocity @xmath74 in the bacterium rest frame ) .",
    "all these powers can be computed explicitly . to this end",
    "we found it expedient to scale them to @xmath159 .    by combining with and replacing with @xmath160 by use of both and",
    ", we obtain @xmath161 directly from , we have @xmath162 moreover , it is easily seen ( for example , in @xcite ) that @xmath163 , which by and becomes @xmath164 likewise , by and , we can write @xmath165 inserting equations through into , we readily arrive at @xmath166 which is indeed justifiable by a direct computation . considering the ever extending string of slime on the substrate , which moves at the speed @xmath74",
    ", we see that at time @xmath16 later it is carrying the extra kinetic energy @xmath167 on account of being longer . by differentiating @xmath156 in time ,",
    "we recover immediately .    in the following subsection",
    "we shall explore some quantitative aspects of this solution in the simpler case where @xmath168 and @xmath64 and @xmath169 remain the only free parameters .      to illustrate the solution in , here we set @xmath168 ; the situation we envisage is sketched in fig .",
    "[ fig : sketch_horizontal ] , where @xmath170 denotes the distance between the filament s foot @xmath67 and the projection onto the substrate of the ejecting pore @xmath66 .",
    ", @xmath61 , @xmath171 ; the distance @xmath170 scaled to @xmath69 is @xmath172 . ]",
    "the plots of @xmath173 , @xmath106 , @xmath132 , and @xmath174 as functions of @xmath169 are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : tableau ] for three indicative values of @xmath64 , namely , @xmath175 , @xmath176 , and @xmath177 .",
    "+    it should be noted that by , for @xmath168 , @xmath173 also represents the thrust on the bacterium expressed in terms of @xmath178 .",
    "all the graphs in fig .",
    "[ fig : tableau ] describe increasing functions of @xmath169 . moreover , for a given @xmath169 , increasing @xmath64 results in a decrease of @xmath173 , @xmath132 , and @xmath174 , and in an increase of @xmath106 .",
    "thus , for a less dissipative shock , all the forces increase and so does also the gliding velocity , while the slime filament becomes steeper in approaching its foot .",
    "the inverted catenary solution described in section  [ sec : catenary ] is characterized by gravity .",
    "one may sensibly argue that gravity is to play no role at the small length scales characteristic of bacteria .",
    "to put this objection into a quantitative perspective , we consider here what survives of our analysis in the limit as the dimensionless parameter @xmath169 introduced in tends to zero ; we interpret this to be either the zero gravity limit or the zero thickness limit , in view of the way both @xmath90 and @xmath69 feature in . by use of",
    ", it is a simple matter to show that for @xmath179 @xmath173 , @xmath106 , @xmath132 , and @xmath174 are respectively delivered by    [ eq : zero_gravity_limit ] @xmath180",
    "@xmath181 @xmath182 @xmath183    correspondingly , by , , and , for any @xmath169 the function @xmath184 that describes the inverted catenary can be recast in the form @xmath185 since by @xmath106 tends to @xmath96 as @xmath169 tends to @xmath186 , shows that in that limit the inverted catenary solution makes no sense , and so the filament s shape remains undetermined ( as was perhaps to be expected ) .",
    "nevertheless , all formulas remain perfectly valid and carry a definite mechanical meaning , which is presumably best appropriate at bacterial length scales .",
    "we have proposed a mathematical model to describe the mechanics of gliding , a means utilized by some bacteria to move on a rigid substrate . the theory attempted to prove the propelling ability of the slime filaments extruded by some cells , such as myxobacteria and cyanobacteria , which are known to adopt gliding as a locomotion mechanism .",
    "seen in the bacterium rest frame , an extruded slime filament was treated as a flexible , inextensible string with uniform linear mass density , flowing along its own shape and meeting the substrate at a kink , which we called the _ foot _ , where a dissipative internal shock travels backwards in the string reference configuration to remain still relative to the moving bacterium .",
    "the extruding pore was instead treated as an external shock , as there new mass is continuously supplied to the moving filament together with linear momentum and energy .",
    "this distinction between internal and external shocks is taken from @xcite ; the mathematical formalism put forward there was also recalled here to make this paper self - contained and adapted to an ideal bacterium gliding over a flat , rigid substrate .",
    "we proved that the kinetic compatibility condition for shock propagation requires the gliding velocity ( in the substrate rest frame ) to equal the extrusion velocity ( in the bacterium rest frame ) , a result that seems to be supported by some experimental evidence @xcite .",
    "essentially , this is a consequence of our assumption on the filament s inextensibility , in favour of which we were not able to produce any direct experimental validation .",
    "perhaps , we may consider the observed coincidence between gliding and extruding velocities as an indirect one .",
    "we also determined completely the bacterium gliding motion by solving explicitly a non - linear mathematical problem .",
    "we obtained both the velocity compatible with the assumption of uniform gliding and the propelling thrust on the bacterium in terms of a few parameters .",
    "though not numerous , these latter are not directly accessible , so that we failed to propose any reliable estimate of the mechanical quantities involved in the bacterium motion . in our analysis , gravity was not neglected , whereas both viscous forces on the extruded filament and its bending rigidity were . as for the first assumption , which might be considered inappropriate at the typical length scales of bacteria , we proved that in the zero gravity limit only the specific inverted catenary structure of the solution does not survive ( as was perhaps to be expected ) , whereas all the mechanical quantities we were interested in have a definite limit , so that gravity appears here as an analytic regularizing device which just makes the filament s shape definite .",
    "as for the other two assumptions , i simply plead guilty of having no better justification than the simplicity they afford to the analysis .    at this stage , ours remains just a viable mathematical hypothesis on the role of slime extrusion in bacteria gliding .",
    "we were contented with proving theoretically that continuously extruded slime filaments exert a thrust on the bacterium through their footing on the substrate , for which we can afford a precise quantitative description .",
    "whether this would contribute to clarify the mystery of bacteria gliding still remains to be seen .",
    "i wish to thank both anonymous referees , whose remarks and suggestions helped me putting my work in a better perspective .",
    "i am , in particular , indebted to one of them for having prompted me to write section  [ sec : zero_gravity ] about the zero gravity limit and for correcting a shortcoming in a previous version of section  [ sec : energy_balance ] ; the lines following are essentially taken from his ( or her ) report .",
