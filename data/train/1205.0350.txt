    "the interaction is generally significant , nonlinear , and irreversible .",
    "the resultant complex travelling structures , sampled later at high temporal resolution by _ in situ _ instrumentation at 1 au , are identified as magnetic cloud boundary layers @xcite , cme - cir events @xcite , cme - shock events @xcite , cme - cme events @xcite , and so on .",
    "interplanetary cmes have been widely recognized as the primary driver of interplanetary disturbances and large geomagnetic storms ( _ e.g. _ , ; ; ; ) .",

    "the scattered light retains the same spectral characteristics as the incident sunlight on the basis of thomson - scattering theory @xcite .",
    "the effects of multiple scattering are negligible , because the solar wind is optically thin .",
    "the angle between the sun and a target , such as a cme , as viewed from an observer , is termed elongation @xmath2 . the brightness difference between the sun and a target (",

    "more specifically , large cmes at @xmath3 have optical intensities that are of order @xmath4 @xcite , where @xmath5 , the solar brightness unit , is the intensity of the sun as a power per unit area ( of the photosphere ) per unit solid angle . to map interplanetary structures at large elongations ,",

    "so by successfully subtracting the background brightness , an optical sky map taken by an hi easily reveals interplanetary transients irradiated by direct sunlight ( _ e.g. _ , ) . proposed an image processing procedure consisting of five major steps : stationary background removal , celestial background removal ( including cross - image distortion measurement ) , residual f corona removal , moving feature filtration in the fourier plane , and conversion back to focal plane coordinates . using this procedure",
    ", the solar wind at 1 au can be imaged with a sensitivity of a few @xmath6 , compared to a background signal of a few @xmath7 .",
    "instrument specifications for an hi require careful design that incorporates the stray - light impacts of the hi bus , hi appendages , and other instruments onboard the spacecraft @xcite .",

    "the leading - edge pileup of solar wind material is observed as a bright arc in optical imaging and revealed as a shock sheath from _ in situ _ sampling . with the launch of the _ stereo _ mission",

    "his are planned as part of the payload on a number of future missions , including the _ solar orbiter _ and the _ solar probe plus_.    white - light images from his are more difficult to interpret than those from coronagraphs .",
    "cmes imaged by the _",

    "in such a j - map , the signatures of faint propagating transients are highlighted , and the transient can be tracked .",
    "however , the interpretation of the leading edge of the transient track in a j - map can be quite controversial . by fitting its time - elongation profile extracted from the j - map created from single - spacecraft observations @xcite , the radial velocity and direction of a cme",
    "can be estimated , assuming that the cme moves radially at a constant velocity .",
    "such a fit can be performed independently for the two _ stereo _ spacecraft , if the cme is observed by both .",
    "moreover , if it is observed by both spacecraft , the cme s position ( and hence its velocity ) and its propagation direction can be inferred as a function of time throughout its observation by direct triangulation @xcite or a  tangent to a sphere \" method @xcite .",
    "the determination of cme kinematics , in particular the propagation direction , can be ambiguous .",
    "the assumptions that one is always observing the same part of a cme can lead to large errors in the estimated height of the cme s leading edge . the structure of a cme affects the derivation of its kinematic properties , particularly at large elongations . as a cme propagates to increasingly large elongations , the location of its leading edge changes . as stated by , the interpretation of observations of the leading edge of a cme can be fraught with difficulties , especially at large elongations . scattered sunlight in the inner heliosphere is not only determined by the local electron density , but also by thomson - scattering theory .",
    "the thomson - scattering geometry is defined by a sphere , on which the sun and the observer are located on opposite ends of the diameter . the classical theory of thomson - scattering , by , was revisited by . concluded that : ( 1 ) the result of the scattering efficiency contribution is to somewhat de - emphasize the importance of the thomson - scattering surface ; ( 2 ) the observed intensity is distributed out to large distances from the thomson - scattering surface ; ( 3 ) such a spread of observed intensity is more significant at larger elongations .",
    "a cme can , therefore , be readily imaged at large elongations . using smei observations ,",
    "demonstrated that limb cmes could be detected out to at least 0.5 au .",
    "furthermore , showed that cmes could be phenomenologically modelled as a modified bubble or shell structure .",
    "however , inferring the three - dimensional location of a cme becomes more difficult with increasing elongation . in optical imaging ,",
    "the observed intensity is traditionally assumed to come from a so - called plane - of - sky ( pos ) .",
    "the pos is defined as the plane containing the sun and being perpendicular to the line - of - sight ( los ) from an observer .",
    "while such a simple assumption is reasonable for coronagraph imaging , it is invalid for heliospheric imaging @xcite .",
    "an inappropriate application of the pos assumption to heliospheric imaging would result in a significant underestimation of cme mass .",
    "a cme is inherently three - dimensional in nature , and imaging observations only provide two - dimensional information as a result of los integration through the three - dimensional structure .",
    "effects of the projection and the thomson - scattering are likely to affect brightness tracks in time - elongation maps .",
    "uncertainties resulting from such effects can be assessed and disentangled quantitatively using a magnetohydrodynamic ( mhd ) modelling as a digital laboratory .",
    "for instance , cmes on 24  25 january 2007 were modelled , and synthetic optical images compared in detail with observations from the _",
    "stereo_/_his _ , by .",
    "moreover , by forward modelling of a travelling shock , demonstrated that remote - sensing signatures in coordinated white light and interplanetary scintillation ( ips ) observations can be theoretically simulated .",
    "numerical models are useful in interpreting the brightness patterns of cmes tracked in optical sky maps , and hence aiding our understanding of heliospheric processes such as the propagation , evolution , and possible interactions of cmes .    in this paper , we simulate a shock propagating through the inner heliosphere using an mhd model .",
    "subsequently , we synthesize and investigate the corresponding white light images that would be observed from 1 au .",
    "we present the numerical mhd model and the optical thomson - scattering formulation in section [ sec : method ] . in section [ sec : los ] , we describe tracking of the shock front from different perspectives , and present profiles of the scattered sunlight intensity along various loss .",
    "subsequently , we analyze the brightness patterns observed in synthetic time - elongation maps and longitude - elongation maps ( section [ sec : pattern ] ) .",
    "finally , we discuss remote sensing of much more complex interplanetary phenomena in both white light and radio in section [ sec : summary ] .",
    "a numerical model of the heliosphere @xcite is used to associate interplanetary dynamics with corresponding observed signatures .",
    "such a self - consistent link is summarized in the flow chart for synthetic remote - sensing in white light and radio shown in figure 8 from . here",
    ", we investigate only white - light imaging for a travelling fast shock .",
    "the procedure consists of two steps , described in sections [ sec - sub : mhd ] and [ sec - sub : ts ] .",
    "large - scale dynamics of the inner heliosphere can be physically described by mhd processes . using a sophisticated numerical mhd model @xcite , a blast shock wave travelling through interplanetary space is numerically simulated in this paper .",
    "we describe our model in table [ tab : model ] , establish the background solar wind in table [ tab : bg ] , and prescribe the shock injection in table [ tab : shock ] .",

    "white - light imaging is performed on the basis of the well - established thomson - scattering theory .",

    "the propagating shock , as observed from a fixed longitude , is manifested as an inclined streak in a time - elongation map ( figure [ time ] ) .",
    "the slope of this feature is steepest for @xmath66 ( figure [ time ] ) , as its arrival time at @xmath123 is 35 hours at @xmath66 compared with 50 hours at @xmath124 and 90 hours at @xmath125 .",
    "the most intense optical signatures of the shock are those observed from @xmath126 at a time of 12 hours ( figure [ longitude]a ) and from @xmath127 at 25 hours ( figure [ longitude]b ) . from these vantage points ,",
    "the brightness patterns corresponding to the shock cover the widest elongation extent and exhibit the largest relative brightness enhancement due to the close proximity of the shock nose to the thomson - scattering surface at these times ( see , for example , l4 in figure [ contour]c ) .",
    "when the shock front crosses 1 au , the optical brightness is enhanced over the entire range of elongations @xmath128 , simultaneously .",
    "such a crossing occurs at around @xmath129 hours for an observer at @xmath66 ( figures [ longitude]c and [ time]a ) , and near @xmath130 hours for an observer at @xmath124 ( figure [ time]b ) .",
    "the brightness enhancement , which results from backward scattering of sunlight , lasts for between 15 and 20 hours ( figures [ time]a - b ) .",
    "these figures demonstrate how easily an interplanetary shock , with its wide front , can be optically imaged .",
    "polarization measurements of scattered sunlight are very useful in locating the three - dimensional position of a volume of dense plasma . viewed along any elongation ,",
    "the polarized intensities ( @xmath75 , @xmath58 , @xmath65 ) are an los integral of the local electron density , weighted by thomson - scattering geometry factors .",
    "the thomson - scattering factors are different for the different polarized components , _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath83 for a radial component @xmath70 and @xmath74 for a tangent component @xmath71 in equation ( [ equ : los ] ) .",
    "near the thomson - scattering surface ( where @xmath78 ) , @xmath131 is much larger than @xmath83 ( figures [ los - a]c , [ los - a]i , [ los - a]o , [ los - b]c , [ los - b]i , and [ los - b]o ) , and the locally scattered sunlight is nearly linearly polarized .",
    "when the heliospheric electron density @xmath50 is in equilibrium , the distribution of @xmath50 depends only on heliocentric distance @xmath41 , according to the expression @xmath106 , and the integrated scattered sunlight along elongation @xmath132 has the largest polarization , with a value of almost 0.8 ( figure [ calibration]h ) .",
    "an observer viewing sunlight scattered by a dense parcel of plasma will detect an increase in @xmath75 , an increase in @xmath65 , a decrease in @xmath58 , and an increase in polarization @xmath60 as the parcel of plasma approaches the thomson - scattering surface .",
    "polarization measurements for the shock studied in this paper are presented as longitude - elongation maps in figure [ longitude ] and as time - elongation maps in figure [ time ] .",
    "loss l2 , l4 , l5 , and l7 ( in figure [ contour ] ) have polarizations of 0.68 , 0.8 , 0.81 , 0.7 , respectively .",
    "obviously , when the shock nose lies on the thomson - scattering surface itself , the polarization of scattered sunlight is significantly enhanced . in the longitude - elongation ( @xmath115 )",
    "maps shown in figures [ longitude]j - l , two localized and symmetrical patches of enhanced polarization are evident . at an elapsed time of 25 hours ,",
    "one of these patches lies within the region defined by @xmath133 and @xmath134 ( figure [ longitude]k ) . inferring the three - dimensional location of an interplanetary cme at large elongations using a total intensity measurement",
    "is fraught with uncertainties @xcite , which could be significantly reduced through the use of additional polarization measurements . locating",
    "a cme using measurements of polarization would require the theoretical calculation of the thomson - scattering geometry factors within the cme volume .",
    "however , once the inherent effects of thomson - scattering are removed , the total optical intensity can be used to reliably estimate the mass of the cme .",
    "a full sky imager observing polarized light would not only be capable of monitoring the inner heliosphere , but would also enable the three dimensional location of interplanetary disturbances to be established .",
    "the characteristic signature of a large - scale interplanetary transient in a brightness sky map is a bright arc , followed by a dark void .",
    "the bright arc corresponds to an interplanetary shock .",
    "such a shock can be further classified either as a blast shock or a piston - driven shock .",
    "a blast shock is generated in response to an impulsive release of energy in the low corona such as a solar flare ; a piston - driven shock is usually formed ahead of a fast cme .",
    "coronagraph observations of loop - like transients are inconsistent with theoretical models of a blast shock wave @xcite . here",
    ", we consider only the white - light signatures of the interplanetary shock ; the exact nature of the shock is not of relevance . in practice , features in a brightness sky map need to be detectable in absolute intensity and exhibit a sharp gradient along their boundary . satisfying the criteria of detectability",
    "indicates that an interplanetary disturbance should be relatively close to the thomson - scattering sphere , _ i.e. _ , usually within @xmath89 ( figures [ cartoon]c - e ) .",
    "however , the shock studied in this paper is very strong , described by initial parameters given in table [ tab : shock ] .",
    "if the shock was much weaker , the angular extent of its front would be less .",
    "in the case of a weak shock , for an observer at @xmath66 , the shock front would lie well inside the thomson - scattering sphere and would be completely invisible before arriving at 1 au .",
    "a bright arc observed by an optical imaging device may correspond to the shock forerunning a cme . during their propagation , cmes continuously change their position relative to the thomson - scattering surface of a corresponding observer .",
    "therefore , the white light signature of a travelling cme will evolve continuously .",
    "in this paper , we present the results of a forward modelling study of an incident shock in the inner heliosphere . through combining a numerical mhd model @xcite and thomson - scattering theory @xcite ,",
    "we are able to investigate the causal link between interplanetary dynamics and observable signatures . by synthesizing white - light observations",
    ", we confirm the significant role played by the thomson - scattering geometry in determining the brightness of sky maps at large elongations .",
    "furthermore , we suggest the use of interplanetary polarization measurements to help locate interplanetary cmes ; no such interplanetary observations are currently made .",
    "in contrast , the _ stereo_/_cor _ and _ lasco _ coronagraphs do have polarizers , and have been used successfully to investigate cme orientations , close to the sun , using a polarimetric reconstruction technique ( _ e.g. _ , ) . as demonstrated by the proof - of - concept study presented here , however , interplanetary polarization measurements made possible by future technological advances would be of significant benefit in the study of interplanetary transients such as cmes .",
    "optical brightness maps contain imprints of various large - scale interplanetary processes .",
    "these processes are usually much more complex than a simple case of a travelling shock , as studied in this paper .",
    "the use of numerical models is crucial in uncovering the physics that underlies white - light observations , such that optical imaging technology can be exploited to its fullest . to our knowledge , we list some examples below :    1 .",
    "interplanetary coupling of multiple cmes / shocks .",
    "+ successive cmes can interact with each other during their propagation , and form compound ejecta within 1 au .",
    "a high - speed cme can drive a fast shock ahead of itself , which is wide in angular extent than the cme body itself .",
    "so cme - shock interaction is much more likely than cme - cme coupling .",
    "both cme - shock interaction @xcite and cme - cme coupling @xcite were theoretically simulated in terms of interplanetary dynamics and ensuing geoeffectiveness ; these theoretical modelling results are observationally confirmed by a recent work based on _",
    "stereo_/_hi _ imaging of the interaction of multiple interplanetary cmes @xcite .",
    "the most compelling evidence for cme - cme interaction in an optical sky map is the formation of an intensely bright arc as the cme - driven shocks completely merge .",
    "this bright arc corresponds to the merged shock front , a region in which the plasma is greatly compressed .",
    "photospheric data can be used as a driver for numerical mhd models of the inner heliosphere , to enable realistic simulations of multiple cmes to be performed . following the same method as used in this paper ,",
    "optical sky maps can be synthesized and then compared with observed sky maps .",
    "such a comparison helps validate the numerical mhd modelling .",
    "the use of validated numerical modelling enables individual cmes and interaction regions to be identified within the complex brightness patterns that can be present in optical sky maps .",
    "interplanetary coupling of a cir with cmes / blobs .",
    "+ cirs are periodic spiral - like structures formed in the inner heliosphere as a result of compression at the interface between fast and slow streams .",
    "cirs form where the fast solar wind is emitted from the rotating sun , behind the slow solar wind , along the same solar radial . like cmes ,",
    "although smaller in scale , plasma blobs contribute to the more transient nature of the inner heliosphere .",
    "coronagraph observations show that plasma blobs are intermittently released from the cusps of coronal helmet streamers , and propagate at the typical slow solar wind speed @xcite .",
    "a cir can sweep up slow blobs in front , or can impede the propagation of a following fast cme ; such blobs and/or cmes are entrained by the cir .",
    "plasma blobs that become entrained within the cir undergo strong compression such that they are highly visible in optical sky maps .",
    "blobs entrained at the stream interface can be identified as recurring patterns of inclined streaks in time - elongation maps . in the case of cir - cme interaction , a cir",
    "could be warped by the entrained cme .",
    "cir - cme interaction is generally much more disruptive than interaction between cirs and blobs .",
    "optical observations of blobs that have become entrained at the stream interface have been presented by and .",
    "cirs are inferred to have the spatial morphology of a garden - hose density spiral , based on their signatures in time - elongation maps .",
    "interplanetary interaction between cirs and cmes / blobs can result in complex brightness patterns in optical sky maps .",
    "the observed brightness is dictated by multiple factors such as the thomson - scattering geometry , the alignment of the spiral cir along the loss , and local compression within interacting sites .",
    "numerical models can aid our understanding of these cir - related phenomena .",
    "coordinated observations from multiple optical and radio telescopes .",
    "+ simultaneous heliospheric imaging from multiple vantage points was successfully realized with the launch of the twin _ stereo _ spacecraft . with stereoscopic imaging ,",
    "multiple viewing ray - paths from one observer intersect with those from the other observer .",
    "thus the three - dimensional distribution of electrons in the inner heliosphere can be reconstructed using a time - dependent tomography algorithm ( c.f . , ; ) . at times ,",
    "several ips ray - paths lie within the imaging fov such that cmes can be simultaneously observed in ips and white light @xcite .",
    "the ips technique can be used to estimate the location and speed of micro - scale electron density irregularities @xcite .",
    "if such irregularities exist within a cme and some assumptions are made about the cme kinematics , the ips signals can be used to predict the appearance of the cme in later optical sky maps @xcite . it should be noted that newly constructed low - frequency radio interferometers such as the low frequency array ( lofar ) @xcite and the murchison widefield array ( mwa ) @xcite are proving a major milestone in ips technology . coordinated remote sensing observations in the optical and radio regimes enable the inner heliosphere to be mapped in fine detail ;",
    "numerical models can guide such endeavors by suggesting synthesized results beforehand ( _ e.g. _ , ) .    in closing , white - light imaging is a mainstream technology for remotely sensing the inner heliosphere .",
    "however , owing to inherent geometry effects of thomson - scattering , deriving the kinematic properties of interplanetary transients from optical sky maps is ambiguous at large elongations .",
    "the ambiguities arising due to the thomson - scattering geometry can be rigorously constrained , if optical imaging is complemented by other observational techniques , such as radio imaging and _ in situ _ sampling , and/or by numerical modelling .",
    "more theoretical modelling will be done as a natural extension to the preliminary results presented in this paper .",
