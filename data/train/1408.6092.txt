    "schematic sketch of a quantum - dot spin valve .",
    "a single - level quantum dot ( blue ) with excitation energies @xmath0 and @xmath1 is tunnel coupled with coupling strength @xmath2 to two ferromagnetic electrodes ( yellow ) with noncollinear magnetizations pointing along @xmath3 and enclosing an angle @xmath4 . ]",
    "we consider a single - level quantum dot coupled to two ferromagnetic electrodes @xmath5 with magnetizations pointing in arbitrary directions @xmath3 .",
    "the hamiltonian of the system can be written as @xmath6 here , @xmath7 represents the two ferromagnetic electrodes in terms of a simple stoner model as noninteracting electrons with a constant but spin - dependent density of states @xmath8 .",
    "for each electrode , we choose the spin quantization axis along the magnetization of the respective lead such that @xmath9 refers to the majority ( minority ) spin electrons .",
    "the spin dependence of @xmath8 can be conveniently parametrized in terms of the polarization @xmath10 where @xmath11 refers to a normal metal and @xmath12 to a half - metallic ferromagnet . in the following",
    ", we will assume both leads to have the same polarization , @xmath13 .",
    "the quantum dot is described in terms of a single spin - degenerate level with gate - tunable energy @xmath0 as @xmath14 here , @xmath15 denotes the coulomb energy of the dot that is needed in order to occupy the quantum dot with two electrons at the same time . for later convenience",
    ", we quantize the dot spin along the direction @xmath16 perpendicular to the lead magnetizations .    for the chosen quantization axes , the tunnel hamiltonian takes the form @xmath17+\\text{h.c .",
    "} , \\end{split}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] i.e. , it couples majority and minority spin electrons of the lead to both , spin up and spin down electrons on the dot . in eq .",
    ", @xmath18 denotes the angle between @xmath3 and @xmath19 .",
    "the tunnel matrix elements @xmath20 are related to the spin - dependent tunnel coupling strengths via @xmath21 with @xmath22 .",
    "we furthermore introduce the total tunnel coupling @xmath23 .",
    "in order to describe transport through our system , we employ a real - time diagrammatic technique  @xcite in its extension to systems with ferromagnetic leads .",
    "@xcite the central idea of this approach is to split the system into the strongly interacting quantum dot with a few degrees of freedom and the noninteracting electrodes with many degrees of freedom .",
    "the latter are integrated out to obtain a description of the quantum dot in terms of its reduced density matrix @xmath24 with density matrix elements @xmath25 .",
    "the time evolution of the reduced density matrix is given by a generalized master equation of the form @xmath26 .",
    "here , @xmath27 is a vector containing the various density matrix elements of @xmath24 .",
    "@xmath28 is a matrix of generalized transition rates that are given by irreducible self - energies of the quantum - dot propagator on the keldysh contour .",
    "they can be evaluated in a systematic expansion in the tunnel couplings while taking into account interaction and nonequilibrium effects exactly .",
    "@xcite in the following , we restrict ourselves to first order terms only which is a good approximation as long as @xmath29 .    for the quantum - dot spin valve , we can rewrite the generalized master equation in a physically intuitive form by introducing the probabilities to find the dot empty @xmath30 , singly occupied @xmath31 or doubly occupied @xmath32 as well as the quantum - statistical average of the dot spin @xmath33 , @xmath34 and @xmath35 .",
    "the generalized master equation can then be split into one set of equations for the occupation probabilities and another one for the average spin .",
    "@xcite the first set of equations is given by    @xmath36    with the fermi function @xmath37 + 1\\}$ ] , where @xmath38 denotes the voltage applied to lead @xmath39 and @xmath40 is the electrode temperature , assumed to be equal for both leads . due to the ferromagnetic electrodes , the occupation probabilities not only couple to each other but also couple to the spin accumulation on the dot .",
    "the equation governing the spin dynamics reads @xmath41 where @xmath42\\end{gathered}\\ ] ] describes the accumulation of spin on the dot due to spin - polarized tunneling on and off the dot .",
    "similarly , @xmath43{\\mathbf{s}}\\ ] ] represents the relaxation of the dot spin due to electron tunneling .",
    "finally , @xmath44 characterizes a precession of the dot spin in the effective exchange field @xmath45 generated by spin - dependent virtual tunneling between the dot and the electrodes .",
    "we now detail how to calculate the waiting - time distribution between tunneling events . in particular , we focus on tunneling out of the dot into the right lead .",
    "the central object in the calculation of the waiting - time distribution is the matrix @xmath46 that can be obtained from @xmath28 in a straightforward way : one simply multiplies each diagram encountered in the evaluation of @xmath28 with a factor + 1 if the corresponding process transfers an electron from the dot into the right lead and with a factor of 0 otherwise .",
    "the waiting - time distribution is then given by  @xcite @xmath47{\\mathbf{w}}^x \\rho^\\text{stat}}{{\\mathbf{e}}^t{\\mathbf{w}}^x \\rho^\\text{stat}},\\ ] ] where @xmath48 is the stationary density matrix satisfying @xmath49 and @xmath50 is a vector that picks out the diagonal density matrix elements .",
    "in general , it is not possible to obtain compact analytical expressions for the waiting - time distribution of a quantum - dot spin valve .",
    "however , in the limiting case that transport occurs through the empty and singly - occupied dot only , @xmath51 and @xmath52 , and the quantum dot is symmetrically coupled to the electrodes , @xmath53 , we find for parallel magnetizations @xmath54 antiparallel magnetizations @xmath55 and arbitrarily oriented magnetizations , neglecting the exchange field in the calculation , @xmath56 in all three cases , the first term arises from the tunneling out of majority spin electrons into the drain .",
    "similarly , the second term is due to the tunneling out of minority spin electrons .",
    "the last term describes tunneling in of electrons from the source . as both majority and minority spin electrons can tunnel into the empty dot , the time scale for this exponential decay does not depend on the polarization .",
    "in the following , we analyze the waiting - time distribution for three different transport regimes that illustrate characteristic transport features of the quantum - dot spin valve .",
    "first , we will consider electron bunching due to a dynamical channel blockade  @xcite which occurs for parallely magnetized electrodes .",
    "@xcite second , we show how the spin precession in the exchange field that occurs for noncollinear magnetizations  @xcite manifests itself in the waiting - time distribution . finally , we discuss signatures of a recently discovered dynamical spin resonance that occurs for nearly antiparallel magnetizations .  @xcite      waiting - time distribution for a symmetric quantum - dot spin valve , @xmath57 , in the parallel geometry , @xmath58 .",
    "the bias voltage is chosen such that transport occurs through the empty and singly - occupied state only . for large polarizations a crossover between two different exponential decay indicates bunching of electron transport . ]    for parallel magnetizations , the average charge current is independent of the polarization @xmath59 because as the current contribution of majority spin electrons increases with @xmath59 , the current contribution of minority spin electrons decreases with @xmath59 by the same amount . however , as @xmath59 increases , the current becomes less regular due to electron bunching .",
    "while majority spin electrons can tunnel easily on and off the dot , the corresponding rates for minority spin electrons are suppressed by @xmath60 .",
    "thus , minority spin electrons dynamically block transport and chop the current into bunches of majority spin electrons flowing through the dot .    in the waiting time distribution",
    ", this dynamical channel blockade shows up as the crossover between two exponential decays with two different time scales . at short times , the exponential decay of the waiting - time distribution is dominated by the tunneling of majority spin electrons @xmath61  .",
    "however , its coefficient is always smaller than that of @xmath61 such that it never dominates the exponential decay of the waiting - time distribution . ] . at longer times , the contribution due to the tunneling of minority spin electrons , @xmath62 , that describes the occasional blockade of the dot , takes over .    as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : parallel ] , the crossover time increases as the polarization @xmath59 is increased .",
    "furthermore , the crossover becomes more pronounced as @xmath59 grows because of the larger difference between the decay rates @xmath63 and @xmath64 . in addition , as @xmath59 is increased the crossover occurs at smaller values of @xmath65 which renders an experimental observation more challenging as it requires a high statistics of tunneling events .",
    "these findings are in agreement with the picture of bunching due to dynamical channel blockade .",
    "as @xmath59 grows , the blockade events due to minority spin electrons on the dot become more and more rare .",
    "in addition , the average duration of an individual blockade event becomes longer as well due to the reduced tunneling out rate of minority spins .",
    "we finally compare our results to the signatures of the dynamical channel blockade in the zero - frequency noise  @xcite . in the regime where transport occurs through the empty and",
    "singly occupied dot only , the zero - frequency fano factor , i.e. the ratio between the current noise and the average current , @xmath66 becomes super - poissonian , @xmath67 , for polarizations larger than  @xcite @xmath68 the fano factor characterizes the average number of electrons within one bunch transferred through the dot .",
    "we remark that in general a larger polarization is needed to observe the electron bunching in the waiting - time distribution than in the fano factor .",
    "we now turn to the case of a quantum - dot spin valve with noncollinearly magnetized leads . in this situation , the dot spin precesses in an exchange field due to virtual tunneling between the dot and the leads .",
    "this spin precession gives rise to characteristic features in the finite - frequency noise at the larmor frequency of the exchange field  @xcite . in the following ,",
    "we demonstrate how the spin precession manifests itself in the waiting - time distribution .",
    "waiting - time distribution as a function of bias voltage for a quantum - dot spin valve with perpendicular magnetizations , @xmath69 .",
    "parameters are @xmath70 , @xmath71 , @xmath72 .",
    "white dashed lines mark the times after which the spin of the dot has precesssed by an angle @xmath73 . ]",
    "figure  [ fig : perpendicular1 ] shows the waiting - time distribution as a function of the bias voltage for perpendicular magnetizations . for a given voltage , the waiting - time distribution shows oscillations with a frequency given by the larmor frequency of the spin precession .",
    "the mechanism that gives rise to these oscillations is the following .",
    "electrons preferrably enter the dot with a spin pointing along the magnetization of the source electrode . on the dot , the electron spin precesses in the exchange field .",
    "after a precession by an angle of @xmath73 , the overlap between the dot spin and the majority spins of the drain electrode becomes maximal .",
    "hence , there is an increased probability to tunnel out of the dot that leads to local maxima of the waiting - time distribution .",
    "we remark that the position of the maxima is not precisely given by @xmath74 as it takes a finite time for an electron to tunnel into the empty dot .",
    "as the larmor frequency depends on the energy - dependent exchange field , the frequency of the oscillations changes with bias voltage as can be clearly seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : perpendicular1 ] . at the particle - hole symmetric point , @xmath75",
    ", the exchange field does not affect the dot spin at all and hence the oscillations vanish at this point .",
    "waiting - time distribution for a quantum dot spin - valve with perpendicular magnetizations .",
    "@xmath76 , other parameters as in fig .",
    "[ fig : perpendicular1 ] . ]    in fig .",
    "[ fig : perpendicular2 ] , we plot the waiting - time distribution for a fixed bias voltage and different values of the polarization . while for halfmetallic leads the oscillations in the waiting times are well pronounced ,",
    "they quickly get washed out as the polarization is reduced and disappear around @xmath77 because of the strong decoherence due to tunneling events .",
    "hence , in order to observe the spin precession in the waiting times , highly polarized electrodes are needed .",
    "this in in contrast to the signatures in the finite - frequency noise that are observable even for moderate polarizations of @xmath78 achieveable , e.g. , with electrodes made from fe , ni or co  @xcite .",
    "waiting - time distribution as a function of applied bias voltage and time .",
    "parameters are @xmath79 , @xmath80 , @xmath72 and @xmath81 .",
    "white dashed lines mark again the times after which the spin has precessed by an angle @xmath73 in the exchange field . ]    as a last transport feature , we discuss how a recently predicted spin resonance  @xcite manifests itself in the waiting - time distribution . to this end , we consider transport inside the coulomb - blockade region where the dot is preferrably singly occupied . in principle , one needs to perform a second - order calculation here .",
    "however , we expect that our sequential tunneling approximation still captures the essential features of the spin resonance and its signatures in the waiting - time distribution .",
    "as in the coulomb - blockade regime adding or removing an extra electron from the dot is energetically unfavorable , electrons on the dot have a long life - time such that the waiting time decays exponentially on a very long time scale .",
    "we now focus on the case of nearly antiparallely magnetized leads .",
    "in this situation , we get on top of the coulomb - blockade also a spin blockade as majority spin electrons from the source are minority spin electrons in the drain and hence have a suppressed probability of leaving the dot . in the nearly antiparallel geometry",
    ", the exchange field typically has a large component along the spin accumulation on the dot and only a small component perpendicular to it .",
    "hence , there is only a very weak precession of the dot spin that can not lift the spin blockade . in consequence ,",
    "the waiting - time distribution shows a slow exponential decay with weak oscillations superimposed , cf .",
    "fig  [ fig : spinresonance ] at @xmath82 .    however , as the exchange field contributions from the left and right lead have indepenent dependencies on the level position and bias voltage , it is possible to achieve that the exchange field component along the spin accumulation vanishes . in this case , the spin precesses in the small remaining exchange field perpendicular to the spin accumulation .",
    "this precession periodically lifts the spin blockade of the dot and increases the current from its suppressed value in the antiparallel geometry back to value in the parallel geometry  @xcite . in the waiting time distribution ,",
    "the resonance shows up as strong oscillations with the larmor frequency on top of a slow exponential decay , cf .",
    "fig  [ fig : spinresonance ] at @xmath83 .",
    "hence , as the system is tuned through the resonance , the current exhibits a peak ( not shown ) while the waiting - time distribution shows an increase of the period and amplitude of its oscillations .",
    "we have analyzed the electronic waiting time of a quantum - dot spin valve .",
    "we obtained analytical results for the waiting - time distribution for collinear magnetizations as well as in the noncollinear case when neglecting the effect of a tunneling induced exchange field .",
    "we then discussed signatures of characteristic transport features of a quantum - dot spin valve in the waiting - time distribution .",
    "in particular , we showed that the electron bunching due to dynamical channel blockade leads to two different exponential decays of the waiting - time distribution .",
    "the spin precession for noncollinear setups gives rise to characteristic oscillations of the waiting - time distribution .",
    "finally , we demonstrated that a recently predicted spin resonance in the coulomb - blockade regime gives rise to pronounced oscillations in the waiting - time distribution on a very long time scale .",
