    "we first perform a detailed analysis for the single massless and massive field theories and then work out the thdm extension , we do this only for the scalar sector , since all other sectors are equal to those of the minimal standard model , for which the effective potential has been obtained even up to the three loop level in some scenarios @xcite .",
    "the rest of our paper is structured as follows : in sec .",
    "[ sec : derivation ] we present the general features used in the derivation of the effective potential . and then proceed to calculate the massless self interacting real scalar field potential in sec . [ sec : massless ] .",

    "[ conclusion ] .",
    "for a single real massless self interactive scalar , whose lagrangian is given by    @xmath0    the one loop level corrections to the potential are given by an infinite series of feynman diagrams ; the first four of which are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : loop - a - d ]    [ fig : a ] [ fig : b ] [ fig : c ] + [ fig : d ]    the first diagram contains only one vertex , so we only need one factor of @xmath1 ( the factor of @xmath2 cancels with the one of the propagator ) ; and it has a single propagator inside the loop .",
    "the second diagram , has two vertices and two propagators . in general",
    ", the @xmath3-th diagram contains @xmath3 vertices and @xmath3 propagators , each one corresponding to a side of the polygon formed in the center of each diagram .",
    "so , from the first diagram we obtain : @xmath4 where @xmath5 represents the momentum of the particle going around the loop .",
    "it is a virtual particle , so we actually have to integrate over all of its possible values , that is , from minus infinity to plus infinity ( for each component ) : @xmath6 the denominator @xmath7 is conventional , and the integration limits are usually left implicit when they are @xmath8 .",
    "now we must add combinatoric factors : the diagram stays the same if we interchange the _ two _ external legs attached to the vertex , so we add a @xmath9 ; and it is also invariant under a reflection through a vertical axis passing through the center of the loop , so we have another @xmath9 : @xmath10 finally , because of the definition of the connected generating functional , we have a factor of @xmath2 and because of the form of the taylor series expansion , we must add a @xmath11 for each vertex in the diagram , so the final expression for the first diagram is @xmath12 where the @xmath13 is defined as the functional derivative of the connected generating functional with respect to the external source .",
    "repeating the above reasoning , we arrive at the conclusion that the @xmath3-th diagram is represented by the expression @xmath14 summing all of them , we obtain @xmath15 performing a wick rotation , that is , making the change of variable @xmath16 of the time component of the momentum ; we eliminate the pre - factor of @xmath2 and leave a minus sign .",
    "we also identify the infinite sum with the following taylor series expansion of the logarithm : @xmath17 and dropping the @xmath18 , @xmath19 in general , we set the second derivative of the potential , evaluated at @xmath20 , equal to the ( squared ) renormalized mass @xmath21 of the particle : @xmath22 and for the the particular case of a massless scalar ( which we will treat in the following section ) , we have @xmath23 another renormalization condition that is employed concerns the fourth derivative of the potential which is equated to the coupling constant @xmath1 @xmath24 where we evaluate @xmath13 at @xmath25 to avoid ir divergences .",
    "@xmath25 is called the _ renormalization mass _ which is an arbitrary quantity .",

    "we can drop the first term because it vanishes in the limit of large @xmath32 ; also in this limit we have @xmath33 substituting the analytical solution of the logarithmic integral that we solve we now arrive at the following expression for the potential @xmath34 the counterterm coefficient @xmath28 is obtained through eq .",

    "@xcite , our final expression for the potential is the same .",
    "the lagrangian for a massive self interacting scalar field theory is given by @xmath38 so we identify the potential as @xmath39 once again we are left with an integral over the sum of the one loop level self interacting contributions which we write as a logarithmic integral ( the detailed derivation is found in appendix [ app : integral2 ] ) @xmath40 from which we arrive at the effective one loop level potential for a massive interacting scalar field @xmath41 .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the methodology used in obtaining the analytical solution for this case will now be extended to calculate the potential of interacting scalar fields in the thdm .",
    "because we are interested in the one - loop vacuum corrections of the scalar sector of the thdm ( a review on the thmd can be found in ref .",

    "but since we choose to work in the unitary gauge , the goldstone bosons will be `` eaten '' by the su(2)@xmath53u(1 ) gauge fields . therefore , we will only be dealing with the physical fields .",

    "the subsequent four terms of the effective potential which have two equal pairs @xmath60 , @xmath61 are given by @xmath64 finally we have the terms in which we have a single pair of scalars of the same kind and the remaining two are of a different type @xmath65 the last term in the potential involves the coupling of fields which are all of a different kind , such as @xmath66 , this type of coupling does not permit a polygon diagram whose series is constructible .",
    "we calculated the contributions of the thdm effective potential that come from one - loop diagrams with quartic coupling vertices which are dimensionally consistent and renormalizable .",
    "we hope this analytical scheme will be of use to model builders interested in theories that must take in to consideration vacuum corrections to two or more scalars .",
