    "optimization lies at the heart of a vast number of phenomena : particles `` seek '' paths with minimal action , species `` try '' to maximize fitness , companies minimize cost .",
    "many optimization problems , e.g. , the traveling salesman problem , are notoriously hard@xcite . additionally , optimization problems often involve randomness which makes them even more complicated .",
    "when the number of random entries is very large , however , optimization problems might become simpler thanks to the `` concentration of the measure '' .",
    "this means that the probability distribution of some random variable becomes highly localized , almost like a delta function concentrated around its average value .",
    "this phenomenon is well - known in probability theory where , for instance , it accounts for the fact that after flipping a coin @xmath14 times , the probability that the number of heads exceeds @xmath15 by more than , say , @xmath16 is about @xmath17 .",
    "below , we shall investigate an optimization problem in random media which demonstrates this concentration of the measure in the strongest sense ( the variance of the optimized quantity is finite ) and displays an unbinding phase transition .",
    "a remarkable hidden connection with traveling wave phenomena allows to explain both the concentration of the measure and the phase transition .",
    "the optimization problem considered in this work can be formulated as follows : take a rooted tree whose bonds have random lengths and find descending paths of extremal total length .",
    "we assume that a random length ( or energy ) is assigned to each bond of the tree , and that lengths are independent and chosen from the same probability distribution @xmath0 .",
    "the total length of a path is the sum of lengths of the bonds along the path , and we want to determine the minimal ( maximal ) length among the paths from the root to the bottom of the tree .",
    "we focus on a rooted cayley tree where each node , except the root , has coordination number 3 ; the coordination number of the root is 2 . however , our main results can be easily generalized to the case of a tree with arbitrary coordination number , and even to trees where the coordination number at any node is random .",
    "similar problems arise in numerous fields ranging from computer science@xcite to condensed matter physics@xcite , where it is known as the problem of directed polymers in random media .",
    "indeed , the minimal path problem can be considered as the zero temperature limit of the problem of directed polymer on cayley trees .",
    "directed polymers on cayley trees have been investigated in the past@xcite , and recently this problem has resurfaced in a surprisingly large number of apparently unrelated problems@xcite . however , the emphasis of refs.@xcite was on the spin glass like transition occurring at a finite temperature . here",
    ", we consider exactly zero temperature and focus on the unbinding transition driven by the parameter @xmath3 of the bimodal distribution , @xmath2 .",
    "recently , similar unbinding ( or `` depinning '' ) phase transitions have been found in a number of non - equilibrium processes without quenched disorder@xcite .",
    "let us first outline our main results .",
    "we derive exactly the statistics of both the minimal and maximal path on a random cayley tree for arbitrary distribution @xmath0 of the edge lengths .",
    "we find a class of distributions for which the minimal path undergoes an unbinding phase transition from a localized phase to a moving phase as a parameter of the distribution is varied . a particular example , which we study in detail in this paper , is the bimodal distribution . in the bimodal case ,",
    "length of each bond can be either @xmath18 with probability @xmath3 or @xmath19 with probability @xmath20 .",
    "for any path starting at the root and moving down , the length of the path is the sum of the lengths of the bonds along the path , i.e. , the number of @xmath18 s along the path .",
    "there are @xmath21 paths from the root to the @xmath22 level .",
    "we show that the minimal length exhibits an unbinding transition as the parameter @xmath3 varies between 0 and 1 .",
    "there exists a critical value @xmath23 such that the average minimal length grows linearly with @xmath6 when @xmath24 , but gets pinned , i.e. , remains finite for large @xmath6 when @xmath25 .",
    "more specifically , we find that for large @xmath6 , the average minimal length @xmath26 behaves as @xmath27 for @xmath24 , we shall later compute the minimal `` velocity '' @xmath28 exactly .",
    "the average maximal length , on the other hand , behaves as @xmath29 where @xmath30 .",
    "this duality relation is very general and valid for directed paths on arbitrary graphs , i.e. , for finite - dimensional lattices .",
    "we also derive a generalized duality relation between minimal and maximal velocities for a certain class of bounded distributions .    the minimal length problem on a rooted cayley tree , where the coordination number at each node is random , also displays an unbinding transition at @xmath31 , where @xmath5 is the average number of branches per node . at the critical point ,",
    "the average minimal length @xmath26 exhibits the same double logarithmic growth for any @xmath32 , and above @xmath33 the minimal length grows linearly with @xmath6 with velocity @xmath34 .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii , we study the unbinding transition of the minimal path for the special bimodal distribution in detail . in section iii",
    ", we study the maximal path for the bimodal case and derive the duality relation . in section iv , we generalize the results to a cayley tree with random branching . in section iv , we go beyond the bimodal distribution and obtain generalized results for arbitrary distribution of the edge length .",
    "finally we conclude in section vi with a brief summary and outlook .",
    "instead of studying @xmath35 , it proves convenient to consider the cumulative distribution , @xmath36 . clearly , @xmath37 is the probability that all possible paths to the @xmath22 level have lengths @xmath38 .",
    "once we get @xmath37 , the distribution of the minimal length is found from the obvious identity @xmath39 .",
    "it is easy to see that @xmath37 satisfies the following recursion relation @xmath40 ^ 2.\\ ] ] this relation can be derived by analyzing various possibilities for the lengths of the two edges issuing from the root and taking into account that two subsequent daughter trees are statistically independent .",
    "for instance , both lengths are equal to zero with probability @xmath41 , and paths in the subsequent trees have lengths @xmath38 with probability @xmath42 ; this provides the contribution @xmath43 to @xmath44 .",
    "similarly , one gets the contributions @xmath45 and @xmath46 , which sum up to eq .",
    "( [ pn ] ) .",
    "we must solve eq .",
    "( [ pn ] ) subject to the initial condition @xmath47 clearly , the minimal length @xmath48 is a random variable which takes values between @xmath19 and @xmath6 , and eqs .",
    "( [ pn])([p0 ] ) indeed show that @xmath49 for @xmath50 and @xmath51 for @xmath52 .",
    "when @xmath6 grows , @xmath48 increases as well and thus it should reach a limit . for @xmath25 ,",
    "this limit is finite , i.e. , one can find an infinite path with only finite number of edges of length 1 .",
    "mathematically , it means that @xmath37 approaches a stationary distribution , @xmath53 , which satisfies @xmath54 ^ 2.\\ ] ] starting from @xmath55 , one computes @xmath56 recursively : @xmath57 , etc . @xmath56",
    "vanishes extremely fast in the large @xmath58 limit : @xmath59 .    for @xmath60 , the minimal length grows as @xmath6 increases . to understand why this is so ,",
    "recall that @xmath61 and look at @xmath62 . by inserting @xmath63 into eq .",
    "( [ pn ] ) we find @xmath64 .",
    "hence @xmath65 for @xmath60 .",
    "proceeding this line of reasoning one can verify that @xmath66 when @xmath67 .",
    "additionally , we see the difference between the cases of @xmath24 and @xmath68 : in the former situation , @xmath66 exponentially fast , while in the latter situation the approach is algebraic . therefore , the size of the region where @xmath37 is close to 1 should grow linearly with @xmath6 when @xmath24 .",
    "thus the distribution @xmath37 approaches the traveling wave form ( see fig . ( 1 ) ) , @xmath69 in eq .",
    "( [ trav ] ) , we have chosen @xmath70 as the wave variable .",
    "one can justify this choice by noting that the relation @xmath71 leads to identity @xmath72                    = \\sum_{x=1}^\\infty p_n(x),\\ ] ] and hence @xmath26 is indeed an appropriate characterization of the location of the front . by inserting the wave form ( [ trav ] ) into eq .",
    "( [ pn ] ) and using @xmath73 we find , @xmath74 the solution of this equation looks like a @xmath75 $ ] waveform with @xmath76 as @xmath77 and @xmath78 as @xmath79 .",
    "while it is very hard to solve this nonlinear , nonlocal equation exactly , the velocity can be found by analyzing the tail region , @xmath80 , where @xmath81 is small .",
    "linearizing eq .",

    "while any such @xmath84 is in principle allowed , and thus the entire velocity range of is feasible , a particular value is actually selected .",
    "this is similar to the velocity selection in a large class of problems with a traveling wave front@xcite .",

    "our derivation of eq .",
    "( [ lnlog ] ) follows an approach of ref.@xcite , and we only outline the main steps .",
    "first , we need to examine the exact equation ( [ pn ] ) rather than the @xmath67 limit , eq .",

    "this phase transition is driven by the parameter @xmath3 of the bimodal distribution . in the localized phase ( @xmath7 ) , the minimal length distribution approaches a stationary depth - independent form @xmath260 .",
    "this distribution vanishes extremely sharply , as the double exponential , in the large @xmath58 limit . in the moving phase ( @xmath9 ) , the minimal length distribution @xmath261 approaches a traveling wave form with the front velocity relaxing algebraically , @xmath262 , in the large @xmath6 limit .",

    "we have found that the tail of the minimal length distribution is a double exponential , in contrast with a simple exponential that occurs in most traveling wave problems@xcite .",
