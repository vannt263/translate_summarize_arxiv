    "since poincar , homology has been  used as the main descriptor of the topology of geometric objects . in the classical context , however , all homology classes receive equal attention .",
    "meanwhile , applications of topology in analysis of images and data have to deal with noise and other uncertainty .",
    "this uncertainty appears usually in the form of a real valued function defined on the topological space .",
    "persistence is a measure of robustness of the homology classes of the lower level sets of this function @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "since it s unknown beforehand what is or is not noise in the dataset , we need to capture all homology classes including those that may be deemed noise later . in this paper",
    "we introduce an algebraic structure that contains , without duplication , all these classes .",
    "each of them is associated with its persistence and can be removed when the acceptable threshold for noise is set .",
    "the last step can be carried out repeatedly in order to find the best possible threshold .",
    "the approach follows the approach to analysis of digital images presented in @xcite .",
    "the topological spaces subject to such analysis are cell complexes .",
    "cell complex _ is a combinatorial structure that describes how @xmath0-dimensional cells are attached to each other along @xmath1-dimensional cells .",
    "cell complexes come from the following two main sources .",
    "first , a gray scale image is a real - valued function @xmath2 defined on a rectangle . given a threshold @xmath3 , the lower level set @xmath4 can be thought of as a binary image .",
    "each black pixel of this image is treated as a square cell in the plane .",
    "these 2-dimensional cells are combined with their edges ( 1-cells ) and vertices ( 0-cells ) and in the @xmath5-dimensional case , the image is decomposed into a combination of @xmath6- , @xmath7- , ... , @xmath5-cubes .",
    "this process is called _",
    "thresholding_. the result is a cell complex @xmath8 for each @xmath9 see @xcite .",
    "second , a point cloud is a finite set @xmath10 in some euclidean space of dimension @xmath11 . given a threshold @xmath3 ,",
    "we deem any two points that lie within @xmath3 from each other as `` close '' . in this case , this pair of points is connected by an edge .",
    "further , if three points are `` close '' , pairwise , to each other , we add a face spanned by these points . if there are four , we add a tetrahedron , and , finally , any @xmath12 `` close '' points create a @xmath11-cell .",
    "the process is called the _ vietoris - rips construction_. the result is a cell complex @xmath8 for each @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "next , we would like to quantify the topology of the cell complex @xmath13 it is done via the _ betti numbersof _",
    "@xmath8 : @xmath14 is the number of connected components in @xmath8 ; @xmath15 is the number of holes or tunnels ( 1 for letter o or the donut ; 2 for letter b and the torus ) ; @xmath16 is the number of voids or cavities ( 1 for both the sphere and the torus ) , etc .",
    "the betti numbers are computed via _ homology theory _ @xcite .",
    "one starts by considering the collection _ _  _ _ @xmath17 of all formal linear combinations ( over a ring @xmath18 ) of @xmath19cells in @xmath20 called _",
    "chains_. combined they form a finitely generated abelian group called the _ chain complex _ @xmath17 , or collectively @xmath21 a @xmath0-chain can be recorded as an @xmath22-vector , where @xmath22 is the total number of @xmath0-cells in @xmath8 .",
    "the boundary of a @xmath0-chain is the chain comprised of all @xmath1-faces of its cells taken with appropriate signs . then the _ boundary operator _",
    "@xmath23 acts on the chain complex and is represented by a @xmath24 matrix .    from the chain complex @xmath25",
    "the homology group is constructed by means of the standard algebraic tools . to capture the topological features one concentrates on _ cycles _ , i.e. , chains with zero boundary , @xmath26 .",
    "further , one can verify whether two given @xmath0-cycles @xmath27 and @xmath28 are _ homologous _ : the difference between them is the boundary of a @xmath29-chain @xmath30 ( such as two meridians of the torus ) . in this case ,",
    "@xmath27 and @xmath31 belong to the same _ homology class _ @xmath32=[b]$ ] .",
    "the totality of these equivalence classes in each dimension @xmath0 is called the @xmath0-th _ homology group _",
    "@xmath33 of @xmath8 , collectively @xmath34 .",
    "then , betti number @xmath35 is the rank of @xmath33 .",
    "the methods for computing homology groups are well developed . in real - life applications",
    "however both digital images and point clouds may be noisy and one needs to evaluate the significance of their homology classes .",
    "the approach to this problem has been the following . instead of using a single threshold and studying a single cell complex",
    ", one considers all thresholds and all possible cell complexes . since",
    "increasing threshold @xmath3 enlarges the corresponding complex , we have a sequence of complexes:@xmath36where the arrows represent the inclusions : @xmath37 let @xmath38 also be the inclusion .",
    "this structure @xmath39 is called a _ _",
    "filtration__@xmath40    now , each of these inclusions generates a homomorphism @xmath41 called the _ homology map induced by _",
    "@xmath42 as a result , we have a sequence of homology groups connected by these homomorphisms : @xmath43these homomorphisms record how the homology changes as the complex grows at each step . for example , a component appears and then merges with another one , or a hole is formed and then filled .",
    "we refer to these events as _ birth and death _ of the corresponding homology classes .    in order to evaluate the robustness of an element of one of these groups the _ persistence of a homology class _",
    "is defined as the number of steps it takes for the class to end at @xmath44 in other words,@xmath45the @xmath46-_persistent homology group _ of @xmath47 is defined as the image of @xmath48 it s what s left from @xmath49 after @xmath46 steps in the filtration .",
    "now the robustness of the homology classes of the filtration is evaluated in terms of the set of intervals @xmath50 $ ] representing the life - spans , called _ barcodes _ , of the homology classes @xcite .",
    "our approach is somewhat different .",
    "it consists of two steps .",
    "first step : we pool all possible homology classes in all elements of the filtration together in a single algebraic structure ( sections 4 and 5 ) .",
    "the presence of noise is ignored . the homology group @xmath51 of filtration _ _  _ _",
    "@xmath52 captures all homology classes in the whole filtration  without double counting .",
    "second step : for a given positive integer @xmath53 the @xmath46__-__noise group _ _  _ _",
    "is comprised of the homology classes in @xmath51 with the persistence less than @xmath55 next , we `` remove '' the noise from the homology group of filtration by using the quotient ( sections 6 and 7 ) : @xmath56 in other words : _ if the difference between two homology classes is deemed noise , they are equivalent_. the second step can be repeated as needed .",
    "we also discuss the computational aspects of this approach ( section 8) and multiparameter filtrations ( section 9 ) .",
    "our approach provides a coarser classification of the homology of filtrations than the one based on barcodes .",
    "the reason is that all homology classes with long enough life - spans , i.e. , high persistence , have equal place in the homology group @xmath51 of the filtration regardless of the time of birth and death .",
    "in this section we will try to understand the meaning of the homology of the gray scale image in figure 1 . for simplicity",
    "we assume that there are only 2 levels of gray in addition to black and white .",
    "a visual inspection of the image suggests that it has three connected components each with a hole .",
    "therefore , its @xmath6- and @xmath7-homology groups shouldhave three generators each .",
    "we now develop an algebraic procedure to arrive at this result .",
    "first the image is `` thresholded '' .",
    "the lower level sets of the gray scale function of the image form a filtration : a sequence of three binary images , i.e. cell complexes : @xmath57 where the arrows represent the inclusions .",
    "suppose @xmath58 are the homology classes that represent the components of @xmath47 and @xmath59 are the holes , clockwise starting at the upper left corner .",
    "the homology groups of these images also form sequences ",
    "one for each dimension 0 and 1 .",
    "suppose @xmath60 are  the two homology maps , i.e. , homomorphisms of the homology groups generated by the inclusions of the complexes , with @xmath61 included for convenience .",
    "these homomorphisms act on the generators , as follows : @xmath62 to avoid double counting , we want to count only the homology classes that do nt reappear in the next homology group .",
    "as it turns out , a more algebraically convenient way to accomplish this is to count only the homology classes that go to @xmath6 under these homomorphisms .",
    "these classes form the kernels of @xmath63 . now",
    ", we choose the homology group of the original , gray scale image to be the direct sum of these kernels:@xmath64thus the image has three components and three holes , as expected .",
    "in the following sections we provide formal definitions .",
    "all cell complexes are finite .",
    "suppose we have a one - parameter filtration:@xmath65here",
    "@xmath66  are cell complexes and the arrows represent the inclusions @xmath67 and so do @xmath68 .",
    "we will denote the filtration by @xmath69 or simply @xmath70 next , homology generates a `` direct system '' of groups and homomorphisms:@xmath43we denote this direct system by @xmath71 or simply @xmath72 the zero is added in the end for convenience .    our goal is to define a single structure that captures all homology classes in the whole filtration without double counting .",
    "the rationale is that if @xmath73 @xmath74 and there is no other @xmath75 satisfying this condition , then @xmath75 and @xmath76 may be thought of as representing the same homology class of the geometric object behind the filtration .    the _ homology group of filtration _",
    "@xmath52 is defined as the product of the kernels of the inclusions:@xmath77here , from each group we take only the elements that are about to die .",
    "since each dies only once , there is no double - counting . since the sequence ends with @xmath78 we know that everyone will die eventually .",
    "hence every homology class appears once and only once .",
    "these are a few simple facts about this group .",
    "if @xmath79 is an isomorphism for each @xmath80 then @xmath81 @xmath82    if @xmath79 is a monomorphism for each @xmath80 then @xmath83",
    "suppose @xmath84 and @xmath85 are filtrations .",
    "then @xmath86    suppose @xmath84 and @xmath85 are filtrations and @xmath87 is a cell map .",
    "then the homology map of the homology groups of these filtrations @xmath88 is well defined as@xmath89 where @xmath90 is the restriction of @xmath2 to @xmath91    the stability of the homology group of a filtration follows from the stability of its persistence diagram , i.e. , the set of points @xmath92 for the generators of the homology groups of the filtration , plus the diagonal .",
    "it is proven in @xcite that @xmath93 where @xmath94 is the bottle - neck distance between the persistence diagrams @xmath95 of two filtrations generated by tame functions @xmath96 function @xmath97 creates an analogue bottle - neck distance for the set of points @xmath98 and its stability follows from the continuity of @xmath99 .",
    "to justify our approach to persistence , we observe that some of the features in the image in figure 1 are more prominent than others . in particular , some of the features have lower contrast .",
    "these are the holes in the second and the third rings as well as the third ring itself . by _",
    "contrast _ of a lower level set of the gray level function we understand the difference between the highest gray level adjacent to the set and the lowest gray level within the set .",
    "an easy computation shows that the homology classes with persistence of 3 or higher among the generators are : @xmath100 however , the set of the classes of high persistence is nt a subgroup of the homology group of the respective complex .",
    "instead , we look at the classes with _ low _ persistence , i.e. , the noise . in particular , the classes in @xmath101 of persistence 2 or lower form",
    "the kernel of @xmath102 .",
    "we now `` remove '' this noise from the homology groups of the filtration by considering their quotients over these kernels .",
    "in particular , the 3-persistent homology groups of the image are:@xmath103observe that the output is identical to the homology of a single complex , i.e. , a binary image , with two components and one hole .",
    "the way persistence is defined ensures that we can never remove a component as noise but keep a hole in it .",
    "observe now that the holes in the second and third rings have the same persistence ( contrast ) and , therefore , occupy the same position in the homology group regardless of their birth dates ( gray level ) .",
    "second , if we shrunk one of these rings , its persistence and , therefore , its place in the homology group would nt change .",
    "these observations confirm the fact that the homology group of the gray scale image , unlike the barcodes , captures only its topology .    in the case of a vietoris - ripps complex , not only the barcode , [ birth , death ] , but also the persistence , death - birth , of a homology class contains information about the size of representatives of these classes .",
    "for example , a set of points arranged in a circle will produce a 1-cycle with twice as large birth , death , and persistence than the same set shrunk by a factor of 2 .",
    "however , persistence defined as death / birth will have the desired property of scale independence .",
    "the same result can be achieved by an appropriate re - parametrizing of the filtration .",
    "in the general context of filtrations the measure of importance of a homology class is its persistence which is the length of its lifespan within the direct system of homology of the filtration .    given filtration @xmath104 we say that _ the persistence _",
    "@xmath105 _ of _ @xmath106 _ _  is equal to _ _",
    "@xmath46 if @xmath107 and @xmath108 our interest is in the `` robust '' homology classes , i.e. the ones with high persistence . however , the collection of these classes is not a group as it does nt even contain 0 .",
    "so we deal with `` noise '' first .",
    "given a positive integer @xmath53 the @xmath46__-noise ( homology ) group _ _ @xmath109 of @xmath52 is the group of all elements of @xmath110 with persistence less than @xmath55    alternatively , we can define these groups via kernels of the homomorphisms of the inclusions : @xmath111    @xmath112    next , we `` remove '' the noise from the homology group .",
    "the @xmath46__-persistent ( homology ) group _ _ of @xmath110 with respect to the filtration @xmath113 is defined as @xmath114the point of this definition is that , given a threshold for noise , if the difference between two homology classes is noise , they should be equivalent .",
    "next , just as in the case of noise - less analysis , we define a single structure to capture all ( robust ) homology classes .",
    "let @xmath46 be a positive integer@xmath82 suppose @xmath115 and let @xmath116 @xmath117 then@xmath118hence @xmath119 we have proved that @xmath120it follows that the homomorphism @xmath121 generated by the inclusion is well - defined .",
    "next , we use these homomorphisms to define the @xmath46__-noise ( homology ) group _ _ @xmath54 _ _  of filtration _ _ @xmath52 as @xmath122observe that the formula is the same as the one in the definiton of @xmath123 since @xmath121 is a restriction of @xmath124 each term in the above definition is a subgroup of the corresponding term in the definition of @xmath125 the proposition below follows .",
    "@xmath126    finally , the _ _  _ _ @xmath46__-persistent ( homology ) group of filtration _",
    "_ @xmath52 is @xmath56    the results about @xmath127 analogous to the ones about @xmath128 in section 5 hold .",
    "for 2-dimensional gray scale images , this approach to homology and persistence has been used in an image analysis program . the algorithm described in @xcite has complexity of @xmath129 where @xmath5 is the number of pixels in the image .    for the general case ,",
    "the analysis algorithm may be outlined as follows :    1 .",
    "the input is a filtration .",
    "2 .   the homology groups of its members and the homomorphisms induced by inclusions are computed .",
    "3 .   the homology group of the filtration is computed .",
    "4 .   the persistence of all elements of the homology groups is computed .",
    "the user sets a threshold @xmath46 for persistence and the @xmath46-noise group of the filtration is computed .",
    "the @xmath46-persistent homology group of the filtration is computed and given as output .",
    "if the user changes the threshold , the last step is repeated as necessary without repeating the rest .",
    "the algorithm above computes the homology group of filtration , as defined , incrementally .",
    "this may be both a disadvantage and an advantage . in comparison",
    ", the persistence complex @xcite also contains information about all homology classes of the filtration but its computation does not require computing the homology of each complex of the filtration . meanwhile , the above algorithm may have to compute the same homology over and over if consecutive complexes are identical . hence , the algorithm has a disadvantage in terms of processing time . on the other hand ,",
    "the incremental nature of the algorithm makes its use  of memory independent from the length of the filtration .",
    "another advantage is that multi - parameter filtrations are dealt with in the exact same manner ( see next section ) .",
    "the inefficiency of the above algorithm can be addressed with a proper algebraic tool .",
    "this tool is the mapping cone @xcite .",
    "suppose , for simplicity , that our filtration has only two elements : @xmath130 the mapping cone is , in a sense , a combination of the kernel and the cokernel of @xmath131 .",
    "it captures the difference between @xmath132 and @xmath133 on the chain level : everything in @xmath134 is killed unless it also appears in @xmath135 under @xmath136 .",
    "then the algorithm is to construct the homology group from the chain complexes @xmath137 of the elements of the filtration and the chain map @xmath138",
    "multiparameter filtrations come from the same main sources as one - parameter filtrations . first , color images are thresholded according to their three color channels .",
    "second , point clouds are thresholded by the closeness of their points and , for example , the density of hte points .",
    "let limit our attention to the two - parameter case .",
    "a ( finite ) two - parameter filtrations @xmath139 is a table of complexes connected by inclusions @xmath140 these inclusions generate homomorphisms @xmath141with 0s added in the end of each row and each column .",
