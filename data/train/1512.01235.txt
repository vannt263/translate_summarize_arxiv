    "low - mass `` dwarf '' ( @xmath9 ) galaxies provide probes of structure formation on the smallest cosmological scales and thus represent compelling laboratories for testing the @xmath8cdm ( cold dark matter plus a cosmological constant ) framework .",
    "in addition , because low - mass galaxies reside in low - mass halos with shallow gravitational potential wells and low escape velocities , they are highly sensitive to stellar feedback as compared to more massive galaxies .    during episodes of star formation , radiation pressure , photoionization and photoelectric heating , stellar winds , and supernovae inject both energy and momentum into the interstellar medium ( ism ) . especially in low - mass galaxies , these processes can fuel powerful galactic winds that drive significant ism mass into the halo and cause the star formation rate ( sfr ) to decline until gas cools and reaccretes back into the galaxy . as a result",
    ", low - mass galaxies are thought to have highly stochastic and bursty sfrs ( for example , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which in turn can have significant effects on these galaxies dynamical and morphological evolution .",
    "for instance , bursty star formation may explain the lack of coherent , rotationally - supported disks in galaxies with @xmath10 @xcite and the fact that star - forming galaxies are more likely to be dispersion - supported at low mass than at high mass @xcite .",
    "many studies have shown that stellar feedback - driven gas outflows can displace a significant fraction of a galaxy s total gas mass ( for example , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and several recent works have investigated how the resulting time - varying potential can transfer orbital energy to dark matter .",
    "baryon - driven potential fluctuations have been invoked as a possible solution to several of the discrepancies between the predictions of the @xmath8cdm framework and observation , including the `` core - cusp '' problem ( for example , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and the related `` too - big - to - fail '' problem @xcite , demonstrating that baryonic physics can have significant and lasting effects on the distribution of ( collisionless ) dark matter .",
    "stars are also ( effectively ) collisionless and thus feel the same fluctuations in the gravitational potential that transfer energy to dark matter .",
    "therefore , one might expect the kinematics of stars to respond to feedback - driven outflows in much the same way as dark matter .",
    "some theoretical works have shown that gas outflows / inflows can drive kinematic fluctuations of _ all _ matter in the central regions of bursty gas - rich dwarf galaxies , particularly at high redshifts @xcite .",
    "however , few works have studied in detail the effects of outflows on stellar kinematics , especially at late cosmic times .",
    "stellar migration has been studied extensively in other contexts , though mostly in massive ( @xmath11 ) , disk - dominated galaxies . here ,",
    "non - axisymmetric gas and stellar structures within the disk have been shown to drive radial migration without appreciably heating the stellar population .",
    "however , fewer works have investigated radial migration in low - mass galaxies . because low - mass galaxies generally lack strong disks , bars , or spiral arms , radial migration often is assumed to be less important in this regime .",
    "some previous studies of low - mass galaxies have found that their stellar orbits are perturbed primarily by gentle dynamical heating @xcite , which becomes important only on cosmological timescales ( if at all ) and does not appreciably change radial population gradients . in general ,",
    "most studies of stellar kinematics and radial migration assume that the global galactic potential is smooth and varies gradually over time .",
    "however , the many recent studies of dark - matter coring , as cited above , demonstrate that this assumption is not necessarily valid in the low - mass regime .    in this work ,",
    "we investigate in detail the effects of stellar feedback - driven gas outflows / inflows on _ stellar _ kinematics in isolated low - mass galaxies using cosmological zoom - in hydrodynamic simulations .",
    "we examine how feedback drives rapid radial migration of stars over short timescales and demonstrate that the cumulative effects of many starburst episodes drive systematic outward migration over cosmological timescales .",

    "regardless of the exact threshold , we emphasize that the most important criterion in the fire model is that star - forming gas must be locally self - gravitating : we have tested thresholds of @xmath19 and find no significant differences in galaxy - wide properties .",
    "as star particles evolve , they deposit energy , momentum , mass , and metals into nearby gas particles .",
    "we incorporate a comprehensive set of stellar feedback processes , as detailed in @xcite : radiation pressure from massive stars , local photoionization and photoelectric heating , core - collapse and type ia supernovae with appropriate momentum and thermal energy injection , and stellar winds .",
    "we use energy , momentum , mass , and metal return computed directly from starburst99 @xcite ; we never turn off cooling of supernova - heated gas .",

    ". we also experimented with centering on dark matter rather than stars , finding only modest @xmath57 differences in our results for radial migration .    in an effort to both measure the most physically meaningful sizes and compare our simulations to observations , we use two size measurements for each galaxy .",
    "first , we compute @xmath43 , the spherical radius that encloses 90% of the total @xmath5 .",
    "we also compute @xmath58 , the effective radius that encloses half of the ( observable ) light .",
    "we calculated @xmath58 as follows .",

    ", we also experimented with fitting sersic profiles to our galaxies , finding that they generally yield effective radii within 10% of the radii calculated above .      to test whether our results depend significantly on resolution , we analyzed two of our galaxies ( m11 and m11.2 ) simulated at 8 times lower resolution in mass . in both simulations ,",
    "the instantaneous sfr is more bursty in the lower - resolution runs , but the burstiness of the sfr averaged over 100 myr is unchanged . for both galaxies ,",
    "we find that the fractional radial migration , population gradients , and size fluctuations agree to within a few percent at both resolutions .",
    "we thus conclude that , although star formation in the fire simulations depends somewhat on resolution ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the specific processes that we study  radial migration , size fluctuation , and the effect on population gradients  do not depend significantly on resolution .",
    "we present our results in two parts .",
    "first , in this section , we examine in detail the sfh , stellar and gas kinematics , size evolution , and population gradients of a single galaxy , m10.6 , with @xmath63 ( see table  [ tab : parameters ] ) .",
    "we use this galaxy , which is representative of the mass regime in which radial migration is most significant , as a case study to explore in detail both short - timescale behavior across a single gas inflow- outflow episode and long - term trends across cosmic time .",
    "then , in section  [ sec : scaling_w_mass ] , we present results for all 8 galaxies to highlight trends with @xmath5 from @xmath64 to @xmath65 .",
    "the sfhs of our low - mass galaxies are highly stochastic , even at late cosmic times .",
    "figure  [ fig : quenched_percentage ] shows the specific star formation rate ( @xmath66 ) of m10.6 from @xmath67 to @xmath68 .",
    "we focus on late - time evolution to highlight behavior at redshifts where such low - mass galaxies currently are observable .",
    "bursty star formation ( even at late times ) is typical of our simulated galaxies near this mass @xcite .",
    "this burstiness is driven by stellar feedback , which drives gas outflows and regulates the central gas density on short timescales . following a burst of star formation ,",
    "young stars and supernovae inject energy and momentum into the ism to drive gas out into the halo , temporarily disrupting star formation .",
    "however , because most outflowing gas is not accelerated past the escape velocity at late times @xcite , it rapidly cools and re - accretes into the center of the galaxy , where the sfr rises again .",
    "figure  [ fig : quenched_percentage ] illustrates this cycle in m10.6 ; the sfr falls each time the ssfr approaches @xmath69 .",
    "these fluctuations in sfr are semi - periodic , with a typical spacing of a few 100 myr , which is comparable to the galaxy s dynamical time ( table  [ tab : parameters ] ) .",
    "as figure  [ fig : quenched_percentage ] shows , m10.6 goes through @xmath70 periods of strongly increased , then decreased , ssfr between @xmath67 and @xmath68 . even averaged over 10 and @xmath2 , the typical timescales over which observable @xmath71 and uv emission are enhanced , these reduced ssfrs briefly fall below the typical threshold of ssfr @xmath72 , where galaxies are classified as quiescent .    for the rest of this section , we focus in particular on evolution within the 400-myr burst episode at @xmath73 , as shown by the vertical dashed lines in figure  [ fig : quenched_percentage ] .",
    "the trends that we present are typical during such burst episodes for our galaxies near this mass .     to @xmath6 .",
    "different colored curves show ssfr smoothed over different timescales : 10 ( 100 ) myr approximates the timescale for significant h@xmath46 ( uv ) emission .",
    "horizontal black line shows ssfr @xmath74 , a common threshold used to define a galaxy as quiescent .",
    "the ssfr fluctuates by several orders of magnitude over @xmath75 myr .",
    "major starburst episodes , which blow much of the cold gas out into the halo and cause the ssfr to temporarily quench ( fall below the quiescence threshold ) , occur several times after @xmath67 .",
    "vertical dashed lines at @xmath76 ( @xmath73 ) enclose a single starburst episode , which we examine in detail below . ]",
    "we first examine the influence of stellar feedback and bursty star formation on the kinematics and morphology of cold gas , and its consequent influence on the kinematics and morphology of stars , during the single starburst / quenching episode highlighted in figure  [ fig : quenched_percentage ] .",
    "figure  [ fig : gas_star_distribution ] shows the surface density of neutral atomic hydrogen ( top ) , all stars ( middle ) , and young stars ( age @xmath77 ) across 8 snapshots spaced by @xmath78 .",
    "( note the change in spatial scale between the top and middle / bottom panels . ) in the first snapshot , the sfr is high and concentrated within the inner @xmath79 .",
    "stellar feedback then creates a nearly symmetric galactic wind , which drives the gas almost entirely beyond the stellar distribution : at the extremum of the outflow , the central @xmath80 are almost entirely devoid of cold gas .",
    "however , because these winds are launched below the escape velocity and the cooling time of the gas remains short @xcite , the gas soon reaccretes back into the galaxy , and another round of star formation begins .",
    "this expansion and contraction is not limited to the gas . while gas is the only species that couples directly to stellar feedback ,",
    "this low - mass galaxy is sufficiently gas - rich ( table  [ tab : parameters ] ) that the displacement of outflowing gas leads to significant fluctuations in the global galactic potential .",
    "thus , the kinematics of the ( effectively ) collisionless stars and dark matter also change as a result of feedback .",
    "figure  [ fig : gas_star_distribution ] ( middle ) shows the @xmath42-band luminosity surface density for all stars .",
    "critically , the stellar distribution expands and contracts in the same way and over the same timescale as the gas .",
    "this expansion is present both at the center , where the surface density drops significantly , and in the outskirts , where the stars expand to even larger radii .",
    "the black ellipses show the 2-d fit to @xmath40 at each snapshot , highlighting that within just @xmath81 , @xmath40 increases by more than a factor 2 .",
    "similar fluctuations occur for dark matter @xcite .",
    "figure  [ fig : gas_star_distribution ] ( bottom ) shows the @xmath42-band luminosity surface density of only stars younger than 50 myr , slightly less than the time spacing between these snapshots .",
    "this highlights the effect of stellar feedback on star - forming regions .",
    "initally , star formation occurs primarily just within the inner @xmath79 . during the outflow period ,",
    "the sfr decreases , but it does not terminate immediately : some young stars are formed in gas that is already outflowing .",
    "figure  [ fig : sfr_vs_vr ] quantifies the kinematics of both gas and stars by showing their average radial velocity ( @xmath82 ) as a function of time over 1 gyr spanning the same 400-myr period as figure  [ fig : gas_star_distribution ] . in all the following plots , averages are weighted by particle mass . the top panel shows the ssfr to highlight its correlation with gas and stellar kinematics .",
    "the middle panel shows the radial velocity of all gas ( red ) and instantaneously star - forming gas ( blue ) within @xmath83 .",
    "finally , the bottom panel shows the radial velocity of extremely young stars ( age @xmath84 , blue ) and old stars ( age @xmath85 , red ) .",
    "overall , the radial velocities of both gas and stars correlate with the ssfr remarkably closely .",
    "the ssfr reaches its peak at @xmath86 , just after gas has ( re)accreted into the center .",
    "then , just @xmath87 myr after peak ssfr , stellar feedback has driven gas to its maximum outward velocity of @xmath88 ( on average ) , at which point ssfr declines most rapidly . as the gas approaches turn - around ( @xmath89 ) and is most rarefied , the ssfr reaches its minimum .",
    "finally , as the gas starts to cool back into the galaxy , the ssfr starts to increase , and the cycle continues . during this outflow period , less than 2% of all gas",
    "is accelerated beyond the escape velocity ( @xmath90 in the center of this galaxy ) , and none of the galaxies in our sample experience significant mass loss after @xmath91 @xcite .",
    "figure  [ fig : sfr_vs_vr ] ( middle ) shows that even star - forming gas clouds participate in this inflow - outflow cycle .",
    "that is , some outflowing / infalling gas remains in dense ( @xmath92 ) , cool ( @xmath93 ) , self - bound clumps with ongoing star formation .",
    "figure  [ fig : sfr_vs_vr ] ( bottom ) shows that the radial velocity of young stars closely traces that of star - forming gas .",
    "thus , _ young stars inherit the complex inflow - outflow kinematics of the gas clouds in which they form_. furthermore , the majority of all stars in our simulated galaxies with @xmath94 form during burst episodes @xcite ; thus , a majority of stars can experience non - trivial radial migration within their first @xmath95 .",
    "figure  [ fig : sfr_vs_vr ] ( bottom ) shows a systematic time offset between the radial velocities of young and old stars .",
    "young stars ( almost by definition ) are strongly coupled to the gas clouds in which they form .",
    "stars with intermediate ages of a few 100 myr ( not shown ) start to separate kinematically from their progenitor gas clouds .",
    "importantly , _ old stars still fluctuate kinematically _ , though their fluctuations are not as strong as those of young stars or gas .",
    "the delayed response of old stars demonstrates that they do not respond directly to the kinematics of gas , but instead , respond to the change in the galactic potential when feedback drives significant gas mass beyond the stellar component .",
    "it is important to note that although gas and stars move in and out _ on average _ during the burst cycle , some particles on radial orbits do move inward during outflow periods and vice - versa . at the peak of the outflow shown in figure 3 ,",
    "approximately 87% of gas and 73% of stars have positive radial velocities , with @xmath96 we have verified that the average velocities shown in figure  [ fig : sfr_vs_vr ] are not driven primarily by high - velocity outliers ; the mean and median radial velocities typically agree within a few percent .    all together , we summarize the following two - stage physical picture for the cause of strong radial migration of stars in low - mass galaxies , where stellar feedback drives strong outflow - inflow cycles of gas :    * \\(1 ) outflowing / infalling gas clouds can remain star - forming , producing young stars that inherit the radial kinematics of their progenitor gas clouds and thus migrate significantly within their first @xmath95 . * \\(2 ) gas outflows / inflows in low - mass galaxies with high gas fractions drive strong fluctuations in the galaxies overall potentials , which in turn drive strong kinematic fluctuations in stars of all ages .",
    "these processes are fundamentally different from the processes thought to cause radial migration in massive disk galaxies , where stellar orbits are scattered via interactions with massive non - axisymmetric structures , or are stirred by spiral waves and/or bars ( for example , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) . in our low - mass galaxies ,",
    "the entire stellar distribution `` breathes '' ( expands and contracts ) due to _ global _ processes resulting from stellar feedback and bursty star formation .",
    "this , together with radial kinematics inherited from outflowing / infalling gas , is the primary driver of radial migration in our simulations . unlike the well - studied spiral",

    "we next explore how the above complex radial kinematics drive radial migration of stars over both short and long timescales .",
    "we define radial migration as any change in the galactocentric radius of a star particle since its formation .",
    "to measure radial migration since formation , we identify the first simulation snapshot that occurs immediately after the formation time of each star particle , at which point we record the particle s radius with respect to the center of the main galaxy .",
    "we then compute the radial migration as @xmath97 , the difference between the particle s current radius in a given snapshot and its radius in the snapshot immediately following its formation .    our typical time spacing between snapshots is @xmath98 .",
    "this finite time separation means that the radius that we measure after formation does not exactly equal the radius at which the particle formed , so our values are subject to some extremely short - timescale migration .",
    "we tested this by examining only star particles that formed @xmath84 before the snapshot at which we measure @xmath99 .",
    "we find no systematic difference in any of our results when examining only these particles .    to avoid ambiguity from stars that formed in different ( satellite ) galaxies that then merged with the main galaxy , we ignore star particles that formed at @xmath100 , where @xmath101 is the radius enclosing 90% of @xmath5 of the main galaxy at a given @xmath102 .",

    "star formation becomes increasingly centrally concentrated over time ; the few star particles which do form at large radius form before @xmath148 .",
    "the most dramatic effect occurs in galaxies with @xmath143 .",
    "most of these formed with intrinsically negative age gradients ( inside - out growth ) , but subsequent radial migration has inverted this underlying trend to appear to be positive ( appearance of outside - in growth ) at @xmath12 .",

    "however , most of our galaxies with @xmath143 formed with intrinsically positive ( though nearly flat ) gradients , such that more metal - rich stars formed at slightly larger radii ; migration inverted the true population gradient .",
    "there is significant variation in the extent to which radial migration alters galaxies @xmath6 population gradients , since this depends both on the total amount of migration and on the radial star formation history .",
    "galaxies with extended radial star formation at early times ( for example , m11 ) have positive intrinsic age gradients , which are altered less by migration .    in summary , radial migration can significantly and systematically bias and even invert intrinsic stellar population gradients within galaxies in the critical range of @xmath143 .",
    "this means that intrinsic population gradients observed at @xmath12 do not necessarily reflect the true gradients at formation , thus raising significant concerns for galactic - archaeology studies that aim to infer radial sfhs from stellar populations at @xmath12 .     and at the galactic center , such that @xmath147 , with radii measured at @xmath12 .",

    "however , at intermediate masses , the significant outward migration typically inverts the intrinsically negative age gradients at formation , such that they appear positive at @xmath12 .",

    "this implies that , at least for isolated galaxies at this critical range of @xmath143 , _ the observed scatter in radius at fixed @xmath5 does not simply reflect systematic differences in long - term evolutionary histories , but it also reflects the size fluctuations that individual galaxies undergo within just a few 100 myr_.    in the critical mass range , the scatter in the radii of observed galaxies is consistent with being driven primarily by short - timescale fluctuations .",

    "@xcite studied a simulated galaxies with @xmath171 and found that , between @xmath172 and @xmath173 , highly localized and episodic stellar feedback drove rapid gas flows that in turn drove stellar kinematics in the central @xmath174 .",
    "this caused stars that formed in the central regions to migrate outward significantly .",
    "however , they found that migration became significantly less efficient by @xmath173 and predicted that it would become negligible at late times .",
    "similarly , @xcite found significant radial migration in the oldest stellar populations of simulated galaxies with @xmath175 , suggesting that radial migration , rather than accretion events , might be responsible for the creation of the stellar halo .",
    "consistent with this result , figure  [ fig : all_migration ] showed that the oldest stars ( @xmath121 ) in m10.6 have migrated outward an average of @xmath122 , or @xmath123 , from the radius where they formed ; many of these stars likely would be classified as part of the stellar halo .",
    "finally , @xcite recently studied the origin of observed population gradients in simulated dwarf galaxies using the clues cosmological zoom - in simulation of a local group analogue .",
    "they found that the observed positive gradients of stellar age with radius in dwarf galaxies can be generated via major mergers , which heat old stellar populations and trigger new bursts of centrally concentrated star formation .",
    "our results are consistent with this possibility ; however , the low - mass galaxies that we study have relatively calm merger histories , and despite this , almost all of them form positive age gradients . thus ,",
    "our results imply that positive gradients in stellar age can form even in the absence of late - time mergers , via stellar feedback and bursty star formation .",
    "low - mass galaxies in the local universe exhibit significant scatter in their sfrs , consistent with high variability on short timescales , and many show evidence for multiple episodes of star formation separated by periods of quiescence ranging from a few 10 s of myr to several gyr .",
    "most of these star - forming galaxies are relatively isolated at @xmath12 , indicating that starbursts are triggered not just by interactions .",
    "@xcite found that @xmath176 percent of @xmath177 galaxies in the local volume are currently undergoing a starburst .",
    "@xcite used @xmath71-to-@xmath178 flux ratios to constrain bursty star formation in 185 galaxies , finding that low - mass galaxies are best described by sfhs with burst amplitudes of @xmath179 and interburst spacings of @xmath180 @xcite compared galaxies from the fire simulations to observations using the same @xmath71-to-@xmath178 ratios and found that burst spacings and amplitudes from the simulations were broadly consistent with observationally - inferred values , though the fire simulations may somewhat overpredict burst amplitudes at lower masses .",
    "almost all low - mass galaxies in the local universe have negative metallicity gradients .",
    "several studies ( for example , * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) find an average metallicity gradient of @xmath181\\sim -0.4\\,dex}$ ] between the galactic center and the effective radius , but with significant ( @xmath182 ) scatter even for galaxies with similar morphologies and sfhs .",
    "these negative metallicity gradients are broadly consistent with our results ( see ma et al .",
    ", in prep . , for more details ) .",
    "figure  [ fig : gradients_vs_m_star ] shows that in our simulations , radial migration plays a critical role in establishing these gradients : without migration , the age and metallicity gradients of galaxies with @xmath183 would be nearly 0 .",
    "using the fire suite of cosmological zoom - in hydrodynamic simulations of isolated low - mass galaxies across @xmath184 , we have explored the effects of stellar feedback and bursty star formation on stellar kinematics , radial migration , size evolution , and population gradients at late cosmic times , where such low - mass galaxies are observable . in galaxies with @xmath143 ,",
    "stellar feedback frequently drives outflows of significant gas mass well beyond the stellar radius ; these cool and fall back into the galaxy center on timescales of a few 100 myr . these outflow / infall cycles occur semi - periodically many times throughout these galaxies evolutionary histories and drive strong fluctuations in the galactic potential , leading to dramatic effects on the stellar population .",
    "we summarize our main results as follows .    1",
    ".   _ physical origin of stellar migration _ : stars in low - mass galaxies experience significant radial migration via two related processes .",
    "first , outflowing / inflowing gas clouds can remain star - forming , producing young stars that inherit the outflowing / infalling kinematics of gas .",
    "second , gas outflows / inflows drive strong fluctuations in the overall galactic potential , and in response , the orbits of stars of all ages expand and contract over short timescales and gradually are heated over long timescales .",
    "these physical processes are fundamentally different from the scattering processes known to cause radial migration in massive disk galaxies",
    "_ timescales of stellar migration _ :",
    "stellar radial migration occurs over both short ( a few 100 myr ) and long ( a few gyr ) timescales .",
    "short - timescale fluctuations in the potential result in rapid changes in kinematics and radial migration for all stars within a few 100 myr , comparable to the galaxy s dynamical time .",
    "young stars experience the strongest short - timescale migration , typically @xmath185 within their first @xmath119 , because they are most tightly coupled to gas kinematics , but even old stars migrate significantly on short timescales .",
    "short - timescale migration , however , is nearly reversible .",
    "on the other hand , the _ cumulative _ effects of many repeated semi - periodic fluctuations gradually heat stellar orbits , driving _ permanent _ and coherent outward migration of stars over gyr timescales .",
    "thus , the amount of stellar migration depends on stellar age : the oldest stars , having experienced the most outflow / inflow cycles , exhibit the strongest systematic outward migration since formation .",
    "impact on radial gradients of stellar populations _ : stellar migration can systematically change radial gradients of stellar age and metallicity because the amount of outward migration depends on stellar age . for almost all of our galaxies at @xmath143 , stellar migration inverts true underlying age gradients from negative to positive , or metallicity gradients from positive to negative , by @xmath12 .",
    "this means that population gradients observed at @xmath12 do not necessarily reflect the intrinsic gradients at formation , and that radial sfhs inferred from present - day populations gradients , as common in galactic - archaeology studies , may be significantly biased .",
    "_ fluctuations of galaxy sizes _ : our simulations produce consistent half - light radii ( @xmath58 ) of galaxies as compared with observations .",
    "short - term stellar migration leads to fluctuations in effective radius by factors of @xmath149 within just a few 100 myr .",
    "these fluctuations are comparable to the observed scatter in @xmath58 at fixed @xmath5 , which suggests that the observed scatter does not just reflect systematic differences in long - term evolutionary histories , but it also reflects the size fluctuations that individual galaxies undergo within just a few 100 myr .",
    "dependence on galaxy mass _ : all of these effects are strongest in galaxies with @xmath186 ( halo @xmath187 ) .",
    "this is the same mass range where stellar feedback has been shown to most efficiently produce dark matter cores .",
    "since migration and coring are driven by the same physical processes , galaxies with significant feedback - driven cores also should have experienced significant stellar migration .",
    "although galaxies with lower mass also experience similarly bursty sfhs , their higher dark - matter fractions and lower overall sfrs ( in particular , low @xmath188 ) lead to weaker fluctuations in the galactic potential , with weak effects on stellar kinematics and radial migration .",
    "more massive galaxies have deeper potential wells and lower gas fractions within @xmath58 , so they do not experience strong coherent fluctuations in stellar kinematics .",
    "_ stellar kinematics provide a strong test to constrain feedback models _ :",
    "our stellar feedback models predict strong effects on stellar kinematics and sizes of low - mass galaxies .",
    "if stellar feedback drives dark - matter coring , galaxies with large cores also should have experienced significant stellar migration .",
    "detailed studies of nearby dwarf galaxies , with resolved spectroscopy and/or proper motions of individual stars , therefore can provide strong tests of our model predictions , as we outline below .",
    "we have shown that stellar feedback can cause dramatic changes in the radial kinematics and distribution of stars in isolated galaxies with @xmath143 .",
    "these effects are analogous to feedback - driven coring of such galaxies dark - matter profiles , as explored in previous works . because the distribution and kinematics of stars ( and gas ) are more directly observable than ( inferred ) dark - matter mass profiles , our results imply that detailed observations of resolved stellar populations and kinematics , which are obtainable for nearby galaxies , can provide strong tests of stellar feedback models .",
    "we outline a few possible observational tests , which we will investigate in more detail in future work",
    ".    _ biased stellar kinematics _ : figure  [ fig : sfr_vs_vr ] ( bottom ) showed that because young stars inherit the kinematics of outflowing / infalling gas from which they form , young stars can have biased kinematics as compared with older stars .",
    "in addition , figure  [ fig : sfr_vs_vr ] suggested that the observed radial velocity ( or line - of - sight velocity dispersion ) should be higher in actively star - forming galaxies than in post - starburst galaxies with extended outflows .",
    "indeed , we find that the velocity dispersion falls by @xmath189 during outflow periods , when stars are more weakly bound .",
    "finally , at any stage of evolution , our results suggest that the orbits of stars in low - mass galaxies may be strongly anisotropic , in particular , strongly radially biased .    _ gas outflows _ : figure  [ fig : gas_star_distribution ] showed that significant neutral gas is blown beyond the outskirts of the stellar distribution following starburst episodes .",
    "first , these outflows should be observable directly in nearby post - starburst galaxies .",
    "several of the late - time outflows in m10.6 , m11 , m11v , and m11.2 carry more than @xmath190 of neutral hydrogen beyond @xmath43 , which is at least @xmath191 more than the lower limits of resolved hi interferometric observations of nearby galaxies @xcite .",
    "second , one could compare the short - timescale fluctuations in hi mass in our simulated galaxies over a single starburst cycle to the scatter in observed hi mass at fixed @xmath5 ( see , for example , * ? ? ?",
    "_ relation between population gradients and cores _ : figure  [ fig : gradients_vs_m_star ] showed that stellar feedback dramatically can affect and even invert age and metallicity radial gradients in low - mass galaxies .",
    "although our simulated galaxies experience inside - out growth , radial migration erases or inverts these population gradients because old stars migrate outward more than young stars . because the physical processes responsible for stellar migration are the same processes that produce dark matter cores , our results appear to imply that , at fixed @xmath5 , galaxies with stronger cores will have more positive age gradients and more negative metallicity gradients than those with cusps or weaker cores . however , a larger suite of simulations , with a greater diversity of late - time population gradients , is needed to make this prediction concrete , since all the low - mass galaxies we study here develop both positive age gradients and strong dark matter cores .",
    "_ stellar halos of low - mass galaxies _ : figure  [ fig : all_migration ] showed that the oldest stars ( @xmath121 ) in m10.6 have migrated outward the most , an average of @xmath122 , or @xmath192 , from where they formed , and figure  [ fig : now_formation ] showed that the oldest stars ( on average ) are at the largest radii at @xmath12 .",
    "many of these oldest stars migrated sufficiently far that they likely would be classified as part of the stellar halo .",
    "thus , our results suggest that the stellar halos of such galaxies may provide observational probes of the earliest stars that formed near the core , as has also been suggested by studies that find radial migration at high redshift @xcite .",
    "our analysis represents an early examination into stellar kinematics and radial migration in low - mass galaxies .",
    "these results motivate more comprehensive theoretical studies , with larger simulation samples , to delineate further the dependence on mass and formation history , as well as the scatter across populations .",
