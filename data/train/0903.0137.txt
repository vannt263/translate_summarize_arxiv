    "various clustering procedures play a crucial role in bioinformatics , in particular , genetics , see , e.g. , @xcite or @xcite .",
    "an important class of such procedures is based on introduction of various metrics on the space information strings , see e.g. @xcite .",
    "a metric with new interesting features was recently used in theoretical physics ( from string theory to theory of disordered systems , spin glasses ) , see e.g. @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite in cognitive science , psychology and image analysis @xcite .",
    "this is so called @xmath4adic metric ( in fact , a class of metrics depending on the parameter @xmath4  a prime number ) .",
    "the main distinguishing feature of this metric is its sensitivity to hierarchic patterns in information having a special structure matching with @xmath4adic encoding of information .",
    "a few years ago 2adic metric was applied to study the problem of degeneration of the genetic code , see @xcite .",
    "these @xmath4adic models can be considered as new development in the approach to investigation of the structure of the genetic code from the point of view of coding theory , see @xcite .    in the present paper",
    "we discuss the structure of the pam matrix used in bioinformatics ( see for example @xcite ) from the point of view of @xmath4adic analysis .",
    "we use the 2adic parametrization of the genetic ( amino acid ) code obtained in @xcite ( see also @xcite for the different @xmath4adic parametrization ) .    in @xcite",
    "it was shown that , after some special parametrization of the space of codons ( triples of nucleotides ) the genetic code becomes a locally constant map of @xmath4adic argument .",
    "moreover , the degeneracy of the genetic code in this language takes the form of local constancy of the corresponding mapping .",
    "let us also mention the application of the @xmath4adic parametrization to the description of the parisi matrix from the replica symmetry breaking approach to spin glasses @xcite .",
    "after the @xmath4adic parametrization of the numbers of the lines and the columns the parisi matrix becomes a locally constant block matrix .",
    "it is natural to check , using the @xmath4adic parametrization approach , the structure of the pam matrix .",
    "the pam matrix is used in bioinformatics for sequence alignment and is constructed using a markov chain model of point mutations for a protein chain .",
    "we assume that the structure of the pam matrix has some relation to the structure of the genetic code .",
    "using this idea we enumerate the lines and the columns of the pam matrix using the 2adic parametrization of the genetic code .",
    "after this parametrization the pam matrix becomes more regular , namely , the dependence of the matrix elements @xmath5 of the pam matrix on the indices @xmath6 and @xmath7 is close to locally constant with respect to the 2adic norm for the majority of matrix elements .",
    "we have some exceptions from this rule .",
    "it is easy to see that these exceptions are related to several amino acids , namely to y , w , c , f , l. in order to describe this deviations from 2adicity we introduce the following construction : we expand ( by hands ) the pam matrix into the sum of the two matrices @xmath8 the matrix in this expansion @xmath2 is 2adically regular ( close to locally constant ) .",
    "the matrix @xmath3 is sparse ( the majority of matrix elements are zero , non zero matrix elements are mainly concentrated of the lines and columns related to the amino acids y , w , c , f , l ) .",
    "one can see that the deviations from 2adicity ( i.e. non  zero matrix elements of @xmath3 ) are related to amino acids which are in some sense special  to the aromatic amino acids y , w , f , and to cysteine c which contains the sh group .",
    "we also mention that the 2adic structure of the genetic code is related to some chemical properties of the amino acids .",
    "in particular , hydrophobic amino acids are clustered in two ball with respect to the 2adic norm .",
    "therefore the 2adic parametrization allows to separate the impact of the chemical and geometrical properties of aromatic amino acids for the structure of the pam matrix .",
    "the structure of the present paper is the following .",
    "in section 2 we discuss some family of ultrametric spaces .    in section 3",
    "we describe the 2adic 2dimensional parametrization of the genetic code of @xcite .",
    "in section 4 we put the pam250 matrix .    in section 5",
    "we describe the reshuffling of the lines and the columns of the pam matrix , corresponding to the 2adic parametrization of the genetic code of section 2 .    in section 6",
    "we introduce the expansion of the pam matrix into the sum of the two matrices , one of which is 2adically regular ( close to locally constant ) and the other is sparse ( majority of matrix elements are equal to zero ) .",
    "sections 7 and 8 are appendices where the definitions of pam matrices and the eucaryotic genetic code are exposed .",
    "an _ ultrametric space _ is a metric space where the metric @xmath9 satisfies the strong triangle inequality : @xmath10 the strong triangle inequality can be stated geometrically : _ each side of a triangle is at most as long as the longest one of the two other sides .",
    "_ such a triangle is quite restricted when considered in the ordinary euclidean space  it is _ isosceles , _ i.e. , @xmath11 or @xmath12 or @xmath13    an ultrametric space is a natural mathematical object for description of a _ hierarchical system . _ on ultrametric spaces there exist many locally constant functions , i.e. , functions which are constant on some vicinity of any point , but not necessarily constant on the whole space .",
    "in particular , we show that the genetic code can be considered as a locally constant map on a specially designed ultrametric space , so called 2-adic plane , see @xcite .",
    "let @xmath14 be an ultrametric space .",
    "we consider balls @xmath15 so , @xmath16 is the center of the ball @xmath17 having radius @xmath18 we mention a few unusual ( from the viewpoint of usual euclidean geometry ) properties of ultrametric balls :    a ) . each point of @xmath17 can be chosen as its center .",
    "so , inside a ball all points have  equal rights  .",
    "b ) . any two balls either do not intersect or one of the balls contains the other ball . in this framework ,",
    "clustering into _ disjoint balls _ is a very natural operation .",
    "we remark that ultrametric spaces were widely used in bioinformatics , see @xcite .",
    "however , in this paper we plan to elaborate new applications of ultrametric spaces to biology ( genetics ) which are different from mentioned ones .",
    "we are interested in the following special class of ultrametric spaces @xmath19 every point @xmath20 is the infinite sequence of digits @xmath21 each digit yields the finite number of values , @xmath22 where @xmath23 is a natural number , the base of the alphabet @xmath24 .",
    "if the sequence @xmath25 contains only finite number of non - zero terms @xmath26 , then we can consider @xmath20 as the natural number @xmath27 moreover , this formula defines the one to one correspondence between natural numbers ( with zero ) and the space of final sequences @xmath28 .",
    "we denote the space of sequences ( [ k ] ) , ( [ k1 ] ) by the symbol @xmath29 .",
    "ultrametric is introduced on this set in the following way . for two points",
    "@xmath30 we set @xmath31 the ultrametric space @xmath32 is called the space of @xmath33-adic integers .    the ultrametric @xmath34 describes the following hierarchical structure .",
    "if @xmath35 , @xmath36 , is a vector encoding information on some object , then digits @xmath37 have different weights .",
    "the digit @xmath38 is the most important , @xmath39 dominates over @xmath40 and so on .",
    "such hierarchic information vectors can be created by living systems , e.g. , by the brain to process information .",
    "applications of @xmath33-adic numbers to information theory and , in particular , to description of cognitive processes and complex social systems were developed in @xcite .    in applications",
    "we will use not only  one dimensional ",
    "@xmath33-adic spaces , but also cartesian products of a few spaces , e.g. , @xmath33-adic plane @xmath41 and so on .",
    "our aim is to show that 2-adic plane structure was embedded in the genetic code , see @xcite .",
    "we remark that @xmath33-adic numbers for @xmath42 , where @xmath4 is a prime number were intensively used ( during last 20 years ) in mathematical physics @xcite .",
    "the number theoretic definition is as follows .",
    "let us fix a prime number @xmath43 .",
    "for example , fix @xmath44 or fix @xmath45 .",
    "the example of ultrametric space is the field of @xmath4-adic numbers @xmath46 which is the completion of the field of rational numbers with respect to @xmath4-adic norm @xmath47 , defined as follows : for a rational number @xmath48 where @xmath49 and @xmath33 , @xmath50 are non - zero and are not divisible by @xmath4 , its @xmath4-adic norm is @xmath51 @xmath4-adic norm is widely used in number theory and algebraic geometry .",
    "if a rational number is divisible by @xmath52 , where @xmath53 is very large , then its @xmath4-adic norm is very small .",
    "this hierarchy of the degrees of @xmath4 ( i.e. of values of the @xmath4adic norm ) gives the hierarchical ( ultrametric ) structure of the @xmath4adic norm .",
    "@xmath4-adic numbers are in one to one correspondence with the series @xmath54 where @xmath53 is integer and @xmath55 ( this expansion is the analogue of ( [ madic ] ) ) .",
    "the unit ball in @xmath56 with center at @xmath57 zero coincides with the space of @xmath4-adic integers @xmath58 .",
    "@xmath4-adic numbers were actively used ( since pioneer papers of i.volovich , @xcite ) in high energy physics ( superstring theory , cosmology ) and theory of disordered systems ( spin glasses ) , see , e.g. , review @xcite and the book @xcite .",
    "in the 2adic parametrization approach of @xcite we enumerate in some special way the set of 64 codons ( triples of nucleotides ) by pairs of digits @xmath59 , @xmath60 .",
    "these digits are in one to one correspondence with the triples @xmath61 and @xmath62 of 0 and 1 ( the expansions of @xmath20 and @xmath63 over degrees of 2 ) : @xmath64 2adic norm of @xmath20 is equal to @xmath65 , where @xmath6 is the number of the first non zero @xmath66 in the above expansion ( analogously for @xmath63 ) .",
    "each pair of digits @xmath67 is defined by a nucleotide using the rule @xmath68 since the nucleotides @xmath69 and @xmath70 are purines , @xmath71 and @xmath72 are pyrimidines , the different first digits in the above binary representation corresponds to the different chemical types of the nucleotides .",
    "namely , the nucleotide @xmath59 with @xmath73 is a purine , and the nucleotide @xmath59 with @xmath74 is a pyrimidine .",
    "the second digit @xmath75 in the considered parametrization describes the @xmath76bonding character ( weak for @xmath77 and strong for @xmath78 ) .    using the above correspondence between the nucleotides and the digits 0 and 1 , we introduce the correspondence between the codons ( triples of nucleotides ) and the triples @xmath61 and @xmath62 of 0 and 1 ( equivalently , the corresponding @xmath60 ) by the following prescription .",
    "the second nucleotide in the codon defines the pair @xmath79 , the first nucleotide in the codon defines the pair @xmath80 , and the third nucleotide in the codon defines the pair @xmath81 .",
    "this rule is related to the following hierarchy of nucleotides in the codon @xmath82 i.e the second nucleotide in the codon is the most important ( and the largest in the 2adic norm ) and the third nucleotide is the least important .",
    "after that we make the special reshuffling of the values of @xmath20 and @xmath63 : @xmath83 similar to made in @xcite .    then we enumerate codons using the described above rule .",
    "namely we put the codons in the table @xmath84 with the natural 2adic norm ( here the numbers of the lines and columns are @xmath20 and @xmath63 defined above ) : @xmath85    the @xmath86 quadrates here are 2dimensional 2adic balls ( or clusters ) of the diameter @xmath87 .",
    "after application of the eucaryotic genetic ( amino acid ) code ( described in the appendix ) to the above table we get the table of amino acids on the 2adic plane @xmath88 where ter is the stop codon .",
    "each square in the above table is the 2 by 2 square in the 2-adic plane of codons .",
    "in particular , the genetic code map acts as follows on the 2adic balls @xmath89 here we use the standard notations for the nucleotides a , u , g , c and the amino acids .",
    "we see , that the degeneracy of the genetic code in the above 2-adic parametrization is described by the 2-adic proximity  the codons which encode the same amino acid are 2-adically close . moreover , the domains with the different degeneracy are symmetric at the 2-adic plane  the lower right half of the plane is occupied by amino acids with the degeneracy four , and the upper left half of the plane contains the amino acids with the degeneracy mainly equal to two .",
    "we also have the five cases of additional degeneracy which is not described by the 2-adic parametrization .",
    "the described here 2-adic 2-dimensional parametrization of the genetic code is related to physical  chemical properties of the amino acids .",
    "namely , the hydrophobic amino acids are clustered in the following two 2-adic balls in the 2-adic plane : @xmath90    here the hydrophobic amino acids are listed according to the book @xcite .    using the 2-adic parametrization of the genetic code we can divide all the set of amino acid in the groups @xmath91k , n , e , d , y , q , h@xmath92 , @xmath91r , g , w , c@xmath92 , @xmath91i , m , v , l , f@xmath92 , @xmath91 t , a , s , p@xmath92 .",
    "these groups are the images with respect to the map of the genetic code of the four quadrants ( 2adic balls of the diameter @xmath93 ) of the 2adic plane of codons .",
    "the following table describes the pam250 matrix :    @xmath94    because the matrix @xmath0 is symmetrical we put only the half of matrix elements . this matrix looks irregular and has no any obvious structure . in the next section",
    "we will show that some reshuffling of the numbers of the lines and columns will put this matrix in more regular form .",
    "let us enumerate the lines and the columns of the pam matrix @xmath0 of the previous section using the 2adic parametrization of the genetic code .",
    "we get for @xmath0 the following : @xmath95    here we divided all the set of amino acids to the groups @xmath91k , n , e , d , y , q , h@xmath92 , @xmath91r , g , w , c@xmath92 , @xmath91i , m , v , l , f@xmath92 , @xmath91 t , a , s , p@xmath92 .",
    "these four groups correspond to the second nucleotide in the codons which encode ( through the amino acid genetic code ) amino acids in the corresponding group .",
    "namely , the first group correspond to the codons with a ( adenine ) at the second position , the second group correspond to the codons with g ( guanine ) , the third group correspond to the codons with u ( uracil ) , and the fourth group correspond to the codons with c ( cytosine ) .    compared to the pam matrix from the previous section ,",
    "this reshuffled matrix is more regular .",
    "it has large positive matrix elements at the main diagonal , and off diagonal terms are close to block constant at least at some of the 16 blocks , corresponding to matrix elements with the indices from one of the 4 groups of amino acids .",
    "in particular , in the block corresponding to the matrix elements @xmath5 , @xmath96 t , a , s , p@xmath92 , all off diagonal matrix elements are equal to 1 ( 10 matrix elements ) or 0 ( 2 matrix elements ) .    in the block @xmath5 , @xmath97k , n , e , d , y , q , h@xmath92 , @xmath98 t , a , s , p@xmath92 we have matrix elements equal to 0 ( 13 matrix elements ) , @xmath99 ( 10 matrix elements )",
    ", 1 ( 1 matrix element ) and anomalous matrix elements equal to @xmath100 and @xmath101 corresponding to the amino acid y. the analogous situation we will have in the other blocks of the matrix @xmath0 .",
    "we arrive to the following picture : the pam matrix @xmath0 will be a block matrix with matrix elements close to locally constant ( i.e. constant in the 16 blocks ) if we will exclude matrix elements corresponding to some amino acids , namely , to the amino acids y , w , c , l , f , and r.",
    "in the present section we introduce the main construction of this paper : we will expand the pam matrix @xmath0 in the sum of the matrices @xmath2 and @xmath3 : @xmath102 where the matrix @xmath2 will be 2adically regular ( matrix elements are close to locally constant ) , and the matrix @xmath3 will be sparse ( i.e. majority of matrix elements of this matrix will be equal to zero ) .",
    "we propose the following choice for matrices @xmath2 and @xmath3 .",
    "@xmath103    @xmath104    non zero matrix elements of @xmath3 are mainly concentrated on the lines and columns corresponding to y , w , c , l , f. there are also several non ",
    "zero matrix elements corresponding to r and some other amino acids .",
    "we see that the non zero matrix elements of @xmath3 are mainly concentrated on aromatic amino acids , such as y , f , w , and on c which contains the sh group .",
    "therefore deviations from 2adic regularity ( i.e. the block structure of the @xmath2 matrix ) can be discussed as related to the geometric properties of the side chains of amino acids ( for aromatic amino acids y , f , w , and for arginine r ) , and to the ability of cysteine c to create a disulfide bond .",
    "the above pictures show the amino acids w , r , c , f , y corresponding to non - zero matrix elements of the matrix @xmath3 .",
    "let us mention that amino acids f and y for which the corresponding matrix element @xmath105 is very large ( and majority of the other matrix elements of @xmath3 for these amino acids are negative ) are very similar from the point of view of geometry .",
    "of course , our analysis of pam matrix based on the 2-adic plane representation of the genetic code is only the first step in using @xmath4-adic numbers in genetics and bioinformatics in general .",
    "we hope to proceed towards other important problems , cf . , e.g. , @xcite @xcite , @xcite .",
    "finally , we mention the famous `` in silico biology '' project , see , e.g. , yamato et al .",
    "we point out that , in fact , operation of any computer can be represented as 2-adic dynamical system , see @xcite , @xcite .",
    "therefore 2-adic representation of the genetic code might be useful in realization of the `` in silico biology '' project .",
    "in this section we discuss the construction of the dayhoff pam matrix , which can be found for example in @xcite .",
    "we start with blocks  ungapped multiple alignments of proteins from existing databases .",
    "any sequence in the block is no more than @xmath106 different from any other sequence in this block .",
    "then , the markov model , which reproduces the mentioned blocks of proteins was constructed .",
    "this markov model is defined by the amino acid substitutions ( point mutations ) .",
    "we have the stationary distribution @xmath107 of the probabilities of the amino acids , @xmath108 , and the transition probability @xmath109 , normalized by the condition that the probability of a point mutation ( substitution of the amino acid ) at one step of the markov model is equal to @xmath110 : @xmath111    then we take the matrix given by the @xmath50 steps of the markov model , i.e. the @xmath50-th degree @xmath112 of the matrix @xmath113 , and consider the matrix with the matrix elements @xmath114 this matrix is known as the pam matrix ( usually @xmath50 is taken to be equal to 250 and the matrix elements are approximated by integers ) .",
