    "_ steganography _ is a scientific discipline within the field known as _ data hiding _ ,",
    "concerned with hiding information into a commonly used media , in such a way that no one apart from the sender and the intended recipient can detect the presence of embedded data .",
    "a comprehensive overview of the core principles and the mathematical methods that can be used for data hiding can be found in @xcite .",
    "an interesting steganographic method is known as _ matrix encoding _ , introduced by crandall  @xcite and analyzed by bierbrauer et al .",
    "matrix encoding requires the sender and the recipient to agree in advance on a parity check matrix @xmath2 , and the secret message is then extracted by the recipient as the syndrome ( with respect to @xmath2 ) of the received cover object .",
    "this method was made popular by westfeld  @xcite , who incorporated a specific implementation using hamming codes in his f5 algorithm , which can embed @xmath3 bits of message in @xmath4 cover symbols by changing , at most , one of them .",
    "there are two parameters which help to evaluate the performance of a steganographic method over a cover message of @xmath5 symbols : the _ average distortion _",
    "@xmath6 , where @xmath7 is the expected number of changes over uniformly distributed messages ; and the _ embedding rate _",
    "@xmath8 , which is the amount of bits that can be hidden in a cover message . in general , for the same embedding rate a method is better when the average distortion is smaller . following the terminology used by fridrich et al .",
    "@xcite , the pair @xmath9 will be called _",
    "@xmath10-rate_.    furthermore , as willems et al . in  @xcite",
    ", we will also assume that a discrete source produces a sequence @xmath11 , where @xmath5 is the block length , each @xmath12 , and @xmath13 depends on whether the source is a grayscale digital image , or a cd audio , etc .",
    "the message @xmath14 we want to hide into a host sequence @xmath15 produces a composite sequence @xmath16 , where @xmath17 and each @xmath18 .",
    "the composite sequence @xmath19 is obtained from distorting @xmath15 , and the distortion will be assumed to be a squared - error distortion ( see  @xcite ) . in these conditions , if information is only carried by the least significant bit ( lsb ) of each @xmath20 , the appropriate solution comes from using binary hamming codes  @xcite , improved using product hamming codes  @xcite . for larger magnitude of changes , but limited to @xmath21 , that is , @xmath22 , where @xmath23 , the situation is called ",
    "@xmath1-steganography \" , and the information is carried by the two least significant bits .",
    "it is known that the embedding becomes statistically detectable rather quickly with the increasing amplitude of embedding changes .",
    "therefore , our interest goes to avoid changes of amplitude greater than one . with this assumption ,",
    "our steganographic scheme will be compared with the upper bound from  @xcite for the embedding rate in  @xmath1-steganography \" , given by @xmath24 , where @xmath25 is the binary entropy function @xmath26 and @xmath27 is the average distortion .",
    "a main purpose of steganography is designing schemes in order to approach this upper bound .    in most of the previous papers , ",
    "@xmath1-steganography \" has involved a ternary coding problem .",
    "willems et al .",
    "@xcite proposed a schemed based on ternary hamming and golay codes , which were proved to be optimal .",
    "fridrich and lisonk  @xcite proposed a method based on rainbow colouring graphs which , for some values , outperformed the scheme obtained by direct sum of ternary hamming codes with the same average distortion .",
    "however , both methods from  @xcite and  @xcite show a problem when dealing with extreme grayscale values , since they suggest making a change of magnitude greater than one in order to avoid having to apply the change @xmath28 and @xmath29 to a host sequence of value @xmath30 and @xmath31 , respectively .",
    "note that the kind of change they propose would obviously introduce larger distortion and therefore make the embedding more statistically detectable .    in this paper",
    "we also consider the @xmath1-steganography .",
    "our new method is based on perfect @xmath0-linear codes which , although they are not linear , they have a representation using a parity check matrix that makes them as efficient as the hamming codes .",
    "as we will show , this new method not only performs better than the one obtained by direct sum of ternary hamming codes from  @xcite , but it also deals better with the extreme grayscale values , because the magnitude of embedding changes is under no circumstances greater than one .    to make this paper self - contained , we review in section  [ sec : additivecodes ] a few elementary concepts on perfect @xmath0-linear codes , relevant for our study .",
    "the new steganographic method is presented in section  [ sec : stegoz2z4 ] , whereas an improvement to better deal with the extreme grayscale values problem is given in section  [ sec : anomalies ] .",
    "finally , the paper is concluded in section  [ sec : conclusions ] .",
    "in general , any non - empty subgroup @xmath32 of @xmath33 is a _ @xmath0-additive code _ , where @xmath34 denotes the set of all binary vectors of length @xmath35 and @xmath36 is the set of all @xmath37-tuples in @xmath38 .",

    "the _ @xmath52-additive dual code _ of @xmath32 , denoted by @xmath53 , is defined as the set of vectors in @xmath33 that are orthogonal to every codeword in @xmath32 , being the definition of inner product in @xmath54 the following : @xmath55 where @xmath56 and computations are made considering the zeros and ones in the @xmath35 binary coordinates as quaternary zeros and ones , respectively .",
    "the binary code @xmath57 , of length @xmath58 , is called the _ @xmath52-dual code _ of @xmath51 .",

    "the above result is due to  @xcite and it allows us to write the parity check matrix @xmath2 of any @xmath0-additive perfect code for a given value of @xmath61 .",
    "matrix @xmath2 can be represented taking all possible vectors in @xmath68 , up to sign changes , as columns . in this representation , there are @xmath35 columns which correspond to the binary part of vectors in @xmath32 , and @xmath37 columns of order four which correspond to the quaternary part .",
    "we agree on a representation of the @xmath35 binary coordinates as coordinates in @xmath69 .",
    "take a perfect @xmath0-linear code and consider its @xmath0-dual , which is of type @xmath50 . as stated in the previous section , this gives us a parity check matrix @xmath2 which has @xmath70 rows of order two and @xmath61 rows of order four .",

    "note that a problem may crop up at this point when we need to add @xmath21 to a symbol @xmath20 of value @xmath121 or , likewise , when @xmath20 has value @xmath122 and we need to subtract @xmath21 from it .",
    "3 .   if @xmath80 is one of the last @xmath37 columns in @xmath2 we can see that this situation corresponds to add @xmath123 to @xmath124 . note that because we are using a @xmath0-additive perfect code , @xmath112 will never be @xmath125 .",
    "hence , the embedder should add ( @xmath116 ) or subtract ( @xmath126 ) one unit to / from symbol @xmath124 .",
    "once again , a problem may arise with the extreme grayscale values .",

    "as already mentioned at the beginning of this paper , the problematic cases related to the extreme grayscale values are also present in the methods from @xcite and @xcite , but their authors assume that the probability of gray value saturation is not too large . we argue that , though rare , this gray saturation can still occur . however , in order to compare our proposal with these others we will not consider these problems either until the next section .",
    "therefore , we proceed to compute the values of the average distortion @xmath139 and the embedding rate @xmath140 .",
    "our method is able to hide any secret vector @xmath109 @xmath62 @xmath47 into the given @xmath5 symbols .",
    "hence , the embedding rate is @xmath141 bits per @xmath5 symbols , @xmath142 .",

    "hence , @xmath149 .",
    "the described method has a @xmath10-rate @xmath150 , where @xmath144 and @xmath151 is any integer @xmath60 .",

    "convex combinations of @xmath10-rates of two codes related to their direct sum are extensively treated in  @xcite .",
    "actually , it is possible to choose the @xmath139 coordinate and cover more @xmath10-rates by taking convex combinations .",
    "therefore , if @xmath139 is a non - allowable parameter for the average distortion we can still take @xmath152 , where @xmath153 are two contiguous allowable parameters , and by means of the direct sum of the two codes with embedding rate @xmath154 and @xmath155 , respectively , we can obtain a new @xmath10-rate @xmath9 , with @xmath156 and @xmath157 . from  a graphic point of view , this is equivalent to draw a line between two contiguous points @xmath158 and @xmath159 , as it is shown in  [ fig : graphicwoanom ] .",
