    "<S> the low - lying collective states in sn isotopes are studied by a five - dimensional collective hamiltonian with parameters determined from the triaxial relativistic mean - field calculations using the pc - pk1 energy density functional . </S>",
    "<S> the systematics for both the excitation energies of @xmath0 states and @xmath1 values are reproduced rather well , in particular , the enhanced @xmath2 transitions in the neutron - deficient sn isotopes with @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> we show that the gradual degeneracy of neutron levels @xmath4 and @xmath5 around the fermi surface leads to the increase of level density and consequently the enhanced paring correlations from @xmath6 to @xmath7 . </S>",
    "<S> it provokes a large quadrupole shape fluctuation around the spherical shape , and leads to an enhanced collectivity in the isotopes around @xmath8 .    </S>",
    "<S> covariant energy density functional , collective hamiltonian , low - lying states , electromagnetic transition , sn isotopes    21.60.jz , 21.60.ev , 21.10.re , 21.10.tg    the evolution of shell structure and nuclear collectivity along either isotopic or isotonic chains , inferred from the systematics of the nuclear deformation energy surface  @xcite , the nucleon separation energy  @xcite , the excitation energy of low - lying state and the electric quadrupole transition strength  @xcite , becomes of great interest in nuclear physics . in recent years </S>",
    "<S> , a number of experiments have measured the @xmath9 transition strengths in neutron - deficient sn isotopes with @xmath3  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the deduced @xmath10 value increases when going from @xmath6 to @xmath11 , and then remains roughly constant within the experimental uncertainties when decreasing the neutron number down to @xmath12 . </S>",
    "<S> this picture deviates from the parabolic trend , with a peak at mid - shell , predicted by the single @xmath13-shell seniority model  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , the @xmath10 values deduced from the measurement of the lifetimes of the first excited @xmath14 states in @xmath15sn at the unilac accelerator of the gesellschaft fr schwerionenforschung ( gsi ) are overall smaller than the previously reported values and present a shallow minimum at @xmath16  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> these findings have generated a renewal interest in the study of low - lying states in sn isotopes .    </S>",
    "<S> the theoretical description of the enhanced @xmath17 transition strength in the neutron - deficient sn isotopes is not straightforward . </S>",
    "<S> similarly as the seniority scheme , the seniority truncated large - scale shell model calculations predicted a nearly parabolic behavior of @xmath10 values with a maximum at @xmath6  @xcite . by using new interactions and including core polarization terms up to both the third order and @xmath18 core excitations in the shell model calculations , the predicted @xmath10 values exhibit a shallow maximum around @xmath19 , but are still far away from the experimental data @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> shell model calculations in the @xmath20 major shell using cd - bonn and nijmegen1 two - body effective nucleon - nucleon ( nn ) interactions were also carried out for the mid - heavy even - even sn isotopes in refs .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> an overall good agreement with the observed energy spectra of sn isotopes is found . </S>",
    "<S> however , the @xmath2 transitions are not presented . </S>",
    "<S> recently , a quasiparticle - phonon model ( qpm ) was adopted to investigate the evolution of the @xmath0 state in sn isotopes  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the calculation reproduced the trend of the energies and , partly , the observed deviations of the @xmath2 strengths from the parabolic behavior . </S>",
    "<S> it was shown that such an asymmetric trend was the consequence of several factors : single - particle energies , polarization of the @xmath21 core , interplay between pairing plus quadrupole , and quadrupole pairing interactions  @xcite , all of which , however , are quite model - dependent .    in the framework of nuclear energy density functional theory or self - consistent hartree - fock - bogoliubov ( hfb ) approach , due to the robust @xmath22 shell gap , </S>",
    "<S> the ground states of all the sn isotopes are dominated by the spherical configuration . for the @xmath0 states , which are expected to be a one - phonon state caused by surface vibration around the spherical shape , the theoretical studies are obviously beyond the mean - field approximation . for this purpose </S>",
    "<S> , one can either introduce random - phase approximation ( rpa ) or generator coordinate method ( gcm ) , where the polarization of @xmath23 core in the shell model can be taken into account by particle - hole excitation in rpa or configuration mixing of different shapes in gcm . </S>",
    "<S> the implementations of the quasiparticle rpa on top of the nonrelativistic and relativistic mean - field calculations were carried out to investigate the evolution of low - lying states along the sn isotopic chain  @xcite . in refs .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , the systematics of @xmath17 values can be roughly reproduced . </S>",
    "<S> however , these studies were focused on the substantial rise of the @xmath10 values at neutron magic numbers 50 and 82 , and did not provide any interpretation for the enhanced collectivity in the neutron - deficient sn isotopes .    in recent years , the gcm has been introduced into the self - consistent mean - field approaches by combing with projection techniques in the modern energy density functional calculations  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the dynamic correlation effects related to the symmetry restoration and quadrupole fluctuation ( along both @xmath24 and @xmath25 directions ) around the mean - field minimum could be taken into account . </S>",
    "<S> these methods restricted to axial case have been applied to study the low - lying collective excitation spectra of the neutron - deficient pb isotopes  @xcite . however , the application of these methods with triaxial degree - of - freedom for systematic study is still much time - consuming . up to now , such kind of study is mostly restricted to light nuclei  @xcite and some specific medium heavy nuclei  @xcite . as the gaussian overlap approximation of gcm , collective hamiltonian with parameters determined by self - consistent mean - field calculations is much simple in numerical calculations , and has achieved great success in description of nuclear low - lying states for deformed and transitional nuclei  @xcite .    in the past decades , </S>",
    "<S> the covariant density functional theory ( cdft ) has achieved great success in the description of nuclear structure over almost the whole nuclide chart , from light systems to superheavy nuclei , and from the valley of @xmath24 stability to the particle drip lines @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> recently , the implementation of the five - dimensional collective hamiltonian ( 5dch ) based on the cdft has been developed and given successful microscopic description for the nuclear shape transitions along both the isotopic and isotonic chains  @xcite . in this work </S>",
    "<S> , we are going to apply this approach to study the low - lying collective states , for the first time , in the semi - magic sn isotopes . </S>",
    "<S> our aim is to provide a microscopic mechanism for the enhanced @xmath2 transitions in the neutron - deficient sn isotopes .    in the calculation </S>",
    "<S> , we use a recent parameterized relativistic functional pc - pk1  @xcite for the particle - hole channel , and a separable force  @xcite for the particle - particle channel . </S>",
    "<S> the solution of the equation of motion for the nucleons is accomplished by an expansion of the dirac spinors in a set of three - dimensional harmonic oscillator basis functions in cartesian coordinates with 12 major shells . </S>",
    "<S> more details about the calculations can be found in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the intrinsic triaxially deformed states are obtained as solutions of the self - consistent rmf+bcs equations constrained on the mass quadrupole moments related to the bohr parameters @xmath26 varying @xmath27 $ ] and @xmath28 $ ] with step size @xmath29 and @xmath30 .    </S>",
    "<S> the nuclear collective excitations associated with three - dimensional rotation and quadrupole fluctuations are described with a five - dimensional collective hamiltonian ( 5dch ) . </S>",
    "<S> the dynamics of the 5dch is governed by the seven functions of the intrinsic deformations @xmath24 and @xmath25 : the collective potential @xmath31 , the three mass parameters : @xmath32 , @xmath33 , @xmath34 , and the three moments of inertia @xmath35 . </S>",
    "<S> these functions are determined using cranking approximation formula based on the intrinsic triaxially deformed states . </S>",
    "<S> the diagonalization of the hamiltonian yields the excitation energies and collective wave functions that are used to calculate observables  @xcite .    </S>",

    "<S> [ fig : be2 ] displays the excitation energies of @xmath0 states for sn isotopes from our 5dch calculations , in comparison with those by the shell model with @xmath37sn core and rqrpa calculations , as well as the data . </S>",
    "<S> the trend of the excitation energies of @xmath0 states along the isotopic chain is reproduced quite well by the three models . </S>",
    "<S> it is notable that our 5dch calculations give quite similar results as those by the rqrpa calculations , although the realization of these two models for excitation states are quite different . </S>",
    "<S> compared with the shell model calculation , the discrepancy between our 5dch result and the data is relatively larger for @xmath38sn , from @xmath39  kev to @xmath40  mev . </S>",
    "<S> however , it is worthwhile to note that the 5dch is fully self - consistent and without any free parameter . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , we find that , beside @xmath0 state , the excitation energies of other low - lying states for @xmath41sn are described as well as that by the recent shell model calculations  @xcite . taking @xmath42sn as an example one finds that the _ rms _ deviation for seven low - lying excitation states ( the first two @xmath43 , three @xmath14 , and two @xmath44 ) is : @xmath45  mev for the 5dch , which is in comparison with the corresponding value 0.429 mev obtained by using nijmegen1 effective interaction in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , and 0.137 mev in the calculation of ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite .    in the lower panel of fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : be2 ] , we present the @xmath9 values from 5dch calculations , in comparison with the results by shell model and rqrpa , as well as the recently measured data . </S>",
    "<S> it is shown that both the 5dch and rqrpa calculations reproduce rather well the systematics of @xmath17 values in the whole isotopic chain , in particular the increase of @xmath2 strength from @xmath42sn down to @xmath46sn , which can not be described by the shell model . </S>",
    "<S> quantitatively , the rqrpa slightly underestimates those @xmath2 strengths around @xmath42sn . while the 5dch overestimates the @xmath2 strength @xmath47 when approaching to the neutron shell closure , where the low - lying states are mainly caused by the excitation of few quasiparticles . </S>",
    "<S> concerning our interest and the power of our model , in the following we will mainly focus on the isotopes around middle shell , where the excitation is dominated by the collective vibration and enhanced @xmath2 transition is observed .    </S>",

    "<S> all the sn isotopes are spherical or near spherical . around the neutron mid - shell @xmath6 , </S>",
    "<S> an excited prolate minimum with @xmath49 shows up . as the decrease of the neutron number from @xmath6 down to @xmath8 , </S>",
    "<S> the energy curve around spherical shape becomes softer gradually . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , for @xmath46sn , a weakly prolate deformed global minimum with @xmath50 is observed . in other words , </S>",
    "<S> the dynamic effect of quadrupole deformation fluctuations is enlarging the nuclear collectivity gradually when decreasing neutron number from @xmath6 down to @xmath8 .    </S>",
    "<S> the upper panel of fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : cgp ] displays the curvatures of the deformation energy curves around the spherical shape as a function of neutron number . </S>",
    "<S> a rapid drop of the curvature in sn isotopes with @xmath51 is found , which is responsible for the increased @xmath10 value shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : be2 ] . to understand this change in the topograph of deformation energy curves , we plot the average neutron pairing gaps , weighted by @xmath52 coefficient as ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , at spherical states in the lower panel of fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : cgp ] . </S>",
    "<S> for comparison , the odd - even mass differences of experimental data by the five - point formula are also plotted . </S>",
    "<S> it is shown that the rapid drop of the curvature when decreasing neutron number from @xmath6 is closely correlated to the neutron pairing gaps . </S>",
    "<S> similar evolution trend is shown in the odd - even mass differences . </S>",

    "<S> the balls indicate the position of fermi surface . </S>",
    "<S> it is seen that the levels @xmath4 and @xmath5 move closer as the neutron number decreases from @xmath53 to @xmath54 shell . </S>",
    "<S> meanwhile , the fermi surface comes toward to these two levels for the isotopes with @xmath51 . </S>",
    "<S> this leads to the increasing level density around fermi surface and consequently enhanced paring correlations . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , it is found that the fermi surface crosses the @xmath55 orbit in between @xmath11 and @xmath56 . </S>",
    "<S> the considerable occupation probability of @xmath55 orbit hinders the collectivity of these nuclei . </S>",
    "<S> meanwhile , the obstructive effect is further enhanced by the low density of single - particle states around the fermi surface , which reduces the pair correlations ( c.f . in fig .  </S>",

    "<S> it provides a qualitative interpretation of the dip of @xmath2 transition at @xmath42sn , which is consistent with that given in ref . </S>",

    "<S> the calculations reproduce the systematics of both excitation energies for @xmath0 states and @xmath1 rather well . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , the enhancement of @xmath2 transitions from @xmath6 to @xmath8 has been found to be the consequence of increasing quadrupole shape fluctuation around spherical shape , induced by the strengthening neutron pairing correlations . </S>",
    "<S> this conclusion is consistent with that by the shell models , but in the language of mean - field approach . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , it is found the gradual degeneracy of levels @xmath4 and @xmath5 around the fermi surface that leads to the increase of level density and consequently the enhanced paring correlations . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , it has shown that the fermi surface crosses the @xmath55 orbit in between @xmath11 and @xmath56 , where the low level density and considerable occupation probability of @xmath55 orbit hinder the nuclear collectivity and give rise to valley - like of the @xmath2 transition as a function of neutron number . </S>"
