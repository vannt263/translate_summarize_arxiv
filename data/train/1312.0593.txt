    "high - mass x - ray binaries ( hmxbs ) are stellar systems consisting of a massive , early - type star ( of o or b spectral type ) and a compact object ( neutron star or black hole ) .",
    "the material lost by the companion star ( the donor ) either through strong stellar winds or a circumstellar disk is accreted onto the compact object resulting in the formation of supergiant x - ray binaries ( sgxrbs ) and be / x - ray binaries ( bexrbs ) respectively .",
    "predominantly the compact objects in these systems are pulsars with spin periods in the 1 - 1000 s range ( e.g. @xcite ) . depending on the available material and the geometry of the orbit of the systems , their x - ray emission can be either persistent or variable in timescales of days up to several months .",
    "their typical luminosity ranges between @xmath2 ( for low - activity systems ) up to @xmath3 erg s@xmath1 ( for outbursting systems ) .    in the bexrbs ,",
    "the most numerous subclass of hmxbs @xcite , the donor is a non - supergiant b star ( luminosity class iii - v ) whose spectrum shows or , has at some time in the past shown , balmer lines in emission ( the so - called `` be phenomenon '' ; e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "this emission is produced by an equatorial disk of ionized material that has been expelled from the star due to its high ( close to the critical limit ) rotational velocity .",
    "subsequently , part of this material is accreted on the compact object .",
    "most bexrbs are transient systems ( e.g. @xcite ) which can produce outbursts with luminosities in the range of @xmath4 erg s@xmath1 ( type i outbursts , which occur at periastron and last a few days ) or even stronger with luminosities @xmath5 erg s@xmath1 ( type ii outbursts , which are more rare and occur at irregular intervals ) . however , there are also persistent sources which display lower luminosity levels ( @xmath6 erg s@xmath1 ; for a review see @xcite ) .    in the case of sgxrbs ( @xcite , and references therein ) ,",
    "the donor is a supergiant o or b - type star ( luminosity class i - ii ) .",
    "depending on the mass - transfer mechanism these systems are divided in roche - lobe overflow ( rlof ; e.g. @xcite ) and wind - fed ( e.g. @xcite ) . for systems in the first subclass , the steady mass - transfer rate through the roche - lobe is high enough to lead to the formation of an accretion disk around the compact object , resulting in persistent systems with luminosities up to @xmath7 erg s@xmath1 . in wind - fed systems ,",
    "the donor star loses mass through a strong radial stellar wind ( with mass - loss rates between @xmath8 m@xmath9 yr@xmath1 ) .",
    "as the compact object lies in a close orbit around the donor , it becomes a persistent x - ray source with much lower luminosity ( in the range @xmath10 erg s@xmath1 ) .",
    "these systems are referred as `` classical '' .",
    "the advent of _ integral _ has unveiled new populations of wind - fed systems : the supergiant fast x - ray transients ( sfxts ; @xcite ) and the heavily obscured sgxrbs @xcite . the sfxts display flaring activity which lasts from few minutes to several hours with a luminosity increase from @xmath11 erg s@xmath1 to @xmath12 erg s@xmath1 . on the other hand ,",
    "the heavily obscured sgxrbs are actually similar to the `` classical '' wind - fed sgxrbs but the compact object is deeply embedded in a dense absorbing environment .",
    "their @xmath13 column density can be as high as @xmath14 @xmath15 thus suppressing significantly their observed x - ray luminosities . for comparison",
    "the measured absorbing column density for the `` classical '' systems is of the order of @xmath16 @xmath15 ( for a review see @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the small magellanic cloud ( smc ) is an excellent laboratory to study the hmxbs , since it is nearby ( d = 60 kpc ; @xcite ) and well - covered by the _",
    "chandra _ and _ xmm - newton _ x - ray observatories that can detect sources down to @xmath17 erg s@xmath1 ( i.e. reaching luminosities of non - outbursting sources ) .",
    "moreover , it does not suffer from large extinction and distance uncertainties that often hamper studies of hmxbs in the milky way .",
    "it also has a relatively uniform metallicity among the young populations , and a well - determined star - formation history @xcite .",
    "most importantly it is host to a large number ( @xmath18 ) of hmxbs ( @xcite , 2009b , 2010 ) . out of these systems",
    "only one is a sgxrb , source smc x-1 @xcite , which is the only persistent accreting x - ray pulsar ( p@xmath19 s ; @xcite ) in the smc fed through rlof .",
    "this system has a b0 supergiant companion @xcite with an orbital period of 3.89 days @xcite and an x - ray luminosity of @xmath20 erg s@xmath1 in the 0.2 - 12.0 kev energy band ( e.g. xmmsl1 ; @xcite ) .",
    "in contrast , in the milky way the number of confirmed or suspected supergiant systems is much higher ( @xmath21% of the total number of hmxbs ; @xcite ) .",
    "although the number of known hmxbs in the smc has increased dramatically in the last decade , only recently we started having a picture of the spectral classification of their donor stars ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "this is important since it can yield valuable information on the evolution of massive binary stellar systems .",
    "following our previous work @xcite , we used the multiple - object mode of the aaomega spectrograph , a fiber - fed optical spectrograph on the 3.9 m anglo - australian telescope ( aat ) , to obtain optical spectra of confirmed and candidate hmxbs , in order to identify bexrbs and determine their spectral types .    in this paper",
    "we present the results of this spectroscopic campaign .",
    "its structure is the following : in section [ s - sample ] we describe the sample of sources and in section [ s - obs+dataanalysis ] we discuss the observations and the data reduction . in section [ s - select_bexrbs ]",

    "this approach allowed us to identify candidate hmxbs even when we could not detect x - ray pulsations in the x - ray data , a tell - tale signature of bexrb pulsars .",
    "it also allowed us to identify objects of lower x - ray luminosities than it would be impossible based on the detection of x - ray pulsations .    in this work we use the sample of @xcite , which includes the most likely optical counterpart of 158 _ chandra _ sources with x - ray luminosities as low as @xmath23 erg s@xmath1 , of uncertain or unknown spectral types",
    "moreover , this sample is supplemented by 211 additional sources detected in various _ xmm - newton _ observations of the smc reaching @xmath24 erg s@xmath1 ( @xcite ) , which also have uncertain or unpublished spectral types .",

    "[ f - kstests - orbital_param ] we present the cumulative distributions of the spectral types , orbital periods , and eccentricities for mw and smc bexrbs . for the smc we used the spectral types of sources as derived from this work and the previous studies of @xcite , and @xcite , while for the mw we take the data from the review paper of @xcite .",
    "we find marginal evidence for difference between the spectral type distributions of smc and mw bexrbs ( @xmath2299.9% confidence based on the ks test ) , in contrast to previous studies which found no evidence for difference between the bexrb populations in these two galaxies ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "we attribute this difference to the use of larger samples for both the smc and the mw than previous studies , and the extension of the former to later spectral types .",
    "however , given the important implications of this difference for the evolution of bexrbs in the smc we consider it as only tentative at this point .",
    "on the other hand , we do not find any evidence for difference in the distribution of the orbital parameters ( @xmath28 , @xmath29 ) in smc and mw bexrbs , based on the ks test .",
    "this result provides an indication for the distribution of the kick velocities imparted on the pulsars during the supernova explosion",
    ". the vector of the kick and the mass of the secondary object ( in the initial binary ) will affect the orbit of the neutron star around it .",
    "since the spectral types ( which reflects the donor mass of the bexrbs ) are not dramatically different between the smc and the mw , and the orbital - element distributions ( period and eccentricity ) are not different at a statistically significant level , we can deduce that there is an indication that the kicks imparted to the pulsars during the supernova explosions have similar strengths in the smc and the mw .",
    "further support comes from previous studies , where the measured kicks in the mw bexrbs ( @xmath30 km s@xmath1 ; @xcite ) are found to be comparable with these of the smc bexrbs ( @xmath31 km s@xmath1 ; @xcite , @xmath32 km s@xmath1 ; @xcite ) .",
    "the optical counterpart of source cxou j005409.57 - 724143.5 ( ch6 - 20 ) is classified in this work as a supergiant star .",
    "if the x - ray source is an accreting binary , it would be only the second to be found in the smc after smc x-1 @xcite .",
    "its optical counterpart is star lha 115-s 18 @xcite also known as azv 154 @xcite , a well known bright emission - line star that has been studied systematically since 1956 ( @xcite , and references therein ) , and more recently in @xcite . in fig .",
    "[ f - finding_chart ] we present a finding chart of the x - ray source and its corresponding optical counterpart .    according to the classification criteria for supergiant b[e ] stars @xcite , these objects exhibit strong balmer emission lines ( usually with p cygni profiles indicating mass loss ) , low excitation permitted and forbidden lines ( e.g. feii ) , and strong near or mid - infrared excess ( due to hot circumstellar dust ) .",
    "moreover , they are rather stable photometrically ( variation of the order of @xmath220.1 - 0.2 mag ) and spectroscopically , unlike the s doradus / luminous blue variable ( lbv ) stars which exhibit similar spectra @xcite .",
    "as discussed in section [ s - discus_sources ] , star s 18 presents the typical spectral characteristics of b[e ] stars .",
    "in addition , it is very bright in the near - ir showing a very large color excess of @xmath33-[3.6@xmath34m]=@xmath35 , compared to the main sequence and supergiant b stars ( most be stars show a color excess of @xmath33-[3.6@xmath34m]@xmath36 ; @xcite ) .    in fig .",
    "[ f - sg_lc ] we present the light curve of star s 18 , using the ogle - ii data in the @xmath37 filter ( as discussed in section [ s - optir_data ] ) , clearly indicating a highly variable source .",
    "in addition , s 18 exhibits spectroscopic variations ( e.g. in the lines of heii @xmath38 , civ @xmath39 , niv @xmath40 ; @xcite ) .",
    "this is in contrast with the photometric stability of typical sgb[e ] stars , and it is more similar to the strong variability of lbv stars ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "however , there is growing evidence that the sgb[e ] and the lbv sources are not distinct classes @xcite . in order to investigate if it is an accreting binary source we searched for modulation of its optical emission resulting from an orbital period . due to the significant variability",
    ", we detrended the light curve following @xcite , by fitting a 2nd order polynomial to each year - long segment of the data .",
    "then we obtained the lomb - scargle periodogram @xcite for the entire detrended light curve .",
    "we did not find any periodicity at the 90% confidence level in agreement with the results of @xcite .",
    "the significance level was estimated by simulating light curves based on the noise characteristics of the data and repeating the analysis for each simulated light curve .      in order to explain the spectral variations of s 18",
    ", @xcite suggested the presence of a hot companion , possibly a helium star or a neutron star . but",
    "no further evidence of such an object existed as the x - ray observations at the time were not sensitive enough to observe any emission from accretion onto a putative compact object . nowadays , _",
    "chandra _ and _ xmm - newton _ are able to routinely detect sources with x - ray luminosities down to @xmath41 erg s@xmath1 at the distance of the smc ( with 10 - 30 ks exposures ) and have succeeded in detecting source cxou j005409.57 - 724143.5 ( ch6 - 20 ) which is spatially coincident with star s 18 . in the study of @xcite",

    "we confirm that the optical counterpart of the source cxou j005409.57 - 724143.5 ( ch6 - 20 ) is the supergiant b[e ] star s 18 .",
    "this source has only been detected in the x - ray band in only two epochs ( see section [ s - xray_data ] ) . the lack of previous detections with _",
    "rosat _ or _ einstein _ indicate that it is persistently at a low luminosity state ( @xmath42 erg s@xmath1 ) since at higher luminosities it would have been detected already in one of the several pointings with these observatories .",
    "although the intensity of ch6 - 20 is only @xmath43 above the background in the _ chandra _ survey , the independent _ xmm - newton _ detection with a source - detection likelihood of det_ml=24.6 during the first _ xmm - newton _ observation ensures that the source is not spurious .",
    "next we discuss the x - ray properties of this source in the context of typical supergiant wind - fed x - ray binaries .",
    "assuming bondi - hoyle accretion from a stellar wind , the x - ray luminosity of the compact object is given by ( e.g. @xcite ) : @xmath44 where @xmath45 is the efficiency of the conversion of the rest mass energy of the accreted matter into radiation ( @xmath46 ) , @xmath47 is the mass - loss rate , @xmath48 is the speed of light , @xmath49 is the gravitational constant , @xmath50 is the mass of the compact object , @xmath27 is the separation between the compact object and the donor star , and @xmath51 is the wind velocity",
    ". the distance @xmath27 can be calculated at the periastron from kepler s 3rd law : @xmath52 where @xmath53 is the mass of the donor ob star , @xmath54 is the orbital period of the system , and _",
    "e _ is the eccentricity . for the donor star , @xcite estimate a mass of @xmath55 m@xmath56 , a wind mass - loss rate of @xmath57 m@xmath9 yr@xmath1 , and a velocity of @xmath58 km s@xmath1 . since we have no information on the orbital parameters of the system we take the typical ( median ) values for the orbital period ( @xmath59 d ) and eccentricity ( @xmath60 0.17 ) for other known sgxrbs ( from the data in table 7 of @xcite , for smc and milky way systems )",
    "this results in a peak x - ray luminosity at periastron of @xmath61 erg s@xmath1 . keeping the same values for the orbital period and eccentricity , but using instead the typical wind parameters for supergiant stars in the smc within the spectral range o9.5-b1 ( @xmath62 m@xmath9 yr@xmath1 and @xmath63 km s@xmath1 ; @xcite ) we derive a luminosity of @xmath64 erg s@xmath1 .",
    "the estimated peak @xmath65 at periastron from the values obtained from @xcite is too high for this source to remain undetected for so long . on the other hand ,",
    "when the values from @xcite are used , the estimated peak @xmath65 is consistent with the measured luminosity and comparable to the detection limits of the _ chandra _ and _ xmm - newton _ observations .",
    "however , the above luminosities correspond to the peak @xmath65 for this source when the neutron star is located at periastron , assuming a stable mass - loss rate .",
    "if the x - ray observations were obtained when the neutron star is away from the periastron and/or a lower mass - loss rate phase ( as for example it would be expected from its significant optical variability ) then the x - ray luminosity would be even lower than that estimated above .",
    "furthermore , a clumpy wind with a high mass - loss rate may provide an alternative interpretation for the nature of this source . in this case the high column density towards the neutron star due to the wind may obscure its x - ray emission . a column density of @xmath66 @xmath15 ( assuming a power - law spectrum with a photon index @xmath67=1.7 in the 0.5 - 7 kev energy band ) would be enough to attenuate a source with intrinsic @xmath68 erg s@xmath1 ( which is the upper range in its x - ray luminosity based on the parameters from @xcite ) down to @xmath69 erg s@xmath1 , while an @xmath70 @xmath15 would be enough to attenuate a source with intrinsic @xmath71 erg s@xmath1 ( the luminosity expected from the parameters of @xcite ) down to @xmath72 erg s@xmath1 .",
    "both of these estimates are half the value we found with _",
    "chandra_. however , we do have significant detection below 2 kev in both the _ chandra _ and _ xmm - newton _ observations ( @xmath73 and 39@xmath7411 counts respectively ) , and only upper limits or marginal detections above 4 kev , which do not allow us to set any useful constraints on the spectral parameters of this source .    there is an emerging subclass of highly obscured wind - fed sgxrbs , discovered in recent _ integral _ observations @xcite . to date",
    "there are three known x - ray sources with b[e ] companions : igr j16318 - 4848 @xcite , which is considered the prototype of highly obscured wind - fed sgxrbs , ci cam / xte j0421 + 560 @xcite , the first hmxb with a sgb[e ] companion , and wd1 - 9 @xcite , a probable colliding - wind system .",
    "recently , @xcite presented a detailed study of ci cam observed in 2003 with _ xmm - newton_. this system has a b0 - 2[e ] supergiant companion @xcite and shows a heavily absorbed ( @xmath75 @xmath15 ) power - law ( @xmath76 ) spectrum reaching @xmath77 erg s@xmath1 ( 3 - 10 kev ) in quiescence . in 1998",
    "it showed an outburst reaching a flux of @xmath78 erg @xmath15 s@xmath1 ( 2 crab ) in the 2 - 10 kev energy band @xcite . assuming a distance of 5 kpc , the outburst luminosity is @xmath79 erg s@xmath1 .",
    "the nature of the compact object in this system as well as in igr j16318 - 4848 is unclear @xcite , although there is some indication that at least in the case of igr j16318 - 4848 it might be a neutron star @xcite .",
    "the main difference of these systems from the `` classical '' sgxrbs is that they are much more absorbed in the x - ray band .",
    "the compact object is deeply embedded in the dense material of the wind and the absorbing column density changes during the orbit ( it may increase up to ten times close to the eclipse ; @xcite ) .",
    "moreover , material away from the compact object ( like the material around the sgb[e ] star ) may contribute to the absorption ( e.g. as in igr j16318 - 4848 ; @xcite ) .",
    "in this case the source exhibits strong ir excess , attributed to free - free and bound - free emission from hydrogen in a circumstellar envelope ( or disk ; @xcite ) . at longer wavelengths such as those observed by _ spitzer _ , the ir excess indicates the presence of warm dust in the circumstellar envelope or the disk . in fig .",
    "[ f - ir_excess ] we present the location of source ch6 - 20 in a near infra - red ( nir ) color - color diagram .",
    "this plot is an updated version of fig . 4 by @xcite , where in addition to the bexrbs we include all highly obscured sgxrbs identified so far by _",
    "integral_. these sources show luminosities in the @xmath80 erg s@xmath1 range , they are highly variable and they have absorbing column densities in the @xmath81 @xmath15 range .",
    "we find that source ch6 - 20 shows redder nir colors than the other bexrbs which place it closer to the colors of the obscured supergiant hmxbs .",
    "an alternative scenario for the nature of the ch6 - 20 is that it is a colliding - wind binary ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "these systems consist of two orbiting massive stars in orbit , and their low luminosity x - ray emission ( @xmath82 erg s@xmath1 ) is produced by shocks at the collision front of the winds .",
    "@xcite point out that although s 18 ( ch6 - 20 ) and the wind - fed sgxrb ci cam exhibit many similarities , their long term photometric and spectroscopic behaviors are not quite the same , and argue for a colliding - wind nature for the former system instead of an accreting binary .",
    "this is supported by the location of source ch6 - 20 in the nir color - color diagram ( fig .",
    "[ f - ir_excess ] ) which is also consistent with that of the colliding - wind system wd1 - 9 @xcite and their similar x - ray luminosity ( unabsorbed @xmath83 erg s@xmath1 for wd1 - 9 , in the 0.5 - 8 kev band ; @xcite ) .",
    "the luminosities of both ch6 - 20 and wd1 - 9 are well within the range of colliding - winds systems ( @xmath84erg s@xmath1 , @xcite ) .",

    "unfortunately the weak x - ray emission of this source does not allow us to detect any x - ray photons above 2 kev .",

    "we confirmed the previous classifications ( within 0.5 spectral type ) of 12 sources , while for 3 sources our revised classification , with higher resolution and s / n data , result in later ( by 1 - 1.5 subclass ) spectral types .",
