    "antiprotonic atoms are a specific tool to study the strong interaction and the nucleon density in the nuclear periphery .",
    "the strong interaction potential leads to widths and energy shifts of antiproton - atomic levels compared to the purely electromagnetic interaction .",
    "the measurement of these widths and shifts gives information on the strength of the interaction , which is often expressed by an effective scattering length in the optical potential model  @xcite , and on the nucleon density in the region where the annihilation takes place .",
    "in contrast to other methods which are sensitive to the charge distribution and usually probe the whole nucleus with the nuclear periphery giving only a small contribution , antiprotons are sensitive to the matter density at the nuclear periphery ( they probe the nucleon density at distances about 2  fm larger than the half - denstity charge radius ) . by investigating different isotopes of one element , the effect of additional nucleons can be deduced .",
    "the major part of the effect comes from the higher nucleon density in the nuclear periphery of isotopes with more neutrons  @xcite .",
    "possibly isospin effects on the effective antiproton - nucleon scattering - length may also exist .    before our studies data of antiprotonic atoms had been collected for several elements  @xcite .",
    "however , with a few exceptions , these were mainly light isotopes ( @xmath5 ) and a number of them was investigated using natural targets under difficult antiprotonic beam conditions .",
    "the aim of the ps209 collaboration was to measure with antiprotons from lear at cern a large variety of elements and isotopes in order to provide a set of data for a new combined analysis  @xcite to determine the nucleon density in the nuclear periphery .",
    "this analysis is expected to yield knowledge about the neutron density in the annihilation region and better knowledge of the antiproton - nucleus interaction , e.g. about a density or isospin dependence of the effective scattering length  @xcite .",
    "the results of the ps209 experiment were already reported in a number of conferences , see e.g.  @xcite . in particular the last reference presents a comprehensive table of level widths and shifts determined in 34 monoisotopic or isotopically separated targets ranging from @xmath6 to @xmath7 . in ref .",
    "@xcite these data were analyzed under the assumption of a two parameter fermi ( 2pf ) distribution of peripheral protons and neutrons .",
    "a linear relationship of the difference between the neutron and proton root mean square radii ( rms ) @xmath8 and the asymmetry parameter @xmath9 was established ( where @xmath10 and @xmath11 are neutron , atomic and mass numbers , respectively ) . besides conference communications some more detailed reports on the evaluations of ps209 results",
    "were already published  @xcite or are in preparation .    in this publication results for tin and cadmium isotopes are presented .",
    "the isotopes @xmath12 , @xmath13 , @xmath14 , @xmath15 , @xmath16 and @xmath17 have been investigated . for four of these nuclei also",
    "the neutron - to - proton density ratio in the nuclear periphery could be measured using the radiochemical method  @xcite .",
    "the principle of the method employed is described in ref .  .",
    "the antiprotons are captured into a high antiprotonic - atom orbit .",
    "they cascade down towards levels with lower principal quantum number @xmath18 by the emission of auger electrons and x - rays . in states with low @xmath18",
    "the orbit of the antiproton comes close to the nucleus and the interaction with the nucleus becomes large .",
    "the resulting shifts and widths of the levels were partly evaluated and interpreted as explained in the next sections .",
    "the strong interaction width can be measured directly ( via analysis of the line shape ) if it is of the order of magnitude of the instrumental resolution ( about 1  kev ) . for many isotopes",
    "this is the case for the lowest visible transition .",
    "the energy of the transitions may be measured with an accuracy of about 10  ev .",
    "thus strong - interaction energy shifts which are larger than this value may be determined . for those levels ,",
    "for which the strong interaction width is of the order of the electromagnetic width ( due to x- and auger transitions ) , the strong interaction width was deduced from the intensity balance of the x - ray transitions feeding and depopulating the respective level  @xcite . in the case of non - circular transitions",
    "the feeding transitions can not be observed experimentally , as they are hidden by the much stronger intensities of the circular transitions . in these cases",
    "the feeding intensities can be taken from cascade calculations if the cascade is sufficiently well known  @xcite .",
    "the experiment was performed with the antiproton beam provided by lear of cern . the setup ( cf .",
    "[ setup ] ) is similar to that described in ref .  .",
    "due to the small initial momentum of the antiprotons of 106  mev/@xmath19 the scintillation - counter telescope , consisting of an anticounter s1 and a counter s2 , was placed inside a chamber ( with aluminum windows of thickness 12  @xmath20 m ) filled with helium .",
    "this was necessary to avoid large an energy straggling and degradation for the low energy ( 6.0  mev ) antiprotons in air .",
    "after passing the chamber window the antiprotons were stopped inside the target .",
    "the properties of the different targets are listed in table  [ targets ] .",
    "the x - rays emitted during the antiproton cascade were measured with three ge detectors ( two coaxial detectors with an active diameter of 49 mm and a length of 50  mm and one planar detector with diameter 36  mm and thickness 14  mm ) with a resolution ( fwhm ) of about 1  kev at 200  kev gamma ray energy .",
    "the detectors were placed at distances of about 50  cm from the target at angles of 13@xmath21 , 35@xmath21 and 49@xmath21 respectively towards the beam axis .",
    "the detector - target distance was adjusted in the way to obtain a good signal - to - noise ratio and simultaneously decrease the background produced by pions from the annihilation processes , which would obscure the x - ray lines and would have damaged the detectors .",
    "this also allowed to avoid summing effects .",
    "the x - rays were measured in coincidence with the antiproton signal in a time window which was extended up to 500  ns after the antiproton signal from the telescope counter . the stability and efficiency of the detectors and the data acquisition system was checked by on - line and off - line measurements with calibration sources .",
    "the x - ray spectrum from the target @xmath17 , as taken with detector  1 , is shown in fig .",
    "[ sn124spec ] .",
    "the upper right part shows the part of the spectrum with the last visible transition @xmath22 .",
    "those lines in the spectra which are not significantly broadened by strong interaction were fitted with gaussian functions .",
    "their relative intensities are given in table  [ cd_int ] and table  [ sn_int ] for the cd and sn istopes , respectively .",
    "for the fit of the transition @xmath22 two lorentzians convoluted with gaussians were used .",
    "the strong - interaction energy shifts were deduced from the measured energies of these transitions .",
    "the energy shift is the difference between the energy calculated with a purely electromagnetic potential  @xcite and the measured transition energy .",
    "the widths of the levels @xmath23 were determined from the measured intensity balance .",
    "small corrections for parallel transitions and for unobserved transitions from higher levels were taken from the calculated cascade  @xcite .",
    "for the determination of the width of the level ( 9,7 ) all intensities of the feeding transitions were taken from the results of the cascade calculations .",
    "the radiative and auger widths ( obtainded according to ref .",
    "@xcite ) which were used for these calculations are summarized in table  [ cd_rad_aug ] for cadmium and in table  [ sn_rad_aug ] for tin .",
    "tables  [ cd_gam_sh ] and  [ sn_gam_sh ] give the measured widths and shifts for the cadmium and tin isotopes , respectively .",
    "the variation of these observables due to the different number of protons and neutrons from @xmath12 to @xmath17 is clearly visible .",
    "the widths for @xmath17 are roughly twice as large as those for @xmath12 .",
    "the shifts turn from attractive or compatible with zero for @xmath12 to repulsive for @xmath17 .",
    "the only observable which does not follow rather smooth systematics is the upper level @xmath24 width of @xmath12 . for all other nuclei presented in these tables",
    "the lower to upper level widths ratio is @xmath25 , whereas the same ratio is only about 50 in case of @xmath12 .",
    "this effect is due to e2 resonance  @xcite which in cd nuclei mixes the @xmath26 and the @xmath27 states .",
    "the difference between the energies of nuclear @xmath28 state and the corresponding antiprotonic - atom transition is 65  kev and 184  kev in @xmath12 and @xmath13 , respectively .",
    "as the electric quadrupole moment is not very different for both nuclei  @xcite , the increase of the upper level width due to the mixing is more significant in @xmath12 than in @xmath13 .",
    "this qualitatively explains the observed effect .    to be more quantitative , the width of the @xmath26 level in cd nuclei should be known .",
    "this width was estimated by an extrapolation to @xmath29 of the systematics presented in  @xcite for lower z nuclei .",
    "the extrapolated value is @xmath30  kev .",
    "this leads to the e2 induced width of @xmath31  ev and @xmath32  ev in @xmath12 and @xmath13 , respectively .",
    "the @xmath33 and @xmath34 components of the upper level widths , corrected for the e2 effect , are also given in table  [ cd_gam_sh ] .",
    "the summary of the results ( measured values ) for @xmath12 is shown in fig .",
    "the region of tin isotopes with a closed @xmath35 proton shell constitutes one of the favorable parts of the nuclear chart for experimental and theoretical nuclear - structure studies . during our investigation on antiprotonic atoms in this region we measured , besides the results reported in this paper , the level widths and shifts in even te isotopes ( @xmath36 )  @xcite .",
    "in addition , using the radiochemical method  @xcite , we have determined the neutron halo factor , a quantity reflecting the composition of the outer nuclear periphery in @xmath37 , @xmath38  @xcite and in @xmath39  @xcite .    in the present discussion",
    "we will concentrate on the first two elements . in our recent publication  @xcite",
    "we have presented in detail our approach to determine the peripheral neutron distribution and differences between the neutron and proton mean square radii @xmath8 using observables gathered from antiprotonic atoms under the assumption of a two - parameter fermi ( 2pf ) neutron and proton distribution : @xmath40 , where @xmath19 is the half density radius , @xmath41 the diffuseness parameter ( related to the surface thickness @xmath42 by @xmath43 ) and @xmath44 is a normalization factor .",
    "this approach is summarized below .",
    "assuming identical annihilation probabilities on neutrons and protons the radiochemical experiment determines the halo factor , which is close to the normalized neutron to proton density ratio ( @xmath45 ) at a radial distance @xmath46  fm larger than the half density charge radius . comparing the halo factor with the neutron to proton density ratio deduced from @xmath8 determined in other experiments",
    "one can conclude that for neutron rich nuclei it is mostly the neutron diffuseness which increases and not the half density radius  @xcite .",
    "although this conclusion was based on the very simple 2pf model of the nuclear periphery it is corroborated by much more sophisticated hartree  fock  bogoliubov ( hfb ) calculations .",
    "this is illustrated in figs .",
    "[ hfb_2pf ] and  [ hfb_2pf_rorat ] , where the proton and neutron density distributions for @xmath17 are compared for both models .",
    "the hfb calculations were performed using skp force  @xcite , giving @xmath8 value equal to 0.16  fm .",
    "as the calculated proton ( @xmath47 ) and neutron ( @xmath48 ) half - density radii are almost identical , this rms difference is mainly due to the difference in the proton and neutron surface diffuseness .",
    "the fitted 2pf distributions with the hfb @xmath48 , @xmath47 and @xmath8 values closely approximate the hfb distributions . in the peripheral region from 6.5  fm to 8.5  fm , e.g , the 2pf neutron distribution differs by less than 20% from that derived from hfb calculations .",
    "a similar result was obtained for other investigated nuclei .",
    "the antiprotonic x - rays are analyzed using an optical potential with the antiproton - nucleon scattering length of the form @xmath49  fm , as proposed for point - like nucleons in ref .",
    "the method allows to study the nuclear density at a radial distances about 1  fm closer to the nuclear center than those examined in the radiochemical experiment .",
    "the peripheral bare proton densities in form of 2pf distributions are obtained  @xcite from the experiments sensitive to the nuclear charge : electron scattering  @xcite or muonic x - rays  @xcite .",
    "the differences between experimental level widths and shifts and those calculated with parameters of the proton distributions are attributed to the neutron contributions to these observables .",
    "based on the analysis and the comparison described above , the half density radii of the proton and neutron distributions are assumed to be equal , @xmath50 .",
    "the neutron diffuseness is considered as a free parameter , adjusted to agree best with the experimental lower and upper level widths ( the lower level shifts were not taken to the fits , see comments below ) .",
    "table  [ dtpar ] illustrates this procedure for the cd and sn nuclei . for the sn nuclei the 2pf charge distribution determined using data from muonic atoms or from electron scattering differ significantly . only the electron scattering data lead to @xmath8 values compatible with the systematics gathered for other nuclei  @xcite and with previous experiments  @xcite .",
    "therefore these data were retained for further analysis . in fig .",
    "[ gam_sh_rys ] the widths and shifts , calculated with density distributions from this table and the scattering lengths given above are compared with corresponding experimental values .",
    "it is evident that the potential used is able to reproduce simultaneously the lower and upper level widths for cd and sn nuclei whereas one has some problems with the level shifts ( only for @xmath15 , @xmath16 and @xmath17 the measured shifts are reproduced within the experimental errors ) .",
    "the analysis of the x - ray data as presented in table  [ dtpar ] allows to determine the normalized neutron to proton density ratio @xmath51 as a function of the radial distance at the periphery of the investigated nuclei .",
    "as indicated above , the radiochemical experiment can be considered as giving the same ratio at a radial distance in the far periphery .",
    "figure  [ rorat_prc ] compares the results of these two experiments together with the normalized neutron to proton density ratio obtained from the hartree - fock - bogoliubov ( hfb ) calculations . for the sake of illustration",
    "the comparison is extended to some other nuclei not discussed in detail in the present publication . for heavy cd and sn nuclei two experimental approaches are consistent within the experimental errors .",
    "they are also in fair agreement with hfb calculations ( a similar result is obtained for 15 other investigated nuclei , partly shown in fig .  [ rorat_prc ] ) .",
    "as already mentioned in our previous paper  @xcite the situation is quite different for the lightest members of the cd and sn chains . for these nuclei",
    "the analysis of the x - ray data gives densities consistent with the hfb model with skyrme interaction as well as with recent calculations with gogny force  @xcite .",
    "the radiochemical experiment , however , seems to indicate a proton - rich nuclear periphery .",
    "we encountered a similar problem for the two lightest members of the ru and sm isotopic chains . in ref .",
    "@xcite the role of a quasi - bound @xmath52 ( @xmath53 ) state in nuclei with weakly bound protons was indicated as an explanation of this puzzle .",
    "( for @xmath12 and @xmath14 the corresponding proton separation energies are 7354  kev and 7559  kev , respectively ) .",
    "the formation of such a state would favor the annihilation on protons in comparison with those on neutrons and lead to a much smaller halo factor than really expected from the peripheral neutron and proton densities .",
    "this explanation , although opening new research areas , would indicate that our radiochemical method is not as universal as we believed previously .",
    "the x - ray data , combined with proton distributions deduced from electron scattering experiments ( sn nuclei ) and muonic atoms ( cd nuclei ) allowed to determine the differences @xmath8 between neutron and proton rms radii .",
    "the results are presented in table  [ dtpar ] and fig .",
    "[ drdelta ] . they are compared with other experiments as well as with the hfb model in ref .",
    "the @xmath8 values in figure  [ drdelta ] for the @xmath13 result differ from these in ref .",
    "@xcite as the correction for e2 was done and the level shift was excluded from the fit .",
    "the @xmath12 results are presented for the first time .",
    "antiprotonic x - rays were measured in two even cd and four even sn nuclei . the strong interaction level widths and shifts were determined .",
    "the observed isotopic effects are attributed , at least to a large extent , to the increase of the difference between the neutron and proton rms radii with increasing neutron number .",
    "the interpretation of the collected data was done using a simple two parameter fermi ( 2pf ) model to describe the peripheral proton and neutron distribution .",
    "it was verified that these simple distributions approximate rather well ( within 20% ) the distributions obtained from the hfb model in the region where the antiproton annihilation probability is significant .",
    "the parameters of the proton distributions were obtained from literature , where 2pf charge distributions were determined from muonic - atoms or electron - scattering experiments .    for neutron rich nuclei",
    "the peripheral neutron distributions deduced from the antiprotonic x - ray data are in good agreement with ealier radiochemical experiments .",
    "this is , however , not the case for the lightest members of the investigated cd and sn isotope chains . in these nuclei",
    "the radiochemical data indicate enhanced peripheral proton density in comparison with the neutron density .",
    "such a result is in contradiction with the x - ray data as well as with hfb model calculations .",
    "it may be explained by the formation of a quasi - bound @xmath54p states in nuclei with weakly bound protons .",
