    "in order to be able to set up a quantum theory with a probabilistic concept for some given hamilton operator the very existence of an inner product with positive semi - definite norm on the space of functions being subject to the hamilton operator is crucial . for a very long time",
    "the setting of quantum mechanics ( qm ) and later quantum field theory ( qft ) was confined to _ strictly _ hermitian hamilton operators , and accordingly emerged very early a well known inner product with positive semi - definite norm associated with the name max born @xcite . as a great surprise",
    "it was noticed very recently that the postulate of strict hermiticity for differential operators representing observables in a quantum theory ( qt ) , i.e. qm and qft , with probability concept is much too tight ( see e.g.  refs .",
    "inspired by some important conjecture by d.  bessis ( and j.  zinn - justin ) of 1992 on the reality and positivity of spectra for manifestly non - hermitian hamiltonians it was c.m .",
    "bender and s.  boettcher in 1997 @xcite who proposed that the reality property of spectra of hamilton operators is connected with the anti - unitary @xcite pt - symmetry of hamilton operators , i.e.  symmetry under simultaneous space ( p , parity ) reflection and time ( t ) reversal .",
    "the reality and boundness of the spectrum for eigenstates with unbroken pt - symmetry has been proven meanwhile rigorously for a general class of pt - symmetric hamilton operators @xcite .",
    "unfortunately it had become also clear that the pt operation can not be used as a metric for a quantum mechanical inner product as the resulting pseudo - norm would be indefinite @xcite .",
    "this noted indefiniteness caused researchers working in the field to recall and review the long history of the concept of pseudo - hermiticity and indefinite metrics @xcite going back to names like p.a.m .",

    "kren , @xmath0 in order to find a suitable inner product with positive semi - definite norm for functions subject to pt - symmetric hamilton operators .",
    "the identification of a so - called cpt - inner product with positive semi - definite norm by c.m .",
    "bender , d.c .  brody and h.f .",
    "jones @xcite ( see e.g.  also discussions in refs .",
    "@xcite ) led then finally to a well defined pseudo - hermitian qm for _ non - hermitian pt - symmetric _ hamilton operators .",
    "pt - symmetric qm has been extended most recently @xcite even to pt - symmetric qft , while recent attempts to extend non - hermitian pt - symmetric qt to some qt for arbitrary non - hermitian hamilton operators are yet in progress ( see e.g.  refs . @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "the open question on the existence of some meaningful inner product in the context of such a future non - hermitian qt is clearly again of crucial importance .",
    "besides this interesting new branch of physics it remained rather unclear whether the existence of an inner product with a positive norm is some consequence of using differential equations of first order in time like the non - relativistic schrdinger equation or the relativistic dirac equation , or whether the existence of such a product can be shown also in the context of differential equations of second order in time like the well known relativistic kg equation .",
    "in fact , the main  naive  text - book folklore says that the inner product of a charged kg field is related to the charge current density and hence the related norm should be indefinite , while consequently the norm of the real , i.e.  neutral , kg field should be vanishing . on the contrary",
    "it had been argued e.g.  in refs .",
    "@xcite that a consistent treatment of neutral kg fields leads to non - vanishing conserved current densities which are tightly related to the energy current density of a neutral kg field .",
    "the key idea to construct an inner product even for _ neutral _ kg fields with a _ positive semi - definite norm _",
    "being worked out in the present manuscript is to subtract the respective current densities related to negative energy states of the kg field yielding a negative semi - definite norm from the respective current densities related to positive energy states of the kg field yielding a positive semi - definite norm .",
    "the resulting inner product for the neutral kg field with an overall positive semi - definite norm , which is derived here in a rather simple way , shows up  assuming a symmetric bilinear form  to be the real - kg - field limit of an inner product with positive semi - definite norm developed by a.  mostafazadeh @xcite and reviewed in detail @xcite by a.  mostafazadeh and f.  zamani ( mz ) for _ complex - valued _ kg - fields .",
    "as pointed out by mz @xcite their kg inner product reduces in a certain limit to already existing kg inner products derived and discussed in the literature e.g.  by @xcite r.m .",

    "halliwell & m.e .",
    "ortiz , and r.p .",
    "woodard , but is different  to our understanding  from ref .  @xcite .",
    "our present short paper has been on one hand partially motivated by finding an efficiently fast derivation of a meaningful inner product for real , i.e.  neutral , kg fields with positive semi - definite norm , on the other hand is the present paper motivated by the desire to gain some clearer interpretation of the resulting inner product for _ neutral _ kg fields than the one provided on the basis of a global gauge symmetry by mz in the context of _ complex - valued _ kg fields .",
