    "carbon nanotubes are a one - dimensional conductor consisting of rolled graphite sheets.@xcite usually a single - wall carbon nanotube has a diameter of the order of a few nm and a length of the order of several @xmath2 m .",

    ", we shall calculate optical response of finite - length metallic nanotubes in much lower frequency region than an inter - band transition . in  2 , the method to calculate the optical response is described and an approximation based on excitation of a single plasmon mode in an infinitely long nanotube is introduced .",

    "further , we shall employ a relaxation - time approximation to calculate the boltzmann conductivity , which becomes an exact solution of the transport equation in the single - channel case .",

    "this slow convergence corresponds to the singular distribution of the electric field associated with point - like polarization charges building up in the vicinity of the end points of the nanotube . actually , the use of the nonlocal conductivity is quite effective in suppressing this singular behavior , but is not essential for determining resonance behavior particularly in the low frequency region .",
    "let us consider the case in a uniform external field , i.e. , @xmath63 , which is valid for light with wavelength much larger than the tube length and polarized in the @xmath5 direction .",
    "polarization charge is induced at the ends of the finite length nanotube , as mentioned above .",
    "this charge is regarded almost as a point charge and the associated electric field decreases in proportion to @xmath64 , where @xmath65 is the distance from the end point . in sufficiently long nanotubes , therefore , the field due to this induced charge is negligible in the most region of the nanotube where the absorption mainly takes place .",

    "[ absorption ] .",
    "this shows that the strong screening of the field due to polarized edge charges is the main reason that the single - mode approximation based on a plasmon mode in an infinitely long nanotube has turned out to work surprisingly well in spite of the presence of edges .",
    "carbon nanotubes used in experiments@xcite are usually several micrometer long and therefore longer than the mean free path limited by impurity and/or phonon scattering at room temperature .",
    "recent progress in experiments has achieved short nanotubes with sub - micron size.@xcite in such short nanotubes , discrete energy levels are formed and the level spacing can exceed the broadening due to disorder .",
    "then , we should seriously consider effects of discrete energy levels to discuss optical absorption of finite - length nanotubes .",
    "this problem is out of the scope of this paper and left for a future study .    when a nanotube is tilted from the direction of the external field , the field component parallel to the axis is effective in the absorption and the resonance frequency remains unaffected .",

    "effects of surrounding nanotubes were previously considered by numerically solving halln s equation for infinite planar arrays of nanotubes.@xcite the results showed that interaction between neighboring tubes causes broadening and shift of resonances only when the distance becomes of the order of the tube diameter .",
    "if an end of a nanotube touches another nanotube , the absorption may be significantly modified because of large charges accumulated at the end .",
    "such a situation should be avoided in experiments .",
    "in general , a mini - gap opens around the fermi energy even in so - called metallic nanotubes for various reasons .",
    "for example , the nonzero curvature causes a band gap depending on the chirality,@xcite which can be understood in terms of an effective aharonov - bohm flux within the * k*@xmath146*p * scheme.@xcite a mechanical deformation causes band - gap modification,@xcite which can also be understood in terms of flux.@xcite the amount of the gap depends on the chirality , radius , environment , etc . , and is typically smaller than room temperature .",
    "there have been some reports suggesting the observation of broad absorption due to inter - minigap transitions.@xcite because this mini - gap transition is in the same frequency region , detailed study on the length dependence is required for the purpose of identifying the absorption due to the finite - length origin considered here .    in summary",
    ", we have calculated electric - field distribution and absorption intensity of a finite - length nanotube in oscillating electric field .",
    "the results show that the main resonance corresponding to excitation of the fundamental plasmon mode with wave vector @xmath147 is quite robust except in very dirty tubes . for higher - frequency resonances ,",
    "the electric field associated with induced edge charges starts to be mixed and tends to shift resonances to higher frequencies .",

    "<S> optical response of finite - length metallic carbon nanotubes is calculated including effects of induced edge charges in a self - consistent manner . </S>",
    "<S> the results show that the main resonance corresponding to excitation of the fundamental plasmon mode with wave vector @xmath0 with @xmath1 being the tube length is quite robust and unaffected . </S>",
    "<S> this arises because the strong electric field associated with edge charges is screened and decays rapidly inside the nanotube . for higher - frequency resonances , </S>",
    "<S> the field starts to be mixed and tends to shift resonances to higher frequencies . </S>"
