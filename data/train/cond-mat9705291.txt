    "in recent years great progress has been made in the fabrication and measurement of semiconductor quantum dots made by stranski - krastonov growth . in this technique ,",
    "material is deposited epitaxially onto a substrate that is lattice mismatched to the deposited material . due to the mismatch",
    ", the deposited material spontaneously forms nm scale islands , the size and shape of which are both material and growth - condition dependent .",
    "the pyramidal shape and presence of strain in the islands makes for a potentially rich electronic structure .",
    "theoretical studies of strained islands have employed various degrees of approximation to the geometry , strain distribution , and electron dynamics , ranging from single band models of hydrostatically strained islands , to multiband models including realistic shapes and strain distributions @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we consider inp islands buried in @xmath0 ( gainp)@xcite , a material combination that has so far received little theoretical attention .",
    "the geometry is made as realistic as possible by adopting the shape shown in fig .",
    "1 , which has been observed using atomic force microscopy and transmission electron microscopy @xcite .",
    "we assume that different size islands have the same shape as shown in fig . 1 , but are simply rescaled .",
    "we parameterize the size of the island by the height in the @xmath1 direction , @xmath2 . in most of the calculations we set @xmath3 , but we will consider variations as well . note that the wetting layer is not included in our calculation .",
    "the wetting layer does not significantly alter the strain distribution in the island because it is pseudomorphically strained . also , its measured thickness is on the order of the grid spacing used , and hence its inclusion in the electronic structure portion of the calculation would be unjustified .",
    "the calculation is done in two steps : the strain distribution is determined using continuum elastic theory , and then used in a strain dependent @xmath4 hamiltonian .",
    "the strain is computed by minimizing the free energy for a cubic crystal , @xcite + @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the strain tensor , the @xmath7 s are material depended elastic constants , and @xmath8 is a parameter used to enforce the lattice mismatch between the two materials .",
    "the strain is given in terms of the displacement by @xmath9 .",
    "@xmath10 is constructed as a function of the @xmath11 s on a cubic grid with derivatives replaced by differences , and then @xmath10 is minimized using the conjugate gradient algorithm .",
    "the grid consisted of a periodic box of @xmath12 sites with the island contained within a @xmath13 region .",
    "the grid is reduced @xmath14 by exploiting the symmetries of the system .",
    "the size of the box is chosen sufficiently large to make the band energies within @xmath15 of the bulk gainp values at the points furthest from the island .",
    "errors due to the finite system should be @xmath16 at the island . no constraints need to be directly imposed on the minimization since far from the island the strain has relaxed to its bulk ( @xmath17 ) value .    the lattice mismatch between the two materials is implemented as follows .",
    "the grid is chosen to be commensurate with the barrier material so the grid corresponds to some multiple of the barrier material s _ crystal _ unit cell .",
    "then for unstrained barrier material we would have @xmath18 .",
    "but this means that the grid is wrong for the island material since it has a different crystal unit cell .",
    "unstrained island material should actually have a nonzero @xmath19 to reflect the fact that its crystal unit cell has a different size .",
    "if the island and barrier lattice constants are @xmath20 and @xmath21 respectively , then setting @xmath22 in the island causes the minimum of f to be at @xmath23 , which is the desired amount of strain in the grid . because @xmath24 is completely fictitious , and reflects only the straining of the coordinate system , the physical strain is obtained by subtracting @xmath24 from the @xmath6 that minimizes @xmath10 for the heterostructure .",
    "there is some freedom in the choice of grid differences used to approximate @xmath10 . using symmetric differences , @xmath25/2a$ ] ,",
    "produces oscillatory solutions that must be smoothed .",
    "oscillatory solutions are in fact a common problem with finite difference approximations to equations involving first derivatives . for the case at hand",
    "this problem is avoided by evaluating @xmath10 within each unit cube as a function of the @xmath11 s at the eight corners .",
    "this is essentially a low - order finite element method .",
    "although more sophisticated approximations may yield more more accurate strains , we are constrained by the fact that the strain is to be used with the cubic grid which is most convenient for the electronic structure part of the calculation .",
    "only one strain field is needed for all sizes since it is a dimensionless quantity , and the strain for a different island size is obtained by a trivial rescaling .    because the materials lack inversion symmetry the strain produces a polarization given by @xmath26 , leading to an additional electrostatic potential .",
    "for iii - iv semiconductors , the only nonzero elements of the piezoelectric tensor are @xmath27 . from the polarization it is a simple matter to compute the electrostatic potential @xmath28 by numerically solving poisson s equation .",
    "dipoles are induced at some of the edges , and on the @xmath29 and @xmath30 faces . because the islands are primarily under compression the faces have a negative charge ( fig .",
    "the piezoelectric effect contributes only a small amount to the potential felt by carriers in the island , and most of the modification of the potential is outside the island , as seen in fig .",
    "2 . in studies of inas islands",
    "the piezoelectric potential was important because the islands were assumed to have four - fold rotational symmetry which was broken by the piezoelectric potential @xcite .",
    "the six - sided inp islands lack such a symmetry to begin with , and the piezoelectric potential does not make a qualitative change in the spectrum .",
    "the electronic structure is calculated in the envelope approximation using @xmath6 and @xmath28 computed above .",
    "the electron hamiltonian is @xcite @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the local conduction - band edge in the absence of strain , @xmath33 is the conduction - band deformation potential , and @xmath34 . for the valence band we used a 6-band model given by @xcite + @xmath35\\\\ s&=&-\\sqrt{3 } \\gamma_3 { \\hbar^2\\over m_0 } \\partial_z(\\partial_x- i\\partial_y)\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath36 is the unstrained local valence - band edge , and @xmath37 are the luttinger parameters .",
    "since the luttinger parameters vary spatially , we used the prescription @xmath38 .",
    "the strain dependent coupling is given by @xcite @xmath39 @xmath40 \\\\",
    "r&=&{\\sqrt{3}\\over 2}~b~(\\sigma_{xx}-\\sigma_{yy } ) -id\\sigma_{xy }       \\\\ s&=&-d ( \\sigma_{xz } - i\\sigma_{yz }   ) \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath41 , @xmath42 and @xmath43 are the hydrostatic and two shear deformation potentials .",
    "the four band model may be obtained by taking @xmath44 .",
    "the values used for the various material parameters are given in table 1 .",
    "these vary considerably in the accuracy with which they have been measured , with the deformation potentials suffering the most uncertainty .",
    "there is a paucity of data on gainp , and most quantities are determined by interpolating between inp and gap .",
    "the conduction - band effective mass in gainp is simply set to the value for inp , since interpolation is complicated by the fact that gap is indirect .",
    "the hydrostatic deformation potentials for gainp , @xmath33 and @xmath41 , are estimated by assuming @xmath45 is the same as for inp , while @xmath46 is taken from gainp measurements @xcite . in computing @xmath28 ,",
    "the dielectric constant is assumed to take on the inp value throughout the system .",
    "one parameter that bears special mention is the unstrained valence - band offset .",
    "( i.e. the inp valence - band energy referenced to that of the gainp , in the absence of strain . )",
    "the value used is based on transition - metal impurity spectra , and is in agreement with the value based on au schottky barrier data @xcite .",
    "the idea is that transition - metal impurities are empirically observed to have energy levels fixed with respect to the vacuum , relatively independent of their host environment .",
    "thus , by comparing band edges referenced to the impurity levels in two different materials one deduces the relative band offsets if the strain could be turned off .",
    "the ground state energies of fe impurities are @xmath47 and @xmath48 above the valence band in inp and gainp respectively @xcite , so the inp valence band is @xmath49 below gainp .",
    "before solving schrdinger s equation it is instructive to examine the band structure shown in fig .",
    "the conduction - band is rather ordinary , with electrons confined to the island by a barrier of about @xmath50 at the inp / gainp interface .",
    "strain reduces the barrier height , but since most of the band offset resides in the conduction - band , there is still a substantial barrier .",
    "there is also some modification of the band edge inside the island , but for the most part it looks like a particle in a box .",
    "the barrier height of @xmath50 is in good agreement with measurements using deep - level transient spectroscopy , which give a barrier heigth of @xmath51 @xcite .",
    "the valence band has a very complex structure .",
    "note that in the absence of strain the island would actually be a weak antidot since the inp unstrained valence - band offset is @xmath52 ; the hole confinement is due entirely to strain .",
    "the valence - band edge has peaks near the bottom corners of the island which extend around the base in a ring .",
    "the highest points in this ring lie near the \\{111 } planes . because of the shallowness of the hole potential",
    ", the piezoelectric potential has a greater impact on the holes than on the electrons .",
    "looking along the @xmath1 axis we see the valence band also has peaks in the gainp immediately above and below the island .",
    "the confined state energies and wave functions are found by diagonalization of a finite difference version of the hamiltonian using the lanczos algorithm .",
    "this is done on the same cubic grid used to compute the strain , the only difference being that it is truncated to exclude unnecessary regions of barrier material .",
    "the symmetry of the island is not used to reduce the grid .",
    "the first few conduction - band wave functions are shown in fig .",
    "4 . these states are relatively simple to understand if one crudely approximates the truncated pyramid as a flat box which is smallest in the @xmath1 direction .",
    "the low - lying states all correspond to excitations in the @xmath53 and @xmath54 directions .",
    "one manifestation of the strain is the ordering of the first and second excited states which appears reversed from the naive expectation .",
    "if the island were a simple box , the state with a node along the @xmath55 $ ] direction would be higher since the island is shorter in that direction .",
    "however , strain modifies the the potential , resulting in a different ordering of states .",
    "the valence - band states have a more complex structure , as seen in fig .",
    "the states fall into two categories : states localized near the bottom of the island , labelled @xmath56 , and those localized above the island in the gainp , labelled @xmath57 .",
    "the ground state is @xmath58 , which is peaked around the band - edge maxima near the \\{111 } planes .",
    "excited states ( lower valence - band energy ) extend around the ring at the base of the island .",
    "the first type @xmath59 state , @xmath60 , appears @xmath61 from the ground state .",
    "although the band diagram shows a pocket below the island , there are no localized states there .",
    "the localized valence - band states provide a partial explanation for the observation of multiple lines seen in photoluminescence ( pl ) @xcite .",
    "an excited hole that relaxed into a @xmath59 state would be unable to transfer into one of the @xmath62 states , and would instead recombine with an electron in its ground state .",
    "examination of the valence - band wave functions shows that including the split - off band is not a superfluous addition .",
    "the split off component is typically of order 0.2 of the largest component .    since island size depends on growth conditions it is interesting to examine the dependence of energy on island size , as shown in fig .",
    "the conduction - band spacings are of order @xmath63 for a height of @xmath64 , increasing to @xmath65 for a @xmath66 island .",
    "the hole spacings are much smaller due to their higher effective mass , and the dependence on @xmath2 is more complex due to the odd shaped potential . it should be noted that although the spacings re not monotonic in @xmath2 , the individual energies are .",
    "knowledge of transition rates are important for determining which states will be experimentally accessible . in order for the @xmath59 states to produce an observable pl line",
    "the @xmath67 transition rate must be sufficiently slow that recombination occurs before relaxation into an @xmath62 state .",
    "a simple method of analysis is to compare the relaxation rates for @xmath68 with @xmath69 , where @xmath56 is the @xmath62-state closest in energy into which the @xmath60 state could relax .",
    "if , for example , we assume the transition is due to emission of an acoustic phonon , the rate is given by @xmath70 the calculated wave functions give @xmath71 for @xmath72 throughout the brillouin zone .",
    "this suppression is due entirely to the highly localized nature of the states , so a comparable suppression will be obtained for other relaxation processes .",
    "since multiple pl lines are observed experimentally , it behooves us to examine optical transitions involving excited states .",
    "the strength and polarization dependence of the radiative transitions are found by computing the dipole matrix elements .",
    "these are computed by decomposing the envelope wave functions into linear combinations of the states @xmath73 , @xmath74 , @xmath75 , and @xmath76 , and using the fact that only @xmath77 is nonzero .",
    "the matrix elements are calculated for light in the @xmath1 direction for both possible polarizations .",
    "the results are shown in fig .",
    "7 , where @xmath78 and @xmath79 are the squares of the dipole matrix elements for light polarized in the @xmath53 and @xmath54 directions respectively .",
    "casual examination of the wave functions might lead one to believe that the transition involving the @xmath59 state would be suppressed since it is type ii .",
    "this concern is seen to be unfounded , and the transition rate from the @xmath59 state is comparable to that from the @xmath62 state .",
    "the @xmath59 transitions are highly suppressed for conduction - band states that are antisymmetric about the [ 110 ] direction .",
    "the @xmath62 transitions are less selective , but still show strong polarization dependence .",
    "the most notable feature of transitions between the conduction - band ground state and the valence - band states @xmath56 is that they are predominantly polarized in the @xmath53 direction .",
    "therefore , even if there is mixing of the @xmath62 states , the resulting transition should still be polarized in the @xmath53 direction .",
    "comparison with pl measurements shows good agreement with the major features@xcite .",
    "pl of single quantum dots shows energies in the range @xmath80 , which corresponds to the calculated energies for island heights in the range @xmath81 .",
    "the calculated pl spacing of @xmath61 for @xmath3 is in agreement with the observed multiple pl lines which are @xmath82 apart .",
    "experiments on single islands show as many as four lines , which the current model is unable to explain .",
    "it should be noted , however , that macroscopic pl measurements which necessarily average over a range of island sizes and shapes , typically show two peaks spaced @xmath83 apart .",
    "therefore the dominant characteristic of the spectrum is consistent with the valence - band double - well potential .",
    "the additional lines appear to be due to some further structure .",
    "the extra structure could be due to asymmetry of the islands , which would each split each of the @xmath62 and @xmath59 states into two localized states , giving a total of four lines .",
    "while appealing , this model is difficult to reconcile with the observation that the islands have a high degree of symmetry @xcite .    in summary",
    ", we have shown that inp islands have a rich electronic structure , with holes confined to multiple pockets in and around the island .",
    "the energy levels are consistent with measurements on single dots , and the calculated structure can produce two pl lines @xmath61 apart . while the predicted doubling of pl lines provides an important existence proof , more work is needed to fully explain the puzzling proliferation of lines seen in experiments ."
