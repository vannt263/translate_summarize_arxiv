    "this paper considers a class of markov decision processes ( mdps ) known as _ bandits _ , which are models for the optimal dynamic allocation of a resource to a stochastic _ project _ admitting two modes of operation , called _ active _ and",
    "_ passive_. we will hence use the terms `` bandit '' and `` project '' interchangeably .",
    "the focus will be on the discrete time infinite horizon real state case , under the discounted optimality criterion .",
    "we thus consider a project whose state @xmath0 evolves across the state space @xmath1 , which is an interval of the real line @xmath2 . at the start of period @xmath3 , the state @xmath4",
    "is observed and then a _ control action _",
    "@xmath5 is selected , where @xmath6 ( resp .",
    "@xmath7 ) models the project being operated in the active ( resp .",
    "passive ) mode . if @xmath8 then ( i ) the project is allocated @xmath9 resource units and yields a reward @xmath10 in period @xmath11 , both of which being discounted with factor @xmath12 ; and ( ii ) the state moves to @xmath13 according to a markov transition law @xmath14 . both the reward and the resource consumption functions @xmath10 and @xmath9",
    "may be unbounded , under certain assumptions .",
    "actions are selected through a _",
    "control policy _",
    "@xmath15 from the class @xmath16 of _ admissible policies _ , which are history - dependent randomized .",
    "suppose that a price @xmath17 is charged per unit resource used , so @xmath18 $ ] is the expected net project value starting from state @xmath19 under policy @xmath20 .",
    "consider the following parametric collection of _ @xmath17-price problems _ : for @xmath21 ,    @xmath22    note that that a policy @xmath23 is _",
    "@xmath24-optimal _ if @xmath25 for each state @xmath19 .      the project ( or , more properly , the problem collection @xmath26 ) is called _ indexable _ with _ index _",
    "@xmath27 if , for every price @xmath17 and state @xmath19 : ( i ) the active action is @xmath24-optimal in state @xmath19 if and only if @xmath28 ; and ( ii ) the passive action is @xmath24-optimal in state @xmath19 if and only if @xmath29 .",
    "such an _ indexability _ property has played a fundamental role in the study of bandit models .",
    "it was first identified in _ classic bandits _ , in which the state does not change under the passive action , with the resource consumption function being @xmath30 , in the pioneering work of @xcite and @xcite on models for the sequential design of experiments .",
    "classic bandits are generally indexable . in a celebrated result ,",
    "@xcite used such an index to obtain an optimal policy for the long - standing _ multi - armed bandit problem _ ( mabp ) , involving a finite collection of projects , one of which must be active at each time , under the infinite horizon discounted reward criterion .",
    "they showed that the _ priority index rule _ that engages at each time a project of currently largest index value is optimal .",
    "see also @xcite .",
    "the index of classic bandits , known as the _ gittins index _ , and its multiple applications , have been the subject of extensive research attention .",
    "see , e.g. , the surveys @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "the concept of indexability was extended in the seminal work of @xcite from classic to _ restless bandits _ , which can change state while passive",
    ", in which case the literature properly refers to the _ whittle index_. @xcite considers an extension of the mabp where projects are restless and a fixed number of them must be active at each time , a version of the generally intractable ( see @xcite ) _ restless mabp _ ( rmabp ) , motivating it with several applications such as aircraft surveillance and dynamic worker selection .",
    "if the projects are all indexable , whittle proposed to give higher priority for being engaged to those with currently larger index values .",
    "although such a _ whittle index policy _ is generally suboptimal for the rmabp , it possesses ( see @xcite ) a form of asymptotic optimality under certain conditions .",
    "yet , as pointed out in @xcite , unlike classic bandits , restless bandits need not be indexable .",
    "further , @xcite considers a relaxed problem whose optimal policy is given in terms of individual project indices under indexability , and which can be used to bound the original problem s optimal value .    due to the broad modeling power of the rmabp and the practical appeal of whittle s index policy ,",
    "a large body of work has investigated over the last quarter century its application to a wide variety of models , often reporting a nearly optimal performance in simulation studies . for a sample of such work see , e.g. , ( * ? ? ? * ch .",
    "14.7 ) , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .    to apply the whittle index policy to a particular rmabp model , two roadblocks must be overcome : the first is to establish indexability for the constituent projects ; the second is to devise an efficient index - computing scheme .",
    "typically , researchers have tackled both issues through ad hoc approaches that exploit the special structure of the model at hand .",
    "in contrast , a general approach to resolve such roadblocks in discrete state projects has been developed in @xcite , giving sufficient indexability conditions for a generic project , which can be checked analytically or numerically , along with an index algorithm .",
    "their validity follows from satisfaction by project performance metrics of _ partial conservation laws _ ( pcls ) , also introduced in that work , whence we refer to _ pcl - indexability conditions_. pcls are an extension of the conservation laws satisfied by certain stochastic scheduling models , including the mabp , which have been used to establish the optimality of index policies .",
    "see , e.g. , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and the survey @xcite .      while most work to date on applications of the ( r)mabp has considered discrete state models , the study of models with real state projects has attracted increasing attention over the last decade .",
    "@xcite surveys applications of the ( r)mabp to partially observable mdp ( pomdp ) sensor management models , noting the difficulties caused by real state spaces and stating that  part of the difficulty of applying restless bandit methods may lie in the difficulty of checking whittle s indexability conditions  and the likelihood that these conditions are not satisfied for typical sensor management problems . \"    even in the classic case , computation of the gittins index raises significant challenges for real state projects .",
    "@xcite consider a pomdp multi - target tracking model formulated as a mabp with real state projects , and give a value iteration scheme to approximately compute the index .",
    "@xcite extend such results to a general pomdp setting , and give more efficient algorithms for the gittins index under certain assumptions .",
    "@xcite formulate the problem of dynamic beam scheduling of a phased array radar to minimize the tracking error of two targets as a rmabp with real state projects with deterministic dynamics .",
    "they point out the lack of methods to address the indexability issue in such a setting , and focus on identifying conditions under which a one - step greedy policy is optimal .",
    "@xcite and @xcite address equivalent rmabp models , though motivated by different applications .",
    "@xcite consider the optimal dynamic allocation of @xmath31 mobile sensors to track @xmath32 targets with independent binary state markov dynamics .",
    "a target s state is known only when sensed .",
    "otherwise , only the _ information state _ is known , giving the probability that the target is in one of the states .",
    "a pomdp model is considered , which is reformulated as a rmabp where the projects ( targets ) have as state space the interval @xmath33 $ ] on which the information state lies .",
    "indexability is established under the discounted criterion by exploiting special properties of the optimal value function for the single - project @xmath17-price subproblems ( [ eq:0lpricepfg1 ] ) , and the whittle index is evaluated in closed form . @xcite consider the optimal dynamic allocation of @xmath31 sensors to sense and transmit packets through @xmath34 parallel communication channels evolving as binary state ( good or bad ) markov chains , with the channel state being known only when sensed . while the model is equivalent to that in @xcite , @xcite establish indexability , under the discounted and the long - run average criteria , through a different approach based on bounding a project s total passive time under an optimal policy .",
    "both @xcite and @xcite report a nearly optimal performance for the whittle index policy .",
    "@xcite establish indexability for a class of restless bandits where the active action resets the system evolution , extending results in @xcite and in @xcite .",
    "@xcite consider a continuous time rmabp model subject to kalman filter dynamics , and establish indexability in the case of real state projects by exploiting the model s structure .",
    "simulation results are reported showing that the whittle index policy is near optimal .",
    "the conference papers @xcite introduce an extension to real state projects of the general pcl - based sufficient indexability conditions and index evaluation scheme developed in @xcite for discrete state projects , demonstrating through numerical experiments their applicability to the models considered in @xcite and @xcite . see also @xcite .",
    "yet , no proofs establishing the validity of the proposed indexability conditions for real state projects are given in such work .",
    "motivated by the above , the major goal of this paper is to provide a general approach for establishing indexability and evaluating the index of a project , by laying down a rigorous foundation to the general pcl - based sufficient indexability conditions and index evaluation scheme for real state projects outlined in the above referenced work , with proofs for all results .",
    "our main result is the _ verification theorem _ in theorem [ the : pcliii ] , ensuring the indexability of a project under certain conditions with its whittle index being given by a so - called _ marginal productivity _ ( mp ) index , which , unlike the whittle index , is explicitly defined .",

    "theorem [ the : pcliii ] states that a project satisfying ( pcli1pcli3 ) is indexable with index @xmath45 .",
    "this result reduces the task of establishing a project s indexability to the _ performance analysis _ problem of verifying certain properties of project metrics under threshold policies , and further provides an explicit expression for the index .",

    "proposition [ pro : mpirnd ] characterizes the mp index as a _ radon  nikodm derivative _ under pcl - indexability .",
    "the geometric and economic interpretation of the mp index is clarified in proposition [ pro : phipgder ] , which characterizes the mp index as a _ resource shadow price _ under pcl - indexability .",
    "this extends corresponding results in @xcite for discrete state projects .",
    "note that the pcl - indexability conditions developed in @xcite for discrete state projects correspond to ( pcli1 , pcli2 ) only , which are shown there to imply ( pcli3 ) . in the present setting , since ( pcli3 ) may be hard to verify , we give propositions [ pro : pwdifffg ] and [ pro:1cpcli3 ] , which ensure that ( pcli3 ) holds provided ( pcli1 , pcli2 ) and some additional simpler conditions hold .",
    "further , proposition [ pro : cfhmpi ] gives a recursion for computing the mp index in cases where it can not be evaluated in closed form .",
