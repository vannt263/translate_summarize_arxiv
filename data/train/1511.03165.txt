    "since the experimental realization of bose - einstein condensation ( bec ) in harmonically confined ultra - cold alkali atomic vapors @xcite , there has been attempts to examine the role of various energy scales in the physics of many - boson systems @xcite . with recent advances in bec on optical lattices @xcite and microchip trap @xcite , the few - body systems have attracted particular attention of theorists @xcite .",
    "the experimental control over parameters such as density , effective dimensionality and the atom - atom interaction strength @xcite , enables one to examine their effects on the quantum many - body states .",
    "recent theoretical studies have demonstrated that the breathing mode in a trapped atomic vapor system @xcite is ideally suited as a diagnostic tool for probing quantum many - body effects @xcite .",
    "+ for dilute gas systems at low - enough temperatures , the interparticle interaction being short - ranged is usually described by zero - range ( @xmath2-function ) potential @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , such an interaction potential in 2d is not self - adjoint @xcite and can not be used in a manner analogous to its one dimensional counterpart .",
    "indeed a regularized 2d contact potential is analytically tractable @xcite but harder to handle numerically .",
    "further , as the number of particles is increased beyond two , the analytical treatment becomes intractable , leaving one only with a numerical recourse .",
    "+ it has been demonstrated that in order to tackle the limit of zero - range interaction numerically @xcite , a prohibitively large hilbert space is required to obtain the ground state and the low - lying excited states . for numerical many - body simulations ,",
    "one usually prefers a smooth , finite - range , model interaction potential .",
    "this leads us to use the finite - range gaussian potential as a model interparticle interaction in many - body simulations @xcite , for trapped interacting few - boson system . more control over the interparticle interaction with the variation of interaction range and being expandable within finite number of basis functions of the hilbert space , are few of the advantages of the gaussian potential over the usual @xmath2-function potential .",
    "+ in this note , we present an exact diagonalization study of quasi - two - dimensional system of @xmath0 spinless bosons interacting via finite - range gaussian potential .",
    "the exact diagonalization of the many - body hamiltonian matrix is performed using beyond lowest - landau - level approximation , to obtain the low - lying energy spectrum of ultra - cold bose gas in a harmonic trap .",
    "our approach involves the inclusion of lower as well as higher landau levels with single - particle angular momentum @xmath3 of either sign for construction of @xmath0-body basis function @xcite .",
    "the results obtained demonstrate that the use of ( repulsive ) particle - particle gaussian interaction has a dramatic effect on various properties of the bose - condensed gas . + this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ model ] , we describe the model hamiltonian for bose gas with repulsive finite - range gaussian interaction potential , confined in a quasi - two - dimension harmonic trap .",
    "we then introduce the single - particle reduced density matrix to delineate the criterion for the existence of bose - einstein condensate .",
    "we offer a justification for the use of gaussian interaction potential in our exact diagonalization calculation , instead of the usual contact ( @xmath2-function ) potential . in sec .",
    "[ results ] , we present the exact results for a system of @xmath0 bosons , to explore the finite - range effect of two - body gaussian interaction potential , on the many - body ground state as well as on the first breathing mode collective excitation of the system . finally , in sec .  [ conc ] , we summarize our results and conclusions of the present study .",
    "we consider a system of @xmath0 interacting spinless bosons each of mass @xmath4 , trapped in a harmonic potential @xmath5 . here ,",
    "@xmath6 is the radial distance of a particle from the trap center ; @xmath7 and @xmath8 are the radial and axial frequencies respectively , of the harmonic confinement .",
    "the trapping potential @xmath9 is assumed to be highly anisotropic with @xmath10 so that the many - body dynamics along @xmath11-axis is frozen .",
    "the system is thus effectively quasi - two - dimensional ( quasi-2d ) with @xmath12-@xmath13 rotational symmetry .",
    "choosing @xmath14 as the unit of energy and @xmath15 the corresponding unit length , the many - body hamiltonian in dimensionless form is given by @xmath16   + \\frac{1}{2 } \\sum_{i\\neq j}^{n } u \\left({\\bf r}_{i},{\\bf r}_{j}\\right ) \\label{mbh}\\ ] ] the first two terms in the hamiltonian  ( [ mbh ] ) correspond to the kinetic and potential energies respectively , and the third term arises from the particle - particle interaction . at low - enough temperatures ,",

    "the dimensionless parameter @xmath21 measures the strength of the two - body interaction with @xmath22 being the @xmath1-wave scattering length for particle - particle collision .",
    "we assume that the scattering length is positive @xmath23 so that the effective finite - range interaction is repulsive .",
    "the above gaussian interaction potential  ( [ gip ] ) is expandable within a finite number of single - particle basis functions and hence computationally more feasible @xcite , compared to the zero - range @xmath2-function potential . in the limit @xmath24 , the normalized gaussian potential in eq .",
    "( [ gip ] ) reduces to the zero - range contact potential @xmath25 @xcite .",
    "+ it is to be noted that for a many - body system under consideration here , the characteristic energy scale for the interaction is determined by the dimensionless parameter @xmath26 .",
    "owing to the increasing dimensionality of the hilbert space with @xmath0 , making computation impractical , we vary @xmath22 so as to achieve a suitable value of @xmath27 relevant to experimental situation @xcite . to obtain the eigenenergies @xmath28 and the corresponding eigenstates @xmath29 of the @xmath0-boson system , we employ exact diagonalization of the hamiltonian matrix using davidson algorithm @xcite with inclusion of lower as well as higher landau levels in the construction of @xmath0-body basis states @xcite .",

    "is assumed to be normalized ; one can then determine the single - particle reduced density matrix @xmath32 , by integrating out the degrees of freedom of @xmath33 particles .",
    "thus @xmath34 the above expression is written in terms of single - particle basis functions @xmath35 with quantum number @xmath36 .",
    "being hermitian , this can be diagonalized to give @xmath37 where @xmath38 and @xmath39 with @xmath40 .",
    "the @xmath41 are the eigenvalues , ordered as above , and @xmath42 the corresponding eigenvectors of the single - particle reduced density matrix @xmath43 ; each @xmath44 defines a fraction of the bose - einstein condensate .",
    "we consider a system of @xmath45 bosonic atoms of @xmath46rb in a quasi-2d harmonic trap with confining frequency @xmath47 hz and the @xmath11-asymmetry parameter @xmath48 .",
    "the condensate has extension @xmath49 in the @xmath11-direction and its dynamics along this axis is taken to be completely frozen .",
    "recent advancements in atomic physics have made it possible to tune the low - energy atom - atom scattering length in ultra - cold atomic vapors using feshbach resonance @xcite .",
    "accordingly in the calculations presented here , the parameters of the two - body interaction potential  ( [ gip ] ) have been chosen as the range @xmath50 ( in units of @xmath20 ) and the @xmath1-wave scattering length @xmath51 where , @xmath52 is the bohr radius .",
    "the corresponding value of the dimensionless interaction parameter @xmath53 turns out to be @xmath54 . from now on we fix the value of dimensionless interaction parameter @xmath55 and vary the value of gaussian width @xmath19 from @xmath56 to @xmath57 ( in units of @xmath20 ) .",
    "our results obtained through exact diagonalization with repulsive gaussian interaction potential allow us to study the effect of the range @xmath19 of interparticle interaction on various properties of the bose - condensed gas , as discussed in the following .      in this subsection",
    ", we examine the behavior of ground state energy and degree of condensation with the range of interaction varied over @xmath58 for the repulsive finite - range gaussian interaction potential  ( [ gip ] ) .",
    "the ground state energy per particle @xmath59 _ versus _ the range @xmath19 ( in units of @xmath20 ) of gaussian interaction potential with interaction parameter @xmath55 for a system of @xmath45 trapped bosons .",
    "the limiting case @xmath60 corresponds to contact ( @xmath2-function ) interaction potential . ]     + in fig .",
    "[ gse ] , we plot the ground state energy per particle @xmath59 as a function of the range @xmath19 of the repulsive interaction potential with @xmath55 for @xmath45 bosons . as is observed from the figure that the ground state energy changes very little for small values of @xmath19 , but exhibits a monotonic decrease ( enhancing the phase rigidity of the condensate ) as @xmath19 is further increased over the range @xmath61 , in units of @xmath20 . for larger values of @xmath62 ( not shown in the figure ) , the ground state energy is found to approach the non - interacting value .",
    "+ to further examine the effect of @xmath19 on quantum mechanical phase coherence of the bose - condensed gas , we calculate the single - particle density matrix defined in eq .",
    "( [ spd ] ) , where the eigenvalues have been normalized to 1 .",
    "it is to be noted that the usual definition of condensation for a macroscopic system , given by the largest eigenvalue @xmath63 of the single - particle reduced density matrix , is not appropriate for systems with small number of particles being studied here .",
    "for example , in the absence of condensation , there is no macroscopic occupation of a single quantum state and all levels are equally occupied , such a definition would imply a condensate fraction with small magnitude . to circumvent this situation ,",
    "one introduces a quantity which is sensitive to the loss of macroscopic occupation called the degree of condensation defined as @xmath64 where @xmath65 is the mean of the rest of eigenvalues .",
    "it can be seen that the degree of condensation , defined in eq .",
    "( [ doc ] ) , approaches zero for equal eigenvalues , as one would expect .",
    "the degree of condensation @xmath66 of the ground state as a function of interaction range @xmath19 ( in units of @xmath20 ) with interaction parameter @xmath55 for a system of @xmath45 trapped bosons . ]",
    "+ in fig .",
    "[ gsc ] , we present the variation of degree of condensation @xmath66 with interaction range @xmath19 for a system of @xmath45 bosons .",
    "it is seen from the figure that the degree of condensation increases with increase in @xmath19 and the variation becomes nearly linear for larger values of @xmath67 .",
    "the explanation for such a behavior is that as the range @xmath19 of the gaussian interaction potential increases , the interparticle potential begin to overlap leading to increase in many - body effects .",
    "this increased many - body effect compared to the zero - range ( @xmath2-function ) potential leads to an enhanced phase coherence , reflected in increased degree of condensation .",
    "it was pointed out by pitaevskii and rosch @xcite that a purely 2d harmonically confined bose gas interacting via a zero - range ( @xmath2-function ) interaction potential , exhibits breathing modes arising from @xmath68 symmetry .",
    "this underlying symmetry leads to an energy spectrum , generating eigenmodes with energy spacing of @xmath69 between two adjacent breathing modes .",
    "although in the present work , the finite - range interaction potential has been used in place of the zero - range interaction , the feature of @xmath69 spacing in the energy eigenspectrum , is seen to persist for certain range of values of @xmath70 for the gaussian interaction potential  ( [ gip ] ) .",
    "for instance , the energy spacing between the excited state @xmath71 and the ground state @xmath72 for @xmath45 bosons is @xmath73 ( in units of @xmath14 ) with @xmath74 and @xmath55 ( corresponding to @xmath75 ) .     for @xmath45 bosons , the energy @xmath76 ( in units of @xmath14 ) of the first breathing mode _ versus _ the interaction range @xmath19 ( in units of @xmath20 ) of the gaussian potential with fixed value of the interaction parameter @xmath55 ( parametrized by @xmath22 ) .",
    "the energy value of breathing mode is @xmath77 , where @xmath71 is the energy of excited state and @xmath72 is the energy of ground state of the system . ]",
    "+ next , we examine the effect of @xmath70 on the eigenenergy of the first breathing mode and observe that the value of the eigenmode @xmath77 deviates from @xmath69 which is the value strictly for @xmath2-function interaction ( @xmath78 ) in 2d .",
    "figure  [ bme ] presents the variation of @xmath76 ( in units of @xmath14 ) with the interaction range @xmath19 of the gaussian potential with @xmath55 for a system of @xmath45 bosons .",
    "it is observed from the figure that with increasing @xmath19 , the repulsive gaussian interaction , in general , lowers the value of the first breathing mode @xmath76 from @xmath79 . for small values of interaction range @xmath80 , the value of @xmath76 stays close to @xmath69 . in the interval @xmath81 , the finite - range effect of the interaction potential",
    "is prominently seen and the values of @xmath76 deviate appreciably from @xmath69 .",
    "however , it is observed that when @xmath19 approaches the system size @xmath20 , the value of @xmath76 saturates to a value appreciably less than @xmath69 . in other words , with increasing @xmath19 as the gaussian interaction potential deviates from the @xmath2-function potential , the breathing mode value exhibits a corresponding deviation from the value @xmath82 for a strictly 2d zero - range interaction potential .",
    "in the present study , we have studied a system of @xmath45 , harmonically confined bosons in quasi-2d , interacting via finite - range gaussian potential , through exact diagonalization in beyond lowest - landau - level approximation to analyze its ground state and the first breathing mode .",
    "the low - lying energy eigenstates were obtained as the width @xmath19 of the repulsive gaussian interaction potential is varied over the range from zero ( corresponding to @xmath2-function potential ) to system size .",
    "we studied the dependence of ground state energy , the first breathing mode and the degree of condensation on the range @xmath19 of the interaction potential .",
    "it was observed that the ground state energy decreases as the interaction range is increased .",
    "it was also observed that increase in the width of gaussian interaction potential monotonously enhances the degree of condensation compared to the zero - range interaction potential .",
    "further , the range @xmath19 of the interaction potential also affects the energy of the first breathing mode ( collective excitation ) . with increasing width @xmath19 , as the gaussian interaction potential deviates from the @xmath2-function potential ,",
    "the breathing mode value exhibits a corresponding deviation from the value @xmath82 for a strictly 2d zero - range interaction potential .",
    "the results of the present work suggest the suitability of finite - range gaussian interaction potential as model of the two - body interaction and may therefore profitably be employed in simulation studies of quasi-2d confined interacting bosons .",
