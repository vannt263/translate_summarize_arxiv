    "we choose @xmath23 gev and @xmath24 gev as our benchmark point .",
    "these masses are larger than an analysis of @xmath1 in @xcite , and we choose to work in the alignment limit of a 2hdm .",
    "the couplings of @xmath4 and @xmath10 to @xmath25 and @xmath19 are model dependent and could be larger or smaller than the corresponding @xmath5 couplings . for our benchmark point",
    "we set these @xmath4 and @xmath10 couplings to be the same as those for @xmath5 . in this case , since the @xmath26 coupling is well determined , we have @xmath27 and @xmath28 .",
    "other competing decay modes can be small in the alignment limit and by ignoring them we obtain the values of @xmath29 and @xmath30 used in the following .",
    "we note that if @xmath31 is decreased then both of these branching ratios increase .",
    "we use the @xcite 2hdm model in @xcite ( in the alignment limit ) interfaced with + + 2.7.1 @xcite to generate the showered and decayed signal events .",
    "heavy higgs production proceeds through @xmath32 and @xmath33 .",
    "our event selection is a follows .",
    "jets , including @xmath19-tags and @xmath20-tags , are required to have @xmath34 gev and @xmath35 .",
    "muons ( electrons ) are required to have @xmath34 gev and @xmath36 . for lepton isolation",
    "we require the @xmath37 sum of tracks within a cone of @xmath38 to be less than 0.16 of the lepton @xmath37 .",
    "we also implement some standard overlap removals involving lepton pairs or lepton - jet pairs .",
    "we then apply the following sequence of cuts .",
    "the dominant backgrounds are from @xmath0 and @xmath46 production .",
    "we use 5_a@ @xcite to generate events for these processes at nlo which are then passed through + + for showering and decay .",
    "the @ method produces events with negative weight and we account for this in the analysis .",
    "the cut flows in table [ mine1 ] show that the cuts effectively suppress the @xmath0 background . for the production cross sections we take @xmath47 pb , @xmath48 pb and @xmath49 pb . the first is twice the lo value for @xmath50 production ( to model higher order contributions ) while the latter two are the nlo values . after incorporating the branching ratios as well we arrive at the numbers of the last row . for 100 fb@xmath51",
    "the signal numbers are large , as is @xmath52 , so the significance is limited by systematics in the background estimate . assuming that the standard model backgrounds can be determined through the use of control regions to within [ 15% , 10% ]",
    ", this would correspond to a signal significance of [ 1.7 , 2.6 ] for and [ 1.3 , 2.0 ] for .",
    "these results may be scaled by factors that relate different choices of the production cross section and @xmath29 and @xmath30 to our choices .",
    "the results can be expected to improve if @xmath31 is smaller relative to @xmath53 .",
    "we note that @xmath57 produces a larger high energy tail in the lepton @xmath37 distribution , at least for some mass combinations , and this could in the future provide a way of distinguishing the signal from that of @xmath58 production .    for both cases a and b we can expect updates from run 2 of the searches that we have used from run 1 , and it will be straightforward to recast these new results to further constrain heavy higgs and new leptons .",

    "<S> for a heavy higgs boson above the @xmath0 threshold we consider three decay modes that could compete with decay to @xmath0 , even in the alignment limit of a 2-higgs doublet model . </S>",
    "<S> the decays @xmath1 , @xmath2 and @xmath3 show that heavy higgs decays can be an effective probe of new physics both within and beyond this model .    </S>",
    "<S> a heavy higgs @xmath4 may quite likely decay predominantly into @xmath0 when its mass is above this threshold , and this decay faces a daunting @xmath0 background . if the properties of the 125 gev higgs boson @xmath5 continue to converge to standard model expectations then it is less likely that some other decay modes of @xmath4 will be able to compete with the @xmath0 decay mode . </S>",
    "<S> this is because the suppression of these other decay modes is correlated with the standard - model - like properties of @xmath5 in the alignment limit of a 2-higgs doublet model . </S>",
    "<S> the suppressed decay modes are @xmath6 , @xmath7 , @xmath8 and @xmath9 where @xmath4 and @xmath10 are cp even and odd .    in this study </S>",
    "<S> we consider three decays that are not suppressed in the alignment limit .    * </S>",
    "<S> @xmath11 * @xmath12 * @xmath13    the first is a standard decay within the 2-higgs doublet model , while the other two show how heavy higgs decay may serve as a discovery channel for new particles . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath14 we consider does not couple to the first two families and so other production modes are suppressed . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath15 is a new heavy lepton with weak decays and is otherwise only weakly produced .    </S>",
    "<S> we assume the intermediate particles are on shell . for @xmath1 </S>",
    "<S> this requires a suitably large mass splitting between @xmath4 and @xmath10 . </S>",
    "<S> this splitting is determined by a certain combination of quartic couplings that survives in the alignment limit . </S>",
    "<S> in addition this splitting survives a @xmath16 symmetry limit of the higgs potential , unlike the mass splitting between @xmath4 and @xmath17 . </S>",
    "<S> as described in @xcite there is some preference for the relations @xmath18 .    as </S>",
    "<S> yet there has been no dedicated searches for any of these decay modes . in the first two cases we shall consider limits that can be set from the 13 tev run 2 at the lhc , and we describe cut based analyses that quite significantly increase these signals relative to background . </S>",
    "<S> the third case gives rise to a variety of multi - lepton final states such that strong limits can already be set with searches conducted in run 1 .    </S>",
    "<S> for the first two searches it will be important to realistically model @xmath19-tagging and @xmath20-tagging efficiencies in the detector simulation . </S>",
    "<S> we shall use 3 @xcite in two different ways for comparison purposes . </S>",
    "<S> 1.1.13 @xcite - tagging bug was fixed in version 1.1.13 . ] </S>",
    "<S> uses a modified version of 3.0.10 that incorporates a set of efficiencies and other settings to more realistically model the detector . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath19-tagging model is specified by a @xmath19-tag efficiency that we take to be 70% . for @xmath20-tagging </S>",
    "<S> we choose the ` medium ' efficiency model along with a unit charge requirement . </S>",
    "<S> we then carry out our cut - based analysis within the framework . </S>",
    "<S> we note that has been validated against quite a large and growing number of analyses , many of which involve @xmath19-tagging and at least one where @xmath20-tagging plays an essential role . </S>",
    "<S> thus the results we obtain from it can be considered fairly realistic .    </S>",
    "<S> our second use of is based on stand - alone 3.1.2 . </S>",
    "<S> we use the latest default detector card which includes a modeling of the jet energy scale . </S>",
    "<S> we also incorporate the efficiency for @xmath19-tag , @xmath21-jets and light jets that was used in a 5 @xcite implementation and validation @xcite of a certain analysis . on the other hand @xmath20-tagging </S>",
    "<S> is more crudely implemented by stand - alone and we adopt the default 40% constant efficiency . </S>",
    "<S> then on the resulting root file we use 5 to apply the same cut based analysis as before . </S>"
