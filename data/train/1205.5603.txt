    "this paper investigates multi - way relay channels ( mwrcs ) where multiple users exchange correlated data via a relay .",
    "more specifically , each user is to send its data to all other users .",
    "there is no direct link among the users , and hence the users first transmit to a relay , which processes its received information and transmits back to the users ( refer to fig .  [",
    "fig : mwrc ] ) .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to find the set of all achievable rates , which are defined as the number of channel uses required to reliably ( in the usual shannon sense ) exchange each message tuple .    the joint source - channel coding problem in fig .",
    "[ fig : mwrc ] includes , as special cases , the source coding work of wyner et al .",
    "@xcite and the channel capacity work of ong et al .",
    "separately , the shannon limits of source coding  @xcite ( through noiseless channel ) and of channel coding  @xcite ( with independent sources ) are well established .",
    "however , these limits have not yet been discovered for noisy channels with correlated sources in general . for three users , ong et al .",
    "@xcite gave sufficient conditions for reliable communication using the separate source - channel coding paradigm .",
    "the key result of  @xcite was to show that these sufficient conditions are also necessary for a special class of source distributions , hence giving the set of all achievable rates .",
    "the class was characterized by an almost balanced conditional mutual information ( abcmi ) condition .",
    "this paper extends the abcmi concept to more than three users , and shows that if the sources have abcmi , then the set of all achievable rates can be found .",
    "while the abcmi condition for the three - user case is expressed in terms of the standard shannon information measure , we will use _",
    "i_-measure  ( * ? ? ?",
    "3 ) for more then three users  using shannon s measure is possible but the expressions would be much more complicated . though the abcmi condition limits the class of sources for which the set of all achievable rates is found , this paper provides the following insights : ( i ) as achievability is derived based on a separate source - channel coding architecture , we show that source - channel separation is optimal for finite field mwrc with sources having abcmi . (",
    "ii ) since abcmi are constraints on the sources , the results in this paper are potentially useful for other channel models ( not restricted to the finite field model ) .",

    "for this reason , we specify this condition later in section  [ section : abcmi ] after giving a brief review of the @xmath33-measure in section  [ section : i - measure ] . for now , it suffices to note that it is a non - trivial constraint placed on the joint distribution of @xmath31 .",
