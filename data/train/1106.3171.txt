    "in quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) there are two effects that lead to violations of isospin symmetry .",
    "first , the electromagnetic interaction between quarks , and hence that between protons ( @xmath3 ) and neutrons ( @xmath4 ) , does not respect the symmetry : @xmath5 is different from @xmath6 and @xmath7 .",
    "second , the difference between up and down quark masses ( @xmath8 ) means that isospin symmetry is violated even in the absence of electromagnetic forces . the existence of results in , for instance , different nucleon masses , which has profound consequences for nucleosynthesis in the early universe , and nuclear physics in general  @xcite .",
    "a better understanding of isospin - symmetry breaking is therefore of deep interest to nuclear physics , and nuclear physicists .",
    "there has been much recent progress in this direction , with experiments at triumf and iucf exploring novel signatures of the violation of isospin symmetry , see ref .",
    "@xcite for a review .",
    "the effect of isospin violation is significant in the nucleon - nucleon ( nn ) scattering lengths .",
    "that is because these scattering lengths are the result of fine tuning between the range and depth of the nuclear potential , and so small differences in either can lead to appreciable shifts in the scattering lengths . in a world of an isospin - symmetry - conserving interaction , both the neutron - neutron ( @xmath9 ) and the proton - proton ( @xmath10 ) channel are degenerate with the @xmath11 neutron - proton ( @xmath12 ) channel , because for two like fermions in a relative s wave , fermi statistics allow for a spin - singlet , total spin @xmath13 state only .",
    "hence , even relatively weak isospin - violating interactions could have a significant effect on the @xmath14 system .",
    "the values of the proton - proton and neutron - proton scattering lengths , @xmath15 are quite well established , see table  [ tab.input ] . for charged particles , @xmath1 is observable as the leading - order ( lo ) parameter in a generalized effective - range expansion that includes the effects of the non - zero coulomb repulsion in the asymptotic states .",
    "in contrast , @xmath10 phase shifts , and hence the @xmath10 scattering length , obtained exclusively from the strong part of the @xmath10 interaction retain a residual dependence on the specific model for this short - range force , _",
    "i.e. _ , they are dependent upon the renormalization scale and scheme  @xcite .",
    "experiment reveals the differences between @xmath1 , @xmath16 , and @xmath1 , and thus that charge independence and charge symmetry are both broken .",
    "charge independence is associated with an arbitrary rotation in isospin space while charge symmetry is conserved if a rotation about @xmath17 in isospin space leaves observables invariant ( see , _ e.g. _  @xcite ) .",
    "current data allows for a relatively accurate extraction of @xmath18 and @xmath10 scattering lengths , compared to the @xmath9 parameter where the uncertainty is about two orders of magnitude larger ( see tab .",
    "[ tab.input ] ) . for a recent , thorough review of the status of experiments",
    "see ref .",
    "direct measurements are on the horizon  @xcite , but until now constraints on @xmath19 come from final - state interactions .",
    "however , conflicting values for @xmath19 have resulted from attempts to follow this avenue in different few - nucleon reactions  indeed , conflicting values have resulted from different experiments investigating final - state interactions in @xmath20 .    to extract @xmath19 accurately from this three - body deuteron - breakup experiment , the outgoing particles should predominantly be in a state of very low neutron - neutron relative momentum .",
    "furthermore , the proton s effect on the detected neutron pair should be minimal .",
    "this condition is satisfied for a large separation of the scattered pair from the proton which remains at rest in the lab frame after the collision .",
    "this takes place in the @xmath9 quasi - free scattering ( qfs ) kinematics .",
    "the cross sections corresponding to this and the analogous @xmath18-qfs configuration constitute the experimental input for the subsequent extraction of @xmath19 . currently , there are two data sets from which an identical theoretical method extracts conflicting values for @xmath19 .",
    "one setup records kinematical information of one neutron and the proton  @xcite yielding @xmath21fm , while the other detects all three outgoing nucleons  @xcite and produces @xmath22 .",
    "the theoretical model employs the cd - bonn  @xcite nn potential and the charge - independent tm  @xcite three - nucleon interaction . recently",
    ", the sensitivity of theoretical predictions for the @xmath9 qfs cross section was investigated  @xcite .",
    "there it was shown that the @xmath9-qfs cross section has a stronger dependence on @xmath23 relative to changes in @xmath24after all , both experiments deal with small yet non - zero @xmath9 energies , and so @xmath23 would be expected to play some role .",
    "@xcite found values of @xmath19 and @xmath23 that plausibly fit both sets and would resolve the discrepancy , albeit at the expense of introducing appreciable charge - symmetry breaking in the nucleon - nucleon effective ranges .    in view of these complications",
    "another way to  measure \" @xmath19 would be of great interest . here the effective field theory without explicit pions , , is used to show that the difference of @xmath9 and @xmath10 scattering lengths , @xmath25 , is correlated with the trition - helium-3 binding - energy difference , @xmath26 .",
    "this correlation has been known for many years within the context of models of the nn interaction .",
    "see , e.g.  refs .",
    "@xcite , and ref .",
    "@xcite , which contains a review of work up until 1990 . however , in these works various models , each of which produce a specific @xmath19 , were used to compute @xmath27 .",
    "the possibility of mapping out the general relationship and using the result to constrain @xmath19 was not explored . here",
    "we develop the correlation between @xmath28 and @xmath27 within a leading - order  calculation , which shows that this correlation stems solely from the existence of large scattering lengths in the nn system .",
    "we give an indication of how higher - order corrections can be expected to impact our result , and hence derive a constraint on @xmath19 , using the value of @xmath1 given in table  [ tab.input ] .",
    "in general , for systems where the scattering length @xmath29 , is much larger than the range of the interaction @xmath30 , an effective field theory based on the scale separation @xmath31 can be used to derive model - independent results  @xcite . in nuclear physics",
    "this is , and it is an expansion in @xmath32 , with @xmath29 given by the numbers in table  [ tab.input ] .  can be used to derive",
    " universal \" results that rely only on the existence of large scattering lengths .",
    "it has been used to compute triton ( @xmath33 ) , helium-4 ( @xmath34 ) , and helium-6 binding energies  @xcite . at leading order in the @xmath32 expansion",
    "there are three parameters in the eft that then yield predictions for all other observables in systems with @xmath35 : these can be taken to be the spin - singlet and spin - triplet nn scattering lengths , and the binding energy of the three - nucleon system . at next - to - leading order ( nlo ) in the @xmath32 expansion the nn effective ranges enter the problem , with all other low - energy nn parameters only affecting answers beyond nlo  @xcite .",
    "this specifies the general eft prescription of fitting a minimal set of lecs to observables in order to make predictions for all other observables correlated to the input set .    in particular ,  provides a map from an input set , _",
    "e.g. _ , the scattering length @xmath36 , to a correlated set , whose elements , _",
    "e.g. _ , the deuteron binding energy @xmath37 , are predicted with known theoretical uncertainty .",
    "however , even if this set of correlations is well mapped out in the @xmath38-body system there appears to be no rigorous way to determine _ a priori _ whether @xmath39-body observables will also be correlated with the @xmath38-body input quantities .",
    "for example , the triton binding energy @xmath33 is _ not _ correlated with the @xmath18 singlet and triplet scattering lengths @xmath40  @xcite , while the binding energy of the @xmath41 particle _ is _ correlated with @xmath42  @xcite . for @xmath33 , a strong sensitivity to short - distance structure ",
    "parameterized , for instance , by a momentum - space cutoff @xmath43is found , while the dependence of @xmath34 on @xmath43 is parametrically small once the value of @xmath33 is fixed .",
    "this latter phenomenon , known as the tjon line  @xcite , allows for a prediction of the @xmath41-particle binding energy once that of the triton is known .",
    "however , once it has been established that a higher-@xmath38 observable is a member of the set of correlated quantities , we may use that observable to constrain properties of smaller subsystems .",
    "this prescription is used here , where we consider the binding energy difference @xmath27 , which would be zero if isospin were an exact symmetry of nature .",
    "we therefore exploit another feature of the eft , namely the absence of a qualitative hierarchy amongst low - energy observables in their role as input to fix the lecs .",
    "thus , our interaction will take @xmath44 ( @xmath45 ) as input , and we will obtain the scattering length @xmath19 ( @xmath46 ) as output .",
    "analogously , the tjon line could be used to predict a range of @xmath33 values which are consistent with @xmath34 .",
    "our calculation of @xmath27 considers isospin violation from coulomb interactions , and from the difference in nn scattering lengths.experimentally , @xmath27 is known to be @xmath47kev  ] . note that we do not claim that our leading - order  calculation of the individual tri - nucleon binding energies is this accurate , but we are examining a binding - energy difference that would be zero in the symmetry limit , and so a leading - order calculation of the difference already provides a useful constraint on @xmath0 . in pursuing such a calculation",
    "we are , though , implicitly assuming that any isospin - violating component of the three - nucleon force in  enters only at sub - leading orders .",
    "we will present evidence that supports this assumption .",
    "the history of analyses of the impact of charge - independence breaking ( cib ) and charge - symmetry breaking ( csb ) on @xmath48 and the trinucleon binding - energy splitting is a rich one ( see _ e.g. _",
    "@xcite for a review of most of the investigations predating the advent of eft methods in few - nucleon theory ) . today , modern high - precision nucleon - nucleon force models predict a trinucleon binding - energy difference , @xmath27 , in good agreement with experiment : @xmath49kev  @xcite and @xmath50kev  @xcite .",
    "even though the individual binding energies of the triton and helium-3 receive significant contributions from a three - nucleon interaction ( tni ) in these models , @xmath27 is driven by the difference in the nucleon - nucleon scattering lengths  at least once electromagnetic effects are properly accounted for .",
    "isospin - violating tnis were considered in the framework of chiral perturbation theory in refs .",
    "@xcite , and the leading - order isospin - violating tni was found to contribute approximately @xmath51kev to @xmath27  @xcite .",
    "a recent lo analysis of @xmath27 in  included the coulomb interaction nonperturbatively . with @xmath19 and @xmath1 as input , a value of @xmath52mev",
    "was predicted using faddeev methods and the dibaryon formalism  @xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the authors applied  at lo , nlo , and n@xmath53lo to predict proton - deuteron scattering- and bound - state observables .",
    "their comprehensive analysis demonstrates the usefulness of the eft prescription in low - energy @xmath54 scattering and in the helium-3 bound state , since an order - by - order decrease of the theoretical uncertainty is obtained . in ref .",
    "@xcite too , @xmath19 and @xmath1 were used to fit the low - energy constants of the eft .",
    "neither of these  analyses included isospin - violating tni .",
    "the article continues with an introduction of  as the theory underlying the interaction potential .",
    "next , a section on the numerical method of a refined version of the resonating group method ( rgm ) , used to solve the few - body problem , precedes the presentation of the results .",
    "the results section includes subsections discussing the uncertainty estimates due to suppressed higher - order long- and short - range interactions , and the limiting ( hypothetical ) case of @xmath55 .",
    "we then offer our conclusions , before assessing the numerical stability of the refined rgm in an appendix .",
    "the effective field theory without explicit pions ( ) at leading order in the expansion parameter @xmath56 is defined by the langrangean @xmath57 where the six - nucleon contact term renormalizes the @xmath58 nucleon - deuteron channel ( see , _ e.g. _",
