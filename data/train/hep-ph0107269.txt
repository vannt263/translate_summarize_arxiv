    "the function @xmath5 is called `` regge trajectory '' of the given particle and takes the value of the spin of that particle when @xmath2 is equal to its squared mass . in perturbative qcd , the notion of gluon reggeization is used in a stronger sense .",
    "it means not only that a reggeon exists with the quantum numbers of the gluon , negative signature and with a trajectory @xmath6 passing through 1 at @xmath7 , but also that this reggeon gives the leading contribution in each order of perturbation theory to the amplitude of processes with large @xmath1 and fixed ( i.e. not growing with @xmath1 ) squared momentum transfer @xmath2 .",

    "gluon reggeization means that , in the regge kinematical region @xmath11 , @xmath2 fixed ( i.e. not growing with @xmath1 ) , the amplitude of this process takes the form @xmath12\\:\\gamma^c_{b^\\prime b}\\;. \\label{elast_ampl_octet}\\ ] ] here @xmath13 is a color index and @xmath14 are the particle - particle - reggeon ( ppr ) vertices , not depending on @xmath1 .",

    "the main contributions to the unitarity relations from inelastic amplitudes come from the multi - regge kinematics , i.e. when rapidities of the produced particles are strongly ordered and their transverse momenta do not grow with @xmath1 . in the multi - regge kinematics ,",
    "the real part of the production amplitudes takes a simple factorized form , due to gluon reggeization , @xmath30 where @xmath31 is an energy scale , irrelevant in the lla , @xmath32 is the ( non - local ) effective vertex for the production of the particles @xmath33 with momenta @xmath34 in the collisions of reggeons with momenta @xmath35 and @xmath36 and color indices @xmath37 and @xmath38 , @xmath39 , @xmath40 , @xmath41 , @xmath42 , @xmath43 and @xmath44 stands for @xmath45 , with @xmath46 . in the lla",

    "this consistency is called `` bootstrap '' and was checked in the lla already in  @xcite .",
    "subsequently , a rigorous proof of the gluon reggeization in the lla was constructed  @xcite .",
    "the part of the representation  ( [ elast_ampl_r ] ) with vacuum quantum numbers in the @xmath2-channel ( @xmath66 , @xmath67 ) for the case of zero momentum transfer is relevant for the total cross section of the scattering of particles @xmath28 and @xmath29 , via the optical theorem . in the lla , it turns out that @xmath68 , with @xmath69 .",
    "this relation shows that unitarity is violated , since the cross section overcomes the froissart - martin bound .",
    "this is obvious since , in the lla , only a definite set of intermediate states , as we have seen , contributes to the @xmath1-channel unitarity relation .",
    "this means that the bfkl approach can not be applied at asymptotically high energies . in order to identify the applicability region of the bfkl approach ,",
    "it is necessary to know the scale of @xmath1 and the argument of the running coupling constant , which are not fixed in the lla .",
    "in the nla , the regge form of the elastic amplitude  ( [ elast_ampl_octet ] ) and of the production amplitudes  ( [ inelast_ampl ] ) , implied by gluon reggeization , has been checked only in the first three orders of perturbation theory  @xcite . in order to derive the bfkl equation in the nla",
    ", gluon reggeization is assumed to be valid to all orders of perturbation theory .",
    "it becomes important , therefore , to check the validity of this assumption .",
    "this will be done at the end of this section .    in the nla",
    "it is necessary to include into the unitarity relations contributions which differ from those in the lla by having one additional power of @xmath70 or one power less in @xmath71 .",
    "the first set of corrections is realized by performing , only in one place , one of the following replacements in the production amplitudes  ( [ inelast_ampl ] ) entering the @xmath1-channel unitarity relation : @xmath72 the second set of corrections consistes in allowing the production in the @xmath1-channel intermediate state of _ one _ pair of particles with rapidities of the same order of magnitude , both in the central or in the fragmentation region ( quasi - multi - regge kinematics ) .",
    "this implies one replacement among the following in the production amplitudes  ( [ inelast_ampl ] ) entering the @xmath1-channel unitarity relation : @xmath73 @xmath74 here @xmath75 stands for the production of a state containing an extra particle in the fragmentation region of the particle @xmath22 in the scattering off the reggeon , @xmath76 and @xmath77 are the effective vertices for the production of a quark anti - quark pair and of a two - gluon pair , respectively , in the collision of two reggeons .",
    "the detailed program of next - to - leading corrections to the bfkl equation was formulated in ref .",
    "they have been calculated over a period of several years , mostly by one research group , lead by v.s .",
    "fadin ( for an exhaustive review , see refs .",
    "it turns out that also in the nla the amplitude for the high energy elastic process @xmath78 can be represented as in eq .",
    "( [ elast_ampl_r ] ) and in fig .  3 .",
    "the green s functions obey an equation with the same form as eq .",
    "( [ bfkl ] ) , with a kernel having the same structure as in eq .",
    "( [ kernel ] ) . here",
    "the `` virtual '' part of the kernel takes also the contribution from the gluon trajectory at 2-loop accuracy , @xmath79  @xcite , while the `` real '' part of the kernel takes the additional contribution from one - gluon production in the reggeon - reggeon collisions at 1-loop order , @xmath80  @xcite , quark anti - quark pair production at born level , @xmath81 ( ref .",
    "@xcite for the forward case , ref .",
    "@xcite for the non - forward case ) and from two - gluon pair at born level , @xmath82 ( ref .",
    "@xcite for the forward case , ref .",
    "@xcite for the non - forward , octet case ) .",
    "so , summarizing , the `` virtual '' part of the kernel is known in the nla ; as for the `` real '' part in the nla , it is known completely for the singlet color representation in the @xmath2-channel in the forward case ( @xmath7 ) and for the octet color representation in the @xmath2-channel in the non - forward case .",
    "the singlet nla kernel in the non - forward case is not completely known , since the singlet @xmath82 contribution is still missing .    the consistency between the representation  ( [ elast_ampl_r ] ) of the elastic amplitude , @xmath63 , derived from @xmath1-channel unitarity , for the part with gluon quantum numbers in the @xmath2-channel ( @xmath64 , @xmath65 ) , and the representation  ( [ elast_ampl_octet ] ) with one reggeized gluon exchange in the @xmath2-channel ( `` bootstrap '' ) is of crucial importance in the nla . in this approximation , indeed , gluon reggeization was only assumed in order to derive the bfkl equation .",
    "moreover , the check of the bootstrap is also a ( partial ) check of the correctness of calculations which , as already pointed out , were performed mostly by one research group . in the nla , the bootstrap leads to two conditions to be verified  @xcite , one on the nla octet kernel , the other on the nla octet impact factors .",
    "the first bootstrap condition has been verified at arbitrary space - time dimension for the part concerning the quark contribution to the kernel in massless qcd  @xcite , while for the part concerning the gluon contribution to the kernel it has been verified in the @xmath83 limit  @xcite .",
    "the second bootstrap condition is process - dependent , therefore it should be checked in principle for every octet impact factor .",
    "so far , it has been checked at arbitrary space - time dimension for quark and gluon nla impact factors in qcd with massive quarks  @xcite .    as for the exchange of vacuum quantum numbers in the @xmath2-channel , the nla corrections to the bfkl kernel lead to a large correction to the bfkl pomeron intercept  @xcite : @xmath84 , with @xmath85 .",
    "a lot of papers have been devoted to the problem of this large correction ( see , for instance ,  @xcite ) . in my opinion ,",
    "the bfkl pomeron intercept itself has not a special physical meaning .",
    "instead , the bfkl approach can predict the full amplitude of hard qcd processes in the nla , as soon as nla impact factors of colorless particles accessible to perturbative qcd are known in the next - to - leading - order . in this respect , one of the most interesting calculations , that of @xmath86 impact factors in the nla , is in progress  @xcite .",
    "it has been proposed by braun and vacca  @xcite that gluon reggeization is realized also in the unphysical particle - reggeon scattering amplitude with gluon quantum numbers in the @xmath2-channel .",
    "this requirement leads to two so - called `` strong '' bootstrap conditions .",
    "one of them fixes the process - dependence of the octet impact factors , stating that any octet impact factor is proportional to the corresponding effective vertex by a universal `` coefficient function '' .",
    "the other states that this universal coefficient function is `` eigenstate '' of the octet bfkl kernel , taken as operator in the transverse space , with the gluon trajectory as `` eigenvalue '' . the coefficient function has been determined in the nla by the known expression of the octet quark impact factors  @xcite and has been used to check the strong bootstrap condition on gluon impact factors  @xcite in the nla .",
    "the strong bootstrap condition on the kernel is trivially satisfied in the lla . as for the nla",
    ", it has been verified so far only for the quark part  @xcite .",
    "although the physical role of the strong bootstrap conditions is not yet clear , they are of practical importance , since their fulfillment implies that of the `` soft '' ones  @xcite .      v.s .",
