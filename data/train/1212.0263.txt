    "over 30 years ago rafael vera introduced fascinating concepts for mass @xcite .",
    "they have not gained widespread acceptance , possibly because they were thought to be incompatible with general relativity ( gr ) . in this paper",
    ", a careful accounting of observer reference frames shows that vera s ideas are consistent with gr in a schwarzschild field .",
    "this combination is an attempt to begin to resolve the long - standing perplexity over the localization of gravitational energy .",
    "one of vera s ideas is that the rest mass of a particle increases with its gravitational potential @xcite . therefore , gravitational energy would be localized with the masses of bodies .",
    "this must occur in such a way that proper ( locally measured ) rest mass is invariant with position , as perceived from a local observer s mass reference frame .",
    "the mass / velocity relationship for a body falling along a geodesic in a schwarzschild field is shown to be the old - fashioned expression for relativistic mass from special relativity .",
    "this new result is independent of the choice of coordinates , as confirmed for the isotropic and harmonic metrics .",
    "this approach strengthens the correspondence between special relativity and gr , and rehabilitates the undervalued concept of relativistic mass .",
    "reference frames are usually associated with spatial coordinates and time .",
    "the introduction of reference frames for mass is essential for solving this problem .",
    "applying vera s concepts to time - varying gravitational fields is problematic .",
    "it is shown that his concept of an invariant falling mass does not apply to such fields .",
    "unlike static fields , time - varying fields induce a net long - range energy transfer between bodies .    the paper proceeds with the following steps :",
    "a dimensionless scalar @xmath0 is introduced ; its important identities are found .",
    "a mass transformation is derived for a one - dimensional , static gravitational field , then generalized to transformations between mass reference frames .",
    "the transformations are applied to the schwarzschild solution and other metrics .",
    "the mass / velocity relationship for falling bodies is evaluated for radial and oblique motion .",
    "it is shown that the proposed interpretation conserves energy and mass within a schwarzschild field while the conventional interpretation does not .",
    "time - varying fields are studied and limitations on the proposed interpretation are imposed . as with maxwell s equations , in which a time - varying electric field causes effects",
    "not seen in static fields , a time - varying gravitational field also causes effects not exhibited by static fields .",
    "this work is a matter of interpretation and is intended to complement gr .",
    "what happens to the energy used to lift a body in a gravitational field ? during the development of gr , einstein derived an expression @xmath1 for the stress - energy of the gravitational field .",
    "that expression is a pseudotensor that varies with the choice of coordinates in an unseemly way .",
    "( for a review see @xcite . )",
    "many attempts have been made to better understand gravitational energy in gr .",
    "tolman @xcite defined gravitational energy as a separate term in the energy - momentum tensor @xmath2 . in 1935 , whittaker @xcite proposed the term  potential mass \" to describe the contribution of gravitational potential energy to the gravitating mass of a particle .",
    "after much deliberation , the interpretation arose that gravitational energy is not localized in gr @xcite .",
    "thus , it is meaningless to ask where gravitational energy resides . in an influential textbook @xcite , misner , thorne and wheeler",
    "sought to resolve this quandary with the words ,  anybody who looks for a magic formula for ` local gravitational energy - momentum ' is looking for the right answer to the wrong question . unhappily",
    ", enormous time and effort were devoted in the past to trying to ` answer this question ' before investigators realized the futility of the enterprise . \"",
    "yet bondi insists that non - localizable forms of energy are inadmissible in gr @xcite .",
    "although today most relativists seem satisfied with the conventional treatment of gravitational energy as unlocalizable , there remains considerable ambiguity in the interpretation of gravitational energy within gr .",
    "many authors believe that gravitational energy , and even mass , are stored in fields @xcite .",
    "some conclude that gravitational self - energy , which is a type of gravitational energy , contributes to the masses of bodies @xcite .",
    "vera @xcite , savickas @xcite , and ghose and kumar @xcite interpret rest mass as depending on local gravitational potential , while ohanian and ruffini @xcite argue that rest mass is a constant independent of space and time . since energy can not simultaneously be distributed in fields and contribute to particle masses , some of these views appear to be incompatible .",
    "hayward states ,  it comes as a surprise to many that there is no agreed definition of gravitational energy ( or mass ) in general relativity \" @xcite .    a few dedicated researchers continue to study gravitational energy and related concepts such as quasi - local energy momentum ( e.g. , @xcite ) , driven partly by the belief , as stated by mirshekari and abbassi @xcite , that  one of the old and basic problems in general relativity which is still unsolved is the localization of energy . \"",
    "as proposed or implied by others ( e.g. , @xcite ) it is hypothesized that the energy used to lift a body in a static gravitational field increases its rest mass .",
    "it is also assumed that the mass of a body remains constant while falling in a static field @xcite .",
    "this interpretation is illustrated in fig .",
    "1 with the following steps : the energy @xmath3 used to lift a body increases its rest mass by @xmath4 . when the lifted body is allowed to fall from a higher elevation , it maintains a constant mass during its free - fall , equal to its mass at the point it began its fall .",
    "as the body passes its starting point with some velocity , it has a greater mass than an identical body at rest there , in general agreement with special relativity .",
    "when the fall is stopped , the body loses its extra mass and returns to the rest mass it had before being lifted .",
    "the mass that the body loses during its impact is transferred to other bodies ( and to itself ) in the form of vibrational energy , heat , elastic or inelastic energy , etc .",
    "total mass would always be conserved during lifting , falling , and collisions .",
    "no mass or energy would be stored in the gravitational field .    with this interpretation",
    ", the rest masses of all bodies would depend on position in a gravitational field .",
    "in accordance with the equivalence principle , any experiments conducted at different elevations should be unable to detect any difference in mass , since all objects would be affected in exactly the same proportion .",
    "this interpretation does for potential energy what special relativity did for kinetic energy  gives it a mass equivalent .",
    "the history of various concepts of gravitational energy is a fascinating topic not covered herein .",
    "the concepts shown in fig . 1 appear to work in static fields .",
    "however , it is shown later that the mass of a body can not remain constant while falling in a _ time - varying _ field , in which gravitational energy must be conveyed between bodies via gravitons and/or gravitational waves .",
    "the essential element of fig .",
    "1 that remains applicable in time - varying fields is that energy and mass are primarily localized as part of the masses of bodies rather than distributed in fields .    for the purpose of this paper ,",
    "no distinction needs to be made between inertial mass , active gravitational mass , and passive gravitational mass .",
    "they are assumed to be the same @xcite .",
    "also , the term  gravitational energy \" refers to the gravitational potential energy of a body and is not to be confused with the more general gravitational energy - momentum tensor @xmath2 .    as an example of the conservation of mass after an inelastic collision ,",
    "thermal energy increases the velocity of the molecules of a body , with corresponding relativistic mass given by @xmath5 so that the mass of a falling body is in part converted into the mass associated with additional kinetic energy @xmath6 of the molecules @xcite .",
    "after the body cools off , it returns to its original mass .",
    "although the terms  rest mass \" and  relativistic mass \" have fallen out of favor @xcite , they are used herein out of necessity . here the term  rest mass \" describes the mass of a motionless body in any reference frame fixed to a central mass in a static gravitational field . since reference frames span different gravitational potentials , rest masses may vary with elevation . ",
    "proper rest mass \" is the rest mass of a body when it is co - located with the observer measuring it ; proper rest mass is presumed to be invariant . ",
    "relativistic mass \" refers to the mass of a body moving relative to an observer fixed with respect to the central mass , as perceived from that observer s mass reference frame . rather than dwell on semantic arguments over the acceptability of the term  relativistic mass , \" it is more productive to focus on physical arguments and their consequences .",
    "mtw @xcite derived localized gravitational energy for the schwarzschild solution .",
    "however , their approach differs from vera s concepts @xcite .",
    "several variable mass theories of gravity have been proposed @xcite .",
    "however , they do not directly relate changes in mass with potential energy .",
    "the standard model extension ( sme ) has been developed partly to study possible variations in fundamental constants @xcite . in the sme",
    ", the relative masses of different materials might vary with gravitational potential , in disagreement with gr .",
    "that possibility is not considered herein .",
    "modern versions of the e@xmath7tv@xmath7s experiments @xcite support the hypothesis that different materials are affected by gravitational fields in the same way .",
    "because it is necessary to understand static fields before exploring time - varying fields , this work begins with a detailed analysis of the schwarzschild solution . for static gravitational fields it is useful to define the scalar dimensionless ratio @xmath0 as follows : @xmath9 where @xmath10 is",
    "the time interval between two events measured at some point @xmath11 and @xmath12 is the time interval between those two events measured from some other point @xmath13 , using clocks that are motionless relative to the field . if @xmath14 , time passes more slowly at point @xmath11 than at @xmath13 .",
    "( in a static field it is easy to account for the time for a signal to travel between @xmath11 and @xmath13 . )    from the form of ( [ betadef ] ) the following identities for @xmath8 can be found : @xmath15    @xmath16    and @xmath17",
    "the next step is to derive a general transformation for rest mass in a static , one - dimensional gravitational field , from the perspective of observers who are motionless relative to the field .",
    "based on einstein s equivalence principle , an observer at any location should measure the same rest mass for a given body when it is at her location .",
    "this could be achieved experimentally by comparing the mass of the body to the mass of a kilogram standard carried alongside .",
    "consider an observer located at some arbitrary reference elevation @xmath18 .",
    "let the proper rest mass of some body be @xmath19 .",
    "the mass of that body when it is at some other elevation @xmath20 , relative to the reference frame at @xmath18 , is defined to be @xmath21  an important notation for what follows .",
    "the difficulties of measuring mass at another location must be overlooked for now .",
    "when the body is at @xmath18 , the observer there will measure its mass to be @xmath22 . when the body is carried to some other elevation @xmath20",
    ", an observer there will measure its mass to be @xmath23 .",
    "consider a static field causing a proper acceleration @xmath24 in the @xmath25 direction .",
    "let @xmath20 represent proper distance , which will generally differ from the coordinates used in some solution to the field equations .",
    "consider a body with proper rest mass @xmath19 being slowly lifted against the field .",
    "then the proper energy required to lift the body some small distance @xmath26 is given by @xmath27    in the local reference frame at @xmath20 , the small increase in mass as the body is lifted is given by @xmath28    from the reference frame at @xmath18 , the body at @xmath20 has mass @xmath21 , while an observer at @xmath20 measures the mass of the body to be @xmath19 .",
    "the ratio of those masses will apply to any body or mass increment at @xmath20 .",
    "therefore , the incremental mass @xmath29 at @xmath20 observed from @xmath18 and from @xmath20 are related as follows : @xmath30    combining ( [ dmxx ] ) and ( [ mratios ] ) yields @xmath31    this can be integrated to yield the general mass transformation between elevations in a one - dimensional , static gravitational field : @xmath32 this equation , also found in @xcite , indicates that the mass of a body lifted against the field to @xmath20 is greater than the mass of an identical body at @xmath18 .",
    "since there is no preferred elevation in a gravitational field , point @xmath18 can be selected to represent any point .",
    "the equation also shows that proper mass does not vary with elevation .    in a weak field , ( [ mxox ] ) reduces to @xmath33 , where @xmath34 is the classical gravitational potential energy of the body .    next the general transformations between mass reference frames can be found .",
    "consider the general case of two elevations @xmath11 and @xmath13 .",
    "let @xmath35 and @xmath36 . from the form of the preceding equation , it can be shown that any rest mass @xmath19 at @xmath13 relative to the mass reference frame at @xmath11 , and vice - versa , satisfies identities that are similar to those for @xmath8 , so that @xmath37 @xmath38 and @xmath39 where @xmath40 , for example , is the mass of a body at @xmath11 , with proper rest mass @xmath19 , relative to the mass reference frame at @xmath13 .",
    "observers at different gravitational potentials experience different mass reference frames that are related by these formulas .",
    "next , the mass transformation is applied to the exterior schwarzschild solution of gr , described by the following metric : @xmath41 where @xmath42    the coordinate time @xmath43 is the time interval of a stationary clock at infinity and @xmath44 , where @xmath45 is proper time of a clock corresponding to the spacetime interval @xmath46 . setting @xmath47 in ( [ ds2 ] ) for a motionless clock at @xmath48 yields @xmath49 , where @xmath50 is the time interval of a stationary clock at @xmath48 and @xmath51 is the time of a stationary clock at infinity .",
    "thus , @xmath52 is the ratio of the time rates at @xmath48 and infinity , corresponding to the definition for @xmath8 in ( [ betadef ] ) . that is the origin of the subscripts in ( [ brinf ] )",
    ".    equation ( [ brinf ] ) provides @xmath8 at @xmath48 relative to an observer at infinity . at some other radius @xmath53 , @xmath54    from identities ( [ bid2 ] ) and ( [ bid3 ] ) an expression for the @xmath8 s relating elevations @xmath48 and @xmath53",
    "can be found : @xmath55 besides using the identities , this can also be derived from the relative time rates at @xmath48 and @xmath53 .",

    "the terminology @xmath59 is used to differentiate between those two cases . for a motionless clock at @xmath48 , @xmath60 .",
    "coordinate @xmath48 in the schwarzschild metric has little physical significance . of greater relevance",
    "is the proper distance given by @xmath46 , which in the general case may correspond to a moving meter stick or one that is motionless relative to the central mass . to distinguish between those two possibilities , variable @xmath20 is used to denote proper distance in the reference frame of a motionless observer at @xmath48 . by setting @xmath61 , letting @xmath62 in ( [ ds2 ] ) , and using the appropriate sign for a spacelike spacetime interval , the following relationship is found : @xmath63 which relates proper distance @xmath64 to the radial coordinate distance @xmath65 . using the resulting formula for @xmath64 in place of @xmath65 in ( [ rddot ] ) ,",
    "@xmath66    consider a body at the instant it is released to free - fall , before it has attained appreciable velocity .",
    "then @xmath67 , the proper velocity is @xmath68 , and only the right hand term in ( [ drdot ] ) contributes . using the resulting equation in combination with ( [ rddot ] ) and",
    "( [ drdx ] ) , the proper acceleration of gravity for a slowly falling body at @xmath48 in a schwarzschild field is given by @xmath69 this is the acceleration that must be resisted when slowly lifting a body in the field .",
    "note that @xmath70 is positive towards the central mass .",
    "suppose a small body with proper rest mass @xmath19 is lifted radially from @xmath48 to @xmath53 in a schwarzschild field .",
    "the mass of the body at @xmath53 , relative to the reference frame at @xmath48 , can be found by substituting ( [ drdx ] ) and ( [ gr ] ) into ( [ mxox ] ) , which yields @xmath71    the surprisingly simple solution to this integral is @xmath72 since @xmath73 if @xmath74 , the mass of the lifted body at @xmath53 is perceived to be greater than @xmath19 from the reference frame at @xmath48 . in a weak field",
    ", @xmath75 is its rest mass plus ( or minus ) the mass equivalent of the change in classical potential energy .",
    "if @xmath48 is chosen to be the reference frame at an infinite distance from the central mass and if @xmath76 , then the relative mass of a body at any point @xmath48 perceived from the reference frame at infinity is given by @xmath77 thus , stationary bodies in the vicinity of a central mass have a decreased mass relative to a reference frame at infinity .",
    "it is apparent that @xmath52 plays the role of scale factor for mass as well as time .",
    "the preceding results for the schwarzschild solution suggest the following general transformation for rest mass in any static gravitational field : @xmath78 this generalization , offered without proof , does not depend on the choice of coordinates ; it is not used again in this paper .",
    "the proof of ( [ mxo ] ) for any static field @xmath24 requires topics not covered here .",
    "most studies of localization focus on the gravitating mass rather than test particles . nevertheless , mass reference frames reveal an interesting property of the gravitating mass in a schwarzschild field . in some ways",
    ", the schwarzschild metric is written from the perspective of a reference frame at infinity : coordinate time @xmath79 represents a clock at infinity and radial distance @xmath48 converges to flat space coordinates at infinity .",
    "therefore , the central mass at the origin should be @xmath80 , its mass from the reference frame at infinity . from a reference frame at @xmath48 ,",
    "all masses appear increased from ( [ mrrb ] ) , so that @xmath81 .",
    "substituting this into ( [ gr ] ) yields @xmath82 where @xmath48 is the proper circumference divided by @xmath83 .",
    "thus , newton s law of gravity is preserved for any local observer if the magnitude of the central mass in his reference frame is used .",
    "this result is independent of the choice of coordinates .",
    "now that the mass transformation has been derived for a schwarzschild field , the mass / velocity relationship for a falling body can be found . equation ( [ mrrb ] )",
    "provides the mass of a body that has been lifted from @xmath48 to @xmath53 .",
    "based on the concept in fig .",
    "1 , if that body is allowed to fall from @xmath53 back to @xmath48 , it will maintain the same mass during its fall .",
    "it will therefore arrive at @xmath48 with the relativistic mass @xmath84 given by ( [ mrrb ] ) .    in gr it is straightforward to derive the velocity of a body falling radially from @xmath53 to @xmath48 in a schwarzschild field .",
    "the radial geodesic equations of motion @xcite are @xmath85 and @xmath86    expressing @xmath87 in terms of @xmath88 and setting constant @xmath89 so that the coordinate velocity @xmath90 at @xmath53 , the coordinate velocity of the body when it arrives at @xmath48 is @xmath91    using prior formulas , the proper velocity @xmath92 of a body at @xmath48 can be related to its coordinate velocity as follows : @xmath93 where @xmath92 is measured with respect to proper coordinates @xmath20 fixed relative to the central mass .",
    "the preceding two equations can be combined to yield the proper velocity of a body falling from @xmath53 , measured at @xmath48 by a motionless observer there : @xmath94    using ( [ mrrb ] ) to provide the locally measured mass of the falling body @xmath84 , it is found that the relationship between proper velocity and total mass of the falling body at @xmath48 is given by @xmath95 this is the well known relativistic mass / velocity relationship of special relativity , derived for a body falling in a schwarzschild field .",
    "the mass / velocity relationship of ( [ mv ] ) was derived for a body released from rest at @xmath53 .",
    "what if some initial , proper radial velocity @xmath96 is imparted to the body at @xmath53 as it begins its fall ?",
    "then an observer at @xmath53 will perceive the body to have an increased mass as it begins its fall , as given by @xmath97    from the reference frame at @xmath48 , the mass of the body at @xmath53 will be increased above its rest mass @xmath75 in the same proportion .",
    "that is the value of the body s mass that remains constant during the fall from @xmath53 to @xmath48 , and will be measured as @xmath98 when it arrives at @xmath48 . using the equation of motion ( [ rdot2 ] ) and other equations previously derived , it can be shown that , regardless of any initial velocity imparted to the body at @xmath53 , the mass / velocity relationship of ( [ mv ] ) applies when the body arrives at @xmath48 .",
    "for static fields there are two distinct physical explanations for gravitational redshift that can be found in the literature .",
    "the most common view is that the redshift is caused by a loss ( gain ) in the energy of a photon as it climbs ( descends ) in a gravitational field .",
    "another view , argued by okun , selivanov and telegdi @xcite and noted by others ( e.g. , @xcite ) is that the redshift is caused by a change in the energy levels of lifted atoms .",
    "these viewpoints are incompatible ; if both were true the redshift would be doubled .",
    "the concept of mass reference frames supports the view that gravitational redshift is caused by a change in the energy levels ( masses ) of lifted atoms . the energy of a photon would not change while traveling along a null geodesic in a static gravitational field @xcite .",
    "if a photon is emitted at elevation @xmath18 with proper energy @xmath99 , it will arrive at a higher elevation @xmath20 with the same energy . however , all stationary masses and energies at @xmath20 are increased relative to @xmath18 . to an observer at @xmath20 ,",
    "the photon arrives with a reduced energy compared to a photon at @xmath20 emitted by the same process . using a uniform field approximation of @xmath100 and @xmath101",
    ", it can be shown that a photon with proper energy @xmath99 emitted at @xmath18 arrives at @xmath20 with a frequency shift of @xmath102 relative to the frequency the photon would have if it were emitted at @xmath20 with proper energy @xmath99 .",
    "the proper frequency of the photon at @xmath20 is established by its proper energy there , in combination with planck s constant , and is not an inherent property of the photon",
    ". experimental evidence of the local position invariance of planck s constant @xcite is consistent with this interpretation .",
    "a review of gravitational redshift experiments ( e.g. , @xcite ) indicates that they are unable to distinguish whether photons lose energy during travel , or appear to be redshifted due to changes in mass / energy reference frames .",
    "the proposed interpretation also satisfies the thought - experiment of nordtvedt on the conservation of energy in gravitational redshift experiments @xcite .",
    "the proposed existence of mass reference frames appears to be consistent with predictions and observations of gravitational redshift .",
    "this discussion applies only to static fields .",
    "the time - varying field created by the expansion of the universe causes a cosmological redshift that is distinct from that of static fields .",
    "consistent with birkhoff s law @xcite , many metrics describe the field of a central mass , each related to the schwarzschild solution by a coordinate transformation . two such metrics are the isotropic and harmonic metrics @xcite .",
    "the isotropic metric for a central mass can be written in the form @xmath103 where @xmath104 and @xmath105    if a body is lifted from @xmath106 to @xmath53 in the isotropic metric , and then allowed to fall back to @xmath106 , the mass / velocity relationship of ( [ mv ] ) is found at @xmath106 .",
    "if this exercise is repeated for the harmonic metric @xcite , that result is found once again .",
    "what this confirms is that mass reference frames are independent of the choice of coordinates , as should be expected .",
    "it can also be shown that at the same point in space , as determined by well - known coordinate transformations between the three metrics ( e.g. , @xcite ) , both @xmath52 and the local gravitational acceleration @xmath70 are identical for all three metrics .",
    "what this suggests is that , in static fields , gravitational energy is stored as part of the masses of bodies in accordance with the simple scalar function @xmath0 , which transforms in a well - behaved way and is independent of the choice of coordinates .",
    "up to this point , only radial motion relative to a central mass has been considered . next it is shown that motion in any oblique direction",
    "is not only consistent with the concept of mass reference frames , but corresponds to the schwarzschild metric .",
    "consider a stationary observer fixed at some radius @xmath48 from a central mass . to that observer , special relativity and ( [ mv ] )",
    "indicate that a moving or orbiting body at @xmath48 should have a mass @xmath107 of @xmath108 where @xmath107 denotes relativistic mass @xmath98 of the body at @xmath48 in the reference frame at @xmath48 . from a reference frame at infinity",
    ", the mass of the moving body at @xmath48 appears smaller , since all masses at @xmath48 appear decreased relative to those at infinity by a factor @xmath52 , from ( [ mrinf ] ) . from that frame",
    ", the mass of the moving body at @xmath48 is perceived to be @xmath109 where the subscripts on @xmath52 are dropped for now .",
    "if the body is in free - fall around the central mass , moving in any direction with no other external forces , its total mass will remain constant during its fall or orbit .",
    "therefore , the body s total mass from the reference frame at infinity is constant as follows : @xmath110 where @xmath111 is a constant of the motion .",
    "this formula makes it easy to find the velocity at any radius @xmath48 . if @xmath112 the body has sufficient relativistic mass  and associated velocity  to escape the central mass . if @xmath113 the orbit will be bound .",
    "this result is similar to that of @xcite .    using the expressions @xmath114 and @xmath115 , ( [ mvk ] )",
    "can be rearranged to yield @xmath116 where @xmath43 is the time of a clock at infinity .",
    "let @xmath45 represent the time of a clock on the moving body .",
    "those two times are related by @xmath117    using ( [ mvk ] ) and ( [ dtaudt ] ) , it can be shown that the left hand side of ( [ metk ] ) is @xmath118 , so that @xmath119    as previously defined , @xmath64 is proper length in the motionless reference frame at @xmath48 . for",
    "any given metric , @xmath64 can be related to the coordinates used in that solution .",
    "for example , for the standard form of the schwarzschild solution @xmath120 this can be found from the metric at a synchronous instant in time @xmath121 , which gives the spacelike spacetime interval @xmath122 when the appropriate sign is used . substituting this into ( [ ds2x ] ) yields @xmath123",
    "this is the schwarzschild metric of ( [ ds2 ] ) .",
    "other metrics , like the isotropic and harmonic metrics , can similarly be obtained when the corresponding expression for @xmath124 is used .",
    "although this is not an independent derivation of the metrics , it demonstrates the correspondence between mass reference frames and the metrics of gr . since this result",
    "is based on ( [ mvrr ] ) it also indicates that a body moving in any oblique direction will exhibit the mass / velocity relationship of special relativity in a local frame .",
    "the derivation of ( [ mv ] ) confirms that mass and energy are conserved during a lift and fall cycle under the proposed interpretation .",
    "that provides a compelling argument to support the existence of mass reference frames : as shown below , the prevailing interpretation of gravitational energy in gr does not conserve energy and mass during a lift and fall .",
    "consider a body being slowly lifted in a schwarzschild field .",
    "the mass equivalent of the proper lift energy expended over a small distance @xmath64 is given by ( [ dmxx ] ) .",
    "if total mass is indeed invariant between all elevations , then @xmath125 , contrary to ( [ dmxo ] ) . then the mass equivalent of the energy used to lift a body from @xmath18 to @xmath20 would be given by @xmath126 if this is integrated in a schwarzschild field , the total mass equivalent of the energy expended while lifting the body from @xmath48 to @xmath53 would be given by @xmath127 in weak fields , @xmath128 approaches @xmath75 in ( [ mrrb ] ) .",
    "when the body falls from @xmath53 to @xmath48 it must arrive with a relativistic mass given by ( [ mv ] ) in the reference frame of a stationary observer at @xmath48 .",
    "it is easy to show that the lift energy / mass and the additional relativistic energy / mass acquired by the body when it returns to @xmath48 are not conserved , as follows : @xmath129 it takes less energy / mass to lift a body than arrives back at the starting point .",
    "thus , without the use of mass reference frames , energy and its mass equivalent are not conserved within a lift / fall cycle .",
    "this does not indicate any flaw in gr , but suggests that mass reference frames are necessary to complement the theory .",
    "to the extent that distant stars contribute to the local gravitational potential at any point , the proposed interpretation implies that the magnitude of the inertia of any body is directly influenced by masses throughout the universe .",
    "thus , the proposed interpretation brings gr into closer harmony with mach s principle . nevertheless , the concepts developed herein are more likely to fuel the recurring debate on mach s principle than to resolve it .",
    "this paper focuses on static fields , which encompass the most important tests of gr . nevertheless , it is important to show how the proposed interpretation is limited in time - varying fields .",
    "such fields introduce issues that are discussed only briefly here .",
    "the analysis of time - varying fields begins with the simple thought - experiment shown in fig .",
    "2 . consider two masses @xmath130 located deep in intergalactic space and separated by distance @xmath131 .",
    "initially , both masses are approximately co - moving with the cosmological fluid .",
    "the attractive gravitational force between the bodies is @xmath132 .",
    "imagine that a long cable is attached to @xmath133 , with the other end attached to a winch w secured to a distant , massive object .",
    "the winch pulls on the cable with a tension of @xmath134 , so that mass @xmath133 moves away from @xmath135 at the same rate that @xmath135 falls towards @xmath133 . both masses will accelerate towards @xmath136 while maintaining distance @xmath131 between them .",
    "once they have achieved some large velocity @xmath137 , let mass @xmath133 be pulled a great distance away from @xmath135 , leaving @xmath135 moving at velocity @xmath137 in empty space .    in this example ,",
    "body @xmath135 has been accelerated by gravity to velocity @xmath137 , imparting relativistic energy / mass to the body . where has that energy come from ?",
    "if vera s interpretation of falling bodies from fig .",
    "1 is applied , then the total mass remains constant and the original rest mass @xmath19 has been converted into relativistic mass @xmath138 . if the body s motion is then stopped , it will lose the relativistic part of its mass and drop to a new rest mass of @xmath139 .",
    "then @xmath140 in a region where the mass reference frame is unchanged .",
    "the body s rest mass has been decreased by the motion induced in fig .",
    "conversely , the rest mass of @xmath133 would necessarily increase",
    ". that interpretation would require the rest masses of all bodies and elementary particles to vary with their prior motion in time - varying gravitational fields .",
    "in the absence of experimental evidence of an appreciable variability in the rest masses of protons or electrons , it is evident that vera s interpretation of a falling body does not work in a time - varying field .",
    "fortunately , all is not lost .",
    "the most essential of vera s concepts is that gravitational energy is stored as part of the masses of bodies rather than in empty fields . in fig .",
    "2 , the energy expended by the winch travels directly to @xmath133 via the cable .",
    "half of that energy then travels through space almost immediately to @xmath135 , limited only by @xmath141 .",
    "no energy would be stored in fields over the long - term .    what can be deduced from this exercise",
    "is that gravitational energy must travel through space in a time - varying field .",
    "bondi described the movement of energy across the empty space between two bodies @xcite .",
    "in static fields , energy may be exchanged between gravitating masses , but the net change in the mass of a test particle during free - fall should be zero . thus the proposed interpretation of gravitational energy is compatible with time - varying fields , but is limited accordingly .",
    "this approach is consistent with the transport of energy by gravitational waves , and also suggests that gravitons , if they exist , should convey mass / energy . the transfer of energy in fig .",
    "2 is fundamental and does not arise from the concept of mass reference frames .    to show how the proposed interpretation works in time - varying fields , it is next applied to the most important cosmological metric of gr  the robertson - walker metric , which can be written in the following form : @xmath142,\\ ] ] where @xmath79 is the cosmological time of all observers co - moving with the cosmological fluid , @xmath143 is the scale factor representing the expansion of the universe , and @xmath144 represents radial coordinate distance .",
    "proper distance @xmath64 in the radial direction is related to @xmath144 by @xmath145 at any synchronous time @xmath79 .",
    "suppose that at some time @xmath146 a particle is given an initial proper radial velocity @xmath147 relative to the cosmological fluid , . at some later time @xmath79",
    ", it will arrive at a second point with proper velocity @xmath148 . from the geodesic equations of motion ( e.g. , @xcite )",
    ", the proper radial velocity of the body at @xmath79 can be found : @xmath149 as expected , the equation confirms that if a particle starts out with an initial velocity @xmath150 relative to the cosmological fluid it will continue to move with the cosmological fluid without relative acceleration .",
    "moreover , a photon with an initial proper velocity of @xmath151 will maintain a proper velocity of @xmath141 .    as previously discussed for the schwarzschild solution , suppose a particle is slowly  lifted \" between two points .",
    "what ( [ vr ] ) indicates is that no matter how small the initial velocity @xmath152 , the particle s proper velocity will never subsequently fall to zero",
    ". it will forever continue to drift slowly across the universe .",
    "this means that all points in the expanding universe have the same gravitational potential .",
    "there is no gravitational force or pseudo - force to lift against when slowly moving a particle .",
    "therefore , all observers co - moving with the cosmological fluid experience the same mass reference frame .",
    "however , ( [ vr ] ) shows that as the universe expands , the proper velocity of of the particle decreases monotonically below its initial proper velocity @xmath147 .",
    "therefore , its relativistic mass will decrease with time , relative to cosmological observers .",
    "using ( [ vr ] ) the relativistic mass of a particle as a function of time is @xmath153 where @xmath19 is its rest mass .",
    "thus the relativistic mass decreases with time .",
    "the change in relativistic mass with time can be found from ( [ vr ] ) and ( [ mt ] ) @xmath154 this loss of relativistic mass is directly proportional to the rate of expansion of the universe . in a static universe ,",
    "@xmath155 and there is no loss of mass .",
    "this result is consistent with vera s interpretation that the mass of a falling body remains constant in a static field , while requiring the transfer of mass in a time - varying field .",
    "it is important to recognize that the loss of mass in ( [ dmvdt ] ) does not arise from the concept of mass reference frames , but is a direct consequence of the robertson - walker metric and is implicit in gr .",
    "so what happens to the relativistic mass lost by a body moving relative to the cosmological fluid ?",
    "the concepts developed herein suggest that mass / energy must travel through space to other bodies , most likely at the speed of light .",
    "for the robertson - walker metric , the receiving bodies would be the masses comprising the expanding universe .",
    "similarly , this approach can be applied to any metric to quantify the mass / energy lost or gained by falling bodies .",
    "the concepts developed herein only begin to explore this topic .",
    "equation ( [ mt ] ) provides another way to calculate cosmological redshift .",
    "if @xmath156 is the relativistic mass of a particle at time @xmath146 when it has initial velocity @xmath147 , then the limit of @xmath157 as @xmath158 is @xmath159 , which in terms of energy corresponds to the expected cosmological redshift of a photon @xcite .",
    "the proposed interpretation of gravitational energy provides a means to explore the disposition of gravitational energy in solutions to the field equations .",
    "the localization of gravitational energy in static fields is explained by simple concepts in which the energy is localized with the masses of bodies .",
    "observers at different gravitational potentials would experience different mass reference frames . with this approach",
    ", it is shown that the relativistic mass of a falling body can be calculated directly from gr .",
    "thus , the correspondence between general and special relativity is enhanced .",
    "unlike the pseudotensor @xmath1 , this interpretation is independent of the choice of coordinates .",
    "the use of mass reference frames also conserves mass and energy during a lift / fall cycle , unlike the concept of invariant mass .",
    "inasmuch as there currently exists no widely - accepted treatment of localized gravitational energy in gr , it is hoped that the proposed interpretation will be considered worthy of further study and discussion .",
    "much work remains to be done .",
    "many attempts have been made to incorporate a scalar field into gravitational theory .",
    "examples are the scalar - tensor theory of brans and dicke @xcite and the dilaton field @xcite .",
    "what this paper suggests is that , in static fields , gr already includes an intrinsic scalar field @xmath0 that accounts for the energy of the gravitational field .    unlike static fields ,",
    "time - varying fields require a net exchange of energy and mass between gravitating bodies . with this interpretation , gravitational waves and/or gravitons would convey energy and mass .    in newtonian gravity ,",
    "potential energy allows total energy to be conserved when lifting a body .",
    "the equivalence of a small amount of mass to a large amount of energy allows total energy and mass to be conserved without it , consistent with everyday experience ."
