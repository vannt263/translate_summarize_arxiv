    "since the discovery of graphene , which is an atomic layer exfoliated from the graphite , two - dimensional ( 2d ) materials have attracted considerable research interest in recent years , due to their potential applications in the nanoelectronics based on the diverse and attractive properties .",
    "similar to the graphite , most of the layered materials are stacked with their building blocks connected by weak van der waals interactions .",
    "thus it is possible to obtain few layers or even monolayer from their bulk counterparts.@xcite among various kinds of the layered materials , transition metal dichalcogenides ( tmds ) stand out because some of them exhibit even much more exciting properties compared to the star material graphene .",
    "for instance , mos@xmath1 monolayer was found a semiconductor with sizeable direct band gap of about 1.8 - 1.9 ev,@xcite overcoming the disadvantage of zero band gap in graphene when applied in the field effect transistors ( fets ) and optoelectronic devices .    with respect to the spintronic applications , 2d ferromagnets with high curie temperature",
    "are desirable . however",
    ", neither graphene nor most of the tmds monolayers is intrinsically magnetic .",
    "many methods can be used to induce the magnetic properties in the tmds monolayers , mainly including doping,@xcite hydrogenation,@xcite and forming zigzag edges.@xcite in the nanoelectronic applications , however , we expect the magnetism can be precisely and flexibly controlled .",
    "these methods mentioned above are somewhat rough as compared with the practical requirements .",
    "recently , vx@xmath1,@xcite nbx2,@xcite and mnx@xmath1@xcite ( x = s , se ) monolayers were theoretically predicted to exhibit ferromagnetic ( fm ) behavior , broadening the properties of the pristine 2d monolayers .",
    "very recently , the metastable compound 1@xmath0-crte@xmath1 was successfully synthesized in the experiment and it exhibits a fm property with a high curie temperature of 310 k.@xcite while it was reported that the crse@xmath1 compound is antiferromagnetic ( afm ) and its magnetic property can be tuned by substituting cr with v or ti.@xcite then what is the origin of the different magnetic properties of crse@xmath1 and crte@xmath1 compounds ? on the other hand ,",
    "2d materials are needed when applied in the nanoelectronic devices . since crx@xmath1 ( x = se , te ) compounds exhibit various and appealing magnetic behavior , whether they can retain these properties when they are exfoliated into monolayers and whether the magnetic properties can be further tuned by the external method , such as strain?@xcite these questions deserve a careful investigation .    in this work ,",
    "we investigate the electronic and magnetic properties of 1@xmath0-crx@xmath1 ( x = se , te ) monolayers by using the first - principles calculations .",
    "the results show that similar to their bulk counterparts , the pristine crse@xmath1 and crte@xmath1 monolayers are afm and fm , respectively .",
    "interestingly , we find that the switch between fm and afm can be realized in both of the two monolayers by applying relatively small strains and the curie temperatures can be enhanced above the room temperature .",
    "the magnetic and electronic properties of crse@xmath1 and crte@xmath1 monolayers can be easily tuned by the external strain , making them promising candidates in the future spintronic applications .",
    "the electronic and magnetic properties were investigated based on the first - principles calculations within the framework of the density functional theory ( dft),@xcite as implemented in the quantum espresso code.@xcite the ultrasoft pseudopotentials were used to represent the interaction between electrons and ions .",
    "the exchange - correlation potential was in form of the perdew - burke - ernzerhof ( pbe ) expression@xcite of the generalized - gradient approximation ( gga ) .",
    "the cutoff energy was set to be 544 ev . for each monolayer , a vacuum region of 15 ",
    "was added so that the interactions between the monolayer and its period image can be neglected .",
    "we used @xmath3 and @xmath4 supercells for the collinear and noncollinear magnetic calculations , respectively . for the structural relaxations ,",
    "the brillouin zones were sampled with @xmath5 and @xmath6 monkhorst - pack @xmath7-point meshes for the above two supercells , respectively . for the electronic properties of the collinear calculations ,",
    "a @xmath8 monkhorst - pack @xmath7-point mesh was used . as both crse@xmath1 and crte@xmath1 compounds",
    "have metastable structures , the lattice parameters were kept fixed at the experimental values when doing the calculations for the bulk.@xcite for the monolayers , when no strain is applied , the in - plane experimental lattice constants of the corresponding bulks were used .",
    "the value of the in - plane biaxial strain is defined as @xmath9 , where @xmath10 and @xmath11 are the in - plane lattice constants of the strained and unstrained monolayers , respectively . at a particular strain condition",
    ", the atomic positions were fully relaxed until the force acts on each atom was less than @xmath12 .",
    "the 1@xmath0-crse@xmath1 and crte@xmath1 compounds were found to have afm and fm ground states , respectively.@xcite they crystallize in the space group of @xmath13 ( no .",

    "1(a ) . within the sandwich layer ,",
    "the cr atoms are octahedrally coordinated and covalently bonded by the six nearest - neighboring se / te atoms , forming a hexagonal layer sandwiched between the two layers of se / te atoms .",
    "while in between the layers , the interactions are mainly of the van der waals type .    to reveal the origin of the different magnetic orderings in crse@xmath1 and crte@xmath1 compounds , we first calculate their fermi surfaces ( fs ) without spin polarizations , which are shown in figs .",
    "1(b ) and ( c ) , respectively .",
    "for the crse@xmath1 bulk , the fs is composed of two hole - like bellied cylinders , one centered along the @xmath15-@xmath16 line and the other along the @xmath17-@xmath18 line .",
    "the two bellied cylinders indicate that the fs may have a nesting feature , and the nesting vector is along the @xmath15-@xmath17 direction .",
    "the fs nesting may be the origin of the magnetic ground state , which will be discussed later .",
    "for the crte@xmath1 bulk , however , one hole - like bellied cylinder centered along the @xmath15-@xmath16 line and one electron - like cylinder centered along the @xmath19-@xmath20 line form the fs , in good agreement with the previous report.@xcite in the @xmath10-@xmath21 plane , the fs does not exhibit any nesting property .",
    "the magnetic properties may be controlled by the fs topology,@xcite which can be understood by the fourier transformed exchange coupling constant expressed as@xcite @xmath22    where @xmath23 here @xmath24 represents the fourier component of a generic perturbation , @xmath25 ) is the exchange integral , which is approximated to a constant @xmath26 in real cases , @xmath27 is the fermi - dirac distribution function , @xmath28 is the eigenvalue of the electron @xmath29 , @xmath30 refers to the real part of the electron susceptibility and @xmath31 is the total number of the @xmath29 points .",
    "the maximum of @xmath32 and thus the maximum of @xmath30 determine a periodic magnetic moment arrangement with a propagation vector * q*. we can deduce from eqs .",

    "1(d ) we can see that for crse@xmath1 , the maximum value of @xmath30 appears at @xmath33=@xmath34@xmath35+@xmath34@xmath36 , conforming the existence of the fermi - surface nesting in the crse@xmath1 bulk .",
    "the nesting vector @xmath33 indicates that there exists a magnetic configuration with a 3@xmath373@xmath371 supercell in the real space , which may correspond to the afm ground state measured in the experiment.@xcite however , in the experiment , the details of the spin ordering is not reported . as discussed later",
    ", there exists a frustration in the spins of the cr atoms in this system . a noncollinear afm configuration with the spin vectors of the nearest - neighboring cr atoms at @xmath38 to each other [ see fig .",

    "1(e ) ] , which may be responsible for the uniform arrangement of the spins ( fm configuration ) observed in the experiment .",
    "the interesting magnetic properties of crse@xmath1 and crte@xmath1 bulks inspire us to explore how their monolayer counterparts will perform , which will have potential applications in the nanoelectronics .",
    "first , we examine the ground states of crse@xmath1 and crte@xmath1 monolayers .",
    "the two collinear fm and afm magnetic configurations considered in this work are shown in figs .",
    "2(a ) and ( b ) , respectively .",
    "figure 2(c ) is the side view of the monolayer , with the cr layer sandwiched between two se or te layers .",
    "each cr atom is in the center of the octahedron formed by the nearest se / te atoms , as shown in fig .",
    "the nearest cr atoms form an equilateral triangle [ see upper left corner of fig .",
    "2(e ) ] . in the collinear afm configuration ,",
    "if we assume the spins of the cr@xmath40 and cr@xmath1 atoms are up and down , respectively , then the ( up or down ) spin of the cr@xmath41 atom will be the same as the spin of the cr@xmath40 or cr@xmath1 atom . that s to say , the spin of the cr@xmath41 atom can not align simultaneously antiparallel to the spins of cr@xmath40 and cr@xmath1 atoms , so it is frustrated .",
    "the three solutions of this spin frustration are demonstrated in fig .",
    "2(e ) , labeled as  slowromancap1@ \" ,  slowromancap2@ \" and  slowromancap3@ \" , respectively .",
    "the spin vectors of the three atoms are at @xmath38 to each other . combining these three cases together",

    "relative total energies of three different magnetic configurations [ fm , afm1 ( collinear ) and afm2 ( noncollinear ) ] as a function of the biaxial strain for ( a ) crse@xmath1 and ( b ) crte@xmath1 monolayers . ]",
    "the total energy calculations of the three different magnetic configurations [ fm , afm1 ( collinear ) and afm2 ( noncollinear ) ] show that the ground states of crse@xmath1 and crte@xmath1 monolayers are afm and fm , respectively , the same as the results of the corresponding bulk structures .",
    "for the crse@xmath1 monolayer , the energy of the noncollinear afm configuration is relatively lower than that of the collinear one , so the triangular afm spin arrangement with a 3@xmath373@xmath371 supercell is the ground state of the crse@xmath1 monolayer , which is consistent with the result of the fs nesting in the crse@xmath1 bulk as discussed above .",
    "the intrinsic magnetic ground states in the two monolayers are very useful and it is interesting to find ways to further tune the magnetic properties .    strain is a flexible method to tune the properties of 2d layers .",
    "we then study the strain - dependent magnetic properties of crse@xmath1 and crte@xmath1 monolayers .",
    "the in - plane tensile and compressive biaxial strains are applied .",
    "the relative total energies of the three different magnetic configurations as a function of the strain are shown in fig .",

    "3(a ) ] , the spin ordering tends to be fm when the tensile strain is larger than 2% .",
    "moreover , the energy difference between the fm and afm orderings becomes larger and larger as increasing the tensile strain , so the applied tensile strain can stabilize the fm state in this system .",
    "on the other hand , the crse@xmath1 monolayer remains afm when the tensile strain is smaller than 2% or the applied strain is compressive .",
    "so there exists a critical strain of 2% at which the transition between the fm and afm states takes place . for the crte@xmath1 monolayer ,",
    "it remains fm state when the tensile strain is applied .",
    "the same as in the case of crse@xmath1 monolayer , the energy difference between the fm and afm states becomes larger and larger when the tensile strain is increased .",
    "the spin ordering changes to be afm when the absolute value of the compressive strain is larger than 1% , so the critical strain of crte@xmath1 monolayer is @xmath421% .",
    "from the calculated total energies of the three different spin orderings as a function of the strain , we can see that the magnetic states of crse@xmath1 and crte@xmath1 monolayers can be effectively tuned by the external strains .",
    "relatively small strains can induce the transitions between afm and fm states in the two kinds of materials .        as both crse@xmath1 and crte@xmath1 monolayers can exhibit fm properties , it is interesting to evaluate the curie temperature @xmath43 , which is an important design parameter for practical usage .",
    "the @xmath43 of crse@xmath1/crte@xmath1 monolayers are estimated based on the mean - field theory and heisenberg model,@xcite where @xmath43 is expressed as @xmath44 . here",

    "4(a ) and ( b ) , respectively .",
    "we can see that for both crse@xmath1 and crte@xmath1 monolayers , the @xmath48@xmath49 in the fm states and therefore the @xmath43 increase as increasing the strain . for crse@xmath1 monolayer",
    ", the @xmath43 is 63.7 k at the strain of 2% .",
    "when the strain reaches 4% , the @xmath43 increases rapidly to 363.1 k , larger than the room temperature . at the largest strain of 10% ,",
    "the @xmath43 as high as 1086.5 k can be obtained . for the crte@xmath1 monolayer , as discussed above , it exhibits fm behavior when no strain is applied .",
    "the calculated energy difference @xmath46 is 28.5 mev and @xmath43 is 219.1 k , which is smaller than that of the crte@xmath1 bulk ( 310 k).@xcite however , when a small strain of 2% is applied , the @xmath43 can be enhanced above the room temperature , i.e. , 472.7 k. at the strain of 10% , the @xmath43 of crte@xmath1 monolayer can reach as high as 1022.8 k. the magnetic moments of cr ( @xmath50 ) and se / te atoms ( @xmath51 ) for crse@xmath1/crte@xmath1 monolayers are shown in fig .",
    "we can see that for both of the two materials , @xmath50 are much larger than @xmath52 or @xmath53 and increase monotonically with the increase of the applied strains .    in what follows",
    ", we will discuss the origin of the strain - induced magnetic evolution in crse@xmath1/crte@xmath1 monolayers .",
    "first , the transition between afm and fm states can roughly be explained by the stoner criterion which is expressed as @xmath54 where @xmath55 is the number of the density of states ( dos ) at the fermi energy in the nm state .",
    "figure 4(d ) shows the calculated @xmath55 as a function of the strain for crse@xmath1 and crte@xmath1 monolayers .",
    "it is clearly seen that the @xmath55 generally increases as increasing the strain . at the critical strain where the transition between the afm and fm states occurs ,",
    "the values of @xmath55 are 12.7 and 15.8 for crse@xmath1 and crte@xmath1 monolayers , respectively .",
    "when the strain is further increased , the @xmath55 increases as well , so the fm state becomes more and more stable .",
    "( a ) distance between the nearest neighboring cr atoms @xmath56 and bond length between the cr and se ( te ) atoms @xmath57 ( @xmath58 ) as a function of the applied biaxial strain for crse@xmath1 and crte@xmath1 monolayers ; ( b ) illustrations of the cr - cr direct exchange ( left panel ) and cr - se(te)-cr superexchange ( right panel ) interactions in crse@xmath1/crte@xmath1 monolayers . ]    on the other hand , we notice that when the strain is increased , the distance between a cr atom and its nearest neighboring cr atom ( denoted as @xmath56 ) increases dramatically with the increase of the strain , as shown in fig .",
    "for the crse@xmath1 ( crte@xmath1 ) monolayer , @xmath56 changes from 3.40  ( 3.79  ) without strain to 3.74  ( 4.17  ) at the strain of 10% , both increased by 10% when the strain is increased by 10% . however , the bond lengths between the cr and se ( te ) atoms [ denoted as @xmath57 ( @xmath58 ) ] increase slowly as increasing the strain . for the crse@xmath1 ( crte@xmath1 ) monolayer , @xmath57 ( @xmath58 ) changes from 2.47  ( 2.70  ) without strain to 2.54  ( 2.75  ) at the strain of 10% , increased only by 2.83% ( 1.85% ) when the strain is increased by 10% .",
    "this property can be ascribed to the sandwiched structure of crse@xmath1/crte@xmath1 monolayers .",
    "when the system is stretched in - plane , @xmath56 increases accordingly since all the cr atoms are in the same layer , while the outside se / te atom layers move closer to the cr atom layer , keeping the @xmath57 ( @xmath58 ) slightly changed . for the graphene ,",
    "since all the carbon atoms are in the same layer , the bond length increases monotonically by 10% when the tensile strain of 10% is applied .",
    "the relatively small change in the bond lengths in crse@xmath1/crte@xmath1 monolayers indicates they can withstand relatively larger tensile strains before the structural disruption and thus provide a possibility to well control the magnetic properties by a wide range of the external strain .    based upon the different behaviors of @xmath56 and @xmath57 ( @xmath58 ) upon the applied strain , the mechanism of the transition between fm and afm states and the strain - tunable stability of the fm states can be understood by the competition between two different exchange interations .",
    "first , since the @xmath56 is not very large , the direct exchange interaction between the two nearest - neighboring cr atoms ( denoted as @xmath59 ) can not be neglected , which leads to the afm arrangement of the two cr atoms [ see the left panel of fig .",
    "second , as shown in the right panel of fig .",
    "5(b ) , the two nearest - neighboring cr atoms are connected by a se / te atom , thus the superexchange interation mediated by the middle se / te atom exists . since the cr - se(te)-cr bond angle is close to @xmath60 and the number of the 3@xmath61 electrons of the cr atom is 5 , according to the goodenough - kanamori - anderson ( gka ) rules,@xcite the cr - se(te)-cr superexchange interaction ( denoted as @xmath62 ) will induce the fm arrangement of the two nearest - neighboring cr atoms .",
    "therefore , the magnetic states of crse@xmath1/crte@xmath1 monolayers are determined by @xmath63 , where @xmath59 and @xmath62 are negative and positive , respectively . for the crse@xmath1 monolayer without strain",
    ", @xmath64 is relatively larger than @xmath62 , so @xmath65 and the system exhibits afm property .",
    "when the tensile strain is applied , as discussed above , the @xmath56 increases much faster than @xmath57 , so @xmath64 decreases much faster than @xmath62 . at the critical strain of 2% , @xmath62 is equal to @xmath64 and @xmath66 .",
    "when the strain is larger than 2% , @xmath62 prevails in determining the magnetic property and @xmath67 , so the crse@xmath1 monolayer becomes fm .",
    "moreover , since @xmath64 decreases much faster than @xmath62 as increasing the strain , @xmath63 increases as a function of the strain when the strain is further increased . as a result ,",
    "the energy difference between fm and afm states becomes more and more large and the fm state is stabilized by the applied tensile strain .",
    "the case for the crte@xmath1 monolayer is very similar , except that the critical strain is compressive , of @xmath2 . for the crte@xmath1 monolayer without strain ,",
    "the @xmath64 is relatively smaller than @xmath62 , so @xmath67 and the system is fm . from the above discussion , we can see that the @xmath56 plays an important role in determining the magnetic ground states of crse@xmath1/crte@xmath1 monolayers , which has also been found in other cr - based systems.@xcite    partial density of states ( pdos ) of cr 3@xmath61 and se 4@xmath68 orbitals for the crse@xmath1 monolayer in the fm ground state at tensile strains of ( a ) 2% , ( b ) 6% , ( c ) 10% ; pdos of cr 3@xmath61 and te 5@xmath68 orbitals for the crte@xmath1 monolayer in the fm ground state at tensile strains of (",

    "it can be seen that the cr @xmath69 states are almost totally spin - polarized and become the main contribution of the magnetism , so the magnetic moments of cr atoms are much larger than those of se / te atoms , as shown in fig .",

    "the band extremum at the @xmath15 point moves below the @xmath72 , with the band extremum along the @xmath17-@xmath15 direction also residing below the @xmath72 , so the spin - down state tends to be semiconducting with a sizeable band gap of 1.58 ev .",
    "when the strain is further increased , the second extremum moves up very slowly and keeps below the @xmath72 , so the crse@xmath1 monolayer keeps half - metallic in the strain range of 12% to 16% .",

    "<S> we report on the strain - induced switch between ferromagnetic ( fm ) and antiferromagnetic ( afm ) orderings in 1@xmath0-crx@xmath1 ( x = se , te ) monolayers based on the first - principles calculations . </S>",
    "<S> the crse@xmath1 and crte@xmath1 monolayers without strains are found to be afm and fm , respectively . under the biaxial tensile strain </S>",
    "<S> , the crse@xmath1 monolayer tends to be fm when the strain is larger than 2% . </S>",
    "<S> the fm state is further stabilized when the strain is increased . moreover </S>",
    "<S> , the crse@xmath1 monolayer changes to be half - metallic when the tensile strain is larger than 10% . while for the crte@xmath1 monolayer , the critical strain at which the transition between the fm and afm states occurs is compressive , of @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> relatively small tensile strains of 4% and 2% , respectively , can enhance the curie temperature of crse@xmath1 and crte@xmath1 monolayers above the room temperature </S>",
    "<S> . the strain - induced switch between the fm and afm states in crse@xmath1 ( crte@xmath1 ) monolayer can be understood by the competition between the afm cr - cr direct exchange interaction and fm cr - se(te)-cr superexchange interaction . </S>",
    "<S> the tunable and attractive magnetic and electronic properties controlled by the flexible strain are desirable for the future nanoelectronic applications . </S>"
