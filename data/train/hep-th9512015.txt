    "epsf one of the interesting features of string theories is the existence of the critical dimension , at which a lot of fascinating events occur , including : the appearance of massless spin - one and spin - two states , the realization of lorentz covariance in the light - cone gauge@xcite , the nilpotency of the brs charge in the conformal gauge@xcite , and the cancellation of the conformal anomalies@xcite .",
    "most of these subjects have been investigated in the conformal or light - cone gauge , whereas several works have been done in the harmonic gauge .",
    "the first - quantized bosonic strings in the harmonic gauge have a relation to @xmath0 string field theory@xcite . in the latter theory , which is a free one ,",
    "the @xmath0 algebra with the brs and anti - brs generators has been shown to close at @xmath1 only .",
    "besides , the cancellation of the conformal anomaly has been studied in the harmonic gauge from a lagrangian approach , and this occurs at the same dimension@xcite . there are also other arguments in different versions of the harmonic gauge@xcite .",
    "in general , it is believed that the critical dimension is a well - defined concept .",
    "however , there have been a few contradictory results , _",
    "e.g. _ , indefiniteness of the critical dimension in the harmonic gauge@xcite . in this gauge",
    ", the dependence of a gauge parameter appears in the two - point function of the energy momentum tensor based on a perturbative calculation .",
    "the anomalous term of the two - point function would have been expected to vanish at @xmath1 , as in any other gauge , but it does not , due to its gauge dependence .",
    "this result suggests that the anomaly may disappear for any @xmath2 by adjusting the gauge parameter .",
    "there is also a study in the temporal gauge indicating that the critical dimension may not be determined as far as considering a cylinder amplitude@xcite .    in the following",
    ", we will decide the critical dimension in the harmonic gauge . in order to clarify the above discrepancy",
    ", it is necessary to analyze the anomaly more carefully .",
    "we will consider an effective action and the ward - takahashi identity for the decision of the critical dimension .",
    "moreover , we will study the ghost number anomaly . in the conformal gauge",
    ", the ghost number current has the anomaly@xcite , the integrated version of which can be interpreted as an index theorem .",
    "contrastingly , it has been known that the ghost number anomaly does not exist in the harmonic gauge@xcite .",
    "we will compute perturbatively the ghost number anomaly in the harmonic gauge with a gauge parameter considered throughout this paper .",
    "the lagrangian of two dimensional gravity coupled to matters in the harmonic gauge@xcite has the form , @xmath3 where @xmath4 and greek indices correspond to world sheet coordinates , and roman indices run from 1 to @xmath2 .",
    "@xmath5 , @xmath6 and @xmath7 denote the auxiliary field , the ghost and anti - ghost fields , respectively .",
    "it is possible to obtain a more simplified lagrangian by the redefinition of the field variables ; the shift of the auxiliary field @xmath5@xcite , @xmath8 the jacobian for this transformation is trivial and so there is no anomaly in it . after performing this shift and dropping a total derivative term",
    ", we find a lagrangian as follows , @xmath9 where @xmath10 is a gauge parameter . in the case of @xmath11 ,",
    "the lagrangian has a simpler form than before . in this paper",
    ", we will quantize the theory defined by the latter lagrangian and discuss anomalies derived from it .",
    "the action is invariant under the brs symmetry : @xmath12 moreover the faddeev - popov(fp ) conjugate transformation also leaves it invariant : @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the world sheet flat metric",
    ". therefore we find out the extended brs symmetry , which involves the anti - brs and the ghost number symmetry in addition to the brs symmetry .",
    "now let us consider the case of parameterizing the metric as follows , @xmath15 where @xmath16 .",
    "the degrees of freedom of @xmath17 are the same as the ones of @xmath18 and @xmath19 : because of the tracelessness of @xmath18 , it has two degrees of freedom , and @xmath19 has one . by substituting the expression of eq .",
    "( [ eq : exp ] ) to eq .",
    "( [ eq : lag ] ) , we obtain the following lagrangian , @xmath20 where the tensor indices are raised or lowered by the flat metric @xmath14 , and the ellipsis denotes terms of higher order than the fourth power of the fields . as a consequence of the conformal symmetry remaining in the lagrangian of eq .",
    "( [ eq : lag ] ) , there is no dependence of the conformal mode @xmath19 in it .",
    "this is the same situation as in the conformal or light - cone gauge .",
    "though the gauge fixing has not yet been performed for the conformal symmetry , it is not needed for our discussion .",
    "propagators are derived from the free part of the lagrangian : @xmath21 where we take @xmath22 to correspond to a free propagator .",
    "it is convenient , for practical calculation , to introduce light - cone coordinates , @xmath23 the associated metric is defined as @xmath24 and otherwise zero . in fig .",

    "in this paper , we have derived the anomaly for the brs and conformal symmetry in the harmonic gauge by considering the effective action instead of the energy momentum tensor .",
    "these anomalies are independent of the gauge parameter .",
    "also the critical dimension , which is 26 , is well - defined , as in other gauges .",
    "it is difficult to discuss the theory in the harmonic gauge because it can not be solved exactly , unlike in the conformal or the light - cone gauge .",
    "therefore we should treat it carefully , respecting the brs symmetry , for example , using the w - t identity for the effective action .",
    "we have shown also that the ghost number current has no anomaly in the harmonic gauge .",
    "this is a natural consequence due to fp conjugation .",
