    "<S> one can , however , qualitatively justify the square - root relation @xcite . in an ideal , isotropic 2d system </S>",

    "<S> in such a system the strength of @xmath54 at high fields thus depends not only on @xmath62 but also on the direction , i.e. , @xmath54 anisotropy is @xmath2 . if one assumes that cfs have a parabolic dispersion and an anisotropic @xmath63 whose anisotropy follows linearly the anisotropy of @xmath54 , then the _ mass _ anisotropy of cfs is given by @xmath2 , implying that their fermi wavevector anisotropy is proportional to @xmath46 .    </S>",
