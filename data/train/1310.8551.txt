    "magnetic tunnel junctions ( mtj ) are layered heterostructures in which an insulating tunnel barrier ( i ) separates two ferromagnetic layers ( f ) . they have been the subject of vigorous research in both fundamental and applied physics since they exhibit effects like tunneling magneto - resistance ( tmr )",
    "@xcite and spin - transfer torque ( stt ) ,  @xcite as well as quantum size effects in electron transport ( even at room temperature ) when normal metal ( n ) layer is inserted .",
    "@xcite from the fundamental viewpoint , these effects represent examples of nonequilibrium quantum many - body systems with an interplay of fast conduction electrons carrying spin current and slow collective magnetization , while from the viewpoint of applications they play an essential role in developing magnetic sensors , random access memory , novel programmable logic devices , resonant - tunneling spin transistors and nanoscale microwave oscillators with ultrawide operating frequency ranges .",
    "@xcite    the stt is a phenomenon in which a spin current of sufficiently large density injected into f layer either switches its magnetization from one static configuration to another or generates a dynamical situation with steady - state precessing magnetization.@xcite the origin of stt is the absorption of the itinerant flow of angular momentum components normal to the magnetization direction . for f@xmath4/i / f mtjs illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1 ] , where the reference f@xmath4 layer with fixed magnetization @xmath5 plays the role of an external spin - polarizer and right f layer has free magnetization @xmath6 , it is customary to analyze the parallel and perpendicular components of the stt vector @xmath7 .",
    "these two terms act differently on magnetization dynamics@xmath8 effectively changes the magnetic damping ( i.e. , an antidamping or additional damping depending on the current polarity ) , whereas @xmath9 acts like a magnetic field .",
    "@xcite    a majority of theoretical studies of tmr or stt effects has assumed phase - coherent tunneling of non - interacting quasiparticles .",
    "for example , such approaches  @xcite have led to a remarkable prediction of very large tmr ratio @xmath10% at zero bias voltage for clean epitaxial mgo - based mtjs .",
    "the tmr ratio is defined by @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is the resistance for parallel orientations of two magnetizations in f / i / f mtj and @xmath13 is the resistance when they are antiparallel .",
    "these predictions have ignited large experimental efforts that have eventually reached tmr ratios of more than 1000% at low temperatures and @xmath14% at room temperature for well - oriented mgo barriers with stress relaxation .",
    "@xcite the phase - coherent calculations  such as numerical ones based on the nonequilibrium green function ( negf ) formalism  @xcite combined with simplistic tight - binding hamiltonians  @xcite or first - principles obtained hamiltonians ;  @xcite as well as analytical ones  @xcite based on the scattering approach  have been able to capture the dependence of @xmath8 and @xmath9 on the bias voltages in mgo - based mtjs .",
    "@xcite however , such theories  @xcite including _ only _ elastic electron tunneling start to deviate from experimental findings at higher bias voltages , which is particularly pronounced  @xcite for @xmath9 ( playing a significant role during magnetization switching at ) .    the inelastic electron - magnon ( ) or electron - phonon ( ) scattering could account for these discrepancies .",
    "@xcite in particular , since magnon bandwidth is usually of the order of @xmath15 mev , at high bias voltages multiple magnon scattering events can be excited .",
    "@xcite also , energy dependence of the magnon density of states ( dos ) probed  @xcite at finite bias voltage is intimately linked to the evolution of the magnetization during current - driven switching when going beyond the macrospin approximation .",
    "@xcite    , is attached via hopping @xmath16 to an active region consisting of @xmath17 lattice sites ( we use @xmath18 and @xmath19 or @xmath20 in the calculations below ) .",
    "the right semi - infinite lead is attached to the active region via smaller hopping @xmath21 that simulates the tunnel barrier @xmath22 .",
    "the same sites also host localized spins which are coupled to each other via the ferromagnetic coupling @xmath23 in the heisenberg model . the local coupling between the spin of conduction electrons and localized spin on each site is of strength @xmath24 . the left and right semi - infinite leads",
    "are assumed to terminate into macroscopic fermi liquid reservoirs held at electrochemical potentials @xmath25 and @xmath26 , respectively , whose difference sets the bias voltage @xmath27 .",
    "the voltage profile across mtj is shown on the top .",
    "the left f layer is assumed to be attached at infinity to a macroscopic reservoir of magnons held at temperature @xmath28 . ]    in fact , even at small bias voltage thermally excited magnons affect tmr ( e.g. , emission or absorption of magnon at f / i interface reduces the effective spin polarization of electrons incoming from f leads in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1 ] ) , so that tmr decreases with increasing temperature .",
    "@xcite although thermally induced change of the resistance is different for alo@xmath1- and mgo - based mtjs , their inelastic tunneling spectra  @xcite ( iets ) shows very similar properties .",
    "that is , plotting the second derivative @xmath29 of current vs. bias voltage in mtjs reveals zero bias anomaly ( zba ) where peaks ( see , e.g. , fig . 2 in ref .  ) of opposite sign",
    "appear at @xmath30 mv and are related to magnons .",
    "also , additional phonon peaks are found  @xcite at for the mgo - based mtjs or at for alo@xmath1-based mtjs .",
    "theoretical efforts to capture inelastic scattering effects on tmr , zba and stt have thus far utilized simplified frameworks  @xcite which _ can not _ deal with multiple scattering events , backaction of magnons driven far from equilibrium and energy dependence of magnonic dos .",
    "such effects can be taken systematically and rigorously into account at arbitrary temperature or bias voltage by using the negf formalism coupled with perturbation expansion of electron or magnon self - energies in the presence of their mutual interaction in terms of the respective feynman diagrams .",
    "@xcite in equilibrium problems , like that of magnetic polaron , electronic self - energy has been constructed by considering large set of diagrams involving an arbitrary number of scattering vertices between the emission and absorption vertices .",
    "@xcite however , using the same diagrams within the negf framework would violate charge conservation , yielding different charge currents in the left and right lead of a two - terminal device at finite bias voltage .",
    "one of the conserving approximations is the so - called self - consistent born approximation ( scba ) where one considers hartree and fock diagrams for the electronic self - energy which corresponds to perturbation in the order @xmath31 where @xmath24 is the strength of interaction .",
    "evaluation of these diagrams for a systems defined on the lattice hosting orbitals in real space is computationally very demanding due to the fact that gf lines in the diagrams of nonequilibrium many - body perturbation theory ( mbpt ) are fully interacting ( or dressed ) , so that self - energy matrix becomes a functional of the gf matrix .",
    "this generates a coupled system of nonlinear integral equations which has to be solved by performing multiple integrations over each matrix element until the self - consistency is achieved .",
    "such route has been undertaken in only a handful of studies where further simplifications ( such as using dispersionless magnons , @xmath32 ) were utilized .",
    "@xcite    here we discuss in sec .",
    "[ sec : diagrammatics ] how to construct the electronic self - energy and gf within scba , together with the magnonic self - energy within the electron - hole ( e - h ) polarization bubble approximation which takes into account influence of electrons on magnons while inserting the dressed magnonic gf into scba diagrams .",
    "thus , consideration of such diagrams is akin to the self - consistent gw treatment of the one - particle electronic self - energy due to electron - electron interaction out of equilibrium .",
    "@xcite our approach treats these quantities as matrices  @xcite in the keldysh space , rather than following the commonly used route based on langreth rules to manipulate expressions involving products of their submatrices .",
    "@xcite this formalism is then applied to a many - body hamiltonian , introduced in sec .",

    "the sum of spin currents carried by electrons in the non - interacting f leads attached to this active region is non - zero which , therefore , allows us to quantify in sec .  [ sec : zba ] the amount of lost angular momentum of electronic subsystem that is carried away by magnonic spin current .",
    "we conclude in sec .",
    "[ sec : conclusions ] .",
    "we also provide two appendices .",
    "appendix  [ sec : conservation ] proves that charge current is conserved when electronic gf is computed by including the fock diagram only , on the proviso that its electronic gf line is dressed ( thereby requiring self - consistency ) while its magnonic gf line can be bare or dressed .",

    "[ sec : zba ] , for a function computed on the mesh of adaptively selected energy points which can be arbitrarily spaced form each other .",
    "to make the discussion transparent , we focus on the particular example of interacting many - body system out of equilibrium which emerges within the quasi-1d model of a two - terminal f / i / f mtj depicted in fig .  [ fig : fig1 ] .",

    "concurrently , the left f layer is assumed to be attached at infinity to a macroscopic reservoir of magnons held at temperature @xmath28 .    using the approximate version of the holstein - primakoff transformations  @xcite    [ eq : hp ] @xmath55    we can replace the spin operators by bosonic operators .",

    "[ fig : fig1 ] , electrons and magnons are assumed to behave as non - interacting quasiparticles .",
