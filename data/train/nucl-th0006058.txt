    "effective range function plays central role in the analysis and interpretation of two - particle low - energy scattering data .",
    "it is well known from the simplest case of s - wave scattering by a short range potential that it is more advantageous to study the effective range function @xmath0 than the phase shift @xmath1 .",
    "the former is an even function of the momentum @xmath2 and close to threshold can be expanded in a power series of @xmath3 , known as the effective range expansion .",
    "the first two coefficients in this expansion : the scattering length and the effective range , respectively , carrying important information about the underlying interaction , are regarded as fundamental parameters in low - energy scattering phenomenology . the inclusion of the long range coulomb interaction is a non - trivial complication because the latter changes dramatically the singularity structure of the scattering matrix .",
    "the coulomb corrections to the effective range parameters are not only model dependent but can be also quite sizable .",
    "especially sensitive is the scattering length where , strictly speaking , there is even no upper limit to the size of the coulomb correction , i.e. the scattering length that is finite in absence of coulomb interaction , could become infinite when coulomb interaction is turned on .",
    "perhaps the best illustration that in real life coulomb correction can be quite large is provided by the nucleon - nucleon scattering . with exact isospin invariance",
    "the nn and pp @xmath4 scattering lengths in absence of coulomb interaction should be equal but experimentally @xcite : @xmath5fm and @xmath6fm .",
    "it has been confirmed by model calculations that most of the difference in these two values may be attributed to the coulomb interaction .",
    "the analytic continuation of the effective range function to negative energies presents considerable interest as it provides simple means to locate the near - threshold singularities of the scattering matrix , that might be associated with shallow bound states . for conducting a direct calculation of the effective range function below threshold , the standard coulomb wave functions for negative energies",
    "are required , and , efficient algorithms for calculating them are currently available in the literature @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , this approach leads to difficulties as the standard coulomb wave functions are ill chosen for the purpose and for attractive coulomb potential they are singular at the coulomb bound state energies .",
    "therefore , the usual procedure employs the effective range expansion for effecting the extrapolation to negative energies .    in this work",
    "we wish to present a direct method of calculating the effective range function below threshold based on the solution of the lippmann - schwinger equation . in this equation",
    "the coulomb potential does not appear explicitly but has been accounted for exactly by introducing coulomb - modified green s function and coulomb distorted ingoing wave . by selecting a specific coulomb green s function , intimately connected with the k - matrix , we have been able to devise a calculational scheme that is free from the coulomb singularities .",
    "another advantage of the proposed method is that it provides for a simple solution of the lippmann - schwinger equation .",
    "this is a consequence of the fact that for negative energies the coulomb green s function has a separable representation of the form of a sturmian expansion so that the kernel of the integral equation becomes degenerate .",
    "the task of solving the lippmann - schwinger equation is thereby reduced to that of solving a system of linear algebraic equations .",
    "the method can be applied either for calculating the scattering matrix , or the k - matrix below threshold .",
    "in particular , this approach can be used for locating the poles of the scattering matrix what is equivalent to solving the bound state problem .",
    "the k - matrix yields the effective range function and allows to extract the low - energy scattering parameters .",
    "the plan of the presentation is as follows . in the next section we outline the lippmann - schwinger equation formalism necessary for calculating the scattering matrix as well as the k - matrix . in section 3",
    ", we employ the sturmian expansion of the coulomb green s function for converting the underlying integral equations into a system of linear algebraic equations .",
    "finally , in the last section we discuss possible applications and examine numerically the performance of the presented method .",
    "consider a two - body , two - potential quantum mechanical scattering problem with spherical symmetry where the interaction is a superposition of the coulomb potential plus a short ranged nuclear potential @xmath7 .",
    "it will be assumed in the following that the nuclear potential for large separations @xmath8 has at least exponential fall - off @xmath9 with @xmath10 being the inverse range parameter of the nuclear force . for small @xmath8 ,",
    "we assume that the behaviour of @xmath7 is not worse than @xmath11 .",
    "the coulomb potential corresponding to point - like charges is taken as @xmath12 where @xmath13 is dimensionless strength parameter @xmath14(@xmath15 ) for attraction ( repulsion ) and @xmath16 is the fine structure constant .",
    "the effective range function is defined as the inverse of the k - matrix @xmath17 and is related to the scattering matrix by means of a generalized heitler formula @xmath18 where @xmath19 denotes the orbital momentum and the independent complex variable @xmath2 on the positive real axis becomes the physical c.m .",
    "momentum and the complex function @xmath20 can be interpreted as a generalized barrier penetration factor .",
    "this function has been studied in several papers @xcite , and , @xmath21^{2}$ ] for @xmath22 , whereas for @xmath23 its explicit form is @xmath24 ^ 2   \\prod_{m=0}^{\\ell}(1+m^{2}/\\eta^{2 } )    \\nonumber \\\\ \\lo{\\times }   \\left \\{{\\textstyle{\\frac{1}{2}}}\\left [ \\psi(1+\\rmi   \\eta)+\\psi(1-\\rmi   \\eta ) \\right ]   -(\\pi/2)\\cot(\\rmi \\eta\\pi)-\\log(\\rmi \\mu |z|/k ) \\right \\ } ,   \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath25 , @xmath26 is the reduced mass of the system and @xmath27 denotes the logarithmic derivative of the gamma function .",
    "we choose the units system where @xmath28 . in the complex function @xmath29",
    "is the scattering matrix that will be obtained from the solution of the lippmann - schwinger equation incorporating the appropriate boundary condition @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the sought for wave function . in order to account for the coulomb interaction , in the ingoing plane wave has been replaced by the regular coulomb wave function @xmath32 and , respectively , the free resolvent by the coulomb green s function @xmath33 satisfying the outgoing wave boundary condition .",
    "it is easily checked that acting on both sides of with the coulomb hamiltonian , we retrieve the schrdinger equation appropriate for the two - potential problem under consideration .",
    "given the solution of , the scattering matrix @xmath29 is obtained from the formula @xmath34 where the regular coulomb solution @xmath32 satisfying the following boundary condition at @xmath35 @xmath36 is well known @xcite and can be expressed analytically as @xmath37 where @xmath38 denotes the confluent hypergeometric function @xcite . since the boundary condition is independent of @xmath2 , it is evident that @xmath32 must be entire analytic function of @xmath3 for every non - negative value of @xmath8 and is real for real @xmath3 .    for physical momenta @xmath2 the function @xmath29 is related to the coulomb modified nuclear phase shift @xmath39 @xmath40 where @xmath41^{2 } }    \\prod_{m=0}^{\\ell}\\left ( 1+\\frac{m^{2}}{\\eta^{2}}\\right ) ,   \\label{e6a}\\ ] ] and @xmath42 .",
    "\\label{e6b}\\ ] ] although for physical momenta @xmath2 the functions @xmath43 and @xmath20 are both complex but their imaginary parts are equal in magnitude and have opposite signs . indeed ,",
    "in this case from , one has @xmath44/",
    "c_{0}(\\eta)^{2 } + \\rmi   k \\right \\}\\ ] ] so that using and in , the imaginary parts are cancelled and the resulting effective range function is real , as it should be . however , the effective range function is known to be real analytic function of @xmath3 , so that it must be real also on the imaginary axis . for @xmath2",
    "located on the positive imaginary axis the green s function and @xmath32 are both real what implies that @xmath29 is necessarily real as well .",
    "also the function @xmath20 is real on the imaginary axis @xmath45 ^ 2   \\prod_{m=0}^{\\ell}(1-m^{2}/\\bar{\\eta}^{2 } )   \\nonumber \\\\ \\lo{\\times }   \\left \\{{\\textstyle{\\frac{1}{2}}}\\left [ \\psi(1+\\bar{\\eta})+\\psi(1-\\bar{\\eta } ) \\right ]   -(\\pi/2)\\cot(\\bar{\\eta}\\pi)-\\log(|\\bar{\\eta}|)\\right \\ } ,   \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath46 and this ensures that the ensuing effective range function is real .",
    "it should be noted that in the poles in @xmath47 are cancelled with those from the cotangent term and only the poles coming from @xmath48 will survive , they correspond to the coulomb bound states .    to complete the above scheme for calculating the effective range function we need the explicit formula for the coulomb green s function .",
    "the latter involves a product of the regular @xmath49 and the irregular @xmath50 coulomb wave functions ( with @xmath51 ) defined in @xcite , and takes the form @xmath52    \\ ; f_{\\ell}(\\eta,\\rho_{<}),\\ ] ] where @xmath53 .",
    "actually , the k - matrix can be calculated directly , i.e. without reference to the scattering matrix @xmath29 . to this end , a different green s function that is real analytic function of @xmath3 will be introduced .",
    "such green s function , denoted hereafter as @xmath54 to emphasize its connection with the k - matrix , can be easily constructed and reads @xmath55 indeed , the above green s function has all what it takes . for physical momenta the imaginary parts in the two terms on the right hand side of cancel each other and @xmath56 is real . for @xmath2 values located on the positive imaginary axis both terms are real and",
    "so is @xmath56 .",
    "using spectral representation of @xmath33 , it is easy to verify that the coulomb bound state poles , present in @xmath57 for attractive coulomb potential , will be exactly cancelled with the corresponding poles that occur in @xmath20 ( cf . ) . as a result ,",
    "the green s function @xmath58 given by is free from the coulomb singularities and is a real analytic function of @xmath3 in any finite part of the complex k - plane for non - negative @xmath8 and @xmath59 .",
    "the k - matrix will be obtained from the solution of a lippmann - schwinger equation that parallels equation @xmath60 where @xmath61 is a new wave function that differs from @xmath31 by a constant factor .",
    "given the solution of , the k - matrix is calculated from the formula @xmath62 and the above function is meromorphic in any finite part of the k - plane .",
    "it is easy to check that setting @xmath63\\,u_{\\ell}(k , r)$ ] in and using  , we immediately retrieve the heitler formula .",
    "this shows that the green s function is unique for a given choice of @xmath20 .",
    "it should be recalled here that @xmath20 is not free from ambiguities and can be determined only up to a polynomial in @xmath3 ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) but the latter is normally set equal to zero .",
    "this has been also our choice in the present work .",
    "the green s function can be also cast into an alternative form which is on a par with @xmath64 where the imposed asymptotic boundary condition has been made explicit .",
    "the irregular coulomb wave function @xmath65 present in has been introduced in @xcite .",
    "the latter is a real analytic function of @xmath3 for non - negative @xmath8 and can be expressed as a superposition of the standard coulomb functions @xmath66 admittedly , the asymptotic behaviour ( @xmath67 ) of this function is rather complicated but it is worth to pay such a price in view of the fact that the green s function given by is manifestly a real analytic function of @xmath3 , and , as such , can be systematically expanded in a taylor series in powers of @xmath3 .",
    "the form is particularly useful for calculating the k - matrix at @xmath68 . following @xcite",

    "finally , the sign ambiguity in , reflecting the coexistence in the literature of two different definitions of the scattering length , has been resolved by adhering to the generally accepted convention that @xmath80 sign applies for baryon ",
    "baryon scattering and @xmath81 sign in all remaining cases .",
    "when the scattering matrix has a bound state pole at @xmath82 , then from we obtain an equation for the binding energy @xmath83 involving the effective range function continued below threshold @xmath84 for shallow bound states the effective range function can be continued below threshold by employing the expansion .",
    "formula correlates then experimentally measurable quantities : the low - energy scattering parameters and the binding energy in a model independent way .",
    "following the scheme devised in the preceding section , the scattering matrix and the k - matrix will be obtained by solving a dedicated lippmann - schwinger equation .",
    "actually , the solution of the latter below threshold presents a quite simple task thanks to the sturmian representation of the coulomb green s function .",
    "the sturmians , or sturm - liouville functions @xcite @xmath85 , where @xmath86 is a free parameter ( @xmath87 ) are enumerated by the nodal quantum number @xmath88 and result as solution of the differential equation @xmath89s_{\\ell \\nu } ( b , r)=0 ,   \\label{s11}\\ ] ] with the following boundary conditions imposed , respectively , at zero , and at infinity @xmath90 the eigenfunctions are given in a closed form @xmath91^{1/2 }   ( 2 b   r)^{\\ell + 1 } \\rme^{- b   r}l_{\\nu}^{2 \\ell + 1}(2 b   r ) ,   \\label{s15}\\ ] ] where @xmath92 denotes laguerre polynomial .",
    "the functions are orthogonal and form a complete set with respect to the weight function @xmath93 .    for @xmath94 the coulomb green s function @xmath95 turns out to be diagonal in a very specific sturmian basis , namely when the parameter @xmath86 has been set equal to @xmath96 .",
    "therefore , in coordinate representation , following @xcite , we have @xmath97 but it should be clearly stated that for real @xmath2 the above series _ diverges _ so that is invalid for physical momenta .",
    "formula is quite remarkable in that the green s function is given as a sum of the poles at the coulomb bound states yet the same expression holds for coulomb repulsion as well as in the coulomb - free case . unlike the function @xmath20 , the green s function is analytic function of the coulomb strength parameter @xmath13 .",
    "most importantly , however , the residues in factorize what results in a separable representation very useful in practical applications .",
    "in particular , this implies that the kernel of the lippmann - schwinger equation either , or becomes degenerate .",
    "with such a simplification the solution of equation is straightforward . setting @xmath98 with real @xmath99 and inserting together with in , the solution of is @xmath100\\phi_{\\ell}(k , r )    -\\frac{\\mu}{p}\\,\\sum_{\\nu=0}^{\\infty }   \\frac{s_{\\ell\\nu}(p , r)\\,x_{\\ell\\nu}(p)}{\\ell+1+\\nu+\\bar{\\eta}},\\ ] ] where @xmath101 in order to determine the unknown coefficients @xmath102 , as well as the k - matrix , the expression for @xmath61 is inserted in and in .",

    "when the resulting finite set of linear algebraic equations has been solved by any of the standard methods , one of the solutions contains the k - matrix .",
    "the scattering matrix @xmath29 can be calculated in a similar way . by inserting in ,",
    "we get @xmath111 where the new expansion coefficients defined as @xmath112 are obtained by solving the following system of linear algebraic equations @xmath113\\,y_{\\ell\\nu^{\\prime}}(p )    = a_{\\ell\\nu}(p).\\ ] ] using in , we arrive at the ultimate expression for the scattering matrix @xmath114.\\ ] ] similarly as before , for practical purposes the infinite sturmian basis must be approximated by a finite dimensional one .",
    "the values of @xmath2 for which the determinant of the system vanishes correspond to the bound states . for attractive coulomb potential ( @xmath14 )",
    "they are infinite in number , all shifted from the pure coulomb position owing to the nuclear interaction . for @xmath115",
    "the bound states may , or may not exist , depending upon the nature of the nuclear potential .",
    "since the case of bound states has been discussed elsewhere @xcite , we assume in the following that for the considered @xmath2 value the system of equations is non - singular .",
    "once @xmath29 has been determined , the effective range function may be obtained by making use of heitler formula but this approach is equivalent to solving the system of equations and .",
    "the determinant of that system may also vanish at some values of @xmath2 and they correspond to poles of the k - matrix . clearly , the poles of the scattering matrix are distinct from the poles of the k - matrix .    the proposed scheme has , of course , its limitations and breaks down not only for large @xmath116 but also for very small @xmath116 .",
    "the large @xmath116 limit is rather obvious and stems from the fact that for large @xmath8 the regular coulomb wave function @xmath32 increases like @xmath117 and therefore the born term integral diverges for @xmath118 .",
    "consequently , the largest admitted @xmath116 value is determined by the range of the nuclear potential .",
    "there is also a lower bound for @xmath116 , as in the limit of small @xmath116 the convergence rate of the sturmian expansion gradually deteriorates eventually rendering the whole scheme impractical .",
    "the lower limit for @xmath116 , according to our experience , depends upon the characteristics of the nuclear potential .",
    "in this situation , the effective range function must be extrapolated to zero .",
    "if the extrapolation is not satisfactory the k - matrix at @xmath68 can be obtained by solving the lippmann - schwinger equation with the green s function given by . although the kernel is not degenerate in that case but the resulting integral equation can be easily solved by standard methods .",
    "another alternative is a numerical integration of the appropriate schrdinger equation . a  stepwise integration of the latter from @xmath35 up to some large @xmath119 , well beyond the range of the nuclear potential , yields the regular solution @xmath120 and the derivative @xmath121 .",
    "with these two functions in hand , the effective range function is @xmath122 }          { w[u_{\\ell}(0,r),\\phi_{\\ell}(0,r)]},\\ ] ] where @xmath123=f\\,g'-g\\,f'$ ] denotes the wronskian determinant and the coulomb wave functions are given by and , respectively .",
    "in order to examine the performance of the calculational scheme presented in the preceding section , the sturmian expansion method will be subjected to a rather demanding test . to achieve this goal , for the nuclear potential @xmath7",
    "we have selected reid nucleon - nucleon @xmath4 potential @xcite .",
    "this potential is given as a superposition of three yukawa potentials , has a one - pion - exchange tail and a short range very strong repulsive term .",
    "since the shape of this potential shows a good deal of structure comprising of attraction and repulsion , the rank @xmath124 of the sturmian approximation must be large enough to account for the rapid variation of the potential .",
    "in addition to that , the other unfavourable circumstance is that the long one - pion - exchange tail greatly reduces the range of the admissible momenta which must not exceed @xmath125  mev . in the actual computations , we have been able to determine the effective range function in the interval @xmath126 .",
    "the rank of the sturmian approximation @xmath124 at which convergence has been attained varied from about hundred to several hundred at the low - energy end .",
    "it is perhaps worth noting that when @xmath7 has a yukawa shape then all the necessary integrals are given in an analytic form . to be more explicit",

    "the expectation value of the potential in the sturmian basis is obtained from @xmath130 where @xmath131 .",
    "finally , the born term , takes the form @xmath132 where @xmath133 . in the above expressions we assumed that @xmath134 and @xmath135 denotes the hypergeometric function .",
    "the effective range functions resulting from our computations are presented in figure  1 as functions of the c.m .",
    "energy @xmath136 .",
    "the calculations have been carried out for three values of the coulomb strength parameter @xmath13 : @xmath137 and @xmath22 .",
    "strictly speaking , attractive coulomb potential would be appropriate for the proton - antiproton pair .",
    "however , in that case the reid potential , devised to fit the nucleon - nucleon scattering data , is not applicable and the inferred effective range parameters have no relevance to proton - antiproton scattering .",
    "nevertheless , this case is of theoretical interest and has been included here for testing purposes . in figure  1 the continuous curves above threshold result from a numerical integration of the appropriate schrdinger equation .",
    "the entries below threshold , depicted by asterisk symbols on the plot , have been obtained by using the sturmian expansion method .",
    "as expected , close to @xmath138 the values of the effective range function calculated below and above threshold appear to be lying on the same straight line . in order to qualify that statement , the values calculated below threshold",
    "have been subsequently used to extrapolate each of the three functions to zero .",
    "this gave the intersection points at zero together with the slopes of the curves .",
    "the scattering lengths and effective ranges , extracted that way with the aid of , are presented in table  i ( referred to as  below  ) . for comparison , we give also their counterparts calculated from the above threshold solutions of the schdinger equation ( referred to as `` above '' in table  i ) . the agreement between",
    "the below threshold and the above threshold computations is in all three cases very good .",
    "the error on @xmath79 is slightly bigger than that on @xmath78 , as the computation of the former involves the differences of the function values what results in some loss of accuracy .",
    "the effective range seems to be little affected by the coulomb interaction what is also reflected in figure  1 in that the three curves have almost the same slope near zero .",
    "by contrast , the coulomb corrections to the scattering length are quite large especially for coulomb attraction when @xmath78 has been pushed far away to positive values .",
    "the k - matrix , unlike the effective range function , shows rapid variation as function of energy and in all three cases exhibits a pole not far from the origin . at the pole the effective range function goes to zero , so that the actual positions of the poles of the k - matrix are apparent from figure  1 .",
    "it is interesting to note that for attractive coulomb potential the pole of the k - matrix lies in the physical region , very close to threshold .",
    "this example is rather instructive , because it shows that any phenomenological attempt to approximate here the k - matrix by a polynomial in @xmath3 , with coefficients to be fitted to the low - energy data , would have a disastrous effect .",
    "the problem is immediately alleviated when instead of the k - matrix the effective range function is employed .    the two - potential problem considered in this work can be easily generalized to comprise complex nuclear potentials .",
    "such potentials appear in various problems of nuclear physics and , in particular , they have been widely used for a phenomenological description of the hadronic atoms phenomena .",
    "the introduction of a complex nuclear potential into the description of a hadronic atom has two observable effects : a shift @xmath139 in the energy of the otherwise hydrogen - like level position , and a broadening @xmath140 of the atomic level arising from the fact that the system can now decay through the absorptive strong interaction .",
    "when the orbital momentum is large enough the level shift in a hadronic atom is usually quite small in comparison with the coulomb energy .",
    "this observation has prompted several authors ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) to introduce small shift approximation ( ssa ) based on the idea that if atomic bound state pole has been shifted from the coulomb position @xmath141 , where @xmath142 is the principal quantum number , by @xmath143 then @xmath144 can be regarded as a small expansion parameter .",
    "one of the implications of ssa is the shift formula expressing the energy shift in a hadronic atom in terms of hadron - nucleus low - energy scattering parameters .",
    "this formula relating only experimentally measurable quantities without reference to the underlying nuclear potential has very important phenomenological applications .    in order to derive the shift formula we are going to obtain an approximate solution of the bound state equation . as mentioned before , the function @xmath20 that enters is singular at @xmath145 and for @xmath2 such that @xmath146 is small in comparison with the separation of the unperturbed levels @xmath147 , we can approximate @xmath20 by a single pole term @xmath148 the residue @xmath149 can be worked out from the definition of @xmath20 and reads @xmath150 where the normalization integral , is @xmath151^{2}}{4|k_{n}|^{2 \\ell+3 } ( \\ell + n)!}.   \\label{z21}\\ ] ] in order to obtain an approximate solution of equation it is assumed that the left hand side is a slowly varying function of @xmath2 so that @xmath152 may be replaced by @xmath153 . using the single pole approximation , the solution of is @xmath154 ,   \\label{z33}\\ ] ] and this yields the level shift formula in its most general form @xmath155 where @xmath156 and it is understood that for complex @xmath7 the k - matrix is necessarily also complex .",
    "approximating in the k - matrix by the scattering length one obtains the celebrated deser  trueman formula @xcite .",
    "however , the latter approximation is hardly necessary as the k - matrix below threshold can be calculated with the same amount of labour by using the sturmian expansion method described in the preceding section .",
    "the other alternative , that does not require the ssa ansatz , is to locate the poles of the scattering matrix . using sturmian expansion , the problem reduces to finding the values of @xmath2 at which the determinant of the system vanishes ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) .    in conclusion",
    ", we have presented a simple and efficient method for calculating the effective range function below threshold and the same calculational scheme can be used for solving the bound state problem .",
    "the main advantage of the proposed method lies in the exact treatment of the coulomb interaction what is accomplished by using the lippmann - schwinger equation whose kernel involves the coulomb green s function . since this kernel below threshold assumes degenerate form , the solution of the integral equation is straightforward .",
    "the essential point is that the coulomb green s function and the regular coulomb wave function , constituting input to the lippmann - schwinger equation , are real analytic functions of @xmath3 , free from coulomb singularities .",
    "both are given in analytic form suitable for numerical computations and the irregular coulomb wave function is never needed .",
