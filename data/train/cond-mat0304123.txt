    "the possible occurrence of solitons in a bose - einstein condensate ( bec ) was theoretically predicted sometime ago , within a one - dimensional ( 1d ) gross - pitaevskii model @xcite , but experimental observation was delayed because of the absence of a physical realization of a strictly 1d bose gas .",
    "nonetheless , similar coherent structures were recently observed in becs confined in traps of varying geometry @xcite by a method ( phase imprinting ) that was directly inspired by the analytical structure of 1d solitons .",
    "yet it has become clear that quasi-1d solitons are susceptible to various instabilities within the three - dimensional ( 3d ) environment of realistic traps .    indeed , a stability analysis based on the linear bogoliubov - de gennes ( bdg ) equations @xcite revealed that an axisymmetric soliton is stable only at sufficiently low particle number or high aspect ratio in an elongated trap .",
    "the primary mode of instability was shown to result from non - axisymmetric perturbations , in the sense that a purely imaginary eigenvalue first appears in the spectrum of the bdg equations with azimuthal angular momentum @xmath0 .",
    "this  snake instability  was further analyzed in ref .",
    "@xcite and argued to be responsible for a possible decay of a soliton into vortex rings and/or vortices .",
    "in fact , based on the above theoretical work , non - stationary vortex rings were experimentally detected in a spherical trap @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , brand and reinhardt @xcite suggested that the primitive mode associated with the snake instability is a stable structure that may be called solitonic vortex .",
    "the emerging picture is sufficiently perplexing to deserve closer attention . in some recent work",
    "@xcite we have carried out a detailed calculation of axisymmetric solitons in a cylindrical trap , which were shown to become unstable at high particle density even if we restrict ourselves to radial ( @xmath1 ) perturbations .",
    "the soliton was then shown to bifurcate to an axisymmetric vortex ring with lower energy . here",
    ", we complete this work by allowing azimuthal deformations of the soliton , in order to eventually account for the primary ( @xmath0 ) instability discussed in ref .",
    "we thus obtain a reasonably complete description of the two basic modes of instability of the soliton and the corresponding bifurcations to axisymmetric vortex rings and non - axisymmetric solitonic vortices .",
    "the simplest theoretical picture is obtained in the ideal limit of an infinitely elongated cylindrical trap , because static solitary waves may then be treated on equal footing with those propagating at nonzero velocity .",
    "hence , all calculations presented in the main text pertain to an infinite cylindrical trap . in sec .",
    "ii we formulate the problem and briefly describe the numerical methods employed .",
    "the three basic types of static solitary waves ( solitons , solitonic vortices , and vortex rings ) and their relative stability are discussed in sec .",

    "the main conclusions are summarized in sec .",
    "v , and some important technical details are relegated to two appendices . in particular , the case of a finite axisymmetric trap is discussed in appendix b.",
    "an axisymmetric harmonic trap is characterized by a transverse confinement frequency @xmath2 and a longitudinal frequency @xmath3 .",
    "we first consider the special limit of a cylindrical trap , with @xmath4 , a restriction that is relaxed only in appendix b. in this limit , physical units are rationalized as in ref .",
    "thus time is measured in units of @xmath5 and distance in units of the transverse oscillator length @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the mass of each atom .",
    "complete specification of the system also requires as input the linear density @xmath8 which is equal to the average number of particles per unit length of the cylindrical trap .",
    "an important dimensionless parameter is then given by @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the scattering length .",
    "a field rescaled according to @xmath11 satisfies the rationalized gross - pitaevskii equation @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the trapping potential and @xmath14 is a dimensionless coupling constant that is the only free parameter .",

    "( [ eq:1 ] ) is given by @xmath15 and yields energy in units of @xmath16 where @xmath17 .",
    "we have also considered various forms of dissipative dynamics , mainly as relaxation algorithms for the calculation of stationary states .",
    "the simplest possibility is to make the replacement @xmath18 in eq .",
    "( [ eq:1 ] ) , where @xmath19 is some dissipation constant .",
    "an extreme special case widely employed in numerical simulations @xcite is the fully - dissipative dynamics obtained by the replacement @xmath20 .",
    "however , in either case , particle number conservation is violated and special precautions are necessary to enforce a definite number of particles .",
    "an interesting alternative that preserves particle number was originally introduced by carlson @xcite for the study of the homogeneous bec and is simply adapted to the case of a confined bec .",
    "actually , we have employed a special case of carlson s dissipative dynamics governed by @xmath21 an immediate consequence of eq .",
    "( [ eq:3 ] ) is the continuity equation @xmath22 irrespective of the specific value of the dissipation constant @xmath19 . here",
    ", @xmath23 is the local particle density and @xmath24 is the usual current density , where @xmath25 is the phase of the wave function @xmath26 .",

    "( [ eq:2 ] ) dissipates according to @xmath27 as long as the particle density @xmath28 remains time dependent .",
    "although both types of dissipation discussed above are employed in our numerical calculations , carlson s proposal has some advantages for our current purposes .",
    "we have thus developed a discrete version of eq .",

    "these estimates are then fed into a newton - raphson algorithm of the type considered in ref .",

    "the latter algorithm is currently upgraded to a fully-3d iterative scheme that does not necessarily enforce axial symmetry .",

    "the presence in eq .",
    "( [ eq:11 ] ) of a term that is proportional to the chemical potential @xmath31 ensures that we are calculating the energy difference between two states with the same number of particles .    in recent work",
    "@xcite we restricted ourselves to axisymmetric states described by a wave function of the form @xmath45 .",
    "the simplest possibility is a static ( black ) soliton whose wave function is odd under the parity reflection @xmath46 , and purely imaginary in view of the phase convention adopted in eq .",
    "( [ eq:10 ] ) .",
    "the excitation energy of a static soliton calculated from eq .",
    "( [ eq:11 ] ) is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] as a function of the dimensionless coupling constant @xmath37 .",
    "when @xmath37 exceeds the critical value @xmath47 , a new class of axisymmetric solitary waves emerges with the standard characteristics of vortex rings @xcite . unlike the case of a homogeneous bec , a vortex ring may now be static and is described by a _",
    "complex _ wave function that satisfies the parity relation @xmath48 .",
    "the calculated excitation energy of a static vortex ring is also shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] and is seen to smoothly bifurcate from the soliton branch at the critical coupling @xmath49 , while it remains consistently lower than the soliton energy for @xmath50 . therefore , one may conclude that a radial ( @xmath1 ) perturbation of a soliton will render it unstable when @xmath50 and eventually transform it into an axisymmetric vortex ring .",
    "one is tempted to presume that the soliton is stable for @xmath51 . however , the linear stability analysis of ref .",
    "@xcite indicates that the primary soliton instability sets in at a lower critical coupling @xmath52 through azimuthal ( @xmath0 ) perturbations . to probe for such a possibility",
    ", we solve the dissipative eq .",

    "we thus obtain a static solitary wave that is partially illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig:2 ] for @xmath55 through density plots over two planes that are perpendicular to each other and both contain the @xmath56 axis .",
    "we have furthermore examined the phase to establish that the calculated wave function describes a deformed vortex that pierces through the trap in a direction that is perpendicular to its symmetry ( @xmath56 ) axis . in fig .",
    "[ eq:2 ] , the vortex axis is identified with the @xmath57 axis as a matter of convention , whereas a degenerate class of equivalent configurations may be obtained by simple azimuthal rotations around the @xmath56 axis . the resulting solitary",
    "wave displays the characteristics of a solitonic vortex calculated earlier by brand and reinhardt @xcite in traps of varying geometry .",
    "the energy of the solitonic vortex is depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] as a function of @xmath37 and is seen to emerge from the soliton branch at the critical coupling @xmath58 , while it remains smaller than the energy of both the soliton and the vortex ring for all @xmath54 .",
    "the physical picture can be explained by returning to the initial - value problem associated with the dissipative eq .",
    "( [ eq:3 ] ) using the static soliton as initial condition .",
    "as mentioned already , the soliton remains stable for @xmath59 but decays into a solitonic vortex when @xmath60 .",
    "the pattern is more complex for @xmath50 where the soliton initially deforms radially to become an axisymmetric vortex ring which eventually decays into a stable solitonic vortex .",
    "therefore , a vortex ring is strictly speaking unstable .",
    "but our real - time simulations indicate that vortex rings are sufficiently long lived to be observed , as was actually the case in the experiment of ref .",
    "@xcite  albeit in the special limit of a spherical trap . on the other hand , it is curious that the predicted solitonic vortex has not yet been seen in experiment .",
    "the picture is completed with a few remarks .",
    "one should expect that there exists a series of additional critical couplings ( densities ) at which the soliton bifurcates into multiple vortex rings and/or solitonic vortices .",
    "for example , a double vortex ring was calculated in ref .",
    "@xcite for @xmath61 .",
    "in other words , we have only described the two basic patterns of instability that correspond to the appearance of unstable modes in the @xmath1 and @xmath0 sectors of the linear bdg equations .",
    "these two modes may be dominant at intermediate densities , but more complicated patterns should be expected to occur at higher densities , as is evident in the experiment of ref .",
    "@xcite which is further discussed in appendix b.",
    "all three types of static solitary waves discussed in the preceding section are special members of a more general class of stationary states that propagate along the cylindrical trap with constant velocity @xmath62 .",
    "these are obtained by making the substitution @xmath63 in eq .",
    "( [ eq:1 ] ) , with @xmath64 , to derive the stationary differential equation @xmath65 which reduces to the static equation ( [ eq:7 ] ) at @xmath66 .",
    "the boundary conditions ( [ eq:9 ] ) and the parity relation ( [ eq:10 ] ) are also generalized by the simple replacement @xmath67 .",
    "equation ( [ eq:12 ] ) is solved by feeding a static ( @xmath66 ) solitary wave into the newton - raphson algorithm and by upgrading the velocity typically in steps of @xmath68 .",
    "the results for axisymmetric solitons and vortex rings already presented in ref .",
    "@xcite have been confirmed using the currently employed fully-3d algorithm .",
    "therefore , in the following , we shall mostly discuss the case of a moving solitonic vortex for which no calculation has been given in the literature .",
    "the static solitonic vortex of fig .",
    "[ fig:2 ] is significantly reshaped when it moves , as is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig:3 ] for two values of the velocity ( @xmath69 and 0.8 ) that are both smaller than the speed of sound @xmath70 calculated for @xmath55 @xcite .",
    "the @xmath69 entry of fig .",
    "[ fig:3 ] makes it clear that a moving solitonic vortex is shifted off center .",
    "while the vortex axis remains within the basal @xmath71 plane , it is clearly displaced away from the center of the trap . the displacement increases with increasing speed until we reach a critical speed @xmath72 where the vortex disappears from the trap , in the sense that the solitary wave is converted into a gray axisymmetric soliton .",
    "this implies , in particular , that the density plots over the @xmath73 and @xmath74 planes become identical , as is apparent in the @xmath75 entry of fig .",
    "[ fig:3 ] .",
    "for @xmath76 the calculated solitary wave is indeed identical to a moving axisymmetric soliton and reduces to a weakly nonlinear soundlike pulse in the limit @xmath77 .",
    "a corollary of this discussion is that a high - speed soliton can be stable even for couplings @xmath37 that are greater than the critical coupling @xmath58 , in apparent agreement with a similar conclusion reached in ref .",
    "@xcite that is now made more precise . specifically , for @xmath59 a solitonic vortex does not exist and the soliton is stable over the entire range of velocities @xmath78 , as expected . for @xmath54 ,",
    "the soliton is stable over the limited range @xmath76 , where @xmath79 is the critical speed at which the solitonic vortex is converted into a soliton and @xmath80 is the calculated speed of sound @xcite .",
    "clearly , @xmath81 , while a numerical investigation of the ratio @xmath82 shows that it approaches unity with increasing @xmath37 .",
    "however , we are not in a position to ascertain whether or not there exists a finite ( critical ) @xmath37 above which @xmath83 and , hence , the soliton is not stable for any velocity . in any case",
    ", the solitonic vortex is the fundamental mode as long as @xmath54 .",
    "further insight into the nature of a moving solitonic vortex is obtained by considering the behavior of its phase @xmath84 in the asymptotic limits @xmath85 .",
    "let @xmath86 be the two asymptotic values of the phase , which are , in principle , some functions of @xmath57 and @xmath87 .",
    "however , detailed numerical evidence suggests that @xmath88 and @xmath89 are , in fact , constants that depend only on the velocity @xmath62 .",
    "this conclusion may be substantiated in part by an analytical argument briefly described in appendix a. therefore , the asymptotic phase difference @xmath90 depends only on the velocity @xmath62 and characterizes a solitary wave .",
    "incidentally , the above conclusion applies to all three types of solitary waves discussed in the present paper and is pertinent to their experimental production through phase imprinting @xcite .    as an illustration",
    ", we return to the solitonic vortex calculated for @xmath55 and plot @xmath91 as a function of velocity by a solid line in fig .",
    "[ fig:4 ] , whereas the corresponding result for an axisymmetric soliton at @xmath55 is shown by a dashed line . in both cases ,",
    "@xmath92 for @xmath66 , and @xmath93 ( mod @xmath94 ) in the extreme limits @xmath95 which are not actually reached in fig .",
    "[ fig:4 ] due to numerical inaccuracies .",
    "the same figure provides clear evidence for the conversion of a solitonic vortex into an axisymmetric soliton at the critical speed @xmath72 or @xmath96 .",
    "the preceding discussion of the asymptotic phase is also pertinent to the definition of the impulse of a solitary wave @xcite which is now simplified to @xmath97 where @xmath98 is the usual linear momentum and @xmath99 is given by eq .",
    "( [ eq:13 ] ) .",
    "the impulse @xmath100 is measured in units of @xmath101 .    a solitary wave",

    "are definite functions of the velocity @xmath62 that can be eliminated to yield the dispersion @xmath103 .",
    "a nontrivial check of consistency is provided by the group velocity relation @xmath104 which was accurately confirmed by our numerical calculation . for comparison purposes , we reproduce in fig .  [ fig:5 ] the dispersion of a stable axisymmetric soliton calculated for @xmath105 in ref .",
    "this dispersion displays the characteristics of a mode originally derived by lieb @xcite within a full quantum treatment of a homogeneous 1d bose gas based on the bethe ansatz , and was later rederived by a semiclassical calculation based on the solitary wave of the 1d gross - pitaevskii model @xcite .",
    "a similar mode was also derived within an effective 1d model that is designed to approximately describe a cylindrical trap @xcite .",
    "we are now in a position to calculate the dispersion of a moving solitonic vortex .",
    "the dispersion is shown by a solid line in fig .",
    "[ fig:6 ] and is seen to retain the basic characteristics of a lieb - type mode .",
    "we further plot by a dashed line the dispersion of an axisymmetric soliton which is expected to be unstable at @xmath55 . however , the two dispersions shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:6 ] merge at two critical points that correspond to velocities @xmath106 where @xmath107 is the critical speed at which the solitonic vortex is converted into an axisymmetric soliton .",
    "a subtle detail not seen in our limited illustrations is that the calculated soliton for @xmath55 exhibits some ringlike features , when @xmath108 , which are not present for @xmath66 and also disappear before reaching the critical speed @xmath109 .",
    "these features could be viewed as preliminary signals for the formation of fully - fledged vortex rings that occur for stronger couplings in the region @xmath110 .    since a detailed calculation of both static and moving vortex rings",
    "was already described in ref .",
    "@xcite , we merely complete the picture by illustrating in fig .",
    "[ fig:7 ] the dispersions of a soliton , a vortex ring , as well as a solitonic vortex calculated for @xmath111 where all three possibilities occur according to the bifurcation pattern of fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] .",
    "the solitonic vortex is still characterized by a lieb - type dispersion that merges with the dispersion of the vortex ring at the critical speed @xmath112 , where @xmath113 is the speed of sound calculated at @xmath111 . for @xmath76 both the solitonic vortex and the vortex ring become identical to a gray axisymmetric soliton .",
    "in fact , the vortex ring transforms into a soliton at a speed somewhat smaller than @xmath109 .",
    "therefore , it is fair to say that the primary mode associated with the snake instability of a soliton is indeed the solitonic vortex @xcite whose calculation has been significantly extended in the present paper to account for steady motion along a cylindrical trap .",
    "actually , one may envisage a further generalization to a spinning solitonic vortex that undergoes rigid - body precession around the @xmath56 axis at constant frequency @xmath114 , while it moves along the same axis at constant velocity @xmath62 .",
    "one could then calculate the excitation energy @xmath115 , the impulse @xmath116 , and the azimuthal angular momentum @xmath117 to eventually derive a dispersion of the form @xmath118 .",
    "the lieb - type dispersion of a solitonic vortex shown by a solid line in figs .",
    "[ fig:6 ] and [ fig:7 ] would then be the lower edge of a continuum of states parametrized by the angular momentum @xmath119 .",
    "this interesting possibility will not be discussed further in the present paper .",
    "a phase imprint @xmath99 applied between the two ends of an elongated trap leads to the formation of pure quasi-1d solitons only for weak couplings ( densities ) in the region @xmath120 . for intermediate couplings in the region @xmath121 ,",
    "solitons may be produced temporarily but they eventually decay into stable solitonic vortices .",
    "a new pattern emerges for @xmath50 where a phase imprint should initially produce unstable axisymmetric solitons that subsequently deform radially to become axisymmetric vortex rings and finally decay into solitonic vortices .",
    "this pattern is further complicated by the fact that high - speed vortex rings or solitonic vortices are indistinguishable from axisymmetric solitons .",
    "it is thus important to reexamine the parameters of the experiment described in ref .",
    "according to the estimates obtained in appendix b , the length of the trap is significantly larger than its radius .",
    "hence the approximation by an infinite cylindrical trap may be reasonable .",
    "furthermore , a conservative estimate of the effective coupling leads to @xmath122 which lies in the region @xmath50 .",
    "therefore , all three types of solitary waves theoretically discussed in the present paper should have been produced in the original experiment of ref .",
    "also note that non - stationary vortex rings were actually detected in the experiment of ref .",
    "@xcite but on a spherical trap that is significantly different than the cylindrical trap considered here .",
    "nevertheless , our present analysis can be extended to the case of a finite trap , as discussed in appendix b.    finally , the calculation of the present paper clearly demonstrates that a lieb - type mode appears in the excitation spectrum for all densities , either in the form of a quasi-1d soliton ( for @xmath59 ) or in the form of a solitonic vortex ( for @xmath54 ) .",
