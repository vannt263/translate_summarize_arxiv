    "in this work we consider multiparty communication complexity in the _ number - in - hand _ model . in this model , there are @xmath0 players @xmath5 , each with his own @xmath1-bit input @xmath6 .",
    "the players wish to collaborate in order to compute a joint function of their inputs , @xmath7 .",
    "to do so , they are allowed to communicate , until one of them figures out the value of @xmath7 and returns it .",
    "all players are assumed to have unlimited computational power , so all we care about is the amount of communication used .",
    "there are three variants to this model , according to the mode of communication :    1 .   the _ blackboard model _ , where any message sent by a player is written on a blackboard visible to all players ; 2 .",
    "the _ message - passing model _ , where a player @xmath8 sending a message specifies another player @xmath9 that will receive this message ; 3 .   the _ coordinator model _ , where there is an additional @xmath10-th player called the _ coordinator _ , who receives no input .",
    "players can only communicate with the coordinator , and not with each other directly .",
    "we will work in all of these , but will mostly concentrate on the message - passing model and the coordinator model .",
    "note that the coordinator model is almost equivalent to the message - passing model , up to a @xmath11 multiplicative factor , since instead of player @xmath12 sending message @xmath13 to player @xmath14 , player @xmath12 can transmit message @xmath15 to the coordinator , and the coordinator forwards it to player @xmath14 .",
    "lower bounds in the three models above are useful for proving lower bounds on the space usage of streaming algorithms , and for other models as well , as we explain in section [ subsec : motivation ] .",
    "most previous lower bounds have been proved in the blackboard model , but lower bounds in the message - passing model and the coordinator model suffice for all the applications we have checked ( again , see more in section [ subsec : motivation ] ) .",
    "note that another , entirely different , model for multiparty communication is the _ number - on - forehead _ model , where each player can see the inputs of all other players but _ not _ his own input .",
    "this model has important applications for circuit complexity ( see e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "we do not discuss this model at all in this paper .",
    "we allow all protocols to be randomized , with public coins , i.e.  all players have unlimited access to a common infinite string of independent random bits .",
    "we allow the protocol to return the wrong answer with probability @xmath16 ( which should usually be thought of as a small constant ) ; here , the probability is taken over the sample space of public randomness .",
    "note that the public coin model might seem overly powerful , but in this paper we are mainly interested in proving lower bounds rather than upper bounds , so giving the model such strength only makes our results stronger .    for more on communication complexity ,",
    "see the book of kushilevitz and nisan  @xcite , and the references therein .",
    "we give some more definitions in the preliminaries , in section [ sec : pre ] .",
    "we begin by sketching two lower bounds obtained using our technique , both of them for the coordinate - wise xor problem .",
    "these lower bounds can be proved without using symmetrization , but their proofs that use symmetrization are particularly appealing .    first consider the following problem : each player gets a bitvector @xmath6 and the goal is to compute the coordinate - wise xor of these vectors .",
    "we operate in the _ blackboard model _ , where messages are posted on a blackboard for all to see .",
    "[ thm : xor_bb_intro ] the coordinate - wise xor problem requires communication @xmath2 in the blackboard model .    to see this , first let us specify the _ hard distribution _ : we prove the lower bound when the input is drawn from this distribution , and by the easy direction of yao s minimax lemma ( see e.g.  @xcite ) , it follows that this lower bound applies for the problem as a whole .",
    "the hard distribution we choose is just the distribution where the inputs are independently drawn from the uniform distribution .    to prove the lower bound , consider a protocol @xmath17 for this @xmath0-player problem , which works on this distribution , communicates @xmath18 bits in expectation , and suppose for now that it never makes any errors ( it will be easy to remove this assumption ) .",
    "we build from @xmath17 a new protocol @xmath19 for a @xmath20-player problem . in the @xmath20-player problem , suppose that alice gets input @xmath13 and bob gets input @xmath21 , where @xmath22 are independent random bitvectors",
    ". then @xmath19 works as follows : alice and bob randomly choose two distinct indices @xmath23 using the public randomness , and they simulate the protocol @xmath17 , where alice plays player @xmath12 and lets @xmath24 , bob plays player @xmath14 and lets @xmath25 , and they both play all of the rest of the players ; the inputs of the rest of the players is chosen from shared randomness .",
    "alice and bob begin simulating the running of @xmath17 .",
    "every time player @xmath12 should speak , alice sends to bob the message that player @xmath12 was supposed to write on the board , and vice versa . when any other player @xmath26 ( @xmath27 ) should speak , both alice and bob know his input so they know what he should be writing on the board , thus no communication is actually needed ( this is the key point of the symmetrization technique ) . a key observation",
    "is that the inputs of the @xmath0 players are uniform and independent and thus entirely symmetrical , over @xmath28 is called _ symmetric _ if exchanging any two coordinates in @xmath29 keeps the distribution the same . ] and since the indices @xmath12 and @xmath14 were chosen uniformly at random , then the expected communication performed by the protocol @xmath19 is @xmath30 = 2c(p)/k$ ] .",
    "furthermore , when the players have finished simulating @xmath19 , alice now knows the bit - wise xor of all the vectors @xmath31 , from which she can easily reconstruct the vector @xmath32 ( since she already knows all the other vectors @xmath33 for @xmath34 ) .",
    "it follows that using @xmath35 expected communication , alice has managed to reconstruct bob s entire input ; from an easy information - theoretic argument it follows that @xmath36 , so @xmath37 , proving the theorem .",
    "extending the above argument to cover the case where the protocol @xmath17 is allowed to return the wrong answer with probability @xmath16 is also easy , simply by showing that if alice managed to learn bob s entire bit - vector with probability @xmath38 , then @xmath39 bits must have been communicated : this also follows easily from information - theoretic arguments .",
    "note that crucial fact that the hard distribution we chose is symmetric : if the distribution of the inputs to the @xmath0 players was not symmetric , then the protocol @xmath17 could try to deduce the indices @xmath12 and @xmath14 from some statistical properties of the observed inputs , and act according to that . then the best upper bound we could get on the communication complexity of @xmath19 would be @xmath40 , which is much too weak .",
    "we have just described the version of the symmetrization method for the blackboard model .",
    "a similar ( slightly more complicated ) line of thinking leads to a lower bound of @xmath4 on the complexity of the coordinate - wise and problem in the blackboard model ; see section [ sec : and ] .",
    "let us now sketch the symmetrization method as it is used in the _ coordinator model _",
    ", where players can only send and receive messages to and from the coordinator .",
    "we prove a lower bound on the same problem as above , the coordinate - wise xor problem .",
    "the coordinate - wise xor problem requires communication @xmath2 in the coordinator model .",
    "note that this theorem actually follows from theorem [ thm : xor_bb_intro ] , since the blackboard model is stronger than the coordinator model .",
    "however , the proof we sketch here is useful as a warmup exercise , since it shows an easy example of the symmetrization technique as applied to the coordinator model . in the paper",
    "we prove multiple lower bounds using this technique , most of which do not follow from corresponding bounds in the blackboard model .",
    "to prove this theorem , we use the same hard distribution as above : all inputs are uniform and independent .",
    "let @xmath17 be a protocol in the coordinator model , which computes the coordinate - wise xor , uses communication @xmath18 and for now assume that @xmath17 never makes any errors . as before ,",
    "we build a new protocol @xmath19 for a 2-player problem . in the @xmath20-player problem ,",
    "suppose that alice gets input @xmath13 and bob gets input @xmath21 , where @xmath22 are independent random bitvectors .",
    "then @xmath19 works as follows : alice and bob choose a single index @xmath41 from public randomness .",
    "alice and bob simulate the protocol @xmath17 , where alice simulates player @xmath12 and lets @xmath24 , and bob plays _ all the rest of the players _ , including the coordinator , and chooses their inputs uniformly , conditioned on their xor being equal to @xmath21 .    to simulate the protocol @xmath17 , whenever player @xmath12 needs to send a message to the coordinator",
    ", then alice sends a message to bob , and whenever the coordinator needs to send a message to player @xmath12 , bob sends a message to alice . whenever any player @xmath42 needs to speak to the coordinator ,",
    "no communication is needed , since both are played by bob . note",
    "again that the distribution of the inputs of the @xmath0 players is independent uniform ( for this it is crucial to remember that @xmath13 and @xmath21 were uniform and independent in the first place ) .",
    "once again , from reasons of symmetry , since the index @xmath12 was chosen uniformly and the inputs are symmetric , the expected communication performed by the protocol @xmath19 is @xmath43 \\le 2c(p)/k$ ] .",
    "furthermore , at the end of the running of @xmath19 , alice knows the value of @xmath44 so she can reconstruct the value of @xmath21 . as before , this implies the theorem . the assumption that we never make errors",
    "can once again be easily removed .",
    "we see that the crux of the symmetrization technique in the coordinator model is to consider the @xmath0-player problem that we wish to lower - bound , to find a symmetric distribution which seems hard for it , to give alice the input of one player ( chosen at random ) and bob the input of all other players , and to prove a lower bounds for this two - player problem .",
    "if the lower bound for the two player problem is @xmath45 , the lower bound for the @xmath0-player problem will be @xmath46 . for the blackboard model ,",
    "the proofs have the same outline , except in the @xmath20-player problem alice gets the input of one randomly chosen player , bob gets the input of another , and they both get the inputs of all the rest of the players .",
    "there is one important thing to note here :    * this argument only works when the hard distribution is symmetric .",
    "communication complexity is a widely studied topic . in multiplayer communication complexity , the most studied mode of communication is the blackboard model .",
    "the message - passing model was already considered in @xcite .",
    "( this model can also be called the _ private - message model _ , but note that this name was used in @xcite for a different model . )",
    "the coordinator model can be thought of as a server - site setting  , where there is one server and @xmath0 sites .",
    "each site has gathered @xmath1 bits of information and the server wants to evaluate a function on the collection of these @xmath47 bits .",
    "each site can only communicate with the server , and a server can communicate with any site .",
    "this server - site model has been widely studied in the databases and distributed computing communities .",
    "work includes computing top-@xmath0 @xcite and heavy hitters @xcite .",
    "another closely related model is the _ distributed streaming model _ , in which we also have one server and @xmath0 sites .",
    "the only difference is that now the computation is dynamic .",
    "that is , each site receives a stream of elements over time and the server would like to maintain continuously at all times some function @xmath48 of all the elements in the @xmath0 sites .",
    "thus the server - site model can be seen as a one - shot version of the distributed streaming setting .",
    "it follows that any communication complexity lower bound in the message - passing model or the coordinator model also hold in the distributed streaming model .",
    "a lot of work on distributed streaming has been done recently in the theory community and the database community , including maintaining random samplings @xcite , frequency moments @xcite , heavy hitters @xcite , quantiles @xcite , entropy @xcite , various sketches @xcite and some non - linear functions @xcite .",
    "we will come back to the latter two models in section [ sec : application ] .",
    "it is interesting to note that despite the large number of upper bounds ( i.e.  algorithms , communication protocols ) in the above models , very few lower bounds have been proved in any of those models , likely because there were few known techniques to prove such results .    a further application of the message - passing model could be for secure multiparty computation : in this model , there are several players who do not trust each other , but want to compute a joint function of their inputs , with each of them learning nothing about the inputs of the others players except what can be learned from the value of the joint function .",
    "obviously , any lower bound in the message passing model immediately implies a lower bound on the amount of communication required for secure multiparty computation . for more on this model ,",
    "see e.g. @xcite .",
    "one final application is for the streaming model . in this model",
    ", there is a long stream of data that can only be scanned from left to right .",
    "the goal is to compute some function of the stream , and minimize the space usage .",
    "it is easy to see that if we partition the stream into @xmath0 parts and give each part to a different player , then a lower bound of @xmath45 on the communication complexity of the problem in the coordinator model implies a lower bound of @xmath49 on the space usage .",
    "when @xmath50 passes over the model are allowed , a lower bound of @xmath45 in the coordinator model translates to a lower bound of @xmath51 in the streaming model .",
    "our main technical result in this paper are lower bounds of @xmath2 randomized communication for the bitwise @xmath0-party and , or , and maj ( majority ) functions in the coordinator model .",
    "this can be found in section [ sec : bitwise ] . in the same section",
    "we prove some lower bounds for and and or in the blackboard model as well . back to the coordinator model , we show that the connectivity problem ( given @xmath0 players with subgraphs on a common set of nodes , determine if it is connected ) requires @xmath52 communication .",
    "this is in section  [ sec : conn ] .",
    "the coordinate - wise lower bounds imply lower bounds for the well - studied problems of heavy - hitters and @xmath16-kernels in the server - site model ( or the other related models ) .",

    "this has the effect of having each bit in the output vector be roughly balanced , which seems suitable for being a hard case .",
    "this is indeed the hard distribution for the blackboard model , but for the coordinator model ( or the message - passing model ) it is an easy distribution : each player can send his entire input to the coordinator , and the coordinator can figure out the answer .",
    "the entropy of each player s input is only @xmath94 , so the total communication would be @xmath95 in expectation using e.g.  shannon s coding theorem ; this is much smaller than the lower bound we wish to prove .",
    "clearly , we must choose a distribution where each player s input has entropy @xmath96 .",
    "this is the first indication that the @xmath0-player problem is significantly different than the @xmath20-player problem , where the above distribution is indeed the hard distribution .",
    "the next candidate hard distribution is to randomly partition the @xmath1 coordinates into two equal - sized sets : the _ important set _ , where each entry is equal to @xmath66 with probability @xmath93 , and the _ balancing set _ , where all entries are equal to @xmath66 .",
    "now the entropy of each player s input is @xmath97 , and the distribution seems like a good candidate , but there is a surprising upper bound for this distribution : the coordinator asks @xmath98 players to send him their entire input , and from this can easily figure out which coordinates are in the balancing set and which are in the important set .",
    "henceforth , the coordinator knows this information , and only needs to learn the players values in the important set , which again have low entropy .",
    "we would want the players to send these values , but the players themselves do not know which coordinates are in the important set , and the coordinator would need to send @xmath99 bits to tell all of them this information .",
    "however , they do not need to know this in order to get all the information across : using a protocol known as _ slepian - wolf coding _",
    "( see e.g.  @xcite ) the players can transmit to the coordinator all of their values in the important coordinates , with only @xmath100 total communication ( and a small probability of error ) .",
    "the idea is roughly as follows : each player @xmath8 chooses @xmath101 sets @xmath102 $ ] independently and uniformly at random from public randomness .",
    "for each @xmath14 , the player xors the bits of his input in the coordinates of @xmath103 , and sends the value of this xor to the coordinator .",
    "the coordinator already knows the balancing set , so he only has @xmath94 bits of uncertainty about player @xmath12 s input , meaning he can reconstruct the player s input with high probability ( say by exhaustive search ) .",
    "the upper bound follows .    to get an actual hard distribution , we fix the hard distribution from the last paragraph .",

    "in this paper we have introduced the symmetrization technique , and have shown how to use it to prove lower bounds for @xmath0-player communication games .",
    "this technique seems widely applicable , and we expect future work to find further uses .",
    "the symmetrization technique has several limitations , which we wish to discuss here .",
    "firstly , there are problems that might be impossible to lower bound using symmetrization .",
    "consider for example the @xmath0-player disjointness problem , where each player gets a subset of @xmath395 , and the goal is to decide whether there is an element that appears in all of the sets .",
    "this problem is easier than the coordinate - wise and problem .",
    "we believe that this problem has a communication lower bound of @xmath2 in the coordinator model",
    ". however , it seems impossible to prove this lower bound using symmetrization , for the following reason .",
    "suppose we give alice the input of a randomly - chosen player @xmath8 , and give bob the inputs of all the other players .",
    "it seems that for any symmetric input distribution , this problem can be solved using @xmath396 bits in expectation , which is much lower than the @xmath96 lower bound we are aiming for .",
    "it is not out of the question that some variant of the symmetrization technique can be used to get the @xmath2 lower bound , but we do not know how to do it , and it might well be impossible .",
    "we leave this problem as an intriguing open question .",
    "the second limitation is that symmetrization seems to require proving distributional lower bounds for @xmath20-player problems , often over somewhat - convoluted distributions .",
    "this presents some difficulty for the researcher , who needs to start proving lower bounds from scratch and can not use the literature , since lower bounds in the literature are proved for other distributions .",
    "yao s minimax principle can not be used , since it only guarantees that there is _ some _ hard distribution , but it does nt guarantee anything for the distribution of interest .",
    "this is often only a methodical difficulty , since it is often easy to get convinced that the distribution of interest is indeed hard , but a proof of this must still be found , which is a tedious task",
    ". it would be useful if these was some way to circumvent this difficulty , for example by finding a way that standard randomized lower bounds can be used .",
    "the third limitation is that in order to use symmetrization , one needs to find a hard distribution for the @xmath0-player problem which is symmetric .",
    "this is usually impossible when the problem itself is not symmetric , i.e.  when the players have different roles .",
    "for example , one could envision a problem where some of the players get as input elements of some group and the rest of the players get as input integers .",
    "however , note that for such problems , symmetrization can still be useful in a somewhat - generalized version .",
    "for example , suppose there are two sets of players : in set @xmath17 , the players get group elements , and in set @xmath19 , the players get integers .",
    "assume each of the sets contains exactly @xmath397 players .",
    "to use symmetrization , we would try to find a hard distribution that is symmetric inside of @xmath17 and also inside of @xmath19 ; namely , a distribution where permuting the players inside @xmath17 has no effect on the distribution , and similarly for permuting the players inside @xmath19 .",
    "then , to use symmetrization we can have alice simulate two random players , @xmath8 and @xmath9 , where @xmath8 is from @xmath17 and @xmath9 is from @xmath19 ; bob will simulate all the rest of the players .",
    "now symmetrization can be applied .",
    "if , alternatively , the set @xmath17 contained just @xmath398 players and @xmath19 contained @xmath399 players , we can have alice simulate one of the players in @xmath19 , bob can simulate the rest of the players in @xmath19 , and either alice or bob can play the three players from @xmath17 . as can be seen , with a suitable choice of distribution , it should still be possible to apply symmetrization to problems that exhibit some amount of symmetry .    the main topic for future",
    "work seems to be to find more setting and problems where symmetrization can prove useful . since discovering this approach we have found repeatedly that problems that we encounter in other settings seem susceptible to this approach , and we think it has the potential to be a widely useful tool .",
    "the problems we deal with in this paper are simple and natural , possibly the simplest problems one could ask in the multiplayer communication model .",
    "we have not found results about them in the literature , but it makes sense to ask if the lower bounds we prove have trivial proofs : maybe the symmetrization framework that we introduce is not needed , and some of these results can be proved trivially ? the analogues of these results in the @xmath20-player case are indeed trivial to prove , so why should the @xmath0-player case be any different ?    as with any mathematical result , it is difficult to show that our results do not have trivial proofs hiding somewhere .",
    "one argument is that we have tried hard to find such proofs , and failed .",
    "a good way to get convinced that the @xmath0-player setting is significantly different than the @xmath20-player setting is to attempt to argue about @xmath0-player protocols .",
    "these protocols have much more freedom than @xmath20-player protocols , and it is harder to argue about what they can not do .",
    "perhaps the best evidence that at least some of our results are non - trivial can be found in section [ sec : and : idea ] . in this section",
    "we discussed the coordinate - wise and problem in the coordinator model , and have shown that some natural candidates for hard distributions are not hard at all , and that proving a lower bound for the problem seems to require ruling out a certain slepian - wolf - related type of protocols ( see more details there ) .",
    "this gives some indication that a lower bound for this problem should be at least somewhat non - trivial .",
    "symmetrization is a technique that can be applied to a wide range of @xmath0-player communication problems , as well as having many possible applications in related models .",
    "any problem which has a symmetric hard - looking distribution is a good candidate .",

    "this list is far from exhaustive .",

    "* _ equality : _ each player gets a vector of length @xmath1 , and the goal is to decide whether all players have received the same vector .",

    "* _ pointer chasing : _ each player has a set of directed edges in an @xmath1-vertex graph , where for each vertex @xmath406 , only one player has an edge whose source is @xmath406 .",

    "if @xmath245 is connected with probability @xmath247 , then by union bound over @xmath248 and @xmath233 , @xmath240 is true with probability @xmath249 .",
    "the proof follows four steps .    1 .   _",
    "all points have degree at least @xmath250 .",
    "_ since for each of @xmath0 rounds each point s degree increases by @xmath66 with probability @xmath105 , then the expected degree of each point is @xmath474 after the first @xmath252 rounds .",
    "a chernoff - hoeffding bound says that the probability that a point has degree less than @xmath250 is at most @xmath475 .",

    ". thus we can apply a chernoff - hoeffding bound to say the probability that the number of edges outside of @xmath70 for any point is less than @xmath478 is at most @xmath479 .",
    "thus the probability that no point in @xmath70 has fewer than @xmath258 edges outside @xmath70 is ( since @xmath254 ) at most @xmath480 .",
    "+ if the @xmath481 edges outside of @xmath70 ( for all @xmath404 points ) are drawn independently at random , then we need to bound the probability that these go to more than @xmath201 distinct points or @xmath482 distinct points . since",
    "the edges are drawn to favor going to distinct points in each round , it is sufficient to analyze the case where all of the edges are independent , which can only increase the chance they collide . in either case @xmath483 or @xmath484 each time an edge is chosen ( until @xmath201 vertices have been reached , in which case we can stop ) ,",

    "start with any single point , we know from step 1 , its degree is at least @xmath491 .",
    "then we can consider the set @xmath70 formed by these @xmath492 points , and apply step 2 to find another @xmath493 points ; add these points to @xmath70 .",
    "the process iterates and at each round @xmath494 , by growing only from @xmath495 the newly added points .",
    "so , by round @xmath496 the set @xmath497 has grown to at least size @xmath201 .",
    "taking the union bound over these @xmath258 rounds shows that this process fails with probability at most @xmath498 .",
