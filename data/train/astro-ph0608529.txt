    "their x - ray luminosities ( @xmath11  erg / s ) greatly exceed the rates of rotational energy loss ( @xmath12  erg / s ) .",
    "it is now generally believed that axps are magnetars with magnetic field strengths greater than @xmath13  g and that their x - ray luminosity is powered by magnetic energy ( woods & thompson 2006 ) . as an alternative explanation",
    "the x - ray emission was attributed to accretion from a disk that is made up of supernova - fallback material ( van paradijs etal .",
    "1995 , chatterjee etal .  2000 , alpar 2001 ) .",
    "the fallback - disk model has difficulties to explain ir / optical emission properties of axps .",
    "when compared with disk models , the faint ir / optical flux suggests that any disk around axps must be very compact ( e.g.  perna etal .  2000 , israel etal .",
    "2004 ) .    the discovery of optical pulsations in 4u0142 + 61 which have the same period like the x - ray pulsations ( kern & martin 2002 ) appears to be a strong argument against the disk model .",
    "it was argued that reprocessing of the pulsed ns x - ray emission in the disk can not explain the high optical pulsed fraction , because disk radiation would be dominated by viscous dissipation and not by reprocessed ns irradiation ( kern & martin 2002 ) .",
    "ertan & cheng ( 2004 ) , on the other hand , showed that these optical pulsations can be explained either by the magnetar outer gap model or by the disk - star dynamo model .",
    "therefore , the observation of optical pulsations is not an argument against the disk model .",
    "a spectral break in the optical spectrum of 4u0142 + 61 was discovered by hulleman etal .",
    "this was also taken as an argument against the disk model because the authors do not expect such strong features from a thermally emitting disk .",
    "the recent discovery of mid - ir emission from this axp ( wang etal .",
    "2006 ) , however , has strongly rekindled the interest in studies of fallback - disk emission properties .",
    "while this mid - ir emission was attributed to a cool , passive ( x - ray irradiated ) dust debris disk by wang etal .",
    "( 2006 ) , it was shown by ertan on this conference that it can be explained with a model for an active , dissipating gas disk .",
    "if true , then the disk emission properties allow to conclude on important quantities , e.g. , the magnetic field strength of the neutron star can be derived from the inner disk radius .",
    "independent hints for the possible existence of fallback disks come from pulsars with particular spin - down properties .",
    "for example , the discrepancy between the characteristic age and the supernova age of the pulsar b1757 - 24 was explained by the combined action of magnetic dipole radiation and accretion torques ( marsden etal .",
    "even more , the presence of jets from pulsars such like the crab and vela can possibly be explained by disk - wind outflow interacting with and collimating the pulsar wind ( blackman & perna 2004 ) .    a fallback - disk model was proposed in order to explain the x - ray enhancement following a giant flare of the soft gamma repeater sgr1900 + 14 ( ertan & alpar 2003 ) . the x - ray light curve is interpreted in terms of the relaxation of a fallback disk that has been pushed back by the gamma - ray flare .",
    "this model can also explain the long - term x - ray and ir enhancement light curves of the axp 1e2259 + 58 following a major bursting epoch ( ertan etal .",
    "2006 ) .",
    "the presence of a fallback disk around the stellar remnant of sn  1987a has been invoked in order to explain its observed lightcurve which deviates from the theoretical one for pure radioactive decay ( meyer - hofmeister 1992 ) . from the non - detection of any uv / optical point source in the supernova remnant ,",

    "<S> we present a first detailed spectrum synthesis calculation of a supernova - fallback disk composed of iron . </S>",
    "<S> we assume a geometrically thin disk with a radial structure described by the classical @xmath0-disk model . </S>",
    "<S> the disk is represented by concentric rings radiating as plane - parallel slabs . </S>",
    "<S> the vertical structure and emission spectrum of each ring is computed in a fully self - consistent manner by solving the structure equations simultaneously with the radiation transfer equations under non - lte conditions . </S>",
    "<S> we describe the properties of a specific disk model and discuss various effects on the emergent uv / optical spectrum .    </S>",
    "<S> we find that strong iron - line blanketing causes broad absorption features over the whole spectral range . </S>",
    "<S> limb darkening changes the spectral distribution up to a factor of four depending on the inclination angle . </S>",
    "<S> consequently , such differences also occur between a blackbody spectrum and our model . </S>",
    "<S> the overall spectral shape is independent of the exact chemical composition as long as iron is the dominant species . </S>",
    "<S> a pure iron composition can not be distinguished from silicon - burning ash . </S>",
    "<S> non - lte effects are small and restricted to few spectral features .    </S>",
