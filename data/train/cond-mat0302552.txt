    "columnar bd was introduced as a bond ordered state in 2d heisenberg models with frustrated interactions @xcite .",
    "the canonical example is the model with antiferromagnetic nearest - neighbor and next - nearest - neighbor interactions ( @xmath2 and @xmath10 respectively ) .",
    "the core physics can be generalized to the inclusion of further neighbor interactions .",
    "the bond ordered state is proposed to correspond to the spin gaped state which occurs when @xmath11 @xcite .",
    "the columnar bd order renders the system to be equivalent to an effective coupled 2-leg spin ladder system ( see fig.2 ) .",
    "it is supposed that at moderate doping the bd and spin gap are retained @xcite which entails the confinement of spin-@xmath0 excitations ( i.e. , pairing ) .",
    "the spin gap is the prominent energy scale which characterizes the bd . in the spirit of the rvb",
    "doped spin liquid idea@xcite , pairing is inherited from the spin liquid state of the undoped bd heisenberg model .",
    "an analogy is drawn with the case of dimerization in one dimensional spin chains , where the spin gap can be as large as @xmath2 ( the majumdar - ghosh limit ) .",
    "a - priori , it might be that columnar bd can lead to a spin gap on the scale of weakly coupled 2-leg ladders @xcite .",
    "[ ptb ]    bfig-columnardimerization.eps    since the undoped cuperates have a quasi long range antiferromagnetic ground state @xcite , the applicability of a bd model to the cuperates is not straight foreword .",
    "the mechanism implied by the phase diagram ( fig.1)@xcite is the following .",
    "the microscopic degrees of freedom and interactions in the cuperate superconductors are capture by a one band generalized t - j model ( e.g. , t  t-j - j-j  ) plus coulomb interactions .",
    "the _ bare parameters _ values are such that groundstate of the undoped system is the neel state as described by chakravarty _",
    "_ @xcite . with the introduction of holes ,",
    "the holes dynamics enhances the effective longer range antiferromagnetic interactions ( i.e. , imagine integrating out high energy hole hopping processes to arrive at an effective lower energy hamiltonian ) . thus , at intermediate energy scales , it is conjectured that the _ effective spin interactions model parameters _ are in the fixed point regime of the bond dimerized heisenberg model .",
    "the low energy holes dynamics is self consistently centered on the strong bonds ( which in columnar bd form seem very much like 2-leg ladders ) .",
    "the addition of coulomb interaction has the effect of changing the spacing of the hole rich columns compared with the model without such coulomb interaction @xcite .",
    "hence , a stripe like structure of alternating hole rich lines and hole poor domains can be formed ( see insets in fig.1 ) .",
    "we comment that the bd as envisaged in @xcite is a property not only of the hole rich stripe but also of the hole poor environment between stripes .",
    "thus , the spin gap in the hole rich stripe domain is tightly linked with properties of the hole poor domain between stripes .",
    "prior to discussing direct tests of the spontaneous bd mechanism , one may ask what are its most idealized prospects to begin with ? numerical simulations results of for the spin gap on a square @xmath12 heisenberg model are shown in fig-3 @xcite .",
    "a spin gap is expected only in the range of parameters @xmath13 .",
    "it appears that , unlike the one dimensional spin chain case where the spin gap can be as big as @xmath14 ( the majumdar - ghosh limit ) , the effective _ maximal _ dimerization in a 2d @xmath12 heisenberg model on a square lattice is never giving rise to a gap value bigger than @xmath15 . while it may be that by fine tuning some additional further interactions ( @xmath16 etc ... ) one might conjure higher gap values , that would not constitute a robust model . since the square @xmath12 heisenberg model is the effective model system which is at the origin of the bd mechanism proposed by sachdev , the results presented in fig.3 already put in serious doubt the basic conjecture which underlies the introduction of spontaneous bd as responsible for phenomena at energy scale @xmath17 in the cuperate high temperature superconductors .",
    "even leg ladders are an ideal testing ground for t - j model physics .",
    "numerical simulations of doped t - j model ladders @xcite show groundstate pairing correlations in agreement with effective columnar bd ( see fig.4 ) .",
    "therefore , ladders seem to be a favorable system for bd .",
    "it is worth noting that the appearance of columnar pairing correlations in ladders may also be a simple consequence of geometrical anisotropy and boundary conditions . yet",
    ", such knowledge is not essential to our arguments in this paper .",
    "we argue that _ the key issue is the size of the spin gap_.        numerical simulations by core method on doped 4-leg ladders already seem to indicate that the spin gap of the doped ladder does not get bigger than that of the undoped ladder ( see fig.5 ) .",
    "but there is an ambiguity between open and periodic boundary conditions .",
    "apparently , the spin gap of 4-leg ladders ( @xmath18 ) is to begin with too large to draw sharp conclusions from . on the other hand , as we elaborate below , similar calculations for 6-leg ladders are all that is needed to make the point .",
    "undoped 6-leg t - j ladder models have a small spin gap @xmath19 . upon doping",
    ", the ground state still has a spin gap and enhanced pairing correlations .",
    "we propose to examine a 6-leg ladder model with the same bare t - j - j model parameters as are assumed for the c - o planes of the cuperate superconductors ( e.g. , bare ring exchange interaction may need to be included @xcite ) .",
    "the generation of effective interactions due to the holes dynamics is a local process which qualitatively and quantitatively we expect to be the same in wide ladders ( e.g. , 6-leg or 8-leg ladders ) an in a 2d plane .",
    "consequently , what ever is the potential for bd in the 2d c - o plane , it should manifest itself with the same strength already in wide ladder models .",
    "the spin gap in undoped and doped 6-leg @xmath20 ladders can be deduced from the energy gap to the first @xmath21 spin excitation .",
    "examples of such a calculation were done for a 2-leg and 4-leg ladders by both dmrg and core methods @xcite . for spontaneous bd to be a mechanism relevant at energy scales of order @xmath22 , it is required that the size of the spin gap for the doped system will be on the order of @xmath23 , i.e. , 4 times bigger than that of the undoped 6-leg ladder ! !    in summary , bond dimerization ( bd )",
    "is seen to occur , to some extent , in doped even - leg ladders .",
    "thus , aspects of the resulting physics can be directly studied by numerical investigations of such ladders . specifically , we have proposed testing whether the energy scales involved are sufficiently large to be relevant to a host of properties of the cuperates ( such as pairing and stripes ) .",
    "the experimental phenomenology is sufficiently complicated that detailed quantitative comparisons are certainly premature , but we believe there is a significant theoretical distinction between the _ maximum _ spin - gap energy scales @xmath24 found in bd magnets@xcite , and the _ minimum necessary _ magnitudes @xmath25 . more directly ,",
    "if the bd mechanism fails to produce a high spin gap energy scale in doped 6-leg and 8-leg ladder systems ( as is our prediction ) then its prospects as the root cause of pairing , stripe formation , or normal state properties in the cuperate superconductors are in serious doubt .",
    "of course , we can not rule out the possibility that additional well adjusted interactions , such as the electron - phonon interaction , could increase the stability of the bd state and hence manage to overcome this objection . yet",
