    "the purpose of the present paper is to investigate the existence and stability of cosmological power - law scaling solutions derived from theories of the type ( [ mgbact ] ) in the presence of a perfect fluid matter source .",
    "scaling ( attractor ) solutions play an important role in cosmology , since they enable the asymptotic behaviour and stability of a particular cosmological background to be determined .",
    "moreover , they provide a framework for establishing the behaviour of more general cosmological solutions @xcite .",
    "the structure of the paper is as follows .",
    "we begin in section 2 by summarizing the derivation of the cosmological field equations by employing an equivalence between the action ( [ mgbact ] ) and a corresponding action involving a self - interacting scalar field that is non - minimally coupled to gravity .",
    "we focus on the spatially flat and isotropic friedmann - lemaitre - robertson - walker ( flrw ) universe and proceed in section 3 to identify the most general form for the function @xmath5 that results in power - law ( scaling ) solutions when the matter source is a barotropic fluid with a constant equation of state parameter . specifically , we find that scaling solutions may arise when @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is an arbitrary constant .",
    "we then show that for this form of the action , the field equations can be expressed as a plane autonomous system .",
    "this allows us to employ dynamical systems theory to investigate the stability of the vacuum and non - vacuum solutions and this is done in sections 4 and 5 , respectively .",
    "we find that scaling solutions , corresponding either to a stable node or a stable spiral node , can arise when the equation of state of the fluid and the parameter , @xmath7 , satisfy appropriate conditions .",

    "<S> the conditions for the existence and stability of cosmological power - law scaling solutions are established when the einstein - hilbert action is modified by the inclusion of a function of the gauss - bonnet curvature invariant . </S>",
    "<S> the general form of the action that leads to such solutions is determined for the case where the universe is sourced by a barotropic perfect fluid . </S>",
    "<S> it is shown by employing an equivalence between the gauss - bonnet action and a scalar - tensor theory of gravity that the cosmological field equations can be written as a plane autonomous system . </S>",
    "<S> it is found that stable scaling solutions exist when the parameters of the model take appropriate values . </S>"
