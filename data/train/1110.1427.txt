    "one of the problems in a nonperturbative qcd is the determination of condensates .",
    "it is well known that the condensates can only be determined in a nonperturbative formulation of the qcd .",

    "glueball is ( thought to be ) bound state of gluons .",
    "the nonlinear properties of gluons create the possibility of a color - neutral state made of gluons only : glueballs .",

    "@xcite the distribution of a gluon condensate in a flux tube stretched between quark and antiquark is calculated using approximate nonperturbative quantization technique .",
    "it is shown that a longitudinal chromoelectric field is confined with a surrounding coset chromomagnetic field .",
    "such picture presents the concrete realization of dual qcd model in a scalar model of the flux tube . in the scalar model the su(3 )",
    "gauge fields are separated on two parts : ( 1 ) is the @xmath0 subgroup , ( 2 ) is the coset @xmath1 .",
    "the su(2 ) degrees of freedom are almost classical and the coset degrees of freedom are quantum ones . a nonperturbative approach for the quantization of the coset degrees of freedom is applied . in this approach 2-point",
    "green s functions are a bilinear combination of scalar fields and 4-point green s functions are the product of 2-points green s functions .",
    "the gluon condensate is an effective lagrangian describing the su(2 ) gauge field with broken gauge symmetry and coupling with the scalar field .",

    "only one difference is that coset degrees of freedom are quantized as well . in this notice",
    "we would like to obtain the distribution of gluon condensate for the glueball using results from ref .",
    "@xcite and compare obtained results with the results of ref .",
    "following to @xcite we separate su(3 ) degrees of freedom on two parts : the first is the @xmath0 subgroup , the second is the coset @xmath1 .",
    "we average su(3 ) lagrangian using some assumptions and approximations . the main idea in this approximation",
    "is that 2 and 4-points green s functions can be approximately described by two scalar fields @xmath2 : @xmath3 where @xmath4 are su(2 ) indexes , @xmath5 are coset indexes and @xmath6 and @xmath7 are some constants . instead of @xmath8 and @xmath9 instead of @xmath10 .",

    "we use here @xmath14 metric signature .",
    "it is necessary to emphasize :    the physical significance of this approach is following :    * the scalar fields @xmath2 describe nonperturbative quantized @xmath15 and coset @xmath1 degrees of freedom correspondingly . *",

    "the glueball is not a cloud of gluon - quanta but this object is more similar to a turbulent liquid with fluctuating velocities and consequently fluctuating lines of fluid flow . in this connection",
    "one can say that an object presented in the painting `` castagna '' of famous surrealist p. tchelitchew ( see fig .",
    "[ tchelitchew ] ) is a schematical presentation of the glueball with fluctuating force lines of chromoelectric fields .",
    "this result can be compared with the results of ref .",
    "@xcite : the difference is that in the glueball does not exist a core with predominant chromoelectric field in contrast with the flux tube where there does exist a core filled with a longitudinal chromoelectic field stretched between quark and antiquark and confined with a fluctuating chromomagnetic field . in our opinion",
    "the reason for this is that in the core of the flux tube ( considered in ref .",
    "@xcite ) there exists almost classical chromoelectric field . whereas in the glueball we have fluctuating chromofields with zero expectation values only .",
