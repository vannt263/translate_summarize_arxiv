    "one is the system with strong spin - orbit coupling @xcite and the other is the integer quantum hall ( iqh ) system @xcite . especially , iqh transition has attracted much interest , because , as shown by pruisken _",
    "et al._@xcite , what is responsible for the delocalization is a topological term in the usual nonlinear sigma model ( nlsm ) description . though his arguments clarified nonperturbative aspects of the delocalization phenomena in the iqh systems , it was not generally possible to calculate critical properties of the iqh transitions . in order to calculate them explicitly , a model of dirac fermions with various types of disorder",
    "was studied extensively@xcite .",
    "this model has also intimate relationship with a statistical model @xcite and with more physical systems such as @xmath3-@xmath4 model @xcite or @xmath5-wave superconductor@xcite .",
    "however , many problems remain to be explored , since generic iqh transition is in the strong - coupling limit@xcite , though some exact results can be obtained for models with rather limited realization of disorder , e.g. the model only with random vector potentials@xcite .    on the other hand",
    ", gade found a new universality class having a random critical point@xcite .",
    "it is due to what is called particle - hole symmetry , which enlarges the symmetry of the universality class to the general linear group .",
    "the renormalization group equations were calculated for the nlsm specifying such universality class with @xcite or without @xcite time - reversal symmetry .",
    "recently , it was recognized that the random flux model belongs to this universality class@xcite or to its supersymmetric version@xcite .",
    "recently , hatsugai _ et al . _",
    "( hwkm)@xcite proposed an interesting 2d model with the particle - hole symmetry .",
    "this model describes _",
    "random hopping _",
    "fermions on the square - lattice with @xmath1-flux .",
    "it should have close relationship with various kinds of systems mentioned above , since it is described by the dirac fermions near the band center .",
    "numerical calculations by hwkm strongly suggest a random critical point at the band center .",
    "this model is actually in sharp contrast to the similar model but with on - site disorder@xcite which has only localized states .",
    "especially , what is interesting is the power - law behavior of the density of state ( dos ) such as @xmath6 with @xmath7 dependent on the strength of the disorder .",
    "their calculations show that the exponent @xmath7 keeps positive even for rather large randomness .",
    "this behavior of the dos seems to be in contrast to the pioneering work on the two - sublattice model by oppermann and wegner@xcite , where the two - particle green function has singularity at the band center . even in one dimension ,",
    "this symmetry plays a role in the existence of the critical point@xcite , which brings about a singularity of the dos at the band center .",
    "therefore , it is interesting to study the 2d model proposed by hwkm , especially paying attention to the behavior of dos .    in this paper",
    ", we study the 2d random hopping model with @xmath0-species .",
    "the model with one species corresponds to the hwkm model . in order to take @xmath1-flux into account effectively",
    ", we firstly derive the dirac hamiltonian and next apply the nlsm method developed by gade@xcite .",
    "we show that the model can be described by the nlsm on the symmetric space gl(@xmath2,r)/o(@xmath2 ) , which is just the class _ bd_i by zirnbauer@xcite .",
    "we conclude that the band center is a random critical point .",
    "however , contrary to the class with broken time - reversal symmetry , the present model should have , at least , two fixed point , which are characterized by the scaling property of the dos .",
    "it is shown that large @xmath0 systems are in the weak - coupling fixed point , where the dos diverges .",
    "a discontinuity is , therefore , expected at zero disorder .",

    "the scaling equation ( [ scaeq ] ) then tells us that @xmath204 scales to 0 .",
    "therefore , large @xmath0 systems behave similar to the class with broken time reversal symmetry@xcite .",
    "namely , since the @xmath202 function is given by @xcite @xmath212 the dos at the zero energy diverges under the change of the length scale ; @xmath213 on the one hand , this may be likely , since oppermann and wegner already derived a singular behavior of the green function of the two - sublattice model such as @xmath214 , using the large @xmath0 expansion .",
    "on the other hand , the present divergence of the dos suggests a discontinuity with respect to @xmath146 at @xmath215 , since dos is exactly zero at the band center when @xmath215 .",
    "however , the numerical calculation for the @xmath8 system by hwkm suggests the convergence of the dos even for rather large @xmath146 .",
    "therefore , small @xmath0 systems , at least @xmath8 system , should belong to a different fixed point .",

    "the initial value of the present calculation is @xmath224 for @xmath8 , which is still in the weak - coupling regime , to be sure , but lies quite near to the zero of the beta function .    of course , precise studies of this strong - coupling regime are beyond our scope , since we are based on the perturbations : the initial values @xmath225 in eq .",
    "( [ resini ] ) is valid only for large @xmath0 cases .",
    "the zero of the beta function depends , moreover , on the order of the loop expansion .",
    "namely , @xmath226 is computed as @xmath227 and 3.087 for two- and four - loop order , respectively , but no @xmath226 for one- and three - loop order .",
    "however , numerical calculations by hwkm for the @xmath8 system suggests the convergence of the dos , which tells that such model can not be in the weak - coupling fixed point .",
    "therefore , we conjecture the existence of a critical @xmath0 which separate the strong- and the weak - coupling phases .",
    "it is quite interesting to observe the weak - coupling one which is suggested in this paper for the first time , and to determine the phase diagram more precisely in the @xmath146-@xmath0 plane by nonperturbative methods or by numerical calculations .",
    "we have investigated the 2d random hopping fermion model proposed by hwkm , using field theoretical treatments developed by gade .",
    "starting from the tight - binding hamiltonian , we have firstly derived the continuum dirac hamiltonian which effectively describes the band center of the lattice model , and next constructed the generating functional of the green functions averaged - over the disorder .",
    "it has been shown that the symmetry group is gl(@xmath2,r ) , which is spontaneously broken to o(@xmath2 ) . integrating out the massive modes , we have derived a nonlinear sigma model on the symmetric space gl(@xmath2,r)/o(@xmath2 ) , describing the goldstone mode .",
    "the beta functions of the renormalization group show that the band center is a random critical point , where the density of state diverges for large @xmath0 systems .",
    "this corresponds to a weak - coupling fixed point , which may share basic properties with the two sublattice model studied by oppermann and wegner .",
    "however , due to a nontrivial zero of the beta function , it is likely that the small @xmath0 system is in the strong - coupling limit .",
    "this fixed point is still critical but presumably with convergent density of state .",
    "this fixed point may occur at a large value of the coupling constant , so that it is beyond our perturbative theory .",
