    "chondrules are millimeter - sized , once - molten , spherical - shaped grains mainly composed of silicate material .",
    "they are considered to have formed from chondrule precursor dust particles about @xmath1 ago in the solar nebula ; they were heated and melted through flash heating events in the solar nebula and cooled again to solidify in a short period of time ( e.g. , jones _",
    "et al_. 2000 and references therein ) .",
    "so they must have great information on the early history of our solar system .",
    "since it is naturally expected that protoplanetary disks around young stars in star forming regions have similar dust particles and processes , the study of chondrule formation may provide us much information on the planetary system formation .",
    "chondrules have many features : physical properties ( sizes , shapes , densities , degree of magnetization , etc . ) , chemical properties ( elemental abundances , degree of oxidation / reduction , etc . ) , isotopic compositions ( oxygen , nitrogen , rare gases , etc . ) , mineralogical and petrologic features ( structures , crystals , degrees of alteration , relicts , etc . ) , and so forth , each of which should be a clue that helps us to reveal their own formation process and that of the planetary system .",
    "shock - wave heating model for chondrule formation has been studied by many authors ( hood & horanyi 1991 , 1993 , ruzmaikina & ip 1994 , tanaka _ et al .",
    "_ 1998 , iida _ et al_. 2001 ( hereafter insn ) , desch & connolly 2002 ( hereafter dc02 ) , miura _",
    "et al_. 2002 , ciesla & hood 2002 ( hereafter ch02 ) , miura & nakamoto 2005 ( hereafter mn05 ) ) , and is considered to be one of the plausible mechanisms for chondrule formation ( boss 1996 , jones _",
    "et al_. 2000 ) .",
    "tachibana & huss ( 2005 ) found that the degree of isotopic fractionation of sulfur in troilites ( fes ) in chondrules from bishunpur ( ll3.1 ) and semarkona ( ll3.0 ) is quite small ( @xmath2 for all the grains , except one grain that has @xmath3 ) .",
    "the absence of isotopic fractionation in troilites suggests that chondrules have to be heated rapidly ( @xmath4 ) at a temperature range of @xmath5 , in which the isotopic fractionation should occur associated with evaporation of troilites ( tachibana & huss 2005 ) . below @xmath6 , troilites is solid state and it is assumed that no isotopic fractionation occurs when solid troilite evaporates because the time scale of sulfur diffusion in fes is much larger than that of evaporation ( the evaporation pclet number for troilites at temperatures close to the eutectic point is about 100 for @xmath7-sized grain ) . on the contrary , above @xmath8 ,",
    "the melting troilite grains would have been surrounded by melted silicate . in this case ,",
    "evaporation of sulfur would be controlled by diffusion through the surrounding silicate melt . however , since sulfur can hardly dissolve to the chondrule silicate melt , the troilite would not evaporate and a large degree of isotopic fractionation is not expected .",
    "dust aggregates that have never melted before are thought to be fluffy .",
    "when such aggregates are heated , the isotopic fractionation of troilites should occur associated with the evaporation from inside of fluffy aggregates .",
    "if the heating rate is slow , it is impossible to suppress the isotopic fractionation , because the duration of the evaporation becomes long enough to produce certain amount of isotopic fractionation . on the other hand , since once molten dust particles are not fluffy , they do not have to be heated rapidly to prevent from isotopic fractionation because fes in the dust particle is completely covered by silicate components .",
    "thus , we do not have to take into account the isotopic fractionation during the cooling phase .",
    "namely , chondrules have to be heated rapidly at least in the first melting heating event .",
    "the isotopic fractionation can be suppressed due to not only the rapid heating but also the presence of back reaction from evaporated sulfur gas if the dust - to - gas mass ratio is large enough .",
    "however , in our situation , this effect can be negligible .",
    "tachibana & huss ( 2005 ) also calculated the degree of isotopic fractionation of sulfur under conditions of sufficiently high dust - to - gas mass ratio in a closed system , and concluded that the required dust - to - gas mass ratio to suppress the isotopic fractionation by the back reaction is higher than about ten thousands times the solar value .",
    "it means that the dust - to - gas mass ratio should be greater than about 100 .",
    "it has not been well investigated whether the shock - wave heating ( the gas drag heating ) works well in such extremely high dust - to - gas mass ratio environment or not , and to answer this problem is beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "thus , we do not take into account the back reaction in this study .",
    "tachibana _ et al . _",
    "( 2004 ) investigated the heating rate of chondrules in the framework of the shock - wave heating model and concluded that the gas drag heating in the post - shock region can heat chondrules rapidly enough to suppress the isotopic fractionation .",
    "however , it is known that chondrules are also heated in the pre - shock region due to the radiation emitted by ambient dust particles ( dc02 , ch02 ) .",
    "the effect is well known as the blanket effect , which was not taken into account in the study by tachibana _",
    "results by dc02 , in which the dust thermal radiation is taken into consideration as the radiation source , showed that the heating speed due to the radiation is too slow to suppress the isotopic fractionation ( @xmath9 ) .",
    "ch02 also performed numerical simulation taking the transfer of the dust thermal continuum emission into consideration .",
    "in contrast with dc02 , results of ch02 showed that the heating rate of chondrules is large enough to suppress the isotopic fractionation even if the pre - shock region is dusty environment ( dust - to - gas mass ratio is about 1.5 , which is a few hundreds times larger than that of the solar abundance ) .    in previous studies of shock - wave heating model taking into account the radiation transfer ( dc02 and ch02 ) ,",
    "only the dust thermal continuum was taken into consideration as the radiation source .",
    "however , there is the other radiation source , the line emission of gas molecules .",
    "dc02 and ch02 neglected the line cooling because they assumed that the shock region is optically too thick to its own line emission to lose gas thermal energy effectively . on the contrary",
    ", mn05 showed an estimation that the post - shock gas is not so optically thick and the post - shock gas in a few @xmath10 behind the shock front can cool . therefore ,",
    "the line cooling should be taken into account . moreover ,",
    "numerical simulations in dc02 and ch02 have done for the limited shock conditions ( the pre - shock gas number density is @xmath11 a few @xmath12 and the shock velocity is @xmath13 ) .",
    "these shock conditions are classified into the high - density and low - velocity shock waves in the appropriate shock condition for chondrule formation ( insn ) .",
    "recently , a new shock wave generation mechanism which are sufficient to account for melting of dust particles was proposed ( nakamoto _ et al .",
    "_ 2005 ) . in the case ,",
    "x - ray flares generated at close to the protosun induce the shock waves in the upper solar nebula where the gas density is low .",
    "the typical shock condition of the new mechanism is estimated as @xmath14 and @xmath15 .",
    "there is no study for the low - density and high - velocity shock waves taking into account the thermal radiation from dust particles .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to develop a new shock - wave heating code taking into account the radiation transfer of both the line emission of gas molecules and the dust thermal radiation and to investigate how the thermal history of dust particles in the shock waves is affected by the optical properties of the pre - shock region .",
    "especially , we focus the heating rate of precursor dust particles in a temperature range of @xmath5 , in which the isotopic fractionation should occur",
    ". the optical properties of the flow depend mainly on the dust size distribution and the dust - to - gas mass ratio .",
    "moreover , we perform the simulation with various shock conditions ( the pre - shock gas number density and the shock velocity ) in order to discuss which shock generating mechanism is appropriate for chondrule formation . we describe details of our model and basic equations in section 2 .",
    "we show the calculation results in section 3 and discussion in section 4 .",
    "finally , we summarize our study in section 5 .",
    "basic mechanism of the shock wave heating is rather simple .",
    "let us suppose there is a gas medium containing dust particles with a dynamical equilibrium , i.e. they do not have a relative velocity initially . and",
    "let us suppose a shock wave passes the medium .",
    "then , the gas is accelerated by the gas pressure and obtains some amount of velocity , while dust particles tend to remain the initial position .",
    "this causes the relative velocity between the dust particles and the gas . when the relative velocity is present , the frictional force and drag heating work on the dust particles ; the intensity of the force and the heating depend mainly on the relative velocity and the gas density .",
    "also , the high temperature gas in the post - shock region , heated by the compressional heating , heats the dust particles by thermal collisions .",
    "moreover , dust particles are heated by radiation emitted from gas molecules and other dust particles .",
    "dust particles are heated by those three processes , and cooled by emission of thermal radiation , the collision with cooler gas , and the latent heat cooling due to the evaporation .",
    "we have developed a new numerical model that simulates 1-dimensional plane - parallel steady shock flow including dust particles .",
    "the new model is based on our previous work ( mn05 ) and added the thermal radiation transfer part to the model of mn05 .",
    "we use the spatial coordinate , which is perpendicular to the shock front , in the shock front rest frame ( see fig . [",
    "fig : blanket_effect ] ) .",
    "the spatial extent of the calculation region is assumed to be the same as dc02 for comparison ( @xmath16 ) . as will be shown later ( sec .",
    "[ sec : extended_shock ] ) , the choice of @xmath17 is not a fundamental problem in this study .",
    "the origin is situated at the shock front .",
    "initially , gas and dust particles flow together at the same speed ( shock velocity ) from @xmath18 . in the pre - shock region ,",
    "dust particles are gradually heated by the radiation as they approach the shock front .",
    "we focus the heating rate of the dust particles in this phase . in order to calculate the radiation intensity in the pre - shock region",
    ", we also have to evaluate the post - shock structures because the radiation mainly comes from the gas and dust particles in that region .",
    "when the gas flow arrives at the shock front , it is suddenly compressed and decelerated by the post - shock gas pressure .",
    "we consider the j - type shock and the jump condition is given by the rankine - hugoniot relation .",
    "the temperature and the density of the gas in the post - shock region are determined by the atomic and molecular cooling processes , chemical heating / cooling , and energy transfer between the gas and the dust particles . after passing through the shock front ,",
    "dust particles have a relative velocity to the gas flow .",
    "the gas drag heating due to the relative velocity increases the dust temperature . in order to form chondrules",
    ", dust particles must be heated as high as the melting temperature .",
    "appropriate shock condition for chondrule formation , in which precursor dust particles are heated enough to melt and do not vaporize completely , is numerically and analytically derived by insn as a function of the shock velocity , @xmath19 , and the pre - shock gas number density , @xmath20 . in this study",
    ", we simulate with twelve different shock conditions in which chondrules can be formed ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : shock_condition ] ) .",
    "since line emission of gas molecules also heats dust particles , we have to estimate how much energy of line emission comes from the post - shock region .",
    "it is expected that some fraction of the line emission emitted from the post - shock region is absorbed by gas molecules before escaping toward the pre - shock region .",
    "previous studies of shock - wave heating are classified into two extreme cases ; one is that the line cooling is perfectly neglected ( _ e.g. _ , dc02 and ch02 ) and the other is that a constant fraction of line emission escapes from the post - shock region regardless of the column density of gas molecules ( _ e.g. , _ insn ) .",
    "dc02 suggested that the shock region is optically too thick to the line emission to lose more than @xmath21 of its energy . on the other hand ,",
    "insn considered that since the dust - melting region is very near from the shock front , the line cooling takes place at the region because the optical depth between the emitting region and the shock front is not so large",
    ". the real situation should be somewhere between these two models . in this study",
    ", we calculate the cooling rate due to the line emission taking the column density of gas molecules into consideration .",
    "since a half of emitted photons goes toward upstream and the rest photons go toward downstream , the column density for each direction is different .",
    "details are described in appendix [ sec : net_cooling_rate ] .",
    "the gas cooling due to the line emission contributes to a part of the source term of the radiation field .",
    "dc02 and ch02 solved the radiation transfer of the dust thermal continuum emission , however , they did not take into account the line emission of gas molecules .",
    "we add the source term due to the line emission to the radiation model .",
    "we consider that only the photons which can finally escape from the post - shock region contribute the radiation field .",
    "this is equivalent to the on - the - spot approximation ( osterbrock 1989 ) used in radiation transfer and photoionization calculations for h ii regions .",
    "details of formulation is described in appendix [ sec : emission_coefficient ] .",
    "the radiation affects the thermal histories of dust particles , and simultaneously depends on it .",
    "therefore , we have to calculate the gas / dust dynamics and the radiation transfer consistently .",
    "the procedure is iterated until the mean intensity does not change more than 1% .",
    "the heating and cooling processes violate the adiabatic condition of the gas .",

    "however , since the optically thick environment with such small spatial scale requires a very large dust - to - gas mass ratio ( @xmath252 or more ) , this situation might not be present in the protoplanetary disk .",
    "boss & graham ( 1993 ) suggested that the source of the shocks possibly responsible for chondrule formation was episodic accretion onto the solar nebula of low - mass clumps .",
    "the existence of the clumps is suggested by some observational evidences ( bellingham & rossano 1980 ) .",
    "they considered that the clumps are orbiting above the protoplanetary disk and sometimes obscuring the central star .",
    "when the clumps accrete onto the disk surface , the shock waves are generated at the upper region of the disk .",
    "boss & graham assumed that the following parameters characterize a  standard \" clump : mass @xmath253 ; density @xmath254 ; and radius @xmath255 . assuming the same parameters as the case of the gravitational instability except for @xmath256 and @xmath257 ( upper region of the protoplanetary disk is low density )",
    ", we obtained the pre - shock optical depth of @xmath258 .",
    "the optical depth is low enough to prevent the isotopic fractionation .",
    "therefore , the accretion shock waves seem to match with the rapid heating constraint . however , tanaka _ et al . _",
    "( 1998 ) carried out the hydrodynamic simulation of the accreting clumps based on the standard clump and they concluded that more than about @xmath259 to @xmath260 times surface densities for the same size of the representative clump are needed to produce chondrules .",
    "they also suggested that there are not so many observational studies of the clumpy clouds around the young stellar objects , so more massive clumpy clouds which are sufficient to melt the precursor dust particles might exist .",
    "nakamoto _ et al . _",
    "( 2005 ) proposed a new shock wave generation mechanism : shock waves in the upper region of the solar nebula induced by x - ray flares associated with the young sun .",
    "x - ray flares , common among t tauri stars ( feigelson _ et al . _ 2002 ) , emit plasma gas , which cools to be a strong neutral gas wind .",
    "( 1996 ) suggested that the magnetocentrifugal acceleration ( blandford & payne 1982 ) also plays an important role to produce the wind .",
    "because of the enormous amount of energy released by the x - ray flares and the magnetocentrifugal acceleration , the flares should have some effects on the dynamics and energetics of a protoplanetary disk around the star .",
    "( 2005 ) carried out 2-d mhd numerical simulations of x - ray flares around a central star and expanding magnetic bubles / winds with a disk .",
    "they showed that shock waves which are sufficient to melt precursor dust particles can be generated in the upper region of the nebula inside about the asteroid belt . in that case",
    ", it is thought that the shock waves are generated in a very wide region at the upper surface of the disk .",
    "the neutral gas wind travels in almost parallel with the disk surface much faster than the shock waves propagating vertically in the disk toward the midplane .",
    "therefore , the shock front caused by the neutral gas wind is approximately parallel to the disk surface and the horizontal scale of the shock front would be larger than the scale height of the gas disk .",
    "it indicates that the dust particles located at the midplane also can contribute to the blanket effect . as a result ,",
    "the optical depth perpendicular to the shock front might become much larger than unity .",
    "to summarize , there is a possibility that the x - ray flare induced shock waves result in the isotopic fractionation in spite that the chondrule formation occurs in the low gas density region .",
    "however , if the shock wave is non - steady , this difficulty may be avoided , because the dust in the midplane can become a large absorber of the radiation flux rather than a reflector and the blanket .",
    "this possibility will be discussed in the following subsection .",
    "we verified four shock generation models as the chondrule formation mechanisms .",
    "we found that most of shock waves can be classified into two categories ; the rapid heating and the rapid cooling , or the slow heating and the slow cooling ( see sec .",
    "[ sec : heating_cooling ] ) . if supporting an opinion that the slow cooling rate is appropriate for producing chondrules ( jones & lofgren 1993 ) , there are few cases in which both of two constraints are satisfied simultaneously ( see fig . [",
    "fig : heat_cool_rate_100]@xmath160[fig : heat_cool_rate_398 ] ) .",
    "how can we explain the chondrule formation with the rapid heating and the appropriate slow cooling ?",
    "one possibility to avoid above difficulties is to consider the non - steady shock wave model .",
    "when shock waves are generated in the solar nebula , the shocked gas just behind the shock front emits the line photons and they penetrate into the pre - shock region . although the radiation heats the dust particles in the pre - shock region , it will take time before the dust temperatures have a steady profile .",
    "if the shock waves disappear within a shorter period of time , the dust temperatures would not be as high as the steady profiles .",
    "therefore , the rapid heating constraint might be satisfied even in a relatively optically thick environment .",
    "the cooling rate of the precursor dust particles has not been investigated in the framework of the non - steady shock waves , so it is an important issue which should be studied in the future .",
    "another possibility is a multiple shock heating scenario . in this study",
    ", we assume the porous structures for the precursor dust particles in order to consider the evaporation of sulfur inside the aggregates . in that case",
    ", the rapid heating constraint is required in order to prevent the isotopic fractionation . however ,",
    "if the precursor dust particles have been once melted by some heating process , since the evaporation of sulfur inside the aggregates can hardly occur , the rapid heating might not be required .",
    "based on these discussions , we can consider the multiple shock heating scenario in which the rapid heating constraint and the appropriate slow cooling are both satisfied .",
    "in the first heating event , the precursor dust particles should be heated by the shock waves in which the rapid heating constraint is satisfied . at that time",
    ", the cooling rate can take any values .",
    "after that , in the final heating event , the once melted precursor particles should be heated by the shock waves with the appropriate slow cooling . at that time , the rapid heating is not required because the sulfur can not evaporate away from inside of the dense particles .",
    "in fact , there are some observational evidences of the multiple heating in chondrule formation processes ( jones _ et al .",
    "_ 2000 ) , so the above scenario seems to be reasonable .",
    "however , it is not clear whether the isotopic fractionation can take place from the once - molten particles or not .",
    "the condition of the isotopic fractionation from once - molten particles is also an interesting study .      for calculating the dust dynamics",
    ", we assumed dense structures for the chondrule precursor dust particles ( mass density is the same as a value of forsterite ) .",
    "however , it is thought that the precursor dust particles before melting have porous structures , therefore sulfur can evaporate from inside the dust particles and the isotopic fractionation can take place .",
    "if the porous structures are considered , a cross section of the dust particle would be larger than the dust model that we adopted in this study . as a result ,",
    "the optical depth of the pre - shock region @xmath147 would be larger , even if the dust model ( dust size distribution , dust - to - gas mass ratio ) is fixed . in this section",
    ", we consider to what extent the porous structures have an effect on our conclusions .",
    "figure [ fig : porosity ] shows schematic pictures of precursor dust particles having various porous structures .",
    "the dark gray region indicates a dense region in which the porosity is 0% .",
    "the light gray region indicates a porous region in which the porosity is assumed to be 80% so that sulfur can evaporate from inside of the porous region .",
    "we assume that the porous region is surrounding around the dense core .",
    "the volume percent of each region is displayed below each picture .",
    "we can obtain the dust radius of each structure from the volume percent of each region and the porosity of the porous region , assuming that the total masses of those particles are the same .",
    "we also display the radius and the cross section in units of the values for the case ( a ) , in which all the region of the precursor dust particle is dense .",
    "if all the region of the precursor dust particles is porous ( case ( d ) ) , the radius and the cross section are about 1.7 and 2.9 times larger than that of the case ( a ) , respectively .",
    "it indicates that the optical depth of the pre - shock region @xmath147 becomes about 3 times larger than that obtained in this study .",
    "for example , in the case that the shock model is n14v10 and dust model l03 ( see table [ table : summary_a251 ] ) , we obtained @xmath261 . however , if all dust particles have porous structures like the case ( d ) in fig .",
    "[ fig : porosity ] , @xmath147 would be about 2.13 .",
    "the increase of @xmath147 would result in that the dust temperature just in front of the shock front @xmath164 exceeds 1273 k ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : tpre2 ] ) and the isotopic fractionation takes place . on the contrary , in a case of the dust model l01 ,",
    "the optical depth of the pre - shock region @xmath147 would be about 0.7 if all precursor dust particles are assumed to have porous structures like the case ( d ) in fig .",
    "[ fig : porosity ] .",
    "this expected value of @xmath147 seems not to be so large that the isotopic fractionation would not occur . to summarize",
    ", we think that the discussion about the upper limit of @xmath147 for preventing the isotopic fractionation in secs . [",
    "sec : radiative_diffusion ] and [ sec : critical_optical_depth ] is not affected significantly by considering the porous structures because the dust temperature just in front of the shock front @xmath164 mainly depends only on @xmath147 and the net flux of the radiation @xmath101 ( see section [ sec : radiative_diffusion ] ) . however , the corresponding dust model ( dust size distribution , dust - to - gas mass ratio ) for a certain value of @xmath147 would be affected .",
    "finally , we notice that the structures of chondrule precursor dust particles have not been well investigated .",
    "although we assumed the porosity of the porous region as 80% for sulfur to evaporate from inside , a value of the porosity is unknown .",
    "moreover , it is not certain whether all region of the precursor dust particles should be porous or not .",
    "we can imagine the mixed structure like the case ( b ) in fig .",
    "[ fig : porosity ] , which has the dense core surrounded by the porous mantle . of course",
    ", since sulfur would be able to evaporate from inside of the porous mantle , it must be heated rapidly enough to prevent the isotopic fractionation . in the case",
    "( b ) , the cross section is about 1.5 times larger than that of the case ( a ) .",
    "therefore , although the internal structure of precursor dust particle would affect the optical properties of the pre - shock region , it is a very complex problem .",
    "if we take into account the internal structure of the dust particle into our model , it will require a large amount of parameter sets which characterize the dust structure .",
    "it is beyond the scope of this paper to investigate for all of the parameter sets .",
    "we assumed the one - dimensional , plane - parallel , and steady shock structures in this study . in these situations ,",
    "the radiation flux @xmath101 should be constant in the pre - shock region because there are not any radiative sources or sinks ( see appendix [ appen : constancy_radiation_flux ] ) .",
    "it is clearly shown in our numerical results ( see fig . [",
    "fig : flux ] ) .",
    "it indicates that the radiative heating takes place everywhere in the pre - shock region , even at the upstream boundary of the computational domain ( @xmath94 ) .",
    "the dust temperature at the boundary can be estimated from eq .",
    "( [ eq : temperature_shockfront3 ] ) by substituting @xmath262 .",
    "we obtain @xmath263 for @xmath264 , @xmath265 , and @xmath118 . on the contrary , we assume that the ambient temperature for the gas and the dust particles is @xmath97 .",
    "how can we recognize this temperature jump ?",
    "the answer is the three - dimensional effect of the chondrule - forming region .",
    "it is considered that the one - dimensional plane - parallel approximation would be adoptable near the shock front . in this region",
    ", the radiation would travel perpendicularly to the shock front and the radiative flux @xmath101 should be constant",
    ". however , far from the shock front , which is roughly estimated by the spatial extent of the shock front , the plane - parallel assumption breaks down .",
    "the radiation can diffuse away not only perpendicularly to the shock front but also to the other directions , therefore , the effect of the radiative heating becomes weak rapidly as it keeps away from the shock front .",
    "finally , the dust temperature becomes as the same as the ambient temperature .",
    "if the thermal histories of the dust particles below about @xmath266 are in interest , it would be needed to develop the two- or three - dimensional shock - wave heating model . in the case of the planetesimal bow shock",
    ", some studies about the multi - dimensional shock - wave heating have been carried out ( hood 1998 , weidenschilling _",

    ", we consider relatively large scale shock waves ( @xmath268 or more ) .",
    "moreover , the thermal histories of the dust particles below @xmath266 do not play an important role for our purpose .",
    "therefore , we do not treat the thermal evolutions of the dust particles before they enter the one - dimensional plane - parallel region .      in this study",
    ", we discussed the appropriate shock conditions and the dust models for chondrule formation with the rapid heating constraint , derived from the measurements of the isotopic composition of sulfur ( tachibana & huss 2005 ) .",
    "however , as commented in their abstract , this constraint is based on the assumption that the troilite grains within 15 ferromagnesian chondrules they measured are primary .",
    "they considered that some troilite grains have survived chondrule - forming high - temperature events because they are located inside metal spherules within chondrules . according to them ,",
    "such an occurrence is unlikely to be formed by secondary sulfidization processes in the solar nebula or on parent bodies .",
    "if those troilite grains are not primary , the rapid heating constraint would not be required necessarily . in our study , we found that the rapid heating ( @xmath232 ) does not seem to be compatible with the slow cooling ( @xmath269 ) , which is considered by many researchers to be appropriate for chondrule formation ( e.g. , jones & lofgren 1993 ) .",
    "however , we do not mean that we should adopt the rapid heating constraint rather than the slow cooling rate .",
    "we just investigated the thermal evolutions of the dust particles in the shock - wave heating for various situations by using a more realistic physical model .",
    "the rapid heating constraint is not needed to be assumed in order to derive our numerical results .",
    "we think that more experiments and observations are required for elucidating the riddles of chondrule formation .",
    "we believe that our simulations give a great insight of the shock - wave heating model for chondrule formation to readers .",
    "we numerically simulated the shock - wave heating for chondrule formation taking into account the radiation transfer of the line emission of gas molecules and the dust thermal continuum emission .",
    "regarding the line cooling due to the gas molecules , we estimated the cooling rate using the photon escape probability method in order to reflect the column density of gas molecules .",
    "we focused the dust thermal histories in the pre - shock region , especially the heating rate of chondrules @xmath161 , which has to be large enough to suppress the isotopic fractionation . in order to clear the condition in which the rapid heating constraint is satisfied , we performed simulations for various shock conditions , the pre - shock gas number density ( @xmath199 ) and the shock velocity ( @xmath270 ) , and the dust models , the initial dust size distribution ( the power - law size distribution and the lognormal one ) and the dust - to - gas mass ratio ( @xmath135 , @xmath271 , and @xmath272 ) .",
    "we found the following results :    1 .   the line emission can remove the post - shock gas thermal energy away even if the pre - shock gas number density is relatively high ( @xmath114 ) .",
    "therefore , the line emission plays an important role as the gas cooling mechanism .",
    "moreover , it indicates that it is also an important radiation source term .",
    "when the optical depth of the pre - shock region increases , it results into the higher dust temperatures in the pre - shock region .",
    "if the dust temperatures just in front of the shock front exceed @xmath6 , the heating rate of the dust particles in a temperature range of @xmath5 is too slow to prevent the isotopic fractionation . on the contrary ,",
    "the dust temperatures just in front of the shock front are lower than @xmath6 , the dust particles are heated by the gas frictional heating in the post - shock region so rapidly that the isotopic fractionation is prevented .",
    "therefore , the condition to prevent the isotopic fractionation is that the dust temperatures just in front of the shock front do not exceed @xmath6 .",
    "we analytically derived the dust temperature just in front of the shock front using the theory of the radiative diffusion .",
    "the analytic solution well explains the results of our numerical simulations for optically thick case ( optical depth of the pre - shock region @xmath190 ) .",
    "4 .   there is the upper limit of the optical depth of the pre - shock region above which the isotopic fractionation will occur .",
    "the value of the upper limit depends on the shock condition . for the low - velocity and high - density shock waves , the upper limit is about unity . for the high - velocity and low - density shock waves , it is about 10 .",
    "the fundamental factors to determine the pre - shock dust thermal histories are the gas energy flux flowing into the shock front and the optical depth of the pre - shock region . even if the spacial dimension of the shock - wave heating region is different , the dust temperatures just in front of the shock front become almost the same as long as the pre - shock regions take the similar values of the optical depths .",
    "we also evaluated the cooling rate of the precursor dust particles @xmath207 at a crystallization temperature .",
    "it was found that the dust thermal histories obtained by our simulations are roughly classified into two categories : the first is the slow heating ( @xmath230 ) and slow cooling ( @xmath231 ) , and the second is the rapid heating ( @xmath232 ) and the rapid cooling ( @xmath233 ) .",
    "if supporting an opinion that the slow cooling rate is appropriate for producing chondrules , it seems difficult to meet two conditions simultaneously in the framework of a one - dimensional , plane - parallel , and steady shock wave model . in order to satisfy the rapid heating constraint and the appropriate slow cooling constraint simultaneously , a non - steady shock wave model or a multiple heating scenario might be needed .",

    "so , we approximate the line transfer problem as follows .    assuming the isotropic scattering , the frequency - dependent radiation transfer equation taking into account absorption and scattering by the gas molecules and dust particles is given as ( e.g. , rybicki & lightman 1979 ) @xmath273 where @xmath274 , @xmath275 , and @xmath276 are the absorption coefficient , the scattering coefficient , and the emission coefficient , respectively .",

    "therefore , the large relative velocity does not allow the cooled gas to absorb ly@xmath32 photons emitted immediately behind the shock front .",
    "the cooling rate due to ly@xmath32 emission is given by spitzer ( 1978 ) as @xmath349 where @xmath350 and @xmath351 are number densities of electron and hydrogen atom in unit @xmath352 , respectively , and @xmath45 is the gas temperature in unit k.",
    "the radiation flux @xmath101 changing with the distance from the shock front indicates that there are some energy sources ( for @xmath353 ) or sinks ( for @xmath354 ) of the radiation .",
    "we can consider following two possibilities as the radiation sources / sinks ; ( 1 ) the medium ( gas and/or dust particles ) continues to emit or absorb the radiation energy and ( 2 ) the medium absorbs the radiation energy and then emits it at other places .",
    "let us consider the first possibility . in the post - shock region , it can occur . behind the shock front",
    ", there are the hot gas and dust particles which are heated by a shock wave .",
    "they emit the radiation , then cool and flow downstream , however , the new medium which is heated at the shock front continues to be supplied .",
    "therefore , there are eternal radiation sources behind the shock front ( for the steady state ) . on the contrary , in the pre - shock region",
    ", the gas and the dust particles can not be the radiation energy sources . in this region ,",
    "the main energy source is the radiation coming from the post - shock region .",
    "the gas and the dust particles in the pre - shock region just emit the radiation energy which is equal to the radiation energy that they absorbed .",
    "it indicates that they can neither produce nor consume the radiation energy inside themselves .",
    "therefore , in the pre - shock region , the first possibility will vanish",
    ".    the second possibility will also vanish if we consider the non - relativistic shock velocity .",
    "the radiation energy coming from the post - shock region diffuses into the pre - shock region at the effective speed of @xmath355 , where @xmath356 is the light velocity in the vacuum and @xmath147 is the optical depth of the pre - shock region ( e.g. , mihalas & mihalas 1999 , p.353 ) .",
    "considering @xmath357 , the light diffusion velocity is estimated as @xmath358 .",
    "since this is much larger than the shock velocity of about @xmath155 adopted by desch & connolly ( 2002 ) as the canonical case , the radiation energy can escape from the pre - shock region so fast that the gas and the dust particles can not transport the radiation energy .",
    "therefore , the second possibility will also vanish .        in fig .",
    "[ fig : flux ] , the radiative flux @xmath101 of model l10 does not seem to be constant in the pre - shock region .",
    "we thought that the reason is the shortage of the iteration to converge the mean intensity in the computational domain . in our model , we solve the gas / dust dynamics and the radiation transfer by turns until the mean intensity does not change more than 1% ( see sec .",
    "[ sec : overview_model ] ) .",
    "however , this condition does not guarantee the complete convergence .",
    "consider that the number of iteration which is required to satisfy above converge condition , @xmath359 , exceeds 100 .",
    "it indicates that the convergence of the mean intensity is very slow .",
    "if the iteration process has been continued more and more , the mean intensity would change near 1% per iteration for a while . repeating the iteration further 100 times , the mean intensity might change @xmath360 ! therefore , roughly speaking , the above converge condition is not enough for the complete convergence when @xmath361 .",
    "the numerical results for models of l03 and l01 would have converged enough because @xmath362 . however , for model of l10 , the numerical result would not have converged completely because @xmath363 .",
    "however , we do not think that we need more iteration in order to converge completely . in model of l10 ,",
    "the isotopic fractionation takes place because the dust temperature just in front of the shock front @xmath164 exceeds @xmath6 .",
    "if we have carried out the more iteration , @xmath164 would increase more and more .",
    "this does not change the result that the isotopic fractionation occurs .",
    "therefore , we think that our converge condition is meaningful to obtain our conclusions .",
    "regarding the radiative flux in the post - shock region , there is another region . in the middle panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : heatcoolrate_gas ] , we found that the gas temperature decreases near the right boundary of the computational domain ( @xmath364 ) . from the bottom panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : heatcoolrate_gas ] , we also found that the cooling source is the dust particles , namely , the gas thermal energy is converted into the dust thermal energy by the thermal collision between the gas molecules and the dust surface .",
    "since the dust particles are radiative equilibrium far behind the shock , the thermal energy transfered from the ambient gas radiates as the thermal radiation .",
    "since the thermal emission works as the radiation source , the radiative flux is not constant at this region .",
