    "the prime motivation for studying galaxies at high redshift is to learn the history and physics responsible for their formation .",
    "the first step in this process is to identify galaxy populations in the distant universe .",
    "this has been accomplished to a degree with the discovery and systematic study of sub - mm sources ( blain et al .",
    "2002 ) , lyman-@xmath13 emitters ( kodaira et al .",
    "2003 ) , extremely red objects ( moustakas et al . 2004 ) and lyman - break galaxies ( lbgs ; giavalisco 2002 ) .",
    "the latter category are uv bright star forming galaxies , typically at @xmath14 , which are thus far the best studied high redshift galaxy type .",
    "how these different galaxy populations are related to each other , and to galaxies in the modern universe is a major area of research , and is still largely an open question .",
    "another related issue is the history of the physical processes that drive galaxy formation , such as mergers , gas cooling or some combination of these ( conselice et al .",
    "one fundamental problem is whether or not we have identified the progenitors of the most massive galaxies in the local universe at these early times .",
    "there are several indications that at least some massive galaxy progenitors are high redshift lbgs .",
    "this includes clustering statistics showing that lbgs inhabit massive dark matter halos ( e.g. , giavalisco et al .",
    "1998 ; adelberger et al . 1998 ; adelberger et al .",
    "other , possibly more massive and evolved , galaxies exist at these redshifts , identified through infrared and sub - mm surveys , which may or may not be a subset of the lbg population ( e.g. , franx et al . 2003 ; chapman et al . 2003 ; daddi et al . 2004 ) .",
    "however , simple calculations show that the most massive galaxies today should be forming stars at @xmath1 , and it seems likely that a sub - set of the lbg population are in some form the progenitors of a sub - set of modern massive galaxies .",
    "there is however a problem with interpreting lbgs as the high redshift progenitors of modern massive galaxies .",
    "lbgs are nearly as luminous as the most luminous galaxies in the nearby universe , yet they have stellar populations with low mass to light ratios ( e.g. , papovich et al .",
    "2001 ; shapely et al .",
    "2001 ) , resulting in relatively low computed stellar masses .",
    "in fact , very few lbgs have stellar masses larger than the local value of m@xmath11 , the characteristic galaxy mass ( papovich et al . 2001 ; shapley et al .",
    "these low mass to light ratios imply that there is considerable star formation in lbgs , thus it is possible that extended star formation will produce galaxies with a large stellar mass by @xmath2 .",
    "however , when the observed ongoing star formation of lbgs is evolved to the present time , using reasonable assumptions , the resulting stellar masses are generally not large enough to be representative of massive galaxies in the nearby universe ( papovich et al .",
    "2001 ) . for lbgs to produce a large enough stellar mass by the time they evolve to @xmath2",
    ", they must have multiple episodes of star formation , or somehow prolong or rejuvenate starbursts . until recently ,",
    "there has been no obvious way to determine if or when lyman - break galaxies will undergo future bursts .",
    "one possible way for lbgs to increase their stellar mass and evolve into modern ellipticals , or spiral bulges , is through the merger process ( e.g. , conselice 2003a ; nagamine et al .",
    "major mergers are efficient at triggering star formation as well as building up the stellar mass of a galaxy through the addition of mass from the `` accreted '' galaxy .",
    "the idea that lbgs are involved in major mergers has been suggested through theoretical and empirical arguments ( e.g , somerville et al .",
    "2001 ; conselice et al .",
    "2003a ; weatherley & warren 2003 ) , yet no detailed calculations have been performed to determine the number of mergers these systems go through , or how much mass is potentially added to lbgs due to this process .",
    "we examine the evidence for major mergers at high redshift in this paper and calculate , based on empirical data , how many mergers a typical @xmath1 galaxy undergoes as a function of redshift , finding that a typical massive galaxy undergoes on average 4.4@xmath4 major galaxy mergers .",
    "this is an extension of our earlier work where the merger fraction is derived utilizing deep hst imaging of the hubble deep field ( conselice et al .",
    "this new paper presents a reanalysis of these merger fractions and includes n - body models to calibrate time - scales in which galaxies would be seen as mergers through their structures .",
    "this allows us to produce the first galaxy merger rates and merger histories at @xmath5 .",
    "we furthermore use the observed stellar masses of galaxies undergoing major mergers to determine the average stellar mass accumulation due to mergers , as a function of mass , and as a function of time .",
    "we also derive the amount of star formation likely induced by these mergers .",
    "we conclude that due to the merger process lbgs can become the most massive galaxies in today s universe through the major merger process , and most of this formation is complete by @xmath7 .",
    "we compare our empirical predictions with observations of how the stellar masses of galaxies grow with time , and with specific predictions from cold dark matter based models .    throughout this paper",
    "we use the following cosmology : h@xmath15 = 70 km s@xmath16 mpc@xmath16 , @xmath17 = 0.7 and @xmath18 = 0.3 .",
    " 2 summarizes the various data used in this paper to perform the calculations ,  3 is an analysis of merger fractions and rates , and their evolution , including a new fitting formalism ,  4 contains a calculation of how many mergers a high redshift galaxy will undergo , and how much stellar mass is added during this process , while  5 is a discussion of our results , and  6 is a summary .",
    "to constrain the role of mergers in forming galaxies requires understanding the merger history through pair and structural methods , and the measured stellar masses of @xmath1 galaxies .",

    "we therefore use the clumpiness index ( @xmath71 ) to remove star forming galaxies from consideration as a merger by the above criteria .",

    "we find that the merger fraction out to @xmath98 can be well fit by a power - law with power - law indices @xmath86 for all galaxy types .",
    "there are a few additional points about the merger fraction history that should be noted .",
    "the first is that for m@xmath97 and m@xmath99 galaxies there appears to be a peak turnover redshift around @xmath100 where the galaxy merger fraction declines at @xmath101 ( figure  1 ; conselice et al .",
    "this redshift can be computed analytically through d@xmath22/d@xmath25 = 0 , or @xmath102 , where we compute @xmath103 for galaxies with m@xmath97 and m@xmath104 .",
    "there does not appear to be a turnover redshift for the most luminous ( m@xmath46 ) and most massive ( m @xmath105 ) galaxies up to @xmath1 , although they must flatten off at some higher unknown redshift .",
    "using the merger fraction in a physical context requires that we understand the time scale in which a merger is occurring , and thus convert the galaxy merger fraction @xmath22 into a galaxy merger rate ( @xmath106 ) , defined within a redshift , luminosity , and mass range .",
    "the formalism for this is ,    @xmath107    where @xmath108 is the time scale for a merger to occur and @xmath109 is the co - moving or physical density of all galaxies within a given luminosity or mass range , and at a given redshift .",
    "determining @xmath108 is critical for utilizing the observed galaxy merger fraction , and for determining the importance of galaxy mergers for forming galaxies .",
    "since the time - scale of a merger is too long to observe directly , we must use theoretical arguments and models to determine the time - scale of major mergers .",
    "the co - moving or physical density @xmath110 can be determined from observations of the galaxy luminosity or mass function ( papovich et al . 2001 ; shapely et al . 2001 ) or by directly counting the number of galaxies within a luminosity or mass bin in the sample under study . if the former method is used , it is critical that the selection method be identical to the method for finding mergers .",
    "we use two methods , described below , for determining the time - scale of a merger : dynamical friction arguments and n - body models of the merging process .",
    "the typical method for determining the merger time - scale of two galaxies is the dynamical friction argument .",
    "this is based on the assumption that galaxies are embedded in dark matter halos .",
    "we revisit this computation here , although a more detailed analysis requires the use of simulations which we discuss in  3.3 .    to compute the time required for two galaxies to merge necessitates that we make some assumptions .",
    "the first is that the mass profile of galaxies are isothermal with a mass distribution that falls of as r@xmath111 .",
    "based on this , there is a fictional drag force that induces angular momentum loss .",
    "as such the two galaxies will gradually approach each other until they merge .",
    "the time for two galaxies , separated by @xmath112 , to be separated by @xmath113 is ,    @xmath114    where @xmath115 is the relative velocity between the two galaxies , @xmath87 is the mean accreted mass , and where we have assumed the coulomb logarithm , ln @xmath8 = 2 , based on equal mass merger simulations ( dubinksi , mihos & hernquist 1999 ; patton et al .",

    "2002 ) , finding @xmath116 km s@xmath16 and m @xmath117 , although these values will change when considering galaxies of different masses and luminosities .",
    "using these fiducial values , and the projected radii of a given pair , we calculate the time - scale for a merger to occur , or rather for the pair s separation to change from @xmath112 to @xmath118 .",
    "we use equation ( 7 ) as the time - scale for the merger rate for galaxies in pairs .",
    "typically , we find that the time for a merger to occur by equation ( 7 ) is 0.5 - 1 gyr , although the exact value changes under different assumptions .",
    "this is one reason why pair fraction methods are very difficult to convert into a physically meaningful quantity . throughout this paper",
    "we assume that the derived merger time - scales for galaxy pairs has an associated systematic uncertainty of 0.25 gyr .",
    "the structural method , utilizing the properties of galaxies after they have merged , has the potential to be more robust for quantifying the time - scale of a merger , and thus also the merger rate .",
    "the above argument reveals that the merger time scale for two galaxies of similar mass is roughly 0.5 gyr .",
    "our goal in this section is to understand if we can do better than this estimate utilizing the structures of galaxies , and the time - scale in which a galaxy will be identified as a merger structurally . to determine the time and mass scale sensitivity of galaxy structures to mergers we carry out and analyze a series of n - body models of galaxies undergoing mergers .",
    "these models are described in detail in e.g. , mihos & hernquist ( 1996 ) , dubinski et al .",
    "( 1999 ) and mihos ( 2001 ) .",
    "the models we use are composed of dark matter and stars .",
    "we do not include the morphological effects of star formation in these simulations , as modeling this aspect is very difficult with an infinite number of possibilities , whose reflection of actual properties is doubtful and is not straightforward to model . to test the effect of star formation , we place fake star forming complexes in these simulations by hand , which does increase the measured asymmetry .",
    "the clumpiness index however also increases such that the effective asymmetry @xmath119 matches the asymmetry before placing these star forming complexes in the n - body simulations (  3.1.4 ) .",
    "the techniques and detailed descriptions of these models can be found in hernquist ( 1993 ) and mihos & hernquist ( 1996 ) .",
    "each of the n - body models are composed of 294,912 luminous ( non - dark matter ) , and 65,536 dark matter particles , and are modeled using the treesph hierarchical tree ( hernquist 1987 ) .",
    "most of our models are composed of bulges and disks , with a bulge to disk ratio of 1:3 , while others are pure disks .",
    "the dark matter halo in these simulations are isothermal spheres with core radii equal to the scale length of each model s disk .",
    "the dark matter halo is truncated at radii larger than 10 times the core radius , with an exponential decline ( hernquist 1993 ) .",
    "the mass of the disk in these simulations is m@xmath120 , with a bulge mass of m@xmath121 and a halo mass of m@xmath122 , all in simulation units . scaling to the milky way this gives a total mass of 3.2 @xmath123 , and a model disk scale - length of 3.5 kpc .",
    "the ratio of the total masses for the simulated galaxy pairs in the merger simulations are 1:1 , 1:2 , 1:3 and 1:5 .",
    "we analyze images of these simulations using snap shots separated by 26 myrs . for each simulation",
    "we analyze a total of 61 snap shots from the beginning of the simulation until @xmath124 gyr .",
    "we analyze ten different simulations ( listed in table  1 ) at seven different viewing angles each .",
    "we study these n - body simulations using the same structural techniques used to study galaxies at high and low redshift using the cas morphological analyses techniques . for three mass ratios ( 1:1 , 1:2 , 1:3 ) we simulate mergers with a mix of the following orbital properties : inclined , retrograde and prograde .",
    "the prograde simulation contains one disk inclined by 20 to the orbital plane , while the inclined simulation has a 75 inclination , and the retrograde is at a 135 inclination .",
    "the three simulations at each mass include : one galaxy which is inclined and another which is retrograde ( ir ) , one galaxy which is prograde and another that is inclined ( pi ) , and simulations with one galaxy prograde and the other retrograde ( pr ) .",
    "figure  2 shows a graphical representation of the 1:1 ir simulation .",
    "we carry out cas measurements on these simulations in three different ways , each designed to match how these values are measured on actual galaxies .",
    "different measurement methods are important to consider as the resulting values of the cas parameters can vary depending on how the galaxies were detected and cataloged .",
    "the three main issues are : ( 1 ) when galaxies are merging are they detected in the same sextractor segmentation area ( conselice et al . 2003a , 2004 , 2005 ) ? , ( 2 ) when measuring the cas parameters during the merger , do you remove the second galaxy ? and ( 3 ) where the center is placed can change the outcome of the cas measurements .",
    "all of these points deserve discussion , although they are inherently related to each other .",
    "the process for measuring the cas parameters for a galaxy involves two steps , and because the next generation of morphological analyses will involve at least tens of thousands of galaxies , this process must be automated .",
    "we have therefore considered various approaches for measuring the cas parameters on these simulations .",
    "the detection process on hubble space telescope imaging almost universally involves the sextractor program which detects and splits galaxies using significance thresholds .",
    "usually the way this is fine - tuned is to separate galaxies by trial and error using the detection and separation parameters .",
    "however , it is inevitable that close galaxies will sometimes be placed in the same detection .",
    "the prevalence of this needs to be determined by examining galaxies by eye that are asymmetric , although details of this process are beyond the scope of the current paper .    however , there are situations were two galaxies are close enough during a merger that they should be considered the same system . in conselice ( 2003b )",
    "it is argued that the extent of a galaxy should be defined as the light within the petrosian radius . if there are two interacting galaxies , which are spatially close , then wherever the petrosian radius converges determines whether or not those two galaxies should be considered the same system or not . in this situation",
    "the center of the system will be between the two centers of the merging galaxies .",
    "as such , we also consider this center when performing cas measurements , determining the asymmetry time - scale for each scenario .",
    "we list the time - scale information for simulations at a representative viewing angle of 54 , the results of which are listed in table  1 as @xmath125 .",
    "this is the time in which the simulated galaxies are asymmetric enough to be considered a major merger using the same criteria used on high redshift galaxies .",
    "another scenario we consider is when the center of the cas run is placed on the brightest galaxy s center and when the fainter galaxy or pair is not removed .",
    "the time in which this pair will be seen as an asymmetric merger , with @xmath75 , is listed in table  1 as @xmath126 .",
    "very often however , what occurs in the sextractor process is that two galaxies are separated into different systems .",
    "the cas code has an option , which is now being used ( e.g. , conselice et al . 2004 ) , to remove all galaxies from an image not currently being analyzed .",
    "we are then left with a single galaxy . to mimic this method we only image one galaxy at a time in our simulation , and measure its cas parameters .",
    "this is effectively the same approach used in conselice et al .",
    "( 2003a ) where the cas values were measured within the area given by the segmentation maps .",
    "neighboring galaxies were however not removed , similar to the sim2 simulations whose time - scales we use in  3.3.4 to obtain merger rates .",
    "one result of the ` galaxy removal ' simulations is shown in figure  3 where the asymmetry , concentration , and size measurements for the brightest galaxy in a merging pair are shown as a function of time in the 1:1 ir simulation ( figure  2 ) . to determine the effects of viewing angle on these time scales , we viewed the merger simulations at viewing angles of 15 , 54 , 77 , 90 , 117 , 145 , and 165 , finding the same result to within 0.2 gyr .",
    "there are several observations to take away from figure  3 .",
    "the first is that for the 1:1 , 1:2 and 1:3 simulations each galaxy starts with a low asymmetry and a high concentration . in the 1:1 simulation ,",
    "as the two galaxies start to interact , at about 0.4 gyr ( see figure  2 ) , the structures become more asymmetric . for an interval of @xmath127 gyr",
    "these galaxies remain asymmetric enough due to this encounter to be identified as an asymmetric merging galaxy . after the initial encounter , the galaxies separate and contain a lower asymmetry until 1 gyr into the simulation when both galaxies become asymmetric for another 0.2 - 0.3 gyr . at about 1.3 gyr",
    "the two systems have completely merged and the merger remnant has cooled enough dynamically to have a low structural asymmetry . note that from figure  3 the asymmetry evolution of the 1:1 simulation is to first order independent of orbital type ( table  1 ) .",
    "some variation does exist , for example the 1:1 ir simulation has a delayed asymmetry response during the second peak , although this does not change the derived effective merger time - scale .",
    "the cas merger time - scale sensitivity for the more massive galaxy in this configuration ( @xmath128 ) , with the lower mass galaxy not imaged , is tabulated in table  1 .",
    "the listed values of @xmath129 are the cas merger time - scales for the lower mass of the pair , when the more massive system is not imaged .",
    "we find that the two times are nearly identical , that is the time scale is independent of mass , and mass ratio up to 1:3 .",
    "the average and 1 @xmath80 range in the time - intervals in which the asymmetry index is sensitive to finding a merger are @xmath130 , @xmath131 , @xmath132 , and @xmath133 .",
    "the 1 @xmath80 systematic range quoted for these different time intervals are taken from the values in table  1 .",
    "they thus include ranges in mass ratio and orbital properties , but do not include systematics from different viewing angles , which adds another 0.1 gyr uncertainty .",
    "note that these 1 @xmath80 systematic ranges are not proper 1 @xmath80 error measurements on the time - scales in which galaxies at high redshift will merge within .",
    "they are only the 1 @xmath80 range in the merger time - scales for the galaxy simulations that we study , which likely does not represent the real range in these galaxies .",
    "the simulations discussed in  3.3 are for galaxies with a 1:3 bulge to disk ratio",
    ". the merger time - scale can vary if the structure of galaxies are different from the bulge / disk ratios we assumed for our initial galaxies .",
    "as such , we perform a 1:1 simulation of two pure disk galaxies , the results of which are shown in table  1 as 1:1nob .",
    "we find that the pure disk galaxy simulations are asymmetric enough to be counted as a merger for a longer period of time than galaxies with bulges , by as much as a factor of two .",
    "this is the case when we consider the simulations where only one galaxy is considered ( @xmath128 and @xmath129 ) as well as when both galaxies are used in the cas computations ( @xmath134 and @xmath126 ) .",
    "the reason for this is that these pure disks do not decrease in asymmetry after the first encounter .",
    "the presence of a bulge is a stabilizing entity that creates a lower asymmetry when the two simulated galaxies are in the process of merging .",
    "this creates some uncertainty in the time - scale for the merger , although as discussed in  3.3.3 , this effect is not likely to be large when we consider the numerous mergers a massive galaxy undergoes , and the likely formation of bulge - like systems in massive galaxies by @xmath1 ( baugh , cole & frenk 1996 ; ferguson et al .",
    "2004 ) .",
    "we investigate a minor merger model , a 1:5 mass ratio merger , whose resulting asymmetry , concentration , and size as a function of time is shown in figure  4 .",
    "the most obvious result of this simulation is that neither galaxy ever obtains an asymmetry value high enough to be considered a major merger .",
    "the two galaxies do not effectively merge until 3.5 gyr into the simulation when the asymmetry becomes high , but just shy of the @xmath135 limit for a merger at @xmath72 .",
    "the time - scale for this minor merger to complete is much longer than the lower mass ratio major mergers , with a total merger time of @xmath136 gyr .",
    "since the age of the universe at @xmath20 is small ( 3.3 gyr ) , it is unlikely that a single minor merger can produce the high asymmetry signal seen in high redshift galaxies .",
    "although we caution that more extensive simulations of lower mass ratio mergers with different initial conditions are needed to fully determine the generality of this .",
    "this simulation also likely does not match the initial conditions of galaxies in pairs , and the distributions of orbital energies for high@xmath21 pairs which is currently unknown .",
    "we also can not rule out the possibility that multiple minor mergers are occurring at once to produce a large asymmetry signal .",
    "more n - body models of different merger scenarios are necessary to address these issues .    from the analysis in this section we conclude that the mergers of galaxies with mass ratios higher than 1:5 are not likely producing a merger signal through the asymmetry index .",
    "if this is indeed the case , and we assume it is for the remainder of this paper , then it implies that the cas method for finding mergers is a powerful approach that is insensitive to minor mergers , even a 20% mass merger .",
    "this is further confirmed empirically through observations of galaxies in pairs in the local universe ( hernandez - toledo et al .",
    "2005 ) .",
    "the simulations we examine above are necessarily limited , and only offer a subset of the possible variety of conditions experienced by galaxies undergoing mergers / interactions at high redshift .",
    "it is currently not feasible to perform a more general analysis than the above , as a full suite of self - consistent n - body simulations with all possible initial conditions does not yet exit .",
    "the simulations we examine are low speed encounters with isothermal dark matter profiles .",
    "however , we consider several other possibilities , including high - speed encounters between galaxies , galaxies with dark matter profiles that differ from isothermal , and galaxies mergers that have different masses than the nominal milky way mass considered here .",
    "first , high speed encounters between galaxies has been modeled by moore , lake & katz ( 1998 ) through ` galaxy harassment ' .",
    "these interactions can result in significant mass loss ( conselice 2002 ) , and is likely ongoing in clusters today ( conselice & gallagher 1999 ; gregg & west 2004 ; adami et al . 2005 ) .",
    "this may also be an important process for forming dwarf galaxies .",
    "however , these encounters do not produce a significant morphological disturbance in a galaxy . over time harassment",
    "can destroy disks , but this process has a time scale much longer than the life - times of the morphological disturbances we measure with the asymmetry index .",
    "these high - speed impulsive encounters increase the internal energy of the interacting systems , which results in a galaxy which physically expands , but does so in a uniform manner .",
    "we therefore consider it an unlikely possibility that very high speed galaxy encounters can produce a large asymmetry signal that we would identify as a major merger .",
    "another complication is that galaxy interactions which do not necessarily merge , can potentially create a large asymmetry that would be miscounted as a merger .",
    "these false - positive mergers are unlikely , based on several arguments .",
    "the first is that empirically only nearby galaxies that are within a radii of each other produce a large asymmetry signal ( hernandez - toledo et al .",
    "as these nearby pairs are within a few 10s of kpc of each other , and have very small velocity differences , they are in the processes of merging , as they simply do not have a high enough velocity to escape .",
    "galaxies which are interacting , but are not as close as a scale - length , do not have asymmetry values in the merger regime ( hernandez - toledo et al .",
    "these results are also suggested by our n - body models where a similar pattern is seen .",
    "furthermore , if high redshift galaxies have an initial velocity difference which is large , and therefore repeated ` fly - bys ' occur until a final merger takes place , only the low velocity encounters will produce a large asymmetry . based on our models",
    "we include only one fly - by . however , we consider in the analysis in  3.3.4 the asymmetry merger time - scale becoming larger due to more than one fly - by .",
    "a further complication in these models is that the mass of the most massive system is similar to the milky way .",
    "the dynamical friction time scale for two galaxies to merge is largely independent of the mass ratio of the two galaxies , as long as they can be considered point - like particles .",
    "however , once the two systems begin to interact strongly the time - scale can vary ( hernandez & lee 2004 ) .",
    "after the two galaxies merge , the relaxation time - scale ( @xmath137 ) depends on the density of the merger remnant such that @xmath138 using the fundamental plane relation we know that the luminosity of a galaxy is proportional to a factor ( @xmath93 ) of its velocity dispersion , or @xmath139 n - body models suggest that merger remnants follow this relationship ( e.g. , capelato et al . 1995 ; aceves & velazquez 2004 ; boylan - kolchin , ma & quataert 2005 ) . using the relationship @xmath140 and the fact that @xmath141 , we can write the ratio of the relaxation time - scale for merger remnants at two different masses as ,    @xmath142    assuming that the ratio @xmath143 is independent of m@xmath144 . by using the value @xmath145 found through the sloan digital sky survey ( bernardi et al",
    ". 2003 ) , we obtain the second part of equation ( 8) , or that the time - scale increases as m@xmath146 .",
    "this suggests that the asymmetry - time scale during relaxation from a merger has a weak dependence on the total mass .",
    "we account for this dependence in  3.3.4 .    finally , it is possible that the dark matter halos of galaxies at high redshift are different than the ones used in our simulations .",
    "one possibility is that the dark matter profile is less step and dense than an isothermal profile , such that the dynamical friction time - scale is shorter . using a variety of reasonable possible dark matter profiles , mihos , dubinksi & hernquist ( 1998 ) and dubinski , mihos & hernquist ( 1999 )",
    "investigate how different profiles will change the structure of tidal tails and features in merger galaxies .",
    "these papers , particular dubinski et al .",
    "( 1999 ) , show that extended profiles do not produce tidal tails , however the inner parts of these galaxies are distorted due to the merger , irrelevant of the dark matter profile , and this is the part of the galaxy that contributes the most to the asymmetry signal .",
    "we have not analyzed these simulations since the parameter space of possible dark matter halo profiles at high redshift is infinite , as there are currently no observational constraints .",
    "it therefore remains an unaccounted for systematic in our merger time - scales .",
    "we can use the above information to determine a few very important quantities that have up until now been largely unknown .",
    "the first is the time in which two galaxies merging will be identified as a merger within the cas system . in section 3.3",
    ", we describe the total amount of time our simulated galaxies appear asymmetric , yet we can divide this time further into the time a galaxy is asymmetric due to a ` fly - by ' encounter , and before the galaxy relaxes after the merger occurs .",
    "we therefore divide the cas merger time - scale into two different components : a fly - by asymmetry time ( @xmath147 ) , and an asymmetry relaxation time ( @xmath148 ) .",
    "note that these two quantities are solely define as the time when the asymmetry value ( @xmath70 ) is @xmath10 0.35 . in the simulations we analyze ,",
    "the merger begins to relax after 0.7 gyr , which we use as the dividing line between the fly - by and relaxation time - scales .",
    "if there is more than one fly - by before the final merger , then the time - scale will include several factors of @xmath147 .",
    "we denote the number of fly - by interactions as @xmath149 and express the merger asymmetry time scale @xmath150as :    @xmath151    to calculate merger rates using @xmath152 we will use the average results of the major merger simulations where the pair of the galaxy under studied was not removed , namely @xmath126 ( table  1 ) with a total asymmetry merger time - scale of @xmath153 .",
    "this is the simulation where the analysis mode matches the method used to derive the merger fractions in the hubble deep fields .",
    "we find on average that the fly - by time scale is @xmath147 @xmath55 0.23@xmath1540.05 gyr , which we find is relatively independent of mass ratio . because this time is due to dynamical friction , it is also relatively independent of total mass ( carlberg et al .",
    "we further find from the @xmath126 simulations that the average relaxation time - scale is @xmath148 = 0.20@xmath1540.05 gyr , which is also largely independent of the merger mass ratio . the small error range on these numbers results from using sim2 from table  1 , whose total asymmetry time range is 0.08 gyr (  3.3 ) .",
    "this is likely an underestimate , as the actual range in physical properties is certainly larger than what current n - body simulations can provide .",
    "later , we add uncertainties from the merger fractions , and the 0.1 gyr uncertainty due to the viewing angle , to these errors when computing merger rates and the merger history (  4 ) .    from equation ( 8) , the value of @xmath148 also depends slightly on the mass of the merger remnant . as the total mass of our simulated galaxies",
    "are 3.25 @xmath123 , we can write the asymmetry merger time scale as a function of mass ( @xmath155 ) as ,    @xmath156 @xmath157    we use equation ( 10 ) for the asymmetry merger time - scale in the following calculations . for the reasons discussed in  3.3.3 we will only consider cases when @xmath158 .",
    "there are two other systematic errors that we also consider .",
    "first , there is a possible systematic increase in the merger time - scale of @xmath159 gyr if the galaxies undergoing mergers do not include a bulge .",
    "observations suggest that the most massive galaxies at @xmath82 have a central light concentration , often consistent with bulge - like features ( conselice et al .",
    "2005 ; ravindranath et al .",
    "submitted ) , thus it is not likely that many of the massive galaxies merging at this time are pure disks .",
    "simulations also suggest that modern ellipticals formed from bulge like systems , as pure disk mergers do not produce correct elliptical galaxy scaling relationships ( gonzalez - garcia & balcells 2005 ) .",
    "the time - scale given by equation ( 10 ) is also similar to that found empirically for real disk - disk mergers ( hernandez - toledo et al .",
    "2005 ) .",
    "we can then derive from equation ( 10 ) the rate of galaxy merging for systems with different masses and luminosities ( figure  5 ) . to calculate merger rates we use eq .",
    "( 6 ) and eq . (",
    "10 ) , where for a milky way mass galaxy , @xmath160 gyr .",
    "we use in equation ( 6 ) the best - fit merger fraction values as a function of redshift , @xmath161 , as discussed in  3.1 .",
    "we assume @xmath162 and @xmath163 to convert luminosities and stellar masses into total masses .",
    "the number densities of galaxies at various redshifts used in eq .",
    "( 6 ) are computed using the observed total number of galaxies in these various calculations ( conselice et al . 2003a , c ; patton et al .",
    "2000 ; patton et al .",
    "finally , figure  5 shows the calculated merger rates in co - moving volume units and in physical volume units .",
    "figure  5 shows that the merger rate at all luminosities and masses is relatively constant from @xmath1 to @xmath38 , but drops rapidly at @xmath6 .",
    "this implies that from @xmath1 to @xmath38 galaxy mergers are very common , but at later times they drop quickly .",
    "this can be seen directly in the galaxy population .",
    "the gross morphologies of galaxies at @xmath38 are very similar to their distributions and properties at @xmath2 ( conselice et al .",
    ". this would not be the case if major mergers were still occurring in large numbers , as spiral galaxies would rapidly evolve morphologically as they merge ( e.g. , hernandez - toledo et al .",
    "2005 ) .",
    "furthermore , figure  5 shows that the merger rate is high for lower - mass and fainter galaxies , such that there are more major mergers occurring per unit time , per unit volume , than for the most massive systems .",
    "however , because there are so many low - mass and faint galaxies at all redshifts , the merger fraction is lower than for massive and luminous galaxies ( figure  1 ; conselice et al .",
    "an important question to ask is why the merger fraction is so much lower for the lower mass and less luminous galaxies .",
    "one possibility is that because higher mass and more luminous galaxies cluster more strongly than the lower mass and lower luminosity systems ( e.g. , giavalisco & dickinson 2001 ; adelberger et al .",
    "2005 ) the most massive systems are more likely to merge .",
    "minor mergers are likely playing some role in the formation of galaxies at the redshifts we study , however we can not place constraints on this process using the current techniques .",
    "another result from our simulations is that the cas methodology for finding mergers can be successfully used to find major mergers .",
    "this means we can make reasonable assumptions about how much mass is added to galaxies identified as ongoing mergers .",
    "we hereafter assume that the average accreted galaxy pair is 65% of the mass of the original , or that the mass ratio of mergers are 1:1.5 in the calculations that follow .",
    "understanding the modes of star formation at high redshift , that is determining what triggers the formation of stars , is still largely uncertain .",
    "one of the first attempts to quantify this was in conselice et al .",
    "( 2003a , 2005 ) where it was argued that a significant fraction of galaxies at high redshift are undergoing mergers .",
    "we further argued that the merger rate and mass accretion rate due to mergers can be computed using assumptions about the merger time - scale at high redshift .",
    "thus , using the results from the n - body simulations discussed above , we can now tentatively calculate the history of galaxy merging for the first time .",
    "if we assume that @xmath12 galaxies are undergoing major mergers in the quantitative way described earlier through the computed galaxy merger fractions , then we can use this characterization to determine the average number of major mergers an average galaxy of a given mass at @xmath1 will undergo by the time it reaches @xmath2 .",
    "this is computed by integrating the merger rate divided by the density ; or the fraction of galaxies observed at each redshift undergoing a major merger divided by the time scale in which a merger remains identifiable as a merger ( @xmath108 ) . by integrating this , we obtain the number of mergers an average galaxy undergoes between @xmath164 and @xmath165 ( @xmath30 ) ,    @xmath166    where @xmath22 is the galaxy merger fraction , @xmath108 is the asymmetry merger time scale ( eq .",
    "10 ) , and the parameter e(@xmath25 ) = ( @xmath167 = h@xmath16(@xmath25 ) . we have assumed a power - law increase for the form of @xmath22 , since this is the best fitting formula for the most massive and most luminous galaxies .",
    "this is easy to change when considering power - law / exponential fits for lower mass galaxies , which we do when determining the number of mergers and the resulting mass accreted in these systems .",
    "this calculation also requires that we track the evolution of the stellar masses of these galaxies , as the values of m@xmath168 and @xmath84 evolve with time and stellar mass .",
    "however , for the most massive galaxies we do not have the mass resolution at m@xmath169 to carry out this solution .",
    "future studies that utilize larger samples will have this resolution , and a formal solution utilizing eq . (",
    "11 ) can be applied with the evolving merger history included .    according to this formalism , and using the best fit values for m@xmath168 and @xmath84",
    ", we calculate the merger history of galaxies at various initial masses and luminosities .",
    "figure  6 shows the cumulative number of mergers an average galaxy with initial stellar masses of 10@xmath170 , 10@xmath171 , and 10@xmath172 , undergoes as a function of redshift , starting at @xmath1 .",
    "just as in  3.3.4 , we utilize the merger time - scale from sim2 ( table  1 ) and include in the error budget the time - scale range from different orbital properties , mass ratios and viewing angles .    based on this",
    ", we find that a 10@xmath170 galaxy will experience 4.4@xmath4 major mergers according to this formalism by @xmath2 using equations ( 10 - 11 ) .",
    "if we consider that mergers occur with two fly - bys instead of the one we assume , then the total number of mergers will be @xmath55 3 , and if we assume that all of these mergers occur with pure disks as progenitors , then an average system will undergo @xmath173 mergers .",
    "however , as argued in  3.3.3 and above , neither of these extreme scenarios are likely .",
    "it is possible that the merger time - scales for galaxies are shorter at higher redshifts than at @xmath2 , which would imply that the asymmetry time - scale @xmath108 would also be shorter .",
    "we use the observed evolution of the sizes of high redshift galaxies to approximate how the merger time - scale could possibly change as a function of redshift .",
    "ferguson et al . ( 2004 ) find that the sizes of lyman - break galaxies evolve with redshift such that the average measured radius increases as h@xmath16(@xmath25 ) = e(@xmath25 ) = ( 0.3(1+@xmath25)@xmath174 + 0.7)@xmath175 in our cosmology . if the merger time - scales increases linearly with radius , then @xmath176 @xmath55 e(@xmath25 ) .",
    "when we consider this evolution of @xmath177 with redshift we find that the most massive galaxies undergo more mergers between @xmath178 and @xmath72 , roughly 15.2@xmath179 .",
    "we also calculate these curves for the lower mass galaxies using the power - law / exponential formalism for the merger fraction history @xmath22 in eq .",
    "this is however an extreme scenario and there is no evidence that the merger time - scale at high redshift is any shorter than it is at @xmath2 .",
    "interestingly , in all cases the lower mass galaxies experience a similar number of mergers by @xmath2 ( figure  6 ) .",
    "the major difference is that for the most massive galaxies , most of these mergers occur earlier at @xmath5 , while the lower mass systems have few major mergers at similar redshifts .",
    "most merging for galaxies with m @xmath105 appears complete by @xmath7 , with no major mergers after this time .",
    "this implies that massive galaxy formation is complete by @xmath7 if major mergers are the dominate mechanism for forming high mass systems .",
    "the stellar mass of a galaxy undergoing a merger increases due to the stellar mass accreted in the merger , as well as from any star formation induced during the merger .",
    "below we present a very general calculation and formalism for calculating the way stellar mass can be increased in galaxies during the merger process . since galaxies at high redshift are thought to be gas rich systems , the amount of stars produced during a burst can be quite significant .",
    "there are some estimates for the ongoing and past star formation rates in lyman - break galaxies that we use to determine how much stellar mass is added due to the star formation induced during a merger . in general , the total amount of stellar mass added to a galaxy over time is given by @xmath180 , @xmath181    where @xmath182m@xmath183 and @xmath182m@xmath184 are the amounts of stellar mass added due to star formation induced by the merger and from gas accretion , respectively , while @xmath182m@xmath185 is the amount of stellar mass added due to the merger process . since from  3.3 we know that only mergers with mass ratios of 1:3 or less will produce the signal for a major merger in the cas system , the amount of mass added in a merger detected through the cas method must be similar to the original galaxy s mass .",
    "the amount of stellar mass added due to star formation induced from a merger can be calculated from fitting the spectral energy distributions ( seds ) of high redshifts star forming galaxies to model star formation histories . by doing this , the best form for the star formation history can be retrieved .",
    "several studies have investigated the stellar populations , star formation history , and stellar masses of galaxies at @xmath186 .",
    "what is generally found is that the star formation history can be fit as either constant , exponential , or in bursts , but with the exponential model the most general and best fit ( papovich et al .",
    "2001 ) .    in papovich",
    "( 2001 ) and shapley et al .",
    "( 2001 ) , the spectral energy distributions of lbgs are fit to a star formation model that gives the current star formation rate ( @xmath187 ) , the e - folding time of the starburst ( @xmath188 ) , and the current stellar mass at solar and 0.2 solar metallicities , and with salpeter and scalo initial mass functions ( shapley et al .",
    "( 2001 ) only fit for solar metallicity however ) .",
    "these models generally assume that the star formation history exponentially declines from an initial star formation rate @xmath189 , such that the star formation rate at a given later time @xmath190 is ,    @xmath191    this fitting also gives an age for the burst ( t@xmath192 ) .",
    "this is however the star formation law for the most recent burst of star formation .",
    "if there are several episodes of star formation this is not easily revealed through the seds of galaxies .",
    "one problem with these fits is that they are based only on seds out to the observed k - band , and thus could in principle be missing a significant amount of older stellar mass .",
    "preliminary results using _ spitzer _ observations reveal that there is not a large missing old stellar population in lyman - break galaxies , and the fitted @xmath189 and @xmath188 parameters do not differ significantly after adding in the rest - frame near infrared to the sed fitting ( barmby et al .",
    "2004 ) .",
    "we perform calculations of how much stellar mass is added to galaxies due to induced star formation with some trepidation since the exact form of the star formation history of galaxies is still largely undetermined from observations , and may not have a unique solution , or standard form .",
    "the following results should be taken as a general first step at solving this problem , and not as a final quantitative result .",
    "although the starbursts we see in lbgs are ongoing , and thus have already created some of their stellar material , we use these fits to predict how much stellar mass will be created through future events by assuming future star formation will be similar , and induced during each merger . the amount of stellar mass created through starbursts induced through mergers ( @xmath182m@xmath183 ) is then ,    @xmath193 @xmath194    where @xmath165 and @xmath164 are the final and observed redshifts , respectively , @xmath195 is the hubble time , and @xmath196 is the time from the onset of the merger until the present day , and for integration purposes can be effectively considered infinite .",
    "when @xmath197 we can approximate the star formation part of equation ( 13 ) as @xmath198 .",
    "we can then compute the amount of stellar mass added during mergers due to induced star formation as @xmath182m@xmath199 , where @xmath30 is the number of major mergers . for these calculations we use the median values , @xmath200 = 20 myrs , and an ongoing star formation rate @xmath189 = 32 m@xmath15 yr@xmath16 , for @xmath20 lbgs ( papovich et al .",
    "we normalized the initial star formation rate by computing the average specific star formation rate for the papovich et al .",
    "sample and calculated the actual star formation rate for each galaxy mass by assuming that the specific star formation rate is scale free .",
    "we obtain very similar results if we use the average star formation rate for all stellar masses .",
    "we also include the amount of stellar mass added from the ongoing merger ( @xmath201 ) observed in each system through a similar method .",
    "there are some caveats to this approach .",
    "the first is that the values of @xmath200 in papovich et al .",
    "are not well constrained . as such ,",
    "it is possible that our reconstructed star formation histories are not representative of the actual stellar mass produced in high redshift star formation events .",
    "an alternative method is to assume that the star formation is produced in bursts within a given duration at a constant rate .",
    "the implementation of this formalism results in effectively the same mass formed as the exponential star formation rate over an infinite ( or very long ) period of time .",
    "if the burst duration is 100 myr , then the amount of mass formed would be roughly three times higher than the exponential star formation decline .    to obtain the stellar mass added to a given galaxy through the mergers themselves , we tried two method , which are nearly identical .",
    "first , we used the empirical formalism in conselice et al .",
    "( 2003a ) which gives the amount of stellar mass accretion onto a galaxy due to major mergers as a function of redshift .",
    "this can be generalized as :    @xmath202    where @xmath203 , as before , is given by @xmath204 $ ] and @xmath205 is the empirically calculated stellar mass added to a galaxy due to major mergers every gyr per galaxy .",
    "we also estimated the number of mergers a galaxy undergoes using the relationship @xmath206 for equal mass mergers , or in our case @xmath207 for 1:1.5 mass ratio mergers , where m@xmath15 is the initial stellar mass of the galaxy .",
    "both methods give similar stellar mass accretion rates from the major merger process .    by using @xmath108 from equation ( 10 ) , and",
    "the values @xmath208",
    "= 2.7@xmath1540.5 , @xmath209 , and @xmath210 = 1.47 , based on our empirical fits discussed in this paper for galaxies with m@xmath3 , we compute the final @xmath2 stellar mass of an average massive ( m@xmath3 ) @xmath178 galaxy .",
    "the result of these calculations is show in figure  7 where the stellar mass build up for galaxies of different initial stellar masses are shown .",
    "based on this , it can be seen that the most massive galaxies , those with m@xmath211 at @xmath1 , appear to evolve into galaxies with stellar masses @xmath212 by @xmath2 .",
    "thus , from the merger process , lyman - break galaxies can become the most massive galaxies in today s universe .",
    "the lower stellar mass systems , with m@xmath79 and m@xmath213 , also increase by up to two orders of magnitude in stellar mass due to the major merger process ( figure  7 ) .",
    "the majority of this increase in stellar mass is due to the major merging activity .",
    "that is , their stellar mass increases over time because there are on average 4 - 6 major mergers occurring per galaxy , and each one will slightly less than double the stellar mass . the star formation appears to contribute a small fraction , roughly 10 - 30% of the new mass , although this can be much higher ( up to 50% ) if we consider a larger amount of star formation within bursts , as discussed above .    in summary , it appears that the most massive lbgs at @xmath1 can become galaxies with stellar masses @xmath214 .",
    "these galaxies rapidly merge between @xmath1 and @xmath89 where the mass increases by a factor of ten .",
    "we find that there are no mergers , and thus no addition of stellar mass due to the major merger process at @xmath215 , for these systems .",
    "we see a slightly different pattern for the lower mass systems with m@xmath79 and m@xmath213 .",
    "figure  6 shows that there is not as much merger activity for the lower mass systems between @xmath89 and @xmath1 .",
    "there is however a similar number , if not more mergers , at lower redshifts .",
    "in fact , most of the merging activity at lower redshift occurs for these lower mass galaxies , consistent with direct mass determinations of galaxies which are merging at @xmath6 ( bundy , ellis & conselice 2005 ) .",
    "we find that massive lyman - break galaxies at @xmath1 will undergo four to six major mergers from @xmath1 until @xmath216 , with most occurring between @xmath217 and @xmath178 .",
    "lower - mass systems have a merger history whereby more mergers occur at lower redshifts , although these systems also gain up to 100 times their initial mass through the merger process .",
    "there are several possible objections to this picture , including the number counts of galaxies at different redshifts , and the observed age of starbursts in @xmath20 galaxies .",
    "the first requires that the co - moving number densities of evolved massive lbgs match the number density of @xmath218 massive systems . since the density of lbgs roughly matches the density of massive spheroids today ( steidel et al .",
    "1996 ) , we can not destroy , or create too many new massive galaxies through mergers",
    ". there must be a balance such that as lbgs effectively disappear through mergers , there must be fainter and lower mass systems to replace them . for the most massive galaxies , this effectively requires in general that the number of massive galaxies ,    @xmath219 @xmath220 @xmath221    remain constant at redshifts @xmath12 , where @xmath182 is small ( @xmath222 ) .",
    "this requires that @xmath22 @xmath223 n@xmath224 ( m@xmath225 @xmath105 ) = @xmath226 @xmath223 n@xmath224 ( m@xmath225 @xmath227 ) at all redshifts , or @xmath22/@xmath226 = n@xmath224 ( m@xmath225 @xmath227 ) / n@xmath224 ( m@xmath225 @xmath105 ) .",
    "the value of @xmath22/@xmath226 @xmath55 5 at @xmath20 , using the 10@xmath228 value for @xmath226 .",
    "this is similar to n@xmath224 ( m@xmath225 @xmath229 ) / n@xmath224 ( m@xmath225 @xmath105 ) at the same redshift .",
    "based on this , it appears that the number densities of the most massive galaxies will remain roughly the same as the observed densities of lbgs , which are similar to the densities of modern massive galaxies .",
    "this result originates from the fact that while there is a higher merger fraction for the more massive galaxies , there are more lower mass galaxies undergoing mergers at all redshifts ( figure  5 ) .",
    "a related issue is the stellar mass to dark matter ratio of lyman - break galaxies .",
    "although this ratio is not know for certain , there are indications that the lyman - break galaxies are associated with the most massive halos of today ( adelberger et al .",
    "1998 ) while stellar masses for the most massive systems are typically around 10@xmath170 . if mergers are the dominate source of the build up of galaxies from lbgs without any star formation , the ratio of stellar to total mass would remain constant .",
    "if the halo masses of lbgs are of order 10@xmath230 , then there must be further star formation to match the ratio of stellar to halo masses of 0.1 found today and even by @xmath38 ( conselice et al . 2005 ) .",
    "although we find that up to 30% of the addition mass is formed in star formation , the majority originates from the existing mass in the mergers .",
    "it is also not certain that lbgs have a stellar to total mass ratio of 0.01 . often , the total masses of @xmath20 galaxies are less than their stellar masses ( shapely et al .",
    "2004 ) , making the total or stellar ( but likely total ) masses suspect .",
    "furthermore , the halo occupation number for lbg halos may be larger than one , such that there are more than one galaxy in a single massive halos .",
    "this indeed seems to be the case based on recent measurements of the lbg correlation function which show that there is an excess at small scales ( lee et al .",
    "2005 ) - possibly the result of ongoing mergers and multiple galaxies in single halos .",
    "another possible objection is that the ages of the stellar populations in lbgs are too old at @xmath20 to be produced in bursts induced by the large number of mergers occurring between @xmath89 and @xmath1 . in other words , the observed ages of some starbursts between @xmath89 and @xmath1",
    "is longer than the elapsed time between @xmath89 and @xmath231 , and thus it would be difficult to have several mergers , and accompanying star formation occur during this time .",
    "papovich et al .",
    "( 2001 ) and shapley et al .",
    "( 2001 ) have found a wide range of stellar population or burst ages for galaxies within this redshifts range .",
    "some of these ages are as old as 1 gyr .",
    "clearly not all lbgs are involved in the multiple mergers discussed here unless these time estimates are incorrect .",
    "there is some evidence for this as the age of the starburst can very by many factors depending on the choice of imf and metallicity ( papovich et al .",
    "2001 ) . however , there are reasons to believe these older bursts are occurring in the lower mass systems ( shapley et al",
    ". 2001 ) which are also the more symmetric systems ( conselice et al .",
    "2003a , c ) .    in general",
    "however , it appears that many of the best fit starburst ages for lbgs are short @xmath232 myrs , particularly when a metallicity of 0.2 solar is used ( papovich et al .",
    "in fact , the systems identified in conselice et al .",
    "( 2003a ) , and in this paper , as mergers have young starburst ages , consistent with interpreting their star formation produced in a recent merger event . this correlation can be seen in figure  8 which plots the ages of the most recent starburst , and the asymmetries of their galaxies , for @xmath20 lbgs ( papovich et al .",
    "the galaxies with high asymmetries , @xmath75 , and thus likely merging ( above the solid line ) , all have young ages , typically less than 50 myrs .",
    "these merging systems also have the highest ongoing star formation rates .",
    "since n - body models show that not all phases of a merger have a high asymmetry , it is possible that the symmetric young age lbgs are in a phase of a merger where they are not asymmetric .      if the merger history at @xmath5 as derived in conselice et al .",
    "( 2003a ) , and used in this paper to calculate the formation history of galaxies holds up with future observations and techniques it has profound implications .",
    "it implies that we have observationally solved how and when most massive galaxies formed .",
    "our results are qualitatively consistent with several other apparently paradoxically results , a number of which have questioned the foundation of the modern theoretical galaxy formation paradigm , cold dark matter .",
    "recently various groups have discovered massive galaxies at redshifts @xmath5 , which has been seen as potentially a problem for cdm based models ( franx et al .",
    "2003 ; daddi et al .",
    "2004 ; somerville et al .",
    "2004 ; glazebrook et al . 2004",
    "nagamine et al .",
    "for example glazebrook et al .",
    "( 2004 ) find that the stellar mass density of massive galaxies , with m@xmath233 , is roughly an order of magnitude larger than expectations based on a semi - analytic cdm model of galaxy formation ( cole et al . 2000 ;",
    "benson et al . 2002 ) , although the agreement with the m@xmath234 models is quite good .",
    "this implies that the most massive galaxies formed earlier than what cdm models predict .",
    "there are two possible solutions to this .",
    "the first , presented in this paper , is that the merger rate , and the fraction of galaxies at high redshift which are merging , is higher than what is predicted in cdm models .",
    "this mismatch with cdm models can be seen through the comparison in figure  1 .",
    "figure  1 shows that this particular cdm model , from semi - analytic galaxy formation modeling ( benson et al .",
    "2002 ) , generally underpredict the merger fraction we observe , as do other semi - analytical model predictions ( somerville et al .",
    "this suggests that the solution to the ` massive galaxies at high redshift problem ' is not a rapid collapse with no mergers , but that there are possibly _ more _ mergers at higher redshift than what semi - analytic cdm models predict .",
    "our results suggest that massive galaxies should be well formed by @xmath7 , which is consistent with observations of galaxy stellar masses ( figure  7 ) .",
    "an alternative scenario is that these studies , are biased by cosmic variance .",
    "it is possible that the glazebrook et al .",
    "( 2004 ) and franx et al .",
    "( 2003 ) studies are examining over dense regions at their particular redshifts .",
    "wider area infrared surveys are clearly needed to make progress in understanding this issue .",
    "an early formation history for massive early - type galaxies explains a number of other observations .",
    "the first is that the morphological distribution of galaxies on the hubble sequence is largely in place by @xmath38 ( conselice et al .",
    "2005 ) , with a similar number density of disk galaxies as today ( ravindranath et al .",
    "another is that the clustering properties of massive galaxies appear to be largely in place by @xmath38 ( coil et al .",
    "2004 ) , as is the size distribution ( ferguson et al . 2004 ) , with galaxy sizes growing between @xmath235 ( bouwens et al .",
    "the metallicities of massive galaxies at @xmath20 are also similar to the most massive galaxies found today , with values of solar or greater ( shapley et al .",
    "2004 ; van dokkum et a. 2004 ) , suggesting that there are not many future generations of massive starbursts .",
    "another observation consistent with a rapid and early merging history for massive galaxies is that the number of metal poor globular clusters around early - types correlates with galaxy luminosity ( strader et al .",
    "2004 ) , implying that their formation occurred at @xmath20 .",
    "this does not however relieve other problems with the hierarchical formation of galaxies , as there are massive systems well formed by @xmath236 in the form of qsos that contain high metallicities ( barth et al .",
    "2003 ) that might also contain massive galaxies .",
    "clearly probing the merging history at @xmath237 will be insightful .",
    "major mergers at @xmath12 also relate to the build up of black holes at similar redshifts .",
    "the peak of the merger rate and merger fraction coincides with the peak of agn and qso activity ( boyle et al . 2000 ) .",
    "thus it seems likely that the build up of black holes and galaxy bulges , which is already present in some form at @xmath38 ( grogin et al .",
    "2005 ) could be driven by the major merger process . as there is little correlation between the presence of merging activity and x - ray flux for lbgs ( lehmer et al . 2005 )",
    ", this implies that there is some delay between the formation of black holes and the merger .",
    "one problem that we have not addressed is the fact that only @xmath55 10 - 20% of all stellar mass is formed by @xmath1 ( dickinson et al .",
    "2003 ; rudnick et al .",
    "2003 ) , and thus there must be , and is , significant star formation at @xmath12 ( giavalisco et al .",
    "2004b ) . since only 10 - 30% of the stars in a massive galaxy form by starbursts induced in major mergers",
    ", there must be other methods of forming new stars at @xmath12 . at lower redshifts",
    "when the merger rate declines , other methods such as dissipation to form disks at @xmath238 , or secular evolution produced by bars which are common at @xmath38 ( jogee et al .",
    "2004 ) , must dominate the stellar mass assembly . since spheroids dominate the stellar mass density of nearby galaxies , containing roughly a third to half of all stars ( tasca & white 2005 ) , it is not likely that all this mass is produced in major mergers .",
    "it appears that the lower mass spheroids are produced through dissipative processes at @xmath6 when they are found to be bluer systems ( stanford et al .",
    "2004 ) , while the higher mass systems , which are generally in denser environments , are produced through major mergers at earlier times .",
    "we have also not discussed the relationship between the sub - mm bright galaxies found at @xmath5 and the systems studied in this paper .",
    "the lyman - break galaxies we examined are much more common at high redshift than sub - mm sources , yet the relationship between sub - mm sources and lyman - break galaxies is still largely unknown .",
    "it is possible that the sub - mm sources are the most massive galaxies at high redshift , as suggested by their clustering properties ( blain et al .",
    "2004 ) . in any case , the morphologies of the limited number of sub - mm sources that have been studied show that these systems are large galaxies that are undergoing major mergers ( conselice et al . 2003c ; chapman et al . 2003",
    "; pope et al . 2005 ) , with preliminary indications that the sub - mm sources are involved in a more active phase of a merger than the most massive lbgs studied in the hubble deep field ( conselice et al .",
    "in the first part of this paper we reduce all known merger fractions to a common scale based on the fraction of _ galaxies _ undergoing a merger at a given redshift , and within a range of stellar mass or luminosity .",
    "we then show that the best fitting function for the galaxy merger fraction history is a combined power / exponential formalism for systems with m@xmath97 and m@xmath99 out to @xmath1 .",
    "for the brightest and most massive systems with m@xmath47 and m@xmath3 out to @xmath1 , and for lower mass and fainter systems out to @xmath38 , a simple power - law is suitable for describing the redshift dependence of the merger fraction .    we then analyze a suite of self - consistent major and minor merger n - body simulations with the cas structural analysis system .",
    "we find that major mergers , defined as having a mass ratio of 1:3 or lower , always produce asymmetric systems , typically for 300 myrs , independent of viewing angle or relative orbital configuration of the pair , with a slight dependence on mass which we account for .",
    "we investigate in detail the structure of a 1:5 merger and find that during the 4 gyr duration of this merger , the asymmetry parameter never becomes high enough to be identified as a merger in the cas system .",
    "we then use this information to derive the galaxy merger rate . from this",
    "we calculate that an average massive galaxy , with m@xmath3 , undergoes 4.4@xmath4 major mergers using our derived merger time - scale that slightly depends on mass ( eq .",
    "nearly all of this merging occurs by @xmath7 , after which an average massive galaxy experiences no further major mergers .",
    "we then calculate how galaxies of various initial masses at @xmath1 formed through major mergers .",
    "our conclusion is that mass accreted during the major merger process , and the stars created from star formation induced by these mergers , is such that when these systems evolve to @xmath2 they will be as massive as the most galaxies in the modern universe .",
    "we calculate that a typical galaxy increases in mass by a factor of @xmath239 from this process .",
    "our calculations are based on empirically determined merger fractions and rates from conselice et al .",
    "( 2003a ) and include star formation scenarios based on observations of star formation histories of lyman - break galaxies .",
    "we calculate that 10 - 30% of the new stellar mass is formed in starbursts induced by these mergers , and the remainder comes from the merger itself .",
    "the merger scenario described in this paper naturally explains observations of massive and extremely red galaxies at @xmath5 , the distributions of modern elliptical galaxy ages and metallicities , among many other massive galaxy properties .",
    "future results will expand our conclusions using better models and deeper hst observations .",
    "wider area and deep infrared surveys at high resolution , either with wfc3 on hst , with jwst , and/or with ground based adaptive optics , are needed to determine with certainty the merger rate at high redshift .",

    "<S> we present the results of a series of empirical computations regarding the role of major mergers in forming the stellar masses of modern galaxies . </S>",

    "<S> we re - construct the merger history of normal field galaxies from @xmath1 to @xmath2 as a function of initial stellar mass using published pair fractions and merger fractions from structural analyses . </S>",
    "<S> we calibrate the observed merger time - scale and mass ratios for galaxy mergers using self - consistent n - body models of mergers , composed of dark matter and stars , with mass ratios from 1:1 to 1:5 with various orbital properties and viewing angles . </S>",
    "<S> we use these simulations to determine the time - scales and mass ratios that produce structures that would be identified as major mergers . based on these calculations </S>",
    "<S> we argue that a typical massive galaxy at @xmath1 with m@xmath3 undergoes 4.4@xmath4 major mergers at @xmath5 , with no further mergers at @xmath6 .. we find that by @xmath7 the stellar mass of an average massive galaxy is relatively established , a scenario qualitatively favored in a @xmath8 dominated universe , and independently suggested through stellar population analyses . through empirical measurements of the star formation induced in these mergers , and using assumptions concerning the star formation history , </S>",
    "<S> we argue that the final stellar masses of these systems increases by as much as a factor of @xmath9 allowing lyman - break galaxies , which tend to have low stellar masses , to become the most massive galaxies in today s universe with m @xmath10 m@xmath11 . induced star formation accounts for 10 - 30% of the stellar mass formed in these galaxies at @xmath12 . </S>",
    "<S> a comparison to semi - analytic models of galaxy formation shows that cold dark matter ( cdm ) models consistently under - predict the merger fraction , and rate of merging , of massive galaxies at high redshift . </S>",
    "<S> this suggests that massive galaxy formation occurs through more merging than predicted in cdm models , rather than a rapid early collapse . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we argue that rapid and early merging as the formation mechanisms of massive galaxies naturally explains many previously paradoxical properties of elliptical / massive galaxies . </S>"
