    "if we apply a time - dependent external field to a black hole , what occurs in the black hole ? according to the membrane paradigm @xcite , the response of the black hole can be represented by the degrees of freedom on the stretched horizon .",
    "it is expected that these degrees of freedom carry information on the interior of the black hole .",
    "this is suggested by two guiding principles of quantum gravity : the holographic principle ( which states that the entropy in a spatial region is bounded by the area ) and the black hole complementarity ( which states that there is a consistent theory in the frame of an observer outside the horizon ) .",
    "it has long been known that matter on the stretched horizon obeys hydrodynamic laws in the long wavelength limit  @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "it was pointed out that a localized perturbation spreads over the entire horizon in a time logarithmic in the bekenstein - hawking entropy .",
    "this time scale , which is different from the ones in local quantum field theories , plays a crucial role in forbidding a possible violation of the no - cloning theorem of quantum state  @xcite .",
    "these properties have been derived from classical general relativity .",
    "to understand what the degrees of freedom on the stretched horizon are , and how they thermalize , we will need a fundamental theory , such as string theory .    in string theory ,",
    "the bekenstein - hawking entropy and the hawking emission rate of some specific black holes have been correctly reproduced by d - brane systems  @xcite .",
    "it is likely that d - branes provide microscopic descriptions for more general black holes , but there are few quantitative results .",
    "recently , it has been found that transport coefficients in the membrane paradigm agree with those of a highly excited fundamental string at the correspondence point , up to numerical coefficients @xcite .",
    "this can be regarded as a support for string theory as a microscopic description of the stretched horizon , in spite of a few limitations .",
    "first , the black hole is realized when the string coupling is larger than the value at the correspondence point @xcite . in this situation",
    ", one can no longer neglect the excitations of d - branes because the masses of the d - branes are proportional to the inverse of the string coupling @xcite .",
    "in addition , the authors of @xcite have considered only homogeneous perturbations to obtain the transport coefficients of the fundamental string . to study dynamical processes such as diffusion",
    ", one has to apply inhomogeneous perturbations to the system .",
    "according to ads / cft correspondence or matrix theory , string theory can be defined nonperturbatively by supersymmetric yang - mills theories .",
    "these gauge theories should allow us to study the dynamics on the stretched horizon from the first principles , even though it is difficult to solve these theories .",
    "in fact , there have been extensive studies of hydrodynamic properties of strongly coupled gauge theories from gravity calculations using ads / cft correspondence ( or gauge / gravity correspondence , more generally ) , following the work of policastro _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite . in these studies , transport coefficients of gauge theories",
    "have been obtained by studying fluctuations around black brane backgrounds which have momentum along the brane , in the limit of small momentum .",
    "the computations of gauge / gravity correspondence are closely related to those in the old membrane paradigm  @xcite .    in spite of this development",
    ", it is not clear how the transport phenomena in the directions which surround a black hole ( or a black brane ; the @xmath3 direction in the case of d3-branes ) are represented in gauge theories",
    ". this question should be important in the understanding of black holes in the real world , since there are no directions along the brane in this case .",
    "also , answers to this question may shed light on how the space emerges from lower dimensional theories .",
    "let us consider the case of d0-branes for definiteness .",
    "there are no spatial directions along the brane , and the d0-brane black hole is surrounded by @xmath0 .",
    "the low - energy description of d0-branes is given by maximally supersymmetric ( 0 + 1 ) dimensional yang - mills theory with @xmath4 gauge symmetry .",
    "this theory is called matrix theory , and has been proposed to be a description of m theory in a particular large @xmath5 limit  @xcite .",
    "black holes should correspond to dynamically realized spherically symmetric configurations of matrix - valued scalar fields .",
    "fluctuations on the stretched horizon should correspond to fluctuations around such a configuration .",
    "it is not clear how these fluctuations propagate , and it is not even clear if they can be effectively described by a local field theory on @xmath0 .",
    "an important clue is that one knows how the matrices couple to background fields .",
    "kabat and taylor  @xcite and taylor and van raamsdonk  @xcite studied one - loop effective potential in matrix theory and found that certain single - trace operators couple to supergravity backgrounds .",
    "these operators have definite so(9 ) r - charges , meaning that they are in the momentum representation on @xmath0 .",
    "one should be able to find linear responses of matrix theory to external perturbations by computing correlation functions of these operators .",
    "in this paper , we will study transport phenomena along @xmath0 in matrix theory by using gauge / gravity correspondence .",
    "our aim is to clarify what kind of behavior one should expect from the dynamics of matrices . in particular , we wish to understand to what extent the theory behaves as in field theory on @xmath0 .",
    "gauge / gravity correspondence for d0-branes was proposed in @xcite .",
    "correlation functions at zero temperature have been found  @xcite by applying the gubser - klebanov - polyakov - witten(gkpw )  @xcite prescription to the near - horizon d0-brane background .",
    "it was found that the zero - temperature correlators for operators which couple to supergravity modes obey power law , even though the theory is not conformally invariant .",
    "these results have been confirmed by monte carlo simulations of matrix theory  @xcite .    in this paper , we follow the standard procedure for studying the hydrodynamic limit in gauge / gravity correspondence .",
    "we will use the real - time prescription proposed by @xcite .",
    "we evaluate the on - shell action on the near - extremal d0-brane background and obtain correlation functions following the gkpw prescription .",
    "we make a series expansion in the frequency and study the low frequency limit .",
    "we will study the tensor and vector modes and find shear viscosity and diffusion poles for the stress tensor and ramond - ramond ( r - r ) 1-form current .",
    "the scalar modes are deferred to future work .",
    "one should note that the types of operators that we consider are different from the ones familiar in the holographic study of hydrodynamics .",
    "the stress - energy tensor on @xmath0 is represented by scalar operators from the perspective of gauge theory on ( 0 + 1 ) dimension .",
    "modes with different momentum on @xmath0 are represented by different operators . unlike stress - energy tensors in conformal field theories ,",
    "these operators are not marginal operator , and will have nontrivial wave function renormalization .",
    "we follow the interpretation in @xcite and assume that the position @xmath6 of the regulated boundary ( or the `` cutoff surface '' ) , on which the on - shell action is evaluated , sets the scale of renormalization .",
    "we assume that the normalization of the operators is fixed at that scale .",
    "since the gauge theory has only time , the renormalization scale refers to the scale of time separation .",
    "we will consider the two cases : when the cutoff surface is near the horizon and when it is near infinity . in the former case",
    ", we obtain the results which can be interpreted as conventional hydrodynamics .",
    "this is the limit where the operators are defined at an infrared scale .",
    "however , in the latter case , we observe that the theory behaves differently from the usual fluid .",
    "this is the limit where the operators are defined at some ultraviolet scale , so that the operators could be sensitive to the short - time behavior of the theory .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec :",
    "hydro ] , we review hydrodynamic equations for a charged fluid on @xmath0 .",
    "we consider the tensor and vector modes , and we find the expressions for the stress tensor and current in the presence of external perturbations . in section 3 , after briefly reviewing matrix theory and gauge / gravity correspondence at zero temperature , we describe gauge / gravity correspondence at finite temperature on which our analysis is based . in section [ sec : linearresponse ] , we calculate the linear responses of the stress tensor and r - r 1-form current of matrix theory by using the gauge / gravity correspondence . in section [ sec : tensor ] and [ sec : vector ] , we calculate the on - shell action for the tensor and vector modes , respectively , at arbitrary @xmath7 . in section [ sec :",
    "uc1 ] , we study transport coefficients when the cutoff surface is near the horizon . from the tensor mode , we find that the linear response of the stress tensor takes the form of the hydrodynamic stress tensor on @xmath0 , and that the shear viscosity to entropy density ratio is equal to @xmath8 . from the vector modes , we find that the linear responses of the stress tensor and r - r 1-form current take forms similar to the hydrodynamic stress tensor and current on @xmath0 . by taking a rindler limit ,",
    "the linear responses become the hydrodynamic stress tensor and current on @xmath9 , which is consistent with previous work on a rindler fluid  @xcite . in section [ sec :",
    "uc0 ] , we consider the case in which the cutoff surface is far from the horizon .",
    "we find that both the tensor mode and vector modes do not follow the hydrodynamics .",
    "especially , there is no diffusion pole in the vector modes in the low frequency region , which indicates that the linear responses of the d0-branes can not be explained by hydrodynamics .",
    "the final section is devoted to the summary and comments . in appendix",
    "[ sec : harmonics ] , we briefly summarize the definitions and properties of the spherical harmonics on @xmath0 . in appendix",
    "[ sec : on - shell ] , we derive the on - shell action of the tensor mode and vector modes .",
    "in this section , we review a charged fluid on 9-dimensional spacetime whose spatial part is @xmath0 .",
    "we introduce external perturbations of the metric @xmath10 and gauge field @xmath11 and consider the linear response @xcite .",
    "the background metric and gauge field are given by @xmath12 where the indices @xmath13 run from @xmath14 to @xmath15 , and @xmath16 is the metric on @xmath0 with radius @xmath17 .",
    "we introduced the chemical potential @xmath18 as the constant mode of @xmath19 , and @xmath20 is its background part .",

    "the coefficients of second order parts , @xmath29 , and @xmath30 , are the shear viscosity , bulk viscosity , and conductivity , respectively .",
    "the normalization condition of the velocity field @xmath31 is given by @xmath32 .",
    "now , we introduce perturbations for the metric and gauge field , and then consider the response of the fluid at the linear order of perturbations . by expanding them in terms of spherical harmonics on @xmath0",
    ", they can be classified into the tensor , vector , and scalar modes which are associated to the tensor , vector , and scalar harmonics , respectively .",
    "we consider the tensor mode and vector modes and introduce no perturbation for the scalar mode .",
    "then , the scalar quantities such as @xmath24 , @xmath25 , and @xmath26 have no response and remain constant . since in this case",
    ", the velocity field satisfies the incompressible condition @xmath33 , the constitutive relations are simplified as @xmath34 where @xmath35 , and @xmath36 denote the energy density , pressure , and charge density in equilibrium , respectively .",
    "we apply the following external perturbations to the fluid in equilibrium : @xmath37 where @xmath38 here , @xmath39 and @xmath40 are the vector harmonics and tensor harmonics on @xmath0 , respectively .",
    "the tensor mode is @xmath41 and the vector modes are @xmath42 and @xmath43 .",
    "hereafter , we often suppress the angular momentum index @xmath44 and the sum in the spherical harmonic expansions .",
    "the definitions and properties of the spherical harmonics are summarized in appendix [ sec : harmonics ] .    under the perturbations ,",
    "the velocity field changes as @xmath45 where @xmath46 is the velocity field in the equilibrium and the linear responses can be expanded by the spherical harmonics : @xmath47 since @xmath48 behaves as a scalar on @xmath0 , it does not change in this case .",
    "note that @xmath49 .",
