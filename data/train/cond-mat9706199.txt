    "the recent observation of superconductivity in sr@xmath0ruo@xmath1 has attracted much attention because of the close structural similarity with some of the high - temperature superconductors@xcite .",
    "the critical temperature , @xmath2k , is , however , rather low .",
    "in fact there is little similarity between sr@xmath0ruo@xmath1 and high - temperature superconductors beyond the crystal structure . in strong contrast to",
    "the cuo@xmath0-systems sr@xmath0ruo@xmath1 is a good metal as a stoichiometric compound , displaying clear fermi liquid properties .",
    "all three @xmath3-d - orbitals of ru@xmath4 ( @xmath5 ) yield bands which cross the fermi energy and lead to two electron - like and one hole - like fermi surfaces observed in the beautiful de haas - van alphen experiments of mackenzie et al.@xcite .",
    "the layered structure of the system leads to a comparatively small dispersion of the bands along the c - axis that is reflected in the highly anisotropic resistivity .",
    "therefore we find an essentially two - dimensional electron system and the nearly cylindrical fermi surfaces are open along the c - axis .",
    "there are various indications for strong correlation effects . among others",
    "the indication of a considerable mass enhancement , @xmath6 , has been found@xcite , which causes an enhanced linear specific heat coefficient @xmath7 . also the pauli spin susceptibility is enhanced .",
    "sr@xmath0ruo@xmath1 is a member of a homologous series of compounds , sr@xmath8ru@xmath9o@xmath10 , where @xmath11 is the number of ruo@xmath0-layers per unit cell .",
    "the single layer compound sr@xmath0ruo@xmath1 seems to have unique properties among the members investigated so far .",
    "both the compound with @xmath12 ( double layer ) and @xmath13 ( infinite layer ) are itinerant ferromagnets .",
    "this suggests that also in the single layer compound ferromagnetic spin fluctuations should be very important , again in contrast to the cuo@xmath0-compounds where antiferromagnetic spin fluctuations are dominant .",
    "the presence of strong correlation effects implies that it is difficult for electrons to form cooper pairs in the usual s - wave channel .",
    "thus a higher relative angular momentum would be more favorable .",
    "there are also interesting similarities with @xmath14he which led to the suggestion that cooper pairing in the spin triplet ( odd - parity ) configuration might be favored@xcite . clearly also the presence of strong ferromagnetic spin fluctuations and the hund s rule coupling of the d - orbitals on the ru - anion point into the same direction .    at present",
    ", there is no unambiguous experimental indication for triplet pairing . nevertheless , there is strong evidence for unconventional superconductivity .",
    "the superconducting state is extremely sensitive to disorder .",
    "only very clean samples show superconductivity and a small concentration of non - magnetic impurities ( al ) suppresses the transition temperature to zero .",
    "the nuclear quadrupolar relaxation ( nqr ) deviates from that of conventional superconductors@xcite .",
    "it does not have any sign of a hebel - slichter peak and shows a low temperature korringa - like behavior .",
    "furthermore , the specific heat data indicate a large residual density of states in the superconducting phase whith a linear-@xmath15 coefficient @xmath16 with about half of the normal state value even in the purest samples@xcite consistent with nqr .",
    "the number of possible spin triplet cooper pairing states is large and the question arises whether any of those states could explain the presence of the large residual density of states .",
    "one proposal was a non - unitary state which can only occur for spin triplet pairing@xcite .",
    "for such a state the quasiparticle excitation spectrum consists of two branches , one of which could be gapless leading to finite density of states at zero energy which is half the normal state value .",
    "the nature of this state is very similar to the @xmath17-phase of superfluid @xmath14he which is stabilized in a magnetic field .",
    "it is still an open problem whether there is a mechanism that could give rise to such a state in zero external magnetic field .",
    "an alternative explanation which avoids this difficulty was recently proposed by agterberg et al.@xcite based on the fact that there are three distinct fermi surface sheets . for symmetry reasons two sheets are nearly decoupled from the third one for cooper pair scattering . therefore the superconducting gap would have different values on different sheets .",
    "this leaves space for rather low - lying quasiparticle excitations on certain fermi surfaces which would appear as residual density of states in the specific heat measurement .",
    "there is no clear experimental distinction between the two proposals so far .",
    "there is good experimental evidence that also the heavy fermion superconductor upt@xmath18 has spin - triplet pairing ( @xmath19k ) @xcite . in this case",
    "two distinct superconducting phases , a low- and a high - temperature phase , occur .",
    "the low - temperature phase has presumably broken time reversal symmetry and may also have a non - unitary state @xcite .",
    "the discussion we do here for sr@xmath0ruo@xmath1 may also apply to this compound to some extent .",
    "in this paper we investigate the quasiparticle tunneling from a normal metal to the spin triplet superconductor ( ns ) for both the unitary and non - unitary pairing state .",
    "this type of problem was first analyzed by bruder many years ago @xcite .",
    "we would like to focus here on the interesting aspect of broken time reversal symmetry in the non - unitary state .",
    "this property influences the presence of so - called andreev bound states at the ns interface .",
    "we will show that the energy of the bound states depends on the angle of the incident quasiparticle ( hole ) which is a direct consequence of the polarized internal angular momentum of the non - unitary state .",
    "these bound states appear as anomalies in the current - voltage ( iv ) characteristics of the interface . in general , measurements of the iv - characteristics include an average over a wide range of incidence angles .",
    "we will show , however , that it is possible to introduce a certain selection of angles by the method of magnetic focusing previously used for the study of the andreev effect in conventional superconductors @xcite .",
    "for spin - triplet superconducting states the cooper pairs possess a spin-1 degree of freedom .",
    "this state is described by a gap function which is , in general , a @xmath20-matrix in spin space and can be parameterized by a vector function @xmath21 @xmath22 which is odd in @xmath23 @xcite .",
    "the energy spectrum of the superconducting quasiparticles is given by    @xmath24    where the vector @xmath25 .",
    "@xmath26 is the band energy measured with respect to the chemical potential .",
    "it is @xmath27 which distinguishes between two classes of spin - triplet pairing states , the unitary and non - unitary state . if @xmath28 the state is unitary and the two branches @xmath29 are identical . on the other hand , for @xmath30 the state",
    "is called non - unitary .",
    "it has two distinct quasiparticle energy spectra and breaks time - reversal symmetry .    for simplicity we will restrict ourselves to the case of a single cylindrical symmetrical fermi surface and analyze an example of both types of spin - triplet pairing states .",
    "these states result from a classification of pairing states including spin - orbit coupling and crystal field effects @xcite .",
    "the example for the non - unitary state has the form    @xmath31    or @xmath32 in this state , the cooper pairs have @xmath33 and @xmath34 @xcite .",
    "it is degenerate to a similar state with opposite orientation of spin and angular momenta .",
    "the essential feature of the two states is that the energy gap for one spin projection of quasiparticles ( spin - up for ( [ sz ] ) , @xmath35-branch ) has a constant magnitude , while it vanishes for the branch @xmath36 on the whole fermi surface as can be seen immediately by inserting ( [ sz ] ) into ( [ spectrum ] ) .",
    "as mentioned above these gapless quasiparticles could account for the large residual density of states .",
    "we consider the analogue of the balian - werthamer ( bw ) state@xcite as an example for a unitary state , @xmath37 note that in two dimensions this is an equal spin pairing state and has a gap with constant modulus for both spins on the cylindrical fermi surface .",
    "this state is stable in the weak coupling approach and could be the basis for the scenario of orbital dependent superconductivity @xcite .",
    "in this section we analyze the properties of the normal - metal - superconductor ( ns ) interface for the two types of pairing states ( [ sz ] ) and ( [ bw2 ] ) .",
    "we apply the formulation by blonder , tinkham and klapwijk ( btk)@xcite for ns interfaces .",
    "this allows us to derive expressions for the reflection probabilities of electrons .",
    "the geometry of our problem contains the following restrictions .",
    "the particles move in the @xmath38-plane and the boundary between normal metal ( @xmath39 ) and superconductor ( @xmath40 ) is the @xmath41-plane located at @xmath42",
    ". we will use a step function for the spatial dependence of the gap magnitude , @xmath43 .",
    "the surface potential will be taken as a delta potential @xmath44 . then following btk @xcite the amplitudes for quasiparticle ( andreev- ) reflection and transmission",
    "can be calculated using the appropriate boundary conditions for the wave functions @xmath45 on the normal and @xmath46 on the superconducting side of the ns interface . since for triplet superconductors we have to take care of the spin structure of the gap function , the quasiparticle wave functions are four - spinors in nambu ( particle - hole @xmath47 spin ) space",
    "their particle and hole components are determined by the solutions of the bogoliubov - degennes equations @xcite , i.e. the diagonalization of the corresponding bcs mean field hamiltonian @xmath48 here @xmath49 and @xmath50 are matrices in spin-@xmath51 space , the bogoliubov quasiparticle operators in the superconductor are then given by @xmath52 for equal - spin pairing ( esp ) states ( ( [ sz ] ) or ( [ bw2 ] ) ) , the spin - up and spin - down components decouple , therefore we obtain two - spinors with one electron and one hole component . for triplet states ,",
    "the andreev hole is a missing electron of the same spin projection as the incoming particle .",
    "following btk @xcite , we denote the amplitude for andreev reflection by @xmath53 and for normal reflection by @xmath54 .",
    "moreover we introduce the amplitudes @xmath55 for transmission into the superconductor as a bogoliubov quasiparticle on the same branch of the spectrum and @xmath56 for transmission with backscattering through the fermi surface , i.e. reverting the momentum @xmath57 component .",
    "the momenta involved into the reflection processes are shown in fig.[gapvec ] .",

    "we have @xmath68 while for the spin - down channel of the unitary state @xmath69 . for time - reversal conserving singlet states @xmath70 can be taken real and , in particular , for @xmath71-wave pairing with @xmath72 we recover the btk results .    using the boundary conditions we obtain the following expressions for @xmath53 and @xmath54 : @xmath73 with @xmath74 @xmath75 measures the barrier strength .",

    "incoming holes ( subscript @xmath77 ) with the same excitation energy @xmath78 and group velocity in the same direction @xmath61 have momenta opposite to those of incoming electrons . performing the appropriate substitutions in ( [ wf ] )",
    "we obtain @xmath79 for the states ( [ sz ] ) and([bw2 ] ) and the given geometry the gap function seen by the holes is the complex conjugate of that seen by the electrons under the same angle , i.e. cooper pairs with reversed angular momentum along the @xmath80 axis .",
    "in fig.[ab ] we show results of andreev and normal reflection probabilities for various angles of incidence and two barrier strengths , @xmath81 and @xmath82 .",
    "these curves correspond to the gapped channel ( in our convention the incoming spin - up quasiparticles ) of the non - unitary state ( [ sz ] ) . for incoming spin - down particles ,",
    "the superconducting gap is zero , therefore we obtain n - n junction results , which are not shown here .    for the unitary state ( [ bw2 ] )",
    "both spin orientations have a gapped spectrum and there is a simple relation between spin - up and -down component . for the spin - down electrons the behavior for given angle of incidence @xmath61",
    "are those of the spin - up electrons with @xmath83 , because of the reversed angular momentum of the spin - down cooper pairs ( @xmath84 or @xmath85 ) .",
    "the angle - independent gap magnitude sets the energy scale for the reflection amplitudes , but their behavior is also determined by the phase factors @xmath86 occurring in the denominator of ( [ ra2 ] ) .",
    "the latter give rise to interesting properties .      if we consider the triplet states ( [ sz ] ) , ( [ bw2 ] ) and incoming particles of one spin projection ( say spin - up ) @xmath88 as a consequence the andreev and normal reflection amplitudes ( [ ra2 ] ) are _ asymmetric _ with respect to the boundary normal .",

    "similar asymmetries have been discussed for @xmath89 superconducting gaps by matsumoto and shiba@xcite .",

    "the corresponding peaks in the andreev reflection probability become sharper with increasing @xmath93 , their width decreases @xmath99 . at the resonance condition ( [ bsc ] ) , the transmitted wave in the superconductor is a superposition of a surface bound state ( note that this expression is only sensible for @xmath100 ) formed by repeated andreev and normal reflection ( see fig.[bsfig ] , consider the limit @xmath101 ) and a @xmath55-type @xmath102 quasiparticle , which carries the charge @xmath103 into the superconductor . both parts of the transmitted wave decay on a length scale @xmath104 .",
    "the condition @xmath105 is equivalent to a vanishing bound state wave function at the barrier at @xmath42 . in the quasi - classical picture of fig.[bsfig ]",
    "the bound state is formed if the phases accumulated by the electron and hole components of the two - spinors during one round trip through the normal layer sum up to an integer multiple of @xmath106 .",
    "since the phase shifts for the andreev reflections are angle - dependent , the resonance energies also vary with @xmath61 .    in the non - unitary state ( [ sz ] )",
    "@xmath96 vanishes for @xmath107 , i.e. negative angles of incidence .",
    "this leads to resonances in the andreev amplitude , @xmath108 , at negative angles of incidence .",
    "note that the bound state has a non - vanishing angular momentum along the @xmath80 axis , therefore its asymmetric position at negative @xmath61 can be understood as a consequence of the finite relative angular momentum of the cooper pairs in non - unitary states .",
    "this is in agreement with the fact that according to ( [ eh ] ) for injected holes the resonance peaks in the andreev amplitude change side , i.e. they occur at positive angles of incidence . since its angular momentum @xmath109",
    "is fixed by the gap function , the bound state is only accessible for electrons with angle of incidence @xmath61 and holes with angle of incidence @xmath83 . in the spin down channel of the unitary state ( [ bw2 ] ) the analogous bound state with opposite @xmath109 does exist , therefore the resonances occur symmetrically if we assume unpolarized incoming particles .",
    "the bound state condition @xmath110 is essentially equivalent to the equations recently given by hu @xcite and tanaka et al .",
    "@xcite for @xmath56-wave and other singlet superconductors .",
    "they report zero energy states for certain orientations of the boundary with respect to the pair wave function .",
    "this is in contrast to the triplet states ( [ sz ] ) and ( [ bw2 ] ) where the sub - gap resonances are not sensitive to the boundary orientation in the plane .",
    "the charge current through the ns boundary by an incoming electron is increased by an andreev hole with probability @xmath111 and diminished by normal reflection with probability @xmath112 .",
    "therefore at @xmath113k for the non - unitary state ( [ sz ] ) and applied voltage @xmath114 such that we have incoming electrons from the n side , the conductance of the gapped spin - up channel is given by@xcite @xmath115 here , the reflection amplitudes have to be evaluated at energy @xmath116 and at the angle of incidence in the plane @xmath117 , @xmath118 and @xmath119 denote the spin - up density of states and group velocity on the n side at transverse momentum @xmath120 parallel to the boundary , over which we average with probability distribution @xmath121 .",
    "the latter depends on the type of experiment one is interested in . for the non - unitary state ( [ sz ] )",
    "the spin - down conductance is equal to the normal state conductance .    for @xmath71-wave superconducting states ( all @xmath90 s @xmath122 ) ,",
    "the andreev amplitude is largest at @xmath123 .",
    "therefore the conductance @xmath124 is also peaked at gap energy and resembles the bulk density of states for low transparency boundaries .",
    "this so called gap - like feature is entirely absent for the triplet states ( [ sz ] ) and ( [ bw2 ] ) . due to the bound states at @xmath125 ,",
    "the andreev amplitude for small angles of incidence is largest around @xmath126 .",
    "this leads to zero - bias conductance peaks ( zbcp ) which become increasingly pronounced when the junction favors smaller angles of incidence . as explained above for the two - dimensional triplet states ( [ sz ] ) and ( [ bw2 ] ) these zbcps do not depend on the boundary orientation .",
    "therefore they should provide reliable evidence whether a nodeless triplet state with @xmath127 is realized in sr@xmath0ruo@xmath1 .",
    "yamashiro and tanaka @xcite have also reported that zbcps should occur for ( 100 ) ns boundaries with the non - unitary superconducting triplet states ( [ sz ] ) and @xmath128 , which has nodes at @xmath129 and @xmath130 and two lobes with different signs of @xmath131 in between . by looking at the phase structure of the latter gap function",
    ", we expect the zbcp to be strongest for a ( 110 ) boundary ( one of the two lobes is directed towards the interface which implies zero - energy resonances for all angles of incidence ) and a smeared - out gap - like feature and no zbcp for ( @xmath13210 ) boundaries ( lobes parallel to the interface , no sub - gap resonances ) .",
    "thus such states should be experimentally distinguishable from the nodeless states ( [ sz ] ) and ( [ bw2 ] ) .",
    "the interplay between asymmetries and bound states can be utilized in an experiment in order to distinguish between the unitary and non - unitary states proposed for sr@xmath0ruo@xmath1 .",
    "a feasible way for such an experiment is two - point spectroscopy described by benistant et al.@xcite . here",
    ", one injects unpolarized electron - like quasiparticles through a point contact into a normal conductor of thickness @xmath56 attached to the superconductor with a certain distribution @xmath133 of the injection angle @xmath134 . both the electrons and the andreev reflected holes are deflected by a magnetic field applied parallel to the @xmath80-axis .",
    "the holes are now collected by a second point contact .",
    "obviously , experiments of this kind require a normal conducting crystal of high quality where quasiparticles move ballistically .",
    "suppose we have many hole - collectors along the transverse direction of the field , i.e. we are able to measure the intensity of andreev holes arriving at the surface of the normal conductor as a function of the transverse coordinate @xmath135 .",
    "if the probability for andreev reflection is angle - independent , e.g. for a conventional @xmath71-wave superconductor , one obtains a hole distribution which is peaked at a minimal distance @xmath136 from the injection point at @xmath137 .",
    "this feature is known under the name  electron focusing ",
    "( ef)@xcite .",
    "the intensity peak at @xmath136 can be also seen in fig.[pa ] in the density of the hole trajectories arriving at the surface .",
    "it should be noted that for the focusing to work any voltage drop should take place at the point contacts only , otherwise the motion of the particles would be influenced by inhomogeneous electric fields inside the normal metal . for voltages",
    "@xmath138 comparable to @xmath139 the quasiparticle trajectories are independent of the voltage drop , because in this case the velocity deviation from @xmath140 is negligible .    for a non-@xmath71-wave superconducting state , we have to take care of the angular dependent andreev reflection probability .",
    "this additional factor results for the triplet states ( [ sz ] ) and ( [ bw2 ] ) in a modification of the collected intensities due to the resonance peaks , particularly for higher barrier strengths @xmath93 , where the andreev reflectivity is low for energies away from the resonances . in the presence of a magnetic field screening currents lead in general to a change in the resonance energy@xcite due to a shift in the quasiparticle spectrum by@xcite @xmath141 , where @xmath142 is the superfluid velocity .",
    "since both transmitted quasiparticles responsible for the bound state formation have the same transverse momentum ( see fig.[gapvec ] ) and the bound state energies have the same angular dependence @xmath143 as the energy shift , this only leads to a renormalization of the energy scale and the qualitative picture drawn here remains valid .",
    "if the weight of the quasiparticles which satisfy the resonance condition ( [ bsc ] ) is sufficiently high , they give rise to a broader second peak ( besides the focusing peak ) in the  count rate  at a different collector position ( see fig.[pa ] at @xmath144 ) .",
    "the magnetic field leads to an asymmetric distribution of angles of incidence at the ns boundary .",
    "for the non - unitary state ( [ sz ] ) the resonances occur only for negative angles of incidence ( e.g. at @xmath145 in fig.[pa ] ) , for which the corresponding electron paths have small injection angles @xmath134 .    ) for resonances at negative angle of incidence ( @xmath145 , solid line ) and resonances at positive @xmath61 ( dotted line ) .",

    "the injected holes and andreev reflected electrons follow the same paths as the electrons and reflected holes did before the voltage reversal . but",
    "according to ( [ eh ] ) the holes face a gap potential with reversed angle of incidence @xmath145 , which makes the resonance peaks change sides for the non - unitary state ( [ sz ] ) ( of course the sign of the detected voltage is also reversed ) .",
    "now the paths corresponding to the resonance peaks at @xmath61 have large angle of incidence @xmath147 ( see fig.[pa ] ) .",
    "if the angular probability distribution @xmath148 of the injected particles is peaked at small injection angles this will lead to observable changes in the  count rate  of andreev particles . in fig.[cs ] we show the count rates versus collector position for a non - unitary superconducting state ( [ sz ] ) and two different energies of the injected particles .",

    "recent investigations on high - temperature superconductors suggest that a state with locally broken time reversal symmetry could appear for certain orientations of the interface .",
    "this state , the so - called @xmath164-wave state , would lead to a splitting of the zero - bias anomaly seen in the pure @xmath56-wave state for such an interface@xcite .",
    "this more simple probe does not apply in our case where for both triplet states ( 3 ) and ( 5 ) there is no significant qualitative difference in the i - v characteristics .",
    "an additional interesting aspect of the non - unitary states is that one spin orientation generates an excess current in the ns - interface while the other one does not .",
    "therefore , the quasiparticle current of such an ns - interface transports not only charge but also spin . in this context , however , the spin - orbit coupling of sr@xmath165ruo@xmath1 plays an important role in determining the spin polarization direction .",

    "<S> the quasiparticle reflection and transmission properties at normal conductor - superconductor interfaces are discussed for unitary and non - unitary spin triplet pairing states recently proposed for sr@xmath0ruo@xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> we find resonance peaks in the andreev reflection amplitude , which are related to surface bound states in the superconductor . </S>",
    "<S> they lead to conductance peak features below the quasiparticle gap in the superconductor . </S>",
    "<S> the position of the peaks depends on the angle of the incident quasiparticles in a different way for unitary and non - unitary states . </S>",
    "<S> based on this observation we propose a possible experiment which allows to distinguish between the two kinds of superconducting states . </S>"
