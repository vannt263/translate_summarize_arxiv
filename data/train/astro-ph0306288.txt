    "giga - hertz peaked ( gps ) and compact steep spectrum ( css ) sources are major classes of radio sources that may be offering glimpses of the early stages of radio source formation .",
    "they could well offer insight into the physical processes triggering activity in galactic nuclei and so into the causes of quasar evolution .",
    "although these sources are now receiving considerable attention in the radio band , they remain neglected at other wavelengths .    during the last two decades",
    "there has been _ no _ systematic x - ray study of gps / css sources and only a few x - ray observations have been performed . odea ( 1998 ) lists 31 sources with available x - ray information , including 7 sources with upper limits only .",
    "this sample shows , as expected , that galaxies are less luminous in x - rays than quasars .",
    "elvis et al ( 1994 ) observed x - ray absorption in two out of three high redshift gps quasars , suggesting that their environment might be different from other quasars .",
    "rosat upper limits for a few gps / css galaxies of l@xmath4 ergs  s@xmath5 are consistent with the x - ray emission expected from poor clusters or early type galaxies . odea",
    "et al ( 2000 ) presented the first x - ray detection of a gps galaxy , which had l@xmath6 ergs  s@xmath5 with asca .",
    "the highest spatial resolution observations before _",
    "chandra _ were made with the rosat hri in which 2 out of 4 gps quasars showed traces of an extended emission ( antonelli & fiore 1997 ) .",
    "the lack of available x - ray information is surprising , since strong x - ray emission is expected to be associated with strong radio power and could in principle help in understanding the emission processes and dynamics related to radio - emitting structures .",
    "is the x - ray emission directly connected to the expanding jet ?",
    "x - ray emission associated with a local halo or cluster ( t@xmath7 10@xmath8k ) could help in studying the environment of the gps / css sources . we should be able to look for the remnants of a merger event or any signatures of interactions between an expanding radio plasma and the igm .",
    "x - ray spectra can constrain the total absorbing column , so we may be able to check whether there is sufficient material to confine the gps source .",
    "x - rays can also help to understand any link between gps and large scale radio sources and answer questions related to the source evolution : can we see any evidence for intermittent activity ?",
    "do gps sources grow into large radio galaxies ?",
    "the _ chandra _ x - ray observatory , with its exceptional image quality ( psf fwhm of @xmath70.5 arcsec ) , has discovered many x - ray jets associated with radio structures in radio galaxies and quasars ( see http://hea-www.harvard.edu/xjet/ ) .",
    "_ chandra _ is the only x - ray telescope which can resolve structures on 1 arcsec scales , and is well - suited for studying the environment of gps / css sources .",
    "are x - ray jets present in gps sources ?",
    "can _ chandra _ detect extended emission hinted at with rosat hri images for two gps quasars ?    here , we present _ chandra _ observations of two gps sources , pks  1127 - 145 and b2  0738 + 313 , in which we have discovered x - ray jets",
    ". we also present preliminary analysis of our gps / css sample observed during the first half year of the _ chandra _ ao3 cycle .",
    "we assume h@xmath9=50  km  sec@xmath5 mpc@xmath5 and q@xmath9=0.5 .",
    "we observed the two gps quasars with the _ chandra _ acis - s detector .",
    "pks  1127 - 145 is a quasar at z=1.187 with @xmath10  ergs  sec@xmath5 and a gps radio spectrum that peaks at @xmath71ghz .",
    "it also has an intervening damped lyman @xmath11 system ( dla ) at @xmath12 ( bechtold et al 2002 ) .",
    "the _ chandra _",
    "acis - s observation shows a @xmath13  arcsec x - ray jet ; at the quasar redshift it is @xmath14  kpc projected on the sky ( fig.1 ) .",
    "as described in siemiginowska et al ( 2002a ) , the jet curves and its emission is very faint in comparison to the nucleus .",
    "the ratio of individual knots intensities to the core intensity is @xmath15 .",
    "the x - ray knots correspond to the vla knots only roughly , with x - ray peak intensities preceding the radio peak intensities . the x - ray emission is stronger at the core , while the radio emission is stronger away from the core .",
    "b2  0738 + 313 is a quasar at z=0.63 and @xmath16 ergs  sec@xmath5 .",
    "it has two dla systems at z=0.0912 and z=0.2212 ( rao & turnshek 1998 ) .",
    "the gps radio spectrum peaks at @xmath17  ghz ( stanghellini et al 1998 ) .",
    "rosat hri observations show a hint of the extended emission present on 10 - 20  arcsec scale . with a 27  ksec _ chandra _ acis - s observation we detected an x - ray jet extending up to @xmath735  arcsec away from the nucleus , with a few enhancements in the form of hot spots and knots ( fig.1 ) .",
    "the hot spot emission is faint compared to the core , with intensity ratio of @xmath18 .",
    "vla radio maps show faint extended radio emission in the form of lobes to the north and south .",
    "the x - ray jet follows the radio emission to the south ( fig.2 ) .",
    "the x - ray jet emission is getting fainter moving away from the core , while the radio emission has two hot spots at the end of the southern lobe .",
    "there is no x - ray emission corresponding to the northern radio lobe with 3@xmath19 upper limit of 2@xmath20 photons  @xmath21  sec@xmath5  pix@xmath5 ( 1 pix=0.164  ) .",
    "comparison of x - ray , optical and radio data rules out thermal emission , synchrotron - self - compton ( ssc ) and simple direct synchrotron emission ( see harris & krawczynski 2002 for review ) as the origin of the x - ray jet emission in pks  1127 - 145 .",
    "inverse compton scattering off cmb photons ( eic / cmb ) with moderate jet bulk velocities ( @xmath22 ) can readily accommodate the observations because the eic / cmb process is especially effective at high redshift due to the @xmath23 scaling of the cmb .",
    "we note that x - rays from eic can trace the low energy ( @xmath24 ) population of particles which are not detectable in the radio band and thus delineate the `` fossil '' structure .",
    "the x - ray emission in the two knots ( b1,b2 ) of b2  0738 + 313 jet can be explained by synchrotron emission .",
    "however , knot a needs an additional component , because synchrotron emission requires unusually high acceleration efficiencies .",
    "note that in the synchrotron model the high energy break needs to be at @xmath25  hz , which seems unlikely .",
    "eic / cmb process requires @xmath26 of @xmath7  10 ( fig.2 ) and might be a possible explanation for knot a x - ray emission .      *",
    "x - ray jets in both sources extend far away from the nucleus , @xmath27  kpc projected distance .",
    "* the x - ray emission is most likely due to the interactions between relativistic jet particles and cosmic microwave background photons . *",
    "the x - ray jet emission indicates the presence of relativistic motion up to hundreds of kpc distance from the nucleus : @xmath28 .",
    "the discovery of two x - ray jets associated with gps quasars raises more questions about the nature of the gps sources : are gps / css sources truly compact or do they have extended structures ?",
    "are these structures too faint to be easily detected in radio ?",
    "can we detect extended emission in x - rays ?",
    "are gps quasars simply extended radio sources whose core is boosted towards us ?    in order to address these questions we selected a sample for the first systematic x - ray study of gps / css sources using the following criteria : ( 1 ) radio size @xmath29 arcsec .",
    "( 2 ) redshift @xmath30 . ( 3 ) low galactic hydrogen column .",
    "we have obtained deep observations of the sources which had pre - existing measurements of their x - ray flux . for sources with no previous x - ray observations we requested short 5 ksec exposures in order to estimate their x - ray count rates and luminosity .",
    "[ fig3 ]      thus far we have observed 10 out of 14 sources ( table 1 ) .",
    "the sample properties are presented in fig.3 .",
    "the details of data analysis carried out with ciao 2.2 software will be presented elsewhere ( siemiginowska et al in preparation ) . here",
    "we summarize our main results .",
    "all the observed sources have been detected and their ( 0.1 - 2kev ) fluxes range between : @xmath31erg  @xmath21  s@xmath5 .",
    "we found intrinsic absorption column in the excess of the galactic column in 6 sources : n@xmath3210@xmath33  @xmath21 .",
    "we can obtain a lower limit on the density of the absorber assuming that it provides the confinement within @xmath710  kpc from the center .",
    "this gives a density of 0.03 - 0.3  @xmath34 , compared to the average density of 1 - 10  @xmath34 required to permanently confine a jet in numerical simulations of de young ( 1993 ) .",
