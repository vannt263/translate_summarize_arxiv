    "the interplay between interactions and the complicated single - particle spectrum is expected to result in novel phases @xcite .    the first experiments which implemented an artificial magnetic field for lattice systems demonstrated the existence of the artificial magnetic field by measuring the effect of this field on excited states of the system @xcite .",

    "we use the dmrg method to study the two - leg bose - hubbard model under a magnetic field outside the mott insulator region , and look for evidence of strongly correlated behavior .        here , we limit dmrg calculations to hard - core bosons in the infinite-@xmath12 limit , providing an easier implementation of the algorithm as the hilbert space is drastically reduced by excluding multiple occupation of each site .",
    "this limit is particularly important for correlated states , as the gaps in the spectrum are expected to be more prominent with strong interactions . within this constraint",
    ", each site is allowed to be empty or have only one boson so that the maximum occupation number @xmath143 and the terms with the on - site interaction in the hamiltonian become only a constraint in the hilbert space . the bose - hubbard model in this limit can be mapped to a spin - xxz model , where the ground state is at half - filling .",
    "we find that our system has a ground state at half - filling not only for @xmath144 but also for nonzero @xmath14 .",
    "in the two limits , all sites empty and all sites filled , the ground - state energy is 0 and the minimum of the energy is always at half - filling , which is in the middle of these two limits .    )",
    "is shown by ( green ) crosses , whereas the gap between the second excited state and the ground state ( @xmath145 ) is shown by ( blue ) circles .",
    "thin solid lines are spline interpolations to data points .",
    "the spectrum shows a jump at @xmath146 , which is very close to the critical magnetic field calculated from the single - particle spectrum . ]    the energy gap between the ground - state and the first two excited states is shown in fig .",
    "[ dmrggap1 ] for half - filling .",
    "the figure shows that the spectrum of the three lowest lying states changes abruptly at @xmath147 .",
    "this plot is symmetric around @xmath57 so we only display the half .",
    "the critical value found here is consistent with the one found in the single - particle solution , which is equal to 0.2148 or 0.7852 .    to get the energies at different fillings the dmrg code",
    "must be restricted to a different particle - number - conserving subspace .",
    "we use the route proposed by ramanan _",
    "@xcite , in which the plateaus in the chemical potential versus the density plots and the corresponding compressibility are obtained successfully .",
    "we again have a system length @xmath148 and @xmath149 sites .",
    "beginning from @xmath150 and a total number of particles @xmath151 , we increase both the lattice length and the number of particles up to where the number of particles is @xmath152 .",
    "after that , the lattice length is increased while the total number of particles held fixed at 10 .",
    "whenever the lattice length reaches @xmath148 , finite system sweeps are used to decrease the energy .",
    "next , we increase the total particle number by 1 , keeping the system size fixed , and perform five sweeps to get the energy for this new filling . repeating this procedure",
    ", we get energies where the particle number is increased up to @xmath153 . in the end ,",
    "energies of systems from @xmath152 to @xmath153 particles placed at @xmath154 sites are obtained .",
    "after that , the gap formula defined by cooper _",
    "@xcite , @xmath155   \\label{coopergap}\\ ] ] is used , which minimizes finite - size effects .",
    "we show this gap for various values of magnetic field in fig .",
    "it is shown that the gap oscillates between zero and nonzero values for low densities and becomes negative towards integer filling . apart from that there are three dominant peaks ;",
    "one is always at 1/2 and the other two depend on @xmath14 .",
    "the magnitudes of these changing peaks are also shown to get smaller and smaller as the field approaches 1/2 .",
    "it is interesting to compare these peaks by defining the filling factor @xcite , @xmath156 where @xmath157 is the particle density and @xmath158 is the vortex density defined as the phase attained around a unit cell divided by @xmath159 , which means @xmath160 in our model .",
    "we see that the corresponding distinct values of the filling factors for the peaks in fig.[dm ] are obtained as @xmath161 , @xmath162 , @xmath163 for @xmath62 ; @xmath161 , @xmath164 , @xmath165 for @xmath166 ; and @xmath161 , @xmath167 , @xmath162 for @xmath64 .",
    "the dependence of the gap on the filling fraction is clear evidence of the role played by the interactions .",
    "however , our simple finite - size dmrg calculations can not reveal the character of correlations within these states .",
    "future studies of the system in this limit must include larger system sizes , finite on - site interactions , and a careful consideration of finite size effects to reveal the physics of possible correlated states in the two - leg bose - hubbard ladder .",
    "our calculations lead to a number of conclusions related to the recent experiment in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the experiment probed only the limit where the number of particles per site is high , which can mostly be described by the gross - pitaevskii level approximations .",
    "the reported phase transition between the two phases is driven by the change in the character of the single - particle spectrum rather than interactions . in this limit",
    ", the effect of interactions is expected to be quantitative rather than qualitative .",
    "our calculations indicate that the interactions will shift the boundary between the meissner and the vortex phases , however , observation of this shift is complicated by the uncertainty due to the finite temperature in the experiments .",
    "a recent paper @xcite argues that another effect of the interactions would be the spontaneous breaking of the symmetry between the two - legs . as our calculations have this symmetry built in we can not investigate such a transition .",
    "while the current experiment operates in the superfluid regime , it is natural to expect further experiments in this system to probe the region with only a few particles per site where the insulating state is likely .",
    "we expect our strong - coupling and dmrg results to be quantitatively correct for the mott transition boundary .",
    "while the effect of the external confining potential is weak in the experiment , a wedding - cake structure would be a clear indication of the mott transition .",
    "such a wedding - cake structure not only can be observed by looking at the density but also can be deduced from the link currents investigated by the method used in the present experiment .",
    "finally , our dmrg results for noninteger filling factors provide some evidence for the possibility of correlated phases in this system .",
    "however , we can not confidently assert the presence of these phases due to the finite - size limitations of our calculation . to judge the viability of the experimental observation of these phases a better characterization of their gaps and correlation properties",
    "must be made .",
    "nonetheless , our results indicate that this regime should be interesting to investigate experimentally .",
    "in conclusion , we have worked on the two - leg bose - hubbard ladder exposed to a magnetic field within various theoretical approaches and implemented the dmrg to study the behavior of the system .",
    "we have found that the system has two distinctively different regimes , in agreement with the recent experiment .",
    "the shape of the mott insulator region is obtained by three methods : variational mean - field theory , strong - coupling perturbation theory , and dmrg .",
    "we found that the shape of the lobe is consistent within the dmrg and the strong - coupling approximation , while the results of the mean - field theory are relatively poor .",
    "apart from the determination of the mott lobes , the system is found to display novel physical properties as a result of the single - particle spectrum .",
    "we believe that this model serves as an important tool for understanding the general properties of optical lattices coupled to a gauge field . in the latter part of the paper",
    ", we have calculated the excitation gap for non - integer filling and found distinct peaks at simple fractions of particle number to flux quanta .",
    "this regime will be investigated further in subsequent work .",
