    "the _ herschel _ far infrared and submillimeter imaging observations on the galactic plane have significantly advanced our knowledge about the morphology as well as the temperature and density distributions of molecular clouds @xcite , including those of ob cluster forming regions @xcite .",
    "recent _ planck",
    "_ images at ( sub)millimeter and millimeter wavelengths further revealed an extremely cold population of dense molecular cores , namely the planck cold clumps ( pccs , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "these observations have provided a large sample of star - forming molecular clumps / cores in a broad range of evolutionary stages .",
    "in addition , the better angular resolution of the _ spitzer _ near - infrared ( @xmath42@xmath5 at 3.6 - 8 @xmath6 m ) and _ herschel _ 70 and 160 @xmath6 m ( @xmath46@xmath5 and 12@xmath5 ) bands can help identify heating sources ( normally young stars ) in the molecular clouds @xcite , which help our understanding of their star - formation history . studies of the parent molecular cloud properties require observations at ( sub)millimeter wavelengths , which are typically more sensitive to the thermal emission of the 10 - 30 k interstellar medium from the optically thin part of the spectrum . the quantitative analyses including spectral energy distribution ( sed ) fitting , need to be adjusted to the angular resolution of the longest wavelength observations ( e.g. 37@xmath5 for _ herschel _ observations at 500 @xmath6 m wavelength ) . for cold molecular clumps which typically have spatial scales of @xmath40.5 pc",
    ", the population will be resolved for molecular clouds within d@xmath43 kpc , such as the rosette and carina molecular clouds ( e.g. schneider et al .",
    "2012 ; rebolledo et al .",
    "2016 ) , while the majority of the distant population of e.g. @xmath417@xmath5 at @xmath7@xmath46 kpc @xcite and represents the initial state of star - formation in giant molecular clouds ( gmcs ) , and are therefore easily missed in the derived smeared and poor angular resolution temperature and column density maps . the contrast of the localized heating sources can also be significantly suppressed due to this spatial smearing .",
    "ground - based millimeter and submillimeter bolometric observations can probe long wavelength emission of cold clumps at high angular resolution compared to space telescopes @xcite . however , ground - based observations are often subject to extended and strong atmospheric emission at these wavelengths , which is not always distinguishable from the extended emission of the molecular clouds .",
    "the atmospheric foreground subtraction procedures may lead to significant missing flux from the molecular cloud , which will bias the observed fluxes of bright sources , and may leave the adjacent fainter sources partially or fully immersed in regions of negative brightness , known as negative ` bowls ' .",
    "the details of how the extended structures will be missed in the ground - based bolometric imaging will also depend on the sky condition during the observations , which can not be easily predicted with accuracy .",
    "therefore , it is not trivial to correctly fit the sed solely with the ground - based bolometric images for the longer wavelengths , and may prevent the identification and quantitative studies of some faint structures .",
    "sadavoy et al .",
    "( 2013 ) have proposed that artificially filtering out the extended structures from both the ground - based ( sub)millimeter bolometric images and from the shorter wavelength images taken by the space telescopes can alleviate the bias when fitting the sed of compact sources . however , in this way , the properties of extended molecular cloud structures can not be derived , and the impact of negative brightness bowls still exists .",
    "alternatively , liu et al .",
    "( 2015 ) proposed that merging ground - based and space telescope observations at the same wavelengths can avoid the drawbacks of each technique .",
    "this is because the space telescope observations , which normally have poorer angular resolution than the ground - based ones , are not subject to the atmospheric foreground emission .",
    "the extended structure recovered from space - telescope observations can therefore be used to complement the ground based images to achieve high angular resolution images without missing flux .",
    "csengeri et al .",
    "( 2016 ) also applied this technique to combine the atacama pathfinder experiment ( apex ) telescope large area survey of the galaxy ( atlasgal ) 870  images with the planck / hfi 353 ghz images .    [ cols= \" < \" , ]",
    "in this section we compare the results of the sed fitting when including and exluding the 70 @xmath8 data .",
    "we note that there are previous papers discussing the effect of using shorter wavelength data for single component sed fits , and they suggest that this will lead to a certain bias on derived column densities and dust temperatures ( e.g. roy et al .",
    "2013 ; malinen et al .",
    "empirically , we found that including the 70@xmath6 m data on the short wavelength side of sed peak , helps with the convergence of fitting @xmath9 and the dust temperature simultaneously . excluding the 70 @xmath8 data point leads to either an underestimation or unreasonably high dust temperatures ( @xmath10 k ) in certain areas ( as can be seen in the rightmost panel below , figure 3 ) .",
    "overall , the structures analyzed in the present manuscript have a much higher column density than those in roy et al . ( 2013 ) and malinen et al . ( 2011 ) . in addition , the regions we are studying are in general warmer than the case studied by e.g. roy et al .",
    "( 2013 ) , so the sed of dust in the dense structures peaks towards shorter wavelengths .",
    "these two factors significantly suppress the fractional contribution of very small grains ( vsg ) or other confusion at 70 @xmath6 m .    from the plots below ( figure 22 ) , it can be seen that with and without including the 70 @xmath6 m data point in the fitting leads to a @xmath420% difference in the column density for most of the area we observed . as shown in the leftmost panel of figure 3 ,",
    "the plots of the difference between the pacs 70 @xmath6 m flux and the flux derived based on sed fits to all the other wavelengths are generally small and almost symmetric around zero .",
    "this shows that the inclusion or not of the 70 @xmath6 m data point does not strongly bias our results . in the middle panels of figure 3",
    ", we can see that the differences between the column densities derived with and without the 70 @xmath6 m data are not strongly correlated with the column density , and therefore do not systematically bias our analysis of the n - pdf and 2ptcorrelation function .",
    "contrary to the hypothesis that including the @xmath470 @xmath6 m data would lead to overestimating the temperatures of the dense gas structures , we instead found that excluding the 70 @xmath6 m data led to an overestimate of dust temperature around some relatively warm regions ( e.g. close to the hii regions ) , which then lead to an underestimation of the dust column density ."
