    "electrical impedance tomography ( eit ) is a non - invasive imaging technique which aims at reconstructing the inner structure of a reference subject from the knowledge of the current and voltage measurements on the boundary of the subject .",
    "typically , an array of electrodes are attached to the boundary of the reference subject , then small currents are applied to some or all of the electrodes and the resulting electric voltages are measured at the electrodes .",
    "these current and voltage measurements on the boundary of the reference subject are used to estimate the value of the conductivity inside the subject .",
    "the result is an image of the inner structure of the subject due to the fact that different materials have different conductivities .",
    "compared with computerized x - ray tomography , eit is less costly and requires no ionizing radiation ; hence , it qualifies for many clinical applications including lung ventilation ( e.g. @xcite ) , brain imaging ( e.g. @xcite ) , breast cancer diagnosis ( e.g. @xcite ) , etc . on the other hand , eit can also be used for nonclinical purposes such as determining the location of mineral deposits ( e.g. @xcite ) , describing soil structure ( e.g. @xcite ) , identifying cracks in non - destructive testing ( e.g. @xcite ) and so on .",
    "the inverse problem of reconstructing the conductivity from voltage - current - measurements is known to be highly ill - posed and nonlinear , and reconstructions suffer from an enormous sensitivity to modeling and measurement errors . to reduce modeling errors ,",
    "one usually concentrates on reconstructing a conductivity change with respect to a known reference conductivity .",
    "then , the most natural approach is to parametrize the support of the conductivity change and determine these parameters by an iterative , nonlinear inverse problems solver .",
    "such iterative methods yield good reconstructions for a given good initial guess ; however , they require expensive computation and have no convergence results .",
    "non - iterative methods such as the factorization method ( @xcite ) and the monotonicity - based method ( @xcite ) , on the other hand , are rigorously justified and require no initial guess .",
    "however , the reconstructions of both factorization method and monotonicity - based method tend to be rather sensitive to measurement errors when phantom data or real data are applied @xcite .    in clinical studies , it is common practice to start by linearizing the eit problem around a known reference conductivity and minimizing the residual functional of the linearized equation ( herein called linearized residual functional for the sake of brevity ) .",
    "the resulting problem can be regularized in various ways .",
    "for example , @xcite considered the minimization problem of a linearized residual functional with a regularization term , which is similar to the standard tikhonov regularization method .",
    "the algorithm proposed in @xcite is fast and simple .",
    "however , no convergence proofs are available so far . besides , one can also use sparsity reconstruction @xcite .",
    "this is an effective method to detect piecewise constant inclusions .",
    "however , strictly speaking , convergence to the true conductivity is still an open issue , as it is not clear how to obtain a global minimizer .",
    "our new method is also based on minimizing the linearized residual functional .",
    "however , instead of adding a regularization term , we employ a linear constraint defined by the monotonicity test ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 4.1 ) which plays the role of a special regularizer",
    ". global convergence of the shape reconstructions is then proved and numerical results show that this method provides good shape reconstructions even under high levels of noise . to the authors knowledge , this is the first reconstruction method based on minimizing the residual that has a rigorous global convergence property . for the question of globally convergent algorithms for other classes of inverse problems , see for example @xcite .    the paper is organized as follows .",

    ", we shall propose a regularization scheme to construct an approximate solution and prove stability in the presence of noise .",

    "@xmath0 . for the sake of simplicity",

    "the goal of eit is to determine the inclusions shape @xmath49 from the knowledge of the ntd operators @xmath22 and @xmath52 .",
    "notice that our method also works for inhomogeneous background conductivity .",
    "we start by describing our method for exact data .",
    "the idea of this method is inspired by a result of seo and one of the authors in @xcite .",
    "it is proved that , if @xmath53 is an exact solution of the linearized equation @xmath54 then the support of @xmath53 coincides with @xmath49 .",
    "however , it is not clear in general whether such an exact solution exists .",

    "more precisely , the admissible conductivity change @xmath53 is assumed to be constant on a fixed partition @xmath64 of the bounded domain @xmath0 : @xmath65 where the @xmath66 s are real constants and each @xmath67 is assumed to be open , @xmath68 , @xmath69 is connected and @xmath70 for @xmath71 .",
    "notice that , this partition is not unique , and any minimizer @xmath72 of ( [ 29.10.1 ] ) as well as any reconstruction shape ( that is , the support of some minimizer @xmath73 ) depend heavily on the choice of this partition .",
    "it is well - known that @xmath58 is a linear , bounded , compact , self - adjoint operator from @xmath30 to @xmath30 .",
    "perhaps a reasonable choice of an appropriate norm to minimize @xmath58 is the operator norm . in fact , all of the following theoretical results remain true for the operator norm . the numerical results for the operator norm can be easily obtained by considering the equivalent problem of minimizing the maximum eigenvalue of an approximate matrix of @xmath58 .",
    "another commonly used norm is the hilbert - schmidt norm .",
    "nevertheless , we could not minimize @xmath58 under the hilbert - schmidt norm , since it is not clear whether or not @xmath58 belongs to the class of hilbert - schmidt operators .",
    "the idea of using the frobenius norm comes from the fact that in realistic models , one always applies a finite number of currents @xmath12 on the boundary ; and hence , only a finite number of measurements @xmath74 are known .",
    "problem ( [ 29.10.1 ] ) was actually considered decades ago in clinical eit such as @xcite .",

    "however , no rigorous convergence results have been established so far , and the reconstructions usually contain ringing artifacts .    in the present paper , we do not follow the standard tikhonow regularization method .",
    "instead , we use a linear constraint defined by the monotonicity test @xcite as a special regularizer .      a lower bound for an admissible conductivity change @xmath53 is , in fact , due to the fact that @xmath75 . an upper bound for @xmath53 , on the contrary ,",
