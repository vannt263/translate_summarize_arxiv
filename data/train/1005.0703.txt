    "it is known that several deeply - embedded young stellar objects are driving highly - collimated molecular outflows with an extremely - high velocity ( ehv ) and jet - like component running along the axes of the lobes ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . since the ehv molecular jets having the terminal velocities of 50150 km s@xmath5 are concentrated within the narrow angles along the axes of the lobes and have large momenta comparable to those of the slowly moving ( 2030 km s@xmath5 ) `` classical  outflows , the ehv jets are considered to be closely connected to the `` primary jet  which is responsible for driving molecular outflows .",
    "therefore , studying the physical and kinematical properties of the ehv jet will allow us to understand the properties of the `` primary jet  which provide clues to constrain the launching mechanism of the outflows .",
    "the low - luminosity ( 7.5 @xmath2 ; @xcite ) class 0 source l1448c ( also known as l1448-mm ) in the perseus molecular cloud complex ( d@xmath1250 pc : e.g. , @xcite ) is a spectacular example of an outflow with an ehv jet .",
    "the ehv component of this source was identified as the secondary peaks of the co @xmath0=21 spectra at @xmath860 km s@xmath5 from the cloud systemic velocity @xcite .",
    "the co emission in the ehv range was found to be confined to a series of discrete clumps , called `` bullets \" , which are aligned along the axes of the outflow lobes and are symmetrically placed with respect to the central source .",
    "the ehv bullets are also observed in several transitions of the sio ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "since the sio emission has been barely detected in quiescent dark clouds because of its very low abundance ( of the order of 10@xmath9 ; @xcite ) , the detection of sio in ehv bullets suggests the presence of shocks that enhanced the sio abundance in bullet gas by a factor of @xmath1010@xmath11 .",
    "although the lower transition of sio , i.e. @xmath0=21 , was observed not only in the ehv bullets but also in the lower velocity component that delineates the tips and walls of the outflow cavities , @xmath0=54 emission was confined to a pair of ehv bullets located at the closest positions to the star @xcite .",
    "this suggests that the excitation condition of the ehv jet varies along the axes , and that the jet gas is highly excited in the close vicinity of the driving source .",
    "recently , higher excitation sio up to @xmath0=11 - 10 has been observed by @xcite .",
    "their results have revealed that the innermost pair of bullets , labeled b1 and r1 by @xcite , have a density of @xmath12 @xmath13 and a kinetic temperature of @xmath14 500 k , which is denser and warmer than the bullets in the downstream .",
    "it is also known that the innermost pair of bullets , b1 and r1 are resolved into two clumps , bi - bii and ri - rii , respectively , in the higher resolution ( @xmath12 ) interferometric sio @xmath0=21 observations @xcite .",
    "the high resolution sio data exhibit the kinematic structure of the ehv jet near the source , which shows an apparent acceleration of the jet up to 70 km s@xmath5 within a region of 6@xmath15 ( @xmath12000 au ) .",
    "the proper motion measurement of the sio clumps carried out by @xcite suggests that the outflow axis is inclined by 21@xmath16 with respect to the plane of the sky , and therefore , the sio clumps in the ehv jet are likely to be moving with absolute velocities of 180 km s@xmath5 .    in this paper , we present the sio @xmath0=87 , co @xmath0=32 , and 350 ghz continuum images obtained with the submillimeter array ( sma ) @xcite at @xmath11 arcsecond resolution , which is a factor of three higher than the previous sio @xmath0=21 images @xcite . a high angular resolution is crucial for studying the structure and kinematics of the jet near the base , at which the jet velocity increases up to the terminal velocity . in addition , higher transitions of sio and co in the submillimeter waverange enable us to segregate the dense and warm gas in the ehv jet from the lower excitation gas in the cavity wall .",
    "the observations of the sio @xmath0=87 and co @xmath0=32 lines and 350 ghz continuum emission were carried out with the sma on 2006 december 5 in the extended configuration and on 2006 december 25 in the compact configuration .",
    "the two array configurations provided projected baselines ranging from 12 m to 222 m . since the primary beam of the sma antenna has a size of @xmath135 , two pointings separated by 17were observed in order to cover the ehv bullet pair closest to the central source .",
    "the receivers have two sidebands ; the lower and upper sidebands covered the frequency ranges from 345.5 to 347.5 ghz , and from 355.5 to 357.5 ghz , respectively . the sio @xmath0=87 and co @xmath0=32 lines",
    "were observed simultaneously in the lower sideband .",
    "the sma correlator divides each sideband of 2 ghz bandwidth into 24 `` chunks \" of 104 mhz width .",
    "we used the configuration that gave 256 channels to all chunks , which provided a uniform frequency resolution of 406.25khz across a 2ghz - wide band .",
    "the corresponding velocity resolution was 0.35 km s@xmath5 .",
    "we used titan for flux calibration , and a pair of quasars 3c84 and 3c111 for amplitude and phase calibrations .",
    "the flux calibration was estimated to be accurate to 25% .",
    "the band pass was calibrated by observing 3c273 .",
    "the calibrated visibility data were fourier transformed and cleaned using the miriad package .",
    "the velocity - channel maps of the sio and co were made with a velocity interval of 1 km s@xmath5 .",
    "the synthesized beam size of the sio map was 096@xmath6084 with a position angle of @xmath1784@xmath16 and that of the co map was 096@xmath6086 with a position angle of @xmath1776@xmath16 with uniform weighting .",
    "the rms noise level of the velocity - channel map at 1.0 km s@xmath5 width was 0.15 jy beam@xmath5 .",
    "a non - linear joint deconvolution , mossdi , which is based on the clean - based algorithm , and is part of the miriad package @xcite , was used for deconvolving the images .",
    "the 350 ghz continuum map was obtained by averaging the line - free chunks of both sidebands . to improve the signal to noise ratio ,",
    "the upper and lower sidebands data were combined .",
    "the synthesized beam size of the map made with uniform weighting was 093@xmath6083 with a position angle of @xmath1786@xmath16 .",
    "the rms noise levels of the 345 ghz continuum maps was 6.4 mjy beam@xmath5 .",
    "the 350 ghz continuum map reveals a bright compact source at the center .",
    "this source has a peak intensity of 352 mjy beam@xmath5 , and is surrounded by spatially extended emission .",
    "in addition to this bright source , there is a faint emission peak of @xmath15@xmath18 level at @xmath183 southeast of the center .",
    "spitzer space telescope _",
    "observations at mid - infrared wavelengths have resolved l1448c into two components , l1448c(n ) and l1448c(s ) @xcite .",
    "the bright submillimeter source at the center corresponds to l1448c(n ) , which is considered to be the driving source of the highly - collimated molecular outflow and is also referred to as l1448-mm , and the southern faint source corresponds to l1448c(s ) .",
    "dust continuum emission from l1448c(s ) was also detected by @xcite at 230 ghz and 350 ghz with the sma , and by @xcite at 107 ghz with the plateau de bure interferometer ( pdbi ) .",
    "the visibility amplitudes plot for l1448c(n ) as a function of _ uv _ distance ( fig .  [ fig2 ] )",
    "suggests that this source consists of two components ; one is from a spatially extended envelope that dominates the flux at a _ uv _ distance of @xmath1950 k@xmath20 , and the other is from a compact source that is prominent at @xmath2150 k@xmath20 .",
    "the visibility amplitude profile was fit by two circular gaussian components ; one is an extended component with a deconvolved size of @xmath13.6and a flux of @xmath1440 mjy , and the other is a compact component with a deconvolved size of @xmath10.3and a flux of @xmath1330 mjy .",
    "the peak flux values of the extended and compact components correspond to @xmath127 mjy and @xmath1330 mjy beam@xmath5 , respectively , per 093@xmath6083 beam . as shown in fig .",
    "1a , the extended component appears as a bump in the northwest and a tail in the southeast ( both of them are in the 3@xmath18 level ) of the central source , suggesting that this emission extends along the outflow axis . similar emission feature along the outflow axis is also seen in the maps of 3 mm @xcite , 2.6 mm @xcite , 1.4 mm @xcite , and 1.3 mm @xcite observed with 1.53resolution .",
    "such a faint elongated feature was clearly seen in l1157-mm , and was interpreted as the edges of the cavity excavated by the outflow @xcite .",
    "it is , therefore , possible that the extended emission in l1448c(n ) also delineates the inner part of the envelope which is disturbed by the outflow , although the cavity - like structure is not clearly seen .",
    "an alternative interpretation is that the faint emission comes from an embedded companion .",
    "a faint secondary peak seen in the 230 ghz map of @xcite implies this possibility .",
    "however , the position of the secondary peak at 230 ghz in @xcite is 1offset toward the northwest from that of our 350 ghz map . as discussed in @xcite such a small difference in position between the 350 ghz peak and 230 ghz peak",
    "could be introduced by the extended emission from the envelope component sampled by different _",
    "uv _ coverages . since the total flux at 350 ghz observed with the sma ( extended + compact components ) corresponds to 43 % of the flux observed by @xcite at 850 @xmath22 m with scuba at the jcmt ( 1.737 jy per 14beam ) , it is possible that the extended component that is not sampled well with the sma affects the morphology of the faint component .",
    "although the northwestern bump may harbor an embedded companion , it is likely that most of the extended emission arises from the inner part of the envelope .",
    "therefore , the former scenario , which attributes the extended component to the envelope ",
    "outflow interacting region , is more preferable in this case .    the visibility amplitude profile at _ uv _ distance longer than @xmath150 k@xmath20 implies that the compact component is not point - like but has a spatially resolved structure .",
    "in order to exclude the contamination from the extended envelope component , we made a map using the visibility data with the _ uv _ distances greater than 70 k@xmath20 ( see fig.1b ) . the synthesized beam of this map is 070@xmath6050 with a position angle of @xmath1787.2@xmath16 .",
    "it is shown that the compact source has an elongation along the axis perpendicular to the outflow axis .",
    "a two dimensional gaussian fit to the visibility data with _ uv _ distances larger than 70 k@xmath20 yields the deconvolved major and minor axes of 0.37(90 au ) and 0.26(65 au ) , respectively , with a position angle of @xmath170@xmath16 .",
    "the source position derived from the fit is @xmath23(j2000 ) = 3@xmath2425@xmath2538.873@xmath26 , @xmath27(j2000)=30@xmath1644@xmath280535 .",
    "this position agrees well ( less than 01 ) with the 3.6 cm continuum position observed with a smaller beam of 031@xmath6027 @xcite .",
    "the 350 ghz flux of l1448c(s ) was measured to be @xmath160 mjy , which is consistent to that reported by @xcite .",
    "l1448c(s ) was detected in 230 ghz by @xcite but not by @xcite at the same frequency .",
    "the non - detection of this source by @xcite is probably because this source is located near the edge of the primary beam of the pdbi ( @xmath122 ) .",
    "if the response of their primary beam is taken into account , the 230 ghz continuum source with a flux of 12.8@xmath293 mjy detected by @xcite could be below the detection limit of their observations ( @xmath18.4 mjy beam@xmath5 ) .",
    "although l1448c(s ) is bright in mid - infrared , its sub - mm flux is more than ten times weaker than l1448c(n ) .",
    "it is unlikely that such a small sub - mm flux is due to the effect of missing flux , because single - dish measurements at 450 and 350 @xmath22 m @xcite showed no hint of the secondary component to the south of l1448c(n ) even though the angular resolution ( @xmath18 ) was comparable to the separation of two sources .",
    "the sio @xmath0=87 emission was detected in two velocity ranges from @xmath1770 to @xmath1712 km s@xmath5 ( blueshifted ) and from 20 to 71 km s@xmath5 ( redshifted ) with respect to the systemic velocity of @xmath305.0 km s@xmath5 .",
    "[ fig3 ] shows velocity channel maps of the sio @xmath0=87 emission at 10 km s@xmath5 intervals .",
    "it is shown that the sio emission comes from the jetlike narrow region with its blueshifted part to the northwest and the redshifted part to the southeast of l1448c(n ) . the sio @xmath0=87 jet",
    "is partially resolved along its minor axis ; after deconvolution from the sma beam , the width of the sio jet is @xmath10.8(@xmath1200 au ) fwhm on average . in order to estimate the missing flux ,",
    "we have smoothed the sma map to a resolution of 14and compared it with the sio @xmath0=87 spectra observed with the james clerk maxwell telescope ( jcmt ; * ? ? ?",
    "it is found that 85100 % of the single - dish flux is recovered by the sma , implying that almost all the sio @xmath0=87 emission arises from the narrow jet .",
    "sio @xmath0=87 emission mainly comes from the b1 and r1 `` bullets  identified in the single - dish co @xmath0=21 map by @xcite .",
    "the sio jet consists of a chain of knots with a typical size scale of @xmath111.5 .",
    "a comparison with the previous sio @xmath0=21 maps with @xmath13resolution @xcite reveals that the three pairs of knots close to l1448c(n ) seen in the sio @xmath0=87 map corresponds to the inner pair bi and ri in the sio @xmath0=21 map , and the two pairs in the downstream correspond to the outer pair bii and rii .",
    "the innermost knot pair bia and ria are located within 1(250 au ) from l1448c(n ) .",
    "the high - resolution image also shows that the sio jet is not straight .",
    "a close - up view of the high velocity component ( fig .  [ fig5 ] ) shows that the jet changes its position angle from + 15@xmath16 at bii , @xmath1725@xmath16 at bi , @xmath1720@xmath16at ri , to @xmath175@xmath16 at rii .",
    "the kinks between bi and bii , and ri and rii are also seen in the previous sio @xmath0=21 maps of @xmath13resolution @xcite .",
    "however , it is more obvious in the higher resolution image . in addition , it is clear that the jet axes in bi and ri are also misaligned by 5@xmath16 .",
    "the co @xmath0=32 emission was detected in the wide velocity range from @xmath1777 km s@xmath5 to @xmath3179 km s@xmath5 with respect to the systemic velocity . in the velocity ranges of @xmath3240",

    "the opening angles of the v - shape features become narrower as the velocity offset increases , suggesting that the co emission in the v - shaped features comes from the limb - brightened shells . the largest opening angle of the shell",
    "is @xmath160@xmath16 in the blueshifted lobe , while it is @xmath140@xmath16 in the redshifted lobe . in the higher velocity ranges of @xmath334170",
    "km s@xmath5 ( fig .",
    "4e , 4f , and 4 g ) , the co emission comes from a narrow jet - like region .",
    "the co flux recovered by the sma in each velocity range was estimate by comparing the co spectra observed by the sma with those observed by the jcmt .",
    "the sma map was smoothed to be a 14resolution so as to match with the beam of the jcmt .",
    "it is found that the recovered flux is only @xmath120  % in the lowest velocity ranges ( @xmath33110 km s@xmath5 ; fig .",
    "4a ) , and is @xmath150% in the next velocity range of @xmath331120 km s@xmath5 ( fig .",
    "the edges of the shells in fig .",
    "4a and 4b look very steep probably because significant amount of the co emission from spatially extended component was filtered out by the interferometer .",
    "in fact , previous examples of the l1157 outflow and iras 04166 + 2706 outflow revealed that the edges of the bipolar cavities were emphasized in the maps made with the interferometer data alone , while the cavities were filled by the diffuse co emission when the single - dish data were added @xcite . on the other hand , in the higher velocity ranges with @xmath3420 km s@xmath5 , 80100% of the co flux was recovered by the sma .",
    "this suggests that almost all the co @xmath0=32 flux in the extremely high velocity ranges ( fig .",
    "4e , 4f , and 4 g ) comes from the narrow jet .    as in the case of the sio jet",
    ", the co @xmath0=32 jet also shows clumpy structure .",
    "in addition , most of the knots seen in the sio @xmath0=87 map have their counterparts in the co map .",
    "however , the innermost knots bia and ria , which are significant in the sio map at @xmath332160 km s@xmath5 are barely seen in the co map .",
    "this is probably because most of the co molecules in these knots are excited to the levels higher than @xmath0=3 because of high density and high temperature .",
    "similar feature with strong sio and weak co in the close vicinity of the protostar was also observed in the highly collimated jet in the hh211 outflow @xcite .",
    "another difference between the co jet and sio jet is seen between bic and biia , and ric and riia .",
    "the co map reveals the knot pair labeled bi - ii and ri - ii , while the sio map shows only faint emission ( fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] ) . in the co @xmath0=32 , the overall distribution of the ehv jet is more continuous as compared to the sio distribution .",
    "as in the case of the sio jet , the blue and red axes of the co jet are also misaligned by @xmath15@xmath16 .",
    "the kinks between bi and bii , and ri and rii are also seen in the co jet .",
    "in addition , the ridge of the co emission wiggles along the jet axis . this wiggling feature is clearly seen in the maps of the highest velocity ranges ( fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] ) .",
    "it is likely that each knot has been ejected in slightly different direction . since the typical knot separation , 23corresponds to a time interval of 1520 yr ,",
    "the observed jet wiggling suggests that the direction of jet ejection also varies in a similar time scale . on the other hand",
    ", the co emission with lower intensity that is surrounding the emission ridge tends to extend linearly along the axes .",
    "the transverse width of the lower level co emission component increases with a distance from the source .",
    "this is probably because significant part of the co emission comes from the outflow shell even in the extremely high velocity ranges ( see the next section ) .",
    "there is faint co emission with the highest velocity seen ahead of the sio jet .",
    "since this highest velocity emission is spatially extended , it is likely that it arises from the highest velocity part of the shells .",
    "position - velocity ( p - v ) diagrams of the sio and co emission along the jet axes ( the position angle is @xmath1725@xmath16 for the blueshifted part and is @xmath1720@xmath16 for the redshifted part ) are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] . due to the change of the position angle",
    ", the outer knots biib and riib do not appear in these p - v diagrams .",
    "the velocity structure of the jet is well traced in the sio .",
    "the jet velocity rapidly increases within @xmath351from the star , and reaches close to its highest velocity ( @xmath3665 km s@xmath5 from @xmath37 ) at @xmath15from the star , which corresponds to the positions of the bic and ric knots .",
    "the velocity dispersion is extremely large ( @xmath3850 km s@xmath5 at 1@xmath18 level ) at the base , while it narrows to @xmath3820 km s@xmath5 at the positions of the bic and ric knots . in the positions",
    "further downsteam , from bic to biia and from ric to riia , the observed radial velocity slightly decreases in the blueshifted side , while it increases in the redshifted side .",
    "these radial velocity changes are probably due to the change of inclination angle , because the position angle of the jet also changes at these positions .",
    "the velocity pattern shown in the sio is similar to those of the atomic jets from class i source and t tauri stars , in which the low - velocity components with broad line widths are located near the base and the high - velocity components with narrower line widths are located further from the source ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "in addition to the global velocity structure , each knot shows its internal velocity gradient with its higher velocity in the upstream side and lower velocity in the downstream side .      in the co @xmath0=32 , the jet shows a similar velocity pattern with a similar velocity centroid as the sio .",
    "in addition to the jet , the p - v map of the co shows extended low velocity features ( slower than @xmath2915 km s@xmath5 ) and linear velocity features with the velocity magnitude increasing with the distance from the source ( `` hubble - law  ) .",
    "these hubble - law features are obviously different from the jets , and are not seen in the sio , suggesting that they are from the outflow shells .",
    "it should be noted that the radial velocity offsets of the linear velocity components become larger than 50 km s@xmath5 at around @xmath3510from the star , and contaminate the co map in the ehv range .",
    "the observed velocity pattern of the outflow shell is different from that predicted by the jet - driven bow shock model , in which the p - v structure shows a convex spur with high - velocity components at the jet head ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) ; it is rather similar to the velocity pattern produced by the wide - angle wind model @xcite . in the wide - angle wind model ,",
    "an outflow shell consists of ambient material swept - up by a radial wind from a young star .",
    "a `` hubble - law  in the shell velocity is expected if the shell is expanding into an ambient medium with a radial density profile of @xmath39 @xcite .",
    "the shape of the shell is determined by the combination of the poloidal density profiles of the wind and ambient gas .",
    "it is approximately parabolic for an @xmath40-wind type of wide opening angle wind with an angle - dependent density profile of @xmath41 ( where @xmath42 is an angle measured from the axis of the flow ) expanding into an ambient medium with a @xmath43 density profile , which is appropriate for magnetized cores @xcite .",
    "therefore , we adopted the simplified analytical model of a wind - driven model proposed by @xcite to examine whether the observed morphology and kinematics of the co outflow shells can be explained by means of wide - opening angle wind model . in the cylindrical coordinate system",
    ", the structure and velocity of the shell can be written as follows : @xmath44 where z is the distance along the outflow axis ; r is the radial size of the outflow perpendicular to z ; @xmath45 and _ v_@xmath46 are free parameters which describe the spatial and velocity distributions of the outflow shell , respectively .",

    "the inclination angle of the outflow axis with respect to the plane of the sky was assumed to be 21@xmath16 , which is derived from the proper motion measurement for the sio @xmath0=21 jet by @xcite .",
    "the dynamical age of the outflow shell is given by 1/@xmath47 and is estimated to be @xmath1240 yr .",
    "this number is roughly consistent with the dynamical age of @xmath1500 yr derived from the extent of the shell ( @xmath125= 6300 au ) , the mass - weighted - mean radial velocity of the shell ( @xmath122 km s@xmath5 ) , and the inclination angle of the outflow axis ( @xmath121@xmath16 ) .",
    "the model curves that delineate the outer boundaries of the lobes projected onto the plane of the sky are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig8 ] on top of the contours of the outflow shells .",
    "the model curves of the p - v maps are shown in fig .",
    "however , this simplified wind - driven model has difficulty in reproducing several observed features .",
    "first , the observed co intensity drops sharply at the systemic velocity and does not extend to the opposite velocity ranges , while the model curves on the p - v maps predict the emission at @xmath3010 km s@xmath5 in the blueshifted lobe and at @xmath300 km s@xmath5 in the redshifted lobe .",
    "second , the shapes of the shells in the different velocities can not be reproduced ( fig .  [ fig9 ] ) .",
    "the observed co emission shows v - shaped distributions in the velocity ranges close to the systemic velocity . on the other hand ,",
    "the model curves predict elliptical shapes ( fig . 9a and 9b ) .",
    "in addition , the transverse width of the co shell becomes narrower as the velocity offset increases , while the model predict the opposite trend .",
    "it should be noted that the co emission near the protostar in fig . 9c and 9d arises from the jet .      in order to search for the signs of jet rotation , the velocity gradient along the minor axes of the jet was examined .",
    "the p - v diagrams of the sio and co at the positions of innermost two pairs of knots ( fig .",
    "[ fig11 ] ) show no clear velocity gradient at the positions of bia , ria , and rib . on the other hand",
    ", there is some hint of velocity gradient in the sio at the position of bib ; the southwestern side of the jet tends to be more blueshifted than the northeastern part .",
    "however , this velocity gradient is in the opposite sense to the rotation pattern of the nh@xmath48 core with its blueshifted part in the northeast and the redshifted part in the southwest @xcite .",
    "this suggests that the observed velocity gradient is not due to the rotation .",
    "the physical parameters of the ehv jet were estimated using the co flux measured in the velocity ranges of @xmath49=5070 km s@xmath5 , in which most of the co flux was recovered by the sma .",
    "we assumed that the co emission in these velocity ranges is optically thin , and that the excitation condition of the co follows the lte .",
    "a fractional abundance of the co and a mean atomic weight were adopted to be 10@xmath50 and 1.41 , respectively .",
    "the kinetic temperature of molecular gas in the ehv jetwas derived to be 5001200 k from the far infrared lines of co , h@xmath51o , and h@xmath51 @xcite , and @xmath21500 k from the millimeter and submillimeter sio lines @xcite .",

    "since the mass of the protostar with jet is only 0.030.09 @xmath4 , the total mass of the binary system is considered to be less than 0.18 @xmath4 .",
    "therefore , the radius and period of the orbital morion are estimated to be smaller than 4.2 au and 20 yr , respectively .",

    "in order to produce the c - shaped pattern with the orbital motion , the orbital period needs to be longer than twice of the dynamical time scale .    in the case of dynamical pressure of external medium , ambient gas with @xmath88(h@xmath51)@xmath1910@xmath11 @xmath13 can not account for bending the jet with a density of @xmath2110@xmath79 @xmath13 , unless the protostar is moving with a velocity that is comparable to the jet velocity . on the other hand , the dynamical pressure caused by the outflow from the nearby protostar , l1448n , can not be ruled out . as shown in the co map of @xcite , the redshifted lobe of the l1448n outflow overlaps with the blue lobe of the l1448c(n ) outflow .",

    "in addition to the c - shaped bending , the jet is also deflected toward the east by @xmath140@xmath16 at the position of bi - ii and toward the south by @xmath115@xmath16 at the ri - ii position . since both sides of the jet are deflected at almost same distance from the central star , the jet deflection is likely to be caused by some variability intrinsic to the driving source rather than by external perturbation . the observed",
    "morphology is similar to the s - shaped point - reflection symmetric pattern that is expected if the disk is precessing or wobbling .",
    "although the jet is not exactly the s - shape but asymmetric in deflection angle , this is probably because of the projection effect . in a binary protostellar system with a disk misaligned with the orbital plane of the binary , the disk wobbles with a period approximately half of the binary orbital period and precesses with a period of @xmath120 orbital period @xcite .",
    "s - shaped point symmetry will be observed if the precession or wobbling time scale is longer than four times of the dynamical timescale .",

    "on the other hand , if the jet deflection is due to the wobbling of the disk , the orbital period and the separation of the binary are estimated to be @xmath1400 yr and 30 au , respectively . since the estimated separation of the binary is smaller than the size of the disk observed with the 350 ghz continuum emission , it is possible that the observed 90 au scale disk harbors two sources separated by 60 au . however , the binary with a separation of @xmath2160 au can not account for the small scale wiggling feature .",

    "however , the orbital motion can not explain the relation between the sio intensity and velocity gradient . as shown in the p - v map ( fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] ) , each sio knot has its higher velocity in the upstream side and lower velocity in the downstream side .",
    "the opposite velocity gradient is always seen in the faint emission between the knots . such a structure is more likely to be formed by means of periodic variation of the ejection velocity . in such a case ,",

    "it is considered that the sio molecules observed in jets and outflows are formed as a consequence of grain sputtering in a c - shock releasing si - bearing material into the gas phase , followed by the reaction with o and oh @xcite . the multi - transition sio lines from the l1448c(n ) jet observed by @xcite have been successfully modeled by the steady - state c - shock model of @xcite with a pre - shock density of @xmath110@xmath90 @xmath13 and a shock velocity of 3045 km s@xmath5 . however , the conversion of si into sio is initially rather slow in their models , and the predicted sio line emission predominantly arises from postshock gas @xmath21100 yr after the passage of shocks . since most of the sio knots in the l1448c(n ) jet have dynamical timescale shorter than the sio formation timescale , the steady - state c - type shock models of @xcite does not account for the sio in the knots close to the central star , especially in the innermost knot pair with extremely short time scale less than 10 yr .",
    "one possible explanation is that the sio molecules existed on the grain mantles and are released into the gas - phase by means of shocks as suggested by @xcite .",
    "another possibility is the formation of sio in high density primary jet @xcite .",
    "@xcite studied the formation of molecules in protostellar winds , which are originally neutral atomic , and found that significant quantities of sio can be formed quickly in the close vicinity ( @xmath190.1 au ) of the central star if the mass - loss rate is high ( @xmath2110@xmath72 @xmath4 ) .",
    "since the mass - loss rate of the l1448c(n ) jet is high enough , this scenario of in situ formation also can be the origin of the sio in the jet .",
    "the chemical models of @xcite also predict significant amount of co synthesized in the winds ; the co abundance reaches an equilibrium value of 4@xmath610@xmath50 under the conditions in which observable amount of sio is formed .",
    "the morphological and kinematical similarity of the co and sio jets supports the idea that both co and sio are formed in the protostellar wind .",
    "the secondary source l1448c(s ) is located at @xmath183 ( 2000 au ) southeast of l1448c(n ) .",
    "the 350 ghz continuum flux of this source is @xmath160 mjy , which is five times smaller than the flux from l1448c(n ) .",
    "if an optically thin condition is assumed , the mass of the circumstellar material surrounding l1448c(s ) is estimated from the observed flux using the dust mass opacity of 1.75 @xmath91 g@xmath5 @xcite and the formula given by @xcite . for a dust temperature of @xmath140",
    "k , the estimated mass in the optically thin limit is 8.6@xmath610@xmath52 @xmath4 . since l1448c(s ) is associated with a molecular outflow , it is highly probable that this source is a protostar rather than a mere dust clump at the cavity wall as claimed by @xcite .",
    "the nh@xmath48 data of @xcite suggest that l1448c(s ) is formed in the same dense core as l1448c(n )",
    ". however , the sed of l1448c(s ) is significantly different from that of l1448c(n ) . in table 4 , the broad - band spectra of l1448c(n ) and l1448c(s ) measured at different wavelengths are listed . in the near - infrared , l1448c(s )",
    "is much dimmer than l1448c(n ) ; only l1448c(n ) appeared in the @xmath92 band image of @xcite . on the contrary , in the mid - inrfrared at three irac bands , band 2 ( 4.5 @xmath22 m ) , band 3 ( 5.8 @xmath22 m ) , and band 4",
    "( 8.0 @xmath22 m ) , l1448c(s ) becomes brighter than l1448c(n ) ; especially in the bands 3 and 4 , l1448c(s ) is more than six times brighter than l1448c(n ) . in the mips",
    "24 @xmath22 m image , l1448c(s ) is also seen clearly @xcite . the flux from l1448c(s ) at 24 @xmath22 m looks similar to that from l1448c(n ) , although the accurate flux value of each source is not easy to measure because of the confusion . in the sub - mm and mm wavebands , l1448c(s ) is much weaker than l1448c(n ) .",
    "the masses of the circumstellar material surrounding l1448c(s ) , @xmath10.01 @xmath4 , is approximately 10 times smaller than that of l1448c(n ) , @xmath10.1 @xmath4 . due to the small amount of circumstellar material ,",
    "the central star of l1448c(s ) is likely to be less obscured in the mid - infrared as compared to that of l1448c(n ) enshrouded by the thick cocoon .",
    "the outflow activities in two sources are also different significantly .",
    "the co outflow from l1448c(s ) is compact and substantially weaker than the l1448c(n ) outflow .",
    "the momentum flux of the l1448c(s ) outflow is only @xmath110@xmath72 @xmath4 km s@xmath5 yr@xmath5 , which is two or three orders of magnitude smaller than that of the l1448c(n ) outfow and is comparable to those of class i outflows studied by @xcite .",
    "in addition , there is no ehv component nor sio emission associated with the outflow from l1448c(s ) .",
    "the small amount of circumstellar material of less than 0.01 @xmath4 suggests that l1448c(s ) may have accumulated most of its circumstellar mass .",
    "the less energetic outflow also support the idea that l1448c(s ) has a nature close to class i rather than class 0 .",
    "these results imply that two sources , l1448c(n ) and l1448c(s ) are formed in different epochs in the same dense core .",
    "another possibility is the effect of the l1448c(n ) outflow .",
    "since l1448c(s ) is located at the same line of sight as the l1448c(n ) outflow , it is possible that the outflowing gas has stripped away the dense gas surrounding l1448c(s ) .",
    "although the three - dimensional geometries of the sources and outflows are not clear , the high rotational temperature of nh@xmath48 observed at the position of l1448c(s ) @xcite suggests the possibility that the gas around l1448c(s ) is heated by the interaction with the jet from l1448c(n ) .",
    "in such a case , the _ apparent _ age of l1448c(s ) is older than that of l1448c(n ) simply because the amount of material left around l1448c(s ) is smaller than that around l1448c(n ) .",
    "the effect of outflow is also proposed to explain the difference of the apaprent evolutionary stage of protostellar pair l1448n(a ) and l1448n(b ) , which is located at @xmath175northwest of l1448c @xcite .",
    "the third scenario is the disintegration of an unstable multiple system as proposed by @xcite . since nonhierarchical triple systems are unstable , they break up , ejecting the lightest member , while the remaining two members form a close binary system with a highly eccentric orbit . in this scenario ,",
    "the disks around escaping stars will be highly truncated ; the typical disk size is expected to be around half of the distance between the stars in the close triple encounter . if l1448c(s ) is the escaping member , the small amount of its circumstellar material can be explained by means of disk truncation .",
    "this scenario also implies that l1448c(n ) is a close binary system .",
    "the observed deflection , wiggling , and periodic velocity variation of the jet suggest the possibility that l1448c(n ) is a close binary system with an orbital radius of @xmath124 au .",
    "therefore , it is possible that such a close binary system was formed by means of disintegration of a triple system . in order to assess",
    "this scenario , kinematic information of l1448c(s ) becomes important .",
    "although previous nh@xmath48 results of @xcite did not show peculiar motions in the dense core containing l1448c(n ) and l1448c(s ) , a detailed study with higher angular resolution would be helpful .",
    "the central region of the highly - colimated molecular outflow driven by l1448c was mapped in the sio @xmath0=87 , co @xmath0=32 , and 350 ghz continuum emission with the sma at @xmath11 arcsecond resolution .",
    "our main conclusions are the following :    1 .",
    "the 350 ghz continuum emission was detected from two _ spitzer _ sources l1448c(n ) and l1448c(s ) . the continuum emission from l1448c(n )",
    "consists of an extended component and a compact component .",
    "the compact component is elongated perpendicular to the outflow axis , and is likely to be a circumstellar disk with a size of @xmath190 au .",
    "the spectral index of this compact component derived from the data from 86 ghz to 350 ghz is @xmath932 , suggesting the possibility that the continuum emission is optically thick at 350 ghz .",
    "the mass of the disk is estimated to be @xmath10.11 @xmath4 .",
    "2 .   the continuum flux from l1448c(s ) is @xmath160 mjy , which is @xmath110 times lower than the flux from l1448c(n ) , although l1448c(s ) is brighter than l1448c(n ) in the mid infrared wavebands .",
    "the mass of the circumstellar material surrounding l1448c(s ) is estimated to be 8.6@xmath610@xmath52 @xmath4 .",
    "3 .   a narrow jet from l1448c(n ) along the outflow axis",
    "was observed in the sio and the high - velocity co. the width of the jet measured in the sio images is @xmath1200 au fwhm on average .",
    "the jet consists of a chain of emission knots with an inter - knot spacing of @xmath1500 au .",
    "it is likely that the knots in the l1448 jet are the internal bow shocks in the jet beam .",
    "the dynamical timescale of the innermost pair of knots , which are significant in the sio but barely seen in the co , is only @xmath110 yr .",
    "it is likely that the sio may have been formed quickly in the protostellar wind through the gas - phase reaction , or been formed on the dust grain and directly released into the gas phase by means of shocks .",
    "the low velocity co emission delineates two v - shaped shells with a common apex at l1448c(n ) .",
    "the kinematics of this shell component is reproduced by the model of wide opening angle wind .",
    "therefore , the outflow from l1448c(n ) consists of both highly - collimated jets and shells produced by wide - opening angle wind .",
    "the observed jet+shell structure can be explained by the `` unified model  proposed by @xcite , in which highly - collimated jet components are explained as an on - axis density enhancement of the _ x_-wind type of wide opening angle wind .",
    "the jet from l1448c(n ) is extremely active with a momentum supply rate of @xmath15@xmath610@xmath50 @xmath4 km s@xmath5 yr@xmath5 and a mechanical luminosity of @xmath17 @xmath2 .",
    "the mass accretion rate derived from the mass loss rate is @xmath110@xmath3 @xmath4 yr@xmath5 .",
    "such a high mass - accretion rate and a rather low bolometric luminosity of the central source , 7.5 @xmath2 , imply that the central protostar is still in the very early phase of its evolution with a mass of 0.030.09 @xmath4 and a dynamical age of ( 412)@xmath610@xmath7 yr .",
    "the blue part and the red part of the jet are misaligned by @xmath15@xmath16 and forming a c - shaped bending toward the west .",
    "the possible origin of this bending is the dynamical pressure caused by the outflow from the nearby protostar , l1448n .",
    "the jet is deflected toward the east in the blueshifted part and toward the south in the redshifted part .",
    "in addition , the jet is wiggling with a period of @xmath11520 yr .",
    "the deflection and wiggling of the jet can be explained if the driving source is a member of the binary system with an orbital radius of 24 au .",
    "the jet shows a semi - periodic variation in radial velocity with an amplitude of @xmath17 km s@xmath5 .",
    "each sio knot has its higher velocity in the upstream side and lower velocity in the downstream side .",
    "the opposite velocity gradient is seen in the faint emission between the knots .",
    "it is likely that the ejection velocity varies periodically by means of modulation of mass accretion .",
    "the bipolar outflow in the ne - sw direction centered at l1448c(s ) was discovered in the co @xmath0=32 .",
    "this provides a strong evidence that l1448c(s ) is a protostar .",
    "the momentum flux of this outflow is only @xmath110@xmath72 @xmath4 km s@xmath5 yr@xmath5 , which is two to three orders of magnitude smaller than that of l1448c(n ) outflow , and is comparable to those of class i outflow .",
    "l1448c(s ) is surrounded by a rather small amount of circumstellar material of less than 0.01 @xmath4 and is powering a less energetic outflow , suggesting that this source has a nature close to class i rather than class 0 , even though this source is formed in the same dense core as l1448c(n ) .",
    "one possible scenario to explain this dichotomy is the effect of the outflow from l1448c(n ) ; significant amount of material in the envelope surrounding l1448c(s ) might have been stripped off by the powerful outflow from l1448c(n ) .",
    "another possibility is the disintegration of an unstable multiple system , in which l1448c(s ) is an escaping member with a truncated disk .",

    "<S> the protostellar jet driven by l1448c was observed in the sio @xmath0=87 and co @xmath0=32 lines and 350 ghz dust continuum at @xmath11resolution with the submillimeter array ( sma ) . a narrow jet from the northern source l1448c(n ) </S>",
    "<S> was observed in the sio and the high - velocity co. the jet consists of a chain of emission knots with an inter - knot spacing of @xmath12(500 au ) and a semi - periodic velocity variation . </S>",
    "<S> these knots are likely to be the internal bow shocks in the jet beam that were formed due to the periodic variation of the ejection velocity with a period of @xmath11520 yr . </S>",
    "<S> the innermost pair of knots , which are significant in the sio map but barely seen in the co , are located at @xmath11(250 au ) from the central source , l1448c(n ) . </S>",
    "<S> since the dynamical time scale for the innermost pair is only @xmath110 yr , sio may have been formed in the protostellar wind through the gas - phase reaction , or been formed on the dust grain and directly released into the gas phase by means of shocks . </S>",
    "<S> it is found that the jet is extremely active with a mechanical luminosity of @xmath17 @xmath2 , which is comparable to the bolometric luminosity of the central source ( 7.5 @xmath2 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the mass accretion rate onto the protostar derived from the mass - loss rate is @xmath110@xmath3 @xmath4 yr@xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> such a high mass accretion rate suggests that the mass and the age of the central star are 0.030.09 @xmath4 and ( 412)@xmath610@xmath7 yr , respectively , implying that the central star is in the very early stage of protostellar evolution . </S>",
    "<S> the low - velocity co emission delineates two v - shaped shells with a common apex at l1448c(n ) . </S>",
    "<S> the kinematics of these shells are reproduced by the model of a wide opening angle wind . </S>",
    "<S> the co - existence of the highly - collimated jets and the wide - opening angle shells can be explained by the `` unified _ x_-wind model  in which highly - collimated jet components correspond to the on - axis density enhancement of the wide - opening angle wind . </S>",
    "<S> the co @xmath0=32 map also revealed the second outflow driven by the southern source l1448c(s ) located at @xmath18.3(2000 au ) from l1448c(n ) . </S>",
    "<S> although l1448c(s ) is brighter than l1448c(n ) in the mid - ir bands , the momentum flux of the outflow from l1448c(s ) is two or three orders of magnitude smaller than that of the l1448c(n ) outflow . </S>",
    "<S> it is likely that the evolution of l1448c(s ) has been strongly affected by the powerful outflow from l1448c(n ) . </S>"
