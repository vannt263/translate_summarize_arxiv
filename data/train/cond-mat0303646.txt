    "the presence of a metal surface creates electron states that do not exist in the bulk metal .",
    "for example , an electron situated at a distance @xmath0 from the metal surface experiments an attractive force , @xmath1 , equivalent to that produced by its image charge situated at distance @xmath0 inside the metal . for large @xmath0 ,",
    "the potential generated by this surface induced charge approaches the classical image potential , @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the position of the image plane ( that depends on the electronic and structural properties of the surface ) , and @xmath4 is the static dielectric constant of the surface . ] .",
    "when the metal has a surface band gap near the vacuum level , the electrons below the vacuum level are trapped between the well of the image potential and the surface barrier .",
    "these quantized states correspond to image potential states , and are spatially localized in the region in front of the surface ( see fig .",
    ".     corresponds to the pump photon and @xmath5 to the probe photon in 2ppe . on the right side",
    "we show the tail of the image potential , the densities of the surface state and first three image potential states of cu(100 ) calculated with the model potential of ref .",
    "@xcite , and their corresponding binding energies .",
    "by @xmath6 , @xmath7 and @xmath8 we denote the fermi energy , the lower edge of the energy gap and the vacuum energy.,scaledwidth=75.0% ]    metal image states typically have a large spatial extension , but barely penetrate the bulk metal .",
    "they form a rydberg - like series with energies , @xmath9 , approximately given by@xcite : @xmath10\\,,\\ ] ] where @xmath11 is a positive integer , and @xmath12 represents the quantum defect ( which depends on the position and width of the gap ) .",
    "the energy of an electron trapped in an image state and moving parallel to the surface with momentum @xmath13 is therefore : @xmath14 in contrast to bulk states , the small overlap between surface states and bulk states reduces considerably the inelastic electron scattering , leading to a long lifetime , @xmath15 , of the image states , that scales asymptotically with the quantum number @xmath11 as @xmath16@xcite . due to this fact , these states are very interesting for the study of electron correlations . furthermore , image states play an important role in the laser induced chemical control of reactivity at metal surfaces .",
    "it is therefore not surprising the considerable number of studies focusing on this subject ( see ref .",
    "@xcite and references within ) .",
    "image potential states of different surfaces have been observed experimentally@xcite . a powerful technique to measure their energy and lifetime is two - photon photoemission spectroscopy ( 2ppe)@xcite .",
    "recently , and with the advent of ultrafast laser technology it became possible to perform time - resolved 2ppe spectroscopy ( tr2ppe ) , which allowed , with the technique of quantum beat spectroscopy@xcite , the direct measurement of the lifetime of image states , even for states with large quantum number @xmath11 . the 2ppe technique is depicted schematically in fig .",
    "one photon ( pump ) , of energy @xmath17 , excites an electron from an occupied state below the fermi energy ( @xmath6 ) to an image - potential state of quantum number @xmath11 ; then a second photon ( probe ) , with energy @xmath5 , ejects the electron out of the surface , above the vacuum energy .",
    "this electron has a kinetic energy @xmath18 , that is measured in a detector far away from the surface . by varying the delay between the pump and probe pulses , the intensity of the 2ppe signal as a function of the delay will reflect the evolution of the population of the state @xmath11 . from this information",
    "it is then possible to extract the lifetime of the state @xmath11 .",
    "lifetimes of image states for different metal surfaces have been calculated in the framework of the self - energy formalism in the gw approximation@xcite .",
    "the results obtained happen to be in rather good agreement with experiments .",
    "for example , the calculated lifetime of the first three image potential states of the cu(100 ) surface are @xmath19fs , @xmath20fs , and @xmath21fs@xcite , while the experimental values are @xmath22fs , @xmath23fs , and @xmath24fs@xcite , while for the first image state of cu(111 ) surface the theoretical lifetime is @xmath25fs@xcite and the experimental is @xmath26fs@xcite .    in the present paper we present calculations on energy - resolved 2ppe spectra of cu(100 ) and cu(111 ) surfaces .",
    "our theoretical approach is based on the propagation of an electron wave - packet in an one - dimensional model potential@xcite simulating the copper surface .",
    "the finite electronic lifetimes of the image potential states are taken into account by an empirical self - energy term .",
    "the photoemission spectra are obtained through a geometrical scheme described in ref .",
    "note that in this approach the potential is fixed during the whole simulations , i.e. , the change of the electronic screening during the excitation is not taken into account .",
    "this could be important for short laser excitations as done in tr2ppe .    to assert the relevance of this approximation we also performed time - dependent simulations of the copper surface , but including the change of the hartree potential due to the electronic excitations .",
    "to model the copper surface we used a one - dimensional slab of 48 copper layers , surrounded by 290a.u . of vacuum on each side .",
    "the large portion of vacuum is necessary in order to describe the four first image potential wave functions ( see fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) .",
    "the bulk and image potentials are modeled by the 1d potential model of ref .",
    "this model reproduces the position and the width of the energy gap , as well as the energy of the surface state and of the first image potential state .",
    "furthermore , it provides a good description of the electronic structure of simple and noble metal surfaces@xcite . in this model",
    "the number of bulk states is discrete for each value of @xmath27 , and is related to the number of layers in the simulation .",
    "we do not believe that this is a major limitation , essentially because all the relevant physics occurs close to @xmath6 , while the remaining states mainly act as a polarizable background .",
    "the electrons are allowed to move and interact only in the z - direction , perpendicular to the surface , and we assume a parabolic dispersion in the parallel direction . within this approximation , the hamiltonian describing such system can be written as @xmath28 this operator is discretized in real - space using a grid - spacing of 0.2a.u , which is sufficiently small to allow for a proper description of the relevant electronic states .    at @xmath29",
    "we assume the system to be in the ground - state of the hamiltonian  ( [ hamilt0 ] ) .",
    "we then propagate this state with the new hamiltonian @xmath30 where @xmath31 describes a laser polarized in the @xmath0 direction that reads , in the length gauge , @xmath32 .",
    "the electric field is composed of a pump and a probe pulses , @xmath33 the functions @xmath34 are envelope functions of the form @xmath35",

    "@xmath38 is simply @xmath39 , while for the probe pulse @xmath40 , with @xmath41 the delay time between the pump and probe lasers . in order to take into account the finite lifetime of the image potential states we add to the hamiltonian  ( [ hamilt0 ] ) a time - independent self - energy operator of the form : @xmath42 where @xmath43 are the image potential states and @xmath44 are the inverse experimental lifetimes of each state taken from ref.@xcite .",

    "the time - propagation is performed in real - time following the method of ref.@xcite .",
    "this propagation scheme preserves unitarity for a hermitian hamiltonian , and has been proven very robust and stable in diverse applications .",

    "b the electrons are considered free outgoing particles , and are treated in momentum space . the separation between the two regions is achieved through a smooth masking function , @xmath46 , defined as one in the interior of region a and zero outside .",
    "the method consists in evolving the wave - packet in the first region with the hamiltonian  ( [ hamiltonian ] ) , and mask the orbitals at each time - step . the electrons that `` leave '' region a are then treated as free - particles and accumulated in momentum space . in mathematical terms , the evolution is performed in the following way : we start by propagating the wave - functions in regions a and b using @xmath47 ^ 2}{2}\\delta t\\right\\}\\psi_k^\\mathrm{b}(p , t ) +       \\tilde\\psi_k^\\mathrm{a}(p , t+\\delta t )    \\,,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath48 is the fourier transform of the part of the wave function @xmath49 that left region @xmath50 during the time step @xmath51 , i.e , @xmath52\\exp(-\\mathrm{i}\\hat h\\delta t)\\psi_k^\\mathrm{a}(z , t )    \\,,\\ ] ] where @xmath53 denotes the momentum .",
    "if we wait long enough after that the laser has been turned off , region b will contain those electrons that were ionized .",
    "the photo - electron spectra is then identified with : @xmath54 where @xmath55 is the total number of electrons .",
    "this method can be derived from the interpretation of the wigner transform of the one - body density matrix as a probability density@xcite .         in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] we depict the energy resolved spectra of a cu(100 ) and a cu(111 ) surfaces for both zero and finite pump - probe delay .",
    "for the ( 100 ) surface , the binding energies of the first image potential states are -0.57 , -0.18 , and -0.08ev ( see fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) , while for the ( 111 ) surface the first states are at -0.82 , -0.22 and -0.009ev .",
    "note that the second and third image states of the cu(111 ) surface are resonances .",
    "furthermore , the laser parameters used in these calculations were , for the ( 100 ) surface , @xmath56ev , @xmath57ev , @xmath58fs , and @xmath59fs , and for the ( 111 ) surface , @xmath60ev , @xmath57ev , @xmath61fs , and @xmath62fs . from these results",
    "we observe that the peaks corresponding to the first image potential state are obtained at the correct energy position .",
    "the signal due to the image states of higher quantum number can not be distinguished due to the small difference in energy that can not be resolved with our grid resolution .",
    "we also note that , for zero delay , the broadening of the peak relative to the first image potential state is larger in the case of the cu(100 ) surface than in the cu(111 ) .",
    "this is due to the fact that in the former case , the probe pulse can pump low lying energy electrons from the bulk into energy levels near the gap which can be then ejected from the surface by the pump pulse . as the cu(111 )",
    "surface has a different electronic structure , such situation does not occur@xcite .",
    "note that cu(100 ) shows an intrinsic surface state resonance , while cu(111 ) has a surface state below the fermi level . in the last case",
    ", the dominant transition happens between the occupied surface state and the first image potential state .",

    "part of the time - dependence is taken indirectly into account through the self - energy operator , but one can question how reasonable this approximation really is . in order to answer to this concern , we performed simulations in which we allowed the classical part of the electron - electron interaction ( i.e. the hartree term ) to change with time .",
