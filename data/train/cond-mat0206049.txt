    "the study of manganese oxides such as la@xmath2sr@xmath3mno@xmath4 ( lsmo ) and la@xmath2ca@xmath3mno@xmath4 ( lcmo ) has attracted considerable attention since the discovery of colossal magnetoresistance in these compounds @xcite .",
    "these materials crystallize in the perovskite - type lattice structure where the crystal field partially lifts the degeneracy of the manganese d - states .",
    "the energetically favorable three - fold degenerate @xmath0 levels are populated with localized electrons , which according to hund s rule form localized @xmath5 spins . the electronic configuration of the mn@xmath6 ions is @xmath7 with one electron in the @xmath8 orbital , which is missing in the mn@xmath9 ions .",
    "the @xmath8 electrons can move between neighboring mn ions mediated by bridging @xmath10 @xmath11 orbitals .",
    "the interplay of electronic , spin , and orbital degrees of freedom along with the mutual interactions , such as the strong hund coupling @xmath1 of the itinerant electron to localized @xmath0 spins , coulomb correlations , and electron - phonon coupling leads to a rich phase diagram including antiferromagnetic insulating , ferromagnetic metallic , and charge ordered domains @xcite .",
    "charge carriers moving in the spin and orbital background show interesting dynamical features @xcite .",
    "the electronic degrees of freedom are generally treated by a kondo - lattice model , which in the strong hund coupling limit is commonly referred to as double - exchange ( de ) model , a term first coined by zener@xcite .",
    "monte carlo ( mc ) simulations have contributed significantly to our understanding of the manganites .",

    "many publications are based on the @xmath12 limit . here",
    "we propose an effective spinless fermion model for the strong coupling limit of the kondo - lattice hamiltonian , which is equally simple as the @xmath12 limit but which still contains the crucial physical ingredients of finite @xmath1 .",

    "we derive an analytical expression for the two critical chemical potentials at which ( ps ) occurs .    for the 3d kondo - lattice model canonical uha results yield a phase diagram which displays various types of antiferromagnetic ( af ) order including spin - canting , as well as ferromagnetism ( fm ) .",
    "our finite @xmath1 results for 3d are in close agreement with those derived in the limit of infinite hund coupling @xcite . in the grand canonical ensemble",
