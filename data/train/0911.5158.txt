    "the application of hydrodynamical models to describe hadronic collisions have a long history , dating almost from the beginning of the studies of hadronic interactions@xcite . since late 80s these approaches have been revived to describe the collective features of the dynamics in heavy ion collisions at the big acceleratorsstrottman , csernai , stocker and investigate the properties of quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) .",
    "the main idea behind such approach is that from the analysis of collective flow in the dynamics , if any , we may infer the properties of the allegedly deconfined partonic matter generated in heavy ion collisions . for this",
    ", the thermalization of the partonic matter should occur in a relatively short time and space scales . until today this approach was limited to heavy ions collisions because only in these collisions a large space - time domain ,",
    "in which the energy density is sufficiently high to lead to the deconfinement and thermalization , is expected to emerge .",
    "proton - proton ( p - p ) data were used as reference to analyze these heavy ion data .    in p - p processes",
    "the system is considered too small and , so far , it was not expected to get any deconfinement nor thermalization domains .",
    "thus , any differences in behavior between the p - p and heavy ions case may ( should ) be attributed to the dense medium effects .    as mentioned above ,",
    "one of the most important signatures of the creation of such a medium is the manifestation of collective motions ( _ flows _ ) in the final state particles .",
    "the presence of any collective flow is a typical behaviour of a fluid matter .",
    "there are many ways to identify collective flows .",
    "they appear as an anisotropy in angular distribution of particles and are referred to as anisotropic flow . in experimental studies , anisotropic flows are usually analyzed in terms of the fourier expansion of the azimuthal particle distribution @xmath0 where usually @xmath1 is referred as _ direct flow _ and @xmath2 as _ _",
    "elliptic flow.__it should be noted that these anisotropic parameters are not necessarily null even for free - streaming particles , but their dependence on quantities such as , for example , impact parameter and kinematic variables will reflect the collective features of the dynamics .",
    "lhc accelerator , that is starting in geneva , will reach extreme values of energy both for heavy ions and protons , the latter being accelerated up to @xmath3  tev .",
    "it is possible that under these extreme conditions , also in proton - proton collisions the energy density will reach values high enough to allow partonic matter to survive in a deconfined state for a time long enough to thermalize and show some collective behaviour . in particular , when we consider quantum fluctuations in the incident states , such a situation may well occur and thus manifest in large multiplicity events . in this sense , collective features , if any , of the high multiplicity events may reveal interesting informations on the initial condition for high energy p - p collisions .",
    "the goal of this work is to estimate the elliptic flow for top multiplicity proton - proton events in the framework of ideal hydrodynamics and investigate if it will be possible to perform such analysis at the lhc . if viscosity is present , it has effects on collective flow and to determine the viscosity of the qgp fluid is presently one of the important problems",
    ". however , these questions are still under investigation , and in the present work , we only consider the case of an ideal fluid to avoid additional ambiguities associated to viscous theories@xcite .",
    "for simplicity , we use a factorized initial energy density profile into its longitudinal and transverse parts , as proposed by @xcite . for the transverse part",
    ", we use an energy density profile as a simple superposition of those of colliding particles as is usually done for heavy ions collisions @xcite .",
    "thus we use the formula @xmath4 + \\\\ & k(\\sqrt{s})t_{b}(x-\\frac{b}{2},y)\\left [ 1-(1-\\frac{\\sigma t_{a}(x+\\frac{b}{% 2},y)}{a})^{a}\\right ] , \\end{split } \\label{eq : etransaa}\\]]where @xmath5 and @xmath6 are the number of nucleons , @xmath7 is the nucleon - nucleon cross section and @xmath8 a collision energy dependent constant . in the case of proton - proton collisions",
    "all this is reduced to the simple expression @xmath9for the proton energy density @xmath10 , we use a gaussian distribution with a top value @xmath11 and width @xmath12  fm . @xmath13as",
    "the convolution of two gaussian is still a gaussian , our initial transverse energy density is @xmath14where all the constants ( @xmath15 ... ) are compacted together in the new constant @xmath16 .",
    "it must be noticed that the result of eq .",
    "( [ eq : etrans ] ) is completely symmetric in the transverse plane for any value of @xmath17 .",
    "we will discuss this point in more detail later in section [ sec : conc ] .",
    "for the longitudinal dimension , we proceed as in @xcite using the equation : @xmath18we are left with two free parameters , the constant @xmath16 and the longitudinal width @xmath19 .",
    "we can express the total entropy as a function of these parameters , and so relate them to the particle multiplicity .",
    "as shown in fig .",
    "( [ fig : entropia ] ) .",
    "remarkably , the results on the integrated value of @xmath2 are almost not affected by the choice of these parameters , provided that they keep the total entropy constant .",
    "furthermore , it depends explicitly on the shape of the impact region , as is discussed later .",
    "nonetheless , the momentum dependence of @xmath20 is strongly affected by those parameters ( cf .",
    "[ sec : results ] ) .",
    "we have chosen entropy values between 54005500  @xmath21 in order to reproduce the top multiplicities expected at lhc ( hijing simulations ) for such collisions .",
    "it is very important to focus on very high multiplicity events for two reasons .",
    "the first is that proton - proton collisions on average have very low multiplicity . at lhc energies for proton - proton collision",
    "we expect @xmath22 while the top multiplicity can be larger then one thousand particles . to extract any information on collectivity , the events producing a large enough amount of particles are interesting .",
    "the second reasons is that in low multiplicity events also non - flow correlations may become strong to override the elliptic flow , even if it exists .     and @xmath16 .",
    "the solid line shows the entropy region reproducing the top lhc multiplicities .",
    ", height=188 ]    fixing the total multiplicity , we further determine the parameter @xmath19 by the expected mid - rapidity multiplicity of particles .",
    "this choice leads to the values @xmath19  =  1.3 and @xmath16  =  1150  gev . in order to test the momentum dependence of @xmath2 on the parameter choice",
    ", other two sets of parameters are used in the paper : the first one ( @xmath23  gev and @xmath24 ) with very low top energy density but extremely broad distribution in the @xmath25 dimension , and the second one ( @xmath26  gev and @xmath27 ) with a very high initial energy density but almost confined in the transverse plane .    in ideal hydrodynamics",
    "the elliptic flow is proportional to the initial eccentricity of the impact region @xcite.in our case , there is a big difference from heavy ion collisions . due to the gaussian shape of the proton energy densities , the total energy density profile eq.([eq : etranspp ] )",
    "is symmetric , so that at the classical level we would not expect elliptic flow at all .",
    "it has already been shown that quantum effects on energy distribution are not much effective on large systems , such as au - au collisions @xcite but their importance grows as the size of the system is reduced , like for cu - cu collisions @xcite .",
    "so for the very small systems expected in p - p collisions , quantum fluctuations should have a crucial effect on the event - by - event energy density distribution of the created matter .",
    "we try to mimic such quantum fluctuations by simply cutting the shape of the interaction region with an elliptic shape parameterized by eccentricity @xmath28 .",
    "we thus suppose that the initial energy density for the hydrodynamical evolution as @xmath29with@xmath30according to our hypothesis , the parameter @xmath28 measures the effect of quantum fluctuation in the formation of the initial condition for ultra - high energy p - p collisions .    as for the equation of state ( eos ) , we use the one shown in fig.(fig : eos ) ( solid line ) .",
    "this eos is obtained by smoothly connecting the equations of state of the lattice qcd result in @xcite and an hadron resonance gas near @xmath31  mev .",
    "the phase transition is a cross - over . to see the effect of the eos on our results",
    ", we also test the eos with a steeper connection between these two phases ( dashed ) .     as functions of temperature for the two different equations of state.,height=151 ]    after the initial entropy distribution is generated , the time evolution of the system is followed using the smoothed particle hydrodynamic ( sph ) formalism in hyperbolic coordinate system @xcite . to calculate the elliptic flow ,",
    "we perform the commonly used sudden freeze - out through the cooper - frye procedure : when a fluid element crosses the surface defined by the temperature @xmath32 all interactions are assumed small enough so that all particles can be consider as free .",
    "the freeze - out temperature is settled at the value @xmath33  mev .",
    "tests with @xmath34 = 120  mev shows that our results are almost insensitive to the changes in the value of @xmath34 .",
    "a full 3 + 1d ideal fluid dynamics using our sph code for p - p requires at least 30  000 total number of sph particles with the kernel width @xmath35 fm @xcite . with this condition ,",
    "one collision event consumes 8 hours of calculation with a desktop pc .",
    "the overall precision of calculation is monitored by the conservation of the total energy and momentum which are kept within the relative error of @xmath36 during the whole time evolution .",
    "[ sec : conc ]    .,height=151 ]    in fig .",
    "( [ fig : v2test3100 ] ) we present the azimuthal distribution of thermal pions in the mid rapidity region @xmath37 $ ] for an initial eccentricity of 17% .",
    "the results are consistent with an elliptic flow of 2.9% , so this indicate that an elliptic flow effect could be strong enough to be experimentally measurable at lhc . in fig .",
    "( [ fig : v2b03 ] ) we show the effect of the choice of the parameters on @xmath20 for different values of initial eccentricity .",
    "as expected , the elliptic flow effect gets stronger when most of the energy density is available in the transverse plane and the integrated value of @xmath2 is proportional to the initial eccentricity @xcite .",
    "we also verify that the behavior of @xmath2 integrated over the whole rapidity domain is almost the same as that of the mid - rapidity region .",
    "if the eccentricity @xmath28 has a quantum origin in p - p collisions , we expect big fluctuations for the average value of @xmath2 for different multiplicity bins in an experiment .",
    "also , we should expect big fluctuations even in the same bin for different events , as the origin of the eccentricity is not geometrical but stochastic .",
    "we also expect the elliptic flow value to be always greater than @xmath38 , as any fluctuation in any collision contributes with a positive value of @xmath2 .",
    "however , the collective flow can only become important for large multiplicity events . from our study",
    ", we get the elliptic flow of @xmath39 if the induced eccentricity has average value of about 17% .",
    "we expect that , measurements of elliptic flow in top multiplicity events in p - p may give an important clue for the quantum fluctuation in energy density distribution at each event.the alice collaboration is developing several methods to estimate non - flow contribution to @xmath40 in p - p collisions@xcite .",
    "the most promising one seems to be the @xmath41-gap method , that consists in using the particles with pseudorapidity @xmath42 to evaluate the reaction plane and those at @xmath43 to evaluate @xmath2 .",
    "other methods are , for example , the standard event - plane method@xcite or defining the reaction plane in the direction of the leading particle at high pseudorapidity . once non - flow correlations are removed , @xmath2 can be measured . unfortunately , there are nt yet any available estimations of the precision such methods can reach in removing non - flow correlations , but it is plausible that an effect of a few percent would be visible in alice .     for an initial eccentricity of 17% ( up ) , 8.6% ( center ) and 26% ( bottom ) for the three different set of parameters ,",

    "high value of viscosity can strongly affect the value of the elliptic flow produced in proton - proton collisions , as suggested in @xcite .     for the two different eos presented in fig .",
