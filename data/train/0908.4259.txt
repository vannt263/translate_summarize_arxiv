    "anomaly - mediated supersymmetry breaking ( amsb ) models have received much attention in the literature due to their attractive properties@xcite : the soft supersymmetry ( susy ) breaking terms are completely calculable in terms of just one free parameter ( the gravitino mass , @xmath11 ) , the soft terms are real and flavor invariant , thus solving the susy flavor and @xmath12 problems , the soft terms are actually renormalization group invariant@xcite , and can be calculated at any convenient scale choice . in order to realize the amsb set - up , the hidden sector must be `` sequestered '' on a separate brane from the observable sector in an extra - dimensional universe , so that tree - level supergravity breaking terms do not dominate the soft term contributions .",
    "such a set - up can be realized in brane - worlds , where susy breaking takes place on one brane , with the visible sector residing on a separate brane .",
    "the soft susy breaking ( ssb ) terms arise from the rescaling anomaly .    in spite of its attractive features ,",
    "amsb models suffer from the well - known problem that slepton mass - squared parameters are found to be negative , giving rise to tachyonic states . the original solution to this problem",
    "is to suppose that scalars acquire as well a universal mass @xmath13 , which when added to the amsb ssb terms , renders them positive .",
    "thus , the parameter space of the `` minimal '' amsb model ( mamsb ) is given by m_0 ,  m_3/2 ,  ,  sign ( ) .",
    "an alternative set - up for amsb has been advocated in ref .",
    "@xcite , known as hypercharged anomaly - mediation ( hcamsb ) .",
    "it is a string motivated scenario which uses a similar setup as the one envisioned for amsb . in hcamsb ,",
    "susy breaking is localized at the bottom of a strongly warped hidden region , geometrically separated from the visible region where the mssm resides .",
    "the warping suppresses contributions due to tree - level gravity mediation@xcite and the anomaly mediation@xcite can become the dominant source of susy breaking in the visible sector .",
    "possible exceptions to this sequestering mechanism are gaugino masses of @xmath14 gauge symmetries  @xcite .",
    "thus , in the mssm , the mass of the bino the gaugino of @xmath15 can be the only soft susy breaking parameter not determined by anomaly mediation@xcite . depending on its size",
    ", the bino mass @xmath16 can lead to a small perturbation to the spectrum of anomaly mediation , or it can be the largest soft susy breaking parameter in the visible sector : as a result of rg evolution its effect on other soft susy breaking parameters can dominate the contribution from anomaly mediation . in extensions of the mssm , additional @xmath17s can also communicate susy breaking to the mssm sector  @xcite .",
    "besides sharing the same theoretical setup , anomaly mediation and hypercharge mediation cure phenomenological shortcomings of each other .",
    "the minimal amsb model predicts a negative mass squared for the sleptons ( and features relatively heavy squarks ) . on the other hand ,",
    "the pure hypercharge mediation suffers from negative squared masses for stops and sbottoms ( and features relatively heavy sleptons ) : see sec .",
    "[ sec : pspace ] . as a result",
    ", the combination of hypercharge and anomaly mediation leads to phenomenologically viable spectra for a sizable range of relative contributions  @xcite .",
    "we parametrize the hcamsb ssb contribution @xmath18 using a dimensionless quantity @xmath2 such that @xmath19 so that @xmath2 governs the size of the hypercharge contribution to soft terms relative to the amsb contribution .",
    "then the parameter space of hcamsb models is given by ,  m_3/2 ,  ,  sign ( ) . in the hcamsb model , we assume as usual that electroweak symmetry is broken radiatively by the large top - quark yukawa coupling . then the ssb @xmath20 term and the superpotential @xmath21 term are given as usual by the scalar potential minimization conditions which emerge from requiring an appropriate breakdown of electroweak symmetry .",
    "in hcamsb , we take the ssb terms to be of the form : m_1 & = & _ 1+m_3/2,m_a & = & m_3/2 ,  a=2 ,  3  m_i^2 & = & -14\\ { _ g+_f}m_3/2 ^ 2 a_f & = & m_3/2 , where @xmath22 , @xmath23 is the beta function for the corresponding superpotential coupling , and @xmath24 with @xmath25 the wave function renormalization constant .",
    "the wino and gluino masses ( @xmath26 and @xmath27 ) receive a contribution from the bino mass at the two loop level .",
    "thus , in pure hypercharge mediation , they are one loop suppressed compared to the scalar masses .",
    "for convenience , we assume the above ssb mass parameters are input at the gut scale , and all weak scale ssb parameters are determined by renormalization group evolution .    we have included the above hcamsb model into the isasugra subprogram of the event generator isajet v7.79@xcite . after input of the above parameter set ,",
    "isasugra then implements an iterative procedure of solving the mssm rges for the 26 coupled renormalization group equations , taking the weak scale measured gauge couplings and third generation yukawa couplings as inputs , as well as the above - listed gut scale ssb terms .",
    "isasugra implements full 2-loop rg running in the @xmath28 scheme , and minimizes the rg - improved 1-loop effective potential at an optimized scale choice @xmath29@xcite to determine the magnitude of @xmath21 and @xmath30 .",
    "all physical sparticle masses are computed with complete 1-loop corrections , and 1-loop weak scale threshold corrections are implemented for the @xmath31 , @xmath32 and @xmath33 yukawa couplings@xcite .",
    "the off - set of the weak scale boundary conditions due to threshold corrections ( which depend on the entire superparticle mass spectrum ) , necessitates an iterative up - down rg running solution .",
    "the resulting superparticle mass spectrum is typically in close accord with other sparticle spectrum generators@xcite .    once the weak scale sparticle mass spectrum is known , then sparticle production cross sections and branching fractions may be computed , and collider events may be generated .",
    "then , signatures for hcamsb at the cern lhc may be computed and compared against standard model ( sm ) backgrounds .",
    "our goal in this paper is to characterize the hcamsb parameter space and sparticle mass spectrum , and derive consequences for the cern lhc @xmath34 collider , which is expected to begin operation in fall , 2009 .",
    "some previous investigations of mamsb at lhc have been reported in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the remainder of this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : pspace ] , we calculate the allowed parameter space of hcamsb models , imposing various experimental and theoretical constraints .",
    "we also show sample mass spectra from hcamsb models , and show their variation with @xmath2 and @xmath11 .",
    "we show typical values of @xmath35 and @xmath36 that result . in sec .",
    "[ sec : lhc ] , we explore consequences of the hcamsb model for lhc sparticle searches .",
    "typically , collider events are characterized by production of high @xmath37 @xmath32 and @xmath31 quarks , along with @xmath38 and observable tracks from late decaying charginos @xmath39 . for small @xmath2",
    ", slepton pair production may be visible , while for large @xmath2 , direct @xmath40 and @xmath41 production may be visible .",
    "the lhc reach for 100 fb@xmath3 should extend up to @xmath42 ( 105 ) tev , corresponding to a reach in @xmath43 ( 2.2 ) tev , for small ( large ) values of @xmath2 .",
    "the hcamsb model should be easily distinguishable from the mamsb model at the lhc if @xmath6 is not too large , due to the presence of @xmath44 candidates in cascade decay events .",
    "the presence of these reflects the mass ordering @xmath0 in the hcamsb model , while @xmath45 in the mamsb model . in sec .",
    "[ sec : conclude ] , we present our conclusions and outlook for hcamsb models .",
    "we begin our discussion by plotting out in fig . [",

    "@xmath2 in the hcamsb model , for @xmath11 fixed at 50 tev , while taking @xmath47 , @xmath48 and @xmath49 gev . for @xmath13 and @xmath50",
    ", the yellow - shaded region yields the well - known tachyonic slepton mass - squared values , which could lead to electric charge non - conservation in the scalar potential . in mamsb , as @xmath13 increases , all the scalars increase in mass , while @xmath51 , @xmath52 and @xmath53 remain roughly constant , and the superpotential @xmath21 term decreases .",
    "the large @xmath13 limit of parameter space is reached around @xmath54 , where ewsb is no longer properly broken ( signaled by @xmath55 ) .",
    "we also see the well - known property of mamsb models that @xmath56 .",
    "in addition , an important distinction between the two models is the mass ordering which enters into the neutralino mass matrix : we find typically that @xmath0 in the hcamsb model , while @xmath1 in mamsb . thus , both models will have a wino - like @xmath57 state .",
    "however , in the hcamsb model , the @xmath58 are dominantly higgsino - like states , with @xmath59 being bino - like , while in the mamsb model , we expect @xmath60 to be bino - like with @xmath61 being higgsino - like .",
    "this mass ordering difference will give rise to a crucial distinction in lhc susy cascade decay events ( see sec .",
    "[ sec : lhc ] ) which may serve to distinguish the two models .    in the hcamsb case , as @xmath2 increases , the gut scale gaugino mass @xmath16 increases .",
    "thus , the bino mass increases with @xmath2 , while the light charginos @xmath39 and neutralino @xmath57 remain wino - like with mass fixed near @xmath26 , and the gluino remains with mass fixed at nearly @xmath62 .",
    "many of the scalar masses also vary with @xmath2 .",
    "the reason is that as @xmath2 increases , so does the gut scale value of @xmath16 .",
    "the large value of @xmath16 feeds into the scalar masses via their renormalization group equations , causing many of them to increase with @xmath2 , with the largest increases occurring for the scalars with the largest weak hypercharge assignments @xmath63 .",
    "thus , we see strong increases in the @xmath64 , @xmath65 and especially the @xmath66 masses with increasing @xmath67 .",
    "the @xmath68 squark only receives a small increase in mass , since its hypercharge value is quite small : @xmath69 . from fig .",
    "[ fig : m10]_b _ ) .",
    ", we already see an important distinction between mamsb and hcamsb models : in the former case , the @xmath65 and @xmath66 states are nearly mass degenerate , while in the latter case these states are highly split , with @xmath70 .",
    "an exception to the mass increase with @xmath2 in fig .",
    "[ fig : m10]_b _ ) . occurs in the values of @xmath71 and @xmath72 . in these cases ,",
    "the large increase in @xmath73 feeds into the rge @xmath74 term@xcite , and _ amplifies _ the top - quark yukawa coupling suppression of the @xmath75 term .",
    "since the doublet @xmath76 contains both the @xmath77 and @xmath78 states , both of these actually suffer a _ decrease _ in mass with increasing @xmath2 .",
    "thus , we expect in hcamsb models with moderate to large @xmath2 that the third generation squark states will be highly split . for large @xmath67",
    ", we expect the light third generation squarks @xmath79 and @xmath80 to be quite light , with a dominantly left- squark composition",
    ". the heavier squarks @xmath81 and @xmath82 will be quite heavy , and dominantly right - squark states .",
    "in addition , we see from fig . [ fig : m10]_b _ ) . that the superpotential @xmath21 term _ decreases _ with increasing @xmath2 .",
    "at moderate - to - large @xmath6 , the @xmath21 term is from the tree - level scalar potential minimization conditions @xmath83 .",
    "the running of @xmath84 versus energy scale @xmath85 is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : mhu ] for @xmath86 and 0.195 .",
    "we see that as @xmath2 increases , the value of @xmath87 actually decreases , leading to a small @xmath88 value .",
    "the relevant rge reads = ( - g_1 ^ 2m_1 ^ 2 -3g_2 ^ 2m_2 ^ 2 + g_1 ^ 2 s+3f_t^2 x_t ) .",
    "a large value of @xmath16 thus leads to an _ upwards _ push to @xmath84 in its early running from @xmath89 , which is only later compensated by the downward push of the yukawa - coupling term involving the top yukawa coupling @xmath90 . in the figure , for the case of @xmath91 , the weak scale value of @xmath84 is actually positive . upon adding the large 1-loop corrections to the effective potential ( due to the light top - squark ) ,",
    "the rg - improved scalar potential yields a positive value of @xmath88 .",
    "thus , in the region of large @xmath2 , where @xmath21 becomes small and comparable to @xmath26 , we expect the neutralino @xmath57 to become a mixed wino - higgsino particle , and the corresponding @xmath92 mass gap to increase beyond the value @xmath93 mev which is expected in amsb models@xcite .",
    "parameter as a function of energy scale @xmath85 for @xmath94 , @xmath95 and @xmath96 for @xmath97 tev and @xmath47 , @xmath48 in the hcamsb model . ,",
    "scaledwidth=50.0% ]    an interesting coincidence related to the rg evolution of @xmath84 in the limit where hypercharge mediation dominates is that the electroweak symmetry breaking _ requires _ the electroweak scale to be @xmath98 orders of magnitude below the scale @xmath99 ( @xmath99 may be of order the gut scale or string scale ) at which the bino mass @xmath16 is generated .",
    "if the hierarchy between the electroweak scale and @xmath99 was smaller , then a susy breaking scenario in which hypercharge mediation dominates would not be capable of triggering ewsb ( the energy interval for rg evolution would not be large enough to drive the @xmath84 parameter to negative values ) .",
    "this is a very uncommon feature among susy breaking scenarios .    for a more detailed comparison ,",
    "we list in table [ tab : cases ] the sparticle mass spectrum for a mamsb point with @xmath100 gev , @xmath97 tev , @xmath47 and @xmath48 , and two hcamsb points with small and large @xmath2 values equal to @xmath101 and @xmath96 .",
    "while all three cases have a comparable gluino mass , we see that the rather small splitting amongst @xmath102 and also @xmath103 states in mamsb is turned to large left - right splitting in the hcamsb cases .",
    "we also see that the @xmath104 mev mass gap in amsb and hcamsb1 which leads to long - lived and possibly observable @xmath105 tracks in collider detectors opens up to a few gev in the hcamsb2 case .",
    "the latter mass gap is large enough to make the @xmath105 state less long lived , although still maintaining possibly measureable tracks in collider scattering events .",
    "the value of @xmath106 versus @xmath2 is shown in fig . [",
    "fig : ctau ] , where we usually get @xmath107 mm for most @xmath2 values .",
    "the value drops to shorter lengths for large @xmath2 .",
    "the shorter travel time of the @xmath105 would distinguish the large @xmath2 hcamsb case with a mixed higgsino - wino @xmath57 state from the low @xmath2 hcamsb case where @xmath57 is instead nearly pure wino - like .",

    "in this paper , we have examined some phenomenological consequences of hypercharged anomaly - mediated susy breaking models at the lhc .",

    "we have computed sparticle branching fractions , production cross sections and expected lhc collider events , and compared against expectations for sm backgrounds .",
    "our main result was to compute the reach of the lhc for hcamsb models assuming 100 fb@xmath3 of integrated luminosity .",
    "we find an lhc reach to @xmath42 tev ( corresponding to @xmath43 tev ) for low values of @xmath2 , and a reach to @xmath108 tev ( corresponding to @xmath109 tev ) for large @xmath2 .",
    "we expect the reach for @xmath110 to be similar to the reach for @xmath48 , due to similarities in the spectra for the two cases ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : m10 ] . )",
    "we also expect the reach for large @xmath6 to be similar to the reach for low @xmath6 in the @xmath111 and @xmath112 channels ( differences in the multi - lepton channels can occur due to enhanced -ino decays to taus and @xmath32s at large @xmath6 ) .",
    "the lhc reach for hcamsb models tends to be somewhat lower than the reach for mamsb models , where ref .",
    "@xcite finds a 100 fb@xmath3 reach of @xmath113 tev for low values of @xmath13 .",
    "this is due in part because , in mamsb , the various squark states are more clustered about a common mass scale @xmath13 , while in hcamsb the squark states are highly split , with @xmath114 .",
    "the hcamsb lhc event characteristics suffer similarities and differences with generic mamsb models .",
    "both hcamsb and mamsb give rise to multi - jet plus multi - lepton plus @xmath38 event topologies , and within these event classes , it is expected that occasional hits of length a few _ cm _ will be found , arising from production of the long - lived wino - like chargino states .",
    "some of the major differences between the models include the following .",
    "a severe left - right splitting of scalar masses is expected in hcamsb , while left - right scalar degeneracy tends to occur in mamsb .",
    "this may be testable if some of the slepton states are accessible to lhc searches .",
    "it is well known that in mamsb , @xmath56 , while in hcamsb , @xmath115 , since the @xmath66 state has a large weak hypercharge quantum number .",
    "in addition , the lightest stau state , @xmath116 , is expected to be mainly a left- state in hcamsb , while it is mixed , but mainly a right- state in mamsb . while it is conceivable that the left - right mixing might be determined at lhc ( using branching fractions or tau energy distributions ) ,",
    "such measurements would be easily performed at a linear @xmath117 collider , especially using polarized beams@xcite .    in hcamsb models ,",
    "the light third generation squarks @xmath79 and @xmath80 are expected to be generically lighter than the gluino mass , and frequently much lighter .",
    "this leads to cascade decays which produce large multiplicities of @xmath32 and @xmath31 quarks in the final state .",
    "thus , in hcamsb models , a rather high multiplicity of @xmath32 jets is expected . in mamsb ,",
    "a much lower mutiplicity of @xmath32-jets is expected , although this depends also on the value of @xmath6 which is chosen .    in hcamsb models ,",
    "the @xmath14 gaugino mass @xmath16 is expected to be the largest of the gaugino masses , with a mass hierarchy of @xmath0 .",
    "this usually implies that the @xmath59 neutralino is mainly bino - like , while @xmath60 and @xmath118 are higgsino - like , and @xmath57 is wino - like .",
    "in contrast , in the mamsb model , usually the ordering is that @xmath1 , so that while @xmath57 is again wino - like , the @xmath60 state is bino - like , and @xmath118 and @xmath59 are higgsino - like .",
    "the compositions of the @xmath119 for @xmath120 will not be easy to determine at lhc , but will be more easily determined at a linear @xmath117 collider .",
    "however , the mass ordering gives rise to os dilepton distributions with a prominent @xmath121 peak in hcamsb , while such a peak should be largely absent in mamsb models ( except at large @xmath6 where there is greater mixing in the neutralino sector ) .",
    "thus , cascade decay events containing hits along with a @xmath121 peak in the os dilepton invariant mass distribution may be a smoking gun signature for hcamsb models at the lhc , at least within the lower range of @xmath6 .",
