    "charged lepton - flavor violating ( clfv ) processes , such as @xmath6 , are sensitive to physics beyond the standard model ( sm ) @xcite . while the lepton - flavor conservation is not exact in nature due to finite neutrino masses , clfv processes are quite suppressed in the standard model .",
    "thus , searches for clfv processes are a unique window to physics beyond the sm , especially , at tev scale .",
    "now the meg experiment is searching for @xmath6 @xcite , it would reach to @xmath21 for the branching ratio on the first stage , which is improvement of two orders of magnitude compared with the current bound .",
    "the comet and mu2e experiments @xcite , which are searches for @xmath2-@xmath3 conversion in nuclei , are being planed in j - parc and fermilab , respectively .",
    "it is argued that they would reach to @xmath22 for branching ratio of @xmath2-@xmath3 conversion with target @xmath23 . here , branching ratio of @xmath2-@xmath3 conversion is ratio of @xmath2-@xmath3 conversion rate over muon capture rate .",
    "searches for @xmath6 and @xmath2-@xmath3 conversion in nuclei are complementary to each other in studies of physics beyond the sm since those processes may be induced by different types of processes .",
    "the minimal supersymmetric ( susy ) standard model ( mssm ) is a leading candidate for physics beyond the sm , and clfv processes are extensively studied in the model .",
    "susy - breaking slepton mass terms are lepton - flavor violating .",
    "it is noticeable that ratios of branching ratios for clfv processes would give information of mass spectrum in the mssm , since dominant diagrams in clfv processes depend on the mass spectrum .    when susy particle masses are @xmath24  tev , the muon lfv processes , such as @xmath2-@xmath3 transition processes , @xmath6 , @xmath25 and @xmath2-@xmath3 conversion in nuclei , are generated by the gaugino - mediated contribution , which is generated by one - loop diagrams of gauginos and sleptons ( and higgsinos ) .",
    "branching ratios for the clfv processes due to the gaugino - mediated contribution are suppressed by @xmath26 , since the effective dipole interaction is dominant in the clfv processes . here , @xmath8 is a typical mass scale of the susy particles . on the other hand ,",
    "when @xmath27  tev , the higgs - mediated contribution to the processes could be sizable .",
    "the non - holomorphic lfv correction is generated to yukawa coupling of the higgs bosons at one - loop level , and it is not suppressed by @xmath8 @xcite . branching ratio of @xmath2-@xmath3 conversion in nuclei is more sensitive to the higgs - mediated contribution @xcite .",
    "thus , ratio of branching ratios for @xmath6 and @xmath2-@xmath3 conversion in nuclei is a good observable to constrain mass spectrum in the mssm , since it is sensitive to whether the gaugino - mediated or higgs - mediated contribution is dominant .    in this letter",
    "we systematically calculate the higgs - mediated contributions to clfv reactions in the mssm , and clarify the dominant process in each clfv reaction . for this purpose",

    "zee diagrams give dominant contribution to @xmath6 among various diagrams though those are of higher order .",
    "we systematically evaluate those diagrams , and find that barr ",

    "zee diagram including @xmath33 boson is dominant and branching ratio of @xmath6 is scaled by @xmath32 , not @xmath29 .",
    "this is obviously overestimated .",
    "we clarify what is wrong in their deviation .",
    "we assume that left - handed sleptons have flavor - mixing mass terms in this letter , simply because this setup is well - motivated from the susy seesaw model @xcite .",
    "extension to more general cases will be given elsewhere .",
    "this letter is organized as follows . in the next section",
    "we evaluate the higgs - mediated contribution for @xmath6 .",
    "we show ratio of the higgs - mediated and gaugino - mediated contributions . in sec .  3",

    "4 is devoted to conclusions and discussion .",
    "in the mssm , lfv in the higgs coupling originates from the non - holomorphic correction to yukawa interaction of charged leptons @xcite . by including the correction due to one - loop diagrams of gaugino and sleptons , the effective yukawa coupling is given as follows : @xmath34",
    "where @xmath35 stands for the @xmath36-th charged - lepton yukawa coupling constant at tree level and @xmath37 and @xmath38 represent right - handed and left - handed leptons , respectively , in a basis where the tree - level lepton yukawa matrix is diagonal . the non - holomorphic interaction @xmath39 @xmath40 is generated by flavor - violating slepton mass terms .",
    "as mentioned in introduction , we assumed that left - handed sleptons have flavor - violating mass terms .",
    "we parametrize @xmath39 with mass insertions ( mis ) parameters , @xmath41 , where @xmath42 is off - diagonal element of left - handed slepton mass matrix and @xmath43 is an average left - handed slepton mass .",
    "when the susy - breaking mass parameters in the mssm are taken to be a common value ( @xmath44 ) , the non - holomorphic corrections @xmath45 and @xmath39 are reduced to @xmath46 note that @xmath45 and @xmath47 do not vanish even in a limit of large masses of susy particles .",
    "this is quite different from lfv effective dipole operators induced by the gaugino - slepton loops , whose coefficients are suppressed by masses of internal susy particles .    in a mass - eigenstate basis for both leptons and higgs bosons , @xmath48 for @xmath2-@xmath3 transition is described as  @xcite @xmath49 + { \\rm h.c.}\\ , \\label{yukawa2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath50 and @xmath51 are the cp - even higgs fields ( @xmath52 ) , and @xmath53 is the cp - odd higgs field .",
    "the lfv parameter @xmath54 is given by @xmath55 .",
    "when we treat @xmath56 and @xmath57 as a perturbation , we may neglect @xmath56 of the denominator at the first order . in this letter , we set @xmath58 .    in the mssm ,",
    "lfv interaction of @xmath50 in eq .",
    "( [ yukawa2 ] ) vanishes when the masses of @xmath51 and @xmath53 go to infinity , since @xmath59 behaves as @xmath60 this comes from a fact that sm does not have lfv and the light higgs boson @xmath50 becomes sm - like in above limit .",
    "therefore the contributions from @xmath51 and @xmath53 should be included in clfv processes .",
    "now we consider the higgs - mediated contribution to @xmath61 in the mssm .",

    "i.e. _ , one chirality flip in the lepton propagator and two lepton yukawa couplings . indeed",
    "two - loop diagrams may be significant contribution . as shown in fig .",
    "[ barr zee ] , two - loop diagrams , called as barr  zee diagrams , involve only one chiral flip ( from lepton yukawa coupling ) , and hence their contribution is much larger than that at one - loop level .    [",

    "[ higgslfv ] branching ratios of higgs - mediated lfv processes are shown as a function of @xmath9 .",
    "though we include contributions from the scalar and vector operators in the evaluation of @xmath66 in addition to the dipole one , it is found from this figure that there is still tight correlation between @xmath67 and @xmath68 , @xmath69 .",
    "thus , it is a signature that dipole operator dominates these two processes . on the other hand , @xmath2-@xmath3 conversion in nuclei",
    "is dominated by tree - level higgs boson exchange , and such simple correlation does not appear , as expected .",
    "in the gaugino - mediation case , the dipole operator dominates three processes .",
    "thus , it is important to measure @xmath2-@xmath3 conversion rate for discrimination of these two cases , in addition to @xmath67 .",

    "if gaugino - mediated lfv is dominant , this ratio is about @xmath75 since dipole operator contributions dominate the clfv processes . when @xmath12 and @xmath13 , both higgs- and gaugino - mediated diagrams contribute to those processes in different way and we could give constraints @xmath76 and @xmath5 from @xmath77 .",

    "branching ratio for @xmath67 was overestimated .",
    "we showed that barr ",
    "zee diagrams including top quark are rather dominant , and those including bottom quark and tau lepton are also sizable only when @xmath5 is large .",

    "we found that the ratio is sensitive to @xmath5 and @xmath11 when @xmath12 and @xmath13 .",

    "in particular , gaugino - mediated contributions from right - handed slepton mass receive destructive interference between the bino and bino - higgsino amplitudes @xcite .",
