    "studies of dlas , therefore , probe the processes of stellar evolution in young galaxies .",
    "the large surface density of neutral hydrogen that defines dlas means these systems contain most of the star forming gas in the early universe @xcite . since the presence of heavy metals in dlas implies the existence of stars , dlas likely trace high redshift galaxies along the sight line between the qso and earth .",

    "a subset of dlas exhibit especially strong metal absorption lines .",
    "the metal - strong damped ly@xmath1  systems ( msdlas ) enable analysis of tens of elements in individual galaxies @xcite .",

    "the msdlas , therefore , are absorbers that satisfy the metal - strong criteria and also the dla criterion on @xmath2 .",
    "h06 identified a number of msdla candidates from the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) and presented higher resolution follow - up spectra of the metal - line transitions .",
    "the strong metal absorption lines of these candidates suggests a high metallicity . for many of these msdla candidates , however , the ly@xmath1  absorption line was bluer than the wavelength coverage in the sdss spectra , precluding measurements of their h i column densities .",
    "therefore , these absorption systems could not be classified as damped ly@xmath1  systems nor could the authors provide metallicity estimates for the gas .    the wavelengths covered by sdss spectra range from 3800 to 9200   @xcite .",
    "this range allows for the identification of dlas with redshifts corresponding to @xmath17 . for absorbers with 1.5 @xmath18 z@xmath19  @xmath18 2.2",

    "candidate msdlas are systems identified with strong metal lines in the sdss spectra ( or elsewhere for a few systems ) for which there was previously no ly@xmath1  coverage and/or no precise measurement of the metal column density .",
    "we refer to these candidate msdlas as cmsdlas .",
    "each cmsdla has had its spectrum taken with the mmt / bcs in order to obtain ly@xmath1  coverage .",
    "the gas identified with msdlas is analogous to the hi regions found in the milky way ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "several heavy elements detected in the gas of msdlas are also known to make up interstellar dust in the milky way and other nearby galaxies .",

    "@xcite presents the abundance ratios of previously observed msdlas showing their ratios approach solar .",
    "dust particles preferentially absorb short wavelengths of light , reddening the color of background objects . @xcite",

    "reddening has been studied in the low redshift universe where nearby galaxies can be well resolved .",
    "in contrast , the properties of dust in high redshift galaxies is very poorly constrained .",
    "qso absorption systems provide a probe for studying reddening in high redshift galaxies due to absorption of the qso s light by the dust in the absorber .",
    "a series of studies have been performed on the extinction properties of dlas beginning several decades ago ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "more recently , @xcite leveraged the large dataset afforded by sdss to examine reddening from @xmath21 dlas in the sdss - dr2 using the spectrophotometric observations .",

    "we first determine if our candidate msdlas meet the dla and/or the metal - strong criteria and then we search for reddening to see if they contain dust .",
    "we cover the observations and data reduction of our candidate msdla sample in section [ sect : obs ] .",

    "we conclude in @xmath24  [ sec : summary ] with a brief summary .",
    "we used the following criteria to select our msdla candidates for mmt / bcs spectroscopy , hereafter referred to as cmsdlas .",
    "we selected all sdss - dr5 quasars with magnitudes @xmath25 showing ` strong ' or ` very strong ' znii 2026 or siii 1808 absorption profiles at absorption redshifts @xmath26 . `",
    "strong ' is where the minimum depth of the absorption profile is @xmath27 the continuum flux , while ` very strong ' is when the minimum depth is @xmath28 the continuum flux .",
    "these designations come from visual inspection of the sdss spectra by jxp and shf and correspond to the systems with flags 4 for ` strong ' or 5 for ` very strong ' in the tables of @xcite .",
    "the minimum @xmath29 of the selection is set to @xmath30 by the blue atmospheric cutoff , so that ly@xmath1  remains accessible at optical wavelengths , while the maximum is set to 2.2 because ly@xmath1  becomes accessible in sdss data directly at higher redshifts .",
    "we then gave priority to systems satisfying the metal - strong criterion absorption in higher - resolution follow - up keck esi and hires spectra ( still lacking ly@xmath1   coverage ) , as well as to systems without follow - up data but showing particularly strong metal absorption in the sdss discovery spectra ( at redshifts @xmath26 ) .",

    "<S> we demonstrate that dust in the msdlas reddens their background quasars , with a median shift in the spectral slope of @xmath9 . assuming an smc extinction law , this implies a median reddening @xmath10mag and visual extinction @xmath11mag . </S>",
    "<S> the latter quantity yields a dust - to - gas ratio of @xmath12 , very similar to estimation for the smc . </S>",
    "<S> future studies of msdlas offer the opportunity to study the extinction , nucleosynthesis , and kinematics of the most chemically evolved , gas - rich galaxies at high @xmath8 . </S>"
