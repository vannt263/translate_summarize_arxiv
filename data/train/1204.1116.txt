    "a similar effect of increasing thermal inertia with decreased size is noted within the near earth asteroid population as well @xcite .",
    "if a beaming parameter of 1.31 ( equal to the mean from _ iras _ and _ msx _ plus a 1-sigma standard deviation ) is assumed for the 24   thermal modeling , the albedos differ from those reported here by @xmath41% and the albedos differ by @xmath11% .",

    "this magnitude discrepancy is lessened to a 0.2 magnitude offset when mpc absolute magnitudes are used to derive a projected apparent magnitude . while a systematic offset in projected apparent magnitude could be the result of the sdss using only two - body computations to calculate @xmath15 , geocentric distance ( @xmath43 ) and phase angle , the relative offset of 0.1 magnitudes between red and blue objects is accounted for in our monte carlo modelling allowance of @xmath35  0.2 magnitude variation in the optical absolute magnitude @xmath17 .      to place the albedos and diameters in the mipsgal and taurus catalogs in context , the effects of optical and ir completeness must be considered . to assess the completeness of optical asteroid surveys , we assume that they are complete to a v magnitude of 21.5 , commensurate with the 95% completeness limit from the sdss @xcite and other surveys such as the sub - kilometer asteroid diameter survey @xcite and spacewatch @xcite . assuming that an asteroid will be detected at opposition by one of a number of surveys , we utilize the relation @xmath44,$ ] and calculate the completeness limits in terms of @xmath17 in each of the four main belt asteroids zones as defined in @xcite , adopting opposition and a heliocentric distance which corresponds to the outer semimajor axis range of each respective zone .",

    "the asteroid 2002 al14 has the greatest instantaneous predicted rate of motion of 186 arcseconds per hour in this survey data and was recovered in all three epochs where sightings were predicted .",

    "this lunar - type space weathering is assumed to modify the surfaces of asteroids as well , as minimal lunar - type space weathering is needed to match ordinary chondrite spectra to the spectra of s - type asteroids @xcite .",
    "however , analysis of asteroid regolith from the hayabusa 25143 itokawa sample return mission @xcite seems to suggest that asteroid the optical properties of asteroid surfaces may be altered by a combination of radiation - induced amorphization in addition to in situ reduction of regolith iron by solar wind irradiation . whether or not the properties of the regolith dust from asteroid itokawa are representative of all asteroids in general awaits further in situ sample return confirmation @xcite .",
    "space weathering likely affects the albedo diversity we observe in our sample .",
    "such diversity can be explained if lunar - type space weathering effects , comprising micrometeor bombardment and solar wind irradiation , dominate .",
    "the distribution peak for carbonaceous asteroids is at a similar albedo for both large and small asteroids as there is insufficient iron bearing minerals for this iron sputtering on regolith particles .",
    "the high albedo tail of the small asteroid population also exhibits a greater diversity than the large asteroid population .",
    "a complication to this interpretation is that lunar - type space weathering has only been well studied with asteroids and mineralogies characteristic of the s- taxonomic type in observations and lab studies ; the effects of solar wind exposure on compositions similar to c - type asteroids have not been the subject of laboratory investigation . whether or not space weathering effects are germane is discussed further in section  [ sec : family_trends ] , where characteristics of individual dynamical families within the main belt are compared .      a population of small thermally unaltered asteroids should exist in the inner main belt if @xmath4al melting models are correct @xcite .",
    "to critically examine this hypothesis , we have analyzed the albedo - orbital distribution of asteroids in the mipsgal and taurus surveys , figure  [ fig : color_coded_albedos ] , where the bulk albedo distribution of asteroids is color coded by albedo .",
    "the bulk albedo distribution , figure  [ fig : color_coded_albedos ] ( _ left _ ) can be contaminated by dynamical family members ; for example a single family of many small s - type fragments can make the outer main belt appear silicate rich . to determine the effects of dynamical families on the heliocentric distribution of albedo types , our mipsgal and taurus catalogs were cross referenced with the dynamical family catalog of @xcite which utilized the proper elements for 293,368 asteroids to discriminate family memberships for 55 dynamical families .",
    "of these 55 dynamical families , 47 are represented in our data and only eight families have more than 20 members in our combined mipsgal and taurus albedo catalogs .",
    "figure  [ fig : color_coded_albedos ] ( _ right _ ) shows the resultant bulk albedo - orbital distribution if these dynamical families are removed .    to compare the albedo distribution of small main belt asteroids in this dataset to those large asteroids detected by _ iras _ and _ msx _ , we utilize the albedo definitions of s , x and c complex asteroids from @xcite where c - types have @xmath57 , x - types are described by a geometric albedo 0.08 @xmath58 0.15 , and s - types span the range of geometric albedos 0.15 @xmath58 0.35 .",
    "the semimajor axis distribution of each classification from _ iras _ and mipsgal / taurus is displayed in figure  [ fig : semimajor_axis_dist_all ] . though the semimajor axis distributions of s- and x - type asteroids appear similar between the _ iras _ and _ spitzer _ surveys , the c - type distributions show a marked enhancement within the inner main belt .",
    "removal of dynamical families , figure  [ fig : semimajor_axis_dist_fam_removed ] , does not markedly change in the overall semimajor axis distribution of taxonomic type .",
    "twenty - two percent ( 22% ) of all small dark ( @xmath57 ) , presumably carbonaceous , asteroids reside in the inner main belt ( 2 au @xmath59 a @xmath59 2.5 au ) .",
    "an enhancement of small c - type asteroids in the inner main belt is commensurate with the study of @xcite who find that the distribution of small c- and x - type asteroids observed by the sdss are fairly evenly distributed as a function of semimajor axis .",
    "of the 47 dynamical families represented in the _ spitzer _ mipsgal and taurus albedo catalog , eight main belt families have more than 20 family members when combined with the iras and msx albedo catalog . when albedo and diameter are compared for each dynamical family , no trends of increasing albedo with decreasing diameter",
    "are seen within the main belt population ( figures  [ fig : flora_fam ] - [ fig : themis_fam ] ) and the mean albedos of the families are consistent with the taxonomic type of their largest member , except in the case of the nysa / polana family ( table  [ table : ave_fam_alb ] ) .",
    "the nysa / polana family ( figure  [ fig : nysa_fam ] ) shows albedo evidence for what may be two taxonomic types within the family  a very low albedo c - type asteroid grouping and a high albedo , s - type group .",
    "this split between the compositions of the family has been detected in the optical , where spectroscopic results found nysa to be an s - type asteroid and polana to be a c - type asteroid @xcite .",
    "although spectroscopically it was unclear if this subdivision in compositional types extended to small diameters , we find evidence of both taxonomic types amongst the small family members .",
    "the lack of albedo trend with decreasing diameter within the main belt potentially vitiates the origin of the albedo offset between the _ iras _ and _ spitzer _ datasets arising from space weathering due to solar wind implantation on asteroid surfaces .",
    "although there is no direct way to measure asteroid age , a correlation between collisional timescale and asteroid diameter can be derived wherein the smaller asteroids are presumed to be on average younger than their larger neighbors @xcite . to explain the color offsets between ordinary chondrites and s - type asteroids , lunar - type space weathering from the solar wind irradiation has been preferred mechanism invoked ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) to account for the reddening of s - type asteroid slopes and a decrease in albedo with increasing asteroid age .",
    "the effects of space weathering are likely best understood by examining an asteroid population with a presumed common origin , such as the koronis dynamical family , whose _ spitzer _",
    "derived albedos are presented in figure  [ fig : koronis_fam ] , combined with the optical colors of asteroids within the koronis dynamical family @xcite , which indicate a trend towards a redder optical slope with increasing diameter .",
    "no trend towards an increased albedo is apparent in the 2 to 5  km diameter koronis family population observed by _",
    "spitzer _ , although @xcite argue that of a trend towards bluer colors exists in this size range .",
    "this trend , where the color reddens as a function of age but the geometric albedo shows little to no modification , is commensurate with the interpretation _ galileo _ flyby data of koronis family member , 243  ida @xcite .",
    "the _ galileo _",
    "imaging data of 243  ida shows large variations in spectroscopic absorption band depths and 1 and 2   related to @xmath60fe ; however , there is a lack of albedo variation commensurate with the varying surface color .",
    "individual @xmath61  nm diameter , irregularly shaped dust particle samples returned from the surface of the s - type nea itokawa have amorphous rims populated by _ small _ nanophase iron particles with an average size of @xmath62  nm @xcite .",
    "laboratory measurements of small ( @xmath63  nm ) nanophase iron particles indicate that these particles only redden reflectance spectra , and their presence in asteroid regolith would not result in a decreased albedo @xcite . to produce a reduction ( darkening ) of the albedo and a steeper slope to the reflectance spectra ( reddening ) requires vapor deposition of `` larger '' ( @xmath64  nm ) metallic iron nanoparticles on grain rims @xcite .",
    "the variation of spectroscopic band depths related to @xmath60fe on 243 ida without a related color variation could also be a signature derived from small nanophase iron particles deposited on the surfaces of individual regolith dust particles . in our _ spitzer",
    "_ dataset , no trend is evident correlating an increasing albedo with decreasing diameter for the koronis family and the other s - type families , including flora , eunomia and eos .",
    "hence , invoking traditional lunar - type space weathering mechanisms alone may not be sufficient to explain the relatively large albedo diversity within the small main belt asteroid population .",
    "our results wherein albedo does not change with diameter , and therefore age , coupled with results from _ galileo _ and the _ hyabusa _ mission suggests that the dominant space weathering mechanism is one which produces small nanophase iron particles .",
    "lunar - type space weathering can not be directly ruled out as the mechanism which causes space weathering within the asteroid belt .",
    "however as small nanophase iron particles do not modify the albedo , space weathering which produces these particles is insufficient to explain the relatively large fraction of small mbas in the high albedo ( @xmath65 ) tail of the main belt asteroid albedo distribution .",
    "this observation suggests that the high albedo tail of the mba albedo distribution is a function of composition , rather than space weathering .      from the mipsgal and taurus data",
    "we can directly derive a size - frequency distribution ( sfd ) slope for small asteroids .",
    "optical surveys such as the sdss @xcite and spacewatch @xcite have derived size - frequency distributions of main belt asteroids by assuming a mean albedo for all observed objects .",
    "the slope of the cumulative size frequency distributions , @xmath66 , from the relation @xmath67 , as derived by these two surveys ranges from @xmath68 to 1.8 respectively over an optical magnitude range @xmath69 .",
    "the cumulative sfd for all main belt asteroids in the _ spitzer _ mipsgal and taurus surveys is presented in figure  [ fig : cumulative_sfd ] .",
    "the sfd between 7 and 25 km can be fit by a single power - law slope of b=2.34 @xmath350.05 .",
    "the measured sfd deviates from this fitted slope by 3@xmath28 starting at 8 km .",
    "if one assumes that the break is a result of optical survey completeness , rather than a signature of the a transition between the regimes of asteroid strength dominated by material strength versus gravitational potential energy as predicted from laboratory studies @xcite , then it can be said that current optical asteroid surveys are only complete to @xmath12 8 km .",
    "removal of dynamical families from the _ spitzer _ dataset modifies the power - law slope slightly ; however , these changes in @xmath66 are less than the derived uncertainties ( @xmath70 ) .",
    "a difference between power - law sfd slopes of asteroids was noted in the g@xmath71 and r@xmath71 filter surveys by @xcite .",
    "although it was unclear if this was an effect of color or albedo , the @xcite result can be tested with the mipsgal and taurus data by using albedo as a proxy for composition .",
    "we have utilized the albedo ranges from @xcite for s- and c - type taxonomic groups and present the sfds in figure  [ fig : s_v_c_type_sfd ] .",
    "the slope of the c - type sfd between 8 and 25  km is @xmath72 , far shallower than the sfd slope of @xmath73 derived for the s - type asteroids between 8 and 25  km in the mipsgal and taurus catalogs .",
    "these _ spitzer _ results are similar to the slopes derived by @xcite , indicating that difference between the sfd slopes derived in g@xmath71 and r@xmath71 filters were likely a function of composition / taxonomic type .",
    "from the study of small main belt asteroids with _ spitzer _ , we find that some these objects are more diverse than the large main belt asteroids observed by _ iras _ and _ msx_. the mean geometric albedo for small main belt asteroids is higher than that of large main belt asteroids and the overall range of albedo variation is greater for small asteroids by a factor of 2 .",
    "the distribution of low albedo asteroids in the solar system is also very different for small and large asteroids ; only 9% of all large ( d @xmath74 10  km ) asteroids with c - type albedos are found in the inner main belt , but 24% of all small ( @xmath75  km ) asteroids with c - type albedos are found in the inner main belt .",
    "though the extreme diversity of main belt asteroid albedos could be attributed to space weathering effects , this interpretation is not supported by the albedo results within dynamical families .",
    "of the eight main belt dynamical families with more than 20 objects in the _ spitzer _ and iras catalogs , none show the clear relationship of increasing albedo with decreasing diameter characteristic of lunar - type space weathering . to determine if this diverse albedo range is caused by space weathering or compositional variations optical colors and/or spectra of these small main belt asteroids will be required to discriminate compositional taxonomies .",
    "the bulk size - frequency distribution ( sfd ) of the main belt utilizing asteroid diameters was derived directly from the _ spitzer _ survey data .",
    "this bulk sfd shows evidence for a power - law break at 8.62  km .",
    "this asteroid diameter is consistent with the break diameter found for the hilda group asteroid population @xcite and suggests that asteroid diameters of @xmath76  km lie at the transition boundary where smaller bodies are dominated by internal material strength , whereas larger bodies are bound by gravitational potential energy .",
    "this sfd break derived from measures of the small asteroid population ( diameters down to @xmath77  km ) occurs at larger diameters than those suggested from dynamical modeling of the evolution of these bodies @xcite .",
    "our _ spitzer _ results therefore provide new observational constraint for collisional models that purport to follow the evolution of rocky planetesimals over the lifetime of the solar system .",
