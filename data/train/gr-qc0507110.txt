    "the well - known regular bartnik - mckinnon ( bm ) solutions @xcite and the corresponding non - abelian black hole solutions @xcite , are asymptotically flat , static spherically symmetric solutions of su(2 ) einstein - yang - mills ( eym ) theory .",
    "they are unstable solutions , sphalerons @xcite , and are characterized by the number of nodes of the gauge field .",
    "besides these spherically symmetric solutions there are also asymptotically flat , static regular and black hole solutions , which possess only axial symmetry @xcite .",
    "these are characterized by two integers , the node number of their gauge field function(s ) , and the winding number with respect to the azimuthal angle , denoted @xmath2 .",
    "the spherically symmetric solutions have winding number @xmath5 , while the only axially symmetric solutions have winding number @xmath6 .",
    "the @xmath6 black hole solutions possess an event horizon with a slight elongation along the symmetry axis @xcite .",
    "all these eym black hole solutions exist for arbitrarily large horizon size .    in su(2 )",
    "einstein - yang - mills - higgs ( eymh ) theory with a triplet higgs field , gravitating monopole solutions and black holes with monopole hair arise @xcite . as in eym",
    "theory , the regular eymh solutions are characterized by two integers , the node number of the gauge field and the azimuthal winding number @xmath2 , which corresponds to the topological charge of the monopoles . the black hole solutions are characterized in addition by their horizon size .",
    "these eymh black hole solutions exist only up to a maximal value of the horizon size @xcite , unlike the known eym black hole solutions .",
    "eymh theory allows for further static axially symmetric solutions , representing gravitating monopole - antimonopole pair , chain and vortex solutions @xcite , which can be characterized by the azimuthal winding number @xmath2 , and by a second integer @xmath7 , related to the polar angle . for the monopole - antimonopole chains , which arise in flat space for @xmath5 and 2",
    ", the integer @xmath7 corresponds to the number of nodes of the higgs field ( and thus the number of poles on the symmetry axis ) , while in vortex solutions , which arise in flat space for winding number @xmath8 , the higgs field vanishes ( for even @xmath7 ) on @xmath9 rings centered around the symmetry axis @xcite .",
    "to all these regular solutions associated black hole solutions should exist , obtained so far only for a monopole - antimonopole pair @xcite .    in the limit of vanishing higgs expectation value , eymh solutions approach ( after rescaling ) eym solutions @xcite .",
    "interestingly , when @xmath10 and @xmath11 , new regular eym solutions appear as limiting solutions @xcite .",

    ", the @xmath4 solutions always appear in pairs . in this letter",
    "we construct the corresponding eym black hole solutions .",
    "as expected , a branch of black hole solutions is associated with each regular solution .",
    "intriguingly , the two branches of black hole solutions from a pair of regular solutions merge and end at a maximal value of the horizon size .    in the isolated horizon framework",
    "@xcite , non - abelian black hole solutions can be interpreted as bound states of regular solutions and schwarzschild black holes @xcite . furthermore , the isolated horizon framework yields a relation for the mass of non - abelian black hole solutions , representing it as the sum of the mass of the regular solution and the horizon mass of the black hole solutions @xcite .",
    "we here show that this relation is also valid for the new black holes .",
    "in particular , the two regular solutions of a given @xmath1 and @xmath2 are connected via this mass formula .    in section",
    "ii we present the eym action , the axially symmetric ansatz and the boundary conditions . in section iii we address their asymptotic and horizon properties .",
    "we present our numericl results in section iv , and we give our conclusions in section v.",
    "we consider the su(2 ) eym action @xmath16 with ricci scalar @xmath17 , field strength tensor @xmath18   \\ , \\label{fmn}\\ ] ] gauge potential @xmath19 , and gravitational and yang - mills coupling constants @xmath20 and @xmath21 , respectively .",
    "variation of the action ( [ action ] ) with respect to the metric @xmath22 leads to the einstein equations , variation with respect to the gauge potential @xmath23 to the gauge field equations .    in isotropic coordinates the static axially symmetric metric reads @xcite @xmath24 where the metric functions @xmath25 , @xmath7 and @xmath26 are functions of the coordinates @xmath27 and @xmath28 , only .",
    "the @xmath29-axis ( @xmath30 , @xmath31 ) represents the symmetry axis .",
    "regularity on the @xmath29-axis requires @xmath32 there .    for the gauge field",
    "we employ the ansatz @xcite @xmath33 \\ . \\label{gf1}\\ ] ] here the symbols @xmath34 , @xmath35 and @xmath36 denote the dot products of the cartesian vector of pauli matrices , @xmath37 , with the spatial unit vectors @xmath38 respectively .",
    "the gauge field functions @xmath39 , @xmath40 , depend on the coordinates @xmath27 and @xmath28 , only . for @xmath41 and @xmath42 , @xmath43 the spherically symmetric black hole solutions @xcite are recovered , while for @xmath3 , @xmath6 , one obtains the axially symmetric solutions of @xcite .",
    "the new black hole solutions reported here are obtained for @xmath4 . in the limit of vanishing horizon radius",
    "they converge pointwise to the globally regular solutions with the same integers @xmath1 and @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "the globally regular solutions are related to eymh solutions with @xmath44 in the limit of vanishing higgs field @xcite .",
    "the ansatz is form - invariant under the abelian gauge transformation @xcite @xmath45 we fix the gauge by choosing the gauge condition @xcite @xmath46    to obtain asymptotically flat solutions which are regular at the horizon and possess the proper symmetries , we need to impose appropriate boundary conditions @xcite .",
    "the horizon of the non - abelian black hole solutions resides at a surface of constant radial coordinate @xmath47 . at the horizon",
    "we impose the boundary conditions @xmath48 at infinity we impose @xmath49 and on the @xmath29-axis we impose @xmath50",
    "we introduce the dimensionless coordinate @xmath51 and horizon radius @xmath52 . defining the mass @xmath53 of the black hole solutions via the komar integral , the dimensionless mass @xmath54 ,",
    "is determined by the derivative of the metric function @xmath25 at infinity @xmath55    from the equations of motion it follows @xcite , that the kretschmann scalar is finite at the horizon , and that the surface gravity @xmath56 @xcite , @xmath57 is constant , as required by the zeroth law of black hole physics .",
    "expansion of the metric functions near the horizon in the form @xmath58 where @xmath59 , yields the dimensionless surface gravity @xmath60 related to @xmath56 by @xmath61 .",
    "we introduce the area parameter @xmath62 @xcite , defined via the dimensionless area of the black hole horizon @xmath63 , @xmath64    the deformation of the horizon is revealed , when the circumference of the horizon along the equator , @xmath65 , is compared to the circumference of the horizon along the poles , @xmath66 , @xmath67 since the black hole solutions have @xmath68 ( in general ) .    the isolated horizon framework @xcite yields an intriguing relation between the adm mass @xmath69 of a black hole with area parameter @xmath62 and the mass @xmath70 of the corresponding globally regular solution @xcite , @xmath71 where the ( dimensionless ) horizon mass @xmath72 is defined via @xmath73    the isolated horizon formalism further suggests to interpret a non - abelian black hole as a bound state of a regular solution and a schwarzschild black hole @xcite , @xmath74 where @xmath75 is the adm mass of the schwarzschild black hole with area parameter @xmath62 , and @xmath76 represents the binding energy of the system , @xmath77",
    "subject to the above boundary conditions , we solve the system of seven coupled non - linear partial differential equations numerically . to map spatial infinity to the finite value @xmath78 , we employ the radial coordinate @xmath79 the numerical calculations are based on the newton - raphson method , and are performed with help of the program fidisol @xcite .",
    "the equations are discretized on a non - equidistant grid in @xmath80 and @xmath28 .",
    "typical grids used have sizes @xmath81 , covering the integration region @xmath82 and @xmath83 .",
    "we construct numerically the black hole solutions for ( @xmath3 , @xmath84 ) , ( @xmath13 , @xmath85 ) and ( @xmath14 , @xmath86 ) . for @xmath3 and fixed @xmath2 a branch of black hole solutions emerges from the single globally regular solution , when the horizon radius @xmath87 is increased from zero @xcite .",
    "this branch of black hole solutions exists for arbitrarily large horizon size . when @xmath88 and @xmath89 , however , a pair of globally regular solutions exists for a given set @xmath0 .",
    "thus we find two branches of black hole solutions emerging from the corresponding globally regular solutions , when the horizon radius is increased from zero .",
    "surprisingly , the two branches do not exist for arbitrarily large horizon size .",
    "instead they merge and end at a maximal value of the horizon size , i.e. ,  at the maximal value of the area parameter @xmath90 , which depends on @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "we show the adm mass @xmath69 as a function of the area parameter @xmath62 in fig .  1",
    ". the mass increases monotonically with increasing @xmath62 . for the new solutions with @xmath88 , the maximal horizon size increases with increasing @xmath2 . at the same time",
    ", the mass difference of the two regular solutions increases , indicating a possible correlation between the soliton mass difference and the maximal horizon size .    considering the shape of the horizon , we observe that the deviation from spherical symmetry is small , though .",
    "we observe a ratio of circumferences for @xmath3 solutions of up to @xmath91 , and for @xmath13 and @xmath14 solutions of up to @xmath92 and @xmath93 , respectively , as seen in fig .  2 .",
    "thus the new black holes have a slightly more deformed horizon .",
    "the inverse surface gravity @xmath94 of the black hole solutions is exhibited in fig .",
    "3 . for @xmath3 black hole solutions the inverse surface gravity increases monotonically ( except for @xmath5 ) as a function of the area parameter @xmath62 . for @xmath13 and @xmath14 black holes it increases along the lower branch , and beyond the transition to the upper branch it decreases back to zero .",
    "our numerical results indicate , that the mass relation ( [ ash ] ) , obtained in the isolated horizon formalism , also holds for the new non - abelian black hole solutions .",
    "( in fig .  1 for each branch the corresponding regular solution is the reference point for the integration . )",
    "consequently , the mass of the regular solution on the upper branch is related to the mass of the regular solution on the lower branch via the horizon mass integral , performed along both branches .",
    "a similar result was obtained previously for eymh black holes with dipole hair @xcite .    in @xcite the mass formula @xmath95",
    "was derived and shown to hold for spherically symmetric eym solutions in @xcite .",
    "we checked that the same formula also holds for the @xmath3 axially symmetric solutions .    in fig .",
    "4 we illustrate the binding energy of the non - abelian black hole solutions . the binding energy is always calculated w.r.t .  the corresponding regular solution . consequently , for @xmath13 and @xmath14 black holes the binding energy along the upper branches is smaller than the binding energy along the lower branches .",
    "the difference in binding energy of the black hole solutions for a given set of @xmath0 at the maximal value of the area parameter represents the mass difference of the corresponding pair of regular solutions .",
    "we have constructed numerically new static axially symmetric black hole solutions of eym theory and investigated their properties .",
    "these solutions are characterized by the set of integers @xmath0 , related to the polar and azimuthal angles , respectively . in particular , we have obtained black hole solutions for @xmath13 , @xmath85 , and @xmath14 , @xmath86 .",
    "the @xmath96 solutions ( with one node ) exist most likely for any integer @xmath97 and for arbitrary horizon size .",
    "the new @xmath98 and @xmath99 solutions have lower bounds on @xmath2 , @xmath100 , and upper bounds on the horizon size . for each",
    "allowed set @xmath0 two branches of black hole solutions emerge from the two globally regular solutions and merge and end at the maximal value of the horizon size .",
    "the existence of an upper bound of the horizon radius is a surprising and interesting new feature for eym solutions .",
    "previously a maximal value of the horizon size was known only in theories with an in - built length scale already in minkowski space , hence it was conjectured , that `` there is no bound on the horizon radius of hairy , static eym black holes '' @xcite .",
    "the underlying reason for the occurrence of this maximal horizon size for the new eym black holes is yet to be understood .",
    "we expect , that the @xmath98 and @xmath99 regular and black hole solutions represent only the first sequences of new solutions , and conjecture the existence of @xmath0 regular and black hole solutions also for higher values of @xmath1 .",
    "the ( sperically symmetric ) @xmath3 black holes are unstable @xcite , and there is all reason to believe , that the new @xmath0 solutions are unstable as well .    considering the new static axially symmetric solutions from the isolated horizon formalism point of view",
    ", we have verified the mass relation between the regular and the black hole solutions , showing that the black hole mass is given by the sum of the mass of the regular solution and the horizon mass .",
    "in particular , the mass of the regular solution on the upper branch is related to the mass of the regular solution on the lower branch via the horizon mass integral , performed along both branches . interpreting the non - abelian black holes as bound states of regular solutions and schwarzschild black holes @xcite",
    ", we have obtained the binding energy of these bound systems .",
    "we note that the globally regular solutions were first obtained in eymh theory as limiting solutions for vanishing higgs field @xcite .",
    "hence we expect that eymh black holes can be found from the new eym black holes by gradually switching on the higgs field .    rotating eym black hole solutions based on the static @xmath3 black hole solutions are known @xcite .",
    "it appears straightforward to construct rotating eym black hole solutions based on the static @xmath13 and @xmath14 black hole solutions .",
    "in contrast , rotating regular eym solutions do not appear to exist @xcite , though recently the first rotating regular eymh solutions have been constructed @xcite .",
