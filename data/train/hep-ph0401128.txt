    "<S> analysis of small-@xmath0 semi - inclusive dis hadroproduction suggests that multiple parton radiation leads to a broadening of transverse momentum ( @xmath1 ) distributions beyond that predicted by a straightforward calculation in the collins - soper - sterman formalism . </S>",
    "<S> this effect can be modeled by a modification of the resummed form factor in the small-@xmath0 region . </S>",
    "<S> we discuss the impact of such a modification on the production of electroweak bosons at hadron - hadron colliders . </S>",
    "<S> we show that if substantial small-@xmath0 broadening is observed in forward @xmath2 boson production in the tevatron run-2 , it would strongly affect predicted @xmath1 distributions for @xmath3 , @xmath4 , and higgs boson production at the large hadron collider .    in the production of electroweak bosons , precise knowledge of the transverse mass @xmath5 and transverse momentum @xmath1 provides detailed information about the production process , including the mass of the boson and associated radiative corrections . at the tevatron , </S>",
    "<S> @xmath1 distributions of @xmath2 bosons offer insight into soft gluon radiation , and this information is then used for precision extraction of the @xmath3 boson mass . at the lhc , good knowledge of the transverse distribution of higgs bosons </S>",
    "<S> @xmath6 will be needed to efficiently separate higgs boson candidates from the large qcd background . </S>",
    "<S> accurate predictions for the small-@xmath1 region are obtained via resummation of large logarithms @xmath7 arising from unsuppressed soft and collinear radiation in higher orders of perturbation theory .    </S>",
    "<S> as we move from the 2 tev tevatron to the 14 tev lhc , typical values of partonic momentum fractions @xmath0 for producing @xmath3 , @xmath2 , and @xmath6 bosons become smaller , thus enhancing @xmath8 terms in higher orders of @xmath9 . </S>",
    "<S> it is not entirely known how these terms ( not included in a fixed - order cross section or conventional @xmath1 resummation ) will affect @xmath3 , @xmath2 , and @xmath6 production at the lhc energies , in part because no drell - yan @xmath1 data is available yet in the relevant region of @xmath0 of a few @xmath10 or less .    </S>",
    "<S> studies @xcite in the crossed channel of semi - inclusive deep - inelastic scattering ( sidis ) suggest that hadronic @xmath1 distributions at small @xmath0 can not be straightforwardly described within the collins - soper - sterman ( css ) resummation framework  @xcite , if the nonperturbative sudakov function behaves like its large-@xmath0 counterpart from the drell - yan process . </S>",
    "<S> a @xmath1 distribution in sidis at @xmath11 is substantially broader than the conventional css prediction . </S>",
    "<S> the broadening effect can be modeled by including an extra @xmath0-dependent term in the sudakov exponent . to describe the data , </S>",
    "<S> the extra term must grow quickly as @xmath12 . </S>",
    "<S> it noticeably contributes to the resummed form factor at intermediate impact parameters ( @xmath13 ) , which hints at its origin from perturbative physics . </S>",
    "<S> a possible interpretation of this term is that it mimics higher - order contributions of the form @xmath14 , which are not included in the resummed cross section . due to the two - scale nature of the @xmath1 resummation problem </S>",
    "<S> , the non - resummed @xmath8 terms may affect the @xmath1 distribution even when they leave no discernible trace in inclusive dis structure functions . </S>",
    "<S> the dis structure functions depend on one hard scale ( of order @xmath15 ) , while the css resummation formula ( cf . </S>",
    "<S> eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : w ] ) ) also includes contributions from large impact parameters @xmath16 ( small momentum scales ) . </S>",
    "<S> as @xmath16 becomes large , the series @xmath17 in the css formula may begin to diverge at a larger value of @xmath0 than the series @xmath18 in the inclusive structure functions . </S>",
    "<S> for this reason , transition to @xmath19-unordered ( bfkl - like @xcite ) physics may happen at larger @xmath0 in @xmath1 distributions than in inclusive ( one - scale ) observables .    </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath1 broadening discussed above was observed in semi - inclusive dis processes . in this study , we explore its possible implications for the ( crossed ) drell - yan process . </S>",
    "<S> we begin by examining the resummed transverse momentum distribution for the drell - yan process @xcite , following notations from ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite : @xmath20 here @xmath21 , the integral is the fourier transform of a resummed form factor @xmath22 given in impact parameter ( @xmath16 ) space , and @xmath23 is a regular ( finite at @xmath24 ) part of the fixed - order cross section . in the small-@xmath16 limit , </S>",
    "<S> the form factor @xmath25 is given by a product of a perturbative sudakov exponent @xmath26 and generalized parton distributions @xmath27 : @xmath28 at moderately small @xmath0 , where the representation ( [ eq : p ] ) for @xmath22 holds , we write these generalized parton distributions in the form @xmath29 where @xmath30 are coefficient functions , @xmath31 are conventional parton distributions , and @xmath32 is a commonly appearing constant factor .    </S>",
    "<S> the term @xmath33 in @xmath34 will provide an additional @xmath1 broadening , with an @xmath0 dependence specified by @xmath35 . </S>",
    "<S> for example , it may approximate @xmath0-dependent higher - order contributions that are not included in the finite - order expression for @xmath36 . </S>",
    "<S> we parametrize @xmath35 in the following functional form : @xmath37 such that @xmath38 for @xmath39 , and @xmath40 for @xmath41 . </S>",
    "<S> this parameterization ensures that the formalism reduces to the usual css form for large @xmath0 ( @xmath41 ) and introduces an additional source of @xmath1 broadening ( growing as @xmath42 ) at small @xmath0 ( @xmath39 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the parameter @xmath43 determines the magnitude of the broadening for a given @xmath0 , while @xmath44 specifies the value of @xmath0 below which the broadening effects become important . in principle , </S>",
    "<S> @xmath43 and @xmath44 may depend on the hard scale @xmath15 ; in this first study , we neglect this dependence . based on the observed dependence @xmath45 at @xmath46 in sidis energy flow data  @xcite </S>",
    "<S> , we choose @xmath47 and @xmath48 as a representative choice for our plots .    as @xmath49 , the additional broadening term in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : psmallx ] ) affects the form factor @xmath25 both at perturbative ( @xmath50 ) and nonperturbative ( @xmath51 ) impact parameters . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , the resummed cross section contains conventional non - perturbative contributions from power corrections , which become important at large impact parameters ( @xmath51 ) . </S>",
    "<S> we introduce these corrections by replacing the impact parameter @xmath16 in functions @xmath52 and @xmath36 with a variable @xmath53  @xcite and including a nonperturbative sudakov exponent @xmath54 . </S>",
    "<S> the function @xmath55 is parametrized by a 3-parameter gaussian form from a recent global fit to low - energy drell - yan and tevatron run-1 @xmath2 data @xcite . combining all the terms , </S>",
    "<S> we have : @xmath56     + ( a ) ( b ) -00pt    -00pt     + ( a ) ( b ) -00pt    -00pt    figs .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : z ] and [ fig : h ] show the comparison of the resummed cross section ( [ eq : full ] ) with the additional broadening term ( @xmath57 ) to the resummed cross section without such a term ( @xmath58 ) . </S>",
    "<S> we consider cross sections for the production of @xmath2 and @xmath6 bosons , calculated according to the procedures in refs .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite and @xcite , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> the numerical calculation was realized using the programs legacy and resbos @xcite , and with the cteq6m1 parton distribution functions  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the perturbative sudakov factor was included up to @xmath59 , and the functions @xmath36 up to @xmath60 . </S>",
    "<S> the relevant perturbative coefficients can be found in refs .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : z](a ) shows the differential distribution @xmath61 for @xmath4 boson production in the tevatron run-2 , integrated over the rapidity @xmath62 of the @xmath4 bosons . </S>",
    "<S> we observe that the distribution ( [ eq : full ] ) with the additional small-@xmath0 term ( the dashed curve ) essentially coincides with the standard css distribution ( the solid curve ) . </S>",
    "<S> when @xmath62 is integrated over the full range , both resummed cross sections are dominated by contributions from @xmath63 , where the additional broadening ( given by the function @xmath35 ) is negligible . </S>",
    "<S> for this reason , the tevatron distributions that are inclusive in @xmath62 ( e.g. , the run-1 @xmath2 boson data ) will not be able to distinguish the small-@xmath0 broadening effects from uncertainties in the nonperturbative sudakov function @xmath64 .    </S>",
    "<S> in contrast , the small-@xmath0 broadening does lead to observable differences in the @xmath1 distributions in the forward rapidity region , where one of the initial - state partons carries a smaller momentum fraction than in the central region . </S>",
    "<S> fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : z](b ) shows the cross section @xmath65 for @xmath4 bosons satisfying @xmath66 . </S>",
    "<S> the peak of the curve with @xmath57 is lower and shifted toward higher @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> while this difference was not large enough to be observed in the tevatron run-1 , it seems to be measurable in the run-2 given the improved acceptance and higher luminosity of the upgraded tevatron collider . </S>",
    "<S> the small-@xmath0 broadening is more pronounced in @xmath3 boson production due to the smaller mass of the @xmath3 boson .    </S>",
    "<S> we now turn to the lhc , where the small-@xmath0 broadening may be observed in the whole rapidity range due to the increased center - of - mass energy . </S>",
    "<S> fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : h](a ) displays the distribution @xmath65 for @xmath2 production with and without the small-@xmath0 terms . here , the difference is striking even if @xmath62 is integrated out . </S>",
    "<S> effects of a similar magnitude are present in @xmath3 boson production , and they are further enhanced in the forward regions .    the small-@xmath0 broadening is less spectacular , but visible , in the production of light standard model higgs bosons via the effective @xmath67 vertex in the limit of a heavy top quark mass . fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : h](b ) displays the resummed cross sections for production of higgs bosons with a mass @xmath68 gev for several choices of @xmath64 and the broadening term . </S>",
    "<S> we first compare cross sections for @xmath58 and @xmath57 ( thick lines ) , where the functions @xmath69 and @xmath55 are taken to be the same as in @xmath2 boson production . </S>",
    "<S> the difference between the two cross sections is not large , due to a harder @xmath1 spectrum in the higgs boson case . </S>",
    "<S> the peaking in the @xmath70-dominated @xmath6 distribution occurs at @xmath71 gev , i.e. , beyond the region where the function @xmath72 play its dominant role . </S>",
    "<S> this is different from the @xmath73-dominated @xmath2 distribution , where the peak is located at @xmath74 gev and is strongly affected by @xmath75 . </S>",
    "<S> hence , for the same function @xmath35 as in the @xmath2 boson case , the difference between the curves with and without @xmath35 is minimal .    </S>",
    "<S> the harder @xmath1 spectrum in the higgs boson case is induced by a larger leading - logarithm coefficient ( @xmath76 ) in @xmath70 channels , as compared to the leading - logarithm coefficient @xmath77 in @xmath73 channels . </S>",
    "<S> this suggests that the @xmath15-dependent part ( and possibly other terms ) of the nonperturbative sudakov function @xmath64 in higgs boson production is also multiplied by a larger color factor than in the drell - yan process . </S>",
    "<S> we estimate this effect by multiplying @xmath64 by the ratio of the leading color factors in higgs and @xmath2 boson production processes , @xmath78 ( the thin solid line ) . </S>",
    "<S> the resulting change turns out to be small because of the reduced sensitivity of the higgs boson cross section to nonperturbative contributions .    </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath8 terms may be enhanced in the case of the higgs bosons as well , due to the direct coupling of the higgs bosons to gluon ladders . at present </S>",
    "<S> , we do not have a reliable estimate of the small-@xmath0 broadening in gluon - dominated channels . </S>",
    "<S> however , this broadening would have to be quite large to affect @xmath1 of 10 - 20 gev or more , i.e. , in the region where selection cuts on the @xmath1 of the higgs boson candidates will be imposed . </S>",
    "<S> for example , increasing the function @xmath35 by a factor of two as compared to the @xmath2 boson case would lead to a distribution shown by the thin dashed line . </S>",
    "<S> while at @xmath79  gev this effect is relatively small as compared to other theory uncertainties ( e.g. , higher - order corrections ) , it may affect precision calculations of @xmath1 distributions needed to separate the higgs boson signal from the background in the @xmath80 mode .    </S>",
    "<S> additional constraints on the small-@xmath0 behavior of the resummed cross sections in the @xmath70 channel could be obtained from examination of photon pair production away from the higgs signal region . as the mass of the photon pair decreases , @xmath81 production in the gluon fusion channel via a quark box diagram becomes increasingly important . </S>",
    "<S> for instance , the subprocess @xmath82 contributes up to 40% of the total cross section at @xmath83 gev @xcite . by comparing @xmath1 distributions in @xmath84 and @xmath85 in the same region of @xmath15 , </S>",
    "<S> one may be able to separate the @xmath86 and @xmath70 components of the resummed cross section and learn about the @xmath0 dependence in the @xmath70 channel .    to summarize , we argue that a measurement of transverse momentum distributions of forward @xmath4 bosons at the tevatron will provide important clues about the physics of qcd factorization and possibly discover broadening of @xmath1 distributions associated with the transition to small-@xmath0 hadronic dynamics . based upon the analysis of @xmath1 broadening effects observed in semi - inclusive dis </S>",
    "<S> , we have estimated similar effects in the ( crossed ) processes of electroweak boson production at hadron - hadron colliders . while the estimated impact on the higgs boson cross section @xmath65 at high @xmath1 was found to be minimal </S>",
    "<S> , much larger effects may occur in @xmath3 and @xmath4 boson production in the forward region at the tevatron run-2 , and at the lhc throughout the full rapidity range . if present , the small-@xmath0 broadening will have to be taken into consideration in precision studies of electroweak boson production . </S>",
    "<S> additionally , its observation will provide insights about the transition to @xmath19-unordered ( bfkl - like ) dynamics in multi - scale distributions at hadron - hadron colliders . </S>"
