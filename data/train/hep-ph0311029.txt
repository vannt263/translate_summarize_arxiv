    "the outstanding advances witnessed by experimental cosmology have brought us to a new era where an unprecedented precision has been achieved in measuring several cosmological parameters . of particular importance",
    "is the value of the baryon - to - photon ratio , which is determined to be  @xcite @xmath1 from the latest measurements of the wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe ( wmap ) satellite .",
    "several studies have been aimed at the explanation of this small but non - vanishing quantity . among them",
    ", leptogenesis  @xcite has become the most attractive mechanism to generate the baryon asymmetry , not only because of its simplicity , but also due to its possible connection with low energy neutrino physics  @xcite .",
    "indeed , it is conceivable that the physical effects responsible for the existence of suppressed neutrino masses may simultaneously play a crucial rle in the thermal history of our universe .    from the theoretical point of view , the addition of heavy neutrino singlets to the standard model particle content is an elegant and economical way to account for small neutrino masses via the seesaw mechanism . in this framework , the simplest possibility which can lead to a successful baryogenesis relies on the out - of - equilibrium @xmath2-violating decays of heavy majorana neutrinos ( thermal leptogenesis ) .",
    "the excess of lepton number produced in these decays is then partially converted into a baryon asymmetry by the ( @xmath3)-violating sphaleron interactions , which are in thermal equilibrium for temperatures @xmath4  gev @xmath5  gev .",
    "the heavy majorana neutrino masses are rather unconstrained in the sense that they can range from a few tev up to @xmath6  gev , depending on the model considered . moreover , their spectrum may be either hierarchical , quasi - degenerate or even exactly degenerate .",
    "if the heavy majorana neutrinos have a hierarchical mass spectrum , a lower bound of @xmath7  gev can be inferred on the leptogenesis scale  @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the resonant enhancement of the leptonic @xmath0 asymmetries through the mixing of two nearly degenerate heavy majorana neutrinos  @xcite can lower their mass scale up to tev energies  @xcite .    due to the proliferation of free parameters in the high energy neutrino sector ,",
    "the link between leptogenesis and low energy phenomenology can be only established in a model dependent way . in the framework of the sm extended with three heavy majorana neutrinos one has eighteen parameters in the high - energy neutrino sector which have to be confronted with the nine low - energy parameters of the light neutrino mass matrix .",
    "a minimal version of the seesaw mechanism , based on the existence of just two heavy neutrino states , reduces the number of parameters from eighteen to eleven . but even in this case , additional assumptions ( such as the introduction of texture zeros in the dirac yukawa matrix ) are required to completely determine the high energy neutrino sector from the low energy neutrino observables  @xcite .",
    "the effective light neutrino mass matrix is in this case defined by seven independent quantities since one of the neutrinos is predicted to be massless .    in this paper",
    "we assume an exact degeneracy of the heavy majorana neutrinos at a scale which is higher than their decoupling scale .",
    "we show that , within the minimal seesaw scenario , the heavy neutrino mass splitting induced by renormalization group effects can lead to appropriate values of the @xmath0 asymmetries relevant for the computation of the cosmological baryon asymmetry in the thermal leptogenesis framework .",
    "this provides us with a simple explanation for the extremely small mass splitting which is typically required in this context .",
    "the compatibility of this framework with the presently available low - energy neutrino data is also addressed .",
    "we show that the solar and atmospheric neutrino data puts strong constraints on this scenario and already excludes its minimal version .",
    "since the radiatively induced lepton asymmetry turns out to be proportional to the charged - lepton @xmath8 yukawa coupling , an enhancement of this coupling could be sufficient to obtain the required baryon asymmetry .",
    "this can be achieved , for instance , in simple extensions of the standard model with more than one higgs doublet . in this case",
    ", the present framework could easily accommodate the low - energy neutrino data and lead to a successful leptogenesis .",
    "in the framework of the sm extended with two heavy right - handed neutrino singlets , and before the decoupling of the heavy majorana neutrino states , the leptonic sector is characterized by the lagrangian @xmath9 where @xmath10 and @xmath11 are the left - handed ( right - handed ) charged - lepton and neutrino fields , respectively ; @xmath12 is the neutral component of the sm higgs doublet .",
    "the dirac neutrino and charged - lepton yukawa coupling matrices are denoted by @xmath13 and @xmath14 , while @xmath15 stands for the @xmath16 symmetric mass matrix of the heavy right - handed neutrinos . in the basis where @xmath17 and @xmath15 are diagonal ,",
    "the neutrino sector is characterized , in general , by eleven parameters , namely the six moduli and three phases in the @xmath18 dirac neutrino yukawa coupling @xmath13 plus the two heavy neutrino masses , @xmath19 and @xmath20 .",
    "this number may be further reduced by making assumptions about the structure of @xmath21  @xcite .",
    "let us now assume that at a scale @xmath22 the heavy neutrinos are degenerate in mass , i.e. @xmath23 , with @xmath24 .",
    "we remark that in the limit of exact heavy majorana neutrino mass degeneracy , @xmath0 is not necessarily conserved . indeed , the non - vanishing of the weak - basis invariant  @xcite @xmath25 ^{3},\\label{highcpinv}\\ ] ] which is not proportional to @xmath26 , would signal a violation of @xmath0 .",
    "it is convenient to define the @xmath27 seesaw operator at @xmath28 , @xmath29 an important feature of @xmath30 is that , at any renormalization scale @xmath31 , one of its eigenvalues is zero leading to a massless neutrino at low energies .",
    "therefore , this minimal seesaw scenario predicts a hierarchical neutrino mass spectrum and , as a consequence , a detection of neutrino masses with @xmath32 would automatically rule it out , independently of the seesaw parameters .    for the cases we will be interested in , the decoupling scale of the heavy neutrino singlets is approximately @xmath33 .",
    "moreover , the rg effects in @xmath13 and @xmath15 can be neglected for the purposes of the seesaw reconstruction , although they will be crucial for leptogenesis .",
    "thus , the seesaw operator at the scale @xmath33 is well described by eq .",
    "( [ seeop ] ) , apart from an overall factor of order one .    in order to reconstruct the high energy neutrino sector in terms of the low energy parameters",
    ", we shall consider the following structure for the dirac neutrino yukawa matrix .",
    "the same analysis can be extended to other one - texture - zero dirac yukawa matrices  @xcite . ] : @xmath34 where @xmath35 are complex and @xmath36 is chosen , without loss of generality , to be real .    at low energies",
    "the effective neutrino mass matrix is given by @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the mass of the heaviest neutrino , @xmath39 is a majorana phase and @xmath40 .",
    "the matrix @xmath41 is the leptonic mixing matrix which can be conveniently parametrized in the form @xmath42 where @xmath43 , @xmath44 and @xmath45 is the @xmath0-violating dirac phase .",
    "we will restrict our analysis to the case of neutrinos with normal hierarchy @xmath46 . in this case",
    "@xmath47 the case of inverted hierarchy can be analyzed in a similar way . in all our numerical estimates",
    "we shall use the best - fit values  @xcite @xmath48 and @xmath49 , so that @xmath50 .",
    "the atmospheric and solar mixing angles are taken as @xmath51 and @xmath52 , respectively .",
    "the mixing angle @xmath53 is presently constrained to be @xmath54 at 95 % c.l ..    the effective neutrino mass operator at the decoupling scale @xmath33 can be found by running @xmath55 from the electroweak scale @xmath56 up to @xmath33 .",
    "however , in the case when the spectrum of the light neutrinos is hierarchical , these effects turn out to be irrelevant . in particular , the mixing angles and the ratio @xmath57 are stable under the rg evolution . therefore , one has @xmath58 with @xmath59  gev .",
    "this relation leads to the following simple approximation for the reconstructed dirac neutrino matrix @xmath60{cc } \\rho+x^2 & x \\left [ e^{i \\alpha/2}-\\rho e^{-i \\alpha/2}\\right]\\\\ x \\left [ e^{-i \\alpha/2}-\\rho e^{i \\alpha/2}\\right ] & 1+\\rho x^2 \\end{array } \\right\\rgroup , \\label{hnuapprox}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath61    as expected , the assumption of one texture zero allows us to reconstruct the dirac neutrino yukawa matrix ( [ ynustruc ] ) in terms of low energy observables up to an overall factor which depends on the heavy majorana neutrino mass @xmath33 . to determine the latter , additional assumptions would be required .",
    "a non - zero leptonic asymmetry can be generated if and only if the @xmath0-odd invariant @xmath63 \\nonumber\\\\     & = m_1 m_2 ( m_2 ^ 2-m_1 ^ 2)\\ , { \\rm im\\,}[h_{12}^2]\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] does not vanish  @xcite .",
    "this requires not only the heavy neutrino mass degeneracy to be lifted , but also the nonvanishing of @xmath64 $ ] at the leptogenesis scale @xmath33 .",
    "although the first condition is easily guaranteed by the running alone of @xmath15 from @xmath22 to @xmath33 , to achieve the second condition we must also include the quantum corrections due to the dirac neutrino yukawa matrix @xmath13 .",
    "indeed , the running of the right - handed neutrino mass matrix is governed by the renormalization group equation ( rge )  @xcite @xmath65 from this equation , and neglecting the running of @xmath13 , one has in the leading - log approximation @xmath66 .",
    "it is then possible to show that the trace in eq .",
    "( [ j2 ] ) is a real quantity , which leads to @xmath67 .",
    "consequently , the @xmath0-violating effects , to which the @xmath0 asymmetries are sensitive , vanish at the decoupling scale . thus , the corrections coming from the running of @xmath13 from @xmath22 to @xmath33 must be taken into account .",
    "in the basis where @xmath15 is diagonal , and assuming that the charged - lepton yukawa matrix @xmath17 is diagonal , the evolution of the right - handed neutrino mass matrix and the dirac neutrino yukawa matrix is given at one - loop enters in the calculation at the same level as the one - loop running of @xmath13 . we have numerically verified that this contribution has a negligible effect on our results .",

    "the matrix @xmath72 is antihermitian with @xmath73 the parameter @xmath74 quantifies the degree of degeneracy between @xmath19 and @xmath20 .",
    "an important feature of the system ( [ rgemrdiag])-([rmatrix ] ) is the fact that , if the heavy majorana neutrinos are exactly degenerate in mass ( @xmath75 ) at a given scale @xmath22 , then the second rge in ( [ rgemrdiag ] ) becomes singular , unless one imposes @xmath76 .",
    "the latter condition can always be satisfied by performing an additional rotation in the dirac yukawa matrix , @xmath77 with the rotation angle @xmath78 determined by the relation @xmath79 the rotated matrix @xmath80 becomes @xmath81 where @xmath82 .    according to eqs .",
    "( [ rgemrdiag ] ) , the running of the mass splitting parameter @xmath83 is determined by the equation @xmath84 given that eqs .",

    "( [ y0 ] ) , the radiatively induced mass splitting at the decoupling scale @xmath33 will be approximatively given by @xmath86 moreover , even if at the degeneracy scale @xmath22 one has @xmath87 , a nonvanishing real part will be generated by quantum corrections .",
    "the latter are easily estimated from eqs .",
    "( [ rgemrdiag ] ) , and one finds @xmath88 where @xmath89 is the @xmath8 yukawa coupling and @xmath41 is the neutrino mixing matrix defined in eq .",
    "( [ unu ] ) .",
    "the crucial ingredient for the computation of the baryon asymmetry in a leptogenesis scenario are the @xmath0 asymmetries generated by the interference of the one - loop and tree - level heavy majorana decay diagrams . in the case",
    "when the heavy majorana neutrinos are nearly degenerate in mass , these asymmetries are approximately given by  @xcite @xmath90}{16\\,\\pi\\,\\delta_n\\,h^{\\prime}_{jj}}\\left(1 + \\frac{\\gamma_i^2}{4m^2\\delta_n^2}\\right)^{-1}\\,,\\quad j=1,2\\,,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath91 are the tree - level decay widths  @xcite , at @xmath92 this contribution is very suppressed with respect to the zero - temperature mass splitting @xmath83 . ] .",

    "this question has been readdressed in recent works , where the effects on leptogenesis due to the @xmath132 processes involving gauge bosons  @xcite and thermal corrections at high temperature  @xcite have been discussed .",
    "however , since the present neutrino data fixes the decay parameters @xmath133 to be @xmath134 , the above effects turn out to be negligible and do not alter significantly the final value of the baryon asymmetry .",
    "we have considered a minimal seesaw scenario with two heavy majorana neutrinos which are degenerate in mass at a scale higher than their decoupling scale .",
    "we have shown that the heavy neutrino mass splitting , induced by radiative corrections , leads to non - zero @xmath0 asymmetries , and subsequently , to thermal leptogenesis even for heavy majorana neutrino masses as low as a few tev .",
    "however , we have seen that in the minimal extension of the sm with the addition of only two heavy majorana neutrinos , it seems difficult to reconcile the present solar and atmospheric neutrino data with the observed cosmological baryon asymmetry . on the other hand ,",
    "the analytical expressions ( [ cpapp ] ) already suggest that these constraints can be easily relaxed , for e.g. , in extensions of the sm with more than one higgs doublet , since in this case the charged - lepton yukawa couplings can be substantially enhanced .",
    "we also remark that the results obtained here depend on the specific structure of the dirac neutrino yukawa matrix .",
    "in particular , it would be interesting to disentangle the texture considered here from other seesaw textures which can lead to the same low - energy observables .",
    "a more general analysis regarding this issue will be presented elsewhere  @xcite .",
    "it would also be desirable to find a symmetry which naturally leads to degenerate heavy majorana neutrinos at high scales and , simultaneously , to the required dirac neutrino yukawa couplings .",
    "although low - energy ( tev - scale ) leptogenesis is viable in the present framework , it requires tiny dirac neutrino yukawa couplings of the order of @xmath135 , which makes it difficult to be testable at future colliders . on the other hand ,",
    "the fact that the final baryon asymmetry weakly depends on the heavy majorana neutrino scale allows one to lower this scale below the typical values ( @xmath136  gev ) required in the standard thermal leptogenesis scenarios .",
    "thus , the potential problems related with the overproduction of relic abundances , which could jeopardize the successful nucleosynthesis predictions , are avoided .",

    "@xcite appeared , where it is shown that in the supersymmetric minimal seesaw model the present mechanism is indeed viable and thermal leptogenesis is successful .",
