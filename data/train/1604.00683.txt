    "finally , we can set @xmath179    the three different bases that we are interested in have the following property : @xmath180    now we observe that the different bases can be related to each other as follows : @xmath181 non - abelian berry phase result ------------------------------    now we are in a position to determine the result of the non - abelian berry phase resulting from the hamiltonian evolution @xmath111 .",
    "the ground state wave function at @xmath140 is latexmath:[\\[\\begin{aligned }    the integer @xmath150 is determined by the tunneling amplitude @xmath183 .",

    "these commutation relations imply that the berry phase @xmath194 must be independent of the integer @xmath19 , because there is no term in @xmath111 from @xmath140 to @xmath196 , which can distinguish states with different @xmath19 .",

    "@xmath216 must be independent of @xmath19 because @xmath111 for @xmath133 commutes with all operators that can distinguish states associated with different @xmath19 ( in the @xmath210 basis ) .",
    "we therefore see that the adiabatic process gave rise to the transformation : @xmath217 , and @xmath218 is a non - topological , path - dependent contribution to the overall phase . in other words , @xmath111 implemented a unitary transformation @xmath148 as a non - abelian berry phase : @xmath219",
    "the topological protection of the above adiabatic process derives from the ability to satisfy the conditions described in eq .",
    "( [ targets])-([comrel ] ) , up to exponentially small corrections . usually , in the context of braiding of non - abelian anyons , the corrections to braiding can be made exponentially small by spatially separating the anyons arbitrarily far apart from each other compared to the correlation length of the system .    in the presence case ,",
    "the way to achieve the conditions required is to enhance the tunneling amplitudes of quasiparticles along the paths of interest .",
    "let @xmath220 and @xmath221 denote two paths , and @xmath222 , @xmath223 their lengths .",
    "the tunneling amplitudes for charge @xmath28 quasiparticles along these paths are @xmath224 , @xmath225 .",
    "we see that @xmath226 can be made exponentially larger than @xmath227 as long as the energy gap to created @xmath28 quasiparticles along @xmath220 can be made to be much less than the corresponding gap along the path @xmath221 .",
    "the ratio @xmath228 in the limit that the @xmath229 , where @xmath230 is the energy gap to creating @xmath28 quasiparticles along the path @xmath220 .    thus , the topological protection of the non - abelian berry phase results from the possibility of controlling the energy gaps of quasiparticles along paths of interest to be parametrically smaller than the energy gaps along other paths , thus exponentially enhancing the amplitude for desired tunneling paths over others . in this way , the topological robustness of the non - abelian berry phase obtained here is somewhat different from that of braiding non - abelian anyons , as the latter can approach the topological limit with exponentially small corrections by increasing the distance between the anyons ."

    "<S> we begin with a configuration where the top and bottom gates shown in fig . [ </S>",
    "<S> fig2](b ) are turned on . </S>",
    "<S> the top and bottom gates decrease the energy gap to creating charge @xmath28 quasiparticles in each layer , thus enhancing the process where charge @xmath1 quasiparticles tunnel along the line @xmath135 from one edge to another . at time @xmath136 </S>",

    "<S> thus , we have that the most dominant terms in @xmath111 for @xmath141 , are as required above .    in order for the above terms to be the most dominant terms in the hamiltonian , it is important that the gate configurations can sufficiently diminish the energy gap to creating @xmath28 quasiparticles such that even with the increase in geometric length of the paths ( e.g. @xmath142 vs. @xmath143 , the process with the longer path is favorable because of the lower energy gap of the quasiparticle . </S>",

    "<S> the unitary transformation @xmath156 is identical to the result for @xmath157 parafermion zero modes computed in @xcite .    _ practical advantages over previous proposals </S>",
    "<S>  the topological degeneracies discussed here can be induced with only a single type of backscattering term along the edge : the andreev backscattering term induced by the superconductor . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast , the parafermion zero mode proposals of ref . @xcite require the ability to gap out the edge modes in two distinct ways along a single edge , through both magnetically induced normal backscattering and the superconductivity - induced andreev backscattering , which may be challenging . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , the superconducting regions in our setup should have a diameter @xmath158 . </S>",

    "<S> @xcite , where parafermion zero modes are induced through normal interlayer backscattering , does not admit a way to read out which particular topological state the system is in through an electrostatic charge sensing measurement , and instead requires quasiparticle interferometry , which may be more difficult .    </S>",
    "<S> _ generalizations  the key ingredient in our proposal was the existence of counterpropagating @xmath160 laughlin edge modes . the @xmath161 fqh state can be viewed as a @xmath162 iqh state , together with a @xmath163 fqh state of holes . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , an electron - electron bilayer fqh state at total filling fraction @xmath164 has effectively the same properties as the @xmath17 state described here . </S>",
    "<S> the main difference is that the @xmath164 system will have an additional chiral iqh gapless edge mode along each of the boundaries . </S>",
    "<S> since this edge mode can not accommodate any fractional excitations , it has essentially no bearing on the topological degeneracy discussion . _    </S>",
    "<S> a second generalization of interest is to consider the electron - hole bilayer at @xmath17 , and to consider normal interlayer electron tunneling @xmath165 , instead of the superconductivity induced andreev tunneling . </S>",
    "<S> if the two layers have opposite spin polarization , this can be induced by coupling to a system with either magnetic order or strong spin - orbit coupling , instead of a superconductor . in this case , </S>",

    "<S> the main difference is that the topological state can not be read out through charge sensing . </S>",
    "<S> naively one might think that the topological state could instead be read out by measuring the electric dipole moment in a region . </S>",
    "<S> however the electric dipole moment is not a conserved quantity . in the limit where the bulk interlayer tunneling is zero and the superconductor </S>",
    "<S> is replaced with a system that spontaneously develops interlayer coherence through interactions , then one could envision measuring the topological state through fractional electric dipole measurements .    </S>",
