    "it has long been recognized that the effective cosmological constant @xmath0 may have contributions from a four - form field @xmath1 , and that in such case @xmath2 may vary in space and time due to brane nucleation events .",
    "this has led to various proposals for solving the cosmological constant problem , starting with the pioneering work of brown and teitelboim @xcite .",
    "these authors considered a cosmological scenario where @xmath0 is initially very large and positive , due to a large @xmath3 term .",
    "the additive constant @xmath4 in ( [ 1 ] ) is assumed to be negative , but not fine - tuned in any way , so its absolute value is expected to be of the order of some cut - off scale to the fourth power . during the cosmological evolution , @xmath0 is  neutralized \" through successive nucleation of closed 2-branes ( charged with respect to the form field ) , which decrease the value of @xmath1 , until eventually @xmath0 is relaxed down to the small observed value , @xmath5 .",
    "one problem with the original scenario is that neutralization must proceed in very small steps , so that any initially large @xmath0 can be brought to @xmath5 without overshooting into negative values .",
    "for that , the charge of the branes should be tiny , ensuring that @xmath6 at each step .",
    "also , the nucleation rate must be very small , or else the present vacuum would quickly decay .",
    "these two constraints make the relaxation process extremely slow on a cosmological time - scale .",
    "meanwhile , ordinary matter in the universe is exponentially diluted by the quasi - de sitter expansion , resulting in a disappointing empty universe .    recently , feng et al .",
    "( fmsw ) @xcite have suggested that nucleation of coincident branes may offer a solution to the  empty universe \" problem .",
    "their proposal can be summarized as follows . in the context of m - theory ,",
    "a stack of @xmath7 coincident d - branes supports a number of low energy degrees of freedom , corresponding to a @xmath8 super yang - mills ( sym ) theory living on the world - sheet .",
    "consequently , the nucleation rate of coincident branes should be accompanied by large degeneracy factors , and could in principle be enhanced with respect to the nucleation of single branes .",
    "the charge of a stack of branes can be very large even if the individual charges are small , facilitating quick jumps from @xmath0 to @xmath5 . in this way",
    ", neutralization might proceed very rapidly , perhaps in just a few  multiple \" steps of the right size .",
    "finally , the stability of the present vacuum could be due to gravitational suppression of the nucleation rate @xcite .",
    "fmsw argued , rather heuristically , that the nucleation rate of coincident branes should be enhanced by a factor of the form @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the entropy of the worldsheet sym fields .",
    "this entropy was estimated through simple thermodynamic arguments , as @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the effective number of worldsheet field degrees of freedom , and @xmath13 is the size of the brane at the time of nucleation .",
    "however it remained unclear in @xcite which temperature @xmath14 should be used for the worldsheet degrees of freedom .",
    "brane nucleation takes place in an ambient de sitter ( ds ) space characterized by a gibbons - hawking temperature @xmath15 .",
    "the region inside the closed brane has a smaller value of the effective cosmological constant , and is therefore characterized by a smaller temperature @xmath16 .",
    "feng et al .",
    "considered two alternative possibilities for the temperature of the worldsheet degrees of freedom : @xmath17 and @xmath18 .",
    "the proposed enhancement of the nucleation rate and the resulting cosmological scenarios are quite different in both cases , and therefore it seems important to try and clarify the issue of which temperature is the relevant one .    the purpose of this paper is to present a more formal derivation of the nucleation rate corresponding to multiple brane nucleation .",
    "as we shall see , the temperature relevant for the worldsheet degrees of freedom is in fact determined by the internal geometry of the worldsheet @xcite . for the coleman - de luccia ( cdl )",
    "instanton , this worldsheet is a 2 + 1 dimensional de sitter space of radius @xmath13 , and the corresponding temperature is @xmath19 . when substituted into the naive expression ( [ entro ] ) , this leads to @xmath20 , independent of @xmath13 ( and hence on the ambient ds temperatures ) . as we shall see , the actual result has a certain dependence on @xmath13 due to the anomalous infrared behaviour of light fields in the lower dimensional de sitter space , but this results only in a rather mild dependence on the ambient ds temperatures .",
    "we shall also see that de sitter space allows for a  static \" instanton which may be quite relevant to the nucleation of coincident branes .",
    "this is analogous to the instanton for thermal activation in flat space .",
    "it has a higher euclidean action than the cdl solution , and hence ( ignoring the degeneracy factor ) it seems to represent a subdominant channel of decay .",
    "however , we shall argue that , depending on the short distance behaviour of the interactions amongst the branes , the cdl instanton for coincident brane nucleation may simply not exist , and in this situation the static instanton may be the relevant one . in several respects , the static instanton appears to be better suited to the neutralization scenario proposed by feng et al . than the cdl one .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii we review different proposals for neutralization of @xmath0 via brane nucleation .",
    "section iii contains a discussion of coincident branes in 4 spacetime dimensions .",
    "these are obtained from dimensional reduction of type iia supergravity in ten dimensions . in the 4 dimensional picture ,",
    "the gravitational and four - form forces are both repulsive . however , the two are exactly balanced by the attractive force mediated by the scalar dilaton . in section iv and",
    "v we discuss the stabilization of the dilaton , which is required in a more realistic scenario .",
    "after the dilaton aquires a mass , the remaining long range forces are repulsive , rendering the stack of coincident branes unstable , or metastable at best .",
    "this has important implications , since the instanton for nucleation of coincident branes will only exist provided that some mechanism causes an attractive interbrane force at short distances .",
    "section vi contains a description of the cdl instanton for nucleation of coincident branes , highlighting a few limiting cases of interest . in section vii",
    "we discuss the corresponding degeneracy factor in the nucleation rate , and we show that its dependence on the ambient de sitter temperatures is rather mild .",
    "we also include a heuristic interpretation of this results based on the observation that the relevant temperature for the worldsheet degrees of freedom is determined by the inverse of the radius of the instanton .",
    "implications for the scenario of @xcite are briefly discussed .",
    "section viii , is devoted to a study of the ",
    "static \" instanton , where the worldsheet has the topology @xmath21 , and where the intrinsic temperature is comparable to @xmath22 . in this case",
    ", the dependence of the nucleation rate on the ambient ds temperature is exponential .",
    "coincident brane nucleation can be unsuppressed at large @xmath22 but strongly suppressed at present .",
    "our conclusions are summarized in section ix .",
    "some technical discussions are left to the appendices .",
    "to conclude this introduction , a disclaimer may be useful . for most of the paper",
    ", we shall work directly in four dimensions , and our discussion will be certainly less than rigorous from the string theory point of view . in particular , we shall model the degrees of freedom of a stack of @xmath7 coincident 2-branes by a weakly coupled @xmath8 gauge theory on the world - sheet .",
    "this may or may not correspond to a true dimensional reduction from m - theory , but it should at least represent some of the broad features of the degeneracy factors .",
    "in four dimensions , a four form can be written as @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the determinant of the metric and @xmath26 is the levi - civita symbol .",
    "this field has no propagating degrees of freedom , since in the absence of sources the equation of motion @xmath27 implies that @xmath1 is a constant .",
    "this simply gives a contribution to the effective cosmological constant which gets added to the true cosmological constant , or vacuum energy density @xmath4 , @xmath28 four - forms may couple to  charged \" 2-dimensional extended sources , or 2-branes , through a term of the form @xmath29 where the integral is over the worldsheet of the extended object and @xmath30 is the 3-form potential ( @xmath31 ) . in this case , @xmath1 changes by @xmath32 accross a brane of charge @xmath33 .",
    "consequently , @xmath1 can decay through nucleation of closed spherical branes .",
    "the process is analogous to pair creation in the presence of an electric field , and very similar to false vacuum decay in field theory @xcite .",
    "the closed brane is the boundary of a newly formed",
    " true \" vacuum bubble , where the field strength differs from the original value by the amount ( [ deltaf ] ) .",
    "after nucleation , the radius of the bubble grows with constant proper acceleration , and the volume occupied by the new phase keeps increasing .",
    "further nucleation events take place in the region with a low @xmath1 , lowering @xmath0 even further . in the absence of gravity , this ",
    "neutralization \" would proceed as long as @xmath34 , wiping out any large initial value of @xmath3 and leaving us with a large negative cosmological constant @xmath35 .",
    "of course , this is not what we want .",
    "gravitational effects can improve the picture dramatically @xcite .",
    "in particular , tunneling from flat or anti - de sitter space ( with a negative cosmological constant ) is forbidden provided that the squared tension of the branes is sufficiently large compared with the jump @xmath36 in energy density across the brane , @xmath37 here @xmath38 is the brane tension and @xmath39 is the square of the reduced planck mass . this gravitational  shutdown \" of brane nucleation could be useful , since an initially large @xmath0 may eventually get  neutralized \" to a value which is much smaller than @xmath4 in absolute value @xcite .",
    "suppose that the true cosmological constant is negative @xmath40 .",
    "as long as @xmath41 , branes keep nucleating . but once a vacuum with @xmath42 is reached , the process stops provided that eq .",
    "( [ stability ] ) is satisfied .",
    "after that , the vacuum becomes absolutely stable .",
    "brown and teitleboim conjectured that we may live in one such vacuum , where the effective cosmological constant is expected to be of the order of the energy density gap between neighboring vacua @xmath43 in this vacuum , @xmath44 , and the huge negative bare cosmological constant is almost completely cancelled by the @xmath3 contribution in the final state .    for sufficiently small charge @xmath33 , eq .",
    "( [ geo ] ) leads to a suppression of @xmath45 relative to the true vacuum energy @xmath46 , which might be helpful in solving the `` old '' fine tuning problem of the cosmological constant .",
    "particle physics models suggest @xmath47 .",
    "hence , we need @xmath48 so that the final value @xmath45 is consistent with the observed value @xmath49 . the constraint ( [ smallcharge ] ) seems rather demanding , since in the context of supergravity we would expect @xmath33 to be closer to the planck scale .",
    "this is the so - called  gap problem \" .",
    "fmsw argued that the smallness of the charge could be due to the wrapping of branes on degenerating cycles in the extra dimensions .",
    "a successful implementation of this idea has not yet been presented , but some plausibility arguments have been given in @xcite .",
    "alternatively , in a different context , it has been suggested that branes with a very tiny charge @xmath33 may arise due to symmetries of the theory .",
    "an explicit example was given in @xcite , where the branes are not fundamental objects but domain walls of a broken discrete symmetry .",
    "this same symmetry suppresses the coupling of the domain walls to the four - form @xmath1 without any fine - tuning of parameters ( see also @xcite for a fuller discussion ) .",
    "a more severe problem of the brown and teitelboim neutralization scenario , is the `` empty universe '' problem which we discussed in the introduction . by combining the condition ( [ smallcharge ] ) with the stability condition ( [ stability ] )",
    ", it can be shown that the time required to reach the value ( [ geo ] ) is huge compared with the age of the universe @xcite . by the time the effective cosmological constant would be wiped out , all other forms of matter would have also been diluted exponentially , in clear contradiction with observations . furthermore , the endpoint of neutralization would be a state with vanishing or negative effective cosmological constant , whereas the observed value @xmath50 is positive .",
    "one way around the empty universe problem is to consider a slightly different scenario , where the effective cosmological constant is  randomized \" ( rather than neutralized ) during inflation .",
    "assume , for simplicity , that the energy scale of inflation is much larger than @xmath51 .",
    "in an inflationary phase , brane nucleation processes may increase as well as decrease the value of @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "thus , @xmath0 will randomly fluctuate up and down the ladder as a result of brane nucleation .",
    "inflation is generically eternal to the future and there is an unlimited amount of time available for the randomization process to take place before thermalization @xcite .",
    "assume that the tunneling barriers are sufficiently high , so that no nucleation events happen in the last 60 e - foldings of inflation , or during the hot phase after thermalization up to the present time .",
    "in this scenario there is no empty universe problem : the local value of @xmath0 is decided many e - foldings before the end of inflation , and a wide range of values of @xmath0 will be found in distant regions of the universe , separated from each other by distances much larger than the present hubble radius . some of these regions will just happen to have a very tiny @xmath0 . in combination with anthropic",
    "selection effects , this approach may be used to explain the smallness of the observed effective cosmological constant @xcite .",
    "this may also explain the so - called cosmic time coincidence , or why do we happen to live at the time when an effective cosmological constant starts dominating @xcite .",
    "bousso and polchinski @xcite have proposed a somewhat related  randomization \" scenario which , moreover , does not rely on branes with the exceedingly small charge @xmath33 satisfying ( [ smallcharge ] ) . in the context of string theory one may expect not just one but many different four - form fluxes @xmath52 coupled to branes with different charges @xmath53 .",
    "each one of these fluxes is quantized in units of the charge , so that @xmath54 . in this case",
    ", the condition for a generic negative cosmological constant to be compensated for by the fluxes is @xmath55 .",
    "the larger the number of different fluxes , the denser is the discretuum of possible values of @xmath0 , and the easier it is to find a set of values of @xmath56 such that the above inequality is satisfied .",
    "a sufficiently dense discretuum is typically obtained provided that the number of fluxes is sufficiently large @xmath57 , even if the individual charges @xmath53 are planckian ( a smaller number of fluxes @xmath58 may be enough in a scenario with large extra dimensions , where the charges @xmath53 are suppressed with respect to the planck scale by a large internal volume effect ) . in the bousso - polchinski model ,",
    "@xmath0 is typically very large , and drives an exponential expansion at a very high energy scale .",
    "suppose we start with a single exponentially expanding domain characterized by a set of integers @xmath59 .",
    "whenever a brane of type @xmath60 nucleates in this region , the integer @xmath61 will change by one unit inside of the brane .",
    "the newly formed region will itself expand exponentially , creating a huge new domain .",
    "the nucleation of further branes within this region will cause an endless random walk of the values of @xmath59 , which will sample the whole discretuum of values of @xmath0 .",
    "eventually , a bubble will nucleate where @xmath0 is comparable to the observed value .",
    "the nucleation of this last bubble is still a high energy process , which kicks some inflaton field off its minimum , and starts a short period of inflation within this last bubble .",
    "this period of  ordinary \" inflation is necessary in order to produce the entropy we observe , thereby avoiding the empty universe problem .",
    "of course , some anthropic input is still necessary in this approach in order to explain why , out of the discretuum of possibilities , we live in a vacuum with small @xmath0 .",
    "nucleation of coincident branes would drastically modify the neutralization scenario of brown and teitelboim , as well as the randomization scenarios sketched above . as proposed in @xcite , in the case of neutralization",
    ", this modification may lead to a solution of the empty universe problem . in the randomization scenarios",
    "there is no such problem , and it is unclear whether an enhancement of the multiple brane nucleation rate is desirable at all .",
    "this enhancement would trigger large jumps in the effective cosmological constant , making the calculation of its spatial distribution more complicated than for single brane nucleation .",
    "thus , it is of interest to understand the conditions under which multiple brane nucleation is allowed , and what are the degeneracy factors which might enhance their nucleation rate relative to the nucleation of single branes . before addressing this issue",
    ", it will be convenient to present a short discussion of coincident branes .",
    "in the context of string theory , one may consider stacks of @xmath7 coincident d - p - branes .",
    "each brane in the stack has charge @xmath33 with respect to the form field @xmath30 .",
    "thus , in four noncompact dimensions , a pair of parallel 2-branes repel each other with a constant force per unit area given by @xmath62 due to the four - form field interaction .",
    "in the ten dimensional theory , the repulsive force due to @xmath63 is balanced with other contributions from the closed string sector , such as the graviton and dilaton . as a result , there are no net forces amongst the different branes on the stack .",
    "it is in principle possible to maintain this delicate balance by suitable compactification from 10 to 4 dimensions . in 4d ,",
    "the branes look like domain walls , and their interaction through the ordinary graviton leads to a mutual repulsive force given by @xcite , @xmath64 hence , both forces given by ( [ qfield ] ) and ( [ dwfield ] ) tend to push the branes apart from each other . on the other hand , some of the higher dimensional gravitational degrees of freedom are represented by scalars in 4d , and these , together with the dilaton , lead to attractive forces .",
    "let us first consider the case of d-2-branes in 10 dimensional type iia supergravity .",
    "the relevant part of the action is given by ( see e.g. @xcite ) @xmath65 - t_2\\int_\\sigma d^3\\xi \\sqrt{g_\\sigma}\\ e^{-\\phi } + \\hat q_2 \\int_\\sigma d^3\\xi\\ \\hat{\\cal a}.\\ ] ] here , @xmath66 and @xmath67 are the determinants of the 10 dimensional metric @xmath68 and of the metric induced on the worldsheet @xmath69 , respectively , whereas @xmath13 is the ricci scalar corresponding to @xmath68 .",
    "the hats on the four - form , the gauge potential , and the corresponding charge , are introduced in order to distinguish them from the four dimensional ones which will be used below , and which differ from those by constant normalization factors .",
    "compactifying on a calabi - yau manifold @xmath70 through the ansatz @xmath71 where the greek indices run from 0 to 3 , we readily obtain the following four - dimensional action : @xmath72 @xmath73 here , @xmath74 , where @xmath75 is the coordinate volume of the manifold @xmath70 , @xmath76 is the ricci scalar for the metric @xmath25 , and we have introduced two linear combinations of the internal volume modulus @xmath77 and the dilaton @xmath78 @xmath79 the field @xmath80 decouples from the branes , and shall be ignored in what follows . in ref.@xcite ,",
    "a different expression was given for the dimensionally reduced action , because no modulus was introduced for the size of the internal space .",
    "however , as we shall see , such modulus is necessary for the cancellation of forces among the branes .    a more direct route to the 4-dimensional theory ( [ reduced4d ] ) , which will be slightly more convenient for our discussion , is to start directly from 11-dimensional supergravity and compactifying on a 7 dimensional internal space .",
    "the action in eleven dimensions is given by @xmath81 - t_2\\int_\\sigma d^3\\xi \\sqrt{g_\\sigma}+ \\hat q_2 \\int_\\sigma \\",

    "for instance , a solution with two branes separated by a distance @xmath113 is given by flat space ( @xmath114 ) in the region between the branes , and by @xmath115 in the exterior region ( see fig [ fibranas ] ) .",
    "the solution corresponds to two branes of charge @xmath33 interpolating between regions with @xmath116 and @xmath117 , separated by a region with @xmath118 .",
    "[ ] [ r]@xmath116 [ ] [ l]@xmath117 [ ] [ ] @xmath118    note that the solution ( [ sandwich ] ) contains a singularity at a distance @xmath119 ( where the warp factor @xmath120 and the volume of the internal space vanish ) . in what follows , however , we shall not be interested in flat , infinite branes , such as the ones discussed above .",
    "rather , we shall be interested in compact instanton solutions of finite size , in a theory with a stabilized dilaton . in this case , the singularities due to linear potentials of the form ( [ sandwich ] ) should not arise , but the solutions discussed above should remain a good description in the vicinity of the branes .",
    "another consequence of stabilizing the dilaton is that the perfect balance of forces amongst the branes will be spoiled at distances larger than the inverse mass of the moduli , as we now discuss .",
    "as it stands , the dimensionally reduced supergravity lagrangian ( [ reduced4d ] ) [ or its generalization ( [ action4d ] ) ] is not useful for discussing the neutralization of the cosmological constant .",
    "the lagrangian does not include the bare cosmological term @xmath4 , which is precisely the subject of our interest , and the term proportional to @xmath3 does not behave as an effective cosmological constant , but rather as an exponential potential for a modulus @xmath89 ( which is not flat enough to mimick the vacuum energy ) have been thoroughly studied in the literature , and it is known that they can drive cosmological solutions with a power - law scale factor @xcite .",

    "stabilization is also desirable because the dilaton and the radion moduli ( corresponding to the size of extra dimensions ) mediate scalar interactions of gravitational strength , which are severely constrained by observations .",
    "the study of mechanisms for stabilization is currently an active topic of research ( see e.g. @xcite and references therein ) . although the details of stabilization will not be too important in our subsequent discussion , it may be nevertheless illustrative to have in mind a specific toy mechanism ( for which we do not claim any rigorous justification in the context of string theory ) .",
    "the general problem is that the potential ( [ run ] ) has no minimum and leads to a runaway dilaton . in order to create a minimum ,",
    "let us consider two contributions which may be added to ( [ run ] ) .",
    "first of all , instead of using a ricci flat internal manifold in ( [ ansatz11 ] ) we may compactify on an einstein manifold , with @xmath130 upon dimensional reduction , the curvature @xmath70 contributes an exponential term to the effective potential for @xmath89 .",
    "however , this will still not be sufficient for stabilizing the internal volume in an interesting way .",
    "in fact , as shown by nunez and maldacena @xcite , there are no static compactifications of the classical supergravity lagrangian with a positive effective four - dimensional cosmological constant @xmath131 , and so far we have added nothing to the classical lagrangian .",
    "thus , in order to implement the four dimensional situation of our interest , a third term related to quantum corrections has to be considered .",
    "following candelas and weinberg @xcite , we may consider the casimir energy of bulk fields ( we are of course assuming that supersymmetry is broken , so that the casimir contributions of bosons and fermions do not cancel each other exactly ) .    in the example considered by candelas and weinberg @xcite , besides the casimir energy term , a higher dimensional cosmological term @xmath132 was used , and the internal manifold was taken to be a space of constant positive curvature ( @xmath133 ) . in 11-d supergravity a cosmological constant is not allowed , so here we use the @xmath3 flux instead . also , we will need to compactify on a negatively curved internal manifold ( @xmath134 ) , or else the dilaton",
    "would be stabilized at negative @xmath0 .",
    "the versatility of negatively curved compactifications has been stressed in @xcite .",
    "in particular , they have the interesting property of rigidity , which means they do not lead to other moduli besides the size of the internal space .",
    "compact hyperbolic manifolds ( chm ) can be obtained from the maximally symmetric negatively curved space @xmath135 through identifications by a discrete isometry group @xmath136 .",

    "we will argue more at length in subsection d ) quantum fluctuations of fields living on the worldsheet of the brane are characterized by a temperature @xmath283 .",
    "the fluctuations in the potential are of order @xmath326 , and these correspond to a root mean squared expectation value for @xmath321 of the order @xmath327 the stability of the two - brane instanton requires that @xmath328 .",
    "otherwise , unsuppressed quantum fluctuations take the field over the barrier and the distance between the branes starts growing without bound .",
    "this requires @xmath329 if this condition is satisfied , then @xmath321 is trapped near the origin , and the branes stay together .",
    "it can be shown that for @xmath330 the field behaves as approximately massless in the range given by ( [ deltaphim ] ) , so from ( [ dsmassless ] ) its contribution to the prefactor can be estimated as @xmath331 as in the case of the massive field discussed in the previous section , this expression is only justified when @xmath332 .",
    "if @xmath322 is too large , then the field will not behave as massless in the range ( [ deltaphim ] ) , and we expect that for @xmath330 the sole effect of the field will be to renormalize the coefficients of operators such as the brane tension in the classical lagrangian",
    ". an inconvenient feature of the linear potential ( [ interaction3 ] ) is that is non - analytic at the origin , and hence an explicit calculation in the limit of large slope is not straightforward .",
    "moreover , we can not write down an expression for it in terms of the matrix operator @xmath78 , but just in terms of its eigenvalues @xmath298 .    another possibility , which is more tractable from the formal point of view , is to assume that there is an attractive interbrane potential which is quadratic at short distances . that is , as in ( [ interaction3 ] ) with @xmath206 but with a positive coefficient in front of the second term . in terms of the eigenvalues @xmath298 , which represent the displacements of the branes , we assume the following expression for the potential @xmath333 where @xmath334 and @xmath335 [ as given in eq .",

    "( [ finald ] ) has the exponential dependence on @xmath263 which counts the number of worldsheet field degrees of freedom , while the euclidean action @xmath354 behaves approximately linearly with @xmath7 .",
    "hence , as suggested in @xcite , the prefactor can be quite important in determining the nucleation rate .    in the scenario proposed in @xcite it was also desirable that the enhancement in the nucleation rate would switch off at the present time , in order to prevent the vacuum from decaying further .",
    "unfortunately , the expression ( [ finald ] ) does not seem to have this property .",
    "the prefactor depends only on the radius @xmath13 , which is itself a function of various parameters , such as the brane tension , the charge and the ambient expansion rate , as summarized in table i. according to ( [ finald ] ) , an enhancement of the nucleation rate of coincident branes will occur for @xmath359 where we have used the results of table 1 in the first step .",
    "consider first the situation where @xmath360 .",
    "note that even in the regime when @xmath361 , the dependence of the degeneracy factor on the corresponding ds temperature is only power law , and not exponential as suggested in @xcite . also , it is clear the stability of our vacuum is not guaranteed by the smallness of the present expansion rate .",
    "the enhancement will persist provided that @xmath362 , even if the ambient de sitter temperature vanishes .",
    "more worrisome is the fact that for sufficiently large @xmath7 we enter the regime where @xmath363 . in that case , we have @xmath364 which can get smaller and smaller as we increase the number of coincident branes , eventually leading to a catastrophic decay rate , regardless of the value of @xmath235 .",
    "the expression ( [ finald ] ) for the nucleation rate is valid for @xmath365 . in the opposite limit , @xmath366 , the scalars decouple , contributing a finite renormalization of the parameters in the action ( such as the brane tension and induced newton s constant ) . for completeness ,",
    "this is discussed in appendix a , where it is shown that the renormalization of parameters can have a very significant impact on the nucleation rate .      in ref .",
    "@xcite , the prefactor in the nucleation rate for the nucleation of coincident branes was estimated as an entropy enhancement @xmath367 where , from dimensional analysis , the entropy was estimated as @xmath368 per field degree of freedom .",
    "the factor @xmath369 is due to the area of the bubble , and @xmath14 is some effective temperature .",
    "although the interpretation of the prefactor as the exponential of an entropy should not be taken too literally , let us try and phrase the results of the previous subsection in this intuitive language .",
    "a particle detector following a geodesic in a de sitter space responds as if it was at rest in a thermal bath in flat space , at the temperature @xmath370 .",
    "it should be kept in mind , however , that the ds invariant quantum state is in fact a pure state , and hence rather different from a true thermal state .",
    "for instance , any two detectors in geodesic relative motion observe the same temperature , with a perfectly isotropic distribution .",
    "this is a consequence of de sitter invariance , and is in contrast with the situation in a thermal bath in flat space , where moving observers detect a temperature blue - shift in the direction of their motion relative to the bath .    the fields living on a nucleated brane will experience some thermal effects too . the bubble is embedded in a ds space characterized by a temperature @xmath22 .",
    "the interior of the bubble is also a ds space characterized by a different expansion rate , with corresponding temperature @xmath16 .",
    "the existence of two different de sitter spaces in contact with the brane led the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite to consider two different possibilities for the effective temperature of the fields on the brane : @xmath371 and @xmath372 . however , there is in fact no ambiguity in the temperature of such fields @xcite , which is determined as follows .",
    "the worldsheet of the brane is an @xmath373 of radius @xmath13 , the euclidean de sitter space in 2 + 1 dimensions . if interactions with bulk fields are neglected , brane fields are only sensitive to the geometry of the worldsheet , and do not know about the properties of the ambient space . in this approximation ,",
    "the relevant temperature is clearly the intrinsic temperature of the lower dimensional de sitter space , @xmath374 this conclusion remains unchanged when we include interactions with bulk fields .",
    "the simplest way to see this , is to consider the limiting case where gravity can be ignored and the nucleation takes place in a flat space .",
    "there , the ambient temperature vanishes @xmath375 , but the fields on the brane will feel the temperature @xmath376 , because the nucleated brane expands with constant acceleration @xmath377 .",
    "an accelerating observer in the minkowski vacuum will detect a rindler temperature @xmath378 , which happens to coincide with the intrinsic worldsheet temperature .",
    "hence , the de sitter vacuum in the 2 + 1 dimensional worldsheet is in equilibrium with the minkowski vacuum in the bulk .",
    "this conclusion is quite general , and applies also to bubbles nucleating in de sitter .",
    "the cdl instanton has an @xmath379 symmetry under euclidean rotations .",
    "this becomes an @xmath380 symmetry after analytic continuation into lorentzian time .",
    "the quantum state after bubble nucleation is expected to inherit this symmetry @xcite , and the only way to achieve it is if the fields on the brane are in their intrinsic de sitter vacuum , which is characterized by temperature @xmath376 .",
    "note that @xmath376 is a relatively high temperature .",
    "the radius of the instanton is always smaller than @xmath231 ( see table 1 ) , and therefore @xmath376 is strictly larger than @xmath22 and @xmath16 .",
    "nevertheless , the product @xmath381 , and hence the  entropy enhancement \" , is independent of the ambient de sitter temperature .",
    "as shown in the previous subsections , the independence of the prefactor @xmath212 on the ambient expansion rate is only approximate , due to the anomalous behaviour of light fields in de sitter space .",
    "this introduces a dependence of the effective action @xmath382 on the radius @xmath13 of the instanton ( which in turn may depend on @xmath235 in certain regimes ) .",
    "this dependence , however , is quite different from the one proposed in @xcite , where it was suggested that the nucleation rate of coincident branes would be enhanced at high @xmath235 , and would switch off at low @xmath235 due to the drop in ambient temperature .",
    "what we find instead is that , if the cdl instanton for nucleation of coincident branes really exists , then the corresponding degeneracy factor does not necessarily switch off .",
    "we shall return to a discussion of this point in the concluding section . before that , let us turn our attention to a different instanton , which may be relevant to the fmsw scenario .",
    "euclidean de sitter space is compact in all spacetime directions , and ( as we just discussed ) it behaves in some respects as a system at finite temperature .",
    "one may then ask whether there are instantons similar to the thermal ones in flat space .",
    "these correspond to static bubbles , in unstable equilibrium between expansion and collapse .",
    "static instantons with o(3 ) symmetry have previously been considered in a variety of contexts , notably for the description of false vacuum decay in the presence of a black hole ( see e.g. @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "the particular instanton we shall consider corresponds to pair creation of critical bubbles in de sitter , and to our knowledge it does not seem to have received much attention in the past .",
    "this is perhaps not surprising , since its action is higher than the action for the maximally symmetric cdl instanton .",
    "however , if the cdl instanton does not exist for coincident branes , the static one may turn out to be relevant once the degeneracy factors are taken into account .",
    "the energy of a critical bubble is different from zero , and consequently , the metric outside of the bubble is no longer pure de sitter , but schwarzschild - de sitter ( sds ) .",
    "the instanton is a solution of the euclidean equations of motion , with two metrics glued together at the locus of the wall , which is a surface of constant @xmath383 in the static chart of sds ( see fig .",

    "one of them , say @xmath414 , is negative and the other two are positive .",
    "the two positive roots correspond to the black hole and cosmological horizons .",

    "as we shall see , the euclidean solution is periodic in the time direction , so that time runs on a circle @xmath434 ( see fig .",
    "the geometry at the time of nucleation is obtained by slicing the compact instanton through a smooth spacelike surface which cuts the @xmath434 factor at two places , say , @xmath435 and @xmath436 .",
    "the resulting geometry contains two different bubbles separated by a distance comparable to the inverse expansion rate .      in order to calculate the temperature of the worldsheet in the static instanton",

    "the case of the static instanton in de sitter space is somewhat close to this low temperature situation , and without an explicit calculation it is not clear whether the prefactor represents an enhancement or a suppression of the nucleation rate .",
    "an interesting possibility would be that at sufficiently high gibbons - hawking temperature @xmath525 , the thermal contribution may be sufficient to restore the symmetry , creating the desired attractive force amongst the branes .",
    "this is currently under research .",
    "the static instanton presented in this section may perhaps be better suited to the scenario proposed by feng et al .",
    "@xcite , than the coleman - de luccia instanton . ignoring the degeneracy factors ,",
    "the action of the static instanton is always larger than the action of the cdl instanton . in this sense",
    ", it seems to correspond to a subdominant decay channel .",
    "however , as we have discussed in previous sections , it might well be that the cdl instanton for multiple brane nucleation simply does not exist because of the repulsive force amongst the branes .",
    "this does not exclude the possibility that in the case of the static thermal instantons the symmetry is restored at high ambient ( and worldsheet ) ds temperature @xmath526 .",
    "in this situation , the decay through nucleation of coincident branes would only be possible through the static instanton .",
    "symmetry is not restored in the case of the cdl instanton @xcite . ] at low @xmath235 , the thermal contribution might not be sufficient to restore the symmety and stacks of branes may simply not hold together , destroying the possibility of further decay by coincident brane nucleation .",
    "also , the prefactor and the euclidean action have an exponential dependence on the ambient temperature @xmath527 , and can be much suppressed at the present epoch , contributing to the stability of the present vacuum ( in contrast with the coleman - de luccia case ) .",
    "a potentially worrying aspect of coincident brane nucleation in the cdl case is whether the degeneracy factor may grow without bound as we increase the number of branes @xcite .",
    "as we have seen , this will not happen for the case of the static instanton discussed in this section , since nucleation of coincident branes can not involve arbitrarily large @xmath7 . indeed , there is a maximum value of the combined tension of the branes @xmath528 , given in eq .",
    "( [ sigmamax ] ) , beyond which the instanton simply does not exist . in this limit , the metric outside of the branes approaches the nariai solution .    from this observation",
    ", we can easily derive a bound on the maximum entropy which can be stored in the stack of branes .",
    "indeed , the static instanton represents a spherical bubble in unstable equilibrium between undeterred expansion or collapse into a black hole .",
    "the entropy can only increase when the stack of branes collapses , and hence the entropy of the coincident branes can not exceed the entropy of the nariai black hole .",
    "the stack of branes with tension @xmath529 has the same radius as the horizon of the nariai black hole , and so , the entropy of the stack of branes is bounded by one fourth of its own area , in natural units .",
    "a corollary is that the nucleation rate of coincident branes in the limit @xmath529 is bounded above by the nucleation rate of nariai black holes of the same mass .",
    "in this paper we have investigated the possibility of coincident brane nucleation by a four - form field , in connection with string motivated scenarios for the neutralization of the effective cosmological constant .    in four dimensions , and after the moduli",
    "are stabilized , the branes repel each other at distances larger than the inverse mass of the moduli . at shorter distances",
    ", their interactions will be model dependent , but in the simplest models the branes do not attract at the classical level .",
    "in this situation , it is unclear whether the coleman - de luccia ( cdl ) instanton for nucleation of coincident branes really contributes to the semiclassical decay rate , since it would have too many zero modes and negative modes .    assuming that the cdl instanton exists for the nucleation of coincident branes ( that is , assuming an attractive short range interaction amongst the branes in the stack ) , we have investigated the degeneracy factor accompanying the formula for the nucleation rate , due to the large number of worldsheet degrees of freedom .",
    "we have modeled such degrees of freedom by a weakly coupled sym @xmath8 gauge theory , which is unbroken when the branes are coincident .",
    "we find that the degeneracy factor does not depend very strongly on the ambient de sitter ( ds ) temperatures before or after the nucleation event .",
    "rather , it depends only on the radius of the instanton .",
    "hence the degeneracy factors can be quite important even when the ambient ds temperature is as low as it is today .",
    "this may indicate that nucleation of coincident branes via the cdl instanton is in fact impossible , otherwise the present vacuum would immediately decay .    if the cdl instanton for coincident branes does not exist , stacks of branes may still nucleate through a  static \" instanton which represents pair creation of critical bubbles , in unstable equilibrium between expansion and collapse .",
    "this is the analog of the instanton for thermal activation in flat space . despite the absence of a classical attractive force",
    ", the branes could be held together by thermal corrections to the interbrane potential , which tend to favor the symmetric phase ( where branes are on top of each other ) .",
    "the calculation of this thermal effective potential for the static instanton is currently under research .",
    "one may ask whether a similar symmetry restoration may not happen for the cdl instanton . in this case",
    "the calculation has been done in @xcite , where it is shown that the one loop potential does not help restoring the symmetry .",
    "so it is conceivable that the branes may stick together for the static instanton but not for the cdl instanton , in which case the former would be the relevant decay channel .    to conclude",
    ", we have presented some evidence that the  saltatory \" relaxation scenario of @xcite may be difficult to implement via the cdl instanton , since saltation would be hard to stop at present .",
    "rather , we have speculated that it may be easier to implement through the static instanton . in the scenarios proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite for the saltatory relaxation of the cosmological constant , two different possibilities were suggested for the effective temperature of the worldsheet degrees of freedom , namely @xmath530 and @xmath531 , where @xmath236 and @xmath235 are the expansion rates before and after nucleation .",
    "we have shown that for the static instanton , the relevant temperature is comparable to the ambient de sitter temperature @xmath527 before the tunneling .",
    "hence , the nucleation rate of coincident branes would be unsupressed at large ambient de sitter temperature , but exponentially suppressed at present , which is of course desirable .",
    "clearly , many issues need to be addressed before a scenario based on coincident brane nucleation can be used to successfully explain the smallness of the observed cosmological constant .",
    "a considerable advance would be to understand why the large @xmath0 relaxes to the small @xmath5 instead of plunging directly into deep ads space ( the latter jump involves a larger number of coincident branes and would be rewarded by a larger degeneracy factor ) . in ref .",
    "@xcite an explanation was offered , based on a  uniquely weak \" form of the anthropic principle . as explained in section ii",
    ", any relaxation mechanism requires the gap @xmath532 in the discretuum of @xmath0 not to be much larger than @xmath5 ( otherwise it becomes a problem to understand why , accidentally , there happens to be an allowed vacumm so close to zero , at @xmath533 ) . in @xcite",
    "it was proposed that @xmath534 with @xmath535 , saturating the above requirement .",
    "then the allowed @xmath0 would take values in the sequence @xmath536 .",
    "if we start from a large @xmath0 , then the enhancement of brane nucleation for large @xmath7 favours a jump to the lowest value in the above list which is still compatible with the existence of observers .",
    "fmsw suggested that the value @xmath537 may already be too small for observers to emerge , making the vacuum with the value @xmath5 the favourite destination .",
    "finally , one should try to embed this scenario in a cosmological context , taking into account the restrictions imposed by homogeneity and isotropy .",
    "if unsuppressed saltation happened after inflation , then we would have seen signals of it in the microwave background .",
    "indeed , bubbles which nucleate after thermalization are still rather small at the time of decoupling , and we would see different domains with different values of @xmath0 separated by fast moving stacks of branes , which would presumably cause large perturbations in the gravitational potential . hence , saltation should occur during inflation , and switch off somewhat before the end of it .",
    "this may impose certain constraints on the space of parameters such as the tension and charges of the branes , or alternatively , on the ambient temperature below which the instanton with coincident branes simply does not exist ( e.g. because thermal symmetry restoration is no longer effective ) .",
    "also , it should be clarified what might be the advantages of a saltatory  neutralization \" scenario over the  randomization \" scenarios discussed in section ii .",
    "a possible advantage is that saltatory relaxation operates very quickly , and hence it does not require eternal inflation to take place ( as required in the randomization scenarios ) .",
    "a fuller discussion of these issues is left for further research .",
    "j.g . is grateful roberto emparan and alex vilenkin for very useful discussions .",
    "a.m. was supported by a postdoctoral fellowship of the ministerio de educacin y cultura , spain .",
    "the work by j.g . was supported by cicyt research projects fpa2002 - 3598 , fpa2002 - 00748 , and dursi 2001-sgr-0061 .",
    "the expression ( [ finald ] ) for the nucleation rate is only valid for @xmath365 . for completeness , here we shall discuss the limit @xmath366 . in this case the heavy degrees of freedom decouple , and they simply contribute a finite renormalization of the parameters in front of different operators in the classical lagrangian .    for scalar fields we have @xmath538",
    "as discussed in section vii , the first term in this expansion corresponds to a finite renormalization of the brane tension , multiplied by the worldvolume of the stack of branes .",
    "the second term correspond to a finite renormalization of the coefficient in front of the worldsheet ricci scalar .",
    "this term was not present in the classical action we started with , but evidently it can be generated by quantum corrections .",
    "the scalar contribution ( [ effacscalar ] ) tends to decrease the tension of the stack of branes .",
    "this tends to favour the nucleation rate at large @xmath539 , as represented in fig .",
    "[ prefactor ]",
    ". however , whether an actual enhancement really occurs will be model dependent , since all massive species , and not just the scalars , contribute finite renormalizations of the parameters in the action . in section vii",
    "we have assumed that there is an attractive short range force amongst the branes , which we have modeled as a mass term for the scalars representing the relative positions of the branes .",
    "one may expect that the same mechanism which generates a potential for the scalars may generate masses also for their fermionic partners . from ( [ wpsi ] ) ,",
    "heavy fermions give a contribution to the effective potential of the form @xmath540 per degree of freedom .",
    "this gives a positive renormalization of the brane tension ( which tends to suppress the nucleation rate ) .",
    "in the special case where @xmath541 , the brane tension does not renormalize , but each pair of fields will still contribute a finite renormalization of the subleading term @xmath542 which would suppress the nucleation rate .",
    "generically , however , scalars and fermions may wind up with different masses ( since supersymmetry is broken at some level ) , and the tension will be renormalized . dividing the leading term in @xmath543 by the worldvolume",
    "@xmath544=2\\pi^2 r^3 $ ] , each scalar and fermionic degree of freedom contributes a brane tension renormalization of the form @xmath545 similarly , there will be a renormalization of the induced newton s constant @xmath546 on the worldsheet , of the order @xmath547 for each pair of heavy field species .",
    "these changes will modify the instanton solution . for @xmath7 coincident branes",
    ", the number of such fields grows as @xmath263 , and the effect of these finite renormalizations can be quite dramatic .",
    "the nucleation rate will take the form @xmath548 where @xmath549 is a constant which depends on whether some ( or all ) of the fermionic species have decoupled or not .",
    "the bounce action @xmath550 in the exponent is calculated by using the renormalized values of the parameters .",
    "if @xmath551 , then the renormalized tension @xmath552 sharply decreases for large @xmath7 , leading to unsuppressed tunneling rate . on the contrary , for",
    "@xmath553 the nucleation of coincident branes is strongly suppressed .",
    "the action is given by @xmath554 on shell , the scalar curvature is given by , @xmath555 and hence the instanton action is given by @xmath556 the first integral in ( [ actionstatic ] ) is just the volume of a two - sphere of radius @xmath13 times @xmath557 .",
    "the second integral in ( [ actionstatic ] ) splits into two contributions from the two regions , @xmath558 so the instanton action is @xmath559 after some algebra @xmath560 can be written in the simple form @xmath561 the exponent @xmath249 which gives the probability for brane nucleation is the difference in euclidean actions between instanton and background .",
    "the action of the background is just @xmath562 so the difference in euclidean actions leads to eq .",
