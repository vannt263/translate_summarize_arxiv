    "ordinal patterns of length @xmath2 describe the relations of ` smaller '  or ` larger '  among @xmath2 consecutive points of a deterministically or randomly generated sequence in a linearly ordered space .",
    "ordinal patterns are the main ingredient of _ permutation entropy _ , a concept introduced both in metric and topological versions by bandt , keller and pompe @xcite , that were shown to coincide with their standard counterparts for piecewise monotone one - dimensional interval maps .",
    "later on , the concepts of metric and topological permutation entropies were generalized to @xmath3-dimensional interval maps in @xcite and amigo3 , respectively , while preserving the main results of @xcite although under different assumptions : ergodicity for the metric entropy and expansiveness for the topological entropy . both generalizations parallel kolmogorov s construction of entropy in dynamical systems in that they coarse - grain the state space with partitions , apply the corresponding definition of entropy to the resulting symbolic dynamics and , lastly , take ever finer partitions .",
    "but this time the partitions used are product , uniform partitions ( the original , one - dimensional versions even dispense thoroughly with partitions ) , making possible , albeit computationally demanding , the numerical estimation of metric and topological entropy .",
    "moreover , ordinal patterns allow a unified and conceptually simple approach both to metric and topological entropy , at variance with the standard approach .    in this paper , that can be considered a second part of @xcite",
    ", we deal only with the topological permutation entropy . having shown in amigo3 that this concept converges to topological entropy for @xmath3-dimensional _ expansive _ interval maps and",
    "illustrated how it can be used as estimator , we focus our attention now on some interesting consequences of order in dynamical systems .",
    "first of all , it turns out that the orbits of _ continuous _ , @xmath3-dimensional interval maps with finite topological _",
    "permutation entropy _ have always forbidden patterns , i.e. , ordinal patterns that can not occur in the orbits of the map , in contrast with ( unconstrained ) random time series , in which any ordinal patterns appears with probability @xmath5 . as a more practical result",
    ", it follows that the same happens to expansive maps with finite topological entropy .",
    "furthermore , forbidden patterns proliferate superexponentially with length , the exact details being controlled by the topological permutation entropy .",
    "the existence and growth rate of forbidden patterns was already considered in @xcite but in a rather restrictive setting , namely , for piecewise monotone maps on one - dimensional intervals only ( i.e. , using the original definition of topological permutation entropy and results of @xcite ) . in the present paper , we go higher dimensional by using the definitions and results of amigo3 .",
    "secondly , forbidden patterns are , in general , not invariant under isomorphism ( or conjugacy ) between dynamical systems unless the isomorphism is order - preserving , i.e. , it is an order - isomophism .",
    "this allows to further subdivide isomorphic systems according to their forbidden patterns , thus opening the door to more restrictive definitions of equivalence among maps of @xmath3-dimensional intervals .",
    "last but not least , forbidden patterns are robust against observational noise on account of being defined by inequalities . robustness was shown in @xcite to be instrumental for practical applications , specifically in scalar time series analysis .",
    "indeed , forbidden patterns can discriminate deterministic from random time series when the noise is white , even if the noise level is so high that any trace of determinism is washed out in the return map graph .",
    "the case with colored noise is currently under investigation .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "2 explains the basic conceptual and notational framework .",
    "3 and 4 are devoted to the study of forbidden ordinal patterns in higher dimensional dynamics ; the former contains the theoretical core and the latter deals with more practical issues , like the structure of forbidden patterns and their robustness against noise .",
    "5 illustrates the theoretical sections with numerical evidence of forbidden patterns for arnold s cat map and hnon s map , both using the naive counting estimator and chao s estimator for the number of classes in a population , which is quite popular in mathematical biology for estimating the number of species in ecological systems . the robustness of forbidden patterns against observational white noise is also addressed",

    "the number of allowed patterns increases exponentially with @xmath2 in deterministic chaos , and faster than exponentially with noise , and therefore one must increase @xmath86 , the number of iterates , substantially to permit a commensurately large number of distinct patterns to be actually observed .",
    "this motivates using a superior statistical estimator of @xmath270 .",
    "this equivalent problem has a significant history , motivated especially from the ecology community .",
    "consider a situation where one can observe a finite sample of individual organisms , from a presumably large population .",
    "what is the estimated number of distinct species , the biodiversity , and how can we estimate this given the individual counts of observed species ? ( for reviews of approaches to this problem see  @xcite . )",
    "this is analogous to our situation where we can distinguish individual order patterns but each observation is drawn from the natural distribution induced by typical orbits of the dynamical system . for our needs",
    "we wish to go reasonably deep into the undersampled regime and impose few probabilistic priors .",
    "we adopt the non - parametric estimator of chao  @xcite , motivated by comments in the reviews and our experience , as a simple but reasonably effective improvement : @xmath271where @xmath272 are the meta - counts  of observations , i.e. @xmath273 is the number of distinct ordinal patterns which were observed exactly once in the sample , @xmath274 the number which were observed exactly twice , etc . in practice this is accomplished by counting frequencies of observed patterns through a hash table , and in a second phase , counting the frequencies of such frequencies with a similar hash table .",

    "interestingly enough , the existence of forbidden patterns can be used as an indicator of determinism in univariate and multivariate time series analysis , since sequences generated by unconstrained random processes taking values on intervals have no forbidden patterns with probability one .",
