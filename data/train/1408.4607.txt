    "josephson junctions are physical devices of prominent , wide spread scientific and practical use .",
    "moreover , these can be used in testing the fundamentals of quantum mechanics and in studies for the many faces of chaotic complexity in classical physics .",
    "scientists exploit them for a multitude of diverse theoretical and experimental studies .",
    "applications in physics , electronics and other branches of engineering are well established : magnetometers , squids , superconducting qubits , rsfq ( rapid single flux quantum ) circuitry - all use a josephson junction as a primary building block . here , we engineer a squid - device which is composed of three josephson junctions and behaves as a physical ratchet system , i.e. a periodic structure which exhibits reflection - symmetry breaking @xcite .",
    "a similar system was analyzed in ref .",
    "@xcite for the over - damped case of the resistively shunted josephson junctions . here ,",
    "we extend the study to include inertial effects by accounting for a finite capacitance ( mass ) .",
    "this therefore leads to a modeling of the capacitively and resistively shunted case . in terms of classical mechanics ,",
    "the former corresponds to the over - damped brownian motion dynamics while the latter includes both finite dissipation and observable inertial effects .",
    "this extension is non - trivial because in the latter case the system allows for classical chaos .",
    "when the squid is driven by both a time - periodic and a constant current , it exhibits anomalous transport behavior including an absolute negative conductance in the linear response regime and negative static resistance in the nonlinear response regime .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii we describe the circuit with three josephson junctions and derive an equation which governs the dynamics of the studied system .",

    "we study transport properties of an experimental realization of the rocking ratchet mechanism in an asymmetric superconducting quantum interference device ( squid ) @xcite .",
    "we analyze the current - voltage characteristics in the framework of the stewart - mccumber theory @xcite .",
    "the stewart - mccumber model describes the semi - classical regime of a small josephson junction for which a spatial dependence of characteristics can be neglected .",
    "let us remind that in this theory the current @xmath2 flowing through the junction is split into three components : the displacement current associated with its capacitance @xmath3 , the normal ohmic current due the finite resistance @xmath4 of the junction and the super - current of cooper pairs characterized by the critical current @xmath5 .",
    "its explicit form reads @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the phase difference between the macroscopic wave functions of the cooper electrons in both sides of the junction , a dot denotes differentiation with respect to time @xmath8 and @xmath9 is the voltage across the device which obeys the josephson relation @xcite @xmath10 if we insert ( [ eq2 ] ) into ( [ eq1 ] ) and include according to the fluctuation - dissipation relation @xcite the effect of a non - zero temperature @xmath11 by adding johnson - nyquist noise , the above stewart - mccumber equation takes the form @xmath12 where @xmath13 , @xmath14 is the boltzmann constant and thermal fluctuations are modeled by @xmath15-correlated gaussian white noise @xmath16 of zero mean and unit intensity @xmath17 following the proposal in refs .",
    "@xcite we consider a squid ratchet which is composed of three josephson junctions as sketched in fig .",
    "the loop contains two josephson junctions in series in the left arm and one junction in the other arm .",
    "all elements are shunted with resistances ( @xmath18 ) and corresponding capacitances ( @xmath19 ) .",
    "we safely can ignore the individual sub - gap resistances of the unshunted junctions , those being much larger than the shunt resistances .",
    "moreover , the loop is pierced by an external magnetic flux @xmath20 .",
    "for each element in the left arm , exposed to the kirchhoff left - arm current @xmath21 , we can write the stewart - mccumber relation    [ eq3 ] @xmath22    where @xmath23 and @xmath24 are independent gaussian white noises of the same statistics as in ( [ eq13 ] ) . the processes @xmath23 and @xmath24 have to be independent to ensure the physically correct equilibrium gibbs state .    next , we consider the case when the two junctions in the left arm are identical , i.e. @xmath25 . using these equal parameters we make us of the fact that ideally the super - current in the _ left arm _ is conserved .",
    "therefore , we find that the realization of the two phase solutions are synchronous in absence of the two noise terms for same initial conditions and temperature @xmath26 .",
    "this singles out the unique and equal phases @xmath27 .",
    "it implies that a solution of ( 5a ) also obeys ( 5b ) with same imposed left arm current @xmath21@xcite .",
    "the kirchhoff law remains valid also in presence of current noise noise with the identical ( now random ) left arm current @xmath21 .",
    "because of the additional inhomogeneous nyquist current noise term in each junction , however , the two solutions generally stay no longer perfectly synchronized . assuming small noise intensities for the two thermal independent gaussian noise sources of equal strength we approximate the phases as being synchronized nevertheless , i.e. @xmath28 , with @xmath29 taking half of each relation in ( [ eq3]a ) and ( [ eq3]b ) and adding gives for the stochastic current @xmath21 the result @xmath30 with equal solutions @xmath27 this expression yields the langevin equation @xmath31 here",
    ", we used the fact that the linear combination of two independent gaussian white noises of intensities @xmath32 and @xmath33 gives again gaussian white noise with the total intensity described by @xmath34 . note that the stochastic process in ( [ eq5 ] ) amounts to a johnson - nyquist thermal noise for an overall shunt resistance @xmath35 .    from the above analysis",
    "it follows that two identical junctions in series can be considered as one for which the supercurrent - phase relation assumes the form : @xmath36 @xcite .",
    "this result was obtained in ref.@xcite in the framework of the ginzburg - landau theory , cf .",
    "( 23 ) therein .",
    "let us discuss the above assumed synchronized phase approximation in presence of small current noise in more detail . in the over - damped limit ( @xmath37 ) this result agrees for identical junctions in the left arm as used for the three - junction squid rocking ratchet experiment investigated by sterck _",
    "@xcite , see eqs .",
    "( 4)-(7 ) therein .",
    "in reality , however , slight different junction parameters will physically lead to asynchronous phase variations in the two junctions in the left arm .",
    "likewise , finite temperatures will , as indicated above , destroy as well the perfect synchronous motion of the noisy solutions @xmath38 , as assumed above at all times .",
    "however , the actual temperatures are experimentally very _ small _ @xcite .",
    "as it turns out , the physical ratchet effect for the average voltage emerging from this approximation remains itself _",
    "robust_. the latter has been verified before with simulations in the overdamped limit and also has been tested from experimental evidence in the corresponding low temperature limit .",
    "it was validated explicitly ( i ) numerically in @xcite and also ( ii ) experimentally for the three junction squid ratchet setup realized in the works @xcite . put differently , because we focus here on the josephson voltage across the device , i.e. the _ average behavior _ of the rate of change of the phase @xmath39 but not on explicit stochastic values , the substitution of the @xmath40$]-term by unity is justified in practice , as the corrections due to higher moments of the asynchronous phase difference can be safely neglected .",
    "in addition it must be kept in mind that the use of the stewart - mccumber model is itself an approximation .",
    "therefore , our theoretical predictions following from ( [ eq5 ] ) must be used as a guide towards `` physical reality '' for the experimenter rather than taken as granted without `` error '' @xcite .    for the junction in the right arm ,",
    "the stewart - mccumber equation reads @xmath41 we next add the constraint for the phases in the loop threaded by the magnetic flux @xcite @xmath42 where @xmath43 is the flux quantum and the actual flux @xmath44 is a sum of the external flux @xmath20 and the flux due to the flow of currents @xmath45 where @xmath46 is the loop inductance and @xmath47 is the _ circulating _ current which tends to screen the magnetic flux .",
    "if the current is fed to the loop symmetrically then @xmath48 . an asymmetric case is presented in the appendix .",
    "we consider the scenario when the second contribution is small , namely @xmath49 in this regime the internal flux increases monotonically with the external one and this operating mode is often called `` dispersive '' @xcite .",
    "then , from eqs .",
    "( [ eq7])-([eq9 ] ) we find @xmath50 the total current @xmath2 flowing through the squid is @xmath51 we insert @xmath21 and @xmath52 from ( [ eq5 ] ) and ( [ eq6 ] ) and use ( [ eq10 ] ) to eliminate @xmath53 .",
    "the result is @xmath54 where @xmath55 and @xmath56 .",
    "the gaussian white noise @xmath16 is a linear combinations of @xmath57 and @xmath58 and has the same statistics as in ( [ eq13 ] ) , cf . the similar transformation from ( [ eq4 ] ) to ( [ eq5 ] ) .",
    "let the device be driven by an additional external current @xmath2 which is composed of the static dc bias @xmath59 and the ac driving of amplitude @xmath60 and angular frequency @xmath61 , i.e. @xmath62 the mean value over the period @xmath63 is constant , @xmath64 . as a consequence",
    "we obtain that @xmath65 in the appendix , we show that in this case the voltage @xmath0 across the squid , averaged over the period of the ac current , is given by the relation @xmath66 where @xmath39 is a solution of ( [ eq12 ] ) and @xmath67 denotes a temporal average over one period of the ac current .",
    "we next transform ( [ eq12 ] ) into its dimensionless form .",
    "this can be achieved in several ways .",
    "it is known @xcite that for such a system there are four characteristic frequencies : plasma frequency @xmath68 , the characteristic frequency of the junction @xmath69 , the frequency @xmath70 related to the relaxation time and the frequency @xmath61 of the ac current .",
    "there are three independent characteristic time scales related to these frequencies ( note that @xmath71 ) . here , we follow @xcite and define the new phase @xmath72 and the dimensionless time @xmath73 as @xmath74 the corresponding dimensionless form of ( [ eq12 ] ) reads @xmath75 where the dot and prime denotes a differentiation over the dimensionless time @xmath76 and the phase @xmath72 , respectively .",
    "we introduced a spatially periodic potential @xmath77 of period @xmath78 of the following form @xcite",
    "@xmath79 this potential is reflection - symmetric if there exists @xmath80 such that @xmath81 for any @xmath72 . if @xmath82 , it is generally asymmetric and its reflection symmetry is broken .",
    "we classify this characteristics as a ratchet potential .",
    "however , even for @xmath82 there are certain values of the external flux @xmath83 for which it is is still symmetric .",
    "the dimensionless capacitance @xmath84 is the ratio between two characteristic time scales @xmath85 , where the relaxation time is @xmath86 . other re - scaled parameters are @xmath87 , @xmath88 , @xmath89 and @xmath90 .",
    "it is worth to note that the noise intensity @xmath91 is the quotient of the thermal energy and the josephson coupling energy .",
    "the re - scaled gaussian white noise is of vanishing mean and the auto - correlation function .",
    "hereafter , we will use only dimensionless variables and shall omit the hat notation in all quantities appearing in ( [ eq18 ] ) . in fig .",

    "the symmetric potential for @xmath95 is also depicted .",
    "we would like to add that ( [ eq18 ] ) has a mechanical interpretation : it is identical to the langevin equation of a classical brownian particle of mass @xmath96 ( i ) moving in spatially periodic ratchet potential @xmath77 , ( ii ) being rocked by an unbiased harmonic force @xmath97 and ( iii ) exposed to a static force @xmath98 . in this mechanical framework",

    "the voltage ( [ eq16 ] ) or its dimensionless counterpart @xmath101 is determined by ( [ eq18 ] ) . in the long time limit , it takes the form of a fourier series over all harmonics @xcite , namely , @xmath102 where @xmath103 is a dc ( time - independent ) component and @xmath104 are time - periodic functions of zero average over a basic period @xmath105 . in this case",

    "it is a minimal dimension for chaotic behavior to occur . indeed ,",
    "periodic , quasi periodic and chaotic trajectories can be detected .",
    "a rough classification can be made into locked states in which the motion of @xmath72 is bounded to a few spatial periods and running states in which it is unlimited in space of @xmath72 .",
    "the latter are crucial for the occurrence of the deterministic transport . for some regimes ,",
    "ergodicity is broken and the systematic non - zero voltage emerges with its sign depending on the choice of selected initial conditions .",

    "in particular , this give rise to diffusive directed transport .    in order to obtain the relevant transport characteristics we have to resort to comprehensive numerical simulations of driven langevin dynamics .",
    "we integrated ( [ eq18 ] ) by employing a weak version of the stochastic second order predictor corrector algorithm @xcite with a time step typically set to about @xmath120 .",

    "generally @xmath110 with @xmath116 @xcite .",

    "modern personal gpu computers have given us opportunity to scan the parameter space of the system with high resolution in a reasonable time and therefore we were able to find a regime for which the ratchet effect is _ globally _ maximal , see in fig .",
    "all transport characteristics corresponding to this set of parameters are presented below .",
    "it turns out that the ratchet effect is optimal in the moderate capacitance regime @xmath158 , for the moderate amplitude @xmath159 and the frequency @xmath160 of the time - oscillating current .",
    "moreover , there are several clearly indicated peaks in the dependence of the dc - voltage on the system parameters .",
    "the effect of thermal noise on the ratchet effect is destructive for this set of parameters .",
    "however , it is worth to note that this regime is temperature robust because the average voltage @xmath106 starts to decrease significantly only for the thermal noise intensities higher than @xmath161 , cf .",
    "[ fig9](e ) .",
    "transport measured as the stationary dc - voltage can be controlled in a several ways .",
    "it seems that from the experimental point of view the simplest way is to vary a dc current @xmath98 or an external constant magnetic flux @xmath83 .",
    "we first consider the unbiased domain with @xmath142 . in fig .",
    "[ fig10 ] we depict how the dc - voltage behaves in the parameter plane @xmath162 for two cases : @xmath119 ( panel ( a ) ) and @xmath163 ( panel ( b ) )",
    ". the most important feature of these plots is the symmetry with respect to the magnetic flux @xmath164 . for an arbitrary integer number @xmath165 , the transformation @xmath166 reverses the polarity of the potential ( [ eq19 ] ) and as a consequence reverses also the voltage sign .",
    "the geometric structure of the domains in the depicted regime of the @xmath162-variation is complex .",
    "there are islands of positive and negative voltage .",
    "for the deterministic case ( @xmath119 ) we reveal the refined structure .",
    "some of these regions survive when the temperature is increased while others disappear .",
    "we detect a few robust regimes for which `` islands '' of non - zero voltage persist .",
    "it is seen that if the capacitance is fixed at the proper value the direction of transport can be changed by the magnetic field . in some regions ,",
    "several voltage reversals can be obtained by use of this method . if the dc - current is applied , the above symmetry is destroyed .",
    "this case is shown in fig .",
    ". however , there are still regimes where the magnetic field is a relevant control parameter for the direction of transport .    .",

    "we analyzed the characteristics of the voltage across an asymmetric squid device composed of three capacitively and resistively shunted josephson junctions which are threaded by a magnetic flux .",
    "we derived the evolution equation which governs the dynamics of the phase across the squid .",
    "the effective potential experienced by the phase displays a symmetry breaking in the form of the ratchet potential . under the influence of an oscillating current source ,",
    "the current - voltage characteristics yields the possibility to obtain a finite dc - voltage in presence of a vanishing dc - current , i.e. a ratchet effect is obtained . within a tailored ranges of parameters , the same sign of the dc - voltage can be obtained regardless of the sign of the external dc - current .    with this comprehensive study",
    "we have taken into consideration the role of a finite capacitance of the squid . as a consequence ,",
    "the resulting ratchet dynamics becomes rather rich , giving rise to features which are absent in the over - damped limit . with the help of the computational power of modern gpu computers",
    "we have identified a whole range of novel phenomena inherent for the ratchet current .",
    "these are a negative ( differential ) conductance , repeated dc - voltage reversals , noise induced dc - voltage reversals and particular forms of solely noise - induced ratchet features . for given tailored sets of parameters",
    "the ratchet voltage assumes optimal values .",
    "last but not least , we have been able to detect the set of parameters for which the ratchet effect is globally maximal and demonstrated how the direction of transport can be manipulated by tailoring the threading external magnetic flux .",
    "the main goal of this work was the exploration and identification of parameter regimes for directed ratchet transport in realistic squid devices possessing _ finite _ capacitances .",
    "such a study is of relevance for applications which make use of a generation and its control of the induced ratchet - voltages , their direction ( sign ) , magnitude and their intrinsic sensitive dependence on system parameters .",
    "other transport quantifiers concerning the overall quality of the inertia - induced transport , such as the nature of the ratchet - voltage fluctuations ( yielding in turn a diffusion dynamics of the phase across the squid ) , or the efficiency of the device @xcite have not been addressed here .",
    "given the underlying complexity of the inertial ratchet dynamics these numerical studies are even more cumbersome than the presented ones .",
    "finally , an interesting question concerns the robustness of our results with respect to slightly different junction parameters in series ; an assumed exact mathematically equality of parameters for two junctions is practically difficult to achieve . this issue has been addressed in the positive for the case of the over - damped regime @xcite , where it was found that the corresponding results remain robust . for the under - damped regime ,",
    "the complexity of the problem becomes even more higher multi - dimensional and therefore this task is presently beyond the scope of this work .",
    "nevertheless , those additional aspects are on our agenda when the corresponding cumbersome numerical investigations become technically more feasible .",
    "this work was supported in part by the mnisw program  diamond grant ",

    "dec-2013/09/b / st3/01659 ( j.  . ) , and by a grant ha1517/-2 from the deutsche forschungsgemeinschaft ( dfg ) ( p. h. ) .",
    "the authors also like to thank peter talkner for constructive discussions .",
    "we demonstrate that in the `` dispersive '' operating mode of the squid , i.e. when the condition ( [ eq9 ] ) holds true , the averaged voltage developed across the squid can be expressed in the form : @xmath172 we follow the method presented in ref .",
    "@xcite and consider an asymmetric junction configuration for which the total flux is @xmath173 where @xmath174 and @xmath175 are the fluxes produced by the currents @xmath21 and @xmath52 , respectively .",
    "the coefficients @xmath176 and @xmath177 are related to the loop inductance via the relation @xmath178 the total voltage across the squid calculated along the left arm is the sum @xmath179 similarly , along the right side we have @xmath180 where @xmath181 and @xmath182 are self - inductances of the left and the right arm , respectively .",
    "generally , they are different from @xmath183 , see refs .",
    "the mutual inductance between the two arms is @xmath184 and @xmath185 are the voltage drops across the left and right junctions , respectively .",
    "now , we use ( [ eq15 ] ) to get      adding both sides of these equations and utilizing ( [ a6 ] ) yields @xmath187 by differentiation ( [ eq10 ] ) and making use of ( [ eq15 ] ) we obtain @xmath188 from this equation we calculate @xmath189 and insert it into ( [ a8 ] ) to obtain @xmath190 where @xmath191 up to here we used ( [ eq15 ] ) . from ( [ eq9 ] ) and ( [ eq10 ] ) it follows that @xmath192 . in this case the result ( [ a1 ] ) follows directly from the result in ( [ a10 ] ) .",
