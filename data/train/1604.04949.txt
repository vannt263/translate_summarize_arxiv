    ", one can calculate @xmath20 which gives the non - local resistance- @xmath21 , and two probe resistance @xmath22 .",
    "the case represented in fig .",
    "1(b ) , depicts a single disordered probe .",
    "the conductance matrix relating the currents with voltages is given as follows : @xmath23    from eqs .",
    "( 1 ) and ( 3 ) , with @xmath24 and choosing as before @xmath12 , we get @xmath25 and @xmath26 , where @xmath27 are the strength of disorder at contact i and it is related to @xmath28 ( total reflection probability at contact i ) and @xmath29 ( total transmission probability at contact i ) by the relations- @xmath30 and @xmath31 . in other words",
    ", @xmath32 is the reflection probability of each edge mode at contact ` i ' .",
    "we see that both non - local and local ( two probe ) resistances deviate from their ideal values and are decreasing with disorder .",
    "this is in contrast to qh case in which they are independent of disorder . in four",
    "probe qh bar with a single disordered probe at contact 2 with strength @xmath33 , the current coming out of probe 2 is @xmath34 instead of @xmath35 like in the ideal case and solving the similar conductance matrix for ideal qh case as in eq .",
    "[ qh - ideal ] , we will get @xmath20 , which leads to the non - local resistance @xmath21 as in ideal case , and the two terminal resistance @xmath22 .",
    "all contacts are considered to be disordered in general for this case . the conductance matrix relating the currents with voltages",
    "is given as follows : @xmath36 m represents the total no . of modes .",
    "in set up as shown in fig .",
    "1c , only one mode is shown . in conductance matrix ( 4 ) , @xmath37-the total transmission probability from contact @xmath38 to @xmath39 , can be written as- @xmath40m}{1-d_{1}d_{2}d_{3}d_{4}},\\ ] ] the first term in the numerator of @xmath37 is due to the spin up edge mode and second term is due to the spin down edge mode .",
    "lets explain the terms in the numerator . in the first term electron coming out of contact 3 with probability @xmath41 ,",
    "is reflected at contact 4 with probability @xmath42 and then it transmits at contact 1 with probability @xmath43 , so the probability of transmission for spin up electrons is @xmath44 .",
    "but this is the shortest possible path among the many other path from contact 3 to 1 .",
    "so to get the total transmission probability for spin up electrons we need to sum over all the paths from contact 3 to 1 .",
    "for the second path for spin up electron , suppose an electron coming out of contact 3 with probability @xmath41 , then it reflects at contact 4 with probability @xmath42 again it is reflected from contact 1 with @xmath45 , from contact 2 with @xmath33 , from contact 3 with @xmath46 , from contact 4 with @xmath42 and then finally it transmits to contact 1 with probability @xmath47 .",
    "so the second path becomes @xmath48 .",
    "so when we sum over all the paths we get a factor @xmath49 in the denominator .",
    "so finally transmission probability for spin up electron is @xmath50m}{1-d_{1}d_{2}d_{3}d_{4}}$ ] .",
    "similarly for spin down electron from contact 3 to 1 the transmission probability is @xmath51m}{1-d_{1}d_{2}d_{3}d_{4}}$ ] . in this way we get @xmath37 , and",
    "can calculate the other matrix elements also .",
    "the non - local and local resistances are thus in units of @xmath52-    @xmath53    @xmath54 from figs .",
    "2(c),(d ) it is evident that local resistance for qsh case can increase or decrease with increasing disorder ( depending on the current probe disorder or voltage probe disorder respectively ) , but the non - local resistance always decrease with increasing disorder .",
    "this is in contrast to the non - local qh case which again does not deviate from the ideal result . in qh case , for all probe disorder and all probe disorder with inelastic scattering we get identical results- @xmath21 , and @xmath55 , where @xmath56 denote the disorder strengths at probe 1 and 4 respectively .",
    "only difference taking into play between qh and qsh edge modes is that the first one is chiral and the second one is helical , and due to this helical ( two opposite chiralities ) edge modes the non - local resistance in qsh is affected by disorder while it remains unaffected in qh case . for all disordered probes with inelastic scattering included- the condition @xmath57 still holds for the qh system which is due to the chirality of edge modes , leading to vanishing non - local resistance , this is easy to understand- two adjacent voltage probes ( in between there is no current probe ) will always have same potential for chiral edge modes , leading to zero non - local resistance irrespective of any disorder at the probes .",
    "we now address the case of qsh edge modes in presence of completely disordered contacts with inelastic scattering included .",
    "further , we also take into consideration the fact that an electron can flip its spin . in figure 1(c ) , the length between disordered contacts is taken to be larger than inelastic scattering length . if an inelastic scattering event occurs , edge modes originating from different probes with different energies are equilibrated to a common potential@xcite",
    ".    an important question might arise regarding the fact that inelastic scattering in fig .",
    "1(c ) seems to occur only at a specific point , this is a misleading conclusion from fig .",
    "1(c ) , for reasons to do with clarity we have put the starry blob in fig .",
    "1(c ) at a specific place .",
    "however , equilibration between electrons in edge modes emanating from contacts 1 and 2 can happen anywhere between contacts 1 and 2 .",
    "once an electron is inelastically scattered it remains inelastically scattered .",
    "inelastic scattering does not happen only at a single point , it can happen anywhere .",
    "it is a single energy to which electrons are inelastically scattered the equilibration potential ( primed values for the @xmath2 s in fig .",
    "1(c ) ) .    in figure 1(c ) , one sees that electrons coming from probes 1 and 2 are equilibrated to potential @xmath58- indicated in figure 1(c ) as a starry blob to indicate equilibration of electrons coming from different probes at different potentials ( unprimed values ) to a new potential ( the primed values ) via inelastic scattering . if probes 1 and 4 are chosen to be current probes then no current flows into the other voltage probes @xmath59 .",
    "say a current @xmath60 enters probe 2 , the part @xmath61 is the spin - up contribution while the part @xmath62 is the spin - down one , which moves in exactly the opposite direction .",
    "further , since current @xmath63 leaves voltage probe 2 and as net current through probe 2 is zero , this results in @xmath64 .",
    "similarly for voltage probe 3 , @xmath65 .",
    "writing the current voltage relations for each probe separately , and eschewing the previous way of writing it in matrix form as there are not only 4 potentials @xmath66 to @xmath67 , we also have the equilibrated potentials @xmath58 to @xmath68 , we get- .",
    "@xmath69 the condition that net current into voltage probes @xmath8 is zero begets the following relations between the probe potentials : @xmath70 and @xmath65 .",
    "net spin - up current out of probe 2 is @xmath71 while the net spin - down current out of probe 3 is @xmath72 and their sum is equal to @xmath73 which is the net current at voltage @xmath74- the equilibrated potential due to inelastic scattering between probes 2 and 3 . since there are 4 equilibrated potentials we will have four such conditions .",
    "the origin of the first condition has already been explained , we list the rest here : @xmath75    solving eq .",
    "( 8) , leads to a relation between the equilibrated potentials @xmath76 in terms of the probe potentials @xmath77 . replacing the obtained @xmath76 in eq .",
    "5 , gives the necessary resistances .",
    "we plot in fig .",
    "3 , the non - local and local resistances . the erratic behaviour for the non - local qsh resistance comes out clearly . for one set of disorder parameters the non - local resistance decreases while for another set it monotonically increases as function of disorder . the local resistance on the other hand monotonically increases with increasing disorder .",
    "finally , we deal with the case of qsh edge modes with all disordered probes including inelastic scattering , however in absence of any spin - flip scattering .",
    "we now only have equilibration between same spin edge modes . in fig .",
    "4(a ) , spin - up electrons originating in probes 1 and 4 are equilibrated to potential @xmath58 while spin - down electrons coming from probes 2 and 3 are equilibrated to potential @xmath78 .",
    "the potentials @xmath79 denote equilibration of spin - up edge modes while the potentials @xmath80 denote equilibration of spin - down edge modes .",
    "since probes 1 and 4 are current probes and no current flows into the voltage probes , say a spin - up current @xmath81 ) , and a spin down current @xmath82 enter probe 2 , while current @xmath63 leaves probe 2 ( voltage probe with net current through it zero ) , giving @xmath83 , a similar thing happens at probe 3 .",
    "there are now not only the 4 potentials @xmath84 , we also have the equilibrated spin - up potentials @xmath85 and the spin down potentials @xmath86 .",
    "we write the current voltage relations in this condition as follows :    @xmath87    when the condition of net current into voltage probes @xmath8 is zero is enforced we get the following relations between probe potentials : @xmath88 .",
    "equilibration of net spin - up current from probe 1 , which is the sum @xmath89 , will be equal to @xmath90 the net current out of the spin - up equilibrated potential @xmath58 .",
    "similarly , the net spin up currents out of probes 2 - 4 are equilibrated to the potentials @xmath91 as in eq",
    "we follow the same procedure for the down spin currents and these are written below in eq .",
    "the origin of the first equation has already been explained above herein below we list all of them : @xmath92 solving these eight equations , gives the equilibrated potentials @xmath93 in terms of the probe potentials @xmath94 .",
    "the obtained @xmath95 are replaced in eq .  8 , and we derive the necessary resistances . due to the length of the expressions for resistances",
    "we refrain from explicitly writing them but analyze them via figure 4 . in figure 4 ( c )",
    "we plot the non - local and 2-terminal resistances for qsh case with spin - flip and in 4(b ) we plot the same without spin - flip .",
    "we see that the non - local resistance completely changes when one discards spin flip scattering as in figure 4(b ) .",
    "the non - local resistance and 2-terminal resistance decrease monotonically for without spin flip while increase monotonically with spin flip . to conclude this section",
    ", spin - flip scattering has a non - trivial effect on the non - local response while disorder and inelastic scattering lead to a monotonic reduction in the non - local resistance for qsh edge modes , spin - flip can enhance the non - local resistance too .",
    "to conclude we establish here that non - local transport in case of helical qsh edge modes are not less impervious to dephasing as previously understood in general non - helical four - terminal aharonov - bohm type set ups@xcite .",
    "further , they are modified quite drastically by disorder , even a single disordered probe reduces significantly the non - local resistance .",
    "this puts a big question mark over the usefulness of non - local qsh transport in low power information processing as reported in several works , see ref .",
