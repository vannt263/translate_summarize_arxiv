    "a most fascinating question in quantum mechanics is how much a measurement acts back on a quantum system and thus influences the state of the latter .",
    "@xcite according to the classic measurement postulate , the projective measurement of a quantity causes a collapse of the wave function into an eigenstate of the corresponding operator .",
    "however , quantum mechanics only allows probabilistic statements about the state into which the wave function collapses .",
    "this evolution into a mixture can be modeled by coupling the quantum system via the measurement operator to a measurement apparatus , i.e. , to a macroscopic environment which provokes dissipation and decoherence .",
    "a natural interpretation of this process is that information about the quantum system leaks into the environment , while the system acquires entropy .",
    "since the environment is perceived as classical object , one may assume that the pointer of a measurement apparatus corresponds to a collective environment coordinate .",
    "@xcite then the question arises how the quantum system and this collective coordinate influence each other . in other words",
    ", which information about the quantum system is contained in the collective coordinate and how strong is the backaction of the environment on the system ?    a specific example for such a measurement device is a low - frequency `` tank circuit '' coupled to a superconducting qubit .",
    "@xcite here , one makes use of the fact that the resonance frequency of the oscillator depends on the qubit state which , in turn , influences the phase of the oscillator response .",
    "this allows one to measure both the charge and the flux degree of freedom of superconducting qubits .",
    "the drawback of this scheme , however , is that the coherent qubit dynamics is considerably faster than the driving .",
    "thus , one can only observe the time - average of the qubit state , but not time - resolve its dynamics . measuring the qubit directly by driving it at resonance is possible as well .",
    "@xcite this however induces rabi oscillations and , thus , alters the qubit dynamics significantly .",
    "@xcite .    in ref .",
    ", we proposed to probe a quantum system with a weak high - frequency drive acting directly upon the qubit .",
    "we found that the reflected signal possesses a time - dependent phase shift which is related to a qubit observable .",
    "this relation was validated for a cooper - pair box that is in a superposition of the two lowest energy eigenstates which form a qubit . in particular",
    ", it was shown that coherent oscillations of this qubit are visible in the reflected signal , while the driving - induced backaction stays at a tolerable level .",
    "this enables time - resolved monitoring of the coherent qubit dynamics .    in this article",

    "this states that at high frequencies , the driving does not add decoherence , which confirms the picture drawn by investigating the measurement fidelity @xmath182 .    our model hamiltonian does not consider the excitation of quasi - particles in the superconductor .",
    "therefore it is valid only as long as the driving frequency stays below the gap energy .",

    "this , in turn , enables one to reconstruct the characteristics of the concurrence @xmath208 and thus of the amount of entanglement between the two qubits , according to eq .  .",
    "in a similar way , one finds access to the entanglement when the system is initially prepared in the subspace @xmath224 .",

    "obviously , this does not always apply .",
    "however , two qubits prepared in a bell state represent such a case which is of relevance and interest .",
    "so far , we have addressed initially pure entangled states , which constitutes an idealization and is not always achievable in an experiment .",
    "a more realistic scenario copes with the drawback that one starts from a mixed state which naturally possesses less entanglement .",
    "moreover , the concurrence is then no longer determined by a single off - diagonal matrix element [ cf.eq .  ] , but rather has to be computed from the definition of the two - qubit concurrence , eq .  .",
    "in order to test how much information about the concurrence @xmath228 is nevertheless contained in the measurement signal , we study the time evolution for the preparation in an unpolarized mixture or werner state ,  @xcite @xmath229 where @xmath230 denotes the degree of depolarization . a perfect initial preparation in the fully entangled state @xmath231 is then characterized by @xmath232 . for @xmath233 ,",

    "in the realm of circuit qed , a polarization degree of @xmath234 has already been achieved ,  @xcite while in a quantum optical context , even the much lower value @xmath235 could be reached .",
    "@xcite    our goal is now to compare the concurrence @xmath228 with @xmath208 which holds for preparation in a bell state . as a measure for the agreement , we use again the fidelity @xmath182 defined as the scaled overlap between both quantities , i.e. , by eq .   but with the phases replaced by the concurrences .",

    "the investigation of several examples showed that , beyond a fidelity defect of this order , both curves no longer appear similar .",
    "thus , it appears that the measured phase shift captures the concurrence dynamics satisfactorily only for a @xmath170 below this threshold .",
    "remarkably , the latter is not reached until an initial depolarization of @xmath237 . from this , we conclude that our measurement protocol allows one to gain information about qubit - qubit entanglement in circuit qed even for depolarized initial states .     of the concurrence curves @xmath208 and @xmath228 in dependence of the degree of depolarization , @xmath230 .",

    "as discussed in the text , the upper bound @xmath238 marks the largest acceptable value of @xmath230 .",
    "all other parameters as in fig .",

    "the typical signal that can be reached with our protocol , as regards measurements of single quantum systems , is a phase shift of the order @xmath180 , as estimated in sec .",
    "[ sec : lz ] . of practical interest is whether this already marks the maximum reachable . in the following ,",
    "we suggest how to increase the visibility by monitoring the collective dynamics of a large number of identical quantum objects at the same time . for this purpose , we exemplarily investigate an `` atomic cloud '' containing a large number of atoms as described in ref .  .",
    "there , an ensemble of cold atoms interacting with a superconducting cavity , described by the dicke model , was investigated .",
    "provided that it is possible to single out one particular atomic transition , the cloud represents an ensemble of identical two level atoms .",
    "this gives rise to the @xmath102-qubit hamiltonian @xmath239 the interaction between the electromagnetic field in the cavity and the atoms is assumed dipole - like and can be cast into the operator @xmath240 .",
    "here , the collective coupling operator @xmath241 is chosen dimensionless and given as @xmath242 and @xmath243 denotes the collective spin of the cloud .    in the case where an open transmission line is employed in the setup rather than the ( closed ) cavity ,",
    "a continuum of modes replaces the single cavity mode in the modeling . in this sense",
    ", the transmission line can be understood as one - dimensional heat bath .",
    "the dipole interaction between the cloud and the environment becomes @xmath244 .",
    "thus , one naturally ends up with the caldeira - legget model of eq .",
    "where , formally , @xmath245 .",
    "assuming an ohmic environment , the phase shift   then becomes @xmath246,q ] \\right\\rangle_{0,t } \\ ; , \\ ] ] where @xmath247 denotes the dimensionless damping strength , and @xmath248 is the coupling strength to the environment per atom . inserting @xmath249 and @xmath241 into the measurement relation   yields @xmath250 with @xmath251 .",
    "thus , the phase signal scales with @xmath252 as compared to eq .  .",
    "by virtue of this relation , monitoring the collective dynamics of @xmath102 two - level systems via the total spin paves the way towards a higher angular visibility .    since the validity of the measurement relation",
    "is restricted to small angles , the visibility may be enhanced up to the order @xmath253 . in order to be specific , we evaluate @xmath227 for the parameters  @xcite @xmath254 , @xmath255 , @xmath256 .",
    "this yields an effective single - atom coupling to the ohmic environment of @xmath257 . despite this very small system - bath interaction strength per atom ,",
    "the estimated phase resolution for @xmath258 atoms in the cloud reaches @xmath259 . at the same time , atomic decoherence is drastically reduced . under these conditions , which are",
    "experimentally achievable,@xcite the real - time monitoring of an atomic ensemble constitutes a major improvement in angular visibility in comparison with the single - qubit case .",
    "we have derived a scheme for monitoring the low - frequency dynamics of a quantum system , where a particular focus has been put on quantum circuits .",
    "the central idea is to couple the quantum system capacitively to a high - frequency ac field and to measure the reflected signal .",
    "we have shown that the phase of the latter contains information about a particular expectation value of the central system . in an experiment ,",
    "this information can be extracted with lock - in techniques .",
    "this scheme has some similarities to the qubit readout via a tank circuit  @xcite or a quantum point contact .",
    "@xcite the essential difference is that the proposed high - frequency driving enables a time - resolved measurement .",
    "the underlying relation between a particular expectation value and the phase shift of the reflected signal relies on a time - scale separation .",
    "this constitutes an approximation , which has to be validated . in so doing ,",
    "we have demonstrated that the measurement fidelity is rather good . as an example",
    ", we have studied a qubit undergoing landau - zener transitions .",
    "owing to the time dependent level splitting of the qubit , its dynamics possesses a broad frequency spectrum .",
    "thus , it represents a more challenging test case than the coherent oscillations considered in ref .  .",
    "also for the present case , the measurement fidelity turned out to be rather good .",
    "a further relevant issue is the backaction of the measurement on the system .",
    "the relevant backaction is decoherence which here is unavoidable because the driving and the environmental degrees of freedom couple to the system via the same mechanism .",
    "this is reflected by the fact that the phase shift being the recorded signal is proportional to the decoherence rate .",
    "thus a stronger coupling to the driving can be achieved only at the expense of more decoherence .",
    "concerning possible applications in solid - state quantum information processing , the generalization towards systems with two or more qubits is rather important . for the case of two qubits ,",
    "we have demonstrated that it is possible to monitor the time evolution of their entanglement , provided that one can access the relevant density matrix elements via the phase shift of the reflected signal . even though the entanglement decays due to the unavoidable decoherence ,",
    "it is still possible to monitor an appreciable number of cycles between entangled and separable states of interacting qubits .",
    "furthermore , our protocol produces reliable results even in the case where the monitored state is mixed rather than pure .",
    "finally , we have also addressed the question of how much stronger the measurement signal can be if the single qubit is replaced by a whole array of qubits that undergo the same dynamics .",
    "the result is that the signal scales with the square root of the number of qubits .",
    "this even leaves some room for improving the fidelity and reducing the coupling to each qubit . as a consequence",
    ", decoherence becomes less relevant , which is encouraging in particular when attempting a proof - of - principle realization .",
