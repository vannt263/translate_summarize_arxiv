    "can star capture account for the growth of the largest supermassive black holes in the universe ?",
    "could this process account for the growth of abundant smaller supermassive black holes , or intermediate mass seeds ?",
    "the answer to this question appears to be yes , as we argue in this paper .",
    "the central few parsecs of most standard ( @xmath4 ) galaxies contain either supermassive black holes ( smbhs ) , nuclear star clusters ( nscs ) , or both of these components . in some cases",
    "the nscs are distinct entities and in other cases they appear to be a continuation of the inner spheroidal component . in either case ,",
    "nscs typically represent regions of high stellar density , often with a steep , cusp - like profile .",
    "it is well known that , for the more massive galaxies ( @xmath5 ) , the mass of the bh component is roughly linearly related @xcite to the mass in the spheroidal stellar component of the galaxy , but lower mass systems can also contain smbhs with masses below the linear relation , and for very low mass galaxies the smbhs are apparently absent in general , with notable exceptions @xcite .",
    "however , for galaxies with masses below this transition ( @xmath6 ) , the central regions typically contain nscs having masses roughly proportional to the spheroidal stellar mass , with values similar to the smbh mass at the transition point , and with the nscs being less prominent than the smbhs above the transition .",
    "nscs are typically absent in the largest galaxies , and only coexist with smbhs in galaxies from an intermediate mass range @xcite .",
    "[ fig : nscdichotomy2 ] illustrates this dichotomy with observational data from nearby galactic nuclei , plotted against the velocity dispersion of the host galaxy .    an overly simple explanation for this behavior would postulate that all standard galaxies start out with nuclear star clusters proportional to the spheroidal mass , but that above some critical mass ( or escape velocity ) , dynamical processes transform a larger and larger fraction of the stars in the nsc to massive seed central bhs .",
    "that would explain in a simple fashion the continuity observed between centrally located nscs and central bhs .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to outline the dynamical processes that could make this cartoon scenario a plausible physical process .",
    "we focus in particular on tidal capture and disruption of stars as a runaway growth channel for stellar mass black holes ( sbhs ) .",
    "the origin of nscs is not the primary topic of this paper , but the hypothesis that they form from the infall of globular clusters ( gcs ) due to dynamical friction @xcite is consistent with the dynamical processes that we will be treating in this paper , and is generally capable of growing nscs to @xmath7 in less than one billion years .",
    "an alternative formation channel is _ in situ _ growth through star formation @xcite .",
    "it is not clear which of these two mechanisms dominates nsc formation , and the data is often consistent with contributions from both channels @xcite .",
    "however , it is clear that _ in situ _ star formation continues at some level in most nuclear star clusters ago ( * ? ? ? * and references therein ) . ] , and therefore provides a natural source of sbhs in nscs .    the primary physical mechanism that we will consider , tidal capture ,",
    "is well known .",
    "one star can capture another into a bound orbit if a close encounter between the two puts more energy into tidal perturbations than the positive relative energy of these two stars at large separation .",
    "the tidal capture mechanism was first pointed out by @xcite , with an early computation by @xcite and a more refined modal analysis given by @xcite .",
    "later work analyzed subsequent orbital evolution both prior @xcite and subsequent @xcite to the onset of internal dissipation .",
    "is visible , below which nscs dominate and above which smbhs dominate . in low @xmath8 galaxies , nsc",
    "masses appear to follow a power law that turns over for @xmath9 ; this power law is resumed in larger galaxies by the smbh masses , which fall off sharply for @xmath10 .",
    "smbh dynamical mass measurements and nsc mass data are taken from @xcite , and two local galaxies of interest ( the milky way and m31 ) are marked with circles ; these datasets give one smbh mass ( black dots ) for every nsc mass .",
    "we also show a different set of smbh masses estimated with maser disk measurements @xcite ; for these galaxies associated nscs are unconstrained and the smbh masses are shown with green dots .",
    "the green line shows the `` saturation mass '' predicted for smbhs formed through the mechanism in this paper , described in more detail in eq .",
    "[ eq : msat ] .",
    "growth of smbhs above the green line occurs through standard forms of gas accretion @xcite .",
    "the black arrow at @xmath11 indicates the rough transition below which nscs are insufficiently dense to produce runaway sbh growth.,width=321 ]    if sbhs are retained , or are subsequently formed , in dense stellar systems such as gcs or nscs , then mass segregation will bring them to the central , densest part of the system , whereupon they will be well situated to tidally capture the much more abundant low mass , normal stars . the dramatic influence that the resulting tidal capture binaries can have on the dynamical evolution of such clusters has been studied extensively @xcite .",
    "but the specific possibility that a runaway of successive tidal captures would lead to the formation of a massive black hole , first proposed by @xcite , has not been quantified in detail .",
    "we will provide some first calculations of the circumstances required for such a runaway to occur in this paper , as well as the expected endpoint of the runaway , returning to a more detailed calculation in subsequent work .",
    "the preliminary analytic and numerical treatment presented here indicates that the physical requirements for runaway tidal captures are first satisfied for galactic nuclei near the nsc / smbh transition at black hole masses of @xmath12 and stellar velocity dispersions @xmath13 .",
    "supermassive black hole ( smbh ) seed formation is generally studied in the context of the high redshift universe , and three leading candidate scenarios currently exist ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* for general reviews ) : stellar remnant bhs left over following the deaths of pop iii stars , the direct collapse of gas in small halos , and runaway stellar collisions in dense star clusters .",
    "the pop iii scenario has the advantages of concreteness and ubiquity , but has been cast into doubt by recent simulations that find pop iii stars may be much less massive than was previously thought due to fragmentation during their formation @xcite . even if simpler estimations for the masses of the first stars ( @xmath0 ) are correct @xcite , this scenario produces the lowest mass smbh seeds .",
    "direct collapse of gas in early halos has the advantage of producing much larger seeds , @xmath12 , but will be strongly suppressed by small amounts of coolants , primarily molecular hydrogen @xcite .",
    "the mechanism in this paper is a specific example of the third channel for smbh seed formation : runaway collisions of stellar mass objects in dense stellar environments @xcite , such as gcs or nscs .",
    "past studies of this channel predicted smbh seeds of widely varying mass , depending on which variant of the stellar runaway proceeds : @xmath14 .",
    "we will focus primarily on a relatively unexplored variant of the runaway collision scenario , specifically the process of runaway tidal capture and the resulting growth of a massive object , although we comment briefly on more traditional versions of this scenario as well .",
    "our work focuses on tidal capture because that process has the largest cross - section of any of the dynamical mechanisms we consider .",
    "it is therefore vital in initiating the runaway growth of black holes that start with roughly @xmath15 sbh seeds .",
    "but , as we will note later , such processes may not ultimately dominate the total mass growth of our black holes ; and consideration of conventional tidal destruction events as initially envisaged by @xcite under the same circumstances would also grow sbhs to comparable sizes provided a runaway can begin .    in  2",
    "we discuss the different star capture channels available to grow a sbh in a dense star cluster , and summarize existing observations of nscs , which appear to provide the most favorable environments for runaway sbh growth . in ",
    "3 we analytically explore the collisional growth of sbhs in nscs . in ",
    "4 we use idealized numerical studies to validate our analytic estimates and to test the importance of sbh multiplicity . in  5",
    "we examine the slowing and eventual termination of sbh growth through star capture . in  6 we discuss future observational tests of our model for massive black hole growth , and in  7 we offer conclusions .",
    "to set the stage for our discussion it is useful to summarize the properties of the dense ( primarily nuclear ) star clusters that we will be considering , and then to outline the primary physical processes occurring in these systems .",
    "these clusters can , with a great degree of simplification , be characterized by three parameters : mass @xmath16 , core radius @xmath17 , and half mass radius @xmath18 .",
    "we show distributions of some of these quantities in actual nscs ( taken from @xcite ) in fig .",
    "[ fig : nscdata ] , along with mean density @xmath19 , mean relaxation time @xmath20 , and average velocity dispersion @xmath21 . here",
    "we take the coulomb logarithm @xmath22 and assume mean stellar mass @xmath23 for simplicity .",
    "we provide more detail on these data sets , as well as best fit relations and variances between them , in appendix [ app : data ] .",
    "although all of these quantities have significant variance from their means , we see that nscs typically have @xmath24 .",
    "other work has established that this is generally correlated with , and comparable to , the velocity dispersion of the host galaxy @xcite .",
    "the characteristic sizes of nscs are typically @xmath25 , giving a wide range in @xmath26 .",
    "relaxation times at the half - mass radius @xmath27 are under a hubble time for @xmath28 of our sample . in reality , nscs are not simple two - parameter systems , and in particular exhibit a wide range of concentration parameters @xmath29 , where @xmath17 is the core radius of a roughly isothermal system , and @xmath30 @xcite , implying central densities @xmath31 that are a few orders of magnitude larger than @xmath26 .",
    "we plot the distributions of `` cluster - central '' quantities in fig .",
    "[ fig : nscdata2 ] .",
    "we note here that the definition of an nsc is not a completely rigorous one , and whether or not a galaxy s central surface brightness profile contains an nsc can be a subjective question .",
    "the data quality of the innermost observed isophotes , the number of components used in fitting the surface brightness profile , and assumptions about the radial dependence ( or lack thereof ) of a mass - to - light ratio are all important ingredients in determining whether there is an inner light excess that can be identified as an nsc .",
    "to some extent , however , this debate is a semantic one from the perspective of our calculations , which depend primarily on two measurable quantities : stellar density and stellar velocity dispersion .",
    "whether or not the center of a galaxy ( on @xmath32 scales ) is formally an nsc or is merely an inward continuation of a larger - scale surface brightness power law will not affect our results , so long as it has the same density and velocity dispersion in both scenarios .",
    "if a nsc lacks a massive black hole , how can it acquire one ? in the remainder of this section we consider two different `` collisional runaway '' channels .",
    "the first is the classical prompt collisional runaway that is sometimes theorized to occur in denser star clusters at high redshift ; we summarize past literature on this channel and explain why it is unlikely to occur for the nscs we observe at low redshift .",
    "the second is a relatively unexplored delayed collisional runaway channel , which forms the basis for the remainder of this paper .",
    "after the formation of a star cluster , its constituents will evolve toward energy equipartition : heavy cluster members , such as massive young stars or sbhs , will lose orbital energy to lighter members , and will mass segregate to the center of the cluster .",
    "recent n - body simulations indicate that star clusters may never reach a state of full energy equipartition , but nonetheless partial mass segregation does occur @xcite .",
    "if we consider a two component cluster made up of light masses @xmath33 and heavy masses @xmath34 , this occurs on a timescale @xmath35 , where @xmath36 is the energy relaxation time .",
    "extremely dense star clusters can undergo a prompt collisional runaway among massive young stars if the mean time between collisions , @xmath37 , becomes significantly less than the main sequence lifetime of very massive stars , @xmath38 .",
    "if this condition is satisfied , runaway collisions between main sequence stars will form a supermassive star of mass @xmath39 @xcite , which will eventually collapse to an intermediate mass black hole ( imbh ) due to the onset of gr instability ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the approximate central number densities required for formation of a supermassive star in this type of prompt collisional runaway are @xmath40 , roughly two orders of magnitude greater than the highest seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : nscdata ] .",
    "clusters could form at this density at high redshift due to dissipation in gas flows @xcite , or alternatively could reach central densities of this order via spitzer instability @xcite or a broader core collapse .    however , in the low redshift universe , this process is derailed by the nonzero metallicity of stellar participants .",
    "collision products will shed most of their mass through line - driven winds , thus forming stellar - mass compact remnants in supernova explosions ; even very low - metallicity progenitors of modest size ( @xmath41 ; @xmath42 ) lose enough mass via winds to prevent imbh formation @xcite .",
    "let us assume that there is no prompt collisional runaway ; instead , massive stars segregate to the center of the star cluster and die in supernovae there , leaving behind a smaller population of compact object remnants ( most neutron stars and likely some sbhs will escape in natal kicks ) .",
    "these sbhs will swap into primordial binaries in binary - single encounters , and the larger interaction cross - sections of these binaries will eventually lead to ejections of many black holes . as this process repeats ,",
    "the number of sbhs declines until either @xmath43 remain , or the sbh - sbh interaction time has become very long ( this competition between sbhs is analyzed through n - body integrations in  [ sec : numerics ] ) . even if our nsc is unlucky and loses all its sbhs in this process , the growth of nscs over time ( either through _ in situ _ or cluster accretion processes ) implies that it will eventually regain one .",
    "several different channels exist for the growth of an sbh in a gas - free star cluster , which we describe in quantitative detail in the appendices of this paper .",
    "the four growth channels we consider are the following , listed in order of increasing cross - section and probability :    1 .   gravitational wave capture of compact objects ( appendix [ sec : gw ] ) : two compact objects on hyperbolic orbits can capture into a bound orbit through emission of gws .",
    "2 .   direct collision with main sequence stars : a sbh can directly collide with a main sequence star if the pericenter of their encounter , @xmath44 , is less than the stellar radius @xmath45 .",
    "the end product of such a collision is highly uncertain .",
    "tidal disruption of main sequence stars ( appendix [ sec : tde ] ) : a sbh will tidally disrupt a main sequence star of mass @xmath46 if @xmath47 , where we have defined the tidal radius @xmath48 .",
    "up to half the stellar mass can accrete onto the sbh .",
    "4 .   tidal capture of main sequence stars ( appendix [ sec : tc ] ) : a sbh will tidally capture an unbound star into a bound orbit ( by dumping excess orbital energy into tidally - excited oscillation modes ) if @xmath49 , where @xmath50 is a function of stellar structure and cluster @xmath2 .",
    "depending on subsequent orbital evolution of this tidal capture ( tc ) binary , the star may be consumed by the sbh .",
    "collisional cross - sections are often enhanced by gravitational focusing of orbits , so that the impact parameter @xmath51 for a close - approach distance of @xmath44 is given by @xmath52 where @xmath53 and @xmath54 are the masses of the impactors .",
    "generic encounter rates can be calculated at leading order as @xmath55 , where @xmath56 is the density of targets , @xmath57 is the relative velocity between sbhs and their targets ( typically @xmath58 ) , and @xmath59 .    of these processes ,",
    "gw capture of compact objects has the smallest cross - section by far , and will generally be disregarded in this paper as a growth mechanism for sbhs ( see appendix [ sec : gw ] for a more detailed discussion ) . in",
    "the gravitationally focused limit , the rate of growth due to direct collisions is at most @xmath60 , but we neglect this channel both because it is unclear whether significant stellar mass will accrete , and because the exponential growth that is theoretically possible from direct collisions is slower than the super - exponential growth allowed by tidal processes .",
    "both tidal capture and tidal disruption scale as @xmath61 , a curve of super - exponential growth that formally goes to infinite mass in finite time . because the tidal capture process has the largest cross - section , tidal capture runaways are the most promising process for growing an imbh in nsc - like clusters that lack one .",
    "] , and we explore the onset and development of these runaways in the next section .",
    "in this section , we summarize our theoretical models for realistic nscs , and then apply simple analytic models for collisional growth of sbhs in these environments .",
    "although in principle tidal capture ( or other types of ) runaways can happen in open or globular clusters as well , runaway sbh growth is ultimately density - limited , and we therefore focus on the densest observed stellar systems in the universe : nscs .",
    "a worthwhile caveat is that more dense star clusters may have existed at high redshift , with central subclusters driven to even higher densities through gas dissipational processes @xcite .",
    "we use the three parameter potential - density pair described in @xcite to approximate the structure of all of these star clusters . specifically , the stellar density profile of a cluster with central density @xmath62 , core radius @xmath17 , and halo radius @xmath18 ( equivalent to the half - mass radius when @xmath63 ) is @xmath64 and the gravitational potential @xmath65,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the total cluster mass @xmath66 .",

    "finally , the central relaxation time is @xmath72 at distances @xmath73 , @xmath74 .",
    "the plausibility of collisional runaways in star clusters of fixed mass @xmath16 and halo ( roughly speaking , half mass ) radius @xmath18 depends critically on the size of the core , as @xmath75 .",
    "clusters lacking central heat sources will , over @xmath76 central relaxation times ( * ? ? ?",
    "* under the assumption of equal - mass stars in the cluster ) , enter a state of core collapse , as heat is slowly conducted out of the core , and @xmath17 approaches zero . in practical terms , the presence of primordial binaries in the core can arrest this collapse ( scattering of single stars off a hard binary will harden the binary further and heat the core , offsetting conductive heat losses ) . @xcite",
    "have argued that star clusters that possess @xmath77 can avoid this problem by `` burning through '' their entire population of primordial binaries .    to better quantify this argument ( and the possible existence of a @xmath78 threshold for strong susceptibility to core collapse )",
    ", we consider an equal mass binary with total mass @xmath79 in the core of a cluster with mean stellar mass @xmath80 .",
    "if this binary has a binding energy greater in magnitude than @xmath81 , the outcome of many cumulative three - body interactions will be to statistically harden it @xcite , heating the cluster and supporting it against core collapse .",
    "the rate at which the binary loses its binding energy @xmath82 to the cluster core is @xcite @xmath83 here the cluster central number density @xmath84 .",
    "notably , this hardening rate is independent of binary semimajor axis @xmath85 .",
    "slight gradients in the cluster temperature profile will conduct excess heat from the core to the outskirts at a rate @xmath86 , so if the cluster core contains @xmath87 binaries at any point in time , it will adjust to a steady - state size where heating balances conductive cooling and @xmath88 the dimensionless conductivity constant @xmath89 for single - mass clusters @xcite . using this approximation and taking @xmath90 , we find a central cluster density in steady state of @xmath91 this formula represents an upper limit on the central density of any collisional stellar system , and it decreases rapidly with the mass of central binaries ( note , however , that it assumes an equal - mass binary ) .",
    "the burn time for an individual binary to reach its minimum separation @xmath92 in such a cluster core is @xmath93 assuming a fraction @xmath94 of all cluster stars are born into primordial binaries , we find a total burn time of @xmath95 for a cluster to burn every one of its primordial binaries ; in the last equation we set @xmath96 for simplicity .",
    "we note that our choice of @xmath97 is likely quite conservative , as primordial binaries will tend to eject in strong three - body encounters once they reach a separation where their orbital speed is comparable to @xmath2 .",
    "therefore we expect most nscs to be able to burn through their primordial binaries in a hubble time , as argued by @xcite , provided they can reach the core on shorter timescales .    in reality , however , binaries are continuously transported to the core by the slow process of dynamical friction in an extended nsc . assuming that the orbital speed for binaries is at most mildly supersonic ,",
    "we can write an approximate dynamical friction timescale for a binary on a circular orbit : @xmath98 where we use the 1d velocity dispersion , take @xmath99 , and define an average cluster density @xmath100 .",
    "we therefore conclude that only relatively dense star clusters , with @xmath101 , have both sufficient energy to burn through their primordial binaries and the ability to do this in a hubble time .",
    "another complication to the simple cluster model presented above is the possible presence of a `` cavity '' in the center of the cluster , excavated by the scattering interactions of main sequence stars with a dense subcluster of compact objects .",
    "we can estimate the size of this cavity by calculating how long it takes for a star to have a sufficiently close ( focused ) encounter with a sbh such that it receives a kick velocity greater than the core escape velocity @xmath102 here we assume that we are looking at older populations of spitzer - stable sbhs ; this analysis does not apply at very early times in the cluster s history when a spitzer - unstable sbh subcluster may exist .    by assumption , the @xmath103 sbhs are in energy equipartition , with @xmath104 ; this implies that they inhabit a characteristic radius @xmath105 .",
    "a star - sbh scattering event will likely result in the star being ejected from the cluster core if the closest approach is within @xmath106 . by",
    "taking the gravitationally focused limit and the number density of sbhs , we can compute a per - orbit probability for a star to be ejected , @xmath107 .",
    "the ejection timescale @xmath108 is , for stars within the cluster core , @xmath109 in fig .",
    "[ fig : cavity ] , we make a contour plot of the ratio of @xmath110 .",
    "when this ratio is less than unity , a cavity can be evacuated in the central regions of the cluster core , but when it is greater than unity , stars will diffuse inward to refill the core faster than they are ejected . interestingly , this ratio does not depend on @xmath17 or @xmath18 independently , but only on @xmath111 . in general , we find that cavities only exist for small and highly concentrated clusters . however , such clusters can not exist in a steady state so long as at least one binary exists as a heat source in the cluster core , as is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : cavity ] .",
    "furthermore , it is actually large and highly concentrated clusters that are most relevant for tidal capture runaways , so we neglect the effect of a cavity for the following discussion ( but see  [ sec : outcomes2 ] for how a different type of cavity can form at late times ) .",

    "we also plot contours of equilibrium @xmath111 for a cluster of a given mass heated by @xmath87 binaries of mass @xmath115 ( eq . [ eq : rceq ] ) .",
    "these are shown as dashed red lines with associated labels , and the shaded red region is a portion of parameter space forbidden provided there is at least one binary in the cluster core .",

    ", dynamical mass measurements only put upper limits on the presence of an smbh , and these upper limits are generally well below the predicted saturation mass .",
    "this implies that , as expected , a tidal capture runaway has not occurred in these low velocity dispersion systems .",
    "this low-@xmath8 result is in reasonable agreement with our prediction that nscs must have a minimum central density in order to begin growing sbhs through runaway star capture . as we see in fig .",
    "[ fig : tcrates ] , it is only nscs with @xmath299 that possess high enough central density to enter the runaway regime within a hubble time .",
    "this impressive pair of observational coincidences - the lack of smbhs in galaxies with @xmath309 _ and _ the unfavorably low central densities of nscs in galaxies with @xmath310 - is a nontrivial piece of circumstantial evidence in favor of our model for the birth of massive black holes in galaxies of moderate velocity dispersion .",
    "the evidence for imbhs in the nuclei of dwarf or other galaxies is mixed , but these observations are a crucial discriminant between models of smbh seed formation , which predict very different minimum imbh masses : @xmath311 for pop iii supernovae , @xmath312 for traditional `` runaway collision '' scenarios , and @xmath313 for direct collapse of high-@xmath314 minihalos . in our scenario , we expect a distribution of black hole masses ; if the runaway time is @xmath315 , then typically @xmath316 .",
    "it is possible for our scenario to produce smaller imbhs in clusters where the runaway time is @xmath317 , but because this requires some tuning we expect these to be rare .",
    "our model therefore predicts a general minimum imbh mass at @xmath318 , and the distribution or even existence of small imbhs offers a promising way to falsify our predictions .    due to the difficulty of dynamical mass measurements in dwarf galaxies , the most common avenues for imbh detection are indirect .",
    "searches for agn in dwarf galaxies have returned many hundreds of promising candidates @xcite .",
    "the smallest of these have lower mass limits @xmath319 based on luminosity arguments @xcite",
    ". a smaller number of dwarf galaxies have dynamical mass estimates for central bhs ; one particularly exciting recent result found a @xmath320 @xcite .",
    "we note that other , future , avenues for imbh detection do exist . for example , the halo of the milky way galaxy may host many imbhs left over from the interplay between hierarchical structure formation scenarios and gw recoil during imbh - imbh mergers @xcite .",
    "while these wandering imbhs are in principle detectable by the hypercompact stellar systems that surround them , none have been found to date @xcite .",
    "the existence of a large population of imbhs with @xmath321 would not be expected in the context of our model , and there is not yet clear evidence that such a population exists .",
    "a final consistency check for our model is the rate of stellar tidal disruption events . from fig .",
    "[ fig : mdotedd ] we see that an nsc hosting a massive black hole of mass @xmath276 should be tidally disrupting stars at a rate @xmath322 , depending on the host nsc @xmath2 .",
    "these numbers are roughly consistent with empirically calculated rates of stellar tidal disruption @xcite , although we caution that these empirical tde rates are based on extrapolating directly determined tde rates in larger galaxies down to smaller masses ( where surface brightness profiles can not be resolved on the relevant scales ) .",
    "a more useful constraint is the volumetric tidal disruption rate , as this is dominated by the smallest galaxies which host central massive bhs @xcite .",
    "although our current sample of observed tidal disruption flares is small and suffers from selection effects ( roughly a dozen optically selected events , and a similar number detected through soft x - ray emission ) , it appears that the volumetric event rate inferred from observations is at the extreme low end of theoretical predictions @xcite , which may imply an absence of low mass ( @xmath323 ) black holes in the low redshift universe @xcite .",
    "although individual tdes may arise from smaller imbhs @xcite .",
    "] , a high occupation fraction of imbhs in dwarf galaxies would be hard to reconcile with the observed low volumetric tde rate .",
    "we note here that past works have shown that star capture can contribute significantly both to the mass growth of small smbhs @xcite , and to the lower end of the x - ray agn luminosity function @xcite .",
    "however , these past arguments have been based on present - day observations of low - mass smbhs and their host galaxies .",
    "the most novel contribution of this paper is the self - consistent evolutionary picture we have presented , which shows how these low - mass smbhs must emerge from nscs above a certain @xmath62 and @xmath2 threshold .",
    "we have shown that stellar mass black holes in nuclear star clusters will undergo runaway growth into imbhs through tidal interactions with cluster stars . at early times ( @xmath324 )",
    "this process is super - exponential and is dominated by unbound stars . at intermediate times ( @xmath325 ) black hole growth is dominated by bound stars from the full loss cone regime and is initially super - exponential , but slows as the cluster core depletes . at later times , the imbh has eaten the entire mass of the cluster core and its diffusion - limited growth slows substantially , saturating at a finite value @xmath326 , as derived in eq .",
    "[ eq : msat ] ( or , for high-@xmath2 systems , at a value @xmath327 ) .",
    "thus the final mass of a massive black hole grown solely through tidal interactions with stars in an nsc depends primarily on the nsc velocity dispersion @xmath2 .",
    "we emphasize that theoretical uncertainties remain concerning both the processes of tidal disruption and tidal capture . in the simplest models for tidal disruption events , exactly @xmath328 of the stellar mass",
    "is bound to and accreted by the black hole @xcite ; however , it is possible that the dissipative processes required to form an accretion disk may unbind a large fraction of the initially bound gas @xcite . whether this occurs in practice is an open question in tde research . even if this type of `` leakiness '' deactivates tidal disruption as a growth channel",
    ", tidal captures will continue to grow the black hole . while this channel may deactivate at higher ( @xmath312 ) imbh masses , this is not certain , and the buildup of a tight cluster of bound stars may lead to a cascade of soft collisions , inflating the stars and allowing them to be consumed .",
    "we also note that both channels imply that a sbh seed that grows into an imbh or smbh in a hubble time will likely pass through phases of super - eddington growth ; this is commonly assumed to be possible in the tidal disruption literature but the exact accretion physics remains uncertain .    in order for runaway growth to occur , the star cluster must be dense , with a sbh - star tidal interaction rate @xmath329 .",
    "this corresponds to physical ( cluster core ) densities @xmath330 . from a theoretical perspective ,",
    "such densities are achievable in a nsc that enters a state of core collapse .",
    "although we consider additional physical processes such as dynamical friction and the finite time required for binary burning , we are in general agreement with the argument of @xcite that primordial binaries should not be able to halt core collapse in clusters with @xmath77 .",
    "the scenario presented in this paper differs from analogous `` collisional runaway '' scenarios in the literature by its delayed nature .",
    "previous runaway scenarios typically invoke much higher densities @xmath62 so that either a supermassive star can be formed on a timescale short compared to the stellar evolution time @xmath331 @xcite , or so that runaway gw capture can occur in a dark subcluster of compact remnants without termination due to ejection @xcite .",
    "unlike these scenarios , ours unfolds over longer timescales and is therefore not as promising a candidate for production of high-@xmath314 quasars .",
    "however , the central stellar densities required by our scenario appear achievable in many current low-@xmath314 nscs , making a process like the one described in this paper relevant for the evolution of small galactic nuclei .",
    "more specifically , we expect massive black holes to be largely absent from nscs with @xmath332 , and generally present in larger nscs .",
    "the general physical considerations outlined above appear to be consistent with current observational data on nscs .",
    "firstly , the distribution of dynamically measured smbh masses and mass upper limits is in good agreement with the predicted transition @xmath2 from the @xcite argument , and smbh masses above this transition @xmath2 agree with our predicted saturation mass @xmath306 . in significantly larger galaxies , @xmath333 , implying smbh growth in this regime",
    "is dominated by non - tidal processes , as is expected from the soltan - paczynski argument .",
    "secondly , we analyze the nsc sample of @xcite and find that essentially no nscs with @xmath332 are dense enough to be unstable to a tidal runaway . for a sufficiently large velocity dispersion system ,",
    "we predict either a smbh grown up to the saturation mass via the tidal processes we have discussed , or one which has passed this point and has grown to still larger mass via large scale gas accretion .    in this paper",
    ", we have shown that tidal capture and disruption of stars will inevitably grow stellar mass black holes into imbhs or smbhs in less than a hubble time provided the host star cluster is sufficiently dense .",
    "although large smbhs in the universe ultimately grow via other mechanisms @xcite , the processes outlined in this paper appear sufficient to explain the bottom end of the smbh mass function . the critical density required to initiate runaway growth _",
    "is not observed to occur _ in the smallest nscs , as we expect from simple theoretical considerations first outlined in @xcite .",
    "however , larger nscs often exceed this central density threshold , and many of these nscs likely possess unresolved massive black holes .",
    "the predictions of our model would be improved by future dynamical work to determine the evolution of tight stellar clusters formed by tidal capture , as well as hydrodynamical simulations of tdes that robustly determine the fraction of stellar mass accreted . on the observational side , x - ray observations ( * ? ? ?",
    "* for example ) of the densest nscs may be useful for determining the present - day rate of black hole growth in these dynamically rich systems .",

    "denser objects will emit significant energy in gravitational radiation during close encounters .",
    "an unbound pair of compact objects can thus become bound via a gravitational brehmsstralung process ; the maximum impact parameter for this to occur is @xcite @xmath342 corresponding to a maximum pericenter distance of @xmath343 where the symmetric mass ratio @xmath344 and @xmath345 is the velocity of the two compact objects at infinity . in the second line of this equation",
    "we have set @xmath346 . following this capture event ,",
    "the compact object binary will evolve from an extremely high - eccentricity orbit under the influence of gravitational radiation .    the very small cross - section for gw capture disfavors this sbh growth mechanism relative to tidal interactions with stars .",
    "gw capture is further disfavored by the large recoil velocities the sbhs will receive due to anisotropic emission of gws during their merger .",
    "these velocities are typically @xmath347 , but with a long tail going up to @xmath348 @xcite .",
    "this is large enough to eject the merged sbh from not just its nsc , but frequently even its host galaxy and halo .",
    "at intermediate impact parameters , stars passing close to stellar mass black holes will be tidally disrupted .",
    "pericenters vulnerable to tidal disruption will lie interior to the tidal radius , @xmath349 following disruption , the stellar debris will follow ballistic trajectories with a frozen - in spread of specific energy @xcite , @xmath350 generally , @xmath351 , meaning that half the star will be unbound and fly off to infinity , while the other half will eventually return to the sbh on highly eccentric orbits .",
    "these bound debris streams will collisionally shock each other and circularize into a super - eddington accretion disk after order unity pericenter returns , although the details of circularization are unclear : although they are likely mediated by gr precession around smbhs @xcite , near stellar mass bhs the tidal radius is very non - relativistic and purely hydrodynamic effects may prevail @xcite .",
    "regardless , a sbh will likely accrete @xmath352 of the tidally disrupted star .",
    "recently , @xcite suggested that the true accretion fraction may be significantly lower than @xmath353 because of the large energy hierarchy in the problem : @xmath351 , so the absorption of even a small fraction of the accretion luminosity will suffice to unbind a majority of the stellar debris bound to the black hole .",
    "if this argument is correct , it would drastically reduce the ability of tdes to contribute to sbh mass growth .",
    "however , the analytic argument of @xcite was designed to apply to smbh tdes , where the energy hierarchy is more than an order of magnitude stronger than it is for sbh tdes .",
    "realistic numerical simulations capable of testing this argument have not yet been run for smbh tdes , but at lower mass ratios ( @xmath354 ) they have , and there is no evidence for the ejection of the bound debris @xcite .",
    "at larger separations , tidal excitation of modes can bind a sbh to a star initially on a mildly hyperbolic orbit .",
    "the excess orbital energy is deposited into the mechanical oscillation of normal modes in the star , putting the two onto an eccentric bound orbit . in order for successful capture to occur the energy deposited into modes , @xmath196 , must exceed the hyperbolic orbital energy @xmath355 . if we decompose the modes into spherical harmonics @xmath356 with radial mode numbers @xmath56 , we can follow @xcite to write @xmath357 here the dimensionless mode - orbit coupling constant @xmath358 is broken down into two distinct components : a dimensionless overlap integral @xmath359 measuring normal modes inside a given stellar structure model , and a dimensionless tidal coupling integral @xmath360 .",

    "the second term introduces a variance of the friction term , and even allows the sbhs to be accelerated when the velocity of a sbh gets sufficiently small .",
    "the third term introduces a change in velocity perpendicular to the direction of motion of the sbh .",

    "we draw a random orientation before adding the perpendicular velocity change to the respective sbh . hence , the sbh s modified velocity , @xmath413 , is computed using @xmath414 the change of energy , @xmath415 , of the orbiting black hole due to phase - space diffusion is given back to the stellar background potential , with @xmath416 .",
    "as a consequence of this energy transfer , inspiralling black holes will cause an expansion of the nsc . for this purpose",

    "we can calculate a new radius for the stellar background potential at each integration step . for the plummer sphere",
    "the new scale radius can be calculated as @xmath420      for each sbh we compute the probability of capturing or disrupting one or many background stars during each time step .",
    "according to eq .",
    "[ eq : tcrate ] , the tidal - capture rates are estimated as @xmath421 where the number density of stars is @xmath145 = @xmath422 with a mean stellar mass of 0.45m@xmath423 . the tidal - capture cross section , @xmath411 , is given by @xmath424 where @xmath425 is the total mass of sbh plus star , and @xmath426 is the relative velocity between the two ( which we approximate as the local velocity dispersion @xmath2 ) .",
    "the tidal radius is given by @xmath427 , with @xmath428 being the mean stellar radius approximated as @xmath429 . from these rates we calculate tidal capture probabilities by assuming they are constant throughout one time step .",
    "since our time steps are small fractions of the nsc s crossing time , this assumption is a good approximation .    using this tidal capture probabilities , we let the sbhs grow on a monte carlo basis .",
    "we distinguish between tidal capture and disruption events , which have related cross sections , by assuming that a fraction of the capture events are disruptions .",
    "each tidal capture results in the respective sbh gaining one mean stellar mass , @xmath46 , whereas disruptions increase the sbh mass by @xmath430 ( see  3 ) .",
    "however , there remains a notable shortcoming of this numerical approach : the plummer sphere has a fixed ratio of core radius to half - mass radius ( @xmath431 ) ; realistic clusters exhibit wide variance in this ratio , and the large central densities of highly concentrated clusters are more favorable to tidal capture runaways . in this sense",
    "our simulations are conservative with regard to the onset of runaway sbh growth , and we are currently performing analogous few - body simulations using the potential - density pair of @xcite to generalize these results .",
    "the code ar - chain includes pn terms up to order 2.5 .",
    "the sbhs can therefore merge via gravitational wave emission .",
    "we include gravitational wave recoils following the prescription outlined in @xcite , which is based on the fitting formula by @xcite . to save computational time ,",
    "we assume that a merger will be inevitable when the separation between two sbhs gets smaller than 10000 schwarzschild radii . at the moment of the merger ,",
    "we assume that the spin vectors of the two sbhs are randomly aligned .",
    "this results in kick velocities of up to several thousand kms@xmath432 , with a median kick of @xmath433kms@xmath432 .",
    "since our simulations focus on nsc with relatively low escape velocities , this implies that a majority of the merging sbhs escape from the nscs .",
    "black holes can also eject each other via strong three - body interactions .",
    "we remove sbhs from the simulations once they move beyond 1kpc from the nsc , assuming that it will take them more than a hubble time to find their way back into the center of the host galaxy .",
    "the simulation results presented in  4 are based on a set of 9 runs with the single - body code and 9 runs with the few - body code .",
    "the characteristics of the nscs in both sets are the same , but while the one - body simulations show us the evolution of a single sbh in these nscs , the few - body code follows 10 sbhs as they grow and interact .",
    "we use the mcluster code to generate initial conditions for these simulations @xcite .",
    "the 10 sbh follow a simple mass function with slope @xmath434 between 5m@xmath423 and 20m@xmath423 , resulting in the most massive sbh having 20m@xmath423 and the next - most massive sbh having a mass of 11m@xmath423 .",
