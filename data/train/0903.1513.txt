    "based on the fact that the interaction between the @xmath3 meson and nucleon is attractive , haider and liu postulated the existence of a new kind of matter in form of @xmath3-nucleus bound states  @xcite .",
    "because the @xmath3 meson is neutral such a system can be formed only via the strong interaction which distinguishes it qualitatively from exotic atoms where the meson is bound via the electromagnetic force . therefore the search for a signature of an @xmath3-mesic nucleus is interesting on its own account , additionally the experimental determination of the width and binding energy of @xmath3-mesic nuclei would provide a valuable input for studies of the @xmath4 interaction .",
    "it would provide information about properties of the @xmath5 embedded in nuclei , the behavior of the @xmath3 meson in the nuclear medium  @xcite , and for the determination of the flavor singlet component of the @xmath3 meson  @xcite .",
    "the formation of a bound state can only take place in nuclei , for which the real part of the @xmath3nucleus scattering length is negative ( attractive nature of the @xmath3nucleus interaction ) , and the modulus of the real part of @xmath3nucleus scattering length is greater than the modulus of its imaginary part  @xcite : @xmath6 the relatively small value of the s - wave @xmath3n scattering length known in 1980 s ( @xmath7  fm  @xcite ) implied the possibility of forming an @xmath3mesic nuclei only for a  @xmath8  12  @xcite .",
    "this estimation was strengthened by calculations of li  @xcite .",
    "however , recent theoretical considerations of hadronic- and photoproduction of the @xmath3 meson result in a wide range of possible values of the @xmath3nucleon s - wave scattering lengths from @xmath9  fm up to @xmath10  fm , with the suggested average value of @xmath11  fm",
    ". such a high value of the @xmath3nucleon scattering length may enable the formation of a bound @xmath3nucleus states in light nuclei region such as @xmath12  @xcite and even in the deuteron  @xcite . according to the calculations including multiple scattering theory  @xcite and skyrme model",
    "@xcite an especially good candidate for binding is the @xmath13 system .",
    "it should be stated that at present there is no univocal picture of this issue and results presented in article  @xcite indicate that the ratio of the predicted width to the binding energy becomes bigger for lighter nuclei which can make an observation of the bound state in light nuclei more difficult .",
    "however , there are promissing indirect experimental observations which may be interpreted as an indications of @xmath3-helium bound states .",
    "for example analysis of the data from the close to threshold measurements of the total cross section for the @xmath14 reaction by spes-4  @xcite and spes-2  @xcite collaborations suggested a possible existence of the bound @xmath15 system since within the experimental errors the condition given in eq .  [",
    "11 ] could be fulfilled .",
    "a search for a @xmath3nucleus bound state has also been performed in the hadronic channel at the cooler synchrotron cosy , where the cosy-11 and anke collaborations independently , using different detection setups , performed measurements of the excitation function and differential cross sections for the @xmath14 reaction in the vicinity of the kinematical threshold  @xcite .",
    "both groups used the momentum ramping technique of the beam deuterons in order to reduce the systematic errors .",
    "measurements have been performed with beam momenta varying from below the reaction threshold , up to an excess energy of about 8.5  mev in the case of the cosy-11 experiment and about 11.5  mev in the case of the anke experiment .",
    "data taken by the cosy-11 group were used to search for a signal of a @xmath16 bound state below the @xmath3 production threshold , via the @xmath17 and @xmath18 reactions  @xcite , while the measurements above the threshold enabled the study of the forward - backward asymmetries of the differential cross sections and the extraction of the @xmath19 scattering length .",
    "the data of both groups  @xcite shows a variation in the phase of the s - wave amplitude in the near - threshold region , consistent with possible existence of a bound state  @xcite .",
    "the first direct experimental indications of a light @xmath3-nucleus bound system was reported by the taps collaboration in the @xmath3 photoproduction reaction @xmath20  @xcite . there",
    "the difference between excitation functions for two ranges of the @xmath21 relative angle in the center - of - mass frame revealed a structure which was interpreted as a possible signature of a bound state .",
    "however , it was claimed that due to the limited statistics the result could also be interpreted as an evidence for a virtual state  @xcite .",
    "therefore a new , statistically more significant experimental confirmation is needed .",
    "the experimental method is based on a measurement of the excitation function for the chosen decay channels of the @xmath22 system and the search for a resonance - like structure below the @xmath22 threshold .",
    "the measurement was performed by applying a continuous variation of the beam momentum around the threshold and @xmath23 meson production in @xmath24 and @xmath25 reactions  @xcite ] . the relative angle between the outgoing @xmath26 pair which originates from the decay of the n*(1535 ) resonance created via absorption of the @xmath3 meson on a nucleon in the @xmath27 nucleus , is equal to 180@xmath28 in the @xmath29 reference frame .",
    "it is smeared by about 30@xmath28 in the center - of - mass frame ( see fig .  [ angle ] ) due to the fermi motion of the nucleons inside the @xmath27 nucleus .",
    "the center - of - mass kinetic energies of the nucleon and pion originate from the mass difference @xmath30 and are around 50 mev and 350 mev , respectively .",
    "[ angle ] shows that the distribution of the relative @xmath31 angle expected for the background due to the prompt @xmath32 reaction is much broader than the one expected from the decay of the bound state .",
    "this will allow to control the background by comparing `` signal - rich '' and `` signal - poor '' regions .",
    "the experiment was carried out with the wasa - at - cosy detector , and with the internal deutron beam of cosy scattered on a deuteron pellet target .",
    "a detailed detector description can be found in  @xcite .",
    "we used a slowly ramped beam momentum scanning the range of momenta corresponding to a variation of the excess energy for the @xmath2he@xmath3 system from -51.4  mev to 22  mev .",
    "this range is about three times wider than the width of the structure observed by the taps collaboration at mami in the @xmath20 process ( @xmath33 )  mev .",
    "the charged pions and protons are registered in the forward detector as well as in the central detector .",
    "@xmath34-ions are detected in the forward detector only .",
    "[ ptheta ] presents an example of the angular distributions of ejectiles expected for the @xmath35 reaction .",
    "the simulations were conducted under the assumption that the decay of the bound state is caused by the decay of the @xmath29 into a proton @xmath36 pair leaving the @xmath37 nucleus as a spectator with the fermi momentum which it possessed inside the @xmath38 nucleus . the fig .",
    "[ ptheta ] shows that a significant fraction of the angular range of the outgoing particles is covered by the wasa - at - cosy detector setup .",
    "in particular , about 80% of @xmath37 ions can be registered by means of the forward detector ( left panel of fig .",
    "[ ptheta ] ) and a coincident measurement of all ejectiles from @xmath35 reaction can be performed with an efficency of 70 % which is flat in the whole range of the excess energy from -51.4  mev to 22  mev .",
    "in june 2008 a test measurement of the production of @xmath39 , @xmath40 as well as of @xmath41 and @xmath42 in the dd collisions with the wasa - at - cosy facility was performed .",
    "the analysis of the energy signals from the forward detector revealed that it is possible to identify clearly the @xmath37 ions . in fig.[de ] the experimental distribution of the energy loss in the window counter versus the energy deposited in the range hodoscope is compared to the expectation based on monte - carlo simulations .",
    "unfortunately , at the time of the experiment the cooling system of the superconducting solenoid was not working and we had to perform the measurement without magnetic field . that fact excluded the possibility of a direct momentum determination in the central detector as well as the use of the standard wasa - at - cosy identification method for the charged particles registered in the central detector .",
    "however , for the momentum determination of the charged particles in the central detector the information about directions of the particles in the central detector , as well as , the momentum of the @xmath27 nuclei can be used .",
    "the absolute @xmath43 momentum was determined on the basis of energy losses in the forward detector and its direction was reconstructed from signals in the set of drift chambers built out of straw detectors .",
    "the directions of charged particles in central detector were extracted from signals in the 17 layers of the central drift chamber and from the electromagnetic calorimeter . knowing the beam momentum , the @xmath43 momentum , and the directions of the two other particles one can derive the momenta of pion and proton assuming energy and momentum conservation  ( see fig .",
    "[ momrecovstrue ] ) .",
    "energy loss in the plastic scintillator combined with the energy deposited in the electromagnetic calorimeter was used to identify protons and pions .    at present",
    "we have established the excitation function for the @xmath44 reaction only .",
    "the result may be considered as a very conservative estimation of the upper limit for the prompt @xmath45 reaction .",
    "the excitation function obtained is presented in fig .",
    "[ excitations ] .",
    "please note that the shape of the angular distribution ( right panel ) is consistent with the expectations shown in fig .",
    "[ angle](right ) . in the left panel of fig .",
    "[ excitations ] the excitation function for the angular range between 160 and 200 degrees is presented .",
    "we conduct a search for the @xmath46 bound state with the wasa - at - cosy facility . because of the very high acceptance of the proton - pion pairs and good identification of helium nuclei the detector system is very well suited for this kind of experiment . in june 2008",
    "we performed a first measurement of the excitation functions for the @xmath47 reaction .",
    "the experiment will be continued in the year 2010 .",
    "two weeks of cosy beamtime were already recommended by the cosy program advisory committee . the use of the magnetic field will permit better proton - pion identification , as well as a better momentum determination in the central detector .    in two weeks of planned measurement , with the assumed luminosity of , we expect to reach a sensitivity in the order of a few nb with a statistical significance of 1 @xmath48 . in the case of no observation of a signal this result will significantly lower the upper limit for the existence of a bound state .",
