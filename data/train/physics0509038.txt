    "avoided crossings of eigenvalue curves are generic features of quantum systems with non - integrable classical counterparts @xcite .",
    "their appearance allows for a wide variety of interesting , purely quantum mechanical , phenomena including chaos - assisted tunneling @xcite , the adiabatic exchange of eigenstate character @xcite , and generally provides the mechanism by which underlying classical chaos affects the dynamics of a quantum system @xcite .",
    "their existence is also responsible for perhaps the most well - known result in the field of quantum chaos , the non - poisson statistical distribution of level spacings in `` chaotic '' quantum systems @xcite .    in systems with two parameters , an avoided crossing along any curve in parameter space can be associated to a `` diabolical point '' at which two eigenvalue _ surfaces _ become degenerate @xcite .",
    "the conical shape of the two eigenvalue surfaces in the vicinity of such a diabolical point ensures the characteristic hyperbolic behavior of two eigenvalues along any curve in parameter space passing near , but not through , the diabolical point . in the particular case of a near - integrable system",
    ", one parameter may be fixed to be zero leaving the system integrable for all values of the other parameter .",
    "eigencurves will freely cross under variation of the latter parameter , thus creating diabolical points of the associated eigenvalue surfaces when viewed in the full two - parameter space . as we show here",
    ", this type of diabolical point is important because perturbation theory can be applied to characterize the conical shape and therefore characterize the avoided crossings of the near - integrable system .    in this paper",

    "it is of significant experimental interest in quantum mechanics since it has been implemented in a number of studies @xcite through the use of cold atom optics , particularly in investigations of multiple - state dynamical tunneling @xcite .",
    "theoretically , it provides a convenient framework for studying the avoided crossings of near - integrable systems since for @xmath1 the system is the integrable pendulum hamiltonian .    in the following , we study the properties of avoided crossings for the driven pendulum with the use of floquet theory .",
    "an avoided crossing of two floquet eigenvalue curves ( for @xmath2 ) can be associated to a level crossing of the integrable pendulum ( @xmath3 ) system and is characterized by the dependence of its closest approach on the non - integrability parameter @xmath4 . for small values of @xmath4 , we find that the spacing exhibits a power law dependence with an integer power . a modified degenerate perturbation theory is then applied to verify this dependence and associate it to the direct or indirect coupling of the associated integrable eigenstates .",
    "we then use the perturbation results to elucidate a multiple state dynamical tunneling process in the vicinity of an avoided crossing and apply the results to the particular achievement of this tunneling in an atom optics experiment .",
