    "note , however , that using the @xmath39 or the anti-@xmath39 algorithm leads to negligible changes in our predictions .",

    "in @xcite we performed a detailed study of several bfkl scenarios , from a pure ll approximation ( ll green s function and leading order jet vertex ) to a full nll calculation ( nll green s function and nll jet vertex ) .",
    "the main conclusion is that there is a dramatic effect when passing from a mixed treatment , which combines ll vertices with nll green s function , to a full nll approach , of magnitude similar to the one when passing from a pure ll result to the mixed treatment : the inclusion of nll corrections inside the jets vertices is therefore essential .",
    "note that the effect of collinear improvement in the nll green s function is very small when using the nll jet vertices .",
    "the inclusion of the whole set of nll corrections leads to decorrelation effects which are much smaller than expected .",
    "still , there remains a sizable difference between the full nll approach and the fixed order predictions at next - to - leading order ( nlo ) for the ratios @xmath47 and @xmath48 , when taking into account theoretical uncertainties .    to study the need for high - energy resummation with respect to fixed order treatments",
    ", one should however pay attention to the fact that these fixed order calculations have instabilities when the lower cuts on the transverse momenta of the jets are identical .",

    "we found that for the observables @xmath2 no significant difference is observed when taking into account the scale uncertainties . on the other hand , for @xmath47 and @xmath48 the two calculations lead to noticeably different results . since these observables are quite stable with respect to scale variations , they are well - suited to study resummation effects at high energy .",
