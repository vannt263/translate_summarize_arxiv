    "-5 mm    recently , a host of important results on graph colouring have been obtained via the probabilistic method .",
    "the first author presented an invited lecture at the 2002 international congress of mathematicians surveying a number of these results .",
    "the recent monograph @xcite provides a more in depth survey of the topic .",
    "this paper presents one example of a result proven using the method .",
    "an instance of list colouring consists of a graph @xmath0 and a list @xmath5 of colours for each vertex @xmath6 of @xmath0 .",
    "we are asked to determine if there is an _ acceptable _ colouring of @xmath0 , that is a colouring in which each vertex receives a colour from its list , and no edge has both its endpoints coloured with the same colour .",
    "the _ list - chromatic number _ of @xmath0 , denoted @xmath7 is the minimum integer @xmath8 such that for every assignment of a list @xmath5 of size at least @xmath8 to every vertex @xmath6 of @xmath0 , there exist an acceptable colouring of @xmath0 .",
    "the list - chromatic number was introduced by vizing @xcite , and independently erds et al .",
    "this parameter has received a considerable amount of attention in recent years ( see , e.g. @xcite , @xcite ) .    clearly , by definition , @xmath9 because @xmath10 precisely if an acceptable colouring exists when each @xmath11 is @xmath12 . however , the converse inequality is not true , e.g. @xmath13 as can be easily verified by considering figure [ fst ] .",
    "in fact , there are bipartite graphs with arbitrarily high chromatic number ( indeed even for bipartite @xmath0 , @xmath7 is bounded from below by a function of the minimum degree which goes to infinity , see @xcite ) .",
    "this shows that the gap between @xmath14 and @xmath15 can be arbitrarily large .",
    "moreover it shows that @xmath15 can not be bound by any function of the chromatic number of @xmath0 .",
    "this gives rise to the following intriguing question in the theory of graph colourings : find conditions which guarantee the equality of the chromatic and list - chromatic numbers .",
    "there are many conjectures hypothesizing conditions on @xmath0 which imply that @xmath16 . probably , the most famous of these is the list colouring conjecture ( see @xcite ) which states that this is true if @xmath0 is a line graph .",
    "one interesting example of a graph with @xmath17 was obtained in the original paper of erds et al .",
    "they proved that if @xmath0 is complete @xmath8-partite graph with each part of size two then @xmath18 .",
    "it took nearly twenty years until ohba @xcite noticed that this example is actually part of much larger phenomenon .",
    "he conjectured ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) that @xmath19 provided @xmath20 .",
    "this conjecture if it is correct is best possible .",
    "indeed , let @xmath0 be a complete @xmath8-partite graph with @xmath21 parts of size @xmath22 and one part of size @xmath23 .",
    "then the number of vertices of @xmath0 is @xmath24 , the chromatic number is @xmath8 and it was proved in @xcite that list - chromatic number of @xmath0 is at least @xmath25 .    in his original paper ohba obtained that @xmath26 for all graphs @xmath0 with @xmath27 .",
    "his conjecture was settled for some other special cases in @xcite . recently",
    "the result of ohba was substantially improved by the authors of this paper . in @xcite",
    "they proved that ohba s conjecture is true for all graphs @xmath0 with at most @xmath28 vertices . in this paper",
    "we want to improve this result for large graphs and prove that the conjecture is asymptotically correct .",
    "more precisely we obtain the following theorem .",
    "[ maint ] for any @xmath2 , there exist an @xmath3 such that @xmath26 provided @xmath29 .    the rest of this paper is organized as follows . in the next section",
    "we describe the main steps in the proof of theorem [ maint ] .",
    "more precisely , we present our key lemma and show how to deduce from it the assertion of the theorem",
    ". we will prove this lemma using probabilistic arguments . in sections 3 and 4",
    "we discuss the main ideas we are going to use in the proof .",
    "we present the details of the proof in section 5 .",
    "finally , the last section of the paper contains some concluding remarks .",
    "-5 mm    in this section we present the main steps in the proof of theorem [ maint ] .",
    "first we need the following lemma from @xcite whose short proof we include here for the sake of completeness .    [ lessn ] for any integer @xmath30 , if @xmath31 then there exist a set of lists @xmath32 for which there is no acceptable colouring such that each list has at least @xmath30 elements and the set @xmath33 has size less than @xmath34 .",
    "* proof . *",
    "assume @xmath35 and choose a set of lists @xmath32 for which there is no acceptable colouring , in which each list has size at least @xmath30 and which minimizes @xmath36 .",
    "now , if @xmath37 then we are done .",
    "so , we can assume the contrary .",
    "we consider the bipartite graph @xmath38 with bipartition @xmath39 and an edge between @xmath40 and @xmath6 precisely if @xmath41 . if there is a matching of size @xmath42 in @xmath38 then this matching saturates @xmath43 and points out an acceptable colouring for the list colouring instance in which no colour is used more than once . since , there is no such acceptable colouring , no such matching exists .",
    "thus there must be a smallest subset @xmath44 of @xmath45 which is not the set of endpoints of a matching in this graph and this set must have at most @xmath42 elements .",
    "clearly , @xmath44 contains at least two vertices .",
    "now , by the minimality of @xmath44 there is a matching @xmath46 in @xmath38 of size @xmath47 whose endpoints in @xmath45 are in @xmath44 .",
    "further , classical results in matching theory ( see e.g. theorem 1.1.3 of @xcite ) tell us that if @xmath48 is the set of endpoints of @xmath46 in @xmath43 then for @xmath49 , we have @xmath50 .",
    "let @xmath51 be any vertex in @xmath52 and replace @xmath5 by @xmath53 for every vertex @xmath54 .",
    "this yields a new list colouring problem in which the total number of colours in all lists is smaller than @xmath36 ( since all the new list are disjoint from b ) .",
    "therefore by the minimality of our original choice , there exist an acceptable colouring of @xmath0 for this new lists colouring instance .",
    "in particular this implies that we can obtain an acceptable colouring of @xmath52 for the original lists @xmath5 . since no colour in @xmath44",
    "is used in this colouring , using the colouring of @xmath48 pointed out by @xmath46 yields an extension of this colouring to a colouring of @xmath0 in which no colour of @xmath44 appears more than once .",
    "this contradicts our assumption that there is no acceptable colouring for this instance and proves the lemma .",
    "* proof of theorem [ maint ] .",
    "* let @xmath2 be a fixed constant and let @xmath0 be a graph satisfying @xmath55 .",
    "we assume that @xmath56 and obtain a contradiction .",
    "since adding an edge between vertices in different colour classes in an optimal colouring of @xmath0 does not change @xmath57 and can only increase @xmath7 , we will assume that @xmath0 is complete @xmath57-partite graph .",
    "thus @xmath0 has a unique partition into @xmath57 stable sets .",
    "we refer to these stable sets as parts rather than colour classes so as to avoid confusion with the colours used in our acceptable colouring of @xmath0 .    now by lemma [ lessn ] , if @xmath58 then there is an instance of list colouring on @xmath0 for which no acceptable colouring exists , in which each list has length at least @xmath57 and such that the size of the union of all lists @xmath5 is less than @xmath34 .",
    "this means that in an acceptable colouring at least one colour must be used on more than one vertex .",
    "fortunately , it also implies that for every non - singleton part @xmath59 there is at least one colour which appears on @xmath5 for more than half the vertices of @xmath59 ( since each @xmath5 contains more than half the colours ) .",
    "our proof approach is simple . for each non - singleton part @xmath59",
    ", we choose some colour @xmath60 and colour with @xmath60 all the vertices of @xmath59 whose list contains @xmath60 ( thus we must insist that all the @xmath60 are distinct ) .",
    "we complete the colouring by finding a bijection between the vertices not yet coloured and the colours not yet used so that each such colour is in the list of the vertex with which it is matched .",
    "this yields an acceptable colouring in which for each part @xmath59 there is at most one colour @xmath60 used on more than one vertex of @xmath59 .    to begin",
    ", we consider the case when there is some part @xmath59 such that some colour appears on all the vertices of @xmath59 .",
    "we show that we can reduce to a smaller problem by using any such colour for @xmath60 .",
    "iteratively repeating this process yields a graph where no such @xmath59 exists and hence , in particular , there are no parts of size two .    our choices for the remaining @xmath60 are discussed in the proof of the key lemma [ bruce ] which consists of the analysis of a probabilistic procedure for choosing the remaining @xmath60 .",
    "unfortunately , before discussing this procedure we need to deal with some technical details .",
    "so , to begin we show that we can assume that @xmath61 is empty for all parts @xmath59 of size bigger than @xmath62 in the partition of @xmath0 . to see this , let @xmath59 be a part of size at least @xmath22 such that @xmath63 .",
    "then the graph @xmath64 has chromatic number @xmath65 and at most @xmath66 vertices and therefore also satisfies @xmath67 note that it also satisfies @xmath68 since otherwise we can obtain an acceptable colouring of @xmath0 from the lists @xmath5 .",
    "indeed , let @xmath40 be a colour in @xmath69 . since @xmath70 , we know there is an acceptable colouring of @xmath64 from the lists @xmath71 . colouring all vertices in @xmath59 with @xmath40 we obtain an extension of this colouring to an acceptable colouring of @xmath0 from the original lists , a contradiction .",
    "therefore we will consider the graph @xmath64 instead of @xmath0 and continue this process until we obtain a graph @xmath72 and an instance of list colouring on @xmath72 with the following properties .",
    "* @xmath72 is @xmath73-partite graph which satisfies @xmath74 .",
    "* each list @xmath75 has length at least @xmath73 and there is no acceptable colouring of @xmath72 from @xmath75 . * the size of the union of all lists is less than @xmath76 .",
    "* @xmath77 is empty for all parts of size bigger than @xmath62 in the partition of @xmath72 .",
    "since the size of the lists is @xmath78 we obtain that @xmath79 is non empty for any two vertices @xmath80 in @xmath72 . in particular",
    "this implies that in the partition of @xmath72 there are no parts of size two .",
    "note that the original graph @xmath0 has at most @xmath81 parts of size @xmath82 and each time we removed such a part the chromatic number of the remaining graph decreased by one .",
    "therefore we decrease chromatic number of @xmath0 by at most @xmath81 and hence the remaining graph @xmath72 should have at least @xmath83 vertices .",
    "so by choosing an appropriate bound on the size of @xmath34 we can make @xmath76 arbitrarily large .",
    "this completes our discussion of parts @xmath59 for which some colour is in @xmath5 for all vertices @xmath6 of @xmath59 .",
    "we turn now to the technical details necessary before we present the rest of the ideas needed in the proof .",
    "let @xmath84 be the set of all the vertices in the singleton classes in the partition of @xmath72 .",
    "pick @xmath85 to be a sufficiently large integer constant @xmath86 and let @xmath30 be an integer which satisfies    @xmath87    since in the partition of @xmath72 there are no parts of size two , we obtain that @xmath88 and that @xmath89 .",
    "set @xmath90 .",
    "let @xmath38 be a bipartite graph with bipartition @xmath91 and an edge between @xmath40 and @xmath6 precisely when @xmath92 .",
    "note that the degree of every vertex from @xmath84 in @xmath38 is at least @xmath93 .",
    "therefore by well known results on zarankiewicz s problem ( see , e.g. , @xcite , problem 10.37 ) , @xmath38 contains a complete bipartite graph with @xmath30 vertices in @xmath84 and @xmath85 vertices in @xmath94 .",
    "denote the set of vertices from @xmath84 and @xmath94 by @xmath95 and @xmath96 respectively and remove them from @xmath38 .",
    "note that the bound on zarankiewicz s problem guarantees that we will continue to find a copy of the complete bipartite graph @xmath97 in @xmath38 until the minimal degree of a vertex in @xmath84 is @xmath98 thus in the end we obtain at least @xmath99 disjoint sets of colours @xmath100 and also @xmath8 disjoint sets of singleton partition classes @xmath101 , such that @xmath102 for every vertex @xmath103 .",
    "denote by @xmath104 , by @xmath105 and let @xmath106 and @xmath107 be the sizes of @xmath108 and @xmath109 respectively . now using ( [ a ] )",
    "we can obtain the following inequalities @xmath110 and @xmath111 in the above discussion and in particular in the last two inequalities we used that @xmath85 and @xmath30 are constants but @xmath76 ( and thus also @xmath73 ) tends to infinity .    let @xmath48 be the union of some set of @xmath112 singleton partition classes which do not belong to @xmath113 .",
    "such a set @xmath48 exists , since the number of singleton partition classes outside @xmath113 is at least @xmath114 .",
    "note that we can obtain an acceptable colouring of @xmath48 with the lists @xmath115 greedily , since the size of @xmath115 is equal to @xmath116 .",
    "let @xmath117 be the set of @xmath116 colours used to colour @xmath48 in one such acceptable colouring .",
    "denote by @xmath118 and let @xmath119 for every vertex @xmath120 .",
    "then to finish the proof it is enough to show the existence of an acceptable colouring of the @xmath121 from the set of lists @xmath122 .    by definition ,",
    "we have that @xmath123 and @xmath121 is a complete @xmath106 partite graph .",
    "the number of vertices of @xmath121 satisfies @xmath124 so by choosing @xmath125 we obtain that @xmath126 .",
    "this together with above discussion implies that @xmath121 satisfies all the condition ( @xmath62@xmath127 ) of the next lemma .",
    "this lemma guarantees the existence of an acceptable colouring of @xmath121 from the set of lists @xmath122 and completes the proof of theorem [ maint ] .",

    "let @xmath0 be a complete @xmath106-partite graph on @xmath130 vertices and let @xmath5 be the set of lists of colours of size @xmath106 one for each vertex @xmath6 of @xmath0 such that the following holds .",
    "1 .   @xmath135 for any part @xmath59 of size bigger than one in the partition of @xmath0 .",

    "we finish this section with discussion of the proof of lemma [ bruce ] .",
    "we postpone all the details to the subsequent sections of the paper .    * proof overview . *",
    "the proof proceeds as follows :    1 .",
    "we choose a random partition of each @xmath142 into two subsets @xmath144 of size @xmath30 and @xmath145 of size @xmath146 where these choices are made uniformly and independently .",
    "we use the colours in @xmath144 to colour the vertices of @xmath147 which is possible by condition 4 of the lemma .",
    "3 .   we choose a ( random ) bijection between @xmath148 and the parts of @xmath0 not in @xmath113 in such a way that , for each part @xmath59 not in @xmath113 , @xmath59 is equally likely to correspond to each colour @xmath149 .",
    "we denote by @xmath60 be the colour corresponding to @xmath59 .",
    "4 .   for each part",
    "@xmath59 not in @xmath150 we colour every vertex @xmath6 of @xmath59 for which @xmath151 with the colour @xmath60 .",
    "we match the set @xmath152 of vertices not yet assigned a colour with the set of colours not yet used ( i.e those colours not in @xmath108 ) so that every vertex is matched with a colour on its list .",
    "we colour each vertex of @xmath152 with the colour with which it is matched .",
    "if we successfully complete this five step process , we have an acceptable colouring as every colour not in @xmath153 appears on at most one vertex , and every colour in @xmath153 appears only on a subset of some part , and hence on an independent set of @xmath0 .    to prove that we can find the colouring in this fashion ,",
    "we need to describe and analyze our method for choosing the random bijection between the parts and the colours in @xmath108 made in steps i  iv , in order to show that ( with positive probability ) we can complete the colouring by finding the desired matching in step v.    a key tool will be hall s theorem which states that in a bipartite graph with bipartition @xmath154 , we can find a matching @xmath46 such that every vertex of @xmath155 is the endpoint of an edge of @xmath46 provided there is no subset @xmath84 of @xmath155 such that setting @xmath156 we have @xmath157 .",
    "we remark that although steps i  iii are presented as though they are separate processes performed sequentially , in the more complicated case of our analysis we will need to interleave these processes by first choosing some of the @xmath145 , then choosing the parts with which these colours will be matched , and finally completing step i and then step iii .    to determine if we can find the desired matching in step v , we will need to examine the sets @xmath158 for the vertices of @xmath152 .",
    "let @xmath38 be a bipartite graph with bipartition @xmath159 and an edge between @xmath40 and @xmath6 precisely when @xmath160 .",
    "for each vertex @xmath6 , we let the weight of @xmath6 , denoted @xmath161 , be @xmath162 .",
    "for any set @xmath107 of vertices we use @xmath163 to denote the sum of the weights of the vertices in @xmath107 .",
    "this definition of weight is motivated by the following immediate consequence of hall s theorem :    [ wobs ] if we can not find the desired matching in step 5 then there exist a subset @xmath84 of @xmath152 such that @xmath164 . in this case @xmath165 as well",
    ".    * proof .",
    "* by hall s theorem there exist a subset @xmath84 of @xmath152 such that @xmath157 .",
    "then , we obtain that @xmath166 will be crucial to the proof of the lemma . in the next section , by computing the expected value of the parameter , we show that the lemma holds if @xmath167 . in later sections",
    ", we complete the proof using a more complicated analysis along the same lines .",
    "-5 mm    for each part @xmath59 which is not in @xmath150 , our choices in steps i and iii guarantee that each colour of @xmath108 is equally likely to be @xmath60 .",
    "thus , for each vertex @xmath6 in such a part , the probability that @xmath6 is in @xmath152 , i.e. , @xmath169 , is @xmath170 . since @xmath171 ,",
    "this is @xmath172 .",
    "so , we have : @xmath173 so , if @xmath174 , then this expected value is less than or equal to one .",
    "since the probability that a random variable exceeds its expected value is less than one , this implies that we can make the choices in steps i ",
    "iv so that @xmath175 , and hence by observation [ wobs ] , the desired matching can be found in step v.    analyzing the behaviour of the ( random ) weights of various subsets of @xmath152 will allow us extend our proof technique to handle larger values of @xmath130 .",
    "in doing so , the following definitions and observations will prove useful .",
    "we let @xmath155 be the number of non - singleton parts . then by condition 3 of the lemma",
    ", @xmath155 is at least @xmath176 .",
    "since each non singleton colour class has at least three vertices and the total number of classes is @xmath106 , we obtain @xmath177 , i.e. , @xmath178 .",
    "on the other hand , the analysis above shows that we can assume that @xmath179 and hence that @xmath180 .",
    "thus , @xmath181 .",
    "both these bounds on @xmath155 will be useful in our analysis .",
    "note also that @xmath182",
    "-5 mm    let @xmath38 be a bipartite graph with bipartition @xmath183 and an edge between @xmath40 and @xmath6 precisely when @xmath160",
    ". our first step will be to check hall s criterion for a fixed subset of colours @xmath184 in @xmath185 and show that the expected number of vertices in @xmath186 is less than @xmath187 .    to begin",

    "therefore , defining the set @xmath189 to be @xmath190 , we have that @xmath191 which , since @xmath192 , is at most @xmath193 . on the other hand , this estimate is not good enough to guarantee hall s criterion , since it still can be greater than @xmath187 .    to improve on this bound , we use the fact that no colour @xmath40 appears on the list of all the vertices of any non - singleton part of @xmath0 . note that @xmath194 , @xmath195 , the number of non - singleton parts is @xmath155 and the total number of vertices is at most @xmath192 .",
    "this altogether implies that for every @xmath40 , @xmath196 applying this fact for the @xmath40 in @xmath184 allows us to improve our bound on @xmath197 .",
    "specifically , we note that summing this bound over all the colours @xmath40 in @xmath184 @xmath198 now , each vertex @xmath6 of @xmath189 contributes @xmath199 to exactly @xmath200 terms in the first sum in this equation , so its total contribution to the sum is 1 .",

    "there are two major difficulties which complicate our approach .",
    "* some of the parts @xmath59 can be very large making it impossible for us to obtain the desired concentration results directly ( e.g. , there could be a part of size exceeding @xmath204 ) . *",
    "if @xmath203 is very small then @xmath199 is large and putting @xmath6 into @xmath152 can have a significant effect on the weight of the various @xmath202 .",
    "this makes proving a concentration result directly impossible .    in order to deal with these problems ,",
    "we proceed as follows :    1 .   we colour the `` big '' parts first , ignoring concentration in our computation and focusing only on the expected weight of the subset of @xmath152 intersecting the big parts .",
    "we note that by considering the expected overall weight and not focusing on a specific @xmath202 , we only lose a factor of @xmath205 per part",
    ". we will define big parts so that there are @xmath206 of them , and hence the total loss will not be significant .",
    "2 .   we treat @xmath6 with @xmath200 small separately using an expected value argument to bound the weight of the vertices in this set .",
    "-5 mm    in this section we will complete the proof of lemma [ bruce ] using the ideas which have already been discussed above .",
    "we choose an integer @xmath207 so that @xmath208 which is possible because @xmath209 ( this holds , since @xmath85 and @xmath210 are fixed but @xmath106 tends to infinity ) and @xmath211 ( in fact it exceeds @xmath212 as we remarked at the end of section [ section 3 ] ) .",
    "we call the largest @xmath213 parts in our partition of @xmath0 _ big _ , and the others _",
    "small_. let @xmath214 be the union of the vertex sets of the big parts .",
    "we will need the following lemma .",
    "[ slem ] every small non - singleton partition class contains at least two @xmath6 which satisfy : @xmath215    * proof . * let @xmath59 be a small non - singleton colour class .",
    "we already mentioned that every colour of @xmath138 is missed by a vertex of @xmath59 so @xmath216 .",
    "now , since there are less than @xmath217 colours in total , every @xmath5 must contain at least @xmath218 colours in @xmath108 and so the largest @xmath158 in @xmath59 has at most @xmath219 elements .",
    "thus , the sum of @xmath200 over the remaining vertices of @xmath59 is at least @xmath218 .    since there are at least @xmath220 big colour classes , the largest small colour class has at most @xmath221 vertices .",
    "so , the second largest @xmath203 has size at least @xmath222 .",
    "this is the desired result .    with this auxiliary result in hand",

    "we proceed as follows : 0.2 cm    * first process : * we randomly choose @xmath207 of the @xmath223 and a partition of each of these into subsets @xmath144 of size @xmath30 and @xmath145 of size @xmath146 where these choices are all made independently and uniformly .",
    "we then choose a uniformly random bijection between the @xmath213 colours in the union of these @xmath145 and the big parts .",
    "0.2 cm    * second process : * we chose a partition of each remaining @xmath142 into @xmath144 and @xmath145 where again these choices are uniform , independent , and independent of all the earlier choices .",
    "we then choose a uniformly random bijection between the colours in these @xmath145 and the small parts .",
    "0.2 cm    denote by @xmath60 the colour which is assigned by the above bijection to the partition class @xmath59 .",
    "use the colours in @xmath224 to colour the vertices of @xmath147 and for each part @xmath59 not in @xmath150 colour every vertex @xmath6 of @xmath59 for which @xmath225 with the colour @xmath60 .",
    "let @xmath152 be a set of vertices not yet assigned a colour .",
    "we set @xmath226 and @xmath227 .",
    "note that @xmath228 is determined by our choices in the first process .",
    "so , using a computation similar to that in ( [ expectation ] ) we obtain @xmath229 furthermore , by the definition of expectation , there exist at least one set of choices for the first process such that @xmath230 .",
    "we condition on any such set of choices which ensures that this inequality holds .",
    "we use @xmath231 and @xmath232 for the conditional probability of an event and conditional expectation of a variable for the second process , given this set of choices .",
    "let @xmath233 be the union of the set of colours in the @xmath142 which were chosen in the first process .",
    "at the end of section 3 we proved that @xmath146 is at least @xmath212 . therefore @xmath234 .",
    "hence , we have that for every @xmath6 in a small part which is not in @xmath150 , @xmath235    clearly , this implies that for every subset @xmath84 of the set of vertices @xmath236 we have @xmath237 in particular , for every colour @xmath40 @xmath238 and also @xmath239 @xmath240    before we proceed with the proof , we need the following lemma .    [ large - deviation ] for every color @xmath40 the probability that @xmath241 @xmath242 is @xmath243 .",
    "* proof . * to prove the lemma we need the following variant of a standard large deviation inequality for martingales . since the proof of this inequality is essentially the same as other proofs which already appeared in the literature ( see , e.g. , section 3 of the survey @xcite )",
    ", we will omit it here .    given a finite set @xmath244 ,",
    "let @xmath245 denotes the set of all @xmath246 permutations or linear orders on this set .",
    "let @xmath247 be a family of independent random variables , where the random variable @xmath248 takes values in a finite set @xmath249 .",
    "thus @xmath250 takes values in the set @xmath251 .",
    "let @xmath252 be a random permutation independent from @xmath250 .",
    "suppose that the non - negative real - valued function @xmath253 satisfies the following two conditions for every @xmath254 .",
    "* for every @xmath255 , changing the value of a coordinate @xmath256 can change the value of @xmath257 by at most @xmath258 .",
    "* swapping any two elements in permutation @xmath259 can change the value of @xmath257 by at most @xmath258 .",
    "denote by @xmath260 the expected value of @xmath261 .",
    "then for every @xmath262 we have that @xmath263    now fix a color @xmath40 and define the function @xmath261 to be @xmath264 where @xmath254 corresponds to the set of random choices for the second process .",
    "more precisely , @xmath265 is a random partition of the set @xmath142 into subsets @xmath144 and @xmath145 and @xmath259 is a random bijection between the colors in these @xmath145 and the small parts of @xmath0 .",
    "since we can fix one canonical ordering of these small parts we can assume that @xmath259 is just a random permutation of the set of colors which is , by definition , independent from the variables @xmath265 .",
    "next , note that changing the outcome of the variable @xmath265 , i.e. , changing one particular @xmath145 can only affect vertices in at most @xmath146 small parts of @xmath0 . as we already mentioned in the proof of lemma [ slem",
    "] , each small part contains at most @xmath266 vertices . since we considering only vertices @xmath6 satisfying @xmath267 , the weight of such a vertex is at most @xmath268 .",
    "therefore , changing outcome of one @xmath265 can change the value of @xmath261 by at most @xmath269 . similarly swapping any two colors in @xmath259",
    "can affect only vertices in two small parts of @xmath0 .",
    "so again this can only change @xmath261 by at most @xmath270 .    since the total number of random variables @xmath265 and also",
    "the length of permutation @xmath259 are bounded by @xmath130 we have that in our case @xmath271 .",
    "therefore it follows form the above large deviation inequality that @xmath272 this completes the proof of the lemma .",
    "@xmath273    now , using the fact that the total number of colors is at most @xmath130 , we deduce from this lemma that with probability @xmath274 the following holds for every color @xmath40 @xmath275 @xmath276 in addition , we also want to satisfy the following inequality : @xmath277 @xmath278 since the probability that this last inequality fails is at most @xmath279 , there does indeed exist a set of random choices for the second process which satisfies simultaneously ( [ concentration ] ) and ( [ small - lists2 ] ) .    fix any such set of choices .",
    "then , combining the inequalities ( [ small - lists1 ] ) and ( [ small - lists2 ] ) together with the facts that @xmath280 and @xmath281 we obtain that @xmath282 @xmath283 note that , by lemma [ slem ] , every small non - singleton partition class contains at least two vertices @xmath6 such that @xmath284 .",
    "since the number of small non - singleton partition classes is at least @xmath285 we obtain that @xmath286 @xmath287 here , in the last inequality we used that @xmath288 and @xmath289 .",
    "note that a similar computation as in ( [ expectation ] ) shows that for any subset @xmath290 the expectation @xmath291 .",
    "in particular , for @xmath292 we obtain @xmath293 combining this inequality with ( [ small - sets ] ) we have @xmath294 this completes our analysis of the weight of vertices with short lists .",
    "we now consider the remaining vertices .",
    "as we already mentioned , for every color @xmath40 and every non - singleton part of @xmath0 there is at least one vertex @xmath6 in this part such that @xmath295 .",
    "since there are at least @xmath285 small non - singleton parts , a similar computations as in ( [ weight - color ] ) shows for every color @xmath40 that @xmath296 @xmath297 combining this inequality with ( [ v-color ] ) and ( [ concentration ] ) and using the fact that @xmath298 we will have that for every color @xmath40 @xmath299 @xmath300    recall that @xmath38 is a bipartite graph with bipartition @xmath159 and an edge between @xmath40 and @xmath6 precisely when @xmath160 .",
    "let @xmath184 be any subset of colours in @xmath185 and denote by @xmath301 .",
    "we complete the proof of the lemma by showing that the graph @xmath38 satisfies hall s condition , i.e. , @xmath302 for every set @xmath189 . then in step v we can match all uncoloured vertices in @xmath152 with the set of colours yet not used and and produce an acceptable coloring of @xmath0 .",
    "first , note that any set @xmath184 of fewer than @xmath303 colours can not be an obstruction to the existence of the desired matching . indeed , if @xmath304 , then by observation [ wobs ] we have that @xmath305 . on the other hand , for every vertex",
    "@xmath306 the size of @xmath203 is at most @xmath307 .",
    "therefore we obtain a contradiction , since by ( [ small - sets1 ] ) @xmath308 turning to larger @xmath184 , we note next that the inequality ( [ small - sets1 ] ) yields : @xmath309 @xmath310 next , observe that the set of inequalities ( [ all - colors ] ) imply that for any set of colours @xmath184 @xmath311 this , together with the inequality ( [ small - sets2 ] ) yields that any set of colours @xmath184 of size at least @xmath312 satisfies @xmath313 thus we obtain that these larger @xmath184 also do not violate hall s condition and hence the desired matching of step v does indeed exist .",
    "this completes the proof .",
    "-5 mm    in this paper we proved that for every @xmath314 and for every sufficiently large graph @xmath0 of order @xmath130 , the list chromatic number of @xmath0 equals its chromatic number , provided @xmath315 .",
    "a more careful analysys of our methods yields that the value of @xmath316 in this result can be made as small as @xmath317 for any constant @xmath318 .",
    "nevertheless the conjecture of ohba remains open for graphs with @xmath319 vertices and it seems one needs new ideas to tackle this problem . even to show that there is a constant @xmath320 such that @xmath321 for every graph @xmath0 with at most @xmath322 vertices , would be very interesting .    in conclusion we would like to propose a related problem , which was motivated by ohba s conjecture .",
