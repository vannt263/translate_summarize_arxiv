    "according to the impact parameter , @xmath4 , different phenomena take place in collisions of ultrarelativistic heavy ions .",
    "they can be divided into the following three categories .",
    "central collisions @xmath5 , i.e. the collisions with nearly full nuclear overlap fall into the first category .",
    "such collisions provide conditions for the creation of very hot and dense nuclear matter .",
    "it is the aim of future experimental programs at large hadron collider ( lhc ) at cern  @xcite and relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) at brookhaven national laboratory  @xcite to study a possible phase transition of nuclear and hadronic matter into the so - called quark - gluon plasma at high energy densities .",
    "as it is expected , the quark - gluon plasma can be created under such extreme conditions which are similar to those existed in the early universe soon after the big bang .",
    "the second category contains collisions with partial overlap of nuclei ( @xmath6 , @xmath7 and @xmath8 are the nuclear radii ) . in such collisions",
    "the residual spectators remain relatively cold .",
    "short - range interaction via strong nuclear forces is restricted mainly to the participant zone . in the whole set of minimum - bias events",
    "the number of peripheral nuclear collisions is significant due to the geometrical factor @xmath9 .",
    "the general picture of ultrarelativistic heavy - ion collisions at lhc and rhic will be incomplete without considering such peripheral collisions .",
    "non - central heavy - ion collisions are considered as a place to look for the disoriented chiral condensates  @xcite and elliptic flow  @xcite .",
    "combining hanbury - brown - twiss method with a determination of the reaction plane  @xcite one is able to study the size , deformation and opacities of the particle emission sources . with the aim to study the central collisions",
    ", one has to know the exact properties of complementary peripheral collisions .",
    "a proper rejection of these `` background '' collision events will be crucial in the extraction of events in which the quark - gluon plasma may be created .    in the collisions of the third category the impact parameter exceeds the sum of nuclear radii ( @xmath10 ) .",
    "therefore , there is no overlap of nuclear densities , but nevertheless , one or both nuclei may be disintegrated by the long - range electromagnetic forces .",
    "this process of electromagnetic dissociation ( ed ) is a well - known phenomenon  @xcite .",
    "the interaction can be treated in terms of equivalent photons representing the lorentz - boosted coulomb field of heavy ions . at ultrarelativistic energies the ed cross section exceeds considerably the pure nuclear cross section for heavy colliding nuclei .",
    "this fact was confirmed recently in experiments  @xcite .",
    "the electromagnetic collision events are less violent then the collisions with nuclear interactions .",
    "thus the average particle multiplicities are essentially lower  @xcite and the main part of nucleons and mesons is produced in the regions of projectile and target fragmentation , very far from the mid - rapidity region .",
    "besides the action of virtual ( equivalent ) photons on colliding nuclei , the photons from two nuclei can collide ( fuse ) and produce various secondary particles .",
    "photon - photon ( @xmath0 ) physics may be investigated in such collisions  @xcite .",
    "the idea to produce exotic particles via @xmath0 fusion in heavy - ion colliders has been put forward more then 10 years ago in ref .",
    "many authors have further developed this idea since that time .",
    "the production of different particles from @xmath11 , @xmath12 leptons to higgs bosons and supersymmetric particles has been considered .",
    "the full list of references can be found in the recent reviews  @xcite .",
    "as one can see , there exist several mechanisms of particle production in peripheral collisions of ultrarelativistic heavy ions : @xmath0 fusion , @xmath1 interaction and grazing nuclear collisions ( see figs .",
    "[ nnproc1][nnproc3 ] ) . in the present paper",
    "we study the production of @xmath13 and @xmath14 mesons via these mechanisms .",
    "we discuss the general features of pion production and calculate the contributions of different mechanisms . prior to investigating exotic particle production in @xmath0 collisions",
    "a certain `` calibration '' is necessary for the theoretical methods and experimental techniques .",
    "similar investigations have been performed specially for star detector at rhic  @xcite and corresponding acceptance cuts were applied from the beginning . the cms detector which will be installed at lhc  @xcite",
    "can also be used for studying the meson production in peripheral collisions . even having in mind a plan to use another experimental set - up for",
    "such studies one can estimate first @xmath0 signal to background ratio without any acceptance cuts .",
    "such comparison of different mechanisms provides a guide - line which is free of limitations and restrictions of existing experimental facilities .",
    "this is useful for possible extensions and updates of existing detectors .    in the present paper",
    "we pay the main attention to the inclusive cross sections of meson production by different mechanisms .",
    "this study is complementary to a very recent one  @xcite , which deals with the exclusive meson production channels .",
    "as we expect , in order to select the rare events with the single produced vector meson  @xcite , one has to reject the background due to meson production ( @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath14 ) via @xmath1 process .",
    "this background may be estimated in the framework of the models used in the present paper .",
    "a meson production event may be followed by a partial disintegration of a nucleus , i.e. a branchy process may take place .",
    "we study such reactions in addition to the coherent meson production process considered in ref .",
    "@xcite when the colliding nuclei remain intact .",
    "different characteristics of pion production by the equivalent photons are calculated by the reldis code  @xcite based on the extended model of photonuclear reactions  @xcite .",
    "the fritiof monte carlo event generator , version 7.1  @xcite is used to study the properties of grazing nuclear collisions .",

    "different nuclear charge formfactors may be used in calculations  @xcite , but in any approximation the @xmath3 values for a produced meson turns out to be less then 30 mev / c in @xmath38 collisions . in the following we shell see how this feature may be used to disentangle @xmath0 events from other processes .",
    "the production of a single meson in the @xmath0 fusion is the simplest process in our consideration .",
    "the calculation technique within the framework of the weizscker - williams formalism for such a process is well - known  @xcite .",

    "is changed by several percent only",
    ". this simplification may be not appropriate for heavy mesons , since they can only be produced by a pair of photons from the high - energy tail of the equivalent photon spectrum .",
    "such mesons are produced mainly in close collisions , where @xmath45 and the region of nuclear overlap can not be neglected .",
    "the cross section of elementary process @xmath46 may be calculated  @xcite as : @xmath47 where @xmath48 , @xmath39 and @xmath49 are the spin , mass and two - photon decay width of the meson @xmath50 , @xmath51 is the c.m .",
    "energy squared of the colliding photons .",
    "the corresponding differential cross section for producing a meson with mass @xmath39 is given by @xmath52    the exclusive cross sections for producing a singe meson were calculated by many authors . in ref .",
    "@xcite the equivalent photon cross section has been derived directly from the first qed principles .",
    "three types of nuclear formfactors were used in the calculations  @xcite corresponding to a homogeneously charged sphere , a gaussian - shaped and a point - like charge distributions . in this respect the approach of ref .",
    "@xcite is different from the more phenomenological method of ref .",
    "@xcite which we basically follow .",
    "moreover , even following the authors of ref .  @xcite one can use different values for the nuclear radii , @xmath53 .",
    "the real nuclear charge distribution with a diffuse boundary should be approximated by a distribution with a sharp boundary that leads to some uncertainties .",
    "a straightforward comparison of the results of different authors  @xcite seems to be difficult due to different values of @xmath39 , @xmath54 and @xmath53 used in the different papers .    with the aim to understand the sensitivity of numerical results to the choice of parameters we repeated the calculation of the cross sections for single meson production in ultrarelativistic heavy - ion collisions ,",

    "we used @xmath39 and @xmath49 values according to the corresponding papers  @xcite .",
    "all the cross sections were calculated for the nuclear radii @xmath55 .",
    "as one can see from tabs .",
    "[ tab2][tab4 ] , the different approaches give quite similar results for the lightest mesons @xmath14 , @xmath56 . on the contrary , as it was expected ,",
    "the difference is noticeable for heavy mesons like @xmath57 , @xmath58 .",
    "nevertheless this situation seems to be acceptable due to the following reasons .",
    "first , in the present paper we will consider mainly the production of the lightest @xmath59 mesons .",
    "second , because of uncertainties in particle properties data on @xmath39 and @xmath60 for heavy mesons  @xcite it is difficult to predict with confidence the exclusive cross section values for such mesons .",
    "therefore , the uncertainties of the method itself become less important for heavy mesons .",
    "pions can be produced not only in the direct process @xmath61 .",
    "the @xmath62 fusion produces several unstable heavy mesons such as @xmath63 , ... and decay products of these mesons may contain @xmath14 s . as one can see in the following , such two - step processes , @xmath64 , with the intermediate meson @xmath50 give a sizable contribution to the inclusive @xmath14 production cross section .",
    "in addition to the direct process a reasonable estimation for the inclusive cross section @xmath65 should contain the sum of dominant contributions from the intermediate meson resonances which contain at least one @xmath14 meson in the final state .",
    "we call this approach a dominant resonance production ( drp ) model .    the exclusive differential cross section @xmath66 to produce a single meson @xmath50 with mass @xmath39 is given by eq .",
    "( [ difoneres ] ) . in the drp approximation",
    "the inclusive cross section of the @xmath14 production through the decay of intermediate resonances is @xmath67 where @xmath68 is the branching ratio for decay of the resonance @xmath50 to the channel @xmath69 which contains at least one @xmath14 .",
    "@xmath70 is the number of @xmath14 s in the corresponding channel @xmath69 .",

    "the corresponding rapidity distributions , @xmath84 , will be discussed in sec .  [ rapid ] .",
    "the meson production induced by equivalent photons in electromagnetic collisions of ultrarelativistic heavy ions ( fig .  [ nnproc2 ] ) is a poorly explored phenomenon . to the best of our knowledge",
    ", the first calculations of the total rate of pion production in electromagnetic collisions were made in ref .",
    "the first experimental evidence of electromagnetic dissociation accompanied by the pion production was found in ref .",
    "@xcite for 200 agev @xmath85 ions . due to a small number of pion production events detected in nuclear emulsion",
    ", the absolute cross section for such dissociation channel was not determined .",
    "to date only the existence of pion production in @xmath1 collisions is demonstrated by the experiment  @xcite .",
    "let us consider the absorption by a nucleus of an equivalent photon leading to the pion production ( fig .",
    "[ nnproc2 ] ) .",
    "the nucleus may absorb one or more virtual photons during a collision .",
    "we follow llope and braun - munzinger  @xcite in description of such multiple absorption processes .",
    "the double differential cross section of the pion production via the single photon absorption may be written first in the projectile rest frame .",
    "in such a frame the nucleus is at rest prior to absorption : @xmath86 where @xmath87 is the total photoabsorption cross section for the nucleus @xmath88 and @xmath89 is the double differential distribution of pions produced by a photon with energy @xmath25 .",
    "spectral function @xmath90 is given by the following expression : @xmath91 where @xmath92 is defined by eq .",
    "( [ aspectr ] ) and @xmath93 is the mean number of photons absorbed by the nucleus @xmath88 in a collision at impact parameter @xmath4 : @xmath94 analogously , for the second order process with a pair of photons absorbed by the nucleus @xmath88 the double differential cross section is : @xmath95 with the corresponding double photon spectral function : @xmath96    in the above expressions @xmath97 is the minimal value of the impact parameter which corresponds to the onset of nuclear interaction . in pion production calculations the integration over the photon energy starts from @xmath98 mev which corresponds to the pion emission threshold .",
    "finally , with the corresponding lorentz boost from the nucleus rest frame to the laboratory system one can obtain the double differential distribution @xmath99 for produced pions suitable for measurements in experiments .",
    "further details of our approach may be found in refs .",
    "@xcite .    as it was shown in ref .",
    "@xcite , the contribution to pion production from the double photon absorption is less then 10% for heavy ions with @xmath100 .",
    "since the contribution from the third and fourth order processes are expected to be even lower , these processes can be safely disregarded for the ultrarelativistic energies .    because of the coherent action of all the charges in the nucleus , the virtuality of the emitted photon , @xmath101 , is restricted .",
    "such photons are almost real , @xmath102 , where @xmath50 is the nuclear radius .",
    "therefore , photonuclear data obtained in experiments with monoenergetic photons may be used , in principle , as an input for weizscker - williams calculations of pion production in @xmath1 collisions .",
    "since the spectrum of equivalent photons covers a very wide range of the photon energies , one needs the double differential distribution @xmath103 for photon energies @xmath104 starting from the pion emission threshold and up to several tens or even hundreds of gev .    in the region of interest , i.e. at @xmath105 mev , the photon de broglie wavelength is comparable or even smaller than the nucleon radius .",
    "a photon interacts , mainly , with individual intranuclear nucleons .",
    "experimental data on single pion photoproduction on the nucleon are accumulated in compilations of refs .",
    "the latter compilation contains also the experimental data on photoproduction of baryon , @xmath106 , and meson @xmath107 resonances : @xmath108 and @xmath109 as well as on some channels of multiple pion production : @xmath110 , @xmath111 . due to a long mean free path",
    "an equivalent photon may be absorbed deeply in the nuclear interior .",
    "the mesons produced in a photonucleon reaction interact with other intranuclear nucleons inducing different reactions in the nuclear medium .",
    "in other words , the process shown in fig .  [ nnproc2 ] is followed by the final state interaction of produced hadrons with the residual nucleus @xmath88 . beside the pions",
    "several nucleons may be emitted and the residual nucleus may receive a high excitation energy .",
    "since the data on pion photoproduction on nuclei exist only for limited domains of @xmath104 and pion kinematical variables , a theoretical model should be used in the cases when the data are not available .",
    "a suitable tool for describing such multi - step photonuclear reactions is the intranuclear cascade model , which is well - known for many years  @xcite .    as shown in ref .",
    "@xcite , the extended intranuclear cascade model of photonuclear reactions describes reasonably well available data on meson production and nucleon emission obtained in last two decades with intermediate energy quasi - monochromatic photons . with this in mind",
    "one can use the inc model for the weizscker - williams calculations , as it was demonstrated in refs .",
    "formally we use 1 tev as the upper limit for the equivalent photon energy in the @xmath1 process .",
    "our model was not initially designed for such high energies when events with a very high hadron multiplicity become possible and many other channels , like baryon - antibaryon photoproduction , may be open . nonetheless one can safely use the model to investigate the @xmath1 processes with low multiplicity which mimic processes from @xmath0 fusion .",
    "the former processes take place mainly at @xmath112 gev , where our model has been verified in detail .",
    "the channels of the hadron photoproduction on a nucleon which are taken into account in the model are listed in tab .",
    "[ gat1 ] . to describe the two - body photoproduction channels we have basically used the monte carlo event generator of corvisiero et al .",
    "the contribution from the two - body channel @xmath114 dominates up to @xmath115 gev .",
    "approximations of the total and differential cross sections for such channels based on the model of walker and metcalf  @xcite were used up to 2 gev .",
    "the excitation of six baryon resonances was taken into account .",
    "the contributions from @xmath116 , @xmath117 and @xmath118 are the most important .",
    "the presence of these resonances explains a well - known resonant structure in the total @xmath113 cross section at @xmath119 gev .    the channels @xmath120 and @xmath121 play a major role at @xmath122 gev .",
    "these channels include also the resonant contributions from @xmath123 , @xmath124 , @xmath125 and @xmath126 channels ( tab .",
    "[ gat1 ] ) .",
    "although the presence of these contributions in the total @xmath113 cross sections is difficult to trace , the angular distributions of these channels have some specific features .",
    "several examples may be given .",
    "the @xmath127 channel has three important contributions from @xmath128 , @xmath129 and @xmath130 states . due to the dominance of @xmath128 the angular distribution of the process",
    "is not far from isotropy .",
    "on the contrary , @xmath131 process has a prominent forward peak , since the non - resonant diffractive contribution dominates .",
    "many channels in the multi - pion reactions , @xmath110 , ( @xmath111 ) , were not suitable for measurements in spark , bubble or streamer chamber experiments due to the presence of several neutral particles in the final state .",
    "however , one can reconstruct the integral cross sections of undetectable channels by applying isotopic relations to the measured cross sections of channels with charged particles which can be found in compilation of ref .",
    "a phenomenological statistical approach for the exclusive description of the elementary @xmath113 interaction was applied to multiple pion production channels in ref .",
    "there an isospin statistical model was used to connect unknown cross sections with measured ones .",
    "other details of the method used for simulating the @xmath113 interaction may be found elsewhere , see ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "since a huge number of multiple pion production channels is open at @xmath132 gev , the statistical description may be the only way to estimate the cross sections of such channels .",
    "recently another kind of statistical assumptions was used in monte carlo event generator sophia for simulating photohadronic processes in astrophysics  @xcite .      according to our model the fast hadrons produced in a primary @xmath113 interaction",
    "initiate a cascade of successive quasi - free hadron - nucleon collisions inside the nucleus .",
    "the following elementary processes were taken into account : @xmath133 @xmath134 @xmath135 @xmath136 the empirical approximations for the measured integral and differential cross sections of @xmath137 and @xmath138 interactions as well as the phenomenological estimations for the total and partial cross sections of @xmath124 and @xmath126 interactions were used in the calculation  @xcite .",
    "the described monte carlo model is implemented into the reldis code  @xcite which is especially designed for calculating the electromagnetic dissociation processes in ultrarelativistic heavy ion collisions .",
    "the average number of pions , @xmath139 , produced in a @xmath1 process is quite small .",
    "the values of @xmath140 for each pion charge are given in tab .",
    "[ gat2 ] for auau and pbpb collisions at rhic and lhc energies , respectively .",
    "even with the inclusion of multiple pion production channels ( @xmath110 , @xmath111 ) , the average numbers of pions of each charge are quite low ( @xmath141 ) .",
    "this can be explained by two reasons .",
    "first , in a great part of the electromagnetic dissociation events no pions are produced at all , due to the dominance of soft photons ( @xmath142 mev ) in the equivalent photon spectrum , eqs .",
    "( [ ga2]),([ga5 ] ) .",
    "second , the most probable processes of pion production are @xmath114 and @xmath143 , which produce one or two pions only .",
    "as one can see from tab .",
    "[ gat2 ] , in the @xmath1 process the neutral pions are produced more abundantly as compared with @xmath15 and @xmath16 mesons .",
    "a difference is noticeable also in the differential distributions , @xmath84 , shown in fig .",
    "[ gaf1 ] for each pion charge .",
    "the main deviations in the pion yields appear at rapidities close to the beam rapidity .",
    "this fact has a simple explanation .",
    "as already mentioned above , the process @xmath114 dominates in the pion production by equivalent photons and corresponding pions are close to the beam rapidity .",
    "this reaction can proceed on a proton : @xmath144 , @xmath145 and a neutron : @xmath146 , @xmath147 .",
    "thus , single neutral pions can be produced both on the proton and the neutron , while @xmath15 on the neutron and @xmath16 on the proton only .",
    "the total cross sections of these four channels are close to each other .",
    "this gives the rate of @xmath14 production approximately twice as large as the rate of @xmath15 or @xmath16 for a light nucleus with the equal numbers of protons and neutrons .",
    "this feature of the single pion photoproduction is confirmed by the measurements of inclusive cross sections and the calculations made for carbon nucleus ( see fig .",
    "15 of ref .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "since a neutron excess exists in heavy nuclei like pb or au , in this case the @xmath16 production will be enhanced compared to @xmath15 , as it is shown in fig .",
    "the final state interaction affects the absolute yields of pions of different charges , but does not essentially change the ratio between them .",
    "the detection of pions produced close to the beam rapidity is a complicated experimental task .",
    "special zero - degree detectors with a proper identification of particle mass and charge are necessary for this purpose .",
    "however if a forward detector located after a steering magnet is suitable for determination of charges of nuclear fragments , one may exploit it to detect the pion emission process indirectly . if @xmath16 is produced in the reaction @xmath146 , it may be emitted while the recoil proton may be captured by the residual nucleus .",
    "the deexcitation of such nucleus may take place mainly via neutron emission .",
    "it means that the initial charge of the nucleus will be increased by one unit .",
    "charge - to - mass ratio will be changed for such ion and it will be separated from the beam . depending on the value of heavy - ion energy reldis code predicts the cross section of such electromagnetic `` charge pick - up '' channels at the level of 10100 mb .",
    "this process competes with the nucleon pick - up process via strong interaction .",
    "nevertheless as it is known from ref .",
    "@xcite , the cross section of the latter process drops noticeably with increasing beam energy . on the contrary",
    ", the cross section of electromagnetic charge pick - up increases gradually with the beam energy and may essentially exceed the value of cross section for the nucleon pick - up due to the strong interaction .    the photonuclear reactions @xmath148",
    ", @xmath149 induced by bremsstrahlung photons were discovered many years ago .",
    "we refer the reader to a recent paper where such reactions were studied by radiochemical methods  @xcite",
    ". it would be interesting to study the same type of reactions induced by equivalent photons in ultrarelativistic heavy ion collisions .",
    "as mentioned above , the main part of pions is produced close to the beam rapidity .",
    "a small fraction of pions is produced by a very - high energy photons with @xmath150 gev .",
    "some of the pions produced in such interactions may receive the momentum high enough to populate the central rapidity region . as shown in fig .",
    "[ gaf1 ] , there are pions with @xmath151 which may be confused with those from @xmath0 process .",
    "therefore some selection criteria are necessary for @xmath0 processes ( see sec .  [ rapid ] ) .",
    "very peripheral ( grazing ) nuclear collisions with the participation of strong nuclear forces can be misidentified as the electromagnetic interaction events . both of these types of interactions contribute to the events with low multiplicity of particles . to study the properties of strong interaction events a monte carlo event generator fritiof , version 7.1  @xcite",
    "is used .",
    "let us recall the main statements of the extended fritiof model  @xcite which is valid up to the tev region .",
    "fritiof is a monte carlo model for hadron - hadron , hadron - nucleus and nucleus - nucleus collisions .",
    "the basic idea of the model is in a simple picture that a hadron behaves like a relativistic string with a confined color field .",
    "this field is equivalent to that of a chain of dipoles lined up along the axis line .",
    "the dipole links act as partons . during the soft interaction many small transverse momenta",
    "are exchanged between the dipole links and two longitudinally excited string states result from the collisions .",
    "a disturbance of the color field will in general initialise the gluonic radiation according to qcd .",
    "the final state particles are obtained by fragmentating the string states like in the @xmath152 annihilation .",
    "the large @xmath3 process can be treated by using qcd directly .",
    "the hard interaction effects , which are considered as the rutherford parton scattering , become important in the tev range of c.m .",
    "energies and at large @xmath153 gev / c .",
    "the results of the model are in good agreement with experimental hadron - hadron data up to the highest energies currently available .",
    "nucleus - nucleus collisions are regarded in the fritiof model as incoherent collisions between nucleons of colliding nuclei .",
    "fritiof does not take into account collective ( coherence ) effects when two nuclei interact as a whole .",
    "thus a nucleon from the projectile interacts independently with the encountered target nucleons as it passes through the nucleus .",
    "each of these subcollisions can be treated as a usual hadron - hadron collision . on the time scale of the collision process ,",
    "the exited nucleon does not fragment inside the nucleus , so there are no intranuclear cascades .",
    "this assumption is reasonable at high energy since the time scale associated with fragmentation is much longer than the flight time of excited nucleons through the nucleus .",
    "one of important aspects of the collision is the nuclear geometry .",
    "it is assumed that the projectile passes through the target nucleus on a straight line trajectory .",
    "the nucleons are distributed inside the nucleus according to the nuclear density distribution @xmath154 .",
    "wood - saxon density function for heavy nuclei was used in our calculations : @xmath155 where @xmath156 is the radial scale parameter , @xmath157 is the diffuseness parameter , it is slightly @xmath158-dependent and its values used in the program ranging from 0.47 to 0.55  fm , and @xmath159 is a normalisation constant",
    ". then for lead nucleus the radius defined at the half of the normal nuclear density is equal to @xmath160  fm , while the diffuseness parameter used by fritiof is equal to @xmath161  fm .",
    "the total cross section of strong lead - lead interaction at lhc collider was estimated to be 7164 mb , according to a simple geometrical formula used in ref .",
    "this estimation does not take into account the energy dependence of the total nucleus - nucleus cross section due to the increase of the total nucleon - nucleon cross section .",
    "basing on extrapolations of the measured @xmath162 cross sections to lhc energies one can obtain a higher value of about  10 barn , see ref .  @xcite . for this value of the total nucleus - nucleus cross section one has to rescale the plots given in the present paper by  30% for grazing nuclear collisions .",
    "special efforts should be undertaken to find proper ranges of the impact parameter @xmath4 which divide nucleus - nucleus collisions into different categories .",
    "these categories were listed in the introduction , most important for us are very peripheral nuclear collisions and electromagnetic interactions , subsequently subdivided into @xmath0 and @xmath1 events .",
    "the uncertainties associated with the diffuseness of the nuclear density distribution affect grately the resulting ranges .",
    "we used the fritiof model to define these ranges .",
    "the impact parameter distribution of events simulated by the fritiof code is given in fig .",
    "[ impact0 ] .",
    "the plotted quantity @xmath163 is a relative number of nuclear collisions with given @xmath4 .",
    "as it is shown in the figure , the events with a low multiplicity of pions correspond to collisions with @xmath164  fm .",
    "it is the domain of @xmath4 which defines the grazing nuclear collisions with participation of strong nuclear forces .",
    "it should be stressed however , that this definition is essentially model dependent and numerical results may be different if one uses another code with different treatment of the diffuse boundary of the nucleus and another values of the elementary @xmath137 cross sections .",
    "we see that the value which defines the onset of electromagnetic collision for pbpb ions , @xmath165  fm , used in the paper  @xcite does not contradict the results of the fritiof calculations given in fig .",
    "[ impact0 ] .",
    "following our previous papers  @xcite , for consistency we define the end of nuclear overlap in lead - lead collisions at @xmath166 fm .",
    "this choice is also supported by the calculation of ref .",
    "@xcite where the average number of interacting nucleons , @xmath167 , was evaluated as a function of @xmath4 for the case of @xmath168 collisions . as it was found  @xcite , @xmath169 at @xmath170 fm .",
    "according to the wood saxon density function for @xmath171 nucleus it corresponds to the overlap of those boundary regions of the colliding nuclei which have the nuclear densities below 0.1 of the value at the center of the nucleus .",
    "the total number of such events in the fritiof simulation turns out to be 24% .",
    "[ n_n_tot ] demonstrates the distribution of pion multiplicities for peripheral pbpb collisions ( @xmath172  fm ) at lhc energies simulated by the fritiof code .",
    "the most probable is the production of four pions and the distribution is very broad .",
    "this conclusion is valid for all the charge states of pions .",
    "the average pion multiplicities are given in tab .",
    "[ gat2 ] , where one can see that the multiplicities of pions produced in the above - defined grazing @xmath2 collisions are generally greater than those for @xmath1 process .",
    "since most of the detectors used thus far in heavy - ion experiments have very restricted acceptance on rapidity , it is important to investigate the rapidity dependence of pion production cross section .",
    "rapidity distributions of neutral pions produced in peripheral pbpb collisions at lhc energies are shown in fig .",
    "[ incl0 ] .",
    "let us consider first the distributions without any additional selection criteria .",
    "the distributions from @xmath0 fusion and grazing nuclear collisions calculated by the fritiof code with @xmath173 fm are very similar in shape .",
    "the distributions of @xmath84 for single and inclusive @xmath14 production in @xmath0 fusion also have maximuma at @xmath174 .",
    "but even in this region it is much lower then the contribution from grazing nuclear collisions . on the contrary",
    ", the rapidity distribution for @xmath1 production has peaks at the beam and target rapidities .",
    "nevertheless its contribution at midrapidity is comparable to the one from @xmath0 fusion .",
    "this above - described picture is unfavourable for experimental detection of pions from @xmath0 collisions .",
    "nonetheless one can improve the detection conditions by using appropriate transverse momentum cuts .",
    "indeed the single mesons from @xmath0 fusion have a very small transverse momenta .",
    "selecting events with low values of @xmath3 one can reject contributions from other processes . following this way two different @xmath3cut procedures may be proposed .    according to the first procedure ( b - criterion ) one should select the events with a small total transverse momentum of the meson system @xmath175  mev / c .",
    "the second selection procedure ( c - criterion ) imposes more severe restrictions on the transverse momenta of the produced pions demanding each of them ( including @xmath14 , @xmath15 , and @xmath16 ) to be small , @xmath176 mev / c , in this case . as one can see , b - criterion is equivalent to c - criterion in the case of single pion production .",
    "let us investigate now to what extent the rapidity distributions are affected by @xmath3 cuts .",
    "the distributions obtained according to b- and c - criteria are also given in fig .",
    "[ incl0 ] .",
    "one can see that the b - criterion reduces the contribution from grazing nuclear collisions by three orders of magnitude and give some benefits for detection of @xmath0 events . if this reduction is not sufficient one can use c - criterion which is more efficient .",
    "further suppression of pions from grazing nuclear collisions may be obtained in the region @xmath177 . with this suppression even exclusive @xmath61 channel",
    "may be clearly distinguished .",
    "the difference in b- and c - criteria applied to @xmath1 events calculated by reldis code is less prominent .",
    "this is explained by the fact that single pion production dominates in @xmath1 collisions at @xmath105 mev while b- and c - criteria are equivalent for this case .",
    "both of the procedures may be recommended to reduce the contribution from @xmath1 process as it is shown in fig .",
    "[ incl0 ] .",
    "it should be noticed that b - criterion does not affect the inclusive distribution for @xmath0 fusion , while c - criterion suppresses the main part of events of @xmath14 production due to heavy meson decays .",
    "this may be useful for extraction of the exclusive @xmath61 process .",
    "only several hadrons are produced on average in very peripheral collisions of ultrarelativistic heavy ions .",
    "because of this feature such collisions can be considered as non - violent events .",
    "an exact determination of the impact parameter in a collision event is beyond present experimental techniques .",
    "however , as it is shown in the present paper , selecting the events with very low multiplicity of produced mesons one can approximately identify a domain of large impact parameters where @xmath0 fusion , @xmath1 or grazing nuclear @xmath2 collisions takes place .",
    "calculations show that each of the mechanisms has specific distribution of produced pions on transverse momentum , @xmath3 , and rapidity , @xmath178 .",
    "one can use these features for adjusting detectors to different regions of @xmath3 and @xmath178 with possibility to disentangle pions produced by different mechanisms .",
    "one can enhance the signal to background ratio for @xmath0 fusion by selecting events with low @xmath3 by means of two procedures considered in the paper .",
    "our preliminary results confirm the importance of @xmath3 cut proposed in ref .",
    "this procedure rejects the background from @xmath1 and grazing @xmath2 collisions by several orders of magnitude . moreover using @xmath3 cuts",
    "one can avoid a pessimistic conclusion made in ref .",
