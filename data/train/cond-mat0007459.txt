    "the microstructure of porous media determines their macroscopic physical properties @xcite such as conductivity , elastic constants , relaxation times , permeabilities or thermal properties .",
    "the relation between geometric microstructure and physical properties is a fundamental open problem whose solution is important to many applications ranging from geophysics to polymer physics and material science . for geometric modeling of porous media",
    "it is therefore important to characterize microstructures quantitatively and to construct models using given geometric characteristics .",
    "the reconstruction of random media with given stochastic properties is also of great interest for a variety of other reasons .",
    "( i ) digitized 3d geometries of real sandstones are difficult to obtain . therefore , the reconstruction provides a method for easily generating detailed geometries as needed e.g. in numerical calculations of macroscopic material parameters like those mentioned above .",
    "( ii ) the reconstruction of 3d samples from 2d data .",
    "( iii ) any calculation of macroscopic quantities of random media needs a set of stochastic functions which describes the geometry .",
    "the reconstruction can help to decide which functions one should use .",
    "the present work will focus mainly on the latter question , the so - called inverse problem .    recently , a simulated annealing algorithm for the reconstruction of random porous media with predefined stochastic functions was proposed @xcite .",
    "this method was used for the reconstruction of two - phase porous media , i.e. sandstones , with given two - point probability function and lineal - path function , which were measured from real sandstones @xcite . in the present article",
    ", we will continue this work .",
    "an advantage of the simulated annealing is that it allows the reconstruction of a variety of different stochastic functions , with the available cpu time being the only limit on the use of a set of functions . in refs .",
    "@xcite , the two - point probability function and the lineal path function were used . here",
    "we will extend the investigations to the reconstruction of the so called `` pore size '' distribution @xcite , which is not the usual quantity obtained from mercury porosimetry .",
    "we will study a berea sandstone and a fontainebleau sandstone .",
    "a comparison of the reconstructions with the original sandstones shows to which extent the characteristics of the original geometry are reconstructed .",
    "a salient feature of the original sandstone is the high degree of connectivity of the pore space .",
    "hence , one important criterion for judging a stochastic reconstruction method is its ability to reproduce the connectivity of the original sandstone .",
    "it is shown that berea reconstruction does a better job of capturing connectivity than does the fontainebleau reconstruction , although neither captures connectivity particularly well .",
    "another important criterion is the ability of the reconstruction procedure to reproduce the macroscopic properties of the original materials .",
    "we show that the mean survival times of our reconstructions of both sandstones agree well with mean survival times of the original sandstones .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii we describe the reconstruction algorithm . in section iii",
    "we introduce the quantities we use in the reconstruction process and for characterizing the sandstones .",
    "because detailed discussions can be found in the references , we will focus mainly on practical aspects and details of the implementation . in section",
    "iv we present the results for reconstructions of a berea and a fontainebleau sandstone , respectively .",
    "a two - phase porous medium consists of a pore or void phase @xmath0 and a matrix or rock phase @xmath1 .",
    "its microgeometry is described in detail by the characteristic function @xmath2 for a discretized sample @xmath3 is the position vector of a cubic grid with @xmath4 , lattice constant @xmath5 and size @xmath6 .",
    "the total number of grid points is given by @xmath7 . in the following",
    "we will refer to a grid point also as a voxel .",
    "the porosity @xmath8 , the probability of finding a point in pore space , is given by @xmath9 with the assumption of a homogeneous , stationary , and ergodic stochastic porous medium the angular brackets denote a volume average .",
    "the reconstruction is carried out by means of a simulated annealing method @xcite with target or `` energy''-function defined as @xmath10 the function @xmath11 is the stochastic function to be reconstructed , whereas @xmath12 is the actual value of this function measured at iteration step @xmath13 .",
    "for the reconstruction of more than one function the energy @xmath14 at the iteration step @xmath13 is given by @xmath15 where the index @xmath16 numbers the different functions to be reconstructed .",
    "starting from a random configuration with porosity @xmath8 two voxels of different phase are exchanged at each iteration step .",
    "thus , the porosity @xmath8 remains constant during the reconstruction process .",
    "the new configuration is accepted with the probability given by the metropolis rule @xmath17 where @xmath18 plays the role of a temperature . in the case of rejection , the old configuration is restored . by decreasing the temperature @xmath18 configurations with minimal energy @xmath19 , i.e. with minimal deviations of the stochastic functions @xmath20 from their reference functions @xmath21 ,",
    "are generated .",
    "the process terminates after a certain number of consecutive rejections . here",
    ", the reconstruction was finished after @xmath22 consecutive rejections .",
    "using equation ( [ eq : i ] ) the two - point probability function is defined as @xmath23 for a homogeneous and isotropic medium @xmath24 with @xmath25 holds . in this case",
    "@xmath26 can be evaluated without loss of information from the intersection of the sample with a plane or even a line . to speed up the numerical evaluation of @xmath27",
    "it is therefore sufficient to sample @xmath27 only in directions of the principal axis given by the unit vectors @xmath28 @xcite .",
    "hence , @xmath27 is calculated by evaluating equation ( [ eq : g ] ) for every pair of voxels at @xmath29 and @xmath30 with @xmath31 where @xmath32 is a cut off value determined by the system size or a multiple of the correlation length . during the reconstruction only those terms in @xmath27",
    "are updated that have changed due to the exchange of voxels . on the sample boundaries we impose periodic boundary conditions .",
    "for reconstruction purposes this simplification , i.e. the reconstruction of @xmath27 only in the direction of the three coordinate axes , may create some problems . because all other directions remain unoptimized , @xmath27 measured in these directions",
    "may differ from the reference function .",
    "if this happens the reconstructed sample is no longer isotropic @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the reconstruction of @xmath27 along orthogonal lines only , reduces the three - dimensional optimization problem effectively to the optimization of three one - dimensional two - point probability functions .",
    "this may reduce the number of conditions that the two - point probability function has to fulfill to be realizable @xcite , and may lead one to conclude incorrectly that the reconstruction is realizable in the space dimension of interest .",
    "however , the problem of realizability does not apply to the reconstructions presented here , because the two - point probability functions used as reference functions are measured from digitized three - dimensional images of real sandstones .",
    "nevertheless , the reconstructions have to be checked for their isotropy .",
    "the isotropy of the reconstructions can be improved e.g. by a full reconstruction of the two - point probability function using fourier transform techniques or by rotating the sample during the reconstruction .",
    "this was done for two - dimensional reconstructions in @xcite .",
    "however , for three - dimensional reconstructions this leads to prohibitive increase of computation time .    for the specific surface @xmath33 , i.e. the surface per unit volume of the interface between pore space and matrix space ,",
    "it is known that @xcite @xmath34 therefore , a reconstruction of @xmath27 implies that the specific surface area of the reconstructions matches that of the reference sample .",
    "equation ( [ eq : ss ] ) may also be used for the calculation of the specific surface . here , we use a different , numerically very efficient method introduced in @xcite for calculating @xmath33 .",
    "the lineal path function @xmath35 is defined to be the probability of finding a line segment of length @xmath36 entirely in pore space when the line segment is randomly thrown into the porous medium @xcite .",
    "hence , for @xmath37 , @xmath38 holds .",
    "the lineal path function is related to the linear contact distribution introduced in mathematical stochastic geometry @xcite .",
    "the lineal path function is calculated as follows : for a given pore voxel the lineal path @xmath36 in units of the resolution @xmath5 is given as the number of pore voxels lying between the given pore voxel and the nearest matrix voxel in direction @xmath28 .",
    "evaluating the line segments starting from each pore voxel in all three coordinate directions @xmath28 and counting the number @xmath39 of line segments with length @xmath36 , the lineal path function is given by @xmath40 where we assume non periodic boundary conditions .",
    "the lineal path function incorporates information about the connectivity of the pore space .",
    "of course it would be desirable to reconstruct functions which provide a more complete information about the geometric connectivity of the pore space , as for example the cluster correlation function @xcite or the local percolation probability @xcite , but currently the computation time for evaluating these functions prevents their use in the above reconstruction scheme .",
    "the `` pore size '' distribution function @xmath41 is defined such that @xmath42 is the probability that a randomly chosen point in the pore space lies at a distance @xmath43 $ ] from the nearest point on the interface @xcite .",
    "it is related to the spherical contact distribution @xcite .",
    "the associated cumulative distribution function @xmath44 gives the fraction of the pore space which has a diameter larger then @xmath45 .",
    "clearly @xmath46 and @xmath47 the mean pore size is given as @xmath48 the quantity @xmath41 arises in rigorous bounds on the mean survival time @xcite .",
    "we compute an approximation to @xmath41 by choosing a random point in pore space and measuring its distance @xmath49 to the nearest point on the matrix - pore interface assuming periodic boundary conditions .",
    "this process is repeated for several random points in pore space . the `` pore size '' distribution",
    "is then obtained by binning the distances @xmath49 and dividing by the number of random placements in pore space .",
    "we emphasize that the random placements in pore space are not necessarily grid points .",
    "the computation of @xmath49 is only approximate because it requires a modeling of the interface between pore and matrix space . here",
    ", we assume that the internal surface is given by the surface of the cubic voxels .",
    "this is the same modeling which is used e.g. in a computation of the mean survival time or in finite difference calculations of transport properties . in general",
    "this may overestimate the specific surface area appearing in equation ( [ eq : pnod ] ) by a factor of roughly @xmath50 @xcite .    for use in the reconstruction we measured @xmath49 as the distance between a pore voxel and the nearest matrix voxel .",
    "the resulting function is not equal to @xmath41 because @xmath49 can now only take values of @xmath51 with @xmath52 .",
    "the total fraction of percolating cells @xmath53 is a key measure in local porosity theory @xcite .",
    "local porosity theory measures the fluctuations of morphological quantities , e.g. porosity , specific surface , connectivity , in cubic subsamples of the total sample @xcite .",
    "we will refer to such a cubic subsample with side length @xmath54 as a measurement cell .",
    "based on the scale - dependent morphological quantities , the theory provides scale - dependent estimates for transport parameters from a generalized effective medium theory @xcite .    let @xmath55 be the probability that a given measurement cell of side length @xmath54 has a porosity in the interval @xmath56 $ ] .",
    "the probability density function @xmath57 is called local porosity distribution . the probability that a given measurement cell with porosity @xmath8 is percolating in all three directions",
    "is the local percolation probability function @xmath58 . here",
    ", percolating in all three directions means that each face of the measurement cell is connected to the opposite face with a path lying entirely in pore space . using this ,",
    "the total fraction of percolating cells is given by @xmath59 the total fraction of percolating cells @xmath60 is the probability of finding a measurement cell with side length @xmath54 , which is percolating in all three directions .",
    "hence , @xmath53 is a measure for the geometrical connectivity .",
    "contrary to the previous quantities the mean survival time @xmath61 is not a purely geometrical but a physical observable .",
    "the mean survival time @xmath61 is the average life time of a random walker , which can freely move in pore space , but gets instantly absorbed on contact with the pore - matrix interface .",
    "it is a measure of a characteristic pore size .",
    "the mean survival time @xmath61 is calculated using a first passage cube ( fpc ) algorithm @xcite .",
    "the fpc algorithm uses the fact that the mean time it takes for a certain type of diffusive random walker starting at the center of a cube with side length @xmath62 to cross the surface of this cube is given by @xmath63 hence , it is not necessary to simulate the steps of the walker in detail . instead one determines the biggest cube centered around the position of the walker , which is still entirely in pore space .",
    "the walker then jumps on the surface of this fpc and a time given by equation ( [ eq : tau ] ) is added to its life time .",
    "this procedure is iterated until the walker touches the interface and gets absorbed .",
    "the mean survival time is given by averaging over many walkers .",
    "the probability with which the walker jumps to a certain point on the surface of the fpc is described by a probability density function @xmath64 where @xmath65 and @xmath66 are the coordinates on the surface assuming without loss of generality that @xmath67 . for an analytic expression of @xmath64",
    "we refer to @xcite .",
    "in this section we present results for reconstructions of a berea sandstone and a fontainebleau sandstone . for both sandstones we computed reconstructions with the lineal path function and the two - point probability function ( ls reconstruction ) as well as reconstructions with the `` pore size '' distribution function and the two - point probability function ( ps reconstruction ) . the berea sandstone and its reconstructions have dimension @xmath68 and resolution @xmath69 .",
    "the porosity is @xmath70 .",
    "the fontainebleau sandstone has dimensions @xmath71 its reconstructions have dimension @xmath68 .",
    "the resolution is @xmath72 , the porosity is @xmath73 .",
    "the reconstructed functions were calculated as described above , i.e. we used periodic boundary conditions except for the lineal path function .",
    "the two - point probability function @xmath26 was reconstructed in the interval @xmath74 . the annealing process terminated after @xmath22 subsequent rejections .",
    "we performed 5 ls reconstructions and 5 ps reconstructions for both the berea and the fontainebleau sandstone .",
    "some of the results are summarized in table [ tb : berea ] for the berea and table [ tb : fntbl ] for the fontainebleau sandstone , respectively .",
    "the values are averaged over 5 reconstructions .",
    "the quantity @xmath75 is the mean survival time multiplied by the diffusion coefficient @xmath76 for the random - walk process discussed above .",
    "the quantity @xmath77 gives the fraction of pore voxels which belong to the percolating cluster .",
    "shows 2d slices of the original and the reconstructed sandstones .",
    "the top row shows the original sandstones , the row in the middle the ls reconstructions , and the bottom row the ps reconstructions .",
    "the slices were taken from reconstructions with the value of @xmath78 close to the average values given in the tables .",
    "all slices are chosen to have average porosity . in the case of the berea sandstone",
    "the reconstructions look similar to the original sandstone while for the fontainebleau sandstone the reconstructions are clearly distinguishable from the original sandstone .",
    "the matrix of the original fontainebleau sandstone shows a granular structure where single grains can be identified .",
    "the pores between these grains are long and narrow . in the reconstructions",
    "no granular structure of the matrix space is visible .",
    "the pores of the reconstructions are more rounded in shape . for both sandstones",
    "the number of isolated pores is significantly higher in the reconstructions .",
    "this is expressed by @xmath77 , the fraction of pore space belonging to the percolating cluster . for the berea @xmath79 of the pore space",
    "belongs to the percolating cluster whereas for the reconstructions this fraction is roughly @xmath80 smaller . for the fontainebleau",
    "the difference is even bigger . in the original sandstone @xmath81 of the pore space percolates while for the reconstructions @xmath77 is approximately @xmath82 .",
    "here we find that one ls and one ps reconstruction of the fontainebleau is not percolating in all three directions .",
    "in the course of our work we used also a slowly decreasing step function for the temperature @xmath18 to obtain an optimal match of the reconstructed functions .",
    "surprisingly , with a slow cooling schedule the majority of the reconstructed configurations was not percolating in all three directions .",
    "furthermore , the reconstructed samples showed a strong anisotropy with @xmath83 of order @xmath84 where @xmath85 denotes the two - point probability function measured in the directions @xmath86 .",
    "for the reconstructions presented here , we used a fast exponential cooling schedule @xmath87 where @xmath13 as above denotes the iteration step .",
    "this cooling schedule took approximately @xmath88 iteration steps to complete a reconstruction , whereas the slow cooling took more than @xmath89 iterations steps . using the fast cooling schedule all reconstructions of the berea sandstone are percolating in all three directions and only one ls and one ps reconstruction of the fontainebleau is not percolating . also with the fast cooling schedule",
    "the reconstructed functions are matched very well , i.e. @xmath90 is of order @xmath91 , @xmath92 is of order @xmath93 .",
    "moreover , the anisotropy measured in terms of @xmath94 was reduces by an order of magnitude .",
    "plotting @xmath85 only the ps reconstructions of the fontainebleau showed small deviations .    our explanation for the fact that a slower cooling schedule results in reconstructions with stronger anisotropy and only poor connectivity is the artificial anisotropy introduced by reconstructing @xmath27 and @xmath95 only in three directions . with increasing number of iterations the influence of the isotropic",
    ", random starting configuration is decreased while the anisotropic calculation scheme of the two - point probability functions as described above becomes more significant .",
    "this view agrees with previous work @xcite where 3d isotropic reconstructions of sandstones using also a fast cooling schedule were presented .",
    "the poor connectivity of the reconstructions with slow cooling schedule may be a result of their strong anisotropy .    in figures [ fig : cf ] , [ fig : lp ] and [ fig : pdf ] the two - point probability functions",
    "@xmath27 , the lineal path functions @xmath95 , and the `` pore size '' distribution function @xmath96 , respectively , are plotted for both sandstones using lines and for typical reconstructions using dots . here , typical means that the energy given by equation ( [ eq : energy ] ) of the reconstructed functions is close to the average value . in the case of the two - point probability function ,",
    "the reconstructed functions appear to be indistinguishable from the reference functions .",
    "the same applies to the lineal path functions measured from the ls reconstructions .",
    "the lineal path functions of the ps reconstructions clearly underestimate the reference functions .",
    "complementary to this , @xmath96 is equally matched by both types of reconstructions as shown in .",
    "a logarithmic plot of @xmath96 and @xmath95 reveals that the reconstructions only poorly match the tails of those functions .",
    "this is due to the extremely small values of @xmath41 and @xmath35 for large @xmath49 and large @xmath36 , respectively .",
    "furthermore , for the lineal path function @xmath95 this may be a finite size effect because @xmath95 is a long ranged function with @xmath97 for values of @xmath36 in the order of a third of the system size .",
    "looking at figure [ fig : pdf ] it seems that for our reconstructions the lineal path function @xmath95 and the two - point probability function @xmath27 incorporate nearly the same information about the shape of the pores as @xmath27 and @xmath96 do .",
    "moreover , as seen from figure [ fig : lp ] the ps reconstruction lacks information about long line segments .",
    "this may be understood from the fact that @xmath96 is a very short ranged function with @xmath98 only in a range smaller than the correlation length .",
    "for the berea sandstone @xmath99 for @xmath100 and for the fontainebleau sandstone @xmath41=0 for @xmath101 . hence , even though @xmath96 contains full three - dimensional information about spherical regions in pore space , similar information is already provided by the two - point probability function @xmath27 .",
    "looking at the parameters given in table [ tb : berea ] and [ tb : fntbl ] the ps reconstructions match better the specific surface .",
    "this is expected because the specific surface @xmath33 can be measured from either @xmath27 or @xmath96 as seen from equation ( [ eq : ss ] ) and ( [ eq : pnod ] ) . however , the value of @xmath33 measured from equation ( [ eq : pnod ] ) turns out to be roughly a factor @xmath50 bigger than the value computed from equation ( [ eq : ss ] ) .",
    "this is due to the simple surface modeling in the calculation of @xmath96 as discussed above .",
    "we believe the kink in @xmath41 for @xmath102 to be an artifact of the discretization .",
    "in the case of berea we find the best agreement of the mean pore size @xmath103 for the ps reconstructions , while in the case of the fontainebleau the match appears to be better for the ls reconstruction .",
    "the lineal path function seems to be better suited to describe the long narrow pores of the fontainebleau sandstone than the `` pore size '' distribution . as already seen from the 2d slices the appearance of the berea sandstone is quite similar to the appearance of the reconstructions .",
    "the pores are much more rounded in shape . here ,",
    "the reconstruction is slightly improved with respect to the mean pore size by incorporating @xmath96 , which contains information about spherical regions .",
    "we find analogous results for the mean survival time @xmath61 , which is a diffusive transport property .",
    "in fact the mean survival time can be related to the mean `` pore size '' @xcite .",
    "the mean survival time is a physical transport property , but unlike the fluid permeability , it does not capture information about the dynamical connectivity of the pore space ; indeed , neither does the conductivity ( or formation factor ) . nonetheless , a cross - property formula relating the fluid permeability to a combination of the porosity , mean survival time and formation factor @xmath104 has been shown to be a highly accurate estimate of @xmath16 for sandstones @xcite .",
    "this cross - property formula was used to demonstrate that the permeability of another reconstructed sandstone @xcite was in excellent agreement with the exact stokes solution determination of the permebaility of the original sandstone @xcite .",
    "we note that a good match of @xmath61 alone may not always indicate a good match for @xmath105 or @xmath16 .",
    "in fact , combining results from @xcite and @xcite suggest that @xmath105 correlates strongly with the local percolation probability @xmath53 which is a measure of the geometrical connectivity .",
    "we find significant differences between the local percolation probabilities of the real sandstones and the present reconstructions",
    ".    shows plots of the local percolation probability @xmath53 for the original sandstones , the ls reconstructions , the ps reconstructions , and reconstructions of the two - point probability function only ( s reconstruction ) .",
    "the pure s reconstructions are included here for comparison to previous work @xcite .",
    "the curves shown for the reconstructions are averaged over five configurations each .",
    "the local percolation probability @xmath53 of the reconstructions lie well below the curves of the original sandstones . from this plot",
    "it seems , that neither the use of @xmath95 nor the use of @xmath96 can significantly improve the geometric connectivity compared to the reconstruction of @xmath27 only .",
    "the differences between the curves of the three reconstructions seems to be within the range of statistical fluctuations .",
    "nevertheless , a similar result for the s reconstruction of the fontainebleau sandstone was presented in @xcite for a larger sample .",
    "other work @xcite showed that a ls reconstruction of a different fontainebleau sandstone reproduced the geometric connectivity well .    in general comparing the ls reconstructions and the ps reconstructions",
    "the resulting configurations are quite similar . for our reconstructions",
    "the two - point probability function @xmath27 and the lineal path function @xmath95 incorporate nearly the same morphological information as @xmath27 and @xmath96 do .",
    "looking at the reconstructions of the berea sandstone and the reconstructions of the fontainebleau sandstone it appears that the latter one is much more demanding to reconstruct .",
    "this may be due to its characteristic granular structure , the narrow pore throats , the lower porosity , and to the larger sample size of the original sandstone .",
    "we also note that the berea sample is only @xmath106 resulting in poor statistical quality .",
    "our work has shown that simulated annealing provides a flexible and simple to implement method for reconstructing two - phase random media and that local porosity theory provides highly sensitive tools for their comparison and analysis . however , with present computer power there is still a need to introduce simplifications to reduce the computation time . reconstructing the two - point probability function @xmath27 only in certain directions , may introduce artificially a strong anisotropy or affect the connectivity .",
    "we find , that a fast cooling schedule can reduce this problem .",
    "this implies that the final configuration is not completely independent from the initial configuration , and hence the reconstructed microstructure does not only depend on the reconstructed statistical functions as would be desirable .",
