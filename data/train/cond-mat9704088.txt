    "despite its long history , the random field ising model ( rfim ) is not yet fully undesrstood@xcite .",
    "it is known that in three dimensions and for weak disorder there is a paramagnetic to ferromagnetic phase transition but the nature of the transition is still unknown .",
    "what is most remarquable is that the rfim is ( together with branched polymers @xcite ) one of the very few cases where perturbative renormalization group ( prg ) can be analyzed to all orders of pertubation theory@xcite and this analysis leads to wrong conclusions ( while for the branched polymers the same analysis is correct ! ) .",
    "it has been argued that this failure of prg is due to replica symmetry breaking@xcite . this failure raises the more general question of the validity of perturbative renormalization group for disordered systems .    in the present paper",
    "we study numerically the phase transition of the rfim in three dimensions .",
    "several numerical studies have already been performed@xcite but the problem has been proven to be very difficult and , in our opinion , no definite conclusion about the nature of the transition has been drawn yet .",
    "we simulated much larger sizes than before ( up to @xmath6 ) with much higher statistics and we establish new results on the phase transition of the rfim .",
    "we find that the magnetization is discontinuous at the transition both for the gaussian and bimodal distribution .",
    "the energy and its derivative are continuous only for the gaussian distribution .",
    "the exponents are found to be non classical .",
    "such a behaviour has already been suggested on the grounds of real space renormalization group @xcite .",
    "( this result has been often overlooked in the past due to the approximations of the method . )",
    "we also find different exponents for different random field distributions , which is in contradiction with the prg .",
    "the hamiltonian of the rfim is given by    @xmath7    where @xmath8 runs over neighbouring sites of the lattice ( we have only considered three dimensional cubic lattices with periodic boundary conditions ) and @xmath9 are independent random variables identically distributed with zero mean and variance one . for a given random field sample , one can vary both the ferromagnetic coupling @xmath1 and the temperature @xmath10 , i.e. the phase boundary is a line in the @xmath1 , @xmath10 plane .",
    "it is thought , in accordance with prg , that the nature of the transition and the value of the exponents do not depend on the position on the transition line , nor on the direction one crosses it , and that this is true down to zero temperature .",
    "so it is advantageous to work at @xmath11 where it has been shown that the rfim is equivalent to the problem of finding a maximum flow in a graph@xcite , for which very fast ( polynomial ) algorithms are known .",
    "note that these algorithms provide the _ exact _ groud - states and therefore there is no thermalization problem .",
    "simulations using such algorithms have already been performed in the past@xcite . in the present paper",
    "we use the latest version of the algorithm developped by goldberg and tarjan@xcite , which we optimized for the case of the cubic lattice .",
    "it has been shown @xcite that this algorithm converges to the ground state in a time @xmath12 where l is the linear size of the cubic lattice .",
    "we found experimentally that @xmath13@xcite .",
    "we first consider the case of a gaussian distribution of the random field with variance equal to one .",
    "it is customary to present the data as a function of @xmath14 . for every sample @xmath9 ,",
    "we chose equally spaced @xmath15 s with @xmath16 and found the corresponding ground state .",
    "we considered lattices of 16 different linear sizes @xmath0 , from @xmath17 to @xmath18 .",
    "we studied between 750 samples for @xmath18 and 20000 samples for @xmath19 and @xmath20 .",
    "we study the variation of the absolute value of the magnetization @xmath21 and of the energy as a function of @xmath15 .",
    "we have found that there is a region in @xmath15 where there are large discontinuities of @xmath22 and that outside that region @xmath23 is a smooth function of @xmath15 .",
    "the amplitude of the discontinuities is volume independent ( this is shown in fig .  [",
    "f : fig1 ] ) , while the width of the region in @xmath15 where they appear , shrinks as the volume increases .",
    "we analyze our data as follows . for every @xmath9 sample , we chose the @xmath24 largest variations of the magnetization between two succesive values of @xmath15 , @xmath25 and @xmath26 .",
    "let s call @xmath27 , the values of @xmath15 at which they occur .",
    "the choice of @xmath24 is somehow arbitrary .",
    "we took @xmath28 .",
    "it turns out that the @xmath29 s fluctuate from sample to sample and their probability distribution is well described by a gaussian with mean @xmath30 and variance @xmath31 .",
    "the variance decreases with @xmath0 and is compatible with a power law decay :    @xmath32    we first made the ansatz that : @xmath33 i.e. that there is a single discontinuity in the infinite volume limit and that the approach to the thermodynamic limit obeys a power law .",
    "we obtain a more accurate determination of @xmath34 by taking differences to eliminate @xmath35 from the fit @xmath36 we have found that our results can not be described by a single power for the whole range of sizes we have studied .",
    "we tried the following alternatives .",
    "+ a ) analyze only the largest sizes that are compatible with eq .",

    "we found that sizes larger or equal to @xmath37 are well described by eq .",

    "[ e : eqdelta ] : @xmath44 .",
    "the choices of the lower size cut - off and of the number of discontinuities @xmath45 are quite arbitrary and induce systematic uncertainties on @xmath34 . in order to get an idea on these uncertainties",
    ", we tried different `` reasonable '' choices , i.e. choices with a reasonable @xmath46 per degree of freedom . keeping only sizes larger or equal to @xmath47",
    ", we found that @xmath48 and @xmath49 . with 90% probability @xmath50 .",
    "these results have been obtained by analyzing the 5 largest discontinuities of the magnetization ( @xmath51 ) .",
    "we also took @xmath52 and , in this case , @xmath53 .",
    "we conclude that the dependence of @xmath34 on @xmath54 is small .",
    "+ b ) consider also a subdominant power law correction : @xmath55 this ansatz describes well the data down to a value of @xmath0 as small as @xmath20 with a @xmath40 per degree of freedom @xmath56 and yields @xmath57 and @xmath58 .",
    "there are many parameters in this fit , @xmath59 and @xmath60 are correlated and the uncertainty on @xmath34 and @xmath60 much larger than before",
    ". the best fit to the data is shown in fig .",
    "[ f : fig2 ] , while the allowed region in @xmath34 and @xmath60 is in fig .",
    "[ f : fig3 ] .",
    "we conclude that the appearance of several discontinuities in the magnetization is a finite volume artifact and that our results are fully compatible with the hypothesis of a single discontinuity in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "the approch to this limit is a very slow power law .",
    "the value of this power depends essentially on the assumptions underlying the data analysis : a single power law or a power law behaviour with a subdominant correction .",
    "this discontinuity has not been seen in the previous simulations for the following reason .",
    "only the average magnetization has been measured and for finite volumes , the position of the discontinuities fluctuates from sample to sample so that the average magnetization seems continuous .",
    "concerning now the energy , it is convenient to separate the energy into two terms , @xmath61 , with @xmath62 for a fixed sample , the value of @xmath63 in the ground state is the derivative of the energy per spin with respect to @xmath64 .",
    "it can be shown that @xmath65 is a non decreasing function of @xmath1 , i.e. , @xmath66 is a convex function of @xmath1 .",
    "we observe large discontinuities of @xmath67 as a function of @xmath1 , as in the case of the magnetization , but , in the present case , the amplitude of these discontinuities shrinks as the volume increases .",
    "our data are compatible with the following ansatz : @xmath68 where @xmath69 denote the @xmath70 largest discontinuities of @xmath71 .",
    "we find @xmath72 therefore @xmath73 , i.e. the @xmath1 derivative of the energy , becomes continuous at the thermodynamic limit . despite the discontinuity of the magnetization ,",
    "the energy and its first derivative are continuous and the exponents are non classical .",
    "[ e : delatei ] sheds some light to the long standing question of the existence of different spin configurations almost degenerate in energy .",
    "the reasonning goes as follows . for @xmath74 , @xmath75 , while for @xmath76 , @xmath77 in general @xmath71 is a slow varying monotonous function of @xmath78 except in the region @xmath79 where most of the variation occurs .",
    "if the spin configuration @xmath80 is a ground state for @xmath81 with energy per spin @xmath82 and another spin configuration @xmath83 is a ground state for @xmath84 with energy per spin @xmath85 then for @xmath86 , the two configurations have exactly the same energy @xmath87 ( @xmath88 because of the convexity of @xmath66 ) , which is either identical to @xmath89 or lower . in the former case the ground state energy is exactly known in the entire range @xmath90 . in the latter case one could iterate this procedure and so it is possible to compute the ground state energy exactly as a function of @xmath1 .",
    "this will be exploited in a forthcoming publication . ] .",
    "if the largest discontinuity is of the order of @xmath91 , it follows that in the interval @xmath92 there are at least @xmath93 different configurations with energy @xmath94 , which are pairwise exactly degenerate for some value of @xmath78 .",
    "this argument is valid for any choice of @xmath71 , @xmath95 , arbitrarly close to each other .      in order to compare with previous simulations ,",
    "we have considered the so called disconnected susceptibility @xmath96 i.e. the square of the magnetization averaged over the disorder .",
    "it has been assumed that at zero temperature @xmath97 where @xmath98 is the location of the transition at infinite volume and @xmath99 the correlation length exponent . in @xcite",
    "it was found that , for gaussian random fields at zero temperature , @xmath100 and @xmath101 .",
    "in fact eq .",
    "[ e : kidis ] is compatible with our results . to see this , we propose the following simplified model : @xmath102 for @xmath103 and @xmath104 for @xmath105 , where @xmath106 is a gaussian random variable with mean @xmath107 and standart deviation @xmath108 .",
    "a simple calculation gives , in this model , @xmath109 .",
    "if @xmath110 , this agrees with eq .",
    "[ e : kidis ] provided @xmath111 ( which is compatible with @xcite ) and @xmath112 .",
    "we found above ( case a ) , that @xmath113 and @xmath114 , compatible with @xmath110 .",
    "this gives @xmath115 which is slightly different from the value @xmath101 of @xcite .",
    "if we restrict our analysis to the same ( smaller ) sizes as in @xcite we find @xmath116 , i.e. @xmath117 , as in @xcite and @xmath118 .",
    "alternatively we also have fitted directly our data using eq .",
    "[ e : kidis ] .",
    "this provides a different method of analysis .",
    "since , as already mentionned , a single power is not sufficient to describe the whole range of sizes , we have restricted our analysis to the largest sizes .",
    "we have found @xmath119 in agreement with our simple model and @xmath120 , a value compatible with the previously deduced value .",
    "we consider next the case of a bimodal field distribution , @xmath121 i.e. @xmath122 with equal probability . for every sample @xmath9 ,",
    "we chose equally spaced @xmath15 s with @xmath16 and we scanned in @xmath15 .",
    "the behaviour of the magnetization is very similar to the case of the gaussian probability distribution of the random field .",
    "we found again that there is a region in @xmath123 where there are large discontinuities of @xmath22 .",
    "the amplitude of the discontinuities is volume independent , while the width of the region in @xmath15 where they appear , shrinks as the volume increases .",

    ", we found that @xmath128 and @xmath129 . with 90% probability @xmath130",
    "these results were obtained by analyzing the 4 largest discontinuities of the magnetization ( @xmath131 ) .",
    "+ b ) considering also a subdominant power correction the data are well described with a @xmath40 per degree of freedom @xmath132 and yields @xmath133 and @xmath134 unfortunatly the error bars are much larger than before . the allowed region in @xmath34 and @xmath60 is presented in fig .",
    "[ f : fig3 ] .    for the energy ,",
    "the situation is more complex .",
    "in addition to the type of singularities we observed in the gaussian case , there are new stronger singulaties , at integer values of @xmath15 , i.e. @xmath135 these singularities are present for all sizes and the amplitude of the discontinuity of @xmath136 at these points seems to be volume independent .",
    "nothing in particular is happening to the magnetization at these points .",
    "while the presence of these singularities is intuitively easy to understand in the case of the bimodal distribution , the decoupling of the magnetization from the energy is less intuitive .",
    "in this paper we have found that he exponent @xmath34 , which describes the finite size corrections and is usually identified with @xmath137 ( @xmath138 is the correlation length exponent ) , seems to take different values for the gaussian or the bimodal distribution of the random field .",
    "this would signal the breaking of universality for the rfim .",
    "it is therefore important to discuss a ) the uncertainties on the determination of @xmath34 and b ) the identification of @xmath34 with @xmath139 .",
    "+ a ) the statistical errors on @xmath34 are rather small .",
    "the largest uncertainties are due to the assumptions made to analyze the data , namely single power law behaviour or inclusion of subdominant corrections in @xmath0 .",
    "but whatever the assumptions are , one finds significally different values , provided one uses the same assumptions for both random field distributions .",
    "+ b ) let us remind the arguments which lead to the identification of @xmath34 with @xmath137 for finite systems of linear sizes @xmath0 , one can define an effective critical temperature @xmath140 . for a second order transition , @xmath140 could be the temperature for which the susceptibility is maximum .",
    "the finite size scaling hypothesis asserts that @xmath140 is shifted from @xmath141 , the critical temperature of the infinite volume system : @xmath142 .",
    "assume a second order transition for the rfim and , in agreement with prg , that the exponents do not depend on the position on the transition line in the @xmath10 @xmath1 plane , or the direction one crosses it .",
    "assume furthermore , that this is valid down to zero temperature .",
    "we then expect the locations of the magnetization discontinuities @xmath143 s to be shifted from their infinite volume value @xmath144 : @xmath145 , i.e. that the exponent @xmath34 defined above is @xmath146 and therefore is universal . if @xmath34 is different for the gaussian or the bimodal random field distribution as we claimed above , one of the above generally accepted assumptions , which can be derived in the context of prg , in not valid for the random field ising model .",
    "after all it is already known that the @xmath147 expansion leads to incorrect results for the rfim .",
    "the most conservative attitude would be to assume ( without any a priori reason ) that the bimodal distribution is singular at @xmath11 and that the general argument does not apply .",
    "but we would like to point out that , except from aesthetic appealing , the only theoretical argument for universality in disordered systems is based on ( unbroken ) replicas and perturbative renormalization group .",
    "and we know that this may be incorrect .",
    "we would like to point out that also in the spin - glass case , there is numerical evidence that universality may be broken@xcite ) .",
    "we feel therefore that universality should be further checked for disordered systems .",
    "in particular it would be interesting to study other distributions of random fields ."
