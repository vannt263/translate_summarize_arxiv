    "in strongly anisotropic layered high temperature superconductors such as ( @xmath0 ) , the superconducting layers @xmath1 ( s - layers ) together with intermediate dielectric layers ( @xmath2 ) form the system of intrinsic josephson junctions ( ijjs)@xcite . the thickness of the s - layers in a high - temperature superconductor is comparable to the screening length of the electric charge and charge relaxation length .",
    "for this reason , the screening of the charge in an individual s - layer is incomplete and the electric field induced in an individual josephson junction penetrates to the neighboring junctions .",
    "the electric neutrality of the s - layers is dynamically broken .",
    "when an external electric current flows through the ijjs , the superconducting layers are in a nonequilibrium state because of the injection of quasiparticles and cooper pairs@xcite .",
    "since an uncompensated electric charge exists in the junctions , an additional current between superconducting layers should be taken into account .",
    "this contribution to the quasiparticle current owing to the difference between generalized scalar potentials is called diffusion current @xcite . in the absence of the complete screening of the charge in the s - layer ,",
    "the josephson relation for the gauge invariant phase difference between s - layers is generalized .",
    "in contrast to the equilibrium case , the derivative of the phase difference in the l - th junction depends now not only on the voltage @xmath3 in this junction but also on the voltages in the neighboring ( ( l -1)th and ( l + 1)th ) josephson junctions .",
    "the dynamics of a stack of ijjs in hts are theoretically investigated previously with the quasi - neutrality breakdown effect @xcite and the quasiparticle charge imbalance effect @xcite . in ref.@xcite ,",
    "two effects are observed experimentally for the stationary case ( i.e. no displacement current ) which result from the charge imbalance in the s - layers .",
    "the first one is the shifting of the shapiro step from the canonical value @xmath4 , where f is the frequency of radiation , @xmath5 is planck s constant and e is the electric charge .",
    "the second effect occurs when two mesas structures are close to each other on the same base crystal and the influence of the current through one mesa on the voltage drops across the other mesa is measured .",
    "the charge imbalance effect is essential if the layer thickness @xmath6 is smaller than the characteristic length of the nonequilibrium relaxation @xmath7 @xcite . in the layered superconductors with ijjs nonequilibrium effects",
    "become important since the effective layer thickness is small ( 3 @xmath8 10 @xmath9 ) and a typical value of @xmath7 is about 1 @xmath10 , so that @xmath6 @xmath11 @xmath7 @xcite .",
    "in this paper we present the results of the investigation of the time dependence of the voltage in each josephson junction and the quasiparticle potential in each s - layer in the stack of ijjs in the presence of non - stationary nonequilibrium charge imbalance effect .",
    "we use the capacitively coupled josephson junctions model ( ccjj+dc ) including the charge imbalance effect ( cib ) .",
    "let us consider a system of n+1 s - layers in anisotropic high - tc superconductor shown in fig .",
    "the thickness of the superconducting and the insulating layers are denoted by @xmath12 and @xmath13 , respectively . at the edges of the stack the effective thickness of the s - layer can be extended due to the proximity effect into the attached metals .",

    "the gauge invariant phase difference and the voltage of each ijj are represented by @xmath20 and @xmath21 , respectively , while the tunneling current is represented by @xmath22 for the first and the last s - layers and by @xmath23 for the middle layers ( see fig.1 ) .",
    "the quasiparticle potential of each s - layer is represented by @xmath24 .",
    "the system of equations describing this electric scheme includes : the generalized josephson relation with charge imbalance and the total current given by the cib model , in addition to the kinetic equations for the quasiparticle potential in the s - layers @xcite    @xmath25    where @xmath26 is the voltage , normalized to @xmath27 , @xmath28 is the plasma frequency , @xmath29 is the critical current of the junction and c is the capacitance of the junctions , @xmath30 is the coupling parameter between ijjs , @xmath31 is the dissipation parameter ( if @xmath32 @xmath33 1 we have under - damped case , while for @xmath32 @xmath34 1 we have over - damped case @xcite ) , r is the junction resistance , @xmath35 is the normalized time , @xmath36 is the normalized quasi - particle potential , @xmath37 is the normalized quasi - particle relaxation time , @xmath38 = @xmath39 is the non - equilibrium parameter , @xmath40 is the penetration depth of the electric field and @xmath41 is the quasi - particle current of each s - layer , dot means the time",
    ". an estimation of these parameters can be found in ref.@xcite .",
    "eq.(1 ) shows that the phase of each junction depends on the voltage of the neighboring junctions and the difference between the quasi - particle potential of the neighboring s - layers .",

    "we solve this system of equations numerically using the fourth order runge - kutta method .",
    "in this section we present the ivc and time dependence of the voltage and the quasiparticle potential in a stack of ijjs .",
    "we consider a system of five ijjs with @xmath32=0.2 ( under - damped case , where the iv characteristic has a hysteresis region @xcite ) . fig . 2 demonstrates the ivc of stack at @xmath32=0.2 and @xmath30=0 .",

    "the voltage for the ijjs in o - state is a straight line in this scale ( see solid thick and solid thin curve ) .",
    "however , in the inset we can see small ripples in the voltage for these junctions , as a result of the coupling between ijjs and the charge imbalance on the s - layers .",
    "these ripples depend on the difference in the quasiparticle potential on the neighboring s - layers ( see eq.(1 ) ) .    in fig . 4 ( b , c ) the time dependences of voltage at points c and d are shown respectively .",
    "the voltages of all junctions oscillate with the same amplitude and frequency . the frequency of voltage oscillations at point d ( which corresponds to the hysteresis region ) is less than the frequency at point c , because these points correspond to different voltages in the iv characteristic ( see fig .",

    "this behavior is consistent with the results for the quasiparticle potential in ref.@xcite for the stationary case .",
    "we have investigated the effect of charge imbalance on the iv characteristic in a stack of five ijjs . in the case of nonstationary charge imbalance in the stack of ijjs , we have found that not all the junctions are collectively switched to the resistive state , which is due to the current effect .",
    "we have simulated the branch structure of the iv characteristic and have investigated the time dependence of voltage for each ijjs and the quasiparticle potential for each s - layer at different points of the iv characteristic .",
