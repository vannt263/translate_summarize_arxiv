    "spin - charge separation ( scs ) is a hallmark of non - fermi - liquid behavior @xcite .",
    "the essence of scs in one - dimensional ( 1d ) systems is that the elementary excitations carrying spin and charge propagate with different velocities , @xmath4 and @xmath5 respectively , independently of each other .",
    "experimental evidence of scs in the spectral properties of 1d wires was demonstrated in electron tunneling experiments @xcite .",
    "the effect of scs is more pronounced in the `` spin - incoherent regime '' ( see refs . @xcite and references there in ) which is realized in 1d systems with strongly different spin and charge velocities .",
    "one of the key problems of conceptual importance that we discuss in this paper is the manifestation of scs in the interference of electron waves .",
    "we focus on the simplest device for specifically probing the interference  a quantum ring tunnel - coupled to the leads ( see fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) .",
    "the conductance of the ring @xmath6 exhibits the aharonov - bohm ( ab ) effect  @xcite , i.e. , changes periodically with the dimensionless magnetic flux @xmath7 threading the ring  with a period @xmath8entirely due to the interference of electron trajectories winding around the hole ( here @xmath9 is the flux quantum ) .",
    "the sensitivity of the phase of an electron wavefunction to the flux  enables the design of quantum ab interferometers @xcite that can be tuned by the external magnetic field .",
    "transmission through the ring can occur along different ( having different winding numbers ) paths , characterized by transmission amplitudes @xmath10 the classical and interference contributions to the transmission coefficient are proportional to @xmath11 and @xmath12 respectively .",
    "the classical contribution does not depend on @xmath13 , so that efficient manipulation of the ab interferometer by external fields is related to the existence of the interference contribution .",
    "the key obstacle preventing such a manipulation is dephasing of electron waves .",
    "one could expect a strong increase of the dephasing rate due to scs .",
    "indeed , the fermionic excitation that appears in the ring after the tunneling of an electron from a lead splits into charge and spin excitations .",
    "these start propagating with different velocities ( see fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) .",
    "this splitting is known to increase the decay rate of single - electron excitations in the infinite system @xcite to a value @xmath14 as compared to the decay rate @xmath15 for the spinless case . here , @xmath16 is the dimensionless interaction constant which we assume to be small , @xmath17 . one might thus expect a similar enhancement , compared to the spinless case , of dephasing in the interference setup .",
    "the main purpose of the present paper is to demonstrate that this expectation is only true in almost open interferometers but fails when tunneling coupling is sufficiently weak . in the latter limit , the `` aharonov - bohm dephasing rate , '' @xmath18 becomes insensitive to scs . in such interferometers ,",
    "@xmath19 does not depend on the interaction strength and decreases with decreasing tunneling rate .",
    "this prediction is of relevance to applications in modern nanodevices , where quantum interference effects play the important role @xcite .",
    "direct confrontation with experiment appears now to be possible since many - electron nanorings with a few or single conducting channels have been manufactured @xcite .",
    "one can also expect that the classical tunneling transmission is suppressed because the tunneling escape from the ring can only happen if the spin and charge excitations `` collide '' in the vicinity of the contact to the lead .",
    "we show that , remarkably , this expectation is not true independently of the strength of tunneling coupling .",
    "this happens because each level in the ring splits into a number of sublevels .",
    "although the tunneling width of the sublevels is indeed suppressed by scs , this effect is compensated by an increase of the number of the tunneling channels .",
    "the key ingredient of the underlying physics here are multiple windings and returns to the contacts in the finite - size system ( characterized by the level spacing @xmath1 ) . for the case of weak interaction ,",
    "the time between `` spin - charge collisions '' near the contact can be estimated as @xmath20 , since the difference between the spin and charge velocities is linear in @xmath21 . for @xmath22 , the characteristic time during which the spin and charge excitations run together as a whole ( and , therefore ,",
    "can tunnel out of the ring ) is much shorter and given by @xmath23 . as a consequence ,",
    "the tunneling rate is suppressed by the factor @xmath24 , independent of @xmath21 . on the other hand ,",
    "as we show below , the `` spin - charge collisions '' between are not random , they `` collide '' exactly periodically .",
    "this periodicity leads to the formation of fine structures of the electron spectrum and , consequently , to the increase of the number of the tunneling channels . as a result",
    ", the classical transmission through the ring does not change .    as we demonstrated before @xcite ,",
    "dephasing in a strongly closed ring is proportional to the total tunneling rate .",
    "therefore , @xmath19 in does not change in the presence of scs .",
    "we find that , similar to the spinless case , destructive interference between right- and left - moving electrons leads to a series of sharp interaction - induced negative peaks in the high-@xmath0 conductance as a function of magnetic flux .",
    "what is changed by scs is the width and depth of the envelope of the peaks .",
    "this picture fails with increasing tunneling coupling . at sufficiently strong coupling ,",
    "when the phase breaking rate becomes faster then `` collision rate '' @xmath25 all resonances overlap , forming a single negative peak of the width coinciding with the single - particle rate @xmath26",
    "we study the ab conductance of a ll ring weakly coupled by tunneling contacts to the leads .",
    "we consider a symmetric setup with both contacts having the same tunneling rate .",
    "we assume that the coulomb interaction is screened by a ground plane and take the interaction to be pointlike . throughout the paper we focus on the high - temperature regime , @xmath27 where @xmath1 and @xmath28 are the level spacing and tunneling rate , respectively , in disregard of electron - electron interaction .",
    "the condition @xmath22 essentially simplifies calculations compared to the more general case discussed in ref .",
    "in particular , we will find analytically expressions for tunneling and dephasing rates and for conductance of the ring .",
    "the conductance of the ring is proportional to the transmission coefficient g ( ) = ( ) = ( , ) _",
    "t , where @xmath29 stands for averaging over energy within the temperature window .    in order to find @xmath30 we use the kubo formula .",
    "we start with expression for the matsubara green s functions , @xmath31 ( here @xmath32 and @xmath33 stand for right- and left - moving fermions , respectively ) , in the infinite spinful system in the limit of small electron - electron interaction @xcite : & & g^+(x,)=g^-(-x , ) - [ gmats ] + & & \\ { } ^1/2 the main approximation which we make here following ref .",
    "@xcite consists in keeping of the effects of leading ( linear ) order in the interaction strength @xmath21 only and sending to zero all the terms in the electron self - energy that are proportional to @xmath34 .",
    "that is , below we retain the difference between the velocity u ( 1 + 2)v , [ uv ] which is the velocity of charged elementary excitations ( plasmons ) and the velocity @xmath4 of spin excitations ( spinons ) . here",
    "@xmath17 is the interaction constant .",
    "the appearance of the two velocities in the single - particle correlator signifies scs . within the approximation",
    ", the two velocities enter the fermionic green function in a symmetric way .",
    "we will use the approximation , which captures the essential physics of scs , throughout the paper . in the real - time representation , the retarded green functions , corresponding to read ( see eq .",

    "<S> we demonstrate that scs indeed enhances dephasing at strong tunneling , but , remarkably , does not affect dephasing in an almost closed ring . in such rings , the dephasing rate does not depend on the interaction strength and is determined by the tunneling coupling . </S>",
    "<S> similar to the spinless case , the high - temperature conductance shows as a function of magnetic flux a series of interaction - induced sharp negative peaks on top of the classical contribution . </S>"
