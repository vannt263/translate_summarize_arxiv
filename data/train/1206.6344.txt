    "the accelerating voltage has been discussed in a number of works on pulsars beginning from early papers in the 1970s ( sturrock 1971 ; ruderman & sutherland 1975 ; arons & scharlemann 1979 ) .",

    "the character of the polar - cap accelerator strongly depends on @xmath13 ( mestel et al .",

    "the precise @xmath17 is controlled by the curvature of magnetic field lines and the general relativistic effects ( muslimov & tsygan 1992 ) ; its exact value is close to unity and is not essential for the rest of the paper . ] in particular , if @xmath3 , @xmath8 is quickly screened in the charge - separated plasma flowing from the polar - cap surface .",
    "the electric field satisfies maxwell equations that read ( in the co - rotating frame of the star , see e.g. fawley et al . 1977 ; levinson et al . 2005 ) , [ eq : gauss ] = 4(- ) , [ eq : maxw ] = 4(_b- ) .",

    "the deviation of @xmath26 from @xmath27 implies @xmath28 or @xmath29 , which generates electric field .",
    "b08 argued that  ( [ eq : gauss ] ) and ( [ eq : maxw ] ) with @xmath3 always drive the flow toward @xmath18 , like a pendulum is driven by gravity toward its equilibrium position .",

    "the oscillatory behavior of the flow with @xmath3 is , in essence , langmuir oscillations ; they are generated near the boundary where the flow is injected with @xmath30 and accelerated toward @xmath18 .    in this paper , we investigate the accelerator with @xmath3 in more detail . in  2 ,",
    "we write down the steady - state solution for the charge - separated flow , generalized to non - zero temperature of the polar - cap .",
    "we argue that the flow is unstable to small perturbations and can develop into a complicated time - dependent state with a broad momentum distribution . to explore the behavior of the flow , we perform fully kinetic time - dependent simulations .",

    ", the oscillation period is approximately given by ( b08 ) z_0 2 ^ 3/2 , 1 - 1 .",

    "@xmath13 varies due the field - line curvature and general relativistic effects ( muslimov & tsygan 1992 ) . the length - scale of this variation @xmath87 is typically larger or comparable to the stellar radius , which exceeds @xmath59 by several orders of magnitude .",
    "when @xmath13 varies with @xmath32 , the analytical integration of the dynamic equation is not possible and one has to solve the two coupled differential equations ( b08 ) , @xmath88 the solution is similar to the case where @xmath13 is constant , as long as @xmath3 .",
    "the momentum @xmath82 quasi - periodically passes through maxima and minima .",
    "the only difference is that the period @xmath89 and @xmath90 now gradually change with @xmath32 ( see figure  1 in b08 ) .",
    "although the cold flow solution with @xmath76 reproduces very well the electric potential @xmath75 of the exact warm solution with the same average @xmath73 , the warm and cold flows are qualitatively different . their different momentum distribution functions @xmath91 leads to a qualitatively different response to small perturbations",
    "consider first the cold - flow solution shown by the blue dotted curve in figure  [ fig : steady ] .",
    "since all particles are injected with the same momentum @xmath76 , all of them follow a single trajectory in the phase space @xmath92 .",
    "they periodically reach the minimum momentum @xmath73 at @xmath93 ( @xmath94 ) where potential @xmath37 reaches maximum .",
    "there are no particles with momenta @xmath95 , so a small perturbation can not force any particles to reverse their direction of motion , and hence the perturbation will be advected along the flow .",
    "this flow is expected to be stable .",
    "in contrast , the warm flow ( dashed curve in figure  [ fig : steady ] ) has a broad distribution of @xmath73 that extends from @xmath96 . at each peak of the electric potential ( at @xmath97 ) there is a population of particles with nearly zero velocities .",
    "consider a perturbation at @xmath98 .",
    "for example , suppose a small bunch @xmath99 of particles with momenta in a range @xmath100 are slightly pushed forward while the rest of particles are unperturbed .",
    "this perturbation implies a local increase in electric current @xmath101 and hence @xmath102 (  [ eq : maxw ] ) , generating negative electric field @xmath103 at @xmath98 that tends to restore the condition @xmath21 .",
    "in contrast to the initial perturbation , the induced @xmath103 affects _ all _ local particles , regardless of their momenta , not just bunch @xmath99 .",
    "this has two implications : ( 1 ) the induced @xmath104 will easily and quickly reduce @xmath1 back to @xmath31 but will be unable to decelerate bunch @xmath99 to the momentum it would have in the steady state flow  bunch @xmath99 will continue to move to @xmath105 with a larger momentum .",
    "( 2 ) @xmath106 will give very slow particles @xmath95 negative velocities , creating a new bunch @xmath107 that slides backward down the potential hill .",
    "bunch @xmath107 creates @xmath108 at @xmath109 , and the system reacts there by inducing a small @xmath110 , which accelerates all local particles , regardless their momenta , not just bunch @xmath107 . as a result , @xmath1 quickly recovers to @xmath31 , however , bunch @xmath107 is not stopped from moving backward and away from @xmath97 .",
    "one concludes that the perturbation creates a permanent damage to the steady state that broadens the momentum distribution by creating backflowing particles .",
    "this perturbation is _ not _ advected away along the flow , and can develop further .",
    "the backflowing particles turn out to be trapped between two peaks of the electrostatic potential .",
    "further development can be studied with kinetic time - dependent simulations ; it eventually completely destroys the steady state solution .",
    "our numerical method is similar to that used by beloborodov & thompson ( 2007 , hereafter bt07 ) .",
    "the plasma is modeled as a large number @xmath111 of individual particles that flow along the magnetic field lines .",
    "we assume that the magnetic field is fixed in the co - rotating frame of the star ; thus @xmath31 and @xmath2 are fixed .",
    "then the problem becomes essentially one - dimensional , as discussed in detail in bt07 . in the present paper , we consider only charge - separated flows , with no pair creation .",
    "three other differences from the magnetar simulation in bt07 are as follows : ( 1 ) the magnetar problem had @xmath112 ( @xmath2 was negligible compared with @xmath113 ) ; in contrast , @xmath2 is crucial for polar - cap flows considered here .",
    "( 2 ) the presence of gravity was essential for the closed - field circuit considered in bt07 , where the global plasma flow was studied on a scale comparable to the radius of the star ; in the problem considered here the electric fields are screened on a much smaller scale @xmath114 and the gravitational acceleration plays no role .",
    "( 3 ) the flow behavior on the small scales @xmath115 may be studied using a smal computational box @xmath116 with an open outer boundary ( see below ) .    in the absence of pair creation , the flow is composed of particles lifted from the surface . in most simulations presented below",
    "we assume that all particles have the same mass @xmath33 and charge @xmath34 .",
    "the particle motion is described by the equation , @xmath117 where @xmath118 is the momentum of the @xmath119-th particle in units of @xmath120 , and @xmath121 is the self - consistent electric field at the particle location @xmath122 .",
    "the field is found by integrating gauss law (  [ eq : gauss ] ) along the magnetic field line , @xmath123.\\ ] ] here @xmath124 is the column density of particles between @xmath36 and @xmath125 , and we used the boundary condition @xmath56 , as the material below the stellar surface is assumed to be a very good conductor that can emit free charges .",
    "divergence of the perpendicular component of electric field @xmath126 is neglected in  ( [ eq : e ] ) ( see bt07 for discussion of this approximation ) .",
    "the approximation @xmath127 is valid if the characteristic scale of the flow acceleration @xmath89 is smaller than the transverse scale @xmath40 , which is limited by the polar - cap size @xmath128 ; the condition @xmath129 is satisfied in the dead - zone models presented below .",
    "we also assume that @xmath2 is approximately constant on scale @xmath89 .",
    "( [ eq : p ] ) and ( [ eq : e ] ) in essence describe a relativistic , time - dependent diode problem with an additional fixed background charge density @xmath41 .",
    "as we track the motion of all particles individually , the continuity equation is automatically satisfied ; for a charge - separated flow it is equivalent to charge conservation , [ eq : charge ] + = 0 .",
    "( [ eq : maxw ] ) follows from  ( [ eq : gauss ] ) and ( [ eq : charge ] ) , so we will not need  ( [ eq : maxw ] ) . instead , the parameter @xmath31 enters the problem as a boundary condition .",

    "this condition is enforced in the simulation by injecting the charges in the computational box at @xmath36 with the fixed rate @xmath31 ( bt07 ) .",
    "the electric current @xmath31 is enforced at one boundary @xmath36 .",
    "since the computational box has a finite size @xmath131 , we also have to choose a boundary condition at @xmath132 and the value of @xmath131 . in all sample models shown in this paper",
    "we use the simplest boundary condition : particles moving out of the box are lost and no particles enter the box at @xmath132 .",
    "this condition may be refined by allowing a small inflow of returning particles at the outer boundary .",
    "we ran test simulations that show that the refinements are not important as long as the boundary is sufficiently far , so that @xmath131 is much larger than the characteristic scale of the flow acceleration .    in the one - dimensional model ,",
    "the transverse gradients are neglected and the flow effectively has a slab geometry . then it is sufficient to follow particles flowing through a small area @xmath133 of the slab .",
    "this allows one to chose a reasonable number of particles in the computational box , @xmath134 , e.g. @xmath111 , so that their dynamics can be followed in a reasonable computational time . on the other hand",
    ", @xmath135 should be large enough so that the plasma scale @xmath59 contains many particles @xmath136 .    in summary , we choose @xmath135 and @xmath131 so that 1 , n_p = n 1 . in this limit",
    ", the results are expected to be independent of the choice of @xmath135 and @xmath131 ( we verified this by varying the two parameters ) . for most of our simulations @xmath137 and @xmath111 .",
    "another requirement is a small time step of the simulation , @xmath138 , so that plasma oscillations are well resolved .",
    "in our simulations and in reality the plasma above pulsar polar caps is collisionless . in the absence of pair creation it must satisfy the vlasov equation , @xmath139 where @xmath140 is the particle distribution function in phase space .",

    "as anticipated in  2.3 , we find that the steady state becomes unstable if we reduce @xmath162 to zero .",
    "then any small perturbation ( e.g. due to numerical error ) completely destroys the steady state ; instead , a time - dependent state forms , with a broadened momentum distribution function . a steady flow with a finite @xmath170 can also be destroyed , although in this case a finite , sufficiently large perturbation is required .",
    "in fact , this case provides a better setup for a numerical analysis of the instability , as we can control the form of the initial perturbation and then observe how it destroys the flow that was stable before the perturbation was applied .",
    "we made such an experiment with the flow with @xmath81 and @xmath163 .",
    "we applied a perturbation that was localized in space and time  a small `` kick '' @xmath171 was given to all particles located in a small region @xmath172 ; in this experiment @xmath171 had a gaussian distribution with the mean value and dispersion equal to 0.02 .",
    "we observed the following evolution .",
    "as the localized perturbation moved along with the background flow , it was greatly amplified when it reached the potential maximum ( which corresponds to the minimum @xmath173 of the steady - state solution , see figure  [ fig : alpha0.8cold ] ) , and some particles acquired a negative momentum , i.e. reversed their direction of motion .",

    "the trapped / backflowing particles have a deteriorating effect on the steady state because they are not advected away with the flow and instead repeatedly approach the same potential peaks , amplifying the perturbations .",

    "the average charge density ( averaged over oscillations ) is nearly equal to @xmath2 and the average velocity @xmath196 is nearly equal to @xmath27 , so that the condition @xmath197 is satisfied .",

    "we randomly chose 1000 particles between @xmath36 and @xmath203 and the figure shows their locations in the two - dimensional phase space @xmath92 .",
    "the simulation demonstrates the following :    \\(1 ) there is no high - energy tail in the momentum distribution .",
    "\\(2 ) at each @xmath32 , the momentum distribution has a pronounced narrow peak at @xmath204 .",
    "thus , a large fraction of particles form a cold stream ; this fraction is approximately equal to @xmath13 ( see below ) .",
    "the momentum of the cold stream @xmath204 is above ( but comparable to ) @xmath84 predicted by the steady - state model .",
    "\\(3 ) there is a low - energy wing in the momentum distribution which extends to negative momenta .",
    "this broad component of the particle distribution has a hydrodynamic velocity close to zero ; these particles are `` trapped '' and do not contribute much to the current density ; however they make a significant contribution to charge density . in our sample model ,",
    "about 20% of particles reside in the broad trapped component , and this fact has a simple explanation .",
    "from the point of view of the cold stream dynamics , the broad component provides a background that offsets the effect of vacuum charge density @xmath2 by the fraction of 20% .",
    "this fraction approximately equals to @xmath205 , so that the other particles ( fraction @xmath206 ) may move in the cold stream with @xmath207 and carry @xmath31 without the mismatch in charge density that would generate strong @xmath8 .",
    "in essence , the broad component with backflowing particles allows the plasma to self - organize so that the cold stream can keep @xmath207 .",
    "this is in contrast to the steady - state solution in  2 where all particles formed a stream with a positive velocity @xmath208 , which must be periodically decelerated and accelerated .",
    "\\(4 ) the cold stream momentum @xmath204 fluctuates in time ( the corresponding curve in figure  [ fig : phasetraj ] moves in time ) .",
    "however , the qualitative form of the phase - space distribution remains similar to that in figure  [ fig : phasetraj ] .",
    "as seen in figure  [ fig : phasetraj]a , the flow momentum @xmath204 decreases near the outer boundary of the computational box @xmath132 .",
    "this is an artifact of the boundary condition ( free escape with no backflow ) , which suppresses the density of backflowing particles near the boundary . as a result",
    ", a modest negative electric field is induced near the boundary , decreasing @xmath204 so that the flow carries the required electric current @xmath31 . for comparison ,",
    "figure  [ fig : phasetraj]b shows a random snapshot of a similar model ( in the same interval @xmath209 ) that has twice as large computational box , @xmath210 .",
    "as we increase @xmath131 , the boundary effect moves away to larger @xmath32 , affecting the flow properties only at @xmath211 .",
    "the flow structure inside the box ( away from the boundary ) does not depend on @xmath131 .    to check",
    "whether the flow momentum depends on the size of the computational box , we ran several simulations with the same @xmath212 and different box sizes @xmath131 .",
    "in each simulation , we measured the fluid momentum @xmath213 in the center of the box ( using a bin @xmath214 ) at time @xmath215 .",
    "the results are shown in figure [ fig : zetacompare ] .",
    "there is no systematic variation in @xmath213 with the box size ; the small variations ( @xmath216% ) are consistent with the fluctuations of @xmath213 in time for each model",
    ". does not correspond to the average velocity @xmath196 shown in figure  [ fig : meanvelocity ] , in the sense that @xmath217 , because of the broad low - energy tail of the distribution function .",
    "compared with @xmath196 , the calculation of @xmath213 gives a higher weight to fast particles due to the additional factor @xmath218 in @xmath219 .",
    "the average velocity remains close to @xmath27 , and the averaged momentum is larger than @xmath220 . ]",
    "the polar - cap flows in pulsars extend through altitudes @xmath32 much larger than our box size @xmath131 . the fact that our results are independent of @xmath131 confirm the expected behavior",
    " the plasma keeps oscillating and particle acceleration is quenched everywhere as long as the flow satisfies the condition @xmath3 .",
    "we observe a quasi - uniform and quasi - steady behavior in the computational box ( apart from the initial acceleration region of length @xmath221 ) . in a realistic polar - cap flow ,",
    "each segment of length @xmath222 should behave like our computational box .",
    "we also ran simulations with varying @xmath223 .",
    "we ran models with @xmath224 ( realistically , @xmath225 should be even smaller , @xmath226 , where @xmath227 is the star radius ) .",
    "the results are similar to the case of @xmath228 .",
    "the maximum momentum remains comparable to that given by  ( [ eq : pmax ] ) as long as @xmath3 .",
    "if @xmath229 ( which is equivalent to @xmath230 for @xmath231 ) , the charge - separated flow puled out from the polar cap is made of ions .",
    "different ion species may end up in such a flow , and they will be accelerated to different velocities .",
    "the mixed ion flow shares many features with the identical - particle model studied in the previous sections .",
    "steady state solutions can be obtained using the method described in  2 .",
    "ions with different masses and charges move with different hydrodynamical momenta and co - exist in a common , periodic electrostatic potential .",
    "this steady solution is prone to kinetic instability similar to that described in sections  2 and 4 .",
    "there is , however , an important new feature : the ion streams with different hydrodynamical momenta are prone to two - stream instability .    to study the behavior of the mixed ion flow we slightly change the setup of our numerical simulation .",
    "consider , e.g. , a mixture of protons and helium nuclei ( alpha - particles ) .",
    "the particle injection at @xmath36 now consists of two ions species ; they have charges @xmath232 and @xmath233 , and masses @xmath234 and @xmath235 . the two species are injected with equal rates @xmath236 .",
    "then alpha - particles carry electric current @xmath237 that is two times larger than the proton current @xmath238 .",
    "thus , @xmath239 and @xmath240 are maintained at the boundary .    to define a characteristic plasma skin depth @xmath59 we use  ( [ eq : lambda ] ) where we replace @xmath241 by @xmath242 or , equivalently , by @xmath243 (",
    "note that @xmath244 ) .",
    "the characteristic plasma frequency is defined by @xmath245 .",
    "figure  7 shows a snapshot of the phase - space distribution of ions long after the beginning of the simulation . in this sample model @xmath246 .",
    "the modest value of @xmath13 ( not close to unity ) implies modest lorentz factors of particles and the fast development of instabilities .",
    "the flow exhibits the following features :    \\(1 ) one period of the steady state solution is reproduced near the injection boundary @xmath36 .",
    "the period @xmath247 agrees with the result from numerical integration of the corresponding steady state model .",
    "( this feature is stable in our sample model because we chose a high injection velocity @xmath248 . )",
    "\\(2 ) at larger @xmath32 the periodic flow becomes unstable and develops into a configuration similar to that in figure  5 , except that now we have _ two _ cold variable streams .",
    "besides the cold streams , there is a broad distribution of ions with smaller momenta and a negligible hydrodynamic velocity .",
    "the origin of this broad component of trapped particles was discussed in  4.2 and plays here a similar role  it is self - organized so that the streams may move with a relativistic speed without a mismatch in charge density .",
    "\\(3 ) further from the boundary ( at @xmath249 ) , the two streams develop a two - stream instability .",
    "the growth rate of the instability may be estimated using an idealized model of two cold fluids with densities @xmath250 , @xmath251 and velocities @xmath252 .",
    "it is straightforward to derive the dispersion relation for langmuir modes with frequency @xmath253 and wave - vector @xmath254 ( e.g. melrose 1986 ) ; it gives , @xmath255 where @xmath256 and @xmath257 .",
    "using @xmath258 and the characteristic values of velocities @xmath252 from our simulation , we find from  ( [ eq : disp ] ) that the most unstable modes have @xmath253 comparable to @xmath60 and their growth rate is @xmath259 . in the simulation",
    "we observe a slightly smaller @xmath260 .",
    "the distance over which the langmuir waves are amplified is roughly @xmath261 . as a result of the instability ,",
    "the two streams are smeared out at large @xmath32 , in particular the stream of lighter ions .",
    "no significant particle acceleration is seen in the simulation .",
    "we have presented detailed one - dimensional time - dependent simulations of the plasma flow extracted from the polar caps of neutron stars .",
    "the simulations provide a fully kinetic description of the flow , with self - consistent electric field and particle distribution function . in this paper",
    ", we focused on the regime @xmath3 , where @xmath13 is the main parameter of the flow defined by ( [ eq : alpha ] ) . in agreement with the estimates of b08",
    ", we find that the particles are accelerated to lorentz factors , [ eq : gam2 ] , and are not capable of igniting pair creation . in this sense , flows with @xmath3 are `` dead . ''",
    "they are sustained by a modest voltage , oscillating in space and time .",
    "although the simulation is limited to regions close to the pulsar surface , the result does not depend on the simulation box size , and hence should describe the entire polar cap flow , as long as @xmath13 remains between @xmath262 and @xmath263 .",
    "the parameter @xmath13 is expected to vary along the magnetic field lines , on a scale comparable to the stellar radius ; we have verified that this variation does not change the oscillating behavior of the flow ( see also b08 ) .",
    "the simulations show how a kinetic instability develops and disrupts the ideal periodic structure found in the analytical models of the dead zone ; the instability mechanism is described in  2 and 4 .",
    "we find that the momentum distribution function has two distinct parts  a variable `` cold stream '' and a broad wing at low momenta , which includes particles flowing backward to the polar cap .",
    "the fraction of particles in the cold stream is approximately equal to @xmath13 ; the remaining fraction @xmath205 forms the broad component . even though the flow is turbulent , it shows no signs of particle acceleration to energies higher than that of the cold stream .",
    "the value of parameter @xmath13 depends on the location and geometry of the polar cap .",
    "a simplest magnetospheric configuration is that of a centered dipole .",
    "then the parameter @xmath13 depends on the angle between the magnetic and spin axes , @xmath264 ; besides , it varies across the polar cap . for nearly aligned rotators ( @xmath265 ) , @xmath3 in the central part of the polar cap and @xmath266 in a ring - shaped zone near the edge of the polar cap ( timokhin 2006 ; parfrey et al .",
    "2012 ) . in this case",
    ", the dead zone occupies the central part of the polar cap , and @xmath267 discharge must be confined to the ring , matching the phenomenological `` hollow cone '' model of pulsar emission .",
    "in contrast , the polar cap of an orthogonal rotator ( @xmath268 ) has @xmath269 , which enables @xmath267 discharge for the entire polar cap . at arbitrary misalignment @xmath270 ,",
    "the values of @xmath13 are provided by global three - dimensional simulations of the magnetospheric structure ( e.g. spitkovsky 2006 ) and should play a key role for the geometry of the radio beam .",
    "we presented our results using plasma skin depth @xmath59 as a unit of length and particle rest - mass @xmath271 as a unit of energy . in this form ,",
    "the results do not depend on the charge or mass of the particles extracted from the polar cap , as long as the flow is made of identical particles .",
    "in particular ,  ( [ eq : gam2 ] ) is valid for both electron flow ( @xmath272 ) and ion flow ( @xmath230 ) , and the phase - space distribution shown in figure  5 describes both cases .",
    "note that the accelerating voltage is proportional to the particle mass ; voltage implied by  ( [ eq : gam2 ] ) is different for ions and electrons by the factor of @xmath273 . the relatively high voltage in the ion flow",
    ", @xmath274 is still hardly sufficient to ignite @xmath267 pair discharge by a seed electron or positron .",
    "the identical - particle model may not hold for an ion flow ; in this case , new effects may enter the problem .",
    "firstly , heavy ions pulled out from the polar cap may not be completely ionized and begin to lose electrons as they are accelerated and interact with the x - rays above the stellar surface ; this process effectively creates new charges , reminiscent of pair creation ( e.g. jones 2012 ) .",
    "secondly , the ion flow may be a mixture of different nuclei which will be accelerated to different lorentz factors .",
    "the mixed ion flow is prone to two - stream instability , possibly leading to formation of plasma clumps and generation of coherent radio emission . in our simulations",
    ", we observe the expected two - stream instability , however do not observe significant structure ( clumps ) in the turbulent flow .",
    "this may change in three - dimensional simulations .",
    "the frequency of excited waves ( comparable to the ion plasma frequency ) is in the radio band , and coherent emission from clumps could create bright coherent emission . it remains to be seen whether this mechanism can contribute to the pulsar emission .",
    "if it does , it would create an additional component of the radio pulse . in the case of approximately aligned rotator ,",
    "the additional component would be generated in the central region of the polar cap , leading to a `` hollow cone + core '' structure of the radio pulse .",
    "the charge - separated model of the dead zone can be modified to include possible backflowing particles from distant parts of the open field - line bundle ( e.g. from a pair - producing outer gap ) .",
    "these particles can contribute to the current density and also serve as an additional background charge density , which may be modeled as a contribution to the effective `` vacuum '' charge density @xmath41 .",
    "this would change the effective @xmath13 ( lyubarsky 1992 ; b08 ) , most likely reducing it .",
    "an outer gap is expected to form in a charge - separated flow near the null surface @xmath275 ( cheng et al .",
    "1986 ) . on a given field line",
    ", the outer gap will be screened if it is loaded by multiple @xmath267 pairs produced by the discharge at the polar cap .",
    "thus , the suppression of @xmath267 discharge near the field - line footpoint is an essential condition for the existence of an outer - gap accelerator .",
    "therefore , one can expect an outer gap to form on field lines with footpoints in the dead zone .",
    "we did not simulate in this paper flows with @xmath276 or @xmath266 ; in these cases particles must be strongly accelerated .",
    "this regime leads to @xmath267 discharge that must be unsteady , with a significant intermittent backflow ( b08 ) . a model for oscillating discharge",
    "may be constructed in hydrodynamical approximation ( levinson et al . 2005 ) , however a fully kinetic description is essential , as demonstrated by our results for the dead zone , where a significant fraction of particles are trapped and form a broad wing at low momenta in the distribution function .",
    "the discharge simulation can be done using our setup of a fixed current @xmath21 at the stellar surface ( bt07 ) and incorporating pair creation .",
    "we defer the simulations with @xmath276 and @xmath266 to a future work .",
    "when this work was completed , the preprint by timokhin & arons ( 2012 ) came out .",
    "they present simulations of charge separated flows , using a similar method , and the results agree with our results for @xmath3 .",
    "they also consider flows with @xmath266 and @xmath276 , and find a strong unsteady @xmath267 discharge confirming the analysis in b08 ."
