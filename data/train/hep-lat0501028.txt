    "dynamical chiral symmetry breaking in qcd gives rise to an octet of light mesons recognized as the ( pseudo ) goldstone bosons of the symmetry .",
    "these light mesons couple strongly and give rise to a quark - mass dependence of hadron observables which is nonanalytic in the quark mass .",
    "the adelaide group has played a leading role in emphasizing the role of this physics in the chiral extrapolation of lattice simulation results @xcite .",
    "most work in the baryon sector has focused on the nucleon and delta masses and the magnetic moments of octet baryons .",
    "the established , model - independent approach to chiral effective field theory is that of power counting , the foundation of chiral perturbation theory ( @xmath1pt ) .",
    "however , this requires one to work in a regime of pion mass where the next term in the truncated series expansion makes a contribution that is negligible .",
    "given the emphasis on determining the nucleon mass to 1% , such neglected contributions must be constrained to the fraction of a percent level . as there is no attempt to model the higher - order terms of the chiral expansion ,",
    "one simply obtains the wrong answer if one works outside this region .    there is now growing recognition that some form of resummation of the chiral expansion is necessary in order to make contact with lattice simulation results of full qcd , where the effects of dynamical fermions are incorporated .",
    "as we will demonstrate in the following , the quark masses accessible with today s algorithms and supercomputers lie well outside the regime of @xmath1pt  in its standard form .",
    "this situation is unlikely to change significantly until it becomes possible to directly simulate qcd on the lattice within twice the squared physical mass of the pion and with suitably large lattice volumes . within this range , knowledge of the first few terms of",
    "the chiral expansion would be sufficient as higher - order terms of the expansion are small simply because @xmath2 is small .",
    "straightforward application of the truncated expansion of @xmath1pt  would then be possible .",
    "however , one might wonder if the lattice techniques that would allow simulations at light masses within @xmath3 , might also allow a calculation directly at the physical pion mass , obliterating the chiral extrapolation problem altogether .",
    "unfortunately such simulations are not possible in the foreseeable future , and one must resort to more advanced techniques .",
    "the resummation of the chiral expansion induced through the introduction of a finite - range cutoff in the momentum - integrals of meson - loop diagrams is perhaps the best known resummation method @xcite  for alternative proposals , see also refs .",
    "however , there are many ways of regularizing the loop integrals which lead to a resummation of the expansion . for example",
    ", relativistic formulations lead to expressions for the nucleon self - energy which include higher - order nonanalytic terms beyond the order one is calculating @xcite . in some cases ,",
    "the expressions have the desirable property of becoming smooth and slowly varying as the pion mass becomes moderately large @xcite . indeed all observables calculated on the lattice display a smooth slowly - varying dependence on the quark mass , presenting a clear signal that higher order terms of the chiral expansion sum to zero as the pion mass becomes moderately large .",
    "the ability to draw a curve through the lightest nucleon mass points has led some to argue that it is essential to adopt a relativistic approach in calculating the chiral expansion @xcite . however , one might have some concern that a relativistic expression is so important in what is supposed to be a _",
    "low - energy _ effective field theory .",
    "indeed , a taylor expansion of the relativistic expression produces exactly the same leading - nonanalytic ( lna ) term as obtained in the heavy - baryon formulation of chiral perturbation theory ( hb@xmath1pt ) . upon including the delta in hb@xmath1pt  the next - to - leading nonanalytic ( nlna ) structure ,",
    "@xmath4 is also obtained .    in the relativistic formulation ,",
    "an @xmath5 correction is also generated at one - loop order .",
    "however , the rapid convergence of the taylor series generated by the full relativistic loop calculation @xcite emphasizes that the relativistic corrections are small .",
    "one should not assume that the higher - order terms of the heavy - baryon expansion are included completely .",
    "rather a particular resummation of the chiral expansion has been obtained which allows the self - energy of the nucleon to evolve slowly as the pion mass grows , thus mimicking the lattice simulation results .",
    "perhaps the most astonishing discovery in frr chiral effective field theory , is that the term - by - term details of the higher - order chiral expansion are largely irrelevant in describing the chiral extrapolation of simulation results .",
    "figure  [ frr ] displays the extrapolation @xcite of lattice simulation results of full qcd from the cp - pacs collaboration @xcite .",
    "a variety of finite - range regularizations are illustrated , including dipole , monopole , gaussian and theta - function regulators , as described in greater detail below .",
    "frr chiral effective field theory is mathematically equivalent to @xmath1pt  to any finite order and in this case we work to order @xmath6 .",
    "the curves are indistinguishable and produce physical nucleon masses which differ by less than 0.1% .",
    "this is despite the fact that the coefficients of the higher - order terms ( @xmath5 and beyond ) appearing in the frr expressions differ significantly .",
    "for example , the coefficient of the @xmath5 term vanishes for the theta - function regulator , whereas the monopole , dipole and gaussian regulators provide @xmath7 , @xmath8 and @xmath9 respectively .",
    "what these expansions do have in common is that the loop - integrals vanish as the quark masses grow large .",
    "the contribution of any individual higher - order term is largely irrelevant .",
    "the only thing that really counts is that there are other terms that enter to ensure the sum of all terms of the loop integral approaches zero , in accord with what is observed in lattice qcd calculations . of course",
    ", this beautiful feature of frr expansions would be lost if one were to truncate the expansion at any finite order .",
    "resummation of chiral effective field theory is essential to solving the chiral extrapolation problem .    in each of the aforementioned regulators",
    ", there is a single parameter governing the range of the loop - momentum cutoff .",
    "it is a parameter which does not appear in standard chiral perturbation theory and as outlined in detail below it plays no role in the terms of the frr expansion to the order one is working .",
    "however , it does play a role in determining the coefficients of the higher - order terms , beyond that order . as discussed in detail in ref .",
    "@xcite , it governs the convergence properties of the chiral expansion .",
    "given the level of agreement between the curves associated with different regulators , it is sufficient to parameterize the remainder of the chiral expansion in terms of this single parameter , @xmath10 , and still maintain fraction of a percent accuracy .",
    "it is essential that @xmath10 remain finite . in the limit @xmath11 one",
    "recovers the standard chiral expansion of @xmath1pttruncated at the next nonanalytic term beyond the order one is working , spoiling the resummation of the expansion .",
    "@xmath10 must be constrained to values that ensure that the loop - momenta contributing to loop integrals are relevant to the low - energy effective field theory .",
    "indeed it is the erroneous contributions from large loop - momenta beyond the realm of the low - energy effective field theory that spoils the convergence properties of traditional @xmath1pt@xcite .",
    "the difficulty with this approach is that the exact value of @xmath10 is not specified . because one must work to finite order in the expansion",
    ", there is a residual dependence on @xmath10 .",
    "the common approach is to vary @xmath10 over reasonable values and include the observed variation in the final uncertainty estimate .",
    "in the usual formulation of effective field theory , the nucleon mass as a function of the pion mass ( given that @xmath12 ) has the formal expansion : @xmath13 in practice , for current applications to lattice qcd , the parameters , @xmath14 , should be determined by fitting to the lattice results themselves .",
    "the additional terms , @xmath15 , @xmath16 and @xmath17 , are loop corrections involving the ( goldstone ) pion .",
    "as these terms involve the coupling constants in the chiral limit , which are essentially model - independent @xcite , the only additional complication they add is that the ultra - violet behavior of the loop integrals must be regulated in some way .",
    "traditionally , one uses dimensional regularization which ( after infinite renormalization of @xmath18 and @xmath19 ) leaves only the non - analytic terms  @xmath20 and @xmath21 , respectively . within dimensional regularization one then arrives at a truncated power series for the chiral expansion .",
    "to fourth order @xmath22 where the bare parameters , @xmath14 , have been replaced by the finite , renormalized coefficients , @xmath23 . through the chiral logarithm one has an additional mass scale , @xmath24 , but the dependence on this is eliminated by matching @xmath25 to `` data '' ( in this case lattice qcd ) .",
    "the prime on @xmath26 denotes that this term is beyond the order to which we are working , and therefore should not be expected to be independent of regularization .    in line with the implicit @xmath24-dependence of the coefficients in the familiar dimensionally regulated @xmath1pt ,",
    "the systematic frr expansion of the nucleon mass is : @xmath27 where the dependence on the _ shape _ of the regulator is implicit .",
    "the dependence on the value of @xmath10 and the choice of regulator is eliminated , to the order of the series expansion , by fitting the coefficients , @xmath28 , to lattice qcd data .    to illustrate how the @xmath10-dependence of the chiral expansion is removed to",
    "the order one is working , we review the renormalization procedure . to leading one - loop order @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the lna coefficient of the nucleon mass expansion",
    ", @xmath31 and @xmath32 denotes the relevant loop integral . in the heavy baryon limit , this integral over pion momentum is given by @xmath33 this integral suffers from a cubic divergence for large momentum .",
    "the infrared behavior of this integral gives the leading nonanalytic correction to the nucleon mass .",
    "this arises from the pole in the pion propagator at complex momentum @xmath34 and will be determined independent of how the ultraviolet behavior of the integral is treated . rearranging eq .",
    "( [ eq : inpi ] ) we see that the pole contribution can be isolated from the divergent part @xmath35 the final term converges and is given simply by @xmath36 where we now recognize the choice of normalization of the loop integral , defined such that the coefficient of the lna term is set to unity .",
    "this choice is purely convention and allows for a much more transparent presentation of the differences in the chiral expansion with various regularization schemes .    in the most basic form of renormalization",
    "we could simply imagine absorbing the infinite contributions arising from the first term in eq .",
    "( [ eq : ipipole ] ) into a redefinition of the coefficients @xmath18 and @xmath19 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : mnlead ] ) .",
    "this solution is simply a minimal subtraction scheme and the renormalized expansion can be given without making reference to an explicit scale , @xmath37 with the renormalized coefficients defined by @xmath38 equation  ( [ eq : msrenlna ] ) therefore encodes the complete quark mass expansion of the nucleon mass to @xmath39 .",
    "this result will be precisely equivalent to any form of minimal subtraction scheme , where all the ultraviolet behavior is absorbed into the two leading coefficients of the expansion .",
    "such a minimal subtraction scheme is characteristic of the commonly implemented dimensional regularization .",
    "this formulation has implied that the description of the pion - cloud effects are equally well described at all momentum scales . as we know that chiral effective field theory is only valid in the low momentum regime ,",
    "a minimal subtraction scheme will describe high momentum pion modes which have no connection with physical reality .",
    "this incorrect short - distance physics must be removed through the analytic terms of the expansion , spoiling the convergence of the expansion @xcite .",
    "the pion - nucleon system in the real world is characterized by a momentum scale associated with the size of the pion - cloud source .",
    "the axial form factor of the nucleon provides a radius of @xmath40 @xcite , suggesting that the characteristic scale is of order @xmath41@xmath42 .",
    "hence one should expect an improvement in the convergence properties of the chiral expansion upon implementing a regularization which suppresses the ultraviolet behavior of the loop integral .",
    "we refer to any such scheme as finite - range regularization ( frr ) .",
    "it should be noted that a minimal subtraction scheme does offer the advantage that all finite energy scales beyond the pseudo - goldstone boson mass are integrated out .",
    "the finite size of the nucleon will therefore emerge as the nucleon is dressed by higher order pion cloud dressing .",
    "the cost of removing the explicit dependence on this physical energy scale is that the expansion will therefore only be reliable for pion masses below this characteristic scale @xmath43@xmath42 .",
    "we now describe the chiral expansion within finite - range regularization , where the cut - off scale remains explicit .",
    "in particular , we highlight the mathematical equivalence of frr and dimensional regularization in the low energy regime .",
    "we introduce a functional cutoff , @xmath44 , defined such that the loop integral is ultraviolet finite , @xmath45 to preserve the infrared behavior of the loop integral , the regulator is defined to be unity as @xmath46 . for demonstrative purposes , we choose a dipole regulator @xmath47 , giving @xmath48 the first few terms of the taylor series expansion , as shown , provide the relevant renormalisation of the low - energy terms .",
    "the renormalized expansion in frr is therefore precisely equivalent to eq .",
    "( [ eq : msrenlna ] ) up to @xmath39 where the leading renormalized coefficients are given by @xmath49 as @xmath18 and @xmath19 are fit parameters , the value @xmath10 takes is irrelevant and plays no role in the expansion to the order one is working ; in this case @xmath50 . retaining the full form of eq .",
    "( [ eq : inpidip ] ) will therefore build in a resummation of higher - order terms in the chiral series .",
    "it is straight forward to extend this procedure to next - to - leading nonanalytic order , explicitly including all terms up to @xmath51 .",
    "most importantly , there are nonanalytic contributions of order @xmath4 arising from the @xmath52-baryon and tadpole loop contributions .",
    "the latter arises from the expansion of the @xmath53 chiral lagrangian , with a coupling proportional to the renormalized @xmath54 expansion coefficient , @xmath55 . in the heavy baryon limit @xmath56 @xmath57 where @xmath58 and @xmath59 mev is the physical @xmath52-@xmath60 mass splitting .",
    "the finite - range regulator @xmath44 is taken to be either a sharp theta - function cut - off , a dipole , a monopole or finally a gaussian .",
    "these regulators have very different shapes , with the only common feature being that they suppress the integrand for momenta greater than @xmath10 .",

    "@xmath61 is a local counter term introduced in frr to ensure a linear relation for the renormalization of @xmath55 .",
    "this approach provides a relatively simple way to ensure that the coefficient of the tadpole diagram contribution is proportional to the renormalized coefficient , @xmath55 , as opposed to a combination of unrenormalized coefficients as done in ref .",
    "nonanalytic terms of the chiral expansion must have renormalized coefficients in order to recover the standard expansion of @xmath1ptupon taking the finite - range regulator parameter to infinity .",
    "the key feature of finite - range regularization is the presence of an additional adjustable regulator parameter which provides an opportunity to suppress short distance physics from the loop integrals of effective field theory . as emphasized in eq .",
    "( [ eq : finite ] ) by the superscripts @xmath10 , the unrenormalized coefficients of the analytic terms of the frr expansion are regulator - parameter dependent .",
    "however , the large @xmath2 behavior of the loop integrals and the residual expansion ( the sum of the @xmath63 terms ) are remarkably different . whereas the residual expansion will encounter a power divergence",
    ", the frr loop integrals will tend to zero as a power of @xmath64 , as @xmath2 becomes large .",
    "thus , @xmath10 provides an opportunity to govern the convergence properties of the residual expansion and thus the frr chiral expansion .",
    "since hadron masses are observed to be smooth , almost linear functions of @xmath65 for quark masses near and beyond the strange quark mass , it should be possible to find values for the regulator - range parameter , @xmath10 , such that the coefficients @xmath66 and higher are truly small . in this case",
