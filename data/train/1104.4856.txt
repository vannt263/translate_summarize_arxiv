    "nikulov introduces a ' ' quantum force `` to explain the little - parks effect in superconductors and proposes that it also explains the meissner effect)''_. i would like in this paper to define more exactly the essence of the azimuthal quantum force introduced ten years ago @xcite .",
    "this quantum force can not explain the meissner effect .",
    "moreover the utilization of the quantum force in @xcite does not overstep the limits of the universally recognised quantum formalism and it can rather describe than explain quantum phenomena as well as quantum mechanics in whole .",
    "the meissner effect is considered as a particular case of quantization in the universally recognised description . according to the ginzburg - landau theory @xcite superconducting state",
    "can be described with help of the gl wave function @xmath0 , in which @xmath1 is interpreted as the density of superconducting pairs and @xmath2 is momentum of single pair with the mass @xmath3 and the charge @xmath4 .",
    "superconducting current density is @xmath5 according to the gl theory , when the pair density is constant in the superconductor @xmath6 @xcite .",
    "the quantization can be deduced from the requirement that the complex wave function must be single - valued @xmath7 at any point in superconductor @xcite .",
    "therefore , its phase must change by integral multiples of @xmath8 following a complete turn along the path of integration , yielding the bohr - sommerfeld quantization @xmath9 according to the relations ( 1 ) , ( 2 ) and @xmath10 the integral of the current density along any closed path inside superconductor @xmath11 must be connected with the integral quantum number @xmath12 and the magnetic flux @xmath13 inside the closed path @xmath14 .",
    "@xmath15 is the london penetration depth ; @xmath16 for most superconductors",
    "@xcite ; @xmath17 is the flux quantum .",
    "the relation ( 3 ) can describe the meissner effect @xcite , the magnetic flux quantization observed first in 1961 @xcite and the quantum periodicity in different parameters of superconducting cylinder or ring with narrow wall @xmath18 . according to the quantization relation ( 3 ) ,",
    "the persistent current @xcite @xmath19 must flow along the narrow wall @xmath18 of cylinder or ring with a radius @xmath20 , section @xmath21 and pair density @xmath22 along the whole circumference @xmath14 , when magnetic flux inside the cylinder or ring @xmath23 is not divisible the flux quantum @xmath24 . here",

    "the quantum periodicity is observed because of the change with magnetic flux value @xmath13 of the integer quantum number @xmath12 corresponding to the minimal energy @xmath31 .",
    "this phenomenon was observed first as far back as 1962 by w. a. little and r. d. parks @xcite at measurements of the resistance of thin cylinder in the temperature region corresponding to its superconducting resistive transition .",
    "later on , the quantum oscillations of the ring resistance @xmath32 @xcite , its magnetic susceptibility @xmath33 @xcite , the critical current @xmath34 @xcite and the dc voltage @xmath35 measured on segments of asymmetric rings @xcite were observed .    the magnetic flux quantization is observed @xcite in superconducting cylinder or ring with wide wall @xmath36 .",
    "the magnetic flux should have the discrete values @xmath37 according to ( 3 ) because of zero current density @xmath38 along a circuit @xmath14 inside the wide wall .",
    "the path of integration @xmath14 in ( 2 ) and ( 3 ) can be tightened in point without the quantum number @xmath12 change if the wave function is valid in whole region inside it .",
    "therefore the meissner effect @xmath39 can be describe as a consequence of the requirement that the quantum number @xmath40 in ( 2 ) and ( 3 ) only if the wave function @xmath0 has a singularity inside @xmath14 , i.e. there is a non - superconducting region .",

    "numerous observations of the abrikosov state @xcite corroborate the relation @xmath37 between the magnetic flux @xmath13 and the number @xmath12 of the abrikosov vortices inside a macroscopic circuit @xmath14 and thus , the long - rang phase coherence ( 2 ) .",
    "there is important to accentuate that the quantum number @xmath12 is connected definitely ( 3 ) with measurable variables , for example , the persistent current @xmath43 and the magnetic flux @xmath23 inside a narrow wall ring ( 4 ) , when the path of integration @xmath14 in ( 2 ) can be closed , i.e. when the phase coherence is valid along the whole ring circuit . according to the quantization condition ( 3 ) the persistent current @xmath44 ( 4 ) and",
    "the pair velocity @xmath45 should increase with the @xmath13 value until the change of the quantum number @xmath46 .",
    "the @xmath12 change means the jump of the persistent current on the value @xmath47 ( 4 ) , of the pair velocity on @xmath48 and the angular momentum @xmath49 of each pair on the planck constant @xmath50 ( 2 ) .",
    "these jumps , fig.1 , observed at the measurements of the ring magnetization @xmath51 below superconducting transition @xmath52 @xcite can be described as a consequence of the transition in the normal state with @xmath53 , @xmath54 at least of one ring segment @xmath55 , fig.2 .",
    "the electric current circulating in the ring with non - zero resistance @xmath56 should decrease @xmath57 from @xmath58 to @xmath59 at the quantum number change from @xmath60 to @xmath41 , fig.1 , during very short time @xmath61 equal in order of value the relaxation time @xmath62 .",

    "here @xmath66 is the number of superconducting pairs in the homogeneous state of the ring , when @xmath29 and @xmath30 does not change along @xmath14 .",
    "the change on the macroscopic value @xmath67 takes place under the influence of the real forces : the dissipation force @xmath68 acting on electrons in the normal @xmath55 segment induces a potential difference @xmath69 the electric field @xmath70 of which maintains @xmath71 the current @xmath72 of normal electrons in this segment at the force balance @xmath73 and brakes @xmath74 superconducting pairs in the superconducting segment @xmath75 in accordance with the newton s second law @xmath76 .",

    "this @xmath85 value corresponds to the macroscopic magnetic moment @xmath86 and angular momentum @xmath87 of @xmath88 pairs in the ring , where @xmath89 is the bohr s magneton and @xmath90 is the reduced planck constant . ]",

    "for example , the questions : \" why and how quickly can the velocity of pairs in a segment @xmath99 change from @xmath100 to @xmath101 after the transition of the @xmath55 segment into the superconducting state @xmath96 . ]    there is important to note that the decrease of the pair density @xmath102 in a ring segment down to zero is qualitative transition from discrete to continuous spectrum of superconducting ring states , fig.2 .",
    "the persistent current @xmath103 ( 4 ) increases the energy of superconducting state of a ring on the kinetic energy @xmath104 of pairs .",
    "this increase ( 5 ) is considered as the cause of the little - parks effect @xcite .",
    "the spectrum of the permitted states ( 5 ) is strongly discrete @xmath105 thanks to the enormous number @xmath106 of pairs in a real superconducting ring , see , for example , the caption of fig.1 .",
    "the energy difference between permitted states @xmath107 ( 5 ) at the real amplitude @xmath108 of the persistent current of a real ring measured even near superconducting transition @xmath109 @xcite corresponds to the value @xmath110 exceeding strongly the temperature of measurements @xmath111 .",
    "the observations only single state @xmath12 at @xmath112 with the predominant probability @xmath113 , corresponding to the lowest energy @xmath31 , at almost all measurements @xcite corroborate the strong discreteness of the spectrum .",

    "thus , the @xmath12 change , fig.1 , observed at magnetization measurements @xcite should occur through transition between the superconducting states with different connectivity of the wave function , fig.2 .",
    "the fundamental difference between these states may be connected with the non - uniqueness of the vector potential @xmath120 : @xmath121 is the gauge - invariant quantity , but @xmath122 is not gauge - invariant , where @xmath123 is any continuously differentiable scalar function , for which @xmath124 .",
    "the difference between @xmath125 and @xmath126 and the relation for the canonical momentum @xmath127 is the essence of the famous aharonov - bohm effect @xcite .",
    "therefore the quantization phenomena observed in rings are considered @xcite as a case of the aharonov - bohm effect .",
    "the physical sense of the quantum number @xmath12 and the phase coherence ( 2 ) should re - establish when the @xmath55 segment will return into the superconducting state @xmath96 .",
    "the ring can return to the state with the same or other quantum number depending on the experiment conditions . at the magnetization measurements @xcite superconductivity can break down in a ring segment when",

    "the hysteresis is observed at the magnetization measurements of the rings with @xmath148 and the quantum number @xmath12 ( and consequently @xmath43 ( 4 ) ) may be different at the same @xmath149 value , depending on the history @xcite .",
    "only @xmath12 states , corresponding to the lowest energy ( 5 ) , is observed at each @xmath149 value inside a ring with @xmath148 when the ring or its segment is switched between superconducting and normal states with an external influence or thermal fluctuations .",
    "the external influence takes place , for example , at measurements of the critical current @xmath150 @xcite when the external current @xmath151 used for @xmath152 measuring switches at @xmath153 the ring in the normal state at each measurement , see fig.2,3 in @xcite .",
    "the thermal fluctuations can switch ring segments in a narrow region @xmath154 near superconducting transition @xmath155 where the difference of their energy in normal and superconducting states does not exceed strongly @xmath156 @xcite .",
    "@xmath157 is the width of the fluctuation region . without any external influence the spectrum ( 5 )",

    "therefore under equilibrium condition the persistent current @xmath165 is observed at non - zero resistance @xmath163 only in the fluctuation region @xcite .",

    "therefore both the persistent current and the resistance , measured on average in time , can be together non - zero @xmath165 at @xmath169 .",
    "the switching between superconducting states with different connectivity of the wave function , fig.2 , because of the thermal fluctuations explains @xcite the observations of the little - parks oscillations of the ring resistance @xmath170 @xcite and the oscillations of the magnetic susceptibility @xmath171 @xcite in the temperature region @xmath154 of the resistive transition where @xmath172 just because of the thermal fluctuations @xcite .",

    "the @xmath200 at @xmath163 is possible because of the prohibition ( 4 ) of the state with @xmath206 at @xmath24 when all ring segments are in superconducting state @xmath22 and @xmath207 .",

    "this demand as applied to the repeated closing of the wave function with a frequency @xmath190 gives the value @xmath210 of the angular momentum change in a time unity .",
    "the change of the pair momentum in a time unity @xmath211 because of the quantization ( 2 ) was called in @xcite quantum force .",
    "thus , the inference of the quantum force in @xcite do not overstep the limits of the universally recognised quantum formalism .",
    "hirsch argues @xcite _ `` that there is no physical basis for such an azimuthal force''_. i agree with this assertion if only the universally recognised quantum formalism can not be considered as a physical basis .",
    "the quantum formalism states , in full accordance with all experimental results , that the persistent current must appear at the closing of superconducting state in the ring , fig.2 , according to ( 4 ) and the angular momentum of each pair should change , according to ( 2 ) , if it was not equal the permitted value @xmath212 before the closing .",
    "the change @xmath213 of the angular momentum of each pair ( at @xmath100 before the closing ) must be because of the quantization demand ( 2 ) .",
    "although the quantum formalism can not explain how this change of macroscopic number @xmath214 of pairs can be possible without any force , all experimental results testify to this force - free angular momentum transfer .",
    "for example , the current @xmath43 , circulating in the ring , see fig.1 in @xcite , when the external current does not exceed the critical current @xmath215 , decays during a relaxation time @xmath216 after the transition into the normal state , see fig.2 in @xcite , at @xmath217 or @xmath218 .",
    "the average velocity of mobile charge carriers falls down to zero @xmath219 and the angular momentum of electron pair varies from @xmath212 to @xmath220 because of the dissipation force @xmath68 in accordance with the newton s second law @xmath221 . here the relaxation time may be written @xmath222 .",
    "the measurements of the critical current @xcite corroborate the demand ( 2 ) and ( 4 ) that the angular momentum and the persistent current must revert to the initial values when the @xmath223 decreases down to zero and the ring returns to superconducting state .",
    "the oscillations in magnetic field of the critical current @xmath224 , @xmath225 @xcite measured through the ring switching between superconducting and normal states are evidence that the persistent current is not zero in the superconducting state",

    "the dissipation force , equal on average in time @xmath231 , does not change the momentum of mobile charge carriers during a long time @xmath232 because the angular momentum must revert to the permitted value ( 2 ) at each return to the superconducting state at @xmath233 .",
    "the quantum force can provide formally the force balance @xmath234 at the description of this experiment .",
    "this description should show clearly that the correct statement by hirsch @xcite : _ `` an azimuthal quantum force acting on electrons only would change the total angular momentum of the system , violating the physical principle of angular momentum conservation '' _ can not concern the quantum force introduced in @xcite .",
    "this momentum change in a time unity ( 6 ) because of the quantization ( 2 ) can provide only formally the force balance ( 7 ) at the description of some experiments , like the one considered above , in which the dissipation force is not zero on average in time @xmath235 .",
    "the dissipation force acts between electrons and the crystalline lattice of ions . in order to provide the force balance ( 7 )",
    "we should believe that the change of the angular momentum of mobile charge carriers because of the quantization ( 2 ) is equilibrated with the same one of ions . without this balance implied in ( 7 ) it could be possible to have rotated a ring merely with help of its switching between superconducting and normal states at @xmath24 inside it .",
    "this possibility can be verified experimentally .",
    "i believe that the ring would not rotate , although this belief implies an additional obvious puzzle .",
    "the angular momentum of each superconducting pair should change from @xmath236 to @xmath212 although without a known force but , at least , because of the known cause - its quantization ( 2 ) .",
    "the angular momentum of ions should change even without this cause in order the ring could not rotate .",
    "hirsch remarks _ `` nikulov claims that this force explains the meissner effect as well as the little - parks effect '' _ @xcite .",
    "i hope it is enough clearly from the above that the quantum force introduced in my paper @xcite does not explain anything but only describes .",
    "it is used for description of the little - parks effect because thermal fluctuations switch ring segments between superconducting and normal states at @xmath177 , but it is useless for a description of the meissner effect . the azimuthal quantum force could be introduced for the description of an experiment when a bulk superconductor placed in a weak magnetic field is switched repeatedly with a frequency @xmath190 between superconducting and normal states .",
    "the dissipation force will change the angular momentum of mobile charge carriers after each transition into the normal state as well as in the case of the ring considered above .",
    "the quantum force @xmath237 , see ( 6 ) , may be introduced only in this case in order to provide nominally the force balance ( 7 ) on average in time .",
    "the angular momentum of each pair can change at the meissner effect from @xmath236 to @xmath238 on a macroscopic value @xmath239 in contrast to the case considered above when this change can not exceed the planck s constant @xmath240 irrespective of the ring radius @xmath20 and the magnetic flux @xmath241 value .",
    "for example , at the expulsion of a magnetic field @xmath242 from a superconducting cylinder with a radius @xmath243 and a height @xmath244 the angular momentum of each pair should change on @xmath245 and all @xmath246 pairs ( at a typical density @xmath247 ) on @xmath248 .",

    "in the case of the little - parks and other such effects @xcite the quantum force replaces the force @xmath249 of the faraday electric field @xmath250 in order to describe the persistent current @xmath165 observed at non - zero resistance @xmath169 on average in time .",

    "quantum mechanics describes these phenomena but it refuses to explain how a particle can make its way through two slits at the same time and how the magnetic moment of electron or atom can have the same value of projection on any direction .",
    "some other issues , which quantum mechanics refuses to address , are considered in the book @xcite .",
    "this refusal to search causes of quantum phenomena is based upon epistemological belief , known as instrumentalism or positivism , which explicitly denies any explanatory role of science . according to this point of view a physical theory",
    "should only provide a computational instrument for description and prediction of experimental results . concerning this epistemological problem",
    "the founding fathers of quantum theory can be divided into positivists , heisenberg , bohr , born , dirac , pauli and realists , planck , einstein , schrodinger , de broglie .",
    "the realists , for example einstein , stated that quantum mechanics can not be interpreted as the complete theory because of its repudiation of _ `` the programmatic aim of all physics : the complete description of any ( individual ) real situation ( as it supposedly exists irrespective of any act of observation or substantiation ) '' _ @xcite . the positivists , on the other hand , for example heisenberg , stated that _ `` any attempt to find such a description would lead to contradictions '' _ and therefore _",
    "`` the term happens is restricted to the observation '' _ @xcite .",
    "i would like to be among realists .",
    "but my azimuthal quantum force @xcite does not overstep the limits of the positivism of the orthodox quantum mechanics whereas hirsch @xcite attempts to explain what happens at the meissner effect .",
    "his explanation may seem strange .",
    "but the famous interpretation of the quantum theory in terms of hidden variables by david bohm @xcite and hidden variables model by john bell @xcite seem even more strange .",
    "the paradoxicality of some quantum phenomena rules out the possibility of no paradoxical explanation .",
    "the magnetic lorentz force acting on the radially outgoing charge , assumed by hirsch @xcite , seems to be only way to explain the meissner effect without challenge to the principle of angular momentum conservation .",
    "but this way can not be valid for an explanation of the angular momentum change @xmath279 at the closing of superconducting state in the ring , fig.2 , because of the obvious impossibility of an radial current .",
    "quantum mechanics predicts but can not explain also a real mechanical force which can act and be measured at mechanical closing of the superconducting loop at @xmath24 , see the end @xcite .",
    "an unprejudiced consideration of these and other puzzles generated by the orthodox quantum mechanics would clarify its essence .",
    "the outright refusal to raise some questions is debated from the very outset of quantum mechanics and up to now .",
    "the main point at issue may be connected with two puzzles of quantum phenomena : wave - particle duality and indeterminism .",
    "einstein , who introduced into the consideration both the wave - particle duality in 1905 @xcite and indeterminism in 1916 @xcite , understood in full measure the paradoxicality of these features .",
    "bohr remembers in @xcite picturesque phrase by einstein about _",
    "`` ghost waves ( gespensterfelder ) guiding the photons '' _ and einstein himself wrote in 1954 : _",
    "`` all these fifty years of conscious brooding have brought me no nearer to the answer to the question , what are light quanta? nowadays every tom , dick and harry thinks he knows it , but he is mistaken . '' _ einstein , as well as some other experts later on @xcite , could not accept the intrinsic inconsistency of the concept of light quanta , which he proposed : the photon with a energy @xmath280 and momentum @xmath281 is , on the one hand , the wave with the certain frequency @xmath282 and length @xmath283 which can not be localised , but on the other hand it must interact with a localised object , for example an atom .",
    "bohr wrote : _",
    "`` the acuteness of the dilemma is stressed by the fact that the interference effects offer our only means of defining the concepts of frequency and wavelength entering into the very expressions for the energy and momentum of the photon '' _ @xcite .",
    "the orthodox quantum mechanics describes this dilemma with help of the principle of states superposition or , equivalently , of the positivistic interpretation of the schrodinger wave function proposed by born .",
    "the superposition of states , considered @xcite as the cardinal positive principle of quantum mechanics , must imply its collapse at observation because of the logical impossibility to see anything in some states simultaneously .",
    "the concept of the collapse , introduced by von neumann as far back as 1932 @xcite , _ remains most puzzling and counterintuitive aspect of the interpretation of quantum mechanics _ @xcite .",
    "the well - known puzzles generated with this concept are revealed with two famous paradoxes , of `` schrodinger s cat '' @xcite and the epr paradox @xcite .",
    "the first puzzle indicates a fuzzy status of measurements in quantum mechanics criticised by john bell @xcite and discussed up to now @xcite .",
    "the epr paradox reveals , by the use of the most paradoxical quantum principle , the `` entanglement '' @xcite or the `` epr correlation '' @xcite , the contradiction of the concept of superposition and its collapse with local realism .",
    "this contradiction is one of the most discussed problems in the last years @xcite thanks to the famous bell s theorem @xcite which has showed that the epr paradox led to experimentally testable differences between quantum mechanics and local realistic theories .",
    "bell , as well as some other experts @xcite , interpret experimental evidence @xcite of violation of the famous bell s inequality as _ `` the real problem with quantum theory : the apparently essential conflict between any sharp formulation and fundamental relativity''_. because of this essential conflict revealed first by einstein as far back as 1927 @xcite the adherents of the orthodox quantum mechanics are forced to state that the wave function can describe only knowledge of the quantum system but not the system in itself , see @xcite , for example .",
    "the knowledge - information interpretation is enough natural for the positivistic interpretation of the schrodinger s wave function @xmath284 proposed by born . according to this interpretation @xmath285",
    "is a probability to observe a particle in an element of volume @xmath286 . before the observation",
    "the probability @xmath285 can have a finite value @xmath287 for all elements @xmath286 of a large volume because we can not know where the particle will be found .",
    "but after the observation the probability is @xmath288 in the one element , where the particle was observed , and @xmath289 for all others .",
    "the wave function @xmath284 , describing superposition of states before the observation , collapses after the observation because of the change of our knowledge .",
    "_ the collapse must take place instantaneously over all space _ @xcite , or rather it must be outside of the real physical time . this non - realistic interpretation seems to have no alternative for the description of some quantum phenomena , for example , the double - slit interference experiments @xcite .",
    "but it is obviously not valid for the description of superconductivity phenomena .",
    "the gl wave function @xmath0 describes quite real density of superconducting pairs in accordance with _ the programmatic aim of all physics _ @xcite upheld by einstein and other realists .",
    "the real density @xmath290 can not collapse at the act of observation and can not depend on our knowledge .",
    "the gl wave function @xmath0 can alter only because of a real physical influence , for example , a heating of the @xmath55 ring segment , fig.2 .",
    "because of this fundamental difference between the positivistic born s interpretation of the schrodinger s wave function and the realistic essence of the gl wave function , the puzzles revealed by hirsch @xcite and the quantum force @xcite differ basically from the puzzles revealed by schrodinger with his cat paradox @xcite , by einstein with the epr paradox @xcite , by bell @xcite with his no - hidden - variables theorems @xcite and by other adherents of realism @xcite .",
    "the realists can have no reason for complaint of the orthodox description of superconductivity phenomena because of its realistic essence .",
    "the sharp criticism by bell @xcite and others @xcite of the fuzzy status of measurements in quantum mechanics bears no relation to this description .",
    "there is not a measurement problem at the description of macroscopic quantum phenomena .",
    "one of the puzzles of the measurement problem raised by bell is this : _ `` how exactly is the world to be divided into speakable apparatus ... that we can talk about ... and unspeakable quantum system that we can not talk about ? '' _ @xcite .",
    "this puzzle is generated with the necessity to amplify _ microscopic events to macroscopic consequences _",
    "this necessity is absent for macroscopic events .",
    "therefore macroscopic quantum systems are _ speakable _ in contrast to the microscopic one .",
    "bell urged to study _ the de broglie - bohm picture _ which _ `` disposes of the necessity to divide the world somehow into system and apparatus '' _ @xcite .",
    "he marked out as far back as 1964 @xcite the theory by david bohm @xcite as the evidence of the possibility to interpret the quantum theory realistically in terms of hidden variables .",
    "bell s favorite example of a hidden - variables theory is not only explicitly contextual but explicitly and spectacularly non - local , as it must be in view of the bell - ks theorem and bell s theorem \" _",
    "the non - locality of the quantum mechanics is revealed by bohm @xcite by means of a `` quantum mechanical '' potential .",
    "the bohm s quantum potential is deduced @xcite in the limits of the universally recognised quantum formalism , as well as the azimuthal quantum force in superconductor @xcite .",
    "but there is a fundamental difference between the bohm s quantum potential and the quantum force @xcite because of the different essence of the wave functions @xcite describing different quantum phenomena .",
    "this difference may be seen clearly on the example @xcite of the aharonov - bohm effect @xcite observed in the double - slit interference experiment and superconducting ring .",
    "the effect in the both cases is a consequence of the connection @xmath2 between the phase @xmath291 of the wave function @xmath292 and the vector potential @xmath293 .",
    "but the essence of @xmath294 is positivistic at the description of the double - slit interference experiment and realistic at the description of the aharonov - bohm effect in the ring @xcite .",
    "the quantization ( 2 ) is a consequence just of the realistic essence of the wave function without which the requirement @xmath295 can not be valid .",
    "the phase difference @xmath296 for two possible path @xmath297 , @xmath298 of a particle through the first slit @xmath299 and the second slit @xmath300 between a particle source @xmath301 and a point @xmath302 on the detecting screen , see fig.1 in @xcite , equals the integral @xmath303 in ( 2 ) .",
    "but the value @xmath304 changes uninterruptedly , in defiance of ( 2 ) , with the co - ordinate @xmath302 and magnetic flux @xmath13 because of the collapse of the wave function @xmath305 , describing the double - slit interference experiment , at observation of a particle position @xmath302 on the detecting screen .",
    "this positivistic cause of the quantization ( 2 ) breach differs in essence from the real rupture of superconducting state @xmath306 in the ring , fig.2 , under influence of a real cause .",
    "the quantum force ( 6 ) may be considered real just because of the reality of the @xmath306 change .",
    "although the azimuthal quantum force is deduced in the limits of the universally recognised quantum formalism as well as the bohm s quantum potential @xcite it is not useless .",
    "heisenberg stated @xcite that according to the pure positivistic point of view the bohm s interpretation @xcite repeats only the orthodox copenhagen interpretation .",
    "bell did not contest this statement but the bohm s work @xcite inspired he , as the opponent of positivism , with the confidence in the possibility of realistic interpretation of quantum mechanics .",
    "bell was sure that variables in any realistic theory should be _ ``",
    "hidden because if states with prescribed values of these variables could actually be prepared , quantum mechanics would be observably inadequate '' _ @xcite . but all superconducting states with prescribed values of these variables can actually be prepared .",
    "these variables , including the angular momentum change @xmath279 at the closing of superconducting state in the ring , fig.2 , are real in the sense that they can not change because of an act of observation as such .",
    "the realistic description of superconductivity phenomena even without hidden variables removes the puzzles generated with superposition collapse at observation but other puzzles become more real in this description .",
    "the problem of the force - free momentum transfer at the aharonov - bohm effect @xcite , discussed many years @xcite for the case of the double - slit interference experiment , is more real at the closing of the superconducting state in the ring , fig.2 , because the wave function @xmath0 describes the real density @xmath1 .",
    "the epr paradox and the bohm s quantum potential @xcite have revealed the non - locality of the quantum mechanics in description ( non - locality of the first kind according to @xcite ) and the bell s no - hidden - variables theorem @xcite has revealed this non - locality in observation ( non - locality of the second kind @xcite ) .",
    "this non - local correlation because of the instantaneous collapse of the positivistic wave function at observation is absent at the description of superconductivity phenomena because of its realistic essence .",
    "nevertheless there is a non - locality , at least in description .",
    "the orthodox quantum formalism predicts that the velocity of pairs in a superconducting segment @xmath307 of the ring , fig.2 , should change without a real force at the transition of the spatially separated segment @xmath308 in superconducting state .",
    "this change must be because of the quantization requirement ( 2 ) but the question how quickly the state of pairs can change in the spatially separated segments was essentially never raised nor answered .",
    "this change must not be instantaneous , as in the case of the collapse , but the quantum mechanics or any other theory can not provide a defined time or velocity of this real influence on the spatially separated event .",
    "the benefit of the quantum force considered in @xcite and this paper is not limited to the disclosure of new puzzles generated with quantum mechanics .",
    "first of all , the mysterious change of the angular momentum at the closing of the wave function ( 6 ) delivers from the necessity to make preposterous claim that an electric current can be dissipationless in a ring with non - zero resistance .",
    "this claim , made , for example by the authors @xcite , is not only fully groundless but also useless @xcite because of the observation @xcite of the persistent current flowing against electric field .",
    "the authors @xcite admit that _",
    "`` a dissipationless equilibrium current flowing through a resistive circuit is counterintuitive '' _ but claim unreasonably that _ `` it has a familiar analog in atomic physics : some atomic species electronic ground states possess nonzero orbital angular momentum , which is equivalent to a current circulating around the atom''_. the falsity of this analogy is obvious from the experimental results @xcite of these authors .",
    "they observe the one - dimensional angular momentum @xmath309 of the persistent current in flat rings the direction of which changes periodically with magnetic flux value .",
    "( it is obvious that the projections of this angular momentum in the ring flat @xmath310 are absent , @xmath311 , @xmath312 . )",
    "the angular momentum of atom should be considered as three - dimensional @xmath313 if its direction could be observed , i.e. if three its projections @xmath314 , @xmath315 , @xmath316 could be measure simultaneously .",
    "because of the impossibility of such measurement the angular momentum of atom can not exist really according to the orthodox quantum mechanics and can be considered only as hidden variable in realistic theories @xcite .",
    "the exponential decrease of the amplitude of the persistent current with temperature increase observed in normal metal rings , see fig.3 in @xcite , makes absolutely nonsensical both the analogy with atom and the claim @xcite on the absence of dissipation .",
    "the experimental dependencies , fig.3 in @xcite , are described enough well with the theory considered diffusive electrons the mean free path of which is small because of scattering on different kinds of disorders of realistic metal rings .",
    "such diffusive motion of electron and its scattering on disorders are absolutely inconceivable on a stationary atomic orbit .",
    "the claim @xcite that the persistent current can flow at @xmath163 without dissipating energy implies the absence of its interaction with environment and , consequently and contrary to the experiment , fig.3 in @xcite , the impossibility of any temperature dependence of its parameters .",
    "the mysterious observations @xcite of the persistent current which does not decay in the realistic metal rings can be described without this preposterous claim if one takes into account that electron can return after its scattering in the state with certain angular momentum described by the quantization ( 2 ) .",
    "this returning from the state with uncertain momentum and zero velocity on the average to the quantization state with certain momentum and non - zero velocity on the average at @xmath158 should imply the momentum change opposite to the one because of the electron scattering .",
    "the second change is described by the dissipation force and the first one may be called as quantum force .    this description with the quantum force withstanding",
    "the dissipation force may predict a possibility of the potential difference @xmath35 on halves of asymmetric normal metal ring with the persistent current .",
    "the observations of this phenomenon on halves of asymmetric superconducting rings @xcite testify to the validity of this prediction . in order that this prediction could be verified by an experimenter he should reject the preposterous claims @xcite about the dissipationless current at @xmath163 and the analogy with atom .",
    "this analogy does not take into account not only the obvious fundamental difference between atom and mesoscopic ring but also the difference of our experimental possibilities on these different levels .",
    "we can not make an asymmetric atom , but it is enough easy to make asymmetric ring .",
    "this difference of the experimental possibilities is more important than the non - universality in the quantum description because physics is empirical science and quantum mechanics describes first of all phenomena .",
    "one can switch with a frequency @xmath317 the segment @xmath293 , fig.2 , between superconducting and normal state with help , for example , of laser beam and measure the voltage induced with this switching .",
    "one can also measure the mechanical force acting at mechanical closing of the superconducting loop at @xmath24 @xcite .",
    "the orthodox quantum mechanics can describe even these phenomena but it can not explain why the angular momentum can change because of the closing of the wave function .",
    "we can only hope or dream that this puzzle will be solved sometime .",
