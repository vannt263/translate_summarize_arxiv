    "the confinement of single electrons in semiconductor quantum dots ( qds ) and the control of their spin has been motivated by perspectives of using the electron spin as the ultimate solid state system to store and process quantum information . in the commonly studied iii - v semiconductor qds",
    ", the hyperfine interaction of the electron with the fluctuating nuclear spins limits the time scale on which an electron spin can be manipulated at low magnetic field .",
    "it has been proposed that a full polarization of the nuclei could cancel the decoherence of the electron induced by the fluctuating hyperfine field @xcite .",
    "alternatively , the decoherence created by nuclei could be circumvented by using isotopically purified ii - vi materials @xcite since zn , cd , mg , o , se and te all have dominant isotopes without nuclear spins .",
    "however , as highlighted in reference 3 and 4 , the interaction between a confined electron in a ii - vi qd and the low density of nuclear spins i=1/2 in a qd volume ten to one hundred times smaller than inas / gaas qds leads to some spin dynamics which is fundamentally different from the one observed in iii - v systems @xcite .    due to the small qd size and low density of nuclear spins , the electron - nuclei dynamics in ii - vi qds is ruled by a large knight field and significant nuclear spin fluctuations despite a small overhauser field .",
    "consequently , the nuclei - induced spin decoherence of the electron is also an issue in ii - vi qds .",

    "the overhauser shift is much smaller than the photoluminescence ( pl ) linewidth and can not be observed directly : the nuclear field is detected through the polarization rate of the resident electron which is controlled by the nuclear spin fluctuations ( nsf ) .",

    "the electron - induced nuclear depolarization was demonstrated in @xcite in which the @xmath202 relaxation was completely suppressed using a voltage pulse on a schottky diode in order to remove the resident electron .",
    "in summary , we have evidenced in the ple spectra of a negatively charged cdte qd the polarized fine structure of the triplet states of the charged exciton .",
    "we have studied , using pl decay measurements , the dynamics of the injection of spin polarized photo - carriers as a function of the energy of the injection .",
    "we have shown that the injection above the triplet states of the charged exciton can be use to pump the resident electron on a time - scale of @xmath231 and to create a dynamic nuclear spin polarization . at @xmath2 ,",
    "the creation of the dynamic nuclear spin polarization can be as fast as a few @xmath148 , and the decay of the nuclear polarization , attributed to an electron mediated relaxation , is @xmath232 .",
    "the measured dynamics are @xmath233 faster than the ones observed in iii / v qds at @xmath2 .",
    "the relaxation time of the coupled electron - nuclei system is increased by one order of magnitude under a magnetic field of 5mt .",
    "the magnetic - field dependence of the pl polarization rate revealed that the nuclear spin fluctuations are the dominant process in the dephasing of the resident electron .",
    "we proved that this dephasing is efficiently suppressed by a large dynamic nuclear spin polarization at @xmath2 .",
