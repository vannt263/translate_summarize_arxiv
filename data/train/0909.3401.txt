    "such a mechanism is interesting in itself and is even indispensable when direct operations on the target quantum systems are not allowed or unavailable .",
    "the repeated measurements on the ancilla can be regarded as an indirect ( povm ) measurement on the target system which , under proper conditions , allows us to drive the latter toward the desired pure state .",

    "the primary motivation of the present work is to persue a scheme which would allow one to reach the target state with probability 1 , or at least , with probability arbitrarily close to 1 , independently of the initial conditions .",

    "@xcite , a scheme is proposed to extract the singlet state from an arbitrarily given initial state of @xmath46 , in which neither the preparation of the spin state of @xmath4 nor its post - selection is required . however , it is still a probabilistic scheme , since the singlet state is extracted by the successive post - selections of transmitted events .",
    "the protocol presented here solves this problem , allowing one to produce a maximally entangled state of @xmath1 and @xmath2 from their arbitrary initial state _ with probability 1_. the scheme remains free from the preparation and the post - selection of the spin state of @xmath4 .",
    "here comes our protocol ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : flowchart ] ) :    1 .",
    "the initial state of @xmath1 and @xmath2 is _ arbitrary _ and is in general a mixed state @xmath47 .",
    "we send @xmath4 with its spin _ arbitrary _ from the left to @xmath1 and @xmath2 with a resonant wave vector @xmath48 ( @xmath40 ) , and see if it is transmitted to the right or reflected to the left , _ irrespectively of its spin state_. 3 .   if @xmath4 is detected on the right ( transmitted ) , we proceed to the next round ( to step 1 ) .",
    "4 .   otherwise ( reflected ) , we send another @xmath4 from the left with its spin _ randomly _ chosen with an off - resonant wave vector @xmath49 ( perfectly polarized incident spin of @xmath4 is not recommended ) .",
    "we do not check anything after this scattering ; we just proceed to the next round ( to step 1 ) .",
    "we repeat this routine ( steps 1 to 3 ) many times and end up with the singlet state @xmath36 in @xmath1 and @xmath2 _ with probability 1_.        this is a feedback approach , where we take different actions depending on the outcome of the resonant scattering at step 1 .",
    "notice however that , for implementing the feedback , no additional element is required : we have only to set the incident wave vector of the ancilla off - resonant .",
    "it is also worth stressing that , at step 1 , the choice of the incident spin of @xmath4 is irrelevant and we can just choose it arbitrarily . at step 3 , on the other hand , we can choose it randomly , but if the incident spin of @xmath4 is perfectly polarized always in the same direction at every cycle , the scheme does not work . in order to make the following analysis simpler and transparent , however , we take unpolarized spin for both steps , represented by the completely mixed state @xmath50 .",
    "a single cycle ( steps 1 to 3 ) changes the spin state @xmath47 of @xmath1 and @xmath2 in the following way : @xmath51 where @xmath52 and @xmath53 on the basis of the unitarity ( [ eqn : unitarity ] ) , the map @xmath54 is trace preserving , @xmath55 meaning that all possible outcomes are properly kept at each step and there is no selection of specific detection events .",
    "we will see that the repetition of the above cycle leads @xmath1 and @xmath2 into the singlet state , @xmath56 irrespectively of their initial state @xmath47 , where @xmath57 is the number of cycles of the protocol .",
    "in other words , we are going to prove that @xmath54 is `` mixing '' @xcite with its fixed point given by @xmath58 .",
    "in order to verify the claim ( [ eqn : mixing2psi ] ) , we invoke an important result on mixing channels , which states that a cpt ( completely positive and trace - preserving ) map @xmath54 is mixing if it has a unique fixed point that is a pure state , e.g. , see ref .",
    "we remind that the fixed points of @xmath54 are defined as those input states @xmath59 which are left invariant by the action of the channel , i.e. , @xmath60 in our case , it is immediate to check that @xmath58 is a fixed point of @xmath54 : indeed , as is clear from eqs .",
    "( [ eqn : treso ] ) and ( [ eqn : rreso ] ) , @xmath58 is preserved by @xmath61 while @xmath62 yields nothing ( reflection does not occur with @xmath58 ) .",
    "thus , since @xmath58 is a pure state , it follows that the only thing we need to verify in order to prove the mixing ( [ eqn : mixing2psi ] ) is that there exists no other fixed point of the channel @xmath54 .",
    "assume then that there exists another fixed point @xmath59 , that is different from @xmath58 .",
    "by definition , it must satisfy the identity @xmath63 this expression can be simplified by noticing that the following identity holds at resonances : @xmath64 where @xmath65 are the superoperators associated with the projections onto the triplet and singlet subspaces , respectively , @xmath66 indeed , taking eq .",
    "( [ eqn : resoprojection ] ) into account , a necessary condition for eq .",
    "( [ eqn : fixedpoint ] ) is given by @xmath67 look at eq .",
    "( [ eqn : rreso ] ) again : it shows that @xmath62 cuts out the singlet sector and acts on the triplet components .",
    "since we are assuming that @xmath59 is different from the singlet state @xmath58 , we surely find some component @xmath68 in the triplet sector .",
    "therefore , if @xmath69 is such a map that certainly couples any triplet components to the singlet sector , the condition ( [ eqn : fixedreduced ] ) is never satisfied except for the singlet state @xmath58 .",
    "consequently , by contradiction , the singlet state is proved to be the unique fixed point of the map @xmath54 .",
    "defined in eq .",
    "( [ eqn : wq ] ) , as a function of @xmath49 and @xmath38 .",
    "the larger is @xmath70 , the larger is the flow from the triplet sector to the singlet , by the action of @xmath69 . ]",
    "the condition for such a map @xmath69 is expressed as @xmath71 for any state @xmath72 . by inserting the explicit expressions of @xmath73 and @xmath74 given in eqs .",
    "( [ eqn : t ] ) and ( [ eqn : r ] ) , it reads @xmath75 with a coefficient @xmath76 , \\label{eqn : wq}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which is nonvanishing for any @xmath77 ( @xmath78 ) and for any state @xmath72 .",
    "that is , @xmath69 with an off - resonant wave vector @xmath49 is a map that surely couples any triplet component of @xmath1 and @xmath2 to the singlet sector and excludes the existence of @xmath59 satisfying eq .",

    "they are actually nonzero except at the resonant wave vectors @xmath79 ( @xmath40 ) .",
    "the reason why @xmath1 and @xmath2 are attracted into the singlet state by the repeated applications of @xmath54 is the following .",
    "the singlet state @xmath58 is the fixed point of the map @xmath54 , and the singlet component in the state of @xmath1 and @xmath2 remains there . as for the triplet components , they provoke the reflection of @xmath4 with a certain probability at step 1 .",
    "once @xmath4 is found to be reflected , the qubits @xmath1 and @xmath2 are `` shuffled '' by the subsequent off - resonant scattering @xmath69 , which creates a singlet component . in total , the probability to find @xmath1 and @xmath2 in the singlet state is increased by the single cycle .",
    "outflow of the probability from the singlet sector is absent , while inflow is present .",
    "this feature leads the system into the singlet state @xmath58 . and",
    "@xmath2 from approaching the singlet state .",
    "as the cycle is repeated , however , the average probability to find @xmath1 and @xmath2 in the singlet state increases ( as explained above ) , and the average probability for such a reflection to occur is accordingly reduced : the chance of the loss of the singlet component becomes less and less likely , and the singlet component keeps on growing on average .",
    "a simple statistical argument can then be used to claim that , since on average these events are suppressed , the probability of generating a specific trajectory which does not have this property is also suppressed . ]",
    "the scheme surely works . as a direct check",
    ", the average fidelity @xmath80 of the protocol is shown in figs .",
    "[ fig : fmixing ] and [ fig : fmixingqg ] .",
    "it is obtained by computing the fidelity between the generated state @xmath81 and the target @xmath58 , which is averaged over all possible choices of the input state @xmath47 , i.e. , @xmath82 where @xmath83}}$ ] stands for the average over the input state @xmath47 and @xmath84 is the identity operator on @xmath46 . from these plots",
    ", it is evident that as the number @xmath57 of protocol cycles increases , the average fidelity @xmath80 approaches asymptotically to @xmath0 , as long as the wave vector @xmath49 is properly set off - resonant .",
    "this implies that for an average choice of the input state @xmath47 , the state @xmath81 approaches @xmath58 . by linearity",
    ", this also implies that the same result should hold for each input @xmath47 .",

    "it is remarkable that no additional element or technology is required for the feedback : we have only to set the incident momentum of the ancilla off a resonance point .",
    "the convergence to the unique fixed point ( mixing property ) is rigorously proved , and is shown to be robust again various types of imperfections in the scheme .",
    "in particular , the scheme is very robust against the inefficiency of the detectors , which is clarified by a concise formula for the fidelity of the fixed point of the mixing map to the target singlet state .",
    "we here concentrated on a specific physical model with two qubits fixed along a 1d channel , where ancilla qubits flow .",
    "the present analysis however provides a general guideline for turning a probabilistic convergence scheme into a scheme that works with probability arbitrarily close @xmath0 . in general , the former probabilistic scheme keeps the target state , as long as the measurement on an ancilla reports desired result . if the measurement outcome is not the desired one and",
