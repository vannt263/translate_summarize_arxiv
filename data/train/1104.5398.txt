    "aspects of the @xmath0 factorization theorem @xcite in perturbative qcd have been investigated intensively .",
    "one of the important issues is about the derivation of a @xmath0-dependent hard kernel at subleading level , which is defined as the difference between qcd diagrams and effective diagrams for transverse - momentum - dependent ( tmd ) hadron wave functions . we have explained that partons in both sets of diagrams should remain off mass shell by @xmath1 in the @xmath0 factorization theorem @xcite .",

    "we shall first demonstrate the gauge invariance of the three - parton contribution to the pion electromagnetic form factor in the @xmath0 factorization theorem .",
    "there are two sources of gauge dependence for this power correction @xcite : the first source is proportional to parton transverse momenta from the two - parton fock state . the corresponding hadronic matrix element is written as @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the coordinate of the anti - quark field @xmath6 , and @xmath7 represents a combination of gamma matrices .",

    "we just keep the transverse momentum dependence in denominators of particle propagators @xcite .",

    "it has been pointed out explicitly that the leading - order ( lo ) hard kernel for the pion electromagnetic form factor becomes gauge - dependent , if one simply considers parton transverse momenta in numerators @xcite . however , the contribution from the three - parton fock state was still missing in @xcite , such that the false postulation on the gauge dependence of the @xmath0 factorization theorem was made .    since both the",

    "we observe that the diagrams with a four - gluon vertex dominate this power correction .",
    "it will be shown that the three - parton contribution is only about 5% of the sum of those which have been investigated before , including the lo twist-2 , nlo twist-2 , and lo two - parton twist-3 ones @xcite .",
