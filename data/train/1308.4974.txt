    "galactic winds are observed to be ubiquitous in galaxies that have recently experienced significant amounts star formation ( see e.g. , * ? ? ? * for a review ) .",
    "these outflows represent a fundamental part of galaxy formation models , because the absence of outflows galaxy star formation rates ( sfrs ) are much higher than those observed ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and baryon fractions in the disk are close to the universal value ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , much higher than inferred from observations . in contrast , models that include a variety of feedback effects predict much lower sfrs and baryon fractions . additionally , outflows are required to drive metal - enriched gas out of galaxies , as suggested by both observational ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) and theoretical ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) work .",
    "however , despite their key role in galaxy formation , the exact processes driving winds remain an open question .",
    "plausible driving mechanisms include core collapse supernovae ( sn , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and radiation pressure @xcite .",
    "sn - driven winds are now routinely included in semi - analytic and numerical simulations .",
    "however , it has long been known that in the disk of the galaxy there is a rough equipartition of the magnetic and cosmic ray ( cr ) energy densities ( e.g * ? ? ?",
    "this indicates that crs play a significant role in dynamics of interstellar medium .",
    "only relatively recently have the effects of crs have been considered in the context of galaxy formation ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",

    "* ) and galaxy cluster @xcite simulations .",
    "a tight link between crs and star formation is evidenced by the correlation between a galaxy s infra - red luminosity , closely related to its sfr , and the luminosity of its radio halo ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the relationship is almost linear , has very little scatter , and does not evolve with redshift @xcite , indicating that the coupling between star formation and crs is robust over a wide variety of conditions .",
    "although the energy injection rate of crs is small when compared to the other sources of energy from star formation , the rate at which they inject momentum is not @xcite .",
    "this is because the crs that supply most of the pressure in the galaxy generate alfvn waves in the ism @xcite , which then scatter the crs with a mean free path of @xmath3pc .",
    "crs are self - confined ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and it takes @xmath4myr for a typical cr to escape its parent galaxy .",
    "theoretical models of dynamical haloes in which crs diffuse and are advected out in a galactic wind predict steady , supersonic galaxy - scale outflows driven by a combination of cr and thermal pressure @xcite .    in this letter we present high - resolution hydrodynamical simulations of isolated disk galaxies , including a model for the injection , transport and decay of crs , to investigate how outflows are driven by crs and the properties of the outflowing gas .",
    "our simulations are performed with the adaptive - mesh - refinement ( amr ) code ramses , described in @xcite .",
    "the detailed description of physical processes included in our simulations  star formation , radiative cooling , and metal enrichment from type ia sne , type ii sne and intermediate mass stars  can be found in @xcite .",
    "sn feedback is modelled by injecting a total of @xmath5ergs of thermal energy per sn into the cells neighbouring the star particle .",
    "we do not employ any delay of dissipation for the injected energy in these runs ( the runs are equivalent to the  energy only  run in * ? ? ?",
    "a full description of the cr field would require modelling the distribution function of crs as a function of position , momentum and time .",
    "however , if the cr mean free path is shorter than the length scale of the problem , the cr field can be described as a fluid @xcite .",
    "we thus take the approach of modelling the cr energy density , @xmath6 , as an additional energy field that advects passively with the gas density ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and exerts a pressure @xmath7 .",
    "thus , the total pressure entering the momentum and energy equations governing gas evolution is @xmath8 .",
    "we assume throughout that the cr fluid is an ultra relatavistic ideal gas with @xmath9 .",
    "as described above , crs undergo a random walk through the ism after their injection .",
    "their evolution is thus a combination of advection with the ambient gas flow and diffusion , which we parametrize by the diffusion coefficient , @xmath10 .",
    "the evolution of baryon and cr fluids is thus governed by the standard continuity and momentum equations and the following energy equations :    @xmath11    @xmath12    where @xmath13 is gas velocity , @xmath14 , @xmath15 and @xmath16 , @xmath17 are the pressure and internal energy of gas and crs , respectively . the @xmath18 indicates energy injection by sn , and @xmath19 is the fraction of this energy that is injected in the form of crs .",
    "@xmath20 indicates radiative cooling of gas , while @xmath21 indicates the heating of gas by both crs and uv radiation .",
    "finally , @xmath22 corresponds to energy losses by crs both due to decays and coulomb interactions with gas mediated by magnetic fields ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "following @xcite we assume that the cr cooling rate is : @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the local electron number density .",
    "the ratio of the catastrophic cooling rate to the couloumb cooling rate for our cr population is 3.55 .",
    "some fraction of the energy lost by the cr population heats the thermal gas ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) at a rate given by @xcite @xmath25 equations [ eq : crcool ] and [ eq : crheat ] are solved on every timestep to calculate the rate of decay of the cr energy density along with the corresponding gain in the gas thermal energy .",
    "we have tested our cr implementation using a standard shock - tube test involving gas and cr fluids @xcite and found that results accurately match the analytic solution .",
    "results of this and other tests will be presented in a forthcoming paper .",
    "strong shock waves associated with sn explosions have long been recognized as a likely source of galactic crs ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "empirically , in order to match the galactic energy density in crs , sne must be capable of transferring a fraction @xmath26 of the explosion kinetic energy into the form of cr energy @xcite . in our models",
    "we make the assumption that a certain fraction , @xmath27 , of the sn energy is injected to the cr fluid energy density . the remaining fraction @xmath28 is injected thermally into the gas field .",
    "we note that the assumptions that the diffusion of crs is isotropic and that the diffusion coefficient is a constant are necessary simplification in our models , which track neither the direction nor the strength of the magnetic field . on small scales ( @xmath29100 pc ) ,",
    "the strength of the random component of the galactic magnetic field is several times higher than the average field strength ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) because galaxy formation processes ( e.g. supernovae and hydrodynamical turbulence ) in the disk @xcite and the turbulent dynamo effect and cr buoyancy in the halo @xcite tangle the magnetic field to the extent that isotropic diffusion is a good approximation(e.g .",
    "codes that assume isotropic diffusion are able to predict cr - emitted spectral data down to the few percent level ( e.g * ? ? ?",
    "for the purposes of this exploratory work we employ the isotropic diffusion model , but note that investigation of complex models represents an interesting future direction for this work .",
    "we simulate isolated , model galaxies of two different masses representing an smc - sized dwarf galaxy and mw - sized disk galaxy with three different feedback models : no feedback , thermal feedback only , and thermal plus cr feedback .",

    "we measure outflow velocities by projecting the gas field perpendicular to the disk and calculating the velocity that contains 90% of the cool ( @xmath43k ) gas . in each galaxy",
    "the thermal feedback simulation predicts outflow velocities that are significantly larger than those observed whereas the cr runs are comparable to the observations .        finally , fig .",
    "[ fig : im ] shows the temperature of the outflowing gas in a thin slice through the centre of the simulated galaxies ( left ) .",
    "the notable difference between simulations is that wind in the cr simulation is considerably cooler , especially in the smc simulation .",
    "the panels to the right of this figure show the profiles of velocity and outward pressure gradient .",
    "the thermal feedback run has winds that accelerate abruptly from the galactic disk up to @xmath44km / s and thereafter have a constant velocity .",
    "the cr simulations , however show a wind that accelerates smoothly into the halo .",
    "the reason for this is revealed in the right - hand panels , where it is immediately apparent that the pressure gradient in the halo with crs is a factor of 3 - 10 larger in the cr simulation than in the thermal feedback simulation ( the difference is particularly striking in the smc simulation ) .",
    "these results illustrate that the wind properties in the simulations with crs are qualitatively different properties to the wind driven by thermal sn feedback .",
    "our simulations show that energy injection in the form of crs is a promising feedback process that can substantially aid in driving outflows from star - forming galaxies .",
    "first , we find that cr injection can suppress the sfr by providing an extra source of pressure that stabilizes the disk .",
    "turbulent and cr pressure are in equipartition in the disk , thus the cr pressure can significantly affect most of the volume of the disk , but will be sub - dominant inside supersonic molecular clouds , where turbulent pressure dominates over both cr and thermal presure , particularly in the dwarf galaxy .",
    "the sfrs measured in our galaxies with cr feedback are comparable to observed sfrs for both the mw and the smc .",
    "second , we find that addition of the cr feedback increases the mass loading factor , @xmath34 , in the dwarf galaxy by a factor of ten compared to the simulation with sn only feedback . as a result ,",
    "the smc and mw - sized galaxies ( circular velocities of @xmath45 and @xmath46 km / s , respectively ) have mass loading factors that differ by a factor of @xmath47 , depending on the stage of evolution .",
    "this is in rough agreement with expectations from theoretical models based on simulations and semi - analytic models , which show that dependence @xmath48 with @xmath49 is needed to reproduce the observed faint end of the galaxy stellar mass function and other properties of the galaxy population ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    ". moreover , the wind velocities in the smc and mw - sized simulated galaxies are consistent with the observed trend for galaxies in this mass range @xcite both in normalization and slope .",
    "although we have reported only two models , these results are encouraging , especially because simulation parameters have not been tuned to reproduce these observations .",
    "perhaps the most intriguing difference of the cr - driven winds compared to the winds driven by thermal sn feedback is that they contain significantly more `` warm '' @xmath2  k gas .",
    "this is especially true for the dwarf galaxy , which develops a wind strikingly colder than in the sn - only simulation ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : im ] ) .",
    "the cr - driven wind has a lower velocity , and is accelerated gradually with vertical distance from the disk .",
    "the reason for these differences is that the gas ejected from the disk is accelerated not only near star - forming regions , as is the case in sn - only simulations , but is continuously accelerated by the pressure gradient established by crs diffused outside of the disk ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : im ] ) .",
    "the diffusion of crs is thus a key factor in ejecting winds and in their resulting colder temperatures .",
    "the cooler temperatures of the ejected gas may be one of the most intriguing new features of the cr - driven winds , as this may provide a clue on the origin of ubiquitous warm gas in gaseous halos of galaxies ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * and references therein ) .",
    "detailed predictions of cgm properties will require cosmological galaxy formation simulations incorporating cr feedback , which we will pursue in future work .",
    "several studies have explored effects of cr injection on galaxies .",
    "@xcite found that crs suppress the sfr in dwarf galaxies by an amount comparable to our simulations , but have almost no effect on the sfr of mw - sized systems .",
    "we find significant sfr suppression for both masses . additionally , @xcite found that crs did not generate winds with diffusion alone and in a recent study using a similar model @xcite argued that to launch winds cr streaming is crucial .",
    "in contrast , we find that cr - driven winds are established with cr diffusion alone .",
    "these differences likely arise due to assumption of equilibrium between the sources of crs ( star formation @xmath50 ) and the sinks ( catastrophic losses @xmath51 ) in the subgrid model of @xcite .",
    "the subgrid model thus predicts that cr pressure scales as @xmath52 and is subdominant to the thermal ism pressure at densities @xmath53@xmath54 ( see fig .",
    "7 of * ? ? ?",
    "this assumption of equilibrium , which is likely true only in the deepest parts of the galaxy potential well ( see e.g. the discussion in * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , breaks down in lower density gas . in our simulations",
    "we do not assume such equilibrium and we find significant pressure contributions from crs up to much higher densities .",
    "our results thus indicate that crs , even in the diffusion limit , not only suppress star formation but also drive outflows efficiently .",
    "thus , the effects of cr feedback on the properties of galaxies of different masses should be significantly stronger and span a wider range of masses than simulations that use the @xcite model ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "while this manuscript was in a late stage of preparation @xcite appeared as a preprint .",
    "these authors have presented simulations of a mw - sized galaxy , similar to the model presented here , albeit without accounting for cr cooling losses and with a much larger sfr in their model galaxy ( up to @xmath55 . where our results overlap ( e.g. , mass - loading factor ) with those of @xcite we find remarkably good agreement .",
    "these authors also find that outflows are efficiently generated with cr diffusion alone .",
    "our study extends the results of @xcite by presenting the differences between wind properties in dwarf and mw - sized systems .",
    "the results of @xcite and our study indicate that crs can significantly suppress star formation in galaxies and efficiently drive outflows with significant mass loading factors and velocities comparable to observed outflows .",
