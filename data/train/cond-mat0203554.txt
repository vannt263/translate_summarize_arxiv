    "the breaking of fundamental symmetries of nature manifests itself in various new optical phenomena and is essential for our understanding of the interaction between light and complex matter .",
    "one well - known example is the natural optical activity discovered by arago in 1811 , a nonlocal optical response in media that have broken mirror symmetry , named _ chiral",
    "another example is the magnetically induced optical activity , first observed by faraday in 1846  @xcite and associated with the breaking of time - reversal symmetry by a magnetic field .",
    "although physically distinct , the two effects manifest themselves quite similarly in homogeneous media as a rotation of the linear polarization of light .",
    "this resemblance has motivated numerous works , pioneered by pasteur  @xcite , to search for a link between optical activity and the faraday effect , but in vain .",
    "the existence of an optical effect providing such a link is only allowed to occur under conditions where both mirror and time - reversal symmetries are simultaneously broken . the cross - effect between natural and magneto optical activity",
    "is called the _ magneto - chiral _ ( mc ) _ effect _ and was first predicted in 1962  @xcite , followed by studies in crystalline materials  @xcite .",
    "the mc effect was later again predicted independently several times  @xcite , both for absorption and for refraction .    in order to deduce the mc effect in homogeneous and isotropic media ,",
    "let us consider the propagation of light with wavevector @xmath1 through a magneto - optically active chiral medium with dielectric tensor @xmath2 under the influence of a static magnetic field @xmath3 .",
    "expanding @xmath4 to first order in @xmath5 and @xmath3 , we have  @xcite :    @xmath6    where @xmath7 is the levi - civita tensor , @xmath8 is the optical frequency and @xmath9 and @xmath10 are associated with the natural and magneto - optical activity , respectively . the last term of eq .",
    "( 1 ) describes the mc effect in homogeneous and isotropic media .",
    "it is important to point out some of the major features related to this effect .",
    "firstly , it depends on the relative orientation of * k * and * b*. secondly , the effect has opposite sign for the two different chiral enantiometers . finally , it is independent of the state of polarization of light . aside from its fundamental value for the understanding of the interaction between light and matter and the underlying symmetry principles that govern it , the mc effect in absorption",
    "has been suggested to be at the origin of the homochirality of life  @xcite , since it allows enantioselective photochemistry in a magnetic field with unpolarized light  @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , the magnitude of the molecular mc effect is very weak ( typically of the order of @xmath11 ) since it can be regarded , as discussed above , as a cross - effect between two already small effects , the natural and magneto optical activity .",
    "that s why the mc effect has only been reported recently : in absorption by rikken and raupach  @xcite , and in refraction by kleindienst _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite and vallet _ et al . _",
    "also the electrical analogue of the mc effect was recently reported  @xcite .    in the present paper ,",
    "we study the mc effect in _ scattering _ of light .",
    "we have investigated _ multiple _ light scattering by _ magneto - optically active _",
    "scatterers distributed in a _ chiral _",
    "configuration under the influence of an external magnetic field .",
    "this approach is completely different from the traditional molecular one that has been employed to model the mc effect  @xcite .",
    "multiple light scattering has been studied for scatterers exhibiting rotatory power  @xcite . in our model",
    "magneto - chirality is a _ collective _ effect built up by multiple scattering .",
    "one single scatterer does not exhibit mc effects since it is not made of a material that is natural optically active .",
    "however , an _ assembly _ of magneto - optically active particles distributed in a _ chiral _ configuration should generate mc effects since in such a system both mirror and time - reversal symmetry are broken .",
    "in order to investigate how scattering is affected by the mc effect , we have calculated , to our knowledge for the first time , the differential and the total cross - sections for a system composed by an arbitrary number of magneto - optically active scatterers in a magnetic field .",
    "we have investigated if these quantities are sensitive to the degree of chirality associated with the geometrical configuration of the scatterers in space , and have concluded that scattering in mc media constitutes a new optical manisfestation of chirality , in addition to the well - known rotatory power .",
    "a new optical parameter is introduced to quantify the chirality associated with the spatial geometry , which we have calculated for some simple chiral systems .",
    "we have also employed this parameter to probe the chirality of random systems , which are in general chiral .",
    "finally , we have compared it to recently defined chiral measures in literature  @xcite .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii we briefly explain how to quantify chirality and we explore this concept to define a new optical chiral parameter based on the scattering properties of mc media . in sec .",
    "iii we calculate this parameter for the simplest chiral geometry , the so - called  twisted h \" , whereas in sec .",
    "iv we employ it to quantify the degree of chirality of random scattering systems . finally , in sec . v we summarize the main results of this paper .",
    "there are several scattering systems eligible for mc effects .",
    "the most obvious of them could be a system composed by an assembly of mc scatterers ( i.e. , made of a material exhibiting both the faraday effect and natural optical activity ) . in order to study such a system , one should know precisely how an individual mc object scatters light .",
    "mathematically , this means that the scattering @xmath12 matrix of this object should be known .",
    "however , to our knowledge , no calculation exists for such a @xmath12 matrix .",
    "alternatively , it is possible to generate the mc effect in scattering systems by considering magneto - optically active scatterers distributed in chiral geometries .",
    "this is the kind of system that will be treated in the present work . before we describe the light scattering properties of such system ,",
    "it is instructive to make some general considerations about chirality itself and how one can quantify the degree of chirality associated with an arbitrary object or a distribution of scatterers in space .",
    "afterwards , we will discuss how a chiral configuration of scatterers affects the properties of the light scattered in mc media .      by definition ,",
    "a chiral object is an object whose mirror image can not be rotated to coincide with itself .",
    "it can be readily seen that this implies to have at least four particles for the system to be chiral .",
    "a three - particle system is necessarily achiral since it is always contained in a plane , which is automatically its mirror plane .",
    "recent work has addressed the problem whether chirality can be _ quantified _ or _ measured _ , in as much the same way that one can quantify the degree of order of a ferromagnet . despite the ubiquity of chirality in nature ( almost all arbitrary microscopic and macroscopic objects are chiral , from dna to a piece of rock ) and the important role played by chirality in several areas of research , from pharmaceutics to liquid crystals  @xcite and to the origin of life  @xcite , only recently real progress has been made .",
    "one of the first attempts to establish a quantitative measure of chirality is due to gilat  @xcite .",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite have developed a molecular measure of chirality based on the behaviour of the response functions that characterize molecular optical activity .",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite have proposed a new elegant way , based on group theory , to measure the degree of chirality exhibited by a geometric object .",
    "they have constructed a variety of rotationally invariant pseudoscalars and have applied them to quantify the degree of chirality of molecules of arbitrary shape , showing how these parameters govern a particular observable , such as the pitch of a cholesteric liquid crystal  @xcite and the optical rotatory power  @xcite .",
    "the choice for a chiral  order \" parameter is not unique  @xcite , but must always be a pseudoscalar _ invariant under rotations_. this last fact guarantees that no rotation of the object exists that maps the mirror image of a chiral object onto itself .    in what follows , we will describe the scattering properties of an assembly of magneto - optically active dipoles in a magnetic field .      in our model",
    ", we deal with dielectric _ pointlike _ magneto - optical scatterers ( i.e. , radiative dipoles much smaller than the wavelength of light ) located in vacuum .",
    "this model enables us to find exactly all scattering properties ( i.e. , the off - shell @xmath12 matrix ) of any number of scatterers in analytic form and without any further approximation .",
    "this model exhibits a scattering resonance , where the scattering cross - section of a single scattering reaches its maximum value .",

    "<S> we have investigated multiple scattering of light in systems subject to magneto - chiral ( mc ) effects . </S>",
    "<S> our medium consists of magneto - optically active dipoles placed in a chiral geometry under the influence of an external magnetic field . </S>",
    "<S> we have calculated , for the first time , the total and the differential scattering mc cross sections of this system , explicitely showing that they are proportional to _ pseudoscalar _ quantities . </S>",
    "<S> this provides a new optical measure for the degree of chirality , a pseudoscalar @xmath0 , of an arbitrary geometrical configuration of scatterers based on its scattering properties . </S>",
    "<S> we have calculated @xmath0 for some simple chiral systems and we have even used it to probe the degree of optical chirality of random systems . finally , we have compared @xmath0 with other recently defined chiral measures in literature .    </S>"
