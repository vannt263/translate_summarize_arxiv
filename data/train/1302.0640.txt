    "during the last 30 years many theoretical and experimental investigations have been performed for mg to obtain the atomic data and to understand its interaction with radiation through _ single - photon processes_. the first extensive theoretical studies for the triplet states of mg were performed by fischer @xcite with a multi - configuration hartree - fock method which included correlations between the valence electrons , and by victor and co - workers @xcite with a semiempirical model potential which included core - polarization and dielectronic terms to calculate the oscillator strengths ( oss ) for bound - bound transitions with @xmath2 , @xmath3 , and @xmath4 symmetries . using a fchfp with core - polarization and dielectronic terms",

    "most recently fang and chang has developed a _ b_-spline - based complex rotation method with spin - dependent interaction to calculate atomic photoionization of mg with singlet - triplet mixing @xcite .    as for the _ multiphoton processes _ of mg interacting with a laser pulse there are several experimental and theoretical works , all of which involve only _ singlet states _ : kim and co - workers @xcite studied single and double ionization of mg by 10 ns nd : yag laser pulses at both 532 and 1060 nm in the intensity range of @xmath12 w/@xmath13 .",

    "recently we have studied the ionization yield and pes of mg and clarified the origin of the subpeaks in the pes by the second and third harmonics of the fs ti : sapphire laser pulse @xcite .",
    "note that all the previous studies have focused on multiphoton ionization from the _ singlet states _ of mg .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to perform the theoretical study for the multiphoton ionization processes through the _ triplet states _ of mg by lp and cp fs laser pulses .",
    "specifically we choose @xmath0 @xmath1 as an initial state and perform time - dependent calculations after the construction of the atomic basis for both singlet and triplet series .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in secs .",
    "[ at ] and [ se ] we present the theoretical model : the time - dependent schrdinger equation ( tdse ) , which describes the time - dependent interaction dynamics of the mg atom with a laser pulse , is solved on the atomic basis states of mg with two - active - valence electrons .",
    "atomic units ( a.u . ) are used throughout this paper unless otherwise mentioned . in sec . [ nr ]",
    "we present representative numerical results for the state energies and the @xmath17-independent and dependent oss between the triplet states .",
    "our results are compared with the existing data to confirm the accuracy of our atomic basis .",
    "using those atomic basis states , we solve the tdse to calculate the total ionization yield and pes from the @xmath0 @xmath18 initial state of mg by lp and cp fs laser pulses . similar to the pes from the singlet ground state @xmath19 @xmath20 of mg @xcite , the pes from the triplet @xmath0 @xmath1 state also exhibits subpeak structure . finally , concluding remarks are given in sec .",
    "to start with , in order to study the interaction of the mg atom with a laser pulse we have to construct the atomic basis of the mg atom .",
    "the mg atom is a two - valence - electron atom ; it consists of a closed core ( the nucleus and the ten inner - shell electrons @xmath21 ) and the two valence electrons . as it is already mentioned in the literature",
    "@xcite there are several approaches to solve the schrdinger equation for one- and two - valence - electron atoms in a laser field . since the general computational procedure has already been presented in refs .",
    "@xcite to construct the atomic basis states and the specific details about the atomic structure calculation of mg have been reported in recent works @xcite , we only briefly describe the method we employ .",
    "the field - free one - electron hamiltonian of mg@xmath22 , @xmath23 , is expressed as    @xmath24    where @xmath25 represents the position vector of the valence electron , @xmath26 the core charge , @xmath27 the orbital quantum number , and @xmath28 the effective potential acting on the valence electron of mg@xmath22 .",
    "since the spin - orbit interaction is very weak for a light alkaline - earth - metal atom such as mg @xcite , it might be safely neglected in the atomic hamiltonian for our specific purpose .",
    "similar to our recent study @xcite in which we have presented detailed comparisons between the frozen - core hartree - fock ( fchf ) and mp calculations for the singlet states of mg , we employ two different approaches in this paper to describe the effective potential , @xmath29 , in eq .",
    "( [ eq : h_1e ] ) .",
    "namely ( i ) a fchf potential and ( ii ) a mp .      in the last years",
    "the most widely used method to describe the ionic core is the fchf approach . in the fchf approach the effective potential is given by    @xmath30    where @xmath31 represents the fchf potential and @xmath32 is the core - polarization potential which effectively accounts for the interaction between the closed core and the valence electrons @xcite .",
    "specifically we employ the following form for the core - polarization term :    @xmath33},\\ ] ]    in which @xmath34 is the static dipole polarizability of mg@xmath11 @xcite and @xmath35 ( @xmath36 ) are the cutoff radii for the different orbital angular momenta : @xmath37 , @xmath38 , @xmath39 , @xmath40 , and @xmath41 @xcite .      another simpler way to describe the ionic core is to use a mp , @xmath42 @xcite instead of the fchfp , @xmath31 .",
    "the advantage of the mp approach is that we can obtain the one - electron orbitals without self - consistent iterations , since the interactions of the valence electrons with the mg@xmath11 core are replaced by pseudopotentials for each angular momentum .",
    "thus the complexity of the problem is greatly reduced . that is , instead of the fchfp , i.e. , @xmath43 , we employ the pseudopotential we have obtained in our previous work @xcite to describe the interaction of the valence electron with the mg@xmath11 core :    @xmath44    where the values of the parameters introduced above , after the least - squares fitting , are @xmath45 and @xmath46 @xcite .",
    "we note that this form of @xmath42 is different from the one used in refs .",
    "@xcite . in sec .",
    "[ nr ] , we will compare the results obtained by fchfp , mp , and the experimental data .    in either approach described above to obtain the one - electron orbitals",
    ", we employ a set of _ b_-spline functions to expand them . thus solving the schrdinger equation for the nonrelativistic one - electron hamiltonian given in eq .",
    "( [ eq : h_1e ] ) is now reduced to an eigenvalue problem .",
    "once the one - electron orbitals have been obtained using either the fchfp or mp , we can construct two - electron states with the configuration interaction ( ci ) approach as we describe below : the field - free two - electron hamiltonian , @xmath47 , can be expressed as    @xmath48    where @xmath49 represents the one - electron hamiltonian for the @xmath50th electron as shown in eq .",
    "( [ eq : h_1e ] ) , and @xmath51 is a two - electron interaction operator , which includes the static coulomb interaction @xmath52 and the effective dielectronic interaction potential @xcite . @xmath53 and @xmath54 are the position vectors of the two valence electrons . by solving the two - electron schrdinger equation for the hamiltonian given in eq . ( [ hf ] ) ,",
    "the two - electron states are constructed with the ci approach @xcite .",
    "for mg , which is a light alkaline - earth - metal atom , the @xmath55 coupling is known to give a good description and hence it is sufficient to label a two - electron state by the following set of quantum numbers : the principal , orbital , and spin quantum numbers for each electron , @xmath56 ( @xmath57 ) , total orbital momentum @xmath58 , total spin @xmath59 , total angular momentum @xmath17 , and its projection @xmath60 on the quantization axis . after the ci procedure",
    ", two - electron states may be most generally labeled by the state energy and the quantum numbers @xmath61 .    for singlet states @xmath62 ,",
    "the above state labeling can be simplified to @xmath63 , since @xmath17 is automatically equal to @xmath58 .",
    "this is not the case , however , for the triplet states @xmath64 since @xmath65 due to the presence of spin - orbit interaction .",
    "physically , introduction of spin - orbit interactions influences the wave functions in two aspects : the dynamical ( radial ) part and the geometric ( angular ) part . as for the dynamical part we neglect its influence in this paper , since the spin - orbit interaction in the mg atom is small @xcite , anyway ,",
    "as one can easily see from the very small fine structure splittings , and hence the radial wave function may be assumed to be @xmath66independent as a lowest - order approximation .",
    "as for the geometric part , we can fully include it by introducing the additional quantum numbers , @xmath17 and its projection @xmath60 to specify the state .",
    "thus it is necessary and sufficient that the triplet state is labeled by @xmath61 .",
    "now , once we have obtained the two - electron wave functions we are able to calculate the dipole matrix elements as well as oss for both lp and cp fields . in the following two subsections we present two useful conversion relations between the @xmath67-dependent and @xmath67-independent dipole matrix elements and oss , respectively",
    "by applying the well - known wigner - eckart theorem the following conversion relation exists between the _ j_-dependent and _ j_-independent dipole matrix elements if we define the initial and final states , @xmath50 and @xmath68 , by a set of quantum numbers @xmath69 and @xmath70 , respectively :    @xmath71    in which @xmath72 and @xmath73 represent the _ j_-dependent and _ j_-independent dipole matrix elements , respectively .",
    "@xmath74 is associated with laser polarization , i.e. , @xmath75 for lp and @xmath76 for right or left circular polarization ( rcp or lcp ) , respectively .",
    "recall that the allowed transitions take place between states accordingly to the dipole selection rules , which are generally written as @xmath77 ( @xmath78 is forbidden if @xmath79 ) and @xmath80 ( @xmath81 is forbidden if @xmath78 ) .",
    "in addition the following dipole selection rules are satisfied since @xmath58 and @xmath59 are good quantum numbers : @xmath82 , @xmath83 and @xmath84 , where @xmath85 represents the projection on the quantization axis of the orbital quantum momentum .",
    "similarly , the oss for multiplet transitions between two states , @xmath50 and @xmath68 , could be related to the _",
    "j_-dependent oss @xcite :    @xmath86    where @xmath87 is the _",
    "j_-independent absorption os , while @xmath88 represents the _",
    "j_-dependent absorption os .",
    "having obtained the two - electron states constructed in a spherical box , we can now solve the tdse .",
    "the tdse for the two - electron atom interacting with a laser pulse reads    @xmath89          \\psi ( { \\bf r}_{1},{\\bf r}_{2};t ) , \\label{eq : tdse}\\ ] ]    where @xmath90 are the total ( two - electron ) wave function at positions @xmath91 and @xmath92 for each electron at time @xmath93 , and @xmath47 is the field - free atomic hamiltonian as shown in eq .",
    "( [ eq : h_2e ] ) .",

    "now , by replacing eq .",

    "( [ eq : tdse ] ) we obtain a set of first - order differential equations for the time - dependent coefficients @xmath113 :    @xmath114   c_{e_{n ' } j ' m'}(t ) , \\label{eq : c - tdse}\\ ] ]    where @xmath115 represents the @xmath17-dependent dipole matrix element calculated in sec .",
    "[ jdmx ] between two _ triplet _ states defined by the quantum numbers @xmath116 and @xmath117 .",
    "this means that we have neglected the spin - forbidden transitions between triplet and singlet states , which is reasonable for a light atom such as mg .",
    "specifically in what follows , we assume that the mg atom is initially in the triplet state of the lowest electronic configuration , @xmath0 @xmath18(@xmath118 ) , i.e. ,    @xmath119    the relevant energies of triplet states , averaged over the multiplet components , are presented in fig .",
    "note that @xmath0 @xmath120 is the lowest triplet state located at approximatively 2.71 ev from the ground state , @xmath19 @xmath121 . our specific choice for the initial state results in the great simplification of the time - dependent problem to deal with , since the allowed transition paths by the lp or cp field become very simple as shown in figs .",
    "[ fig2](a ) and [ fig2](b ) , respectively .",
    "if we chose a different initial state , for instance , @xmath122 @xmath123 , the transition paths for the lp field would be far more complicated than those shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2](a ) , and accordingly eq .",
    "( [ eq : c - tdse ] ) would become much more difficult to solve due to the enormous complexity of the transition paths .",
    "in contrast , this kind of complexity does not happen for the transitions between the singlet states @xcite .",
    "once we have obtained the time - dependent coefficients @xmath124 by solving eq .",
    "( [ eq : c - tdse ] ) , the ionization yield @xmath125 and pes @xmath126 can be calculated at the end of the pulse :    @xmath127    and    @xmath128    where @xmath129 represents the photoelectron energy .",
    "before solving the tdse we must perform several checks regarding the accuracy of the atomic basis for the _ triplet states _ of mg .",
    "related to this , we have already obtained accurate atomic basis for the _ singlet states _ in our previous work @xcite using fchfp as well as mp approaches .",
    "the atomic basis states we need to solve the tdse is constructed in a box size of 300 a.u . for the total angular momentum up to @xmath130 with 1000 states for each total angular momentum .",
    "a number of @xmath131 _ b_-spline polynomials of order @xmath132 with a sinelike knot grid is employed . to check the numerical convergence",
    "we have increased the box size up to 1000 a.u . together with an increased number of total angular momentum up to @xmath133 for each given intensity .",
    "it turned out that the basis states constructed in a box of 300 a.u . with the total angular momentum up to @xmath130 with 800 states for each angular momentum",
    "are sufficient to obtain a reasonable convergence in terms of the total ionization yield as well as pes . in table",
    "i we present the two - electron angular configurations of type @xmath134 included in the construction of the two - electron wave functions .",
    "the principal quantum numbers are taken values in the range @xmath135 and @xmath136 ( with @xmath137 if @xmath138 ) , respectively for each symmetry .",
    "the number of the two - electron configurations varies between @xmath139 and @xmath140 for the total angular momentum up to @xmath130 .    to start with ,",
    "we have compared the oss for the _ triplet states _ obtained by the length and velocity gauges with the fchfp approach , and confirmed that the agreement is quite good .",
    "this is a good indication that our wave functions are accurate . as for the mp approach",
    ", however , it is well known that the physically correct dipole matrix elements can be calculated only in the length gauge @xcite , since the hamiltonian becomes nonlocal due to the @xmath27-dependence of the mp ( see ref .",
    "@xcite ) , and we can not perform a similar comparison between the two gauges .    as a more direct comparison , we have calculated the state energies , oss , and dipole matrix elements by both fchfp and mp approaches and compared them with the existing theoretical and experimental data . in table ii we show the comparison of the calculated energies for the first ionization threshold and the first few triplet states @xmath5 @xmath141 with the corresponding experimental values , where @xmath142 or @xmath143 for each total orbital momentum @xmath144 and @xmath10 . the energies ( in units of ev ) are taken with respect to the second ionization threshold mg@xmath11 and the triplet states energies are averaged over the multiplet components .",
    "the theoretical data are taken from ref . @xcite and",
    "the experimental data are taken from the database of the national institute of standards and technology ( nist ) @xcite .",
    "there is an overall good agreement between the calculated energies and the experimental values , and in addition our mp approach provides more accurate energies than our fchfp approach .",
    "of course , the accuracy of the energies do not guarantee the accuracy of the wave functions , and we must further check the accuracy of the wave function in terms of the _ j_-independent and dependent oss .",
    "table iii presents the comparison of the _",
    "j_-independent oss for single - photon transitions calculated by the fchfp and mp approaches with other theoretical works refs .",
    "@xcite and the experimental data taken from nist .",
    "the oss in the length gauge are shown for single - photon transitions among the first few triplet states : @xmath145 , @xmath146 , @xmath147 , @xmath148 , and @xmath149 . from table",
    "iii it is clear that both fchf and mp approaches provide an accurate atomic basis for the triplet states of mg , and the overall agreement is quite well with other accurate calculations and the experimental data .",
    "there are , however , relatively large differences in the oss for the @xmath122 @xmath150 @xmath151 transition calculated by the fchfp approach and @xmath152 @xmath153 @xmath151 transition calculated by the mp approach .",
    "besides a small difference exists in the os of the @xmath152 @xmath154 @xmath155 transition calculated by both fchf and mp approaches . this might be due to the very small energy difference between these two bound states of 0.016 ev .",
    "finally , in table iv we show the comparison of the _ j_-dependent single - photon absorption oss calculated by the fchf and mp approaches with the experimental data taken from nist .",
    "the calculated oss are shown for the length gauge for the single - photon transitions among the first few triplet states : @xmath156 , @xmath157 , @xmath158 , @xmath159 , and @xmath160 .",
    "again , the overall agreement is quite good between our results and the experimental values .",
    "therefore in what follows we present numerical tdse results using the the atomic basis calculated by the fchfp only .    having checked the accuracy of the atomic basis for the triplet states , we are now ready to perform the time integration of eq .",
    "( [ eq : c - tdse ] ) under various intensities for both lp and cp laser pulses .",
    "recall that a number of @xmath161 two - electron states for each total angular momentum up to @xmath130 was used for the numerical integration of tdse , thus leading to a total number of @xmath162 coupled differential equation to be solved .",
    "please note that the typical size of the dipole matrices is about @xmath163 .",
    "the runge - kutta subroutines were used to perform the numerical integration of tdse .",
    "as we have already mentioned , our initial state is @xmath164 ( @xmath118 ) and the photon energy is 2.7 ev which can be obtained from the second harmonic of a ti : sapphire laser .",
    "since the energy difference from @xmath164 to the ionization threshold is about 4.93 ev , at least two photons are needed for ionization .",
    "the intensity range we have considered for the numerical calculations is from @xmath165 w/@xmath13 up to @xmath166 w/@xmath13 .",
    "the keldysh parameter @xmath167 is @xmath168 at @xmath166 w/@xmath13 .",
    "the last check we should perform is that we may neglect the entire singlet states when we solve the tdse for the triplet states .",
    "this check is particularly important , since our photon energy ( 2.7 ev ) is resonant with the spin - forbidden @xmath169 - @xmath170 transition . because we can not calculate the dipole matrix elements for spin - forbidden transitions within the method we use , we have taken the experimental os for the spin - forbidden @xmath169 - @xmath170 transition , @xmath171 a.u .",
    "from nist , which is at least five and six orders of magnitude smaller than those for the ( nearest ) @xmath172 and @xmath173 transitions , respectively . by phenomenologically including this spin - forbidden @xmath169 - @xmath170 transition as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] , we now solve two sets of tdses for the singlet and triplet series which are coupled through the resonant but very weak spin - forbidden @xmath173 transition . after solving the two sets of tdses , we have ensured that , provided the @xmath170 initial state , the influence of the singlet states is extremely small as we expected , and we have safely neglected them in the following numerical calculations .      the ionization yield is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig4](a ) with a log - log scale as a function of peak intensity for the lp ( solid ) and rcp ( dashed ) pulses . for the photon energy @xmath174 ev we have chosen ,",
    "both curves have a linear dependence on the peak intensity , up to @xmath175 w/@xmath13 , with a slope of 1.9 , indicating that our results agree well with the prediction of lowest - order perturbation theory ( lopt ) . for peak intensities",
    "higher than @xmath176 w/@xmath13 , saturation starts to take place .",
    "figure [ fig4](b ) presents the ratio between the ionization yield by the cp and lp pulses , @xmath177 , as a function of peak intensity . for peak intensities up to @xmath175 w/@xmath178 ,",
    "the ionization yield by the rcp pulse is about 0.83 times smaller than that by the lp pulse .",
    "figures [ fig4](a ) and [ fig4](b ) also suggest that ionization by the lp pulse is more efficient than the rcp pulse when ionization starts from the @xmath0 @xmath18 initial state .",
    "this result is somehow different from our previous time - dependent calculations for multiphoton ionization of mg @xcite : it showed that , when less than four photons are needed for ionization , ionization from the singlet state with @xmath121 symmetry by the cp field starts to become more efficient than that by the lp field for a wide range of photon energy .",
    "in the lopt regime the main reason that the ionization yield by the cp pulse is larger or smaller than by the lp pulse , for a non - resonant photon energy , is determined by the particular values of the total angular momentum and its projection on the quantization axis .      in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] we present representative results of the pes by the lp ( solid ) and rcp ( dashed ) pulses at the peak intensity of @xmath179 w/@xmath13 . as it goes to the higher orders of above threshold ionization ( ati ) , the height of the ati peaks by the lp pulse is more than one order of magnitude larger than that by the rcp pulse .",
    "of course , this could be qualitatively understood that photoionization by the lp pulse has more chance to be near resonance with bound states than the cp pulse , and in addition there are more accessible continua for the lp pulse .",
    "it is interesting to note that subpeaks appear between the main ati peaks , labeled as ( b ) and ( c ) , for both lp and rcp pulses , and the height of the subpeaks is at least 5 orders of magnitude smaller than that of the main peaks .",
    "in addition there are small subpeaks , labeled as ( a ) , on the right - side shoulders of the main peaks for both lp and rcp pulses .",
    "these results are reminiscent of the subpeaks studied in our recent paper for the singlet states of mg @xcite , in which multiphoton ionization of mg from the singlet ground state has been theoretically studied . in that paper",
    "the origin of the subpeaks is clearly attributed to the bound states @xmath180 @xmath181 @xmath182 which are far off - resonantly excited by the spectral wing of the pulse . in the next subsection we will identify the origin of the subpeaks in pes in a similar manner .",
    "figures [ fig6](a)-[fig6](c ) show the variation of the pes for three different pulse durations , ( a ) @xmath183 fs , ( b ) @xmath184 fs , and ( c ) @xmath185 fs ( fwhm ) .",
    "the photon energy and peak intensity are @xmath186 ev and @xmath187 w/@xmath188 , respectively .",
    "as the pulse duration decreases the ati peaks are broadened and their heights are decreased .",
    "besides , the subpeaks gradually disappear because of the broadening of the fourier bandwidth of the shorter pulse .",
    "the method we have used to identify the origin of the subpeaks in the pes mentioned in the previous subsection is quite similar to the one employed in our previous work @xcite for singlet states of mg : if the subpeaks arise from some photoionization processes involving four or five photons to leave the ionic core in some excited state , the height of the subpeaks with respect to the main peaks would be even much smaller than those in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] at the peak intensity of @xmath189 w/@xmath13 , assuming the typical excitation / ionization efficiency with four or five photons .",
    "the subpeaks can not be attributed to some intensity - dependent effects , either ; the ponderomotive shift is as small as 0.098 ev at peak intensity @xmath189 w/@xmath13 , and there are no triplet states coming into resonance during the pulse duration for both lp and cp pulses .",
    "perhaps the subpeaks originate from the _ off - resonant excitations _ of some bound states , which , however , must be confirmed by the numerical calculations .",
    "since we propagate the tdse on the atomic basis , we can easily check this by solving the tdse after the removal of the particular bound state under suspect , and comparing the pes with the original one with all states included @xcite .",
    "[ fig7](a)-[fig7](c ) we summarize the results for the pes calculated with the lp pulse at the peak intensity of @xmath189 w/@xmath13 .",
    "they are the results obtained after the removal of a particular bound state , namely ( a ) @xmath152 @xmath190 , ( b ) @xmath191 @xmath190 , and ( c ) @xmath192 @xmath190 , upon solving the tdse , and compared with the result with the complete calculation of pes including all atomic triplet states of mg .",
    "when the @xmath152 @xmath190 state is removed [ fig .",

    "the laser detuning is 0.53 ev with respect to the @xmath0 @xmath18 state .",
    "that is , the small spike , located at 1.02 ev , corresponds to the single - photon ionization process from the off - resonantly excited @xmath152 @xmath190 state .",

    "in conclusion , we have theoretically studied multiphoton ionization of mg from the triplet @xmath0 @xmath18 state by linearly and circularly polarized fs pulses . for that purpose",
    "we have first constructed the atomic basis with @xmath66dependent dipole matrix elements for two active electrons , and then solved time - dependent schrdinger equations with them . since the spin - orbit interaction is rather weak for the mg atom , @xmath66dependent dipole matrix elements obtained by only taking into account the geometric ( angular ) part of the wave functions result in rather accurate values and compare well with the existing theoretical and experimental data . for the time - dependent calculations for multiphoton ionization from the triplet @xmath0 @xmath18 state , the photon energy we have specifically chosen is 2.7 ev and corresponds to the @xmath197 transition which is spin - forbidden and extremely weak .",
    "we have ensured that , even for the resonant photon energy , the singlet states do not influence the photoionization process .",
    "the ionization yields have been found to be larger for the linearly polarized pulse than for the circularly polarized pulse . since the mg atom has a rather rich level structure , the photoelectron energy spectra exhibits subpeaks in addition to the ordinary main ati peaks .",
    "we have clarified the source of those subpeaks as ati originating from some triplet bound states which are far off - resonantly excited by the spectral wing of the pulse .",
