    "a good way to proceed in understanding the construction , operation , and physics output from current high - energy heavy ion experiments is to start with the original physics motivations for the experimental program .",
    "the relativistic heavy ion collider project was started in the 1980 s with a list of experimental observables for characterizing hot and dense quark and gluonic matter and the expected restoration of approximate chiral symmetry and screening of the long range confining potential of qcd .",
    "we give a brief and certainly not complete review of these physics signals .",
    "then we discuss some of the cost , schedule and technology constraints that impacted the design and construction of the rhic experiments .",
    "finally we present a sample of the first results from the rhic experimental program from data taken during run i in the summer of 2000 .",
    "there are three main categories of observables that were originally proposed to study the matter produced in relativistic heavy ion collisions : ( 1 ) thermodynamic properties of the system and indications of a possible first or second order phase transition between hadronic matter and quark - gluon plasma , ( 2 ) signatures for the restoration of approximate chiral symmetry transition , and ( 3 ) signatures for deconfinement and the screening of the long range confining potential between color charges . in the following list",
    ", there will be specific channels that need to be observed that essentially specify the types of detectors and experiments necessary .",
    "one of the most important question in the physics of heavy - ion collisions is thermalization .",
    "we want to describe the system in terms of a few thermodynamic properties , otherwise it is not possible to discuss an equation - of - state and a true order to any associated phase transitions .",
    "the use of thermodynamic concepts to multi - particle production has a long history .",
    "one of the first to apply them in elementary collisions was hagedorn in the early 1960 s @xcite .",
    "the concept of a _ temperature _ applies strictly speaking only to systems in at least local thermal equilibrium .",
    "thermalization is normally only thought to occur in the transverse degrees of freedom as reflected in the lorentz invariant distributions of particles .",
    "the measured hadron spectra contain two pieces of information : _",
    "( i ) _ their normalization , _",
    "i.e. _  their yields ratios , provide the chemical composition of the fireball at the chemical freeze - out point where the hadron abundances freeze - out and _ ( ii ) _ their transverse momentum spectra which provides information about thermalization of the momentum distributions and collective flow .",
    "the latter is caused by thermodynamic pressure and reflects the integrated equation of state of the fireball matter .",
    "it is obvious that the observed particle spectra do not reflect earlier conditions , _",
    "i.e. _ the hot and dense deconfined phase , where chemical and thermal equilibrium may have been established , since re - scattering erases most traces from the dense phase .",
    "nevertheless , those which are accumulative during the expansion , such as flow , remain",
    ". only direct photons , either real photons or virtual photons that split into lepton pairs , escape the system without re - scattering . thus these electromagnetic probes yield information on the earliest thermodynamic state which may be dominated by intense quark - quark scattering",
    ".    the assumption of a locally thermalized source in chemical equilibrium can be tested by using statistical thermal models to describe the ratios of various emitted particles .",
    "this yields a baryon chemical potential @xmath0 , a strangeness saturation factor @xmath1 , and the temperature @xmath2 at chemical freeze - out .",
    "so far these models are very successful in describing particle ratios at sps @xcite and now also at rhic @xcite . at rhic the derived chemical freeze - out temperature are found to be around 175 mev ( 165 mev at sps ) and a baryon chemical potential of around 45 mev ( 270 mev at sps ) .",
    "it should be stressed that these models assume thermal equilibration but their success together with the large collective flow ( radial and elliptic ) measured at rhic is a strong hint that this picture indeed applies .",
    "the phase transition to a quark - gluon plasma is expected to be associated with a strong change in the chiral condensate , often referred to as the restoration of approximate chiral symmetry in relativistic heavy ion collisions is discussed here .",
    "note that although many in the field refer to the restoration of chiral symmetry , the system always breaks chiral symmetry at a small scale due to the non - zero neutral current masses of the up and down quarks .",
    "there are multiple signatures of this transition , including disoriented chiral condensates ( dcc ) , strangeness enhancement , and many others .",
    "however , the most promising signature is the in medium modification to the mass and width of the low mass vector mesons .",
    "nature has provided an excellent set of probes in the various low mass vector meson states ( @xmath3 , @xmath4 , @xmath5 ) whose mass poles and spectra are dynamically determined via the collisions of hadrons or partons . if the hot and dense state produced in heavy ion collisions",
    "is composed of nearly massless partons , the @xmath3(770 ) meson mass distribution is expected to broaden significantly and shift to lower values of invariant mass .",
    "the @xmath3 meson has a lifetime that is @xmath6 and the plasma state created in rhic collisions has a lifetime of order 10 fm/@xmath7 .",
    "thus , the @xmath3 meson is created and decays many times during the entire time evolution of the collision .",
    "the @xmath3 has a dominant decay ( nearly 100% ) into two pions .",
    "however , in this decay mode if the pions suffer re - scattering with other hadrons after the decay , one can not experimentally reconstruct the @xmath3 meson and information is lost .",
    "given the dense , either partonic or hadronic environment , the probability for pion re - scattering is very large , unless the @xmath3 is created and decays at the latest stages of the time evolution .",
    "this time period is often referred to as thermal freeze - out , when elastic collisions cease .",
    "thus a measurement of the @xmath3 as reconstructed via its pion decay channel gives interesting information on the final hadronic stage , but not on the dense phase where chiral symmetry may be restored .",
    "there is an additional decay channel into electron pairs and muon pairs , though with small branching ratios of @xmath8 and @xmath9 , respectively .",
    "since the leptons do not interact strongly , after they are produced , they exit the dense system essentially unaffected carrying out crucial information from the core of the system .",
    "there is a good analogy in understanding the processes in the center of the sun via neutrino emission , since only neutrinos have a small enough interaction cross - section to pass out of the sun s core largely unaffected . in the case of neutrinos ,",
    "the more interesting physics of possible neutrino oscillations complicates matters , but that is not a concern in the case of our electron and muons measurements .",
    "one other additional point of interest is that the apparent branching ratio of the @xmath3 into pions and leptons should be modified as observed by experiment .",
    "the @xmath3 mesons that decay in medium into pions are not reconstructed , but the ones decaying into electrons are . if one can reconstruct the @xmath3 in both channels one can gauge the number of lifetimes of the @xmath3 the dense medium survives for .",
    "the lifetime of the @xmath3 meson in the rest frame of the plasma depends on its gamma boost in this frame , and thus to study the earliest stages , a measurement of low transverse momentum @xmath3 mesons is desirable .",
    "if the @xmath3 decays at rest in the plasma frame , the maximum transverse momentum for the electron or positron is @xmath10 .",
    "these electrons are considered low and present an experimental challenge to measure for two reasons .",
    "first , there are a large number of low momentum charged pions created in these collisions , that results in a charged pion to electron ratio in this  range of @xmath11 .",
    "thus one needs detectors that can cleanly identify electrons with good momentum resolution , while rejecting the copiously produced pions .",
    "the second challenge is that most of the electrons come from pion dalitz decays ( @xmath12 ) , @xmath13 dalitz decays ( @xmath14 ) , and conversions of photons ( @xmath15 ) mostly resulting from @xmath16 decays .",
    "ideally one wants to reject these other electrons to enhance the signal contribution from the low mass vector mesons .",
    "conversions are reduced by reducing the amount of material in the path of produced photons .",
    "this restriction is often at odds with the desire to have substantial inner tracking detectors and these needs must be balanced .",
    "the @xmath5(1020 ) meson spectral function is also sensitive to in - medium chiral symmetry restoration ; however its substantially longer lifetime @xmath17 means that most @xmath5 decays occur outside the medium .",
    "however , measuring the @xmath5 in its various decay modes ( kaon pairs , electron pairs , muon pairs ) remains an interesting signal at low transverse momentum .",
    "these low mass vector mesons also decay into muons pairs .",
    "these muons have low momentum and are an real experimental challenge to measure as detailed later in these proceedings .",
    "there are many signatures that result from the deconfinement of color charges over an extended volume , often referred to as the quark - gluon plasma .",
    "two are detailed in this proceedings : ( 1 ) suppression of heavy quarkonium states and ( 2 ) parton energy loss via gluon emission , also referred to as jet quenching .",
    "the suppression of heavy quarkonium states was originally proposed by matsui and satz @xcite in the late 1980 s as a signature for color deconfinement .",
    "the debye screening in a qed plasma is a reasonable analogue for the scenario in our qcd plasma .",
    "a charm - anticharm ( @xmath18 ) quark pair produced via gluon fusion in the initial phase of the heavy ion collision can form a @xmath19 if the pair has low relative momentum .",
    "the total production of such states in proton - proton collisions relative to the total charm production is less than a few percent .",
    "if the debye screening length is of order the same size as the quarkonium state , then the pair is screened .",
    "the charm and anticharm quark scatter away from each other and , eventually at the hadronization point , pair with surrounding light quarks and antiquarks to form @xmath20 mesons .",
    "this color screening is displayed in recent lattice qcd calculations described at this workshop in terms of a modification in the linear rise at large distances of the qcd potential .",
    "this change in the qcd potential as a function of temperature is shown in fig .",
    "[ karsch - confine ] .    ,",
    "scaledwidth=90.0% ]    there are a variety of heavy vector mesons with a large range in binding energy ( and associated hadronic size ) .",
    "the @xmath19 , @xmath21 , and @xmath22 have binding energies of 0.64 , 0.20 , and 0.05 gev respectively .",
    "the @xmath23 , @xmath24 , @xmath25 , @xmath26 , and @xmath27 have binding energies of 1.10 , 0.67 , 0.54 , 0.31 , 0.20 gev respectively .",
    "since the suppression of these states is determined by the relative plasma temperature and the binding energy ( or by the quarkonium hadronic size and the debye screening length ) , measuring the sequential disappearance of these states acts as a qcd thermometer .",
    "the @xmath19(1s ) state decays into almost anything hadronic with a large branching ratio of 87.7% .",
    "however , the experimentally accessible decay channels are 5.93% to @xmath28 and 5.88% to @xmath29 .",
    "similar decay channels are available for the @xmath22 and the @xmath30 states .",
    "the accessible decay channel of the @xmath21 for heavy ion experiments is @xmath31 with a branching ratio @xmath32 .",
    "since the decay @xmath33 is quite soft , the @xmath21 represents an experimental challenge .",
    "similar to the low mass vector mesons there is interest in these states at low transverse momentum , where they reside in the plasma state longer . at rest",
    "the @xmath19 decays into electrons or muons with a characteristic @xmath34 gev .",
    "a rough rate estimate ( good to a factor of 2 - 3 ) is that the production of @xmath19 is approximately @xmath35 per proton - proton collision . in a central au - au collision , there are of order 800 binary collisions , yielding a @xmath19 rate of @xmath36",
    ". the branching ratio to electrons is 5.9% and a typical experimental acceptance is 1% , yielding @xmath37 @xmath19 per au - au central collision , and that is assuming no anomalous suppression !",
    "hence , one requires a detector that measures either electron or muon pairs with a high efficiency and a trigger and data acquisition system capable of sampling events at the full rhic design luminosity .",
    "in particular , if one wants to bin the data in terms of @xmath38 , , and collision centrality , large statistics are a requirement .",
    "there is a recent proposal for @xmath19 enhancement .",
    "this scenario assumes copious charm prodcution , and then at the hadronization stage some charm and anticharm quarks may be close in both momentum and configuration space .",
    "these @xmath18 pairs may coalesce to form @xmath19 .",
    "this late stage production would potentially mask any suppression in the early stages from color screening .",
    "there is an easy test of this theory .",
    "when rhic runs at lower energies , for example @xmath39 gev , instead of the maximum energy of @xmath40 gev , the charm production is lower by a factor of approximately three and the effect of recombination should be reduced substantially . in addition , we expect different  dependence of @xmath19 production from original hard processes compared with late stage @xmath18 coalescence",
    ".      an ideal experiment would be to contain the quark - gluon plasma , and send well calibrated probes through it , and measure the resulting transparency or opacity of the system .",
    "there is no experimental way of aiming a third beam of particle at the collision .",
    "therefore any probes of the system must be generated in the collision itself .",
    "these probes must have calculable production rates in order to be considered calibrated .",
    "an excellent example of such a probe is a hard scattered parton .",
    "a parton traversing a color confined medium of hadrons sees a relatively transparent system .",
    "however , a parton passing through a hot colored deconfined medium will lose substantial energy via gluon radiation@xcite .",
    "the source of these partons is from hard scattering processes producing back - to - back parton jets . in a deconfined medium",
    "the parton will lose energy before escaping the system and fragmenting into a jet cone of hadrons .",
    "the total energy of the initial parton jet is conserved since eventually the radiated gluons will also hadronize .",
    "it is likely that the radiated gluons will have a larger angular dispersion than the normally measured jet cone .",
    "thus one might be able to measure a modification in the apparent jet shape .",
    "when the parton fragments into hadrons it has less energy , and hence the fragmentation will result in a much reduced energy for the leading hadron .",
    "a measurement of high transverse momentum hadrons ( @xmath41 ) is a strong indicator of the opacity of the medium .",
    "an exciting additional observable was mentioned at the workshop in the context of the high  spectra of charm @xmath20 mesons .",
    "there is a reduction in the induced gluon radiation for charm and bottom quarks relative to light quarks due to their slower velocity through the medium .",
    "the scope of the rhic program is to operate a colliding beam facility which allows studies of phenomena in ultra - relativistic heavy - ion collisions and in collisions of polarized protons .",
    "the collider is located in the northwest section of the brookhaven national laboratory ( bnl ) in upton , new york .",
    "its construction began in 1991 and the completion of the complex was accomplished in spring 2000 .",
    "the collider , which consists of two concentric rings of 1740 super - conducting magnets , was constructed in an already existing ring tunnel of @xmath42 km circumference .",
    "this tunnel was originally constructed for the proposed isabelle project .",
    "it offers an extraordinary combination of energy , luminosity and polarization . a schematic diagram of the whole rhic complex , including the various facilities used to produce and pre - accelerate the beams of particles is displayed in figure  [ fig : rhicoverview ] .",
    "rhic is able to accelerate and store counter - rotating beams of ions ranging from those of gold to protons at the top energy of 100 gev / nucleon for gold and 250 gev for protons .",
    "the stored beam lifetime for gold in the energy range of 30 to 100 gev / nucleon is expected to be approximately 10 hours .",
    "the major performance parameters are summarized in figure  [ fig : rhicparameters ] .",
    "the layout of the tunnel and the magnet configuration allow the two rings to intersect at six locations along their circumference .",
    "the top kinetic energy is 100 + 100 gev / nucleon for gold ions .",
    "the operational momentum increases with the charge - to - mass ratio , resulting in kinetic energy of 125 gev / nucleon for lighter ions and 250 gev for protons .",
    "the collider is able to operate a wide range from injection to top energies .",
    "the collider is designed for a au - au luminosity of about @xmath43 @xmath44 s@xmath45 at top energy .",
    "this design corresponds to approximately 1400 au - au minimum bias collisions per second .",
    "the luminosity is energy dependent and decreases approximately proportionally as the operating energy decreases . for lighter ions",
    "it is significantly higher reaching @xmath46 @xmath44 s@xmath45 for pp collisions .",
    "the collider allows collisions of beams of equal ion species all the way down to pp and of unequal species such as protons on gold ions .",
    "another unique aspect of rhic is the ability to collide beams of polarized protons ( 70 - 80% ) which allows the measurement of the spin structure functions for the sea quarks and gluons .",
    "the first physics run at the relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) took place in the summer of 2000 . for this run beam energies",
    "were kept to a moderate 65 agev .",
    "rhic attained its goal of ten percent of design luminosity by the end of its first run at the collision center - of - mass energy of  = 130 gev .    in the following",
    "we describe briefly the various facilities , depicted in figure  [ fig : rhicoverview ] , that are part of the large rhic complex :    tandem van de graaff : :    completed in 1970 , the tandem van de graaff facility was for many    years",
    "the world s largest electrostatic accelerator facility",
    ". it can    provide beams of more than 40 different types of ions ranging from    hydrogen to uranium .",
    "the facility consists of two 15 mv electrostatic    accelerators , each about 24 meters long , aligned end-to-end.in the    tandem the atoms are stripped of some of their electrons ( e.g. au to q    = + 32 ) and accelerated to a kinetic energy of 1 mev / nucleon .",
    "heavy ion transfer line ( hitl ) : :    to study heavy ion collisions at high energies , a 700 meter - long    tunnel and beam transport system called the heavy ion transport line    were completed in 1986 , allowing the delivery of heavy ions from the    tandem to the booster for further acceleration . the hitl makes it    possible for the tandem to serve as the relativistic heavy ion    collider s ions source .",
    "linear accelerator ( linac ) : :    for the study of pp or pa collisions at the experiments , energetic    protons are supplied by an linear accelerator ( linac ) . the brookhaven    linear accelerator was designed and built in the late 1960 s as a    major upgrade to the alternating gradient synchroton ( ags ) complex .",
    "the basic components of the linac include ion sources , a    radiofrequency quadrapole pre - injector , and nine accelerator    radiofrequency cavities spanning the length of a 150 m tunnel .",
    "the    linac is capable of producing up to a 35 milliampere proton beam at    energies up to 200 mev for injection into the ags booster .",
    "booster : :    the alternating gradient synchrotron booster is less than one quarter    the size of the ags .",
    "it is used to preaccelerate particles entering    the ags ring and plays an important role in the operation of the    relatavistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) by accepting heavy ions from    the tandem van de graaff facility via the heavy ion transfer line    ( hitl ) and protons from the linac .",
    "it then feeds them to the ags for    further acceleration and delivery to rhic . after the installation of    the hitl in 1986 ,",
    "the ags was capable of accelerating ions up to    silicon with its atomic mass of 28 .",
    "however , due to its superior    vacuum , the booster makes it possible for the ags to accelerate and    deliver heavy ions up to gold with its atomic mass of 197 .",
    "ags : :    since 1960 , the alternating gradient synchrotron ( ags ) has been one of    the world s premiere particle accelerators and played a major role in    the study of relativistic heavy ion collisions in the last decade .",
    "the    ags name is derived from the concept of alternating gradient focusing ,    in which the field gradients of the accelerator s 240 magnets are    successively alternated inward and outward , permitting particles to be    propelled and focused in both the horizontal and vertical plane at the    same time . among its other duties , the ags is now used as an injector    for the relativistic heavy ion collider . for rhic operation",
    "the fully    stripped ions are accelerated in the ags to 9 gev / nucleon before    ejection .",
    "atr : :    the ags sends the ions ( or protons ) down another beamline called the    ags - to - rhic transfer line ( atr ) . at the end of this line , there s a    `` fork in the road '' , where sorting magnets separate the ion bunches .    from here , the counter - rotating beams circulate in the rhic where they    are collided at one of four intersecting points .",
    "in july 1991 there were a set of experimental letters of intent that were put forward to an advisory committee .",
    "the proposals are listed below , including the lead institution and in parenthesis the physics observable focus .",
    "1 .   lbl - tpc ( inclusive charged hadrons ) 2 .",

    "mit mars ( hadrons and particle correlations )    the experiments span the range of hadronic , leptonic and photonic capabilities to cover the broad spectrum of physics topics listed above . at the time ,",
    "only the lbl - tpc proposal was approved and became the star experiment .",
    "eventually the mars proposal evolved into the phobos experiment ( note that phobos is a moon of the planet mars ) and phenix ( should be spelled phoenix ) rose from the ashes of oasis , di - muon , tales and the other lepton focussed experiments .    eventually there were four approved experiments which have now been constructed and operated during the first year of rhic running .",
    "brahms , phenix , phobos and star are briefly described below .",
    "these experiments have various approaches to study the deconfinement phase transition to the quark gluon plasma .",
    "the star experiment @xcite concentrates on measurements of hadron production over a large solid angle in order to measure single- and multi - particle spectra and to study global observables on an event - by - event basis .",
    "the phenix experiment @xcite focuses on measurements of lepton and photon production and has the capability of measuring hadrons in a limited range of azimuth and pseudo - rapidity .",
    "the two smaller experiments brahms ( a forward and mid - rapidity hadron spectrometer ) @xcite and phobos ( a compact multiparticle spectrometer ) @xcite focus on single- and multi - particle spectra .",
    "the collaborations , which have constructed these detector systems and which will exploit their physics capabilities , consist of approximately 900 scientists from over 80 institutions internationally .",
    "in addition to colliding heavy ion beams , rhic will collide polarized protons to study the spin content of the proton @xcite .",
    "star and phenix are actively involved in the spin physics program planned for rhic .",
    "the * * br**oad * * r**ange * * h**adron * * m**agnetic * * s**pectrometer brahms experiment is designed to measure and identify charged hadrons ( @xmath47 , k@xmath48 , @xmath49 ) over a wide range of rapidity and transverse momentum for all beams and energies available at rhic . because the conditions and thus the detector requirements at mid - rapidity and forward angles are different , the experiment uses two movable spectrometers for the two regions .",
    "as shown in figure  [ fig : brahms ] , there is a mid - rapidity spectrometer to cover the pseudo - rapidity range @xmath50 and a forward spectrometer to cover @xmath51 .",
    "the latter employs four dipole magnets , three time projection chambers ( tpc ) , and drift chambers .",

    "the spectrometer has two tpcs for tracking , a magnet for momentum measurement , and a time - of - flight wall and segmented gas cherenkov counter ( gasc ) for particle identification .",
    "it has a solid angle acceptance of 7 mstr .",
    "a set of beam counters and a silicon multiplicity array provide the experiment with trigger information and vertex determination .",
    "the phobos detector is designed to detect as many of the produced particles as possible and to allow a momentum measurement down to very low .",
    "the setup consists of two parts : a multiplicity detector covering almost the entire pseudo - rapidity range of the produced particles and a two arm spectrometer at mid - rapidity .",
    "figure [ fig : phobos ] shows the detector , including the spectrometer arms , the multiplicity and vertex array , and the lower half of the magnet .",
    "one aspect of the design is that all detectors are produced using a common technology , namely as silicon pad or strip detectors .",
    "the multiplicity detector covers the range @xmath53 , measuring total charged multiplicity dn@xmath54/d@xmath13 over almost the entire phase space . for approximately 1% of the produced particles , information on momentum and particle identification will be provided by a two arm spectrometer located on either side of the interaction volume ( only one arm was installed for the 2000 run ) .",
    "each arm covers about 0.4 rad in azimuth and one unit of pseudo - rapidity in the range @xmath55 , depending on the interaction vertex , allowing the measurement of p@xmath56 down to 40 mev/@xmath7 .",
    "both detectors are capable of handling the 600 hz minimum bias rate expected for all collisions at the nominal luminosity .",
    "the phenix experiment is specifically designed to measure electrons , muons , hadrons and photons .",
    "the experiment is capable of handling high event rates , up to ten times rhic design luminosity , in order to sample rare signals such as the @xmath19 decaying into muons and electrons , high transverse momentum @xmath16 s , direct photons , and others .",
    "the detector consists of four spectrometer arms .",
    "two central arms have a small angular coverage around central rapidity and consist of a silicon vertex detector , drift chamber , pixel pad chamber , ring imaging cerenkov counter , a time - expansion chamber , time - of - flight and an electromagnetic calorimeter .",
    "these detectors allow for electron identification over a broad range of momenta in order to measure both low mass and high mass vector mesons .",
    "two forward spectrometers are used for the detection of muons .",

    "the overall layout of the phenix detector is shown in figure  [ phenix - detector ] .",
    "one key feature of the phenix detector is the high rate capability of the data acquisition system ( daq ) and multi - level trigger architecture .",
    "these allow phenix to sample physics from rhic collisions above the design luminosity of the machine .",
    "this high rate is crucial for studying rare leptonic , photonic and high processes .",

    "the layout of the star experiment is shown in figure  [ fig : star ] .",
    "the initial configuration of star in 2000 consists of a large time projection chamber ( tpc ) covering @xmath57 , a ring imaging cherenkov detector covering @xmath58 and @xmath59 , and trigger detectors inside a solenoidal magnet with 0.25 t magnetic field .",
    "the solenoid provides a uniform magnetic field of maximum strength 0.5 t for tracking , momentum analysis and particle identification via ionization energy loss measurements in the tpc .",
    "measurements in the tpc were carried out at mid - rapidity with full azimuthal coverage ( @xmath60 ) and symmetry .",
    "a total of 1 m minimum bias and 1 m central events were recorded during the summer run 2000 .",
    "additional tracking detectors will be added for the run in 2001 .",
    "these are a silicon vertex tracker ( svt ) covering @xmath61 and two forward tpcs ( ftpc ) covering @xmath62 . the electromagnetic calorimeter ( emc )",
    "will reach approximately 20% of its eventual @xmath63 and @xmath60 coverage and will allow the measurement of high transverse momentum photons and particles .",
    "the endcap emc will be constructed and installed over the next 2  3 years .",
    "the design of both the star and phenix experiments includes a polarized proton program to conduct studies of the spin structure of the proton .",
    "critical to this measurement is the identification of high transverse momentum photons and leptons .",
    "the star experiment is phasing in an electromagnetic calorimeter that will be crucial for such observations .",

    "there are many reasons to measure electrons over a broad range in transverse momentum . in the original letters of intent",
    "there were many different proposals for detector technologies for measuring electrons , and many of these capabilities were combined into the phenix experiment .",
    "the phenix experiment has two central spectrometer arms each covering 90 degrees in @xmath5 and @xmath106 .",
    "electrons and also charged hadrons that are produced near mid - rapidity are bent in an axial magnetic field over a radial distance of approximately two meters after which the aperture is relatively field free .",
    "there is a large aperture drift chamber that measures the projective trajectory of the charged particle tracks in the field free region with multiple wire layers oriented in the x direction ( giving maximum resolution in the bend plane of the field ) and also in u and v direction ( stereo planes for pattern recognition ) .",
    "the drift chamber is augmented by a series of moderate resolution pad chambers , which yield three dimensional space point along the particle s track and aid significantly in pattern recognition and non - vertex background rejection .",
    "as shown in figure  [ phenix : magnet2 ] the particle track is characterized by an angle ( @xmath107 ) in the bend plane of the magnetic field . from this vector and the assumption that the track originated at the au - au collision vertex",
    ", the rigidity of the track is determined .",
    "the rigidity is the momentum divided by the particle charge , and with the assumption of a @xmath108 particle , the momentum is known .",
    "typically the momentum resolution has two components as shown below . @xmath109}\\ ] ] the first term , typically of order 1% is due to the multiple scattering of the charge particle in material before and in the tracking devices .",
    "the second term which scales with the particle s momentum is related to the finite spatial resolution of the detector .",
    "the phenix detector has been designed with a minimum of inner region material including a beryllium beam pipe , which has a low z value to minimize multiple scattering while maintaining integrity for the vacuum .",
    "all four experiments at rhic have be beam - pipes in the interaction region .",
    "the phenix design resolution from the drift chamber is of order 0.5% at @xmath110 gev and increases linearly with  above 0.7 gev .",
    "there is a great deal of work involved in calibrations and wire alignement to achieve these resolution values .",
    "it is notable that phenix uses an axial field magnet for the central spectrometers as opposed to a solenoidal field .",
    "there are substantial advantages and disadvantages to this choice .",
    "one major consideration is that if the entire experiment is contained inside a large solenoid , as in the star configuration , the magnetic field is present throughout the volume .",
    "this is advantageous for the large volume time projection chamber ( tpc ) of star where they can observe the curvature of the charged particle tracks .",
    "however , the cost of these magnets increases steeply as one increased the desired outer radius .",
    "phenix for the purposes of hadron particle identification wanted to have a time - of - flight scintillator wall approximately 5 meters from the interaction vertex and for electron and photon identification a good energy resolution and high granularity electromagnetic calorimeter behind that . in keeping within the experimental budget",
    "it would not have been possible to have a solenoidal magnet with an outer radius greater than 5.5 meters .",
    "the alice experiment being built for the cern - lhc program is fortunate to be able to re - use the very large solenoid from the l3 experiment at lep .",
    "one disadvantage of the phenix choice is that the pole tips of the axial field magnet are close to the interaction point and create substantial `` shine '' , particles scattering off the poles into the detector aperture .",
    "the overall choice for the field configuration is an important starting point for many detector designs .",
    "now that we have characterized the particle s momentum vector , we must discriminate all of the charged pions from our interesting electrons .",
    "the first detector in phenix that is employed is a ring imaging cherenkov detector ( rich ) .",
    "it is a large gas volume detector with a thin mirror plane for reflecting cherenkov light onto an array of photo - multiplier tubes ( pmt ) that are situated off to the side of the spectrometer acceptance .",
    "the radiator gas used is either ethane with an index of refraction n=1.00082 or methane with n=1.00044 . requiring more than three",
    "pmt hits yields almost 100% efficiency for electrons and rejects pions with @xmath111 gev at the level of @xmath112 in a single track environment .",
    "the detector , requiring only three pmt s , does not reconstruct a ring radius for further particle characterization , but rather is used as a threshold detector only .    in a multiple track collisions ( remember of order 5000",
    "charged particles are being produced ) one can incorrectly match a track to a rich signal .",
    "further electron identification is provided by the electromagnetic calorimeter ( emcal ) .",
    "the calorimeter is composed of both lead scintillator ( pbsc ) and lead glass ( pbgl ) modules , with the later being originally used in the wa98 experiment at the cern - sps heavy ion program .",
    "the calorimeter has a radiation length of @xmath113 and @xmath114 for the pbsc and pbgl respectively , but does not fully interact and contain hadronic showers .",
    "thus , an electron or photon incident on the calorimeter deposits most of its energy , while a hadron ( eg . charged pion ) has a large probability to pass through the module depositing a small @xmath105 minimum ionizing radiation energy .",
    "even when the pion suffers an inelastic collision in the calorimeter , only a fraction of its energy is contained and measured in the pmt at the back of the module . the excellent energy resolution @xmath115 and high granularity",
    "give precise electron identification and pion rejection by requiring the energy match the measured momentum ( @xmath116 ) .",
    "however , the background rejection degrades when the particle momentum is low and hadronic showers have a higher probability to match the measured momentum .",
    "therefore , an additional detector is necessary to help identify low  electrons for the crucial low mass vector meson physics . for this purpose",
    ", phenix uses a time expansion chamber ( tec ) that samples energy loss in a gas radiator .",
    "the tec determines the particle species using @xmath105 information .",
    "it has a rejection of @xmath117 for particles with a momentum p = 500  with p10 gas and 2% with xe gas , which is much more expensive .",
    "it is the combination of all these detectors that allow for efficient electron measurements with a minimum of pion contamination .",
    "thus , the challenge of electron identification over a broad range in  is met .",
    "direct muons and hadrons decaying into muons require a rather different experimental approach to measuring electrons , photons and other hadrons .",
    "muons interact with a low cross section in material , and are easiest to identify by placing steel or other material in the particle path and removing all other particles through interaction . then a detector placed after the steel should measure a clean muon sample .",
    "however , the muons must have a large enough energy to penetrate the steel without stopping due to ionization energy loss @xmath105 . in the central rapidity region at a collider , the muons from low @xmath19 decays make it impossible to have enough steel to range out other hadrons effectively , while allowing the muons to pass through . in particle experiments that focus on high  muons , the detector can consist of a similar one to that described above for electrons . after the calorimeter , one can have some steel absorber ( often the return in the magnet steel ) and then have a muon identifier detector outside of that .",
    "this design does not work well for heavy ion physics .",
    "first , it restricts the measurable  range at too high a value and also has a large background from low  pions decaying into muons .",
    "another option is to measure muons are forward rapidity where they have a substantial momentum in the longitudinal direction .",
    "phenix measures muons in the forward and backward pseudo - rapidity regions ( at angles of 10 - 35 degrees from the beam line ) .",
    "the detector consists of a brass and steel absorber to range out hadrons followed by a cathode strip chamber muon tracking device that measures the particle s bend in a magnetic field .",
    "there is a delicate balance in the amount and type of absorber material used .",
    "too much material and the multiple scattering reduces the resolution which is important for cleanly separating states such as @xmath19 and @xmath22 , and too little material in which case the particle occupancy in the tracking device is too large . after the muon tracking device",
    "there is more steel absorber with iarocci tube muon identifiers interspersed .",
    "the coverage is from @xmath118 and the muons must have @xmath119 gev in order to penetrate the absorber material .",
    "the identifier detectors also provide the necessary trigger information to sample the muons from the high luminosity rhic collisions .",
    "the most substantial background in measuring @xmath19 and @xmath20 mesons are muons from pions and kaons that decay before they hit the brass nose - cone absorbers .",
    "there is a competing requirement in phenix in that one wants the absorber as close to the interaction vertex as possible to reduce this decay contribution , but they need to be far enough apart for there to be a good acceptance for electrons , hadrons and photons in the two central arm spectrometers .",
    "there are many benefits to the comprehensive design of phenix , but there are definite drawbacks as well . of the two muon arms ,",
    "the south muon arm was completed for running in run ii at rhic , and the north arm will be complete for run iii .",
    "in this chapter we present the physics results from the run i data and a preview of expected results from run ii .      the first result with a measurement from all four rhic experiments is the charged particle multiplicity @xcite .",
    "the four experiments results for central ( small impact parameter ) collisions are in excellent agreement and are shown in figure  [ fig : charge ]",
    ". the multiplicity rises more sharply as a function of center - of - mass energy in heavy ion collisions than in @xmath120 and @xmath121 collisions , which is attributed to the increased probability for hard parton scattering in the thick nuclear target seen by each parton .     and @xmath121 collisions . a model of heavy ion collisions hijing",
    "is shown for comparison.,scaledwidth=75.0% ]    we expect the charge particle yield to increase for collisions of larger nuclei . however , at low x values , the high density of gluons may in fact saturate due to gluon fusion processes .",
    "the contribution to the yield from hard processes should exhibit point - like scaling ( scaling with the number of binary collisions ) and would thus scale as @xmath122 .",
    "however , parton saturation depends upon the nuclear size and would limit the growth of the number of produced partons as @xmath123 . if present , this initial parton saturation would limit the hard process contribution to the total charged particle multiplicity .    only one nuclear species ( au ) was accelerated in run i at rhic .",
    "thus , rather that changing the mass number @xmath124 directly we control the collision volume by varying the centrality or the number of participating nucleons for au - au collisions . shown in figure  [ fig : npart ] are the published results from the phenix @xcite and phobos @xcite experiments for the number of charged particles per participant nucleon pair as a function of the number of participating nucleons .",
    "the number of participating nucleons is determined in a slightly different manner by the different experiments . however , the general method is to calibrate the number of spectator nucleons (= @xmath125 - participant nucleons ) using a measurement of spectator neutrons in a set of zero degree calorimeters that are common to all experiments . by correlating the number of forward neutrons to the number of charged particle produced in the large pseudo - rapidity region ,",

    "results from the hijing model  @xcite are also shown which does not include parton saturation and thus has a more continuous rise in the particle multiplicity .",

    "in addition , heavy flavor ( charm and bottom ) and drell - yan production should be a sensitive probe to the initial parton density .",

    "in addition , it is believed that the density is substantially higher due to the potentially much shorter thermalization time in the higher parton density environment .",
    "if one achieves gluon saturation the formation time is of order 0.2 fm/@xmath7 and gives an estimated energy density of @xmath139 .",
    "there are even estimates of over @xmath140 , but they assume a very large drop in the final measured transverse energy due to work done in the longitudinal expansion of the system .",
    "all of these estimates are above the energy density of order @xmath141 corresponding to the phase transition temperature @xmath142 mev .",
    "the azimuthal anisotropy of the transverse momentum distribution for non - central collisions is thought to be sensitive to the early evolution of the system .",
    "the second fourier coefficient of this anisotropy , @xmath143 , is called elliptic flow @xcite .",

    "the spatial anisotropy is largest early in the evolution of the collision , but as the system expands and becomes more spherical , this driving force quenches itself .",

    "phobos has some capabilities to measure @xmath146 but only integrated over all . because of its restricted azimuthal coverage the phenix collaboration follows a different approach to reconstruct @xmath146 by studying the @xmath147 correlation between particles thus circumventing the event plane determination . however , work is still in progress and in the following we concentrate on the more direct event plane method used in star .",

    "the data are analyzed in the longitudinally co - moving source frame , in which the total longitudinal momentum of the pair ( collinear with the colliding beams ) is zero .",
    "as expected , larger sizes of the pion - emitting source are found for the more central ( _ i.e. _ decreasing impact parameter ) events , which in turn have higher pion multiplicities . this source size is observed to decrease with increasing transverse momentum of the pion pair . this dependence is similar to what has been observed at lower energies and is understood to be an effect of collective transverse flow . shown in figure  [ fig : hbt ] is the coherence parameter @xmath154 and the radius parameters r@xmath155 , r@xmath156 , and r@xmath157 obtained in the analysis . also shown",

    "in contrast , the cern - sps results show an enhancement that has been attributed to the cronin effect , or initial state parton scattering that gives a @xmath168 kick to the final transverse momentum distribution .",
    "this expected enhancement makes the suppression seen at rhic all the more striking .",
    "there are a number of open questions that must be considered before drawing any conclusions .",
    "the most basic is that these  values are low relative to where one might have confidence in the applicability of perturbative qcd calculations . in addition , the separation between soft and hard scale physics is blurred in this  range , and in fact the cern - sps ratio @xmath167 has also been explained in terms of hydrodynamic boosting of the soft physics to higher .",
    "the preliminary results from phenix on the ratios of @xmath169 in the middle of this  range look more like soft physics than a parton fragmentation function in vacuum .",
    "one additional point of concern is that these models of energy loss assume that the parton exits the collision region before finally fragmenting into a jet of forward hadrons .",
    "thus the final hadronization takes place in vacuum . in the  range of these early measurements ,",
    "that conclusion is not so clear .",
    "the parton is traveling through the medium with various @xmath168 scatters , and if it hadronizes inside a bath of other particles , the leading hadrons may be slowed down by inelastic collisions with co - moving pions .",
    "lastly , the point - like scaling is known to be violated due to the nuclear shadowing of parton distribution functions .",
    "these nuclear modifications are known to reduce the pdf for quarks of order 20% for @xmath170 ; however , the shadowing for gluons is not currently measured .",
    "the calculations of @xcite have included modeling of this shadowing , but must be viewed with caution at this time .",
    "these points need further theoretical investigation .",
    "in addition , as will be discussed in the next section , many of these concerns are reduced when the measurements extend to much higher transverse momentum .",
    "in the following chapter , we discuss a few select topics within our areas interest that have exciting results expected in the near future .      the measurement of open charm and bottom in relativistic heavy ion collions is both an extreme experimental challenge and rich with physics information .",
    "first , the measurement of quarkonium states such as the @xmath19 require a comparison measure of the original @xmath18 production to determine the effect of color screening .",
    "also , the total charm production is sensitive to the initial gluon density in the incoming nuclei and is thus sensitive to any shadowing of the gluon distribution function and may even comment on the possible color glass condensate postulated to describe the phase space saturated gluon distributions in the highly lorentz contracted nuclei .",
    "lastly , recent predictions of charm quark energy loss in tranversing a hot partonic medium have generated much interest .",
    "now for the difficult part .",
    "the best was to measure charm via d mesons is either via direct reconstruction from its @xmath171 decay mode or via the semi - leptonic decay @xmath172 .",
    "the combinatoric background in the purely hadronic channel are close to overwhelming and the semi - leptonic decay can not be completely reconstructed . in particle physics experiments measuring the decay products with a few micron displaced vertex from the collision",
    "vertex allows for a dramatic reduction in the combinatoric background .",
    "however , the level of silicon detector technology was not advanced enough for this very high multiplicity environment at the time of the rhic detector designs .",
    "this is now being discussed as a possible upgrade to the experiments .        one promising way of determining the charm production is through the measurement of single electrons . shown in figure",
    "[ fig : singlee ] is a simulation of single electrons as a function of transverse momentum . the top curve in the sum of all contributions . the next two curves that dominate the spectra at low @xmath173 gev and from the dalitz decays of pions and @xmath13 and from photon conversions .",
    "the next two contributions are from charm d meson and beauty b meson decays .",
    "charm yields @xmath174 of the counts at = gev , and beauty yields @xmath175 of the counts above @xmath176 gev .",
    "the lowest curve is the contribution from drell - yan which never has a major contribution to the single electrons .",
    "phenix has made a preliminary measurement of the single electron transverse momentum spectra from the limited statistics in run i as shown in figure  [ fig : elec ] .",
    "the analysis of these results is proceeding and implications on charm production are forthcoming .",
    "additional handles on heavy flavor production can be had with the measurement of correlated leptons .",
    "for example , electron - muon pairs at large relative momentum ( @xmath177 or @xmath178 ) have a substantial contribution from @xmath18 and @xmath179 pairs .",

    "although the initial @xmath177 of the @xmath18 pair is significantly modified when measured as a @xmath177 of the @xmath184 pair , there is enough information to attempt to extract a total charm cross section and maybe something about the initial @xmath177 of the @xmath18 .",
    "this measurement has the advantage over @xmath28 and @xmath29 pairs in that @xmath185 pairs are free from drell - yan and thermal contributions .",

    "is substantially washed out and of much lower slope since the kaon in the d decay takes away a large fraction of the original charm momentum that is not measured .",
    "it should be noted that the modeling of the fragmentation of the charm quark will be a source of systematic error , whereas the blurring of the @xmath177 from the @xmath185 decay kinematics can be modeled exactly .",
    "we show the invariant mass distribution of the @xmath185 pairs into the phenix acceptance in figure  [ fig : invmass ] . also shows are three mass distribution with electron energy cuts of 1.0 , 1.5 , and 2.0 gev .",
    "the cut on the electron energy is strongly correlated with the invariant mass selection on the @xmath185 pair . since lower masses ( in particular @xmath194 gev ) are thought to have large background contamination , the loss of these pairs with higher electron energy threshold are not as worrisome as they might otherwise be .",

    "more experimental data are needed and theoretical work to model charm production .",
    "in order to draw a full picture of charm production , multiple measurements must be done in the single lepton ( electrons and muons ) and correlated leptons ( electron pairs , muon pairs , and electron - muon pairs ) .",
    "it would be extremely useful for theorists interested in total charm or beauty production , and also high  energy loss of heavy flavor partons , to make some predictions for the leptonic signatures that will be measured in the next year .",
    "future upgrades to the detectors for tagging displaced vertices from d meson decays are probably more than five years away .",
    "there are no early measurement results on quarkonia @xmath19 states from run i due to the low luminosity and short running period .",

    "phenix has a large acceptance in @xmath38 and  that we be crucial to constraint models of coloring screening absorbtion and test theories with re - coalescence at the hadronization phase .",
    "shown in figure  [ fig : jpsi ] is a simulation of the type of measurement that could be made in the phenix muons arms with 37 weeks at 10% of design luminosity , or equivalently in less than four weeks with the luminosity averaging the the rhic design specification .",
    "the first measurements are being made now in run ii , and high statistics should be available in run iii .",
    "the star detector system is unique among the rhic experiments in its capabilities to simultaneously measure many experimental observables on a event - by - event basis such as energy - density , entropy , baryochemical potential , strangeness content , temperature , and flow .",
    "the measurement of  production as a function of these quantities allows the study of the suppression mechanism in great detail .",
    "this advantage becomes immediately apparent when it comes to the study of the _ onset _ of the anomalous suppression which reflects the point where the system reaches critical conditions and , at least partially , undergoes a phase transition .",
    "thus , the correlation of the @xmath201 break - up with the many single - event variables provides a new promising analysis tool .",
    "the golden  decay mode for star is @xmath202 .",
    "prima facie this poses a problem since the star detector has been designed to focus primarily on hadronic observables over a large phase - space and thus lacks two essential features of a dedicated lepton experiment : hadron - blind detectors and fast event recording rates .",
    "the two essential components which help to overcome these shortcomings are _",
    "( i ) _ the emc barrel which allows to suppress hadrons to a level sufficient to achieve signal - to - background ratios around 1:3 or better , and _",
    "( ii ) _ a fast level-3 trigger which is designed to efficiently trigger on electron - positron pairs with a given invariant mass at rates in the order of 100 hz , thus improving stars bandwidth for recording  decays by almost two orders of magnitude .     in the star experiment .",
    "the left plot shows the acceptance as a function of  for various rapidities @xmath203 , right one as a function of rapidity for various  slices . ]    the geometric acceptance for the decay channel @xmath202 in star is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : acceptance ] .",
    "a  is accepted if both electrons carry momenta @xmath204 and fall into the emc acceptance .",
    "both requirements imply that the electron tracks cross all layers of inner tracking detectors ( svt+ssd ) and all tpc padrows .",
    "this ensures maximum momentum and de / dx resolution and therefore maximum additional electron identification from detectors other than the emc .",
    "as is depicted in the left plot , the full coverage of the emc @xmath61 ensures relatively high efficiencies ( @xmath205 ) at very low . at these low values",
    "the two leptons run essentially back - to - back , a decay topology that requires symmetric coverage around @xmath206 .",
    "this region of phasespace is of great interest since here the  remains longest in the hot dense medium and its breakup probability is maximal .",
    "up to @xmath207 the acceptance then drops significantly since , still at large opening angles , it becomes more likely to loose one electron because it either carries too low momentum and/or falls outside our acceptance . at larger  the acceptance raises dramatically due to the decreasing opening angle of the pair an the higher average momenta of the electrons .",
    "however , the  cross - section drops exponentially towards larger  resulting in little net benefit in terms of total yields . in this region the acceptance scales approximately _ linear _ with the emc coverage while at lower  it scales almost _",
    "quadratically_.    the dominant background source is the combinatorial background due to pions misidentified as electrons .",
    "other sources as electrons from @xmath208- and @xmath13-dalitz decays , photo - conversions , and decays of light vector - mesons ( @xmath3 , @xmath5 ) turned out to be neglectable , since _ ( i ) _ their average  is too low and _ ( ii ) _ their rate is small compared to the abundance of misidentified hadrons .",
    "in addition , most electrons from photo - conversion can easily be rejected by requiring that all tracks point back to the primary event vertex .",
    "the most crucial factor in the overall background rejection is the hadron rejection power ( e / h ) of the emc .",
    "however , for @xmath209 , a region where the hadron rejection capabilities of the emc are degraded , the combined de / dx information of svt and tpc helps to augment the s / b ratio considerably .",
    "it is important to note , that the hadron rejection enters quadratically into the background .",
    "the magnitude of the background depends strongly on the momentum cut applied to the electron candidates . in order to access",
    "the low-   region star has chosen m@xmath210 as the lowest value to study .",
    "the higher the cut the better the e / h rejection from the emc and the lower the charged pion yield .",

    "[ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ tab : rates ]    before any measurement can be addressed it is important to estimate the achievable yields and the statistical significance of the signal under realistic assumptions .",
    "table [ tab : rates ] summarizes the resulting yields , the signal - to - background ratio , and the statistical significance after @xmath211 and @xmath212 sec .",
    "note , that a nominal rhic run has @xmath211sec .",
    "here one assumes 100% level-3 trigger efficiency running at the design rate of 100 hz , and full emc coverage including pre - shower detectors .",
    "the estimate includes the reconstruction efficiencies of the various detectors .",
    "known cross - section from elementary collisions were used to exptrapolate to au+au at = 200 gev .",
    "two different sets of cuts on the electron momenta are shown in order to demonstrate its effect on the s / b ratio .",
    "interestingly , the higher s / b ratio for the larger  cut balances the decreased signal strength , thus resulting in the same statistical significance for both cases .    for the actual measurement one has to study  production not only in the most central collisions , but has to vary the centrality and possibly the colliding systems .",
    "although the  yield will decrease for semi - central and peripheral collisions the signal - to - background ratio will decrease even stronger ( almost quadratically ) which will ease the extraction of the signal significantly .",

    "<S> we present a written version of four lectures given at the nato advanced study institute on `` qcd perspectives on hot and dense matter '' in cargese , corsica during august , 2001 . over the last year </S>",
    "<S> the first exciting results from the relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) and the four experiments brahms , phenix , phobos , and star have been presented . in these lectures we review the state of rhic and the experiments and the most exciting current results from run i which took place in 2000 . </S>",
    "<S> a complete review is not possible yet with many key results still preliminary or to be measured in run ii , which is currently underway , and thus the emphasis will be on the approach experimentalists have taken to address the fundamental physics issues of the field . </S>",
    "<S> we have not attempted to update the rhic results for this proceedings , but rather present it as a snapshot of what was discussed in the workshop . </S>",
    "<S> the field is developing very quickly , and benefits greatly from contact and discussions between the different approaches of experimentalists and theorists .     + kluwer  academic  publishers prepress department , + p.o .  box  17 , 3300  aa  dordrecht , the  netherlands + e - mail : texhelp@wkap.nl + fax : + 31 78 6392500 </S>"
