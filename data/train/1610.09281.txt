    "interactions of adatoms are a subject of continuous interest , various different interaction mechanisms have been described in detail [ 1 ] .",
    "adatom structures like superlattices , nanodot arrays , nanostripes , strain relief patterns are interesting for various general and technological reasons ; reviews were given in [ 2,3,4,5 ] .",
    "lateral interactions also govern the ordering behavior of adatoms and thus the catalytic activities of surfaces [ 6 ] .",
    "lattice models are the discrete representations of surface properties and usable for predicting structure and phase diagrams of adatom configurations [ 1 ] .",
    "thanks to computational power and advanced algorithms the lateral interactions of adatoms have been determined from first principles using density - functional theory ( dft ) and used as inputs to derive lattice - gas hamiltonians ( lghs ) [ 7 ] .",
    "the accuracy of this method was analyzed for the o - pd(100 ) system and its results were applied to understand surface ordering of atomic adsorbates at that system [ 8 ] .",
    "these first principle calculations determined the location of o adatoms preferably on fourfold coordinated surface sites .",
    "the subsequent lattice gas expansion postulated trio ( triplet ) and quattro ( quadruplet ) interactions to fit the dft results . those calculations focused on the range up to about half coverage since experiments showed the onset of surface reconstruction when the coverage is increased beyond half coverage [ 9 ] .",
    "key assumption in those calculations were vanishing interactions from 6th next neighbors , allowing to derive short range lateral interaction energies from ordered adatom configurations with systems of linear equations .    since similar calculations of the o - ag(111 ) system showed significant lateral displacements [ 10 ] the question",
    "is raised in the following , what impact longer range interactions may have also in the o - pd(100 ) system .",
    "an @xmath0 type interaction would lead to an @xmath1 dependency in lattice sums and show results quite different from short range interactions .    in the following dft results of [ 8 ] for the o - pd(100 ) system",
    "will be interpreted in terms of elastic adatom interactions and an appropriate lattice gas hamiltonian will be derived . to facilitate the comparison of the two approaches the terminology of [ 8 ]",
    "will be used in parts .",
    "strain mediated adatom interactions with the basic distance proportionality and the strong influence of the substrates elastic anisotropy were discussed already in the 1970 decade based on elastic continuum theory [ 11,12,13 ] .",
    "usage of an elastic mode theory [ 14 ] allowed to handle the singularity at the origin [ 12 ] .",
    "a review of elastic effects on surface physics was given in [ 15 ] .",
    "the results of [ 8 ] for the o - pd(100 ) system claim the relevance of trio- and quattro interactions ; this caused an extension of the pair interaction theory of [ 12 ] .",
    "the presentation of such extension would overload this analysis and therefore is given elsewhere [ 16 ] .    in the pair interaction model of [ 12 ]",
    "the interaction of adatoms is mediated by their strain fields generated by single adatoms exerting isotropic stress to their vicinity .",
    "isotropic stress is a consequence of adatom locations on sites with 4-fold symmetry . in a lattice description adatoms",
    "would exert forces to their immediate substrate neighbors creating a displacement field equivalent to a strain field .",
    "in other cases where adatoms interact directly e.g. via their dipole moment or via electronic overlap , pairs of adatoms may create substrate strain by stretching or compressing the substrate to balance the forces .",
    "the strain field of such pairs will mediate interactions between pairs and also between pairs and monomers , an interpretation of trio and quattro interactions .",
    "if forces between dimer constituents are central , the model can be kept simple and the resulting stress field can ( with symmetry restrictions ) be described with one more free parameter than the previous pair interaction model [ 16 ] .    since within [ 8 ] dft - calculated energies for only a few ordered adatom configurations",
    "have been published , the comparison between the elastic model and the dft results must stay incomplete for the time being .    instead of using a monte carlo simulation for evaluating the system partition function and order parameters like in [ 8 ] , a pair distribution analysis based on [ 17 , 18 ] will be performed . together with the resulting three - body distribution",
    "this will allow to derive the adatom neighborhood at various coverages .",
    "the temperature dependence of the pair distribution will be given by a simple scaling law .",
    "the fourier transform of the adatom correlation will allow comparisons with leed measurements of the o - pd(100 ) system [ 19 ] .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : + after outlining the general motivation in section 1 , basic interaction model details are recalled in section 2 . in section 3",
    "model parameters are fitted to the first principles calculations of [ 8 ] . in section 4",
    "the pair distribution analysis is performed and adatom ordering is discussed . in section 5 applicability and limitations of the model",
    "are discussed and open questions are addressed .",
    "section 6 closes with a summary of the results .",
    "in this section the lattice - gas hamiltonian is employed in which the total free binding energy of one component configurations are expanded in sums of discrete interactions between lattice sites .",
    "these discrete interactions are related to the energy of configurations calculated by first principles methods as done for o - pd(100 ) in [ 8 ] .",
    "the total free binding energy h is assumed to be a sum of site energies @xmath2 , pair interactions @xmath3 , trio interactions @xmath4 and higher terms    @xmath5    with occupation numbers @xmath6 .",
    "the discrete interactions will not individually be derived from dft calculations as in [ 8 ] but taken from a substrate strain mediated interaction model outlined in the following section .",
    "the occurrence of trio- and quattro interactions in [ 8 ] causes an extension of current elastic pair interaction models . while elastic pair interactions are related to the stress fields of single adatoms , adatom dimers will generate elastic trio- and quattro interactions in the following model , a condensed version of [ 16 ] .",
    "adatoms or dimers exert forces on their substrate neighbors leading to a displacement of substrate atoms to balance those forces .",
    "such displacements will increase or decrease the energy of neighboring adatoms or dimers . in a continuum description adatoms and dimers exert stress parallel to the surface leading to substrate strain which in turn can lead to an attraction or a repulsion of neighboring adatoms or dimers .",
