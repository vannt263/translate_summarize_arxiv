    "<S> the magnetic and transport properties are systematically studied on the single crystal @xmath0 with charge ordering and divergency in resistivity below 50 k. a long - range ferromagnetic ordering is observed in susceptibility below 20 k with the magnetic field parallel to co - o plane , while a negligible behavior is observed with the field perpendicular to the co - o plane . it definitely gives a direct evidence for the existence of in - plane ferromagnetism below 20 k. the observed magnetoresistance ( mr ) of 30 @xmath1 at the field of 6 t at low temperatures indicates an unexpectedly strong spin - charge coupling in triangle lattice systems .    </S>",
    "<S> discovery of superconductivity with @xmath2 5 k in @xmath3 @xcite makes one consider that @xmath4 may be a good example like cuprates as a doped mott insulator becomes superconducting . </S>",
    "<S> a characteristic of non - hydrate @xmath4 is the sensitivity of the electronic states to slight change in x. a charge ordering state with anomalous change in thermopower , hall coefficient and thermal conductivity occurs in the sample @xmath5 with co valence of + 3.5.@xcite    takada et al . </S>",
    "<S> have reinvestigated the superconducting sodium cobalt oxide bilayer - hydrate and revised the stoichiometry of the superconductor to be @xmath6.@xcite it is found that the oxonium ions , @xmath7 , can occupy the same crystallographic sites as the na ions when the sample of the @xmath8 is immersed in distilled water.@xcite the occupation of oxonium ions in the @xmath9 layers in superconducting hydrate @xmath4 makes the co valence to be + 3.4 , being much lower than + 3.7 which is directly deduced from the na content and is widely used to discuss the superconductivity , and to draw superconducting phase diagram and to make theoretical calculations.@xcite recently barnes et al . mapped a dome - shaped superconducting phase diagram as a function of cobalt oxidation state . </S>",
    "<S> they found that the maximum @xmath10 in @xmath11 occurs when cobalt oxidation state is near + 3.5.@xcite the maximum @xmath10 occurs near the charge ordered insulating state that correlates with the average cobalt oxidation of + 3.5 . </S>",
    "<S> sakurai et al . also gave a superconducting phase diagram with a cobalt valence of + 3.48.@xcite they found that the superconductivity was significantly affected by the isovalent exchange of @xmath9 and @xmath12 , rather than by variation of co valence . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , the superconducting phase has been revised by different groups.@xcite it is found that the superconductivity with the highest @xmath10 is observed in the vicinity of a magnetic phase , suggesting strongly that magnetic fluctuations play an important role in the occurrence of superconductivity.@xcite based on the above results , the superconductivity occurs in the cobalt oxidation state near + 3.5 instead of about + 3.7 . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , one should take the @xmath4 with @xmath13 as the parent compound for the superconductor . </S>",
    "<S> it suggests that the superconducting state could compete with the charge ordering state . </S>",
    "<S> this assumption could be supported by the abrupt upturn at @xmath14 k before superconducting transition in both the ab plane and the c direction resistivity.@xcite therefore , it is very significant to study the magnetic properties of @xmath15 with x around 0.5 for understanding the pairing mechanism .    </S>",
    "<S> we systematically study transport and magnetic properties for the @xmath4 crystals with x around 0.5 . </S>",
    "<S> it is found that the single crystals show paramagnetic metallic behavior with x slightly less than 0.5 ( cobalt oxidation of 3.5 ) , while an insulating behavior below 50 k in resistivity and a complicated magnetic properties with x slightly larger than 0.5 . in this letter </S>",
    "<S> , we present the transport and magnetic properties in @xmath16 with cobalt oxidation of 3.45 . </S>",
    "<S> an in - plane ferromagnetism is observed below 20 k which depends on x. a large mr of 30 % with field of 6 t at low temperatures are surprisingly sensitive to spin orientation , suggesting that charge transport is strongly coupled to spin . </S>",
    "<S> if superconductivity really occurs in the cobalt oxidation near 3.5 , the strong spin - charge coupling should be considered for the superconducting mechanism .    </S>",
    "<S> high quality single crystals @xmath17 were grown using the flux method . </S>",
    "<S> the typical dimensional is about @xmath18 with the shortest dimension along the c axis . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath0 sample is prepared by sodium de - intercalation from the @xmath17 singe crystals . </S>",
    "<S> the procedure is similar to the way to prepare the @xmath5 sample , the difference is that the lower @xmath19 concentration is used with the shorter reaction time compared to the preparation of @xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> about 5 mg @xmath17 single crystals were immersed in the sealed conical flask with 5ml 0.15 m solution of @xmath19 in acetonitrile at room temperature for about 30 hours . </S>",
    "<S> the actual na concentration was determined by atomscan advantage inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectrometer ( icp ) . </S>",

    "<S> it suggests that the @xmath26 and @xmath27 is very sensitive to the na content . </S>",
    "<S> a striking feature is that a ferromagnetic ordering occurs blow 20 k. the zfc and fc branches show up in the low h , while the zfc and fc data are the same with the h larger than 1 t. it suggests a weak ferromagnetic behavior . for the case of the applied magnetic field parallel to ab - plane , there exists a maximum in zfc @xmath20 at a certain temperature @xmath28 below the ferromagnetic transition temperature ( @xmath10 ) . as shown in the inset of fig.1(a ) , the @xmath28 decreases with increasing the applied field . </S>",
    "<S> this is because the applied field makes the spin frozen temperature to decrease . </S>",
    "<S> compared to the case of h parallel to ab - plane , the @xmath20 slightly increases with decreasing the temperature and the fc @xmath20 for different fields is almost the same with the applied field perpendicular to ab - plane below the @xmath10 . in addition , the @xmath20 for h@xmath21 co - o plane is much larger ( more than one order ) than that for h @xmath22 co - o plane . </S>",

    "<S> figure 2(a ) shows a m - h loop at 4 k with the magnetic field h @xmath21 co - o plane . </S>",
    "<S> it suggests that there exists a ferromagnetic ordering in the low temperature . </S>",

    "<S> these results clearly indicate that the ferromagnetic ordering observed in fig.1 occurs with spin direction within the ab - plane . in order to compare the in - plane susceptibility with out - of - plane susceptibility , </S>",
    "<S> the inverse susceptibility @xmath20 with applied magnetic field h @xmath21 co - o plane and h @xmath22 co - o plane as a function of temperature is shown in fig.2(b ) at h=10000 oe below 50 k. it indicates that the susceptibility with h @xmath22 co - o plane shows a curie - weiss behavior below 50 k , while a weak ferromagnetic ordering occurs in @xmath20 with h @xmath21 co - o plane . </S>",
    "<S> this result is consistent with that observed in fig.2(a ) .    to further study the effect of the anisotropic susceptibility on the charge transport and the coupling between charge and spin , the charge transport is systematically studied . </S>",
    "<S> figure 3 shows the in - plane resistivity and magnetoresistance with h @xmath22 co - o plane and h @xmath21 co - o plane . as shown in the inset of fig.3(a ) , the zero - field resistivity shows nearly the same behavior as that of the charge ordering @xmath5.@xcite however , a transition of the slope @xmath30 from negative to positive is observed at about 17 k ( @xmath31 ) , which coincides with the ferromagnetic transition temperature shown in fig.1 . </S>",

    "<S> these results can be well understood by the in - plane ferromagnetic ordering . </S>",
    "<S> this is because the in - plane ferromagnetic ordering is not affected by the h perpendicular to ab - plane . as shown in the inset of fig.3(b ) , a maximum negative mr shows up abound @xmath31 with h @xmath21 co - o plane , while a positive mr occurs at low temperatures . </S>",

    "<S> the mr is negative and increases monotonically with increasing h , while at 15 k the mr is negative and shows a maximum at @xmath33 t ; at 10 k a negative maximum in the mr is observed at @xmath34 t , but with further increasing h the mr sign changes from negative to positive . </S>",
