    "the supersymmetry has different characteristics than other internal symmetries .",
    "one of these characteristics is that in contrast with the internal symmetries , the supersymmetry can be broken for theories with finite fermionic and bosonic degrees of freedom @xcite .",
    "therefore we can think of spontaneous symmetry breaking in supersymmetric quantum mechanics .",
    "the interest in supersymmetry breaking in quantum mechanics @xcite-@xcite becomes obvious , when we verify that some results from the breaking of supersymmetric quantum mechanics can be generalized and applied to quantum field theory . in the limit of low energy ,",

    "supersymmetry at finite temperature has been studied by @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , the issue of whether supersymmetry is broken at finite temperature has raised some controversy . in @xcite",
    "it is argued that supersymmetry ( susy ) is broken at positive temperature even when unbroken at @xmath1 . in response to this , @xcite , suggested that when a change of an operator under susy transformation at finite temperature is considered , one should take into account the klein operator .",
    "when this operator is incorporated , @xcite shows that the thermal average of this change of an operator is zero for all t , thereby maintaining supersymmetry at finite temperature . on the other hand ,",
    "has considered this issue within the context of thermo field dynamics ( tfd ) @xcite and concluded that susy is broken at finite temperature , by evaluating the statistical average of the susy hamiltonian at @xmath1 as its vacuum expectation value in the thermal vacuum @xmath2 ( where @xmath3 , @xmath4 being the boltzmann constant ) and showing that it is non - zero at finite temperature .    in this paper following tfd",
