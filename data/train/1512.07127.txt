    "in high energy collisions , small-@xmath0 evolution provides the qcd description of the dynamics of gluon evolution in the high energy limit when the longitudinal momentum fraction @xmath0 of partons is small . due to the enhancement of the bremsstrahlung radiation of small-@xmath0 gluons ,",
    "high energy scattering amplitudes are expected to rise rapidly as collision energy increases .",
    "the rise of the resulting scattering cross sections can also be seen from the solution of balitsky - fadin - kuraev - lipatov ( bfkl ) evolution equation@xcite which increases as the rapidity interval @xmath1 increases .",
    "the important feature of bfkl evolution is that the resulting cross section grows as @xmath2 , with @xmath3 at leading order .",
    "this behaviour essentially is equivalent to the exchange of a pomeron , thus sometimes the rise of gluon density and cross sections is attributed to the so - called bfkl pomeron .    in high energy proton - proton collisions , inclusive dijets productions with large rapidity separation @xmath4 which is known as mueller - navelet jets production ,",
    "are particularly interesting for studying the properties of the bfkl pomeron and small-@xmath0 gluon evolution in the era of the lhc . here",
    "@xmath5 and @xmath6 represent the rapidities and transverse momenta of the produced jets . at the leading order ( lo ) ,",
    "the differential cross section of this process@xcite can be written as @xmath7\\left[x_2g(x_2)+\\frac{4}{9 } x_2q(x_2 ) \\right ] \\sigma_0 ( k_{1\\perp } , k_{2\\perp } ) f(k_{1\\perp } , k_{2\\perp } , y ) , \\label{mnlo}\\ ] ] where @xmath8 , and @xmath9 obeys the momentum space representation of the bfkl evolution equation with rapidity interval @xmath10 . the physical picture of the lo mueller - navelet jets production is as follows : one parton with longitudinal momentum fraction @xmath11 from the projectile proton with positive rapidity and another parton with longitudinal momentum fraction @xmath12 from the target proton with negative rapidity exchange a bfkl pomeron , which is characterized by the so - called bfkl pomeron propagator @xmath9 , and eventually becomes two jets at rapidity @xmath13 and @xmath14 , respectively .",
    "this is illustrated as in the left figure of fig .",
    "we suppose that the rapidity interval @xmath10 is so large that @xmath15 and @xmath16 are reasonably large .",
    "therefore , the use of the collinear parton distributions , which neglect the transverse momenta of partons inside protons , can be justified . in this scenario ,",
    "the transverse momentum imbalance of these two jets is due to the small-@xmath0 gluon radiation which is resummed by the bfkl evolution equation , and the azimuthal angular correlation is solely determined by the bfkl dynamics , namely @xmath9 .",
    "( [ mnlo ] ) gives the dominant contribution when @xmath17 is sufficiently large .",
    "for not so large @xmath17 , if we neglect the parton shower , namely the sudakov effects , we expect that these two jets are almost back - to - back in the azimuthal plane due to hard scattering .",
    "if we roughly fix the transverse momenta of the jets and increase their rapidity interval @xmath17 , we then have more and more gluons radiated with randomized transverse momenta due to the increment of the bfkl evolution .",
    "thus , these two jets get less and less correlated , and may even become completely decorrelated at asymptotically large @xmath17 .",
    "recently , the cms collaboration at the lhc has measured the dijet azimuthal correlation with large rapidity separation between the jets , which has been interpreted as the bfkl evolution ( resummation ) effects .",
    "this pattern of decorrelation with increasing @xmath17 has been qualitatively observed by the cms collaboration@xcite at the lhc .",
    "one should however note that this pattern can be significantly modified when including corrections to the impact factors describing the production of the two jets . in order to quantitatively compare with data for mueller - navelet jets , one needs to compute the one - loop diagrams and also include the next - to - leading order(nlo ) contributions , besides the correction from the nlo bfkl evolution@xcite .",
    "this has been intensively studied in the last two decades by several groups@xcite .",
    "reasonably good agreement between the nlo calculation and the cms data has been achieved@xcite .    in light of recent development@xcite of sudakov resummation in small-@xmath0 formalism , by reexamining the one - loop diagrams associated with this process , we find that there also exist sudakov type logarithms in mueller - navelet jets production in the configuration in which the produced jets are almost back - to - back .",
    "it was found that the resummation of sudakov type logarithms and small-@xmath0 logarithm can be performed separately when two scales are present .",
    "( in this particular process , we have the average transverse momentum @xmath18 which characterizes the hard scattering and the dijet momentum imbalance @xmath19 which is due to gluon radiation . in the back - to - back configuration , it is clear that @xmath20 , which generates the sudakov type logarithms , such as @xmath21 . )",
    "we shall use the same technique developed in ref .",
    "@xcite in the following calculation to derive the sudakov double logarithms for mueller - navelet jets production in @xmath22 collisions in the coulomb gauge which treats both the projectile and target protons symmetrically .",
    "we expect that sudakov resummation introduces the suppression of back - to - back configurations , which is playing a similar role as the bfkl evolution in terms of dijet decorrelation .",
    "of course , at asymptotically high energy with extremely large rapidity separation @xmath17 , the bfkl part is dominant and sudakov suppression is presumed to be negligible .",
    "nevertheless , at present lhc energy and kinematical regime where the measurement is made , we believe that these two effects should be taken into account together in order to achieve a better description of the lhc data .",
    "the original derivation of bfkl evolution was achieved in momentum space , which motivates the idea of @xmath23 factorization in high energy scatterings .",
    "later , the color dipole picture of the bfkl pomeron in coordinate space was found in ref .",
    "@xcite , and the exact equivalence between the color dipole model and the original bfkl results was verified afterwards@xcite .",
    "since it is mostly convenient to perform sudakov resummation in coordinate space in order to take the momentum conservation of arbitrary number of gluons into account , the color dipole model is then the natural choice of framework to work with . as illustrated in the right figure of fig .",
    "[ di ] , by using fourier transform with proper normalization , we can convert the above expression in eq .",
    "( [ mnlo ] ) into the so - called @xmath24-matrix , which obeys the coordinate space representation of the bfkl equation in the color dipole model .",
    "therefore , in the following discussion , we will derive the sudakov double logarithm from the one - loop calculation of the mueller - navelet dijet production by using the color dipole model , and discuss the resummation of sudakov logarithms .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii , we briefly discuss the lowest order dipole - dipole scattering amplitude , which helps us to fix the normalization with the momentum space expression .",
    "then , we use the dipole splitting function to compute one - loop diagrams in coordinate space and derive the sudakov double logarithm in sec .",

    "iv , we give an intuitive discussion on the origin of this sudakov factor and discuss its implications . at last ,",
    "we conclude in sec .",
    "v , and provide some discussion on the emergence of the sudakov factor from the collinear factorization point of view in the appendix .",
    "in this section , we would like to specify our normalization and compare the dipole model approach with the usual bfkl approach in momentum space and collinear factorization results .",
    "first of all , let us compute the lo dipole - dipole scattering amplitude and show that it is equivalent to the momentum space results . throughout the paper , we work in light - cone coordinates and define light cone variables as @xmath25 and @xmath26 . as shown in fig .",
    "[ di ] , the leading order cross section can be written down as follows @xmath27 where @xmath28 represents the scattering matrix between two coordinate dipoles with size @xmath29 and @xmath30 as depicted in fig .",

    ", we just need to set @xmath36 and @xmath37 . for other channels ,",
    "we just need to use the corresponding parton distributions and put proper color factor for the @xmath38matrix .",
    "therefore , let us focus on the one - loop calculation for the quark - quark channel , since the derivation for other channels is rather similar .",
    "at the lowest order without any bfkl evolution , namely without any gluon radiation , one finds that it is given by the dipole - dipole scattering cross section which can be written as @xcite @xmath39 which gives @xmath40 the above results is equivalent to eq .",
    "( [ mnlo ] ) for the quark - quark channel once we set @xmath41 when @xmath42 .",
    "moreover , we can obtain exactly the same results as in lowest order collinear factorization calculation after taking into account @xmath43\\ \\simeq \\frac{n_c^2 - 1}{n_c^2}\\frac{\\alpha_s^2}{t^2}\\ ] ] in the high energy @xmath44 limit , where @xmath45 and @xmath46 .",
    "in addition , it has been shown that the dipole model is completely equivalent to the bfkl green s function approach . by relating the bfkl pomeron propagator @xmath9 to the fourier transform of @xmath28",
    ", we can easily demonstrate that eq .",
    "( [ lo ] ) is equivalent to the lo formula with bfkl evolution in ref .",
    "@xcite ( see also e.g. , refs .",
    "@xcite ) . since the systematic resummation of sudakov double logarithms can conveniently be done in coordinate space , we choose to do the calculation in the dipole model .",
    "at one - loop level , on top of the lo diagram , we need to consider the radiation of an extra gluon . in principle , this extra gluon radiation can occur anywhere in fig .",
    "[ di ] . to perform the dipole model calculation at one - loop ,",
    "we choose to employ the coulomb gauge following ref .",
    "@xcite which allows us to simplify the one - loop calculation in leading logarithm approximation ( lla ) , by removing all the diagrams with additional gluon exchanges between two partons with large rapidity intervals , which are suppressed in high energy limit .",
    "that is to say , at the level of lla in high energy scatterings , the dominant contributions always come from the diagrams with two vertical gluon exchanges between the projectile and target protons .",
    "let us suppose the four - momentum of the radiated gluon is @xmath47 .",
    "as long as @xmath48 , namely @xmath49 for real gluons , the coulomb gauge is equivalent to the light cone gauge with @xmath50@xcite , which allows us to compute gluon radiation from the right moving quark in the dipole model . as to the region",
    "@xmath51 in the phase space of the radiated gluon , the coulomb gauge reduces to the light cone gauge with @xmath52 , which indicates that the gluon radiation is originated from the left moving quark .",
    "these two regions are completely symmetric , thus we can just compute the former and multiply by a factor of @xmath53 to take into account the latter . with this choice of gauge , we still can use the dipole splitting kernel which is derived in the light cone gauge with the above corresponding constraints .          at one - loop order ,",
    "let us first consider the diagram as shown in fig .",
    "[ real1 ] in the eikonal approximation , which gives @xmath54 where the two - dimensional coordinates of active partons are labeled in fig .  [ real1 ] and @xmath55 .",
    "the longitudinal momentum fraction of the incoming quark @xmath0 is no longer fixed , instead , now it becomes @xmath56 with @xmath57 .",
    "for the right - moving massless quark with no initial transverse momentum and initial longitudinal momentum @xmath58 , the splitting wave function of @xmath59 in transverse coordinate space can be cast into ( see e.g. ref .",
    "@xcite ) @xmath60 where @xmath61 represents the gluon polarization , @xmath62 indicate helicities for the incoming and outgoing quarks , and @xmath63 is defined as the longitudinal momentum fraction of the incoming quark carried by the radiated gluon . here",
    "@xmath64 is the transverse separation of the quark - gluon pair , and it is conjugate to their relative momentum .",
    "when @xmath65 , the radiated gluon becomes very soft . by performing the fourier transform , it is straightforward to show that eq .",
    "( [ re1 ] ) can be converted to @xmath66 now our task is to evaluate eq .",
    "( [ re11 ] ) .",
    "first of all , according to the definition of the plus - function , one can write @xmath67 as demonstrated before in ref .",
    "@xcite , the first term in the above equation corresponds to the renormalization of the collinear parton distribution , since it only contains collinear singularities after being put back to eq .",
    "( [ re11 ] ) .",
    "( the finite part can be put into the nlo hard factor . ) as to the second term , after taking into account the constraint @xmath68 due to the use of coulomb gauge with respect to the above @xmath69 integration , we can obtain @xmath70 similarly , one can consider the gluon radiation from the left moving quark quark with the large @xmath71 momentum component @xmath72 and obtain @xmath73 adding these two contributions together , we find that the first part gives contribution which is proportional to @xmath74 .",
    "it is obvious that this corresponds to the bfkl evolution of the dipole - dipole scattering cross section .",
    "following the same strategy@xcite , one can demonstrate that the bfkl evolution equation can be derived after taking all the graphs into account .",
    "after renaming @xmath75 to @xmath29 , the second part can be cast into @xmath76 where @xmath77 , @xmath78 , @xmath79 and @xmath80 . in the above equation",
    ", we have neglected @xmath81 ( which is the order of @xmath82 ) as compared to @xmath83 .",
    "the change of variables here is important to our calculation , since @xmath82 and @xmath83 are the most convenient and relevant variables in the back - to - back limit .",
    "furthermore , in the back - to - back dijet limit , since @xmath84 , we do not distinguish between @xmath83 and @xmath85 .",
    "in the leading power approximation , we neglect all contributions which are of order of @xmath86 .",
    "this allows us to also neglect @xmath81 as compared to @xmath83 .",
    "when @xmath81 is as large as @xmath83 , one can easily see that the resulting contribution is then power suppressed .",
    "now the integral in question is @xmath87 where we have changed the dimension of the integral from @xmath53 to @xmath88 in order to isolate the expected soft - collinear divergence . in the @xmath89 scheme , we find that the above integral yields ( see the appendix of ref .",
    "@xcite ) @xmath90 \\ , \\label{realc}\\ ] ] where @xmath91 and @xmath92 is the euler constant .",
    "now let us consider the virtual graphs as shown in fig .",
    "[ vir1 ] . in principle",
    ", we need to take all these three graphs in fig .",
    "[ vir1 ] into account .",
    "we shall not present the complete calculation here , since it is a bit tedious .",
    "collisions , detailed computations of virtual diagrams are presented in ref .",
    "the technique needed to perform such complete calculation for mueller - navelet jets is akin to that used in higgs productions and dijet productions . ] we found a quick way to obtain the total virtual contribution by using the simple fact that the ultra - violet divergence should cancel between these three graphs . due to this cancellation , it is natural to just simply assume that these three virtual graphs completely cancel in the ultra - violet region where @xmath93 . on the other hand , in the @xmath94 region",
    ", we find that graph ( b ) and ( c ) are power suppressed , thus can be neglected .",
    "therefore , the only important contribution comes from graph ( a ) with the constraint @xmath94 , which amazingly gives the identical result as the complete evaluation of all three graphs .",
    "again , using the dipole model and the fourier transform , it is straightforward to find that graph ( a ) in fig .",
    "[ vir1 ] gives the following contribution @xmath95 similarly , taking the coulomb gauge constraint into account , the second term gives @xmath96 following the same procedure , we identify the first part as the contribution to the bfkl evolution , and the second part as the contribution to the sudakov factor , which can be cast into @xmath97 .\\label{virc}\\ ] ] as commented above , we have made an ultra - violet cut @xmath94 in the above integration by using the knowledge that the large @xmath81 region will be cancelled by other virtual diagrams .    by adding the real and virtual contributions together , one can easily find that the soft and collinear divergences cancel , and the remaining sudakov factor is and @xmath98 are produced .",
    "qualitatively speaking , sudakov double logarithms always arise due to the incomplete cancellation of the soft - collinear region of phase space between real and virtual graphs .",
    "as far as the back - to - back dijet correlation is concerned , such incomplete cancellation is bound to occur , since a certain constraint should be put on the real graphs to generate the desired dijet configuration , while virtual graphs have no constraint at all . on the other hand ,",
    "if one integrates over the full phase space of one of the dijet momenta ( e.g. @xmath98 ) at one - loop level , one should find that sudakov double logarithms are absent .",
    "this implies that generic dijet productions at one - loop level can not be viewed as productions of two independent jets . ]",
    "@xmath99 which becomes the so - called sudakov suppression factor after exponentiation due to multiple gluon radiation",
    ". since one needs to impose a delta function due to the conservation of transverse momentum when performing the resummation of arbitrary number of sudakov gluon radiations , it is common practice to do the fourier transform of that delta function and find that the sudakov factor naturally exponentiates in the coordinate space .",
    "it is also interesting to note that this result with the effective colour factor @xmath100 agrees with the empirical formula@xcite for the sudakov double logarithmic factor which implies that each incoming quark contributes @xmath101 to the effective colour factor . at the end of the day ,",
    "in the back - to - back limit , we find the cross section of mueller - navelet jets production @xmath102 where naturally a convolution of the bfkl evolved @xmath24-matrix together with the sudakov factor in coordinate space occurs .",
    "we find that both the sudakov resummation and bfkl evolution suppress the back - to - back configuration of dijet productions . on the other hand",
    ", we expect that the sudakov factor is important when the rapidity separation @xmath17 is not too large , while the bfkl pomeron exchange dominates when @xmath17 is asymptotically large . at the present lhc kinematics",
    ", we believe that both effects should be taken into account .",
    "in addition , simply taking the difference in color factors into account , it is straightforward to generalize the above calculation and compute the sudakov double logarithms for other dominant channels such as @xmath103 and @xmath104 as follows @xmath105          in the derivation of the sudakov double logarithm , we find that only the above considered graphs contribute while the rest of one - loop graphs do not . some of the diagrams , which contain interactions between the radiated gluon and the t - channel exchanged vertical gluon , are simply power suppressed by factors of @xmath106 , while other graphs do not contain sudakov type double logarithms .",
    "there is one type of one - loop diagrams as shown in fig .",
    "[ ref1 ] , in which the final state gluon is radiated . in principle , this type of diagrams could contribute the sudakov factor as well .",
    "however , in this particular coulomb gauge that we choose , this diagram only contain the small-@xmath0 evolution and jet cone contributions so long as the azimuthal angular deviation from the jets being back - to - back , @xmath107 , is less than the jet size , @xmath108 .",
    "we are going to use the same trick employed in ref .",
    "@xcite to study this graph as follows . in the soft gluon limit @xmath109 , the contribution from fig .",
    "[ ref1 ] after factorizing out the lo contribution can be cast into @xmath110 since we are only interested in the correlation between the produced dijet , we can average over the azimuthal angle of the leading jet , say the azimuthal angle of @xmath111 . using the identity",
    "@xmath112 one can cast the above integral into @xmath113 obviously , the above integration has a collinear singularity at @xmath114 which is expected since this comes from the region where the radiated gluon is collinear to the quark .",
    "let us simply regularize this collinear singularity by putting a cutoff @xmath108 in the @xmath69 integral which gives @xmath115 , \\label{finaljet}\\ ] ] where the azimuthal cone size @xmath108 should depend on the angular resolution of the jet measurement .",
    "the above results contain only two terms which correspond to two kinds of different physics , namely , the energy evolution and the jet cone definition . in principle , we should do a rigorous calculation with proper definition of cone size @xmath116 , where @xmath117 and @xmath118 are the rapidity and azimuthal angle size of the jets , respectively .",
    "we have done this complete calculation and found the same conclusion . in practice , we normally choose @xmath119 .    by taking into account the similar diagram for gluon radiation originating from the quark in the left moving proton , we obtain @xmath120 , which corresponds to the bfkl evolution of the scattering dipole cross section .",
    "the second term clearly represents the jet cone singularity , which can be regularised easily by using more rigorous jet cone definition . as compared to the calculation in ref .",
    "@xcite , which is computed in @xmath50 light - cone gauge , the sudakov contribution is now absent in the coulomb gauge calculation presented here .",
    "one can employ a jet function and rigorously compute the jet cross section .",
    "nevertheless , this is independent of the calculation for the sudakov double logarithms .",
    "collisions with the use of @xmath50 light - cone gauge , where we found that the final state radiation does contain sudakov double logarithms . on the other hand , for the current mueller - navelet jets productions problem in @xmath22 collisions",
    ", we have to choose the coulomb gauge which treats both the projectile and target protons symmetrically , and we find no sudakov double logarithmic contributions from graphs with final state gluon radiations .",
    "although the conclusions with respect to the contribution of final state gluon radiation are different , we believe that there is no potential contradiction here due to different choice of gauges . ]",
    "let us comment on other diagrams which have not been discussed above .",
    "for example , there are interference diagrams of initial and final state gluon radiation , and so as far as the sudakov factor is concerned , those graphs do not contribute to the sudakov double logarithms . in total",
    ", there are nine different types of real graphs and three different types of virtual graphs . however , the rapidity divergent part of all graphs contribute to the bfkl evolution of the dipole scattering amplitude .",
    "we have checked explicitly the combination of all the graphs naturally gives the total colour factor @xmath121 for the bfkl evolution equation in the dipole model as indicated below . at the lowest order",
    ", there is no @xmath17 dependence in the dipole - dipole scattering cross section . at one - loop order",
    ", we find that the energy dependence can be absorbed into the redefinition of @xmath122 which gives the @xmath17 dependence as follows @xmath123 . \\label{bfklsub}\\ ] ] this exactly agrees with the dipole model version of the bfkl evolution . due to boost invariance",
    ", we can either put all the evolution in the projectile or put it in the target .",
    "this is justified since the solution of bfkl equation @xmath122 is symmetric between the interchange of @xmath29 and @xmath30 .",
    "last but not least , we would like to comment on the collinear singularities which also appear in the one - loop calculation in certain diagrams .",
    "we find that the collinear singularities associated with the initial state gluon radiation should be subtracted from the one - loop calculation and put into the redefinition of the corresponding incoming collinear parton distributions , which naturally yields the scale evolution of collinear parton distributions . on the other hand , through rigorous calculations with proper definition of jets ,",
    "we find that the final state collinear singularities always cancel between real and virtual graphs , since jets are infrared safe observables .",
    "based on the calculation that we conducted above and techniques developed in ref .",
    "@xcite , we provide below a heuristic derivation of sudakov double logarithms , which is much simpler . without getting into much technical detail , we use the general physical picture of sudakov factors to illustrate how they arise from the one - loop calculation . in general ,",
    "sudakov effects occur when physical systems have two distinct scales besides the collision energy . in this problem , these two scales are the dijet momentum imbalance @xmath77 and the jet transverse momentum @xmath18 . in the back - to - back configuration ,",

    "the sudakov factor helps to resum the large logarithms of their ratio , which start to appear at one - loop order .    at one - loop order",
    ", we have one extra gluon as compared to the lo diagram and we need to integrate over its phase space .",
    "let us divide the phase space into three regions , namely the infrared region @xmath125 with the infrared cutoff @xmath126 , the ultra - violet region @xmath127 and the region in between with @xmath128 .",
    "roughly speaking , after taking care of the collinear divergence associated with initial parton distributions , the infrared divergences should cancel between the real and virtual graphs .",
    "furthermore , the ultra - violet divergences always cancel among real diagrams and virtual graphs separately .",

    "for a given dijet configuration in the back - to - back limit , the phase space of real gluon radiation is limited only to the infrared region defined above while the virtual graphs are unrestricted .",
    "therefore , we can compute the probability of the back - to - back dijet directly . the contribution from the real diagram with initial state gluon radiation",
    "is @xmath132 and the virtual contribution is @xmath133 where we have truncated the @xmath134 integration at @xmath83 , since we should identify the contribution from the interval @xmath135 $ ] as the bfkl type contribution .",
    "the corresponding logarithm is @xmath136 after taking the gluon splitting from the left - moving quark into account . from the same consideration",

    "therefore , the sudakov contribution is @xmath137 which agrees with the results obtained above after setting @xmath138 .",

    "in this appendix , starting from the collinear factorization framework , we would like to argue that there should be sudakov resummation as well as the bfkl resummation for mueller - navelet jets production at high energy colliders .",
    "we can perform the calculations of dijet production in the back - to - back correlation region at one - loop order , and take the high energy limit . from these calculations ,",
    "we identify the sudakov double logarithms , and the bfkl - type logarithms depending on the rapidity difference @xmath17 between the two jets in the final state .",
    "therefore , we need to perform both resummations .    in ref .",
    "@xcite , the sudakov resummation was derived for dijet production , which is valid for the two jets produced at the same rapidity region .",
    "however , the derivations can also help us to identify the large logarithms for the mueller - navelet dijet production . in the following",
    ", we will extend the calculations in ref .",
    "@xcite to the current case .",
    "in addition , when the two jets are produced with large rapidity separation , we are in a special kinematic region , where the physics is dominated by @xmath151-channel diagrams .",
    "therefore , we will apply the following kinematic approximations , @xmath186 , which also implies that @xmath187 .",
    "more importantly , all the partonic channels with @xmath151-channel gluon exchange will be the most important contributions .",
    "this is because they all have terms which are proportional to @xmath188 .",
    "therefore , we will only take these dominant channels in the following calculations : @xmath189 , @xmath190 , and @xmath191 . after taking the above limit , the leading order result ( eq.(13 ) of ref .",

    "in the collinear calculation set - up , @xmath184 is the relevant variable in the final resummation , and one - gluon radiation contributes to non - zero @xmath82 .",
    "furthermore , we take the back - to - back correlation limit , i.e. , @xmath193 . the leading contributions from collinear and soft gluon radiations can be obtained from the results of ref .",
    "it becomes much simpler because of the large rapidity separation of the dijet and the approximation we are taking @xmath186 .",
    "for example , for the @xmath189 channel , from eqs .",

    "@xcite , we have the following expression for the soft gluon contribution at small @xmath82 from real diagrams , @xmath194 where the first term corresponds to the sudakov double logs , the second term for the jet functions , and the third term for the bfkl small - x resummation term . to derive the above results , we have applied the anti-@xmath23 algorithm for the final state jets .",
    "when the gluon radiation is inside the jet cone , it will not contribute to the finite @xmath82 .",
    "this requirement leads to the jet size dependent term in the above equation  @xcite .",
