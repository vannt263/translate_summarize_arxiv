    "the optical gravitational lensing experiment ( ogle ) is a long term observing project with the main goal of searching for dark matter in our galaxy using microlensing ( paczyski 1986 ) .",
    "after two years of continuous monitoring of approximately two million non - variable stars in the direction of the galactic bulge , ten microlensing events have been detected ( udalski et al .",
    "1993b , udalski et al",
    ". 1994a , udalski et al .",
    "the resulting optical depth of microlensing @xmath2 is higher than previous theoretical estimates and indicates that the bulge of our galaxy is in fact a bar , with its long axis inclined @xmath3 degrees to the line of sight ( paczyski et al .",
    "1994b ) .",
    "a microlensing event caused by a single , point - like lensing object has an achromatic light curve with a well defined , characteristic shape which is symmetric around the maximum of brightness ( paczyski 1986 , 1991 ) .",
    "the lensing phenomenon should not repeat as the probability of the same star being lensed twice is negligible .",
    "all the ogle microlensing events except ogle  # 7 displayed such photometric behaviors ( for ogle # 6 , a better fit to the data can be obtained with a binary microlens model , however , the case is not strong , mao & di  stefano 1994 ) .",
    "all the reported macho ( alcock et al . 1994 ) and eros ( aubourg et al . 1993 ) events can also be well fit by single lenses .",
    "it is well known that majority of stars are found in binary or multiple systems ( abt 1983 ) .",
    "therefore it is natural to expect some microlensing events to be caused by binary systems . the light curve of such events might be considerably different from that of single microlens events and would depend on the geometry of lensing ( mao & paczyski 1991 , mao & di  stefano 1994 ) .",
    "light curve may also exhibit color variations , although these may be difficult to detect because of small amplitude .",
    "one of the ogle microlensing candidates found during the ogle search , ogle # 7 , exhibits very unusual light variations which do not resemble variations of any known variable stars . on the other hand ,",
    "the light variations are strikingly similar to the theoretical light curves possible for binary microlenses ( mao & paczyski 1991 ) . in this _ letter _",
    "we present a detailed analysis of the variability of ogle # 7 candidate , emphasizing binary microlensing as a possible explanation of observed light variations .",
    "section 2 describes details of the observations , section 3 , the ogle # 7 light curve and section 4 , possible explanations of its photometric behavior .",
    "we conclude the paper with a discussion in section 5 .",
    "the ogle microlensing search is conducted using the 1-m swope telescope at las campanas observatory which is operated by carnegie institution of washington . a @xmath4 pixels loral ccd chip , giving the scale of 0.44 arcsec / pixel at 1-m telescope focus , is used as a detector .",
    "collected frames feed the data pipeline which , almost in real time , derives the photometry of objects .",
    "the main search is conducted in the @xmath1-band with some frames occasionally taken in the @xmath5-band .",
    "details of the reduction techniques are described in udalski et al .",
    "( 1992 ) .",
    "ogle # 7 candidate : the baade s window field bw8 ( udalski et al .",
    "1992 ) star @xmath1  198503  has been detected during the regular microlensing search as described in udalski et al .",
    "( 1993b ) and udalski et al .",
    "( 1994a ) .",
    "it was also detected in a fully algorithmic search described by udalski et al .",
    "( 1994b ) , although that detection could have been accidental since the ogle # 7 light curve is different from the regular microlensing light curve used in the algorithm .    to minimize the photometric errors resulting from instrumental errors and from the general technique of reductions used in the ogle search , the final differential photometry of ogle # 7 with respect to two bright , nearby stars was derived as in udalski et al .",
    "( 1994a ) .",
    "differential photometry was then tied to the standard system .",
    "table 1 contains the position and colors of ogle  # 7 and the comparison stars .",
    "a @xmath6 arcsecs region centered on the star is shown in figure  1 .",
    "figure 2 shows the light and @xmath7 color curves of ogle # 7 from the 1992 and 1993 observing seasons .",
    "the error bars correspond to the errors given by the photometry code dophot ( schechter , mateo , and saha 1993 ) rescaled by 1.4 to approximate the real errors of observation ( udalski et al .",
    "1994b ) .    during the 1992 observing season the brightness of ogle # 7 remained at a constant level with @xmath8 mag and the star",
    "therefore was included in the non - variable object database for the microlensing search .",
    "dramatic light changes occurred in the next ( 1993 ) observing season . at the beginning of",
    "the 1993 observing season the star was still close to its previous low light level : @xmath9 .",
    "then it brightened gradually by about 0.2 mag . around day @xmath10",
    "it rose rapidly by about 2 mag reaching @xmath11 .",
    "unfortunately , due to telescope scheduling constraints and unusually bad weather , that part of the light curve is sparsely covered by observations .",
    "moreover the observation taken at the maximum light was obtained in poor seeing conditions . nevertheless , due to the large brightness of ogle  # 7 at that time , the derived photometry is reliable . after reaching the maximum ,",
    "the brightness of ogle  # 7 faded and reached a plateau about 1 mag brighter than the minimum level .",
    "then it began to rise again , followed by an abrupt drop to the level 0.3 mag over the minimum level .",
    "after that , ogle  # 7 gradually faded to minimum brightness .",
    "the overall light variations have a double - maximum structure with ` u'-shape changes between them .",
    "very smooth light changes during the event indicate lack of short time scale variations exceeding a few hundreds of a magnitude .",
    "it is worth noting that the ogle  # 7 candidate is being continuously monitored during the ogle 1994 observing season . up to the time of writing this paper , the brightness of the star has remained at the low level with @xmath8 mag over the entire period @xmath12 : 1439  1560 .",
    "ogle  # 7 was monitored mainly in the @xmath1 filter . from six @xmath5-band observations",
    "the @xmath7 color of the star is @xmath13 .",
    "there is no information about color during the event .",
    "however , the observation taken after the event when the star was still about 0.3 mag above the minimum suggests no significant color variation .",
    "the photometric light curve of the ogle  # 7 indicates that we have discovered a very mysterious object with unusual properties . in this section",
    "we explore its true nature .",
    "the rapid increase of brightness might suggest some kind of eruptive variable as a possible explanation of the ogle  # 7 behavior .",
    "the amplitude of brightening excludes any type of cataclysmic variables other than dwarf novae or low - mass x - ray binaries ( lmbx ) .",
    "however , it seems unlikely that ogle  # 7 is a dwarf nova .",
    "first , the light curve does not resemble that of dwarf novae , and the duration of the event is much longer than typical dwarf novae outbursts or superoutbursts .",
    "second , the @xmath7 color of ogle  # 7 ( table  1 ) , @xmath14 , is too red for a typical dwarf nova system even after taking into account extinction toward the bulge ( upper limit : e@xmath15 mag , paczyski et al .",
    "1994a ) .    the remaining option among cataclysmic variables",
    " a low mass x - ray binary  also does not seem likely due to essentially the same arguments .",
    "the light curve does not resemble that of a low mass x - ray binary in a high state .",
    "it is very smooth , which indicates no light changes larger than a few hundreds of magnitude whereas lmxbs usually exhibit significant variations caused by reflection effects and/or by flickering .",
    "x - ray novae  a subgroup of x - ray binaries  can be excluded because the amplitude of ogle  # 7 is too small .",
    "the @xmath7 color seems to be also too red for a typical lmbx star .",
    "moreover , we are not aware of any detection of an x - ray source when ogle  # 7 was in a high state , nor of any known x - ray source close to the position of ogle  # 7",
    ".    another possibility could be a flaring late spectral type star .",
    "however , typical flares in such stars last minutes or hours , and we do not know any object with flares lasting for several days . also the double - maximum light curve does not resemble that of flaring stars . with such long optical coverage of ogle  # 7",
    "we would expect at least some traces of another flaring activity but we have not registered any other light increase except the event described above .",
    "the optical spectrum of ogle  # 7 could shed some light onto the nature of the object .",
    "as cataclysmic variables and flaring stars often reveal emission lines , their presence would be an argument in favor of an eruptive nature for the object .",
    "also , if the observed brightening is due to some eruptive processes , it should repeat in the future .",
    "lensing by binaries is naturally expected in @xmath16 of the ogle events ( mao & paczyski 1991 ) .",
    "it is thus statistically plausible to have one binary lensing event in the ten ogle events sample ( udalski et al .",
    "furthermore , the characteristic ` u'-shape light variations between maximas in ogle  # 7 s high state can be found in the theoretical light curves of binary lenses ( e.g. , mao & paczyski 1991 ) .",
    "the ` u ' shape is a result of the source crossing the caustics .",
    "another important argument in favor of the binary lens interpretation is provided by the colors of ogle  # 7 , which indicate that the star is a typical galactic bulge main sequence turn - off point star ( udalski et al .",
    "1994b ) and thus can be a source for microlensing .",
    "all the above considerations lead us to check whether a binary microlens model can reproduce the observed light curve .",
    "the fitting of a binary light curve has been studied in some detail by mao & di  stefano ( 1994 ) .",
    "the fitting involves the search for a global minimum of a @xmath17 measure in multiple dimensional parameter space .",
    "for the minimal binary model , there are seven parameters : i.e. , the total mass of the binary , @xmath18 ; the mass ratio of the individual masses , @xmath19 ; their separation , @xmath20 , as projected onto the lens plane ( defined in terms of the center of mass of the binary ) ; the closest approach to the center of mass , @xmath21 ; the time of closest approach , @xmath22 ; the angle between the axis of the binary and the trajectory , @xmath23 ; and , the magnitude of the star at the minimum light , @xmath24 .",
    "for the galactic bulge observations , we need one additional parameter , @xmath25 , the light contributed by the lensed star at minimum of light .",
    "this parameter is necessary to take into account the light contribution of the lens(es ) and/or a nearby star located close to the source with separation smaller than the seeing disk ( @xmath26 arcsec ) .",
    "for the technical details of the fitting procedure , the readers should refer to mao & di  stefano ( 1994 ) .    in fig .  2 we plot our best fit model .",
    "the model has a @xmath17 ( as defined in mao & di  stefano 1994 ) of 139 for 83 data points ( 75 degree of freedom ) .",
    "the @xmath17 for the varying part ( between days @xmath12 : 1085  1240 ) of the light curve is roughly 57 for 51 data points .",
    "the best fit parameters are , respectively , @xmath27 @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the einstein radius projected onto the source plane for the total mass @xmath18 .",
    "the lensing geometry is shown in fig .",
    "we have assumed that the lensed star is a point object , and ignored the circular component of the motions of the lenses and the earth on the scale of a few au .",
    "the validity of these assumptions will be checked below .",
    "the best fit indicates that about half of the ogle  # 7 light in the normal state must come from an additional source .",
    "there are two obvious possibilities for the additional light : a very close optical companion of the lensed star which can not be separated from the ground , or , the binary lensing system itself .    from the composite colors observed in the low , normal state we can put some limits on the components of such a blend .",
    "the combined magnitudes of the low state are @xmath30 and @xmath31 .",
    "thus the additional light must have @xmath32 while the lensed star @xmath33 .",
    "assuming that the lensed star should be in the galactic bulge its @xmath7 color should not exceed 2.5 mag ( see cmd in udalski et al .",
    "thus we can set a lower limit on the colors of the source of the additional light : @xmath34 and @xmath35 , and an upper limit on its intrinsic color : @xmath36 , where we have corrected the extinction for the baade s window field bw8 , @xmath37 ( paczyski et al .",
    "1994a )    if the additional light comes from the binary lensing system itself , both components of the system should have similar spectral type , as the mass ratio is close to one .",
    "thus the color limitation indicates that both components have spectral type later than k1 and their masses must be smaller than @xmath38 , assuming normal , solar metallicity main sequence stars . on the other hand , two k1 type stars can not be further from us than 4  5 kpc to have the observed @xmath5 luminosity ( assuming 1  1.2 mag extinction ) .",
    "fainter objects must have been located much closer .",
    "for example , early m type components would be only 1  2 kpc from us  a distance that makes lensing very unlikely .",
    "taking both limits together we conclude that if the lensing binary system is the only source of additional light then it must consist of two k - type stars with masses @xmath39 located in the galactic disk at a distance of 35 kpc .",
    "the second possibility for the additional light is a very close ( @xmath40 arcsec ) optical companion of the lensed star . in this case",
    "we can put only the following constraint on the lensed star : @xmath30 , @xmath41 if the companion is very red and does not contribute to the @xmath5-band .",
    "the most likely situation is a bulge companion with color @xmath42 which gives @xmath43 and @xmath44 . in either case",
    "the lensed star is a typical galactic bulge star ( udalski et al .",
    "1993a ) .",
    "we now check whether the assumption of the lensed star being a point object is valid .",
    "the lensed star @xmath1-band magnitude is @xmath33 , and it must lie on the line ( @xmath45 )  ( @xmath46 ) on the cmd . following paczyski et al .",
    "( 1994a ) , the extinction to the bw8 field and color excess are @xmath47 , @xmath37 , respectively .",
    "the absolute @xmath5 magnitude and intrinsic color of the source can be estimated to be in the range @xmath48 to @xmath49 , where we have assumed that the distance to the bulge is 8 kpc .",
    "that corresponds to a slightly evolved g - m spectral type main sequence star .",
    "the upper limit for the radius of such a star can be safely set to be @xmath50 .",
    "we can now compare this with the einstein radius , which is given by @xmath51 where @xmath52 is the total transverse velocity of the lens , observer and source projected onto the source plane .",
    "the source radius is at least one order of magnitude smaller than the inter - caustic spacing ( see fig .",
    "the point source approximation is excellent except for the points close the fold caustics .",
    "for these points , the source size sets a limit on the maximum magnification , @xmath53 . for ogle # 7 , this does not affect the fit .",
    "this can also be seen in fig .  2 , where the light curve shown is obtained for a star with radius @xmath54 .",
    "the resulting light curve fits the data as well as that of a point source .",
    "as the einstein radius is related to the mass of the lens , we can estimate the total mass of the binary lens to be @xmath55 where @xmath56 is the ratio of the distances to the lens and the lensed star .",
    "we have shown that if the additional light comes from the binary lens , then the lensing object must be located in the disk , about 4 kpc from us ( @xmath57 ) where the most likely velocity is about 200 .",
    "( [ m ] ) then gives a total mass of @xmath58 , i.e. , about @xmath59 for each component in excellent agreement with the color constraints .",
    "the circular velocity of the binary can be easily calculated to be @xmath60 , an order of magnitude smaller than the expected transverse velocity . also , the circular motion of the earth around the sun is small , @xmath61 , compared with the transverse velocity . thus both can be ignored .",
    "in the previous section we considered possible explanations of the strange photometric behavior of ogle  # 7 .",
    "it seems that the binary microlens model is the most likely explanation , as the model reproduces well the light variations and explains the observed colors of the star .",
    "however , we can not rule out the possibility that we have discovered a completely new type of variable star , and that the binary microlens model is simply a false positive ( cf .",
    "mao & di  stefano 1994 ) .",
    "however , such a false positive seems unlikely .",
    "generally speaking , there may be multiple binary lens fits to a given light curve , especially one with weak ( small amplitude ) lensing signature ( mao & di  stefano 1994 ) .",
    "fortunately , ogle # 7 is a very strong event ( brightening by more than two magnitudes ) with distinctive features ; correspondingly the models are well constrained .",
    "the best model presented here is significantly better than any other fits we have found .",
    "we believe that it is probably the unique solution in the multiple dimensional parameter space .",
    "our model not only provides a good fit to the somewhat sparsely sampled light curve , it also makes a very specific prediction , i.e. , the spectrum should be a composite of at least two sources of comparable brightness .",
    "if the extra light in our model is contributed by an additional source close to the lensed star , then the additional source is likely to have a different radial velocity from the lensed star .",
    "the velocity difference may not be large , therefore high dispersion instruments ( e.g. , keck telescope ) are needed . on the other hand ,",
    "if the binary lens contributed the extra light , then the circular motion of the two components ( @xmath62 ) can be measured spectroscopically .",
    "this will in turn reliably determine the other parameters ( including the lens mass ) in our model .",
    "there is one more test which distinguishes the lensing model from other kinds of variability .",
    "the microlensing event should not repeat , as the probability of the same star being microlensed more than once is practically zero .",
    "thus if brightening of ogle  # 7 repeats , then the microlens model will have to be rejected . to summarize , all the observations are fully consistent with the binary microlens model ; our model can be further tested by high dispersion spectroscopic observations from the ground , by high resolution imaging with hst and by future long - term monitoring of the source .",
    "if future observations contradict the prediction of the binary scenario , then more elaborate models will have to be invented , a possibility we choose not to pursue here .",
    "the theoretical estimate that 10% of the events may exhibit binary features ( mao & paczyski 1991 ) was based on the binary population study of the solar neighborhood . however , it is conceivable that the fraction could be higher if the stellar population in the bulge is different .",
    "binary light curves are usually very bright ( ogle # 7 reaches 15  mag in the @xmath1 band ) , therefore these events can be more easily detected than single lens events . with the implementation of the early warning system of ogle ( paczyski 1994 ) , most of these binary events can be caught in the early stages and therefore be well sampled in the bright caustic crossing phase . for the microlens model of ogle # 7 , the caustic crossing lasted for only @xmath63 hours .",
    "this indicates that frequent sampling is extremely important .",
    "a densely sampled caustic crossing event will allow us to resolve the structure of the source more easily than for the case of a single lens ( gould 1994 ; nemiroff & wickramasinghe 1994 ; witt & mao 1994 ) .",
    "in addition , relatively small changes in the lensing parameters will induce large change in the light curve ; therefore , a well sampled binary lens light curve offers the hope that all of the parameters can be determined accurately , including the mass of the lenses .",
