    "with the advent of high - multiplicity heavy - ion collisions at the cern sps and rhic there is the possibility to extract statistically significant dynamical information from individual collision events . by determining the degree of correlation of the multiparticle final state for individual events within a large ensemble of events one can probe the dynamical history of collisions and the qcd phase boundary .",
    "this process is called event - by - event ( ebye ) analysis .    a central issue for ebye analysis is the question whether or not collision events with similar initial conditions experience the same dynamical history , excepting finite - number fluctuations and known hadronic variance sources .",
    "if similarly prepared events differ significantly from one another beyond expectation , then analysis must proceed to categorize events into dynamical classes or on a continuum , and to provide a physics interpretation for nontrivial variations .",
    "based on very general arguments and the observed behavior of normal bulk matter near phase boundaries we expect to observe significant changes in fluctuations near the qcd phase boundary .",
    "the amplitude and character of these changes and their observability given finite collision systems and non - equilibrium collision trajectories are major questions for ebye physics .",
    "experimentally , the problem calls for extracting all available information from each event by a complete topological analysis in order to obtain maximum sensitivity to dynamical fluctuations .",
    "various measures can be used to categorize events by their ` morphology . '",
    "the common element of all measures is the correlation content of the multiparticle final state .",
    "correlation measures can be loosely grouped into _ global measures _ , some of which have counterparts in thermodynamics , and _ scale - local measures _ , which explicitly determine the scale dependence of correlations .",
    "given an event - wise measure we also require a corresponding _ comparison _ measure to enable quantitative event comparisons .",
    "in this paper i emphasize ebye analysis techniques which relate to variances and second moments .",
    "these global statistical measures are directly related to two - point correlation measures defined in various pair spaces .",
    "higher moments are related to general @xmath0-point correlations and are more efficiently dealt with by a generalized system of _ scale - local _ ebye analysis which will be treated in subsequent papers .",
    "the emphasis on variances and two - point correlations in this paper is both timely and provides a reasonably accessible introductory treatment of ebye analysis .",
    "the paper describes the general types of ebye analysis , the available system of correlation measures , the system of ensembles and its relationship to topological partition systems , considers maximally symmetric systems and the statistical model as archetypal correlation reference systems , the relationship between fluctuations and correlations , introduces the central limit theorem as an archetype for variance comparison , considers a fluctuation comparison measure ( @xmath1 ) as a difference between @xmath2 fluctuation amplitudes , analyzes the structure of @xmath1 as a specific variance comparison measure , introduces the concept of scale - dependent covariance matrices as a generalized measure system , relates scale - dependent covariance to a system of two - point correlation integrals , and considers the novel connections between scale invariance and the central limit theorem which arise from this work .",
    "correlation measures provide the basic analytical infrastructure for ebye analysis .",
    "a complete characterization of the correlation content of the multiparticle final state should exhaust all significant information in the data .",
    "comparison of event - wise correlations in a data system with those of a reference system ( which may invoke ` equilibrium ' or an assumption of maximum symmetry ) offers a precise means to detect deviations from a model or ensemble average .",
    "significant deviations provide a basis for discovering new physics .",
    "one then attempts to understand the physical origin of these deviations , leading to a revised model as part of an oscillatory ( but hopefully converging ) scientific process .",

    "we are usually not interested in the ` dc ' aspects of correlation common to every event , but only in those ` ac ' aspects that change from one event to another .    type a analysis generally requires large acceptance and large event multiplicity .",
    "one attempts to characterize all correlation aspects of each collision event over most of phase space , at least implicitly using @xmath0-particle correlations , where @xmath0 may range up to a significant fraction of the event multiplicity .",
    "questions of interest include large - scale variations in collision dynamics ( dynamical fluctuations ) such as flow fluctuations , baryon stopping fluctuations , jets , departures from chemical and thermal equilibration and chiral symmetry variations .",

    "this relation then implies that any variation in total variance over a scale interval ( the object of a clt test ) corresponds to a nonzero difference between object and reference autocorrelation densities over that interval .",
    "since the autocorrelation density is a quantitative symmetry measure we see that scale - invariance of total variance is intimately related to the scale - dependent _ relative symmetry _ of object and reference distributions .",

    "results obtained with such a partition must be carefully interpreted over a restricted scale interval .",

    "there is also the problem that other correlation sources may compete with resonance decay to alter @xmath162 fluctuations .      in @xcite",
    "it is proposed to increase sensitivity to possible qgp ` signals ' by a combined analysis of the covariance of two or more global event properties .",
    "event - wise antiproton multiplicity and transverse emitter radius are considered as an example .",
    "this approach is similar to the analysis format presented in sec .",
    "[ covar ] , but without use of a reference to form a comparison measure .",
    "the centrality dependence of covariance is itself taken as the indicator of unexpected behavior .",
    "one interesting aspect of this proposed application is that one of the measures is not a simple disttribution statistic like total multiplicity or mean @xmath114 but a more complex correlation aspect of the two - point momentum disttribution .",
    "this proposal is consistent with a general program to measure fluctuations of all kinds in the neighborhood of a phase boundary in order to better understand the underlying lagrangian by enumerating and identifying the relevant @xmath9 for various constraints .",
    "the underlying model premise in @xcite is that , depending on centrality , collisions may fluctuate between two disconnected event classes , one ( @xmath0 ) manifesting characteristics associated with qgp formation ( _ e.g. , _ increased emitter radius and antiproton abundance mean values ) and the other ( @xmath163 ) manifesting conventional hadronic systematic variation with participant number .",
    "the measure system in this case is @xmath164 , and the centrality dependence of the covariance is contrasted with that of the mean values of the measures for sensitivity in terms of this fluctuation model . while the paper emphasizes covariance measures it admits that variances would exhibit similar centrality dependence for this model .",
    "the central point is that attention to fluctuation measures is critical for detection of intermittent phenomena in collisions .",
    "the basic elements of the simulation are the estimated baseline measure fluctuations in the hadronic and qgp regimes , and the assumed shifts in mean values from one event class to the other .",
    "these assumptions determine all relevant aspects of the simulation .",
    "mean values for the two event classes [ h , q ] are given by @xmath165\\,(n_{ch}(b)/n_{max})$ ] ( antiproton multiplicity into star acceptance ) and @xmath166 \\ , ( n_{ch}(b)/n_{max})^{1/2}$ ] , where @xmath167 is the charged - particle total multiplicity used to infer event centrality and @xmath168 is the mean value for central collisions .",
    "variances are approximated by @xmath169 and @xmath170 , the second dominated by an estimate of measurement error rather than intrinsic statistical fluctuations .",
    "the result is a rather large increase in covariance in a crossover region of centrality where the two event types are nearly equiprobable .",
    "we observe in a scatter plot on @xmath171 that the joint distribution is bimodal due to the chosen relationship between assumed mean - value shifts and variances .",
    "the assumption of catastrophic fluctuations between two event types maximizes the effect of the model on variances and covariance .",
    "an alterative scenario consisting of a partial transition ( still first order ) over some fraction of the event volume ( having its own fluctuation structure ) would produce a significantly smaller effect on correlation measures .",
    "these model assumptions do however correspond to some popular qgp scenarios .",
    "we note that an expected major source of covariance , collision geometry and stopping fluctuations ( ` volume ' fluctuations ) as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ 2d ] and present for either event type , is here probabably underestimated by the poisson variance of @xmath167 .",
    "having modelled the most dramatic qgp scenarios one might then consider how to establish by these correlation measures either that a qgp hypothesis is falsified at some level , or that some fraction of some events does indeed undergo a transition to a nonhadronic phase . in the adopted scenario",
    "the input to the corelation measures is bimodal , a rather strong statistical manifestation .",
    "a weaker and possibly more realistic situation to simulate is one in which anomalous events form a tail structure on a hadronic core . in this case one",
    "has to compare carefully the centrality dependence of covariance matrix elements to that for a reference and perform a significance study of the result .",
    "there is much technical work needed to elaborate these and other ebye analysis methods .",
    "we see from these examples and interpretations that a general description of scale - local covariances and comparison measures permits a comprehensive interpretation of some apparently dissimilar methods .",
    "from the original concept of the elementary central limit theorem as an integral variance comparison measure for a gaussian fluctuation model , we have enlarged the analysis to multiple measures described by a covariance matrix , have expressed the basic comparison in a scale - dependent manner , have espressed the source of departure from the clt in terms of a matrix of scale integrals comparing object and reference two - point densities and have considered as the most differential form of comparison a direct analysis of density ratios on two - point measure spaces .",
    "from the vantage point of this scale - local picture we can now generalize the central limit theorem and reinterpret its role in the description of many - body systems . in terms of the new concepts the elementary clt as presented in sec .",
    "[ clt ] compares total variance for a single measure at two points on scale to determine whether additional variance has accumulated over the interval .",
    "the clt states that if there is no net correlation introduced within a scale interval the total variance of a measure is the same at each endpoint  @xmath172 .",
    "we have subsequently developed a greatly extended version of this elementary comparison procedure and generalized it to a pair - wise total ( co)variance comparison for an arbitrary measure system as represented by @xmath173 and have given the general form of the source of any total variance change in terms of a matrix of covariance integrals over two - point measure densities represented by @xmath174 .",
    "we can therefore generalize the clt to a statement about the scale invariance of covariance :    _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ the total covariance matrix @xmath175 for a measure system on the space @xmath41 is _ scale invariant _ over a bounded scale interval @xmath176 $ ] in the absence of all categories of _ net _ two - point measure correlation over the same scale interval .",

    "we have also introduced the possibility that a uniform reference ( implicit in standard variance calculations ) may be replaced by an arbitrary reference or model appropriate to a given problem .",
    "the resulting system offers the opportunity to choose from a continuum of techniques and references , depending on the fluctuation model and statistical power of the data .",
    "we have as our nominal goal identification and study of a quark - gluon plasma , a simplistic terminology for a complex phenomenon .",
    "it may be that the emergence of a color - deconfined qcd system is subtle and topological rather than catastrophic and thermodynamic .",
    "production of a qcd plasma as a catastrophic process with discontinuous signals may not be forthcoming . to insure the best opportunity for discovery we require sensitive quantitative comparison measures which extract complete correlation information from collision events .    in studying the correlation structure of hi collision events at the cern sps",
    "we have been struck by their sameness and ordinariness , the apparent close adherence to simple statistical fluctuations in the distribution of mean @xmath114 and the wide - ranging description of hadronic ratios and abundances by a simple statistical model with a universal chemical freezeout temperature .",
    "these two results are deeply connected by their relationship to the central limit theorem and related maximum symmetry principle .",
    "a common supposition has been promoted that qcd plasma formation at high energy densities may lead to dramatic , or easily quantifiable , changes in the correlation structure of the multiparticle final state , changes detectable by elementary correlation measures .",
    "given the unspectacular sps results we are now forced to re - evaluate our need for sensitivity .",
    "a central goal in ebye analysis has been to develop global comparison measures sensitive to excess variance which might signal residual correlations due to incomplete equilibration  possibly structure remaining from a phase transition .",
    "we have seen that these global measures are ultimately based on the central limit theorem as a statistical reference , and the clt is in turn based on a scale - integral concept .",
    "the present treatment makes it clear that global - variables analysis based on scale integrals  an unavoidable strategy in case of low statistical power  is rather limited in its sensitivity , interpretability and power to discriminate among various correlation sources .",
    "statistical power ( event multiplicity ) determines the optimum scale interval and scale resolution of a correlation analysis .",
    "low statistical power requires the use of integrals over space and scale to extract statistically meaningful correlation measures , with accompanying loss of information .",
    "higher statistical power makes possible extension of the analysis to scale - local differential measures and direct analysis of densities on two - point measure spaces .",
    "one can then study the scale dependence of density ratios to extract full correlation information from data .",
    "future developments include direct determination of two - point densities , analysis of scale - local topological measures extracted from these densities and extention of the analysis to higher moments ( @xmath177 ) .    the question of scale invariance represented by the clt is deeply related to the nature of distribution symmetries .",
    "scale - invariance is equivalent to constant autocorrelation ",
    "( [ deq ] )  which is in turn an indication of maximum symmetry .",
    "thus , the clt in its generalized form is a statement about symmetry variation over a bounded scale interval , _ a potentially new insight_. with a uniform distribution as reference one can inquire whether an object distribution is maximally symmetric over a scale interval and how its symmetries evolve dynamically . more generally , one can ask whether object and reference distributions have the _ same _ symmetry or autocorrelation over some scale interval .",
    "this presents a new approach to quantitative description of nonequilibrium systems and the equilibration process .",
    "scale - dependence of symmetry variation is the underlying issue in the study of phase transitions . near the qcd phase boundary hadrons and partons as dynamical objects are transitory and ill defined .",
    "basing a dynamical description on a particle hypothesis near a phase boundary is a poor strategy . to provide a fundamental treatment one",
    "must ultimately adopt a descriptive system in which particles are not fundamental elements , in which arbitrarily correlated measure systems play the central role .",
    "a generalized central limit theorem provides a basis for such an approach .",
    "one can study the symmetry dynamics of a measure system relative to a maximally symmetric system or other symmetry model .    in a broader sense we are probing the dynamics of vacuum symmetries within a violent collision .",
    "the more traditional study of symmetry _",
    "statics _ is carried out in asymptotic regions of a constraint space far from any phase boundary . symmetry",
    "_ dynamics _ is important in the neighborhood of a phase boundary .",
    "the qcd phase boundary marks a region of constraint space where the nature of vacuum symmetries is changing dramatically and fundamentally .",
    "this is a challenging undertaking requiring the best possible analysis techniques .",
