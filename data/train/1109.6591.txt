    "the carbon atom , with its three possible hybridization states , originates in nature very different elemental materials .",
    "the three possibilities ( @xmath1 , @xmath2 , @xmath0 ) correspond to three different prototypical structures : respectively diamond , graphitic - like structures ( such as graphite , graphene , carbon nanotubes , and fullerenes ) , and linear carbon chains ( known in the literature as _ polyynes _ @xcite or @xmath0 carbon chains , spccs in short ) .",
    "spccs were discovered in nature around 1968 @xcite , but their role in the arena of carbon - based nanostructures has been quite marginal : till very recently , spccs have been considered as exotic allotropic forms , mainly present in extraterrestrial environments . indeed , in the interstellar clouds formed in the explosions of carbon stars , novae , and supernovae , spccs have been detected aside with fullerenes @xcite , amorphous carbon dust , cyanopolyynes , and oligopolyynes .",
    "indeed , in the phase diagram of carbon , the field of existence of spccs coincides with that of fullerenes  @xcite .",
    "the high reactivity of spccs @xcite , and their tendency to undergo cross - linking to form sp@xmath3 structures , directed the experimental efforts towards complicate strategies for the stabilization of the spccs with molecular end - groups or their isolation in inert matrices @xcite . thanks to novel synthetic routes and strategies @xcite , polyynes of increasing length and different type of termination",
    "have been successfully synthesized and characterized @xcite .",
    "end - capped spccs ( often , but not exclusively , hydrogen - terminated ) are being synthesized by chemical / electrochemical / photochemical methods @xcite .",
    "spccs have also been produced from carbon by dynamic pressure @xcite .",
    "spccs or carbynoid material containing up to @xmath4 carbon atoms were synthesized , which opens a promising route toward molecular engineering of @xmath0-carbon structures @xcite .",
    "samples of pure carbon films grown by supersonic cluster beam deposition at room temperature have been characterized , and proven to contain a sizeable @xmath0 component @xcite .",
    "these spccs showed weaker stability relative to the @xmath2 component upon exposition to low pressure gases at room temperature @xcite .",
    "spccs have also been produced from stretched nanotubes @xcite .",

    "@xcite have realized spccs by stretching and thinning a graphene nanoribbon from its two free edges , by removing carbon rows until the number of rows becomes one or two .",
    "these spccs show a good stability under the beam of a transmission electron microscope ( tem ) for lengths up to a few nanometers .",
    "these experimental observations of spccs formation during the controlled electron irradiation of graphene planes resulted in an rapidly increasing interest in this field @xcite .",
    "meanwhile , the existence of intrinsic magnetism in pure carbon has been a matter of debate for quite some time @xcite .",
    "possible effects due to magnetic contaminants on the experimental results have been discussed @xcite .",
    "subsequently , it has been shown that possible contamination effects are unable to explain quantitatively the measured ferromagnetism , supporting the idea that carbon magnetism has an intrinsic origin @xcite .",
    "the existence of @xmath5-electron magnetism in pure carbon has now been widely accepted ( see e.g. @xcite ) . on the theoretical side , it is well known that magnetic instabilities exist at specific graphene edges @xcite , in defective graphene @xcite and nanotubes @xcite .",
    "the discovery of pure - carbon @xmath5-electron magnetism has also lead to speculations about possible applications of carbon - based magnetic materials in molecular electronic devices : for example , spintronic devices built around the phenomenon of spin - polarization localized at the 1-d zig - zag edges of graphene have been proposed @xcite .",
    "recently , the accent has been also put on the possibility to modify the magnetization optically @xcite .",
    "indeed , linear carbon chains are nowadays considered promising structures for nano - electronic applications @xcite .",
    "for example , they can be used as molecular bridges across graphene nanogap devices .",
    "potential applications for the realization of non - volatile memories and two - terminal atomic - scale switches have been demonstrated @xcite .",
    "the remarkable robustness of spccs terminated on pure carbon , graphene - like fragments , combined with the fast progresses in the synthesis of graphene and graphene derivatives , could open the way towards the realization of actual nanodevices based on @xmath0 + @xmath2 carbon nanostructures .",
    "the interest of such systems stems from the possibility to exploit their peculiar semiconducting - magnetic behavior , in order to achieve novel characteristics and functions for the target devices .    clearly , the possibility of designing graphene - based magnetic nanostructures is particularly intriguing .",
    "the capability of arranging the spins inside a carbon structure in a variety of ways , could open the way for the construction of completely novel devices @xcite .",
    "possible future applications for spccs in interaction with the graphene - type system could be the construction of microchips with ferromagnetic or antiferromagnetic character that can be controlled by nanomanipulation and read out by nanocurrents .    in sect .",

    "this system is representative of a class of @xmath6 systems , which are at the core of an intense experimental work @xcite . to address the structural , vibrational , and electronic properties of spccs inserted into a nanometer - sized hole defect of a graphene layer , we resort to the dft .",
    "the plane - wave pseudopotential method and the local spin - density approximation ( lsda ) to dft have provided a simple framework whose accuracy have been demonstrated in a variety of systems @xcite .",
    "the time - honored lda is one in many functionals being used for current dft studies of molecular and solid - state systems : other functionals often improve one or another of the systematic defects of lda ( underestimation of the energy gap , small overbinding and tiny overestimation of the vibrational frequencies ) , but to date no functional is universally accepted to provide systematically better accuracy than lda for all properties of arbitrary systems . for a covalent system of @xmath7 and @xmath8 electrons as the one studied here , lda is appropriate , and we expect our results to change by a few percent at most if the calculations were repeated using some other popular functional @xcite .",
    "we compute the total adiabatic energies by means of the code quantum espresso @xcite , which computes forces by standard hellmann - feynman method .",
    "each self - consistent electronic - structure calculation stops when the total energy changes by less than @xmath9  ry .",

    "[ slab_pos : fig ] . within this cell , a complete graphene layer",
    "is then represented by @xmath16 carbon atoms .",
    "we represent the graphite surface in the slab approximation , as one or a few stacked graphene layers : to ensure that the interaction between periodic images of the graphene sheet is negligible we interpose at least @xmath17  nm of vacuum along the @xmath18 direction .",
    "we have selected this cell size as it allows us to create reasonably large nanoholes in the graphene layers , with fairly small interaction between the supercell repeated copies of the nanohole itself , at the price of a manageable computer time .",
    "we cover electronic band dispersion the electron bands in the horizontal plane by means of a @xmath19 @xmath20-centered * k*-point mesh .",

    "starting from the perfect graphene foil of fig .",
    "[ slab_pos : fig ] , we remove selected atoms in order to form a nh .",
    "the size of the nh should be such that inserted spccs fit and only bind at their ends .",
    "if the nh is too small , then spcc atoms would tend to reconstruct the edges of the hole , as illustrated in the examples of figs .",
    "[ hole_little : fig ] and [ hole_esa : fig ] . there",
    ", the small spcc - edge distance leads to spontaneous ( barrier - free ) edge reconstruction with the formation of additional squares or pentagons .",
    "we must therefore construct a large enough nh , in particular allowing for a distance of at least @xmath4  pm between the spcc and the nearest nh edge in order to prevent recombination reactions .",
    "figure  [ hole_pos : fig ] shows the minimal nh with such property .",
    "starting from the perfect graphene of fig .",
    "[ slab_pos : fig ] , the nh is obtained by removing @xmath22 atoms forming a rectangular hole of size @xmath23pm  @xmath24pm with both zig - zag armchair edges .",
    "the size of the nh permits us to investigate the insertion of several spccs , from c@xmath25 to c@xmath26 atoms long , with various positions relative to the nh edges .",
    "in an experiment @xcite , spccs are likely to be bound to extended @xmath2 structures , more reminiscent of graphite than of graphene . such a configuration could be described for example with one layer of perfect graphene plus a layer with a nh , such as that described above sect .",
    "[ nanohole : sec ] .",
    "figure  [ carb6_2lay : fig ] shows this configuration with the insertion of a c@xmath27 polyyne .",
    "the upper graphene layer and the polyyne are fully relaxed , while the lower layer is kept frozen in ideal graphitic positions .",
    "the equilibrium distance between the two layers , @xmath28  pm , is very close to the observed interlayer distance of graphite , @xmath29  pm .",
    "the resulting system composed of over @xmath30 atoms is computationally quite expensive : indeed , with a modern parallel computer using @xmath31 xeon - class processors , it took more than two weeks to obtain a fully relaxed configuration . on the other hand",
    ", we verified that the properties of the upper layer do not change significantly without the lower ( perfect ) sheet , whose effective corrugation is quite small .",
    "indeed , the forces between the two layers are weak long - range forces whose action is mild and almost translationally invariant , compared to the intra - layer forces acting in the nh layer .",
    "the dft - lsda evaluation of such weak dispersive forces is unreliable anyway .",
    "these observations suggest that it makes sense to consider the single layer containing the nh and the c@xmath32 spcc inserted into it , and leave the fixed substrate layer out .",
    "the relaxation of the positions , performed in the same conditions as above , took about one week only in this 1-layer configuration involving @xmath33 c atoms rather than 200 ones .",
