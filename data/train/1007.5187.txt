    "for the last two decades , diverse models of deformed oscillators have received much attention due to both their unusual properties , as compared with the standard quantum harmonic oscillator , and their great potential for being applied in description of miscellaneous physical systems showing essential nonlinearities .",
    "the diversity of applications ranges from , say , quantum optics and landau problem to high energy quantum particle phenomenology , modern quantum field theory and d - brane ( string ) theory @xcite . among",
    "the best known , extensively studied deformed oscillators we encounter such as the @xmath3-deformed arik - coon ( ac ) one @xcite and biedenharn - macfarlane ( bm ) one @xcite , as well as the two - parameter @xmath4-deformed oscillator @xcite .",
    "besides , there exists the @xmath3-deformed tamm - dancoff ( td ) oscillator @xcite , also explored though to much lesser extent @xcite . unlike all these , there is very modest knowledge concerning the so - called @xmath0-deformed oscillator .",
    "introduced in @xcite more than a decade and half ago , the @xmath0-oscillator essentially differs from the models already mentioned and exhibits rather unusual properties @xcite .",
    "an important direction of applying deformed oscillators ( deformed bosons ) is the elaboration on their base of the respective deformed versions of bose gas model , like the @xmath3- or @xmath5-bose gas models in @xcite,@xcite .",
    "the @xmath3-deformed extensions of bose gas are used in modern approaches to @xmath6he theory , see e.g. @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , @xmath3-bose and @xmath5-bose gas models provide an efficient ground for successful description of the observed , in the experiments on heavy ion collisions , unusual behavior of two - pion and three - pion momentum correlations .",
    "as shown in @xcite the intercept @xmath1 , see formula ( 10 ) below , of the two - particle momentum correlation function derived in the deformed bose gas models based on the ac- or bm - type @xmath3-deformed oscillators , as well as on the @xmath4-oscillators , lead to a successful modeling of the nontrivial , non - bose type ( such that basically differ from bosonic case ) properties of pion correlation intercepts in the rhic and cern sps experiments on relativistic collisions of nuclei .",
    "inspired by those results , in this paper we undertake an analogous study basing on @xmath0-oscillators ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "central place in our treatment is given to calculation , within the @xmath0-bose gas model involving @xmath0-bosons ( @xmath0-oscillators ) , of the two- and three - particle correlation function intercepts @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "for these we establish asymptotically constant type of behavior ( _ i.e. _ , asymptotical approaching to a constant given solely by @xmath0 ) . in addition",
    ", we make some comparison of the obtained results for intercepts with the existing data .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "main facts about the @xmath0-oscillator are given .",
    "for our goals we use the concept of the _ deformation structure function _ @xcite denoted as @xmath7 . here",
    "we also sketch some unusual properties of the @xmath0-oscillator such as the possibility of accidental degeneracy of energy levels and the non - fibonacci nature of its energy spectrum .",
    "section 3 is devoted to calculation of the intercepts of two- and three - particle momentum correlation functions .",
    "namely , within the @xmath0-bose gas model based on @xmath0-oscillators we calculate these intercepts , for fixed order of approximation .",
    "derivation of their large momentum asymptotics which is one of our main results is given in section 4 .",
    "next 5th section is devoted to a comparison with some experimental data , and with analogous results obtained earlier within other ( @xmath3- or @xmath5- ) deformed bose gas models .",
    "the paper ends with concluding remarks .",
    "appendix a contains the data for the mean values or thermal averages of diverse orders ( for powers of the number operator ) , as well as some interesting properties of the coefficients appearing in the mean values .",
    "in the theory of deformed oscillators it is both convenient and efficient to use the concept of _ deformation structure function _ , either in the @xmath7 version @xcite or in the @xmath8 version @xcite . in our present treatment we prefer to use the former variant @xmath7 .",
    "each specialized structure function determines the particular deformed oscillator model through its corresponding oscillator algebra , a unital algebra given in terms of the elements @xmath9 , @xmath10 , @xmath11 .",
    "these generating elements of the algebra of a particular model of linear ( usual ) or nonlinear ( deformed ) quantum oscillator obey the defining relations @xmath12=f(n ) , \\label{1}\\ ] ] @xmath13=a^{\\dagger } , \\hspace{15 mm } [ n , a]=-a .",

    "the relation ( [ 1 ] ) involves @xmath15 , function of the number operator @xmath11 .",
    "for the usual quantum oscillator , @xmath16 , @xmath17 and @xmath18 . for general deformed oscillator , like in @xcite",
    ", we introduce the deformation structure function @xmath7 according to the relations @xmath19 due to ( [ 1 ] ) and ( [ 3 ] ) , the basic commutation relation takes the form @xmath20 that is , the defining commutation relation is unambiguously given by structure function .",
    "the hamiltonian @xmath21 will be taken in the standard form @xmath22 . here and below we put @xmath23 . in terms of structure function",
    "the hamiltonian is @xmath24 we use the @xmath3-analog of fock space . within it , from the ground state obeying @xmath25 all the @xmath26-particle excited states are generated such that @xmath27 the @xmath26-particle _ normalized _ state is given by the formula @xmath28 the creation and annihilation operators @xmath10 , @xmath9 when acting on the @xmath26-particle state give @xmath29    in what follows we focus on the so called @xmath0-deformed oscillator @xcite for which the generating elements @xmath9 , @xmath10 and @xmath11 of the corresponding algebra obey ( [ 2 ] ) and ( [ 4 ] ) , and the defining structure function is @xmath30 where @xmath0 is the deformation parameter , @xmath31 . with this",
    ", the basic relation and the energy spectrum for the hamiltonian ( [ 5 ] ) of @xmath0-oscillator take the form @xmath32 @xmath33 setting @xmath34 recovers the algebra and the energies of the usual harmonic oscillator .",
    "note that the linear structure function @xmath35 , which determines the standard quantum oscillator , stems as particular case in the limit of deformation parameter(s ) , such as @xmath36 for @xmath3-oscillators or @xmath37 in the present case of @xmath0-oscillator , from each model of deformed oscillators ( a kind of consistency ) .",
    "_ unusual properties of @xmath0-oscillator _    the ground state energy and the large @xmath26 asymptotics for the energy of @xmath0-oscillator are respectively @xmath38 and @xmath39 .",
    "both of these values basically differ from the analogous value and limit for the usual oscillator , @xmath40 and @xmath41 .",
    "moreover , the ground state @xmath42 of the @xmath0-oscillator differs also from that of the fibonacci oscillators such as @xmath4-deformed family and its one - parameter @xmath3-deformed subfamilies ( ac , bm , td ) , for which zeroth level energy is @xmath40 exactly as for the standard oscillator .",
    "the just mentioned unusual feature of the @xmath0-oscillator is tightly connected with the next its peculiarity : the @xmath0-oscillator unlike the @xmath4-deformed one does not belong to the class of fibonacci oscillators .",
    "namely , as shown in detail in the recent paper @xcite the @xmath0-oscillator is typical representative of the wide class of so - called quasi - fibonacci oscillators .",
    "it is important that the @xmath0-oscillator admits nontrivial extensions , in particular through combining it with other ( @xmath3- or @xmath4- ) deformed oscillators .",
    "any such extension will inherit the peculiarities of those simpler deformed oscillators from which it is composed , as shown in @xcite .",
    "as can be demonstrated for positive @xmath0 such that @xmath43 , the @xmath0-oscillator admits occurrence of accidental energy level degeneracy if it is extended by at least one deformation parameter .",
    "however , unlike the case of tamm - dancoff @xmath3-deformed oscillator @xcite , here not all types of pairwise energy level degeneracies are possible .    in other words ,",
    "direct two- or three - parameter extensions of @xmath0-oscillator can exhibit the phenomena of accidental degeneracy ( arising in the absence of any obvious underlying symmetry ) of energy levels . in more detail",
    "this property will be studied elsewhere ( see however @xcite where the ability to display accidental energy levels degeneracy has been demonstrated for the @xmath4-deformed and some @xmath3-deformed oscillators ) .",
    "any real system of particles is far from being ideal .",
    "therefore , a necessity arises to make complete account of inter - particle interactions . besides",
    ", the nonzero proper volume or substructure of particles may also be of importance .",
    "for all these issues it is known that the system admits effective description by means of deformed oscillators @xcite .",
    "due to that , the system can be treated as an ideal one , but consisting of unconventional appropriately deformed `` bosons '' . as result , account of any of the indicated complications or reasons turns out",
    "to be effectively incorporated just in the particular deformation , with its specific deformation parameter(s ) .",
    "such an effective picture which uses the @xmath3-deformed oscillators has been applied to develop the related @xmath3-bose gas model , with subsequent successful application to superfluid @xmath6he @xcite or to an effective description @xcite of the observed type behavior of the intercept @xmath44 of two - particle momentum correlation function of pions produced and registered in the experiments on heavy - ion collisions . ``",
    "non - bose '' means that the existing data for the intercept clearly demonstrate the trend and the values that principally differ ( see _ e.g. _ @xcite ) from the would - be constant intercept equal to 1 at any momentum , for the pions viewed as pure bosons .",
    "more advanced picture which involves the two - parameter @xmath4-deformed oscillators and treats correlation function intercepts within the @xmath4-bose gas model , along with analogous application , has been developed in @xcite . below",
    "we exploit similar ideas for the case of @xmath0-bose gas model .      in the experiments on heavy ion - collisions ,",
    "the colliding ( primary ) particles generate , as the products of collisions , a miriads of secondary particles , _",
    "e.g. _ pions , which are then detected . as known @xcite ,",
    "correlation functions carry important information concerning geometry and dynamics of the emitting sources .",
    "the probability for a joint observation of two particles with momenta @xmath45 and @xmath46 is given by @xmath47 .",
    "the two - particle momentum correlation function is defined , see _ e.g. _",
    "@xcite , as @xmath48 where @xmath49 , @xmath50 , means pure single - particle probability distribution for @xmath51-th particle and @xmath52 is normalizing factor .",
    "we put @xmath53 in what follows .",
    "it is common to denote the difference of 4-momenta of the pair by @xmath54 and the mean 4-momentum by @xmath55 . in the case of",
    "two identical ( of mass @xmath56 ) bosons and coinciding momenta , the @xmath57 is vanishing .",
    "then the two - particle correlation function in variables @xmath58 , @xmath57 , and the reduced case @xmath59 of it , is @xmath60 where @xmath61 does appear .",
    "the entity @xmath62 at an early stage was usually called the `` coherence '' or ( non- ) chaoticity parameter . on the other hand , since @xmath63 at @xmath64 attains its maximal value , @xmath65 is also termed the _ intercept _ of the correlation function @xmath63 ( and similarly for @xmath26-th order correlation functions @xmath66 ) .",
    "we will prefer to use the latter term because , as stressed in @xcite , even in case of complete chaoticity of sources the intercept can attain the values differing from the would - be purely bosonic ones @xcite .",
    "the intercept can be expressed @xcite in terms of particle ( whose momentum is @xmath58 ) creation and annihilation operators as @xmath67 a natural way to obtain after calculations the _ nontrivial _ ( non - constant ) form of the intercept is to use some version of deformed oscillator and to develop on this base the corresponding deformed bose gas model .",
    "as mentioned , the explicit form of @xmath1 has been earlier obtained in @xcite in the framework of deformed versions of bose gas model based on the popular ac- , bm- , @xmath4-type deformed oscillator models . in the case of @xmath4-bosons this result was extended @xcite to the @xmath26-particle correlation function intercepts @xmath68 .",
    "here we use the set of @xmath0-oscillators to develop the corresponding @xmath0-bose gas model . within it",
    ", we derive the intercepts of the two - particle and three - particle correlation functions . for that goal",
    "we take ( [ 11 ] ) as our starting point and in view of ( [ 3 ] ) make account of the defining structure function of the chosen @xmath0-oscillator , namely @xmath69_{\\mu}\\equiv\\frac{n}{1+\\mu n}\\ .",

    "so , in calculating @xmath80 we deal with series and hence use some approximation .",
    "let us restrict ourselves with the approximation in ( [ 16 ] ) up to @xmath81 . in this case",

    "we observe the important fact that in the asymptotics , the intercept does not depend on the particle mass , nor on the temperature or momenta : the deformation parameter @xmath0 is the only entity that survives and completely determines the @xmath170 asymptotics of @xmath171 .",
