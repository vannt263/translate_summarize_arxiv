    "toward the end of the millennium , cosmology has matured into a phenomenological science .",

    "is the determination of cosmological parameters , in particular , the hubble constant @xmath1 , the matter density faction @xmath2 , and the density fraction contributed by the cosmological constant @xmath3 .",
    "observation of distant type ia supernovae ( sne ia ) has become an increasingly powerful means of measuring cosmological parameters ( @xcite , 1998 ; @xcite ; @xcite ) , because sne ia can be calibrated to be good standard candles at cosmological distances .",
    "( @xcite )    a type ia sn is the thermonuclear explosion of a carbon - oxygen white dwarf in a binary when the rate of the mass transfer from the companion star is high .",
    "the sn explosion blows the white dwarf completely apart .",
    "the radioactive decay of the isotopes @xmath4ni and @xmath4co is responsible for much of the light emitted .",
    "the sn lightcurve reaches a maximum about 15 days after the explosion and then declines slowly over years .",
    "a sn can outshine the galaxy in which it lies .",
    "two independent groups ( @xcite ) have made systematic searches for sne ia for the purpose of measuring cosmological parameters .",
    "their preliminary results seem to indicate a low matter density universe , possibly with a sizable cosmological constant . even though the uncertainty in these results is large",
    ", they clearly demonstrate that the observation of sne ia can potentially become a reliable probe of cosmology .",
    "however , there are important systematic uncertainties of sne ia as standard candles , in particular , luminosity evolution and gravitational lensing . to constrain the evolution of sn ia peak absolute luminosities",
    ", we need a large number of sne ia at significantly different redshifts ( low @xmath5 and @xmath6 ) , which is not available at present . both groups have assumed a smooth universe in their data analysis , although they include lensing in their error budgets . since we live in a clumpy universe",
    ", the effect of gravitational lensing must be taken into account adequately for the proper interpretation of sn data . at present , the small number of observed high @xmath5 sne ia prevents adequate modeling of gravitational lensing effects .    in this paper",
    ", we propose a pencil beam survey of sne ia that could yield between dozens to hundreds of sne ia in redshift bins of 0.1 up to @xmath0 ( see  3 ) which would allow the proper modeling of gravitational lensing , as well as a quantitative understanding of luminosity evolution .",
    "such a survey would yield a wealth of data which can be used to make accurate measurement of cosmological parameters and the sn rate , and provide powerful constraints on various aspects of the cosmological model . in  2 , we consider the weak lensing of sne ia .",
    "we simulate sn ia luminosities by adding weak lensing noise and scatter in sn ia absolute magnitudes to standard candles placed at random redshifts .",
    "we show how flux - averaging reduces the combined noise of gravitational lensing and scatter in sn ia absolute magnitudes . in  3 , we show that the number count of sne from a pencil beam survey is not sensitive to matter distribution in the universe ; it can be used as a test of models of cosmology and sn progenitors , or to measure the sn rate accurately . in  4 , we discuss the observational feasibility of the sn pencil beam survey .

    "5 contains conclusions .",
    "in a sn ia hubble diagram , one must use distance - redshift relations to make theoretical predictions . unlike angular separations and flux densities ,",
    "distances are not directly measurable , but they are indispensable theoretical intermediaries .",
    "the distance - redshift relations depend on the distribution of matter in the universe .    in a smooth friedmann - robertson - walker ( frw ) universe ,",
    "the metric is given by @xmath7 $ ] , where @xmath8 is the cosmic scale factor , and @xmath9 is the global curvature parameter ( @xmath10 ) . the comoving distance @xmath11 is given by [ eq : r(z ) ] r(z)= \\ { |_k|^1/2 _ 0^z dz^-1/2 } , where `` sinn '' is defined as sinh if @xmath12 , and sin if @xmath13 . if @xmath14 , the sinn and @xmath15 s disappear from eq.([eq : r(z ) ] ) , leaving only the integral .",
    "the angular diameter distance is given by @xmath16 , and the luminosity distance is given by @xmath17 .    however , our universe is clumpy rather than smooth . according to the focusing theorem in gravitational lens theory ,",
    "if there is any shear or matter along a beam connecting a source to an observer , the angular diameter distance of the source from the observer is _ smaller _ than that which would occur if the source were seen through an empty , shear - free cone , provided the affine parameter distance ( defined such that its element equals the proper distance element at the observer ) is the same and the beam has not gone through a caustic .",
    "an increase of shear or matter density along the beam decreases the angular diameter distance and consequently increases the observable flux for given @xmath5 .",
    "( schneider , ehlers , & falco 1992 )    the observation of sne ia at @xmath18 is important for the determination of cosmological parameters , but the dispersion in sn ia luminosities due to gravitational lensing can become comparable to the intrinsic dispersion of sne ia absolute magnitudes because the optical depth for gravitational lensing increases with redshift .",
    "if only a fraction @xmath19 ( known as the smoothness parameter ) of the matter density is smoothly distributed , the largest possible distance ( for given redshift ) for light bundles which have not passed through a caustic is given by the appropriate solution to the following equation : [ eq : dr ] g(z ) + _ m ( 1+z)^5 d_a=0 , where @xmath20 } $ ] .",

    "clearly , at @xmath6 , there is degeneracy of distances in a flat clumpy universe and an open smooth universe , and also in an open clumpy universe and a flat smooth universe with a sizable cosmological constant , as has been noted by a number of previous authors .",
    "( @xcite )    we can generalize the angular diameter distance @xmath29 by allowing the smoothness parameter @xmath19 to be _ direction dependent _ , i.e. , a property of the _ beam _ connecting the observer and the standard candle .",

    "`` batch '' search technique repetitively over the same field in the sky , the pencil beam survey would be efficient in the discovery of sne at @xmath117 by allowing the comparison of the latest frame of images ( which may consist of combined data from successive nights ) with all previous frames .",
    "the direct product of such a survey is the sn number count as a function of redshift ( see  3 ) , which is a combined measure of the cosmological parameters and the sn rate .",
    "when the measurements of the cosmological parameters are applied as priors to the number count , we obtain a direct measure of the sn rate , which is a key parameter in the formation and evolution of galaxies .",
    "the non - type - ia sne discovered by the pencil beam survey may be comparable to the type ia sne in number .",
    "the most important and straightforward application of the data from the sn pencil beam survey is to reduce the gravitational lensing noise in a sn ia hubble diagram via flux averaging .",
    "we have simulated sn ia luminosities by adding weak lensing noise ( using empirical fitting formulae given by wang 1999a ) and scatter in sn ia absolute magnitudes to standard candles placed at random redshifts .",
    "we have shown that flux - averaging is powerful in reducing the combined noise of gravitational lensing and sn ia absolute magnitude scatter ( see  2 ) . because of the non - gaussian nature of the luminosity distribution of sne ia at given @xmath5 due to weak lensing",
    ", the large number of sne ia in a given redshift interval at high @xmath5 is essential for the proper modeling and removal of the gravitational lensing effect .",
    "the sn ia luminosity distribution in each redshift interval can be used to constrain the cosmological model ( in particular , the fraction of matter in compact objects ) by comparison with predictions of numerical ray - shooting .",
    "( @xcite )    the completeness of the sn ia sample determines the effectiveness of the removal of gravitational lensing noise from the sn ia hubble diagram and the amount of information contained in the sn ia luminosity distribution in each redshift interval .",
    "note that the magnitude limit of the survey can lead to observational bias against the most distant demagnified sne , therefore , the sne which are close to the magnitude limit of the survey should not be used to probe cosmology in the manner described in this paper . to ensure the maximum usefulness of the data",
    ", scrupulous attention will have to be paid to photometric calibration , uniform treatment of nearby and distant samples , and an effective way to deal with reddening .",
    "( @xcite )    note that although we can remove or reduce the effect of gravitational lensing on the sn ia hubble diagram , other systematics can affect the observed luminosity of sne ia .",
    "for example , grey dust , an evolution of the reddening law , or evolution in the peak absolute luminosity of sne ia .",
    "while it is possible to constrain grey dust and determine dust evolution through multi - band photometry at significantly different redshifts , the dimming with @xmath5 in peak absolute luminosity of sne ia is degenerate with the effect of low matter density .",
    "( @xcite ) evolution will remain a caveat in the usage of sne ia as cosmological standard candles , unless one can somehow correct for the effect of evolution .",
    "it is critical to obtain up to hundreds of sne ia at @xmath6 to constrain luminosity evolution , because we expect the luminosity evolution and low matter density to affect the distance modulus of sne ia through different functionals of @xmath5 , which should become distinguishable at @xmath6 .",
    "we have proposed a survey cutoff of @xmath0 mainly for two reasons .",
    "first , going to higher redshift makes obtaining the spectra of the sne ( which are needed to distinguish different types of sne ) practically impossible from the ground ; even obtaining the spectra of @xmath118 sne ia may prove impractical from the ground ( as it would require several clear nights per spectrum on the keck , see  4 ) .",
    "observers have already demonstrated that sne ia up to @xmath136 can be found in the ongoing searches .",
    "( @xcite ) at @xmath118 , the sne ia should be @xmath137 magnitudes fainter than at @xmath138 , it should be possible to discover them on the ground through deep imaging , and the follow - up spectroscopy can be done on nicmos or ngst ( see  4 ) .",
    "second , predicted rest - frame sn ia rate per comoving volume as function of redshift seems to peak at @xmath138 .",
    "( @xcite ) a pencil beam survey of sne up to @xmath0 will enable the accurate determination of the sn rate as function of redshift in the redshift region important for studying cosmic star formation rate and the sn ia progenitor models .",
    "although the next generation space telescope can detect sne at as high redshifts as they exist ( @xcite ) , the estimated rate of detection is of order 20 sne ii per 4@xmath1394 arcmin@xmath121 field per year in the interval @xmath140 ( @xcite ) , and the detection rate of sne ia is likely smaller .",
    "thus a ground - based pencil beam survey of sne is essential to complement the space - based sn searches .",
    "the most challenging aspect of the sn pencil beam survey is obtaining spectra for the sne ia at redshifts close to 1.5 .",
    "instead of waiting for future space equipments , we may find innovative ways of obtaining spectra from the ground .",
    "the referee has pointed out that since we can find multiple sne at the same time on the same one square degree field ( the number of sne depends on cosmology ) , it may be possible to get multiple spectra at once with fibers .",
    "the nominal numbers we have used for the proposed sn pencil beam survey , a one square degree field , a depth of @xmath0 , and an effective observation duration of one year ( which is equivalent to several years of actual observation ) , are optimistic but not implausible . the large sky coverage and",
    "the long effective observation duration will probably require a large consortium of existing and new sn search teams through , for example , a dedicated 4 meter telescope which can be used at the same time for other important observational projects compatible with the sn pencil beam survey ( see  4 ) .",
    "the goal of going up to @xmath0 in spectroscopy will require support from the keck lris and nicmos / ngst .",
    "we conclude by noting that a sn pencil beam survey can yield enormous scientific return .",
    "the observational efforts directed towards a sn pencil beam survey should be very rewarding .",
