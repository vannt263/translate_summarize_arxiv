    "type  ia supernovae ( sne  ia ) are bright stellar explosions important for their role as distance indicators .",
    "sn  ia distances have been used to constrain the value of the hubble constant @xcite , and they also showed that our universe has a lower than critical matter density @xcite . @xcite and @xcite used distant ia sne to show that the universe currently has an accelerating rate of expansion implying a ` dark ' energy component . as more sn  ia observations have confirmed this result @xcite , the focus has shifted to constraining the properties of dark energy @xcite .",
    "systematic uncertainties in measuring dark energy parameters with supernovae now dominate over statistical errors @xcite and a better understanding of supernova physics may help to constrain dark energy properties using sne  ia .",
    "it is widely accepted that sne  ia are the result of thermonuclear explosions of carbon - oxygen white dwarfs ( wds ) , but the nature of the progenitor remains uncertain . in most models , the explosion occurs when the wd nears the chandrasekhar limit by gaining mass from a binary companion .",
    "this mass gain is achieved either by single - degenerate ( sd ) mass transfer or wd coalescence in a double - degenerate ( dd ) scenario . for a comprehensive review of these models ,",
    "see @xcite .",
    "observers have attempted to distinguish between the two models , with conflicting results .",
    "@xcite found that the extremely luminous supernova snls-03d3bb ( sn  2003fg ) had low ejecta velocity that could have resulted from a super - chandrasekhar progenitor .",
    "the high total mass and large nickel yield suggested that snls-03d3bb was the product of a dd merger .",
    "@xcite found that sn 2006gz had attributes consistent with the dd model .",
    "its spectrum showed significant amounts of unburned carbon , and a low silicon velocity at early phases .",
    "the very broad light curve implies a large yield of radioactive nickel as expected in the dd model @xcite , although late - time observations show only weak iron emission lines @xcite .",
    "even though the sd model is generally accepted as the most plausible @xcite , there is evidence that it might not be the complete story @xcite .",
    "some mixture of progenitors may be producing events with subtle differences in character .",
    "the explosion rates for these progenitor systems will depend on the age and the star formation history of the parent population , and the ratio of the different progenitors may not be constant through the history of the universe @xcite .",
    "understanding the origin of the phillips relation ( the correlation between light curve shape and peak luminosity ; @xcite ) and its dispersion is critical to improving sne  ia as reliable distance indicators .",
    "@xcite argued that radioactive nickel yield should be determined by progenitor metallicity , but age of the host galaxy stellar population appears to control the mass of @xmath7ni @xcite .",
    "progenitor metallicity may play a secondary role @xcite or have no significant effect on radioactive yield @xcite .",
    "recent models by @xcite show that variations in kinetic energy ( ke ) , metallicity , and mixing between burning layers provide light curves beyond the range of the observed phillips relation , implying that not all combinations of variables are found in real sne  ia .",
    "sn  ia luminosity and light curve shape may be influenced by the physics of the explosions .",
    "there is a consensus that normal sne  ia result from a detonation ( supersonic burning ) of much of the progenitor wd , but it likely begins as a deflagration ( subsonic fusion front ) to allow expansion and some burning at low densities .",
    "this model was first introduced by @xcite ; @xcite showed that the model matched the observed light curves and spectra very well . in the  delayed detonation \" scenario , the timing of the transition from deflagration to detonation provides a natural means of varying the radioactive nickel yield and generating the observed range of luminosities and decline rates @xcite .",
    "deflagrations tend to be very asymmetric , and if the asymmetries survive the detonation then viewing angle can result in perceived variations even for similar explosions @xcite .",
    "study of the early - time light curve may be important in diagnosing the progenitor problem and explosion physics @xcite .",
    "the work by @xcite to constrain the early light curves of local supernovae established the decline - rate - corrected average rise time of 19.5 @xmath8 0.2 days . here ,  rise time \"",
    "is defined as the time elapsed from explosion to peak _ b_-band flux . @xcite and @xcite demonstrated the consistency between high- and low - redshift rise times , and similar results",
    "were found by @xcite with a large set of snls @xcite supernovae .",
    "@xcite studied the rise times of sne  ia discovered behind the large magellanic cloud during the supermacho survey lens project and measured a 17.6@xmath9-day rise time in the equivalent of the @xmath2 bandpass .",
    "recently , @xcite analyzed eight low - redshift sne  ia with well - observed early light curves from a new perspective .",
    "a single  stretch \" parameter has commonly been used to describe the full range of @xmath1 and @xmath2 light curves by compressing or expanding the time axis around the epoch of peak brightness @xcite .",
    "@xcite decoupled the rise and decline portions of the eight nearby light curves and found that sne  ia can have a range of rise times for a given decline rate .",
    "his rise - time minus fall - time distribution ( @xmath10 ; hereafter defined as rmf ) roughly divided his small supernova sample into two groups , possibly suggesting two progenitors or explosion mechanisms .",
    "a larger set of sne is required to rigorously test this possibility .    here",
    ", we analyze light curves from the sloan digital sky survey - ii ( sdss - ii ) supernova survey @xcite which spectroscopically identified approximately 500 sne  ia over its three - year lifetime .",
    "the sdss - ii supernova survey scanned 300 deg@xmath11 of sky with a cadence as rapid as 2  days between visits ( weather and lunar phase often increased the time between observations of the same field ) , making the survey well suited to an early rise - time study .",
    "we also introduce a new fitting method that independently estimates the rise and the fall times of sne  ia light curves .",
    "the sdss - ii supernova survey @xcite was designed to find and characterize several hundred sne  ia at intermediate redshifts in order to fill in the supernova  desert \" between the nearby discoveries and thehigh-@xmath12 \" events .",
    "mapping the expansion history at @xmath13 provides unique tests of cosmological models and constrains systematic errors @xcite .",
    "the sdss - ii supernovae also provide a large , uniform , high - quality sample of sne  ia to study the properties of these explosions .",
    "the sdss - ii supernova survey operated three campaigns between 2005 , 2006 and 2007 september and december using the 2.5 m telescope @xcite at apache point observatory to scan 300 deg@xmath11 of sky as often as every - second night .",
    "template images were subtracted from each new night of data and software scanned for new variable objects .",
    "every candidate supernova was inspected visually to avoid image artifacts and asteroids .",
    "transients with a high probability of being sne  ia @xcite were queued for spectrographic observation @xcite .",
    "the sdss - ii sn survey takes advantage of the extensive database of reference images , object catalogs , and photometric calibration compiled by the sdss ( see @xcite for an overview of the sdss ) .",
    "the early data release of the sdss can be found in @xcite .",
    "data release seven , the final data release of sdss - ii , can be found in @xcite .",
    "the supernova sample minimizes photometric errors by using a single filter set and a photometric system @xcite calibrated by the original sdss project @xcite .",
    "the photometric quality is assessed in @xcite , and the astrometric calibrations are described in @xcite .",
    "specifically , the area of the sdss - ii sn survey has been calibrated to 1% photometric error @xcite .",
    "the photometric calibration employed several minor telescopes as well ; this monitor telescope pipeline ( mtpipe ) is described in @xcite .",
    "a software `` robot '' was developed that automatically reduced ccd observations of standard stars in order to assess photometricity and build data on site conditions at the apache point observatory @xcite . using this tool to select the best observing nights , weather and lunar phase",
    "extend the time between observations to an average of about 4.5 days @xcite .",
    "the rapid cadence of the sdss - ii sn survey assures that most of the sdss sne have well - defined , densely sampled light curves even on the rise portion .",
    "the data include pre - explosion flux measurements , so that many of the sdss - ii supernova survey type ia light curves are among the most well - sampled and well - calibrated light curves that have been studied to date .",
    "the sdss - ii sn survey identified 498 spectroscopically confirmed sne ia ( number accurate to the time of our analysis ) .",
    "five of these are extremely peculiar and are not included in this study .",
    "sn 2007qd @xcite and sn 2005hk @xcite are categorized as 2002cx - like objects .",
    "sn 2002cx showed evidence for a very low expansion velocity compared to ` normal ' sne  ia as well as an unusually low peak luminosity , leading to the hypothesis that it was a pure deflagration event @xcite .",
    "sn 2005gj , sn 7017 , and sn 15557 @xcite are 2002ic like .",
    "sn  2002ic showed a type  ia spectrum along with strong hydrogen emission lines @xcite suggesting a shock interacting with circumstellar material .",
    "we limit the events to redshift less than 0.4 and require that there be at least one photometric epoch more than 2 days before maximum and more than 5 days after maximum .",
    "these requirements result in a sample of 391 supernovae .",
    "the photometry is measured using ",
    "scene modeling \" developed by @xcite .",
    "the sloan @xmath14 , @xmath15 , and @xmath16 photometry has been @xmath0-corrected to bessell @xmath1 and @xmath17 bands using snana @xcite .",
    "we use the time of maximum obtained by the fitting procedure in snana as the initial value for our @xmath18 minimizing function .",
    "the redshift of the 391 sne  ia ranges from 0.037 to 0.40 with a median redshift of 0.21 .    [",
    "cols=\"^,^ \" , ]     we also synthesized 2651 curves using a 17-day rise - time template simulated with a single - stretch model .",
    "the stretch values are based on the same analysis from @xcite .",
    "the @xmath12-values range from @xmath19 to @xmath20 with an average of @xmath21 . after error cutting , the @xmath12-values range from @xmath19 to @xmath22 with an average of @xmath23 .",
    "we fit these simulated curves with the 2-stretch fitter , but their underlying distribution is based on single stretch .",
    "the results can be seen in figure [ sim1 ] .",
    "as expected , this single - stretch simulation shows a strong correspondence between rise and fall that is not apparent in the sdss - ii data . upon comparison with figure [ sdss ]",
    ", there is a noticeable difference in the spread of rmf values , with the sdss - ii data having a much greater range .",
    "once again this implies a lack of correlation between rise and fall that is unachievable in this single - stretch model of light curve generation .",
    "however , the single - stretch simulation does produce some normal - declining events that have very slow rise times .",
    "our simulated curves using an mlcs2k2 model and a single - stretch model imply that the range of sn  ia light curves is not fully matched with current light curve fitters .",
    "mlcs2k2 models appear to be slightly better than single - stretch models as they capture some of the slow- declining fast - rising sne  ia that are evident in the real data .",
    "indeed we expect mlcs2k2 to be better simply because it is trained on real sne",
    ". also note that the mlcs2k2 synthesized curves maintain an approximately constant minimum for the rise time of fast - declining sne at around 13 - 14 days , which appears in the sdss - ii sne but could be a result of meager numbers of these sne  ia .",
    "this could be an indication of a physical constraint on the physics of sn  ia explosions , as it seems that increasingly fast decliners do not correspond to increasingly fast risers .",
    "we obtain an average rise time for the sdss - ii sne  ia of @xmath24 days ( standard error of the mean ) ; this is significantly different from the result obtained in @xcite . for the entire nearby sample ,",
    "we obtain an average rise time of @xmath25 days ( standard error ) .",
    "the standard deviation in the rise time is @xmath26 days .",
    "this is in general agreement with the value reported for the sdss - ii data .",
    "the reason that our results differ from the 19.5 days found by @xcite is the difference in shape of the fiducial curves used in the two studies , and the application of the single - stretch fitter in previous methods .",
    "@xcite prove that even slight variations in the declining portion of the template can change the measured rise time by 2 or more days using a single - stretch method .",
    "figure [ fiducial ] shows that the  leibundgut \" template @xcite used by @xcite differs greatly from the mlcs2k2 curves in the pre - maximum phase .",
    "the leibundgut template is 0.66 mag fainter than maximum light at @xmath27 days while the mlcs2k2 fiducial curve reaches 0.66 mag at @xmath28 days .",
    "such a broad template combined with a single - stretch fit tends to force the rise to be very slow and to push the estimated time of maximum later than the true peak brightness ( see figure 7 in @xcite ) .",
    "the narrower mlcs2k2 fiducial combined with the 2-stretch fitter shows that the rise is faster than that found by several previous studies and that there is a wide range of observed rise times for a given fall time .",
    "we created extrapolations to the leibundgut template in the exact same manner as for the mlcs2k2 template , ranging in rise time from 14 to 20 days in half - day intervals . using the template determination method described in section 4.3",
    ", we found the best extrapolated leibundgut template had a rise time of 19.5 days ( note that this utilizes the 2-stretch fitter ) .",
    "however , after our error cutting , we obtain an average rise time of @xmath29 days using this template .",
    "even though the extrapolated leibundgut template has a longer rise time than the mlcs2k2 template , the stretches obtained are smaller so that the average is consistent .",
    "indeed this should be expected with the 2 stretch fitter ; the template with the best relationship between early rise and later rise is selected , but the overall rise time remains constant despite the difference in the fiducial relationship between rise and fall .    to further demonstrate this point , we also performed a rise - time extrapolation using the same method as @xcite , as well as using the leibundgut template .",
    "we fit all 391 sdss - ii sne ia with a single - stretch fit using only data from -10 days to 25 days , and we cut sne with stretch errors greater than 2.0 days .",
    "after stretch correcting the full light curve , we used the data less than -10 days ( which was not used in the fitting process ) to fit a parabolic extrapolation to explosion . using this method",
    ", we obtain an extrapolation of 19.64 days for the sdss - ii sne ia .",
    "this agrees quite well with both the results of @xcite and our own template selection using leibundgut template extrapolations and the 2 stretch fitter .",
    "we have shown in this section that the difference between our rise time and that of previous studies revolves around the flexibility of the 2 stretch fitter regarding the template used .",
    "a single - stretch fitter that is used to determine the best extrapolation to explosion is much too reliant on the relationship between rise and fall in the template .",
    "the 2 stretch fitter is more flexible in the sense that the input template can have any relationship between rise and fall and the average rise time will be consistent with other templates . performing a single - stretch fit and extrapolating to explosion",
    "gives the same result as our template determination method from section 4.3 .",
    "however , in order to find the average rise time , the addition of another parameter to independently estimate the rise stretch is required , because the rise and fall are not strictly correlated .",
    "as with previous studies , we have assumed that the optical flux rises as @xmath30 soon after explosion .",
    "@xcite showed that adiabatic losses should nearly balance heating by radioactive decay and keep the effective temperature relatively constant .",
    "so the luminosity goes as the radius squared and therefore the time squared for a constant expansion rate .",
    "@xcite directly tested this model by fitting light curves with the temporal power - law index as a free parameter .",
    "they found the temporal index @xmath31 that best matched the low- and high - redshift supernovae was 1.8@xmath32 , consistent with the arnett calculation .    to estimate the shape of the early rise",
    ", we fit the 105 sdss - ii light curves with good rise and fall data with the 2-stretch fitter using only epochs later than @xmath27  days .",
    "we then corrected all the light curves to the fiducial curve using the rise and fall stretches which provides 103 @xmath1-band observations between @xmath33 and @xmath27 days before maximum .",
    "we then calculate the @xmath18 parameter over this interval by comparing the data to the function @xmath34 , where the time of explosion ( @xmath35 ) and power - law index ( @xmath31 ) are allowed to float .",
    "the value of the parameter @xmath36 is set by the condition that the function must meet the mlcs2k2 fiducial curve at @xmath27  days .",
    "we found the best - fit power - law index for the sdss - ii data was @xmath37 .",
    "the index is strongly correlated with the time of explosion which we found to be @xmath38 days .",
    "the result is consistent with the arnett prediction and the @xcite estimate for the early light curve shape .",
    "we can also test whether or not the early color of the sdss - ii supernovae follows arnett s prediction of slow and modest temperature changes . for each sdss -",
    "ii observation where there is a good rest - frame @xmath1 and @xmath2 measurement , we construct a color based on the @xmath39 normalized flux difference . this essentially compares the supernova color to the color at @xmath1-band maximum and avoids the problem of dealing with magnitudes at low flux levels .    as a consistency check , for each supernova",
    "we take the flux color averaged between @xmath40 and @xmath27 days to see how it varies with redshift .",
    "we find that the color is essentially constant as a function of redshift which gives us confidence that the snana @xmath0-corrections at early times are self - consistent .",
    "we also see that the colors for @xmath41 are very noisy and we restrict our color analysis to the 332 events at redshifts less than 0.3 .",
    "figure  [ color ] shows the flux color as a function of supernova phase .",
    "the colors have been binned by rest - frame day and the median calculated for each bin .",
    "as expected , the supernovae get significantly red after maximum as the @xmath2-band light curve fades more slowly than the @xmath1 . near the time of explosion , the color is slightly red and shifts to the blue just before maximum .",
    "this observed color change is exactly what is expected given the 2-stretch fit of the individual @xmath1- and @xmath2-band light curves ( and this is shown by the solid line in the figure ) .",
    "using the median @xmath1-band flux , we convert the flux color into magnitudes and find the color index at @xmath40  days is @xmath42 which shifts to @xmath43 at @xmath44  days .",
    "the data earlier than @xmath40  days is too noisy to attempt estimating a reliable magnitude color index .",
    "we convert the color index to an effective temperature using the empirical relation from @xcite and find that @xmath45 rises linearly from 6000 k at @xmath40  days to 9500 k at @xmath44  days and then stays nearly constant until maximum .",
    "flux color relative to b@xmath46 as a function of sn phase .",
    "the data have been binned in 1-day ( rest - frame ) intervals and the median of each bin calculated .",
    "the diamonds represent the sdss - ii sne with redshift less than 0.3 .",
    "the solid line represents the color of the template .",
    "the dotted line is the 1@xmath47 spread of the data . calculating a color index for times later than -15 days , we find that the effective temperature increases linearly from -15 to -9 days then remains nearly constant until maximum .",
    "this is not expected from @xcite , which predicts that the effective temperature should remain constant .",
    "this implies that the power - law index should be nearer to @xmath48 , rather than the @xmath49 calculated from the observations .",
    "[ color ] ]    this linear rise in temperature over the first week after explosion is not expected from @xcite , and is puzzling .",
    "if the color variation represents a temperature change and the optical bands are following the bolometric flux , then we expect a temporal power - law index of at least @xmath50 instead of the observed @xmath51 . in conclusion , we find that the power - law index for the sdss sne ia agrees with the arnett prediction ; however , we find that the early light curves do not follow the prediction of slow and modest temperature changes .",
    "our sdss - ii supernovae show a range of rise times for a fixed fall time , suggesting that the physics of the rise and fall epochs differ . @xcite and @xcite",
    "show that the light curves of sne  ia can be simply described by the deposition of energy from synthesized radioactive elements combined with the diffusion rate of energy out of the expanding nebula . before maximum brightness",
    "the energy input rate from radioactivity exceeds the energy lost to luminosity . at maximum",
    ", the luminosity matches the instantaneous energy deposition rate and the decline from maximum correlates with the total radioactive yield . using more detailed models , @xcite",
    "show that the shape of the light curve depends on more than the radioactive yield .",
    "for example , increasing the production of intermediate mass elements ( e.g. , silicon and calcium ) at a fixed nickel mass ( @xmath7ni ) narrows the light curve while increasing the peak luminosity .",
    "this occurs because the total burned mass correlates with the ke of explosion , and the faster the supernova expands , the earlier the radioactive energy diffuses out .",
    "in contrast , a low ke means a slow rise and faint maximum .",
    "note that the variation in ke trends in the opposite direction to the phillip s relation .",
    "observationally , the radioactive yield and ke influence the rise and fall times in different ways and variation in these two parameters could help explain the range of rise times seen in the sdss - ii supernovae .",
    "other explosion parameters , such as non - radioactive iron yield or degree of mixing , could also impact the rise versus fall times @xcite .",
    "for illustration , we consider only ke variation here .",
    "@xcite have calculated model light curves for sne  ia with fixed ke and varying radioactive nickel masses to show that they can match the phillip s relation fairly well .",
    "we can apply the 2-stretch method to these model curves almost as easily as to real data . from this",
    "we can see if the rise and fall times of the models can refine the physics of the observed light curve shapes .",
    "unfortunately , the mlcs2k2 fiducial does not match the model light curves sufficiently well to estimate accurate rise and fall times .",
    "instead , we chose the @xmath52  m@xmath53 model curve as a fiducial and applied the 2-stretch fitter to the remaining models .",
    "the resulting rise times for fixed ke models with varying nickel yield are shown as a dashed line in figure  [ kasen ] and compared with observed low - redshift rise / fall times .",
    "the model rise time varies only modestly with 15 ( slope of @xmath54 days/15 ) compared to the fall time ( slope of @xmath55 days/15 at 15=1.1 ) .",
    "this is in stark contrast to the single - stretch parameterization where the rise time parallels the fall time in this diagram .",
    "ni yield would change the position of a specific sn  ia from the kasen models .",
    "[ kasen ] ]    we compare the predicted effect on rise / fall times from varying @xmath7ni yield with the sdss - ii data in figure  [ rise - fall ] . the observed trend of @xmath10 increasing with larger 15 is well matched by the model , although there are still many supernovae in the sample that lie far from the model .",
    "clearly , the single - stretch parameterization of light curve shape is not justified by the observed rise / fall - time variations or predictions of the @xmath7ni model .",
    "the small scatter in the rise portion of the sn  ia light curves seen in the full sdss - ii sample ( figure  [ alldata ] ) should not be a surprise if it is a direct consequence of @xmath7ni yield being the dominant source of diversity in sne  ia @xcite .",
    "this is a popular interpretation for variations in peak brightness in sne  ia .",
    "@xcite models that vary ke at fixed nickel yield were also fit with the 2-stretch method .",
    "arrows in figure  [ kasen ] illustrate the amplitude and direction in the rise / fall time versus 15 plane of a supernova that increases its nickel yield by 25% at fixed ke and then increases its ke by 25% at fixed radioactive yield .",
    "the change in ke produces a steeper variation in rise time than does nickel and in the opposite sense , i.e. , increasing ke results in a faster light curve decay as well as a shorter rise time . unlike nickel variations , changes in ke",
    "affect the rise time ( slope of @xmath56 days/15 ) as strongly as the fall time , meaning pure variations in ke result in almost no change in @xmath10 ( and would be well fit by a single - stretch parameterization ) .    while this analysis focuses on the effects of ke and @xmath7ni yield ,",
    "there are other parameters that may be important to the light curve shape as well .",
    "in particular , mixing the @xmath7ni to a larger radius may result in faster rise times @xcite .",
    "this effect plays a secondary role @xcite in light curve shape , however , and is not included in this analysis .",
    "the @xcite models used in this analysis contain no effects from variations in @xmath7ni distribution .",
    "we have only employed model light curves with fixed iron mass yields , which is the parameter that controls the @xmath7ni distribution in the one - dimensional @xcite models .    in principle , varying both @xmath7ni yield and ke will allow a supernova to reach any point on the @xmath10 versus 15 diagram ( figure  [ rise - fall ] ) .",
    "changes in radioactive yield will move supernovae diagonally , while ke variations shift supernovae horizontally .",
    "given these motions , it is difficult to explain the handful of events with very slow rise times and normal decline rates ( @xmath57 and 15@xmath58 ) .",
    "sn  1990n may be a member of this group in the low - redshift set .",
    "the kasen models also predict that peak luminosity should be related to nickel yield and ke variations , with an increase in @xmath7ni and ke resulting in brighter events .",
    "@xcite found , however , that the effect of these parameters on light curve width works in the opposite sense .",
    "an increase in ke narrows the light curve while increasing peak luminosity and a larger nickel mass widens the light curve while making a brighter peak . examining the absolute magnitude estimates of the sdss - ii events may help sort out the origin of the rise / fall variations .",
    "@xcite and @xcite have shown that rates of sne ia are strongly connected with host galaxy star formation rate .",
    "they model the rates as coming from two sources , one from a passive population of stars and the other a prompt population of supernovae correlated with high star formation rates .",
    "it is natural to speculate that the range of rmf corresponds to the sources of supernovae in the two stellar populations . to test this idea",
    ", we construct the @xmath59 color of the host galaxies of our sample of 105 sdss - ii supernovae .",
    "the @xmath59 color index correlates well with specific star formation rate measured from the sdss spectroscopic sample .",
    "the host magnitudes are taken from the sdss - dr5 catalog and are color corrected to the rest frame by interpolating from tables in @xcite .",
    "the host galaxy color versus supernova @xmath10 is shown in figure  [ galaxy ] for supernovae with 15@xmath60 mag . very fast declining supernovae",
    "are known to be associated with early - type galaxies ( e.g. , @xcite ) and might confuse the result .",
    "days are plotted as diamonds while hosts with high rmf sne are circles .",
    "the size of the plotting symbol correlates with the total brightness of the galaxy .",
    "the rmf cut at 2 days was selected arbitrarily .",
    "the host color distributions do not appear different between these two groups .",
    "[ galaxy ] ]    there is no significant correlation between host @xmath59 color and the rise - time properties of the supernovae .",
    "supernovae with rmf @xmath61 days tend to have slower decline rates than the other supernovae and can be expected to result from the prompt , high star - formation rate population .",
    "we do not observe this relation in our sample .",
    "the phillip s relation shows that the sn  ia light curve decline rate is related to the optical peak luminosity .",
    "the sdss - ii light curves suggest that there are a range of basic light curve shapes and this leads to several questions :    * which parameter is the best indicator of peak luminosity : fall time , rise time , total width , or rise minus fall time ? * is there a difference in the average peak luminosity between fast and slow risers for a fixed decline rate ?",
    "* do the color or dust properties vary with rise time ?    to investigate these questions , we estimated the apparent peak @xmath2-band magnitude , and peak color by fitting the 105 light curves with good rise / fall - time measurements with mlcs2k2 .",
    "we relaxed all priors to the fits ( flatnegav ) and assumed a fixed extinction law of @xmath62 . despite the good rise - time information in the light curve data ,",

    "arnett s rule @xcite states that the bolometric luminosity of a sn  ia at maximum light is very close to the instantaneous energy being deposited by the synthesized radioactive elements .",
    "this equality has been used by several studies ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) to estimate the mass of @xmath7ni created in the supernova . however , the time between explosion and maximum light is a key parameter in this calculation and it has often been assumed to be a constant 19.5  days . in this paper , we have found that the average rise time is shorter than that estimated in previous studies and it is not strictly linked to the decline speed . this will change the distribution of @xmath111ni yields when compared with earlier assumptions about rise - time properties .",
    "we estimate @xmath7ni yields using the prescription of @xcite but with a simplified technique for measuring the bolometric luminosity .",
    "we used the time from explosion to peak flux as our measured rise - time values .",
    "we have already calculated the extinction - corrected absolute @xmath2-band magnitudes for the well - observed objects in the sdss - ii sample and we use these to scale an average type  ia spectrum which we integrate over a wide wavelength range to get quasi - bolometric @xmath112 luminosity . for a supernova with absolute magnitude @xmath83=0.00 ( vega system ) and the @xcite spectral template at @xmath1-band maximum , we find a bolometric flux of 2.04@xmath113 erg  @xmath114  s@xmath78 between 300 and 1000  nm .",
    "this approximation is best for normal type  ia and is not as accurate for sub - luminous events which tend to be more red than normal at maximum .",

    "knowledge of the rise time is critical in understanding the physics of type ia events .",
    "[ nimass ] ]    the estimated @xmath7ni yields for the sdss - ii events range from 0.2 to 0.8 @xmath121 , which are typical for this method @xcite .",
    "figure  [ nimass ] shows the @xmath7ni yield as a function of the total light curve width ( @xmath106 ) and there is a strong correlation between these two quantities .",
    "most of the supernovae producing the largest amount of @xmath7ni are events with @xmath117  days ( slowest rising 20% ) .",
    "in contrast , the slowest declining supernovae ( @xmath118  days ) produce average yields of @xmath7ni .",
    "this demonstrates the importance of independently measuring the rise time of sn  ia to understand the physics of the thermonuclear explosion mechanisms .",
    "the sdss - ii supernova sample provides tight constraints on the rise time and shape of sn  ia light curves .",
    "the @xmath0-corrected , median light curves of 391 events shows a @xmath1-band rise time of 16.8 days and a significantly smaller dispersion on the rise portion of the curve than on the fading side .",
    "this implies that the rise time is less impacted by variations in radioactive nickel yield than the fall , as predicted by the @xcite model light curves .",
    "it is clear that the single - stretch parameter commonly used to characterize sn  ia light curves is not capable of capturing the full range of light curve shapes , especially when pre - maximum observations are available .",
    "we selected 105 sne  ia from the larger sample that had sufficient photometric precision and cadence to yield rise- and fall - time errors of less than 2.0 days . from this set",
    ", we find the rise time in the @xmath1 band is @xmath122 days ( standard error of the mean ) .",
    "this is significantly different from the rise time of 19.5  days measured from local supernovae @xcite and high - redshift events @xcite .",
    "we find the cause of this discrepancy to be the difference in the fiducial curves used in the analyses and our application of a 2-stretch fitting method that permits the rise and fall to be fit independently .",
    "we find rise times ranging from 13  days to 23  days for events with  normal \" decline times of around 15  days , demonstrating that the rise and fall are not strictly correlated .",
    "we applied our 2-stretch light curve fitting method to data from sdss - ii to test the conjecture by @xcite of a bimodal distribution in sn  ia light curve shape . from our 105 high - quality light curves , we are not able to reproduce this bimodal distribution in the difference between rise and fall times .",
    "we do find a significant spread in rmf times for the sample , which implies again that the rise and fall are not strictly correlated .",
    "this large range in rmf is expected from explosion models that simply vary the radioactive nickel yield .",
    "contrary to the premise of the single - stretch method , many of the slowest declining sne are among the fastest risers .",
    "this effect is better modeled through mlcs2k2 , as shown by our simulations , and this may be a result of mlcs2k2 being trained on a large number of real nearby sne ia . while mlcs2k2 is better than single stretch at representing the observed light curves , the simulations with mlcs2k2",
    "do not capture the full spread in rise times evident for normal - declining sne ia .",
    "specifically our simulations using mlcs2k2 do not contain normal - declining events that are slow rising .",
    "we investigated the relation between peak luminosity , light curve shape , and color by minimizing the scatter on the hubble diagram for the 96 sne  ia with good rise / fall data and 15@xmath60 .",
    "the hubble residuals have the smallest scatter when using both rise and fall time as fit parameters .",
    "the correlation of rise and fall time with luminosity have the same sign , meaning that the full width of the light curve is the best indicator of luminosity .",
    "twelve models suggested that a second parameter , such as ke , competing with radioactive nickel yield , could be revealed in the rise and fall times and their correlation with luminosity .",
    "however , rise and fall times are found to act in concert in the sdss - ii sne , implying that ke ( or other physical parameters that broaden the light curve and lower peak luminosity ) is not a major contributor to light curve shape .",
    "@xcite recently suggested that sne  ia with high si ii velocity gradients ( hvg ) may have fast- rising light curves .",
    "we are analyzing the spectra of the sdss sample to see if there is a rise - time , spectral velocity gradient correlation .",
    "it is interesting to note that sn  1990n , a low - redshift supernova with a very slow rise , has a low si ii velocity gradient , but a more complete sample needs to be constructed .",
    "the application of the 2-stretch fitting method we have developed provides a better fit to sn  ia light curves than simply stretching the entire time axis . by independently fitting",
    "the rise and fall portions of each light curve , we found that the rise and fall times are not strictly correlated .",
    "when correcting sn  ia luminosity for light curve shape , adding the rise - time parameter to the fall time reduces the scatter in the hubble diagram when compared to using the fall time alone .",
    "however , we find that the full width of the light curve ( rise plus fall time ) minimizes the scatter about the hubble line as well as using both rise and fall times as independent parameters .",
    "this does suggest some danger doing cosmology by combining a low - redshift supernova set dominated by poor pre - maximum sampling with a well - sampled high - redshift set .",
    "our results show that measurement of rise time as a separate parameter characterizing sn  ia light curve shape may be a useful diagnostic in understanding the progenitors and explosion mechanisms of thermonuclear events . based on @xmath7ni yield calculations in @xcite and @xcite , our average rise time would result in a 15%-20% reduction in @xmath7ni yield as compared to models that use a 19.5-day rise time . however , there are also some sne ia that have rise times longer than 19.5 days , resulting in a higher @xmath7ni yield .",

    "<S> we analyze the rise and fall times of type  ia supernova ( sn  ia ) light curves discovered by the sloan digital sky survey - ii ( sdss - ii ) supernova survey . from a set of 391 light curves @xmath0-corrected to the rest - frame @xmath1 and @xmath2 bands , we find a smaller dispersion in the rising portion of the light curve compared to the decline . </S>",
    "<S> this is in qualitative agreement with computer models which predict that variations in radioactive nickel yield have less impact on the rise than on the spread of the decline rates . </S>",
    "<S> the differences we find in the rise and fall properties suggest that a single ` stretch ' correction to the light curve phase does not properly model the range of sn  ia light curve shapes . </S>",
    "<S> we select a subset of 105 light curves well observed in both rise and fall portions of the light curves and develop a ` 2-stretch ' fit algorithm which estimates the rise and fall times independently . </S>",
    "<S> we find the average time from explosion to @xmath1-band peak brightness is @xmath3 days , but with a spread of rise times which range from 13 days to 23 days . </S>",
    "<S> our average rise time is shorter than the @xmath4 days found in previous studies ; this reflects both the different light curve template used and the application of the 2-stretch algorithm . </S>",
    "<S> the sdss - ii supernova set and the local sne  ia with well - observed early light curves show no significant differences in their average rise - time properties . </S>",
    "<S> we find that slow - declining events tend to have fast rise times , but that the distribution of rise minus fall time is broad and single peaked . </S>",
    "<S> this distribution is in contrast to the bimodality in this parameter that was first suggested by @xcite from an analysis of a small set of local sne  ia . </S>",
    "<S> we divide the sdss - ii sample in half based on the rise minus fall value , @xmath5 days and @xmath6 days , to search for differences in their host galaxy properties and hubble residuals ; we find no difference in host galaxy properties or hubble residuals in our sample . </S>"
