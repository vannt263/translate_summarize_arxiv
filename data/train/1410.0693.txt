    "the study of globular clusters ( gcs ) offers a rich platform for the validation of stellar evolution theories and the formulation of dynamical evolution scenarios of stellar systems .  in particular , recent discoveries ( e.g. * ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) have prompted blue straggler stars ( bsss ) as key elements of the puzzle , given their tight relation with these two fields .",
    "bsss are empirically defined as stars that appear bluer and brighter than turn - off stars in the color - magnitude diagram ( cmd ) of a gc .",
    "although their definite physical nature is still a matter of debate , the most popular formation channels for bsss are the ones explaining them as products of mass - transfer / mergers in binary stellar systems @xcite and as the results of direct stellar collisions @xcite .",
    "both are strongly dependent on the local environment s dynamical state , and , therefore , bsss can be used as tracers of past dynamical events as well as of the current dynamical state , given their strong response to two - body relaxation effects due to their relatively high stellar masses .",
    "@xcite proposed that the current bss radial density profile can be used as a  dynamical clock \" to estimate the dynamical age of a gc , and continued to classify a large set of gcs in three different classes according to their dynamical state .",
    "the dynamically oldest category contains , among others , gcs m30 and ngc362 , which have been studied in this context more in detail by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter f09 ) and ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter d13 ) .",
    "these studies have found that the bss population is indeed consistent with dynamically old gcs .",
    "furthermore , their cmds reveal well defined double bss sequences , which the authors claim are the result of single short - lived dynamical events , such as core - collapse .",
    "it is believed that during such core contraction the stellar collision rate would become enhanced , producing the bluer bss sequence in the cmd , while the boosted binary interaction rate would lead to enhanced roche - lobe overflows , thereby producing the redder bss sequence .",
    "it is , therefore , clear that observational properties of bsss can provide valuable information for the understating of the dynamical evolution of gcs .  here ,",
    "we present a study based principally on high - quality hst photometry of the inner bss population in the poorly studied galactic gc ngc1261 , which contains evidence for a very particular dynamical history , making it a similar , yet unique case among other gcs with well defined bss features , such as m30 and ngc362 .",
    "the inner region photometric catalog comes from the hst / acs galactic globular cluster survey @xcite .",
    "it consists of @xmath030 min .",
    "exposures in the f606w ( @xmath1 ) and f814w ( @xmath2 ) bands for the central @xmath3 field of ngc1261 .",
    "the photometry was corrected to account for updated hst / acs wfc zero points and calibrated in the vega photometric system .",
    "the catalog provides high quality photometry down to @xmath4 mag below the main - sequence turn - off .",
    "additionally , we performed psf photometry using the dophot software package @xcite on hst / wfc3 data taken with the f336w ( @xmath5 ) band , available from the hubble legacy archive ( pi : piotto , proposal i d : 13297 ) .",
    "the photometry was calibrated using stetson standards @xcite from the ngc1261 field .",
    "the astrometry was refined with the hst / acs optical catalog using bright isolated stars , after which we reach a median accuracy of @xmath6 between the optical and f336w - band catalogs .",
    "we also use wide - field photometry from the catalog published by @xcite , built from observations at the 1.3-m warsaw telescope at las campanas observatory , using a set of @xmath7 filters and a @xmath8 field of view .",
    "the photometry is calibrated to @xcite and the median error is @xmath90.04 mag for all filters and colors down to @xmath10 mag .",
    "the complete description of their data reduction and photometric calibration can be found in @xcite .",
    "bsss are selected through their position in a cmd . having three filters",
    ", we can use the additional color information to remove contaminants .",
    "first , we cross - match the optical acs catalog with the f336w - band catalog and keep matched sources with separations @xmath11 0.02  ( @xmath12 pix ) and reported errors @xmath11 0.03 mag in the f606w and f814w filter .",
    "this results in @xmath13 sources in a @xmath14 field centered on ngc1261 ( see figure  [ cmd1 ] ) .",
    "we use a f814w@xmath1119.5 mag limit for the bss selection criteria from @xcite , who define the bss region based on magnitude and color cuts in the ( f606w - f814w)vs.f814w cmd , shown by the polygon in figure  [ cmd1 ] .",
    "all stars inside the region are considered to be bss candidates , and used in the following analysis ( unless removed from the sample ; see further down in the text ) .",
    "we identify two prominent bss sequences in the cmd , each containing @xmath15 bsss ( see inset panel ) .",
    "we label them the blue - sequence - bsss ( b - bsss ; shown as blue squares ) and the red - sequence - bsss ( r - bsss , red triangles ) .",
    "similar to m30 and ngc362 , the b - bss sequence is narrower and better defined , while the r - bss sequence is dispersed towards redder colours .",
    "we note the appearance of a group of bsss lying bluer from the b - bss sequence in the cmd .",
    "since they can not be directly associated with the b - bss sequence , as they are clearly separated in the diagram , we choose to label them as extremely - blue - bsss ( eb - bsss , black circles ) and we later discuss their likelihood of being associated to a particular bss population .",
    "this bluer component has neither been observed in m30 nor in ngc362 , and , if confirmed real , requires a given bss formation scenario , particular to the history of ngc1261 , that is not present in the other two gcs .",
    "we now introduce the f336w - band photometry for contaminant detection .",
    "we show in figure  [ ucmd ] the ( f336w - f814w)vs.f336w cmd and use the same symbols for the bsss as in figure  [ cmd1 ] .",
    "three bss candidates plus another star from the eb - bss group can not be distinguished from @xmath16 ms / sgb stars based on their location in the ( f336w - f814w)vs.f336w cmd ( shown as diagonal crosses and a filled circle , respectively ) , and hence we exclude them from the full bss sample and subsequent analysis .",
    "it is worth noting that two r - bsss and another two eb - bsss in figure  [ ucmd ] ( additionally marked with a pentagon ) also show significantly redder ( f336w - f814w ) colors than the rest of their groups .",
    "this result may point into photometric variability ( since the f336w and f814w - band images on hst were taken @xmath17 years apart , while the f606w and f814w - band exposures are less than an hour apart ) .",
    "indeed wuma eclipsing binary systems are frequent among bsss and have been detected in the double bss sequences of ngc 362 ( d13 ) and m30 ( f09 ) .",
    "in particular , the wuma bsss detected in ngc362 were found to show a typical variability of 0.3 mag in all f390w , f555w and f814w bands ( see figure  10 in d13 ) which could account for the deviations found in ( f336w - f814w ) colors for these bsss in ngc1261 .",
    "another explanation could be the blend of cooler stars , which would explain the apparent missing flux in the f336w band .",
    "however , the fact that the source centroids were requested to match within 0.02  ( @xmath00.2 fwhm in the optical ) in the optical and near - ultraviolet , along with the conservative 0.03 mag error limit in the optical bands , points rather towards a well - fitted single psf detection .",
    "we compare now the identified sub - samples with isochrones from stellar collisional models of @xcite .",
    "the models have a metallicity of @xmath18 ( [ fe / h ]  @xmath19 ) and solar - scaled chemical composition ( [ @xmath20/fe ]  @xmath21 ) .",
    "pairs of stars with masses between 0.4 and 0.8@xmath22 are collided using the mmas software package @xcite .",
    "the parent stars are assumed to be non - rotating , and 10 gyr old at the time of the collision .",
    "the collision products are evolved using the monash stellar evolution code , as described in @xcite .",
    "the time of the collision was taken to be @xmath23 , and isochrones of various ages were calculated by interpolating along the tracks to determine the stellar properties ( effective temperature , luminosity , etc . ) at ages between 0.2 and 5 gyr .",
    "for the isochrones , we used collision products of the following stellar mass combinations : @xmath24 , and @xmath25 .",
    "we have adopted the distance modulus and reddening values of ngc1261 from @xcite and augmented the distance modulus by 0.25 mag in order to match the low - mass end of the collisional isochrone to the location of the main - sequence fiducial line in the cmd@xmath261.35 ...",
    "@xmath271.38 according to the latest studies @xcite , and a large @xmath20-enhancement as it is expected for gcs in the halo @xcite . ] .",
    "we find that the location of the b - bsss and eb - bsss can be reproduced by 2 gyr and 200 myr old isochrones of the stellar collisional models , respectively , as seen in figure  [ cmd_iso ] .",
    "we note that the agreement of the model with the b - bsss is remarkably good .  the eb - bss sub - sample ,",
    "although much less populated , is also somewhat consistent with the collisional 0.2gyr isochrone model .",
    "this enlarges the likelihood of this bss feature being a real distinct population .",
    "the r - bsss need further explanation .",
    "f09 and d13 found for m30 and ngc362 that the lower bound of the r - bsss could be fairly well bracketed by the zero - age main - sequence ( zams ) shifted by 0.75 mag towards brighter luminosities in the @xmath28 ( f555w in their case ) band , which approximately indicates the region populated by mass - transfer binaries , as predicted by @xcite .",
    "in our case we use the 0.25 gyr old dartmouth isochrones @xcite , and find that the r - bss sequence can only be reproduced by a region bracketed by the 0.25 gyr old isochrone shifted by 0.45 mag and 0.75 mag to brighter f606w - band luminosities ( grey region in the figure ) .",
    "this shift is less than that required for m30 and ngc362 , and we note that a small difference is expected due to slightly different hst filters ( f606w vs. f555w ) as a @xmath28 band proxy .",
    "however , the prediction by @xcite is based only on case a ( main - sequence donor ) mass - transfer models .",
    "@xcite showed that case b ( red - giant donor ) mass - transfer products lie indeed in a bluer region than the zams+0.75 mag boundary .",
    "our current understanding of binary mass transfer is limited and , hence , our observations could help putting constraints on future binary stellar evolution models .",
    "f09 and d13 have demonstrated that m30 and ngc362 show signs of being in an advanced state of dynamical evolution , as revealed by their centrally segregated bss radial profiles ( which puts them in the family  iii group in * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and by their centrally peaked radial stellar density profiles .  likewise",
    ", we plot in figure  [ bss_norm_prof ] the normalized , cumulative bss radial density profile for all bss candidates and for the r - bss and b - bss sequences in ngc1261 out to 3.8 core radii , i.e.  the extent of the hst observations .",
    "as expected , the whole bss sample , as well as each bss sequence , are more centrally concentrated than the reference sgb populationf606w@xmath1119.5 mag range . ] .",
    "however , contrary to what was found in m30 and ngc362 , we find the b - bss component more centrally concentrated than the r - bss component .",
    "a k - s test shows that the null - hypothesis of these stars being drawn from the same radial distribution has a p - value of 0.33 , which implies a non - negligible likelihood for common parent distributions .",
    "nevertheless , the difference between these profiles and the ones for m30 and ngc362 is still significant and motivates a discussion on possible qualitative differences of bss formation history in ngc1261 versus the other gcs .  we do not find any b - bsss inside @xmath29 ( or about 10 ) , in agreement with f09 and d13 , who as well report no b - bsss within the inner 5 - 6(@xmath30 and @xmath29 respectively ) .",
    "these authors suggest that dynamical kicks are responsible for clearing the innermost region of any b - bsss .",
    "the detailed process is , however , unknown as accurate dynamical models are numerically expensive and , thus , still lacking .        the results from figure  [ bss_norm_prof ] alone can not be used to suggest an advanced dynamical state in ngc1261 , as the central concentration of bsss is now known to be ubiquitous among all studied gcs .",
    "a more complete understanding can be obtained by looking at the bss radial profile at larger cluster - centric distances , as the radial distance of the normalized bss density minimum will depend on the cluster s dynamical age .",
    "@xcite showed that as a gc evolves dynamically the bss radial density profile takes the form of a central high maximum and a secondary peak at larger radii with a minimum in between . in order to follow this approach",
    "we include the wide - field photometry catalog in our analysis and carefully merge it . ] with the inner - region acs catalog , providing us with a sampling of ngc1261 out to @xmath31 .",
    "we plot in figure  [ bss_rad_frac ] the relative fraction of bsss to sgbs mag range cut .",
    "we use the  @xmath28 @xmath32 \" magnitude on the acs catalog in order to make them compatible with the wide - field gound - based photometry . ] as a function of cluster - centric radius , assuming poissonian noise for the error bars .",
    "the bsss in the wide - field catalog are the ones selected by @xcite , i.e. stars on the bss region of all ( @xmath33-@xmath28 ) , ( @xmath28-@xmath34 ) and ( @xmath33-@xmath34 ) cmds .",
    "we then apply an additional magnitude cut ( @xmath35 mag ) in order to hold the same faint magnitude limit used with the inner sample ( see fig  [ cmd1])19.5 mag limit from fig .",
    "1 is checked using the ",
    "@xmath34 @xmath32 \" magnitude on the acs catalog and is found to translate to @xmath36 mag . ] .",
    "considering these selection steps , combining both samples is hence acceptable for our purposes .",
    "we find that the bss fraction is maximal in the center and drops rapidly with radius reaching near to zero at @xmath37 .",
    "a subsequent rising in the fraction profile is discernible , although this is only caused by the detection of two bsss alone ( see the inset panel ) and therefore not strongly supported statistically .",
    "the absence of a clear outer layer suggests that the majority of the bss population has already been affected by dynamical friction .",
    "hence , in the framework constructed by @xcite , ngc1261 would classify as a dynamically old cluster and would be grouped in late - familyii / familyiii , not surprisingly similar to m30 and ngc362 .  moreover , the half - mass relaxation time is about @xmath38 years , which is actually shorter than that of ngc362 , @xmath39 and m30 , @xmath40 , as found in @xcite .",
    "however , the core structure of ngc 1261 does not show signatures of core collapse .",
    "it is well approximated by a king model with a concentration parameter @xmath41 @xcite .",
    "it has a central luminosity density of 2.22 @xmath42pc@xmath43 @xcite , which is relatively low for gcs .",
    "moreover , the binary fraction radial profile found by @xcite shows a flat distribution , i.e.  without signs of mass segregation , contrary to the ones in m30 and ngc362 , which are centrally peaked .",
    "therefore it is not surprising that the binary merger products , i.e.  the r - bss population , in these gcs are also more centrally segregated than the r - bss population in ngc1261",
    ".  this apparent evolutionary contradiction may not be as problematic as it first seems .  according to both monte - carlo dynamical models ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and direct - integration n - body models ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , clusters can go through core - collapse and then , if there is some energy source in the core , stay or pass through a long - lived post - core - collapse bounce state in which they do not show classic post core - collapse signatures .",
    "the @xcite models of m4 all went through core collapse at @xmath44gyr , and then remained in a non - collapsed state for another @xmath45 gyr due to  binary burning \" in the core . @xcite",
    "propose a binary black hole as an alternative central potential energy source .",
    "we know today that black holes may be common in gcs ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , so that a binary black hole in the core of ngc1261 may be considered a valid possibility . +",
    "we find that the inner bss population in ngc1261 includes at least two distinct well defined sequences similar to what was found in m30 and ngc362 , and as well includes a smaller group of bsss that have unusually blue colours in the cmd , and which could be associated with a distinct coeval bss population , if confirmed real .",
    "the comparison with collisional stellar evolution models reveals that the b - bss and eb - bss sub - samples are consistent with a 2 gyr and 0.2 gyr old stellar collision - product population , respectively .",
    "this provides the grounds for considering ngc1261 an extremely valuable test laboratory for stellar collision and bss formation models .",
    "this observation along with evidence collected from the literature suggest as a preliminary interpretation for the dynamical history of ngc1261 that the cluster experienced a core - collapse phase about 2 gyr ago , and that since then it has bounced through core oscillations .",
    "the subsequent core oscillations occasionally created more bsss during these short timescale processes when the central stellar density was particularly enhanced ",
    "one such likely 0.2 gyr ago . during these periods of core density enhancements",
    "the cluster likely burned some of its core binaries , thereby flattening their radial density distribution profile , and currently the cluster is likely in a post core - collapsed state which , according to different simulations , may appear as an unevolved gc .",
    "follow - up spectroscopic characterization of the bss sequences in ngc1261 is of utmost importance in order to confirm and better understand their origins and formation mechanisms , and in particular test the chemical abundance predictions related to different bss formation models .",
