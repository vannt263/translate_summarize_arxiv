    "within the framework of the density wave theory ( lin and shu @xcite ) , the spiral arms of disk galaxies are the manifestation of sets of travelling waves . in the presence of both leading and trailing sets of waves , the modal theory of galactic spiral structure ( bertin et al .",
    "@xcite , @xcite ) predicts that the amplitude of a grand design two - arm spiral pattern will oscillate with radial distance from the center because of the interference of wave packets or modes which are propagating inward and outward , being reflected off a central bulge ( lin @xcite ; lau et al .",
    "@xcite ; mark @xcite ; lin @xcite ) .",
    "the swing amplification mechanism ( toomre @xcite ) may be responsible for the appearance of the modes themselves .",
    "the existence of trailing and leading waves is inferred by looking at the unmistakable interference patterns on the density contours along spiral arms ( see , e.g. , toomre s figures 10 and 12 ) .",
    "the presence of interference patterns is betrayed in the discontinuity of the contours , or in other words , in the modulation of the density ( or surface brightness ) along each arm .",
    "the brightness along a spiral arm will be increased where two wave crests meet and constructively interfere , but will be decreased where a wave crest and a wave trough destructively interfere .    in the swing amplification models of toomre ( @xcite ) ,",
    "the absence of a bulge or of a central concentration makes the modelling unrealistic .",
    "the modes which grow in toomre s models are fast evolving .",
    "in contrast , the modal theory of galactic spiral structure assumes the presence of a central bulge .",
    "these bulges act as reflectors ( often termed the ` q - barrier ' ) , resulting in a quasi - stationary modal pattern ( thomasson et al .",
    "@xcite ; elmegreen and thomasson @xcite ; fuchs @xcite ) . clearly , such models are much more appropriate to the dynamics of spiral galaxies .",
    "several mechanisms have been proposed for the maintenance of spiral structure in galaxies .",
    "the usual process of wave propagation , with feedback and over - reflection , can maintain the wave pattern .",
    "mechanisms such as turbulent dissipation and shock formation in the gaseous population i component can also play a role in the self - regulation of spiral modes ( bertin et al .",
    "@xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "symmetric spiral arm amplitude modulations indicative of underlying wave modes have hitherto only been detected in the grand design galaxies , , ( elmegreen et al .",

    "the presence of dust and the morphology of a galaxy are inextricably intertwined : indeed , the morphology of a galaxy can completely change once the population i disks of galaxies are dust penetrated ( e.g. , block and wainscoat @xcite ; block et al .",

    "the fourier spectra offer an unambiguous way of identifying both leading and trailing wave packets in galaxies which are not restricted to be relatively close ; the method can be applied to any spiral whose stellar spiral arms are resolved .",

    ".parameters of the galaxies [ cols=\"<,^,^ \" , ]     it is evident from table [ tabspec ] that the pitch angle for the trailing and the leading components for each galaxy is very similar .",
    "a classification scheme of spiral galaxies in the near - infrared was recently proposed by block and puerari ( @xcite ) .",
    "galaxies are binned into three groups @xmath4 , @xmath5 and @xmath6 based on the pitch angle of the arms , robustly determined from fourier spectra .",
    "even - sided ( as opposed to lopsided ) galaxies have a dominant @xmath0=2 component in the fourier spectra , and they are designated in this scheme by an ` e ' . and both belong to the dust penetrated e@xmath5 class ( table [ tabparm ] ) .",
    "the ratio between the amplitudes of the leading and the trailing patterns is also the same for the two galaxies .",
    "this is particularly interesting , since there is a large difference in the linear size of the two galaxies ( adopting h@xmath7=50 km / sec / mpc , the linear diameters of and are 18 and 42 kpc , respectively ) .",
    "note furthermore that the ratio of amplitudes does not depend on the absolute magnitude of the parent spiral , neither on the arm class ( see table [ tabparm ] ) .    in the determination of fourier coefficients and of pitch angle , careful deprojections to face - on are of course necessary .",
    "mean uncertainties of position angle and inclination angle as a function of inclination are drawn in fig . 2 of considre and athanassoula ( @xcite ) . for ,",
    "we find ( using eight deprojected runs , wherein inclination and position angle are systematically varied ) that incorrect deprojections can introduce a maximum difference of 13% in the reported @xmath8/@xmath9 ratio ( see table [ tabspec ] ) .",
    "for the pitch angle , the maximum difference we find is only 5@xmath10 .",
    "the situation is slightly more complex for , because of its smaller inclination ( and hence , larger uncertainties in the deprojection angles ) and its asymmetry .",
    "for a few incorrect deprojections ( mainly when we deproject the image with both an incorrect pa and an incorrect @xmath11 ) , the leading component does not appear clearly .",
    "in other cases , the errors in the @xmath8/@xmath9 ratio and in the pitch angles are of the order of the errors listed for .",
    "the results are fully consistent with the findings of block et al .",

    "[ section ] ]    optical images of the galaxy ( sandage and bedke @xcite , plate 265 ) reveal numerous patches of star formation with no grand design spiral structure from a density wave in the underlying stellar disk .",
    "such patchy structure occurs in over sixty percent of isolated , non - barred galaxies , giving them a flocculent , fleece - like appearance ( elmegreen and elmegreen @xcite ) .",
    "a characteristic of flocculent galaxies such as is that the optical patches , by definition , span only a small range in azimuth",
    ".    belongs to arm class 3 , described as ` fragmented arms uniformly distributed around the galactic center ' ( see elmegreen and elmegreen @xcite ) .",
    "what is so striking in the dust penetrated , near - infrared regime is that presents a remarkable , bisymmetrical grand design morphology ( see figure [ imag4062 ] ) : two arms spanning over 90 degrees in azimuth . it is evident that the young population i and old stellar population ii disks of actually decouple .",
    "another surprise is that the fourier spectra of do not present a single peak for the @xmath0=2 mode ( figure [ spec4062 ] ) .",
    "the presence of two peaks betrays the existence of two different spirals .",
    "one would have the form of an ` z ' ( coming from the peak with maximum at @xmath12 ) and the other having a ` s ' form .",
    "this situation is exactly what is expected within the framework of the swing amplification theory or in the modal theory of galactic spiral structure : a strong trailing pattern and a weaker leading one .",
    "[ [ section-1 ] ]    grand design spirals ( where two dominant arms may span many degrees in azimuth ) are completely different from flocculent galaxies . possibly two of the best studied grand design spirals are ( ) and ( ) , where two long symmetric arms dominate their optical disks .",

    "is a magnificent , grand design optical specimen .",
    "its arm class is 12 ( the same class to which and belong ) . in grand design galaxies , density waves are believed to have organized young stellar associations to form the symmetric optical spiral pattern ( elmegreen @xcite ) and one often finds a strong coupling between the young population i and the older stellar population ii disks .",
    "this is the case for .",
    "this galaxy , however , is not quite as symmetric as is in the near - infrared k@xmath2 image ( see figure [ imag5248 ] ) .",
    "the two trailing arms have a small difference in their winding angle , with one arm being slightly more open than the other one . in the fourier spectra",
    ", @xmath0=1 components reveal this asymmetry , and this is attested to by the relatively large @xmath0=1 component of ( figure [ spec5248 ] ) .",
    "nevertheless , the fourier spectra in figure [ spec5248 ] reveal something quite remarkable : the old stellar population ii disk of an optically grand design galaxy , , can be almost identical to that of an optically flocculent , ( compare figures [ spec5248 ] and [ spec4062 ] ) .",
    "also has two peaks for the @xmath0=2 mode , one at @xmath12 and another for @xmath13 , which proves the existence of two wave - trains with different winding senses : one trailing , the other leading .      in order to shed further information about the modes we have detected , we calculated the inverse fourier transform in a different way to that illustrated in figs .",
    "[ imag4062 ] and [ imag5248 ] .",
    "the goal is to separate the trailing and the leading components , and in order to study their individual characteristics , we calculate the @xmath14 functions by considering only @xmath12 or @xmath13 . in other words , for the trailing mode , we use    @xmath15    and for the leading one ,    @xmath16    in figs .",
    "[ surface4062 ] and [ surface5248 ] we plot the @xmath17 and the @xmath18 functions for and , respectively .",
    "these functions peak where we find the first maximum in the arm / interarm contrast ( see figs . [ armintarm4062 ] and [ armintarm5248 ] below ) . also plotted in figs .",
    "[ surface4062 ] and [ surface5248 ] is the ratio between the @xmath17 and the @xmath18 functions .",
    "this ratio is important for comparisons with theoretical studies .",
    "as one can see , the ratio is of the order of 0.4@xmath190.5 for almost all the spatial extent of the spiral arms in both galaxies .",
    "the ratio shows an increase towards smaller distances ( nearer to the bulges of the galaxies ) and also for larger radii ( probably near to the co - rotation radius - see below ) .    by using the @xmath17 and the @xmath18 functions , we can separate the leading and the trailing spirals of each galaxy . in figs .",
    "[ phase4062 ] and [ phase5248 ] we plot the phase of each component ( see puerari and dottori @xcite ) for and , respectively .",
    "the phase represents the azimuthal position of the maximum intensity of each spiral .",
    "so , when the difference between the phases of the leading and the trailing components is 0@xmath20 or 180@xmath20 , the spiral pattern of the galaxy must show a maximum .",
    "in contrast , when the phase difference is 90@xmath20 , the spiral arms of the galaxy must show a minimum . for",
    ", we find 2.2 and 3.9 kpc for the positions of the maxima , and 2.9 kpc for the minimum .",
    "these values are in complete agreement with the peaks and the dip in the arm / interarm contrast ( see fig .",
    "[ armintarm4062 ] , below ) .",
    "the situation is a little more complex for . for this galaxy ,",
    "the values for the positions of the maxima are 3.6 and 8.3 kpc , and for the minimum , we find 5.2 kpc .",
    "these values do not fit the arm / interarm contrast as well as does the data for ( see fig .",
    "[ armintarm5248 ] , below ) .",
    "this discrepancy could be explained by the fact that is not quite as symmetric as .",
    "future models might be able to use these leading and trailing waves to locate the co - rotation radius .",
    "leading modes propagate outward inside co - rotation and inward outside co - rotation , so that a leading spiral commencing from the nuclear region would only extend to the co - rotation radius ; in other words , co - rotation would be where the leading spiral ends ( c. yuan , private communication ) .",
    "the difficulty in the present study in placing the co - rotation resonance is that the leading arm is not directly seen in our near - infrared images ; rather , its existence is inferred from the arm modulation .",
    "it is well known that the arm / interarm contrast in spiral galaxies usually increases with radius ( elmegreen and elmegreen @xcite ) . while some of the galaxies in their sample revealed arm / interarm profiles with a simple sinusoidal pattern in the i band ( 0.85@xmath1 ) , a large percentage of them showed a chaotic behaviour .",
    "some galaxies can be optically thick even at i. we have calculated the arm / interarm contrast following elmegreen and elmegreen ( @xcite ) .",
    "we have drawn azimuthal profiles for a number of radii , and by using an interactive plotting program , we have taken a mean value at the maxima ( where the spiral arms are located ) and a mean value at the ` troughs ' ( the interarm regions ) .",
    "the final value is calculated from intensity values as follows :    @xmath21    in figures [ armintarm4062 ] and [ armintarm5248 ] we plot the calculated arm / interarm contrast for and , respectively .",
    "the maximum values for ( the flocculent galaxy ) are approximately 3 times less than those for ( grand design ) . as one can see , the arm / interarm contrast increases with radius , but not in a monotonic way .",
    "the modulation of the intensity is caused by the interference between the incoming and the outgoing density waves and is clearly evident in our plots .",
    "the sinusoidal behaviour is even more remarkable in the flocculent .",
    "it is important to note that the values for the arm / interarm contrast calculated for these two galaxies are in complete agreement with other studies ( eg .",
    ", elmegreen et al .",
    "values of arm / interarm contrast as high as 2 are not unreasonable ( see fig .",
    "6 of elmegreen et al .",
    "a near - infrared study of m100 by gnedin et al .",
    "( @xcite ) yields an arm / interarm contrast of 3 .",
    "high arm / interarm contrasts do not imply unrealistic high perturbations of the velocity fields .",
    "rather , what is important is the ratio of the arm mass to the enclosed galaxy mass at a given radius . the arm is but a small fraction of the entire mass of the galaxy inside any given radius , so that the streaming motions are small , even for high arm / interarm contrasts",
    "the existence of leading spiral patterns in a differentially rotating disk is a complex issue .",
    "questions such as how such patterns can survive the shearing of a disk differential rotation come to the fore .",
    "how can one infer the presence of leading and trailing spiral arms if they are not both directly seen ?",
    "we have constructed a simple model using the values of from table [ tabspec ] .",
    "the model is very simple in the sense that we do not give a radial dependence of arm density .",
    "the synthetic image has a density equal to unity for the main trailing arms , and a density equal to 0.65 for the weaker leading patterns ( this was chosen to get the same ratio @xmath22 ) .",
    "the fourier spectra of these synthetic logarithmic spirals are shown in figure [ specmodel ] .",
    "the synthetic spirals , together with the contours for the @xmath0=2 component are shown in figure [ imagmodel ] .",
    "note that the leading patterns do not appear directly on the contours .",
    "_ nevertheless , their existence can be inferred from the interference patterns_. as expected , the contours show maxima at the intersection of the two ( trailing and leading ) patterns .    therefore , if the synthetic spirals represent incoming and outgoing spiral density waves on an axisymmetric disk , an interference pattern will be established where stellar density will be larger at locales of constructive interference in our near - infrared images .",
    "although the phases of the two patterns are different ( see table [ tabspec ] ) , the maxima are separated by approximately 90@xmath20 . to quote toomre ( @xcite ) ,",
    "_ `` the 90@xmath20 spacing of their successive density maxima [ in his models ] argues eloquently for the presence of trailing and leading waves of very similar wavelengths , ... ' ' _ .",
    "a two dimensional fourier analysis provides a robust method for detecting both trailing and leading spirals in galaxies far more distant than or .",
    "we have applied our method to near - infrared images of ( optically flocculent ) and ( optically grand design ) . in both cases ,",
    "we have inferred the existence of dominant @xmath0=2 trailing and secondary @xmath0=2 leading spirals in the fourier spectra .",
    "the consequence of two peaks with _",
    "different winding sense _ in the @xmath0=2 component directly implies spiral arm modulation .    in each case , the pitch angle of both trailing ( @xmath23 ) and leading ( @xmath24 ) waves is almost the same ( @xmath25=@xmath26 and @xmath27=@xmath28 for , and @xmath25=@xmath29 and @xmath27=@xmath30 for ) .",
    "this was the case also for ( elmegreen et al .",
    "this is highly suggestive that the incoming and the outgoing wave - trains have similar wavelengths .",
    "the amplitude ratio @xmath31 is about 0.5 in both and , wherein the higher amplitude is consistently assigned to the trailing mode .",
    "the amplitude ratio is independent of absolute magnitude ( 19.44 for and 21.19 for ) and arm class .",
    "the arm / interarm contrast increases for both galaxies , but not in a monotonic way .",
    "the sinusoidal behaviour ( seen in the modulation of the intensity ) betrays the interference between incoming and outgoing density waves .",
    "this study has also demonstrated the efficiency of near - infrared images for understanding the mass distributions in galaxies which appear quite dis - similar optically , but which have much in common when examined in the infrared regime .",
    "our observations of spiral arm amplitude modulations supports the idea originally proposed by lin ( @xcite ) that density waves turn around by reflection or refraction inside galaxies , presumably in the inner regions where the incoming , short - wavelengths , trailing waves ( toomre @xcite ) meet the kinematically hot stellar bulge . in the present study",
    ", the observed symmetry of the leading waves , with pitch angles comparable to those of the trailing waves , indicates that the outgoing waves also have short - wavelengths , and this is consistent with the expected group velocity of outward - moving , _ leading _ waves .",
    "this result implies that the bulge region _ reflects _ incoming waves ( no change of pitch angle ) , but changes their sense of winding .",
    "moreover , the amplification mechanism , which is always at co - rotation , must be waser type ii , rather than waser type i. the waser i mechanism involves outward - moving , _",
    "long_-wavelengths , _ trailing _ waves formed by _",
    "refraction _ near the bulge and amplified at co - rotation without a change in winding sense , i.e. by superreflection ( mark @xcite ) .",
    "modal analysis of the structures found here , using also the observable velocity dispersions of the stars , could in principle determine the disk and halo mass distributions and the pattern speeds of the spirals , as was done for ( lowe et al .",
