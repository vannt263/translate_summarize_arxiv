    "recent years have seen the development of a wide range of semi - conducting nanostructures including quantum wells ( qws ) , nanowires ( nws ) , and quantum dots ( qds ) .",
    "researchers have devoted particular attention to making devices from iii - v materials such as gaas , whose high electron mobility and direct band gap make it a critical component of today s semiconductor technology .",
    "iii - v systems are extremely versatile in large part due to techniques such as molecular beam epitaxy ( mbe ) and metal - organic chemical vapor deposition ( mocvd ) , which enable the growth of complex heterostructures with nearly perfect crystalline interfaces . as a result ,",
    "applications range from integrated circuits operating at microwave frequencies to light - emitting and laser diodes to quantum structures used for basic research .",
    "while a variety of techniques exist to characterize and image these nanostructures , including scanning electron microscopy ( sem ) , tunneling electron microscopy ( tem ) , and x - ray crystallography , so far it has been impossible to measure single nano - structures using magnetic resonance imaging ( mri ) . in larger structures , mri is a powerful technique allowing for the three - dimensional ( 3d ) , sub - surface imaging of the density of particular nuclear magnetic moments .",
    "however , conventional nuclear magnetic resonance ( nmr ) techniques , in which the spin signal is detected by an inductive pick - up coil , are limited to detection volumes of several @xmath3 on a side or larger .",
    "@xcite a net polarization of at least @xmath4 nuclear spins is typically needed to generate a detectable signal ; nanometer - scale samples simply do not contain enough spins to be detected . in the past few years , a more sensitive force - detected version of mri has been demonstrated on nanometer - scale samples . @xcite using magnetic resonance force microscopy ( mrfm ) to measure the statistical polarization of spin-1/2 @xmath5h , degen et al .  made 3d images of single virus particles with a resolution better than 10 @xmath6 .",
    "@xcite    here we take a step toward applying this technique to quadrupolar ( spin-3/2 ) nuclei , specifically ga and as , in a nanometer - scale particle .",
    "we demonstrate the detection of statistical polarizations of @xmath7ga , @xmath8ga , and @xmath9as in a 0.6 @xmath10 particle of crystalline gaas . the mechanical detection of nmr in gaas was first demonstrated in 2002 by verhagen et al .  and thurber et al",
    "@xcite the smallest reported detection volume of 600 @xmath11 contained more than @xmath4 nuclear moments .",
    "@xcite in 2004 , garner et al .  reported forced - detected nmr signal from @xmath12 moments in a gaas wafer .",
    "@xcite those experiments measured either the thermal equilibrium polarization or an optically enhanced polarization of ga and as spins .",
    "our experiment has a detection volume of about @xmath13 equivalent to less than @xmath14 spins of any one of the constituent isotopes .",
    "such a volume is far too tiny to detect via conventional , inductively - detected magnetic resonance , although the number of spins is not yet small enough that its polarization is dominated by statistical fluctuations . future reductions in detection volume , however , will enter this regime and will require techniques like the one demonstrated here .",
    "conventional magnetic resonance signals originate from the mean polarization of nuclear spins in an external magnetic field  the so - called boltzmann polarization .",
    "although this polarization is quite small , it dominates the spin signal for large ensembles of nuclear spins .",
    "as the size of the spin ensemble decreases , the amplitude of the polarization fluctuations eventually exceeds the mean polarization .",
    "@xcite this variance , sometimes called the statistical polarization , then becomes a more useful signal for mri than the mean polarization .",
    "statistical polarization arises from the incomplete cancellation of randomly oriented spins . for any given direction ,",
    "the net polarization can be either positive or negative and will fluctuate on a time scale that depends on the flip rate of the spins .",
    "several mrfm experiments have detected statistical polarizations of spin-1/2 nuclear spins @xcite and demonstrated their use for nanometer - scale nuclear mri .",
    "@xcite    in order to understand the regimes in which either boltzmann or statistical polarization is important , consider an ensemble of @xmath15 spins with spin quantum number @xmath16 .",
    "the hamiltonian of a single spin in the presence of a magnetic field @xmath17 along the @xmath18 is @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the magnetic dipole moment operator along @xmath18 , @xmath21 is planck s constant , @xmath22 is the gyromagnetic ratio , and @xmath23 is the nuclear spin angular momentum operator along @xmath18 .",
    "statistical mechanics predicts the equilibrium distribution at a temperature @xmath24 to be a boltzmann distribution .",
    "the partition function @xmath25 contains all the information about the nuclear spin polarization in the system .",
    "@xcite the density matrix @xmath26 of the spin system can be used to compute the mean @xmath27 and the variance @xmath28 of the ensemble s magnetization along @xmath18 . even at cryogenic temperatures ( @xmath29 k ) and high magnetic fields ( @xmath30 t ) ,",
    "@xmath31 . therefore ,",
    "keeping terms only up to first order in @xmath32 , we find : @xmath33 since @xmath34 corresponds to @xmath35 spin polarization , one can define the statistical nuclear polarization as @xmath36 and the boltzmann nuclear polarization as @xmath37 .",
    "statistical polarization dominates the system ( @xmath38 ) when the number of spins in an ensemble is less than the critical number , @xmath39 equivalently , for a material with a nuclear spin density @xmath40 , where @xmath41 is the number density of the nuclear element and @xmath42 is the natural abundance of the isotope of interest , one can define a critical volume @xmath43 . for volumes smaller than @xmath44 , magnetic resonance experiments should be designed to detect @xmath45 rather than @xmath46 .",
    "we measure the presence of a particular nuclear isotope using an mrfm protocol which cyclically inverts statistical spin polarization .",
    "@xcite in a magnetic field @xmath47 , the frequency of a transverse rf magnetic field @xmath48 is swept through the nuclear resonance condition , @xmath49 .",
    "if done adiabatically , this sweep induces the nuclear spins to invert  a process known as adiabatic rapid passage . in the strong spatial magnetic field gradient near a magnetic tip , these inversions produce a time - dependent force .",
    "this force is in turn detected as the displacement of an ultrasensitive cantilever .",
    "our mrfm experiment is carried out in a sample - on - cantilever configuration in which the sample is affixed to the end of a single - crystal si cantilever @xcite as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : sample ] .",
    "we arrange the cantilever in a `` pendulum '' geometry such that the sample is positioned above a feco magnetic tip , depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : setup ] .",
    "the magnetic tip , which is mounted on a separate chip , is patterned on top of an au microwire , which acts as an rf magnetic field source and is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : microwire ] .",
    "@xcite    , the cantilever shaft , and the magnetization of the feco tip are aligned along @xmath18 . near the feco tip , current flows in the wire along @xmath50 , while the lever displacement and @xmath48 at the position of the sample are directed along @xmath51.,width=377 ]    the cantilever measures @xmath52 and  loaded with the gaas sample  has a mechanical resonance frequency @xmath53 and an intrinsic quality factor @xmath54 at @xmath24 = 1 k. by measuring the cantilever s thermal motion , we determine its effective spring constant to be @xmath55 .",
    "the mrfm apparatus is isolated from vibrational noise and is mounted in a vacuum chamber with a pressure below @xmath56 at the bottom of a @xmath11he cryostat .",
    "the motion of the lever is detected using 100 nw of 1550 nm laser light focused onto a 12 @xmath3-wide paddle and reflected back into an optical fiber interferometer .",
    "the microwire used to produce the transverse rf magnetic field is 2.5 @xmath57-long , 1 @xmath57-wide , and 0.2 @xmath57-thick . the feco tip is shaped like a bar , sits on top of the microwire , and produces a spatially dependent field @xmath58 .",
    "it has a top width of 270 @xmath59 , a bottom width of 510 @xmath6 , a length of 1.2 @xmath3 , and a height of @xmath60 as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : microwire ] . to make sure that the feco tip is fully magnetized along the @xmath18 , an external magnetic field @xmath61 is applied with @xmath62 t. during measurements ,",
    "the distance between the feco tip and the closest point on the sample is typically 100 @xmath6 such that the static magnetic field gradient @xmath63 relevant to mrfm is on the order of @xmath64 t / m , where @xmath65 and @xmath51 is the direction of cantilever oscillation .",
    "the maximum @xmath66 for this spacing is about @xmath67 .",
    "smaller spacings can result is larger @xmath63 and @xmath68 , although they also result in larger measurement noise .",
    "interactions between the magnetic tip and the sample at such small gaps , known as non - contact friction , lead to mechanical dissipation in the cantilever .",
    "@xcite in our experiments , these effects reduce the quality factor @xmath69 of the cantilever to @xmath70 . in addition , we damp @xmath69 down to @xmath71 using active electronic feedback .",
    "@xcite given the narrow natural bandwidth of our high-@xmath69 cantilever , damping serves to increase the bandwidth of our force detection with out sacrificing signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) .",
    "@xcite        if the rate of the rf frequency sweeps used to invert the nuclear spins is slow enough and the amplitude of @xmath72 large enough , the initial population distribution among the nuclear spin energy levels is completely inverted . as a result",
    ", the net magnetization is made to flip along the @xmath18 .",
    "for spin-1/2 nuclei , the criterion for adiabatic inversion is given by @xmath73 , where @xmath74 is the amplitude of the frequency modulation around the center frequency @xmath75 of the transverse rf field @xmath72 .",
    "@xcite the criterion for quadrupolar nuclei , in general , is more complex .",
    "@xcite however , a complete inversion of the initial population distribution over the quadrupolar energy levels can be achieved in the limit of both @xmath76 and @xmath77 , where @xmath78 is the quadrupolar frequency .",
    "the frequency sweeps used here are designed to meet these conditions and follow the form used in poggio et al .",
    "@xcite therefore , by sweeping through @xmath75 at a frequency @xmath79 , we are able to modulate the spin polarization at @xmath80 .",
    "the resulting spin inversions produce a force that drives the cantilever at its resonance frequency .",
    "an ensemble of spins at position @xmath81 with a statistical variance in its @xmath82-magnetization @xmath83 produces a force on the cantilever with variance , @xmath84 using our knowledge of the spring constant @xmath85 , we determine @xmath86 by measuring the variance of the cantilever s oscillations on resonance .",
    "the correlation time @xmath87 of @xmath86 is limited by the relaxation rate of the spins in the rotating frame .",
    "h , @xmath7ga , @xmath8ga , and @xmath9as .",
    "black dots show the resonant force variance @xmath86 as a function of the center frequency @xmath75 .",
    "solid red lines represent adjacent - averaging of the data as a guide to the eye .",
    "inset is a zoomed - in view of the spin-3/2 nuclear resonances : @xmath7ga , @xmath8ga , and @xmath9as .",
    "error bars represent the standard error of @xmath86 calculated as in degen et al .",
    "@xcite data points represent 1400 s of averaging for @xmath9as , 600 s for @xmath7ga , 600 s for @xmath8ga , and 300 s for @xmath5h . ]",
    "due to differences in magnetic moment and statistical polarization , two ensembles containing the same number of nuclei but each of a different isotope , produce different magnetization variances .",
    "this difference is contained within the concept of receptivity .",
    "receptivity is a value defined for the purpose of comparing the expected nmr signal magnitudes for equal numbers of different nuclear isotopes . for mrfm of statistically polarized ensembles , we define a receptivity , @xmath88 , where @xmath89 is normalized to 1 for @xmath5h .",
    "the factor @xmath90 is proportional to the magnetization variance expected from an ensemble of spins as defined in ( [ eq2 ] ) . from ( [ eq4 ] )",
    "the variance , multiplied by the square of the magnetic field gradient , results in the resonant force variance measured in mrfm .    on the other hand",
    ", conventional nmr collects an inductive signal due to a boltzmann polarization . in this case",
    ", receptivity can be defined as @xmath91 , where @xmath92 is similarly normalized to 1 for @xmath5h . here",
    "the factor @xmath90 is proportional to the boltzmann polarization as defined in equation ( [ eq1 ] ) .",
    "the remaining factor of @xmath22 results from the fact that conventional nmr measures the inductive response of a pick - up coil to magnetization precessing at a frequency proportional to @xmath22 .",
    "@xcite    as can be noted in table [ table : theory ] , mrfm receptivity scales more favorably than conventional receptivity for low-@xmath22 nuclei such as those found in gaas . in real experiments",
    ", comparisons are often made between signals from two different isotopes contained in the same volume . in the comparison of volumes rather than number of nuclei",
    ", one must also take into account the number density @xmath41 of each element in the material and its natural isotopic abundance @xmath42 .",
    "volume receptivity therefore also includes the factors of @xmath41 and @xmath42 : @xmath93 and @xmath94 .",
    ".properties relevant for a statistically polarized mrfm measurement . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]",
    "the results presented here , demonstrate our ability to detect nanometer - scale volumes of ga and as nuclei using mrfm .",
    "given the spin sensitivity extrapolated from our data and our model , the detection of iii - v nanostructures such as nanowires or sub - surface self - assembled inas qds should be possible .",
    "self - assembled inas qds , for example , contain @xmath95@xmath96 nuclear spins , lie as close as @xmath97 from the wafer surface , and could be attached to a cantilever using the fib technique demonstrated here .",
    "further improvements to the force sensitivity  most importantly for reducing measurement times  will be required in order to realize mri in iii - v materials with better than 100 nm resolution .",
    "the potential for sub - surface , isotopically selective imaging on the nanometer - scale in iii - v materials is a particularly exciting prospect since conventional methods such as sem and tem lack isotopic contrast .",
