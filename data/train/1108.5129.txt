    "the concept of identical particles and associated particle statistics lies at the foundations of quantum mechanics .",
    "it arises as a consequence of the non - observability of particle interchange and the fact that states in quantum mechanics are represented by rays in a complex hilbert space , i.e. only determined up to a complex phase .",
    "a quantum mechanical state describing @xmath4 distinguishable particles moving in @xmath5 is represented by an _",
    "@xmath4-particle wave function _ , i.e. a square - integrable complex - valued function @xmath6 defined on @xmath4 copies of @xmath5 , or equivalently , by an element of the tensor product space @xmath7 derived from the one - particle hilbert space @xmath8 . upon restricting to _ identical _ particles ,",
    "the freedom of choice of particle statistics stems from the fact that only the amplitude @xmath9 of the wave function  describing ( the square root of ) the probability density for measuring the specific configuration @xmath10 of particle positions @xmath11  is observable , but not the exact phase @xmath12 .",
    "hence , since there should be no observable difference between the particle configuration @xmath13 and the one @xmath14 , with particles @xmath15 and @xmath16 interchanged , the amplitudes must be the same , but the phase may differ , as expressed by @xmath17 with @xmath18 . in three and higher dimensions",
    "one finds that the only two possibilites for such a phase are @xmath19 , corresponding to _ bosons _",
    "( such as photons ) with the plus sign , and _ fermions _",
    "( such as electrons ) with the minus sign .",
    "it is in fact sufficient to consider the permutation group @xmath20 acting on the @xmath4-particle hilbert space @xmath21 , and the wave functions describing identical bosons respectively fermions are then given by the completely symmetric resp .",
    "antisymmetric @xmath4-particle wave functions , which in the latter case can be represented by the hilbert space @xmath22 .",
    "however , in two dimensions the statistics parameter @xmath3 can be taken to be _ any _ real number in the interval @xmath23 ( or @xmath24 $ ] , by periodicity ) .",
    "again , bosons correspond to @xmath1 and fermions to @xmath2 , while for a general choice of @xmath3 the corresponding particles are simply called _ anyons _ ( or , historically , just `` particles obeying _ intermediate _ or _ fractional statistics _ '' @xcite ) .",
    "this discrepancy between two and higher spatial dimensions is directly related to the fact that a punctured plane is not simply connected , while @xmath25 _ is _ , for @xmath26 .",
    "hence , for particles confined to the plane one has to consider _ continuous _ interchanges of particles , forming a loop in the configuration space ( together with the possibility of enclosing other particles in that loop ) , and the permutation group symmetry is replaced by the _ braid group _",
    "@xmath27 , whose one - dimensional unitary representations determine the choice of statistics for identical anyons through the phase @xmath28 . for a convenient and rigorous treatment of anyons",
    ", one can model them as identical bosons or fermions in the plane , but with a magnetic interaction of aharonov - bohm type between each pair of particles , giving rise to the correct statistics phase as the particles encircle each other .",
    "the quantum mechanical momenta of the particles , which for bosons and fermions are simply given by the gradients @xmath29 w.r.t .",
    "the particle positions @xmath30 , will then be replaced by covariant ( magnetic ) derivatives @xmath31 ( see below ) .",
    "fermions in any dimension are special , since they satisfy the so - called _ pauli exclusion principle_. namely , because of the antisymmetry of the wave function , no two particles can occupy the exact same state , expressed simply with the help of the wedge product as @xmath32 for any one - particle state @xmath33",
    ". an important and non - trivial consequence of this is the celebrated _ lieb - thirring inequality _ , which given a scalar potential @xmath34 on @xmath5 can be summarized as @xmath35 where @xmath36 denote the negative eigenvalues ( ordered with decreasing magnitude ) of the one - particle schrdinger operator @xmath37 acting in @xmath8 .",
    "the first inequality just expresses the fact that , because of the pauli principle for fermions , the lowest possible energy ( l.h.s .",
    "of ) is obtained when the particles assume the states corresponding to the lowest @xmath4 eigenvalues @xmath36 , i.e. when @xmath38 is an antisymmetrized product of those one - particle eigenfunctions @xmath39 .",
    "the second inequality holds uniformly in @xmath4 and concerns the trace over the negative spectrum of the one - particle operator @xmath40 .",
    "ever since the first proof of in 1975 by lieb and thirring @xcite , who used this result for a simplified proof of stability of fermionic matter ( see also @xcite ) , there has been a lot of activity in the mathematical community aiming to generalize this type of spectral estimate for one - particle operators in various directions .",
    "furthermore , the lieb - thirring inequality ( disregarding the intermediate sum over eigenvalues ) is equivalent to the _ kinetic energy inequality _ @xmath41 which can be interpreted as a strong form of the uncertainty principle for fermions , because of the way it bounds the total kinetic energy @xmath42 in terms of the one - particle density @xmath43 of the wave function ( always assumed to be normalized to @xmath44 ) .",
    "bosons , on the other hand , do not satisfy any exclusion principle .",
    "they can all be put in the same state , e.g. @xmath45 , and hence can not be expected to satisfy the inequalities or .",
    "in fact , the best we can do is to treat them as @xmath4 copies of a single particle satisfying , and hence the above inequalities hold only in the weaker form @xmath46 resp .",
    "appendix b ) @xmath47 which now only encodes the uncertainty principle , without the extra gain in due to statistics .",
    "these bosonic inequalities become trivial as @xmath48 .    in contrast , not much has been known about the spectral and statistical properties of many anyons for @xmath49 .",
    "not even the ground state energy of an otherwise non - interacting gas of anyons has been rigorously estimated ( note that this is trivial in the case of bosons , and a simple exercise in the case of fermions ) .",
    "even though we live in a three - dimensional world , there are situations where anyons are believed to describe , in the form of quasi - particles , the excitations in effective two - dimensional highly correlated systems ( see e.g. @xcite ) . analyzing the thermodynamic properties of a gas of anyons may therefore be of importance in understanding such systems .",
    "although the free anyon gas , which we consider here , is much simpler than the effective systems mentioned above , we consider investigating its thermodynamic properties a first step in such an analysis .",
    "the problem of understanding the ground state properties of the anyon gas has been attacked by many authors through various approximations ( see the references in the books and reviews @xcite ) .",
    "the main difficulty lies in the fact that many - anyon wave functions can not be simply related to one - particle wave functions in the same way as for bosons and fermions . as will be seen explicitly below , the hamiltonian operator @xmath50 describing the kinetic energy of @xmath4 free anyons is not just a free laplacian acting on totally symmetric or antisymmetric wave functions , but involves long - range magnetic interactions between all the particles .",
    "in particular , we can not reduce our study to the relatively simple case of a one - particle schrdinger operator @xmath40 .",
    "the aim of the present paper is to address this gap in knowledge concerning intermediate anyon statistics , as well as the current lack of techniques to study the spectral theory of such quantum mechanical systems .",
    "in particular , we develop a technique for proving lieb - thirring inequalities for interacting systems , resulting in theorem [ thm : lt - anyon - intro ] below for anyons .",
    "the operator @xmath51 given explicitly in is singular when particle @xmath15 coincides with one of the other particles .",
    "the operator @xmath52 is therefore defined as the friedrichs extension from smooth functions vanishing when particles coincide .",
    "this might seem to imply a hard - core condition on anyons , but we have recently shown in @xcite that it actually does not , since it also corresponds to the _ maximal _ extension of the energy form @xmath53 .",
    "our first main result concerns a magnetic many - particle hardy inequality for @xmath4 anyons , which when considered on the full two - dimensional plane @xmath54 reads : @xmath55 with the statistics - dependent constant @xmath56 a stronger form of , given as theorem [ thm : many - anyon - hardy ] below , and valid for any convex subdomain @xmath57 , is shown to produce a local form of _ pauli s exclusion principle for anyons _ ( given as lemma [ lem : energy_in_ball ] below ) , whose strength depends on the large-@xmath4 behavior of the constant @xmath58 .",
    "although @xmath58 is clearly non - zero for all @xmath4 whenever @xmath3 is irrational , we find that @xmath59 , unless @xmath60 with @xmath61 and @xmath62 relatively prime integers and @xmath61 odd , in which case we shall see that @xmath63 .    for such",
    "_ odd numerator fractions _",
    "@xmath60 , the energy given by the local pauli exclusion principle for arbitrary numbers of particles is of a similar form as for fermions , but with an extra factor @xmath64 ( depending wildly on the statistics parameter ) .",
    "our second main result is that this local bound is sufficient to produce a lieb - thirring inequality for these types of anyons . in our approach",
    "we have been inspired by dyson and lenard s original proof of the stability of fermionic matter in three dimensions @xcite ( from 1967 , before the advent of the lieb - thirring inequality ) , in which the only place where the pauli principle came in was through such a local bound for the energy .",

    "@xmath70 and @xmath71 are universal positive constants that can be given explicitly .    in particular",
    ", this implies that the total kinetic energy @xmath42 per unit area for a non - interacting ( apart from the statistical interaction ) gas of anyons with odd - fractional statistics @xmath60 , confined to an area @xmath72 , is bounded below by @xmath73 where @xmath74 is the average density of the gas .",
    "our assumption on alpha being an odd numerator rational may look peculiar , and could of course be an artifact of our proof , however it certainly raises the very interesting question whether it is necessary or not .",
    "other implications of this lieb - thirring inequality , such as for interacting anyon gases , as well as this question of sharpness concerning even - fractional and irrational statistics and its physical interpretation , will be discussed elsewhere @xcite .",
    "we have also extended some of our techniques to the case of identical particles in one dimension @xcite .",
    "the structure of this paper is as follows . in section 2",
    "we fix the notation and briefly recall the general theory of particle statistics . our fundamental many - particle hardy inequality for anyons is proven in section 3 based on a pairwise relative parameterization of the configuration space , combined with a local magnetic hardy inequality which takes into account the underlying symmetry between the particles .",
    "section 4 concerns the local gain in energy following from these hardy inequalities , which we refer to as a local pauli exclusion principle for anyons due to its direct similarity with the corresponding local gain in energy for fermions . in section 5",
    "we use this local gain to prove the lieb - thirring inequality for anyons . in the appendices we have placed some suggestions for improvements of the local energy bound , as well as a proof of a lieb - thirring inequality on cubes with neumann boundary conditions .",
    "we emphasize that , although a lieb - thirring - type inequality for anyons could perhaps have been anticipated based on physical grounds ( at least for some values of the statistics parameter @xmath3 ) , this is from a purely mathematical perspective a highly non - trivial extension of the usual lieb - thirring inequality since the relevant operator @xmath75 with @xmath76 being the differential operators given explicitly in below , is now a strongly interacting magnetic many - particle hamiltonian .",
    "our method for proving lieb - thirring inequalities for interacting many - particle hamiltonians was recently used in @xcite for a model with point interactions in three dimensions .",
    "d.l . would like to thank oscar andersson forsman for discussions related to appendix a.",
    "in this subsection , which is _ not _ a prerequisite for understanding the rest of the paper , we give a very brief recap of the general theory of particle statistics in @xmath77 dimensions .",
    "for more details we refer to the basic reference @xcite , the review articles @xcite , and the books @xcite on anyons .    the classical configuration space of @xmath4 identical particles in @xmath5 is formally given by @xmath78 where we have excluded all coincidences of the particles , i.e. the diagonals @xmath79 and the symmetric group @xmath20 acts on the @xmath4 copies of @xmath5 in the obvious way .",

    "wave functions of @xmath4 identical particles are defined as square - integrable complex - valued functions on @xmath83 with appropriate gluing conditions ( recall the physical requirement ) .",
    "hence , these can be viewed as sections of a complex line bundle over @xmath83 .",
    "there are natural flat connections on such line bundles , taking the trivial connection locally on @xmath87 ( note that the parallel transports could be _ globally _ non - trivial as there are non - trivial transition functions between local regions ) , and every such connection defines a unitary one - dimensional representation of the fundamental group @xmath88 . for @xmath26",

    "we shall denote the hilbert space of @xmath4-particle wave functions with a given statistics parameter @xmath3 by @xmath99 . in the case of bosons or fermions",

    "@xmath4-fermion wave functions .    in general , the line bundles corresponding to different @xmath3 are topologically equivalent , but not geometrically equivalent .",
    "the map ( singular gauge transformation ) @xmath100 ( where we pick an arbitrary real axis to identify @xmath54 with @xmath101 ) maps the line bundle corresponding to @xmath102 to the line bundle corresponding to @xmath3 .",
