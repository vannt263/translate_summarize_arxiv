    "the icecube neutrino observatory recently found strong evidence for high energy astrophysical neutrino flux at the level of @xmath5 gev/@xmath6/s / sr in three yeas of data @xcite . except the first 28 neutrinos announced before @xcite ,",
    "an additional 9 neutrino candidates from the third year of data has been reported @xcite .",
    "these total 37 events with observed energy of 30 tev  2 pev more than expected background of 15 events from atmospheric muons and neutrinos , indicate a 5.7 @xmath7 rejection of purely atmospheric hypothesis . of these events ,",
    "9 are identified with visible muon tracks .",
    "the remaining 28 events are cascades or showers , caused by neutrino interactions other than @xmath8 charged current .",
    "the origin of these high energy neutrinos at icecube is still mysterious @xcite .",
    "although the prompt atmospheric neutrino may contribute significantly with energy between 10 and 100 tev @xcite , the isotropic distribution of these events indicates astrophysical sources are the most natural explanation .",
    "many scenarios have been discussed in the literature , including cores of active galactic nuclei @xcite , @xmath9-ray bursts @xcite and their lower - powered counterparts @xcite , galaxies with intense star - formation @xcite , active galaxies @xcite , flat - spectrum radio quasars @xcite and intergalactic shocks @xcite . due to the weak cluster of events near the galactic centre , some analyses implied that galactic sources may be responsible for a fraction of the signals @xcite .",
    "the icecube  events may originate from the galactic centre ( gc ) @xcite , the fb  @xcite , galactic halo @xcite , or galactic plane @xcite .",
    "more studies suggested that the origination could also be from pev dark matter decay @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we investigate the possibility that icecube  might be observing signals from the fb .",
    "the two gamma - ray bubbles , observed by fermi - lat @xcite , are symmetrically located above and below the galactic centre , extending up to @xmath10 in galactic latitude .",
    "the origin of the fb  is still unknown .",
    "there are two main hypothesis , the supermassive black hole activity @xcite or high rate of star formation in the gc @xcite .",
    "the emitted gamma rays from the fb  are produced either via leptonic model , which is the inverse compton scattering of low energy photons by highly relativistic electrons , or via hadronic model , i.e. , decays of @xmath11 created from interactions of energetic baryons with gas in the fb . in the hadronic model , a neutrino counterpart with similar magnitude as gamma ray flux from the fb",
    "is produced @xcite , which could be detected as muon tracks or showers at km3net , antares , or icecube  @xcite .",
    "the antares collaboration has placed an upper limit for this neutrino flux , as seen in fig .",
    "[ fluxfig ] @xcite .",
    "later , we will quantitatively present the down - going muon track as well as shower events from the fb  at icecube  , not only as a possible interpretation of icecube  events , but also as prediction for future searches .",
    "the fermi bubbles are seen as extended sources in the southern sky , see fig .",
    "[ icdata ] , subtending a 0.808 sr solid angle @xcite .",
    "their gamma ray flux is fairly uniform over the extent of the bubbles @xcite , and it is expected the neutrino flux has the same feature @xcite .",
    "we compare the coordinates of the 37 icecube  all - sky search events and their median angular errors @xcite with the bubbles coordinates , see fig .  [ icdata ] .",
    "note that event 32 produced by pair of background muons is not labeled in fig .",
    "[ icdata ] , because it can not be reconstructed with a single direction and energy @xcite .",
    "it appears at least 5 events , number 2 , 12 , 14 , 15 , 36 are strongly correlated with the fb whose central position values are inside the bubbles .",
    "in addition , events 17 , 22 , 24,25 , are weakly correlated with the fb  whose values , within errors , are compatible with the bubbles . among these 9 correlated events ,",

    "these neutrino fluxes are produced from the interactions of cosmic ray protons from supernova remnants with the ambient gas .",
    "the proton spectrum has the form of @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is the cutoff energy , motivated by the maximum energy that accelerated protons may reach , varying from 1 - 100 pev @xcite . by fitting the gamma ray data of the fb , the spectral index @xmath14 is taken as our default model ; meanwhile , due to the limited number of gamma ray data points , a steeper spectrum with @xmath15 is also compatible with observation , as seen in fig .",
