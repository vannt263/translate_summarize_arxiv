    "we say @xmath6 has _ exact spread _",
    "@xmath13 if @xmath6 has spread @xmath14 but not @xmath15 .",
    "this concept was first introduced by brenner and wiegold in @xcite , extending earlier work of binder in @xcite .",
    "the concept of spread may be thought of as a generalization of the idea of 3/2-generation .    since this note",
    "is not intended for publication , we omit background and motivation , but the interested reader may wish to consult @xcite . the reader should at least note that there has been considerable interest in determining , or at least bounding , the exact spreads of the finite simple groups and in particular the exact spreads of the sporadic simple groups .",
    "the precise value of the exact spread of a finite simple group is known in very few cases . here",
    "we prove the following .",
    "first note that from ( * ? ? ?",
    "* table 1 ) ( itself a heavily corrected version of ( * ? ? ?",
    "* table 1 ) ) we have that @xmath17 and so it is sufficient to show that any set of 8064 elements from m@xmath1 has a mate .",
    "let @xmath18 m@xmath3 be a set of 8064 distinct elements .",
    "now , from the maximal subgroups of m@xmath3 listed in @xcite we see that an element of order 23 is contained in only one maximal subgroup - a copy of the frobenius group 23:11 . since the normalizer in m@xmath3 of a cyclic subgroup of order 11 is a frobenius group 11:5 , each element of order 11",
    "is contained in five disctinct copies of 23:11 .",
    "it follows that the only way @xmath12 can avoid having a mate of order 23 is if @xmath12 consists of a well chosen configutation of elements of order 11 .",
    "finally , note that of the maximal subgroups of m@xmath3 containing elements of order 11 , which are each isomorphic to one of m@xmath19 , m@xmath20 or 23:11 , none contain elements of order 14 .",
    "it follows that even if @xmath12 only contains elements of order 11 , @xmath12 must have a mate and so @xmath21 ."
