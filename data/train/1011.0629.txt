    "the @xmath25800k temperature of the solar photosphere naturally decreases outwards . beyond a height of @xmath2500 km",
    ", i.e. , in the chromosphere , the beginning of a mysterious behaviour appears .",
    "the atmospheric temperature , instead of decreasing , starts rising again , up to 1 - 2mk , and this all of a sudden within only @xmath2100 km .",
    "how this temperature behaviour can happen steadily , and all over the entire sun , is dubbed the solar corona heating problem , _ one of the most perplexing and unresolved problems in astrophysics to date _ @xcite .",
    "the phenomenology of the solar atmosphere makes this mystery even more enigmatic .",
    "for example , the unnaturally high - temperature upper solar atmosphere becomes even hotter above non - flaring magnetized locations , like the puzzling dark sunspots , reaching about 5 - 10mk @xcite , while the underlying surface of the sunspots gets relatively cooler , reaching occasionally @xmath23000k , instead of the ambient @xmath25800k .",
    "the temperature difference between two neighbouring solar layers , i.e. , that of the photosphere and that of the corona , with the chromosphere sandwiched in between , widens .",
    "how can this additional and intriguing behaviour of the magnetized sun fit conventional thinking ?",
    "obviously , the solar magnetic field , is the ingredient adding _ somehow _ to the solar corona mystery .",
    "this finding is a second fingerprint of the corona s mystery , with the first being the formation of the surprisingly strong temperature inversion across the so - called transition region .",
    "furthermore , following conventional reasoning , we still do not know how magnetic energy is converted into thermal energy of the corona @xcite .",
    "the solar corona mystery is not an isolated one , but rather ubiquitous throughout the solar - type stars in the universe .",
    "astonishingly , the sun s radiation spectrum deviates strongly from that of a black body , and this reflects the whole mystery . for comparison ,",
    "an almost perfect black body spectrum is exhibited by the cmb radiation of the infant universe ( 3000k ) .",
    "therefore , the question arises as to why the sun behaves only partly as a perfect black body and how it manages to keep its tiny outer atmosphere , packed so close to its surface , at such an unnaturally high temperature .",
    "note that the sun is permeated spatiotemporally with unpredictably varying magnetic fields , which is the cause of many puzzling solar phenomena , while the early universe had diminishingly small magnetic fields .",
    "this difference is essential from the axion point of view , since the axion - photon oscillation probability , as most solar phenomena , shows a striking b@xmath1-dependence .",
    "one should bear in mind that no stellar theory expects a sun - like star to emit any measurable quantity of x - rays , as we witness since decades with the sun .    to the best of our knowledge , in recent times ,",
    "no other solar problem has defied explanation for so long , e.g. , take the solution of the solar neutrino deficit problem .",
    "it is logical to conclude that the mysterious coronal behaviour must be the manifestation of hidden new ( solar ) physics .",
    "other solar phenomena associated with the mysterious 11-year clock , like flares , coronal mass ejections , sunspots , spicules , etc .",
    "raise also serious questions about their ( not much less ) mysterious origin , thus further suggesting a ( common ? ) exotic solution .",
    "how can the solar behaviour be related to exotica like axions ?",
    "the production of axions inside the sun s core was widely accepted soon after their theoretical invention , constraining also their coupling strength to matter following the non - observation of additional star ageing effects @xcite . an extra energy escape from their hot core into space",
    "should have made them appear older than they actually are .",
    "in fact , stellar evolution arguments constrain the allowed escaping solar energy into axions to the -level . nevertheless , this is still a quite large percentage compared to the solar observations under consideration as being due to or triggered by new exotica .",
    "for example , the unexpected quiet sun x - ray emission makes only @xmath3 of its total energy output , while present x - ray missions detect solar fluxes at the level of @xmath4 .",
    "this demonstrates the enormous potential solar observations have to unravel new physics , with the axion scenario inspiring the most , since ( most ) puzzling solar phenomena correlate with the magnetic field .",
    "therefore , axion involvement in stars can have far reaching consequences , even if it causes only faint emission of radiation , since this leaves no signs of premature ageing .",
    "encouraged by the sun s groundbreaking impact in the past in nuclear and astroparticle physics , it was natural to be attracted by the sun s puzzling and inspiring behaviour , which depicts axion involvement .",
    "while we refer only to solar axions , the cause of the multifaceted and unpredictable sun is not necessarily due to one single process by one single particle s involvement , though in certain cases exotic scenarios remain the only choice . observations at extreme conditions , like the non - flaring quiet sun during solar minimum or an isolated active / flaring solar region , could favour the showing - up of one exotic component against other(s ) , if any .",
    "we refer throughout this work to axions , but we consider them as being representative of any other exotica dubbed wisps ( weakly interacting slim particles ) , which can couple similarly to ordinary matter , e.g. , intriguing scalar particles like the chameleons , which are potential candidates for the cosmic dark energy . while the qcd - inspired axion implies a particle with one rest mass and one coupling constant , wisps do not have to follow this constraint , e.g. massive solar axions of the kaluza ",
    "klein type @xcite .",
    "for the last 15 years , the search for axions in solar x - rays has mostly been oriented towards a very light axion ( rest mass@xmath5ev / c@xmath1 ) @xcite .",
    "but , if its mass is ( far ) above this range , any search should fail , and this is the case so far .",
    "therefore , this work addresses a much higher axion rest mass range ( @xmath220mev / c@xmath1 ) , albeit not intentionally but being observationally driven : if axions play a certain role in the sun s workings , then some strange phenomena should show up , at least occasionally , i.e. , with known physics being unable to provide an explanation .",
    "in fact , this is what happens so strikingly , since the sun is full of mysteries .",
    "we focus here on derived atypical solar axion signatures related to magnetic fields .",
    "for example , for the solar corona mystery , massive solar axions of the kaluza  klein type have been suggested as the potential source of the steady solar x - ray emission component @xcite .",
    "the very thin solar corona is rather similarly hot ( @xmath21 - 10mk ) as the hot solar core ( @xmath216mk ) , and therefore it requires an energy input , which has been elusive and has kept the corona mystery alive for several decades , even though there is no luck of proposed models .",
    "note , the corona density changes dynamically , e.g. , by factor up to @xmath210 - 100 @xcite .",
    "then , within the axion scenario , the observed solar corona reflects the balance between inwards directed radiation pressure from the spontaneous decay of massive axions of the kaluza ",
    "klein type or any other massive , radiatively - decaying wisps , while out - streaming axions being magnetically converted to x - rays exert an additional but outwards directed radiation pressure . to show the dynamical character of the sun , it is worth mentioning , for example , the mysterious solar spicules , which cover about 1% of the sun s surface ; their plasma density reaches values of @xmath6/@xmath7 , which are also of potential interest for axion - photon oscillations .",
    "figure [ figure1 ] shows the directly measured `` excess '' x - rays from the quietest to the flaring sun ( see figure 10 in @xcite ) . here",
    "we update the first intensity calculations presented in @xcite .",
    "thus , a magnetic - field - related x - ray emission , be it transient be it steady , can be , in principle , axion in origin . the maximum conversion rate of out - streaming axions near the magnetized solar surface was estimated to be @xmath8 ( see section 3 in @xcite ) .",
    "for comparison , assuming even that the entire quiet sun soft x - ray luminosity measured recently by the sphinx detector ( l@xmath9erg / s ) is due to converted axions , this requires an even smaller conversion rate ( @xmath10 ) .",
    "furthermore , since only @xmath21% of the complex magnetism of the quiet sun is seen @xcite , this leaves room for much larger conversion efficiencies ( @xmath11 ) , i.e. an x - ray brightness of 10@xmath12erg / cm@xmath1/sec can still be axion related , which is not small . in addition , the fading solar magnetic field during the 2009 solar minimum was correlated with a 100 times weaker soft x - ray emission than during the previous solar minimum measured by the sphinx mission @xcite .",
    "but , the only @xmath225% decrease of the solar magnetic field can not justify a 100-fold x - ray luminosity decrease , following a b@xmath1-dependence .",
    "but if , for example , the conversion occurs deeper inside the photosphere , some x - rays are absorbed , or , in any case they become more red - shifted and might evade observation .",
    "these measurements show that the calculated maximum axion conversion in @xcite was ( very ) conservative .",
    "moreover , there is room for still larger conversion , which could account also for larger x - ray surface brightness from flares : the rarity of such events may eventually reflect the not so easily achievable ` fine tuning ' of magnetic field and plasma density . while the aim of this work is not to explain all solar x - ray phenomena exclusively by axions ,",
    "this might be the case to a larger extent than anticipated so far ( given the mentioned uncertainties ) .",
    "in addition , figure [ figure2 ] shows the b@xmath1 dependence of the deficit ir emission above the magnetized sunspots .",
    "if this is due to the disappearance of photons into axions , it implies also an overlooked strong solar axion source at low energies with far reaching implications in solar axion research . finally , figure [ figure3 ] explains how one may make visible new signatures , hidden in the solar irradiance spectrum , using the normalised residuals from a pure black body distribution .",
    "20mk @xcite ( green dashed ) , b ) a flare with resik and rhessi ( red dots ) , c ) preflaring periods after having subtracted the main x - ray flare component from the original spectra @xcite ( purple histogram ) , d ) non - flaring active regions with t@xmath146mk , i.e. sunspots ( blue dots ) , e ) non - flaring quiet sun , with t@xmath15mk , at solar minimum with sphinx ( blue dashed line ) @xcite ; this is also supported by the recent findings that in the quiet sun regions stronger magnetic fields occur in deeper layers than in the ars @xcite , implying more down - comptonization and giving rise to a larger slope . the initial broad solar axion spectrum is also shown shadowed ( pink dashed line ) .",
    "two geant4 simulated spectra following multiple compton scattering from a depth of @xmath2350 km and @xmath2400 km are also shown for comparison ( thin histograms ) , where the estimated plasma frequency , i.e. , also the axion rest mass , is @xmath217mev / c@xmath1 .",
    "the uncertainty is a factor of @xmath22 , since the density changes by factor of @xmath24 between the @xmath2300 km and @xmath21000 km depth .",
    "note the strong deviations of the indirectly derived spectra ( grey lines ) in the past @xcite of the non - flaring quiet sun at solar minimum and that of the active sun at solar maximum below @xmath16kev ( sphinx measurements ) .",

    "the measurements were performed from 1992 to 2009 .",
    "the red line shows the * * b**@xmath1-dependence as a guide .",
    "it is not a fit to the ir intensity loss data .",
    "an example : intensity loss of 0.4 means that the number of ir photons is reduced by 40% ( with zero being the reference quiet sun value ) @xcite .",

    "we present observational evidence in favour of the solar axion scenario .",
