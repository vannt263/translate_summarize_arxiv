    "the four three - generation mass sectors of quarks and leptons belong to the deepest enigmas of the standard model of strong and electroweak interactions . while there is a great amount of experimental information of steadily increasing accuracy , theoretical models of mass matrices and mixing matrices are scarce . in this unsatisfactory situation",
    "it seems of utmost importance to parameterize the available data in such a way that possible textures in the mass matrices of a given charge sector become visible in an unambiguous manner .",
    "for instance , in the case of quarks , there are 10 data , viz .",
    "the masses of the three charge  @xmath2 quarks , the masses of the three charge  @xmath3 quarks , and four observables in the cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa ( ckm ) matrix , to be compared to 12 physically significant parameters in the mass matrices @xmath4 and @xmath5 .",
    "therefore , reconstructing mass matrices from the data really amounts to finding an optimal parameterization that exhibits the remaining two - parameter freedom in a transparent way .",
    "an important step in this direction was taken by branco et al . who realized that the class of so - called nearest - neighbour - interaction ( nni)-bases for chiral states are economical but still completely general @xcite , and",
    "may hence be used in attempts to reconstruct the mass matrices from the observed mass eigenvalues and the empirical mixing matrices .",
    "these authors also gave an explicit procedure for constructing mass matrices in an nni basis , for arbitrary mass sectors of quarks .",
    "unfortunately , their analysis involves solving cubic equations . although soluble in principle , these equations are too cumbersome to solve and do not allow for a practical and efficient reconstruction .    in this paper",
    "we propose a new method of reconstruction that avoids these shortcomings .",
    "we conjecture that this method and the appropriate parameterization are optimal in the sense of concentrating the remaining freedom in a single complex parameter whose domain of variation can be restricted to the interior of a circle in the complex plane . in particular , we succeed in reconstructing the mass matrices proper , up to unobservable changes of basis .",
    "this goes beyond , say , the work of harayama and okamura @xcite who express the ckm  matrix in terms of six parameters , with a two - parameter freedom .",
    "the way from their result to the mass matrices seems involved and not well suited for a practical analysis .",
    "we make use of the polar decomposition theorem for nonsingular matrices @xcite @xmath6 where @xmath7 is a lower - triangular matrix and @xmath8 is a unitary matrix which , when applying this formula to three generations of chiral quarks , can be absorbed in the right - chiral fields . if , in addition , we work in the class of nni bases in which the @xmath9-element of @xmath7 is seen to vanish , we still cover the most general case but get rid of all redundant quantities . more precisely , if @xmath10 are the `` squared '' hermitean mass matrices and @xmath11 with @xmath12 or @xmath13 etc .",
    "their diagonal forms , then , in any nni basis , @xmath14 the matrix @xmath15 which is known analytically @xcite , depends on two complex parameters , say @xmath16 and @xmath17 defined in eq .",
    "( [ newvar ] ) below .",
    "these parameters are related through a _ quadratic _",
    "equation whose coefficients are elements of the matrix @xmath18 i.e. of a matrix that is obtained solely from experimental data !",
    "solving for one or the other of them , say @xmath19 , reduces the set of admissible mass matrices to the expected two - parameter freedom in the variable @xmath16 .",
    "progress achieved in this way is twofold : on the one hand , parameterization in terms of , say , @xmath16 is analytically simple and transparent . on the other hand , the domain of variation of @xmath16 and the formulae for the elements of @xmath20 and @xmath21 are such that the space of admissible mass matrices can be studied graphically and numerically , as @xmath16 sweeps through all allowed values , in a quantitatively reliable manner .",
    "although we have not done this yet , one can even follow the propagation of the error bars of the experimental input , in not too involved a procedure .",
    "the paper is organised as follows : in sect .  2 we review the choice of nni bases and recapitulate the relevance of the polar decomposition theorem for the problem at stake .",
    "3 which is the main body of our work , describes the explicit construction of the matrix @xmath15 as well as its parameterization in terms of @xmath16 , @xmath17 , and the squared masses of the _",
    "_ up-__sector .",
    "the nni condition is encoded in the quadratic equation ( [ constr ] ) below . in sect .",
    "4 we discuss symmetries helpful in solving that constraint , and consider some limiting cases in order to illustrate the method .",
    "we also propose an expansion of the solutions in terms of a parameter which , due to the hierarchy in the quark masses , is numerically very small . the final sect .",
    "5 gives two examples of how a conjectured texture of mass matrices can be checked against the data in a simple and transparent manner , by converting the mass matrices to the ( general ) form studied here .",
    "it ends with a few conclusions .",
    "in the case of three generations the mass matrices @xmath22 and @xmath23 in the so called _ nearest neighbour interaction _ ( nni ) basis are characterized by the following generic structure , @xmath24 here the `` @xmath25''-entries appearing on the r.h.s . of ( [ nnistructure ] )",
    "are arbitrary non - vanishing , complex numbers .",
    "the interpretation of this particular choice of the mass matrices that is usually given by its proponents is the following : the @xmath26- and @xmath27-elements are put equal to zero , while letting the @xmath28-element be different from zero , with the idea of describing an initial , no - interaction situation where two quarks are massless and only one is massive .",
    "furthermore , only neighbouring generations are allowed to interact , by assuming nonvanishing @xmath29- , @xmath9- , @xmath30- , and @xmath31-elements , but vanishing @xmath32- and @xmath33-elements .",
    "however , it has been known for a long time that this setting , although very tempting and intuitive at first sight , is ill - defined unless it is supplemented by further assumptions .",
    "indeed , branco , lavoura , and mota showed in @xcite that any set of admissible mass matrices @xmath34 of the standard model , i.e. any set of two _ completely arbitrary _ non - singular @xmath35-matrices , can be transformed to the form given in ( [ nnistructure ] ) without the need for any further assumption .",
    "in other words , in the framework of the minimal standard model where only left - chiral fermion fields participate in charged current weak interactions , the mass matrices in ( [ nnistructure ] ) are still completely general , the specific form ( [ nnistructure ] ) reflecting no more than a specific choice of chiral basis .",
    "this fact is mainly due to the observation that weak interactions of quarks remain unchanged under the simultaneous transformations @xmath36 of the mass matrices , where @xmath37 and @xmath38 are arbitrary unitary @xmath39-matrices : on the one hand , the unitaries @xmath40 and @xmath38 act on the right - chiral fields @xmath41 and @xmath42 , respectively , and , hence , can be absorbed by a redefinition of these unobservable fields , without loss of generality . on the other hand , the common unitary matrix @xmath15 in ( [ masstrans ] ) which acts on the left - chiral quark fields , drops out when calculating the physical cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa ( ckm ) matrix @xmath43 in ( [ vckmdef ] ) @xmath44 and @xmath45 are the unitary matrices which diagonalize the `` squared '' , hermitean mass matrices @xmath46 of the up- and down - sector , respectively , viz .",
    "@xmath47 thus , as proved in @xcite , the structure ( [ nnistructure ] ) of the mass matrices corresponds to no more than a special , physically admissible choice of the electroweak basis .",
    "the interpretation sketched above fully rests on this choice and will no longer be valid in other electroweak bases . unless this special choice is singled out by additional arguments that could stem , e.g. , from physics beyond the standard model",
    ", the above interpretation loses its physical significance because _ physics _",
    ", of course , _ must not depend on the choice of basis_. + there is an alternative derivation of the same conclusion which , at the same time , helps us to fix notations for our subsequent calculations .",
    "as was shown in @xcite , @xcite , when dealing with questions of reconstructing mass matrices from the experimental data , i.e. from four independent absolute values of ckm matrix elements and the six quark masses , a most economic but nevertheless physically completely general parameterization of the quark mass matrices is given by _ triangular mass matrices _",
    ", @xmath48 this parameterization results upon exploiting the polar decomposition theorem for non - singular , but otherwise arbitrary matrices : @xmath49 again , the unitaries @xmath50 , @xmath51 , can be absorbed by a redefinition of the right - chiral quark fields , without loss of generality .",
    "+ at the level of the squared mass matrices @xmath52 the nni structure ( [ nnistructure ] ) of the mass matrices is equivalent to a vanishing @xmath29-element ( and  because @xmath52 is hermitean  also a vanishing @xmath9-element ) : @xmath53 because of @xmath54 , @xmath51 , a straightforward calculation shows that within the triangular parameterization the nni condition ( [ nnicond ] ) reads @xmath55 mimicking for a moment the ( invalid ) interpretation mentioned in connection with the nni structure ( [ nnistructure ] ) , eq .",
    "( [ nnicondtri ] ) would suggest that there is _ no _ direct interaction between the first and the second generation while , in the basis ( [ nnistructure ] ) , these evidently do mix , and , in fact , mix strongly .",
    "direct interactions seem to be present between the second and third generations as well as between the first and third generations only , due to the non - vanishing @xmath31- and @xmath33-elements of @xmath56 , respectively , in contrast to ( [ nnistructure ] ) where seemingly there is no direct coupling between first and third generations .",
    "+ these statements underpin once more that such an interpretation is dependent on the electroweak basis chosen for the representation of the mass matrices and , hence , should better be avoided altogether .",
    "+ although it is unrelated to a specific physical picture of quark masses and mixings , bases that yield the nni form of the mass matrices turn out to be very useful in the process of reconstructing mass matrices from the observed quark mixings and masses .",
    "therefore , in what follows we shall make extensive use of this class of bases .",
    "that is to say , we start from triangular mass matrices whose @xmath9-elements are zero , viz .",
    "@xmath57    here and in the sequel the hat on the symbols refers to the choice of an nni basis .",
    "possible phases can be absorbed into the right - chiral fields and , hence , without loss of generality , the matrix elements @xmath58 and @xmath59 along the diagonals may be chosen to be real .",
    "in fact , also the phases @xmath60 and @xmath61 could be dropped by making use of the unitary matrix @xmath15 in ( [ masstrans ] ) thereby rendering @xmath62 real . in doing so , on the theoretical side",
    "we are left with 12 parameters , 5 from the up - sector and 7 from the down - sector .",
    "these have to be confronted with 10 experimental data , i.e. 6 quark masses + 4 real observables in the ckm matrix , leaving a freedom of two parameters .",
    "this is characteristic for an nni basis .",
    "the authors of @xcite give a detailed prescription for the construction of mass matrices in an nni basis , for arbitrary mass matrices : the main step consists in solving the eigenvalue problem @xmath63 for the matrix @xmath64 , where @xmath65 denotes an arbitrary complex number .",
    "note that @xmath65 reflects the two - parameter freedom within the class of nni matrices .",
    "once the second column @xmath66 of the unitary matrix @xmath15 , which transforms the arbitrary squared mass matrices ( [ squmat ] ) to nni form ( see ( [ masstrans ] ) ) is determined according to ( [ nnieigen ] ) , the first column @xmath67 is calculated by means of @xmath68 see @xcite .",
    "finally , the third column @xmath69 follows from the unitarity of @xmath15 .",
    "it is easily checked that ( [ nnieigen ] ) and ( [ firstco ] ) indeed imply @xmath70 for @xmath51 as required .",
    "+ however , the prescription just outlined is not very well suited when aiming at an _ explicit _ construction of all nni mass matrices .",
    "this is simply due to the fact that in the interesting case of three generations the eigenvalue problem ( [ nnieigen ] ) leads to a cubic equation .",
    "the solutions of this cubic equation are , of course , known in principle but the corresponding expressions are rather lengthy and involved and they complicate tremendously subsequent calculations . in this paper we propose a different procedure which will be seen to result in much simpler expressions .",
    "+ we start from the following observation @xcite : without loss of generality we may assume that the squared mass matrix of @xmath71-quarks is already diagonal , that is , in other words , that the mixing has been shifted entirely to the down - sector . indeed , this is achieved by exploiting once more the freedom contained in ( [ masstrans ] ) by choosing @xmath72 . with this choice",
    "we obtain ( using ( [ masstrans ] ) , ( [ vckmdef ] ) , and ( [ massdiag ] ) ) : @xmath73 thus , in what follows , by this redefinition , the experimental input will be coded in the form @xmath74 note that @xmath75 is _ completely _ fixed in terms of the experimental input , i.e. the three quark masses of the down - sector and four physically relevant parameters of the ckm matrix .",
    "let us comment on this point in more detail : because , in general , normed eigenvectors are only fixed up to arbitrary phase factors , instead of @xmath76 we can as well choose @xmath77 in the above reasoning , with @xmath78 a diagonal phase matrix , @xmath79 with this choice the second substitution in ( [ startpoint0 ] ) becomes : @xmath80 in the last line , @xmath81 again denotes a diagonal matrix containing only phase factors , @xmath82 and the diagonal character of @xmath83 has been used .",
    "( [ arg ] ) shows that we are allowed to choose _ any _ parameterization for @xmath84 that we would like to start with .",
    "the transition to any other parameterization of @xmath84 is easily accomplished by means of suitable choices of the phase matrices @xmath78 and @xmath81 . + next",
    ", we have to tackle the task of finding the unitary matrices @xmath15 which transform the squared mass matrices @xmath85 to nni form . postponing for a moment the analysis of the down - sector , the corresponding condition for @xmath15 in the up - sector simply reads @xmath86 in other words , at this stage @xmath15",
    "is given by those unitary matrices that diagonalise the most general squared mass matrix @xmath87 where @xmath62 is taken from ( [ trinni ] ) ( with @xmath88 , without loss of generality ) .",
    "this is the first condition for the matrix @xmath15 .",
    "an analytical expression for the matrix @xmath15 is obtained by restricting to the case @xmath89 the general solution of the problem of diagonalisation that we had obtained earlier in @xcite , viz . @xmath90 where the functions @xmath91 , @xmath92 , @xmath93 and the denominators @xmath94 are given by @xmath95 the diagonal phase matrix @xmath96",
    ", @xmath97 represents the freedom of multiplying each eigenvector of @xmath20 with an arbitrary phase factor , is made for the sake of convenience . ] . as we are aiming at _ all _ nni mass matrices this freedom",
    "must be taken into account .",
    "this will become clear also in a moment when we count the degrees of freedom explicitly .",
    "+ furthermore , from the comparison of the characteristic polynomials of @xmath98 and of @xmath99 the parameters @xmath100 and @xmath101 are fixed in terms of @xmath102 , @xmath103 and the squared quark masses of the up - sector by means of the relations : @xmath104 as a consequence , @xmath15 is a function of four real parameters ( and , of course , the masses of the up - quarks ) , @xmath105 see appendix  a for more details .",
    "+ next we turn to the down - sector . in order to guarantee the nni form in the down - sector , too , the unitary matrix @xmath15 , eq .  ( [ upre ] ) , has to fulfill one additional condition . with @xmath106 and setting @xmath107 and @xmath108 ,",
    "see ( [ startpoint ] ) , this condition reads @xmath109 this yields the second condition for the matrix @xmath15 .",
    "as this is an equation for complex numbers , two out of the four parameters @xmath110 and @xmath111 are fixed this way , leaving a freedom of two real parameters .",
    "this is characteristic for the nni form .",
    "please note that it is essential to take into account properly the freedom parametrized in @xmath96 , eq .",
    "( [ phase ] ) .",
    "had we missed the phase matrix @xmath96 , @xmath15 would have been completely determined by ( [ nnidown ] ) and only _ one _ special set of nni mass matrices would have resulted , contrary to our purpose of reconstructing _ all _ nni mass matrices .",
    "+ the parameterization of @xmath15 , eq .",
    "( [ upre ] ) , in terms of @xmath110 and @xmath111 is not suited for constructing the solutions of ( [ nnidown ] ) , simply because the resulting equation contains a complicated sum of cosines with arguments @xmath112 , @xmath111 , as well as their difference @xmath113 .",
    "the practical reconstruction in this framework would not be simpler than within the original proposal of branco , lavoura and mota .",
    "the situation changes decisively if we use a new parameterization of @xmath15 in terms of two complex numbers defined as follows must be excluded at this point .",
    "however , as we shall see below , this is no restriction : the case where @xmath16 tends to infinity , @xmath114 , is mapped , by a symmetry of the equations , to the point @xmath115 , cf .",

    "in fact , a straightforward calculation shows that @xmath15 , eq .  ( [ upre ] ) , when expressed in terms of the new variables @xmath16 and @xmath17 reads as follows : @xmath120    - \\displaystyle\\frac{(m_t^2 - m_u^2 ) |b|",

    "it is the second nni condition ( [ nnidown ] ) that imposes a constraint on them : in the new parameterization this condition takes the simple form of a _ quadratic _ equation , viz . @xmath122 depending on whether ( [ constr ] ) is solved for @xmath123 or for @xmath124 the complex parameter @xmath17 or the complex parameter @xmath16 remains free and , thus , we recover the two - parameter freedom of the nni reconstruction . + by means of the above formulae elementary calculations yield all parameters of the nni mass matrices in terms of @xmath16 and @xmath17 .",

    "the results derived in the previous section whose details are spelled out in appendix  b , are completely general and analytical in the sense that no approximations whatsoever have been made .",
    "furthermore , we conjecture that the parameterization and reduction to the complex parameter @xmath16 ( or , alternatively , the parameter @xmath17 ) described in the previous section is the best one can do in reconstructing mass matrices from their eigenvalues and the ckm observables . in this section",
    "we provide further support for this conjecture by giving some examples and by showing that it is possible to classify , in a procedure that is suitable for practical studies , the set of all mass matrices that are compatible with the given observables .    generally speaking , due to the use of a ( as we conjecture ) optimal parameterization the task of finding _ all _ mass matrices in nni form",
    "is reduced to the simple problem of solving a _ quadratic _",
    "equation , see ( [ constr ] ) . to begin with we note that the left - hand side of eq .",

    "the simultaneous substitution @xmath132 maps the circle with radius @xmath133 in the complex @xmath16-plane onto itself ( by relating antipodes ) , while in the complex @xmath17-plane every point of the circle @xmath134 is a fixed point . at the same time",
    ", this substitution means interchanging the first and second columns of @xmath15 , eq .",
    "( [ u ] ) . therefore ,",
    "if we restrict , e.g. , @xmath135 to the interior of the first circle , and calculate @xmath136 from ( [ constr ] ) as well as the mass matrices @xmath137 , then the solution pertaining to @xmath138 and the corresponding value of @xmath139 yields the mass matrices @xmath140 @xmath141 in particular , for unprimed and primed parameters of the triangular matrices this is equivalent to @xmath142 @xmath143 and likewise for the primed quantities : @xmath144 @xmath145 clearly , this symmetry simplifies greatly any practical analysis .    before turning to the general case",
    "we illustrate our formulae by a few special cases : + ( i ) if the parameter @xmath16 vanishes , @xmath115 , eq .  ( [ constr ] ) gives @xmath146 .",

    "also , the substitution ( [ subs ] ) shows that two more special cases can be obtained where one of the parameters is sent to infinity .",
    "we also remark in passing that , although unrealistic in the light of the data , one can easily study the even more degenerate case of @xmath16 and @xmath17 both going to zero , for instance via @xmath167 in the procedure proposed by branco et al .",

    "we now turn to the general case but keep in mind the actual values of the observables ( quark masses and ckm angles ) .",
    "we first notice that with @xmath170 @xmath171 the first ratio ( [ ratios ] ) is approximately 1 while the second is very small , @xmath172 it seems appropriate to expand our formulae in terms of @xmath173 .",
    "so , for a given value of @xmath16 , the two solutions @xmath174 of the quadratic equation ( [ constr ] ) are given by @xmath175 whether or not this is a good approximation , in principle , depends on the range of @xmath16 and on the matrix elements @xmath176 , hence on the experimental input . in order to estimate its quality it is useful to compare the product and the sum of the two approximate solutions to the product and the sum of the _ exact _ solutions of the quadratic equation ( [ constr ] ) .",
    "thus , denoting the above approximations by @xmath177 , the exact solutions by @xmath178 , we define @xmath179 if the data are such that @xmath180 and @xmath181 are small , and using the fact that the ratio @xmath182 is proportional to @xmath128 , estimates for the approximate solutions are seen to be the following @xmath183 in practice , i.e. for realistic values of the experimental input , the quantities ( [ deltas ] ) , as well as the modulus of the ratio @xmath182 are very small .",
    "indeed , with the masses ( [ up_masses ] ) , ( [ down_masses ] ) , and with the following data for the moduli of the ckm matrix elements @xcite , ( assuming a positive value of the cp - invariant @xmath184 ) @xmath185 the elements of the hermitean matrix @xmath186 are found to be @xmath187 @xmath188 @xmath189 the quantity @xmath180 is easily seen to be @xmath190 as the numerical values of the elements of @xmath21 are such that @xmath191 this function is regular over the interior of the circle with radius @xmath133 and may thus be estimated by means of standard techniques of function theory .",

    "( [ dels_est ] ) is the dominant uncertainty .",
    "thus , in this framework the expressions ( [ b1_approx ] ) and ( [ b2_approx ] ) are excellent approximations in the interior of the circle with radius @xmath196 except in a small neighbourhood of the two poles of @xmath197 , eq .",
    "( [ b1_approx ] ) .",
    "note that the approximations are continuous in the parameter @xmath16 which is to say that the reconstructed mass matrices @xmath20 and @xmath21 depend on the remaining freedom in a continuous manner .",
    "this is particularly relevant when studying the dependence of the mass matrices on the parameter @xmath16 and when comparing to textures obtained from specific physical assumptions .",
    "we illustrate the method by means of two examples in figs .  1 and 2 .",

    "comparing this to @xmath204 we see that @xmath205 thus , by eqs .",
    "( [ mod_a ] ) , ( [ mod_b ] ) the moduli of @xmath16 and @xmath17 are fixed and the constraint ( [ constr ] ) is reduced to an equation for the pase factors @xmath206 and @xmath207 .",
    "it is then easy to decide whether or not this equation has a solution and , thereby , whether or not the ansatz of the model is compatible with the data .",
    "the second example @xcite makes again use of an nni basis but now constrains the @xmath150-sector further by assuming @xmath208 like in the previous example the remaining freedom is reduced to two phase factors which must obey the constraint ( [ constr ] ) . as the latter contains the input data , i.e. quark masses and ckm mixing angles , it is not clear a priori that the model is admissible .",
    "we note in passing that according to @xcite both models , within the experimental error bars , can indeed be used to parameterize the data .",
    "this is checked in our framework by confirming that eq .",
    "( [ constr ] ) has solutions of modulus 1 .",
    "the point we wish to make by quoting these examples is the following : while in general it is difficult to test the compatibility of a specific model ansatz with the data ( wihin their experimental error bars ) , the model may always be transformed to an nni - basis . by converting it to our general form in terms of the parameters @xmath16 and @xmath17 , its test in the light of the data is reduced to checking the simple quadratic equation ( [ constr ] ) .",
    "+ in summary , we found a new parameterization of squared mass matrices in terms of the experimental input ( eigenvalues and mixing observables ) and one complex parameter that allows to sample the space of solutions in an analytical and transparent manner .",
    "indeed , from the input : quark masses , matrix elements @xmath176 as obtained from the ckm data , eq .",
    "( [ startpoint ] ) , and a choice of @xmath16 ( from which @xmath209 is obtained via ( [ constr ] ) , or vice versa ) , the equations given in appendix  b directly yield the mass matrices ( [ trinni ] ) .",
    "thus , by varying the parameter @xmath16 over the circle with radius @xmath196 in the complex plane , and using the symmetry ( [ subs ] ) we scan the space of all admissible mass matrices , up to unobservable changes of basis .",
    "we conjecture that this procedure of reconstructing all mass matrices which are compatible with the data up to ( unobservable ) changes of bases , is optimal .",
    "we obtained this result by combining the idea of using general nni - bases @xcite with the polar decomposition theorem that allows to restrict the general analysis to triangular matrices @xcite , @xcite .",
    "the formulae that we obtained are sufficiently simple to handle so that they may be implemented in a reconstruction routine that also takes account of the experimental error bars .",
    "alternatively , as demonstrated by the examples we gave , our method allows for a quick test of compatibility with the data for any assumed texture in the mass matrices .    finally , with our knowledge of neutrino oscillations and of the corresponding mixing matrix increasing , it will eventually be possible to perform the analogous analysis of the leptonic mass matrices in the standard model .",
    "this appendix gives some intermediate results which are skipped in the main text of section  iii .",
