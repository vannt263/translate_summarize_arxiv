    "two outstanding mysteries in particle theory are the cause of electroweak symmetry breaking and the origin of flavor symmetry breaking by which the quarks and leptons obtain their diverse masses .",
    "the standard model of particle physics , based on the gauge group @xmath0 accommodates both symmetry breakings by including a fundamental weak doublet of scalar ( `` higgs '' ) bosons @xmath1 with potential function @xmath2 .",
    "however the standard model provides no explanation of the dynamics responsible for the generation of mass .",
    "furthermore , the scalar sector suffers from two serious problems .",
    "the scalar mass is unnaturally sensitive to the presence of physics at any higher scale @xmath3 ( e.g. the planck scale or a grand - unification scale ) :    this is known as the gauge hierarchy problem .",
    "in addition , if the scalar must provide a good description of physics up to arbitrarily high scale ( i.e. , be fundamental , not composite ) , the scalar s self - coupling ( @xmath4 ) is driven to zero    at finite energy scales .",
    "that is , the scalar field theory is free ( or `` trivial '' )",
    ". then the scalar can not fill its intended role : if @xmath5 , the electroweak symmetry is not spontaneously broken .",
    "it is , thus , necessary to seek the origin of mass in physics that lies beyond the standard model .",
    "one intriguing possibility is to introduce supersymmetry @xcite .",
    "the gauge structure of the minimal supersymmetric version of the standard model ( mssm ) is identical to that of the standard model , but each ordinary fermion ( boson ) is paired with a new boson ( fermion ) called its `` superpartner '' and two higgs doublets are needed to provide mass to all the ordinary fermions .",
    "each loop of ordinary particles contributing to the higgs boson s mass is now countered by a loop of superpartners .",
    "if the masses of the ordinary    particles and superpartners are sufficiently close , the gauge hierarchy can be stabilized @xcite .",
    "in addition , supersymmetry relates the scalar self - coupling to gauge couplings , so that triviality is not a concern .",
    "another interesting class of models involve dynamical electroweak symmetry breaking@xcite . in these theories ,",
    "a new strong gauge interaction with @xmath6 ( e.g technicolor ) breaks the chiral symmetries of a set of massless fermions @xmath7 at a scale @xmath8tev .",
    "if the fermions carry appropriate electroweak quantum numbers , the resulting condensate @xmath9 breaks the electroweak symmetry as desired .",
    "the logarithmic running of the strong gauge coupling renders the low value of the electroweak scale ( i.e. the gauge hierarchy ) natural .",
    "the absence of fundamental scalar bosons obviates concerns about triviality .    how is one to choose among the various models ?",
    "consider a rough graph of the masses of the known fermions and gauge bosons :    = = = = = = .5cme 1.27 cm w z .67 cm t +   +   +    the top quark is singled out@xcite : it is the heaviest known elementary particle , with a mass of order the electroweak scale , @xmath10gev , and is far heavier than its weak partner ( @xmath11 ) .",
    "this suggests that the top quark may afford us insight about existing models of electroweak physics and may even play a special role in electroweak and flavor symmetry breaking .",
    "the large mass of the top quark has illuminated aspects of existing theories of electroweak and flavor physics .",
    "we review some opportunities and constraints the top quark has provided for supersymmetric models and theories of dynamical electroweak symmetry breaking .",
    "a challenge for supersymmetric models is to explain why the higgs scalar develops a negative mass - squared ( so that the electroweak symmetry breaks ) while the scalar partners of the ordinary fermions do not ( so that color and electromagnetism are preserved ) .",
    "the heavy top quark provides a solution .    in many types of models (",
    "e.g. the constrained mssm ( cmssm ) , models of dynamical supersymmetry breaking ) the mass - squared of the higgs is related to that of the sfermions , and is therefore positive at scales ( @xmath12 ) well above the weak scale@xcite @xmath13 moving towards lower scales , the masses of the higgs ( @xmath14 ) and of the top squarks ( @xmath15 ) evolve under the renormalization group@xcite : @xmath16 clearly , the top quark s large yukawa coupling @xmath17 is important and the mass - squared of the higgs @xmath18 is affected more than that of the squarks . the approximate solution for the light higgs mass - squared at scale @xmath19 is @xmath20 for a top quark mass @xmath21 gev , the higgs mass - squared is driven negative near the electroweak scale @xcite , while those of the squarks are not . as desired , the electroweak symmetry breaks while color and electromagnetism survive .",
    "after electroweak symmetry breaking , the higgs spectrum of the mssm includes two neutral scalar bosons .",
    "the tree - level upper bound on the mass of the lighter one ( @xmath18 ) is @xmath22 .",
    "this would appear to forbid @xmath23 and lies quite close to the experimental lower bound on @xmath24 .",
    "radiative corrections involving the heavy top quark and its superpartners provide a resolution . for @xmath25 ,",
    "the bound on @xmath14 becomes @xcite @xmath26 so that @xmath27 gev and @xmath23 ( the @xmath28 symmetric limit @xcite or `` light gaugino - higgsino window '' @xcite ) is still viable",
    ".      extended technicolor ( etc ) is an explicit realization of dynamical electroweak symmetry breaking and fermion mass generation .",
    "one starts with a strong gauge group ( technicolor ) felt only by a set of new massless fermions ( technifermions ) and extends the technicolor gauge group to a larger ( etc ) group under which ordinary fermions are also charged . at a scale @xmath29 ,",
    "etc breaks to its technicolor subgroup and the gauge bosons coupling ordinary fermions to technifermions acquire a mass of order @xmath29 . at a scale @xmath30",
    "the technicolor coupling becomes strong enough to form a technifermion condensate and break the electroweak symmetry . because the massive etc gauge bosons couple the ordinary fermions to the condensate , the ordinary fermions acquire mass too .",
    "the top quark s mass , e.g. , comes from        and its size is @xmath31 @xmath32 .",
    "thus the scale @xmath29 must satisfy @xmath33 tev in order to produce @xmath34 gev .",
    "several difficulties arise when one tries to balance the need to create a wide range of ordinary fermion masses against the requirement of keeping the oblique correction @xmath35 small .",
    "first are the so - called `` direct '' contributions@xcite to @xmath35 .",
    "the etc sector must violate weak isospin in order to make @xmath36 .",
    "this can induce dangerous technifermion ( @xmath37 ) contributions to @xmath35 : .5 cm @xmath38 to satisfy the experimental constraint @xmath39 , one might consider making the etc boson heavy .",
    "this requires @xmath40 , which is too heavy to produce @xmath21gev .",
    "a better alternative@xcite is to arrange for separate dynamical sectors to break the electroweak symmetry and produce the bulk of @xmath41 .",
    "then the technifermions contributing to @xmath35 can satisfy @xmath42gev .",
    "there are also `` indirect '' contributions@xcite to @xmath35 from isospin- violating .1 cm @xmath43 at low energies @xmath44 .",
    "however the @xmath45 and @xmath11 quarks must feel some additional strong interaction not shared by the light fermions or technifermions , which can generate @xmath46 as sketched in figure [ figyy ] .",
    "we will revisit these ideas later .      while the contributions to @xmath35 just discussed are physically distinct from generation of @xmath41 , the very etc boson responsible for @xmath41 makes potentially large contributions to @xmath48 .",
    "consider the simplest etc models , those in which the etc and weak gauge groups commute and the etc bosons carry no weak charge .",
    "the etc boson responsible for generating the top quark mass couples to the current @xmath49 where @xmath50 is an etc clebsch , @xmath51 , and @xmath52 is a technifermion doublet .",
    "the top quark mass comes from        and is of order @xmath53 .",
    "this implies @xcite that the size of the typical vertex correction arising from exchange of this etc boson is proportional to the top mass : @xmath54 .    in particular ,",
    "this etc boson causes a radiative correction to the @xmath47 vertex .1 cm @xmath55",
    "we next consider whether the top quark s large mass implies that the @xmath45 quark has unique new interactions .",
    "such scenarios provide alternative mechanisms of electroweak and flavor symmetry breaking and are experimentally testable .",
    "to start , we return to extended technicolor .",
    "our discussion of @xmath48 did not rule out the possibility of `` non - commuting '' models in which @xmath56 is embedded in @xmath57 so that the etc bosons carry weak charge .",
    "to build such a model , one must balance the requirements of providing a range of quark masses against the need to ensure that the weak interactions are universal at low energies .",
    "as discussed in @xcite , this leads to separate weak interactions for the 3rd generation fermions ( @xmath58 ) and the light fermions ( @xmath59 ) and the symmetry - breaking pattern @xmath60 the result is a model where the top quark has non - standard weak interactions .",
    "our first concern is the value of @xmath48 this model predicts .",
    "the etc boson .1 cm @xmath61 not make @xmath48 compatible with experiment .",
    "but in addition , mixing of the @xmath62 .1 cm @xmath63 non - standard top quark weak interactions may be detectable in single top - quark production at tev33 @xcite .",
    "the ratio of cross - sections @xmath64 can be measured ( and calculated ) to an accuracy @xcite of at least @xmath65 .",
    "a non - commuting etc model might alter @xmath66 in several ways .",
    "mixing of the two @xmath67 bosons alters the light @xmath67",
    "s couplings to the final state fermions .",
    "exchange of both heavy and light @xmath67 bosons contributes to the cross - sections .",
    "but exchange of the etc boson that generates @xmath41 does * not * modify the @xmath68 vertex , because the boson does not couple to all of the required fermions : ( @xmath69 ) . in the case of @xmath48 ,",
    "the vertex and boson mixing effects canceled , leaving @xmath48 at the standard model value ; here the boson mixing effects are not canceled and can yield a visible * increase * in @xmath66 ( see figure [ figxx ] ) .      to build a dynamical symmetry breaking model that provides both electroweak symmetry breaking and a large @xmath41 ,",
    "it has been suggested @xcite that all or some of electroweak symmetry breaking could be caused by a top quark condensate ( @xmath70 ) .",
    "one way to implement this is to start with a spontaneously broken strong gauge interaction that distinguishes top from the other quarks .",
    "suppose the model includes an @xmath71 for the @xmath45 ( and @xmath11 ) and an @xmath72 for the other quarks which break to their diagonal subgroup ( identified with @xmath73 at a scale @xmath29 .",
    "at energies below @xmath29 , exchange of the heavy gauge bosons yields a new four - fermion interaction can cause top quark condensation . @xmath74",
    "the simplest `` topcolor - assisted technicolor '' model@xcite incorporating top condensates has the following gauge group and symmetry - breaking pattern .",
    "@xmath75 the groups @xmath76 and @xmath56 are ordinary technicolor and weak interactions ; the strong and hypercharge groups labeled `` h '' couple to 3rd - generation fermions and have stronger couplings than the `` l '' groups coupling to light fermions the separate @xmath77 groups ensure that the bottom quark will not condense when the top quark does .",
    "below the scale @xmath29 , the lagrangian includes effective interactions for @xmath45 and @xmath11 : @xmath78 ^ 2   -{{4\\pi \\kappa_1}\\over{m^2 } } \\left[{1\\over3}\\overline{\\psi_l}\\gamma_\\mu    \\psi_l + { 4\\over3}\\overline{t_r}\\gamma_\\mu   t_r -{2\\over3}\\overline{b_r}\\gamma_\\mu   b_r \\right]^2\\ ] ] so long as the following relationship is satisfied ( where the critical value is @xmath79 in the njl approximation @xcite ) @xmath80 only the top quark will condense and become very massive@xcite .",
    "topcolor - assisted technicolor models have several appealing features@xcite@xcite .",
    "technicolor causes most of the electroweak symmetry breaking , with the top condensate contributing a decay constant @xmath81 gev ; this prevents @xmath35 from being too large , as mentioned earlier .",
    "so long as the @xmath82 charges of the technifermions are isospin - symmetric , they cause no additional large contributions to @xmath35 .",
    "etc dynamics at a scale @xmath83tev generates the light fermion masses and contributes about a gev to the heavy fermions masses ; this does not generate large corrections to @xmath48 .",
    "the top condensate can , then , provide the bulk of the top quark mass .",
    "precision electroweak data constrain the mass of the extra @xmath62 boson in these models to weigh at least 1 - 2 tev @xcite .      finally , we return to supersymmetric models .",
    "consider the mass matrix for the supersymmetric partners of the top quark :    _ t ^2 =    the presence of @xmath41 in the off - diagonal entries shows that a large top quark mass can drive one of the top squarks to be quite light . if the top squark is light enough ( which experiment allows @xcite ) the decay @xmath84 becomes possible ; that is , the top quark may be the only quark able to decay to its own superpartner .",
    "this idea can be tested in top quark production experiments .",
    "the simplest test is to see whether the measured top mass and cross - section match , since the latter depends on how the top is assumed to decay .",
    "cdf and do data indicate that assuming the top decays only through the standard channel @xmath85 gives a good fit to the data @xcite . if additional decay channels for the top existed , the production cross - section measured in the @xmath86 final states would be lower than the standard model prediction .",
    "however , this effect could be balanced @xcite in supersymmetric models either by production of states that decay to top quarks @xmath87 or by production of states whose decays mimic those of top quarks @xmath88 .",
    "checking these possibilities would require seeking , specific signatures of the presence of supersymmetric particles ; for instance , while qcd produces mainly top anti - top pairs , gluino pair production with subsequent decay to top quarks and squarks also produces top / top and anti - top / anti - top pairs in the ratio [ @xmath89 .",
    "the top quark s large mass singles it out in several ways",
    ". it may play a special role in electroweak symmetry breaking ( through its effects on rg running in supersymmetric models or through formation of top quark condensates ) .",
    "it has potentially large effects on precision electroweak observables like @xmath35 or @xmath48 . in some cases",
    "it has a strong influence on the masses of other particles such as higgs bosons or superpartners .",
    "finally , the top quark may be subject to non - standard interactions that distinguish it from the up and charm quarks .    as a result",
    ", the top quark has already made a difference in our attempts to understand electroweak and flavor physics .",
    "is the top quark actually different in any of the ways outlined here ?",
