    "transverse single - spin and azimuthal asymmetries in high - energy hadronic reactions have raised a lot of interest in the last years ( see e.g.  ref .",
    "@xcite and references therein ) .",
    "in particular , the huge spin asymmetries measured in the inclusive forward production of pions in high - energy proton - proton collisions , at moderately large transverse momentum , can not be explained in the realm of leading - twist ( lt ) perturbative qcd ( pqcd ) , based on the usual collinear factorization theorems . out of the theoretical approaches proposed in order to account for these measurements , in the following we will adopt the so - called transverse momentum dependent ( tmd ) formalism , which takes into account spin and intrinsic parton motion effects assuming a pqcd factorization scheme .",
    "in this framework , single - spin and azimuthal asymmetries are generated by tmd polarized partonic distribution and fragmentation functions , among which the most relevant from a phenomenological point of view are the sivers distribution  @xcite and , for transversely polarized quarks , the boer - mulders distribution  @xcite and the collins fragmentation function  @xcite ( similar functions can be defined for linearly polarized gluons , see e.g.  ref .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "azimuthal asymmetries in the distribution of pions inside a large transverse momentum jet are quite interesting observables  @xcite and are presently under active investigation at the relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) .",
    "in contrast to inclusive pion production , where several underlying competing mechanisms ( mainly the sivers and collins ones ) can not be separated , and in close analogy with the semi - inclusive deep inelastic scattering ( sidis ) case , one could discriminate among different effects by taking suitable moments of these asymmetries . in principle ,",
    "quark and gluon originating jets can also be distinguished , at least in some kinematic regimes .",
    "furthermore , information on the size of tmd distributions and fragmentation functions can be gained , in a kinematic region in which they are still poorly known .",
    "this would be very helpful in clarifying the role played by the quark(gluon ) sivers distribution and by the collins(-like ) fragmentation function in the sizable single spin asymmetries observed at rhic for single inclusive pion production . a similar analysis where transverse partonic motion was considered only in the fragmentation process , aimed at a study of the universality of the collins function for quarks ,",
    "was presented in ref .",
    "@xcite . our approach , named generalized parton model ( gpm ) , has in principle a richer structure in the observable azimuthal asymmetries , because intrinsic motion is taken into account in the initial hadrons as well .",
    "preliminary data from the star collaboration at rhic seem to support our model , since they report on a sivers asymmetry for neutral pions larger than zero @xcite and compatible with our predictions .",
    "however , since factorization has not been proven in this case , but is rather taken as a reasonable phenomenological assumption , the validity of the scheme and the universality of the tmd distributions involved require a severe scrutiny by further comparison with experiments .",
    "we consider the process @xmath1 , with one of the protons in a transverse spin state described by the four - vector @xmath2 .",
    "we work in the @xmath3 c.m .",
    "frame , where the polarized proton moves along the @xmath4 direction , and define @xmath5 as the production plane containing the colliding beams and the observed jet , with @xmath6 . in this frame @xmath7 and @xmath8 , where @xmath9 $ ] is the jet ( pseudo)rapidity .",
    "we denote by @xmath10 and @xmath11 respectively the light - cone momentum fraction and the transverse momentum of the observed pion inside the jet w.r.t .   the jet ( fragmenting parton ) direction of motion .",
    "calculations have been performed within the gpm framework at leading - order ( lo ) in pqcd utilizing the helicity formalism .",
    "more details can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the final expression for the single - transverse polarized cross section has the following general structure : @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the azimuthal angle of the pion three - momentum around the jet axis , as measured in the fragmenting parton helicity frame @xcite . in close analogy with the sidis case , in order to single out the different contributions of interest , we can define appropriate azimuthal moments , @xmath14 } { \\int{\\rm d}\\phi_{s}{\\rm d}\\phi_\\pi^h\\ , [ { \\rm d}\\sigma(\\phi_{s},\\phi_\\pi^h)+ { \\rm d}\\sigma(\\phi_{s}+\\pi,\\phi_\\pi^h)]}\\ , , \\label{gen - mom}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath15 is some appropriate circular function of @xmath16 and @xmath13 .",
    "in this section we present and discuss some phenomenological implications of our approach in kinematic configurations accessible at rhic by the star and phenix experiments .",
    "we consider both central ( @xmath17 ) and forward ( @xmath18 ) ( pseudo)rapidity configurations at a c.m .",
    "energy @xmath19 200 gev ( different c.m .",
    "energies , namely @xmath20 and 500 gev , are also studied in @xcite ) .    for numerical calculations",
    "all tmd distribution and fragmentation functions are taken in the simplified form where the functional dependence on the parton light - cone momentum fraction and on transverse motion are completely factorized , assuming a gaussian - like flavour - independent shape for the transverse momentum component . concerning the parameterizations of the transversity and quark sivers distributions , and of the collins functions , we consider two sets : sidis  1 @xcite and sidis  2 @xcite .",
    "furthermore , for the usual collinear distributions , we adopt the lo unpolarized set grv98  @xcite . for fragmentation functions , we adopt two well - known lo sets among those available in the literature , the set by kretzer  @xcite and the dss one  @xcite .",
    "our choice is dictated by the subsequent use of the two available parametrization sets for the sivers and collins functions in our scheme , that have been extracted in the past years by adopting these sets of fragmentation functions .",
    "since the range of the jet transverse momentum ( the hard scale ) covered is significant , we take into account proper evolution with scale . on the other hand ,",
    "the transverse momentum component of all tmd functions is kept fixed with no evolution with scale . in all cases considered , @xmath11 is integrated over and , since we are interested in leading particles inside the jet , we present results obtained integrating the light - cone momentum fraction of the observed hadron , @xmath10 , in the range @xmath21 .",
    "we have considered first , for @xmath22 production only , a scenario in which the effects of all tmd functions are over - maximized . by this",
    "we mean that all tmd functions are maximized in size by imposing natural positivity bounds .",
    "the transversity distribution has been fixed at the initial scale by saturating the soffer bound and then we let it evolve .",
    "moreover , the relative signs of all active partonic contributions are chosen so that they sum up additively . in this way we set an upper bound on the absolute value of any of the effects playing a potential role in the azimuthal asymmetries .",
    "therefore , all effects that are negligible or even marginal in this scenario may be directly discarded in subsequent refined phenomenological analyses .",
    "see ref .",

    "[ asy - an - coll - par200 ] we present , in the forward rapidity region , the quark generated asymmetry @xmath27 , which comes mainly from the convolution between the transversity distribution and the collins fragmentation function .",
    "the plots are obtained adopting the parameterizations sidis  1 and sidis  2 .",
    "the collins asymmetry for neutral pions results to be almost vanishing , in agreement with preliminary rhic data @xcite .",
    "the dotted black vertical line delimits the region @xmath25 , with @xmath28 , beyond which the sidis parameterizations for transversity are extrapolated outside the bjorken @xmath29 region covered by sidis data and are therefore plagued by large uncertainties . for this reason ,",
    "the two parameterizations for charged pions give comparable results only below this limit ( notice the difference in scale between the two panels ) .",
    "a measurement of such asymmetries would be then very important and helpful in clarifying the large @xmath29 behaviour of the quark transversity distribution .",
    "furthermore , it turns out that in the central rapidity region the quark collins asymmetries are practically negligible .    in fig .",
    "[ asy - an - siv - par200 ] we show , for both neutral and charged pions , the quark and gluon contributions to the sivers asymmetry @xmath30 , which can not be disentangled , in the forward rapidity region as a function of @xmath31 .",
    "the quark term is obtained adopting the sidis  1 and sidis  2 parameterizations .",
    "the almost unknown gluon sivers function is tentatively taken positive and saturated to an updated version of the bound obtained in ref .",
    "@xcite by considering phenix data for the @xmath32 transverse single spin asymmetry at mid - rapidity .",
    "similarly to the case of the collins asymmetry , the two parameterizations give comparable results only in the @xmath31 region where the behaviour of the quark sivers distribution is reasonable well constrained by sidis data ( see again the dotted black vertical line ) .",
    "in the gpm approach one applies the tmd distribution and fragmentation functions extracted from sidis , considering them to be universal .",
    "very recently @xcite the azimuthal distribution of leading pions inside jets has been studied allowing for process dependence of the ( quark ) sivers function .",
    "this is referred to as the colour gauge invariant ( cgi ) gpm @xcite .",
    "namely , we have taken into account the effects of initial ( isis ) and final state interactions ( fsis ) between the active parton and spectator remnants in the different scattering sub - processes .",
    "since the details of such interactions depend on the particular partonic reaction considered , they render the sivers function non - universal ( see @xcite and references therein ) . the oft - discussed case is the difference between the fsis in sidis and the isis in dy scattering which leads to the prediction of an opposite relative sign of the sivers functions in the two processes .",
    "this is considered to be a crucial test of our understanding of single spin asymmetries in qcd and still has to be confirmed by experiments .",
    "when applying similar reasoning to hadron production in @xmath3 collisions , typically the sivers function has a more complicated colour factor structure since both isis and fsis contribute .",
    "however , in the forward rapidity region the process under study is dominated by only one channel , @xmath33 , with the final quark identified with the observed jet . as a consequence",
    ", one finds that the predictions for the sivers asymmetries obtained with and without inclusion of color gauge factors are comparable in size but with _ opposite signs _ @xcite , similarly to the dy case .",
    "therefore the experimental observation of a sizable asymmetry could easily discriminate among the two approaches and test the universality properties of the sivers function in hadronic reactions .",
    "our results are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , where we plot @xmath34 as a function of the jet transverse momentum @xmath35 at @xmath18 , for the rhic energy @xmath36 gev , integrated over @xmath11 and @xmath10 ( @xmath37 ) .     for the @xmath38 process as a function of @xmath35 , at fixed jet rapidity @xmath18 , for the rhic energy @xmath36 gev.,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=35.0% ]   for the @xmath38 process as a function of @xmath35 , at fixed jet rapidity @xmath18 , for the rhic energy @xmath36 gev.,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=35.0% ]   for the @xmath38 process as a function of @xmath35 , at fixed jet rapidity @xmath18 , for the rhic energy @xmath36 gev.,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=35.0% ]    the predictions labeled sidis  1 and sidis  2 are similar in the intermediate @xmath39 gev region ( corresponding to @xmath40 ) .",
    "this region is then optimal to test directly the process dependence of the sivers function .",
    "note that for @xmath41 gev the behavior of our estimates would be similar to that shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , gaining almost a factor of 2 in size .",
    "however the range of @xmath35 covered would be narrower ( @xmath42  gev ) and with @xmath43 now corresponding to @xmath44  gev .    finally , as a natural extension of this analysis",
    ", one can consider single inclusive jet asymmetry in @xmath3 scattering , which is described solely by the sivers function .",
    "the results obtained for @xmath30 ( not shown ) look almost indistinguishable from the case of neutral pion - jet production ( central panel of fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) .",
    "we have presented a study of the azimuthal asymmetries measurable in the distribution of leading pions inside a large-@xmath0 jet produced in single - transverse polarized proton proton collisions for kinematic configurations accessible at rhic . to this end , we have adopted a generalized tmd parton model approach with inclusion of spin and intrinsic parton motion effects both in the distribution and in the fragmentation sectors .",
    "in contrast to inclusive pion production , where the sivers and collins mechanisms can not be separated , the leading - twist azimuthal asymmetries discussed above would allow one to single out the different effects by taking suitable moments of the asymmetries .",
