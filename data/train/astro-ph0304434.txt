    "since the work of @xcite and @xcite , it has been known that globular clusters in the milky way can be divided into ( at least ) two sub - populations with distinct kinematical and chemical properties .",
    "undoubtedly one of the most important developments in research on globular clusters ( gcs ) within the last decade is the discovery that similar substructure is seen in the color ( and hence , presumably , metallicity ) distributions of gc systems in many _ early - type _",
    "galaxies @xcite .",
    "there is increasing evidence that gc sub - populations in early - type galaxies share many properties with those in spirals @xcite , and that the gcs in different galaxy types may be closely related . characterizing and understanding the properties ( spatial and metallicity distributions , kinematics etc . ) of gc sub - populations is currently a subject of much investigation and holds the promise of revealing important information about events in the evolution of their host galaxies .",
    "one piece of the puzzle is to establish just how similar are gcs in different galaxies .",
    "the hubble space telescope can resolve the spatial profiles of globular clusters well beyond the local group , although careful modeling of the undersampled point spread function ( psf ) of the wfpc2 camera is necessary in order to derive reliable size information for typical extragalactic gcs .",
    "@xcite were among the first to measure the sizes of extragalactic gcs and found that gcs in the lenticular galaxy ngc  3115 had half - light radii of about 2 pc , similar to or perhaps slightly smaller than those in the milky way .",
    "when measuring sizes for the blue ( metal - poor ) and red ( metal - rich ) gc subpopulations separately , @xcite noted a size difference of about 20% with the red gcs being systematically smaller .",
    "a similar size difference was found between red and blue gcs in ngc  4486 @xcite .",
    "subsequently , size differences between gc subpopulations have been found in many other galaxies including ngc  4472 @xcite , ngc  4594 ( the  sombrero  ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , m31 @xcite and other early - type galaxies @xcite .",
    "however , it should also be noted that @xcite found _ no _ size - color relation for a sample of 27 gcs in ngc  5128 .",
    "although the results on ngc  5128 suggest that the size difference may not be _ universal _ , there seems to be compelling evidence that it is at least a wide - spread phenomenon , observed in spirals as well as in early - type galaxies .",
    "understanding the origin of this size difference is a high priority , since any intrinsic correlation between the sizes and metallicities of star clusters might hold clues to their formation mechanisms .",
    "however , before one attempts to explain the size difference in terms of e.g.  the properties of the proto - cluster clouds , variations in external pressure etc .",
    ", other more straight - forward explanations need to be ruled out .",
    "one possibility is that the observed size difference is a projection effect , resulting from a correlation between gc size ( @xmath1 ) and galactocentric distance ( @xmath2 ) combined with different radial distributions of the gc subpopulations ( throughout this paper , we will adopt the following convention : a small @xmath1 refers to the size ( radius ) of an individual globular cluster , while a capital @xmath2 refers to the distance of that cluster from the galaxy center .",
    "we will use subscripts ( @xmath3 , @xmath4 ) to specify projected and 3-d quantities ) .",
    "@xcite found that the size-@xmath2 relation in the milky way can be approximated by a square - root relation , @xmath5 , and they also noted that similar relations exist in m31 , ngc  5128 and the lmc .",
    "however , because of the limited spatial coverage of hst , little is known about size-@xmath2 trends in other more distant galaxies .",
    "concerning the wide - field spatial distributions of extragalactic gc systems , most of the available information comes from ground - based studies which generally provide the only way to obtain complete coverage at large radii .",
    "in addition to the milky way and m31 , galaxies where the radial distributions of gc sub - populations have been studied include ngc  1380 @xcite , ngc  1399 @xcite , ngc  4472 @xcite and ngc  4486 @xcite . in all of these cases , the red gc sub - population is more centrally concentrated than the blue one",
    ". therefore , red gcs observed at a given _ projected _ radius will on average be physically closer to the galaxy center than the blue ones . clearly , there is reason to suspect that projection effects might account for at least some of the differences in the mean sizes of gc samples .",
    "our goal in this paper is to investigate and quantify this idea in more detail .",
    "while size information is now available for many extragalactic gc systems , the spatial coverage is in most cases limited to a single wfpc2 pointing , usually centered on the galaxy .",
    "therefore , information about variations with galactocentric distance is limited .",
    "even with several pointings , the surface density of gcs drops off rapidly at large radii , and in all but the richest systems it is difficult to obtain reliable statistics based on the small number of clusters contained within an off - center wfpc2 field . in practice ,",
    "then , the number of suitable datasets that can serve as a basis for our analysis is limited . we have selected three well - studied galaxies with multiple hst / wfpc2 pointings and rich gc systems ( ngc  4472 , ngc  4486 and ngc  4594 ) .",
    "the wfpc2 data are the same as those used in @xcite and we refer to that paper for details about the data reduction .",
    "briefly , the globular cluster sizes were measured by convolving a series of analytic models with the wfpc2 psf , adjusting the fwhm of the model until the best match to the observed profile was obtained .",
    "for this purpose , we used the ishape code described in @xcite .",
    "the main systematic errors involved in this process are related to che choice of model psf and are difficult to quantify , but comparison of size measurements on different frames have indicated that this method yields fwhm values consistent to about 0.1 wf pixel for individual clusters @xcite .",
    "in addition , we include data for the milky way from @xcite and m31 ( size information kindly provided by p.  barmby ) .    as an illustration of the typical size differences between gc sub - populations , fig .",
    "[ fig : szdist ] shows the size distributions for gcs in each of the wfpc2 pointings for the three early - type galaxies .",
    "here we are not concerned with the absolute values of the gc sizes so for the hst data we simply use the fwhm of the cluster profiles , measured in pixels and corrected for the wfpc2 psf . to avoid any systematic differences due to the different pixel scales of the pc and wf chips , we only use sizes measured on the wf chips .",
    "we divide between `` red '' and `` blue '' clusters at @xmath6 , corresponding roughly to a metallicity of @xmath7}}\\sim-1 $ ] .",
    "table  [ tab : sztab ] lists the mean sizes of red and blue globular clusters in each of the wfpc2 fields , along with the probability @xmath8 ( from a kolmogorov - smirnoff test ) that the size distributions are drawn from the same parent distribution . for all of the _ central _ wfpc2 pointings ,",
    "table  [ tab : sztab ] and fig .",
    "[ fig : szdist ] confirm a significant difference between the size distributions of blue and red gcs ( @xmath9 ) , amounting to a difference of 1530% in the mean sizes .",
    "however , at larger radii the situation is less clear : while the red gcs are smaller than the blue gcs in all of the ngc  4486 pointings except ngc  4486-e , the difference is only significant in the three innermost ones . in ngc  4472",
    ", the two outer pointings ( b and c ) cover roughly the same radial range , but a size difference is seen in only one of them and is only significant at the @xmath1089% confidence level . in ngc  4594",
    ", only the central pointing has enough clusters to obtain useful information about size distributions . in this central pointing",
    "there is a @xmath11% difference between the mean sizes of red and blue gcs and the distributions are different at the 97% confidence level .",
    "the size distributions for milky way and m31 gcs are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : szdist_sp ] . in the milky way we have adopted a division at @xmath7}}=-1.0",
    "$ ] , while the classification of clusters in m31 as metal - poor or metal - rich was based on a variety of photometric and spectroscopic criteria @xcite .",
    "as previously noted @xcite , metal - rich and metal - poor gcs in the milky way and m31 display a size difference reminiscent of that observed in the early - type galaxies , but at least in the milky way it is likely that the difference is at least partly due to the different radial distributions of the two gc subpopulations .",
    "in @xcite we tried to reduce this problem by comparing clusters in smaller radial bins , but the modest number of gcs in the milky way limits the extent to which such sub - division is feasible . in sec .",
    "[ ssec : rev_mw ] below we return to this issue .",
    "before we proceed , we briefly discuss one other effect which could potentially affect the comparison of mean sizes for gc subpopulations . because the mass - to - light ratio of a single - aged stellar population ( such as a star cluster ) is a function of metallicity , the mass limit of a magnitude - limited sample of gcs is , in principle , also metallicity - dependent .",
    "thus , a size - mass relation could introduce spurious size differences between magnitude - limited samples of different metallicities .",
    "furthermore , age differences between gc sub - populations could also lead to different mass - to - light ratios .",
    "however , in the milky way there is a striking _ absence _ of any size - luminosity relation for gcs @xcite , and the same seems to be the case in early - type galaxies @xcite and even for young clusters in mergers @xcite .",
    "this suggests that the magnitude ( or mass ) limit of the sample is largely irrelevant when comparing cluster sizes .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : sz_mag ] we plot the size measurements for globular clusters in ngc  4472 , ngc  4486 and ngc  4594 as a function of their magnitude .",
    "the lines are least squares linear fits to the data , and they all have very small slopes that differ from 0 by less than @xmath12 .",
    "again , this suggests that the size difference can not be explained as a result of different m / l ratios of the gc sub - populations .",
    "we note in passing that this lack of a size - luminosity relation is a very interesting and puzzling result in its own right , with the obvious implication that the mean _ densities _ of stellar clusters are directly proportional to their masses .      in order to calculate the projected size distributions of gc sub - populations ,",
    "two basic ingredients are needed : 1 ) a relation between gc size and galactocentric distance , assumed to be _ the same _ for both ( or all ) gc subpopulations , and 2 ) density profiles , assumed to be _ different _ for each population .",
    "the size-@xmath2 relation is not easily constrained for extragalactic gc systems , partly because the gc sizes are close to the resolution limit of wfpc2 and small differences in telescope tracking , focusing etc .",
    "could introduce spurious effects when comparing measurements from different pointings .",
    "a more fundamental problem is that only the projected size-@xmath2 relations can be directly observed , while we need the run of gc size versus physical ( 3-d ) galactocentric distance . for the following discussion we will therefore start out by _ assuming _ a relation of the form @xmath13 i.e.  similar to",
    "that observed in the milky way , but note that we have allowed for addition of a constant term to the simple square - root law suggested by @xcite .",
    "we emphasize that we do not intend to imply any physical significance of this particular relation but simply use it as a convenient fitting function .",
    "note , also , that any intrinsic scatter in the relation ( which might depend on @xmath4 in non - trivial ways ) is ignored .",
    "[ fig : r_sz_mw ] shows @xmath14 versus @xmath4 for milky way gcs .",
    "the upper panel shows a least - squares fit of eq .",
    "( [ eq : r_r ] ) to all clusters with size information .",
    "the best fit is @xmath15 where @xmath14 is the effective ( half - light ) radius and we have normalized the relation to a scale radius of 3 kpc ( roughly the median galactocentric distance of the metal - rich gcs ) . of course , choosing a different scale radius is equivalent to changing the coefficient @xmath16 .",
    "the two lower panels show the metal - poor ( `` blue '' ) and metal - rich gcs separately . especially for the metal - rich gcs ,",
    "the slope of the size-@xmath2 relation is very poorly constrained , but to check whether any significant size differences exist between the two gc populations we adopt the same slope as for the combined sample and just fit the constant term . for the metal - poor and metal - rich gcs",
    "this term is @xmath17 pc and @xmath18 pc , respectively .",
    "formally , the constant term is now slightly larger for the _ metal - rich _ clusters , contrary to the trend seen in the projected size distributions , but the difference is not statistically significant . in practice ,",
    "then , there is no evidence for a significant size difference between the two milky way gc populations when the radial dependence is averaged out .",
    "we therefore conclude that the size difference in fig .",
    "[ fig : szdist_sp ] , at least for the milky way , can be fully explained as a result of the different radial distributions of the two gc subpopulations .",
    "while ground - based data offer superior coverage at large radii compared to most hst datasets , completeness issues are more severe near the center . however , in order to model the gc size distributions it is important to know the behavior of the spatial distributions of gcs near the center , as well as at larger distances .",
    "of the hst datasets used here , ngc  4486 has the best radial coverage , extending out to 9@xmath19 . in fig .",
    "[ fig : rp4486 ] we show the gc surface densities as a function of projected distance from the galaxy center ( in arcmin ) for the two gc subpopulations .",
    "it is evident that the red gcs are much more centrally concentrated .",
    "we have adopted a magnitude limit of @xmath20 , which is 1.5 mag brighter than the 50% completeness limit even in the central pointing @xcite , so we do not expect completeness effects to be significant except perhaps in the central 20@xmath2130@xmath21 .",
    "also superimposed on the plots are de vaucouleurs @xmath0 laws and @xcite profiles .",
    "for the king profiles we have arbitrarily fixed the concentration parameter at @xmath22 .",
    "the two best - fitting de vaucouleurs profiles have effective radii of @xmath23 ( red clusters ) and @xmath24 ( blue clusters ) , although these numbers are rather sensitive to the background correction .",
    "the two king profiles have effective radii of @xmath25 and @xmath26 , a much smaller difference than for the de vaucouleurs profiles , but note that our radial coverage only extends out to about 1/3 of the half - light radius of the de vaucouleurs fit to the blue gc distribution .    in the outer , poorly constrained regions ,",
    "the king profiles decline more rapidly than the @xmath0 law , resulting in the very different half - light radii for the two types of profiles .",
    "in fact , a fundamental difference between the king and de vaucouleurs profiles is that the former has a well - defined tidal radius , while the latter does not .",
    "however , our primary objective here is not to obtain a correct fit at very large galactocentric distances ( which contribute with only a few clusters in projection ) , but merely to find appropriate `` fitting functions '' that allow us to model the spatial distributions of gcs and deproject the observed surface densities to obtain estimates of 3-d space densities .",
    "[ fig : rp4486 ] suggests that the king profiles provide a fit that is at least as good as an @xmath0 law in the inner regions , and probably better .",
    "one remaining issue is to convert the observed surface density profiles to space densities , @xmath27 . for the de vaucouleurs profiles we use the series expansion tabulated by @xcite .",
    "for the king profiles , the space density is automatically obtained during the process of computing the king model .      near the center ,",
    "the king profiles flatten out whereas the de vaucouleurs profiles diverge .",
    "this difference in behavior has important implications for the projected properties of gc systems distributed according to either of the two profiles . to illustrate this point ,",
    "consider the mean 3-d distance @xmath28 of gcs observed at a given projected distance @xmath3 .",
    "these are related as @xmath29 where @xmath30 the upper integration limit , @xmath31 , should in principle be set to the outer radius of the gc system .",
    "this is a poorly constrained , but relatively uncritical number as the density in the outer parts is very low .",
    "we will generally adopt @xmath32 , where @xmath33 is the effective radius of the red gc subpopulation .",
    "this is well beyond the limit where reliable data exists for most gc systems .",
    "[ fig : ipar_r ] shows @xmath34 as a function of @xmath35 for de vaucouleurs and king profiles corresponding to the fits in fig .",
    "[ fig : rp4486 ] .",
    "the straight dotted line in each figure is simply a 1:1 relation , plotted for reference .",
    "[ fig : ipar_r ] shows that , at any @xmath3 , the `` blue '' gcs are indeed located at significantly larger mean distances from the galaxy center than the red ones . for the de vaucouleurs profile ,",
    "most of the clusters observed near the center are also located at small physical distances from the center .",
    "for the king profiles , which flatten out near the center , the mean 3d distance from the center at @xmath36 is substantially larger than for the de vaucouleurs profiles .    in a similar fashion to eq .",
    "( [ eq : ravg ] ) , the mean cluster size @xmath37 at @xmath3 is @xmath38      in fig .",
    "[ fig : rszm31 ] we apply eq .  ( [ eq : szavg ] ) to the m31 gc system , adopting the same size-@xmath2 relation as in the milky way .",
    "the top and bottom panels show gc size vs.  projected galactocentric distance for metal - poor and metal - rich gcs , respectively .",
    "as noted by other authors , there is a clear trend of gc size increasing with @xmath2 for the m31 gcs @xcite .",
    "note , however , that the samples of m31 gcs are likely to suffer from severe selection effects , making the spatial distributions uncertain @xcite .    in each panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : rszm31 ] , the solid and dashed lines represent the size-@xmath2 relations obtained by projecting the milky way relation ( eq .  [ eq : r_r_mw ] ) using king and de vaucouleurs gc density profiles with effective radii of 17@xmath19 and 30@xmath19 .",
    "these effective radii are based on the data in @xcite and are rather similar to those for the milky way gc system .",
    "the first impression is that the projected milky way relation appears to overestimate the gc sizes in m31 , but this may be partly due to the fact that the milky way contains a number of gcs with large sizes which shift the mean relation upwards .",
    "such clusters are not detected in m31 , but could well have evaded detection especially near the center of the galaxy where the bright background from the bulge and disk makes it difficult to see low - surface brightness , extended objects .",
    "as indicated in the figure , the mean differences between observed and model sizes are @xmath39 pc and @xmath40 pc for the metal - poor and metal - rich gcs , respectively .",
    "thus , in addition to the systematic offset between modeled and observed relations , there is a 0.4 pc difference between metal - rich and metal - poor clusters which is formally unaccounted for by simple projection of the milky way size-@xmath2 relation .",
    "however , there are several outlying datapoints , especially in the upper panel .",
    "the median is less sensitive to such outliers , and if we use the median instead of mean as an indicator of the difference between model and observations ( labeled @xmath41 in fig .",
    "[ fig : rszm31 ] ) then the difference is reduced to 0.14 pc . in summary , it seems quite likely that the size difference between the gc sub - populations in m31 may again be explained largely as a result of differences in the radial distributions , as in the milky way , although it would desirable to confirm this with size measurements for a larger sample of clusters .",
    "ngc  4472 and ngc  4486 are both located in the virgo cluster , for which we will assume a distance of 15 mpc .",
    "ngc  4594 is somewhat closer , at a distance of about 9 mpc @xcite . at 15 mpc , 1",
    "wf pixel corresponds to 7.3 pc . with a conversion factor of 1.48 between the fwhm and half - light radii of the king models used to fit the cluster profiles , the milky way relation ( eq .",
    "[ eq : r_r_mw ] ) then translates to @xmath42 pixels ( where the scale radius of 3 kpc corresponds to @xmath43 at the assumed distance ) .",
    "it is , however , not obvious just how to apply the milky way size-@xmath4 relation to other galaxies . in fig .",
    "[ fig : rszfit ] we display the size measurements for red and blue gcs in ngc  4486 as a function of @xmath3 .",

    "[ fig : rp4486 ] . at the scale and radial range of this figure ,",
    "the two model gc surface density profiles give very similar mean size vs. @xmath3 relations .",
    "while the sizes are measured on several wfpc2 pointings and systematic differences might be present from one pointing to another , it is undeniable that the milky way relation applied directly provides a rather poor fit to the ngc  4486 data .",
    "part of the mismatch might be due to systematic errors in the psf modeling , which could shift all datapoints up or down , but application of the milky way relation also gives a too steep slope .",
    "there is , of course , no particular reason why the size-@xmath2 relations should be the same in the milky way and in ngc  4486 .",
    "the solid lines in fig .",
    "[ fig : rszfit ] show the size-@xmath3 relation obtained by projecting a size-@xmath4 relation with half the slope of that in the milky way and shifted downwards by 0.05 pixel .",
    "this provides a much better match to the observations , although the match remains less than satisfactory in the outer regions .",
    "note that , instead of explicitly applying a shallower slope to the size-@xmath4 relation , we could have normalized @xmath4 to a 4 times larger scale radius .",
    "although the physical basis for the size-@xmath2 relation is poorly understood , it is interesting to note that half - light radius of the red gc population in ngc  4486 , @xmath23 or 9 kpc , is also roughly 34 times larger than that of the metal - rich milky way gcs .",

    "the radial range is more limited and in ngc  4594 the number of clusters in the outer parts is very small ( note that the ngc  4594 data cover a smaller radial range in kpc , due to the smaller distance of this galaxy ) .",
    "however , the behavior of gc size vs.  @xmath3 in these galaxies does not appear to be significantly different from that in ngc  4486 .",
    "though the fit to the ngc  4486 data may be further improved by additional iterations on the input size-@xmath4 relation , we will adopt the half - slope , zero - point shifted relation in fig .",

    "[ fig : ipar_s ] clearly depend on many poorly constrained parameters , it provides another hint that projection effects might account , at least partially , for the differences between the projected size distributions of metal - rich and metal - poor gcs .",
    "a lot of useful information is lost by simply averaging over the size distributions and comparing mean sizes .",
    "even if the average trends are reproduced , the detailed behavior of the observed distributions might not be properly accounted for .",

    "one possibility is to use a relation consisting of two linear segments : @xmath58 with @xmath59 and using a cubic spline to interpolate between the two linear segments in the interval @xmath60 . just piecing a relation together directly from two linear segments with an abrupt change in slope at a certain radius will not work , because the term @xmath61 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : nr ] ) will then be discontinuous , leading to a `` jump '' in the size distribution .",
    "however , by choosing an adequate separation between @xmath62 and @xmath63 the change in slope will be gentle enough to avoid spurious effects in the resulting size distribution .",
    "after some experimentation , we found that a reasonable match to the observed size distributions was obtained for @xmath64 pixels arcmin@xmath65 , @xmath66 pixels , @xmath67 , @xmath68 pixels arcmin@xmath65 , @xmath69 pixels and @xmath70 .",
    "the curve corresponding to these coefficients is compared with the square - root law in fig .",
    "[ fig : sz_r_sim ] and in panel ( b ) of fig .",
    "[ fig : szh4486k ] we show the corresponding size distributions . by construction ,",
    "the match to the observed size distributions is now much better in the inner pointing ( uppermost panel ) , though the model now appears to actually overpredict the size difference in the range @xmath71 .",
    "the `` tail '' extending up to sizes @xmath72 pixels in the observed distributions is not reproduced in any of the model distributions , but may well be due to intrinsic and/or measurement scatter in the gc size distributions , which is not taken into account in our simple model .",
    "probably for the same reason , the simulated distributions in the outer pointings are much more peaked than the observed ones .",
    "regardless , fig .",
    "[ fig : szh4486k ] ( b ) shows that projection effects can indeed produce size differences that are quite similar to the observed ones .    finally , we caution against over - interpreting fig .",
    "[ fig : szh4486k ] .",
    "it should be emphasized that the measured gc sizes are only a fraction of a wfpc pixel and any differences in mean size from one panel to another are probably only marginally significant .",
    "for example , table  [ tab : sztab ] indicates a decrease in the mean cluster size from field ngc  4486-c to ngc  4486-d of about 0.06 pixels , which is almost certainly an artifact .",
    "the random rms error on the size measurements is about 0.1 pixel @xcite and may account for a significant fraction of the widths of the observed size distributions , although the milky way data suggests that some intrinsic scatter is also present .",
    "we have re - examined the size distributions of globular cluster sub - populations in three early - type galaxies with hst / wfpc2 imaging , as well as those in the milky way and m31 . as in previous studies , we find that the blue clusters are , on average , larger than the red ones .",
    "the difference is , however , most pronounced in the central parts of the galaxies , and its statistical significance decreases strongly at larger radii .    in order to test whether the size difference might be a projection effect , resulting from a correlation between cluster size and galactocentric distance combined with different radial distributions of the gc subpopulations , we first fitted a square - root law to size vs.  galactocentric distance ( @xmath4 ) for metal - rich and metal - poor gcs in the milky way . within the uncertainties , the two gc sub - populations in the milky way appear to follow the same size-@xmath4 relation . for extragalactic gc systems , only projected size distributions",
    "can be observed . in general ,",
    "the size distributions observed at a given projected galactocentric distance will depend on the relation between gc size and 3-d galactocentric distance , as well as the 3-d density profiles of the two gc populations .",
    "these relations are poorly constrained by current data , but we have explored a limited number of analytical approximations that seem to be adequate for the ngc  4486 gc system ( for which the best data are available ) . specifically , we modeled the projected size distributions of gc subpopulations in ngc  4486 by assuming de vaucouleurs @xmath0 and king profiles for the gc density profiles and projecting plausible three - dimensional size-@xmath4 relations for the gc subpopulations . for the de vaucouleurs profiles we fail to reproduce the observed size differences , but for the king profiles we find that , with some fine - tuning of the input size@xmath4 relation , we are able to produce size distributions for the red and blue gc subpopulations that are quite similar to the observations . in our model , the size difference between red and blue gcs is expected to decrease strongly beyond 1 effective radius of the gc system .",
    "this is consistent with the lack of any size - color relation for gcs in ngc  5128 noted by @xcite , as all of the clusters in their sample are located beyond 6 kpc ( compared to an effective radius of the underlying stellar halo of 5.2 kpc @xcite ) .",
    "our approach clearly involves many simplifying assumptions , such as ignoring any intrinsic scatter in the gc sizes at any given galactocentric distance and using weakly constrained input relations for gc size vs.  @xmath4 .",
    "it nevertheless seems likely that projection effects might indeed account for a significant fraction , if not all , of the observed differences between the size distributions of gc sub - populations .",
    "thus , at this point it may be unnecessary to resort to explanations involving different formation and/or destruction mechanisms .",
    "since size differences have now been observed in many galaxies and the radial distributions of blue and red gcs generally appear to be different , the globular systems in those galaxies probably follow similar size-@xmath2 relations .",
    "it can not be ruled out that intrinsic size differences exist in some cases .",
    "indeed , we know of some cases of clusters with unusually large sizes , such as the faint palomar - type clusters in the milky way halo and the `` faint fuzzy '' clusters in the disks of the nearby lenticular galaxies ngc  1023 and ngc  3384 @xcite .",
    "these objects have effective radii that are a factor of 34 larger than those of `` normal '' star clusters , and might have formed under different conditions .",
    "this work has benefited from discussions and correspondence with many of our colleagues , including d.  forbes , j.  strader and j.  cohen .",
    "the presentation has also benefitted from the useful comments of an anonymous referee .",
