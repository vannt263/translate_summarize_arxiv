    "since the inception of qcd as _ the _ theory of the strong interaction , perturbative qcd ( pqdc ) has been spectacularly successful in explaining a host of scattering and annihilation processes involving hadrons . among these",
    "is the @xmath1 dependence of the proton @xmath5 structure function measured in charged lepton deeply inelastic scattering ( dis ) .",
    "however , the separation of the _ pure _ leading twist pqcd @xmath1 dependence from possible higher twist ( ht ) and so called target mass contributions ( tmcs ) is required for any quantitative study of pqcd at moderate to large values of bjorken @xmath0 and low @xmath1 .",
    "the large body of existing data on @xmath2 covers a significant range in @xmath1 and @xmath0 , and is a critical input for pqcd based fits which attempt to extract the parton distribution functions ( pdfs ) . while the contributions from tmcs are now being included in some pdf fits , cf .",
    "e.g.  @xcite .",
    "historically the data which were expected to have significant tm or ht contributions were excluded in standard analyses from the fits via kinematic cuts on the invariant hadron mass , @xmath6 .",
    "typically , this has removed nearly all the precision data from slac at moderate to large @xmath0 from the fits , significantly reducing the @xmath1 lever arm on the remaining data , and resulting in the rather large error bands quoted from these fits for @xmath7 .    in this paper",
    "we present a fit to the world charged lepton scattering data on the proton @xmath5 and @xmath8 ( @xmath9 ) structure functions with the aim of separating the tmcs from the massless limit structure functions via an unfolding procedure .",
    "the method employed is complementary to pdf fits including the twist-2 target mass contributions @xcite , but has the advantage that it does not rely on a finite expansion in the strong coupling constant @xmath10 .",
    "this avoids the issue of disentangling higher order qcd corrections from the tmcs .",
    "the extracted distributions still contain the higher twist terms .",
    "the world charged lepton scattering data sets utilized for the @xmath5 fit are listed in table  [ datasets - f2 ] and include data from the bcdms  @xcite , and nmc  @xcite collaborations , the reanalyzed slac data from whitlow @xmath11 @xmath12  @xcite , and the @xmath13 and @xmath14 data from the h1  @xcite and zeus  @xcite collaborations ; the latter two help to constrain the fit at both low @xmath0 and large @xmath1 . to help constrain the low @xmath1 region , recent data from jefferson lab hall c experiments e99 - 118  @xcite and e94 - 110",
    "@xcite have been utilized .",
    "these experiments have additionally performed limited longitudinal and transverse ( l / t ) separations to extract the information on the transverse structure function , @xmath9 , the longitudinal structure function , @xmath8 , and the ratio @xmath15 . for the @xmath8 fit",
    "we include _ only _ the data extracted via l / t separations in order to minimize the correlation between the @xmath5 and @xmath8 data sets .",
    "for the jlab experiments , only the l / t separated values for @xmath5 were utilized .",
    "it is unfortunate that more experiments have not made readily available the complete set of separated structure functions extracted from l / t separations .",
    "instead , what can generally be found is a table of the extracted @xmath16 values , but without the consistently extracted values for @xmath5 ( or @xmath9 ) . in these cases",
    "the data on @xmath8 have been constructed utilizing the available data on @xmath17 and a parameterization of the @xmath5 structure function .",
    "the longitudinal structure function was then constructed from @xmath18 with @xmath19 . for this purpose",
    "the phenomenological allm fit  @xcite was utilized , which reproduces the world @xmath5 data to better than 3% and we include this as an additional uncertainty when propagating the uncertainties on @xmath8 ( @xmath9 ) , which are ultimately dominated by the uncertainties on the @xmath17 data .",
    "the data sets utilized for the @xmath8 fit are listed in table  [ datasets - fl ] .    before discussing the procedure , we feel it is worth commenting further on the need for uncorrelated data sets for @xmath8 and @xmath5 .",
    "this is also important for extractions of pdfs utilizing pqcd fits , since @xmath8 provides direct information on the gluon content that is only present in @xmath5 through the shallow logarithmic scaling violations . in principle",
    ", the most information on the structure can be obtained from the full data set on the reduced cross section , which is proportional to @xmath20 , with @xmath21 a kinematic factor describing the photon polarization .",
    "most of the dis data sets extract @xmath5 utilizing _ all _ the cross section measurements , after first determining @xmath17 by a linear fit in @xmath21 to the reduced cross section measurements at different @xmath21 values at fixed @xmath0 and @xmath1 ( the rosenbluth separation technique  @xcite ) .",
    "we follow the formalism for including tmcs to the massless limit structure function developed by georgi and politzer  @xcite within the operator product expansion ( ope ) .",
    "this approach was extended by kretzer and reno  @xcite to include the full set of electro - weak structure functions using modern formalism .",
    "for a recent review of tmcs see  @xcite .    at fixed @xmath1 the @xmath5 structure function , including tm effects , can be written @xmath22 here , @xmath23 is the massless limit structure function which can be calculated in pqcd utilizing the pdfs determined at some scale , @xmath24 is the nachtmann scaling variable , and both @xmath25 and @xmath26 are dummy integration variables .",
    "the corresponding tmc equation for @xmath8 is @xmath27 the transverse structure function including the tm contributions , can then be constructed from @xmath28 and in the massless limit ( @xmath29 ) from @xmath30    we note that these equations are valid to all orders in pqcd at twist 2 .",
    "the target mass corrections for for higher twist operators in the unpolarized case are yet unknown",
    ". moreover , dynamical higher twist contributions , starting with twist 4 , can not be described with one scaling variable only , neither do their potential target mass corrections , because the main variable @xmath0 is supplemented by further other invariants @xmath31 .",
    "their number grows with the level of twist included .",
    "this implies the necessity to study different multi - parton correlations , which can not be determined by inclusive measurements as that of the deep - inelastic structure functions only .",
    "because of this the present analysis remains phenomenological applying the twist 2 target mass corrections to the structure functions .",
    ", are relevant .",
    "the polarized twist-3 tmcs are described by different integrals as those at twist 2 . however",
    ", quantitative numerical case studies using the same shape for input distributions have not been performed yet . ]    while it is @xmath32 that is measured in scattering experiments , it is the @xmath1 evolution of @xmath33 that is described by pqcd . to extract @xmath33 from data requires the inversion of eq .",
    "( [ eq : tmcf2 ] ) .",
    "the procedure for extracting the tm corrected @xmath5 structure function is to parameterize @xmath23 and then to minimize the @xmath34 difference between the left - hand side of eq  ( [ eq : tmcf2 ] ) and the @xmath5 data : @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the value of the @xmath37 data point and @xmath38 it s uncorrelated uncertainty .",
    "the fit results for both @xmath5 and @xmath8 are quite good , with @xmath34 per degree of freedom ( @xmath34/dof ) of 1.01 and 0.93 for @xmath5 and @xmath8 , respectively .",
    "the resulting fit parameters are listed in table  [ param_f2 ] for @xmath5 and table  [ param_fl ] for @xmath8 .",
    "comparisons of the fit results to the @xmath5 data are shown in figure  [ fig : f2results ] for the 6 different @xmath1 values listed on the panels from 1 to 100  @xmath39 .",
    "data within a range of @xmath1 about the central value have been centered to the common @xmath1 value using the fit .",
    "a comparison over the full @xmath0 range fit is shown ( left ) , as well as for large @xmath0 ( right ) .",
    "similar comparisons for @xmath8 are shown in figure  [ fig : flresults ] .",
    "of particular note is the lack of quality data for @xmath8 in the range @xmath40 for @xmath41  @xmath39 .",
    "such data is critical for constraining the fit at low @xmath0 and would be of particular value in constraining the gluon distribution which is a dominant contribution to @xmath8 .",
    "we expect that the fit will be of interest to the broader community in providing a good description of the data on the full set of unpolarized structure functions in charged lepton scattering from the proton , @xmath5 , @xmath8 , @xmath9 , and @xmath17 , over the kinematic range of @xmath42 and @xmath43 , in addition to providing a separation of the tmcs from the massless limit structure functions .",
    "the separated structure functions can be used for further pqcd studies , such as ht analyses of both the structure functions and moments .",
    "the current analysis procedure is complementary to pdf fits which include tmcs in that the unfolding of the tmcs does not depend on a finite order expansion in @xmath44 .",
    "comparison of the results from the two procedures could provide an additional handle on isolating ht contributions from higher - order qcd corrections and making for a cleaner evaluation of the former .    additionally , the fit will be of use in future studies of quark - hadron duality . in particular , determining how well the",
