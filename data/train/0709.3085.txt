    "every well - studied cepheid undergoes changes in pulsation period : some rapidly , others extremely slowly , and @xmath6 in irregular fashion , attributable to random fluctuations in pulsation period , generally superposed upon parabolic evolutionary trends , e.g. sv  vul @xcite . for the large majority",
    "the effect can be attributed directly to gradual changes in mean radius as post main - sequence stars of @xmath7 evolve through the instability strip in the h - r diagram @xcite .",
    "parabolic trends in cepheid o  c diagrams  temporal plots of the differences between observed and computed times of light maxima  are diagnostic features of stars undergoing slow changes in mean radius @xcite .",
    "the case for the 3.7-day cepheid rt  aur is most unusual .",
    "summaries by @xcite and @xcite of observed times of maximum light between 1897 and 1980 provide a strong case for a regular period decrease in the cepheid @xcite , although @xcite preferred to interpret the o  c data as evidence for a discontinuous period change , contrary to the arguments for evolution @xcite . the available o ",
    "c data to 1980 , from @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and an unpublished list by vitaly goransky of the sternberg astronomical institute , cited by @xcite , of observed times of maximum light are shown in figure 1 ( upper ) . the weighting scheme for the data used throughout this paper",
    "is that employed by @xcite , with weights assigned to sources not cited by @xcite on the basis of the perceived quality of the result .",
    "the negative parabolic trend is the signature of a regular period decrease @xcite , and the inferred rate of @xmath8 s yr@xmath1 is close to what is predicted from stellar evolutionary models for a star in the second crossing of the cepheid instability strip @xcite .",
    "regular photoelectric monitoring of the brightness variations of rt  aur by professional observers ceased over a decade ago , with the exception of @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and observations by the hipparcos satellite @xcite .",
    "a variety of other observations of the star , primarily by amateur astronomers , has generated additional times of light maximum that are listed by @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "they are plotted in figure 1 ( lower ) , using the weighting scheme described above , but are generally of lower quality than most observations by professional observers , as indicated by the larger scatter in the more recent times of light maxima .",
    "nevertheless , it is clear that current o ",
    "c data do not confirm the regular period decrease evident prior to 1980 .",
    "a similar trend is indicated in an o  c plot for rt  aur generated by @xcite using low quality observations by members of the american association of variable star observers ( aavso ) , who , in conjunction with european observers , have been the primary observers of the cepheid in the current era .",
    "here we present additional data that confirm the more recent observations of the curious change in pulsation period for rt  aur , and argue that the long - term brightness changes of the cepheid are actually more consistent with a period _ increase _ than a period decrease .",
    "there is , in fact , convincing evidence for a superposed sinusoidal trend that hints at more complex behavior generally consistent with orbital motion in a binary system .",
    "the main point to be made , however , is that the true situation will only be established by further monitoring of the star .",
    "the last few decades of observation merely hint at the interesting changes occurring in the system .",
    "we obtained a selection of new o  c data points for rt  aur through analysis of a variety of unpublished observations for the cepheid , which include observations by members of the american association of variable star observers ( aavso ) from @xcite and data from group `` betelgeuse . ''",
    "the latter include individual observations of rt  aur by group members , as well as data obtained from visual inspection of photographic images in the plate archives at minsk and odessa .",
    "all data listed only by julian date were converted into heliocentric equivalents , and were phased using a new ephemeris given by : @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the number of elapsed cycles .",
    "we also made use of a standard light curve for rt  aur , in @xmath11 and @xmath12 , constructed from the detailed photometry of @xcite supplemented by data from @xcite that were matched in both phase and magnitude to the observations of @xcite .",
    "since rt  aur is a fifth magnitude cepheid , its brightness is typically monitored optically by means of binoculars or low power oculars , although magnitude estimates without optical aid would likely be more accurate given the eye s increasing precision for estimating brightness levels when functioning near the visibility limit @xcite .",
    "stellar brightness is more difficult to establish optically when it falls well above the eye limit , which may partly explain the large scatter in the aavso estimates for rt  aur @xcite , as indicated in figure 2 .",
    "the large number of individual aavso estimates compensates for the large scatter , however , and results in very precise o  c estimates .",
    "the aavso database for rt  aur is relatively sparse prior to 1969 , however ( cf .",
    "* ) , which restricts its usefulness mainly to the last four decades .",
    "the group `` betelgeuse '' brightness estimates for rt  aur are a mix of different sources : individual eye estimates obtained between 1989 and 2000 , as well as from 2005 to 2007 , by individual group members , using low power oculars and wide field telescopes , and eye estimates from photographs in the plate archives of odessa and minsk .",
    "the archival photographic material dates from 1988 to 1996 , and consists of panchromatic gzs-2 film with a magnitude limit of @xmath13 , and a500 film exposed through a uv filter with a magnitude limit of @xmath14 . typically 24 reference stars differing in brightness by @xmath15 magnitude were used for comparison purposes , with individual estimates made using the step method .",
    "some typical light curves are illustrated in figure 3 , where the superior quality of eye estimates from single observers over those of inhomogeneous groups is evident .",
    "we also obtained new @xmath16band photometry for rt  aur during january , february , and march 2007 using a st9 ccd camera equipped with bessel filters on the 0.28-m c11 schmidt - cassegrain telescope of the automated abbey ridge observatory of dave lane .",
    "the data were normalized using the previously - constructed standard light curve .",
    "the observations are listed in table 1 , along with phases computed as indicated previously .    for reference purposes ,",
    "we list in table 2 the times for light maximum compiled by goransky and not compiled elsewhere in the literature .",
    "some of the cited values are of indeterminate authorship .",
    "seasonal light curves for rt  aur were constructed from the observational data , and were matched to the standard @xmath11 and @xmath12 light curves using the robust software described previously @xcite . despite the large amount of scatter in the aavso observations , the large number of individual estimates results in relatively precise o ",
    "c estimates , as indicated by the small scatter for the aavso values in figure 4 ( upper ) .",
    "the individual light curves from the group `` betelgeuse '' data exhibit slightly smaller scatter , but generally result in less accurate o  c values because of the smaller number of individual estimates , according to figure 4 ( lower )",
    ". both sets of observations confirm the trend indicated by the o  c data derived by other observers , primarily amateur astronomers ( figure 1 , lower ) .",
    "it is not clear from the o ",
    "c estimates cited by @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite how the times of light maximum were derived , but the techniques are apparently less robust than the variant of hertzsprung s method employed here .",
    "the new photometry obtained here ( table 1 ) , as well as visual observations of the cepheid by bryukhanov between december 2006 and april 2007 , also display a phase shift relative to the standard light curve , as evident from figure 5 , that confirms the o  c trend of the other observations .",
    "a compilation of all o  c estimates from the present study is given in table 3 , including , where possible , reworkings of older data sets available in the literature .",
    "the complete set of o  c data , including the values compiled by @xcite , that of @xcite cited by @xcite , @xcite , @xcite as given in table 2 , and @xcite is illustrated in figure 6 ( lower ) , relative to the situation that existed prior to 1980 ( figure 6 , upper ) .",
    "a weighted least squares fit of a parabola to the full data set indicates that rt  aur is undergoing an overall period _ increase _ rather than a period decrease , at a calculated rate of @xmath0 s yr@xmath1 .",
    "the value is consistent with the 3.7-day pulsation period of rt  aur , as indicated by its location in the period change diagram of figure 7 , which is adapted from fig .",
    "5 of @xcite .",
    "rt  aur has a pulsational amplitude near the maximum value displayed by cepheids with periods of @xmath17 days , so must lie near the center of the instability strip , in fact slightly towards the hot edge from strip center @xcite . the location of the o ",
    "c datum for rt  aur in figure 7 is almost exactly that expected for a 3.7-day cepheid in the third crossing of the instability strip lying slightly blueward of strip center .",
    "it is possible to remove the parabolic evolutionary trend in the o  c data of figure 6 ( lower ) , and also correct for errors in the adopted ephemeris .",
    "the resulting o  c residuals for rt  aur are plotted in figure 8 , and are analyzed below .",
    "the sinusoidal trend of the o ",
    "c data residuals for rt  aur is a feature observed in a few other cepheids . in some cases",
    "such trends arise from random fluctuations in pulsation period for the stars , e.g. sv  vul @xcite .",
    "one can test for the effect by analyzing the residuals using the procedure developed by @xcite , see @xcite .",
    "one examines the temporal differences @xmath18 of each @xmath19 observed light maximum residual from the null relation to compute the accumulated delays @xmath20 between maxima separated by @xmath21 cycles . according to @xcite ,",
    "the average value @xmath22 for the accumulated delays between light maxima separated by @xmath21 cycles , without regard for sign , is correlated with any random fluctuations in period @xmath23 by : @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the size of the random errors in the measured times of light maximum .    for rt",
    "aur the results over 1000 cycles ( not shown ) yield a best - fitting weighted relation given by : @xmath26 the zero - point for the relation , @xmath27 , implies uncertainties in the calculated times of light maximum of order @xmath28 day ( @xmath29 hours ) , which is reasonable although significantly larger than the uncertainties generated by hertzsprung s method .",
    "the slope of the relation corresponds to a value for the randomness parameter of magnitude @xmath30 , consistent with a null result .",
    "it appears that the sinusoidal trend in the o ",
    "c residuals for rt  aur can not be attributed to random fluctuations in period , according to an eddington test performed on the observational data .",
    "alternatively , the trend may arise from light travel time effects in a binary system .",
    "c residuals were examined for periodicity through a fourier analysis , which produced a strong , well - defined signal for @xmath2 days , or @xmath3 years .",
    "the data phased to that period and an arbitrary zero - point of hjd 2410000 are shown in figure 9 ( upper ) .",
    "a least squares fit of a sine wave to the data gives a value of @xmath31 light day @xmath32 a.u .",
    "@xmath33 km for the orbit of the cepheid about the system barycenter . of course",
    ", the orbit need not be circular ; the adoption of @xmath34 in the analysis was predicated by the scatter in the o ",
    "c residuals and the lack of solid evidence for a non - sinusoidal trend .",
    "the sine wave solution also yields a mass function for the putative binary system of @xmath35 .",
    "such a large mass function implies a relatively high mass for the companion , as well as a strong likelihood that the orbit is nearly edge - on . with a mass of @xmath36 for a fundamental mode cepheid with the pulsation period of rt  aur @xcite ,",
    "the implied minimum mass for the secondary is of order @xmath37 , typical of a b9-a0 dwarf .",
    "such a large mass for the companion is ruled out , however , both by the color variations of the cepheid @xcite , which display no indication of a blue secondary , and by its ultraviolet spectrum @xcite , the latter indicating that any main sequence secondary for rt  aur must be cooler than spectral type a4 , or @xmath38 . conceivably there is an additional factor affecting the o  c variations other than random fluctuations in period or light travel time effects .",
    "radial velocity observations may provide a resolution to the paradox .",
    "@xcite has summarized the available systemic velocities for rt  aur to 1991 , to which we have added additional measures from the radial velocities tabulated by @xcite and @xcite , with pulsational variations removed .",
    "the combined data phased to the ephemeris adopted for the o ",
    "c residuals are plotted in figure 9 ( lower ) . for orbital motion",
    "the radial velocity variations are a quarter cycle out of step with the o ",
    "c residuals , and leading them , so a sine wave with those characteristics was crudely fit by eye to the observations .",
    "the expected radial velocity half - amplitude according to the orbital solution is @xmath39 km s@xmath1 , but the observations appear to permit only a smaller value that we estimate as @xmath40 km s@xmath1 , with an implied systemic velocity of @xmath41 km s@xmath1 .",
    "the projected orbital radius for the primary in this case is @xmath42 km @xmath43 a.u . , which results in a mass function of @xmath44 .",
    "the radial velocity solution implies a minimum mass for the secondary of order @xmath5 , typical of a f7 dwarf .",
    "such a solution is permitted by the lack of a companion detected through color variations and ultraviolet spectra , but rests upon an incomplete radial velocity solution . by chance",
    "the archival radial velocity observations of rt aur are roughly coincident in orbital phase with more modern measurements , so only a third of the orbital cycle is covered observationally .",
    "there is also a potential zero - point offset for the earliest observations , which are those of @xcite , remeasured by @xcite with similar results .",
    "the 1908 measures agree with the trend of the other radial velocity data only if they are systematically @xmath45 km s@xmath1 too positive .",
    "given that zero - point offsets of order @xmath46 km s@xmath1 are present even in some modern radial velocity measurements , a correction of that amount seems reasonable .",
    "of course , it is conceivable that the effect may also indicate the presence of a third star in the system , but that is difficult to test with the available data .",
    "certainly an improved spectroscopic orbital solution is only possible with a focused observational spectroscopic program on rt  aur over the next half century , clearly a challenging task .",
    "the value of continued monitoring of cepheid variables in an era when professional observations of such stars are declining is illustrated clearly by the case of rt  aur .",
    "circa 1993 when fernie reviewed the situation @xcite , the available observations implied a regular period decrease for the cepheid . yet observations since then imply exactly the opposite : rt  aur appears to be undergoing a regular period increase .",
    "the calculated rate of @xmath0 s yr@xmath1is exactly that expected for a cepheid in the third crossing of the instability strip lying near strip center , despite a superposed sinusoidal trend in the o ",
    "c data implying an additional complication .    the possibility that rt  aur is undergoing random fluctuations in pulsation period is eliminated by an eddington test on the residuals .",
    "the trend is consistent , however , with light time effects expected if rt  aur is orbiting an unseen companion .",
    "the inferred minimum mass for the unseen companion is of order @xmath47 from the o ",
    "c residuals , but only of order @xmath48 according to the orbital radial velocity variations .",
    "the latter value is consistent with the lack of any evidence for a hot companion evident in the cepheid s color variations and ultraviolet spectra .",
    "additional observations of the star , and spectroscopic measurements in particular , may provide a more definitive estimate for the companion s characteristics .    the remarkable change in the o ",
    "c trend for rt  aur , namely the switch from a period decrease prior to 1980 to a dominant period increase since then , is unusual but not without precedent .",
    "the 23-day cepheid wz car , for example , appears to have changed from a regular period increase prior to 1973 to a regular period decrease since then @xcite , while the 4-day cepheid polaris underwent an astonishing glitch in its regular period increase circa 1963 - 66 @xcite that is difficult to explain .",
    "other surprises may be in store when a complete sample of cepheid period changes is examined .",
    "we acknowledge with thanks the variable star observations from the aavso international database contributed by observers worldwide and used in this research .",
    "we are also grateful to the referee , laszlo szabados , for several useful suggestions that provided greater depth to the original study , and to nicolai samus and vitaly goransky for information on archival observations of rt aur .",
