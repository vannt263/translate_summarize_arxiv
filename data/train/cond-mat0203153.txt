    "we find in the literature reports on ferromagnetism in carbon - based compounds which apparently did not attract the necessary attention in the community .",
    "for example there are reports on ferromagnetic - like signals in pyrolytic carbon @xcite and in hopg @xcite . in the first study pyrolytic carbon with",
    "higher crystallinity than usual was prepared from adamantane by chemical vapor deposition @xcite .",
    "the metal impurities were claimed to be @xmath0  ppm and the ferromagnetic - like loop was reported to persist up to 400 k. in other work @xcite the main study was the magnetization of pd nanoparticles encapsulated in a graphite host . in the inset of their fig .",
    "2 the authors show a ferromagnetic - like hysteresis loop for graphite without pd nanoparticles at a temperature of 300  k. we note that the saturation magnetization @xmath1 emu / g is much larger than the one measured in this work and by kopelevich et al . @xcite . because the impurity concentration of that sample was not reported the origin of this signal remains , however , unclear .",
    "amorphous - like carbon prepared by direct pyrolysis was found to be a stable strong magnet with a saturation magnetization comparable to magnetite @xcite .",
    "the effect of the pyrolysis temperature on similar materials was also reported @xcite .",
    "ferromagnetism in pure c-60 induced by photo - assisted oxidation was reported to remain up to a critical temperature of 800 k , although the authors stated that only a small part of the sample contributes to the ferromagnetism @xcite .",
    "more recently , ferromagnetism in pure rhombohedral polymerized c-60 samples was reported to remain up to 500 k @xcite .",
    "the recent report of ferromagnetic- and superconducting - like @xcite magnetization hysteresis loops in hopg in a broad temperature range opens several questions about the origin of the observed anomalies .",
    "kopelevich et al .",
    "@xcite found that the magnetization of hopg samples shows ferromagnetic - like hysteresis loops up to 800  k. the details of the hysteresis depend on the sample , sample heat treatment and on the direction of the applied field .",
    "there has been a controversy between the opinion of the referees on the possible influence of impurities on the observations @xcite .",
    "therefore , more systematic work on the observed signal was necessary .    as clearly stated by j.s .",
    "miller @xcite for magnetic polymers , it appears that most of the claimed high - temperature ferromagnetism in nominally magnetic - ion free compounds in the past turned out to be of extrinsic origin . to establish that the low saturation magnetization of a material , as in the case of the reported hopg ( @xmath2 mg @xmath3emu/@xmath4 ) might be of intrinsic origin , reproducibility and a quantification of extrinsic contributions must be achieved . therefore and in order to clarify whether the observed ferromagnetism found in ref .",
    "@xcite reflects an intrinsic property of graphite or is due to ferromagnetic impurities , we have measured different oriented graphite samples with different magnetic impurity concentrations ( mainly fe ) .",
    "both ferromagnetism and superconductivity have been predicted to arise in graphene layers in regions of certain topological defect structures @xcite . on the other hand , ferrimagnetic behavior due to edge states",
    "is also expected in graphene layers @xcite .",
    "taking into account all the experimental and theoretical work cited above we feel that a systematic study of the ferromagnetic - like hysteresis loops found in hopg @xcite as a function of magnetic impurities is necessary before speculating on its origin .",
    "only a careful analysis of the data accompanied by a complete impurity concentration study on the same samples may provide an answer on the origin of the ferromagnetism found in hopg .",
    "the reported ferromagnetic - like signal was measured mostly for an applied field in direction parallel to the planes , whereas superconducting - like loops in hopg were mainly observed with the magnetic field applied perpendicular to the planes after subtraction of the diamagnetic background @xcite .",
    "this diamagnetic contribution depends strongly on the angle between applied field and the graphene layers reaching a minimum for the parallel orientation .",
    "therefore , and in order to minimize any possible error due to the subtraction of the diamagnetic contribution , all the results reported in the current study were obtained with the field parallel to the graphene layers . with respect to the superconducting - like behavior observed in graphite @xcite we would like to note that clear evidence for superconductivity in simple mixtures of graphite powder with sulphur has been reported recently @xcite .    the paper is organized as follows . in the next section",

    "because the magnetization signals of the samples are rather small we have checked the background signal from the sample holders in the squid .",
    "this contribution turned out to be non - negligible , and special care has been applied in the selection of the holder as well as with the sample handling procedure in order to prevent contamination of the holders and/or samples . for measurements below 350 k",
    "we have used a plastic tube with a small window and an adhesive tape ( tesa ag , hamburg ) .",

    "k the samples were fixed in a quartz tube between two quartz spacers and enclosed under a pressure of @xmath11 torr .",
    "the background signal in this case was negligible in comparison with the sample response .",
    "in general , the ferromagnetic hysteresis is superimposed to a linear in field diamagnetic background . as noted above",
    ", this diamagnetic signal depends on the misalignment of the sample with respect to the field as well as on the intrinsic misalignment of the graphene planes in the sample .",
    "the diamagnetic contribution for each sample has been determined in - situ and in a straightforward way : using a linear regression through the data points obtained for magnetic fields up to 5  t we obtained the diamagnetic slope @xmath12 .",
    "we note that the magnetization due to the superimposed ferromagnetic signal saturates at fields larger than 2  koe and therefore it does not influence the linear field dependence of the diamagnetic background .",

    "were carried out using the cu - k@xmath161 radiation .",

    "the measurements of the impurity concentration were carried out with particle induced x - ray emission ( pixe ) using a 2 mev proton beam . for the samples studied here the typical minimum detection limit ( mdl ) of this method was @xmath18g / g ( for some elements , much smaller ) . with exception of the natural graphite sample , the impurity concentration was distributed homogeneously in the samples .",
    "the concentration of all other magnetic elements not listed in table  i was less than 1 @xmath19g / g .",

    "while in both modes , a clear - cut discrimination of topology ( height ) differences from density - of - state ( current ) differences can not be afforded , the first scanning mode emphasizes the topological structure whereas the latter accentuates local variations of the density of states .",
    "figures [ ac ] to [ hopg2 ] show examples of the measured magnetization loops obtained in some of the samples at 300 k and 10 k. all hopg samples show ferromagnetic - like hysteresis of the same order of magnitude .",
    "figure [ ac ] shows the hysteresis loops obtained for the samples from advanced ceramics at two different temperatures . whereas the loop shown in ( b )",
    "is obtained after subtraction of a diamagnetic background signal @xmath24emu / g oe , the loop in ( a ) was obtained directly from the measurements without subtraction of any diamagnetic background .",

    "the annealing procedure was done in situ in the squid under vacuum .",
    "it is observed that long time annealing has a weak influence , if any , on the hysteresis width and the saturation magnetization .",

    "therefore , we will discuss below different possible origins in view of the existing evidence .    _",
    "( a ) magnetic impurities_. the possibility of a significant contribution of magnetic impurities to the measured magnetic properties is taken serious and carefully analyzed before we discuss possible intrinsic origins of the hysteresis loops measured in graphite . in spite of the fact that no correlation between the observed magnetization and the fe - concentration exists , one might still believe that those impurities are sufficient to produce the measured signals . a typical argument used to attribute",
    "a ferromagnetic signal to impurities would be as follows : let us assume that all fe impurities would form iron or magnetite ( fe@xmath34o@xmath35 ) clusters and that all clusters are large enough to behave ferro- or ferrimagnetically .",
    "an impurity content of 1  @xmath19 g fe per gram graphite would then contribute @xmath36emu / g to the magnetization in the case of fe clusters or @xmath37emu / g in the case of fe@xmath34o@xmath35 clusters assuming that these clusters behave like bulk materials . considering a linear increase of the magnetic moment with the fe concentration , for most of the samples the possible contribution of the fe impurities exceeds clearly the measured magnetization values at saturation or are on the same order of magnitude , see fig .",
    "[ sat ] . in the case of the kish sample , ac2 and for hopg-3",
    "the measured values are larger than the maximum possible contribution from fe clusters .",
    "thus , for these three samples the values of magnetization can not be explained by fe impurities .",
    "moreover , the assumption that such a low fe - concentration behaves ferromagnetically and produces a hysteresis loop with finite remanent moment and coercive fields at room temperature or even higher @xcite is rather unlikely taking into account that the fe concentration measured in the hopg samples was found to be homogeneously distributed . to quantify the magnetization behavior of fe impurities in graphite we have measured a natural graphite bulk sample that has an inhomogeneous fe distribution through the sample between 13 @xmath19g / g and 3,790 @xmath19g / g",

    "all other magnetic impurities are below 10 @xmath19g / g and may therefore be neglected .",
    "figure [ nat](a ) shows the hysteresis loop of the natural graphite crystal for fields parallel to its main plane after subtracting the paramagnetic ( 10 k ) or diamagnetic ( 300 k ) contributions ( proportional to the applied field ) shown in the inset .",
    "the measured hysteresis is very small with a remanent magnetization @xmath38  emu / g .",
    "the magnetization at 2koe is @xmath39  emu / g .",
    "naively , one would argue that such a magnetization can be produced by @xmath40  @xmath19g / g ferromagnetic fe .",
    "such a comparison is , however , misleading .",
    "if the magnetic signal is due to fe impurities , the nearly negligible hysteresis width and the lack of saturation at 2  koe indicate that fe impurities do not behave ferromagnetically but rather superparamagnetically .",
    "to better understand this point we measured the magnetization up to 5  t and we obtained a ferromagnetic - like curve of negligible width , see fig .",
    "[ nat](b ) , after subtracting the paramagnetic background contribution .",
    "we estimate that the saturation magnetization observed at 5  t is produced by 840  @xmath19g / g fe , a concentration comparable to the average impurity content of the sample .    a typical response of superparamagnetic fe in graphite is also recognized in the strong temperature dependence of the magnetization at 0.2  t below 150  k , see inset in fig .",
    "[ nat](b ) .",
    "this behavior is in clear contrast to that obtained in the hopg samples . as an example",
    "we show the temperature dependence of the magnetization measured at 2koe in the hopg-2 sample ( after subtracting the diamagnetic contribution ) in fig .",
    "it is recognized that the magnetization is practically temperature independent , in clear contrast to the expected behavior if the 8 @xmath19g / g of fe would behave superparamagnetically .",
    "this result agrees with that reported in ref .",
    "@xcite that the saturation magnetization in annealed hopg samples remains practically temperature independent up to 800  k. in line with that , the measured hysteresis loops for the hopg-2 sample at 800  k ( which is the highest possible in our equipment ) indicate that the curie temperature is larger than that . from a linear extrapolation of the remanent magnetization ( fig .",
    "[ magt ] ) to zero we estimate that the curie temperature is of the order of 900  k. the small change observed in the hysteresis upon annealing the sample at 700 k or 800 k in vacuum , shown in fig .",
    "[ hopg2](b ) , appears to be difficult to explain by arguing in terms of a magnetic contribution of ferrocene .",
    "from all the evidence presented here we believe that magnetic impurities can be excluded as the origin of the weak ferromagnetism observed in hopg .",

    "more recently , the electronic properties of carbon nanotubes , and particularly edge states of nanometer - sized graphite ribbons , have attracted much interest @xcite .",
    "it is expected that the electronic structure of the graphite @xmath41 system may differ considerably on carbons located within a graphite sheet and those at its edge @xcite . moreover ,",
    "such localized edge states have been shown to depend sensitively on the geometry of the edge @xcite : while  zigzag \" edges perpendicular to the @xmath42 $ ] lattice direction show such states ,  armchair \" edges ( perpendicular to @xmath43 $ ] ) do not .",
    "thus ,  zigzag \" edge states may lead to an increase of the density of states at the fermi level .",
    "this has been experimentally confirmed in stm work on hopg samples @xcite .",
    "if such edge states occur at high density , a ferrimagnetic spin polarization may result .",
    "experimental findings on graphitized nanodiamond @xcite and activated carbon fibers @xcite support this expectation .",
    "similarly , a strong enhancement of the curie - like paramagnetic contribution was predicted at low temperatures , see ref .",
    "@xcite and references therein , and this has been experimentally confirmed @xcite .",
    "recently , the mechanisms of magnetism in stacked nanographite were theoretically studied @xcite .",
    "this work obtained an antiferromagnetic solution for a - b - type stacking only .",
    "one may doubt that the edge states could be the origin for the ferromagnetism found in our macroscopic graphite samples , since in nanographites these states provide an enhanced paramagnetism and their size @xmath31 nm is smaller than the in - plane correlation length of our graphite samples ( the influence of the edge states to the electronic properties of a graphene layer should decrease with @xmath17 ) .",
    "however , small - size effects and the thermal energy could also preclude the formation of a stable ferromagnetic ordering in nanographite .",
    "it is also unclear whether correlation effects between edge states in macroscopic graphite samples with a in - plane correlation length not more than five times the size of the reported nanographite samples ( see table i ) would not be enough to stabilize a ferromagnetic order .",
    "theoretical studies suggest that the presence of strong topological disorder will stabilize ferromagnetism and frustate antiferromagnetic order @xcite .",
    "no prediction was made , however , on the minimum density of the disorder necessary for this situation . therefore and",
    "because the theoretical results are not yet conclusive we should not neglect a possible contribution of edge states to stabilize the fm in bulk graphite .    in order to assess",
    "the role of edge states and their potential contribution to the magnetic properties of the graphite samples studied in this work , a systematic stm investigation of these samples would be desireable .",
    "unfortunately , such a study is beyond the scope of our current experimental capabilities . in order to obtain at least a feeling whether or not edge states that might exist at grain boundaries within the graphite samples contribute to their observed anomalous magnetic properties we have conducted a limited study of some of the samples in air .",
    "we note that we are currently not capable of performing the spectroscopic studies @xcite that were required to assess quantitatively putative differences in the density of states at the fermi level as a function of the atom positions with respect to grain boundaries .",
    "figure  [ stm ] gives exemplary stm results obtained at a freshly cleaved surface of the hopg-2 sample in air .",
    "the images have been flattened , but no filtering was applied to the raw data .",
    "panel ( a ) shows a @xmath44nm@xmath45 surface topology overview observed in constant - current mode .",
    "two types of linear defects are observed within the planar surface : a step line , oriented roughly along the scan direction ( horizontal direction within the image ) and an apparent elevation line that runs along the step defect at an oblique angle .",
    "both line defects are much longer than the width of the image and are characterized in the section profile shown on the right . in other micrographs",
    "than the one shown in fig .",
    "[ stm ] we do not find indications that the two type of line defects are coupled to each other . by inspection of a large number of similar micrographs , we conclude that such defects are characteristic of the sample surface . on the surface of the hopg-2 sample",
    ", they have a typical distance of a few 100  nm .",
    "inspection of the unit cell orientations on both sides of the two types of defects at higher resolution ( _ vide infra _ ) reveals that both are associated with grain boundaries .",
    "the section profile indicates that the step height of the first line defect is @xmath46 nm , which corresponds to the length of one unit cell along the crystallographic * c * axis , _ i.e. _ the height of two graphite sheets .",
    "in fact , an additional feature along the defect line at mid - level of the step is recognized . since two stacked @xmath41 rings in the unit cell",
    "are displaced sideways with respect to each other in the graphite crystal , this half - step may correspond to an individual graphite layer that protrudes laterally underneath the top layer . at a distance of a few nm from the step line ,",
    "the profile is essentially flat .",
    "this is expected as the two planes correspond presumably to equivalent crystal surfaces that differ by one unit cell in height . however , as the trace on the higher level approaches the step , a pronounced steepening of the slope is observed .",
    "since the scan direction was chosen to be parallel to the step line , it can not be argued that this feature is due to tip overshoot .",
    "rather , because the experiment is inherently incapable of discriminating between topological features and changes of the density of states , the observed steepening of the contour line may more likely be associated with an increase of the local density of states on the carbon atoms as the topology approaches the grain boundary .",
    "the apparent topology of the second line defect is distinctly different .",
    "the section profile registers a sharp , symmetric peak that has an apparent height , @xmath47 nm , and an apparent width of @xmath48 nm . at higher resolution ( fig .",
    "[ stm](b ) , showing a constant - height scan of a similar defect on the same sample surface ) the defect structure is disclosed in more detail .",
    "as recognized in the overview ( inset ) the defect line appears as three collinear stripes .",
    "these are no tip artifacts since they do not depend on the relative orientation between the defect line and the scan direction .",
    "the high resolution micrograph reveals that the corrugation is associated with individual surface atoms and that the lattice orientation differs on both sides of the central spine .",
    "the apparent height of the features with the highest elevations  truncated in the grey level scale which was chosen to better visualize the atomic lattice on the surrounding crystal faces  is about a factor of two larger than an atomic diameter .",
    "it is thus likely that an increase in the density of states on atoms near the grain boundary contribute to the appearance of these corrugations . without a clean discrimination of topological and density - of - state features , however ,",
    "it can not in this case be decided with confidence whether or not the observed defects correspond simply to lines of atoms that decorate the grain boundary .",
    "a high - resolution characterization of step - type line defects is presented in the lower half of fig .",
    "panels ( c ) and ( d ) show the vicinity of the defect shown in fig .",

    "[ stm ] ( b ) , the images show the surface at atomic resolution .",

    "again , the constant - current micrograph  fig .  [ stm](c )  indicates a step height of @xmath50 nm ( section profile on the right ) .",
    "both micrographs reveal clearly a misorientation of the lattices on both sides of the defect line of @xmath51 . on the higher level  to the left ",
    "the main lattice direction meets the grain boundary at @xmath52 , characteristic of a  zigzag \" edge .",
    "by contrast , one would expect this angle to be @xmath53 for an  armchair \" edge . in distinction from an earlier report @xcite , where  zigzag \"",

    "it is characterized by a vast overshooting of the section profile at the locations of the edge carbon atoms , _",
    "c.f . _ pseudo-3d representation on the right of fig .",
    "[ stm](d ) .",
    "while we reiterate that a clean distinction of topological and density - of - state features is not afforded in our measurements , we may note that the observed effect can not easily be accounted for by the sample topology or elasticity effects @xcite .",
    "for example , we consider it unrealistic that a decoration of the grain boundary with atoms ( of an ordinary  low  density of states at the fermi level ) should be responsible for the observed giant corrugations .",
    "rather , a large increase of the local density of states at the atom positions near the edge must be invoked to explain the observations .",
    "this is also hinted by the deviation of the section profile in the overview scan , fig .",
    "[ stm ]  ( a ) , from a planar topology near the step .",

    "it is also interesting to compare the magnetism found in graphite with that in the high - temperature itinerant ca@xmath76la@xmath77b@xmath78 ferromagnet @xcite where either quantum localization effects @xcite or an excitonic mechanism @xcite are invoked to explain the observed weak ferromagnetism with a curie temperature of 600  k . in graphite",
    "the low - temperature ferromagnetic magnetization at saturation is @xmath79emu / g .",
    "this value can be translated in terms of the magnetic moment @xmath80 per majority carrier similar to @xmath81 found in ca@xmath76la@xmath77b@xmath78 . according to ref .",
    "@xcite the ferromagnetism in graphite and hexaborides can have the same origin .",
    "direct experimental evidence supporting an excitonic mechanism for the fm found in hopg is , however , still lacking .",
    "we have studied the magnetization of several hopg , kish graphite and natural graphite samples with different content of magnetic impurities .",
    "our results rule out that ferromagnetic impurities can be responsible for the observed magnetic effects in hopg and kish graphite .",
    "the magnetization at saturation remains practically temperature - independent up to 500  k. this behavior is in clear contrast to that found in natural graphite samples with at least two orders of magnitude larger concentration of fe - impurities .",
    "the results of natural graphite reveal the superparamagnetic behavior of fe impurities in the carbon matrix .",
    "long - time annealing at 700  k and 800  k in vacuum of the hopg samples affects the hysteresis loops only weakly .",
    "the origin of the fm in hopg is not yet clear .",
    "we have discussed two possible origins in this work .",
    "topological defects can contribute to the peculiarities of the graphite electronic properties and may give rise to ferromagnetic correlations .",
    "also , the strong coulomb interaction between electrons in graphite ( due to the small electronic density ) should play an important role in all the observed magnetic properties of graphite .",
    "however , details of the long - range itinerant ferromagnetic order remain unclear .",
    "the discovery of ferromagnetism in oxidized c@xmath82 @xcite as well as in polymerized rhombohedral c@xmath82 @xcite indicates that carbon - based materials can be ferromagnetic without metallic components at high temperatures .",
    "therefore , it should be no surprise if graphite itself shows weak ferromagnetic signals .",
    "future work should try to ( a ) enhance the ferromagnetic signals by an appropriate mixing of graphite with other elements ( an enhancement of the superconducting signal has been recently achieved mixing graphite with sulfur @xcite ) , ( b ) increase the defect concentration as well as ( c ) prove experimentally the existence of an excitonic gap .",
