    "[ sect.introduction ]    bonds between carbon atoms are among the strongest chemical bonds that are free to rotate , subject only to the steric and electrostatic interactions between bound substituents",
    ". hydrocarbons and organic molecules often have small potential energy barriers to this rotation , allowing a molecule to freely change configuration as constituent atoms rotate  @xcite .",
    "the primary advantages of these molecular rotary joints , apart from their incredibly small size , are very low friction and zero wear .",
    "this phenomenon has enabled low - dissipation rotary motion in a number of recent nanoscale structures .",
    "for example , molecular machines with rotating or sliding joints have been created by various techniques , including traditional chemical synthesis  @xcite , manipulation of carbon nanotubes  @xcite , manipulation of graphene  @xcite , and the re - purposing biological motors  @xcite . in theory ,",
    "molecular machines using carbon bonds include planetary gearboxes  @xcite , flywheels for energy storage  @xcite , and mechanical computers  @xcite . such nanomachines will require large - scale atomically precise manufacturing , which is a challenging problem that is as yet unsolved in the general case .",
    "a key performance measure for molecular machines is their energy dissipation .",
    "unfortunately , experimental measurements are often difficult to obtain , and impossible for molecular machines that can not yet be fabricated .",
    "computational studies are a reasonable alternative for evaluating and optimizing designs for various applications .",
    "conceptually , estimating dissipation for a molecular machine is straightforward : simulate the machine s behavior over enough time for energy introduced into the machine s operational degrees of freedom to irreversibly transfer to many other degrees of freedom .",
    "unfortunately , such computational studies are challenging for machines with many atoms and when the machine s operation is only weakly coupled to other atoms , leading to low friction and long damping times . simulating such machines long enough to observe this damping may not be feasible , even for machines operating in vacuum , where the absence of gas or solvent molecules greatly reduces the computational cost .",
    "moreover , even if simulating a single design is feasible , identifying low - power designs may require examining many machine variants , leading to a computationally costly overall design task .",
    "one approach to reduce the computation time is to simulate the machine at speeds well above the typical thermal speed of the machine s motion . in this case ,",
    "thermal fluctuations are relatively small , allowing definite estimates of damping directly from the change in speed , even over times short compared to the damping time .",
    "for example , this approach has been applied to determine friction in nested nanotubes  @xcite . however",
    ", this method may not apply to large molecular machines intended to operate near or below thermal speeds .",
    "this is because the machine may behave very differently at low and high speeds .",
    "for instance , machines at high speeds could involve forces strong enough to significantly distort components from their low - speed geometries or , at worst , possibly break chemical bonds .",
    "more generally , high - speed operation may excite high - frequency vibrational modes that would not be relevant at intended operational speeds , thereby significantly overestimating the damping the machine would experience at its intended operating speed .    to address this challenge",
    ", this paper presents a method for estimating friction in molecular machines from simulations much shorter than the damping time of the machine , and when operating at speeds comparable to or less than thermal speeds . instead of measuring the damping directly from the decreasing energy during the simulation",
    ", this approach uses the fluctuations in the motion to infer the friction from the fluctuation - dissipation theorem .",
    "this paper describes this fluctuation - based method and illustrates it with two examples .",
    "the first , rotating nested nanotubes , has been studied extensively and allows comparison with direct estimation of dissipation from the decrease of the energy . in this case , the relatively small number of atoms and high dissipation make both the direct and fluctuation - based methods feasible with modest computational cost .    the second example is a hypothetical molecular rotor using acetylenic bonds .",
    "these bonds give exceptionally low rotary friction , and thereby would require simulating the machines over long times to reliably measure dissipation directly .",
    "moreover , including enough atoms around those bonds to capture interactions with the rotor s housing requires considering a significantly larger number of atoms than used for the nanotube example .",
    "thus this rotor is an example where the fluctuation - based method is a significant benefit .",
    "specifically , after discussing related studies , section  [ sect.drag estimate ] describes the fluctuation - based method .",
    "we then present the two examples .",
    "the concluding section discusses future directions for applying the method and its possible limitations .",
    "the appendix provides details of the simulations .",
    "[ sect.related work ]    several studies have used molecular dynamics ( md ) simulations to investigate friction in nanomachines with sliding or rotating components .    in @xcite , four different md simulation configurations using the lammps code and airebo force field were used to obtain consistent friction estimates for a rotating nested nanotube bearing . other dissipation estimates for rotating nested nanotube bearings",
    "have been determined using intralayer interactions based on the brenner potential @xcite with interlayer interactions based on the kolmogorov - crespi registry - dependent potential  @xcite , and with the compass force field  @xcite .",
    "dissipation estimates for _ linear _ sliding nested nanotube bearings have been determined using a custom force field and custom numerical simulator in @xcite , and a custom force field based on @xcite and the r - respa integrator in @xcite .",

    "in addition to the relatively simple cases of nested nanotubes and graphene - graphene sliding , md studies evaluated more complex nanomachines .",
    "one example is a study of meshing gears made from functionalized carbon nanotubes  @xcite using the brenner potential  @xcite . in @xcite",
    "a complex molecular planetary gear mechanism is analyzed using the uff forecefield and gasteiger partial charges . in @xcite a custom integrator is used with a custom force field based on charmm and amber force fields , with partial charges determined by _ ab initio _ calculations , to model the behavior of the experimentally realized  nanocars \"  @xcite rolling on a gold surface .",
    "an experimental and md study measured the energy required to force rotation of a sterically - congested molecular bond in a surface - bound molecule  @xcite .",
    "the work to rotate one bond was @xmath2 .",
    "the energy barrier involved in rotating the bond in this molecule is much larger than that of the rotary joint presented in this paper .",
    "all of this energy is not necessarily dissipated since much could be recovered by a properly designed mechanism .",
    "nevertheless , this study provides an upper bound on the energy dissipated , and also indicates the work that would need to be supplied and , ideally , recovered for a single rotation .",
    "[ sect.drag estimate ]    a physical system used as a machine distinguishes a few operational dynamic properties from other degrees of freedom of the machine and its environment .",
    "conservative forces , derived from potential energy gradients , may impede the machine s motion .",
    "but they do not by themselves account for dissipation : energies associated with conservative forces can , in principle , be recovered during cyclic operation . on the other hand , friction is a dissipative force arising from random thermal interactions among the atoms of the machine and its environment .",
    "these interactions dissipate organized energy in the machine s motion into heat , and appear as a damping force .",
    "the distinction between conservative and dissipative forces is important for evaluating dissipation  @xcite .",
    "[ sect.stochastic model ]    this paper considers rotary bearings which , ideally , have a single operational degree of freedom : rotation about a fixed axis .",
    "a molecular rotary joint can approximate this behavior  @xcite , with additional degrees of freedom providing rapidly fluctuating torques on the rotation , i.e. , a thermal bath .",
    "these torques produce a drag on the rotor .",

    "@xcite : @xmath4 the first term on the right - hand side is a frictional damping torque , with characteristic damping time @xmath5 . the second term describes conservative torques , arising from a potential energy @xmath6 depending on the rotor s orientation angle @xmath7 . for the machines considered in this paper , torques arising from the potential",
    "are relatively small .",
    "the final term , @xmath8 , denotes independent normally - distributed fluctuating torques with zero mean and standard deviation @xmath9 over a time interval @xmath10 .",

    "this drag is commonly expressed in terms of the rotational frictional drag coefficient , @xmath15 , defined by the relation @xmath16 , so that @xmath17 .",
    "this drag dissipates energy at the rate @xmath18 .",
    "the energy dissipated due to this friction when rotating by angle @xmath19 at a uniform speed is @xmath20 . if this rotation takes place over time @xmath21 , then @xmath22 and the dissipation is @xmath23    when operating at temperature @xmath24 , the fluctuation - dissipation theorem  @xcite relates the damping and fluctuation parameters , @xmath25 and @xmath26 .",
    "specifically , the equilibrium variance of @xmath3 described by eq .",
    "( [ eq.l stochastic ] ) is @xmath27  @xcite . when at thermal equilibrium , this variance equals the square of the thermal angular momentum , @xmath28 . from the equipartition theorem",
    "@xcite , the average rotational kinetic energy is @xmath29 , so @xmath30 .",
    "thus @xmath31 relates the size of the fluctuations to the damping constant .",
    "[ sect.validity ]    eq .",
    "( [ eq.l stochastic ] ) is an approximate model of a molecular rotor .",
    "using this model to estimate drag requires identifying conditions under which the model is an adequate approximation .",
    "in particular , the model assumes drag is linearly proportional to angular momentum and the motions of the other degrees of freedom of the machine provide uncorrelated random torques on the rotor s angular momentum .    in general",
    ", the drag can have a nonlinear dependence on the speed .",
    "such nonlinearity can be significant at high speeds , e.g. , close to the speed of sound in the structure or involving forces large enough to break bonds .",
    "on the other hand , at sufficiently low speeds , the linear term dominates in a taylor expansion of the drag as a function of speed . as one comparison , the speed of sound in diamond is about @xmath32 , whereas the examples in this paper involve rotation of carbon molecules with radius @xmath33 at up to angular velocities of @xmath34 , with corresponding speed @xmath35 .",
    "the second assumption , uncorrelated random torques from other degrees of freedom , fails at sufficiently short time scales .",
    "for example , brief tilts of the rotor axis or oscillating normal modes of the housing could introduce short correlations in torques applied to the rotor .",
    "applying eq .",
    "( [ eq.l stochastic ] ) requires that these correlation times are short compared to times relevant for machine operation and , in particular , the damping time .",
    "this requires a significant separation in time scales between the rotary degree of freedom and other motions .",
    "molecular machines can achieve this with strongly bonded atoms throughout the structure except the parts intended to rotate , which instead have relatively weak interactions .",
    "thus we expect the stochastic model to apply to rotors operating at sufficiently low speeds and for sufficiently long times .",
    "we identify an appropriate time scale by comparing the standard deviation of changes in the rotor s angular momentum over different time scales @xmath10 .",
    "specifically , consider @xmath36 , the change in angular momentum starting at a time @xmath21 . from a sample of the angular momenta , we compute @xmath37 , the standard deviation of the changes @xmath38 at various times @xmath21 in this sample , as a function of @xmath10 . provided",
    "@xmath10 is short compared to the damping time @xmath5 and the potential has only a small effect , the fluctuation term of eq .",
    "( [ eq.l stochastic ] ) dominates the changes , so @xmath39 .",
    "thus , when the model applies , the ratio @xmath40 from the simulations should be nearly independent of @xmath10 .",
    "we evaluate this behavior with a `` fluctuation plot '' of this ratio vs.  @xmath10 .",
    "the times @xmath10 achieving this independence indicates the time scale at which the molecular machine behaves approximately as a thermally - driven rotor .",
    "another check on the model validity is comparing the power spectrum of the angular momentum with that of the stochastic process of eq .",
    "( [ eq.l stochastic ] ) using parameters estimated from simulations of the rotor behavior .",
    "frequencies with a close match indicate corresponding times over which the model is a good approximation . in our cases",
    ", we find the time scales determined from power spectra are similar to those from fluctuation plots .",
    "[ sect.md simulation ]    we evaluated rotational drag with molecular dynamics simulations .",
    "these simulations have two stages : `` warmup '' and `` spin - down '' .",
    "the warmup stage starts by adjusting the initial geometry to an energy minimum without constraints on any part of the structure .",
    "next , we impose boundary conditions , i.e. , fix the positions of a specific subset of the atoms . this simulation starts the system at zero temperature and couples it to a temperature bath at @xmath0 .",
    "we run the warmup simulation long enough bring the atoms to this temperature .",
    "the spin - down stage starts with a warmed up configuration and adds velocities to the atoms of the rotary component to give it a specified initial angular velocity @xmath41 .",
    "we then simulate the system in isolation , i.e. , without coupling to a thermal bath .",
    "this is appropriate for the machines considered here , operating in vacuum , because the system is not in intimate contact with a thermal reservoir .",
    "we repeat this procedure , with different random seeds , to obtain multiple samples of the behavior .",
    "appendix  [ sect.gromacs details ] describes the simulation procedure in more detail .      the simplest approach to estimating the damping @xmath25 is to average angular momenta over multiple simulations , since eq .",
    "( [ eq.l stochastic ] ) implies the average decays exponentially : @xmath42 .",
    "however , as discussed in section  [ sect.introduction ] , this direct approach may not be feasible for molecular machines containing many atoms and with low dissipation",
    ".    on the other hand , fluctuations in the angular momentum are readily apparent in simulations over relatively short times .",
    "thus we can use short simulations to estimate the fluctuation parameter @xmath26 and then determine the damping @xmath25 via eq .",
    "( [ eq.fluctuation dissipation ] ) .",
    "we do so by maximizing the likelihood of the observed changes in angular momentum over a fixed increment time @xmath10 , subject to the constraint of eq .",
    "( [ eq.fluctuation dissipation ] ) .",
    "the second derivative of the log - likelihood at the maximum gives approximate confidence intervals for the estimated values .    in this fluctuation - based method ,",
    "the choice of @xmath10 is somewhat arbitrary within a broad range . on the one hand",
    ", @xmath10 must be large enough that eq .",
    "( [ eq.l stochastic ] ) is a good approximation for the rotor , as discussed in section  [ sect.validity ] . on the other hand , @xmath10",
    "must be short compared to the overall simulation time to have enough samples for estimation .",
    "as illustrated with the examples discussed below , this approach can estimate damping with simulation times short compared to the rotor s damping time even when operating at speeds comparable to thermal motion , so fluctuations are relatively large .",
    "for such situations , the fluctuation - based approach is computationally less costly than running simulations long enough to directly estimating damping with similar confidence .    in general , eq .",
    "( [ eq.l stochastic ] ) does not have a simple solution .",
    "in such cases , evaluating the likelihood requires sampling the stochastic process or numerically solving its fokker - planck equation  @xcite .",
    "however , if the variation in the rotation potential @xmath43 is small compared to thermal energies , the potential can be neglected , which greatly simplifies the estimation . in particular , when @xmath43 is independent of the rotation angle , eq .",

    "the relatively small number of atoms in the nanotubes and their short damping time allow feasible simulations to show significant damping , even at relatively low rotation speeds , comparable to thermal speeds . this nanotube system thus provides a test case to compare damping estimated directly from the decrease in angular momentum with that estimated from fluctuations over a time scale much shorter than the damping time .",

    "these assemblies have few enough atoms to allow feasible dft calculations , while including most of the interactions between the rotor and the housing .",
    "we further reduced the cost by only evaluating the highly symmetric eclipsed and staggered conformations of the assemblies described in appendix  [ sect.assemblies ] .",
    "these conformations correspond to the extrema of the potential evaluated with gromacs in appendix  [ sect.potential details ] . evaluating just these two cases is sufficient to compute the potential barrier , i.e. , as the difference in energy between the eclipsed and staggered geometries of the joint .",

    "the calculated barrier between eclipsed and staggered geometries is well below @xmath49 at the temperature we consider .",

    "molecular mechanics force fields using resp charges are of inherently lower accuracy than dft methods  @xcite .",
    "it is therefore not surprising that gromacs overestimates the rotational barrier since the barrier predicted by dft is extremely small .",
    "the larger barrier calculated by gromacs may be due to interactions in the full structure modeled by gromacs that are not present in the smaller structures modeled by dft , such as strain induced by the housing or long range interactions between resp charges .",
    "regardless of the origin of the discrepancy , a barrier height of @xmath57 is comparable to values reported for smaller molecules with similar rotational structure , e.g. , @xmath58 for internal rotation in ethane and @xmath59 for 2-butyne  @xcite ."
