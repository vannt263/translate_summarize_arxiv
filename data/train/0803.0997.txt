    "the most straight - forward information that can be derived from extra - galactic radio sky surveys are the radio source counts , which have been extensively studied in the last three decades @xcite . if space was euclidian , and there was no cosmic evolution of radio sources , then the differential source counts would follow a power law with exponent of @xmath9 ( see e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "hence , the observed slope ( and the change of the slope ) of the radio source counts in different flux density ranges provides an insight , although quite indirect , into the global properties of extra - galactic radio sources , and their cosmic evolution .",
    "past studies have shown that at 1.4  ghz flux densities above @xmath10  mjy the source counts are dominated by radio - loud agn with luminosities above the fanaroff  & riley ( 1974 ; fr ) break ( @xmath11  w  hz@xmath12 ; @xcite ) .",
    "decreasing from about @xmath13  mjy to @xmath14  mjy , the source counts follow a power law ( e.g.   @xcite ) , and are mostly made up of radio - loud objects with luminosities below the fr break ( fr class  i sources ) .",
    "however , the differential source counts change their slope again , i.e.  they flatten below 1  mjy , and these sub - mjy radio sources have often been interpreted as a rising new population of objects , which does not contribute significantly at higher flux densities ( e.g.  @xcite ) .    to date the exact composition of this faint radio population ( hereafter population mix )",
    "is not well determined , and it is rather controversial .",
    "@xcite suggested that the majority of sub - mjy radio sources are faint blue galaxies , presumably undergoing significant star formation .",
    "optical spectroscopy , obtained by @xcite , supported this idea , and the source counts at faint levels were successfully modeled with a population of intermediate - redshift star forming galaxies @xcite .",
    "however , spectroscopic results by @xcite suggested that early - type galaxies were the dominant population at sub - mjy levels .",
    "further , it was recently suggested and modeled that the flattening of the source counts may be caused by radio - quiet agn ( radio - quiet quasars and type 2 agn ) , rather than star forming galaxies @xcite ; observations support this interpretation @xcite . based from the combination of optical and radio morphology as an identifier for agn and sf galaxies",
    ", @xcite suggested that at most @xmath15 of the sub - mjy radio sources are comprised of agn , while @xcite indicated that this fraction may be @xmath16 ( the latter based their sf / agn classification on a combination of optical morphologies , x - ray luminosities , and radio  to  optical flux density ratios of their radio sources ) .",
    "two main reasons exist for such discrepant results .",
    "first , the identification fraction of radio sources with optical counterparts , which is generally taken to be representative of the full radio population , spans a wide range in literature ( 20% to 90% ) depending on the depth of both the available radio and optical data , as well as the passband used ( e.g.  a larger fraction of radio sources are associated with nir than optical data ; see ) .",
    "second , the methods that were used to separate agn from sf galaxies have been very heterogeneous in the past , ranging from pure radio luminosity or morphology cuts , through observed color properties to optical spectroscopy .",
    "the two main populations of radio sources in deep radio surveys at 1.4  ghz ( 20  cm ) are active galactic nuclei and star forming galaxies @xcite . at this frequency",
    "the radio emission predominantly arises from synchrotron emission powered either by accretion onto the central super - massive black hole ( smbh ) or by supernovae remnants ( e.g.  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* note that both mechanisms may be at work in a given galaxy ) ) .",
    "it was shown that radio properties such as the distributions of mono - chromatic luminosities of sf and agn galaxies ( seyferts , liners ) are comparable and overlapping ( at least locally ; e.g.   @xcite ) .",
    "hence , in order to disentangle sf and agn galaxies in the radio regime , observations at other wavelengths are required .",
    "studies of extra - galactic radio sources in the _ local universe _ ( @xmath17 ) have been invigorated due to the recent advent of panchromatic photometric and spectroscopic all - sky surveys , such as e.g.  nvss @xcite , first @xcite , sdss @xcite , iras @xcite , 2df @xcite which provide additional panchromatic photometric ( e.g.  @xcite ) and/or optical - ir spectroscopic ( e.g.   @xcite ) observations .",
    "for example , the panchromatic properties of radio sources were studied to full detail @xcite , as well as the environmental dependence of radio luminous agn and sf galaxies @xcite , and their luminosity function @xcite .",
    "further , radio emission as a star formation rate indicator was well calibrated using a local sample @xcite and compared to other star formation tracers @xcite .",
    "however , it still remains to uncover the global properties of the _ intermediate - redshift _",
    "( @xmath0 ) radio sources .",
    "for example , the cosmic star formation history of the universe ( i.e.  the global star formation rate per unit comoving volume as a function of redshift ) was not determined with a high accuracy using radio data ( see e.g.  @xcite ) , the radio luminosity function for sf and agn galaxies at @xmath18 is not known , and the exact composition of the sub - millijansky radio population is still unknown and a matter of debate @xcite .    in this work and in a number of accompanying papers , we will focus on these properties of radio sources using the 1.4  ghz vla - cosmos survey @xcite .",
    "the main aim of the current paper is twofold .",
    "first , we develop a method based only on  photometric data to efficiently separate sf from agn galaxies in the vla - cosmos 20  cm survey .",
    "secondly , we use this classification to derive the composition of the sub - mjy radio population . in",
    "we describe the cosmos  data , and in  we present the cross - correlation of the sources detected at 1.4  ghz with catalogs at other wavelengths . in  we describe our source classification methodology and introduce our  ( see below ) , which we calibrate and extensively test using a large well - characterized sample of local galaxies .",
    "we present the classification of the vla - cosmos 1.4  ghz radio sources with identified optical counterparts in , and in  we compare our  with other classification schemes proposed in the literature . in  we study the population mix in the vla - cosmos radio survey , based on the entire sample of vla - cosmos radio sources .",
    "we summarize our results in .    throughout the paper",
    "we report magnitudes in the ab system , and assume the following cosmology : @xmath19 .",
    "we define the radio synchrotron spectrum as @xmath20 , and assume @xmath21 if not stated otherwise .",
    "hereafter , we refer to our method to classify the vla - cosmos radio sources into five sub - types of objects ( star candidate , qso , agn , sf , high - z galaxy ) as _ `` classification method '' _ , and to our method to disentangle only the sf from agn galaxies , based on rest - frame color properties , as _ `` rest - frame color based selection method''_.",
    "in this section we describe the cosmos  data used for the work presented here .",
    "the cosmos field was observed at @xmath22  ghz ( @xmath23  cm ) with the nrao very large array ( vla ) in a- and c- configuration ( vla - cosmos large project ; for details see @xcite ) .",
    "the final map , encompassing 2 , has a resolution of @xmath24 , and a mean @xmath25 of @xmath26 $ ]  @xmath27jy / beam in the central 1  [ 2 ] .",
    "the vla - cosmos source catalog reports the peak and total ( i.e integrated ) flux density for each object . for extended sources the total flux density is derived by integrating over the object s size ( see @xcite for details ) , while for unresolved sources it is set to be equal to the peak flux density . @xcite",
    "have shown that bandwidth smearing effects ( i.e.   chromatic aberration ) , combined with the pointing layout of the vla - cosmos observations , systematically decrease the measured source s peak flux density to @xmath28 of its true value , while the total flux density remains unaffected . therefore , to correct for this , all peak flux densities in the catalog need to be increased by 25% .",
    "however , such an effect further entails a necessary re - definition of the sources in the field considered to be unresolved ( cf .",
    "fig .  14 in @xcite and fig .  2 in @xcite ) .",
    "therefore , to properly correct for bandwidth smearing effects , we have re - selected the unresolved sources following @xcite , and set their total flux densities to be 1.25 times their peak ( respective integrated ) flux densities . throughout the paper",
    "we will use the integrated flux density , corrected for bandwidth smearing where needed , as the representative flux density for each source .    in order to minimize the number of possible spurious radio sources ( @xmath29 below @xmath30 )",
    ", we select only objects from the catalog that were detected at a signal to noise of @xmath31 , and are located outside regions contaminated by side - lobes from nearby bright sources .",
    "this yields  ( out of @xmath32 ; i.e.  @xmath33 ) sources , 78 of which consist of multiple components .",

    "we follow exactly the same calibration method as described in @xcite : a ) a calibration of the photometric zero - points , and b ) an optimization of the template seds ( spectral energy distributions ) .",
    "this calibration method allows us to remove systematic offsets in the estimates of the photometric redshifts . a direct comparison between the photometric redshifts and the zcosmos spectroscopic redshifts shows that the photometric redshifts reach an accuracy of @xmath76 at @xmath77 .",
    "the fraction of catastrophic failures is less than 1% at @xmath77 .",
    "such an accuracy and robustness can be achieved thanks to both the intermediate bands and deep nir photometric data .",
    "the photometric redshifts for the entire cosmos population will be described in full detail in @xcite .",
    "the galaxies in the sample used here are radio selected , i.e.  they are not randomly drawn from the global cosmos population .",
    "therefore , in  we show the comparison of the photometric and spectroscopic redshifts for a sub - sample of our vla - cosmos sources with available spectroscopy ( see next section ) .",
    "the accuracy is @xmath78 , which is somewhat lower than the accuracy for the full sample of cosmos sources , however it is still satisfactory .",
    "as photometric redshift codes generally take into account only galaxy sed models , the photometric redshifts for broad line agn are usually poorly estimated ( not better than @xmath79 with a large fraction of catastrophic outliers and no solutions found beyond @xmath80 ) , and alternative ways for their redshift computations have to be applied . at the time of writing , no accurately estimated photometric redshifts for broad line agn exist for the cosmos project .",
    "the photometric redshifts for broad line agn will be presented in a future publication @xcite .",
    "the ongoing cosmos optical spectroscopic surveys @xcite provide to date @xmath81 spectra , with good redshift estimates , for objects in the vla - cosmos 1.4  ghz radio sample described in .",

    "thus , a total of @xmath87 spectra is available .",
    "however , as a number of sources were spectroscopically observed multiple times , we have spectroscopic information for @xmath88 unique sources in our radio sample . throughout the paper ,",
    "we use the spectroscopic redshifts , where available .",
    "we also use this sub - set of radio sources with observed optical spectra as a control sample to verify the presented .",
    "in this section we define the _ matched radio source sample _ , a sample of radio sources with optical counterparts cross - correlated with the panchromatic cosmos observations , as well as the _",
    "remaining radio source sample _ , both of which will be used throughout the paper .",
    "first , we restrict the full vla - cosmos radio source sample to objects which have optical counterparts ( sec .  [",
    "sec : ccradio - opt ] ) .",
    "then we positionally match these objects with sources detected in the mir ( sec .",
    "[ sec : ccradio - opt - spitzer ] ) and x - ray ( sec .",
    "[ sec : ccradio - opt - x ] ) spectral ranges . in sec .",
    "[ sec : cc_no - counterparts ] we describe the remaining radio sources that are either without identified or with identified but flagged optical counterparts .",
    "the vla - cosmos large project source catalog contains  radio sources detected at a signal to noise @xmath31 and outside side - lobe - contaminated regions ( see ) .",
    "@xmath89 of these consist of multiple components . for the purpose of this paper",
    "we match these radio sources with sources that have also been detected in the optical regime , and are reported in the cosmos photometric catalog @xcite . in order to obtain a sample with reliable radio - optical counterparts ,",
    "we positionally match the radio sources only with optical sources brighter than @xmath46 .",
    "the reason for this is illustrated in , where we show the distance between the radio sources and their nearest optical counterparts as a function of the @xmath90 band magnitude .",
    "as the median distance rapidly increases for @xmath91 ( most probably introducing a significant number of false match associations ) we apply a cut of @xmath46 to the nuv - nir photometric catalog before matching the radio and optical catalogs .",
    "hence , to find the corresponding optical counterpart for each radio source ( excluding multi - component sources , which are separately addressed below ) , we search for the nearest optical neighbor within a radial distance of @xmath92 .",
    "the search radius was chosen in such a way that it balances a high completeness of true matches and a low false - match contamination rate : a cut - off of @xmath92 essentially includes all true matches in the sample , with a false association rate ( computed from the source density in the matched catalogs ) of only @xmath93 .",
    "the high completeness and low contamination are due to the excellent astrometric accuracy of both the cosmos radio and optical data .",
    "our matching yielded 1749 radio sources with securely identified optical counterparts .",
    "however , 252 ( @xmath94 ) of these are located in masked - out regions ( i.e.   around bright saturated stars ) in the photometric catalog .",
    "thus , their nuv - nir photometry , as well as the photometric redshift computation has a significantly reduced accuracy .",
    "we exclude these objects from our main sample .",
    "the multi - component radio sources in the vla - cosmos survey consist of radio sources which could not be fitted using a single gaussian function ( see @xcite ) .",
    "the radio morphologies of such sources can be fairly complex ( e.g.  single or double lobed radio galaxies ) , and this makes it substantially more difficult to associate such radio sources with the appropriate optical counterparts ( see e.g.  @xcite ) . in order to avoid any biases",
    "which may be caused using an automatic association procedure , the optical counterparts of the vla - cosmos multi - component radio sources were determined visually .",
    "the 1.4  ghz catalog contains 78 multi - component sources detected at or above @xmath30 , and 65 were securely associated with an optical counterpart with @xmath95 , however 4 are located inside masked - out areas ( around bright saturated stars ) in the photometric catalog , and we therefore exclude them from the main sample .",
    "in summary , the applied matching criteria yield 1814 ( @xmath96 of the   radio sources with @xmath97 ) radio sources with secure optical counterparts down to @xmath46 , 65 of which are multiple component sources .",
    "the most accurate nuv - nir photometry ( i.e.  excluding flagged regions around saturated objects ) was obtained for  ( @xmath98 of 1814 ) ,  of which are multiple - component radio sources .",
    "hereafter , we refer to this latter sample of  radio sources , which make up @xmath99 of the radio sources with @xmath97 , and that were matched to the nuv - nir catalog , as the _ matched radio source sample_. for reference , the 1.4  ghz total flux density distributions for the complete radio sample , the matched radio sample , and the sub - sample with available spectroscopy is shown in the top panel in .",
    "the distribution of the @xmath90 band magnitude for the matched radio sample , as well as the spectroscopic sub - sample , is shown in the bottom panel in .",
    "it is also worth noting that our cross - correlation is consistent with the results of the maximum likelihood ratio technique applied to vla - cosmos sources @xcite , however our restrictions for the masked - out regions in the photometric catalog , as well as the optical magnitude limit , are more conservative , as the analysis presented here strongly relies on accurate nuv to nir photometry .",
    "+    a further data set that we use in the analysis presented here is the hst / acs point - source information .",
    "we extract this information for each radio source in our matched sample by positionally matching the optical counterparts of the radio sources with point - sources identified in the hst / acs f814w source catalog @xcite . using a matching radius of @xmath92 yields 47 objects in our matched radio sample classified as point sources based on the hst / acs f814w images .",
    "the mean distance between the matched objects is only @xmath100 .",

    "a visual inspection of the 17 sources , classified as having ambiguous identifications by @xcite , strongly suggests that their most probable optical counterparts , reported in the x - ray  optical catalog , are real associations .",
    "hence , we proceed in our analysis taking all 179 x - ray detected point sources to be true counterparts of the objects in the matched radio sample .      in",
    "we have defined the matched radio sample which consists of  1.4  ghz sources that have optical counterparts out to an @xmath90 band magnitude of 26 , and within a radial distance of less than @xmath92 .",
    "these sources were also required to have the most accurate nuv - nir photometry , i.e.   counterparts within flagged regions due to saturation and blending effects in the nuv - nir images were excluded .",

    "based on poisson statistics and the source density of the mir sources , such a search radius essentially includes all true matches with a false contamination rate of @xmath103% .",
    "it is worth noting that more than one half of the remaining @xmath114 of the radio objects were independently identified as possible spurious sources , based on visual inspection , while the other half are either located in blended regions in the irac images or slightly further away than the allowed @xmath101 from the position reported in the irac catalog ( the morphology of the irac sources being often extended ) .",
    "thus , we consider these @xmath113 of radio  mir matches representative of the entire remaining radio population",
    ". out of the  sources 318 ( i.e.   @xmath115 ) have mips 24  detections ( @xmath116 ) , and 31 ( @xmath93 ) have xmm point source counterparts ( these 31 objects are a sub - sample of the 256 objects in the flagged regions ) . in",
    "we analyze the properties of these remaining sources , and their contribution to the population mix in the vla - cosmos survey .",
    "the summary of the   cross - correlation of the vla - cosmos radio sources is given in .",
    "extragalactic radio sources consist of two main populations : star forming and agn galaxies .",
    "we further divide the agn class into two sub - classes : qsos ( often unresolved in optical images , with broad emission lines in their spectra and high optical luminosity ) and objects where the agn does not dominate the entire sed , such as type 2 qsos , low - luminosity agn ( seyfert and liner galaxies ) and absorption - line agn ( resolved in optical images , with both broad , narrow or no emission lines in their optical spectra ) . throughout the paper",
    ", we will mostly refer to the latter sub - class only as agn. the commonly adopted and well - calibrated tool for disentangling sf galaxies from low - luminosity agn ( seyfert and liners ) is the optical spectroscopic diagnostic diagram @xcite , that is based on two emission line flux ratios ( [ oiii 5007]/h@xmath117 vs.  [ nii 6584]/h@xmath118 ; hereafter _ bpt diagram _ ; see also @xcite ) .",

    "we develop such a method ( hereafter  ) , which we apply in the next sections to identify sf and agn galaxies in the vla - cosmos matched radio sample .",

    "it is noteworthy to mention that given a ) the detection limits , and b ) the areal coverage of the nvss and vla - cosmos surveys , both surveys observe approximately the same populations of objects , although over different redshift intervals ( see fig .  1 in @xcite ) . assuming that evolutionary effects with redshift do not significantly alter the reliability of the identification method presented below , at least out to @xmath120 , this makes the local sample of galaxies representative of the galaxies in the vla - cosmos matched radio sample .",
    "based on _ spectral line _ properties we separate the local sample into three classes of objects : _ agn , star - forming galaxies and composite objects _",
    ", where the latter are considered to have a comparable contribution of both star formation and agn activity .",
    "first , galaxies _ with emission lines in their spectra _ are separated into these three classes using their position in the bpt diagram ( see bottom panel in ) .",
    "second , as the galaxies that have _ no emission lines _ in their spectra can not be star forming ( see also  for a discussion of this point ) , and as all of the objects in the sdss / nvss sample are observed to have 1.4  ghz emission which arises either from agn or star formation activity in a galaxy , we define galaxies without emission lines in their spectra as agn ( see also @xcite who classified these types of objects as absorption line agn ) .      in the top panel in  we",
    "show the distribution of @xmath121 sdss / nvss emission line galaxies in the  rest - frame color - color diagram",
    ". the color code is determined by the position of a galaxy in this plane .",
    "the bottom panel shows the bpt diagram for the same galaxies with the colors adopted from the upper panel . for these radio luminous galaxies",
    ", a strong correlation exists between their rest - frame optical colors and emission line properties , in particular between  and .",
    "we want to stress that the sdss / nvss galaxies with no emission lines in their spectra have typically red  colors , with a median  value of 0.46 and an interquartile range of 0.13 ( see also e.g.  fig .  12 in @xcite ) .",
    "this implies that the rest - frame color  can be used as an efficient separator between agn and sf galaxies in samples where these two types of galaxies are the two dominant populations .",
    "@xcite argued that the  color is a proxy for the galaxies dust content , with higher values of  corresponding to higher dust attenuation .",
    "however , as the dynamic range of  is very narrow , we will rather base our selection on the  color alone .",
    "hereafter , based on a compromise between completeness and contamination of the photometrically selected samples of galaxies , we choose a color - cut of @xmath122  as the dividing photometric value between star forming galaxies ( @xmath123 ) and agn ( @xmath124 ) .",
    "given this boundary we infer that the sample of photometrically selected star forming galaxies is @xmath125 complete , and contaminated by agn and composite objects at the @xmath126 and @xmath127 levels , respectively .",
    "vice versa , the photometrically selected sample of agn is @xmath2 complete and contaminated by sf and composite galaxies at the @xmath128 and @xmath129 level , respectively ( see appendix  [ app : complfull ] for computational details ) .",
    "we will use these estimates in the following analysis to statistically correct the photometrically selected sf and agn samples in the vla - cosmos survey .",
    "one of the main advantages of radio observations is that the intrinsic physical properties that drive the radio emission can be derived without any need for dust - extinction corrections ( as radio emission passes freely through dust ) . in particular ,",
    "radio observations provide a dust - unbiased view of star - formation ( see @xcite for a review ; see also @xcite ) .",
    "hence , it is important to address whether our rest - frame color selection technique misses out dusty starburst galaxies . in order to do this",
    "we study a sub - sample of sdss / nvss galaxies that were also detected with the iras satellite at ir wavelengths .",
    "first we address the composition of the missed @xmath94 of the sf galaxies ( note that the photometrically selected sf galaxy sample is @xmath125 complete ) in order to show that our selection does not introduce biases against the most luminous starburst galaxies . about @xmath130 of the sf galaxies with @xmath124  have iras detections , which is consistent with the fraction of iras detections in the sf galaxy sample with @xmath123 .",
    "this suggests that the composition of the _ missed _ sf galaxies is not significantly different from the composition of the _ selected _ sf galaxies .",
    "second , the fractions of luminous and ultra - luminous ir galaxies ( lirgs and ulirgs ) in the spectroscopically classified sf galaxy samples with @xmath123  and @xmath124   appear to be consistent with each other . and third",
    ", the completeness and contamination of the sdss / nvss / iras galaxy sub - samples selected using the  is fairly consistent with the properties of the entire sdss / nvss sample ( see appendix  [ app : compl ] for details ) .",
    "all of this implies that the selection criteria for sf and agn galaxies adopted on the basis of the analysis of the full sdss / nvss sample works almost equally efficiently for the iras detected sub - sample .",
    "even further , only @xmath8 and @xmath131 of star forming lirgs and ulirgs galaxies , respectively , are omitted by the method ( see appendix  [ app : compl ] for details ) .",
    "it is noteworthy that in the entire sdss / nvss / iras sample only 48 objects ( i.e.  @xmath131 ) were identified as absorption line agn , i.e.  having no emission lines in their optical spectra .",
    "it is possible that very high dust obscuration may suppress the detection of emission lines in the optical spectrum .",
    "a visual search for signatures of hii regions in the 48 sdss color - composite images suggested that at the most @xmath130 of these galaxies may possibly be undergoing star formation ( e.g.  possible galaxy merger , or extended morphology ) .",
    "therefore , only a negligible fraction of less than @xmath132 of the sdss / nvss / iras galaxies may be so heavily dust - obscured that no emission lines would be detected in their optical spectra .    in order to test this issue",
    "further , we have synthesized the  color for the standard dusty starburst galaxies m  82 ( a typical lirg ) , and arp  220 ( the prototypical ulirg ) using spectral templates given by polletta et al .",
    "the optical to nir part of these templates was generated using the stellar population synthesis code grasil @xcite .",
    "the derived   colors for m  82 and arp  220 are 0.078 and 0.149 , respectively , implying that m  82 would not have been missed by the , while arp  220 , although close to the adopted limit in , still lies within our selection criterion ( note that in reality observational photometric errors of m  82- and arp  220- like objects will introduce a scatter in p1 ; see also ) .",
    "based on the tests presented above we conclude that our  is not significantly biased against dusty starburst galaxies .      in the previous section we have studied , and calibrated , the  using the local galaxy sample . assuming that evolutionary effects with redshift do not significantly affect the reliability of the classification",
    ", we can safely apply it to the galaxies in the vla - cosmos 1.4  ghz matched radio sample ( )   to separate sf from agn galaxies at intermediate redshifts .",
    "however , first we need to derive the rest - frame  color from the observed sed of the vla - cosmos galaxies .",
    "we do this via high - resolution sed fitting , described in , and we test the accuracy of the rest - frame color synthesis in .      in order to estimate the rest - frame color  for each galaxy in the matched radio sample that we do not classify as a star or qso ( see ) , we use the gossip (",
    "galaxy observed simulated sed interactive program ) software package @xcite , designed for fitting a galaxy s sed to a set of chosen spectral models .",
    "the sed of the galaxies in our sample , that we use for fitting , extends from @xmath133    to @xmath134 m ( comprised in 6 photometric pass - bands ) and we fit to each observed sed a realization of @xmath135 spectra built using the @xcite stellar synthesis evolutionary models .",
    "star formation histories have been parameterized by an underlying continuous star formation history ( decaying exponentially ) , and randomly superimposed bursts ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "we cover ages between @xmath13  myr and @xmath136  gyr , specific star formation rates ( star formation rate per unit galaxy stellar mass ) between @xmath56 yr@xmath12 and @xmath137 yr@xmath12 and metallicities from a tenth to twice solar . for each object in our sample the model spectra in our library are redshifted to the galaxy s measured redshift ( spectroscopic where available , otherwise photometric ) , then each spectrum is convolved with the observed filter response functioncapak / cosmos / filters ] , and then fitted to the available observed photometric data , using a direct @xmath73 minimization procedure .",
    "output parameters , such as e.g.  rest - frame colors , stellar mass or the 4000    break , are taken from the best fit model spectrum . in order to derive physically meaningful output parameters ,",
    "we restrict the fitting procedure to models that have an age smaller than that of the universe at the galaxy s redshift .",
    "the synthesized , relative to observed , colors and magnitudes for the vla - cosmos galaxies , computed as described above , are reproduced with a satisfying accuracy of @xmath138 and @xmath139 , respectively . to further test the accuracy of the derived rest - frame color , we synthesize p1 for a sample of @xmath140 local sdss / nvss galaxies . for these galaxies the p1 colors , computed from their spectrum ( with an accuracy of better than 0.03 magnitudes ; see @xcite ) , are also available .",
    "thus , comparing   synthesized via sed fitting with the reference  derived from the spectrum gives us a direct measure of the achieved accuracy , shown in  ( top panel ) .",
    "the root - mean - square - scatter is @xmath141 .    in the bottom panel in",
    "we show the difference of the  color as a function of the synthesized ( gossip )  color for the sdss / nvss galaxies .",
    "a slight systematic trend is present as a function of the derived  color .",
    "this trend presumably arises from the presence of strong emission lines in the galaxies seds ( in the rest - frame wavelength range that is used to derive ) , which are not taken into account in the bc03 model spectra . in our further analysis of the vla - cosmos data ,",
    "we use the median offset , shown in the bottom panel in , to correct the derived  color , and we consider the synthetic  color to be accurate to @xmath141  mag . however , an error of 0.1  mag for 68% of the galaxies , and 0.2 for 95% , may substantially alter the sf / agn selection , introducing the largest uncertainty for the galaxies that have  colors close to the chosen  boundary . to account for these uncertainties ,",
    "we simulate the  errors using a randomly drawn gaussian distribution with a standard deviation of 0.1 centered at zero ( see top panel in ) .",
    "these errors are then added to the galaxies   colors derived from the best fit template in the sed fitting , and the sf / agn selection ( see ) is applied . by repeating this procedure 10,000 times we obtain a robust statistical distribution of the number of selected sf and agn galaxies yielding @xmath142 sf and @xmath143 agn galaxies ( mean ) with a root - mean - square scatter of only @xmath144 . applying our sf / agn selection using the p1 distribution obtained from the best fit template in the sed fitting yields  sf and  agn galaxies ( see ) .",
    "thus , @xmath131 less sf galaxies are selected .",
    "this is easily understood as the blue tail of the  distribution contains a smaller number of galaxies than there are in the prominent red peak ( see e.g.   ) .",
    "therefore , a normal error distribution will systematically scatter more galaxies to the blue  region , than to the red one .",
    "we conclude that the photometric errors of the synthesized   color introduce a number uncertainty of @xmath131 in favor of sf galaxies .",
    "although @xmath131 is not significant , it is necessary to keep this bias in mind in the analysis of the population mix of submillijansky radio sources ( ) .",
    "in this section we present the classification of the entire vla - cosmos matched radio sample into star candidates ( ) , qsos ( ) , sf , agn and high - z galaxies ( ) .",
    "we begin with a summary of the sample definitions ( ) .      in  ( see also appendix  [ app : complmain ] ) we have presented the calibration and effectiveness of the  for separating _ galaxies _ dominated by star formation from those dominated by agn activity . for this",
    "we have used the sdss `` main '' spectroscopic sample  a pure _ galaxy _ sample that by definition does not contain any star - like objects @xcite .",
    "this , obviously , implies that the same effectiveness of the method can only be reached if the  is applied to a comparable sample , i.e.  _ galaxies only_. however , our vla - cosmos matched radio sample consists not only of galaxies , but also of stellar like sources , where the latter are either stars or quasi stellar objects ( qsos ) .",
    "therefore , we classify the sources in the matched radio sample into five sub - types  a ) star candidates , b ) quasi stellar objects ( qsos ) , c ) active galactic nuclei ( agn ) , d ) star forming ( sf ) , and e ) high redshift ( @xmath3 ; high - z ) galaxies .",
    "the latter three sub - types compose our _ `` vla - cosmos galaxy sample''_. the properties of each sub - type are summarized as follows .    * * stars : * point - sources in the optical , with their seds best fit using a stellar template . *",
    "* osqs : * point - sources in the optical ( stellar - like seds are excluded ; see above ) .",
    "this criterion essentially requires that the emission of the nucleus in the optical strongly dominates over the emission of the host galaxy .",
    "thus , this sample predominantly contains broad line agn ( i.e.   type-1 agn ) , with power law spectra in the optical . * * agn : * galaxies ( not point - sources ) whose rest - frame color properties are consistent with properties of agn (  @xmath124  , x - ray luminosity above @xmath145  erg  s@xmath12 if x - ray detected ) .",
    "this selection requires that the _ optical _ emission either shows signs of both , the emission from the central agn as well as the emission from the underlying host galaxy , or only the latter .",
    "thus , this sample essentially includes seyfert and liner types of galaxies , as well as absorption line agn , and we limit it to redshifts of @xmath146 . * * sf galaxies : * galaxies whose rest - frame color properties are consistent with properties of star forming galaxies (  @xmath123  ) .",
    "thus , the emission of these galaxies is dominated by the emission originating from regions of substantial star formation .",
    "this sample is also limited to redshifts @xmath147 . * * high - z galaxies * : galaxies ( not point - sources ) with redshifts beyond @xmath120 .      in order to identify star candidates in the vla - cosmos matched radio source sample , we make use of the cosmos stellar catalog @xcite , that was constructed from the hst / acs catalog @xcite using stellar templates to fit the entire sed of each source . in",
    "we show the color - color distribution for @xmath148 objects in the cosmos field securely classified as stars ( with photometric errors better than 0.05 ) , which form well defined loci in the broad - band color - color diagrams .",
    "cross - correlating our matched radio sample with the cosmos stellar catalog yields only 2 objects detected in the radio regime that are consistent with having stellar properties .",
    "the color properties of these objects are shown in . within the error - bars they are consistent with the main stellar loci .",
    "note , however , the -  color excess of one of the star candidates in the -  vs.  -  color - color diagram ( middle panel in ) , which suggests consistency with properties of e.g.  cataclysmic variables ( e.g.  @xcite ) , or unresolved binary star systems containing a white dwarf and a late type star ( e.g.   @xcite ) . the best fit stellar templates for these objects",
    "were taken from the phoenix library @xcite and represent dwarfs with effective temperatures in the range of 4100 to 5000  k and @xmath149 in the range of 3 to 3.5 .",
    "the 1.4  ghz total flux densities for these two objects are 126 and 152  @xmath52jy , and the corresponding @xmath90 band ab magnitudes are 25.34 and 23.28 , respectively .",
    "it is noteworthy that both objects have irac counterparts , but no associated x - ray emission .",
    "we consider these two sources to be star candidates , however a more detailed analysis ( using for example spectroscopy ) , which is beyond the scope of this paper , would be needed to verify this .",
    "such a low fraction of identified stars is consistent with star detection rates in other deep radio surveys ( e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "the two star candidates in our radio sample form only @xmath150 of the vla - cosmos radio sources , and we exclude them from our sample for further analysis .        in order to identify qsos in our matched radio sample we rely on an optical classification , rather than using x - ray emission , due to the much higher sensitivity of the observations in the optical ( @xmath30 sensitivity limit in the subaru @xmath90 band is 26.2 ; see @xcite ) .",
    "for example , if one would select agn relying purely on e.g.  x - ray  to  optical flux ratios , which are generally greater than 0.1 for both broad and narrow line agn ( e.g.   @xcite ) , with our optical limit of @xmath46 ( corresponding to  of @xmath151 ) the depth of the x - ray point - source detection would have to be about 2 orders of magnitude deeper than it currently is in order to select a complete sample of agn .",
    "further , a clear distinction between broad and narrow line agn would not be possible .",
    "hence , here we identify a qso by requiring that a given source in the matched radio sample is optically compact .",
    "in  we show the fitted @xmath90 band fwhm of the sources in the cosmos photometric catalog @xcite as a function of their @xmath90 band magnitude .",
    "point - sources ( black squares ) , selected from the hst / acs catalog @xcite , form a locus in this plane , separated from the area occupied by extended sources .",
    "however , the point - source locus is fairly scattered , especially at faint magnitudes , and thus makes a single automatic cut at a certain fwhm value inefficient .",
    "for this reason , we classify sources within the fwhm range of @xmath152 as qsos only if their optical hst morphology was visually confirmed to be point - source dominated. however , we consider _ all _ sources below fwhm of @xmath153 to be qsos .",
    "we further supplement this sample with 12 objects that were classified as point - sources in the hst / acs catalog , but do not satisfy the above criteria .    in summary , out of  objects we identify  ( i.e.  @xmath154 ) as qsos . in",
    "we show their broad - band ( , , , ) color - color properties .",
    "as expected , the non - stellar emission of the selected objects confines them to regions typical for qsos , which are separated from the main stellar loci in these diagrams ( e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "a minor fraction of these objects lie on the stellar loci .",
    "however , in the @xmath155 diagnostic diagram , which is an efficient tracer for stars @xcite these sources are offset from the stellar locus , verifying their non - stellar nature .",
    "as agn dominated systems usually have soft x - ray to optical flux ratios in the range of about @xmath156 to @xmath157 ( e.g.  @xcite ) , we can use the x - ray to optical flux properties of the identified qsos to further test our selection criteria .",
    "43 objects in our qso sample were detected as x - ray point - sources , and their x - ray to optical flux ratios are consistent with the expected values .",
    "the median  magnitude for these sources is 21.3 . for the remaining qso candidates , that were not detected in the x - rays ,",
    "the median  is 24.4 .",
    "therefore , these sources are also consistent with the expected x - ray to optical flux ratios , however beyond our x - ray point - source detection limit ( @xmath56  erg  @xmath57  s@xmath12 in the soft band ) .",
    "we conclude that the independent analysis of the x - ray properties of our selected qsos verifies the validity of our selection .",
    "a sub - sample of 31 objects of the  previously identified qsos have available optical spectroscopy with secure classifications @xcite , and only 3 of these objects were classified as red galaxies @xcite , while all the others have agn classifications .",
    "the 3 galaxies classified as ellipticals were identified as qso candidates by our method based on visual / morphologic classification , which suggests the presence of dominating nuclear emission .",
    "the color properties of two of theses objects ( see red crosses in the top panel in ) are also consistent with the color properties of quasars .",
    "thus , we conclude that the selected qso sample is not significantly ( @xmath158 ) affected by contamination of non - qso objects .    in order to assess the completeness of the selected qso sample , we search for objects that are spectroscopically classified as qsos and missed by our .",
    "our criteria yielded  objects classified as qsos in the matched radio sample , and in the remainder of the sample ( i.e.  the   sources that were not classified as star candidates or qsos ) spectroscopic classifications are available for 397 objects . out of these",
    ", 9 were spectroscopically classified as qsos .",
    "two sdss examples , for which cosmos hst / acs imaging is available , are shown in .",
    "they obviously show extended optical emission , and a substantial light component arises from the host galaxy itself .",
    "the median redshift of these 9 objects is only 0.4 .",
    "it is noteworthy that all of these objects have x - ray point source detections , and all except one have x - ray luminosities higher than @xmath145  erg  s@xmath12 .",
    "therefore these galaxies will be selected into our agn class , hence not contaminating the sf galaxy sample ( see ) . as the spectroscopic sub - sample fairly represents the full matched radio sample ( see ) ,",
    "we conclude , based on the above analysis , that the sample of identified qsos is about 80% complete . as expected , the incompleteness is mostly due to relatively low redshift , low - luminosity agn .      in the previous sections we have identified 2 star candidates and  qsos in the matched radio sample .",
    "we will refer to the  remaining sources in the matched radio source sample as the galaxy sample. before applying the  to our vla - cosmos galaxies in order to separate sf from agn galaxies , we restrict the galaxy sample to  galaxies with redshifts @xmath159 , as a ) the photometric redshifts are less reliable beyond this redshift , and b ) the library of bc03 model spectra that we use for the sed fitting may not be appropriate for fits beyond this redshift as the distribution of priors was set to optimally match this intermediate redshift range .",
    "hereafter , we will call the sample of  galaxies with redshifts greater than 1.3 high redshift ( high - z ) galaxies .",
    "we perform an sed fit using gossip ( as described in ) for each of the  objects in the matched radio galaxy sample out to @xmath120 .",
    "the distribution of the rest - frame color  for these galaxies is shown in .",
    "the distribution is very similar to that of the local sample ( see top panel in ) with a peak at @xmath160 ( agn ) and a prominent tail towards bluer values ( sf galaxies ) .",
    "we inspected the behavior of the median value of the synthesized  color for the entire @xmath146 galaxy sample as a function of redshift , and we found no significant evolution in the median color .",
    "we reached the same conclusion analyzing the median  colors of the sf and agn sub - populations .",
    "this implies that a fixed cut in the color can safely be applied to the entire galaxy population out to @xmath120 .",
    "the sed fitting was performed via a @xmath73 minimization procedure .",
    "the median value of the reduced @xmath73 of the sed fits , computed using the best fit model spectrum , is @xmath161 with an interquartile range of @xmath84 .",
    "only 10% of the fitted objects have reduced @xmath73 values above 5 , and only 5% above 10 .",
    "a visual inspection suggests that these galaxies are either nearby galaxies , which are resolved and often saturated in the subaru @xmath90 band , or qso contaminants .",
    "while the latter predominantly have blue  colors , the synthesized  color for the first class of galaxies still appears to be a valid tracer for the sf / agn separation , and therefore we do not reject them from the sample . in order to select sf and agn galaxies",
    "we require that the synthesized   color is @xmath123  and @xmath124  , respectively . however , to improve our selection at this point we make use of the x - ray properties in the soft band of the 114 galaxies that were detected as x - ray point sources .",
    "namely , if the soft x - ray luminosity of an object is greater than @xmath145  erg  s@xmath12 we consider it to be an agn , regardless of its  color .",
    "note that this criterion is expected to reduce the contamination of the sf sample by objects with blue rest - frame colors , such as qsos missed by our selection . out of the 114 x - ray",
    "detected sources , 77 have x - ray luminosities greater than the above given value , and 37 out of these 77 have a synthetic  color @xmath123  . in summary , our selection yields  sf and  agn galaxies in our matched radio galaxy sample with @xmath146 .",
    "we analyze these galaxies further in .",
    "in this section we compare our , that we have applied to an intermediate redshift population , with other classification methods used for both local and intermediate redshift populations in the literature @xcite .",
    "we also study the 24  properties of our radio sources , and their correlation to the 1.4  ghz emission .",
    "qsos , whose uv to nir continuum is dominated by a power law , tend to be redder than other types of galaxies in the mir . hence , they occupy a distinct region in mir color space , and several color - color criteria were suggested for their selection @xcite . in",
    "we compare our  with those proposed in the mir using a sub - sample of the matched radio sources that were also detected with irac ( @xmath162 have irac counterparts ; see ) .",
    "we indicate the qso ( dots ) , agn ( thin contours ) and star forming ( thick contours ) galaxies selected using our method .",
    "the dashed lines in the top and bottom panel in  show the color - color criteria proposed by @xcite and @xcite , respectively , for the selection of broad - line agn .",
    "as expected , the majority of objects selected as qsos by our method falls within this region , reassuring the efficiency of the  presented here .",
    "there are several qso candidates outside these regions , which is not surprising as the suggested quasar regions do not select a 100% complete sample of qsos , and a certain amount of outliers is expected ( see @xcite for a discussion of this point ) . in  we have inferred that our selected sample of qsos is not significantly contaminated by different types of objects , which is affirmed by this independent analysis .",
    "@xcite showed that at redshifts of @xmath102 galaxies span a large range in the @xmath163 color , which is consistent with the horizontal extent of our selected star forming and agn galaxies ( see bottom panel in ) .",
    "however , typical low luminosity agn and starburst galaxies can not be clearly divided using these diagnostic diagrams ( see also color evolutionary tracks in ) .",
    "nonetheless , elliptical galaxies ( which correspond to our class of absorption line agn ) tend to occupy the bottom left regions in both diagrams , and close to these regions the distributions of our identified agns peak . on the other hand ,",
    "the peak of the distribution of our selected star forming galaxies in these diagrams is clearly displaced from the one for agn .",
    "we would like to stress that this independently confirms that indeed two different populations of galaxies have been selected .",
    "the differences in the mir properties of our sf and agn galaxies affirm the strength of the .",
    "further , @xcite showed that narrow line agn appear spread out in both the qso and galaxy regions , which is also a result of our selection method [ note that the selected agn are present in both regions ] .",
    "the last point we want to stress is that the star forming galaxy locus in these diagrams is also consistent with the expected colors , as a contamination by star forming galaxies of the qso locus is expected , especially close to the boundary . in summary ,",
    "the  presented here agrees remarkably well with the expected properties of qsos , agn and star forming galaxies at intermediate redshifts in the mir range encompassing 3.6 - 8  .      a tight mid - ir ( as well as far- and total- ir ) ",
    "radio correlation is expected for star forming galaxies , while radio - loud agn are expected to strongly deviate from it ( e.g.  @xcite ) .",

    "based on a selection utilizing the bpt diagram they have shown that also low -luminosity agn follow a tight fir  radio correlation , however with a slightly different slope and a larger scatter than sf galaxies . in this section",
    "we investigate the 24   radio correlation for our selected sf and agn galaxies .",

    "we compare our  with the one utilized by @xcite in the local universe .",

    "we want to note that best et al .  calibrated their separation method using a slightly different selection of objects in the bpt diagram ( see their fig .",
    "9 ) with respect to the one we use here . therefore , a perfect correspondence between our and the best et al .",
    "method is not to be expected , even if our derived quantities were absolutely accurate .",
    "the area in the  vs.  @xmath181 plane where the major disagreement is expected , due to the different selections in the bpt diagram , is in the range of @xmath182  @xmath183 , and @xmath184 .",
    "this is the region where a larger fraction of seyfert and liner galaxies is located ( see fig .",
    "9 in @xcite ) , and , different from best et al . , we define these galaxies exclusively as agn . in this region in  we indeed see the largest disagreement between the two classifications .",
    "further , the existence of objects with  @xmath185 that we classify as agn is not surprising , but it rather reflects the dual properties of composite objects , which in this case were classified as agn by our .",
    "we also want to note that the average error in the synthesized  [ derived from comparison with the spectroscopic and synthetic  in the local sample ] is fairly large , and thus prevents a more detailed comparison between the two selection methods .",
    "overall , given the error bars and the difference in the basic selections of the two methods , as well as the fact that our  values are _ not _ spectral measurements on the data , but values taken from the best fit template , we conclude that our  agrees well with the one proposed by @xcite in the local universe .    in summary , our  for separating sf from agn galaxies agrees well with other selection schemes , proposed in the literature , which are based both on mir colors and optical spectroscopic diagnostics .",
    "in previous sections we have presented , tested , and discussed in detail the photometric  which we used to separate the matched radio source sample into stars , qsos , star forming , agn and high - z galaxies . in this section",
    "we discuss the properties of the population mix in the vla - cosmos survey : in  we describe the redshift and luminosity distributions of the selected sf and agn galaxies , and in  we study the contribution of different source types to the sub - mjy radio population .",
    "we show , based on the matched radio sample , as well as on the remaining radio sources with no optical counterparts ( brighter than @xmath46 ) , that star forming galaxies do not dominate the sub - mjy sources , but that the majority of these sources is rather comprised of agn and qsos .",
    "the  yielded  star forming and  agn galaxies out to redshifts of @xmath186 . in the top panel in  we",
    "show the redshift distribution for these galaxies using redshift bins of 0.217 in width .",
    "we use such wide redshift bins to assess the _ average _ properties of the radio population , reducing the effects of fluctuations due to the strong and narrow overdensities which are known to exist in the cosmos field @xcite .",
    "poisson errors are indicated for each bin .",
    "the deficit of galaxies at the low - redshift end reflects the relatively small comoving volume sampled by the 2  area of the cosmos field at these redshifts .",
    "the decline in the number of sources at the high - redshift end , on the other hand , reflects the detection limit of the vla - cosmos survey .",
    "the redshift distribution of the number of star forming galaxies seems to be more uniform than the one for agn , in particular the relative number of star forming galaxies compared to agn rises at higher redshifts ( @xmath187 ) .",
    "this may be explained by the relatively high number density of ulirgs expected at these redshifts @xcite in conjunction with the vla - cosmos detection limit which at these redshifts allows to sample only radio luminosities larger than @xmath188  whz@xmath12 ( see  below ) .",
    "further , as the comoving volume surveyed at @xmath187 is larger than the one surveyed locally , the probability of detecting a ulirg is also increasing at these redshifts .",
    "effects of cosmic variance as a function of redshift can not be excluded , however they should be smaller than for other deep radio surveys that typically probe significantly smaller areas .",
    "an increase of the agn fraction at @xmath189 is discernible .",
    "it possibly arises due to the dense large scale structure component in the cosmos field at this redshift @xcite .    in the bottom panel in  we",
    "show the fractional contribution of the sf and agn galaxies to the @xmath190 matched radio population , as a function of redshift . on average ,",
    "we find that the mean fractional contribution of sf and agn galaxies to the @xmath146 matched radio population is @xmath191 and @xmath192 , respectively .",
    "this is strikingly similar to the relative numbers of sf and agn galaxies in the local universe .",
    "namely , if we apply the adopted  color cut to the sdss / nvss galaxy sample ( see ) , we find that @xmath193 of the galaxies are star forming , and @xmath194 are agn . if , as shown by the tests described in , our  can reliably be applied also to high redshift galaxies , then the similarity of the sf and agn fractions suggests that the two populations have similar evolutionary properties out to @xmath174 .    in",
    ", we show the 1.4  ghz luminosity as a function of redshift for the selected sf and agn galaxies out to @xmath120 .",
    "we also indicate the expected luminosity ranges for milky way type galaxies , lirgs , ulirgs and hylirgs , which were derived using the total ir  radio correlation @xcite .",
    "it is noteworthy that the majority of galaxies with luminosities typical for hylirgs ( @xmath195  ) was classified by the  as agn , consistent with the expected properties of these galaxies ( e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "this point is seen more clearly in , where we show the distribution of the 1.4  ghz luminosity for the selected star forming and agn galaxies .",
    "the median luminosities are @xmath196  whz@xmath12 and @xmath197  whz@xmath12 for sf and agn galaxies , respectively .",
    "although the median luminosities of the two populations are different only by a factor of 2 ( note that this is drawn from a luminosity distribution of a flux limited sample ) , there are some significant differences at both high and low radio luminosity . at high luminosities",
    "there is the strong decline of the number of sf galaxies with luminosities above @xmath198  whz@xmath12 , while agn show an extended tail towards the brightest 1.4  ghz luminosities .",
    "such a behavior is consistent with results from local studies , which suggested that normal galaxies tend to have @xmath199  whz@xmath12 ( e.g.   @xcite ) .",
    "it is noteworthy , that our sf and agn galaxies were identified completely independently from their radio luminosity , yet their 1.4  ghz luminosities match the expectations based on local studies . at low luminosity ( @xmath200  whz@xmath12 ; below the typical lirg radio luminosity ) the fraction of sf galaxies increases and the numbers of sf and agn galaxies are similar to each other .",
    "+    further , the luminosity distribution shown in  agrees well with local results , which have shown that @xmath201 for star forming and ( absorption and emission line ) agn shows overlapping distributions , and consequently no clear separation ( e.g.  @xcite ) . in the local universe @xcite",
    "inferred a median @xmath201 for sf and agn galaxies to be @xmath202  whz@xmath12 and @xmath203  whz@xmath12 , respectively .",
    "hence , our median value for the luminosity of vla - cosmos agn ( @xmath204  whz@xmath12 ) out to @xmath120 matches the one inferred locally , however for sf galaxies ( @xmath205  whz@xmath12 ) it is higher than that derived by @xcite .",
    "the latter is easily understood as the combined effect of the higher median redshift ( @xmath206 ) of the galaxies in our _ flux limited _ sample ( thus not probing low @xmath201 ) and of the higher level of star formation activity , which is observed going from redshift 0 to 1 @xcite also implying higher @xmath201 @xcite .",
    "we caution at this point that luminosity distributions of flux limited samples are strongly dependent on the detection limits , and their interpretation has to be approached carefully . for this reason , in",
    "we also show the luminosity distributions for volume limited samples of our selected sf and agn galaxies in three redshift ranges . on",
    "average agn galaxies have higher 1.4  ghz luminosities than sf galaxies , reassuring the validity of our selection method .",
    "note , however , that in the lowest redshift range the agn and sf galaxy distributions are very similar .",
    "this is not surprising , but rather consistent with the observed luminosity range , that encompasses the region of indistinguishable space density of sf and agn galaxies in the local universe ( see local 1.4  ghz luminosity functions for sf and agn galaxies ; e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "in this section we study the contribution of different sub - populations to the the total sub - mjy radio population .",
    "the key question we want to answer is : is the sub - mjy population dominated by any particular sub - population , which may be the main cause for the observed flattening of the differential radio source counts below 1  mjy ( for vla - cosmos source counts ; see @xcite ) ?      in order to obtain an insight into the population mix of the faint radio sources in the matched radio source sample , in  we show the distribution of the 1.4  ghz total flux density , @xmath207 , for the sf and agn galaxies in the matched radio sample out to @xmath120 , as well as for the identified qsos .",
    "note , that the remaining @xmath3 galaxies in the matched radio sample are defined as high redshift ( high - z ) galaxies .",
    "the flux bins in  are 0.15  mjy wide .",
    "such wide bins allow us to study the average behavior of the galaxies in the sub - mjy population with decreasing flux densities .",
    "our main aim is to answer one of the more controversial questions in radio astronomy : _ is the sub - mjy radio population dominated by star forming galaxies or any other distinct sub - population ?",
    "_    from the top panel in  it is obvious that at flux densities above @xmath206  mjy we are hampered by low number statistics ( the total number of sources in each bin is below 20 ) .",
    "therefore , for the purpose of this paper we will focus only on sources with flux densities below @xmath6  mjy down to the vla - cosmos @xmath30 limit of @xmath5jy .",
    "the middle panel in  shows the fractional distribution of the identified populations in the matched radio sample , with indicated poisson errors .",
    "our findings are as follows .",
    "qsos contribute to the matched radio sample at a constant level of about @xmath127 .",
    "agn galaxies below @xmath120 show a decreasing trend with decreasing flux densities , with their contribution to the matched radio sample dropping from @xmath208 to less than @xmath15 .",
    "the sf galaxies at @xmath190 in the flux density range of @xmath209jy to @xmath6  mjy contribute fairly constantly at the given flux densities , with an average contribution of about @xmath126 .",
    "note that the possible increment from @xmath6  mjy to @xmath210jy of only @xmath8 is not significant . in",
    "we have inferred that the photometric errors in the synthesized  color introduce a positive bias of @xmath131 for sf galaxies . as this bin contains the lowest number of sf galaxies ,",
    "it is the most affected by this bias . in , based on the local sdss / nvss sample of galaxies",
    ", we have shown that our  selects @xmath211 of real sf galaxies , which make - up @xmath212 of the complete sample of sf galaxies , while the photometrically selected agn sample is contaminated by sf galaxies at the @xmath128 level .",
    "assuming that the percentages of completeness and contamination , derived from the analysis of the sdss / nvss sample of galaxies , can be safely applied also to our vla - cosmos sample , we can use them to correct the observed fractions .",
    "even with the correction the fractional contribution of sf galaxies at @xmath213 in the matched radio population essentially stays the same , i.e.   about @xmath214 at flux densities in the range from @xmath210jy to @xmath6  mjy .",
    "contrary to previous studies ( e.g.  @xcite ) , our results show that sf galaxies at intermediate redshifts are not the dominant population at sub - mjy flux density levels .",
    "however , it may be possible that a significant number of sf galaxies at @xmath3 exists , which may contribute strongly to the sub - mjy population .",
    "we investigate this possibility in the bottom panel in  and in , and show below that this is not the case .    about @xmath130 of the matched radio sample",
    "consists of galaxies at redshifts beyond @xmath120 ( high - z ; see bottom panel in ) .",
    "the contribution of these galaxies marginally increases from 20% at 0.7  mjy to 35% at 50  @xmath27jy . although we were not able to apply our  to these galaxies in order to classify them , we can nevertheless draw some conclusion about their nature by studying their multi - wavelength properties . therefore ,",
    "in  we plot the mir diagnostic diagram , for the high - z galaxies and compare their properties to the classified sources in the matched radio sample .",
    "we overlay non - evolving color tracks for the typical starburst galaxy m82 , an elliptical 13  gyr old galaxy , and a seyfert-2 type sed , obtained from a composite spectrum of 28 randomly chosen seyfert galaxies @xcite . as expected , the properties of high - z galaxies are consistent with properties of higher redshift ( @xmath215 ) galaxies .",
    "however , the region they occupy in this mir color - color diagram is occupied in a similar way by different sub - populations , such as star forming , seyfert - type , and passively evolving galaxies , in the redshift range from about @xmath216 to @xmath217 ( see color tracks in ) .",
    "further , it is possible that a fraction of these sources are broad line agn as they are located within the area outlined by dashed lines , which was proposed by @xcite for the selection of agn type-1 ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "this is further strengthened by the 22 high - z sources which were also identified as x - ray point sources , and lie within the type-1 agn selection region .",
    "further , given the high redshift of these sources , combined with the xmm detection limit , it is highly unlikely that any of these sources may be star forming ( see e.g.   fig .  14 in @xcite ) .",
    "this analysis alone already indicates that the matched radio sources beyond @xmath120 are most probably a mixture of different sub - populations . the population mix in the high - z sample is further affirmed by the distribution of the high - z galaxies in the @xmath155 diagram ( shown in ) , which is commonly utilized for the selection of @xmath218 galaxies , and separates well passively - evolving galaxies from those originally defined as star forming at @xmath218 @xcite . form",
    "it becomes obvious that the bzk criterion does not select a pure star forming sample at @xmath218 , as initially postulated , but a sample that is comprised of both sf galaxies and low - luminosity agn .",
    "in addition , the x - ray detected high - z sources , which may be classified as agn with high confidence as discussed above , also lie within this region .",
    "therefore , the sed color tracks combined with the distribution of the high - z galaxies ( black dots in ) , and the x - ray detected subsample suggest that our @xmath3 matched sources are a fair mixture of sf and agn galaxies , yielding that the high - z galaxies continue to consist of _ different _ galaxy populations at higher redshifts .    for reference , the @xmath90 band magnitude distribution for the identified sub - samples in the matched radio sample is shown in .",
    "note that the high - z galaxies are the faintest optical sources , consistent with the expectations for high redshift sources drawn from a flux limited sample .",
    "however , we want to mention that even in the most extreme case that all of the high - z galaxies were star forming , still the fractional contribution of star forming galaxies to the matched radio source population would not dominate over the contribution of agn and qsos , but the two contributions would rather be comparable .    as shown in  it is likely that both classes of objects contribute similarly to the high - z galaxies , although their exact relative fractions can not be determined from this analysis . however , if we assume that roughly @xmath109 of the high - z galaxies are sf galaxies , then the fraction of sf galaxies in the matched radio sample would increase to less than @xmath15 . therefore , we conclude that the population of star forming galaxies is not the dominant population at sub - mjy levels , at least in our sample of radio sources with optical counterparts out to @xmath46 .",
    "our results are strikingly similar to the recent results by @xcite , who studied the sub - mjy radio source population in the chandra deep field south down to a @xmath30 limit of @xmath219jy .",
    "they found that sf galaxies make up only about @xmath126 to @xmath220 ( i.e.  roughly 1/3 ) of the sub - mjy radio sources .",
    "most of the previous studies ( as well as our study up to this point ) of the faint radio population have relied on sub - samples of the observed radio sources , that have been identified with optical counterparts out to @xmath46 , as representative of the entire sub - mjy radio population .",
    "for example , @xcite used a sample of only 87 out of 523 ( i.e.  less than @xmath126 ) 1.4  ghz radio sources above 0.1  mjy , for which they obtained optical spectroscopy ( @xmath221 ) , to conclude that above 1  mjy about @xmath109 of the galaxies were sf or seyfert galaxies , while below 1  mjy the fraction increases to @xmath162 .",
    "further , @xcite studied optical spectroscopic properties of 34 radio sources above @xmath222  mjy in the marano field down to @xmath223 .",
    "this sample comprised @xmath208 of the entire sample of faint radio sources , and they concluded that the sf galaxies do not constitute the main galaxy population of their radio sources , and even at sub - mjy levels the majority of their radio sources were identified with early type galaxies , consistent with agn .",
    "gruppioni et al .  attributed the difference in their results compared to the results from @xcite to the fainter optical magnitude limit reached for their radio sample . in this work",
    "we have an order of magnitude larger sample size (  sources with optical counterparts ) , and a significantly deeper optical limit ( @xmath46 ) than previous studies . however ,",
    "still our matched radio source sample consists of only @xmath33 of the vla - cosmos 1.4  ghz sources .",
    "therefore , it is important to investigate the contribution of the remaining @xmath224 of the radio sources , with no identified or flagged optical counterparts , to the sub - mjy population . it may indeed be possible that a missing population of objects , that significantly contributes to the sub - mjy population , is hidden in this sample .",
    "we show below that this is not the case .",
    "if the above hypothesis is true , then the properties ( such as e.g.  mir colors ) of these remaining objects are expected to be distinct from the properties of objects in the matched radio sample . in order to shed light on this , in  ( top panel ) we show the distribution of the total flux density for the  sources in the matched radio sample , and for the remaining  sources that were a ) not identified with optical counterparts with @xmath112 or b ) have optical counterparts with @xmath112 but in photometrically masked - out region ( see ) .",

    "[ fig : sternrem ] ]    this is further strengthened by the distribution of the remaining sources in the mir color - dolor diagram , shown in , which is consistent with the expected distribution for a mixed sample of star forming , agn galaxies , and qsos at all redshifts in the range from the local to the highest observable redshifts .",
    "an additional affirmation of the mix of population arises from the 31 sources that have been detected as x - ray point sources ( see ) .",

    "however , @xcite , who performed a deeper optical spectroscopic analysis of a larger fraction ( @xmath208 ) of their radio sources , disagreed with this result identifying the majority of their sub - mjy radio sources with early type galaxies , in which the radio emission is produced by agn . recently , using a combination of optical and radio morphology as an identifier for agn and sf galaxies on @xmath162 of their radio sources in the ssa13 field , @xcite suggested that less than @xmath115 of the radio sources below 1  mjy are agn . on the other hand ,",

    "the  there are two main reasons for such controversial results in the past literature : a ) the identification fraction of radio sources with optical counterparts spans a wide range ( 20% to 90% ) in samples from radio deep fields , and b ) the methods for the separation of sf from agn galaxies have been highly heterogeneous .",
    "further , the first and second point seem to exclude each other .",
    "namely , the most efficient separation methods ( e.g.  intermediate- to high- resolution optical spectroscopy ) generally led to a small identification fraction , whereas large radio samples with high optical identification fractions usually lacked robust sf / agn indicators . in this paper we have tried to make a strong conjunction of these two points .",
    "we introduced a new method to separate sf from agn galaxies , which relies strongly on rest - frame color properties , and thus allowed us to perform a robust classification of @xmath33 ( @xmath227 ) of the 1.4  ghz vla - cosmos radio sources down to @xmath228 with identified optical counterparts out to @xmath46 without the need for e.g.  optical spectroscopy .",
    "thus , we managed to reach both a high identification fraction and a robust source classification .",

    "our results , derived in the previous sections , show that indeed star forming galaxies are not the dominant population at sub - mjy levels in the range of @xmath210jy to @xmath6  jy , however they still contribute about @xmath130 to @xmath15 at these flux densities . based on our large sample of  vla - cosmos radio sources we find that our classified agn , which comprise mostly of low - luminosity and type-2 agn , make up @xmath7 of the faint radio population with a decreasing trend towards fainter flux densities , while the identified qsos , which are mostly type-1 agn , form a minor contribution of @xmath8 of the sub - mjy radio population in the range of @xmath210jy to @xmath6  jy .",
    "thus , our observational results show that the population mix in the faint radio population contains a fair contribution of both sf galaxies and ( low - luminosity and obscured ) agn , at least down to @xmath210jy .",
    "thus , separate luminosity functions for both populations have to be taken into account in order to fully explain the flattening of the radio source counts below 1  mjy .",
    "the 1.4  ghz luminosity function for star forming and agn galaxies at intermediate redshift , as well as the modeling of the 1.4  ghz radio source counts using these new observational constrains and further analyzes of the population mix in the vla - cosmos survey , is going to be fully addressed and presented in a number of up - coming publications @xcite .",
    "our newly developed , in conjunction with the vla - cosmos 1.4  ghz observations , enabled us to make , for the first time , a thorough distinction between sources where the 1.4  ghz radio emission is predominantly driven by star formation processes from those where it is driven by smbh processes , _ regardless of the luminosity of the latter _ , and apply it to currently the largest sample of  1.4  ghz sources , with optical counterparts brighter than @xmath231 , and complete down to @xmath228 .",
    "we have explored to full detail the composition of the sub - mjy radio population making use of the entire sample of  vla - cosmos radio sources detected above @xmath232 , in conjunction with the panchromatic ( x - ray to radio ) cosmos data set .",
    "we find that sf galaxies are not the dominant population at submillijansky flux density levels , as believed previously , but that they rather make up an approximately constant fraction of @xmath4 in the flux density range of @xmath5jy to @xmath6  mjy .",
    "the radio population at these flux densities is a mixture of roughly @xmath4 of sf and @xmath7 of agn galaxies , with a minor contribution ( @xmath8 ) of qsos .",
