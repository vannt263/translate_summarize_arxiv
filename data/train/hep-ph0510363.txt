    "in the last decade the photon - proton and photon - photon reactions became a testing ground for different qcd - inspired models .",
    "the dipole model was one of the most popular and successful . in the simplest version of the model only quark - antiquark fock components of the photon are included in order to describe the total cross sections .",
    "in contrast , the more exclusive processes , like diffraction @xcite , jet @xcite or heavy quark @xcite production , require inclusion of higher fock components of the photon .    in ref .",
    "@xcite we have constructed a simple hybrid model which includes the resolved photon component in addition to the quark - antiquark component . with a very small number of parameters we were able to describe the hera @xmath0 total cross section data with an accuracy similar to that of very popular dipole models . in ref .",
    "@xcite we have generalized our hybrid model also to photon - photon collisions .",
    "application to @xmath1 processes requires some modifications of the model .",

    "the vector - meson - nucleon cross section is approximated by pion(kaon)-proton cross section .",
    "a simple regge parametrization by donnachie and landshoff @xcite is used to parametrize the pion(kaon)-proton total cross section .",
    "we take @xmath9 s calculated from the leptonic decays of vector mesons , including finite width corrections .    in the same spirit",
    ", the total cross section for @xmath10 scattering can be written as a sum of five terms shown in fig.[fig : fig2 ] .     scattering model .",
    "[ fig : fig2 ] _ , width=226 ]    the formulae for the direct term can be found in ref.@xcite .",
    "if both photons fluctuate into perturbative quark - antiquark pairs , the interaction is due to gluonic exchanges between quarks and antiquarks represented in fig.[fig : fig2 ] by the blob .",
    "formally this component can be written in terms of the photon perturbative `` wave functions '' and the cross section for the interaction of both dipoles @xmath11 in paper @xcite a phenomenological parametrization for the azimuthal - angle averaged dipole - dipole cross section has been proposed : @xmath12   \\cdot s_{thresh}(x_{ab } ) \\ ; . \\label{saturation_parametrization}\\ ] ] our formula for @xmath13 is different from the one used in ref.@xcite .",
    "as discussed in ref.@xcite our formula provides correct behaviour at threshold energies .",
    "different prescriptions for @xmath14 have been considered in ref.@xcite , with @xmath15 being probably the best choice @xcite .",
    "following our philosophy of explicitly including the nonperturbative resolved photon , in photon - photon collisions completely new terms must be included ( the last two diagrams in fig.[fig : fig2 ] ) .",
    "if one of the photons fluctuates into a quark - antiquark dipole and the second photon fluctuates into a vector meson , or vice versa @xmath16 @xmath17 in the formulae above : @xmath18 in the present calculation we take @xmath19 for @xmath20 and @xmath21 ( anti)quarks and @xmath22 0.15 gev for @xmath23 ( anti)quarks .",
    "if each of the photons fluctuates into a vector meson the corresponding component is called double resolved .",
    "the corresponding cross section reads : @xmath24 the total cross section for @xmath25-@xmath26 scattering must be modeled . in the following we assume regge factorization and use a simple parametrization which fits the world experimental data for hadron - hadron total cross sections @xcite .",
    "more details can be found in ref.@xcite .",
    "in ref.@xcite we have adjusted the parameters of our model to @xmath0 collisions .",
    "let us try to use these parameters to describe @xmath1 total cross section . in fig.[fig",
    ": gg_tot ] we present the total cross section as a function of center - of - mass energy .",
    "the sum of all components of fig.[fig : fig2 ] ( thick - solid line ) exceeds the experimental data by a factor of two or even more .",
    "the individual components are shown explicitly as well .",
    "the direct component ( dash - dotted line ) dominates at low energies only . at high energies the dipole - dipole ( thin - solid line ) ,",
    "single - resolved ( dashed line ) and double - resolved ( dotted line ) components are of comparable size .",
    "the overestimation of the experimental data suggests a double - counting .",

    "the experimental data are from @xcite .",
    "[ fig : gg_tot ] _ , title=\"fig:\",width=226 ]    in ref.@xcite it was assumed that the coupling constants responsible for the transition of photons into vector mesons are the same as those obtained from the leptonic decays of vector mesons , i.e. the on - shell approximation was used . in our case",
    "we need the corresponding coupling constants rather at @xmath27 = 0 and not on the meson mass shell ( @xmath28 ) .",
    "we replace @xmath29 and extrapolate from meson mass shell to @xmath27 = 0 by means of @xmath30 the parameter @xmath31 is a new nonperturbative parameter of our new model .",
    "secondly , the `` photon - wave functions '' commonly used in the literature allow for large quark - antiquark dipoles .",
    "this is a nonperturbative region where the pqcd is not expected to work .",
    "furthermore this is a region which is taken into account in the resolved photon components as explicit vector mesons .",
    "therefore we propose the following modification of the `` perturbative '' photon wave function : @xmath32 the parameters @xmath31 and @xmath33 were obtained by fitting our modified model formula to the experimental data .",
    "the @xmath1 data is not sufficient for this purpose as different combinations of the two parameters lead to equally good description .",
    "therefore we were forced to perform a new fit of the model parameters to both @xmath0 and @xmath1 scattering .    in fig.[fig : gg_tot ] we show the resulting @xmath34 together with the experimental data of the pluto ( solid triangles ) and opal ( open circles ) collaborations .",
    "we also show the individual contributions of different processes from fig.[fig : fig2 ] .",
    "the relative size of the contributions has changed when compared to the old set of parameters .",
    "now the sum of the single resolved components , included here for the first time , dominates in the broad range of center - of - mass energies .",
    "the double resolved component is now much weaker and constitutes 10 - 15 % of the total cross section only . in fig.[fig : hera ] we show the analogous description of the @xmath0 data .",

    "one often assumes the following relation @xmath35 known as factorization .",
    "we have considered two quantities which measure factorization breaking .",
    "they read : @xmath36 for the factorized ansatz ( [ factorization ] ) @xmath37 = 1 for any @xmath38 and @xmath39 .",

    "when @xmath46 .",
    "we have generalized our previous model for @xmath0 total cross section to the case of @xmath1 scattering . in the last case",
    "a few new components appear .",
    "the naive generalization of our former model for @xmath0 total cross section leads to a serious overestimation of the @xmath1 total cross sections . a priori",
    ", this fact can be due either to a nonoptimal set of model parameters found in our previous study , double counting , or due to some model simplifications like off - shell effects .",
    "we have suggested to include such an effect by introducing new form factors . when including the quark - antiquark continuum one usually takes into account the perturbative quark - antiquark `` photon wave function '' .",
    "this is justified and reasonable for small size dipoles only . in order to avoid double counting the large - size dipoles",
    "have been eliminated using a simple exponential function in transverse dipole size .",
