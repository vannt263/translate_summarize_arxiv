    "these simplistic models were developed based on the outdated boundary layer accretion paradigm but are robust to different geometries for the emitting gas .",

    "substantially smaller turbulent velocities are unable to reproduce the shoulder of the balmer jump , located between the real balmer jump at 3646   and the observed balmer jump at @xmath44  , that is attributed to blending of high balmer lines .",
    "the synthetic spectrum is then scaled to the measured flux accretion continuum .",
    "the filling factor of the emission on the stellar surface is calculated from the accretion luminosity and temperature .",
    "@xcite developed more advanced models of the pre- and post - shock gas at the footpoint of the magnetospheric accretion column on the star . in their models",
    "the balmer continuum is produced in the optically - thin pre - shock gas while the paschen continuum is produced in the optically - thick post - shock gas .",
    "the optically - thin pre - shock gas has an intrinsically large balmer jump .",
