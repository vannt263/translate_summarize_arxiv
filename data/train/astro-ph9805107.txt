    "ngc  3367 is a face - on sbc(s ) barred spiral galaxy inclined with respect to the plane of the sky at an angle i@xmath4 ( @xcite ) .",
    "it can be considered an isolated galaxy at a distance of 43.6 mpc with a far distant neighbor , ngc 3419 , behind the leo spur group of galaxies ( i.e. using h@xmath5 km s@xmath6 mpc@xmath6 and assuming that the milky way is moving towards the virgo cluster at 300 km s@xmath6 ; @xcite ) . at this distance ,",
    "an angular diameter of 1@xmath7 corresponds to @xmath8 pc .",
    "the stellar bar has an angular diameter of @xmath9 ( 6.72 kpc ) oriented at p.a .",
    "@xmath3 , and there is a southwest optical structure resembling a `` bow shock '' , along which lies a half ring of h@xmath1 knots at a radius of about 10 kpc from the nucleus ( @xcite ) .",
    "vla observations at 15@xmath7 angular resolution by condon et al . , ( 1990 ) at 1.46 ghz show emission from the disk as well as from the nucleus and from two sources straddling the nucleus .",
    "ngc  3367 is also an x - ray and far infrared emitter ( @xcite ) .",
    "the x - ray emission extends beyond the disk , but peaks some 21@xmath7 from the compact nucleus in the southwest direction ( gioia et al . 1990 ; stocke et al .",
    "1991 ; fabbiano et al .",
    "this is coincident with the southwest radio continuum lobe .",
    "its x - ray luminosity is stronger than other normal spirals , but weaker than seyfert galaxies .",
    "it also has a strong far - ir emission , of about l@xmath10 l@xmath11 ( soifer et al .",
    "1989 ) , with a relatively high dust temperature of t@xmath12 k ( garcia - barreto et al .",
    "the nuclear region also shows a h@xmath1 peak intensity of @xmath13 ergs s@xmath6 @xmath14 , with fwhm@xmath15 km s@xmath6 , and [ oiii @xmath16@xmath17 h@xmath18 ( @xcite ) .",
    "all these characteristics are similar to those found in seyfert galaxies , and thus ngc 3367 has been classified as a seyfert - like galaxy ( @xcite ) .",
    "radio continuum emission from the central regions of disk galaxies has been detected at low resolution from almost every nearby spiral ( @xcite ) , and high resolution studies show that this is usually due to circumnuclear emission , with a variety of sizes and morphologies .",
    "double , triple or jet - like radio continuum structures have been found in several barred spirals with well - known seyfert activity , such as ngc 1068 , ngc 4151 , and ngc 5728 but only ngc 1068 , a sy 2 , displays extended radio continuum disk emission and has a central ( 0.4 kpc ) source with two lobes ( @xcite ) , very much like a small - scale radio galaxy ( @xcite ) .    in this paper",
    "we present new vla radio continuum observations of ngc  3367 at 1.4 ghz with a beam of @xmath0 .",
    "the radio continuum image is complex , showing emission from the central region , from many unresolved sources associated with star - forming regions , and from two extended regions straddling the central region . for the purpose of analysis in this paper we will refer to the emission from the central region plus the two extended sources as the _ triple source _ and we will refer to the emission from the disk emission as _ star - formation _ emission",
    "we have carried out radio continuum observations at the vla in new mexico in the b array at 1.3851 ghz and at 1.4649 ghz in 1997 may 18 using 27 antennas with 50 mhz bandwidths , and 7@xmath19.5 integration time on ngc 3367 .",
    "we observed 3c286 as the amplitude and polarization calibrator and 1120 + 143 as the phase calibrator .",
    "we assumed a flux density of 3c286 of s@xmath20 jy at @xmath21 ghz , and",
    "s@xmath22 jy at @xmath23 ghz .",
    "several iterations of phase self - calibration and one iteration of amplitude self - calibration were used .",
    "the final maps of the total intensity of ngc 3367 after 25,000 iterations using aips cleaning task imagr have an rms noise of @xmath24jy / beam and a cleaned beam of @xmath25 at p.a .",
    "@xmath26 using uniform weighting .",
    "the final maps , however , still have weak ripples in the east - west direction , most likely due to phase residuals . the maps in q and u have an rms of @xmath27jy / beam .",
    "figure 1 shows the total intensity map of ngc 3367 .",
    "there are four different types of regions that are apparent in the figure :",
    "a ) the unresolved source from the nuclear region ; b ) the northeast and the southwest extended emissions , i.e. the lobes , ( see fig .",
    "2 ) that are connected with the nuclear region ; c ) many unresolved sources in the disk of the galaxy ; and d ) diffuse disk emission . we designate regions a ) and b ) as the `` triple source '' for later discussion .",
    "the total integrated flux density is 89.3 mjy , slightly less than low resolution ( vla - d fwhm@xmath28 ) value of 119.5 mjy , which is more sensitive to diffuse emission ( @xcite ) .",
    "the central source is slightly resolved , with an approximate deconvolved fwhm size of @xmath29 , at p.a.@xmath30 .",
    "the integrated flux densities of the northeast and southwest lobes are @xmath31 mjy and @xmath32 mjy respectively , and span 12 kpc .",
    "the disk emission is generated from at least 55 unresolved sources ( each with a peak flux of @xmath33jy / beam ) and there is diffuse emission associated with each of them .",
    "the nucleus is connected to the lobes by extensions at an angle of @xmath34 , coincidental with the p.a . of the innermost contours of the convolved red - continuum image of the stellar bar ( @xcite )",
    ". a line joining the two lobes is at p.a .",
    "@xmath35 , and a one dimensional plot along this line ( figure 3 ) shows the brightening towards the outer parts of the lobe , similar to the observed behavior of powerful radio galaxies ( @xcite ) .",
    "polarized emission was detected only from the southwest lobe ( figure 4 ) .",
    "the fractional polarization varies through the southwest lobe ; from @xmath364% to @xmath3624% .",
    "the polarization angle also varies from p.a .",
    "@xmath34 to @xmath37 , with no corrections made for faraday rotation . on average ,",
    "the polarization in the northeast lobe is lower than @xmath38 .",
    "if the extended radio emission in ngc 3367 is a combination of emission related to star formation and to agn activity , then , in principle , it should be possible to separate their contributions by using the distribution of h@xmath1 emission .",
    "the h@xmath1 emission and the thermal radio emission are proportional to the number of ionizing photons .",
    "the ionizing photons come primarily from the most massive ob stars in stellar clusters .",
    "in addition , non - thermal emission from star formation regions comes from the snr remnants .",
    "we expect a correlation between h@xmath1 and radio emission , although this can be complicated by differences in extinctions , in the snr populations , or in magnetic field strengths ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "here we have adopted a more empirical approach , and have simply subtracted scaled versions of the h@xmath1 map , figure 5 ( from @xcite ) from the radio map .",
    "the exact scaling factor is not relevant for the rest of the discussion . with the aid of these subtracted images ( see figure 6 ) , we are able to eliminate the contributions to the radio from the brightest hii regions",
    ". then we can get rough estimates of the strength and morphology of the remaining non - thermal emission which we identify as agn - related .",
    "the residual emission is dominated by the triple source previously discussed , along with long ridges of emission on both sides of this source ( see figure 7 ) .",
    "these ridges are likely to be disk emission , and possibly associated with cosmic ray acceleration in large scale shocks .",
    "they are coincident with optical low surface brightness regions , are relatively weak in h@xmath1 , and lie outside of the stellar bar .",
    "their locations seem to correspond with locations at which large scale shocks can be produced by gas flows driven by a bar potential ( see roberts et al .",
    "1979 , and figure 6.28 of binney & tremaine 1987 ) .",
    "this issue is currently under investigation with a magnetohydrodynamical code , and it will be addressed in a forthcoming paper . at the moment , we center the discussion on the agn related emission .",
    "the power of the triple source is about 10@xmath39 w hz@xmath6 , approximately half of the total radio power from ngc 3367 and similar to those of seyfert 2 galaxies .",
    "it is known that both seyfert and markarian galaxies have double or triple radio continuum sources ( i. e. , ngc 1068 , mrk3 , mrk 6 , mrk 78 , ngc 4151 , ngc 5548 , and ngc 5728 ; @xcite ) , and some edge - on seyfert galaxies and starburst galaxies show large scale radio continuum structures along their minor axes ( @xcite ) . in the case of barred spirals ,",
    "the relative orientation of the bar and the double and triple sources varies from galaxy to galaxy .",
    "a comparison with other types of galaxies is presented in section 5 .",
    "the fact that only one lobe is polarized may indicate that they do not lie on the plane of the disk , but may be inclined with respect to the midplane .",
    "if this is the case , the emission from the far lobe ( the northeast ) will be depolarized by the disk material and only the near lobe ( the southwest ) will show some polarization .",
    "their sizes indicate that , in projection , they cover about one third of the galaxy s diameter .",
    "the optical properties of the nucleus and the extended disk of ngc 3367 are similar to those found in both normal spirals and weak seyfert 2 galaxies .",
    "in particular , [ oiii]@xmath17h@xmath41 , and [ oi]@xmath42[oiii ] ( @xcite ) .",
    "the nuclear optical spectrum suggest a composite spectrum between a normal hii spiral and a weak liner or a weak seyfert 2 galaxy ( @xcite ) .",
    "even though ngc 3367 does not show the optical nuclear characteristics of seyfert galaxies ( with broad balmer lines with fwhm @xmath431000 km s@xmath6 and [ oiii]/h@xmath443 ) , its radio power at 1.46ghz is stronger than seyfert 1 galaxies and is comparable to other seyfert 2 galaxies . as stated above",
    ", the power of the central source plus the lobes is p@xmath45 w hz@xmath6 . also , the global spectral index of ngc 3367 is @xmath46 , from 1.4 ghz up to 4.8 ghz , similar to the spectral index found in other seyfert galaxies ( @xcite ) and slighty steeper than in normal spirals ( @xcite ) .",
    "there are several barred galaxies showing similar radio continuum morphologies , and ngc 1068 is probably the best known example . at a distance of 15.6 mpc ,",
    "the power of the inner 13@xmath7 structure in ngc 1068 at 6 cm is p@xmath47 w hz@xmath6 ( @xcite ) .",
    "it also has a central source plus two lobes ( parallel to the stellar bar ) , a bright stellar bar and a nearly face on disk ( @xcite ) .",
    "elongated radio continuum structures are relatively common in the central parts of barred galaxies with seyfert - like activity , but the relative orientation between the structures and the corresponding bars do not show any particular type of alignment ( @xcite ) . a summary of the global properties of ngc 3367 and other ( normal , seyfert 2 s , seyfert 1 s , and radio ) galaxies is shown in table 1",
    ".    the angular distances on the plane of the sky of ngc 3367 from the central source to the brightest sources in the northeast and southwest lobes are n - ne@xmath48 and n - sw@xmath49 respectively .",
    "these angular distances would correspond to linear distances of @xmath50 kpc and @xmath51 kpc . for comparison ,",
    "the northeast lobe in ngc 1068 is only @xmath52 pc from its nucleus . at the other extreme",
    "the distance from the center to the north lobe in the spiral radio galaxy 0313 - 192 ( in the abell 428 cluster ) is @xmath53 kpc ( @xcite ) .",
    "the extents of the so called extranuclear emission observed in edge - on seyfert galaxies range from 0.6 kpc , in ngc 4051 , to 30 kpc , in mrk 231 , with an average of @xmath54 kpc ( @xcite ) .",
    "thus , the lobes of ngc 3367 are within the wide range of sizes observed in other active galaxies . the spatial resolution of our observations , however ,",
    "is not suitable to analyze the structure of the connection between the lobes and the central nuclear source ( i. e. , jets , plasmoids from a galactic wind , young superbubbles , etc ) , or to analyze whether any emission originates from the inner regions of the bar .",
    "also , if there is a radio continuum circumnuclear structure in ngc 3367 , it must be less than 4@xmath7 in diameter , and higher angular resolution observations would be needed to resolve it . the central ionized gas structure in h@xmath1 is also dominated by an unresolved bright source and weak emission extending to about a radius of @xmath55 ( @xcite ) .",
    "several models have been proposed for the radio emission from a seyfert nucleus ( @xcite ) . in our case",
    "the key questions are the origin of the triple radio source , its structure , and the polarization asymmetry .",
    "the total gas content in ngc 3367 , m@xmath56 m@xmath11 ( @xcite ) , is similar to the amount observed in other sc galaxies .",
    "the agn activity that originates the triple radio source in ngc 3367 was probably triggered by an episode of efficient gas transfer to the innermost central regions . as stated above , gas from large radii",
    "can be transfered to the central regions by the action of the non - axisymmetric gravitational potential ( @xcite ) , or by the interaction with another galaxy ( @xcite ) . in ngc 3367",
    "both scenarios are possible : it has a well formed bar , and it has a string of hii regions ( forming a semicircle ) that could have originated in an off - center collision with an intruder ( @xcite ) . the bar , however , can only drive the gas inflow to the ilr and an additional pertubation ( say , the interaction with an intruder ) is needed in order to send the gas even closer to the dynamical center ( @xcite ) .    on larger scales",
    ", the gas also strongly influences the appearance and structure of the triple radio source .",
    "the polarization asymmetry is likely caused by depolarization through an ionized component , such as that seen in x - rays .",
    "the limb - brightened outer edges indicate an interaction with gaseous external medium .",
    "similarly , the s - shape of the triple source could result from shears in galactic rotation or gradients in the ambient medium ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "precession of the jet due to torques from infalling material ( @xcite ) could also play a role .",
    "the interactions between the radio plasma and the other gaseous components are worthy of further study , such as searching for molecular and shocked gas at the leading edges or where the jets from the nucleus make large changes in direction .",
    "numerical simulations of jet flows in a barred galaxy would also be of interest .",
    "we have observed , with the vla b array , the radio continuum emission from the barred galaxy ngc  3367 with 4@xmath57 spatial resolution .",
    "the radio continuum emission maps shows emission from four distinct regions : a ) star forming regions , b ) the nucleus , and c ) two extended , symmetric , lobes connected with the nuclear source , and d ) diffuse emission from the disk that is not coincident with bright h@xmath1 regions .",
    "our main results are :    * the optical and radio characteristics suggest that ngc 3367 is a transition galaxy between normal to seyfert . * the total radio continuum emission from regions of star formation correlates with the observed h@xmath1 emission , in agreement with a similar correlation found in other galaxies . *",
    "the strongest radio continuum emission is from a barely resolved nuclear source and two extended regions symmetrically located opposite to the nucleus , forming what we call a triple source with total extent @xmath58 kpc .",
    "the morphology of the triple source is similar to those observed in radio galaxies , and to the structure seen in the inner 0.4 kpc in ngc 1068 .",
    "* the triple source could be the result of nuclear ejecta in the northeast and southwest directions , and inclined with respect to the galactic plane .",
    "the @xmath59-shape of the lobes could be due to interaction with the ambient gas .",
    "* only the southwest lobe is found to be polarized .",
    "the northeast lobe is probably de - polarized as the beam passes through a randomly oriented magnetic field in the disk of the galaxy .",
