    "the geometrization of duality groups has been the source of many insights both in string and field theories .",
    "perhaps the simplest example is that of montonen - olive duality in four - dimensional @xmath6 sym , where the discrete @xmath7 group acting on the complexified coupling @xmath8 is interpreted as the modular group of a @xmath9 .",
    "the torus is physical : one can obtain the four - dimensional theory with parameter @xmath8 by compactifying a six - dimensional @xmath10 theory on @xmath11  @xcite .",
    "a related example is s - duality in @xmath12 theories , which can be identified with the mapping class group of an @xmath13-punctured genus-@xmath14 riemann surface @xmath15  @xcite . in type iib",
    "string theory , identifying the axio - dilaton @xmath8 with the modular group of an auxiliary torus leads to f - theory  @xcite . even if we do not have a complete twelve dimensional picture ,",
    "the torus is again physical and this is best understood via duality to m - theory .",
    "similar attempts have been made to geometrize the full u - duality group  @xcite .",
    "recently , investigations along these lines have been carried out for the t - duality group in the context of heterotic / f - theory duality in  @xcite , following earlier works  @xcite .",
    "one of the most interesting outcomes of this analysis is the description of inherently quantum bundles , namely spaces in which different patches are glued together with t - dualities .",
    "these spaces are usually referred to as `` t - folds ''  @xcite or more generally as `` non - geometric backgrounds ''  @xcite .",
    "while string dualities may help to understand such backgrounds , a direct study beside the most simple realizations such as asymmetric orbifolds has proved quite challenging .",
    "a clearly fascinating question is how the notion of differentiable manifolds should be changed to accommodate such stringy geometries .",
    "one might think that t - duality covariant formalisms such as generalized complex geometry  @xcite and double field theory  @xcite are relevant tools for such investigations .",
    "these approaches provide a natural framework for the inclusion of the b - field ( as well as rr - fields ) , but there are also attempts to describe non - geometric backgrounds in this context , see for example  @xcite .    in view of these motivations , it is of interest to obtain approximate solutions",
    "in which there is a non - trivial duality symmetry between various patches , and which provide a concrete realization of t - folds",
    ". this will be the subject of the present paper .",
    "a useful approach is to consider string theory compactified on a torus , and fiber the resulting t - duality group over a base @xmath2 .",
    "we develop a geometric point of view in which the duality group is identified with the mapping class group @xmath16 of a given surface @xmath1 fibered over @xmath2 .",
    "we then classify all possible torus fibrations with geometric and non - geometric twists in terms of a classification of elements in @xmath16 .",
    "in particular , we identify t - duality elements with dehn twists of @xmath1 and we categorize them according to the type of surface diffeomorphisms .    most of the paper will deal with the simplest example of a two torus @xmath9 , in which case a partial geometrization of the t - duality group @xmath17 is obtained by simply taking @xmath18 , where @xmath8 is the complex structure of @xmath9 , @xmath19 is the complexified khler form and @xmath20 is identified with the compactification torus . as we will discuss shortly , in some cases there is a physical picture for the auxiliary @xmath21 .",
    "we first consider the case in which the base @xmath2 is a circle @xmath22 .",
    "if we only vary @xmath8 , the fibration is specified by a monodromy @xmath23 which is used to identify the fibers after encircling the base @xmath22 .",
    "the monodromy can be factorized as a product of dehn twists , and the total space of the fibration is a 3-manifold @xmath24 , known as the mapping torus for @xmath25 , whose geometry is determined by the type of torus diffeomorphism @xmath26 ( which can be either reducible , periodic or pseudo - anosov , respectively matching parabolic , elliptic and hyperbolic @xmath7 conjugacy classes ) and is either an euclidean space , a nil or a sol geometry . by replacing @xmath8 with @xmath19",
    "we obtain a classification of possible t - fold metrics .",
    "we can think of the monodromy in @xmath19 as a product of dehn twists of the auxiliary torus @xmath21 fibered over @xmath22 .",
    "we then consider a fibration of the torus over a two dimensional base @xmath27 .",
    "this is the familiar situation of stringy cosmic strings  @xcite and the parameters @xmath8 and @xmath19 need to be holomorphic functions on the base where a collection of points , at which the fiber torus degenerates , has been removed .",
    "this situation can be described by two elliptic fibrations  @xcite and the corresponding degenerations , classified by kodaira  @xcite , are associated to stringy cosmic five - branes . for each degeneration",
    "is associated a monodromy , namely an element of the mapping class group of @xmath20 or @xmath21 .",
    "non - trivial elements of @xmath28 , with the exception of a perturbative shift @xmath29 which is associated to a ns5 brane  @xcite , will give non - geometric solutions .",
    "the fibration data for the auxiliary @xmath21 can be determined in the heterotic theory by a fibration of heterotic / f - theory duality  @xcite , and the non - geometric backgrounds are mapped to geometric k3-fibered calabi - yau compactifications on the f - theory side .",
    "we will generically refer to such degenerations as t - duality defects , or _",
    "t - fects_.    it is interesting to ask to what extent one can invert this reasoning , namely if it is possible to determine , from a classification of elements in the mapping class group , which monodromies of the fibration on the boundary @xmath30 of a small disk @xmath31 correspond to a family of degenerating surfaces at a point in @xmath31 . as a result of an elaborate theorem  @xcite , one can make this approach precise and basically obtain a topological classification of singular fibers .    in order to construct approximate solutions for such backgrounds we use",
    "a semi - flat approximation  @xcite where the fields do not depend on the fiber coordinates . in our case",
    "this means to preserve the @xmath32 isometry of the torus . for the geometric fibrations",
    "this is a very good approximation of the full metric , up to exponentially suppressed terms close to the degenerations .",
    "we then construct all possible local geometries for a fibration on a small disk @xmath31 with a given monodromy @xmath33 $ ] at the boundary , for each conjugacy class @xmath34 $ ] of @xmath35 , by solving the corresponding cauchy - riemann equations .",
    "some of the geometric solutions are identified with a smeared version of known branes , such as the kk monopole .",
    "solutions for the parabolic conjugacy class in @xmath36 give , other then a smeared ns5 brane solution , a class of non - geometric backgrounds in which patching requires @xmath37-transformations .",
    "in particular , we recover the solution for the @xmath38 exotic brane recently discussed in  @xcite .",
    "we obtain a class of solutions for elliptic @xmath19-fects which are related to an asymmetric orbifold description  @xcite .",
    "we also construct solutions with hyperbolic monodromy , whose corresponding mapping torus is a sol - geometry .",
    "the volume of the fiber torus in such backgrounds is a highly oscillating function near the would - be degeneration point , in line with the fact that hyperbolic monodromies can not be obtained from colliding degenerations of elliptic fibrations .",
    "however , such solutions can approximate a distribution of branes .",
    "when both @xmath8 and @xmath19 fibrations are allowed to degenerate at the same point , we obtain non - geometric solutions which are not t - dual to geometric ones .",
    "in particular we discuss the example of double elliptic monodromies and the relation with the corresponding asymmetric orbifold studied in  @xcite . the solutions that we construct give approximate local geometries around degenerations of a given global model . for the case of elliptic fibrations ,",
    "these local solutions will be approximated by an expansion of the solutions for @xmath8 and @xmath19 determined by the appropriate combination of hypergeometric functions that invert klein s @xmath39-invariant .",
    "the same result holds for the axio - dilaton profile in f - theory .    finally , we describe from the geometric point of view fibrations of a genus 2 surface @xmath40 , that provides a geometrization of the heterotic t - duality group @xmath41  @xcite",
    ". degenerations of surface fibrations over @xmath42 correspond to heterotic t - fects .",
    "we describe a classification of such defects in terms of elements in @xmath43 and we give the monodromy factorization for some of them .",
    "let us mention few possible applications of our results .",
    "having explicit solutions which require patching by arbitrary elements of the t - duality group should be useful to investigate the correct geometric description of such backgrounds , as in the approach of  @xcite , as well to understand general non - geometric microstate solutions for black holes  @xcite",
    ". it would be interesting to see if solutions with the monodromies considered in this paper can arise via brane polarization as in  @xcite , as this would be an additional mechanism to obtain a globally well defined solution , since only dipole exotic charges would be nonzero .",
    "we also note that exotic branes should be relevant for cosmological billiards  @xcite and it would be nice to clarify the relation with the t - fects described here .",
    "we mention that a particular kind of elliptic @xmath19-fects ( described in terms of a gauged linear sigma model ) were used in  @xcite as an ingredient to `` uplift '' ads / cft dual pairs to ds ones .",
    "the semi - flat solutions we are considering incorporate the backreaction of such objects .",
    "lastly we note that , as mentioned in  @xcite , there is a close relation between the codimension-2 t - fects that we study in this paper and the theory of non - abelian anyons and topological quantum computation  @xcite .",
    "the approach we take here , by identifying the monodromy ( or charge ) of the t - fects in terms of dehn twists , makes this analogy even more compelling , since in both situations braid groups play a central role . in the case of abelian anyons",
    ", there is also a close relation with quantum groups  @xcite",
    ". it would be interesting to see if there is a connection with the approach we develop in this paper .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section  [ sec : torusbundles ]",
    "we recall a number of elementary facts about torus fibrations and the @xmath7 mapping class group , in a way that makes easy the generalization to fibrations of arbitrary genus . in section  [ sec : tfolds ] we classify torus fibrations over a circle by means of monodromy elements in the mapping class group and we write explicit metrics for the total spaces .",
    "we then apply the same technique to fibrations in which the khler modulus undergoes non - trivial monodromies , obtaining a classification of t - fold metrics . in section  [ sec : t - walls ] we discuss a way to obtain explicit solutions for domain walls that realize t - folds backgrounds .",
    "we dub such solutions t - walls . in section  [ sec : exoticbranes ] we consider fibrations over a two - dimensional base and we derive local solutions around a degeneration with arbitrary monodromy in @xmath35 , by solving the corresponding cauchy - riemann equations for @xmath8 and @xmath19 .",
    "we refer to such degenerations as t - fects .",
    "some of these t - fects are identified with a semi - flat approximation of known brane solutions , while some of them are new exotic solutions . in section  [ sec : hyperellipticfibrations ] we briefly discuss the generalization of our results to fibrations of genus 2 surfaces and their relation to heterotic t - fects .",

    "[ app : mcg ] we recall briefly basic results regarding mapping class groups and hyperbolic maps , in appendix  [ app : braid ] we discuss the relation between the braid action on the monodromy factorization in terms of dehn twists and the familiar technique of moving branch cuts and the abc factorization used in f - theory . in appendix c and d",
    "we give some details on the semi - flat geometries and the embedding of the mapping class groups in @xmath0 .",
    "we begin by considering a @xmath9 fibration over a base @xmath2 . we will give a presentation of the results that can be readily generalized to higher genus fibrations .",

    "we will first consider torus bundles with @xmath2 a circle , and later we will study fibrations over a two dimensional base , where the circle becomes contractible .",
    "the first situation has been discussed many times in the context of scherk - schwarz dimensional reduction and as toy model for non - geometric backgrounds ( see for instance  @xcite ) , but our discussion will focus more on the role of monodromy .",
    "the case @xmath27 was introduced in  @xcite and it can be understood , for the heterotic theory , from a duality with f - theory  @xcite .",
    "this is the most interesting situation , since if one describes the auxiliary @xmath21 fibration as an elliptic fibration , the corresponding line bundles on @xmath2 that specify the fibration can be mapped explicitly to geometric compactifications on the f - theory side . reversing this map",

    "we will make precise the relation between these two approaches , and we will provide a comprehensive classification of local geometries that arise in this context .",

    "we note that some of the results we obtain can be applied in more general contexts as well .",
    "let us review some elementary facts about monodromies of torus fibrations .",
    "we leave some of the details to appendix  [ app : mcg ] .",
    "we identify the @xmath7 group with the mapping class group @xmath55 , the group of large diffeomorphisms of a two torus @xmath9 , by the standard bijective map @xmath56 it will be useful to consider a fibration @xmath57 of the @xmath9 over a circle constructed as @xmath58}{(x , 0)\\sim ( \\phi(x),2\\pi ) } \\ , , \\ ] ] where @xmath59 .",

    "a presentation of the mapping class group of the torus is given in terms of dehn twists along two closed curves @xmath62 with intersection number one , that we denote by @xmath63 , @xmath64 .",
    "we then have : @xmath65 note that the first relation is a braid relation .",

    "right : the action on @xmath66 of a dehn twist along the @xmath67-cycle , represented by the matrix @xmath63 in  . ]",
    "this gives the following matrix representation of the two dehn twists : @xmath68 which indeed satisfy  .",
    "we now study a useful classification of elements in @xmath55 .",
    "this comes from the characterization of elements in @xmath7 inherited by the classification of orientation - preserving isometries of the hyperbolic space , from the identification @xmath69 given by mbius transformation . for a given isometry @xmath26 represented by a matrix @xmath70 ,",
    "the following mutually exclusive possibilities are given :    1 .",
    "_ elliptic type _ : @xmath26 has one fixed point in @xmath71 , or equivalently @xmath72 .",

    "we also remark that this trichotomy does not exhaust all conjugacy classes in @xmath7 . indeed , there are 6 conjugacy classes of elliptic type , given by the matrices @xmath78 respectively of order 3 , 4 , 6 , together with their inverses .",
    "note that from the relations  , the inverses are given by @xmath79 the only other finite order element is @xmath80 . for parabolic elements , which are of infinite order",
    ", there are infinite conjugacy classes .",
    "note that both the @xmath63 and @xmath64 dehn twists are in the same conjugacy class ; a general representative is @xmath81 for hyperbolic elements there is a conjugacy class for each value of the trace , plus additional sporadic classes , whose number can be computed by studying equivalence classes of binary quadratic forms , as explained for example in  @xcite .",
    "two examples are given by @xmath82 we also provide a dehn twist decomposition for the sporadic elements listed in  @xcite ( some of the following matrices are conjugated to their representative matrices ) : @xmath83 the subscript indicates the trace .",
    "we note that the decomposition @xmath84 seems not to be conjugate to the element   with the same trace , @xmath85 , nor to its inverse for @xmath86 so we conjecture that this gives a list of sporadic conjugacy classes for hyperbolic elements of even trace @xmath87 , @xmath88 . case .",
    "however , we could not find any element that conjugates the matrix @xmath89 to @xmath90 or its inverse . ]",
    "the classification obtained from the trace of @xmath7 elements is reflected in a trichotomy of the corresponding torus diffeomorphisms .",
    "these are periodic , reducible and anosov maps .",
    "we refer to appendix  [ app : mcg ] for a brief review of mapping class groups .",
    "a standard result in the theory of 3-manifolds is that the class of torus diffeomorphism @xmath26 determines the geometry of the corresponding mapping torus @xmath24 , which can be either euclidean , nil or sol .",
    "we will see an example of this in the next section .",
    "we can apply the discussion of the previous section to string theory compactified on a two torus @xmath20 .",
    "an additional fibration on a circle generates a class of 3-manifolds which provides the simplest examples of nil- and sol - manifolds .",
    "if we also include monodromies in @xmath36 , classified by an auxiliary @xmath21 fibration over the circle , the resulting 3-spaces will be in general non - geometric and are usually referred to as t - folds  @xcite ( see for example  @xcite for a discussion of such spaces in various contexts ) .",
    "usually , one arrives to such spaces by performing a chain of t - duality transformations  @xcite .",
    "the simplest example is to start with a three torus @xmath91 and a b - field @xmath92 .",
    "busher rules on @xmath93 give a metric @xmath94 and @xmath95 . to make sense of the metric",
    "globally one identifies @xmath96 .",
    "note that later in this section and in section  [ sec : exoticbranes ] we will find more convenient to use conventions for which the period of @xmath97 is @xmath98 . the resulting 3-manifold is a nil geometry and it is identified with a mapping torus @xmath24 for an element @xmath99 that acts by @xmath100 .",
    "a further application of busher rules on @xmath101 gives a metric @xmath102 and a b - field @xmath103 , with @xmath104 .",
    "the monodromy is now an element of @xmath36 and acts by @xmath105 .",
    "this has a non - trivial action on the volume , and the corresponding 3-space is a t - fold .",
    "the three torus with b - field obviously is not a string vacuum , so this simple example should be considered as an illustrative toy model .",
    "an important caveat is the fact that the nilmanifold is not a principal torus fibration , and the lack of a global @xmath106 isometry makes the application of busher rules a priori not obvious . for a detailed discussion on such `` obstructed '' t - duality see for example  @xcite , and  @xcite for a discussion on how to possibly overcome this problem .",
    "our logic will be different and we do not rely on t - duality . in this section , we will classify all possible geometric and non - geometric 3-spaces from the corresponding classification of mapping class groups of the @xmath20 and @xmath21 fibrations . in the following sections , we will construct explicit solutions for such t - folds and we will use the results of this section to classify all possible local geometries around defects arising from fibration of the t - duality group on @xmath42 .",

    "the corresponding total space is a nilmanifold .",
