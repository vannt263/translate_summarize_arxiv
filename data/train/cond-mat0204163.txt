    "scaling ideas have exerted a far - reaching influence on our understanding of complex many - body systems .",
    "their use in the study of critical phenomena has offered a broad and fertile field of work at the heart of which is the wilson formulation of the renormalization group method .",
    "@xcite in the wilson view , fluctuations of the order parameter at all length scales up to the correlation length are the key ingredient in explaining the existence of power law singularities that govern critical properties in accordance with scaling laws .",
    "equally powerful is the extension of scaling concepts to anisotropic systems , namely when small anisotropic parameters are magnified as a result of their coupling to singular fluctuations .",
    "intermediate length scales thus emerge giving rise to changes or _ crossovers _ in the critical behavior.@xcite the horizon of applications of this methodology was further widened when scaling was applied to quantum critical systems for which quantum mechanics governs fluctuations of the order parameter at the critical point.@xcite    there has been a parallel expansion of the use of scaling tools in the description of _ many - fermion _ systems .",
    "this was especially true for the kondo impurity and the one - dimensional fermion gas problems . in the latter ,",
    "the reduction of spatial dimension is well known to enlarge the range of fluctuations which have a peculiar impact on the properties of the system.@xcite in this context the scaling theory commonly termed multiplicative renormalization group,@xcite contributed significantly to the completion of a coherent microscopic picture of the 1d fermion gas system as a paradigm of a non fermi @xmath0 luttinger @xmath0 liquid state . however",
    ", this scaling theory rests for the most part upon the logarithmic structure of infrared singularities that compose 1d perturbation theory and as such departs somewhat from the standard wilson picture .",
    "it remains closer to earlier formulations of the renormalization group in quantum field theory .",
    "yet , fluctuations that characterize the 1d fermion gas do show a multiplicity of length scales stretching from the shortest distance , of the order of the lattice constant , up to the quantum coherence length or the de broglie wavelength of fermions .",
    "early attempts to reexamine the properties of low dimensional fermion gas system along these lines were motivated by the coupled chains problem,@xcite which finds concrete applications in the physics of quasi - one - dimensional organic conductors .",
    "@xcite the description of interacting fermions when strong spatial anisotropy is present shares many traits with its counterpart in critical phenomena.@xcite hence the wilson method provides a powerful framework to study how deviations from perfect 1d scaling are introduced by spatial anisotropy .",
    "the corresponding length scales enter as key components of the notoriously complex description of dimensionality crossovers in which the 1d state evolves either towards the emergence of a fermi liquid or the formation of long - range order at finite temperature .",
    "the wilson renormalization group approach has attracted increasing interest in several areas of the many - fermion problem,@xcite notably in the description of two - dimensional systems in connection with high - t@xmath1 materials,@xcite fermi liquids,@xcite and ladder systems.@xcite within the bounds of this review , it would therefore be impossible to give anything more than a cursory account of the expanding literature in this field@xcite . with the goal of keeping this",
    "paper self - contained for the non - specialist , however , our interest will be more selective and will focus on the application of the renormalization group to the quasi - one - dimensional fermion gas at finite temperature.@xcite although many aspects of this problem have already been discussed in detail in previous reviews,@xcite it is useful to revisit some issues while in addition discussing features of the wilson method that deserve closer examination but which have as yet never received a detailed investigation .",
    "this is especially true in regard to the formulation of the method itself , in particular the way successive integrations over fermion states in outer momentum shells ( the kadanoff transformation ) is carried out when high order calculations are performed .",
    "we close this review by a detailed discussion of the dual nature of the kohn - luttinger mechanism@xcite from which interchain pairing correlations find their origin in quasi - one - dimensional systems.@xcite with the aid of the renormalization group,@xcite we show how this mechanism may yield instabilities of the metallic state towards either unconventional superconducting or density - wave order .    in section",
    "ii , we introduce scaling notions for fermions in low dimension from a phenomenological standpoint and predictions of the scaling hypothesis are compared to the solution in the non - interacting case in section iii .",
    "the formulation of the renormalization group in the classical wilson scheme is given in section iv and explicit calculations are carried out up to the two - loop level . in section",
    "v , the influence of interchain coupling is discussed and we go through various possibilities of dimensionality crossovers in the quasi - one - dimensional fermi gas . in section",
    "vi , we study how the kohn - luttinger mechanism for interchain pairing correlation emerges from the renormalization group flow and under what conditions it can lead to long - range order .",
    "we conclude in section vii .      before embarking on the program sketched above , it is first useful to discuss on purely phenomenological grounds how scaling notions apply to 1d and quasi-1d fermion systems .",
    "the predictions of the scaling ansatz are explicitly checked in the trivial but instructive case of the non - interacting fermi gas .",
    "let us look at how scaling ideas apply to the description of purely one - dimensional fermionic systems at low temperature .",
    "the temperature @xmath2 is the parameter that controls the quantum delocalization or the spatial coherence of each particle in one dimension .",
    "this appears as a characteristic length scale , @xmath3 , which is precisely the de broglie wavelength .",
    "the temperature dependence of @xmath3 is readily determined by considering the effect of thermal excitations on fermion states within an energy shell @xmath4 ( @xmath5 ) , where @xmath6 is the energy spectrum of fermions evaluated with respect to the fermi level . in the vicinity of the fermi points @xmath7",
    ", one has @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is the fermi velocity , and the coherence length can be written @xmath10 where the exponent @xmath11 is then equal to unity .",
    "as @xmath12 , @xmath13 goes to infinity and the system develops long - range quantum coherence .",
    "the ` time ' @xmath14 required for quantum delocalization up to @xmath3 is therefore @xmath15 which simply implies that @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the dynamical exponent of the fermion field . since ` time ' and distance must be considered on the same footing , both @xmath11 and @xmath18 can be taken as independent of interaction .",
    "let us now consider the matsubara - fourier transform @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the one - particle time - ordered correlation function expressed as a statistical average over fermion fields @xmath21 of spin @xmath22 .",
    "here @xmath23 corresponds to the matsubara frequencies . for non interacting fermions and @xmath24",
    ", @xmath25 has a simple pole singularity at @xmath26 and @xmath27 , indicating that single particle excitations are well defined .",
    "however , when fermions interact in one dimension , such a picture is expected to be altered . in the scaling picture , this can be illustrated by adding an anomalous power dependence on the wave vector near @xmath28 , namely @xmath29 the absence of a quasi - particle pole introduces @xmath30 , the anomalous dimension for the green s function ( @xmath31 where the equality occurs in the non - interacting limit ) .",
    "correspondingly , the absence of a fermi liquid component at zero temperature will affect the equal - time decay of coherence at large distance , which takes the form @xmath32 where the effective dimension @xmath33 has a space and time component .",
    "a similar decay in time takes place for large @xmath34 at @xmath35 .",
    "looking at the temperature dependence of the green s function , the scaling hypothesis allows us to write @xmath36 where @xmath37 , @xmath38 is the thermal exponent of the single particle green s function , and @xmath39 is a scaling function .",
    "consistency between eqns .",
    "( [ scalingg ] ) and ( [ scalinggk ] ) leads to the following relation between the exponents @xmath40    scaling can also be applied to the free energy per unit length , the temperature dependence of which can be expressed as @xmath41 the exponent @xmath22 is connected to the temperature variation of specific heat @xmath42 where @xmath43 as long as the ansatz @xmath44 holds for the coherence length , one then always has @xmath45 in one spatial dimension .",
    "the specific heat is therefore linear in temperature for fermions even though , according to eqn .",
    "( [ scalinggk ] ) , the system is no longer a fermi liquid at low energy .",
    "it should be noted that the familiar sommerfeld result @xmath46 for a fermi liquid ( and fermi gas ) in higher dimensions indicates that the importance put on fermion states near the fermi level one - dimensionalizes the sum over states for the evaluation of internal energy .",
    "scaling concepts can also be applied to the critical behavior of correlations that involve _ pairs _ of fermions in one dimension .",
    "superconducting and @xmath47 density - wave responses are among the pair susceptibilities that may present singularities at zero temperature .",
    "consider the matsubara - fourier transform of the susceptibility @xmath48 where @xmath49 .",
    "the time - ordered pair correlation function is @xmath50 in which @xmath51 ( @xmath52 ) are the composite operators of the superconducting ( density - wave ) channel , commonly called the cooper ( peierls ) channel . at @xmath24 , these can show long - range coherence leading to an algebraic decay of pair correlations with distance .",
    "following the example of the correlation of the order parameter at a critical point , one can write a relation of the form @xmath53 where @xmath54 is an anomalous exponent that characterizes the decay of pair correlation . here",
    "@xmath55 is the characteristic wave vector of correlations in the cooper ( peierls ) channel .",
    "a similar power law variation with time @xmath34 can also be written at small distance .",
    "correspondingly , in fourier space , one has in the static limit @xmath56 where @xmath57 refers to deviations with respect to an ordering wave vector @xmath58 in the cooper or peierls channel . for @xmath59 and at finite frequency ,",
    "a similar expression holds with @xmath57 being replaced by the frequency .",
    "now at finite temperature , the scaling hypothesis allows us to write @xmath60 where @xmath61 is scaling function ( @xmath62 ) . here the correlation length @xmath3 for the pair field is assumed to have the same power law dependence on temperature as the coherence length eqn .",
    "( [ coherence ] ) for both fermions in a pair . in fourier space",
    ", one can write for the divergence of the susceptibility in a given channel @xmath63 consistency between eqns .",
    "( [ chiqs ] ) and ( [ chiq ] ) in the static case leads to the fisher relation @xmath64 between the exponents of the static susceptibility , the correlation function and the correlation length .",
    "let us now move from one - dimensional systems to quasi - one- dimensional systems by which we mean weakly coupled chains .",
    "a dimensionality crossover in low dimensional fermion systems is induced by a small coupling between chains .",
    "the nature of this crossover will depend on the kind of coupling involved .",
    "weakly coupled chains correspond to so - called quasi - one - dimensional anisotropy , a situation realized in practice for electronic materials such as the organic conductors,@xcite lattice of spin chains , etc . in ordinary critical phenomena , scaling concepts were extended to anisotropic systems and have been successful in describing the new length scales introduced by anisotropy ; @xcite their use in the study of anisotropic fermion systems appears therefore quite natural . for example , deconfinement of quantum coherence for single particles can give rise to the restoration of a fermi liquid component below some characteristic low energy scale .",
    "in addition , the deconfinement of pair correlations in more than one spatial dimension can lead to the emergence of true long - range order at finite temperature.@xcite    let us consider first the case of interchain single - particle hopping ( fig .  [ hopping ] ) , whose amplitude @xmath65 is small compared to the fermi energy of isolated chains ( @xmath66 ) . applying the extended scaling ansatz to the single fermion",

    "@xmath73 is the crossover exponent which governs the magnification of the single - particle perturbation @xmath65 as @xmath3 increases along the chains ( fig .",
    "[ hopping ] ) .",
    "@xmath74 is called a crossover scaling function and it determines transitory aspects of the crossover and the temperature range over which it is achieved . here",
    "@xmath75 . when @xmath76 , the coherence of the fermionic system is confined along the chains and the physics",
    "is essentially dominated by the one - dimensional expression ( [ scalingg ] ) .",
    "otherwise for @xmath77 , a different temperature dependence is expected to arise .",
    "the temperature scale for the single - particle crossover is thus determined by the condition @xmath78 , that is @xmath79 well below @xmath80 and on the full fermi surface @xmath81 , one has @xmath82 where @xmath83 is the quasi - particle weight and @xmath84 is the fermi liquid exponent that restores the canonical dimension of the green s function . in order to match ( [ crossx ] ) and ( [ crossxb ] ) well below @xmath80",
    ", one must have @xcite @xmath85 where @xmath86 is a non universal constant . applying scaling to the dynamical @xmath0 coherent @xmath0 part of the single - particle green s function , the recovery of fermi liquid behavior yields @xmath87^{\\dot{\\bar{\\gamma } } } } \\ \\label{scalingg3d}\\ ] ] with @xmath88 again .",
    "interchain coupling will affect the temperature dependence of pair correlations as well , which can undergo a dimensionality crossover and in turn an instability towards the formation of long - range order either in the cooper or the peierls channel at finite temperature .",
    "this possibility is of course bound to the number of components of the order parameter and the spatial dimensionality of the system.@xcite the scaling behavior of pair correlations is therefore analogous to the one found in ordinary anisotropic critical phenomena .",
    "properties of the system close to the true critical point at @xmath89 can then be described by the usual reduced temperature @xmath90 the static pair susceptibility at some ordering wave vector @xmath91 will then diverge as @xmath92 according to @xmath93 where @xmath94 is the susceptibility exponent .    applying the extended scaling hypothesis to the static susceptibility in the superconducting or the density - wave channel ,",
    "one can write @xmath95 where @xmath96 is a crossover scaling function @xmath97 , @xmath98 is the inter - chain coupling for pairs of fermions and @xmath99 is a _",
    "two_-particle crossover exponent.@xcite following the same arguments as in the single - particle case , the change in the exponents will occur when @xmath78 , which allows us to introduce the crossover temperature for pair correlations @xmath100 it is worth noting that the interchain coupling @xmath101 for pairs of particles differs from @xmath65 , and the two - particle crossover can occur above its single particle counterpart @xmath80 , in which case the restoration of fermi liquid behavior is absent .",
    "instead only pair correlations deconfine , possibly leading to long - range order .",
    "if the scaling hypothesis holds , the expressions ( [ chitc ] ) and ( [ chix ] ) have to match near @xmath89 , which implies @xmath102 where @xmath103 is a non universal constant .",
    "another prediction of the scaling hypothesis concerns the shift in @xmath89 from zero temperature@xcite @xmath104 when the system undergoes its two - particle dimensionality crossover , the temperature dependence of singularities near @xmath89 is governed by the correlation length @xmath105 where  @xmath106 is the coherence length at @xmath107 , which fixes a short anisotropic length scales for the onset of critical fluctuations described by the exponent @xmath108 . at @xmath89 , one has the critical form @xmath109 which according to ( [ chitc ] ) leads to the fisher relation @xmath110      before facing the task of calculating the exponents and various scaling quantities of interacting fermion models , it is instructive to first analyze the properties of the free fermion gas model .",

    "on phenomenological grounds , we have emphasized that the scaling ansatz can provide a qualitative understanding of the existence of power law behavior of various quantities in one dimension while its extension for non zero interchain coupling has allowed us to describe the different forms of dimensionality crossover in the quasi - one - dimensional case .",
    "a key feature of this phenomenology is the existence of fluctuations of single fermion and pair degrees of freedom on many length or energy scales , the origin of which can be microscopically understood using the renormalization group language .",
    "we found it useful to reconsider the formulation of this methodology and we have seen that the adoption of a classical wilson procedure for the kadanoff transformation has a molding influence on the rg flow beyond the one - loop level .",
    "thus the constraint of a sharp natural cutoff @xmath377 on the fermion spectrum which keeps the loop momenta in the outer energy shells inevitably leads to a non - local flow of the parameters that define the action .",

    "although this has only been verified at the two - loop loop level and in the one - dimensional case , similar conclusions are expected to hold at higher order and in higher dimensions as well .",
    "the procedure described in this review casts light on a previous alternative formulation of the rg which is known to offer a more direct route to logarithmic scaling at high order but which on the other hand requires the relaxation of some of the standard rules of the wilson method .",
    "it also highlights how the difficulties linked to non - locality of the flow equations are essentially hidden in older versions of the renormalization group .",
    "the rg method is widely recognized as a tool well suited to the study of the influence of interchain hopping on the stability of the luttinger and luther - emery liquid states in one dimension .",
    "we have reviewed the conditions under which the coupling between stacks can make these non - fermi liquid states unstable .",
    "a possible instability occurs when the luttinger liquid yields to the formation of a fermi liquid .",

    "a second instability emerges when the kinematics of interchain single - particle hopping is combined with intrachain pair correlations .",
    "effective pair hopping processes between chains then form and their coupling to singular correlations along the chains lead to a distinct ( two - particle ) dimensionality crossover .",
    "this is physically meaningful as long as the corresponding temperature scale is above the one predicted for single particles .",
    "such a situation is favored by cranking up interactions which on the one hand increases pair correlations and on the other hand reduces single particle coherence .",
    "the temperature scale for two - particle dimensionality crossover marks the onset of long - range order which accords well with the extended scaling ansatz . for sufficiently weak interactions , however , single - particle deconfinement occurs first and the possibility for long - range order remains as an instability of the fermi liquid . in this case",
    ", the ladder level of the rg gives a bcs character to the transition .",
    "the rg method can also be useful in studying how the kohn - luttinger mechanism for unconventional pairing works in the quasi - one - dimensional case .",
    "we have seen that this mechanism opens up channels of correlation which pair particles on different stacks as a result of pair hopping processes between chains .",
    "since these are present in both the peierls and cooper channels , the kohn - luttinger mechanism has a dual nature .",
    "thus it was shown not only that the exchange of density - wave correlations can lead to interchain cooper pairing but also that interchain peierls pairing between a particle and a hole is also possible when both particles exchange cooper pairs .",
    "long - range order in these unconventional channels can only be achieved from the fermi liquid state in which enough nesting deviations or magnetic field are present to frustrate the formation of long - range order in the the primary channels of correlation along the chains .",
    "the results presented in this review by no means exhaust the range of possibilities supplied by the rg method .",
    "we will end this article by giving two specific examples .",
    "the first concerns the issue of single - particle deconfinement that leads to the recovery of a fermi liquid .",
    "this question is of great interest especially in connection with the normal state properties obeserved in concrete realizations of quasi - one - dimensional materials like the organic conductors.@xcite we have seen that the critical domain of the primary ( luttinger liquid ) fixed point in a quasi - one - dimensional system essentially covers the whole temperature range of interest .",
    "this favors in turn a slow and gradual crossover to a fermi liquid , which means in practice that transitory effects are likely to be important in the description of these materials .",
    "although crossover scaling effects have been underestimated in the treatment given above , they are not beyond the reach of the rg method .    another promising avenue is the application of the rg method to interacting fermions on a lattice.@xcite the kadanoff transformation can actually be generalized to fermions with the full tight binding spectrum .",
    "transients to the continuum limit can then be considered in a quantitative way . in the case of the fermion representation of the one - dimensional spin chain , for example , this has been shown to be an essential ingredient in the description of the thermodynamics .",
