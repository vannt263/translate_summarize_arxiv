    "however , alternative models do exist : cold , pressure confined clouds ( eg . barcons & fabian 1987 , but see rauch et  al .",
    "1993 ) ; various shock mechanisms ( vishniac & bust 1987 , hogan 1987 ) .",
    "low and medium resolution spectroscopic studies of the forest generally measure the redshift and equivalent width of each cloud . at higher resolutions it is possible to measure the redshift ( @xmath7 ) , h  i column density ( @xmath8 , atoms per @xmath9 ) and doppler parameter ( @xmath10 , ) .",
    "these are obtained by fitting a voigt profile to the data ( rybicki & lightman 1979 ) .    using a list of @xmath8 , @xmath7 and @xmath10 measurements , and their associated error estimates ,",

    "there is a local decrease in cloud numbers near the background quasar which is normally attributed to the additional ionizing flux in that region . while this may not be the only reason for the depletion ( the environment near quasars may be different in other respects ; the cloud redshifts may reflect systematic motions ) it is expected for the standard physical models wherever the ionising flux from the quasar exceeds , or is comparable to , the background",
    ".    since the generally accepted cloud models are both optically thin to ionizing radiation and highly ionized , it is possible to correct column densities from the observed values to those that would be seen if the quasar were more remote .",
    "the simplest correction assumes that the shape of the two incident spectra  quasar and background  are similar . in this case",
    "the column density of the neutral fraction is inversely proportional to the incident ionizing flux .",
    "if the flux from the quasar is known , and the depletion of clouds is measured from observations , the background flux can be determined . by observing absorption towards quasars at different redshifts",
    "the evolution of the flux can be measured .",
    "bechtold ( 1993 ) summarises earlier measurements of the ionising flux , both locally and at higher redshifts .",
    "recently loeb & eisenstein ( 1995 ) have suggested that enhanced clustering near quasars causes this approach to overestimate the background flux .",
    "if this is the case then an analysis which can also study the evolution of the effect gives important information . in particular , a decrease in the inferred flux might be expected after the redshift where the quasar population appears to decrease . however , if the postulated clustering enhancement is related to the turn  on of quasars at high redshift , it may conspire to mask any change in the ionizing background .",
    "section [ sec : model ] describes the model of the population density in more detail , including the corrections to flux and redshift that are necessary for a reliable result .",
    "the data used are described in section [ sec : data ] . in section [ sec : errors ] the quality of the fit is assessed and the procedure used to calculate errors in the derived parameters is explained .",

    "section [ sec : conc ] concludes the paper .",
    "the doppler parameter distribution is not included in the model since it is not needed to determine the ionizing background from the proximity effect .",
    "the model here assumes that @xmath8 and @xmath7 are uncorrelated .",
    "while this is unlikely ( carswell 1995 ) , it should be a good approximation over the restricted range of column densities considered here .",
    "the model of the population without doppler parameters or the correction for the proximity effect is @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the hubble parameter , @xmath13 is the cosmological deceleration parameter and @xmath14 is the speed of light .",
    "correcting for the ionizing flux and changing from ` original ' ( @xmath15 ) to ` observed ' ( @xmath8 ) column densities , gives @xmath16 where @xmath17 @xmath18 and @xmath19 is the background flux , @xmath20 is the flux from the quasar ( @xmath21 ) .",
    "the background flux @xmath22 may vary with redshift . here",
    "it is parameterised as a constant , a power law , or two power laws with a break which is fixed at @xmath23 ( the mid  point of the available data range ) .",
    "an attempt was made to fit models with @xmath24 as a free parameter , but the models were too poorly constrained by the data to be useful .",
    "@xmath25    a large amount of information ( figure [ fig : nz ] ) is used to constrain the model parameters .",
    "the high  resolution line lists give the column density and redshift , with associated errors , for each line . to calculate the background ionising flux the quasar luminosity and redshift must be known ( table [ tab : objects ] ) .",
    "finally , each set of lines must have observational completeness limits ( table [ tab : compl ] ) .",
    "malmquist bias is a common problem when fitting models to a population which increases rapidly at some point ( often near an observational limit ) .",
    "errors during the observations scatter lines away from the more populated regions of parameter space and into less populated areas .",
    "line blending occurs when , especially at high redshifts , nearby , overlapping lines can not be individually resolved .",
    "this is a consequence of the natural line width of the clouds and can not be corrected with improved spectrographic resolution .",
    "the end result is that weaker lines are not detected in the resultant ` blend ' .",
    "both these effects mean that the observed population is not identical to the ` underlying ' or ` real ' distribution .      to calculate a correction for malmquist bias we need to understand the significance of the error estimate since any correction involves understanding what would happen if the ` same ' error occurs for different column density clouds .",
    "the same physical cloud can not be observed with completely different parameters , but the same combination of all the complex factors which influence the errors might affect a line with different parameters in a predictable way . if this idea of the ` quality ' of an observation could be quantified it would be possible to correct for malmquist bias : rather than the ` underlying ' population , one reflecting the quality of the observation ( ie . including the bias due to observational errors ) could be fitted to the data .",
    "for example , if the ` quality ' of an observation was such that , whatever the actual column density measured , the error in column density was the same , then it would be trivial to convolve the ` underlying ' model with a gaussian of the correct width to arrive at an ` observed ' model",
    ". fitting the latter to the data would give parameters unaffected by malmquist bias .",
    "another example is the case of galaxy magnitudes .",
    "the error in a measured magnitude is a fairly simple function of source brightness , exposure time , etc .",
    ", and so it is possible to correct a flux ",
    "limited galaxy survey for malmquist bias .",
    "it may be possible to describe the quality of a spectrum by the signal to noise level in each bin .",
    "from this one could , for a given line , calculate the expected error in the equivalent width .",
    "the error in the equivalent width might translate , depending on whether the absorption line was in the linear or logarithmic portion of the ` curve of growth ' , to a normal error in either @xmath8 or @xmath26 .",
    "but in this idealised case it has been assumed that the spectrum has not been re  binned , leaving the errors uncorrelated ; that the effect of overlapping , blended lines is unimportant ; that there is a sudden transition from a linear to logarithmic curve of growth ; that the resulting error is well described by a normal distribution .",
    "none of this is likely to be correct and , in any case , the resulting analysis , with different ` observed ' populations for every line , would be too unwieldy to implement , given current computing facilities .    a more pragmatic approach might be possible .",
    "a plot of the distribution of errors with column density ( figure  [ fig : ndn ] ) suggests that the errors in @xmath26 are of a similar magnitude for a wide range of lines ( although there is a significant correlation between the two parameters ) .",
    "could the error in @xmath26 be a sufficiently good indicator of the ` quality ' of an observation ?",
    "= 8.5 cm    if the number density of the underlying population is @xmath27 then the observed population density for a line with error in @xmath26 of @xmath28 is : @xmath29 for a power law distribution this can be calculated analytically and gives an increased probability of seeing lines with larger errors , as expected . for an underlying population density",
    "@xmath30 the increase is @xmath31 .",
    "this gives a lower statistical weight to lines with larger errors when fitting .",
    "for this case  a power law and log  normal errors  the weighting is not a function of @xmath8 directly , which might imply that any correction would be uniform , with little bias expected for estimated parameters .    in practice",
    "this correction does not work .",
    "this is probably because the exponential dependence of the correction on @xmath28 makes it extremely sensitive to the assumptions made in the derivation above .",
    "these assumptions are not correct .",
    "for example , it seems that the correlation between  and the associated error is important .",
    "it is possible to do a simple numerical simulation to gauge the magnitude of the effect of malmquist bias .",
    "a population of ten million column densities were selected at random from a power law distribution ( @xmath32 ) as an ` unbiased ' sample .",
    "each line was given an ` observed ' column density by adding a random error distributed with a normal or log  normal ( for lines where @xmath33 ) distribution , with a mean of zero and a standard deviation in @xmath26 of @xmath34 .",
    "this procedure is a simple approximation to the type of errors coming from the curve of growth analysis discussed above , assuming that errors are approximately constant in @xmath26 ( figure  [ fig : ndn ] ) .",
    "the size of the error is larger than typical , so any inferred change in @xmath35 should be an upper limit .",
    "since a power  law distribution diverges as @xmath36 a normal distribution of errors in @xmath8 would give an infinite number of observed lines at every column density .",
    "this is clearly unphysical ( presumably the errors are not as extended as in a normal distribution and the population has some low column density limit ) .",
    "because of this the ` normal ' errors above were actually constrained to lie within 3 standard deviations of zero .",
    "= 8.5 cm    the results ( figure  [ fig : malm ] ) show that malmquist bias has only a small effect , at least for the model used here .",
    "the main solid line is the original sample , the dashed line is the observed population . note that the results in this paper come from fitting to a sample of lines with @xmath37 ( section  [ sec : data ] )  corresponding to the data shown expanded to the upper right of the figure .",
    "lines with smaller column densities are not shown since that fraction of the population is affected by the lower density cut  off in the synthetic data .",
    "a comparison with the two reference lines , showing the slopes for a population with @xmath38 or @xmath39 ( dashed ) , indicates that the expected change in @xmath35 is @xmath40 .",
    "the population of lines within the logarithmic region of the curve of growth appears to be slightly enhanced , but otherwise the two curves are remarkably similar .",
    "the variations at large column densities are due to the small number of strong lines in the sample .",
    "what other approaches can be used to measure or correct the effects of malmquist bias and line blending ?",
    "press & rybicki ( 1993 ) used a completely different analysis of the lyman@xmath0 forest .",
    "generating and reducing synthetic data , with a known background and cloud population , would allow us to assess the effect of blending .",
    "changing ( sub  setting ) the sample of lines that is analysed will alter the relative ( and , possibly , absolute ) importance of the two effects .    the procedure used by press & rybicki ( 1993 )",
    "is not affected by malmquist bias or line blending , but it is difficult to adapt to measure the ionizing background .",
    "profile fitting to high  resolution data is a slow process , involving significant manual intervention ( we have tried to automate profile  fitting with little success ) .",
    "an accurate measurement of the systematic error in the ionizing background would need an order of magnitude more data than is used here to get sufficiently low error limits . even if this is possible",
    " the analysis would need a prohibitive amount of cpu time  it would be sufficient work for a separate , major paper ( we would be glad to supply our software to anyone willing to try this ) .    taking a sub  set of the data is not helpful unless it is less likely to be affected by the biases described above .",
    "one approach might be to reject points with large errors , or large relative errors , in column density since these are more affected by malmquist bias .",
    "however , this would make the observations incomplete in a very poorly understood way .",
    "for example , relative errors are correlated with column density ( as noted above ) and so rejecting lines with larger relative errors would preferentially reject higher column density lines .",
    "there is no sense in trying to measure one bias if doing so introduces others .",
    "unlike rejecting lines throughout the sample , changing the completeness limit does not alter the coverage of the observations ( or rather , it does so in a way that is understood and corrected for within the analysis ) .",
    "raising the completeness limits should make line blending less important since weaker lines , which are most likely to be blended , are excluded from the fit . whether it affects the malmquist bias depends on the distribution of errors .    for blended lines , which tend to be weak , raising the completeness limit should increase the absolute value of @xmath35 since the more populous region of the ( hypothetical ) power  law population of column densities",
    "will no longer be artificially depleted . the effect on @xmath41",
    "is more difficult to assess since it is uncertain whether the completeness limits are correct at each redshift .",
    "if the limits increase too rapidly with redshift , for example , then raising them further will reduce blending most at lower redshifts , lowering @xmath41 .",
    "but if they are increasing too slowly then the converse will be true .",
    "until either profile  fitting is automated , or the method of press & rybicki ( 1993 ) can be modified to include the proximity effect , these two sources of uncertainty  malmquist bias and line blending  will continue be a problem for any analysis of the lyman@xmath0 forest .",
    "however , from the arguments above , it is likely that the effect of malmquist bias is small and that , by increasing the completeness limit , we can assess the magnitude of the effect of line blending .",
    "extinction within our galaxy reduces the apparent luminosity of the quasars and so lowers the estimate of the background .",
    "since the absorption varies with frequency this also alters the observed spectral slope .",
    "observed fluxes were corrected using extinction estimates derived from the h  i measurements of heiles & cleary ( 1979 ) for q2204573 and stark et  al .",
    "( 1992 ) for all the other objects .",

    "a ratio @xmath45 of 3.0 ( lockman & savage 1995 ) was used and variations of extinction with frequency , @xmath46 were taken from cardelli , clayton & mathis ( 1989 ) .    the correction to the observed index , @xmath47 , of the power  law continuum , @xmath48 was calculated using @xmath49 which , using the notation of cardelli , clayton & mathis ( 1989 ) , becomes @xmath50      two quasars are known to have damped absorption systems along the line of sight ( wolfe et  al .",

    "this is not consistent with malmquist bias , which would give a smaller change in @xmath35 ( section  [ sec : malm ] ) , but could be a result of either line blending or a population in which @xmath35 increases with column density . the latter explanation is also consistent with cristiani et  al .",

    "recent work by hu et  al .",
    "( 1995 ) , however , using data with better signal  to  noise and resolution , finds that the distribution of column densities is described by a single power law ( @xmath55 ) until @xmath56 , when line blending in in their sample becomes significant .",
    "it might be possible that their sample is not sufficiently large ( 66 lines with @xmath57 , compared with 192 here ) to detect a steeper distribution of high column density lines .",
    "the change in @xmath41 as completeness limits are raised may reflect the decrease in line blending at higher column densities .",
    "this suggests that the value here is an over  estimate , although the shift is within the 95% confidence interval .",
    "no estimate is significantly different from the value of 2.46 found by press & rybicki ( 1993 ) ( again , using a method less susceptible to blending problems ) .",
    "the likelihood ratio statistic ( equivalent to the ` f test ' ) , comparing model * a * with any other , indicates that the null hypothesis ( that the proximity effect , as described by the model here , should be disregarded ) can be rejected with a confidence exceeding 99.9% .",
    "note that this confirmation is based on the likelihood values in table  [ tab : fpars ] .",
    "this test is much more powerful than the k",
    " s test ( section  [ sec : finalq ] ) which was only used to see whether the models were sufficiently good for the likelihood ratio test to be used .    to reiterate : if model * a * and model * b * are taken as competing descriptions of the population of lyman@xmath0  clouds , then the likelihood ratio test , which allows for the extra degree of freedom introduced , strongly favours a description which includes the proximity effect .",
    "the model without the proximity effect is firmly rejected .",
    "this does not imply that the interpretation of the effect ( ie .",
    "additional ionization by background radiation ) is correct , but it does indicate that the proximity effect , in the restricted , statistical sense above , is ` real ' ( cf .",
    "rser 1995 ) .    if the assumptions behind this analysis are correct , in particular that the proximity effect is due to the additional ionising flux from the quasar , then the average value of the background is 100@xmath2  j@xmath3  ( model * b * ) .",
    "if a more flexible model for the background ( two power laws ) is used the flux is consistent with a value of 120@xmath58  j@xmath3(model * d * at @xmath59 ) .",
    "five sources of systematic error are discussed here : malmquist bias and line blending ; reddening by damped absorption systems ; increased clustering of clouds near quasars ; the effect of gravitational lensing .    the constraints on the background given here may be affected by malmquist bias and line blending ( sections [ sec : malm ] and [ sec : dispop ] ) .",
    "the effects of line blending will be discussed further in section  [ sec : gerry ] , where a comparison with a different procedure suggests that it may cause us to over  estimate the flux ( by perhaps @xmath60 dex ) .",
    "malmquist bias is more likely to affect parameters sensitive to absolute column densities than those which rely only on relative changes in the observed population .",
    "so while this may have an effect on @xmath35 , it should have much less influence on the inferred background value .",
    "attenuation by intervening damped absorption systems will lower the apparent quasar flux and so give an estimate for the background which is too low .",
    "this is corrected in model * e * , which includes adjustments for the known damped systems ( section [ sec : dampcor ] , table  [ tab : damp ] ) .",
    "the change in the inferred background flux is insignificant ( figure [ fig : evoln ] , table  [ tab : fpars ] ) , implying that the magnitude of the bias is less than 0.1 dex .",
    "if quasars lie in regions of increased absorption line clustering ( loeb & eisenstein 1995 ; yurchenko , lanzetta & webb 1995 ) then the background flux may be overestimated by up to 0.5 , or even 1 , dex .",
    "gravitational lensing may change the apparent brightness of a quasar  in general the change can make the quasar appear either brighter or fainter .",
    "absorption line observations are made towards the brightest quasars known ( to get good quality spectra ) .",
    "since there are more faint quasars than bright ones this will preferentially select objects which have been brightened by lensing ( see the comments on malmquist bias in section  [ sec : malm ] ) .",
    "an artificially high estimate of the quasar flux will cause us to over  estimate the background .",
    "unfortunately , models which assess the magnitude of the increase in quasar brightness are very sensitive to the model population of lensing objects . from pei ( 1995 )",
    "an upper limit consistent with observations is an increase in flux of about 0.5 magnitudes , corresponding to a background estimate which is too high by a factor of 1.6 ( 0.2 dex ) . the probable effect",
    ", however , could be much smaller ( blandford & narayan 1992 ) .",
    "if bright quasars are more likely to be lensed we can make a rudimentary measurement of the effect by splitting the data into two separate samples . when fitted with a constant background ( model * b * )",
    "the result for the five brightest objects is indeed brighter than that for the remaining six , by 0.1 dex .",
    "the errors , however , are larger ( 0.3 dex ) , making it impossible to draw any useful conclusions .",
    "the effects of malmquist bias , line blending and damped absorption systems are unlikely to change the results here significantly .",
    "cloud clustering and gravitational lensing could be more important  in each case the background would be over  estimated .",
    "the magnitude of these last two biases is not certain , but cloud clustering seems more likely to be significant .",
    "more complex models allow the background flux to vary with redshift .",
    "if the flux does evolve then these models should fit the data better .",
    "however , there is no significant change in the fit when comparing the likelihood of models * c * to * e * with that of * b*. nor are @xmath61 or @xmath62 significantly different from zero .",
    "so there is no significant evidence for a background which changes with redshift .",
    "the asymmetries in the wings of the posterior distributions of @xmath61 or @xmath62 for model * d * ( figure [ fig : alphas_d ] ) are a result of the weak constraints on upper limits ( see next section ) .",
    "the box plots in figure [ fig : flux_both ] illustrate the range of evolutions that are possible .",
    "while there is little evidence here for evolution of the background , the upper limits to the background flux diverge more strongly than the lower limits at the lowest and highest redshifts .",
    "also , the posterior probability of the background is extended more towards higher values .",
    "the background was measured by comparing its effect with that of the quasar .",
    "if the background were larger the quasar would have less effect and the clouds with @xmath63 would not need as large a correction to the observed column density for them to agree with the population as a whole .",
    "if the background was less strong then the quasars would have a stronger influence and more clouds would be affected .",
    "the upper limit to the flux depends on clouds influenced by the quasar .",
    "figure [ fig : prox ] shows how @xmath64 changes with redshift and proximity to the background quasar . from this figure",
    "it is clear that the upper limit is dominated by only a few clouds .",
    "however , the lower limit also depends on clouds near to , but not influenced by , the quasar .",
    "this involves many more clouds .",
    "the lower limit is therefore stronger , more uniform , and less sensitive to the amount of data , than the upper limit .",
    "other procedures for calculating the errors in the flux have assumed that the error is symmetrical ( the only apparent exception is fernndez ",
    "soto et  al .",
    "( 1995 ) who unfortunately had insufficient data to normalize the distribution ) .",
    "while this is acceptable for @xmath35 and @xmath41 , whose posterior probability distributions ( figure  [ fig : beta_gamma_d ] ) can be well  approximated by gaussian curves , it is clearly wrong for the background ( eg . figure  [ fig : flux_both ] ) , especially where there are less data ( at the lowest and highest redshifts ) .    an estimate based on the assumption that the error is normally distributed will be biased in two ways .",
    "first , since the extended upper bound to the background has been ignored , it will underestimate the ` best ' value .",
    "second , since the error bounds are calculated from the curvature of the posterior distribution at its peak ( ie . from the hessian matrix ) they will not take account of the extended ` tails ' and so will underestimate the true range of values .",
    "in addition , most earlier work has calculated errors assuming that the other population parameters are fixed at their best  fit values .",
    "this will also under  estimate the true error limits .",

    "this may be , at least partly , because of the biases discussed in section  [ sec : lims ] .",
    "williger et  al .",
    "( 1994 ) used a more direct method than usual to estimate the background .",
    "this gives a useful constraint on the effect of line blending in the procedures used , and is explored in more detail below .",
    "the measured value of the background , 80@xmath72  j@xmath3  ( model * d * at @xmath73 ) , is larger than an earlier estimate using a subset of this data ( williger et  al .",
    "1994 , q1033033 , @xmath71  j@xmath3 ) .",
    "as has already been argued , it is difficult to understand how a procedure using much less data could have smaller error limits than the results here , so it is likely that the error was an underestimate and that the two results are consistent .",
    "however , it is interesting to see if there is also a systematic bias in the analyses used .",
    "the correction for galactic absorption is not very large for this object ( about 20% ) .",
    "more importantly , the procedures used differ significantly in how they are affected by blended lines .",
    "these are a problem at the highest redshifts , where the increased lyman@xmath0  cloud population density means that it is not always possible to resolve individual clouds .",
    "williger et  al .",
    "( 1994 ) added additional lines ( @xmath74 , @xmath10 = 30  ) to their @xmath7 = 4.26 spectra of q1033033 and found that between 40% and 75% would be missed in the line list .",
    "as the lower column density limit is raised williger et  al .",
    "( 1994 ) find that the observed value of @xmath41 also increases .",
    "the resulting stronger redshift evolution would make the deficit of clouds near the quasar more significant and so give a lower estimate of the background .",
    "although not significant at the 95% level , there is an indication that @xmath41 also increases with higher column density in this analysis ( section [ sec : dispop ] , figure [ fig : var_d ] ) . while it is possible that @xmath41 varies with column density the same dependence",
    "would be expected if line blending is reducing the number of smaller clouds . to understand how line blending can affect the estimates",
    ", we will now examine the two analyses in more detail .",
    "line blending makes the detection of lines less likely . near",
    "the quasar lines are easier to detect because the forest is more sparse . in the analysis used in this paper the appearance of these ` extra ' lines",
    "reduces the apparent effect of the quasar .",
    "alternatively , one can say that away from the quasar line blending lowers @xmath41 .",
    "both arguments describe the same process and imply that the estimated background flux is too large .",
    "in contrast , williger et  al .",
    "( 1994 ) take a line  list from a crowded region , which has too few weak lines and correspondingly more saturated lines , and reduce the column densities until they agree with a region closer to the quasar .",
    "since a few saturated lines are less sensitive to the quasar s flux than a larger number of weaker lines , the effect of this flux is over  estimated ( and poorly determined ) , making the background seem less significant and giving a final value for the background flux which is too small .",
    "this method is therefore biased in the opposite sense to ours and so the true value of the background probably lies between their estimate and ours .    the comparison with williger et  al .",
    "( 1994 ) gives one estimate of the bias from line blending .",
    "another can be made by raising the completeness limits of the data ( section  [ sec : malm ] ) .",
    "this should decrease the number of weak , blended lines , but also excludes approximately half the data . in figure",
    "[ fig : flux_both ] the flux estimates from the full data set are shown together with those from one in which the limits have been raised by @xmath75 .",
    "there is little change in the lowest reasonable flux , an increase in the upper limits , and in increase in the ` best  fit ' values .",
    "the flux for @xmath76 is almost unconstrained by the restricted sample ( section  [ sec : lims ] explains the asymmetry ) .",
    "an increase of 0.5 in @xmath26 is a substantial change in the completeness limits . that the lower limits remain constant ( to within @xmath77 dex )",
    "suggests that line blending is not causing the flux to be significantly over  estimated .",
    "the increase in the upper limits is expected when the number of clouds in the sample decreases ( section  [ sec : lims ] ) .    in summary , the total difference between our measurement and that in williger et  al .",
    "( 1994 ) is 0.7 dex which can be taken as an upper limit on the effect of line blending .",
    "however , a more typical value , from the constancy of the lower limits when completeness limits are raised , is probably @xmath78 dex .",
    "bechtold ( 1994 ) analysed lower resolution spectra towards 34 quasars using equivalent widths rather than individual column density measurements .",
    "she derived a background flux of 300  j@xmath3(@xmath79 ) , decreasing to 100  j@xmath3  when a uniform correction was applied to correct for non  systemic quasar redshifts . with low  resolution data a value of @xmath35",
    "is used to change from a distribution of equivalent widths to column densities . if @xmath35 is decreased from 1.7 to a value closer to that found for narrower lines ( see section  [ sec : dispop ] ) then the inferred background estimate could decrease further .",
    "the evolution was not well  constrained ( @xmath80 ) .",
    "no distinction was made between the lower and upper constraints on the flux estimate , and it is likely that the wide range of values reflects the lack of strong upper constraints which we see in our analysis .",
    "it is not clear to what extent this analysis is affected by line blending .",
    "certainly the comments above  that relatively more clouds will be detected near the quasar  also apply .",
    "the background intensity presented in this paper is much larger than the 8  j@xmath3  upper limit at @xmath81 found by vogel et  al .",
    "kulkarni & fall ( 1993 ) obtain an even lower value of 0.6@xmath82  j@xmath3  at @xmath83 by analysing the proximity effect in hst observations .",
    "however , even an unevolving flux will decrease by a factor of @xmath84 between @xmath65 and @xmath85 , so such a decline is not inconsistent with the results given here .",
    "quasars are likely to provide a significant , if not dominant , contribution to the extragalactic background .",
    "an estimate of the ionizing background can be calculated from models of the quasar population .",
    "figure [ fig : evoln ] shows the constraints from models * d * and * e * and compares them with the expected evolution of the background calculated by fall & pei ( 1995 ) .",
    "the background can take a range of values ( the shaded region ) , with the lower boundary indicating the expected trend for a dust  free universe and larger values taking into account those quasars that may be hidden from our view , but which still contribute to the intergalactic ionizing flux .",
    "the hypothesis that the flux is only from visible quasars ( the unobscured model in fall & pei 1995 ) is formally rejected at over the 95% significance level since the predicted evolution is outside the 95% bar in the box plots at higher redshift .",
    "although our background estimate excludes a simple quasar  dominated model based on the observed number of such objects , the analysis here may give a background flux which is biased ( too large ) from a combination of line blending ( section  [ sec : gerry ] ) and clustering around the background quasars . from the comparison with williger et  al .",
    "( 1994 ) , above , there is an upper limit on the correction for line blending , at the higher redshifts , of 0.7 dex .",
    "however , an analysis of the data when column density completeness limits were increased by @xmath75 suggests that a change in the lower limits here of @xmath77 dex is more likely . a further change of up to between 0.5 and 1 dex is possible if quasars lie in regions of increased clustering ( section  [ sec : syserr ] ) .",
    "these two effects imply that at the highest redshifts the flux measured here could reasonably overestimate the real value by @xmath86 dex .",
    "this could make the measurements marginally consistent with the expected flux from the observed population of quasars .",
    "there is also some uncertainty in the expected background from quasars since observations could be incomplete even at the better understood lower redshifts ( eg .",
    "goldschmidt et  al . 1992 ) and while absorption in damped systems is understood in theory ( fall & pei 1993 ) its effect is uncertain ( particularly because the distribution of high column density systems is poorly constrained ) .",
    "the highest flux model ( largest population of obscured quasars ) from fall & pei ( 1995 ) is consistent with the measurements here ( assuming that the objects used in this paper are not significantly obscured ) .      the background appears to be stronger than the integrated flux from the known quasar population .",
    "can star formation at high redshifts explain the discrepancy ?",
    "recent results from observations of low redshift starbursts ( leitherer et  al .",
    "1995 ) suggest that very few ionizing photons ( @xmath87% ) escape from these systems",
    ". if high redshift starbursts are similar in their properties , then the presence of cool gas in these objects would similarly limit their contribution to the ionizing background .",
    "however , madau & shull ( 1996 ) estimate that if star formation occurs in lyman@xmath0  clouds , and a significant fraction of the ionizing photons ( @xmath88 ) escape , then these photons may contribute a substantial fraction of the ionizing background photons in their immediate vicinity . as an example , at @xmath89  they estimate that @xmath90  if star formation sets in at @xmath91 .",
    "this flux would dominate the lowest ( no correction for obscuration ) quasar background shown in figure [ fig : evoln ] and could be consistent with the intensity we estimate for the background at this redshift , given the possible systematic biases discussed above and in section  [ sec : syserr ] .",
    "a model has been fitted to the population of lyman@xmath0  clouds .",
    "the model includes the relative effect of the ionising flux from the background and nearby quasars ( section  [ sec : model ] ) .",
    "the derived model parameters for the population of absorbers are generally consistent with earlier estimates .",
    "there is some evidence that @xmath35 , the column density power law population exponent , increases with column density , but could also be due to line blending ( section  [ sec : dispop ] ) .",
    "the ionising background is estimated to be 100@xmath2  j@xmath3(model * b * , section  [ sec : resbackg ] ) over the range of redshifts ( @xmath92 ) covered by the data .",
    "no strong evidence for evolution in the ionizing background is seen over this redshift range . in particular , there is no significant evidence for a decline for @xmath93 ( section  [ sec : noevoln ] ) .",
    "previous results may have been biased ( too low , with optimistic error limits  section  [ sec : lims ] ) .",
    "constraints on the evolution of the background are shown in figure [ fig : evoln ] .",
    "the estimates are not consistent with the background flux expected from the observed population of quasars ( section  [ sec : source ] ) . however , two effects are likely to be important .",
    "first , both line blending and increased clustering of clouds near quasars lead to the measured background being overestimated .",
    "second , a significant fraction of the quasar population at high redshifts may be obscured . since their contribution to the background",
    "would then be underestimated this would imply that current models of the ionizing background are too low .",
    "both of these would bring the expected and measured fluxes into closer agreement .",
    "it is also possible that gravitational lensing makes the measurement here an overestimate of the true background .",
    "the dominant source of errors in our work is the limited number of lines near the background quasar ( eg . figures [ fig : nu1_d ]  and [ fig : prox ] ) .",
    "systematic errors are smaller and become important only if it is necessary to make standard ( unobscured quasar ) models for the background consistent with the lower limits presented here .",
    "further data will therefore make the estimate here more accurate , although observational data are limited by confusion of the most numerous lower column density systems ( @xmath94 ) so it will remain difficult to remove the bias from line blending .",
    "an improvement in the errors for the highest redshift data points , or a determination of the shape of the ionizing spectrum ( e.g. from he  ii / h  i estimates in lyman@xmath0  clouds ) would help in discriminating between current competing models for the ionizing background .",
    "finally , a determination of the background strength in the redshift range @xmath95 is still needed .",
