    "accurate measurements of the hydrogen isotopic ratio d / h at high redshifts may allow us to test experimentally the basis of the standard model of big bang nucleosynthesis ( bbn )  its homogeneity .",
    "a homogeneous bbn implies a _ uniform _ distribution of the d abundance among the absorbing systems with low metallicity since ` no realistic astrophysical process other than the big bang could produce significant d ' ( schramm 1998 , p.6 ) .",
    "first high quality spectral data of qsos suggested , however , a dispersion in d / h  @xmath7 @xmath8 ( the ratio of the di and hi column densities ) of about one order of magnitude ( for a summary , see burles et al .",
    "this finding provoked a lively discussion in the literature on inhomogeneous models of bbn ( dolgov & pagel 1999 and references cited therein ) .",
    "but later , it was shown that a single d / h value of about @xmath9 is sufficient to describe all observations available up to now ( levshakov et al .",
    "1998a , 1998b , 1999b ) .    a new result by molaro et al . ( 1999 , hereafter mbcv )",
    ", if confirmed , could challenge again the uniformity of the d / h space distribution because a very low deuterium abundance of @xmath0 was found in an extremely low metallicity system at @xmath3 towards apm 08279 + 5255 .",
    "mbcv consider the derived d abundance as a lower limit because their analysis was based on a simplified one - component model of the absorbing cloud which failed to fit the red wing of the ly@xmath5 line .",
    "they note that the observed complex structure of civ and siiv implies the presence of more than one component .",
    "they further state that ` additional components are required to reproduce the extra absorption on the red wing of ly@xmath5 ' which would decrease the hi column density for the major component leading to a higher deuterium abundance .    following the mbcv suggestions ,",
    "we have analyzed the absorption profiles of hi , cii , civ , siiii , and siiv by using our new monte carlo inversion ( mci ) algorithm ( levshakov et al .",
    "1999c , hereafter lak ) . in the present letter",
    "we show that the actual neutral hydrogen column density may be a factor of @xmath10 lower than the value of mbcv , a fact preventing any accurate measurements of the deuterium abundance in the @xmath3 system .",
    "the main difference between mbcv s analysis and our approach is that the former was performed in the framework of the microturbulent approximation using the standard voigt fitting procedure , whereas the latter is based on a more general mesoturbulent model which describes the process of line formation in the absorbing clouds more adequately ( levshakov & kegel 1997 ) . in both cases the same spectra of apm 08279 + 5255 obtained with the keck - i telescope and the hires spectrograph by ellison et al .",
    "( 1999 ) are utilized .",
    "our model supposes a continuous absorbing gas slab of a thickness @xmath11 ( presumably the outer region of a foreground galaxy ) . the absorber is assumed to exhibit a mixture of bulk motions such as infall and outflows , tidal flows etc .",
    "then the gas motion along a given line of sight may be described by a fluctuating ( random ) velocity field in which the velocities in neighboring volume elements are correlated with each other ( while in the standard microturbulent approximation completely uncorrelated velocities are assumed ) .",
    "the gas is tenuous and optically thin in the lyman continuum .",
    "we are considering a compressible gas , i.e. the total number density of hydrogen @xmath12 is also a random function of the space coordinate , @xmath13 . following donahue & shull ( 1991 ) and assuming that the ionizing radiation field is constant ,",
    "the ionization of different elements can be described by one parameter only  the ionization parameter @xmath14 .",
    "furthermore , for gas in thermal equilibrium , donahue & shull give an explicit relation between @xmath15 and the kinetic temperature @xmath16 .",
    "the background ionizing spectrum in our model is taken in the form given by mathews & ferland ( 1987 ) .    to estimate physical parameters and appropriate distributions of the velocity @xmath17 and the normalized density @xmath18 ,",
    "@xmath19 being the mean hydrogen density , we used the mci procedure developed on the basis of the reverse monte carlo technique ( levshakov et al .",
    "1999a ) . in our computations ,",
    "the continuous random functions @xmath17 and @xmath20 are represented by their sampled values at equally spaced intervals @xmath21 , i.e. by the vectors \\{@xmath22 } and \\{@xmath23 } with @xmath24 large enough to represent the narrowest components of the complex spectral lines . for the ionization parameter as a function of @xmath13 , we have @xmath25 , with @xmath26 being the reduced mean ionization parameter defined below .",
    "we fix @xmath27 ( the value adopted by mbcv ) as a more or less arbitrary reference velocity at which @xmath28 .",
    "our aim is to fit the model spectra simultaneously to the observed hydrogen , carbon and silicon profiles . in this case",
    "the model requires the definition of a simulation box for the six parameters ( see lak , for details )  : the carbon and silicon abundances , @xmath29 and @xmath30 , respectively , the rms velocity and density dispersions , @xmath31 and @xmath32 , respectively , the reduced total hydrogen column density @xmath33 $ ] , and the reduced mean ionization parameter @xmath34 $ ] . for the model parameters the following boundaries were adopted  : @xmath29 ranges from @xmath35 to @xmath36 , @xmath30 from @xmath35 to @xmath37 , @xmath31 from 25 to 80 km  s@xmath38 , @xmath32 from 0.5 to 2.2 , @xmath39 from @xmath40 to @xmath41 @xmath2 , and @xmath26 ranges from @xmath42 to @xmath43 .",
    "having specified the parameter space , we minimize the @xmath44 value .",
    "the objective function includes the following portions of the absorption profiles ( labeled by grey lines in fig .",
    "1 ) which , after preliminary analysis , were chosen as most appropriate to the mci fitting  : for hi ly@xmath5 @xmath45 ranges from @xmath46 to @xmath47 km  s@xmath38 ( the blue wing ) and from 84 to 119 km  s@xmath38 ( the red wing , see fig .",
    "1a ) , for cii from @xmath48 to 33 km  s@xmath38 ( fig .",
    "1h ) , for civ@xmath49 from @xmath50 to 79 km  s@xmath38 ( fig .  1 g ) , for siiii from @xmath51 to 60 km  s@xmath38 ( fig .",
    "1e ) , and for siiv@xmath52 @xmath45 ranges from @xmath53 to 70 km  s@xmath38 ( fig .",
    "the necessity to choose these portions instead of the all available profiles was caused by a few discrepancies in the data .",
    "thus two small spikes in civ@xmath54 at @xmath55 and 23 km  s@xmath38 are not seen in its stronger blue counterpart civ@xmath49 , two minima in siiv@xmath52 at @xmath56 and 17 km  s@xmath38 are invisible in the profile of the red component siiv@xmath57 .",
    "but in fig .  1 ( panels * f * and * c * ) the observed civ@xmath54 and , respectively , siiv@xmath57 are shown together with the model spectra computed with the parameters derived from ly@xmath5 , cii@xmath58 , civ@xmath49 , siiii@xmath59 , and siiv@xmath52 fitting to illustrate the consistency .",
    "for the same reason the ly@xmath60 model spectrum is shown in fig .",
    "1b at the expected position .",
    "the additional absorption on the blueward and the redward sides of ly@xmath60 in the observed spectrum may be caused by ly@xmath5 and/or ly@xmath60 forest lines at different redshifts . in fig .  1 , all model spectra are drawn by continuous thin lines , whereas filled circles represent observations ( normalized fluxes ) .",
    "the mci is a stochastic optimization procedure and one does not know in advance if the global minimum of the objective function is reached in a single run .",
    "therefore we executed several runs for the given data set starting every calculation from a random point in the simulation box and from completely random configurations of the velocity and density fields .",
    "the results for five runs are listed in table  1 .",
    "the first solution ( upper row in table  1 ) was used to calculate the model spectra shown in fig .  1 , and the corresponding distributions of @xmath17 , @xmath20 , and @xmath61 which are presented in fig",
    "rccccccc @xmath62 & @xmath63 & @xmath64 & @xmath31 & @xmath32 & [ c / h]@xmath65 & [ si / h]@xmath65 & @xmath66 + 4.4 & 4.6 & 1.25 & 51 & 1.1 & @xmath67 & @xmath68 & 1.17 + 5.0 & 5.3 & 1.10 & 50 & 0.8 & @xmath69 & @xmath70 & 1.15 + 5.9 & 5.2 & 1.60 & 48 & 1.1 & @xmath69 & @xmath70 & 1.16 + 8.7 & 7.2 & 2.54 & 70 & 1.6 & @xmath71 & @xmath72 & 1.16 + 11.3 & 8.1 & 1.83 & 52 & 0.9 & @xmath73 & @xmath74 & 1.03 +   +    the median estimations of the parameters give @xmath75 @xmath2 , @xmath76 @xmath2 , @xmath77 , @xmath78 km  s@xmath38 , @xmath79 , [ c / h ] =  1.8 , and [ si / h ] =  0.7 .",
    "the results were obtained with @xmath80 and the correlation coefficients @xmath81 .",
    "the mci allowed us to fit precisely not only the blue wing of the saturated ly@xmath5 line but the red one as well .",
    "in addition we have reached a reasonable concordance between hydrogen and metal absorption lines .",
    "although our model spectra of metal lines are consistent with the observed profiles within the 3-@xmath82 uncertainty range , we found difficulties with the cii line fitting .",
    "the cii model spectrum lies systematically over the observed intensities ( fig .",
    "we note that the measurement of the cii line depends sensitively on the exact definition of the continuum because the line is very weak ( it was not included by ellison et al . into the @xmath3 system ) .",
    "nevertheless , let us assume for a moment that mbcv s identification of cii is correct , and let us further compare in some more detail the micro- and mesoturbulent results . using the doppler parameters @xmath83 km  s@xmath38 and @xmath84 km  s@xmath38 measured by mbcv , it is easy to estimate the turbulent velocity @xmath85 km  s@xmath38 and the kinetic temperature @xmath86  k. on the other side , the mci kinetic temperature distribution ( fig .",
    "2 ) does not reveal values lower than @xmath87  k. besides , @xmath86  k seems to be too low for the photoionization heating . the mean kinetic temperature from the mesoturbulent solution @xmath88  k is , probably , more realistic .",
    "the four times higher mesoturbulent value of the rms velocity dispersion is also supported by observations .",
    "indeed , large broadening may be caused by the lensing effects since this qso exhibits two components of similar intensity separated by @xmath89 ( irvin et al .",
    "the low @xmath90 and @xmath91 seem to be an indication that the identification of cii at @xmath3 is not very certain .",
    "we have shown that the determination of the d abundance in the @xmath3 system is strongly model dependent . the ly@xmath5 profile can as well be modeled with a considerably lower value of @xmath92 as compared to the mbcv model if one accounts for spacial correlations in the large scale velocity and density fields .",
    "this implies that the identification of the di line in this system can not be confirmed or ruled out without additional observations of the higher order lyman series lines in order to constrain the total neutral hydrogen column density and the velocity field configuration .    for this particular case , the presence of the extra - absorption exactly at the expected deuterium position @xmath93 km  s@xmath38 becomes evident from the upper panel of fig .  3 where dotted and solid line histograms show , respectively , the density weighted radial velocity distributions @xmath94 for the total and neutral hydrogen , whereas the dashed curve illustrates @xmath94 as adopted by mbcv ( a gaussian with @xmath95 km  s@xmath38 ) .",
    "the radial velocity distribution of hi shows a blue - side asymmetry which may just mimic the deuterium absorption .",
    "the main maximum of @xmath96 is shifted to @xmath97 km  s@xmath38 with respect to mbcv frame of reference .",
    "the distribution @xmath96 exhibits also an extended red wing ranging up to @xmath98 km  s@xmath38 .",
    "this asymmetry is also clearly pronounced in the siiii profile ( fig .",
    "the restored density and velocity fields reveal a very complex structure which is manifested in non - gaussian distributions as shown in fig .  3 for the total hydrogen density as well as for the individual ions .",
    "it appears that civ is a good tracer for the distribution of the total hydrogen density .",
    "since the voigt profile fitting analysis may produce very misleading results when applied to the case where the deviation from gaussianity in the velocity distribution becomes significant , the extremely low metallicity with @xmath99 } \\simeq -4.0 $ ] and @xmath100 } \\simeq -3.5 $ ] reported by mbcv may be caused by their simplified model .",
    "for example , our analysis yields considerably higher values of @xmath99 } \\simeq -1.8 $ ] and @xmath100 } \\simeq -0.7 $ ] .",
    "a metallicity as high as [ c / h ] @xmath101 and a silicon overabundance [ si / c ] @xmath102 dex has been measured in the metal systems at @xmath103 towards q  00002619 ( savaglio et al .",
    "a similar silicon overabundance has also been observed in halo ( population  ii ) stars .",
    "the standard interpretation of these observations is that the metal - poor gas was enriched by type  ii supernova nucleosynthesis products ( e.g. henry & worthey 1999 ) .",
    "thus , our measurements are in agreement with these results .",
    "hence , it may be concluded that up to now deuterium lines have been identified convincingly in only four qso spectra .",
    "our previous d / h measurements in q  19371009 , q  1009 + 2956 , and q  1718 + 4807 and the last one by kirkman et al .",
