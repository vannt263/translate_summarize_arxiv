    "the classical notion of kolmogorov complexity @xcite is an objective measure for the information in an a _ single _ object , and information distance measures the information between a _",
    "pair _ of objects @xcite .",
    "information distance leads to the _ normalized compression distance _ ( ncd",
    ") @xcite by normalizing it to obtain the so - called similarity metric , and subsequently approximating the kolmogorov complexity through real - world compressors .",
    "this ncd is a parameter - free , feature - free , and alignment - free similarity measure that has found many applications in pattern recognition , phylogeny , clustering , and classification , see the many references in google scholar to @xcite .",
    "there arises the question of the shared information between many objects instead of just a pair of objects . to satisfy such aims",
    "the information distance measure has been extended from pairs to nonempty finite multisets @xcite .",
    "more properties of this distance were investigated in @xcite . for certain applications",
    "we require a normalized version .",
    "for instance , classifying an object into one or another of several classes we aim for the class of which the ncd for multisets grows the least .",
    "the new ncd was applied to classification questions that were earlier treated with the pairwise ncd .",
    "the results obtained were significantly better @xcite .",
    "up till now the objects considered can be viewed as finite computer files that carry all their properties within . however , there are also objects that carry all their properties without like ` red ' or ` three ' or are not a computer files like ` einstein ' or ` chair . '",
    "such objects are represented by name .",
    "some objects can be viewed as either text or name , such as the text of `` macbeth by shakespeare '' or the name `` macbeth by shakespeare . ''    in the name case we define a similarity distance based on the background information provided by google or any search engine that produces aggregate page counts .",
    "such search engines discover the `` meaning '' of words and phrases relative to other words and phrases in the sense of producing a relative semantics @xcite . there",
    ", the distance between the search terms @xmath0 and @xmath1 is given as the _ normalized google distance _ ( ngd ) by @xmath2 where @xmath3 denotes the number of pages containing occurrences of @xmath0 , @xmath4 denotes the number of pages containing occurrences of both @xmath0 and @xmath1 , and @xmath5 denotes the total number of web pages indexed by google ( or a multiple thereof , see below ) .",
    "we use the binary logarithm denoted by `` @xmath6 '' throughout . the ngd is widely applied , for example @xcite and the many references to @xcite in google scholar .",
    "on 9 april 2013 googling for `` shakespeare '' gave 130,000,000 hits ; googling for `` macbeth '' gave 26,000,000 hits ; and googling for `` shakespeare '' and `` macbeth '' together gave 20,800,000 hits .",
    "the number of pages indexed by google was estimated by the number of hits of the search term `` the '' which was 25,270,000,000 hits .",
    "assuming there are about 1,000 search terms on the average page this gives @xmath7 .",
    "hence @xmath8 .",
    "according to the formula @xmath9 means @xmath0 is the same as @xmath1 ( rather the implication @xmath10 ) and @xmath11 means @xmath0 is as unlike @xmath1 as is possible .",
    "hence shakespeare and macbeth are very much alike according to the relative semantics supplied by google .      in @xcite",
    "the notion is introduced of the information required to go from any object in a finite multiset of objects to any other object in the multiset .",
    "let @xmath12 denote a finite multiset of @xmath13 finite binary strings defined by ( abusing the set notation ) @xmath14 , the constituting elements ( not necessarily all different ) ordered length - increasing lexicographic .",
    "we use multisets and not sets , since in a set all elements are different while here we are interested in the situation were some or all of the elements are equal .",
    "let @xmath15 be the reference universal turing machine , for convenience the prefix one @xcite .",
    "we define the _ information distance _ in @xmath14 by @xmath16 for all @xmath17 .",
    "it is shown in @xcite , theorem 2 , that @xmath18 up to a logarithmic additive term .    the information distance in @xcite between strings @xmath19 and @xmath20",
    "is denoted @xmath21 . in @xcite",
    "we introduced the notation @xmath22 so that @xmath23 .",
    "the two notations coincide for @xmath24 since @xmath25 up to an additive constant term .",
    "the quantity @xmath26 is called the information distance in @xmath12 .",
    "it comes in two flavors : the pairwise version for @xmath24 and the multiset version for @xmath27 .",
    "the normalized pairwise version was made computable using real - world compressors to approximate the incomputable kolmogorov complexity . called the normalized compression distance ( ncd )",
    "it has turned out to be suitable for determining similarity between pairs of objects , for phylogeny , hierarchical clustering , heterogeneous data clustering , anomaly detection , and so on @xcite .",
    "applications abound . in @xcite",
    "the name case for pairs was resolved by using the world wide web as database and google as query mechanism ( or any other search engine that give an aggregate page count ) . viewing the search engine as a compressor and using the ncd formula",
    "this gives many new applications .",
    "the theory of information distance for multisets insofar it was not treated in @xcite was given in @xcite .",
    "in @xcite the @xmath28 distance of nonempty finite multisets was normalized and approximated by real - world compressors .",
    "the result is the _",
    "normalized compression distance _ ( ncd ) for multisets .",
    "the @xmath29 where @xmath12 is a multiset is shown to be a metric with values in between 0 and 1 .",
    "the developed theory was applied to classification questions concerning the fate of retinal progenitor cells , synthetic versions , organelle transport , and handwritten character recognition ( a problem in ocr ) . in all cases",
    "the results were significantly better than using the pairwise ncd except for the ocr problem where a combination of the two approaches gave 99.6% correct on mnist data .",
    "the current state of the art classifier for mnist data achieves 99.77% accuracy .",
    "we translate the ncd approach for multisets in @xcite to the relative semantics case investigated for the relative semantics of pairs of words ( or phrases ) in @xcite .",
    "this gives the relative semantics of a multiset of names ( or phrases ) .",
    "the basic concepts like the google distribution and the google code are given in section  [ sect.google ] . in section  [ sect.theory ]",
    "we give the relevant properties like non - metricity .",
    "we show that the closer the google probability of a multiset approximates the universal probability of that multiset the closer the ngd approximates a normalized form of the information distance , with equality of the latter for equality of the former .",
    "( a normalized form of information distance quantizes the common similarity of the objects in the multiset according to all effective properties . )",
    "we subsequently apply the ngd for multisets to various data sets , colors versus animals , saltwater fish versus freshwater fish , taxonomy of reptiles , mammals , birds , fish , and us primary candidates in section  [ sect.appl ] . here",
    "we compare the outcomes with those of the pairwise ngd in @xcite using different search engines google , bing , and the google n - gram data base .",
    "we show that the multiset ngd is as good or superior on these examples , except sometimes for bing ( the google n - gram method did not currently work for the multiset ngd since google supplies n - grams for n is at most 5 and the multisets inspected have too large cardinality ) .",
    "we write _ string _ to mean a finite binary string , and @xmath30 denotes the empty string .",
    "( if the string is over a larger finite alphabet we recode it into binary . )",
    "the _ length _ of a string @xmath0 ( the number of bits in it ) is denoted by @xmath31 .",
    "thus , @xmath32 .",
    "a _ multiset _ is a generalization of the notion of set .",
    "the members are allowed to appear more than once .",
    "for example , if @xmath33 then @xmath34 is a set , but @xmath35 and @xmath36 are multisets , with abuse of the set notation .",
    "we also abuse the set - membership notation by using it for multisets by writing @xmath37 and @xmath38 for @xmath39 .",
    "further , @xmath40 . if @xmath41 are multisets then we use the notation @xmath42 ; if @xmath43 is a nonempty multisets and @xmath44 , then we write @xmath45 . for us , a multiset is finite and nonempty such as @xmath46 with @xmath47 and the members are finite binary strings in length - increasing lexicographic order . if @xmath12 is a multiset , then some or all of its elements may be equal .",
    "@xmath48 means that `` @xmath49 is an element of multiset @xmath12 . ''",
    "with @xmath50 we mean the multiset @xmath51 with one occurrence of @xmath0 removed .",
    "the finite binary strings , finiteness , and length - increasing lexicographic order allows us to assign a unique kolmogorov complexity to a multiset .",
    "the conditional prefix kolmogorov complexity @xmath52 of a multiset @xmath12 given an element @xmath0 is the length of a shortest program @xmath53 for the reference universal turing machine that with input @xmath0 outputs the multiset @xmath12 .",
    "the prefix kolmogorov complexity @xmath54 of a multiset @xmath12 is defined by @xmath55 .",
    "one can also put multisets in the conditional such as @xmath56 or @xmath57 .",
    "we will use the straightforward laws @xmath58 and @xmath59 up to an additive constant term , for @xmath60 and @xmath61 equals the multiset @xmath12 with one occurrence of the element @xmath0 deleted .",

    "one challenge is to find a database that has sufficient breadth as to contain a meaningful numbers of co - occurrences for related terms .",
    "as discussed previously , an example of one such database is the world wide web , with the page counts returned by google search queries used as an estimate of co - occurrence frequency .",
    "there are two issues with using google search page counts .",

    "( we write @xmath226 for @xmath227 . ) in a leave - one - out cross validation , results from these queries can be precomputed for each out of @xmath222 classes and for each individual search element out of @xmath13 of those , reducing the number of queries to @xmath228 .",
    "the multiset formulation has an advantage over the pairwise of requiring less queries .",
    "for example , for @xmath229 and @xmath230 the pairwise case requires more search queries than the multiset case .",
    "the second issue with using google web search page counts is that the numbers are not exact , but are generated using an approximate algorithm that google has not disclosed .",
    "for the questions considered in the current work and previously @xcite we have found that these approximate measures are sufficient to generate useful answers , especially in the absence of any a priori domain knowledge .",

    "interestingly , the google web user interface returns different results compared to the google api , with the google api performing better in some cases and equivalent in others .    one alternative to using search queries on the world wide web is to use a large database such as the google books n - gram corpus @xcite .",

    "although the ngd works with multisets of cardinality two or larger , the classification approach used here requires that each class have cardinality of three or larger so that during cross validation there is never a scenario where we need to compute the ngd for a set of cardinality one .",

    "we compute the standard deviation of the gap value @xmath242 from @xmath243 , the standard deviation of the @xmath231 uniformly distributed randomly generated data , adjusted to account for simulation error , as @xmath244 finally , we choose the smallest value of @xmath234 for which @xmath245    we now describe results from a number of sample applications . for all of these applications , we use a single implementation based on co - occurrence counts .",
    "we compare the results of the ngd multiset , the ngd pairwise used with gap spectral clustering , and for the first question , the google n - grams data set used pairwise with gap spectral clustering .",
    "the n - grams data set , despite being an extremely large database , did not have the scope to be used with the multiset formulation , or with the more detailed sample applications .",
    "we include results using the google api and the google and bing web user interfaces .",
    "the results are summarized in figure [ tab.allresults ] .        in the first question we consider classifying colors vs. animals :",
    "\\{red , orange , yellow , green , blue , indigo } vs. \\{lion , tiger , bear , monkey , zebra , elephant}. for this question , with the pairwise ngd , gap spectral clustering found two groups in the data and classified all of the elements correctly except that indigo was classified with the animal class .",
    "the ngd multiset formulation classified the terms perfectly . using the pairwise ngd with the n - gram corpus gap spectral clustering found two groups in the data and also classified the terms perfectly .",
    "figure [ tab.results ] shows the distance matrices computed for the three approaches .",
    "we obtained identical results using the google api as with the bing and google web user interfaces , although for the gap spectral clustering , the bing and google web user interface results did not find the correct number of groups in the data .",
    "the next question considered compared saltwater vs. freshwater fish : \\{labidochromis caeruleus , sciaenochromis fryeri , betta splendens , carassius auratus , melanochromis cyaneorhabdos } vs. \\{ecsenius bicolor , pictichromis paccagnellae , amphiprion ocellaris , paracanthurus hepatus , chromis viridis}. for this question , using the pairwise ngd , gap spectral clustering found two groups in the data and classified all of the elements correctly .",
    "the ngd multisets formulation also classified the terms perfectly .",
    "the pairwise ngd with the n - gram corpus did not have enough data to classify any of the elements for this question or any of the remaining questions .",
    "the bing web user interface performed poorly in the ngd multisets formulation , classifying only 3 of 12 elements correctly .    in a related question",
    ", we next consider a 4 class problem based on subclasses of reptiles , mammals , birds and fish .",
    "we consider 12 taxonomic subclasses : \\{ichthyosauria , lepidosauromorpha , archosauromorpha } ( reptiles ) , \\{allotheria , triconodonta , holotheria } ( mammals ) , \\{agnatha , chondrichthyes , placodermi } ( fish ) and \\{archaeornithes , enantiornithes , hesperornithes } ( birds ) .",
    "the ngd for multisets classified all 12 subclasses correctly . again using the bing web user interface with the multisets distance the classification accuracy was significantly worse than with google search . using the ngd pairwise ,",
    "the gap statistic found only one group in the data .",
    "this was a local maxima , there was a strong global maximum at 4 groups in the data as shown in figure [ fig.gap ] .",
    "clustering into the four groups with spectral clustering classified all elements correctly .    finally , we considered the 12 candidates from the republican and democratic primaries in the 2008 us presidential election , \\{barack obama , hillary clinton,john edwards , joe biden , chris dodd,mike gravel } ( democratic ) and john mccain , mitt romney , mike huckabee,ron paul , fred thompson , alan keyes } ( republican ) .",
    "the candidates were ordered by the length of time they remained in the race .",
    "the ngd multisets classified 11 of the 12 correctly , misclassifying ron paul with the democrats , possibly a result of his strongly libertarian political views .",
    "gap spectral clustering with the pairwise ngd found only one group in the data .",
    "spectral clustering the candidates into two groups was not effective at classification , grouping the candidates more by popularity than by party , \\{barack obama , hillary clinton , joe biden , john mccain , mitt romney , ron paul } and \\{john edwards , chris dodd , mike gravel , mike huckabee , fred thompson,alan keyes}. the google api was more accurate than the google web interface for this question , and again the bing search engine performed poorly relative to google in the multisets formulation .",
    "we propose a method , the normalized google distance ( ngd ) for multisets , say @xmath12 , that quantifies in a single number between 0 and @xmath123 the way in which a finite nonempty multiset of objects is similar .",
    "this similarity is based on the names of the objects and uses the information supplied by the frequency counts of pages on which the names occur . for instance , the pages are pages of the world wide web and the frequency counts are supplied by a search engine such as google .",
    "the method can be applied using any big data base ( wikipedea , oxford english dictionary ) and a search engine that returns aggregate page counts .",
    "since this method uses names for object , and not the objects themselves , we can view those names as words and the similarity between words in a multiset of words as a shared relative semantics between those words .",
    "( what is stated about `` words '' also holds for `` phrases . '' ) the similarity between a finite nonempty multiset of words is called a distance or diameter of this multiset . using the theory developed we show properties of this distance and especially that it is not a metric ( theorem  [ theo.triangle ] ) , in certain cases the distance may be 0 for distinct names , in non - pathological cases it ranges in between 0 and @xmath123 ( for a multiset @xmath12 ) , and does not satisfy the triangle property .",
    "however , in the ( world wide web , google ) practice we did not find examples of violating the triangle property .",
    "we showed that the closer the probability distribution of names supplied by the ( data base , search engine ) pair is to the universal distribution , the closer the computed similarity is to the ultimate effective similarity ( the `` real '' similarity ) with equality in the limit ( theorem  [ theo.ideal ] ) .",
    "for instance , the world wide web is so large and google so good that the two are close .",
    "earlier @xcite this approach was used for pairs of names , the pairwise ngd , an subsequently widely used , see the discussion in section  [ sect.intro ] . to test the effacity of the new method we compared its results ( section  [ sect.appl ] ) with those of the pairwise method ( together with some embellishments ) on small data sets , to wit colors versus animals , saltwater versus freshwater fish , taxonomy of reptiles mammals birds fish , and us primary candidates : democratic versus republican .",
    "we used the world wide web and google api , google wui , bing , and google n - grams .",
    "the results showed in these instances superiority or equality for the multiset ngd over the pairwise ncd for google .",
    "bing performed poorly and the n - gram method was only usable for the pairwise ngd in view of the fact that @xmath246 only and the cardinality of the test multisets were too large .",
