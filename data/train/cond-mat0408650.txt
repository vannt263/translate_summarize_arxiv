    "@xcite on a @xmath1li-@xmath0li mixtures inside an elongated 3d trap appear to be not far from the onset of a demixed state : an increase in the boson - fermion scattering length by a factor five would be needed to enter the phase - separated regime @xcite .    in this letter",
    "we examine the possibility of attaining phase separation by merely varying the trap geometry for the @xmath1li-@xmath0li mixture at the `` natural '' values of the scattering lengths .",
    "we focus on the case of quasi - two - dimensional ( q2d ) confinement inside a pancake - shaped trap .",
    "we find that this geometry favours the demixed state through the appearance of the axial size of the atomic clouds in their effective coupling in the azimuthal plane .",
    "we also show that several configurations are possible in the plane of the trap at zero temperature , but the configuration consisting of a core of bosons surrounded by a ring of fermions is the most energetically favourable for a wide range of values of system parameters .",
    "the atomic clouds are trapped in pancake - shaped potentials given by @xmath3 where @xmath4 are the atomic masses and @xmath5 the trap frequencies .",
    "we focus on the case where the trap is flat enough that the dimensions of the clouds in the axial direction , which are of the order of the axial harmonic - oscillator lengths @xmath6 , are comparable to the 3d boson - boson and boson - fermion scattering lengths @xmath7 and @xmath8 . in this regime we can study the equilibrium properties of the mixture at essentially zero temperature ( @xmath9 ) in terms of the particle density profiles in the @xmath10 plane , which are @xmath11 for the bose - einstein condensate and @xmath12 for the fermions .",

    "we derive and illustrate in this section the consequences for demixing at very low temperatures .",
    "we preliminarly recall that in the macroscopic limit the phase transition is sharp and the overlap between the two species after demixing is restricted to the interfacial region , where it is governed by the surface kinetic energy ( see ref .",

    "the transition is instead spread out and several alternative definitions of the location of demixing can therefore be given .",

    "the interaction energy @xmath32 between the boson and fermion clouds initially grows as the boson - fermion coupling is increased , but reaches a maximum and then falls off as the overlap between the two clouds diminishes .",

    "an approximate analytic formula for the location of partial demixing as a function of the system parameters in the q2d model can be obtained from the condition @xmath47 by using the estimate @xmath48 with the values of the cloud radii in the absence of boson - fermion interactions , @xmath49 and @xmath50 where @xmath51 .",

    "( [ partially0 ] ) , ( [ dyn0 ] ) and ( [ condition ] ) that the two control parameters for the transition in a mesoscopic cloud under q2d confinement are @xmath44 and @xmath67 .",
    "our main conclusion is that in a q2d geometry a relatively small value of the boson - fermion scattering length suffices to reach the regime of full phase separation . in the case of the @xmath1li-@xmath0li mixture",
    "the bare values of the boson - boson and boson - fermion scattering lengths fulfill the condition for full phase separation for values of @xmath40 lower than 10 @xmath8 .    in view of the above result , it is useful to illustrate in fig .",

    "in fact we have found various metastable configurations for the demixed mesoscopic cloud in addition to the thermodynamically stable one consisting of a core of bosons surrounded by a ring of fermions .    in fig .",
    "3 we show topviews of the density profiles in the @xmath10 plane for the choice of parameters @xmath68 , @xmath69 and @xmath70 . the most energetically stable configuration is shown in fig . [ fig3](a ) and lies at energy @xmath71 .",

    "[ fig3](d ) shows an asymmetric configuration in which a core of bosons is displaced away from the centre of the trap ( @xmath74 ) .",
    "the latter two configurations break the symmetry of the trap and this is an effect due to the finite size of the system .",
    "configurations ( b)-(d ) are structurally but not energetically stable , _",
    "i.e. _ they represent metastable structures in local energy minima .",

    "[ fig3 ] as a function of the scattering lengths ( @xmath75 and @xmath76 ) and the planar - anisotropy parameters ( @xmath77 ) .",
    "in contrast to the case of an elongated 3d confinement studied in our previous work @xcite , where the lowest - energy configuration can have different topologies depending on the system parameters , we have found that the configuration shown in fig .",
    "[ fig3](a ) remains the most energetically stable for the q2d geometry .",
    "a configuration consisting of a central core of fermions surrounded by a cloud of bosons may , however , be the stable one for sufficiently strong boson - boson repulsions @xcite .",
    "in summary , we have focussed on a boson - fermion mixture confined inside pancake - shaped traps , such that the scattering events can still be considered three - dimensional but nevertheless affected by the vertical confinement . by using a mean - field description for the equilibrium densities in the azimuthal plane ,",
    "we have studied the boson - fermion interaction energy as a function of the thickness of the atomic clouds and of the boson - boson and boson - fermion scattering lengths .",
    "we have given approximate analytical expressions identifying three critical regimes in terms of the scaling parameters @xmath44 and @xmath67 : ( i ) partial demixing where the boson - fermion interaction energy attains maximum value from a balance between increasing interactions and diminishing overlap ; ( ii ) dynamical demixing where the fermionic density drops to zero at the centre of the trap and a sharp dynamical signature of demixing may be expected ; and ( iii ) full demixing where the boson - fermion overlap is negligible as in the macroscopic limit . these different criteria for the location of the phase transition in a mesoscopic cloud yield quite close predictions in a pancake - shaped trap under strong axial confinement .",
    "we have found several metastable configurations for the demixed cloud , having various topologies but lying at higher energy above the stable configuration which is composed by a core of condensed bosons surrounded by fermions .",
    "we have verified that this is the minimum - energy configuration over extensive ranges of values for the coupling constants , the anisotropy in the plane of the trap , and the thickness of the trap .",
    "a main result of our work is that full demixing can be reached in the @xmath1li-@xmath0li mixture by merely tuning the thickness of the trap , without necessarily tuning the scattering lengths .",
    "the full - demixing critical value of about @xmath78 for the thickness is not attainable in the actual experiments with the bare value of the @xmath1li-@xmath0li scattering length , and a combination of squeezing of the pancake - shaped trap and exploiting feshbach resonances should be used . on the contrary ,",
    "the dynamical location of demixing may be observed by only varying the number of particles , without enhancing the scattering length .",
    "in fact for a mixture of @xmath79 atoms of @xmath0li and @xmath80 atoms of @xmath1li trapped in the radial confinement discussed in sec . [ partial_sep ] , it may be possible to observe a sharp upturn of the low - lying fermionic modes for a pancake thickness of the order of @xmath81 m ."
