    "the standard lens models , although reproduce in general the relative positions of the images quite accurately , often have difficulties explaining the relative fluxes of multiply - imaged sources .",
    "several possible explanations have been considered in the literature , the most plausible being that the lensing potential of real galaxies are not fully described by the simple lens models used to compute the lens characteristics .",
    "the most often invoked solution is to consider additional small - scale structures , which if located near the images can modify significantly the observed flux ratio between different images , in particular the so - called cusp or fold relations .",
    "the presence of substructures is naturally expected within the cold dark matter ( cdm ) model , which has been successful in explaining a large variety of observational results like the large scale structure of galaxies on scales larger than 1 mpc or the fluctuations of the cmb ( spergel et al 2003 ) . however , one of the predictions of this scenario is a distribution of matter , with a large number of small - mass compact dark matter ( dm subhalos ) halos , both within virialized regions of larger halos ( moore et al . 1999 , klypin et al .",
    "1999 ) and in the field ( dm extragalactic halos , metcalf 2005 ) . at the same time",
    ", the observed number of dwarf galaxy satellites in the local group is more than an order of magnitude smaller than expected .",
    "many theoretical studies suggest models to reduce the abundance of substructure or to suppress star formation in small clumps via astrophysical mechanisms ( as feedback ) , making them dark ( bullock , kravtosov & weinberg 2000 , kravtsov et al .",
    "2004 , moore et al .",
    "2006 ) . anyway ,",
    "if the cdm paradigm is correct , we expect @xmath3 of the mass of a present - day galactic halo ( @xmath4 ) within the virial radius to be in substructures with mass @xmath5 . thus in the cdm model anomalous flux ratios should be common .    at present , the only way to detect these subclumps is through gravitational lensing , which is directly sensitive to the mass .",
    "this is because substructures ( like globular clusters , gas clouds or satellite galaxies ) can strongly modify the fluxes of lensed images relative to those predicted by smooth lens models .",
    "even a clump as small as a star can perturb the image of small sources ( @xmath6 au ) , but in this case we would see a microlensing effect such as variability in the image brightness with a time scale of order months .",
    "some authors tried to fit systems ( for example the radio system b1422 + 231 ) with anomalous flux ratios using smooth lens and multipole models : although it seems necessary to investigate further whether the multipoles can fit the lens configurations , these methods are not exhaustive ( evans & witt 2003 , kochanek & dalal 2004 , congdon & keeton 2005 ) and it is not yet possible to conclude that the multipole approach can explain the anomalous flux ratios .",
    "indeed , kochanek & dalal 2004 showed that the flux anomaly distributions display the characteristic demagnifications of the brightest saddle point relative to the other images expected for low optical depth substructure , which they conclude can not be mimicked by problems in the `` macro '' models for the gravitational potential of the lens galaxy .",
    "mao & schneider ( 1998 ) , keeton ( 2001 ) , metcalf & madau ( 2001 ) , brada et al .",
    "( 2002 ) , dobler & keeton ( 2006 ) noted that a simple way of solving the puzzle was to put a satellite near the images , and they found that this could explain the anomaly in b1422 + 231 .",
    "generally the flux ratios between the images do not depend on wavelength since they are independent of the intrinsic flux and variability of the source ( keeton et al .",
    "1997 , mao & schneider 1998 , keeton 2001 , metcalf & zhao 2002 ) .",
    "such discrepancies would probably be due to sub - lensing or microlensing effects .",
    "on the other hand when modeling a multiple qso lens system , one can either include or disregard the flux ratios of the images . as pointed out by chang & refsdal ( 1979 ) ( and in the following by several authors , as for instance metcalf 2005 , keeton et al .",
    "2005 , mortonson et al .",
    "2005 ) we have to pay attention to the fact that the projected ( on the lens plane ) sizes of the optical continuum emitting regions of qsos are expected to be of the same order as the einstein radius of a star in the lens galaxy ( @xmath7 100au ) , so that the optical magnitudes may well be affected by gravitational microlensing ( see metcalf et al .",
    "2004 , mortonson et al .",
    "2005 , and references therein ) , even if averaged over long periods of time .",
    "the radio and mid - ir regions , when projected on the lens plane , are typically of the order of 10 pc and change in their magnification should be dominated by larger scales than stars ( metcalf 2005 , chiba et al . 2005 ) . if the lens galaxies contain substructures with an einstein radius comparable or greater than the projected size of the radio component ( corresponding for the substructure to masses @xmath8 ) we should see image splitting and distortions if they lie close enough to the images ( see section 3.2 , wambsganss & paczyski 1994 , mao & schneider 1998 ) , which have not yet been detected ( this might be the case for b0128 + 437 , biggs et al .",
    "2004 ) .",
    "the existence of anomalous fluxes in many lens systems has been known since some time .",
    "the substructure lensing effects have been studied by considering single substructures ( mao & schneider 1998 , metcalf & madau 2001 ) , by assuming a statistically distributed sample of substructures ( chiba 2002 , chen et al .",
    "2003 , keeton et al . 2005 ) or by simulations ( amara et al .",
    "2006 , macci et al . 2005 ) .",
    "an explanation by lensing of substructures for the anomalous flux ratio for the pg1115 + 080 system has already been considered ( chiba 2002 , dalal & kochanek 2002 , chen et al .",
    "2003 , kochanek & dalal 2004 , keeton , gaudi , petters 2005 ) , however , mainly within a statistical treatment to determine whether a plausible collection of mass clumps could explain the strange flux ratio . as pointed out by chiba ( 2002 ) ,",
    "even if it seems difficult to reproduce anomalous flux ratios with cdm subhalos , he concluded that the main role in reproducing the observed flux ratio is played by the one satellite which is located in the vicinity of an image ( either a1 or a2 in pg1115 + 80 ) .    in this paper",
    "we analyze in detail the lens system by adding one or two subclumps nearby one of the images and by solving the lens equation . in section 2",
    "we review the main observation and analysis done so far on the two lens systems pg1115 + 080 and b1555 + 375 . in section 3",
    "we briefly recall the relevant formalism for gravitational lensing and how we proceed when we consider a lens model with a perturbation induced by one or more substructures . assuming a sis model for the substructures we",
    "can then get an estimate on their position and einstein radius ( or mass ) such as to modify the flux of the image pair near the critical curve due to a source located close to a fold . in section 4",
    "we present the numerical simulations and fits to the two considered lens systems .",
    "we conclude with a short summary and discussion of our results in section 5 .    [ 1 ]",
    "pg1115 + 080 is the second gravitationally lensed quasar which was discovered ( weymann et al .",
    "1980 , impey et al . 1998 and",
    "references therein ) .",
    "the source is at redshift @xmath9 and the lens galaxy at @xmath10 .",
    "it is an optically selected , radio - quiet quasar .",
    "hege et al . (",
    "1981 ) first resolved the four quasar images ( a close pair a2/a1 , b and c ) , confirming the early model of young et al . ( 1981 ) that the lens is a five - images system , one image being hidden by the core of the lens galaxy .",
    "young et al .",
    "( 1981 ) noted that the lens galaxy seems to be part of a small group centered to the southwest of the lens , with a velocity dispersion of approximately @xmath11 km s@xmath12 based only on four galaxy redshifts ( tonry 1998 also confirmed the group velocity dispersion by using five galaxies and getting a value of 326 @xmath13 ) .",
    "the group is an essential component of any model to successfully fit the lens constraints ( keeton et al .",
    "1997 ; schechter et al .",
    "also two time delays between the images were determined by schechter et al .",
    "( 1997 ) and confirmed by barkana ( 1997 ) .",
    "their results were analyzed by keeton & kochanek ( 1997 ) and courbin et al .",
    "( 1997 ) by assuming power law mass distributions and leading to a value of @xmath14 km s@xmath12 mpc@xmath12 , with comparable contributions to the uncertainties both from the time delay measurements and the models .",
    "recently , read et al .",
    "2007 , assuming a non parametric mass distribution , found @xmath15 km s@xmath12 mpc@xmath12 consistent with the currently accepted value of about 70 km s@xmath12 mpc@xmath12 .",
    "we take the data for the pg1115 + 080 system from impey et al .",
    "( 1998 ) ( their fig.1 and tables 1 and 2 ) who presented a near - infrared observation of the pg1115 + 080 system obtained with the hubble space telescope ( hst ) nicmos camera .",
    "the flux ratio of the close pair of images ( a1 and a2 , see fig .",
    "1 ) is approximately @xmath16 and showed little variation with wavelength from the multiple wavelength observations by impey et al .",
    "simple lens models require instead an a2/a1 flux ratio close to @xmath17 , because the images are symmetrically arranged near a fold caustic .",
    "there is no smooth lens model that can explain this anomalous flux : while each of such models can differ in complexity or in parameterization , the observed discrepancy in the flux ratio , compared with the expected universal relations for a cusp or fold singularity , suggests that it is an intrinsic difficulty for smooth lens models , not associated with a particular choice of the parameters ( yoo et al .",
    "2005 ) .",
    "recently , chiba et al .",
    "( 2005 ) analyzed observations of the pg1115 + 080 system done in the mid - infrared band and found a flux ratio a2/a1 of 0.93 for the close pair , which is virtually consistent with smooth lens models but clearly inconsistent with the optical fluxes .",
    "the observations indicated that the measured mid - infrared flux originate from a hot dust torus around a qso nucleus .",
    "based on the size estimate of the dust torus , they placed limits on the mass of the substructure causing the optical flux anomaly . for a substructure modeled as a sis the subclumps should have a mass of at most @xmath18 inside a radius of 100pc to prevent anomalies in the mid - infrared band .",
    "however , it has to be pointed out that this latter result is based on several assumptions and few observations ( minezaki et al .",
    "2004 ) , so that the given value may be subject to substantial modifications . indeed ,",
    "if the size of the cooler dust torus causing the mid - infrared flux is underestimated then the above limit gets increased .",
    "furthermore , pooley et al .",
    "2006 analyzed the system using recent x - ray observations , which show also a strong anomalous flux ratio .",
    "they do not exclude the microlensing hypothesis in order to explain the anomaly in the x - ray band , nonetheless they conclude that the optical emission region should be much larger ( by a factor @xmath19 ) than predicted by a simple thin accretion disk model .",
    "within this model the source size should be @xmath20 ( e.g. wambsganss , schneider , & paczyski 1990 ; rauch & blandford 1991 ; wyithe et al .",
    "2000 ) . therefore ,",
    "if it is 10 - 100 bigger , @xmath21 pc , the effect of stellar microlensing could be ruled out ( metcalf 2005 ) .",
    "an interesting quadruply imaged lens system is b1555 + 375 with a maximum separation of only 0.42 arcsec , which was discovered some years ago ( marlow et al .",
    "it has an anomalous flux ratio in the radio : the system was observed at 8,4 ghz at vla and with merlin 5 ghz snapshot observations .",
    "there are only few observations in the optical and near - infrared band .",
    "marlow et al .",
    "( 1999 ) considered a model for b1555 + 375 , which describes",
    "well the positions of the images but fails to reproduce accurately the flux ratio between the two images near the fold critical point ( labeled by a and b , see fig.3 ) . the observed ratio is about b / a @xmath7 0.57 .",
    "this anomaly has also been discussed by keeton et al .",
    "( 2005 ) and dobler & keeton ( 2006 ) .",
