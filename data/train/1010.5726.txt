    "one of the outstanding questions concerning the first epoch of star formation is the stellar mass distribution of population iii stars .",
    "most often , pop iii stars are assumed to be very massive ( 40 - 100 m@xmath0 ) or supermassive ( @xmath3 100 m@xmath0 ) .",
    "tracing chemical abundance patterns through cosmic chemical evolution allows one to test theories employing massive pop iii stars .",
    "for example , the abundance patterns seen in extremely iron - poor stars do not support the hypothesis that the first stars had masses between @xmath4 m@xmath0 and end as pair - instability supernovae @xcite . yet",
    "other observations , such as those relating to the reionization history of the universe , do point to an early population that is more massive than a standard pop i or ii distribution . here",
    ", we will explore the consequences of an early population of intermediate mass ( i m ) ( 2 - 8 m@xmath0 ) stars , which dominate at a redshift @xmath5 .    while there are many theoretical arguments pointing to very massive stars dominating pop iii @xcite , there exist arguments pointing to a first generation of stars with an initial mass function ( imf ) peaked around the intermediate mass range .",
    "for example , the metal - free imf predicted from opacity - limited fragmentation theory would peak around 4  10 m@xmath0 with steep declines at both larger and smaller masses @xcite .",
    "primordial cmb regulated - star formation also leads to the production of a population of early intermediate mass stars at low metallicity ( smith et al .",
    "2009 ) .    on the observational side",
    ", there is abundant evidence for an early contribution from i m stars .",
    "intermediate mass stars have particular effects on chemical abundance patterns . unlike their massive counterparts that end as core - collapse supernovae , these stars produce very little in the way of heavy elements ( oxygen and above ) , but produce significant amounts of carbon and/or nitrogen and above all helium . indeed , there is evidence that the number of carbon enhanced stars increases at low iron abundances @xcite necessitating a pop iii source of carbon , possibly in the asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) phase of i m stars @xcite . to account for the large [ c , n / fe ] ratios found in a large number of extremely iron - poor stars in our galaxy ,",
    "it was argued that an imf peaked at 4 - 10 m@xmath0 is needed @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the presence of s - process elements , particularly pb at very low metallicity also points to agb enrichment very early on @xcite . as a result ,",
    "an early population of intermediate mass stars may lead to a plausible explanation of recently observed carbon enriched iron - poor stars .",
    "isotopic abundances of c and mg also lend clues to the early nucleosynthetic history of the galaxy .",
    "isotopic studies of the latter show a considerable amount of dispersion at low metallicity ranging from low values of @xmath6mg/@xmath7 mg , consistent with pollution from core collapse supernovae , to high values of the mg ratios indicating the presence of agb production of the heavy mg isotopes .",
    "core collapse supernovae produce almost exclusively @xmath7 mg , while the observations of @xcite show enhancements ( relative to predictions based on standard chemical evolution models ) in both @xmath6 mg .",
    "agb stars were also concluded to be the source of the high @xmath6mg/@xmath7 mg ratios seen in the globular cluster ngc 6752 with [ fe / h ] = -1.62 @xcite .",
    "a similar conclusion was drawn in @xcite .",
    "determining the identity and nature of the first stars is a primary goal in any attempt to understand the physics of the first billion years of the universe .",
    "cosmic chemical evolutionary models enable one to test many of the hypotheses for pop iii stars @xcite .",
    "the bulk of the existing work in this area considers either massive stars ( m @xmath8 m@xmath0 ) or very massive stars ( m @xmath9 m@xmath0 ) .",
    "however , given the indications discussed above for an early population of intermediate mass stars , it seems crucial to examine the consequences for cosmic chemical evolution with i m pop iii stars .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section [ mot ] , we discuss some of the expected consequences for a population of intermediate mass stars .",
    "these include a ) the effective prompt initial enrichment of helium , which we compare to recent determinations of primordial helium @xcite that show an excess relative to the predictions of big bang nucleosynthesis ( bbn ) ; b ) the reionization of the universe , usually ascribed to very massive pop iii stars @xcite ; c ) the evolution of the imf ; d ) carbon - enhanced metal - poor stars ; e ) the density of white dwarfs ; f ) the rate of type ia supernovae at high redshift ; and g ) the evolution of n and mg .    in section [ model1 ] ,",
    "we introduce a relatively simple model of galactic chemical evolution to highlight some of the ( non - cosmological ) effects of the i m stars , particularly on the evolution of element abundances based on the work of @xcite .",
    "this model employs a bimodal star formation rate ( sfr ) which supplements a normal imf and sfr , with one enhanced with i m stars . in section [ model2 ]",
    ", we introduce a cosmic chemical evolutionary model based heavily on the hierarchical models developed in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "we present our results in section [ results ] .",
    "discussion and concluding remarks are given in section [ end ] .",
    "among the successes of the wmap determination of cosmological parameters is the accurate determination of the baryon density , @xmath10 or equivalently the baryon - to - photon ratio @xmath11 ; @xcite find [ eq : eta ] _ 10 = 6.19 0.15  . as a consequence ,",
    "it has become possible to treat standard big bang nucleosynthesis ( bbn ) as a zero - parameter theory @xcite , resulting in relatively precise predictions of the light element abundances of d , 3 , 4 , 7 @xcite .    when compared with current observational determinations of the abundances of d , 4 , and 7",
    ", we find varying degrees of concordance , none of which are perfect .",
    "deuterium is typically credited as being responsible for the concordance between bbn and the cosmic microwave background determination of @xmath12 . at the current value of @xmath12 ( eq .  [ eq : eta ] ) , the deuterium abundance is predicted to be d / h = @xmath13 .",
    "this can be compared with the abundance of deuterium measured in quasar absorption systems .",
    "the weighted mean value of seven systems with reliable abundance determinations is d / h = @xmath14 ( * ? ? ? * and references therein ) .",
    "however , the individual measurements of d / h shows considerable scatter ( a variance of 0.53 ) and it is likely that systematic errors dominate the uncertainties . while the agreement is certainly reasonable",
    ", we do draw attention to the fact that the predicted abundance is somewhat _ lower _ than the observed mean and this ( slight ) discrepancy will serve as a constraint below .",
    "the discrepancy between the predicted abundance of 7 and the value found in halo dwarf stars is well documented @xcite . at the wmap value of @xmath15 , 7/h = @xmath16 which is considerably higher than most observational determinations @xcite . for example , the recent analysis of @xcite finds 7/h = @xmath17 .",
    "we comment below on the possible effects of astration in chemical evolution models on the lithium abundance .    among the light elements , helium has the most accurately predicted primordial abundance .",
    "in addition , it is relatively insensitive to the baryon density and at @xmath18 , the helium mass fraction is y_p = 0.2487 0.0002 .",
    "[ ybbn ] the standard bbn results obtained in @xcite are similar to those given above ( y = @xmath19 , d / h = @xmath20 , 7/h = @xmath21 ) .    on the observational side ,",
    "the determination of the helium abundance in extragalactic hii regions is fraught with difficulties @xcite . over the last 15 years , improvements in the analysis",
    "has led to a systematically higher 4 abundance . @xcite and @xcite introduced a ` self - consistent ' method for determining the abundance of 4 simultaneously with the determination of the physical parameters associated with the hii region .",
    "they found @xmath22 and @xmath23 respectively .",
    "using the monte carlo methods described in @xcite and selected high quality data from @xcite , @xcite found a higher value with considerably larger uncertainties , @xmath24 .",
    "further improvements to the analysis were aided by new atomic data @xcite used in @xcite and @xcite where higher helium mass fractions were obtained @xmath25 and @xmath26 , respectively , based on the new he i emissivities and the collisional excitation of h i. the more recent work of @xcite found a still higher value @xmath27(stat . ) @xmath28(syst . ) . using the same relatively small set of high quality data from @xcite , @xcite found a similarly high value of @xmath29 .",
    "the latter was a combined and uniform treatment of both hydrogen and helium emission lines , the inclusion of the new he emissivities , wavelength - dependent effects of underlying absorption , and neutral hydrogen collisional corrections .",
    "a combination of strong degeneracies leading to large uncertainties in the individual helium abundance determinations found in an unrestricted monte carlo analysis as well as the relatively short baseline used in the regression with respect to o / h , the large uncertainty of 0.0108 makes certain that this determination is consistent with the bbn prediction at the wmap value of @xmath12 . given , the short baseline of this data set , it may be argued that a weighted mean of the helium results is warranted rather than the commonly used regression of y vs o / h as in the case of all results quoted above .",
    "the weighted mean found in @xcite is y_p = 0.2566 0.0028 , [ yaos ] and one could be tempted to claim a slight discrepancy between the predicted and derived 4 abundance .",
    "if the central value of @xmath30 is indeed 0.256 , rather than invoking non - standard bbn or a non - standard cosmological history , it may be possible to argue for a prompt initial enrichment of he by an early population of stars . while the helium data responsible for @xmath30 is at relatively low metallicity , the most metal - poor hii region used in the analysis leading to eq .",
    "( [ yaos ] ) is about 1/20 of solar metallicity .",
    "there is , therefore , a reasonable possibility that some helium was produced early in the star formation history of pre - galactic structures . here",
    ", we consider specific models of chemical evolution which may be responsible for such a prompt initial enrichment of 4 remaining at the same time consistent with a multitude of evolutionary constraints .",
    "when wmap first reported their result for a large optical depth due to electron scattering @xcite , which suggested a very early epoch of reionization of the intergalactic medium ( igm ) , it had an immediate impact on theories of cosmic chemical evolution .",
    "the reported optical depth of @xmath31 implied a redshift of reionization , @xmath32 . this put an immense amount of pressure on the models of the first stars , and certainly pointed towards very massive stars as a potential solution @xcite . in subsequent analyses by wmap @xcite , the optical depth was lowered and currently it is reported to be @xmath33 , corresponding to @xmath34 .",
    "this change is significant as it greatly relaxes the constraints imposed on the models .",
    "first , reionization at the relatively late redshift of 11 allows more time for structures and stars to form , and more importantly at the later time , more baryons are incorporated in structures ( in the hierarchical structure formation picture ) , and this decreases the ionizing flux per star needed for reionization .",
    "the early epoch of reionization is one of the driving forces behind the identification of pop iii stars with supermassive stars .",
    "however , it has been argued that the number of very massive pop iii stars needed for reionization would produce metal enrichments in conflict with observations @xcite . on the other hand",
    ", it has been shown that a ` normal ' population of stars ( i.e. , a model with a standard sfr and salpeter imf ) does not produce enough ionization photons so as to reionize the igm @xcite .",
    "because of the short timescales involved ( to achieve reionization by a redshift of 11 ) , only stars with masses @xmath35m@xmath0 can contribute to reionizing the igm by a redshift of 11 . while it has been shown that massive stars ( in the range 40 - 100 m@xmath0 ) are fully capable of reionizing the igm in a bimodal model of star formation @xcite , to the best of our knowledge the capabilities of i m stars have yet to explored in this context",
    ". we will show below that indeed i m stars are capable of reionizing the igm sufficiently rapidly .",
    "one can make a phenomenological case from galaxy evolution for an i m star - dominated imf at @xmath36 the arguments are individually refutable but the cumulative effect is certainly suggestive .    *",
    "comparison of the cosmic star formation rate with the rate of stellar mass assembly , inferred from integrating the luminosity function over various bands , reveals a discrepancy at @xmath37 that increases towards higher @xmath38 .",
    "the discrepancy is such that one _ apparently _ requires a reduced ratio of stellar mass to luminosity in star - forming galaxies .",
    "this is achievable if the imf has an excess of intermediate mass stars at these epochs .",
    "no universal power law fit is acceptable at @xmath39 according to @xcite .",
    "a similar discussion also leads to a preferred sfr at @xmath40 that is @xmath41 times higher than the best fit to the stellar mass density @xcite .",
    "there are other possible explanations , including uncertainties in stellar mass measurements and dust extinction , but no one of these is preferred . *",
    "comparison of the rate of luminosity evolution of massive early - type galaxies in clusters at @xmath42 to the rate of their color evolution requires that the imf is weighted towards more massive stars at earlier epochs .",
    "a specific interpretation is that the characteristic stellar mass ( @xmath43 today ) had a value of @xmath44 at @xmath45 , @xcite .",
    "* the evolution of the galaxy stellar mass  star formation rate relationship for star - forming galaxies constrains the stellar mass assembly histories of galaxies .",
    "simulations including gas accretion reproduce a tight correlation but the evolution with redshift disagrees with the data . the simulations generally prefer a constant specific star formation rate @xmath46 .",
    "the specific star formation rate is high at @xmath37 , remains high to @xmath47 , but is low today @xcite . to reconcile these results with the simulations",
    ", @xcite proposed that the stellar initial mass function ( imf ) evolves towards more high - mass star formation at earlier epochs such that the critical stellar mass in the imf varies approximately from the present as @xmath48 to @xmath49 .",
    "the arguments listed above apply to the high redshift universe where the dominant contributors to both light and stellar mass are massive star - bursting galaxies .",
    "there is also some intriguing evidence from the local universe that differentiates the imf in current epoch luminous star - forming galaxies from their lower luminosity counterparts .",
    "nearby massive star - forming galaxies seem to have an imf that is more massive star - dominated than lower mass galaxies .",
    "there is evidence for a non - universal stellar initial mass function from the integrated properties of sdss galaxies , according to @xcite .",
    "these authors inferred the stellar initial mass function from the integrated light properties of galaxies by comparing galaxy h - alpha equivalent widths ( ew ) with a broadband color index to constrain the imf .",
    "they find that low luminosity galaxies have much lower ew(h ) than expected for their colors and argue that this is due to the imf in low luminosity galaxies having fewer massive stars , either by steeper slope or lower upper mass cutoff , than that for luminous galaxies .",
    "a similar result for hi - selected galaxies emerges via the h - alpha and the far - ultraviolet continuum tracers of star formation .",
    "@xcite find that the flux ratio h - alpha / fuv shows strong correlations with the surface - brightness in h - alpha and the r band : low surface brightness ( lsb ) galaxies have lower ratios compared to high surface brightness galaxies .",
    "the most plausible explanation for the correlations are systematic variations of the upper mass limit and/or slope of the imf at the upper end .",
    "massive galaxies in the local universe have an imf that is preferentially enhanced in massive stars relative to low mass galaxies .",
    "it seems that a case can be made that galaxies which form stars rapidly , specifically massive galaxies at high redshift and their nearby counterparts , possess an imf that is relatively top - heavy ( or bottom - light ) .",
    "we can speculate that essentially all vigorously star - forming systems at high redshift may similarly possess an imf enriched in intermediate mass stars .",
    "these at least are the building blocks that in our model provide the sources of the bulk of ionizing photons at @xmath38 as high as @xmath50 and play a role in the recycling of processed gas .",
    "it is well known that massive pop iii stars have a very specific impact on the nucleosynthesis budget of the early universe . in this context , it is useful to incorporate stellar halo observations , specifically from extremely metal - poor stars ( emps , [ fe / h ] @xmath52 ) , ultra - metal - poor stars ( umps , [ fe / h ] @xmath53 ) and hyper - metal poor stars ( hmps , [ fe / h ] @xmath54 ) to derive constraints on the mass range of massive pop iii stars . from the nucleosynthetic point of view",
    ", halo stars have long been used to constrain galactic chemical evolution models , but were , until recently , quite disconnected from cosmological models .",
    "indeed , these old low mass stars preserve their pristine composition on their surface .",
    "the abundance patterns seen in these metal - poor stars , originating presumably from pop iii stars , can yield very precious information about the first nucleosynthesis processes in the universe ( subsequent to the big bang ) , and thus gives one the possibility of exploring the universe during the period of reionization @xcite .    on the other hand ,",
    "it has been shown @xcite that the abundances of ionized carbon and neutral atomic oxygen are important for the transition from pop iii to pop ii / i star formation . @xcite",
    "defined a transition discriminant , d_trans = ( 10^[c / h]+0.3 10^[o / h ] ) [ dtrans ] which clearly reveals the nucleosynthetic imprint of pop iii stars .",
    "this function has the great advantage of being able to connect aspects of cosmological evolution with the c / o abundances in low mass stars . in this context ,",
    "carbon - enhanced metal - poor stars or carbon - rich ultra - metal - poor stars ( cemps and crumps ) seem to indicate an overabundance of carbon ( and oxygen ) at early stages of evolution .",
    "cemps represent about 20 percent of the metal poor stars .",
    "recent studies considering multi - zone chemical evolution models show that only models with increased c yields or an initial top - heavy imf in the i m star mass range provide good fits of observations in the milky way @xcite .",
    "note that these models also predict a nitrogen enhancement which will be considered below .",
    "therefore , from the nucleosynthesis viewpoint it is interesting to consider i m stars as pop iii candidates , since they are producers of both c and he .",
    "finally , observations of metal absorption features in the intergalactic medium ( igm ) give important constraints on models of the formation and evolution of the earliest structures .",
    "recent measurements of c in the igm @xcite show an increase of this element at about @xmath55 .",
    "this seems to clearly indicate an increase in the star formation rate at this redshift able to produce carbon .",
    "again , i m stars are good candidates for explaining this trend .",
    "note that we also predict that igm material could have a high c / o ratio ; indeed , we can obtain insight into this ratio from observations , though presently , it is difficult to obtain reliable c / o ratios from ionized abundance data ( namely civ and ovi ) .      in the course of standard stellar evolution , nitrogen is produced through he burning .",
    "primary nitrogen is also synthesized in massive stars in the h burning layer via fresh carbon coming from the he burning core . in intermediate - mass stars",
    ", nitrogen is produced together with carbon .",
    "hot bottom - burning plays a dominant role for the synthesis of n and the amount of nitrogen produced depends on the efficiency and the duration of nuclear burning . at lower metallicity , the production of nitrogen",
    "is favored over carbon .",
    "there are indeed systems at low metallicity , such as 47 tuc and m71 , which show large nitrogen enhancements @xcite .",
    "abundance patterns found in these systems make it difficult to argue that the nitrogen enhancements are due to internal contamination , and lend credence to the hypothesis of an early i m stellar population @xcite .",
    "the evolution of the nitrogen abundance is very sensitive to specific parameter choices in the chemical evolution model @xcite .",
    "included among these are the uncertainties stemming from the yields @xcite particularly in the upper end of the i m mass range ( @xmath56 3 m@xmath0 ) .",
    "unfortunately , this element is difficult to observe .",
    "indeed , the best measurements come from the cn bx electronic transition band which is not generally detected . in this context",
    ", it is difficult to confront the calculated evolution of this element with available observations .",
    "however , it is interesting to note that n is observed in the few cemps as shown below .",
    "magnesium is produced predominantly in type ii supernovae where it is formed in the carbon and neon burning shells in massive stars .",
    "the dominant isotope formed in snii is 24 .",
    "the neutron - rich isotopes 25 and 26 are produced in the outer carbon layer through @xmath57 capture on neon .",
    "the yield of the heavier isotopes scales with the metallicity in the carbon layer and as a result , very little of these isotopes are produced at low metallicity .",
    "in contrast , significant amounts of 25,26 are produced during hot bottom - burning in the asymptotic giant branch phase in i m stars @xcite .",
    "these stars are hot enough for efficient proton capture processes on mg leading to al ( which decays to the heavier mg isotopes ) .",
    "the neutron - rich isotopes are also produced during thermal pulses of the helium burning shell . here",
    ", @xmath57 capture on @xmath58ne ( which is produced from @xmath57 capture on @xmath59n ) lead to both 25 and 26 .",
    "the latter process is very important for @xmath60 m@xmath0 @xcite .",
    "several observations @xcite indicate enhancements of the neutron - rich isotopes in low metallicity stars which could necessitate the presence of an early population of i m stars @xcite .    finally , it is interesting to note that mg has been observed in ultra - faint dwarfs galaxies @xcite which are representative of the nucleosynthetic processes in the first galaxies .",
    "specifically , in spite of the uncertainties related to the mg data in these objects , we also note that [ mg / fe ] ratio is somewhat higher ( about 1 ) in these structures compared to the local data ( about 0.3 ) in figure 1 of @xcite .",
    "once again this could be a signature of the presence of i m stars in these primitive galaxies .",
    "the best current limits on the halo old white dwarf population come from a combination of interpreting the macho and eros microlensing events with improved white dwarf atmosphere modeling @xcite .",
    "the upper limit , including white dwarfs with hydrogen - deficient atmospheres , allows an increased microlensing optical depth .",
    "the upper limit to the contribution of halo white dwarfs is comparable to that of the thick disk , and accounts for at most 10% of the halo dark matter between the mwg and the lmc .",
    "the macho upper limit , which has not been affected by subsequent microlensing studies , is approximately 20% ( @xcite ) . for comparison ,",
    "our i m pop iii component gives a white dwarf mass fraction very comparable to the standard one ; it differs only by 15 % ( see figure [ fig : mass ] below ) .      among the important constraints imposed on the models of cosmic chemical evolution are the rates of supernovae ( sn )",
    "these are intimately linked to the choice of an imf and sfr and represent an independent probe of the star - forming universe . while type ii rates directly trace the star formation history ,",
    "there is a model - dependent time delay between the formation ( and lifetime ) of the progenitor star and the type ia explosion . since existing data is available only for relatively low redshifts , we discuss the predicted sn rates in the context of three different models and give some constraints related to the snia rate coming from the i m star mode .",
    "our early i m stellar population hypothesis inevitably produces many sn at high redshift .",
    "the predicted sfr and sn rates are presented below . the sfr rate corrections ( for dust , luminosity function etc ) are notoriously unreliable at @xmath61 where our i m population ( predominantly formed earlier than @xmath62 ) makes a significant contribution .",
    "the sn ia rates provide a potentially more robust discriminant .",
    "however we note here that three issues help reconcile our sn rate predictions with observations of snia at @xmath63 most importantly , the selection efficiently of snia , in the absence of near infrared selection , dives rapidly to zero at high redshift ( beyond @xmath64 ) .",
    "indeed , from @xcite , the extrapolation of the efficiency to @xmath65 implies a steep drop ( to only a fraction of a percent ) .",
    "moreover the snia precursors are predominantly in low mass galaxies , which contain sub - luminous snia , by as much as @xmath66 magnitude @xcite .",
    "thirdly , it may be that at low metallicity ( [ fe / h ] @xmath67 ) , the absence of iron lines driving optically thick winds may greatly inhibit the number of snia @xcite .",
    "finally , note that there are large uncertainties related to the time delay between i m star formation and the resulting snia explosion .",
    "these uncertainties add to the complexity of the question , since the predicted bulk of snia can be found at higher or lower high redshift , according to the value of this time delay @xcite .",
    "there are only a few basic ingredients to a standard ( non - cosmological ) galactic evolution model .",
    "these include : the specification of an imf , usually assumed to be a power law of the form @xmath68 ; a star formation rate , which may be proportional to some power of the gas mass fraction or a specified function of time ; a specification of stellar properties such as lifetimes and elemental yields .",
    "more complex models will include infall of gas from the igm , and outflows from stellar induced winds .",
    "certain observations such as the metallicity distribution in low mass stars may call for the prompt initial enrichment of metals which can be accomplished using bi - modal models of chemical evolution in which a standard mode ( e.g. a salpeter imf and a sfr proportional to the gas fraction ) is supplemented with a shallow imf providing predominantly massive stars over a brief period of time ( or metallicity ) . in this section",
    ", we will show that this approach can not work for the prompt enrichment of 4 as the most massive stars would produce heavy elements very early and thus would not enhance the ratio of he to metals .",
    "in other words , the enrichment of helium would occur too late and would not explain the enhancement in low metallicity regions .",
    "in contrast , bi - modal models which are augmented with a population of intermediate mass stars ( with mass between 2 and 8 m@xmath0 ) , can indeed provide an enrichment of helium at low metallicity in simple galactic chemical evolution models .",
    "while the model presented in this section can not directly be extended to a model of cosmic chemical evolution , it does provide some insight to the needed bimodality involving i m stars that will carry over into a more sophisticated model based on hierarchical structure formation as in @xcite .    in @xcite , we constructed chemical evolution models which led to significant d astration at low metallicity and also had significant white dwarf production .",
    "these models were based on a bimodal construction where the ` massive ' mode consisted of i m stars .",
    "here we consider the effect of such models on 4 production at low metallicity .",
    "we illustrate results with the simple closed - box model of @xcite , which neglects both infall and outflow of baryons .",
    "baryonic cycling through stars is determined by the creation function @xmath69 n_= c(m , t ) m t , which describes the mass distribution of new stars and the total star - formation rate @xmath70 .",
    "we adopt a `` bimodal '' creation function [ eq : creation ] c(m , t ) = _ 1(t ) _",
    "1(m ) + _ 2(t ) _",
    "2(m ) , each term of which represents a distinct star - formation mode .    in the first term of eq .",
    "( [ eq : creation ] ) we encode an early burst of i m star formation ; to do this we adopt the star formation rate [ eq : burst ] _ 1 = x_burst  e^-t/_1 , with a burst timescale @xmath71 myr .",
    "the parameter @xmath72 controls the fraction of the baryonic mass @xmath73 which is processed in the burst ; we will show results for different values of this parameter , but clearly we must have @xmath74 . since our focus is on i m stars ,",
    "the imf for this mode is a power - law ( salpeter ) form : @xmath75 , for @xmath76 $ ] .    the second term in eq .",
    "( [ eq : creation ] ) describes normal star formation .",
    "again , following @xcite , we adopt the classic form @xmath77 , with @xmath78 , and a smoothing factor @xmath79 which ensures that star formation begins in the bursting i m mode , which then smoothly goes over to the standard mode .",
    "the normal - mode imf is of the salpeter form @xmath80 , but now with @xmath81 $ ] .",
    "both imfs are normalized in the usual way @xmath82 .    in fig .",

    "curves are shown for different values of the burst mass fraction @xmath72 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : burst ] ) . in the case of normal star formation",
    "( i.e. , when @xmath84 and the i m mode is absent ) , as o increases we see he rise from its primordial value , but undershoots the low - metallicity data . that normal star formation fails to match the data traces back to nucleosynthesis patterns in high - mass stars , which dominate the production of o and of new he in this scenario .",
    "specifically , for high - mass stars , the ejecta have @xmath85 , i.e. , comparable masses of new he and of o @xcite .",
    "thus at low metallicity @xmath86 , we have @xmath87 , whereas the data seem to require @xmath88 .",
    "this not only explains the problem with this simple scenario , but also suggests the solution : invoke a stellar population which has substantially different helium and metal nucleosynthesis .    indeed , fig .",
    "[ fig : simphe ] shows that as we turn on the bursting i m mode via @xmath89 , there is an abrupt rise in he at low o abundances , with a larger rise for larger @xmath72 .",
    "as anticipated , this rise now allows for the predictions to match the data , with good fits for @xmath90 .",
    "the origin of this rise is clearly reflects the nucleosynthesis patterns of i m stars , whose ejecta are much more enriched in new he than in o , relative to massive stars .",
    "specifically , for i m stars at low metallicity in the @xmath91 we have @xmath92 @xcite .",
    "these large ratios trace back to the very small o production in these stars .",
    "the results thus far are for the simplest possible model : a single - zone closed box . staying with single - zone models ,",
    "even if we include infall and/or outflow the results should be similar . in the case of primordial infall , both the metal and new he yields",
    "will be diluted , and by the same factor .",
    "thus the he - o trends should stay the same .",
    "similarly , in the case of outflows , the abundances in the gas remaining in the box are only affected if the flow ejects one element preferentially relative to the other . but",
    "again , given that the o and new he are produced in the same environments , any physically realizable winds will remove them together , leaving the remaining gas with he - o trends unaffected .",
    "the lessons we draw from our simple model are that an increase in helium at low metallicity , as suggested by observations , can be accomplished at the cost of processing 10%20% of observable cosmic baryons through i m stars . but as shown in @xcite and discussed above , such a scenario also has substantial consequences , including other element abundances , white dwarfs , and type ia supernovae . to examine all of these issues in a more realistic manner requires a chemical evolution model in a cosmological context .",
    "the study of star formation in a cosmological context requires the inclusion of i ) a model of dark matter structure formation , and ii ) accretion and outflow of baryonic matter with respect to existing and forming structures .",
    "we have developed a detailed model of cosmological chemical evolution @xcite using a description of non linear structures , based on the standard press - schechter ( ps ) formalism @xcite .",
    "baryons are placed 1 ) within stars or their remnants within collapsed structures , 2 ) in gas within collapsed structures ( the interstellar medium ( ism ) ) , or 3 ) outside of structures ( the intergalactic medium , igm ) .",
    "the rate at which structures accrete mass is determined by a press - schechter distribution function , @xmath93 .",
    "the model included mass ( baryon ) exchange between the igm and ism , and between the ism and stellar component .",
    "in this study we assume that the minimum mass of dark matter halos for star - forming structures is @xmath94 m@xmath0 .",
    "once the model is specified , we can follow many astrophysical quantities such as : the global sfr , the optical depth , the supernova ( sn ) rates and the abundances of individual elements ( y , d , li , fe , c , n , o , mg abundances ) which are used to tackle specific questions related to early star formation and the reionization epoch . in this study , we consider two distinct modes of star formation : a normal mode of pop ii / i and a massive or intermediate mass mode of pop iii stars .    throughout this paper , a primordial power spectrum with a power law index @xmath95",
    "is assumed and we adopt the cosmological parameters of the so - called concordance model @xcite , i.e. @xmath96 , @xmath97 , @xmath98 and @xmath99 .      as in the simple model described in section [ model1 ] , the models considered are bimodal .",
    "each model contains a normal mode with stellar masses between 0.1 m@xmath100 and 100 m@xmath100 , with a near salpeter imf ( @xmath101 ) ( hereafter called model 2 ) .",
    "we fit the sfr history of pop ii / i stars to the data compiled in @xcite ( from @xmath102 to 5 ) , and to the recent measurements at high redshift by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "these observations place strong constraints on the pop ii / i sfr . the fit for the sfr , @xmath103 ,",
    "is based on the mathematical form proposed in @xcite    @xmath104    the amplitude ( astration rate ) and the redshift of the sfr maximum are given by @xmath105 and @xmath106 respectively , while @xmath107 and @xmath108 are related to its slope at low and high redshifts respectively . the normal mode is fitted using : @xmath109 m@xmath0 yr@xmath110 mpc@xmath111 , @xmath112 , @xmath113 and @xmath114 .",
    "the sfr of this mode peaks at @xmath115 .",
    "in addition to the normal mode , we add a mode for pop iii stars .",
    "our primary interest here is a model for i m pop iii stars , and we choose an i m component of stars with 2 - 8 m@xmath0 ( hereafter model 3 ) , assuming an imf with slope 1.3 .",
    "some fraction of the i m stars become snia .",
    "the sfr parameters are the following : @xmath116 m@xmath0 yr@xmath110 mpc@xmath111 , @xmath117 , @xmath118 and @xmath119 .",
    "the redshift peak is chosen so that the i m stars are born in time to affect low - metallicity abundances , and the normalization is chosen to allow a substantial effect on 4 .    for comparative purposes",
    ", we also consider a massive component with stars between 36 - 100 m@xmath0 with an imf slope of 1.6 , which terminate as type ii supernovae ( snii ) ( hereafter model 1 ) .",
    "the sfr parameters are the following : @xmath120 m@xmath0 yr@xmath110 mpc@xmath111 , @xmath121 , @xmath122 and @xmath123 . for a detailed description of the model see @xcite and @xcite .",
    "note that both models 1 ( massive ) and 3 ( i m ) include the normal mode ( model 2 ) .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : sfr ] , we show the adopted sfr for each of the three cases considered . as one can see , the normal mode is chosen to fit the observations also plotted in the figure . as the data extend only up to @xmath124 ,",
    "there is essentially no constraint on the massive mode which dominates at @xmath125 .",
    "data at @xmath61 is highly uncertain due to unknown systematics involving , among other effects , the dust corrections and adopted rest - frame uv luminosity function , and presents essentially no conflict with our models ( @xcite ) .",
    "[ fig : sfr ] also shows that the i m mode represents a significant processing of baryons .",
    "the peak of the i m star formation rate is about a factor @xmath50 higher than the peak of the normal star formation rate , and a factor @xmath126 higher than the massive pop iii star formation rate . on the other hand , the i m star formation peak lasts for about a factor @xmath50 less time than the normal star formation rate .",
    "thus we expect that roughly comparable amounts of baryons will be processed through these two modes .",
    "in contrast , a much smaller fraction of baryons are processes through the massive pop iii mode .",
    "one should recall , however , that in our model many baryons always remain the igm and never reside in galaxies nor are processed though stars .",
    "figure [ fig : mass ] represents the mass fraction of each component related to the total mass of baryons : igm , galaxies and stars .",
    "note that the addition of the i m star component does not affect the mass fraction of stars ( including remnants ) at low redshift .",
    "note that the star fraction in the i m mode has an initial peak at about @xmath127 of all baryons .",
    "this occurs at @xmath128 .",
    "the star fraction then drops as the i m stars die off , then rises with normal star formation . thus we see that in our model , about 10% of the baryons are processed through the i m mode .",
    "in contrast , we see that the massive pop iii mode only processes about @xmath129 of all baryons .",
    "the lifetimes of intermediate mass stars ( @xmath130 ) are taken from @xcite and from @xcite for more massive stars .",
    "old halo stars with masses below @xmath131 have a lifetime long enough to be observed today .",
    "they are assumed to inherit the abundances of the ism at the time of their formation .",
    "thus , their observed abundances reflect , in a complex way ( due to exchanges with the igm ) , the yields of all massive stars that have exploded earlier .",
    "the yields of stars depend on their mass and their metallicity , but not on their status ( i.e. pop ii / i or pop iii ) .",
    "some pop ii / i stars are massive , although in only a very small proportion since we use a slightly steeper than salpeter imf .",
    "pop iii stars are all massive stars .",
    "we use the tables of yields ( and remnant types ) given in  @xcite for intermediate mass stars ( @xmath132 ) , and the tables in  @xcite for massive stars ( @xmath133 ) .",
    "an interpolation is made between different metallicities ( z=0 and z=@xmath134z@xmath0 ) and we extrapolate the tabulated values beyond 40 .",
    "having specified the models under consideration , we can now systematically consider the consequences of our particular choices for pop iii stars .",
    "for most of the results which follow , we will compare three distinct model choices .",
    "1 ) model 2 alone , ie , only pop ii / i stars ; 2 ) model 3 , a bimodal model including the normal mode ( model 2 ) plus the i m mode of pop iii stars ; 3 ) model 1 , a bimodal model including the normal model ( model 2 ) plus the massive mode of pop iii stars .",
    "having set the sfr in our model , we now compute the electron scattering optical depth for our choice of imf .",
    "the evolution of the volume filling fraction of ionized regions is given by : = -_bn_bc(z ) q_ion^2(z)(1+z)^3|| where @xmath135 is the comoving density in baryons , @xmath136 the comoving density of ionizing photons , @xmath137 the recombination coefficient , and @xmath138 the clumping factor .",
    "this factor is taken from @xcite and varies from a value of 2 at @xmath139 to a constant value of 10 for @xmath140 .",
    "the escape fraction , @xmath141 , is set to 0.2 for both pop iii and popii / i .",
    "the number of ionizing photons for massive stars is calculated using the tables given in @xcite .",
    "finally , the thomson optical depth is computed as in @xcite : @xmath142 where @xmath38 is the redshift of emission , and @xmath143 the thomson scattering cross - section .    in figure",
    "[ fig : opticald ] , we plot the integrated optical depth from @xmath102 to @xmath38 .",
    "the red band represents the observed results from wmap7 @xcite .",
    "as one might expect , the normal mode alone ( model 2 shown as the solid blue curve ) is not capable of producing a sufficiently large optical depth .",
    "the massive mode ( model 1 shown by the red dashed curve ) does manage to reionize the igm , but only barely .",
    "of course more reionization is possible by increasing the sfr for the massive mode , but this would lead to complications in elemental abundances .",
    "we see that the i m mode ( model 3 - shown by the black dotted curve ) is able to easily reionize the universe compared to models 1 and 2 .",
    "our models allow an escape fraction as low as @xmath144 which provides considerable flexibility in accounting for reionization . while the ratio of ionizing photons from a 6  star vs that of a 20  star is small , one has many additional stars in the i m scenario relative to the number in the massive mode .",
    "we next consider the evolution of the abundances of he , cno , fe and mg as a function of the redshift and/or the metallicity .",
    "we also show the evolution of d and 7 due to early astration .",
    "we begin with the evolution of the 4 abundance . in the left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : heoz ] , we show the analogue of fig .",
    "[ fig : simphe ] for the bimodal models based on hierarchical structure formation .",
    "plotted is the 4 mass fraction , @xmath83 , vs. [ o / h ] .",
    "the solid blue curve corresponds to the model with only a pop ii / i contribution .",
    "this result is indistinguishable from that produced by models including the massive pop iii contribution ( not shown ) .",
    "this can be understood as the bulk of the 4 and oxygen are derived from the same stars in the two models . in both cases , the helium abundance begins at the bbn primordial value and remains rather flat until the oxygen abundance is roughy 1/10th of solar .",
    "in contrast , as shown by the black dotted curve , in the i m pop iii model , 4 is produced early in i m stars with little or no accompanied oxygen . as a result , the 4 mass fraction begins to grow at very low [ o / h ] and for the model parameters chosen , plateaus at value close to @xmath145 , in good agreement with recent determinations @xcite . as in the case of the simple model discussed in section [ model1 ] , this model ,",
    "therefore produces an effective prompt initial enrichment of 4 in low metallicity galaxies .",
    "note however , that due to the size of the error bar associated with the observations , we can not exclude the possibility that no enrichment occurred , leaving models 1 and 2 viable .    [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]     due to large uncertainties concerning the time delay , we present two cases @xcite .",
    "we hold the delay fixed at 2.5 gyr for normal mode stars , but in the left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : sni ] , we choose a delay of 3.4 gyr and in the right panel we take 0.5 gyr for model 3 . while the normal mode fits the data quite well , we see that the population of i m stars creates a significant bump in the snia rate at high redshift . unless the time delay for these supernovae is reduced from the nominal value of 2.5 gyr ( as in the right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : sni ] ) the snia rate would greatly exceed the observed rate at redshifts between 1 and 1.5 .",
    "if the delay is smaller , the bump in the snia rate is pushed to higher redshift .",
    "of course , it may be that for pop iii stars , the fraction @xmath146 of i m stars becoming snia is reduced as discussed in section [ presn ] .    in the upper panel fig . [",
    "fig : supernovae ] , the sni / snii ratio is plotted as a function of the redshift for models 1 and 3 . in the lower panel of the figure both snia and snii rates",
    "are plotted , as in [ fig : snii ] and [ fig : sni ] .",
    "the i m stellar mode predicts that the bulk of snia occur at hight redshift , though this results depends on the time delay of these sn .",
    "however , at such a high redshift the selection efficiently drops rapidly towards zero ( @xcite ) and we can not exclude the existence of this snia component . in the future it would be interesting to have observational insight into low mass galaxies , which could contain sub - luminous snia .",
    "an alternative , if these sub luminous snia are not observed we could put strong constraints on the early helium abundance in the primitive structures .",
    "it is interesting to note the interplay between the i m constraints from halo star carbon abundances and from and type ia sne .",
    "namely , at the end of  [ sect : nuke ] we argued that the existence of c - rich metal - poor halo stars seems to _ require _ an early cosmic i m star population , but the relative rarity of such c - rich stars also seems to imply the i m population was sub - dominant , perhaps accounting for @xmath147 of early star formation . note",
    "that if we apply this same @xmath147 factor to the i m predictions for type ia sne in figs .",
    "[ fig : sni ] and [ fig : supernovae ] , the predictions would be brought into agreement with the observations .",
    "similarly , we could argue the other direction , demanding that the i m fraction be small enough to agree with the type ia sn observations ; this would again give @xmath147 of our all - im pop iii model , and thus would agree with the rough statistics suggested by the counts of c - rich metal poor stars .",
    "this rough concordance may be coincidental but is nonetheless both encouraging and intriguing .",
    "by definition , as the first stars formed in a metal - free environment , pop iii stars existed and played a role in our past history . however , the identity and mass distribution of these stars is largely unknown .",
    "we expect that they played an important role in re - ionizing the universe at high redshift , as well as laid the chemical seeds for future generations of stars ( population ii / i ) .",
    "we also know that a salpeter imf , typical of population i with a mass range of 0.1 - 100 m@xmath0 is not capable of producing a sufficient optical depth for reionization or of producing the specific abundance patterns in emps .",
    "very massive stars ( @xmath148 m@xmath0 ) also fail in producing the observed abundance patterns , though they are certainly capable of reionizing the universe .",
    "a top - heavy imf for pop iii was studied in the cosmological context in @xcite and while successful in many aspects , is not capable of producing the ( albeit weak ) evidence for an enhancement in 4 at low metallicity over bbn predictions or the lagre carbon enhancements which are made manifest in the parameter @xmath149 . to the best of our knowledge , i m stars as candidates for pop iii have not been studied in the cosmological context .",
    "we have shown that an early generation of i m stars is indeed capable of providing an effective prompt initial enrichment of he .",
    "we have also shown , perhaps surprisingly , that these stars normalized in abundance to the required he enrichment , are more than capable of providing a sufficient number of ionizing photons to the early igm . also as a bonus , i m stars can provide the large abundance ratios of c , n , o , and mg relative to fe in emp stars .",
    "however , our results indicate that one can not simply assume a homogeneous and well - mixed igm and/or ism as smaller structures grow to large galaxies and clusters of galaxies . the cno abundance that this model predicts at metallicities between @xmath150 [ fe / h ]",
    "@xmath52 far surpasses the abundances observed in the igm .",
    "we are thus led to an interesting dilemma which is best characterized by the data displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig : dtrans ] . recall that the discriminant @xmath51 represents a measure of carbon and oxygen produced in prior generations of stars . as discussed earlier ,",
    "the data show two distinct populations : the bulk of the data show increasing @xmath51 with [ fe / h ] and is very well modeled by either a standard or top - heavy imf ; and a second population with very large @xmath51 between @xmath150 [ fe / h ] @xmath52 .",
    "the latter is well explained by our pop iii i m stellar mode .",
    "how can one model explain both populations ?",
    "it is perhaps too naive to expect a homogeneous model as the type we have been describing to explain this discrepancy .",
    "indeed one can imagine that the impact of the generation of i m stars was effective only early on in the building of higher mass objects in the hierarchical structure formation scenario .",
    "that is , this generation was active only in the smallest scale structures , here taken to be typically @xmath94 m@xmath0 .",
    "these structures and the low mass stars and remnants left behind were in some cases incorporated into the halos of larger objects to become galaxies .",
    "others remain as low mass dwarfs . in this way",
    ", one can perhaps explain the bulk of the observations of low and increasing @xmath51 in stars formed in larger scale objects involving a larger baryon fraction , while those stars with large @xmath51 would be explained by the impact of i m stars in the smallest structures formed .",
    "indeed , using both carbon data on metal - poor stars , and type ia sn observations , we roughly estimate that a pop iii i m mode operates at @xmath151 of our model rate .",
    "since our i m mode processes about 10% of baryons , this in turn implies that @xmath152 of baryons participate in i m star formation .    in this interpretation , the prompt initial enrichment of 4 , which is observed largely in dwarf irregular galaxies , was also impacted by i m stars as these objects were evidently not incorporated into larger scale structures . in the context of the light element abundances ,",
    "it is interesting to note further that some of the stars which show large carbon enhancements also show deficiencies in 7 .",
    "furthermore , there is increasing evidence @xcite for a breakdown of the spite plateau at metallicities below [ fe / h ] @xmath52 .",
    "in @xcite , it is argued that the depletion ( which shows considerable dispersion _ below _ the plateau ) at low metallicity may have been due to stellar astration .",
    "the model discussed here ( given the above interpretation ) can account for most of the astration seen in these stars .",
    "the model can not , however , account for the discrepancy between the bbn prediction at the wmap baryon density and the spite plateau value as speculated in @xcite .",
    "note that the depletion in d / h is probably not an issue , as the absorption systems with measured d / h are presumably larger scale structures for which our abundance patterns would not be expected to apply .    unfortunately ,",
    "neither of the two pop iii models delivers entirely satisfactory results . while the massive mode , is capable of producing sufficiently high ratios of [ c , o , mg / fe ] to explain the observations of extremely iron - poor stars , the high ratios occur almost instantly after the first stars are born , and thus require these stars to be born at that time at very high redshift .",
    "this model also has difficulty in explaining the high [ n / fe ] or [ c / o ] ratios seen . as a result",
    ", the massive pop iii model can not explain the high values of @xmath51 seen in some stars .",
    "the model can not account for the effective prompt initial enrichment of 4 nor can it be used to account for the astration of 7 below the spite plateau . on the other hand , the i m model for pop iii underproduces [ o / fe ] and because of the large amounts of c and n produced can not explain the bulk of the values of @xmath51 observed , but the top panel data is explained due to the overabundances of c , n . indeed , the overproduction of these elements would preclude the homogeneous and well - mixed treatment of gas in ever increasingly large scale structures .",
    "another distinctive feature of the i m pop iii model is the prediction for the rate of type ia supernovae at high redshift .",
    "this model naturally predicts a large increase in the type ia rate _ if _ the efficiency for supernovae is constant and the time delay is not small .",
    "it is relevant to speculate that a small high mass tail in the i m population could lead to possible grbs in the redshift range 10 - 20 .",
    "this would fill the  grb desert \" between pop ii and the usual high redshift pop iii stars .",
