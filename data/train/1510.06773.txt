    "this paper is about the representation theory of finite group schemes over a field @xmath0 of positive characteristic .",
    "a finite group scheme @xmath1 is an affine group scheme whose coordinate algebra is a finite dimensional vector space over @xmath0 . in that case , the linear dual of the coordinate algebra , called the _ group algebra _ of @xmath1 , is a finite dimensional cocommutative hopf algebra , whose representation theory is equivalent to that of @xmath1 .",
    "this means that all our results can be restated for finite dimensional cocommutative hopf @xmath0-algebras , but we adhere to the geometric language .",
    "examples of finite group schemes include finite groups , restricted enveloping algebras of finite dimensional @xmath2-lie algebras , and frobenius kernels of algebraic groups .",
    "the representation theory of finite group schemes over @xmath0 is often wild , even in such small cases as the finite group @xmath3 over a field of characteristic three , or the @xmath4-dimensional heisenberg lie algebra . in constructive terms , this means that it is not possible to classify the finite dimensional indecomposable modules .",
    "one thus has to find better ways to organise our understanding of the structure of the module category of @xmath1 .",
    "developments in stable homotopy theory and algebraic geometry suggest a natural extension of the process of building modules up to direct sums .",
    "namely , in addition to ( possibly infinite ) direct sums and summands , one allows taking syzygies ( both positive and negative ) , extensions , and tensoring ( over @xmath0 ) with simple @xmath1-modules .",
    "we say @xmath5 is _ built out _ of @xmath6 if @xmath5 can be constructed out of @xmath6 using these operations .",
    "what follows is one of the main results of this work .",
    "let @xmath5 and @xmath6 be non - zero @xmath1-modules .",
    "one can build @xmath5 out of @xmath6 if ( and only if ) there is an inclusion @xmath7 .    here",
    "@xmath8 denotes the @xmath9-support of @xmath5 introduced by friedlander and pevtsova  @xcite , and recalled in section  [ se : pi - points ] .",
    "it is a subset of the space of @xmath9-points of @xmath1 and the latter is homeomorphic to @xmath10 .",
    "recall that @xmath11 , the cohomology algebra of @xmath1 , is a finitely generated graded - commutative @xmath0-algebra , by a result of friedlander and suslin  @xcite .",
    "thus , @xmath8 may be seen as an algebro - geometric portrait of @xmath5 and the gist of the theorem is that this is fine enough to capture at least homological aspects of the @xmath1-module @xmath5 .",
    "the proper context for the result above is @xmath12 , the stable module category of @xmath1 , and @xmath13 , the homotopy category of complexes of injective @xmath1-modules .",
    "these are compactly generated triangulated categories that inherit the tensor product of @xmath1-modules .",
    "we deduce corollary  [ co : modules ] from an essentially equivalent statement , theorem  [ th : stratification ] , that gives a classification of the tensor ideal localising subcategories of @xmath12 .",
    "see corollary  [ co : stratification ] for a version dealing with @xmath13 .",
    "when @xmath5 and @xmath6 are finite dimensional , @xmath5 is built of out @xmath6 only if it is _ finitely _ built out of @xmath6 , meaning that one needs only finite direct sums in the building process .",
    "consequently , the results mentioned in the preceding paragraph yield a classification of the tensor ideal thick subcategories of @xmath14 and @xmath15 , the stable module category and the bounded derived category , respectively , of finite dimensional modules .",
    "this is because these categories are equivalent to the subcategories of compact objects of @xmath12 and @xmath13 , respectively .",
    "the genesis of such results is a classification theorem of devinatz , hopkins , and smith for the stable homotopy category of finite spectra @xcite .",
    "classification theorems for other `` small '' categories followed : see hopkins  @xcite and neeman  @xcite for perfect complexes over a commutative noetherian ring ; thomason  @xcite for perfect complexes of sheaves over a quasi - compact , quasi - separated scheme ; benson , carlson , and rickard  @xcite for finite dimensional modules of a finite group , as well as many more recent developments .",
    "our results cover not only finite dimensional modules , but also the `` big '' category of all @xmath1-modules , so the closest precursor is neeman s classification  @xcite for all complexes over a commutative noetherian ring .",
    "an analogous statement for group schemes arising from finite groups is proved in  @xcite .",
    "theorem  [ th : stratification ] is new for all other classes of finite groups schemes .",
    "arbitrary finite group schemes lack many of the structural properties of finite groups , as we explain further below . consequently the methods we use in this work are fundamentally different from the ones that lead to the successful resolution of the classification problem for finite groups in  @xcite .",
    "in fact , our proof of theorem  [ th : stratification ] provides another proof for the case of finite groups .",
    "the two new ideas developed and exploited in this work are that of @xmath9-cosupport of a @xmath1-module introduced in @xcite , and a technique of reduction to closed points that enhances a local to global principle from @xcite .    for a finite group @xmath1 , the proof of the classification theorem given in @xcite proceeds by a reduction to the case of elementary abelian groups .",
    "this hinges on chouinard s theorem that a @xmath1-module is projective if and only if its restriction to all elementary abelian subgroups of @xmath1 is projective .",
    "such a reduction is an essential step also in a second proof of the classification theorem for finite groups described in  @xcite . for general finite group schemes",
    "there is no straightforward replacement for a detecting family of subgroups akin to elementary abelian subgroups of finite groups : for any such family one needs to allow scalar extensions .",
    "see example  [ ex : sl2 ] and the discussion around corollary  [ co : chouinard ] .",
    "the first crucial step in the proof of the classification theorem is to verify that @xmath9-support detects projectivity :    any @xmath1-module @xmath5 with @xmath16 is projective .    there is a flaw in the proof of this statement given in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem  5.3 ) , as we explain in remark 5.7 . for this reason , part  [ part : detection ] of this paper",
    "is devoted to a proof of this result .",
    "much of the argument is already available in the literature but is spread across various places .",
    "the new idea that allowed us to repair the proof appears in a  subgroup reduction principle \" , theorem  [ th : principle ] , which also led to some simplifications of the known arguments .    as a consequence of the @xmath9-support detection theorem",
    "we prove :    for any @xmath1-module @xmath5 there is an equality @xmath17    here @xmath18 is the support of @xmath5 defined in @xcite using the action of @xmath11 on @xmath12 , recalled in section  [ se : bik ] .",
    "this allows us to apply the machinery developed in @xcite .",
    "the first advantage that we reap from this is the following _ local to global principle _ :",
    "for the desired classification it suffices to verify that for each point @xmath19 in @xmath20 the subcategory of @xmath12 consisting of modules with support in @xmath19 is _ minimal _ , in that it has no proper tensor ideal localising subcategories .",
    "this is tantamount to proving that when @xmath21 are @xmath1-modules whose support equals @xmath22 , the @xmath1-module of homomorphisms @xmath23 is not projective .    when @xmath19 is a closed point in @xmath20 , we verify this by using a new invariant of @xmath1-modules called @xmath9-cosupport introduced in @xcite , and recalled in section  [ se : pi - points ] .",
    "its relevance to the problem on hand stems from the equality below ; see theorem  [ th : tensor - and - hom - pi ] . @xmath24    the minimality for a general point @xmath19 in @xmath20 is established by a reduction to the case of closed points . to this end , in section  [ se : passage - to - closed - points ]",
    "we develop a technique that mimics the construction of generic points for irreducible algebraic varieties in the classical theory of zariski and weil .",
    "the results from commutative algebra that are required for this last step are established in section  [ se : generic - points ] .",
    "the ideas in these sections may be seen as an elaboration of the local to global principle eluded to above .",
    "they in fact suggest a richer version of the local to global principle and a passage to closed points that is likely to have further applications .",
    "one of the many known consequences of theorem  [ th : stratification ] is a classification of the tensor - ideal thick subcategories of @xmath14 , anticipated in @xcite , and of @xmath15 .",
    "this was mentioned earlier and is the content of theorem  [ th : thick ] and corollary  [ co : stratification ] .",
    "a few others are described in section  [ se : stratification ] .",
    "further applications specific to the context of finite group schemes are treated in section  [ se : cosupport ] .",
    "these include a proof that , akin to supports , the @xmath9-cosupport of a @xmath1-module coincides with its cosupport in the sense of @xcite :    for any @xmath1-module @xmath5 there is an equality @xmath25    this in turn is used to track support and cosupport under restriction and induction for subgroup schemes ; see proposition  [ pr : ind ] . that the result above is a consequence of the classification theorem also illustrates a key difference between the approach developed in this paper and the one in @xcite where we give a new proof of the classification theorem for finite groups .",
    "there we prove that @xmath9-cosupport coincides with cosupport , using linear algebra methods and special properties of finite groups , and deduce the classification theorem from it . in this paper",
    "our route is the opposite : we have to develop a new method to prove classification and then deduce the equality of cosupports from it .",
    "see also remark  [ re : cosupp ] .",
    "the methods developed in this work have led to other new results concerning the structure of the stable module category of a finite group scheme , including a classification of its hom closed _ colocalising _ subcategories  @xcite .",
    "[ part : recollections ] there have been two , rather different , approaches to studying representations of finite groups and finite groups schemes using geometric methods : via the theory of @xmath9-points and via the action of the cohomology ring on the stable category . both are critical for our work .",

    "in this section we recall the notion of @xmath9-points for finite group schemes .",
