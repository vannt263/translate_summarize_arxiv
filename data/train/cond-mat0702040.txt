    "it would be of interest to obtain information on the gd@xmath9 ordering .",

    "6 can be well fitted by the sum of four terms with different temperature dependence : @xmath67    the coefficient of the first term , @xmath68 = 0.89 mj / mol k@xmath69 , can be used to derive a debye temperature @xmath70 of the lattice , @xmath71 where @xmath72 is avogadro s number , @xmath73 the boltzmann constant , and the number of atoms per formula unit n = 14 .",
    "the @xmath70 value of 312 k thus obtained supports the validity of the t@xmath60-dependence approximation in debye model for the lattice specific heat below 7 k @xmath74/50 .",
    "the quadratic term has two possible sources : the nodal line excitation for @xmath23-wave pairing symmetry and the spin wave excitation of wfm ru sublattice .",
    "the fact that the observed @xmath75 value of 4.2 mj / mol k is much large than 0.1 mj / mol k of yba@xmath2cu@xmath25o@xmath11 could be an indication of a less important nodal line excitation , but an enhanced spin wave excitation .",
    "the linear term is considered normally as an electronic contribution , which is not expected to exist in a superconductor at temperature much lower than t@xmath1 . while the observed coefficient @xmath76 = 7.3 mj / mol k@xmath48 is comparable to that of some cuprates , its origin remains to be identified .",
    "one plausible explanation is based on the complicated magnetic structure and mixed valence .",
    "such a scenario could lead to a spin glass - like lattice , for which an even larger linear term in specific heat has been observed in another ru compound of ba@xmath2prruo@xmath12 .",
    "@xcite     low temperature c / t versus t@xmath48 of rusr@xmath2eucu@xmath2o@xmath3 from 1 k to 7 k. data above 1 k can be fitted using c(t ) = @xmath68t@xmath60 + @xmath75t@xmath48 + @xmath76 t + @xmath77/t@xmath48 with debye temperature @xmath70 = 312 k. ]    the last term with a t@xmath78 dependence is most likely the high - temperature tail of a schottky anomaly .",
    "its occurrence at the relatively low temperatures suggests nuclear energy splittings being the cause .",
    "such energy splittings occur typically for nuclei having a spin i and magnetic moment @xmath79 in a hyperfine magnetic field h@xmath80 . for the calorimetrical measurements under consideration ,",
    "they are is most likely associated with the ru nuclei , since the 4@xmath23 magnetic moments of ordered ru ions are spatially fixed , polarizing the @xmath81-electrons and producing a net spin at the nuclei , yielding a hyperfine field .",
    "there are two ru isotopes with non - zero @xmath79 : @xmath82ru ( fractional natural abundance a = 0.1276 , i = 5/2 , and @xmath79 = -0.6413 ) and @xmath83ru ( a = 0.1706 , i = 5/2 , and @xmath79 = -0.7188).@xcite however , nuclear energy splittings can also be caused by the interaction between the qudrupole moment of a nucleus and the electric field gradient produced by neighboring atoms .",
    "the electric field gradient could be quite high in the layered compound .",
    "meanwhile , cu and eu or @xmath84gd ( a = 14.7@xmath24 ) and @xmath85gd ( a = 15.7@xmath24 ) nuclei all have non - zero quadrupole moment . without the full knowledge of magnetic hyperfine field and electric field gradient , it is not feasible at present to delineate the experimentally obtained @xmath77 of 6.63 mj k / mol into the two different contributions .     temperature dependence of magnetic specific heat and entropy ( inset ) associated with gd@xmath9 ordering in rusr@xmath2gdcu@xmath2o@xmath3 . ]    by assuming that its various coefficients in eq .",
    "( 1 ) for eu - compound remain the same for the gd - compound , one can then obtain the magnetic contribution to specific heat associated with antiferromagnetic gd@xmath9 ordering as @xmath86 the results are shown in fig .",
    "7 . using the format of c@xmath87/t versus t. it is of interest to note a broad shoulder below t@xmath88 , a common feature seemingly prevailing in other similar type of compounds such as gdba@xmath2cu@xmath25o@xmath11 , gdba@xmath2cu@xmath66o@xmath3 and tlba@xmath2gdcu@xmath2o@xmath11 . @xcite according to fishman and liu,@xcite it is due to spin fluctuations in the normally ordered state , and such fluctuations are more pronounced for large spins .",
    "indeed , gd@xmath9 has the largest spin among all r@xmath9 ions .",
    "the areal integral in fig .",
    "7 , including that associated with the broad shoulder should yield the magnetic entropy , @xmath89 as shown in the inset , s@xmath87 reaches a saturation value of 17.6 j / mol k around 10 k. considering the built - in approximation in eq .",
    "( 4 ) , it agrees exceptional well with the theoretical value of @xmath10 ln(2j+1 ) = @xmath10 ln8 = 17.2 j / mol k for the complete ordering of gd@xmath9 .",
    "the lower critical field with b@xmath56(0 ) = 7 g and t@xmath6 = 16 k indicates the existence of a spontaneous vortex state ( svs ) between 16 k and t@xmath1 of 36 k. this svs state is closely related to the weak - ferromagnetic order with a net spontaneous magnetic moment of @xmath22 0.1 @xmath58/ru , which generates a weak magnetic dipole field around 8.8 g in the cuo@xmath2 bi - layers .",
    "the vortex melting transition temperature at 21 k obtained from resistivity measurements and the onset of diamagnetic signal indicates a broad vortex liquid region due to the coexistence and interplay between superconductivity and wfm order .",
    "no visible specific heat jump was observed near t@xmath1 for eu- and gd - compound , since the electronic specific heat is easily overshadowed by the large phonon contributions and the expected jump would spread over a wide range of temperature due to vortex melting .",
