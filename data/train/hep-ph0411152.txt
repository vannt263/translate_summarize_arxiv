    "due to the lack of a direct coupling between the @xmath2 boson and the photon in the standard model , the lowest order contribution to the decay @xmath0 occurs at the one - loop level .",
    "the feynman diagrams for this process are identical to those of the crossed channel scattering process @xmath8 , which was studied by gounaris , porfyriadis , and renard @xcite .",
    "the decay @xmath4 , which also takes place at the one - loop level and is usually viewed as a discovery mode for an intermediate mass higgs boson @xcite , dominates the decay process @xmath0 by several orders of magnitude .",
    "however , by imposing kinematic cuts on the photons and @xmath2 boson in the decay @xmath0 , we may exclude contributions of the back - to - back photons .",
    "it is therefore in principle possible to distinguish the photons from @xmath4 decay from those arising from the decay @xmath0 . while admittedly very rare , the decay @xmath0 , among one loop decay processes , is particularly sensitive to top quark couplings .    in the next section",
    ", we discuss the calculations of the decay width , the photon invariant mass decay distribution , and the decay energy distribution of the @xmath2 .",
    "this is followed by a summary and conclusions .",
    "to facilitate our calculations of the amplitudes for the process",
    "@xmath0 , we use a generalized non - linear gauge fixing condition @xcite . in the gauge fixing terms there are several parameters which can be set freely without affecting the values of the measurable quantities .",
    "we set the values of these parameters in such a way as to minimize the number of feynman diagrams contributing to the @xmath0 amplitudes .",
    "in addition , we use the t hooft - feynman gauge , which reduces the propagators for the gauge bosons to a simple form @xmath9 , where @xmath10 and @xmath11 are the momentum and the mass of a gauge boson , respectively .",
    "the resulting feynman diagrams are identical to those of the crossed channel scattering process @xmath8 , which was investigated in the ref .",
    "@xcite for the standard model and its minimal supersymmetric extension .",
    "the generic diagrams are drawn @xcite in the fig.[feyndiag ] .",
    "are shown .",
    "for the charged fermion @xmath12 in the figs.[feyndiag](a ) and [ feyndiag](b ) , we include only the top quark .",
    "however , in the fig.[feyndiag](c ) , the @xmath2 boson exchange , all charged fermions @xmath12 are included in the loop.,width=240 ]    as noted in the ref .",
    "@xcite , due to the charge conjugation properties of the gauge boson couplings there are no @xmath13 bosons in the loops and we need only consider contributions from charged fermion loops . in the box diagram , fig.[feyndiag](a ) , the coupling of the higgs boson to the fermion in the loop is proportional to the fermion mass and we include only the top quark contribution .",
    "the same thing is true in the triangle diagram with the neutral goldstone boson @xmath14 exchange , fig.[feyndiag](b ) , and , again we include only the top quark contribution .    in the @xmath2 boson exchange diagram , fig.[feyndiag](c ) , we encounter an anomalous contribution @xcite , whose cancellation requires the inclusion of all charged fermions of a given generation . after the cancellation of the anomalous contribution , which is independent of the @xmath15 ,",
    "the mass of the charged fermion in the loop , the contribution of this diagram to the dominant helicity amplitudes is proportional to the @xmath16 . as mentioned above , the contributions of fig.[feyndiag](a ) and fig.[feyndiag](b ) to any helicity amplitude is proportional to the @xmath17 @xcite .",
    "we , therefore , could have included only the charged fermions of the third generation in the evaluation of diagram fig.[feyndiag](c ) but chose to include all three generations in this diagram .    for the decay @xmath0 , the helicity amplitudes @xmath18 , where @xmath19 and @xmath20 are the helicities of the photons and",
    "@xmath21 is the helicity of the @xmath2 boson , are not independent .",
    "due to bose symmetry and @xmath22 invariance , there are only four independent helicity amplitudes @xcite , which we choose to be @xmath23 , @xmath24 , @xmath25 , and @xmath26 .",
    "any other helicity amplitude is expressible in terms of these four amplitudes .",
    "for instance , @xmath22 invariance relates @xmath27 to the basic set as @xmath28 our numerical calculation of the amplitudes indicates that , among the four basis amplitudes , the helicity amplitude @xmath23 is by far the largest . as a consequence , we need only consider the amplitudes @xmath23 and @xmath27 .",
    "our calculations were performed in a _ semiautomatic _",
    "method @xcite .",
    "specifically , we used the feynarts package @xcite , to generate the helicity amplitudes in terms of the tensor loop integrals . using the algebraic manipulation program @xcite",
    ", these tensor integrals were converted to the conventions of passarino - veltman @xcite and expressed in terms of scalar integrals .",
    "the scalar integrals were calculated using code written following the approach of t hooft - veltman @xcite and denner - nierste - scharf @xcite . as a partial test of our calculations",
    ", we compared the numerical results of our routines for the scalar integrals with those of the codes @xcite and the @xcite . while these two packages did not give numerically stable results for all regions of the parameter space , where comparisons were possible we obtained essentially identical numerical results for our scalar integrals and those of the and/or .",
    "we also checked the gauge invariance of the helicity amplitudes for each of the final state photons .    to facilitate the discrimination of @xmath0 from @xmath4 and @xmath5 and account for possible experimental limitations",
    ", we imposed a variety of cuts on the following photon and @xmath2 boson variables : @xmath29 , @xmath30 , @xmath31 , @xmath32 , @xmath33 , @xmath34 , @xmath35 , @xmath36 , and @xmath37 . here ,",
    "@xmath38 , @xmath39 , and @xmath40 are the 3-momenta of the photons and the @xmath2 boson , respectively , in the center of mass of the higgs boson and @xmath35 , @xmath36 , and @xmath37 are the various angles between the 3-momenta , @xmath38 , @xmath39 , and @xmath41 .",
    "the invariant mass variables are @xmath42 , @xmath43 , and @xmath44 . here ,",
    "@xmath45 , @xmath46 , and @xmath47 are the 4-momenta of the photons and the @xmath2 boson , respectively .    for our calculations of the decay width @xmath3 , invariant mass distribution @xmath48 , and the @xmath2 boson energy distribution @xmath49",
    ", we choose the following set of cuts : @xmath50 these cuts facilitate the experimental tagging of the photons and the @xmath2 boson .",
    "they provide minimum opening angles between the photons and the @xmath2 boson , exclude contributions of the back - to - back photons , and also avoid any numerical instability in the calculations .",
    "the cuts help discriminate the non - back - to - back photon pairs of the decay @xmath51 from the back - to - back @xmath52 pairs in the decay @xmath53 . in principle , all the photons of the decays @xmath53 , @xmath54 , and @xmath55 can be identified .    in fig.[decaywidth ]",
    ", we show the result of the calculation for the decay width @xmath3 as a function of the higgs boson mass @xmath56 .     for three decay modes of the higgs boson",
    "are shown .",
    "the solid line is @xmath57 , the dashed line is @xmath58 , and the dotdashed line is @xmath59 .",
    "the cuts imposed on @xmath57 are @xmath60 , @xmath61 , and @xmath62.,width=240 ]    for purposes of comparison , in this figure we also include the decay widths @xmath63 and @xmath64 @xcite , which are calculated using the package @xcite . as it is clear from this figure , for the higgs boson masses that we are considering , the decay width @xmath65 is several orders of magnitude smaller than the decay widths @xmath63 and @xmath64 .",
    "for instance , for a higgs boson mass of @xmath6 , the ratios of the decay widths are @xmath66 .",
    "there are no cuts on the decay widths @xmath63 and @xmath64 .",
    "the cuts we imposed , of course , decrease the value of @xmath3 .",
    "in addition , there is the suppression from three - body phase space , and from the higher order in @xmath67 .",
    "however , there are other differences in the amplitudes for these decay modes , which account for their relative sizes . for instance",
    ", in the case of @xmath53 , the decay amplitude receives contributions from charged fermion loops as well as a substantial contribution from @xmath13 boson loops , whereas in the decay @xmath55 , there are no @xmath13 boson loop contributions and the anomalous triangle diagram , fig.[feyndiag](c ) , must be included . as a result of these differences , the simple power counting method for estimating the size of the ratio of the decay widths",
    "@xmath68 is rather unreliable .    in fig.[massdist ]",
    ", we show the invariant mass distribution @xmath48 as function of @xmath69 and in fig.[energydist ] , we show the energy distribution @xmath49 as function of the @xmath2 boson energy @xmath70 .     as function @xmath69 , the invariant mass of the final photons , for higgs masses of @xmath56 = 115 , 125 , 135 , 145 , and 160 gev are shown .",
    "the cuts imposed are the same as those for the total width @xmath3 of the fig.[decaywidth].,width=240 ]    , as function of the @xmath2 boson energy @xmath70 , for the higgs masses of fig.[massdist ] are shown .",
    "the cuts imposed are the same as those for the total width @xmath3 of the fig.[decaywidth].,width=240 ]    to further investigate the effect of cuts on the decay width @xmath3 , in fig.[cut ] we plot @xmath3 as function of @xmath56 , for several different choices of @xmath71 , @xmath72 , and @xmath73 . in the fig.[cut](a ) , all three cut parameters @xmath71 , @xmath72 and @xmath73 are varied simultaneously .",
    "this figure captures the combined effect of all three cuts on the decay width .",
    "the effects of the individual cuts on the decay width are illustrated figs.[cut](b)-(d ) . in fig.[cut](b ) , the invariant mass and angular cuts are held fixed and the 3-momentum cuts are allowed to vary , in fig.[cut](c ) we hold the 3-momentum and the angular cuts fixed and vary the invariant mass cut , and in fig.[cut](d ) the 3-momentum and invariant mass cuts are held fixed and the angular cut is varied . from figs.[cut](b)-(d ) it is clear that the cuts have more effect on the decay width for the low higgs boson mass .",
    "fig.[cut](d ) illustrates that the angular cuts only start to show any noticeable effect on the decay width @xmath74 for @xmath75 .",
    "compared to the one loop decays @xmath4 and @xmath5 , the decay @xmath0 is highly suppressed in the standard model . in one sense this is unfortunate because the physics of this process has some interesting features . among these",
    "are the absence of @xmath13 boson contributions in any of the loops .",
    "the amplitudes are dominated by top quark loops and therefore sensitive to top-@xmath2 couplings .",
    "additionally , there is the presence of an anomalous vertex in the @xmath76-channel @xmath2 exchange diagram , which might be studied were it not for the constraints of yang s theorem @xcite .",
    "because yang s theorem forbids the physical decay @xmath77 , the @xmath76-channel pole cancels in the mass region we consider , @xmath78 .",
    "this , together with the anomaly cancellation , serves to further reduce the decay width .",
    "perhaps the most striking feature of this process is the simplicity of the decay amplitude helicity structure .",
    "although not apparent at the outset , the calculation shows that there are only two helicity amplitudes of any importance , @xmath79 . as a consequence , the photons in @xmath0 always have the same helicity and the @xmath2 is always longitudinally polarized .    in conclusion",
    ", we have found that @xmath57 is very small compared to viable one loop discovery modes of the higgs boson and that the suppression is greater than simple phase space and coupling constant accounting might suggest .",
    "it goes without saying that the detection of the decay mode @xmath0 will be extremely difficult if it occurs at the standard model level and that any signal in this channel is very likely evidence of new physics .",
