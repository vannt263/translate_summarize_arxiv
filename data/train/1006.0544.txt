    "the demand for wireless spectrum is constantly increasing as various wireless communication services have appeared .",
    "correspondingly the available spectrum has become scarce .",
    "current spectrum allocation policies aggravate spectrum scarcity since a particular spectrum is dedicated to only specific users as federal communications commission ( fcc ) reported @xcite . as a solution to improve the spectrum efficiency , _ cognitive radio _ ( cr ) has emerged , where secondary ( unlicensed ) users try to access the spectrum without interfering with communications of primary users .",
    "the term cr is classified into several techniques depending on the way to access the spectrum licensed to the primary users : _ overlaid _ , _ underlaid _ , and _ interweaved _ cr systems @xcite .",
    "our work focus on interweaved cr system where the secondary users are allowed to access the spectrum licensed to primary users only when primary users do not occupy the spectrum .",
    "this approach comes from the idea of _ opportunistic communication _ @xcite .",
    "secondary users monitor whether the spectrum is occupied by primary users in order to opportunistically communicate over vacant spectrum without interfering with primary users .",
    "stable throughput of an interweaved cr system was analyzed by reflecting random packet arrival of a primary user using queueing process in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "srinivasa and jafar @xcite studied the optimum number of secondary users that maximizes the total throughput in a decentralized cr system .",
    "secondary user scheduling and medium access control play key roles in cr systems but they have not been well studied yet . it has been well known that opportunistic user selection for transmission provides a multiuser diversity gain due to fluctuations of fading channels @xcite . for non - cr systems ,",
    "there have been many studies on characterizing the multiuser diversity gains @xcite .",
    "these studies showed that the multiuser diversity gain in terms of average capacity grows like @xmath0 and @xmath1 in rayleigh fading channels and lognormal shadowing channels , respectively , where @xmath2 is the number of users .",
    "the multiuser diversity gain of a secondary network in an underlaid cr system was recently discussed in @xcite .",
    "it was shown that the average capacity of the secondary network scales like @xmath0 and @xmath3 under the finite and the infinite peak transmit power constraints at the secondary transmitters , respectively . moreover ,",
    "the scaling laws of underlaid cr system in a cognitive ad hoc network was studied in @xcite although it did not focus on the multiuser diversity gain coming from opportunistic user selection . despite the fact that the term cr typically refers to interweaved cr systems ,",
    "however , the multiuser diversity gain in interweaved cr systems has not been identified .    in this paper",
    ", we investigate characteristics of multiuser diversity gains in interweaved cr systems by deriving average achievable capacity of a secondary network .",
    "multiuser scheduling and transmit power control are employed in a secondary network to maximize the achievable capacity of a secondary user network and to satisfy a quality of service ( qos ) constraint of a primary user network . unlike underlaid cr systems , secondary users are not allowed to access the spectrum licensed to primary users when a secondary network detects primary users transmission .",
    "so our analysis reflects both traffic dynamics of a primary user network and sensing reliability in a secondary network .",
    "furthermore , this paper takes into account the interference from a primary transmitter contrary to @xcite .",
    "our asymptotic analysis and numerical results insightfully capture the key characteristics of multiuser diversity gains in interweaved cr systems .",
    "it is shown that multiuser diversity gains in interweaved cr systems are quite different from those in non - cr based systems due to the qos constraint on a primary user network . moreover , even if the secondary users of interweaved and underlaid cr systems have different ways to access the spectrum licensed to primary users , the multiuser diversity gains of both cr systems show very similar asymptotic characteristics .",
    "the system model considered in this paper is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : system_model ] , which consists of a primary receiver ( primary base station ) , a primary transmitter , a secondary receiver ( secondary base station ) , and @xmath2 secondary transmitters which try to access the spectrum licensed to a primary transmitter .",
    "the additive thermal noise is assumed to be zero mean mutually independent , circularly symmetric , complex gaussian random variable with unit variance .",
    "the channel gains from the @xmath4th secondary transmitter to the primary receiver and to the secondary receiver are denoted by @xmath5 and @xmath6 , respectively . similarly , @xmath7 and @xmath8 are the channel gains from the primary transmitter to the primary receiver and to the secondary receiver , respectively .",
    "all channel gains are assumed to be independent and identically distributed ( i.i.d . )",
    "exponential random variable with unit mean in rayleigh flat fading channels .",
    "it is also assumed that the @xmath4th secondary transmitter knows the instantaneous channel state information of @xmath5 and @xmath6 and knows the statistical channel information of @xmath7 and @xmath8 .",
    "the secondary transmitters are able to obtain the instantaneous channel state information of @xmath5 and @xmath6 through a periodic sensing of pilot signal from the primary and secondary receivers , according to the channel reciprocity . in our system model ,",
    "all the secondary transmitters which have packets to transmit compute the maximum allowable transmit power @xmath9 based on @xmath5 to maximize their throughput while ensuring the qos of primary users",
    ". then , the secondary transmitters report their 1-bit sensing results with calculated transmit power @xmath9 .",
    "the secondary receiver fuses received sensing results from the secondary transmitters and makes a global decision .",
    "the reliability of cooperative sensing is captured by detection probability @xmath10 and false alarm probability @xmath11 . however , detailed discussion about how to fuse the received sensing results and how to reflect the performance of cooperative sensing are beyond the scope of this paper . if the global decision declares the absence of primary users traffic in the spectrum , the secondary receiver selects the secondary transmitter which has the largest signal - to - noise power ratio ( snr ) @xmath12 to maximize secondary network throughput .",
    "otherwise , all secondary transmitters are silent during a unit time slot . on the other hand",
    ", a primary transmitter transmits its packets with its maximum power , @xmath13 .",
    "we consider a _ packet - by - packet _ access network where the spectrum licensed to the primary users is accessed in a time slotted manner similarly in @xcite .",
    "in other words , all primary and secondary transmitters can transmit one packet per each time slot .",
    "the traffic at the primary transmitter is modeled by a bernoulli process with average packet arrival rate , @xmath14 [ packets / slot ] , and departure rate , @xmath15 [ packets / slot ] .",
    "note that the departure rate can be interpreted as the probability of successful packet transmission during a time slot ; moreover , it can directly be translated into average throughput of a primary user .",
    "in contrast to arrival rate @xmath16 , departure rate @xmath17 is significantly affected by the behavior of the secondary network .",
    "so the primary user sets a minimum tolerable departure rate @xmath18 to guarantee a certain service rate for the case of missed detection in the secondary network by @xmath19 it should be noted that the departure rate without any interference is greater than the arrival rate for an essentially stable primary user s queue .",
    "the outage probabilities when there is no interference and when there is interference from the secondary network are given , respectively , by @xmath20\\label{p_outage1 } \\\\ p_{out}^{inf } & = \\pr\\left[\\log_2\\left(1+\\frac{\\alpha_pp_p}{1+\\alpha_{s , i}p_{s , i}}\\right)<r\\right ] , \\label{p_outage2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath21 is the required rate at the primary receiver .",
    "then , the departure rate of the primary transmitter is given by @xmath22 from a perspective of a primary user , a minimum departure rate , @xmath18 , needs to be set as a oos parameter and is notified to the secondary network so that interference from a secondary network is regulated to guarantee the minimum departure rate .",
    "based on the channel information including the instantaneous value of @xmath5 and the statistical properties of @xmath23 , each secondary transmitter can estimate the corresponding outage probabilities of the primary user , when it is scheduled .",

    "hereinafter , we use @xmath28 instead of @xmath17 to represent the departure rate as a function of @xmath5 and @xmath9 .",
    "the transmit power of the @xmath4th secondary transmitter is determined by the value making @xmath28 equal to @xmath18 since @xmath28 is inversely proportional to @xmath9 .",

    "a secondary transmitter can transmit a packet with adaptively adjusted power based on the value of @xmath5 .",
    "our analysis focuses on the last two cases where the spectrum licensed to primary user is opportunistically accessed . hence , from ( [ p_mu ] ) , it is assumed that @xmath34 where a positive real constant @xmath35 is pre - determined by the system parameters .",
    "based on the computed @xmath9 in ( [ p_si ] ) , all the secondary transmitters report their 1-bit sensing results with its transmit power , @xmath9 . using the collected sensing results ,",
    "the secondary receiver checks the availability of the spectrum licensed to the primary network .",
    "if the spectrum is decided to be vacant , the secondary receiver selects the @xmath36th secondary transmitter whose snr is the largest among @xmath2 secondary transmitters such as @xmath37where the received snr @xmath38 from the @xmath4th secondary transmitter is given by @xmath39",
    "unfortunately , analyzing the average capacity of secondary network is not easy to handle because extracting the pdfs of @xmath40 and @xmath41from that of @xmath42 is intractable . instead ,",
    "to see the exact scaling law of multiuser diversity gain , this section provides lower and upper bounds on the asymptotic average achievable capacity of the secondary network and derives the scaling law of the average achievable capacity of the secondary network from the two bounds .      to give the independency between @xmath5 and @xmath6 in the selection of a secondary transmitter , scheduling procedure is divided into two stages . in the first stage",
    ", the secondary receiver determines a set @xmath43 consisting of the candidates for transmission which have low enough @xmath5 so that the calculated @xmath44 , and hence the transmit power is saturated with @xmath45 . in the second stage , if the set @xmath43 is not empty , the @xmath46 secondary transmitter which has the largest @xmath6 among the elements of @xmath43 is finally scheduled with its maximum allowable transmit power @xmath45 .",
