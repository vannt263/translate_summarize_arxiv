    "some results can be achieved , but the additional complications would only obscure the presentation of the results .    the main strategy of proof is the natural one : we use brown s formula which computes the farrell  tate cohomology with @xmath6-coefficients of @xmath2 in terms of the elementary abelian @xmath7-subgroups and their normalizers .",
    "the main piece of information for the above theorem is then the classification of conjugacy classes of finite subgroups of @xmath2 , which  under the conditions ( r1 ) or ( r2 )  is directly related to number - theoretic questions about ( relative ) class groups and unit groups of @xmath1-integers in @xmath4 and its cyclotomic extension .",

    "quillen s conjecture for @xmath2 is true for farrell  tate cohomology with @xmath50-coefficients for all @xmath4 and @xmath1 .",

    "this result sheds light on the quillen conjecture , showing that the quillen conjecture holds in a number of rank one cases ; it also sheds light on the relation between quillen s conjecture and detection questions in group cohomology , where detection refers to injectivity of the restriction map to diagonal matrices .",
    "see @xcite for a more detailed discussion of these issues .",
    "it is also worthwhile pointing out that the failure of detection as in the previous theorem , i.e. , the non - injectivity of the restriction map @xmath51 implies the failure of the unstable quillen - lichtenbaum conjecture as formulated in @xcite .",
    "this follows from the work of dwyer and friedlander @xcite .",
    "other examples of the failure of detection in function fields situations in a higher rank case are discussed in @xcite .",

    "therefore , this is an example of a finite tale morphism for which it is not possible to define a transfer in the usual k - theoretic sense .",
    "finally , we want to note that the precise description of farrell  tate cohomology and the relevant restriction maps allows to consider the colimit of the groups @xmath30 , where @xmath1 runs through the finite sets of places of @xmath4 . using this ,",

    "results similar to the ones in the present paper can be obtained for higher rank groups , although there are more and more complications coming from the classification of finite subgroups . away from the order of the weyl group , the subgroup classification is easier .",
