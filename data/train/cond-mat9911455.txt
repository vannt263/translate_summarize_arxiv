    "the kaplan  yorke ( ky ) or lyapunov dimension was introduced@xmath0 as a conjecture relating the hausdorff ( h ) dimension and the lyapunov exponents of the invariant measure of a given dynamical system .",
    "this allows a computation of the h  dimension of the attractor of a dissipative dynamical system in terms of its lyapunov exponents .",
    "its validity has been proven for two dimensional dynamical systems@xcite and for a rather large class of stochastic systems.@xcite in general one only knows that the ky ",
    "dimension is an upper bound for the h ",
    "dimension.@xcite although it is not hard to construct rather artificial counter examples , it is generally believed that the conjecture holds for `` generic '' dynamical systems.@xcite    in this paper we will discuss a relation ( see eq .",
    "( [ main ] ) below ) between the ky  dimension in large thermostatted systems and their physical properties such as the transport coefficients in a nonequilibrium stationary state .",
    "such a relation allows us to estimate the ky  dimension from a measurement of the transport coefficient . in doing",
    "so we obtain a new relation between a dynamical quantity ( the ky  dimension ) and a physical quantity ( the transport coefficient ) .",
    "a difficulty in doing this is that while the dynamical quantities are usually defined for any finite number of particles @xmath1 , the physical quantities usually refer to systems of very large @xmath1 , so that one can meaningfully define intensive quantities , which only depend on intrinsic parameters like the number density @xmath2 rather than on @xmath1 and @xmath3 separately , where @xmath3 is the volume of the system .",
    "we would like to state this by saying that strictly speaking , a thermodynamic limit has to be taken , @xmath4 , @xmath5 with the number density ( @xmath6 ) and other intensive quantities , such as in particular the shear rate , considered in this paper , held constant .",
    "this is straightforward if the linear transport coefficients are required and the limit of the external field @xmath7 is taken before the limit @xmath8 , as in linear response theory .",
    "however , for finite fields , changes in the behavior of the system can occur , when the thermodynamic limit is approached - as e.g. the onset of turbulence in a sheared system.@xcite in this paper we are interested only in the behavior of systems before such a transition takes place , like the laminar flow of a sheared fluid considered in section 5 .",
    "we think , nevertheless , that our results can be usefully formulated for large systems using expressions like `` for sufficiently large @xmath1 '' without taking the mathematical limit ( see comment after eq .",
    "( [ sumlyapnc ] ) for a more precise discussion ) .",
    "although this expression is not mathematically well defined , we think that its meaning will be clear in any practical application ( see note 7 on page 14 for an attempt to clarify this point ) . moreover , because errors in intensive quantities are typically @xmath9 where @xmath10 , the approach is physically reasonable .",
    "the above mentioned connection between a dynamical and thermodynamic treatment requires the usually discrete lyapunov spectrum to be effectively replaced by a continuous intensive spectrum and an intrinsic version of the ky  dimension to be introduced . in section 4",
    "we show how this can be implemented , after having introduced the basic equations which connect the dynamical and physical quantities in section 2 , and deriving a new exact relation for the linear transport coefficients in section 3 .",
    "as has been shown before,@xcite there is a direct relationship between the sum of the non - zero lyapunov exponents @xmath11 with @xmath12 , @xmath13 ( where @xmath1 is the number of particles , @xmath14 the cartesian dimension and @xmath15 the number of zero lyapunov exponents ) and the phase space contraction rate in a thermostatted system , subject to an external force @xmath16 , in a non equilibrium stationary state , of the form :    @xmath17    here the subscript @xmath1 indicates the @xmath1-dependence of the various quantities in eq .",

    "( [ sumlyap ] ) :    @xmath22    here @xmath23 , @xmath24 and @xmath25 are the entropy production rate per unit volume , the dissipative flux and the transport coefficient respectively , induced in the system in the stationary state by the external force @xmath16 , where a nonlinear constitutive relation @xmath26 has been used .",
    "the subscript @xmath1 indicates the @xmath1-dependence for finite systems .",
    "the kinetic temperature @xmath27 is determined by the relation :    @xmath28    where @xmath29 is the particle mass , @xmath30 are the peculiar momenta and @xmath27 is the kinetic temperature .    for systems at equilibrium the thermodynamic temperature appearing in eq .",

    "although this condition on the constant @xmath34 is not mathematically precisely defined , we discuss in section 5 numerical experiments , which will give an indication of the magnitude of the @xmath9 corrections in the relationship between the ky  dimension and the viscosity . in what follows when we write @xmath9",
    ", we will always intend it to carry the particular meaning given by the above discussion .",

    "this confirms that the coefficients of the @xmath9 and @xmath158 terms are small for this system .",
    "we mention here a few implications of the results presented in this paper .    *",
    "the extensivity of the phase space reduction for large @xmath1 and small fields is here , to the best of our knowledge , demonstrated for the first time , on the basis of the smoothness hypothesis of the lyapunov spectrum and the extensivity of the total entropy production . * the relationships given by eqs .",
    "( [ tran ] ) , ( [ ky_e ] ) and ( [ sllod2 ] ) also apply to systems where not all particles are thermostatted .",
    "that is , they can be applied to systems where the gaussian thermostat operates on selected particles , say those in the boundaries , while the remaining particles evolve under newtonian dynamics , supplemented by a dissipative field.@xcite we note that the eqs .",
    "( [ cpr2 ] ) , ( [ cpr3 ] ) , ( [ sllod3 ] ) and ( [ sllod4 ] ) can only be assumed to apply to homogeneously thermostatted systems in general , since only for such systems can the wcpr be expected to hold . * a simple calculation shows that for a typical case as that of one mole of argon at its triple point , sheared at the rate of 1 hz , the difference of the kaplan - yorke dimension and the phase space dimension @xmath180 is tiny , namely @xmath181 .",
    "this follows from eq.(3.3 ) , which shows that the dimension loss , when measured in moles , is equal to the product of the total entropy production rate of the system and the reciprocal of the largest lyapunov exponent . since the largest lyapunov exponent is controlled by the most unstable atomic processes , it is always very small @xmath182 1 ps@xmath132 whether for atomic , molecular and even polymeric systems .",
    "+ we note that this smallness of the phase space dimension reduction in irreversible processes near equilibrium could well be the reason that linear irreversible thermodynamics provides such a good description of nonequilibrium systems close to equilibrium .",
    "this is because the thermodynamic properties are insensitive to the high order distribution functions - including the full n - particle distribution function of the entire system - since they are determined by a few low order distribution functions , which `` do not know '' that the dimension of the steady state attractor is only a few dimensions smaller than the @xmath183 of the phase space of the system .",
    "* for the system studied , the @xmath9 corrections to @xmath184 that appear in eqs .",
    "( [ sllod2 ] ) , ( [ sllod3 ] ) and ( [ sllod4 ] ) , due to the smoothness hypothesis are small ( see figure 5 ) and less than @xmath185 even for system sizes of @xmath186 . * in conclusion , although the new relations involving @xmath39 are simple consequences of the eq .",
    "( [ main ] ) , they could nevertheless be useful for applications .",
    "in particular the equations give a simple expression for the kaplan ",
    "yorke dimension of the attractor of a class of many particle systems close to equilibrium in the regime of linear dissipation near equilibrium .",
