    "this paper addresses a specific class of nucleus - nucleus collisions , where a large `` spectator system '' survives .",
    "such specific reactions give the opportunity to investigate the interplay between phenomena occurring in the participant and spectator zones .",
    "in particular , this is the case for our study which concerns the interplay between the strong and electromagnetic forces in such reactions .",
    "this can be used as a new source of information on the collision dynamics .     of positive and negative pions produced in ( a ) peripheral pb+pb and ( b ) pb+gas collisions , drawn as a function of pion transverse momentum at fixed values of @xmath0 ( listed from the top to the bottom distribution ) .",
    "note : for clarity , the subsequent distributions are multiplied by ( a ) @xmath1 , @xmath2 , @xmath3 , @xmath4 , @xmath5 , @xmath6 , @xmath7 , @xmath8 , @xmath9 , and by ( b ) @xmath1 , @xmath2 , @xmath3 , @xmath4 , @xmath5 , @xmath10 .",

    "all the studies summarized in this paper were inspired by experimental observations made in the sps energy regime ( beam energy of 158 gev / nucleon , @xmath11  gev ) .",
    "these were coming from two data sets , both collected by the na49 experiment  @xcite .",
    "the first was a sample of peripheral pb+pb reactions , defined by a cut of 150 - 300 charged particles measured by the na49 detector  @xcite .",
    "this corresponded to an average number of 54@xmath1211 participating nucleons and a mean impact parameter of 10.9@xmath120.5 fm  @xcite .",
    "the second data set was a sample of `` pb+gas '' events , i.e. collisions of the pb beam projectiles with nuclei of gas surrounding the na49 target  @xcite .",
    "these collisions ( mostly pb+n , pb+o ) were experimentally isolated by means of proper interaction vertex cuts , together with the same cut on measured multiplicity as given above  @xcite .",
    "it is therefore expected that the corresponding mean number of participating nucleons was roughly comparable to that in peripheral pb+pb reactions .",
    "the double differential spectra of positively and negatively charged pions produced in both reaction samples are shown in fig .",
    "[ ptspectra ] .",
    "they are drawn as a function of transverse momentum @xmath13 at fixed values of the feynman variable @xmath14 .",
    "figs  [ piratios](a ) and  [ piratios](b ) show the ratios of positively over negatively charged pions produced in peripheral pb+pb and pb+gas collisions , respectively .",
    "the similarity of the evolution of the ratios with @xmath0 and @xmath13 in the two collision types is evident . in both cases",
    ", the @xmath15 ratio displays a steep , rapidly varying structure , with a deep minimum at low transverse momenta where it comes below 0.2 .",
    "account taken of the comparable number of protons and neutrons participating in both reactions ( 40% over 60% for the pb nucleus ) , such a low value of this ratio breaks isospin symmetry .",
    "this demonstrates that the strong interaction can not be the sole responsible for this effect .",
    "the position of the minimum ( @xmath16 ) corresponds to pions moving longitudinally with spectator velocity .",
    "indeed , the effect is caused by the _",
    "electromagnetic interaction between charged pions and the spectator system_. the repulsion of positive pions results in the depopulation of the region @xmath17 , low @xmath13 , while the attraction of negative pions causes their accumulation in the same region of phase space ( see also fig .",
    "[ ptspectra ] ) .     ratio in peripheral pb+pb reactions , ( b ) the same ratio in pb+gas collisions , ( c ) model simulation as described in the text , ( d ) schematic illustration of the model .",
    "the data in panel ( b ) come from  @xcite .",
    "other panels come from  @xcite.,width=472 ]    in order to quantify this hypothesis , we constructed an intentionally simplified model of the peripheral pb+pb collision , taking the spectator - induced electromagnetic interaction into account  @xcite .",
    "this is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ piratios](d ) .",
    "the two spectator systems are modeled as two lorentz - contracted , uniformly charged spheres .",
    "charged pions are emitted from a single point in space ( the interaction point ) .",
    "the time of pion emission @xmath18 is a free parameter of the model , defining the initial conditions for the electromagnetic interaction .",
    "initial spectra of pions are assumed to be equal to these in the mixture of nucleon - nucleon ( @xmath19+@xmath19 , @xmath20+@xmath19 , @xmath19+@xmath20 , @xmath20+@xmath20 ) collisions .",
    "they are constructed on the basis of na49 @xmath19+@xmath19 data  @xcite .",
    "proper account is taken of isospin symmetry and of the proton / neutron ratio in the pb nucleus ( 40%/60% ) ; details of this procedure can be found in  @xcite .",
    "charged pions are then numerically propagated in the electromagnetic field of the spectators .",
    "relativistic effects such as retardation are taken into account .    as it can be seen in fig .",
    "[ piratios](c ) , the model gives a fair description of the main features of the peripheral pb+pb data , fig .",
    "[ piratios](a ) .",
    "it is to be noted that the simulation presented here assumes a mixed set of initial conditions with 50% of events generated with @xmath21  fm / c and the remaining 50% generated with @xmath22  fm / c .",
    "this means that the pion formation site is placed `` behind '' the nearest spectator system as discussed in  @xcite .",
    "the only region where a more significant disagreement between data and model can be seen is @xmath23 , low @xmath13 .",
    "this has been identified as resulting from the _ fragmentation ( break - up ) of the spectator system _ , and yielding in fact independent information on the space - time evolution of this process  @xcite .",
    "ratio in peripheral pb+pb reactions ( a , b ) , intermediate p+pb collisions  ( c ) and central p+pb collisions ( d ) .",
    "note that the simulation of pb+pb reactions extends further in @xmath13 relative to our earlier work  @xcite.,width=472 ]",
    "account taken of the success of our model in describing the basic features of the experimental data , we decide that it may be applied with some confidence to investigate the electromagnetic distortion of @xmath15 ratios in the full range of @xmath0 .",
    "the results of our simulations and @xmath24 spectra , resulting from the excess of neutrons in the pb nucleus ( these differences were taken into account in the previous section ) .",
    "this implies that any deviation of the @xmath15 ratio from unity will solely be due to electromagnetic effects . ]",
    "are shown in fig .",
    "[ fullxf ] . as apparent in fig .",
    "[ fullxf](a ) , the two - dimensional electromagnetic distortion seen in the data in section  [ three ] is in fact part of a larger structure , consisting of two symmetric `` holes '' in the @xmath15 ratio , accompanied by a possible rise at higher absolute @xmath0 .",
    "it is interesting to note that the region of sensitivity to the electromagnetic effect extends , at high @xmath0 , to relatively large transverse momenta , up to and above @xmath25  gev / c .",
    "comparison with fig .",
    "[ fullxf](b ) demonstrates the sensitivity of the spectator - induced electromagnetic distortion to the pion emission time @xmath18 .",
    "this shows the important ability of the electromagnetic effect to constrain possible scenarios and to provide new information on the space - time evolution of the process of pion production , see also  @xcite .    finally ,",
    "the electromagnetic effect in intermediate and central p+pb reactions is shown in figs  [ fullxf](c ) and [ fullxf](d ) . with the trivial exception of the `` one - hole '' structure imposed by the presence of a single spectator nucleus , the similarity to peripheral pb+pb collisions , fig .",
    "[ fullxf](a ) , is evident .",
    "little dependence on pure geometry ( centrality ) of the p+pb collision is apparent in the figure .",
    "this gives a relatively well defined situation for using the electromagnetic interaction as source of information on pion production and on its interplay with nuclear fragmentation , also in p+a collisions .",
    "the spectator - induced electromagnetic effect discussed in this paper influences a number of observables in various types of nuclear collisions ( p+a , pb+gas , pb+pb , etc ) .",
    "the well - defined nature of the electromagnetic interaction makes it a convenient tool to provide independent information on the space - time evolution of the reaction .",
    "however , only a few phenomena have been addressed here .",
    "other examples can be quoted . among these ,",
    "the electromagnetic effect induced on kaon spectra  @xcite , on azimuthal anisotropies ( directed flow ) , its possible presence in `` ultra - peripheral '' pb+pb collisions  @xcite , and many others are presently under active investigation . + this work was supported by the polish national science centre ( on the basis of decision no .",
