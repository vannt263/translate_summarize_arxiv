    "binary millisecond pulsars ( bmsps ) consist of a millisecond radio pulsar and a white dwarf ( wd ) .",
    "their observed orbital and stellar parameters are fossils of binary stars evolution .",
    "thus bmsps can be used as important probes to test stellar astrophysics and binary evolutionary theory . according to the nature of the wd companions ,",
    "bmsps were divided into two groups : low - mass binary pulsars ( lmbps ) and intermediate - mass binary pulsars ( imbps ) . nowadays , it is generally accepted that most lmbps are evolved from neutron star ( ns ) low - mass x - ray binaries ( lmxbs ) . by roche - lobe overflow of the progenitor of the wd",
    ", ns can be spun up to a millisecond period via the accretion of material and angular momentum from the donor star @xcite . at the same time",
    ", the mass accretion induces the ns magnetic fields decrease to about @xmath1 g @xcite .",
    "the final evolutionary endpoints are lmbps consisting of a millisecond pulsar and a low - mass ( less than 0.4@xmath0 ) he wd ( see bhattacharya & van den heuvel 1991 ; tauris & savonije 1999 ; podsiadlowski et al . 2002 ; tauris & van den heuvel 2006 ) .    comparing with lmbps , imbps consist of a massive ( greater than 0.4@xmath0 ) co or onemg wd and a mildly recycled pulsar ( camilo et al .",
    "1996 , 2001 ; edwards & bailes 2001a ) , in which the spin periods and magnetic field strengths are considerably greater than those of lmbps @xcite .",
    "furthermore , imbps tend to have a relatively short orbital - period ( less than 40 d ) and a relatively large orbital eccentricity .",
    "these properties imply that there exist different progenitor systems and evolutionary histories between imbps and lmbps . the co wds can evolve from normal intermediate - mass hydrogen - rich stars on asymptotic giant branch by burning hydrogen and helium shells around the co core @xcite .",
    "therefore , it is generally agreed that imxbs can evolve into imbps . due to the large mass ratio ( more than 1.5 ) of imxbs",
    ", the mass transfer was thought to be unstable , and lead to a common envelope evolution @xcite . with the spiral - in of the ns in the envelope of the donor star",
    ", it will be mildly recycled by a short timescale super - eddington accretion @xcite . however",
    ", a ns may collapse into a black hole during hypercritical accretion in the common envelope phase @xcite .",
    "subsequently , it was discovered that , except for the donor stars with a deeply convective envelope , imxbs with a donor star of 2  6 @xmath2 can avoid a spiral - in stage and evolve into imbps by rapid mass transfer on a thermal timescale @xcite .",
    "based on the isotropic re - emission model , @xcite found that imxbs can evolve into imbps with relatively long orbital period ( @xmath3 3 - 50 d ) .",
    "recently , the population - synthesis calculation also shows that it is difficult to form bmsps with @xmath4 d by the standard binary star evolution @xcite .    at present , there exist 9 compact imbps with an orbital period of less than 3 d. therefore , it is very interesting for the stellar evolutionary theory to account for the origin of these compact imbps . these systems could be explained if the ns survives a phase of common envelope ( ce ) evolution with an intermediate - mass donor star .",
    "the post - ce system consists of a ns and a he star ( the naked core of the donor star ) .",
    "because he stars with a mass less than 2 @xmath0 can evolve into co wds by burning their helium shell @xcite , ns + he star binaries can form most of the observed imbps by case bb mass transfer from naked he stars @xcite .",
    "it is worth noting that ns + he star binaries have an ultra - short orbital periods in the range of 0.01  1.0 d due to common envelope evolution @xcite .",
    "recently , chen & liu ( 2013 ) have investigated the initial parameter space ( he star masses and initial orbital periods ) of he star + ns binaries that can form imbps .",
    "their simulated results show that the ns + he star evolutionary channel can explain the formation of 4  5 short orbital period imbps .",
    "the discrepancies between the simulation and the observations may originate from the accretion model of the ns and the magnetic braking scenario , which should be improved .",
    "the aim of this work is to investigate whether the imxbs evolutionary channel can form compact imbps without evolving through a ce - phase .",
    "the majority of intermediate - mass stars ( more than 1.5@xmath0 ) with radiative envelopes are not thought to experience magnetic braking .",
    "however , about 5% of a / b type stars possess anomalously strong magnetic fields ( about 100  10000 g ) , and they are called ap / bp stars ( see also landstreet 1982 ; moss 1989 ; shorlin et al . 2002 ; braithwaite & spruit 2004 ) .",
    "@xcite found that magnetic braking scenarios of ap / bp stars can account for the formation of compact black hole x - ray binaries with short orbital periods of less than 1 d.    unfortunately , the operation process of magnetic dynamo in the early - type stars with a radiative envelope is still unclear ( derviolu et al .",
    "2010 ) . in this work , solar - like magnetic braking concepts",
    "are simply applied to intermediate - mass stars with an anomalous magnetic field .",
    "we apply this anomalous magnetic braking model to the evolution of imxbs , and test whether imxbs can provide an alternative evolutionary channel to compact imbps .",
    "this paper is structured as follows . in section 2",
    ", we will give a detailed description for the binary evolution calculation of imxbs .",
    "the calculated results are presented in section 3 .",
    "finally , we give a brief summary and discussion in section 4 .",
    "based on an updated version of the stellar evolution code originally developed by eggleton ( 1971,1972,1973 ; see also han et al .",
    "1994 ; pols et al . 1995 ) , we attempt to simulate the evolutionary sequences of imxbs consisting of a ns ( of mass @xmath5 ) and an ap / bp donor star ( of mass @xmath6 ) . the ap / bp donor star is assumed to be a solar chemical composition ( @xmath7 ) , the ratio of the mixing length to the pressure scale height and the convective overshooting parameter are set to be 2.0 and 0 @xcite .",
    "the stellar opal opacity table is taken from @xcite , rogers & iglesias ( 1992 ) , and alexander & ferguson ( 1994 ) .",
    "we stop the calculation when the system evolves into a detached binary , and the donor star evolves into a wd .",
    "the mechanisms driving the mass transfer in imxbs should be the loss of orbital angular momentum via gravitational wave radiation and/or magnetic braking ( for narrow systems with initial orbital period of 1  2 d ) , and the nuclear evolution of the donor star ( for relatively wide systems with initial orbital periods of greater than 1  2 d ) . in our calculation",
    ", we considered three kinds of angular momentum loss as follows .",
    "\\1 . gravitational wave radiation .",
    "this angular momentum loss rate is given by @xcite @xmath8 where @xmath9 and @xmath10 are the gravitational constant and the speed of light in vacuum , respectively .",
    "@xmath11 is the total mass of the binary , and @xmath12 is the binary separation .",
    "\\2 . mass loss . for imxbs ,",
    "once the donor star overflows its roche lobe , thermal timescale mass transfer is triggered because the material is transferred from the more massive donor star to the less massive ns .",
    "the mass transfer rate @xmath13 may be greater than the eddington accretion rate of the ns , in which @xmath14 for h - rich accreted material .",
    "therefore , the mass - loss rate of the system can be written as *",
    "@xmath15*. for the angular momentum loss accompanying the mass loss , we assume an isotropic re - emission scenario @xcite , in which the excess material is ejected in the vicinity of the ns , and carries away the specific orbital angular momentum of the ns .",
    "the orbital angular momentum loss rate by the isotropic re - emission is given by @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the orbital angular velocity of the binary system , @xmath18 is the fraction of material lost from the donor star which is re - emitted from the ns @xcite .",
    "magnetic braking of ap / bp stars .",
    "the interaction between the magnetic field of a donor star and its stellar winds can extract the spin angular momentum @xcite.similarly to @xcite , we assume that the stellar wind is bound in the magnetic field lines to co - rotate with the stars out to the magnetospheric radius ( @xmath19 )",
    ". however , the tidal interaction between two components would accelerate the donor star to co - rotate with the orbital motion , and indirectly remove the orbital angular momentum from the binary .",
    "therefore , the loss rate of angular momentum by magnetic braking is @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the stellar wind - loss rate ; @xmath22 , and @xmath23 denote the surface magnetic field , and the radius of the ap / bp star , respectively .",
    "actually , ap / bp stars in main sequence stage are not observed to have spun down because of weak winds .",
    "however , in a close binary system x - rays generated by accretion on to the ns can drive a strong stellar wind from the ap / bp star @xcite .",
    "therefore , the anomalous magnetic braking of ap / bp star provides an efficient mechanism extracting angular momentum from the x - ray binaries . to obtain the the stellar wind - loss rate , we assume that a fraction of the x - ray luminosity of the ns is converted into the kinetic energy of a wind of the donor star .",
    "i. e. @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the geometric factor of the x - ray flux intercepted by the donor star , and @xmath26 is the wind driving energy efficiency factor ( justham et al .",
    "the x - ray luminosity of the accreting ns can be written as @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the accretion rate of the ns . by equations ( 3 ) , ( 4 ) , ( 5 ) , and kepler s third law , we obtain ( see also equation ( 15 ) in justham et al .",
    "2006 ) @xmath29 where @xmath30 is a synthetic parameter .",
    "since @xmath31 , the calculated results are more sensitive to @xmath32 than to @xmath33 .",
    "therefore , we only consider the influence of magnetic field on the calculated results . similarly to @xcite , we take @xmath34 , @xmath35 , so @xmath36 . the angular momentum loss rate was found to decrease when the donor star becomes completely convective @xcite . therefore , in the stellar code we stop the magnetic braking mechanism when the donor star mass is less than @xmath37 , at * the * point where the star enters the fully convective stage .      in the stellar evolution code , we also take into account the evolution of the spin and the surface magnetic field ( @xmath38 ) of nss . for the spin evolution",
    ", the ns is assumed to experience three evolutionary stages comprising an accretion phase , a propeller phase , and a radio phase ( see also section 2.3 of liu & chen 2011 and table 1 of chen & liu 2013 ) .",
    "in addition , there also exists a spin - down torque originating from the magnetic coupling between the magnetic field of the spinning ns and the outer region of the accretion disc @xcite . considering the accretion torque , the propeller torque , and the spin - down torque caused by the interaction between the magnetic field and the accretion disc , the total torque exerted on the ns can be written as @xcite    @xmath39 ,   \\\\ ( \\omega\\leq1 ) \\\\ \\\\",

    ", we take a moderate value @xmath42 = 0.5 , and a constant moment of inertia @xmath43 .",
    "the fastness parameter @xmath44 , where @xmath45 is the angular velocity of the ns , @xmath46 is the ( keplerian ) angular velocity at the magnetosphere radius .    for the magnetic field evolution , we simply take a phenomenological form of magnetic field decay due to the accretion given by @xcite .",
    "i. e. @xmath47 where @xmath48 and @xmath49 are the initial magnetic field and the accreted mass of the ns , respectively .    in our calculation",
    ", we assume that the ns has passed through the death line before it was recycled .",
    "observations show that the critical voltage ( generated above the polar cap of the pulsar ) line satisfies @xmath50 ( @xmath51 is the pulse period , rawley et al .",
    "1986 ) , and a theoretical study also presented a similar estimate by @xcite .",
    "in addition , the pulse periods of known radio pulsars are in the range of 1.4 ms  11 s @xcite .",
    "the final spin period of the ns during the recycled process is insensitive to its initial spin period and magnetic field @xcite .",
    "therefore , we take an initial spin period of 10 s , a typical magnetic field of @xmath52 g , and a canonical initial ns mass of 1.4 @xmath0 .",
    "and the initial orbital periods @xmath53 of imxbs that can evolve into binary pulsars by the anomalous magnetic braking of ap / bp stars when @xmath54 = 1000 g. the filled circles and open circles represent the imbps , and lmbps , respectively .",
    "the crosses correspond to imxbs that experience dynamically unstable mass transfer and common envelope evolution .",
    "the filled triangles denote systems where the mass transfer persists after a hubble time.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]    fig .",
    "1 summarizes our simulated results by showing the evolutionary fate of imxbs in the initial ap / bp star masses vs. the initial orbital periods diagram .",
    "it is seen that , if the initial orbital period in the range of 2  4 d , imxbs with a relatively low - mass ( @xmath55 ) ap / bp stars can evolve into lmbps with a he wd . while for relatively high - mass ap / bp stars with a mass of @xmath56 , imxbs can form imbps with a co wd if the initial orbital period is in the range of 2  6 d , depending on the donor star mass .",
    "if the donor star is in a close binary ( @xmath57 less than 1 d ) , during the roche - lobe overflow the orbital separation continuously decreases because the material is transferred from the more massive donor star on to the less massive ns .",
    "the shrinking roche - lobe causes the donor star to overfill its roche - lobe even more , unstable mass transfer commences and the system experiences common envelope evolution ( tauris et al . 2000 ) .",
    "similarly , if the initial orbital period is more than 7 d , long timescale nuclear evolution of the donor star before the mass transfer causes the formation of a deep convective envelope .",
    "subsequently , a runaway material transfer is triggered , giving rise to the spiral - in of the ns and common envelope evolution .",
    "the anomalous magnetic braking mechanism is very efficient in removing angular momentum from binaries . employing the magnetic braking , imxbs with a short orbital period ( @xmath58 d ) evolve into relatively compact x - ray binaries until the donor star mass is less than @xmath59 .",
    "subsequently , gravitational radiation causes the continuous shrinking of * the * roche lobe , and triggers a new mass - transfer episode .",
    "therefore , in these systems the mass transfer persists after a hubble time ( see the filled triangles in fig .",
    "1 ) . finally , the donor star can not evolve into wd , but remains with a semi - degenerate he core .",
    "it is worth noting that , considering anomalous magnetic braking in our work , the initial parameter space that can form binary pulsars is smaller than found in previous works ( tauris et al .",
    "2000 ; shao & li 2012 ) .    in order to illustrate the influence of the magnetic field on the orbital period of imbps , in fig .",
    "2 we present the correlation between the final orbital period @xmath60 and the surface magnetic field @xmath32 of ap / bp stars with different masses when the initial orbital period of imxbs @xmath61 = 2.0 d. for the same donor star , the simulated results of four different magnetic field including 0 , 200 , 1000 , and 3000 g are shown .",

    "in this paper , we aim at a peculiar binary pulsar problem , namely the evolutionary origin of compact imbps with an orbital period of less than 3 d. considering an anomalous magnetic braking model of ap / bp stars proposed by @xcite , we have performed evolutionary calculations of ns + ap / bp star binaries consisting a @xmath82 ns and a 2.0  4.0 @xmath0 ap / bp star companion , and have tested whether this evolutionary channel can produce compact imbps .",

    "\\1 . assuming the surface magnetic fields of ap / bp stars are 1000 g , imxbs with a 2.6  3.8 @xmath0 donor star and an orbital period of 2.0  6.0 d can evolve into imbps . beyond this initial parameter space ,",

    "\\2 . about @xmath83 of our simulated imbps",
    "have an orbital period less than 3d .",
    "therefore , we propose that imxbs including ap / bp stars with a relatively strong magnetic field are potential progenitors of compact imbps , especially in case a ns can not survive the spiral - in during a ce .    \\3 . the efficiency of magnetic braking plays a vital role for the orbital period of imbps . if ap / bp stars have a weak magnetic field of 200 g , such an evolutionary channel leads to the formation of imbps with a relatively long orbital period of 3  8 d. however , for a strong magnetic field of more than 1000 g , compact imbps with an orbital period of less than 1 d can be formed .",
    "when @xmath84 g , anomalous magnetic braking scenario only gives rise to the formation of imbps with a short spin - period of less than 20 ms , which is obviously lower than the observed period of most imbps .",
    "there may be two cases to address this discrepancy . in the first case , the ns accretion model in our calculation should be improved . in the second case ,",
    "there exist other evolutionary channels to form imbps with a relatively long spin - period ( see also tauris et al . 2012 ; chen & liu 2013 ; lazarus et al .",
    "it is very interesting that anomalous magnetic braking scenarios can form imbps with an orbital period of more than 0.6 d and a spin period of less than 10 ms , which can not be produced by the ns + he star evolutionary channel ( see also fig . 4 of chen & liu 2013 ) .",

    "first , for initial input parameters we adopt a canonical ns mass of 1.4@xmath0 . however , both theoretical studies ( see also nomoto 1984 ) and observations ( e. g. kiziltan et al . 2010 ; zhang et al . 2011 ) argue that the initial masses of nss have a large range distribution .",
    "recently , two groups suggested that the peculiar imbp psr j16142230 could have evolved from an imxb with a heavy ns ( about @xmath85 , lin et al .",
    "2011 ; tauris et al .",
    "subsequently , @xcite found that the initial parameter space ( in the initial orbital period vs. the initial donor star mass diagram ) forming binary pulsars expands when the ns mass increases .",
    "secondly , we simply take a constant magnetic field strength ( @xmath84 g ) .",
    "actually , ap / bp stars may have a large distribution range of 100  10000 g in the surface magnetic field ( moss 1989 ; braithwaite & spruit 2004 ) .",
    "this would significantly influence the evolutionary fate of imxbs .",
    "thirdly , for the x - ray irradiation - driven stellar wind process by the mass accretion , in this calculation we take a constant synthetic parameter @xmath33 like @xcite .",
    "however , this parameter may change from one system to another .",
    "fourthly , the prescription for magnetic braking is highly uncertain .",
    "fifthly , the magnetic field decay equation of the ns due to accretion needs to be improved .",
    "a potential caveat of the work presented here is if the tidal forces can keep the spin of the donor star synchronized with the orbital motion .",
    "magnetic braking of a star extracting orbital angular momentum is based on the significant tidal interaction between the orbit and the star .",
    "studying the spin evolution of the accreting algol - type binaries , derviolu et al .",
    "( 2010 ) found tidal interaction between the components and the orbit is too weak to efficiently remove spin angular momentum from the accreting component .",
    "the weak energy dissipation for stars with radiative envelopes should be responsible for this weak tide .",
    "therefore , magnetic braking of ap / bp stars need an efficient energy dissipation mechanism that is stronger than gravity wave dissipation ( zahn 2005 ) .",
    "in addition , at the end of the mass - transfer phase the donor star has a relatively thin envelope . it is unclear if the tidal forces are still efficient for a thin envelope .",

    "<S> it is difficult for the intermediate - mass x - ray binaries ( imxbs ) evolutionary channel to form intermediate - mass binary pulsars ( imbps ) with a short orbital period ( less than 3 d ) via stable mass transfer . </S>",
    "<S> the main reason is that the magnetic braking mechanisms are generally thought not to work for donor stars with a mass of greater than 1.5 @xmath0 in the canonical model . </S>",
    "<S> however , some intermediate - mass stars have anomalously strong magnetic fields ( about 100  10000 g ) , i. e. so - called ap or bp stars . with the coupling between the magnetic field and the irradiation - driven wind from the surface of ap / bp stars </S>",
    "<S> , a plausible magnetic braking mechanism should be expected . in this work , </S>",
    "<S> we attempt to investigate if imxbs with ap / bp stars can produce imbps with a short orbital period ( less than 3 d ) by such an anomalous magnetic braking mechanism . using a stellar evolution code , </S>",
    "<S> we have simulated the evolution of a large number of imxbs consisting of a ns and an ap / bp star . for the spin evolution of the ns </S>",
    "<S> , we consider the accretion torque , the propeller torque , and the spin - down torque caused by the interaction between the magnetic field and the accretion disc . </S>",
    "<S> the calculated results show that , employing anomalous magnetic braking of ap / bp stars , imxbs can evolve into compact imbps with short orbital periods of less than 3 d. however , there exists significant discrepancy between the spin periods of imbps in our simulated results and those observed .    </S>",
