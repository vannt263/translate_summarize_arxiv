    "the geometric mean of these widths is which is consistent with the expectation from angular strip    the total radiation length of all chambers used in the test beam setup is about @xmath414% which causes multiple scattering of the 32 gev beam particles on the order of @xmath4147 @xmath1rad rms of the multiple scattering angle .",

    "we are currently setting up a monte carlo simulation of the full tracking setup including material budgets of all chambers to correct for multiple scattering .",
    "we expect that the corrected result for the resolution will be somewhat better than the above preliminary results .",
    "the motivation for implementing this correction for the barycentric method is to further improve the spatial resolution of the ge1/1 detector . in this study ,",

    "consequently , all hv scan data were combined before implementing the strip correction for more statistics .",
    "however , the strip correction was performed individually on each sector for the position scan .",
    "21 shows resolutions before and after correction .",
    "since the readout of the ge1/1 has a fine strip segmentation , the overall improvement factor is small ( less than 8% , i.e. within @xmath4 10 @xmath1rad ) compared to detectors having coarser readout strips @xcite .",

    "it shows good charge uniformity for all @xmath2-sectors except for sectors 6 and 7 .",
    "the uniformity should be improved in future assemblies by making sure that all the foils have the same tension in all eight sectors .",
