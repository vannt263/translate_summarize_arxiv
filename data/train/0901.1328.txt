    "star formation frequently takes place in high concentrations of massive stars at intense levels , a phenomenon referred to as `` starbursts . ''",
    "the massive stars in a starburst can inject energies into the interstellar medium ( ism ) to photoionize the ambient medium and to dynamically sweep up the medium into expanding shells .",
    "the expanding shells can trigger subsequent star formation either by compressing ambient dense clouds or by collect - and - collapse within the shell @xcite .",
    "starbursts can easily spread over areas 10@xmath2 - 10@xmath3 pc across , and play a vital role in determining the large - scale structures of their host galaxies .",
    "while starbursts are the most prominent features in a galaxy , their detailed properties can not be easily studied : in distant galaxies the stellar content is not resolved and in the milky way the distances and association among stars in a starburst are uncertain . the large and small magellanic clouds ( lmc & smc ; mcs ) are the only galaxies in which stars are at common , known distances and can be individually resolved down to @xmath41 @xmath5 at optical wavelengths @xcite .",

    "observations in the mid - infrared ( mid - ir ) enabled the detection of individual young stellar objects ( ysos ) in the mcs , revealing the on - going star formation @xcite .",
    "it is now possible to use the resolved stellar population to map out star formation as a function of space and time in the mcs .",
    "as the ism of the mcs has been surveyed in great detail , it is further possible to determine the relationship between star formation and the physical properties of the ism .",
    "consequently , studies of starbursts in the mcs allow us to investigate fundamental issues about star formation , such as whether and how the stellar energy feedback from massive stars triggers the formation of next - generation stars , whether the initial mass function ( imf ) depends on the interstellar conditions for star formation , and whether massive stars are formed only under specific conditions @xcite .",
    "we have chosen the  complex lh@xmath6 120-n44 ( n44 ; * ? ? ?",

    "n44 contains three ob associations , lh47 , 48 , and 49 @xcite , that are in different evolutionary stages and interstellar structures : lh47 in the central superbubble , lh48 in one contiguous   region at the northeast rim of the superbubble , and lh49 in a group of  regions to the southeast exterior of the superbubble ( figures .",

    "daofind ` does not always identify the same sources at the same locations in the four irac bands .",
    "therefore , we identified sources in each of the four irac bands and merged the four source lists into a master source list using 12 (= 1 pixel ) as the criterion for coincidence .",
    "the resulting master list is then used for photometric measurements in all four bands .",
    "the photometric measurements were made with a source aperture of 36 ( 3-pixels ) radius and an annular background aperture at radii of 3684 ( 37 pixels ) .",
    "finally , an aperture correction was applied , and the fluxes were converted into magnitudes using the correction factors and zero - magnitude fluxes provided in the irac data handbook and listed in table  [ photpar ] .    the photometric measurements from long- and short - exposure irac observations were averaged with weights proportional to the inverse square of their errors . for sources that were saturated in the long exposures , their measurements from the short exposures were adopted . the results were used to produce a photometric catalog of 17,002 irac sources in the @xmath16 field of n44 .",

    "note that the aperture corrections adopted for 70 and 160 @xmath8 m  measurements are those for sources of temperatures 15 and 10 k , respectively . for sources of higher temperatures , such as 10003000 k",
    ", the adopted aperture corrections will result in fluxes 8% too high in 70 @xmath8 m   and 2% too high in 160 @xmath8 m  because the source emission peaks at shorter wavelengths ; however , these errors do not significantly affect the analysis and conclusions of our study of ysos .",
    "in the 160 @xmath8 m  image , only one point source can be clearly identified ; therefore , the 160 @xmath8 m  photometry will be discussed in the text but not included in the photometric catalog .",

    "ysos have seds that differ from stars because they are shrouded in dust , which absorbs the stellar radiation and irradiates at ir wavelengths ; therefore , it is possible to identify ysos from their ir excesses .",
    "it is , however , difficult to decipher the ir excess of massive ysos because the distribution of their circumstellar dust is not well known . as",
    "their formation mechanism is still uncertain ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "* ) , it is not even known whether massive ysos ubiquitously possess accretion disks ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "we will use the commonly accepted physical structure and evolution of low - mass ysos as a starting point to decipher the seds of higher - mass ysos .",
    "low - mass ysos are believed to be initially surrounded by a small accretion disk and a large infalling envelope with bipolar cavities , and as they evolve , the envelope and disk dissipate .",
    "different evolutionary stages result in different seds that have been used to classify low - mass ysos , i.e. , the class i / ii / iii system @xcite . in this classification system , a class i yso has a compact accretion disk and a large infalling envelope with bipolar cavities ; its sed is dominated by emission from the envelope and rises longward of 2 @xmath8 m .",

    "a class iii yso has cleared most of the disk so its sed shows stellar photospheric emission with little or no excess in near - ir .",
    "these geometries of dust disk and envelope applicable to low - mass ysos have been adopted in radiative transfer models of high - mass ysos by a number of investigators ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "* ) . in their models , at an early evolutionary stage",
    ", a yso has a small disk and a large envelope with narrow bipolar conical cavities ; its sed is dominated by the envelope emission and shows a generally rising trend from the shortest detectable wavelength to beyond 24 @xmath8 m . at an intermediate evolutionary stage , the opening angle of the bipolar cavity increases and",
    "the star and disk may be exposed ; the yso s sed thus shows double peaks : one below 1 @xmath8 m  ( stellar emission ) with its intensity dependent on the viewing angle , and the other rising longward of 1 @xmath8 m  but turning flat or falling shortward of 1020 @xmath8 m . at a late evolutionary stage",
    "when most of the envelope and disk have been dispersed , the sed shows a bright stellar emission with a modest mid - ir excess .",
    "these models provide useful links between circumstellar dust structures and seds ; thus , we will use the general trends of the seds to identify yso candidates in n44 .      owing to their excess ir emission",
    ", ysos are positioned in redder parts of the color - color and color - magnitude diagrams ( cmds ) than normal stars",
    ". however , background galaxies and asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) stars can also be red sources , and these contaminants exist in non - negligible numbers . to separate ysos from these contaminants ,",
    "we have examined several color - color diagrams and cmds with solely irac bands as well as combinations of irac with @xmath36 or mips bands @xcite .",
    "we find that for many sources the 2mass catalog is too shallow to detect their counterparts in @xmath36 , and the mips observations can not resolve them from nearby sources or bright diffuse background . to include most of the sources , we decide to concentrate on diagnostic diagrams using only the irac bands .",
    "the irac [ 3.6]@xmath37[4.5 ] vs.  [ 4.5]@xmath37[8.0 ] color - color diagram has been suggested by @xcite and the [ 8.0 ] vs.  [ 4.5]@xmath37[8.0 ] cmd has been suggested by @xcite to offer the best separation of ysos from contaminants .",
    "we have adopted the latter approach for the initial selection of massive ysos because galaxies and evolved stars have different distributions in brightness and can be effectively excluded using simple criteria .",

    "we discuss the criteria used to exclude these contaminating sources from the high - mass yso candidates .",

    "we first use known objects in the field of n44 . using the simbad database ,",
    "we have found 10 confirmed agb stars at various evolutionary stages , such as carbon stars , m - type variables , ir carbon stars , and oh / ir stars .",

    "warm interstellar dust may show seds similar to those of circumstellar dust in ysos . as the angular resolution of irac images is @xmath55 , corresponding to 0.5 pc for a lmc distance of 50 kpc ,",
    "some small dust clumps may be identified as point sources and included in the yso candidate list .",
    "owing to our conservative compilation of master source list for irac photometry (  2.1 ) , a star projected near a dust clump may also make its way into our yso candidate list .",
    "to identify these two types of yso imposters , we use the ispi @xmath56 images that have higher angular resolution . in the ispi @xmath18 images , stars or ysos appear unresolved , while dust clumps may appear as extended emission .",
    "the @xmath57 color further differentiates between stars and ysos , as stars are brighter in @xmath17 and ysos brighter in @xmath18 .",
    "aided by the ispi images , we find that 23 of our 99 yso candidates are interstellar dust clumps , and another 12 are stars projected near dust clumps .      the results of our examination of 99 yso candidates are given in table  [ ysoclass ] , which lists source name , ranking of the brightness at 8 @xmath8 m , magnitudes in the @xmath27 , @xmath31 , @xmath32 , @xmath33 , @xmath17 , @xmath34 , @xmath18 , 3.6 , 4.5 , 5.8 , 8.0 , 24 , and 70 @xmath8 m  bands , source classification , and remarks .",
    "note that some of the ysos appear as single sources in irac images but are resolved into multiple sources in ispi and mosaic images ; for these sources , the photometric measurements in table  [ ysoclass ] were made for the dominant yso sources and these entries are remarked in column `` flag '' .    after excluding background galaxies , evolved / agb stars , and dust clump imposters , 60 yso candidates remain .",
    "as these are most likely bona fide ysos , we will simply call them ysos in the rest of the paper .",

    "@xcite used the same _ spitzer _ data of n44 and similar selection criteria , but identified only 49 ysos .",
    "this is understandable because their automated search for point sources was unable to find faint sources near a bright neighbor or over a bright background .",
    "such faint sources can be found and measured more easily with human intervention , as we did in this paper for the small area of n44 only .",
    "the comparison with the yso sample of @xcite is not as straightforward because they used a very complex set of criteria . within the area of n44",

    ", we further compare our sources with their original catalog , i.e. , the sage point source catalog ( kindly provided by remy indebetouw and marta sewilo ) . we find that the missed ysos do not result from different selection criteria , but from defining point sources and applying signal - to - noise ( s / n ) thresholds when making final lists in these two studies . for a survey of the entire lmc ,",
    "the sage catalog used stringent parameters for the automated search for point sources and whitney et al .  applied a high s / n threshold .",

    "the latter tends to exclude sources near bright neighbors or over bright background , as shown in fig .",

    "the seds of these six sources are shown in figure  [ sage_comp]c . with the addition of optical fluxes in the seds ,",
    "it can be more clearly seen that at least yso candidate w546 is likely an evolved star with circumstellar dust and that w530 and w574 may be background galaxies .    we conclude that our sample of massive ysos in n44 is the most complete among the three compared",
    "as mentioned earlier , there is not yet a well - defined classification system for massive ysos . in robitaille",
    "et al.s ( 2006 ) study of yso models , they suggested a physical classification scheme for ysos of all masses .",
    "this classification is analogous to the class scheme for low - mass ysos , but uses physical quantities , instead of the slope of the sed , to define the evolutionary stage of the models .",
    "the three stages are defined by the ratio of envelope accretion rate ( @xmath59 ) to central stellar mass ( @xmath60 ) and the ratio of disk mass ( @xmath61 ) to @xmath60 : stage i sources have @xmath62  yr@xmath10 , stage ii sources have @xmath63  yr@xmath10 and @xmath64 , and stage iii sources have @xmath63  yr@xmath10 and @xmath65 .",
    "these physical quantities are not directly observable ; they have to be inferred from model fits to the observed seds .",
    "this classification scheme , while physical , is model - dependent and the comparison with observations requires data taken with sufficient angular resolutions to separate among individual sources and from backgrounds , which is not always the case for lmc objects .",
    "thus , it is not an appropriate description of observed properties of ysos .",
    "here we suggest an empirical classification of the observed seds of massive ysos , and use a `` type '' nomenclature for distinction from the `` classes '' for low - mass ysos and the `` stages '' for model ysos . in our scheme :    * * type i * has an sed rising steeply from near - ir to 24 @xmath8 m  and beyond , indicating that the radiation is predominantly from a circumstellar envelope .",
    "examined in images , a type i yso is not visible at optical or even in the @xmath17 band , but emerges in the @xmath18 band and continuously brightens up all the way to 24 and 70 @xmath8 m .",
    "type i ysos are usually in or behind dark clouds ; an example is given in figure  [ fig : ysoimg]a , where the yso s optical and ir images , sed , and location in the [ 8.0 ] vs.  ( [ 4.5]@xmath37[8.0 ] ) cmd are shown .",
    "* * type ii * shows an sed with a low peak at optical wavelengths and a high peak at 824 @xmath8 m , corresponding respectively to the central source and the inner circumstellar material ( e.g. , a disk ) and indicating that the envelope has dissipated . in images",
    ", a type ii yso would appear faint at optical , brighten up from @xmath17 to 8 @xmath8 m , and appear faint again at 24 @xmath8 m .",
    "an example of a type ii yso is given in fig .",
    "[ fig : ysoimg]b . *",
    "* type iii * shows an sed with bright optical stellar emission and modest dust emission at near- and mid - ir , indicating that the young star is largely exposed but still surrounded by remnant circumstellar material . in direct images ,",
    "a type iii yso is bright at optical , but fades toward longer wavelengths .",
    "it may even be surrounded by an  region ; as described later in  7.3 , one of the type iii ysos has an _ hst _ h@xmath6   image available and it shows a compact  region .",
    "an example of a type iii yso is given in fig .",
    "[ fig : ysoimg]c .    as our classification",
    "is based on mainly the seds and as the observed sed of a somewhat evolved yso with bipolar cavities is dependent on its viewing angle , an unknown fraction of our type i ysos may have the same physical structure of the type ii ysos but viewed outside the cavity .",
    "moreover , not all ysos can be classified unambiguously into these three types as some ysos may be transitional between two evolutionary stages .",
    "a number of sources show seds resembling two adjacent types ; for these we simply classify them as i / ii or ii / iii .",
    "additional complications arise because of the limited angular resolution of _ spitzer _ and complex surroundings of ysos .",
    "first , irac s @xmath55 angular resolution translates into 0.5 pc in the lmc , which can hide a small group of ysos .",
    "indeed , 20 of the ysos are resolved by our mosaic or ispi images into multiple sources or even small clusters within the irac psf , and another 19 ysos appear more extended than the psf of mosaic and ispi . while the ispi @xmath56 images allow us to identify the dominant yso among the multiple sources for accurate photometric measurements , the irac measurements correspond to the integrated light of all sources , causing uncertainty in the classification , especially when two or more ysos are present within the irac psf .",
    "[ fig : ysoimg]d shows an example of a yso resolved into multiple sources in mosaic and ispi images .",
    "second , ysos are often found in dark clouds and dust columns .",
    "these interstellar features can be identified in the optical images as dark patches against dense stellar background or photoionized bright - rimmed dust pillars .",
    "the emission from these dust features can be blended with that of the ysos , especially at the 24 @xmath8 m  band , causing large uncertainties in the yso classification .",
    "[ fig : ysoimg]e shows an example of a yso at the tip of a dust column in n44f .",
    "our classification of the 60 ysos and remarks on their multiplicity and association with dark cloud and dust column are given in table  [ ysoclass ] .",
    "although for multiple systems the irac and mips fluxes are contaminated by other sources , these fluxes are most likely dominated by the most massive ( and hence the brightest ) yso since the luminosity of a yso is proportional to its mass cubed @xcite .",
    "thus , for a yso that appears single or is clearly the dominant source within the irac psf , its sed can be modeled to assess its physical properties , as discussed in the next section .",
    "the observed sed of a yso can be compared with model seds , and the best - fit models selected by the @xmath66 statistics can be used to infer the probable ranges of physical parameters for the yso .",
    "this can be carried out with the fitting tool online sed model fitter @xcite .",
    "the database of this fitting tool includes model seds pre - calculated for 20,000 yso models each with 10 different viewing angles .",
    "a typical yso model assumes a stellar core , a flared accretion disk , and a rotationally flattened infalling envelope with bipolar conical cavities . to fully describe this complex structure , each model",
    "is defined by 14 parameters @xcite .",
    "the stellar parameters include the star s mass ( @xmath60 ) , radius ( @xmath67 ) , and temperature ( @xmath68 ) ; these are sets of parameters at different ages ( @xmath69 ) along the pre - main - sequence stellar evolutionary tracks modeled by @xcite and @xcite . for a given set of @xmath60 , @xmath67 , and @xmath68 , the stellar radiation determined from stellar atmosphere models of @xcite or @xcite",
    "is adopted and fed to the radiative transfer code to produce the yso s model sed .",
    "the disk parameters include the disk s accretion rate ( @xmath70 ) , mass ( @xmath71 ) , inner radius ( @xmath72 ) , outer radius ( @xmath73 ) , scale height factor ( @xmath74 ) , and flaring angle ( @xmath75 ) .",
    "the envelope parameters include envelope accretion rate ( @xmath59 ) , envelope outer radius ( @xmath76 ) , cavity density ( @xmath77 ) , cavity opening angle ( @xmath78 ) , and the ambient density ( @xmath79 ) at which the density of the envelope reaches the lowest value as the density of the ambient ism .",
    "outside of the envelope is the foreground extinction ( @xmath80 ) .",
    "the 20,000 yso models are generated to sample each of the disk and envelope parameters and the ambient density for a variety of pre - main - sequence stellar model @xcite .",
    "we have used the above sed fitting tool to analyze 36 ysos in our sample that appear single or are clearly the dominant source within the irac psf .",
    "the input parameters of the sed model fitter include the fluxes of a yso and uncertainties of the fluxes .",
    "the uncertainty of a flux has two origins : the measurement itself and the absolute flux calibration .",
    "the fluxes and their measurement errors are given in table  [ ysoclass ] .",
    "the calibration errors are 5% in @xmath27 , 3% in @xmath31 , @xmath32 , 10% in @xmath33 , @xmath17 , @xmath18 , 3.6 , 4.5 , 5.8 , 8.0 , and 24 @xmath8 m , and 20% in 70 @xmath8 m   ( chen 2007 ; gruendl & chu 2008 ; irac data handbook ; mips data handbook ) .",
    "the total uncertainty of a flux is thus the quadratic sum of the measurement error and the calibration error .",

    "the possible ranges of stellar mass and evolutionary stage are also given in table  [ sedfits ] .",
    "the sed fits of the 36 ysos , as displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig : fit ] , show different degrees of goodness - of - fit among our empirically defined yso types .",
    "the seven type i and i / ii ysos have model seds agree well with the observed seds , although the best and acceptable models span a large mass range .",
    "the 21 type ii and ii / iii ysos show good agreement between model and observed seds , except at 4.5 @xmath8 m , where the observed fluxes are systematically lower than the modeled .",
    "this discrepancy will be discussed below in  6.2.1 . among the eight type iii ysos analyzed ,",
    "only three of them show good agreement in the sed fits , while the other five exhibit significant discrepancies between model and observed seds .",
    "these discrepancies and possible causes will be discussed in  6.2.2 .",
    "a great majority of our type ii and iii ysos show a brightness dip at 4.5 @xmath8 m  in their seds ( fig .",
    "[ fig : fit ] ) .",
    "this dip is not an absorption feature as it appears .",
    "instead , it is caused by pah emission features at 3.3 , 6.2 , 7.7 , and 8.6 @xmath8 m  in the other three irac bands @xcite .",
    "the emission mechanism of these features is ultraviolet ( uv ) excitation of pahs followed by ir fluorescence @xcite ; thus these emission features have been observed in regions with uv radiation and dust , such as disks around herbig ae / be stars ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and photodissociation regions ( pdrs ) surrounding  regions ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "our type ii and iii ysos have similar physical conditions , and the resultant pah emission cause the apparent dip at 4.5 @xmath8 m  in the seds .",
    "the pah emission of the ysos is unlikely to originate from a large - scale , diffuse interstellar structure , e.g. , a superbubble rim , since the contamination from such interstellar emission is minimized by background subtraction in the photometric measurement .",
    "furthermore , there is a correlation between pah emission and our yso types : pah emission is not observed in type i , appears in some of the type i / ii ysos , and is almost ubiquitous in type ii and iii ysos .",
    "this correlation argues against the large - scale interstellar origin .",
    "therefore , the pah emission in our ysos is most likely of a circumstellar origin , such as a disk or a compact  region , or both . a type",
    "i yso is deeply embedded in a massive envelope , of which only the dust continuum is observable , and thus no pah emission is expected . a type ii yso may show prominent pah emission from the disk , if viewed through its bipolar cavities .",
    "a type iii massive yso will ionize its surrounding gas and show pah emission from its pdrs . while the seds reveal signatures of pah emission , the geometry of the emitting region ( whether a disk or a pdr of an  region ) can not be determined without more detailed spectral information .",
    "the seds of massive ysos show evidence of pah emission , but the sed models of @xcite do not include pahs or small grains .",
    "this fundamental difference causes the dust continuum determined from sed fitting to be biased by the three irac bands that contain pah emission .",
    "consequently , the observed 4.5 @xmath8 m  fluxes are below the model fits .",
    "moreover , the error in the best - fit continuum level is propagated to the disk parameters , which are predominantly determined from the fluxes in the irac bands .",
    "thus , sed model fits for ysos with pah emission may have large errors in the viewing angle or disk mass .",
    "these errors may be further propagated into the simultaneously fitted envelope and stellar parameters , but the effects are unlikely to be large because the stellar and envelope parameters are determined mainly by the sed at optical and mid - ir wavelengths , respectively .      among the eight type iii ysos ,",
    "five show significant discrepancies between the best - fit models and the observed seds : 052129.7@xmath37675106.9 , 052315.1@xmath37680017.0 , 052157.0@xmath37675700.1 , 052159.6@xmath37675721.7 , and 052340.6@xmath37680528.5 ( fig .",

    "the brightest object , 052129.7@xmath37675106.9 , is peculiar and will be discussed later in  7.2 .",
    "the other four ysos show deep v- or u - shape seds with the flex point in the irac bands , where the best - fit model fluxes are much higher than the observed fluxes , exhibiting the most prominent discrepancies .    to understand these discrepancies",
    ", we can divide the sed of a yso into three segments , optical / near - ir ( @xmath85 ) , near / mid - ir ( irac bands ) , and mid / far - ir ( mips bands and beyond ) , and look into the dominant origin of emission for each segment . at the shortest wavelengths , the optical / near - ir segment ,",
    "the radiation is dominated by stellar photospheric emission ; for example , figure  [ fig : sfit ] shows the optical / near - ir segment of the seds of four type iii ysos can be well fitted by stellar atmosphere models @xcite . at longer wavelengths , the stellar emission diminishes and dust emission rises .",
    "the near / mid - ir segment consists of emission from pahs and warm dust , while the mid / far - ir segment consists of emission mostly from colder dust .",
    "qualitatively , warm dust that emits at near / mid - ir wavelengths needs to be near the star in order to reach the required emitting temperatures ; therefore , the near / mid - ir segment of a yso s sed is dominated by disk emission .",
    "colder dust that emits at mid / far - ir wavelengths is farther away from the star , and thus the mid / far - ir segment of a yso s sed is dominated by envelope emission .",
    "the aforementioned discrepancies between observations and best - fit models of seds of type iii ysos in the irac bands suggest that the ysos do not have as much disk emission as in the models .",
    "below we analyze the seds quantitatively to understand their physical implications .",
    "the mid- to far - ir parts of the v- or u - shaped seds of these type iii ysos ( fig .",
    "[ fig : fit ] ) suggest that the dust continuum peaks at @xmath5824 @xmath8 m .",
    "the corresponding blackbody temperature of the dust is thus @xmath46120 k. the distance of such dust temperature to the central star can be estimated if the stellar spectral type and the implied stellar effective temperature are known . among these",
    "four ysos , 052157.0@xmath37675700.1 , 052159.6@xmath37675721.7 , and 052340.6@xmath37680528.5 have been spectroscopically classified as o8.5v@xmath86neb , o7.5v@xmath86neb , and b[e ] stars , respectively @xcite , and 052315.1@xmath37680017.0 has @xmath87 , @xmath88 , and @xmath89 ( table  [ ysoclass ] ) that are consistent with the colors and magnitudes of a b0-o5 v star @xcite reddened by @xmath90 . for a dust temperature of 120 k and an albedo of 0.5 , the closest distance of such dust to a b0 v star with a stellar effective temperature of 30,000 k is 860 au ; this distance is larger for stars with higher effective temperatures .",
    "this result implies a low dust content , or a hole , within the central @xmath41000 au .    while our assessment of the observed seds suggests @xmath72 @xmath91 860 au , no models with @xmath72 @xmath91 100 au are available in the database of pre - calculated seds for model fitting @xcite . to illustrate how @xmath72 affects the seds ,",
    "we have used the @xcite radiative transfer code to calculate seds for a yso model with stellar parameters appropriate for the observed spectral types but with customized disk parameters . the yso model # 3019532",
    "is chosen because its @xmath92 34718 k and @xmath93 5.628 @xmath94 are representative of late - type o stars . in this stage",

    "we have calculated two seds with disk radii of 501000 au and 10002000 au , respectively ; these model seds are overplotted on the observed sed of 052157.0@xmath37675700.1 in figure  [ fig : fit_hole ] .",
    "the model sed with @xmath72 = 50 au show prominent excess emission in the near / mid - ir bands , while the model sed with @xmath72 = 1000 au adequately reproduce the v - shaped sed without excess near / mid - ir emission .",
    "this comparison suggests that dust has been cleared out to nearly 1000 au .",
    "this clearing of dust is consistent with the expectation from ysos at late evolutionary stages .",
    "we thus conclude that the large discrepancies between the best - fit models and the observed seds are caused by the absence of appropriate model seds in the database of the online sed model fitter .",
    "similar v - shaped seds have been observed in herbig ae / be stars rcw34 and ty cra , and the sed modeling suggested an analogous evolutionary stage @xcite .",
    "similar near - ir dips have also been observed in seds of the low - mass ysos dm tau and gm aur ; these dips have been interpreted as the clearing of dust from the inner regions of their disks @xcite .",
    "we use our analysis of 36 ysos to compare our empirical classification , type , with the theoretical classification , stage @xcite . for each yso ,",
    "the @xmath83 and @xmath95 ratios from the best - fit and acceptable models are used to determine its stages , and the possible range of stage is listed in table  [ sedfits ] under the column `` stage range '' . at first glance , there does not seem to be any systematic correspondence between types and stages .",
    "the lack of overwhelming correspondence may be attributed to three reasons .",
    "first , the definitions of stages are somewhat arbitrary , and it is not even known whether the stages can be universally applied to ysos of all masses . furthermore , a stage ii yso viewed along directions near the disk plane will mimic a stage i yso in the sed , causing ambiguity .",
    "second , the 24 @xmath8 m  fluxes are vital in constraining the model fits , but they are the most uncertain measurements , especially for the faint ysos .",
    "for example , the uncertain 24 @xmath8 m  fluxes of type i ysos 052216.9@xmath37680403.6 and 052211.9@xmath37675818.1 cause their model fits to be ill constrained ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : fit ] ) .",
    "third , the limited angular resolution of _ spitzer _ may cause inclusion of extraneous dust emission from unresolved  regions .",
    "this is particularly relevant to ysos at late evolutionary stages .",
    "for example , the type iii yso 052207.3@xmath37675819.9 , as shown in  7.3 , has a small  region that is resolved only in _ hst _",
    "wfpc2 images ; without these wfpc2 images , circumstellar disk or envelope would have been invoked to explain the yso s far - ir emission .",
    "still , we expect the extreme stage i and iii ysos to correspond to our type i and iii , respectively , since these extreme types are either deeply embedded in massive envelopes or have little circumstellar material so that their seds are less dependent on the viewing angles . examined",
    "closely , it can be seen that type i ysos with good flux measurements at 24 @xmath8 m  are indeed well fitted by models at stage i , and type iii ysos without unresolved  regions indeed correspond to stage iii , if they have good 24 @xmath8 m  flux measurements and the model fits do not have near / mid - ir excesses ( see  6.2.2 ) . in summary , we conclude that meaningful comparisons between types and stages can be made only if good mid / far - ir flux measurements and high angular resolution images are available .",

    "the southern molecular peak shows one bright  region and several smaller , disjoint  regions .",
    "the massive stars of these  regions have not been studied spectroscopically , but the absence of shell structures produced by fast stellar winds and supernovae implies that massive stars are most likely also @xmath45-myr old or that star formation has started only in the last few myr .",
    "the northern molecular peak has a couple small  regions , indicating that only modest massive star formation has taken place .",
    "[ fig : yso_pos ] shows that almost all of the ysos in n44 are found in molecular clouds and about 75% of the ysos are congregated toward the three molecular peaks .",
    "the ysos of the three molecular peaks show different characteristics in their spatial distributions and interstellar environments .",
    "the central molecular peak has the highest concentration of ysos , as 21 of them aggregate in the prominent  regions along the southwest rim of the supershell .",

    "the ysos with intermediate masses or without mass estimates do not show such strong bias in spatial distribution , although this may be partly due to an observational bias , as these ysos are fainter and it is more difficult to detect faint ysos over the bright background dust emission in  regions .",

    "the characteristics of the current star formation in the three molecular peaks of n44 appear to be dependent on the massive star formation that occurred in the recent past .",
    "it is possible that the pattern of star formation is controlled by properties of the molecular clouds .",

    "the supershell of n44 shows a breakout at the south rim , and hot gas has been escaping and deflected to the east .",
    "the juxtaposition of this hot gas flow and the star forming regions associated with lh49 in the southern gmc is intriguing and may suggest triggered star formation .",

    "<S> the  complex n44 in the large magellanic cloud ( lmc ) provides an excellent site to perform a detailed study of star formation in a mild starburst , as it hosts three regions of star formation at different evolutionary stages and it is not as complicated and confusing as the 30 doradus giant  region . </S>",
