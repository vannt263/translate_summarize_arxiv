    "in litarature there are several models in which triplet scalars occur , ranging from left - right symmetric models to little higgs models .",
    "complex scalar triplets with a hypercharge y = 2 are particularly rich in this context in terms of their phenomenological implications , especially in the aspect of lepton number violation .    in this talk",
    "i will present littlest higgs model@xcite , one of the little higgs models@xcite , having a complex su(2 ) scalar sector , and production of heavy double charged scalars via @xmath1 and @xmath2 channels in @xmath0 colliders .",
    "this talk is a summary of the double charged productions discussed in previous works@xcite .",
    "reviews on little higgs models can be found in numerous works@xcite .",
    "the main motivation of little higgs models are to overcome hierarchy problem . to do so these models use collective symmetry breaking mechanism that softens radiative corrections contributing to higgs mass .",
    "in the littlest higgs model , one of the minimal little higgs model , global symmetry @xmath3 is broken spontaneously to @xmath4 at an energy scale @xmath5 leaving @xmath6 nambu goldstone bosons(ngb ) .",
    "global @xmath3 in the model contains a weakly gauged subgroup @xmath7\\otimes[su(2)_2\\otimes u(1)_2]$ ] , thus eight gauge bosons . as the global symmetry @xmath3",
    "is broken spontaneously to @xmath4 triggered by a chosen vacuum basis , gauged subgroup @xmath7\\otimes[su(2)_2\\otimes u(1)_2]$ ] is broken to its diagonal subgroup @xmath8 of sm . as a result gauge bosons get mixings and some gain mass by eating four of the ngbs .",
    "the remaining ngbs at this stage are a scalar triplet @xmath9 and a scalar doublet @xmath10 .",
    "the usual electroweak symmetry breaking occurs by the vacuum expectation value(vev ) of the higgs potential written by coleman weinberg method for scalars . with ewsb vector bosons",
    "get extra mixings due to vacuum expectation values of @xmath10 doublet and @xmath9 triplet ; @xmath11 and @xmath12 respectively .    the particle content after ewsb contains sm vector bosons ; @xmath13 , @xmath14 , @xmath15 , and extra massive vector bosons ; @xmath16 , @xmath17 , @xmath18 . diagonalizing the mass matrix for scalars",
    "the physical states are found to be the sm higgs scalar @xmath19 , the neutral scalar @xmath20 , the neutral pseudo scalar @xmath21 , and the charged scalars @xmath22 and @xmath23 .",
    "the masses of these scalars are degenerate , and in terms of higgs mass can be expressed as : @xmath24 in the model new vector bosons cancel out the divergences coming to higgs mass from sm vector bosons loops , new scalars cancel out the divergences coming to higgs mass from higgs self loop . to cancel out the quadratic divergence coming to higgs mass from top quark loop , a new extra singlet",
    "the @xmath25 quark is introduced in the model by hand .",
    "the scalar fermion interactions in the model are written in yukawa lagrangian preserving gauge symmetries of the model for sm leptons and quarks , including the third generation having an extra singlet , the @xmath25 quark . in this work , leptons are charged under both @xmath26 groups , with corresponding hypercharges of @xmath27 and @xmath28 .",
    "the restriction for @xmath27 and @xmath28 is that @xmath29 should reproduce @xmath30 hypercharge @xmath31 of sm , thus @xmath32 and @xmath33 can be written . due to gauge invariance , @xmath34 can be taken as @xmath35@xcite .    in littlest higgs model , the symmetry braking scale @xmath36 and mixing angles between @xmath26 groups and @xmath37 groups ; @xmath38 and @xmath39 respectively , are free parameters and they are constrained by observables@xcite .",
    "the recent data from tevatron and lepii constrain the mass of the lightest heavy scalar as @xmath40@xcite . in the original formulation of the littlest higgs model ,",
    "these data imposes strong constraints on symmetry breaking scale(@xmath41 ) .",
    "but in this work by gauging fermions in both @xmath26 subgroups , fermion boson couplings are modified as done in@xcite . with this modification",
    "the symmetry breaking scale can be lowered to @xmath42 , which allows the mass of the @xmath18 to be at the order of few @xmath43s . in this case",
    "the allowed parameter region of the littlest higgs model is as follows . for low values of the symmetry breaking scale @xmath44 , mixing angles @xmath38 and @xmath39 between gauge bosons are in the range @xmath45 and @xmath46 , and for @xmath47 they have acceptable values in the range @xmath48 and @xmath49 . for the higher values of the symmetry breaking scale @xmath50 ,",
    "the mixing angles are less constrained , since the corrections to sm observables from model comes in the form @xmath51 and higher orders .    in the model for light fermions ,",
    "a majorano type mass term can be implemented in yukawa lagrangian@xcite which results in lepton flavor violation by unit two , such as : @xmath52 where @xmath53 are the lepton doublets @xmath54 , and @xmath55 is the yukawa coupling with @xmath56 and @xmath57 .",
    "the values of yukawa couplings @xmath58 and @xmath59 are restricted by the current constraints on the neutrino masses@xcite , given as ; @xmath60@xcite .",
    "since the vacuum expectation value @xmath12 has only an upper bound ; @xmath61 , @xmath55 can be taken up to order of unity without making @xmath12 unnaturally small .",
    "the decay modes of littlest higgs model scalars , including the lepton flavor violating decays , are studied in t.han et al@xcite .",
    "since these new scalars have lepton flavor violating modes , their total widths will depend on the yukawa couplings @xmath56 and @xmath62.depending on these mentioned parameters double charged scalars can decay into non leptonic particles ww pairs or leptons of same kind or leptons of different kind violating lepton number by 2 .",
    "the decay width of @xmath23 is given as@xcite : @xmath63    in the calculations , we ignored @xmath64 terms in the couplings , since we are not dealing with the corrections to a sm process .",
    "further information on theory and calculations , and feynman diagrams contributing the processes @xmath65 and @xmath66 can be found in @xcite .",
    "for the associated pair production of doubly charged scalars within @xmath13 the differential cross sections with respect to @xmath67 are plotted in figure [ zppc1a ] for different fixed values of mixing angles at @xmath68 , at symmetry breaking scale @xmath42 .",
    "the dependence of total cross section on the center of mass energy of this production process is plotted in figure [ zppc2 ] , and the numerical values of total cross sections are presented in table [ cseccharged ] for parameters of interest .          for the electroweak allowed parameters @xmath74 at @xmath42 at @xmath68 , the differential cross section gets low values at the order of @xmath75 .",
    "the resulting cross sections are calculated by integrating over @xmath67 , and found about @xmath76 ( table [ cseccharged ] ) resulting @xmath77 events per year for integrated luminosity of @xmath78 . for @xmath79 ,",
    "this production channel is not reachable . in the model",
    ", @xmath23 has decays to charged vectors @xmath80 and also to leptons @xmath81 proportional to squares of the values of the yukawa couplings ; @xmath82 for same families and @xmath83 for different lepton families",
    "when lepton violating modes are considered .",
    "so this channel provides final signals for doubly charged scalar discovery and lepton flavor violation .",
    "the final states of the doubly charged scalar pairs dominantly contain leptonic modes @xmath84 , semi leptonic modes @xmath85 and to standard model charged vector pair @xmath86 depending on @xmath58 and @xmath59 , while @xmath13 dominantly decays to jets carrying the energy at the order of masses of the scalar pair . for @xmath42 the leptonic branching ratio of doubly charged scalars can reach values close to @xmath87 for @xmath88 , independent from @xmath59 .",
    "if the value of the yukawa coupling @xmath58 is high enough @xmath89 , the number of final state lepton flavor violating signals such as ; @xmath90 , can reach up to @xmath91 events per year for luminosities of @xmath78 , which can be directly detectable free from backgrounds .",
    "for the process @xmath66 the total cross section of the production event is examined for @xmath42 .",
    "the dependence of the total cross section of the @xmath66 process on @xmath92 at fixed values of the littlest higgs model parameters are presented in fig .",
    "[ hpc2 ] . for the mixing angles",
    "@xmath93 , the production cross section is maximum with a value of @xmath94 for @xmath42 at @xmath95 . for the parameter sets @xmath96 for @xmath42 ,",
    "the total cross section is is slightly lower but still in the order of @xmath97 at @xmath95 .",
    "thus for an @xmath0 collider with an integrated luminosity of @xmath78 , yearly @xmath98 double charged pair production can be observed .",
    "it is seen from the final decay modes of the doubly charged pair given in eq.[dwp2 ] that the final state analysis is strongly dependent on the value of the yukawa coupling @xmath58 , thus on the value of the triplet vev @xmath12 .",
    "the dependence of the final collider signatures of the process @xmath99 on @xmath58 are plotted in figure [ br2 ] .      for @xmath100 ,",
    "the final decays of the doubly charged scalars are dominated by sm charged bosons , and the final collider signature will be @xmath101 . in this case with a subtraction from background , doubly charged scalars can be identified by reconstructing the same sign boson pairs .    for @xmath102 , the semi leptonic decay modes , @xmath103 will be observed . for @xmath104 ,",
    "the production rates for these modes are calculated as ; @xmath105 , leading to @xmath106 collider signals per year at collider with a luminosity of @xmath78 at @xmath95 . the cleanest signal in this case",
    "will be observed when both @xmath107 decay into jets ( @xmath108 ) . in this scenario",
    "there will be yearly @xmath109 signal of two same sign leptons of same family plus jets , violating lepton number and flavor by two , which can be directly detectable free from any backgrounds .",
    "the most interesting scenario happens when the yukawa coupling is close to unity , @xmath110 . in this case",
    "all final doubly charged scalars will decay into same family leptons , and the final collider signal will be either @xmath111 or @xmath112 .",
    "the mixed states @xmath113 resulting from the final decays of the doubly charged scalars into different families of leptons are suppressed because of the low production rates due to the value of the yukawa mixing coupling @xmath59 .    the branching ratio into the final signal @xmath111 when @xmath114 is calculated as @xmath115 , which will give @xmath116 observable signals per year at an integrated luminosity of @xmath78 when @xmath95 . for this final signal ,",
    "the lepton flavor is violated explicitly , free from any backgrounds .",
    "the double charged scalars in this case can be reconstructed from invariant mass distributions of same charged leptons .",
    "for the final state @xmath112 , there will be additional observable @xmath117 events per year .",
    "for this case lepton flavor violation can not be observed directly even if it happens via the lepton flavor violating decays of doubly charged scalars .",
    "although this signal has a huge sm background , with a proper background analysis , the existence of doubly charged scalars and so on their lepton flavor violating decays can be identified .",
