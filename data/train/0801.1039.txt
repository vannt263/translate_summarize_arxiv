    "in this subsection , we briefly discuss the numerical techniques that have been used to investigate the igm and the whim in particular . however , we refer the reader to the review of @xcite - chapter 12 , this volume for a thorough description of specific simulation techniques .",
    "the most common approach to model the whim is through cosmological hydrodynamical simulations .",
    "the strength of hydrodynamical simulations is that the basic gas dynamical processes that determine the evolution of the diffuse gas are directly simulated and that it is possible to make virtual observations of the whim with existing or future instruments .",
    "however , _",
    "ad hoc _ empirical prescriptions are needed to include processes such as galactic winds and feedback from active galactic nuclei ( agn ) , whose physics is still poorly understood and in any case would require a resolution far beyond the current standards to be included self - consistently .",
    "hydrodynamical simulations of the whim have typically used either smoothed particle hydrodynamics ( sph , e.g.  @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) , a uniform grid ( e.g.  @xcite ; @xcite ) , or adaptive mesh refinement ( amr , e.g.  @xcite ) to solve the gas dynamics .",
    "several properties of the whim , including the impact of gravitational and non - gravitational heating processes on the igm , and the observability of emission lines and absorption systems in uv and x - ray spectra , have been successfully investigated with analytical and semi - analytical techniques ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .      3 , 2 , 1 , and 0 .",
    "the gas mostly resides in three phases : a cool , photoionised , diffuse igm ( tail to lower left ) ; the warm - hot shocked igm ; and gas condensed into stars and star forming clouds ( tail to lower right ) .",
    "the solid lines indicate an approximate separation between these phases . from @xcite.,scaledwidth=90.0% ]    theoretical predictions and numerical simulations agree that the heating of the igm is fuelled by the gravitational accretion shocks emerging during the collapse of cosmic structures ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite - chapter 7 , this volume ) .",
    "simulations suggest that the distribution of the warm - hot gas closely reflects the distribution of the shock waves , and therefore the underlying density field .",
    "the role of shock waves in heating the igm has been investigated using cosmological hydrodynamical simulations by @xcite , who find that the fastest shocks can be found around clusters and groups of galaxies , while the slowest shocks usually propagate across low density regions like sheets and filaments .",
    "this reflects the fact that the infall velocity is a measure of the depth of the potential well .",
    "@xcite reach similar conclusions using analytical techniques and find that the shocks with the highest temperatures are associated with the most massive virialised objects , up to distances larger than their virial radii .",
    "the whim gas is organised in a complex structure of filaments and sheets , that generally reflects the dynamics of structure formation . according to @xcite ,",
    "the gas density in filaments is typically @xmath14 times the mean density and varies more smoothly than in clusters .",
    "filaments have a coherence length of about 5 mpc , although some can be as long as 25 mpc , and a diameter of about @xmath15 mpc .",
    "the detailed thermal structure of the whim strongly depends on the direction of propagation of the accretion shocks , while the velocity field appears to be orthogonal to the filaments at large distances from galaxy clusters and aligned to the filaments at small distances .",
    "most simulations predict that between 30 and 50 per cent of all the baryons in the low redshift universe have temperatures in the interval @xmath16 k ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",

    "hot gas with @xmath18 k resides in the hottest cores of groups and in large clusters of galaxies .",
    "most of the gas , however , is at temperatures @xmath19 k and at @xmath20 is about evenly spread between the whim and the cooler , mostly photo - ionised igm . at higher redshifts ,",
    "a larger fraction of the baryons resides in the photo - ionised igm .",

    "this mostly photo - ionised gas is responsible for the majority of the o and o absorption lines , but contributes little to the total o and o emission , which is instead produced by warmer , collisionally ionised ions .",
    "simulations that include non - equilibrium processes have been performed by @xcite , @xcite and @xcite . in most hydrodynamical simulations , it is routinely assumed that diffuse gas is in ionisation equilibrium ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) . in general ,",
    "ionisation equilibrium is nearly achieved in the centres of galaxy clusters and in photo - ionised regions with @xmath25 k. however , this may not happen in the outer regions of clusters , in groups , and in the whim @xcite .",

    "@xcite find that a significant fraction of the whim at @xmath20 is not in ionisation equilibrium , as do @xcite .",
    "however , @xcite calculate that although this strongly affects the relative abundance of ions such as o , o and o , it does not have a significant effect on the observable signatures of the whim in emission or absorption .",
    "when gas is infalling onto a collapsing structure and is heated by gravitational accretion shocks , most of its energy is carried by ions , while electrons can only gain thermal energy through collisions with ions .",
    "the temperatures of ions and electrons can therefore be very different and converge only if energy can be efficiently transferred from ions to electrons .",
    "if only coulomb interactions are considered , then the relaxation timescale can be shorter than the age of the universe for the whim ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "since the relative abundance of metal ions and the plasma emissivity are sensitive to the electron temperature , this would have consequences for the observability of the whim .",
    "k. from @xcite.,width=377 ]    @xcite introduce a two - temperature model for the thermal evolution of an ionised gas .",
    "their model includes an explicit treatment for collisional relaxation processes between electrons and ions and allows one to follow the temperature of free electrons separately from the temperature of ions .",
    "they find that at @xmath20 most whim gas shows a two - temperature structure .",
    "[ yoshida2005 ] shows the electron temperature in the two - temperature model compared to the mean temperature of the gas at @xmath20 for the simulations of @xcite . clearly , the electron temperature of the whim is significantly lower than the mean gas temperature , when non - equilibrium processes are taken into account .",
    "@xcite calculate that the relative abundance of o , o and o predicted by a two - temperature model can be about an order of magnitude different from that predicted by a one - temperature model .",
    "this yields similarly different values for the line emission of ions .",
    "however , from supernova remnants we know that plasma waves are typically much more efficient than collisional processes in transferring energy from ions to electrons ( e.g.  @xcite ) and these effects have not yet been included in simulations of the whim .",
    "@xcite may therefore have overestimated the importance of the two - temperature structure of the post - shock gas .",
    "several studies have investigated whether sources of non - gravitational heating might significantly affect the thermal state of the igm .",
    "simulations by @xcite predict that non - gravitational processes , such as galactic winds and x - ray emission from galaxies and quasars , contribute no more than 20 per cent of the energy required to heat the igm , in agreement with previous results from @xcite and @xcite .    a powerful test to constrain the contribution of non - gravitational processes is the comparison of the observed intensity of the soft x - ray background to the predictions of numerical simulations .",
    "since most of the observed background emission has been resolved into point sources ( @xcite ; @xcite ) , the comparison of the predictions of hydrodynamical simulations with observations can put tight constraints on the amount of the observed background emission that can be attributed to the diffuse intergalactic gas .",
    "in general , the intensity of the soft x - ray background predicted by simulations that include only gravitational heating processes strongly exceeds the observed emission from high density , collapsed regions ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the emission is primarily due to bremsstrahlung and reflects the cooling of gas in groups and clusters of galaxies .",
    "analytical calculations by @xcite and @xcite find an order of magnitude more background light than predicted by simulations , owing to the importance of gravitational pre - heating .",
    "they suggest that additional heating from non - gravitational processes might be necessary to `` puff up '' and hence decrease the emission from collapsed regions and reconcile the theoretical predictions with the observations . however , they note that non - gravitational heating does not seem to be relevant for uncollapsed regions like filaments and voids .",
    "@xcite argue that non - gravitational processes can help to establish an entropy floor in high density regions .",

    "they suggest that an entropy floor of @xmath26 kev @xmath27  is required to reconcile the theoretical results with observations . @xcite",
    "demonstrate further that radiative cooling and additional heating from feedback can efficiently suppress the x - ray background , while substantially modifying the characteristic spectral shape of the background itself .",
    "the extended spatial distribution over cosmological scales makes the whim an essential contributor to the diffuse x - ray background radiation .",
    "the most intense x - ray emission comes from relatively compact sources such as clusters , active galactic nuclei and galaxies .",
    "the gas in these objects has high emissivity power , but accounts for only a small fraction of the baryon mass in the universe .",
    "the emissivity of the whim is usually a few orders of magnitude lower , because of its lower density and temperature .",
    "however , the whim accounts for up to half the baryonic mass at @xmath0 and its integrated emission over cosmological scales might be roughly comparable to that of dense regions and compact objects .",

    "@xcite estimate that the whim could contribute on average between 4 and 12 per cent of the integrated sunyaev - zeldovich effect ( sze ) signal @xmath74 for individual sources identified in upcoming surveys .",
    "the whim is a particularly relevant source of contamination for observations of clusters of galaxies , because it would strongly affect the calibration of the cluster @xmath75 relationship .",
    "unless the whim signal can be unambiguously modelled and separated from the cluster signal , it introduces a bias and a source of scatter difficult to quantify in the @xmath75 relationship .",
    "ultimately , this would limit the reliability of the @xmath75 relationship for estimating cosmological parameters .",
    "it has been suggested that cosmic shear and gravitational shocks might be able to amplify the magnetic fields that permeate the large - scale structure ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) . given the strong interconnection between the origin of the whim and gravitational shocks , it is possible for the whim to be magnetised , although it might be difficult to predict to what level .",
    "while magnetic fields have been unambiguously detected in the cores of galaxy clusters , few observations have attempted to establish the presence of magnetised plasma in low density regions such as groups and filaments . however , there is now compelling evidence that magnetic fields might exist beyond clusters , and in particular in the whim .",
    "@xcite claim the detection of an extended magnetic field in the region of the coma supercluster .",
    "they observe radio - synchrotron radiation from a region with an enhanced number density of galaxies , seeming to indicate the presence of a group of galaxies , perhaps in the process of merging with the coma cluster .",
    "evidence for intergalactic magnetic fields in the region zwcl  2341 + 0000 at @xmath76 , where galaxies seems to lie along a filament , has been reported by @xcite . in both cases ,",
    "the inferred strength of the magnetic field is of order @xmath77 @xmath78 g .",
    "several mechanisms have been proposed to explain the injection of seed magnetic fields into the intracluster and intergalactic media , later to be amplified by cosmic shear and gravitational shocks . among them , primordial magnetic fields , jets and radio lobes emerging from radio galaxies ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) and galactic winds ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ) . simulations ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) show that magnetic fields can be efficiently transported into the igm and fill most of the universe by @xmath20 .",
    "@xcite predict that galactic winds alone could be responsible for igm magnetic fields of order @xmath79 @xmath78 g , in agreement with observations .",
    "the search for the `` missing baryons '' has opened the way to our understanding of the most elusive baryonic component in the universe : the hot diffuse gas that traces the cosmic web .    given the paucity of observational findings , most of what we know about the whim is based on numerical simulations .",
    "these predict that at @xmath80 up to 50 per cent of the igm has been heated to temperatures in the range @xmath81 k. while most of the heating is provided by gravitational accretion shocks propagating out of regions undergoing gravitational collapse , non - gravitational processes such as galactic winds and agn feedback may play an important role in high density regions , mostly by preventing cooling and regulating the intensity of the x - ray background .",
    "the observability of the whim by future facilities has received a lot of attention and a wealth of predictions have been made based on numerical results .",
    "the detection of the whim seems to be extremely challenging , if not impossible , with current instruments and a new generation of x - ray telescopes with higher sensitivity and spectral resolution , such as _ constellation - x _  and _ xeus _ , is needed to study the whim in absorption .",
    "in addition to high sensitivity and spectral resolution , high spatial resolution on a large field of view , as proposed for the explorer of diffuse emission and gamma - ray burst explosions ( _ edge _ ) , would be ideal for mapping the whim emission on the sky .",
    "although most theoretical predictions claim optimistically that we will be able to detect the whim in absorption with _ constellation - x _  and _ xeus _ , and maybe in emission with some luck , there is a long way to go before observations can confirm the simulation predictions , or show us a different picture altogether of what and where the whim is .",
    "we are grateful to frits paerels and philipp richter for a careful reading of the manuscript .",
    "we thank issi ( bern ) for support of the team `` non - virialized x - ray components in clusters of galaxies '' .",
