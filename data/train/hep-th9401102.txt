    "recently , the question of information loss during the process of black hole evaporation @xcite have been intensively studied @xcite .",
    "the reason behind this renewed interest is the discovery of black hole solutions in two dimensonal dilaton gravity models @xcite and exact conformal field theories describing two dimensional black holes @xcite and the demonstration that black hole formation and subsequent evaporation can be _ in principle _ studied in two dimensional models @xcite .",
    "much of the work in the past two years have dealt with the problem in the semiclassical approximation @xcite , @xcite in which the dilaton and graviton fields are treated as classical quantitites wheras the matter fields are treated quantum mechanically - an approximation which is valid if the number of matter fields @xmath1 is large with the product @xmath2 kept finite ( @xmath3 denotes the dilaton field ) . a more definitive analysis can be carried out for reissner - nordstrom black holes @xcite . in most models",
    "the semiclassical approximation is valid in a region of space time bounded by a critical line where @xmath4 becomes equal to a critical value @xmath5 .",
    "nevertheless , the evolution of the system away from this boundary can be studied analytically for some models or numerically for others .",
    "the results of the semiclassical picture seems to converge on a picture where information is lost from the observable part of the universe .",
    "it has been argued , however - most persuasively by t hooft - that one can not really ignore quantum fluctuations of gravity even if the black hole is of large mass and @xmath1 is large since high energy physics near the horizon appear as normal energy processes to the aymptotic observer due to the very large redshift .",
    "a possible approach to an exact quantum treatment of black holes comes from the connection of matrix models with static black hole backgrounds , viz .",
    "a certain integral transform of the collective field of the matrix model behaves as a `` tachyon '' field in the black hole background of the two dimensional critical string .",
    "one remarkable result is that the singularity of the background disappears in the full nonperturbative answer @xcite .",
    "in fact the same holds true for the exact one particle wave function of the problem as well as for more general incoming waves @xcite . a different matrix model black hole connection has been proposed in @xcite .",
    "we expect the above conclusions to hold in this model as well . however , this connection is as yet known only for _ static _ black holes and one does not have a description of black hole formation .",
    "furthermore , in matrix models gravity and dilaton fields do not appear in the action explicitly : in a sense they are integrated out and their quantum effects are completely contained in the collective field theory or the fermionic field theory .",
    "it is useful to have models where one can study gravity fluctuations explicitly and exactly and infer how they affect the quantum evolution of black holes .    in a recent paper one such model with @xmath0 scalar fields in the presence of two dimensional dilaton gravity with a boundary",
    "has been studied by verlinde and verlinde and by schoutens , verlinde and verlinde @xcite . in a fiducial coordinate system with light - cone",
    "coordinates @xmath6 the boundary is taken to be @xmath7 .",
    "however , in terms of physical coordinates which become minkowskian far away , the boundary is dynamically determined by the infalling matter and undergoes quantum fluctuations . in two dimensions",
    "there is no physical local degree of freedom of the graviton - dilaton system , but the degree of freedom corresponding to a dynamical boundary survives .",
    "thus the effect of boundary fluctuations in this model serves as a useful toy model for studying effects of quantum gravity fluctuations .",
    "in fact this model has some features of the moving mirror problem @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we study this model further with a view to understand quantum gravity effects .",
    "we first find the most general boundary conditions which leads to a perfect reflection of the matter energy momentum tensor and consistent with the constraints .",
    "these boundary conditions are parametrized by a single parameter @xmath8 .",
    "the boundary conditions of @xcite correspond to @xmath9 . in a recent paper @xcite similar boundary conditions",
    "have been used to study the dynamics of the boundary as a dynamical moving mirror .",
    "our discussion is complementary to this paper and concentrates on the space - time features of the model .",
    "the physics of the model is very different for @xmath9 and @xmath10 .",
    "for @xmath9 there is no meaningful classical solution .",
    "there is a semiclassical solution in which the boundary `` jumps forward '' and becomes spacelike as soon as the incident matter _ energy density _",
    "exceeds a critical value . at the same time",
    "a black hole singularity forms which meets the apparent horizon at a finite time , like the other semiclassical models studied in the literature .    on the contrary",
    "the @xmath11 model makes sense classically .",
    "the boundary now receedes away as the matter impinges on it . when the _ total _ energy of the incoming matter exceeds a critical value , the boundary starts receeding with the speed of light and with unbounded acceleration at a time much _",
    "later _ than the time of impact . in the classical theory",
    "this is also the critical value beyond which a black hole singularity forms . at the semiclassical level",
    ", the critical value of the energy has a different dependence on @xmath8 .",
    "the solution is , in fact , very similar to that in the rst model @xcite with a similar picture of black hole evaporation .",
    "finally we quantize the @xmath11 model fully by expanding around the classical solution representing black hole formation .",
    "we calculate some quantum fluctuations of quantities related to space - time in this theory , like the dispersion of the line element on the boundary and the dispersion of the rescaled scalar curvature . as in any field theory",
    "these dispersions depend on the ultraviolet cutoff which simply express the fact that one generically sees more and more quantum fluctuation as one goes to shorter and shorter distances . in other words ,",
    "the dispersion depends on on the resolution time of the measuring apparatus . if all observers use a resolution time of order one ( in natural units ) we show that an infalling observer finds a finite dispersion .",
    "an asymptotic observer , however , has a rather different conclusion .",
    "so long as the incoming energy is below the critical value , the aymptotic observer also finds a finite dispersion with a finite resolution time .",
    "however as soon as the energy exceeds a critical value and a horizon is formed the dispersion grows as one approaches the horizon and becomes infinite at the horizon - even with a finite resolution time .",
    "thus the aymptotic observer always finds that the quantum fluctuations of the dilaton and metric diverge at the horizon , which may be quite far from the singularity .",
    "the result is quite consistent with the ideas put forward by t hooft @xciteand with ideas of black hole complementarity @xcite .",
    "the phenomenon is quite similar to the infinite spreading of strings moving in black hole or rindler spacetimes considered by susskind @xcite .",
    "it is unclear whether the presence of these large fluctuations of space time as observed by an asymptotic observer signifies the invalidity of the semiclassical approximation even for large black holes .",
    "the model consists of a space - time metric in two dimensions @xmath12 and a dilaton field @xmath13 and @xmath0 massless scalar fields @xmath14 with the action s & = & 1 2  [ eq : one ] here @xmath15 is the scalar curvature and @xmath16 is a cosmological constant which can be set to one by a choice of scale .",
    "the space - time has a boundary , which is the fixed line @xmath17 in a fiducial set of null coordinates @xmath6 .",
    "these are defined in terms of the space coordinate @xmath18 and the time coordinate @xmath19 by @xmath20 and @xmath21 .",
    "we will work in the conformal gauge @xmath22 .",
    "let us introduce two free chiral fields @xmath23 and @xmath24 .",
    "these are related to the metric and dilaton fields by e^2(- ) = ( u ) ( v ) [ eq : bcone ] the remaining equation of motion is then e^-2 = - ( u ) ( v ) [ eq : two ] and constraints simply state the total energy momentum tensor vanishes t^g_uu + t_uu = 0  t^g_vv + t_vv = 0 [ eq : three ] here @xmath25 stand for the gravity - dilaton part of the eenergy momentum tensor while @xmath26 the matter part .",
    "we will often omit the subscripts since they are chiral . since the matter is conformally coupled we may write f^i(u , v ) = f^i+(u ) - f^i-(v ) [ eq : four ]    the general solution of ( [ eq : two ] ) may be written as e^-2 = -(u ) ( v ) + g^+ ( u ) + g^- ( v ) + k [ eq : bctwo ] where the functions @xmath27 have to be determined by solving the constraints ( [ eq : three ] ) , and @xmath28 is an integration constant .",
    "the expressions for @xmath29 become & t_uu^g = - + ^2 + & t_vv^g = - + ^2 [ eq : bcfour ] now define two new fields @xmath30 and @xmath31 by & = ( u ) ( u ) + & = ( v ) ( v ) [ eq : bcfive ] one then has t_uu^g = ( u ) ( u )  t_vv^g = ( v ) ( v ) [ eq : bcsix ]    finally we write down the expression for the scalar curvature in terms of the fields introduced above .",
    "this is given by r & = & 8 e^-2 + & = & 4[1 + e^2((v ) - ( u))((u ) - ( v))][eq : bcdone ] we also introduce the `` rescaled '' scalar curvature e^-2  ( r-4 ) [ eq : bcdtwo ] which will be useful in later calculations . in fact this is the quantity that appears in the action .",
    "the expression ( [ eq : bcdone ] ) shows that the zeroes of @xmath32 would be generically curvature singularities , unless the expression which multiplies it vanishes .",
    "furthermore any region where any of the fields @xmath33 diverge is also potentially a region of curvature singularity .",
    "the boundary conditions we want to impose are ( i ) the dilaton field must be constant along the boundary , i.e. @xmath34 along @xmath7 and ( ii ) the matter must be perfectly reflected at the boundary .",
    "this sets @xmath35 and ensures that @xmath36 at @xmath7 . since the total energy momentum tensor must vanish ( or a constant in the quantum theory ) we must , for consistency , also require that ( iii ) the energy momentum tensor of gravity is also reflected off the boundary perfectly , i.e. @xmath37 at @xmath7 .    the conditions on the dilaton and metric fields are nontrivial .",
    "the condition ( i ) is = 0 [ eq : bcseven ] at @xmath17 . in @xcite each term in ( [ eq : bcseven ] ) was separately set to zero , which also automatically ensured ( iii ) .",
    "this sets both @xmath38 and @xmath39 to zero at the boundary and corresponds to the boundary conditions used in @xcite .",
    "clearly this is not the general condition .",
    "if there was no boundary we could have used the remaining reparametrization invariances to choose coordinates such that @xmath23 and @xmath40 are both of a desired form .",
    "however the boundary conditions relate left moving and right moving modes , which means that the remaining reparametrizations of @xmath41 and @xmath42 are not independent .",
    "we can , however , fix one of the fields @xmath43 . in this paper",
    "we will often use a gauge such that @xmath44 .",
    "we will see later that this choice corresponds to a choice of kruskal coordinates .",
    "the form of @xmath24 has to be now determined by solving the constraints as we will show .",
    "let us introduce a new field @xmath45 defined as ( v ) = ^2 ( v ) [ eq : bceight ] the most general form for @xmath46 which satisfies the condition ( [ eq : bcseven ] ) may be easily seen to be , in the gauge @xmath44 ( u ) & = & ( u ) + f[u,(u ) ] + ( v ) & = & v - f[v,(v ) ] 1 ^2[eq : bcnine ] where @xmath47 $ ] is a general function of @xmath18 and a functional of @xmath48 .",
    "now substitute ( [ eq : bcnine ] ) into the expressions ( [ eq : bcsix ] ) and get t_uu^g & = & ^2 + df du + t_vv^g & = & ^2 - df dv + 2 f [ eq : bcten ] requiring these two expression to match at @xmath17 we get the condition + f = f [ eq : bcelevena ] whose unique solution is f[u,(u ) ] = ( u ) [ eq : bceleven ] where @xmath8 is an integration constant .",
    "the boundary conditions in @xcite corresponds to @xmath49 .",
    "the boundary conditions ( [ eq : bcnine ] ) may be considered as operator conditions in the quantum theory . in the semiclassical theory",
    ", however , the expression for the energy momentum tensor has additional terms coming from the conformal anomaly and the form of the solution for @xmath50 $ ] are correspondingly different .",
    "this will be discussed in a later section .",
    "given some energy momentum tensor of incoming matter the classical solution is obtained by solving the equations @xmath51 and @xmath52 where @xmath29 is obtained from ( [ eq : bcten ] ) with @xmath53 given by ( [ eq : bceleven ] ) .",
    "these two equations are in fact identical ( since the reflection condition on matter fields set @xmath54 ) and become ^2 + + t(u ) = 0 [ eq : bctwelve ] given a solution of @xmath55 it is straightforward to solve for @xmath56 .",
    "this is given by = ^u ^2 + c where @xmath57 is an integration constant .",
    "this becomes , after using ( [ eq : bctwelve ] ) , ( u ) = -^u t(u ) - + c [ eq : bcthirteen ]    the gravity and dilaton fields may be now readily obtained . from the definition of @xmath27 and @xmath58 in ( [ eq : bctwo ] ) and ( [ eq : bcfive ] ) , the relations ( [ eq : bcnine ] ) and ( [ eq : bceleven ] ) and the equation ( [ eq : bctwelve ] ) we get g^+(u ) & = & u ( u ) + u ( u ) - ^u u t(u ) + g^- ( v ) & = & -v ( v ) - ^v dvv t(v)[eq : bcseventeen ] putting these together we get e^-2 & = & u[(u ) - ( v ) ] + + & & [ ^u duu t(u ) - ^v dv v t(v ) ] + & & + + k [ eq : bceighteen ] where @xmath28 is an integration constant , which is the value of @xmath32 on the boundary .    note that in this classical problem , @xmath8 can be scaled out of the problem by rescaling @xmath59 and @xmath60 in ( [ eq : bctwelve ] ) .",
    "this leads to a scaling of @xmath61 .",
    "this immediately shows that @xmath9 is a rather singular limit . in the following",
    "we will work mostly with @xmath62 unless otherwise stated .",
    "we now find the classical solution in the presence incoming matter in the form of a shock wave whose matter energy momentum tensor is given by @xmath63 ( we have chosen the location of the shock wave at @xmath64 by a suitable shift of coordinates )",
    ". we will solve ( [ eq : bctwelve ] ) with the condition that the spacetime is flat linear dilaton vacuum before the shock wave arrives ( i.e. in the region @xmath65 for all @xmath42 ) . with this condition the solution to ( [ eq : bctwelve ] ) can be found in all of the @xmath66 space : ( v ) = v[1 - ( a a + v ( 1-a))(v-1 ) ] [ eq : nine ] where @xmath67 .",
    "this is an explicitly real solution and since @xmath68 it may appear that @xmath40 is a monotonically increasing function , so that the boundary is everywhere timelike .",
    "however , ( [ eq : nine ] ) clearly shows that @xmath45 blows up for some positive value of @xmath42 whenever @xmath69 .",
    "this becomes clear when one looks at the solution for @xmath40 obtained by plugging in ( [ eq : nine ] ) into ( [ eq : bcthirteen ] ) ( v ) = ^2[(-1 v + a)(1-v ) -(1 - a a + ( 1-a ) v ) ( v-1 ) ] [ eq : ten ] which shows that @xmath40 blows up at @xmath70 when @xmath71 .",
    "the solution for the dilaton field is given by e^-2 & = & ^2 u v  u , v < 1 + & = & ^2(u(1 v - a ) + a )  u > 1 , v < 1 + & = & ^2 ( a + ( 1-a)u ) ( a + ( 1-a)v )  u , v > 1 [ eq : eleven ] the meaning of the parameter @xmath8 is now clear .",
    "this is simply the value of @xmath72 at the boundary .",
    "the metric is best expressed in terms of the coordinates @xmath73 defined as @xmath74 and @xmath75 .",

    "as in theories of gravity field variables become physical coordinates . in the quantum theory",
    "these `` coordinate fields '' become operators and have important consequences @xcite .",
    "the profile of the boundary in the @xmath78 coordinates is simply the curve of @xmath40 as a function of @xmath42 . from the above expressions it is clear that as long as @xmath79 , the boundary is always timelike . at the point where the pulse hits the boundary",
    "there is a discontinuity , but it never has an unbounded acceleration .",
    "furthermore @xmath40 always stays negative , and no horizons are formed . for @xmath71 , @xmath40 turns positive _ before _ the pulse hits the boundary . at the impact point",
    ", there is a usual discontinuity , but nothing dramatic happens at ths point .",
    "however at a later time the acceleration increases without bound , the velocity approaches the speed of light and @xmath80 becomes infinite at a point @xmath70 .",
    "as @xmath81 increases this point approaches the point @xmath82 where the shock have hits the boundary .",
    "it is not meaningful to continue the solution beyond this point .",
    "in fact the asymptotic observer will see the boundary running away at the point where @xmath80 hits a zero , since this is the end of the asymptotic coordinate system .",
    "this instability has been observed in @xcite and is different from the instability discussed above .",
    "the latter occurs for a kruskal observer , using the @xmath43 coordinates .",
    "thus there is a critical value of the _ total _ energy of the incoming pulse beyond which the boundary runs away .",
    "note that we are dealing with a delta function shock wave for which the _ energy density _ is always unbounded .",
    "the interesting point in this model is that it is precisely at this value of the total energy that a black hole starts forming .",
    "this is clear from the solution to the dilaton and the metric fields in ( [ eq : eleven ] ) and ( [ eq : twelve ] ) .",
    "note that the conformal factor in the @xmath73 coordinates is exactly equal to @xmath83 . from ( [ eq : twelve ] ) we see that there are no singularities in the region before the incident pulse . in the region",
    "@xmath84 the metric is exactly like the standard black hole metric .",
    "we thus have a potential curvature singularity along the spacelike line @xmath85 .",
    "since this region in the @xmath86 space corresponds to @xmath87 , there is no singularity when @xmath79 . for @xmath71",
    "there is a singularity which asymptotes to @xmath88 .",
    "the null line @xmath88 which correspond to @xmath89 is the event horizon which in this case also coincides with the apparent horizon ( defined in the usual way by @xmath90 ) . in the region",
    "@xmath91 the singularity is along the null line @xmath92 which begins at the point where the singularity in the region ii intersects with the reflected wave .    the expression ( [ eq : bcdone ] )",
    "may be used to compute the curvature scalar .",
    "the result is that @xmath15 diverges on the part of the singularity in the @xmath93 region , but is finite along the null singularity in the @xmath91 region .",
    "however , in this model the kinetic energy terms contain a factor of @xmath32 and zeroes of @xmath83 are genuine singularities even when the curvature is finite .",
    "the kruskal diagrams for the solution ( in the coordinates @xmath43 ) are shown in fig . 1 for @xmath79 and in fig . 2 for @xmath71 .",
    "note the horizon is the line @xmath94 while the reflected pulse is along @xmath95 .",
    "we now outline what happens in the model when we take into account quantum fluctuations of the matter fields , but still treat the dilaton gravity sector classically . as is well known , this has several effects .",
    "first , there is a constant negative vacuum energy due to normal ordering effects . in the @xmath6 coordinates this vacuum energy ( for @xmath1 scalar fields ) is simply @xmath96 secondly the conformal anomaly induces new terms in the action which modifies the equations of motion as well as the form of the energy momentum tensor for the dilaton gravity system . however , as demonstrated in @xcite one can choose counterterms such that the dynamical equations of motion of the semiclassical theory are similar to those of the classical theory with the replacement e^-2 [ e^-2 + ] [ eq : thirteen ] here @xmath97 .",
    "thus the solution to @xmath98 is still given by the general form in equation ( [ eq : bctwo ] ) . with the same definition of the fields @xmath99 as in ( [ eq : bcfive ] ) the expressions for the gravity part of the energy momentum tensor becomes , instead of ( [ eq : bcsix ] ) t^g_uu & = & + t^g_vv & = & [ eq : sone ] where @xmath100 denote the classical contributions in ( [ eq : bcsix ] ) and @xmath101 .",
    "the most general boundary conditions may be now derived in the gauge @xmath44 following the same steps as in the previous sections . with the same ansatz as in ( [ eq : bcnine ] ) and the requirement that the gravity part of the energy momentum tensor is perfectly reflected at the boundary one gets instead of ( [ eq : bcelevena ] ) the following equation for @xmath102 $ ] + f = f + [ eq : stwo ] whose general solution is f[(u),u ] = ( u ) - ( u ) [ eq : sthree ] this shows that , in particular , the boundary conditions in @xcite , which is identical to that used in @xcite can not be valid unless @xmath103 .",
    "are not consistent in the rst model .",
    "@xcite ] the equation satisfied by @xmath55 now becomes ^2 + - ^2 + t(u ) = 1 2 u^2 [ eq : sthreea ] in general these equations are difficult to solve exactly",
    ".    the semiclassical limit could be a good description when @xmath1 is very large .",
    "however one may get some insight into quantum effects of matter for the present case of @xmath104 where the semiclassical equations can still be solved exactly .",
    "this is because in this case the anomaly is absent and the only modifications are the inclusion of the vacuum energy and the replacement of the dilaton field by @xmath98 in ( [ eq : thirteen ] ) .      to solve the constraints for a shock wave one has to solve ( [ eq : bctwelve ] ) with t(u)=1 2 u^2[t(u-1 ) - 1][eq : thirteenh ] we require that the solution to the left of the shock wave is the flat minkowski space linear dilaton vacuum",

    "we are expanding around a specific classical solution corresponding to a dynamical black hole formation with some incoming matter .",
    "we are interested in getting an idea of the strength of quantum fluctuations of space - time quantities , one example of which is the line element on the boundary .",
    "this may be done by computing the corresponding local quantities _ using the classical metric as the reference metric_. these quantities have a perfectly good meaning for an asymptotic observer . in the asymptotic region",

    "the quantity @xmath212 along the boundary is small near the singularity , but not near the horizon .",
    "thus the freely falling observer perceives boundary fluctuations which are large only at scales smaller than the cutoff @xmath211 .",

    "this is consistent with the fact that the freely falling observer does not see anything special at the horizon .",
    "an asymptotic observer at future null infinity would make measurements with a cutoff which has some fixed value in terms of the aymptotic coordinates .",

    "we thus conclude that as the incident energy approaches the critical value and a horizon starts to form , the asymptotic obsever measures very large fluctuations near the horizon .",
    "the basic reason behind this phenomenon is the large redshift between the horizon and infinity .",
    "our result is in fact a concrete illustration of the contention of t hooft .",
    "quantum dispersions of other quantities show a similar behaviour . for example",
    "the correlation of the rescaled curvature @xmath217 introduced in ( [ eq : bcdtwo ] ) may be calculated to be ( in the region @xmath218 ) & & ( , ) ( , ) = + & & ( 1 + e^(-))^2 [ 1 ( ) ^2 + 1 ( ) ^2][eq : fortyfive ] by the same reasoning as above , curvature fluctuations as measured by the aymptotic observer grow very large near the horizon .",
    "the real question is : does these large fluctuations of space - time as perceived by the asymptotic observer invalidate the semiclassical approximation regardless of the mass of the black hole ?",
    "the question is confused by the fact that these fluctuations are large only for an asymptotic observer and one might argue that to examine the validity of the semiclassical approximation one should use a local geodesic cutoff .",
    "it is nevertheless clear that the asymptotic observer will have to account for large space - time fluctuations in his or her description of the hawking process .",
    "one way to obtain a definitive answer to this important question is to calculate quantities which have unambiguous meaning in quantum gravity , for example correlations of integrated operators .",
    "these `` susceptibilities '' may be studied as a function of the parameter @xmath81 of the classical solution and one may be able to see whether quantum corrections grow large as @xmath81 approaches the critical value @xmath219 . in this regard",
    "the present model with nonzero @xmath8 could be useful since this has a critical value of @xmath81 necessary for black hole formation and one could study quantum properties of the model as @xmath220 from below .",
