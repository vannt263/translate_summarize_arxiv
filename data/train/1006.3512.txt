    "<S> we present a simple setup to implement truly random number generator based on the measurement of the laser phase noise . from the entropy point of view </S>",
    "<S> , we estimate the number of truly random bits that can be extracted from the sampled byte . with a simple method of adopting the @xmath0-least - significant - bit </S>",
    "<S> , we amplify the entropy of the original bit sequence and realize a truly random bit generation rate of @xmath1 mbps .    </S>",
    "<S> the application of random number generator ( rng ) covers wide areas of cryptography , statistical sampling , computer simulations , etc . </S>",
    "<S> traditionally , rng is implemented using the algorithm - based pseudo - random number generator ( prng ) , while in most application areas , prngs are not enough . </S>",
    "<S> so far , it is commonly accepted that pure quantum process is the only solution for truly random number generator ( trng ) . </S>",
    "<S> recently , two kinds of quantum noise of laser , phase noise and relaxation oscillation noise , are chosen to generate truly random bit sequence with high generation rate @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> phase noise , directly measured using self - delayed homodyne detection @xcite , can be used to generate random bits with good randomness , but the final random number generation rate is limited by the laser linewidth ; relaxation oscillation noise , amplified by chaotic behavior , can be used to achieve ultra - high random bit generation rate @xcite , but the random bits generated by chaotic laser involve more classical noise ( not truly random ) and so can not have good results in three - sigma randomness tests @xcite . to generate an original random bit sequence , </S>",
    "<S> either an oscilloscope @xcite or an analog - digital - converter ( adc ) @xcite is available for high speed multi - bit per measurement data recording , but due to data size limitation in one scan process , using oscilloscope will reduce the generation rate for long random bit sequence . </S>",
    "<S> multi - bit per measurement method increases the random number generation rate but introduces additional correlations . </S>",
    "<S> the proper number of bits extracted from the recorded data can be estimated by randomness evaluation .    in this letter , we propose a simple method to evaluate the randomness from the entropy point of view , which gives the upper and lower estimations of the maximal bits that can be extracted from one measurement . </S>",
    "<S> the laser phase noise ( gaussian random variable @xcite ) measurement based trng scheme is adopted , where a single - mode vertical cavity surface emitting laser ( vcsel ) is used and sampled by an adc . </S>",
    "<S> after entropy amplification by bit extraction , we realize a @xmath1 mbps trng , which passes three standard statistical tests . </S>",
    "<S> note that this bit extraction method is also applicable for other random sources .    </S>",
    "<S> the schematic setup is shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ setup ] ( see also @xcite ) and the delayed self - homodyne method is used to measure the phase noise of the vcsel . </S>",
    "<S> the beat signal of @xmath2 and @xmath3 is detected by the avalanche photodetector ( apd ) and sampled at @xmath4 mhz by the 8-bit binary adc . </S>",
    "<S> when the delay time is much longer than the coherence time of laser ( @xmath5 ) , the autocorrelation function of the laser electric field is eliminated @xcite , i.e. , @xmath6 , where @xmath7 and @xmath8 is the laser linewidth . in this case , the beat signal of these two mutually independent laser fields can be considered as a good candidate to implement trng .    since the phase noise of the laser is inversely proportional to the laser power , while the classical noises are laser power independent @xcite , we choose working current just above the threshold current to ensure that the phase noise is dominant and the true randomness can thus be guaranteed . in experiment , a @xmath9 nm vcsel laser works at 1.4 ma ( threshold current 1.3 ma ) , and its linewidth is @xmath10 mhz ( @xmath11 ns ) . with delay time @xmath12 ns , the power spectral density of the beat signal is shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ spectrum ] ( a ) . in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ spectrum ] ( b ) , we calculate the autocorrelation function @xmath13 from the power density spectrum in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ spectrum ] ( a ) using wiener - khintchine theorem @xcite . without any post - processing , the autocorrelation of the laser source sampled by 8-bit adc at @xmath14 mhz ( time delay @xmath15 ns ) is smaller than @xmath16 .    due to the dependence on the external parameters in the experiment , </S>",
    "<S> the sampled original data digitized by an 8-bit adc is biased . to reduce the bias </S>",
    "<S> , we perform a simple exclusive - or post - processing between every two 8-bit original data , which is a common method to improve the randomness of rng @xcite . after the bit extraction , the histogram of the data </S>",
    "<S> is shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ histogram ] ( a ) , well fitted with a gaussian profile . </S>",
    "<S> since truly randomness should have a uniform distributed histogram with shannon entropy of 8 bits per byte , the randomness in this original data is limited by the correlation within the byte . to evaluate the randomness , </S>",
    "<S> we calculate shannon entropy using the experiment results ( histogram data ) : @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is the probability of the data in the @xmath19 digitized bin ( totally @xmath20 bins ) . </S>",
    "<S> this can roughly be viewed as that this data can extract @xmath21 random bits out of every byte using appropriate , yet maybe complicated bit extraction post - processing . to assure that shannon entropy can evaluate the randomness of the source , we calculate the entropy of laser source according to its gaussian fitting curve ( fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ histogram ] ( a ) ) using @xmath22 , where @xmath23 is the standard deviation of gaussian profile . </S>",
    "<S> the result of the entropy of the laser source is @xmath24 bits per byte , and experiments show these two values of shannon entropy get closer when the size of the data is larger .    </S>",
    "<S> to avoid complicated post - processing , adopting @xmath0-least - significant - bit ( @xmath0-lsb ) out of each byte is an efficient method to amplify the randomness . but this method is not strong in eliminating the correlation , and extracting @xmath25-lsb according to shannon entropy can not pass the random tests . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , we change the randomness indicator to min - entropy , @xmath26 , which uses only the maximal probability and represents the worst - case scenario @xcite . by simply adopting the last 6-bit in each byte according to the result , @xmath27 bits per byte , the histogram of the new random bit sequence shows good uniformity ( inset of fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ histogram ] ( a ) ) and represents good randomness . </S>",
    "<S> hence , we can consider shannon entropy and min - entropy , respectively , as the upper and lower estimations of the randomness of the laser source .    for true randomness , </S>",
    "<S> shannon entropy and min - entropy have the same value and both equal @xmath28 bits per byte . in our experiments , after the bit extraction process , the values of these two entropies are amplified to @xmath29 and @xmath30 bits per byte , respectively . to further illustrate the entropy amplification , we calculate the normalized entropy @xmath31 of the random bit sequence before and after bit extraction ( fig . [ histogram ] ( b ) ) , where @xmath32 represents shannon entropy with the length of tested - bit sequences @xmath0 . since shannon entropy holds @xmath33 for true randomness , normalized entropy should be unity for any @xmath0 </S>",
    "<S> . it can be seen from fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ histogram ] ( b ) that , after bit extraction , the entropy of the random bit sequence is amplified and gets much closer to unity .    for randomness tests </S>",
    "<S> , we continuously record a final random bit sequence of 1 gbit , and it passes all three standard random tests , i.e. , ent : a pseudorandom number sequence test program @xcite , diehard : a battery of tests of randomness @xcite , and nist - sts : the national institute of standards and technology - statistical test suite @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the ent results are : entropy @xmath34 bit per bit ( the optimum compression would reduce the bit file by @xmath35 ) . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath36 distribution is @xmath37 ( randomly would exceed this value less than @xmath38 of the times ) . </S>",
    "<S> arithmetic mean value of data bits is @xmath39 ( @xmath40 random ) . </S>",
    "<S> monte carlo value for @xmath41 is @xmath42 . </S>",
    "<S> serial correlation coefficient is @xmath43 . </S>",
    "<S> the results of diehard and sts test are shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ tests ] ( a ) and ( b ) , respectively .    in summary </S>",
    "<S> , we implement a simple and compact trng based on the measurement of the laser phase noise , which passes all three standard statistical random tests . to amplify the entropy </S>",
    "<S> , we estimate the maximal bits that can be extracted from each sampled byte by lsb - adoption , and realize a @xmath1 mbps truly random number generation rate .    </S>",
