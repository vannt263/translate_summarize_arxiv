    "quantum transport property of two - dimensional(2d ) systems in strong magnetic fields has been one of the central issues of the condensed matter physics .",
    "much work has been performed in connection with the quantum hall effect @xcite .",
    "recent discovery of the quantum hall effect in graphene @xcite also stimulates the theoretical interest .",
    "when the system is in a strong magnetic field , the so - called edge states are formed along the boundaries of the system @xcite .",
    "the edge state corresponds to the classical skipping orbit along the boundary and is known to be less influenced by impurities and defects of the system @xcite .",
    "it thus plays an important role in the quantum transport of a two - dimensional system in a strong magnetic field .",
    "numerical studies of the electron states of two - dimensional systems in a strong magnetic field in the presence of boundaries have already been performed by many authors @xcite .",
    "it has been shown that the edge state is well defined and is extended along the boundary as long as its energy lies away from those of the bulk landau subbands and the magnetic fields are strong enough .",
    "on the other hand , when its energy lies in the middle of the bulk landau subbands , the edge state mixes with the bulk states by the impurity scattering , which leads to the localization of edge states @xcite .",
    "recently , it has been demonstrated for the case of long quantum hall wires with uncorrelated disorder potential that the conductance indeed vanishes when the fermi energy is close to the centers of the bulk landau subbands @xcite .",
    "the vanishing conductance can be understood as the consequence of the mixing between the bulk states and the edge states having opposite current directions at each end of the system , as has been confirmed by a quantitative comparison with analytical results .",
    "this transition between a quantized conductance and the insulator is called the chiral metal - insulator transition(cmit ) @xcite .    in the present paper ,",
    "the effect of potential correlation in such systems is investigated numerically .",
    "the potential correlation is , in general , important for the transport in low dimensions , since in some cases it changes the localization behavior drastically . for a carbon nanotube",
    ", it has been shown that the potential correlation leads to the absence of back scattering @xcite . even for pure 1d systems , dimer type correlation or long - range correlation of potential",
    "gives rise to delocalized states @xcite .",
    "for the two - dimensional bulk system in a magnetic field , the effect of potential correlation has also been studied based on the continuum model @xcite as well as the tight - binding model @xcite .",
    "it has been demonstrated that the mixing between edge states is suppressed by the potential correlation @xcite . in the analysis on the critical states of the landau bands",
    ", it is seen that the critical energies are insensitive to the potential correlation as long as the strength of the disorder is weak @xcite .",
    "it may then be expected naively that cmit observed for the uncorrelated potential is suppressed and the quantized conductance steps are recovered when the potential correlation is introduced .",
    "we find indeed the suppression of cmit which yields the recovery of the quantized conductance steps .",
    "quite unexpectedly , however , it is found that the localization length associated with the edge states is suppressed by the potential correlation .",
    "this causes the shift of the quantized conductance steps toward higher energies .",
    "it is remarkable that the potential correlation suppresses the conduction of wires , since the potential correlation is usually expected to enhance the conduction of the system .",
    "we find that the scale of the shift is of the order of the strength of random potential and is insensitive to the strength of the magnetic field as long as the landau levels are well defined . on the other hand , no shift appears in the square geometry .",
    "it is therefore necessary to analyze the effect of potential correlation on the edge states in long wires to understand these shifts of conductance plateaus .",
    "we adopt the tight - binding model described by the following hamiltonian on the square lattice @xmath0 where @xmath1 denotes the creation(annihilation ) operator of an electron on the site @xmath2 .",
    "the summation of the phases @xmath3 around a plaquette is equal to @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the magnetic flux through the plaquette and @xmath6 stands for the flux quantum . the elementary charge and the planck constant are denoted by @xmath7 and @xmath8 , respectively .",
    "all length - scales are measured in units of the lattice spacing .",
    "the site energies @xmath9 are assumed to be distributed with the gaussian probability density @xmath10 and to have the spatial correlation as @xmath11 here @xmath12 and @xmath13 are the parameters which determine the strength of the random potential and the strength of its spatial correlation , respectively . the position vector for the site @xmath2",
    "is denoted by @xmath14 .",
    "the spatially correlated potential is made from the uncorrelated potential @xmath15 s as @xcite @xmath16 when the uncorrelated potential @xmath15 s obey the gaussian distribution with variance @xmath12 , it is easy to verify that @xmath17 satisfies the relations in eqs.([gauss ] ) and ( [ corr1 ] ) .",
    "the parameter @xmath13 , therefore , represents the range of the impurity potential . in the following , we specify the disorder strength by a parameter @xmath18 , since it can be regarded as the effective width of the potential distribution .",
    "we consider a system with the length @xmath19 and the width @xmath20 .",
    "two leads are attached to both ends of the system and the fixed boundary condition is assumed in the transverse direction . for the realization of the isotropic correlation for @xmath17 in the sample region @xmath21 , we consider the additional regions of the width @xmath22 outside of the sample region in performing the summation over @xmath15 in eq.([sum ] ) .",
    "the two - terminal conductance @xmath23 is obtained by means of the landauer formula @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the transmission matrix .",
    "we adopt the transfer matrix method@xcite to evaluate the transmission matrix . throughout the present analysis",
    ", we consider an independent impurity configuration for each value of energy @xmath26 and @xmath13 .",
    "the width @xmath20 is set to be 20 .",
    "the smallest magnetic flux @xmath27 per plaquette is @xmath28 , and the corresponding magnetic length @xmath29 is about @xmath30 , much smaller than the system width @xmath20 .",
    "this leads to the existence of edge states along the boundaries .",
    "we first show the results of conductance for @xmath31 and @xmath32 in fig .",
    "the length of the system is @xmath33 . in the absence of potential correlation ( @xmath34 )",
    ", we see the chiral metal - insulator transition as a function of energies .",
    "the conductance peaks at energies @xmath35 and @xmath36 are the contributions from the lowest and the 2nd lowest landau bands , respectively . it is clearly seen that these peaks disappear for @xmath37 and that the quantized conductance steps are recovered for @xmath38 . it is to be noted here that the recovery starts at @xmath39 . since the contribution from the lowest landau band starts at @xmath40 for the case of @xmath34 , the conductance steps can be understood as being shifted toward higher energies with an amount of @xmath41 in the presence of long potential correlation .    , @xmath42 and @xmath33 as a function of the range of the impurity potential @xmath13 and the fermi energy @xmath43 . in the present system ,",
    "ratio of the with @xmath20 to the magnetic length @xmath44 is @xmath45 .",
    "[ fig1 ] ]    in order to see the shift more clearly , we examine the conductance in the cases of stronger magnetic fields @xmath46 and @xmath47 . in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , the results for @xmath46 are shown .",
    "the length of systems is assumed to be @xmath48 .",
    "here it is clearly seen that the conductance plateaus shift toward higher energies as the correlation length @xmath13 is increased . in both cases ,",
    "the scale of the shifts in the presence of the long correlation turns out to be approximately @xmath49 insensitive to the magnetic fields .",
    "we also evaluate the conductance for @xmath50 , namely for the square system .",
    "it is then found that no shift appears in that case .",
    "this is consistent with the result for the 2d bulk system that the levitation of critical states due to the potential correlation for the present range of disorder strength ( @xmath51 ) is much smaller than the present scale of the shifts of conductance plateaus @xcite .",
    "the present shift of conductance plateaus is thus a specific feature to long wires , suggesting that the shift arises from the one - dimensional character of the system rather than the 2d bulk properties .",
    "apart from the shift of plateaus , it is also confirmed that cmit fades away for larger values of @xmath52 .",
    "detailed energy dependencies of the conductance in the presence of potential correlation ( @xmath53 ) and that in its absence ( @xmath54 ) are shown in fig . [ fig3 ] .",
    "it is clearly seen that the shifts are common to these three plateaus and cmit observed for @xmath54 @xcite disappears for @xmath55 .",
    "the random jumps between the quantized plateaus for @xmath55 are fluctuations due to different realizations of disorder potential .",
    "it should be emphasized that the conductance plateau transitions occur away from the peaks of the density of states in the case of @xmath56 .     for @xmath57 and @xmath58 as a function of the potential range @xmath13 and the fermi energy @xmath43 .",
    "the magnetic flux @xmath27 is assumed to be @xmath59 .",
    "the magnetic length @xmath60 and accordingly @xmath61 .",
    "[ fig2 ] ]     for @xmath54 ( @xmath62 ) and @xmath63 ( @xmath64 ) in the case of @xmath57 , @xmath65 and @xmath58 . for @xmath56 , @xmath66",
    "is plotted instead of @xmath67 .",
    "conductance @xmath68 for @xmath69 is also calculated and @xmath70 is plotted as a solid line .",
    "the density of states ( dos ) for @xmath56 obtained by the green s function method @xcite is plotted as a dotted curve .",
    "[ fig3 ] ]    in order to clarify how the scale of the shift depends on @xmath71 , we calculate the conductance also for @xmath72 and @xmath73 in the case of @xmath58 and @xmath74 .",
    "we obtain the shift to be @xmath75 and @xmath76 , respectively .",
    "these results suggest that the scale of the shift is in proportion to @xmath71 .",
    "the shift of plateaus means that the edge states which are transmitted in the case of @xmath34 are reflected for @xmath77 .",
    "the localization length in the case of @xmath77 must therefore be much smaller than that in the case of @xmath34 .",
    "this is surprising since the potential correlation normally reduces the electron localization .",
    "we thus examine the effect of potential correlation on the localization length along the wire in the presence of edge states .",
    "the localization length @xmath78 estimated by the transfer matrix method @xcite is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] for @xmath46 and various values of @xmath13 . here",
    "we clearly see that the localization length @xmath78 is much shorter than the system length @xmath79 for the energies @xmath80 in the presence of potential correlation .",
    "this is consistent with the vanishing conductivity in the presence of long potential correlation for energies lower than @xmath81 in figs .",
    "[ fig2 ] and [ fig3 ] .    , @xmath82 , @xmath83 and @xmath84 .",
    "the disorder and the magnetic field are assumed to be @xmath57 and @xmath85 , respectively .",
    "the magnetic length is @xmath60 .",
    "now we show the present shift of conductance plateaus can be understood as a semi - classical effect .",
    "it is useful to recall here the fact that the edge state is reflected by the potential barrier when its energy measured from the corresponding landau level @xmath86 is smaller than the energy of the potential barrier @xcite , where @xmath87 denotes the cyclotron frequency .",
    "this suggests that the shift of conductance plateaus also occurs in the presence of potential barrier across the wire instead of disorder potential .",
    "we have confirmed in the present lattice model that the shifts expected in the continuum model indeed occur when the thickness of the barrier is larger than the magnetic length .    with this property of the edge states ,",
    "it is natural to expect that the edge states having lower energies ( @xmath88 ) are deformed considerably by the correlated potential varying with scales larger than the magnetic length , because such a potential would act as a local potential barrier . due to the deformation of the edge state trajectory , in certain region of a long sample ,",
    "the effective width of the sample becomes narrow enough to induce the mixing of edge states with opposite directions , leading to the reflection .",
    "as the potential correlation is increased , the deformation would become larger and the probability for the reflection of edge states is likely to increase , accordingly .",
    "the same order of the shift ( @xmath89 ) in each plateau transition is also naturally understood since @xmath90 determines the probability of reflection .",
    "the above semi - classical argument is consistent with our results that the shift becomes significant when the potential range @xmath91 is large enough and that in the long correlation limit , it saturates around @xmath92 which is effectively the maximum of the potential energy ( fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ) .",
    "it would also account for the fact that the contributions from the lowest and the 2nd lowest landau levels vanish when the potential range @xmath13 approaches to the order of the magnetic length in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] . in the presence of long potential correlation",
    ", it is thus expected that the conductance steps occur at critical energies @xmath93 in long wires . for certain fixed impurity configurations ,",
    "we have observed complex structure around the critical energy , which is expected to be the resonant tunneling @xcite between edge states .",
    "it is important to note that the mixing of the edge states at one place of the wire would be enough to reflect the whole current associated with them .",
    "the probability to have such a place in a particular sample apparently depends on the length of the wire .",
    "it is natural that there is no shift in the case of the short system ( @xmath50 ) since such probability is very small .",
    "the probability @xmath94 to have high potential regions across the wire in a sample is estimated as @xmath95 for a small @xmath96 which is the probability that the potential energy in the box of the size @xmath13 is larger than @xmath90 . requiring @xmath94 is to be of order of unity , we get @xmath97 which suggests that @xmath20 must be practically several times @xmath13 or less to observe these phenomena . in reality , when the magnetic field is @xmath98 , the magnetic length is @xmath99 , and the present systems correspond to wires whose width @xmath20 is in the range @xmath100 .",
    "the present numerical results suggest that the shift of conductance plateaus can be observed when @xmath101 and @xmath102 .    in summary",
    ", we have investigated the effect of potential correlation in quantum hall wires .",
    "it has been shown clearly that the potential correlation shifts the quantized conductance plateaus toward higher energies .",
    "the scale of the shifts is of the order of the strength of the random potential .",
    "this shift is specific to systems with the wire geometry and is insensitive to the strength of the magnetic fields .",
    "this phenomenon is related to the transport property of edge states in the presence of long potential correlation .",
    "we have argued that the potential correlation enhances the mixing of the edge states at the opposite edges , which yields the reflection of edge channels . for correlated potential , the positions of the conductance plateau transitions in quantum hall wires do not necessarily coincide with the positions of the bulk landau levels .",
    "the chiral metal - insulator transition is absent when the potential correlation is much larger than the magnetic length of the system .",
