    "atomic bose - einstein condensates ( becs ) have received a great deal of interest since they were first produced a decade ago @xcite . they can exhibit various topological excitations , such as vortices and solitons .",
    "the dynamics of solitons in elongated becs @xcite is the atom - optics version of the nonlinear propagation of light pulses in optical fibres @xcite .",
    "the bec offers a remarkable freedom in terms of controlling the physical parameters such as dimensionality and even the sign of the strength of the atom - atom interaction @xcite .",
    "solitons in becs can be of both dark and bright type .",
    "dark solitons are formed in becs with repulsive interaction between the atoms @xcite . for completely dark solitons",
    "the condensate wavefunction is zero at the centre and changes its sign then crossing the central point , i.e.  the condensate wave - function has an infinitely steep @xmath0 phase slip at the centre @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the bright solitons are formed in becs with repulsive interaction between the atoms .",
    "the wave - function of the bec is then localised at the centre @xcite and goes to zero further away from this point .",
    "the dark solitons which manifests themselves as a density minimum moving with a constant speed against a uniform background density , as well as bright solitons which are shape preserving wave packets , have both been experimentally realised @xcite .",
    "the dynamics of solitons in becs has been extensively studied .",
    "this has included investigations of the stability properties @xcite , as well as soliton dynamics in inhomogeneous clouds @xcite , in multicomponent becs @xcite and in supersonic flow @xcite .",
    "solitons can be created in various ways with a variable degree of controllability , e.g. , by colliding clouds of bec @xcite or engineering the density @xcite .",
    "traditionally dark solitons in becs are created using phase imprinting @xcite , where a part of the condensate cloud is illuminated by a far detuned laser pulse in order to induce a sharp @xmath0 phase slip in the wave function .",
    "the subsequent dynamics can indeed develop solitons @xcite .",
    "there are , however , some rather severe drawbacks with such a method of phase engineering .",
    "the resolution of the required phase slip is naturally restricted by the diffraction limit , i.e.  the width of the phase slip should be larger than an optical wave - length .",
    "furthermore the phase imprinting does not produce a density minimum characteristic to the dark solitons in the region of the phase change .",
    "hence completely dark stationary solitons are difficult to achieve , which consequently results in so called grey moving solitons with a shallow density dip .",
    "it is of a significant interest to be able to create slowly moving , or even completely stationary solitons in order to test for instance their scattering properties .",
    "the shapes of the colliding solitons are to be preserved .",
    "in addition , a relative spatial shift is expected .",
    "this spatial shift , however , can only be detected for extremely slow solitons due to the inherent logarithmic dependence of the spatial shift on the relative velocity between the solitons @xcite .",
    "the standard phase imprinting also inevitably creates phonons in the trapped cloud because the constructed initial state is not the exact soliton solution largely due to the missing density notch @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we show how states which have the required phase slip and density profile for solitons can be created by sweeping three laser beams through an elongated bec as shown in fig .",
    "if one of the beams is in the first order ( tem10 ) hermite - gaussian mode , its amplitude has a transversal @xmath0 phase slip which will be transferred to atoms thus producing a soliton .",
    "more importantly , with a sequence of three laser beams it is possible to circumvent the restriction set by the diffraction limit .",
    "the laser fields reshape an atomic wave - function so that it acquires a zero - point .",
    "this leads to a hole in the atomic density , the width of which is only limited by the intensity ratios between the incident laser beams due to the geometric nature @xcite of the process .",
    "the formation of the hole is accompanied by a step - like ( infinitely sharp ) @xmath0 phase slip in the atomic wave - function when crossing the zero - point .",
    "the method is particularly useful for creating multicomponent ( vector ) solitons of the dark - bright form as well as the dark - dark combination .",
    "in addition it is possible to create in a controllable way two or more slowly moving dark solitons close to each other for studying their collisional properties .",

    ", we propose to sweep three incident laser beams across the condensate .",
    "the laser beams interact with the condensate atoms in a tripod configuration @xcite , i.e.  the atoms are characterized by three ground states @xmath5 , @xmath6 , @xmath7 and an excited state @xmath8 .",
    "the @xmath9-th laser drives resonantly the atomic transition between the ground state @xmath10 and the excited state @xmath8 , see fig .",
    "initially the atoms forming the bec are prepared in the hyperfine ground state @xmath5 .",
    "subsequently the lasers are swept through the bec in the @xmath11-direction , i.e.  perpendicular to the longitudinal axis @xmath4 of the condensate .",
    "the sweeping process is made of two stages depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig1]b . in the first stage",
    "the lasers @xmath12 and @xmath13 are applied in a counter - intuitive sequence to transfer adiabatically the atoms from the ground state @xmath5 to another ground state @xmath6 .",
    "if an additional laser @xmath14 is on during the first stage , a partial transfer of atoms from the ground states @xmath5 to @xmath6 is possible @xcite . in that case",
    "a coherent superposition of states @xmath5 and @xmath6 is created after completing the first stage . in the second stage ,",
    "the lasers @xmath12 , @xmath13 and @xmath14 are applied once again to transfer atoms from the state @xmath6 back to the state @xmath5 and from the state @xmath5 to the state @xmath6 .",
    "if the amplitude of one of these lasers @xmath15 or @xmath16 changes the sign at @xmath17 , the bec picks up a @xmath0 phase shift at this point after the sweeping , and a soliton can be formed .",
    "this is the case e.g.  if one of the beams is the first order hermite - gaussian beam centered at @xmath18 .",
    "it is important to realize that at least two laser fields are needed to complete the adiabatic transfer of population between the ground states .",
    "therefore the adiabaticity can be violated in the vicinity of the point @xmath17 where one of the rabi frequencies @xmath15 or @xmath16 goes to zero .",
    "inclusion of the third ( support ) laser @xmath14 helps to avoid such a violation of the adiabaticity .",
    "in fact the atoms would experience absorption in the vicinity of @xmath17 if the support laser @xmath14 was missing during the second stage .",
    "it should be mentioned that there are similar previous proposals for creating vortices in a bec via the two - laser raman processes involving the transfer of an optical vortex to the atoms @xcite . in these schemes",
    "the lasers are far detuned from the single - photon resonance to avoid the absorption at the vortex core . in our scheme",
    "the lasers are in an exact single - photon resonance , so the use of the third ( support ) laser is essential to avoid the losses .",
    "an advantage of the resonant scheme is that an efficient and complete population transfer is possible between the hyperfine ground states , whereas in the non - resonant case only a fraction of population can be transferred @xcite .",
    "let us now provide a quantitative description of our scheme .",
    "the @xmath9-th laser beam is characterised by the complex rabi frequency @xmath19 , with @xmath20 , where @xmath21 is the real amplitude , the phase being comprised of the local phase @xmath22 as well as the global ( distance - independent ) phase @xmath23 . in what follows , the rabi frequencies @xmath16 and @xmath24 are considered to be positive : @xmath25 , @xmath26 . yet",

    "this can be done either by shifting in the transversal ( @xmath11 ) direction the laser beams propagating along the @xmath67 axis or by applying a set of laser pulses of the appropriate shape and sequence propagating in the @xmath11 direction . in the latter case ,",
    "the sweeping velocity @xmath68 will coincide with the speed of light . in both cases",
    "the adiabatic dark states depend on time in the following way : @xmath69 , where @xmath70 is the atomic coordinate in the frame of the moving laser fields .",
    "let us assume that the time , @xmath71 , it takes to sweep the laser beams through a bec of the width @xmath72 , is small compared to the time associated with the bec chemical potential @xmath73 which is typically of the order of @xmath74 .",
    "in that case one can neglect the dynamics of the atomic centre of mass during the sweeping .",

    "<S> we propose a new method of creating solitons in elongated bose - einstein condensates ( becs ) by sweeping three laser beams through the bec . </S>",
    "<S> if one of the beams is in the first order ( tem10 ) hermite - gaussian mode , its amplitude has a transversal @xmath0 phase slip which can be transferred to the atoms creating a soliton . using this method it is possible to circumvent the restriction set by the diffraction limit inherent to conventional methods such as phase imprinting . </S>",
    "<S> the method allows one to create multicomponent ( vector ) solitons of the dark - bright form as well as the dark - dark combination . </S>",
