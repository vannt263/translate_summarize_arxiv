    "quantum mechanics and relativity are two pillars of modern physics . recent developments of quantum information science revealed that quantum mechanics and relativity miraculously cooperate so as not to violate each other .",
    "for example , one can obtain a quantum mechanical state discrimination bound ( helstrom bound ) from the no - signaling condition of the special relativity  @xcite .",
    "this connection is very surprising , because a quantum mechanical phenomenon is stochastic while relativity is deterministic .",
    "furthermore , the holographic principle  @xcite or ads / cft correspondence  @xcite also asserts an unexpected connection between classical gravity in bulk and quantum mechanics on its surface .",
    "the origin of this mysterious connection is also still unknown .",
    "although quantum mechanics is experimentally and mathematically well established , its origin is not identified .",
    "for example , we do not know the origin of quantum randomness which leads to many paradoxes of quantum mechanics such as epr paradox .",
    "this situation gave rise to numerous interpretations of quantum mechanics from the copenhagen interpretation to the many worlds interpretation .",
    "one of the viable interpretations is information theoretic interpretation  @xcite , in which information about physical events plays a central role .",
    "for example , zeilinger and brukner  @xcite introduced a notion of information space to describe quantum phenomena and suggested that quantum randomness aries from the discreteness of information ( i.e. , bits )",
    ".    why does physics have something to do with information ?",
    "there are several hints for this question .",
    "landauer s principle in quantum information science states that to erase information of a system irreversibly , energy should be consumed  @xcite .",
    "this means information is physical . in a series of works",
    "@xcite , based on this principle and quantum entanglement theory , the author and colleagues suggested that information is the key to understand the origins of dark energy  @xcite , black hole mass  @xcite and even einstein gravity  @xcite .",
    "for example , it is suggested that a cosmic causal horizon with a radius @xmath0 has temperature @xmath1 , quantum informational entropy @xmath2 and hence a kind of thermal energy @xmath3 which is comparable to dark energy observed  @xcite .",
    "here , @xmath4 is the reduced planck mass and @xmath5 is hubble parameter . on the other hand , jacobson  @xcite wrote a seminar paper linking the einstein gravity to thermodynamics at rindler horizons using the first law of thermodynamics @xmath6 .",
    "recently , verlinde  @xcite ( see also  @xcite ) suggested fascinating ideas linking gravitational force to entropic force and derived newton s second law and the einstein equation using similar horizon energy . this brought many related studies  @xcite . in",
    "@xcite lee suggested that jacobson s",
    "@xcite gravity theory or the quantum informational  @xcite theory can explain verlinde s formalism of entropic gravity by identifying the holographic screen to be rindler horizons for accelerating observers .",
    "( see also  @xcite ) .    considering all these recent developments , it is plausible that quantum mechanics and gravity has information as a common ingredient , and information is the key to explain the strange connection between two .",
    "if gravity and newton mechanics can be derived by considering information at rindler horizons , it is natural to think quantum mechanics might have a similar origin . in this paper , along this line , it is suggested that quantum field theory ( qft ) and quantum mechanics can be obtained from information theory applied to causal ( rindler ) horizons , and that quantum randomness aries from information blocking by the horizons .    in sec .",
    "ii the connection between qft and information theory is suggested . in sec .",
    "iii the connection between our theory and verlinde s theory is investigated .",
    "section iv contains discussions .",
    "basic assumptions in this paper are followings .",
    "first , we assume that the speed of information propagation ( i.e. , the light velocity @xmath7 ) is finite and , hence , there are causal horizons .",
    "second , information is a fundamental ingredient of physics .",
    "that is , physics should reflect information possessed by observers .",
    "third , we assume the general principle of relativity ( @xmath8 general relativity of einstein ) stating that all observers are equivalent with respect to the formulation of the fundamental laws of physics  @xcite .",
    "finally , we also assume some notions of classical information theory , spacetime , and its coordinate transformations .",
    "let us begin by considering an accelerating observer @xmath9 with acceleration @xmath10 in @xmath11 direction in a flat spacetime with coordinates @xmath12 ( see fig .",
    "1 ) . the rindler coordinates @xmath13 for the observer are defined with [ rindler ] t= r   sinh ( a ) ,   x_1= r  cosh ( a ) on the rindler wedges .",
    "there is an inertial observer @xmath14 too .",
    "now , consider a field @xmath15 crossing the rindler horizon at a point @xmath16 ( actually , a two dimensional surface in @xmath17 direction ) and entering the future wedge @xmath18 . a configuration for @xmath19",
    "is not necessarily meant to be classical but to be a function of spacetime carrying information .",
    "( curved line ) , who has no accessible information about field @xmath15 in a causally disconnected region @xmath18 .",
    "the observer can only estimate a probabilistic distribution of the field , which turns out to be equal to that of a quantum field for inertial observer @xmath14 ( dashed line ) in minkowski spacetime .",
    ", scaledwidth=30.0% ]    as the field enters the rinder horizon for the observer @xmath9 , the observer shall have no more information about future configurations of @xmath15 and all what the observer can expect about @xmath15 evolution is a probabilistic distribution @xmath20 $ ] of @xmath15 beyond the horizon .",
    "already known information about @xmath15 becomes constraints for the distribution .",
    "i suggest that this ignorance is the origin of quantum randomness .",
    "according to our assumptions , information is fundamental in this theory , and what determines the physics in the wedge @xmath18 is not a deterministic classical physics but the evolution of information itself .",
    "thus , in this conjecture , the physics in the wedge should reflect the ignorance of the observer @xmath9 about the field configurations , and there should not be a priori deterministic classical value for @xmath15 .",
    "that means for the observers there is no ` objective physical reality ' such as classical fields before measurements .",
    "this is the main conjecture in this paper , which naturally follows if we accept our assumptions .",
    "this situation can be mathematically analyzed with classical information theory .",
    "the maximum ignorance about the field can be expressed by maximizing the shannon information entropy @xmath21 $ ] of the possible ( discrete ) configurations @xmath22 that the field may take beyond the horizon with probability @xmath23 $ ] .",
    "a uniform probability distribution may be adequate when there is no information about the events represented by random variables @xmath24 .",
    "however , if there is a priori information available represented by @xmath25 testable expectations ( not a quantum expectation yet ) [ constraint ] f_k_i=1^n p[_i ] f_k[_i ] ,  ( k=1l ) , we should use the principle of maximum entropy by boltzmann to calculate the probability distribution @xmath26 $ ] . here",
    ", @xmath27 is a function of @xmath24 and @xmath28 is its expectation value with respect to @xmath26 $ ] . according to the theorem , by maximizing the shannon entropy [ hp ] h[p]=-_i=1^n p[_i ] ln p[_i ] , with the constraints in eq .",
    "( [ constraint ] ) one can obtain the following probability distribution p[_i]= exp with a normalization constant ( partition function ) @xmath29 , $ ] where @xmath30 s are lagrangian multipliers satisfying the following relation @xmath31 thus , the usual maxwell - boltzman distribution is a natural consequence of classical information theory , when there is information loss with constraints .",
    "lisi  @xcite suggested a related derivation of the partition function by assuming a ` universal action reservoir ' .",
    "what constraints can we impose on the motion of the field crossing the horizon ?",
    "one constraint may come from the energy conservation _",
    "i=1^n p[_i]h(_i ) = e , where @xmath32 is the hamiltonian as a function of the field @xmath33 and @xmath34 is its expectation .",
    "this comes from the fact that the energy expectation value of the field should not change .",
    "another trivial one is the unity of the probabilities @xmath35 = 1 .",
    "$ ] then , from the above theorem , the probability estimated by the rindler observer , subject to these constraints , should be [ p ] p[_i ] = , where @xmath36 is the lagrangian multiplier . here , the partition function is [ z ] z = _ i=1^n = tr   e^-h , and the trace",
    "is assumed to be performed with a ( classical ) discrete vector basis .",
    "below , we shall take a continuum limit .",
    "it is important to recall that the field @xmath15 can not have a specific value before measurements according to our assumptions .",
    "the classical field theory could be obtained through extremization of @xmath23 $ ] after establishing a qft later .",
    "what is assumed here is that for both of the observers @xmath14 and @xmath9 , @xmath15 could have arbitrary values before measurements .",
    "@xmath37 represents this uncertainty .    as an example , let us consider a scalar field with hamiltonian h()=d^3 x with potential @xmath38 .",
    "@xmath5 alone , without a guiding principle , does not fully give us dynamics , neither classical nor quantum .",
    "for the rindler observer with the coordinates @xmath39 the proper time variance is @xmath40 and hence the hamiltonian is changed to h_r = _ r>0 dr dx _   ar [ ( ) ^2 + ( ) ^2 + ( _ ) ^2 + v ( ) ] , where @xmath41 denotes the plane orthogonal to @xmath42 plane .",
    "then , eq . (",
    "[ z ] ) becomes eq .",
    "( 2.5 ) of ref .",
    "@xcite ; [ z_r ] z_r = tr   e^-h_r .",
    "it is important to notice that @xmath37 ( and hence @xmath43 ) here is not a quantum partition function but a statistical partition function yet .",
    "@xmath43 simply represents the statistical system corresponding to the uncertain field configurations beyond the horizon .",
    "now , we need to show @xmath43 is equivalent to a quantum partition function . fortunately , this is already done in ref .",
    "@xcite . based on qft , in the reference",
    ", it was shown that the real - time thermal green s functions of the rindler observer with @xmath43 are equivalent to the vacuum green s function in minkowski coordinates .",
    "( see  @xcite for a review . )",
    "thus , as well known , the minkowski vacuum is equivalent to thermal states for the rindler observers .",
    "what i have newly shown here is that the thermal partition function @xmath43 assumed in ref .",
    "@xcite is from information loss about field configurations beyond the rindler horizon and , therefore , the qft formalism is equivalent to the purely information theoretic formalism suggested in this paper . recall that eq .",
    "( [ z_r ] ) was derived without using any quantum physics in this paper . since quantum mechanics",
    "can be thought to be single particle limit of qft , this implies also that quantum mechanics emerges from information theory applied to rindler horizons and is not fundamental .",
    "although the reasoning is simple , conclusions can be far - reaching .",
    "to be concrete , it is worthy to briefly repeat the calculation in ref .",
    "there , it was shown by analytical continuation that in the rindler coordinates @xmath43 is @xmath44 equivalent to z_r & = & & & n_0_(0)=( ) d  exp\\{-_0^ d _",
    "r>0 dr dx _   ar & & } , where we explicitly denoted a constant @xmath45 having a dimension of @xmath46 for a dimensional reason .",
    "thus , @xmath47 .",
    "the trace turned into the periodic boundary condition @xmath48 as usual . by further changing integration variables as @xmath49 and choosing @xmath50 the region of integration",
    "is transformed from @xmath51 into the full two dimensional flat space @xmath52 .",
    "of course , this specific @xmath53 value leads to unruh temperature @xmath54 , where @xmath55 is the boltzman constant . from the well - known qft result ,",
    "one can find @xmath56 to be @xmath57 . since @xmath58 is from the lagrange multiplier @xmath36 ,",
    "the planck constant @xmath57 is associated with the change of @xmath43 by energy change , that is , @xmath57 is some fundamental temperature given by nature .",
    "then , the partition function becomes z^e_q & = & n_1 d  exp\\{- dd dx _   [ ( ) ^2 & + & ( ) ^2 + ( _ ) ^2 + v ( ) ] } & = & n_1 d  exp\\{- } .    where @xmath59 is the euclidean action for the scalar field in the inertial frame . by analytic continuation @xmath60 , one can see @xmath61 becomes the usual zero temperature quantum mechanical partition function @xmath62 for @xmath15 . since both of @xmath43 and @xmath62 can be obtained from @xmath61 by analytic continuation , they are physically equivalent as pointed out in ref .",
    "a partition function contains all information about a statistical system .",
    "thus , it is enough to show the equivalence of two partition functions to prove the equivalence of qft and the information theoretic model suggested in this paper , once we accept the information theoretic origin of @xmath43 . of course",
    ", one can reverse the logic and obtain @xmath37 in eq .",
    "( [ z_r ] ) from @xmath62 .",
    "now we see that quantum fluctuations correspond to the ignorance of rindler observers about the fields beyond rindler horizons .",
    "it is straightforward to extend the previous analysis to quantum mechanics for point particles .",
    "we can imagine a point particle at a point @xmath16 just crossing the rindler horizon and entering the future wedge @xmath18 .",
    "like the case of the field , the rindler observer gets no more information from the particle .",
    "this maximal ignorance is represented by probability distribution @xmath63 $ ] for the i - th possible path that the particle may take .",
    "has no more information about paths of the particle crossing the horizon ( shaded region ) and all what the observer can expect about the particle is a probabilistic distribution of its motion .",
    "this seems to be the origin of quantum randomness of the motion . here ,",
    "@xmath64 and @xmath65 represent slits for a typical double - slit experiment.,scaledwidth=40.0% ]    then , the partition function is [ zr ] z_r = _ i=1^n = tr   e^-h , where @xmath5 is the point particle hamiltonian now . since the usual point",
    "particle quantum mechanics is a non - relativistic and single particle limit of the quantum field theory , we expect @xmath43 is equal to the quantum partition function for the particle with mass @xmath66 in minkowski spacetime z_q & = & & & n_2dx & = & n_1 dx  exp\\{- i(x_i ) } , where @xmath67 is the action . then , as is well known one can associate each path @xmath68 with a wave function @xmath69 , which leads to schrdinger equation for @xmath70  @xcite .",
    "this interpretation could shed a new light on the paradoxical behaviors of quantum particles .",
    "for example , consider the double slit experiment .",
    "the rindler observer @xmath9 , having no access to the information about paths of the particle , could not say which path of two slits ( a or b ) in fig .",
    "2 was chosen by the particle .",
    "otherwise , it will violate the no - signaling principle . according to our conjecture , physics in the wedge",
    "@xmath18 should reflect this ignorance .",
    "thus , the particle could not have a deterministic path before measurement .",
    "on the other hand , the observer @xmath14 who can measure the paths , after he or she enters the horizon ( for this observer light cones play a role of causal horizons . ) , has a chance to know the  which - way \" information .",
    "this could induce the  wave function collapse \" . according to our theory ,",
    "wave functions or states are neither particles nor physical waves but just probability functions about information , thus there is no need for a concern regarding immediate superluminal changes of wavefuncions .",
    "this theory also gives some new insights on the origin of verlinde s entropic gravity theory . in his papers identities of information and its entropy",
    "are not so clearly given .",
    "therefore , there are several concerns  @xcite on the assumptions verlinde took .",
    "two important concerns are about the origin of the entropy variation formula ( eq .",
    "( [ ds ] ) below ) and identity of the holographic screen .    according to our theory",
    "the entropy which is associated with the entropic force is the entropy @xmath71 $ ] about unobservable paths , estimated by the rindler observers .",
    "culetu  @xcite pointed out that if the screen plays the role of a local rindler horizon at @xmath72 , verlinde s entropy formula can be explained .",
    "this interpretation is in accordance with lee et al s proposal  @xcite that the einstein equation represents information erasing process at rindler horizons .",
    "the results in this paper enhance these interpretations .",
    "for the observer at @xmath72 , the rindler hamiltonian becomes a physical hamiltonian generating @xmath73 translation  @xcite .",
    "thus , this distance @xmath74 is special .",
    "the observer shall have no more path information of the non - relativistic particle with mass @xmath66 crossing the horizon . in this case",
    "the loss of information of the particle results in the horizon entropy @xmath75 increase  @xcite as [ ds ] s_h== , which is just the entropy variation verlinde assumed .",
    "here , we used the unruh temperature and the horizon energy variation @xmath76 due to the holographic principle .",
    "once we obtain this formula , it is straightforward to reproduce newton s equation and gravity in verlinde s formalism with the equipartition energy law .",
    "the maximum entropy proposal in verlinde s theory can be also understood in this way . from eq .",
    "( [ zr ] ) free energy can be expressed as f=- ln z_r .",
    "the classical path corresponds to the saddle point approximation ( @xmath77 )  @xcite ff_cl= - ( -i_e(x_cl))=i_e(x_cl ) , where @xmath78 is the euclidean action for classical path satisfying the lagrange equation .",
    "since the maximum entropy is achieved when @xmath18 is minimized , we see that classical physics with the minimum action corresponds to a maximum entropy ( of the paths ) condition , that is , the classical path is the typical path maximizing the entropy @xmath79 $ ] with the constraints for the rindler observer .",
    "the holographic principle demands that the increase of the horizon entropy should be equal to the entropy of the paths of the particle entered .    in short , verlinde s holographic screen is just rindler horizons and its entropy is associated with the lost path information of the particle crossing the horizons  @xcite .",
    "then , there is an entropic force linked to this information loss which can be calculated by using the first law or landauer s principle .",
    "thus , our theory provides a natural model for the entropy and information which verlinde assumed .",
    "in this paper it is shown that if there is a causal boundary for an observer , the observer could expect statistical distribution for physical objects beyond the horizon due to information loss . for another observer who can access the objects this thermal distribution corresponds to just quantum fluctuation .",
    "what are the merits of our new interpretation of quantum physics ?",
    "first , this theory explains the strange connection between quantum mechanics and special relativity such as no - signaling condition in quantum measurements . since our formalism of quantum mechanics itself emerges from the limitation of the information propagation velocity , it is natural that we can not send a classical superluminal signal even with quantum nonlocal correlation ( entanglement ) by any means .",
    "second , from this fact , it might give us a new hint to study of unification of gravity and quantum mechanics .",
    "third , this model could also explain the origin of verlinde s formalism about newton mechanics and gravity .",
    "our theory is in accordance with the quantum informational dark energy model  @xcite too .    in summary",
    ", it is shown that the path integral quantization and quantum randomness can be derived by considering information loss behind rindler horizons .",
    "quantum mechanics is not fundamental and emerges from information theory accompanied with the rindler coordinate transformation .",
    "this implies that quantum mechanics is more about information rather than particles or waves .",
    "thus , now we have some striking relationships among information , gravity , newtonian mechanics , and even quantum mechanics .",
    "information seems to be one of the roots of all physical phenomena .",
