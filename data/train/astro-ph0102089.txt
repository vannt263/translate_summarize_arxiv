    "the microlensing searches , motivated by the study of dark matter in galaxies and its possible fraction of compact objects ( hereafter machos ) , have collected some unprecedented databases of images of neighbouring galaxies , and in particular of the large magellanic cloud ( lmc ) .",
    "the microlensing candidates are compatible with large macho masses , and exhibit long timescale variations , typically 10 - 200 days ( alcock et al .  1997abc , renault et al.1997 , palanque - delabrouille et  al .",

    "possible contamination by variable stars is often suggested ( e.g. della valle @xmath1 livio 1996 ) , but no systematic searches for variable objects have been undertaken so far on the microlensing databases . whereas particular variables , such as rr lyrae and cepheids are relatively well understood , little statistical information is known about the long timescale and long period variable stars ( hereafter lt@xmath1lpv ) , with timescales / periods in the range of @xmath3100 to @xmath3800 days , which are an important stage of stellar evolution .",
    "they are easily rejected for these microlensing searches either with a cut on marginal stellar populations identified on the colour magnitude diagram ( hereafter cmd ) or by their periodicity .",
    "aperiodic signals which do not satisfy these simple criteria are however more difficult to discriminate and to select .    in this paper",
    ", we perform a selection of variable objects on pixel light curves covering a 0.25 deg@xmath4 field of the lmc bar .",
    "we used the pixel light curves produced in melchior et al ( 1999 , hereafter paper i ) adopting looser thresholds than those used for the selection of microlensing events in melchior et al .",

    "we use the eros-1 ccd dataset , taken at eso over the period 1991 december 18 to 1992 april 11 , using a 40  cm telescope with a wide field camera composed of 16 ccd chips , each with 400@xmath5579 pixels of 1.21 arcsec ( arnaud et al .",

    "1994a , b ) was motivated by the study of dark compact objects in the dark halo of our galaxy and contributed to show that the so - called brown dwarves could not be a significant component of the dark matter ( renault et al .",
    "1997 ) .",
    "this dataset , treated in paper  i , is composed of some 1000 images per ccd and per colour spread over 120 days .",
    "only 10 ccd fields were available in 91 - 92 , so we restrict our analysis to this field of 0.25  deg@xmath4 .      for this selection , we use the pixel light curves produced in paper  i , as a first application to the eros data of the pixel method ( baillon et al .",
    "1993 ) . in paper",
    "i , we described in detail the data treatment we applied to the eros-1 data set described in the previous paragraph .",
    "the frames were first geometrically and photometrically aligned with respect to a reference image . in order to decrease the level of noise on these 8 - 12 min exposures , we averaged the 10 - 20 frames available each night . whereas this increases our sensitivity to possibly dim lt@xmath1lpv , _",
    "this is not optimised for the detection of short period variable stars , already studied elsewhere on the same data set ( grison et al 1995 , beaulieu et al .",
    "1995 , hill @xmath1 beaulieu 1997)_.    the data are then arranged in super - pixel light curves , and an empiric seeing correction is then applied to each light curve .",
    "the limitations of this technique reside in the conversion of pixel fluxes in magnitudes , which can be done efficiently with kernel convolution techniques developed by tomaney @xmath1 crotts ( 1996 ) and alard ( 1998 ) . due the large filters of the eros database and the short baseline ( 120 days ) available with this data set , we choose to postpone this step to the next paper , which will produce periods with 3-years light curves together with a cross - identification with the denis photometry . in this paper",
    ", we provide a magnitude estimate for one epoch , together with an indication of blending , and put the emphasis on the selection procedure and the cross - identification with other catalogues .",
    "the light curves we use in the following to select variable stars correspond to the super - pixel flux @xmath8 measured at different epochs @xmath9 : @xmath10 where @xmath11 includes the sky and stellar background , and @xmath12 is the flux of the variable star .",

    "we apply an automatic selection of genuine luminosity variations to the 91 - 92 dataset .",
    "firstly , we introduce the definition of a variation . secondly , we adjust the thresholds in order to keep genuine variations but reject most artifacts due to noise .",
    "last , we carefully inspect selected light curves close to bad pixels .      a baseline flux ( @xmath24 ) is calculated for each super - pixel light curve by sorting all points in order of increasing flux , with @xmath24 being the 10@xmath25 sorted point .",
    "@xmath26 is the error associated with the baseline flux determination . for a sample taken from a gaussian distribution with a standard deviation @xmath27 this estimate lies 1.3  @xmath27 below the mean value of the distribution .",
    "deviations from this baseline are recorded when measurements lie @xmath28 above the baseline : @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the error associated with each super - pixel flux computed in paper  i for night @xmath9 .",
    "these deviations are quantified in each colour with a likelihood function ( l ) : @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the super - pixel flux for the measurement @xmath9 .",
    "all the measurements above @xmath24 are accounted for .      with the definition introduced above ,",
    "we apply the selection procedure summarised in tab . [",
    "tab : data ] .",
    "first of all we excise the pixels , covering 3.4% of the ccd fields , which exhibit obvious spurious variations ( such as bad columns ) .",
    "in addition , in order to remove automatically artifacts due to bad pixels , we remove from the light curves the epochs for which there is at least one pixel which datum is at zero within a 11@xmath511 window centred on the super - pixel .",
    "( 1 ) we require a regularity condition to remove the noise : the ratio @xmath33 has to be smaller than 0.6 in at least one colour , with : @xmath34 ^ 2}\\ ] ] @xmath35 ^ 2}\\ ] ] where @xmath36 is the mean super - pixel flux and @xmath37 is the total number of measurements on each light curve .",
    "( 2 ) we then select the light curves which vary such that @xmath38 in at least one colour . as there are as many super - pixels as pixels , a genuine variable is expected to affect all the super - pixels within the seeing spot .",
    "( 3 ) we search for clusters of super - pixels ( using a friend of friends algorithm ) , and keep the central pixel of the clusters if ( 4 ) the previous requirements are also satisfied for these pixels and , if ( 5 ) the number @xmath22 of super - pixels that compose each cluster is larger than 6 .",
    "these requirements eliminate most artifacts due to bright stars and ccd defects that do not exhibit a clear spatial psf - like pattern .",
    "we finally keep 747 super - pixel light curves .",
    "the sensitivity of these thresholds is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : eff ] . among the 747 selected variations ,",
    "two have been counted twice , leaving 745 independent light curves .",
    "we select 237 light curves for which there is at least one bad pixel ( saturated or set at zero ) within a 21@xmath521 window centred on the selected pixel for at least one epoch and at least one colour",
    ". a careful visual inspection of these light curves shows 121 genuine variable stars against 116 artifacts , subsequently removed .",
    "figure [ fig : cleand ] shows that the removed light curves are mainly concentrated close to the edges , whereas the distribution of the kept light curves ( among the 237 ) is more uniform .",
    "we finally end with a catalogue of 631 variable stars .",
    "whereas the pixel method of analysis is able to detect variable stars beyond the crowding limit , it does not measure photometry ",
    "total flux  of these objects , that can be blended or even unresolved on part of the light curves . obtaining their photometry would give a first indication of the type of the variable stars .",
    "hence in this section , we associate a magnitude and colour to each flux measurement .      as discussed in paper ii",
    ", the flux of the super - pixel is composed of the fraction of the flux of the star plus the local background ( from sky and undetected stars ) . for our sample of variable stars",
    ", we can presume that there is a star within the corresponding super - pixel and that its flux significantly contributes to this super - pixel , at least at the maximum of the variation . because of the crowding conditions , standard background estimates ( circular annulus for example , see stetson ( 1987 ) ) fail and can not be used in an automatic way .",
    "hence , we choose to perform a pseudo - aperture photometry as follows . for an image taken in the middle of the period of observation ( jd2448678.3 ) and with an average seeing",
    ", we use the psf fitting procedure of daophot ( stetson , 1987 ) to measure the fluxes of the resolved stars , and the background below them .",
    "this thus gives a local estimate of the background that is the less affected by the crowding of the field .",
    "then for each selected super - pixel we look for the detected star that is closest . the background estimate associated with this star",
    "is supposed to be the same as the one present below the variable star ( and is even identical if the variable stars are resolved on this reference frame ) .",
    "this background is subtracted from the super - pixel flux .",
    "this flux is then corrected for the seeing fraction and converted into a magnitude , corresponding to an isolated star .    whereas this definition of the sky - background is rather robust to the crowding conditions , the magnitude estimation is not necessary so , as some additional flux ( stellar background ) could contribute to the super - pixel due to neighbours .",
    "we thus quantify the blending with the ratio @xmath39 computed as follows : the flux @xmath40 is the averaged value computed along the light curve of the central pixel of the super - pixel , and the flux @xmath41 is a similar average of the 8 surrounding pixels within the super - pixel .",
    "the behaviour of this parameter is described in the appendix .",
    "optimised star detection with daophot allows to detect @xmath42 stars in blue and @xmath43 stars in red . the corresponding luminosity function computed with daophot for all the stars present on the studied field , exhibited in fig .",
    "[ fig : lf]a , shows that the star detection is in first approximation complete down to magnitude 18 in red and 19 in blue .",
    "figure [ fig : lf]b shows that the magnitude distributions at the same epoch for the selected variable stars peak at the bright end , whereas the stars are redder than average with @xmath44 .",
    "whereas it is difficult to compute our detection efficiencies as no reliable theoretical distribution of variable stars is available , it is clear that we do not detect a population of variable stars unresolved at minimum , even though we do detect a tail of this distribution with very dim stars in at least one colour .",
    "figure [ fig : colmag ] displays the position of the 631 variable stars in the cmd .",
    "this cmd has been obtained with the resolved stars detected with daophot in both colours .",
    "the conversion of the eros magnitudes into a standard system has been studied by grison et al .",
    "( 1995 ) , but introduces significant systematic errors especially for stars with @xmath45 .",
    "we hence choose to work in the eros system .",
    "the crowding limit prevents the detection of stars with @xmath46 .",
    "the main sequence and red clump are clearly identified .",
    "very little variations of the cmd are observed from one chip to another suggesting a uniform stellar population across this field .",
    "the vast majority of the detected variable stars lies in the red part .",
    "a visual inspection of the corresponding light curves shows that they are compatible with lt@xmath1lpv .",
    "this catalogue offers the perspective to systematically study the later stages of stellar evolution within the lmc bar .",
    "however , the isochrones superimposed on fig . [ fig : colmag ] illustrate the difficulty to classify variable stars with the sole cmd , as it is impossible to disentangle their age and mass for a given metalicity .",
    "the photometric system made it also inappropriate for further interpretation with this sole data .",
    "due to their complexity and the difficulties to model them , the lt@xmath1lpv are better characterised in the ir , as addressed in a subsequent paper .",
    "some `` bluer '' objects have also been detected and they will be classify when we study their periodicity .    as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : colmag ] , variable stars not significantly affected by crowding ( @xmath47 ) lie in areas of the colour - magnitude diagram corresponding to stars expected variable .",
    "those affected by blending and crowding will have to be treated with caution . in the cmd areas where the larger number of lt@xmath1lpv have been detected , in the magnitude ( @xmath48 ) and colour ( @xmath49 ) ranges , about 17@xmath2 of the stars exhibit a variation detected with our analysis .",
    "it is also clear that the vast majority of the detected variable stars are above the crowding limit .",
    "the few outliers that can be noticed correspond to stars unresolved in at least one colour , but their number does not exceed 5  @xmath2 of the total . in terms of microlensing , this means that events due to unresolved stars in the lmc will not be significantly contaminated by the bulk of variable stars . in further galaxies , like m31 , variable stars will be a more troublesome affair , and will have to be carefully studied ( e.g. crotts & tomaney 1996 ) .",
    "however , high amplification microlensing events are far less likely to be mimicked by an intrinsic variation ( ansari et al .",
    "1999 ) , and will allow to probe possible biases introduced by variable stars .",
    "the rectangular sky area covered by the eros-1 chips is enclosed in a circle of radius @xmath330@xmath50 centred on the position @xmath5105@xmath5221@xmath5352.1@xmath54 ; @xmath55 ( 2000.0 ) . in this region ,",
    "the density of pmm astrometric standards is highly irregular , e.g. four @xmath320@xmath56 15@xmath50 areas are completely empty .",
    "this is mainly due to the crowding of the survey plates used at usno .",
    "we therefore chose to use a u plate taken at the eso 1 m schmidt telescope to define the secondary astrometric standards .",
    "this plate was scanned with the mama microdensitometer , and reduced to the international celestial reference system ( icrs ) with the act catalogue .",
    "thanks to the modest sensitivity of the u emulsion / filter combination , the effects of crowding are reduced .",
    "a remarkably regular distribution of stars is detected with the sextractor software ( bertin @xmath1 arnouts , 1996 ) , with on average 2700 stars per chip .",
    "the secondary standards ( @xmath57/chip ) are identified to eros stars using a first linear transformation based on some 15 visually cross - identified stars per chip . the astrometric reduction software ( robichon et al . 1995 ) is then run using this set of references .",
    "after iteration , the final 2@xmath58 order reduction keeps 1000 stars per chip with final rms deviation of the order of 0.2@xmath59 .",
    "according to the galactic modelbesancon.fr/www/modele/s@xmath60tab.html ] from besanon , more than 95@xmath2 of the secondary references belong to lmc .",
    "furthermore , we check that the global proper motion of the lmc ( kroupa @xmath1 bastian , 1997 ) , together with upper limits on its internal velocity dispersion can not affect the positions of our standards by more than 30  mas , over the 848-days separating the eso plate from the eros reference .",
    "the detected variable stars are uniformly distributed along the ccd chips , and no obvious bias ( due e.g. to internal extinction ) are suspected . in order to appreciate the sensitivity of our analysis ,",
    "we cross - identified this catalogue with previous works . among the 631 variable stars presented here ,",
    "72 have already been studied elsewhere .",
    "we considered the main catalogues which covered this area , namely the catalogues of lt@xmath1lpv by hughes ( 1989 ) , eclipsing binaries and cepheids by eros ( grison et al . , 1994 and beaulieu et al.1996 ) , radio sources ( marx et al . , 1999 )",
    ", x - ray sources ( haberl & pietsch , 1999 ) , as well as the general catalogue of variable stars ( artiukhina et al . , 1995 ) and the ned data - base .",
    "we define a genuine cross - identification any object whose offsets with respect to the variable objects detected here are smaller than @xmath61 and @xmath62 .    among the 58 lt@xmath1lpv found by hughes ( 1989 ) in this field , 41 have been detected here , 12 are missed due to ccd defects ( one of those is rejected with the visual inspection described in sect .",
    "[ sect : artif ] ) .",
    "this gives the order of magnitude of the completeness of our sample over a 120-day window : we typically miss up to 20@xmath2 of genuine variable stars due to ccd defects .",
    "more interestingly , the last 5 missing lt@xmath1lpv escape our selection for no obvious reason .",
    "one of them ( shv0527122 - 695006 ) has been subsequently observed in the near - infrared ( hughes @xmath1 wood 1990 ) : it did not follow the ( k , @xmath63 ) relation , and was interpreted as a supergiant or a foreground mira . according to the daophot magnitudes measured at epoch jd=2448678.3 b@xmath64 and r@xmath65 , it is consistent with a supergiant .",
    "the 4 remaining , namely shv0516251 - 693241 , shv0519415 - 693441 , shv0522220 - 694441 , shv0522251 - 692902  not observed subsequently by hughes @xmath1 wood ( 1990 )  were reported by hughes ( 1989 ) with a low amplitude ( @xmath66  mag . ) and 3 of them were only marginally periodic . moreover ,",
    "our non - detection can be explained for some of them by changes in mass - loss rates as suggested by whitelock ( 1997 ) .",
    "the extension of this work with a longer baseline together with denis photometry is expected to provide further arguments about this kind of behaviour ( in preparation ) .",
    "the short periodic variable stars from the eros catalogue ( grison et al . , 1994 , and beaulieu et al . , 1996 )",
    "are missed here for most of them : short timescale variations are broken by the averaging procedure as explained in sect .",
    "[ sect : obs ] .",
    "only 22 out of the 181 variable stars previously detected by eros are present in this catalogue .",
    "in addition , 5 of the 7  pre - main - sequence candidates published by beaulieu et al .",
    "( 1996 ) have been detected .",
    "none of the radio - sources , detected by marx et al .",
    "( 1997 ) , are lying in the studied field .",
    "2 x - ray sources detected with rosat ( haberl & pietsch , 1999 ) are present in the field , but none of our variable stars lies in the 90@xmath2cl error box of those sources .",
    "29 extragalactic sources ( but not necessarily variable ) from ned are present in the field , none is among the variable stars detected here .",
    "last , whereas 129 sources from the gcvs are lying in the field , 52 are selected here .",
    "most of them were also in the catalogues mentioned above . according to the gcvs classification ,",
    "among these 52 variables , 17 are miras , 26 semi - regulars , 2 irregulars , and 7 cepheids .",
    "a total of 72 sources out of 631 were previously reported , 57 of which have a published period . those are presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : per ] : they are clearly of the order of 100 - 300 days .",
    "a visual inspection confirms that besides a few short periods , these timescales are quite representative of the bulk of a distribution dominated by lt@xmath1lpv .",
    "lt@xmath1lpv ( `` red '' variable stars ) represent the bulk of the stars presented in this catalogue .",
    "figures [ fig : ex1 ] and [ fig : ex2 ] show typical light curves detected with the corresponding finding charts .",
    "amplitudes measured over 120 days can be as low as 0.1  mag up to several magnitudes , depending on the timescale , and brightness range .",
    "the limitations ( in the photometry ) due to the crowding are also illustrated .",
    "the error bars ( estimated in paper  i ) account for the level of photon noise and other residual errors , but they do not account for the effect of crowding on the star flux . for light curves with @xmath67 , error bars are underestimated with respect to the scatter along the variation . this explains why the amplitude of variations in blue can be smaller ( or comparable ) than in red for a few lt@xmath1lpv : the crowding is more important in blue and larger amplitudes of variation are expected on dimmer stars .",
    "hence , we do not attempt to extract information about the amplitude , but provide magnitude estimates at one epoch with the @xmath68 ratio . for most of them ,",

    "a cross indicates the position at which the variable star has been detected .",
    "besides being a by - product of the microlensing searches , the variable stars constitute their background and their understanding and discrimination are important ( e.g. della valle & livio ( 1996 ) ) .",
    "they need to be catalogued for any on - line microlensing searches ( cf .",
    "macho and erosii ) . in this paper",
    ", we have produced a comprehensive catalogue of 631 variable stars selected over a 0.25 deg@xmath4 field in the lmc bar with the pixel method applied to a 120-day window , with a sampling of about one measurement per day .",
    "for each variable star , we provide an astrometric position accurate within @xmath71 , together with a finding chart .",
    "the study of their position in the cmd shows that this catalogue is dominated by a population of lt@xmath1lpv , while a few `` bluer '' variables have also been detected .",
    "cross - identification with existing catalogues shows that 11  % of them have already been studied elsewhere .",
    "we hence enlarge by a factor of 10 the number of lt@xmath1lpv detected in this area of the lmc bar .",
    "the pixel analysis presented here allows a selection of variable objects independently of a photometry .",
    "it hence uses all the information present in the frames but does not provide a photometry for these objects .",
    "it is complementary to the image subtraction techniques .",
    "we have shown that not surprisingly the pixel light curves are significantly polluted by blending , especially in blue and that their conversion in magnitude can only be rough .",
    "hence , for each variable star , we provide an indicator of blending in both colours .",
    "the preliminary study of these variable stars together with their cross - identification with previous works show that our photometry does not introduce significant bias on the overall distribution .",
    "recent improvements of the image subtraction techniques developed for microlensing searches ( alard 1999 , alcock et al.1999a , b ) will have to be considered for the future to improve the photometry of the variable stars detected in such crowded fields ( e.g. olech et al . 1999 )",

    "<S> the previous treatment was done in order to optimise the detection of long timescale variations ( larger than a few days ) and we further optimise our analysis for the selection of long timescale and long period variables ( lt@xmath1lpv ) . </S>",
    "<S> we choose to perform a selection of variable objects as comprehensive as possible , independent of periodicity and of their position on the colour magnitude diagram . </S>",
    "<S> we detail the different thresholds successively applied to the light curves , which allow to produce a catalogue of 632 variable objects . </S>",
    "<S> we present a table with the coordinate of each variable , its eros magnitudes at one epoch and an indicator of blending in both colours , together with a finding chart .    </S>",
    "<S> a cross - correlation with various catalogues shows that 90@xmath2 of those variable objects were undetected before , thus enlarging the sample of lt@xmath1lpv previously known in this area by a factor of 10 . due to the limitations of both the pixel method and the data set ,    additional data  namely a longer baseline and near infrared photometry  </S>",
    "<S> are required to further characterise these variable stars , as will be addressed in subsequent papers . </S>"
