    "a very thorough understanding has been achieved thanks to the fact that a noninteracting starting point is sufficient : indeed , topological insulators can be obtained from band theory in the presence of strong spin - orbit coupling .",
    "on the other hand , given the variety of electronic phases that are also generated by strong interactions , a highly topical question is to investigate the appearance of topological insulators due to correlations .",
    "this new route would not require intrinsic spin - orbit coupling , and thus could be advantageous to many applications .",

    "these phases can be characterized by the existence of spontaneously appearing charge ( respectively spin ) currents for spinless ( respectively spinful ) fermions .",
    "this finding has also been reproduced in the spinless case using more systematic mean - field approaches  @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , in the latter study ,  @xcite the qah extension in the phase diagram has shrunk substantially due to the stability of charge modulation with larger unit cell .",
    "the possibility to generate topological phases with longer - range interactions has triggered a large theoretical activity to investigate its experimental feasibility using metallic substrate  @xcite , cold - atomic gases on optical lattices  @xcite or rkky interaction  @xcite among many others .    in the light of several recent approximate and numerical studies  @xcite with conflicting conclusions regarding the presence of the putative topological mott state and competing ordered phases",

    "in fact , only in the simpler case @xmath10 which exhibits a direct phase transition from semi - metallic ( sm ) phase to charge density wave ( cdw ) as a function of @xmath11 , a very interesting recent proposal was made allowing to reformulate the problem without sign - problem  @xcite , thus amenable to accurate , unbiased qmc simulations  @xcite .",

    "when looking at competing charge instabilities , it is crucial to consider only clusters compatible with such orderings and we will devote some discussion on this topic in the next subsection .      since we plan to provide a systematic study on several clusters , we have implemented lattices sizes ranging from 12 to 42 sites , with various shapes and spatial symmetries . in particular , these clusters may or may not have some reflection or rotation symmetries ( they all have inversion symmetry ) . moreover , some of these lattices possess the @xmath15 points ( see the brillouin zone depicted in fig .",

    "this is already a clear indication of a phase transition between cdw ( known to be stable at small @xmath20 and large @xmath11 ) and at least two other phases that we will characterise later .    clearly , the choice of clusters is important depending on the parameters and the kind of instability .",
    "it was also pointed out recently  @xcite that the choice of boundary conditions might be crucial too . by studying the @xmath16 cluster with open boundary conditions ( obc ) , as opposed to standard periodic boundary conditions ( pbc ) , the authors of ref .",
    "have found two level crossings for @xmath24 and @xmath25 respectively ( for @xmath21 ) .",
    "this was taken as an indication for a stable qah phase in this region .",
    "we have checked that in this case , these level crossings correspond to two low - energy states having opposite parities with respect to inversion symmetry .",
    "however , these crossings disappear when one considers the next largest cluster @xmath26 with obc , so that it probably corresponds to a short - range feature only .",
    "we generally think that using pbc is more appropriate to minimize finite - size effects , so this will be the case here .",
    "last , we would like to recall some features of the semi - metallic ( sm ) phase that exists in the absence of interactions . since there is a vanishing density of states at the fermi level",
    ", one needs a _ finite strength _ of a short - ranged interaction to trigger an instability  @xcite , so that sm phase _ must have a finite extension _ in the phase diagram .    regarding possible gap opening mechanism of the sm phase",

    "in addition to the particle - hole gaps , there is also the possibility to open gaps by the addition of superconducting order parameters  @xcite , we will however not address these instabilities in this work .",
    "the model hamiltonian   considered here features all the usual symmetries .",
    "if the semi - metallic phase is gapped out by interactions , then the gap opening has to happen through the interactions by spontaneously breaking some of the symmetries .",

    "we will exchangeably use the @xmath31 notation or the @xmath32 notation : @xmath33 , @xmath34 , with @xmath35 .",
    "first we point out that this classical hamiltonian can be written in a `` frustration free '' form , when the hamiltonian is decomposed into parts acting on triangles spanned by three @xmath3 bonds and their central site ( this object can alternatively be considered as a tripod , i.e.  a site plus its three nearest @xmath9 neighbors ) , whose three @xmath9 couplings are counted only with half their strength ( this is necessary because each such bond belongs to two different @xmath3 triangles , while the @xmath3 bonds belong to a unique triangle ) , see fig .",

    "each such tripod acts on 4 sites , and depending on @xmath32 the hamiltonian on a tripod has a different number of local ground states .",
    "we have numerically verified that all ground states of the full problem are simultaneous ground states of each tripod term , thus the characterization `` frustration free '' .    by finite cluster ground state enumeration techniques ( with and without exploiting the frustration free property )",
    "we have established the classical phase diagram displayed in the left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : isingphasediagram ] . for @xmath36 ( @xmath37 ) ,",
    "the system decouples into two interpenetrating triangular lattices with antiferromagnetic interactions .",
    "the ground state manifold is thus spanned by the product of the ground spaces of each triangular sublattice , and is macroscopically degenerate ( i.e.  featuring an extensive ground state entropy ) .",

    "we have another point with an extensive ground state degeneracy , albeit with a smaller number than on the reflected side @xmath39 .",

    "we proceed by discussing the fate of the regions in the classical phase diagram , and then analyze the behavior on the degenerate points .",
    "we start with the least degenerate region , @xmath40 , where there are only two nel ground states .",
    "these two states are symmetry related ( and thus can not be split by diagonal terms ) and it is not possible to connect the two states by a finite order in perturbation theory in the thermodynamic limit .",

    "the phase separation region @xmath42 is also stable at finite @xmath48 because both the empty and the full system are inert under the action of the hopping term .      next we consider the extended region @xmath49 , featuring zigzag ground states and some types of domain walls .",

    "[ fig : chargeordermpoint ] become possible . as the order at which this process first occurs diverges with the linear extent of the cluster , such tunneling events seem irrelevant at small @xmath50 in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "as we currently do not fully understand the structure of the ground space manifold , we can not rule out the appearance of other perturbative processes connecting ground states without wrapping around the torus .    in order to shed some light on this issue",

    "in contrast to the zigzag case studied before , here we do not observe a clearly structured order - by - disorder selection of a new ground state .",
    "the results for these system sizes can be rationalized as the spectrum of an abstract tight binding model , where the sites are the different ground states in the classical ground space , while the hopping matrix elements are of the cluster wrapping type just discussed . as the perturbative orders of these processes strongly depend on the shape of the cluster , the strong correlation of the bandwidth of the split ground space with the formal order in perturbation theory seems to validate our picture .",
    "it is thus presently not clear whether the ground state degeneracy will be lifted at a finite order in perturbation theory in the thermodynamic limit or not .",
    "the qualitative presence of a high - order diagonal term in the zigzag case discussed before could also carry over to the present stripy * case , but is masked on moderate finite size samples by the leading cluster - wrapping splitting terms .",

    "@xcite when working at half filling the ground space of the full problem can be obtained by enumerating all ground states on one triangular sublattice and then summing up the product of the two sublattice hilbert spaces over all particle bipartitions such that the total number of particles amounts to half filling ( i.e.  @xmath61 ) .",
    "the effect of a finite @xmath62 is to hop particles from one triangular sublattice to the other one .",
    "there are indeed many states in the ground state manifold where such first order hoppings are possible while staying in the ground state manifold .",
    "the problem thus maps to a hopping problem on an abstract lattice living in the constrained hilbert space , where the sites are the allowed configurations .",
    "this abstract lattice is not homogeneous and features sites with different coordination numbers .",
