    "given a vector field on a smooth closed manifold @xmath0 there is a corresponding dynamical system and one can investigate the closed orbits of this flow .",
    "it is desirable to collect all closed orbits in one power series and study the algebraic topology and @xmath1-theory of this object . to do this",

    "+ in @xcite , fried defines a commutative zeta function for certain nonsingular flows as a formal power series and relates it to a reidemeister torsion invariant of the manifold .",
    "+ the first noncommutative invariant for flows was introduced in geoghegan and nicas @xcite for suspension flows .",
    "their analogue of a zeta function is what they call the lefschetz - nielsen series which lives in an infinite product of @xmath5-dimensional hochschild homology groups .",
    "+ in the case of vector fields with singularities the first papers to obtain relations between zeta functions and torsion are hutchings and lee @xcite and pajitnov @xcite , both dealing with gradients of circle - valued morse functions and with commutative invariants .",
    "in that situation the torsion invariant no longer depends only on the topology of @xmath0 but the critical points enter via the novikov complex .",
    "both papers have been generalized , hutchings @xcite discusses closed 1-forms , still in a commutative setting , while pajitnov @xcite gets a noncommutative result for circle - valued morse functions .",
    "+ circle - valued morse functions correspond to closed rational morse 1-forms .",

    "the geometric methods largely follow pajitnov @xcite .",
    "in fact , the geometry in @xcite is mainly contained in his earlier paper @xcite .",
    "the main difficulty is that the algebra required to keep track of the invariants is more complicated than in the commutative case .",
    "so instead of looking at a zeta function , pajitnov @xcite and we look at an eta function ( or pre - zeta function , compare fried @xcite ) , which generalizes the logarithm of the zeta function of the commutative case . since the conjugacy classes of @xmath6 do not form a group , we can not take the exponential function of this eta function . to compare this eta function with a certain torsion one needs a logarithm - like homomorphism @xmath7 from @xmath8 of the novikov ring to the object containing the eta function .",
    "we depart somewhat in the definition of @xmath7 from pajitnov @xcite in that we take a detour through hochschild homology using the dennis trace , compare geoghegan and nicas @xcite .",

    "the restriction that @xmath19 lie in @xmath23 , a geometric condition due to pajitnov @xcite , then allows us to identify the torsion of @xmath32 .",

    "it turns out that the complex @xmath34 is the mapping cone of an injective @xmath13 homomorphism which depends on the vector field @xmath19 .",
    "after tensoring with the novikov ring the natural projection to the cokernel is a chain homotopy equivalence .",
