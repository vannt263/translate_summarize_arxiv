    "arithmetic is used for special circuits such as in signal processing , and for very long precision arithmetic . an application to real - time control can be found in  @xcite .",
    "one of the benefits of on - line computable functions is that they are continuous for the usual discrete topology on the set of infinite sequences on a finite alphabet . in order to be able to perform on - line computations ,",
