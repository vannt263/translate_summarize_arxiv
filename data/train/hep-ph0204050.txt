    "the observed anomalies of atmospheric @xcite and solar @xcite neutrinos strongly suggest that neutrinos be massive and lepton flavors be mixed . in the framework of three charged leptons and three active neutrinos , the phenomena of flavor mixing and @xmath5 violation are described by a unitary matrix @xmath1 , which relates the neutrino mass eigenstates @xmath6 to the neutrino flavor eigenstates @xmath7 : @xmath8 the unitarity of @xmath1 represents two sets of normalization and orthogonality conditions : @xmath9 where greek and latin subscripts run over @xmath10 and @xmath11 , respectively . if neutrinos are dirac particles , a full parametrization of @xmath1 requires four independent parameters  three mixing angles and one @xmath5-violating phase , for example . if neutrinos are majorana particles , however , two additional @xmath5-violating phases need be introduced for a complete parametrization of @xmath1 . in both cases , @xmath5 and @xmath12 violation in normal neutrino oscillations",
    "depends only upon a single rephasing - invariant parameter @xmath13 @xcite , defined through @xmath14 where @xmath15 and @xmath16 run respectively over @xmath10 and @xmath11 .",
    "a major goal of the future long - baseline neutrino oscillation experiments is to measure @xmath17 and @xmath13 as precisely as possible @xcite .",
    "once the matrix elements of @xmath1 are determined to a good degree of accuracy , a stringent test of its unitarity will become available .    as a straightforward consequence of the unitarity of @xmath1 ,",
    "two interesting relations can be derived from the normalization conditions in eq .",
    "( 2 ) : @xmath18 and @xmath19 the off - diagonal asymmetries @xmath20 and @xmath21 characterize the geometrical structure of @xmath1 about its @xmath22-@xmath3-@xmath23 and @xmath24-@xmath3-@xmath4 axes , respectively .",
    "if @xmath25 held , @xmath1 would be symmetric about the @xmath22-@xmath3-@xmath23 axis .",
    "indeed the counterpart of @xmath20 in the quark sector is very small ( of order @xmath26 @xcite ) ; i.e. , the @xmath0 quark mixing matrix is almost symmetric about its @xmath27-@xmath28-@xmath29 axis .",
    "an exactly symmetric flavor mixing matrix may hint at an underlying flavor symmetry , from which some deeper understanding of the fermion mass texture can be achieved @xcite . in this sense ,",
    "the tiny off - diagonal asymmetry of the quark flavor mixing matrix is likely to arise from a slight breakdown of certain flavor symmetries of quark mass matrices .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to examine whether the lepton flavor mixing matrix @xmath1 is really symmetric or not . in section",
    "ii , we find that current neutrino oscillation data strongly favor @xmath30 ; i.e. , @xmath1 is possible to be symmetric about its @xmath24-@xmath3-@xmath4 axis .",
    "it remains too early to get any phenomenological constraints on @xmath20 , unless very special assumptions are made . in section iii , we point out that the off - diagonal symmetry @xmath31 corresponds to three pairs of _ congruent _ unitarity triangles in the complex plane . taken realistic long - baseline experiments of neutrino oscillations into account , the terrestrial matter effects on @xmath13 , @xmath20 and @xmath21 are briefly discussed in section iv .",
    "section v is devoted to some further discussions about possible implications of @xmath31 on specific textures of lepton mass matrices .",
    "finally we summarize our main results in section vi .",
    "current experimental data @xcite strongly favor the hypothesis that atmospheric and solar neutrino oscillations are dominated by @xmath32 and @xmath33 transitions , respectively . thus their mixing factors @xmath34 and @xmath35 have rather simple relations with the elements of the lepton flavor mixing matrix @xmath1 .",
    "the mixing factor associated with the chooz ( or palo verde ) reactor neutrino oscillation experiment @xcite , denoted as @xmath36 , is also a simple function of @xmath17 in the same hypothesis .",
    "the explicit expressions of @xmath35 , @xmath34 and @xmath36 read as follows : @xmath37 an analysis of the super - kamiokande data on atmospheric neutrino oscillations @xcite yields @xmath38 and @xmath39 at the @xmath40 confidence level .",
    "corresponding to @xmath41 , @xmath42 can be drawn from the chooz experiment @xcite .",
    "we restrict ourselves to the large - angle mikheyev - smirnov - wolfenstein ( msw ) solution to the solar neutrino problem @xcite , as it gives the best global fit of present data . at the @xmath43 confidence level , @xmath44 and @xmath45",
    "have been obtained @xcite .    with the help of eqs .",
    "( 2 ) and ( 6 ) , one may express @xmath46 , @xmath47 , @xmath48 and @xmath49 in terms of @xmath50 , @xmath51 and @xmath52 : @xmath53 without loss of generality , three mixing angles ( @xmath50 , @xmath51 and @xmath52 ) can all be arranged to lie in the first quadrant .",
    "then we need only adopt the solution @xmath54 @xcite , in accord with @xmath42 .",
    "we may also express @xmath55 in terms of @xmath51 and @xmath52 , once the normalization relation @xmath56 is taken into account .",
    "it turns out that useful experimental constraints are achievable for those matrix elements in the first row and in the third column of @xmath1 .",
    "however , it is impossible to get any constraints on the other four matrix elements of @xmath1 , unless some special assumptions are made .- violating phase of @xmath1 to vary between 0 and @xmath57 , fukugita and tanimoto @xcite have presented the numerical ranges of all nine @xmath17 by use of current neutrino oscillation data .",
    "this rough construction of the lepton flavor mixing matrix is actually unable to shed light on its off - diagonal asymmetries and @xmath5-violating features .",
    "] this observation means that it remains too early to get any instructive information on the off - diagonal asymmetry @xmath20 from current neutrino oscillation experiments , but it is already possible to examine whether @xmath30 coincides with current data and what its implications can be on leptonic @xmath5 violation and unitarity triangles .    to see whether @xmath30 is compatible with the present data of solar , atmospheric and reactor neutrino oscillations",
    ", we simply set @xmath58 in eq .",
    "( 7 ) and then obtain @xmath59 as @xmath42 @xcite , the second term on the right - hand side of eq .",
    "( 8) serves as a small correction to the leading term @xmath34 .",
    "the difference between @xmath60 and @xmath61 is therefore insignificant .",
    "indeed @xmath62 leads definitely to @xmath63 , as a straightfoward result of @xmath30 . allowing @xmath34 to vary in the experimental range @xmath38",
    ", we plot the numerical dependence of @xmath64 on @xmath36 in fig . 1 .",
    "one can observe that the values of @xmath64 predicted from eq .",
    "( 8) are consistent very well with current experimental data .",
    "thus we conclude that a vanishing or tiny off - diagonal asymmetry of @xmath1 about its @xmath2-@xmath3-@xmath4 axis is strongly favored .",
    "let us proceed to discuss possible implications of @xmath30 on the leptonic unitarity triangles .",
    "it is known that six orthogonality relations of @xmath1 in eq .",
    "( 2 ) correspond to six triangles in the complex plane @xcite , as illustrated in fig .",
    "these six triangles totally have eighteen different sides and nine different inner angles .",
    "unitarity requires that all six triangles have the same area amounting to @xmath65 , where @xmath13 is just the rephasing - invariant measure of leptonic @xmath5 violation defined in eq .",
    "now that the off - diagonal asymmetries @xmath20 and @xmath21 describe the geometrical structure of @xmath1 , they must have direct relations with the unitarity triangles in the complex plane .",
    "indeed it is easy to show that @xmath66 or @xmath30 corresponds to the congruence between two unitarity triangles ; i.e. , @xmath67 and @xmath68 as @xmath30 is expected to be rather close to reality , we draw the conclusion that the unitarity triangles @xmath69 and @xmath70 must be approximately congruent with each other . a similar conclusion can be drawn for the unitarity triangles @xmath71 and @xmath72 as well as @xmath73 and @xmath74 .",
    "the long - baseline experiments of neutrino oscillations in the near future will tell whether an approximate congruence exists between @xmath69 and @xmath74 or between @xmath73 and @xmath70 .",
    "a particularly interesting possibility would be @xmath75 ; i.e. , only two of the six unitarity triangles are essentially distinct .",
    "next we examine how large the area of each unitarity triangle ( i.e. , @xmath65 ) can maximally be in the limit @xmath30 , in which @xmath1 is parametrized as follows : @xmath76 where @xmath77 , @xmath78 , and so on .",
    "the merit of this phase choice is that the dirac - type @xmath5-violating phase @xmath79 does not appear in the effective mass term of the neutrinoless double beta decay @xcite , which depends only upon the majorana phases @xmath80 and @xmath81 . without loss of generality",
    ", one may arrange the mixing angles @xmath82 and @xmath83 to lie in the first quadrant .",
    "three @xmath5-violating phases ( @xmath84 ) can take arbitrary values from 0 to @xmath85 . clearly @xmath86 holds . with the help of eq .",
    "( 6 ) or ( 7 ) , we are able to figure out the relations between @xmath87 and @xmath88 .",
    "the result is @xmath89 then we obtain @xmath90 where @xmath64 has been given in eq .",
    "again the difference between @xmath91 and @xmath92 is insignificant .",
    "if @xmath93 or @xmath57 held , we would arrive at @xmath94 .",
    "in general , however , @xmath5 symmetry is expected to break down in the lepton sector . for illustration",
    ", we plot the numerical dependence of @xmath95 on @xmath36 in fig .",
    "3 , where the experimentally allowed values of @xmath34 are used .",
    "it is obvious that the upper bound of @xmath96 ( when @xmath97 ) can be as large as a few percent , only if @xmath98 .",
    "this result implies that leptonic @xmath5 and @xmath12 violation might be observable in the future long - baseline neutrino oscillation experiments .",
    "in realistic long - baseline experiments of neutrino oscillations , the terrestrial matter effects must be taken into account @xcite .",
    "the pattern of neutrino oscillations in matter can be expressed in the same form as that in vacuum , however , if we define the _ effective _ neutrino masses @xmath99 and the _ effective _ lepton flavor mixing matrix @xmath100 in which the terrestrial matter effects are already included @xcite . note that @xmath99 are functions of @xmath101 , @xmath102 and @xmath103 ; and @xmath104 are functions of @xmath101 , @xmath105 and @xmath103 , where @xmath103 is the matter parameter and its magnitude depends upon the neutrino beam energy @xmath106 and the background density of electrons @xmath107 .",
    "the analytically exact relations between @xmath108 and @xmath109 can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite , if @xmath107 is assumed to be a constant . in analogy to the definitions of @xmath13 , @xmath20 and @xmath21 , the _ effective _ @xmath5-violating parameter @xmath110 and off - diagonal asymmetries @xmath111 and @xmath112 can be defined as follows : @xmath113 where @xmath15 and @xmath16 run respectively over @xmath10 and @xmath11 ; @xmath114 and @xmath115 it is then interesting to examine possible departures of @xmath116 from @xmath117 in a concrete experimental scenario .    to illustrate , we compute @xmath110 , @xmath111 and @xmath112 using the typical inputs @xmath118 , @xmath119 and @xmath120 , which yield @xmath121 , @xmath122 and @xmath30 in vacuum .",
    "the neutrino mass - squared differences are taken to be @xmath123 and @xmath124 .",
    "the explicit formulas relevant to our calculation have been given in ref .",
    "we plot the numerical dependence of @xmath125 , @xmath111 and @xmath112 on the matter parameter @xmath103 in fig .",
    "4 , where both the cases of neutrinos ( @xmath126 ) and antineutrinos ( @xmath127 ) are taken into account . one can see that the off - diagonal symmetry @xmath31 in vacuum can substantially be spoiled by terrestrial matter effects . the deviation of @xmath111 from @xmath20 and that of @xmath110 from @xmath13 are remarkably large , if @xmath128 .    as emphasized in ref .",
    "@xcite , there exists the simple reversibility between the fundamental neutrino mixing parameters in vacuum and their effective counterparts in matter .",
    "the former can therefore be expressed in terms of the latter , allowing more straightforward extraction of the genuine lepton mixing quantities ( including @xmath13 , @xmath20 and @xmath21 ) from a variety of long - baseline neutrino oscillation experiments .",
    "if @xmath17 are determined to a very high degree of accuracy , it will be possible to test the unitarity of @xmath1 @xcite and establish leptonic @xmath5 violation through the non - zero area of six unitarity triangles @xcite even in the absence of a direct measurement of @xmath13 .",
    "if @xmath31 really holds , one may wonder whether this off - diagonal symmetry of @xmath1 hints at very special textures of the neutrino mass matrix @xmath129 and ( or ) the charged lepton mass matrix @xmath130 . in the following ,",
    "we take two simple but instructive examples to illustrate possible implications of @xmath31 on @xmath130 and @xmath129 .    * example a *    in no conflict with current data on atmospheric @xcite , solar @xcite and reactor @xcite neutrino oscillations , a remarkably simplified form of @xmath1 with @xmath30 and @xmath131 is @xmath132 where @xmath133 and @xmath134 @xcite . in the flavor basis",
    "where @xmath130 is diagonal , @xmath129 can be given as @xmath135 where symmetric matrices @xmath136 , @xmath137 and @xmath138 read @xmath139 the texture of @xmath129 is rather complicated , hence it is difficult to observe any hidden flavor symmetry associated with lepton mass matrices .",
    "* example b *    the result of @xmath129 in example a will become simpler , if @xmath140 is further taken ( i.e. , @xmath141 is of the bi - maximal mixing form @xcite ) . in this special case , however , simple textures of @xmath130 and @xmath129 can be written out in a more general flavor basis .",
    "it is easy to show that @xmath130 and @xmath129 of the following textures lead to @xmath141 with @xmath142 : @xmath143 \\ ; ,   \\nonumber \\\\ m_\\nu & = & \\frac{c_\\nu}{2 } \\left [ \\left ( \\matrix { 1    & 0 & 0 \\cr 0    & 1 & 0 \\cr 0    & 0 & 1 \\cr } \\right ) + \\left ( \\matrix { 0    & \\varepsilon_\\nu    & 0 \\cr \\varepsilon_\\nu & 0 & 0 \\cr 0    & 0 & \\delta_\\nu \\cr } \\right ) \\right ] \\ ; ,   %    ( 20)\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath144 and @xmath145 are small perturbative parameters @xcite . in the limit",
    "@xmath146 , @xmath130 has the @xmath147 symmetry and @xmath129 displays the @xmath148 symmetry @xcite .",
    "the perturbative corrections in @xmath130 allow electron and muon to acquire their masses : @xmath149 we then arrive at @xmath150 gev , @xmath151 and @xmath152 .",
    "the perturbative corrections in @xmath129 make three neutrino masses non - degenerate : @xmath153 as a result , @xmath154 for the large - angle msw solution to the solar neutrino problem .",
    "examples a and b illustrate how the off - diagonal symmetry of @xmath1 ( @xmath30 ) can be reproduced from specific textures of lepton mass matrices .",
    "in view of current experimental data on solar and atmospheric neutrino oscillations , we have discussed the geometrical structure of the @xmath0 lepton flavor mixing matrix @xmath1 .",
    "we find that the present data strongly favor the off - diagonal symmetry of @xmath1 about its @xmath2-@xmath3-@xmath4 axis .",
    "this symmetry , if really exists , will correspond to three pairs of congruent unitarity triangles in the complex plane .",
    "it remains too early to tell whether @xmath1 is symmetric or not about its @xmath22-@xmath3-@xmath23 axis .",
    "a brief analysis of terrestrial matter effects on the universal @xmath5-violating parameter and off - diagonal asymmetries of @xmath1 has also been made .",
    "we expect that future long - baseline experiments of neutrino oscillations can help establish the texture of the lepton flavor mixing matrix , from which one could get some insights into the underlying flavor symmetries responsible for the charged lepton and neutrino mass matrices .",
