    "the search for exotic nuclear configurations was inspired by j.a.wheeler @xcite .",
    "his idea was investigated by many authors who studied the stability of exotic nuclear shapes ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "theoretical investigations have shown that very exotic extra superheavy nuclei can be reached only if non - compact shapes are taken into account .",
    "calculations for bubble structures showed that such nuclei can be stable for @xmath1 and @xmath2 ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "recently it was found that for nuclei with @xmath3 the global energy minimum corresponds to toroidal shapes @xcite .",
    "in contrast to bubble nuclei , the synthesis of toroidal nuclei is experimentally available in collisions between stable isotopes .    to address this issue simulations",
    "were performed for au + au collisions in a wide range of incident energies using the buu code @xcite .",
    "these calculations indicate that the threshold energy for the formation of toroidal nuclear shapes is located around 23 amev .",
    "also improved quantum molecular dynamics model calculations performed for u + u collisions have shown a possible formation of toroidal freeze - out configurations above a specific collision energy for this heavy system @xcite .",
    "such toroidal - shape complex can be also created in macroscale in binary droplet collisions above some threshold velocity @xcite .",
    "a number of observables were suggested as the signatures of noncompact freeze - out configurations .",
    "these were :    * larger number of intermediate mass fragments should be observed than would be expected for the decay of a compact object ; * enhanced similarity in the charge and size of the fragments should also be observed ; * suppressed sphericity in the emission of fragments should be visible .    the simulations of decay process of different break up configurations using the etna code were performed to study the ability of the chimera detector @xcite for recognition of non - compact configurations .",
    "analysis of different observables have shown that a quantity named `` the efficiency factor '' of events with 5 heavy fragments can be used as a criterion of selecting events possibly resulting from formation of toroidal configurations @xcite .",
    "the chimera collaboration has carried out an experiment on the @xmath0 reaction at 23 amev beam energy , focused on two independent goals , first on the extension of the earlier study at lower energy of 15 amev , in which a new reaction mechanism of violent breakup of non - fusing @xmath0 system into 3 and/or 4 massive fragments was observed @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and second , on the search of exotic nuclear configurations such as toroidal shapes .",
    "some preliminary results of the former project have been published in @xcite .    in this work",
    "we report results of our analysis focused on the question of exotic configurations involving the breakup of the @xmath0 system into 5 or more fragments .",

    "proximity of efficiency factor values for experimental data and toroidal freeze - out configurations may be used as an indication of the formation of an exotic freeze - out configuration .",
    "the juxtaposition of the standard deviation of fragment mass values for events located outside and inside the reaction plane are not suggestive of a toroidal freeze - out configuration .",
    "comparison of distributions of relative velocities for event with different orientation in respect to reaction plane gives evidence that the freeze - out configuration is more extended for events located outside reaction plane .",
    "the behavior of mean velocities of fragments as a function of their mass for flat and non - flat events gives an indication that toroidal configuration may be created for some subclass of flat events .",
    "the probability of apperence of these flat events is much greater than the prediction of the qmd model .",
    "the nature of flat events tilted with respect to the reaction plane should be investigated .",
