    "we analyzed the temporal evolution of fluxes and spectral indices .",
    "our work leads us to the following principal conclusions :    1 .",
    "our sources show mostly flat or inverted ( @xmath0 ) spectral indices , in agreement with optically thick synchrotron emission .",
    "the lightcurves of different frequencies are either simultaneous ( within errors ) or shifted relative to each other such that the high - frequency emission leads the low - frequency emission by up to @xmath101.5 years .",
    "we are able to distinguish high - peaking and low - peaking flares according to the classification of @xcite .",
    "2 .   all lightcurves show variability on all time scales .",
    "their periodograms ( power spectra ) are in agreement with being pure red - noise powerlaw spectra without any indication for ( quasi-)periodic signals .",
    "when taking into account the sampling patterns via dedicated monte carlo simulations , we find that all lightcurves are consistent with being random walk noise signals with powerlaw slopes @xmath95 .",
    "given that we find this behavior in all four sources under study , this suggests that random walk noise lightcurves are a general feature of blazars .",
    "our results imply that careful time series analysis of high - quality blazar lightcurves provides information on the source structure even if a target is not resolved spatially .",
    "obviously , it will be necessary to systematically study much larger blazar samples in order to decide if the trends we have uncovered are indeed general .",
    "this work is based on observations obtained by the university of michigan radio astronomy observatory ( umrao ) supported by the national science foundation ( nsf ) of the u.s.a .. we are most grateful to margo f. aller for making the data available to us and for valuable discussion .",
    "this study made use of the nasa / ipac extragalactic database ( ned ) .",
