    "the ubiquitous concept of _ energy _ is associated with the _ possibilities _ for the configurations of a mechanical system ( e.g. , the eigenvalues of the hamiltonian of a quantum system defined in a specific hilbert space ) .",
    "the concept of _ entropy _ emerges in an even larger domain , since it can be defined for any system , mechanical or not , which admits a set of _ probabilities _ for its possible configurations .",
    "for instance , if we are dealing with a quantum mechanical system , the set of probabilities typically is that corresponding to the eigenvectors of the hilbert space .",
    "epistemologically speaking , entropy is one of the most subtle concepts in physics .",
    "entropy and energy together constitute the basis on which statistical mechanics  one of the pillars of contemporary physics  is constructed .",
    "the entropy , initially defined by clausius for thermodynamics , connects the macroscopic and microscopic worlds .",
    "its most elementary form is the logarithmic one , first introduced by boltzmann and refined by gibbs , von neumann , shannon , jaynes and others . for a finite discrete set of probabilities @xmath2",
    "is given by @xmath3 where @xmath4 stands for _ boltzmann - gibbs_. the conventional constant @xmath5 is typically taken to be the boltzmann universal constant for thermostatistical systems , or taken to be unity in information theory . for the particular case of equal probabilities , i.e. , @xmath6 , we have @xmath7 carved on stone in boltzmann grave in vienna . expression ( 1 ) enables the construction of a remarkably useful physical theory , referred to as _ boltzmann - gibbs statistical mechanics_.    many entropic forms have been introduced , and reintroduced , since boltzmann ( see @xcite and references therein for details ) . in 1988 @xcite , a more general form ,",
    "namely @xmath8 was proposed as the basis for generalizing @xmath4 statistical mechanics ( into a theory now known as _ nonextensive statistical mechanics _ ) . for the particular case of equal probabilities , expression ( [ qentropy ] )",
    "becomes @xmath9    by introducing the @xmath10 function @xmath11 expressions ( [ qentropy ] ) and ( [ qentropyequal ] ) can be respectively rewritten as follows : @xmath12 and @xmath13    the axiomatics associated with this entropy have been quite explored and interesting characterizations have emerged . for details we may address the reader to @xcite , among others .",
    "we adopt for _ entropy additivity _ the definition given in penrose s classical book @xcite , namely that an entropy @xmath14 is said _ additive _ if , for any two _ probabilistically independent _ systems @xmath15 and @xmath16 , i.e. , for @xmath17 , we have that @xmath18 where @xmath19 , @xmath20 , and @xmath21 .",
    "> from definition ( [ qentropy ] ) it is straightforward to prove that , for any two probabilistically independent systems @xmath15 and @xmath16 , @xmath22 therefore , @xmath23 is additive , whereas @xmath24 @xmath25 is nonadditive .. we see that this can occur in two different manners : @xmath26 for fixed @xmath5 , and @xmath27 for fixed @xmath1 .",
    "the latter corresponds to the infinite temperature @xmath28 limit , since in all thermostatistical systems @xmath28 always appears in the form @xmath29 , thus having the dimension of an energy . ]",
    "_ entropic extensivity _ is a concept in some sense more subtle than additivity .",
    "an entropy @xmath14 of a given system constituted by @xmath30 elements is said to be _ extensive _ if @xmath31 i.e. , if @xmath32 for @xmath33 .",
    "we see therefore that additivity only depends on the specific mathematical connection between the macroscopic entropy functional and the probabilities of the configurations of the system .",
    "extensivity depends on this but _ also _ on the specific system , more precisely on the nature of the correlations of its elements , and therefore of its collective configurations .",
    "the distinction between additivity and extensivity has already been illustrated in simple probabilistic systems @xcite .",
    "it has also been shown for the so - called _ block entropy _ ( entropy of a subsystem of the entire system ) of strongly quantum entangled fermionic and bosonic systems @xcite .",
    "for the probabilistic system it has been shown @xcite that @xmath34 where @xmath35 stands for _ entropy _ , @xmath30 is the number of ( strongly correlated ) binary random variables , and @xmath36 @xmath37 characterizing the width of an infinitely long strip of nonvanishing probabilities of a probability triangle asymptotically satisfying the leibnitz rule ( i.e. , asymptotically scale - invariant ) .    for the ( one - dimensional ) fermionic system it has been shown that , at criticality at vanishing temperature , we have @xcite @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the number of first - neighboring spins ( or analogous elements ) within an infinitely long ( @xmath40 ) chain , and @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the _ central charge _ ( @xmath43 for the ising ferromagnet , and @xmath44 for the isotropic @xmath45 ferromagnet , in the presence of a critical transverse magnetic field in both cases ) .",
    "we verify that @xmath46 monotonically increases from zero to one when @xmath42 increases from zero to infinity .",
    "for the ( two - dimensional ) bosonic system the results are qualitatively the same .",
    "however they have been established only numerically , not analytically .",
    "the generic scenario which emerges is that , for a vast class of systems ( but certainly not all ) , a value @xmath46 exists such that @xmath47 , where @xmath30 is the number of elements of the system under consideration ( which might be the entire system , or only a large part of it ) . for standard systems , we have that @xmath48 ; for various classes of anomalous systems , we have @xmath49 .",
    "the situation is depicted in fig .",
    "[ extensive ] .",
    "( for @xmath50 ) is nonadditive .",
    "extensivity depends on the system : for standard systems , @xmath23 is extensive , whereas it can be nonextensive for anomalous systems ; @xmath24 is the other way around . ]      the _ central limit theorem _ within theory of probabilities basically states that the _ sum _ of a large number @xmath30 of _ independent _ ( or quasi - independent in some specific sense ) random variables whose variance is _ finite _ converge , after appropriate centering and rescaling , to a gaussian ( i.e. , @xmath51 ) .",
    "this distribution constitutes an attractor in the space of distributions , and is therefore thought to be the reason for the ubiquity of gaussian distributions in nature .",
    "if the single distribution has a _ divergent _ variance instead ( and also satisfies some supplementary mathematical conditions ) , the attractors are the celebrated lvy distributions .",
    "the situation changes drastically if strong correlations exist among the @xmath30 random variables .",
    "depending on the nature of the correlations very many types of attractors might emerge .",
    "there is however a special class of strong correlations , referred to as _ @xmath1-independence _",
    "@xcite , for which the attractors are @xmath1-gaussians ( i.e. , @xmath52 , where the @xmath1-exponential function is defined as the inverse of the @xmath1-logarithmic one defined in eq .",
    "( [ qlogarithmic ] ) ) , if a specific generalized variance is _",
    "finite_. if this variance _ diverges _ instead , the attractors are the so - called @xmath53-stable distributions : see @xcite for full details . the schematic description of these four theorems is presented in fig . [ figtheorem ] .",
    "the physical - mathematical interpretation of the class of strong correlations named as @xmath1-independence is not yet fully ellucidated .",
    "however , it might well be that @xmath1-independence between @xmath30 random variables implies ( strict or asymptotic ) probabilistic scale - invariance in the sense that @xmath54 although probably necessary , this property is surely not sufficient",
    ". indeed , ( strictly or asymptotically ) scale - invariant probabilistic models ( with finite values for the appropriately generalized variance ) have been analytically solved , some of them yielding , in the @xmath40 limit , @xmath1-gaussians , whereas other models yield distributions which numerically are amazingly close to @xmath1-gaussians , but which definitively are _ not _ exactly @xmath1-gaussians .",
    "models that yield @xmath1-gaussians are available in @xcite ; models that have been proved @xcite to be not exactly @xmath1-gaussians are presented in @xcite .    like gaussians ,",
    "@xmath1-gaussians also are ubiquitous in natural , artificial and social systems",
    ". what could be the cause of such fact ?",
    "it could very well be precisely the theorem appearing in fig .",
    "[ figtheorem ] which corresponds to @xmath1-gaussian attractors . in",
    "what follows we shall exhibit various nearly @xmath1-gaussian distributions : in section 2 for dissipative one - dimensional dissipative maps , in section 3 for long - range - interacting many - body classical hamiltonians .",
    "these two systems share a crucial property , namely that they have a maximal lyapunov exponent which approaches zero , thus excluding strong chaos .",
    "finite - size or finite - precision effects are present in them : we mimic this property in section 4 with a simple mathematical model . finally we conclude in section 5 by mentionning various systems presented in the literature which also appear to exhibit @xmath1-gaussians .",
    "let us here concentrate on a paradigmatic one - dimensional dissipative dynamical system , namely the logistic map , defined as @xmath55 , where @xmath56 is the map parameter ( @xmath57 ) , @xmath58 , and @xmath59 .",
    "our object of interest is the sum    @xmath60    in the vicinity of chaos threshold @xmath61 , where @xmath62 is the number of transient steps ( typically @xmath63 ) and @xmath64 is the average over a large number of @xmath30 iterates as well as a large number @xmath65 of randomly chosen initial values @xmath66 of iterates of the map .",
    "this problem has been addressed firstly in @xcite and a closer look has been given very recently in @xcite . here , we try to further clarify the study and analyse it in a more compact manner .    generically , the problem at hand is the form of the probability distribution of the random variable given in eq .",
    "( [ y ] ) .",
    "indeed , the ordinary central limit theorem ( clt ) ( yielding the gaussian form ) is applicable when the lyapunov exponent is positive , but , when approaching the edge of chaos from above ( i.e. , for @xmath67 ) , an infinite number of values of @xmath56 accumulate which violate this condition .",
    "the situation becomes then quite subtle , as we shall review here .",
    "essentially , strong correlations between the iterates of the map emerge . in @xcite",
    "it is shown that the problem is much more complex than the ordinary clt , which is the case when the map is at the chaotic regime ( e.g. , for @xmath68 ) .",
    "one needs now to be careful on how we approach the chaos threshold point ( @xmath69 ) and how the number of iterations ( @xmath30 ) to be used increases to infinity . in mathematical language",
    ", this means that two limits are to be performed simultaneously , namely , @xmath70 and @xmath71 .",
    "it is argued in @xcite that the limit distributions appear to be of @xmath1-gaussian type if these two limits are performed simultaneously in the following special way ( which satisfies an appropriate scaling relation ) .",
    "we first choose a value of @xmath56 above and close to @xmath69 .",
    "we then calculate the quantity @xmath72 defined as follows : @xmath73 where @xmath74 is the feigenbaum constant .",
    "we then denote by @xmath5 the nearest integer value of @xmath75 , and define @xmath76 through @xmath77 the @xmath1-gaussians numerically appear to gradually emerge when we choose @xmath78 and keep making @xmath70 ( hence @xmath79 ) .",
