    "prestellar cores are condensations in molecular clouds that are on the verge of collapse or already collapsing ( e.g. myers & benson 1983 ; ward - thompson et al . 1994 , 1999 ; ward - thompson , andr & kirk 2002 ) .",
    "they represent the first phase in an evolutionary model of star formation that is based on observations of different types of young objects : starless core / prestellar core @xmath14 class 0 @xmath14 class i @xmath14 class ii @xmath14 class iii ( lada 1987 ; andr et al .",

    "the study of starless / prestellar cores is important in constraining the initial conditions for star formation .",
    "prestellar cores have been observed both in groups ( as in e.g ophiuchus , taurus , perseus ) and in relative isolation ( e.g. b68 ; alves et al .",
    "they are very cold ; their temperatures are below 20  k and most probably around 10  k ( evans et al .",
    "2001 ; stamatellos & whitworth 2003a , b ; stamatellos et al .",
    "they are also very dense ; their typical central densities are @xmath15 .",
    "they are observed either at nir wavelengths where they are seen in absorption against the luminous background ( e.g. bacmann et al . 2000 ) , or at fir and submm wavelengths , where they appear in emission ( e.g. motte et al .",
    "1998 ; ward - thompson et al . 2002 ; kirk et al .",
    "the peak of their emission is around 150 - 200  @xmath16 , consistent with the fact that they are very cold .",
    "submm and mm observations are often used to determine the masses of cores ( e.g. motte et al .",
    "1998 ; nutter et al . 2007 ) . at these wavelengths",
    "the core is optically thin to the radiation it emits , hence the observed flux from the core is @xmath17 .",
    "therefore the column density @xmath18 along the line of sight is @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the solid angle of the telescope beam for a resolved source , or the solid angle of the source if unresolved , @xmath18 is the hydrogen column density , @xmath21 is the dust opacity per unit mass , and @xmath22 the temperature of the dust ( hildebrand 1983 ) .",
    "the above relation assumes that the dust is isothermal along the line of sight within the core .",
    "the mass of the core is then determined from the column density , @xmath23 where the integral is over the projected area of the core .",
    "the main uncertainties in determining core masses using the above method come from our limited knowledge of the properties of the dust in cores ( @xmath21 ) and the dust temperature ( @xmath22 ) .",
    "[ eq : col.dens.gen ] is very sensitive to the temperature , since at these low temperatures the planck function is non - linear and the rayleigh - jeans approximation is not valid .",
    "hence , even underestimating or overestimating the core temperature by a few degrees may lead one to overestimate or underestimate the planck function ( and consequently the core mass ) by a factor of 2 to 3 ( stamatellos & whitworth 2005b ) .",
    "it is important then to investigate whether the core temperatures estimated by previous authors using the core sed ( defined by observations at only a few wavelengths ) are actually representative of the dust temperatures in cores .",
    "the aim of this paper is to use detailed 3d radiative transfer modelling , taking into account the core environment ( e.g. nearby luminous sources , ambient cloud ) , to estimate the temperatures in prestellar cores .",
    "we will focus our study on the cores in the @xmath0 oph main cloud , but we will attempt to generalise our results to other star forming regions .",
    "@xmath0 ophiuchi is a star forming region where many prestellar cores have been observed ( see motte et al .",
    "1998 ; nutter et al . 2006 ) along with more evolved protostars ( class 0 , i , ii objects ; e.g. motte et al . 1998 ; bontemps et al . 2001 ; wilking et al . 1989 ; andr & montmerle 1994 ) .",
    "it is one of the closest star - forming regions , being at a distance from 140 to 160  pc ( bontemps et al .",
    "2001 ; motte et al .",
    "1998 ) .",
    "we shall confine our study to the @xmath0 oph main cloud ( i.e. l1688 ) , where six major clumps have been identified ( oph - a , oph - b , oph - c , oph - d , oph - e and oph - f ) .",
    "the prototypical class 0 object vla1623 ( andr et al .",
    "1993 ) is located in the oph - a clump .",
    "each of these clumps contains a few tens of solar masses and has an extent of @xmath24 pc .",
    "these clumps show substructure ; a large number ( @xmath25 ) prestellar cores have been identified in them . the core mass function in the @xmath0",
    "oph main cloud is similar to the stellar imf , which suggests that the masses of stars are determined by fragmentation at a very early stage ( motte et al .",
    "1998 ) .",
    "the external radiation field incident on these clumps is believed to be dominated by hd147889 , a nearby b2v star , which is located at a distance @xmath26 pc away from from the far side of the oph - a clump ( liseau et al .",
    "this is a luminous star of 5500 l@xmath27 ( wilking et al .",
    "1989 ) . assuming a distance of 1 pc and a clump radius of 0.2 pc , if there is no attenuation ,",
    "1% of the star s radiation will heat the clump , i.e. 55 l@xmath27 .",
    "this radiation dwarfs any radiation from other sources ( e.g. the interstellar radiation field , nearby young protostars ) .",
    "observations of the wider area of the main @xmath0 oph cloud ( @xmath28 ) using scuba on the jcmt and comparison with 2mass extinction maps as part of the complete project ( ridge et al .",
    "2006 ) reveal that there are no prestellar cores ( at least down to the scuba detection limit ) at visual extinctions @xmath29 mag ( johnstone et al .",
    "it is presumed that the uv radiation present in regions of low visual extinction makes these regions hostile for star formation ( mckee 1989 ) .",
    "surveys in other star forming regions have also revealed similar extinction thresholds that appear to be connected to the environment of the region ( e.g. in perseus the extinction threshold is lower , @xmath30 mag ; kirk et al .",
    "2006 ) .",
    "thus , it appears that most cores are quite embedded in their parent molecular clouds .",
    "previous radiative transfer simulations of embedded cores suggest that such cores are very cold ( stamatellos & whitworth 2003a , b ; stamatellos et al . 2004 ) .",
    "the temperatures at their centres is around 6  k and at their edges is from around 11  k ( for a core embedded in a parent cloud of @xmath31 ) to 9  k ( for a core embedded in a parent cloud of @xmath32 ) .",
    "this is because the deeper the core is embedded the lower is the strength of the radiation field that heats the core .",
    "hence , it is appropriate to ask whether previous studies of prestellar cores have assumed core temperatures that are consistent with the fact that these cores are deeply embedded in their parental clouds .",
    "we focus our study initially on the @xmath0 oph region .",
    "our goal is to construct a radiative transfer model to estimate the temperature of the cores in this region taking into account the 3d geometry of the region and the role of hd147879 in externally heating the clumps .",
    "we will discuss the applicability of this study to other regions of star formation where low - mass stars form , and to more energetic regions of star formation , such as the orion nebula , by discussing the role of a stronger external radiation field .",
    "the structure of the paper is as follows . in section  3",
    "we discuss the radiative transfer method we use and the constituents of the model ( i.e. radiation sources , model geometry , dust properties , clump density profile ) . in section  4",
    "we describe the results of the radiative transfer modelling with respect to the temperature profile and the seds of the clumps in @xmath0 oph , and in section  5 we discuss the implication of the estimated dust temperature for the core mass function of @xmath0 oph . in section  6",
    ", we discuss the dust temperatures of cores in other star forming regions , and finally in section  7 we summarize our results .",
    "the big clumps of @xmath0 oph are represented by plummer - like density profiles , i.e. we invoke a spherical geometry , with the density being approximately flat in the centres of clumps and dropping as @xmath33 in the envelopes .",
    "we exclude the oph - b1 clump , which is quite flattened , and the oph - e clump , which appears to be part of oph - c .",
    "we shall assume that the cores in the clumps are superimposed on this density profile , without actually taking them individually into account in this model .",
    "however , in section  [ sec : sph ] we shall estimate their effect on the dust temperatures .",
    "we also assume that these clumps are heated ( i ) by the interstellar radiation field and ( ii ) by radiation from the hd14789 b2v star ( see fig.[fig : model ] ) .",
    "we will adopt the 3d model constructed by liseau et al .",

    "the @xmath0 oph a clump is surrounded by a virtual ambient cloud that modulates the incident radiation that heats the clump .",
    "the external heating is provided both by the interstellar radiation field and by hd147889 , a nearby b2v luminous star .",

    "this profile is approximately flat in the central region and falls of as @xmath33 in the envelope , similarly to the more commonly used bonnor - ebert sphere density profile ( ebert 1955 ; bonnor 1956 ) .",
    "additionally , despite being ad hoc , it fits well the observed profiles of prestellar cores and it predicts lifetimes , accretion rates , collapse velocity fields , seds and isophotal maps which agree well with observation , using a minimum number of free parameters ( whitworth & ward - thompson 2001 ) . the adopted values for @xmath35 , @xmath36 and the extent @xmath37 of each clump are listed in table  [ tab : model.params ] . these values are consistent with observations of these clumps ( e.g. motte et al .",
    "1998 ; andr et al .",
    "we assume that the cores in the clumps are superimposed on this density profile ( we re - iterate that at this stage we ignore the sub - structure of the clump ) .",
    "each clump is surrounded by a virtual ambient cloud , which has a uniform density .",
    "the role of these ambient clouds is to modify the ambient radiation field that heats each clump externally .",
    "the optical extinction through the ambient cloud is chosen so that the peak of computed sed of each clump corresponds to a dust temperature that matches the dust temperature of each clump assumed by previous authors .",
    "the optical extinctions of the assumed ambient clouds around each one of the @xmath0 oph clumps are also listed in table  [ tab : model.params ] .",
    "we use two kinds of dust ; one for the clumps , and one for the ambient cloud ( fig .",

    "are expected to coagulate and accrete ice mantles , so we use the ossenkopf & henning ( 1994 ) opacities for mrn dust that has coagulated and accreted thin ice mantles for a period of @xmath38 years at a density @xmath39  @xmath40 .",
    "the ambient cloud has relatively low density and it can be considered as a part of the interstellar medium .",

    "since cores are observed at visual extinctions @xmath1 mag , the temperatures  of the cores in oph - a are most probably below 11  k , and in oph - b2 , oph - c , oph - d and oph - f below 10  k. these temperatures correspond to the temperature of the clumps where the cores are embedded , at visual extinctions @xmath88 mag .",

    "motte et al . ( 1998 ) calculated the core mass function of the @xmath0 oph main cloud by assuming a temperature of 20  k for oph - a , 12  k for oph - b , oph - c , and oph - d , and 15  k for oph - e and oph - f .",

    "the rayleigh - jeans relation is not a good approximation and the planck function must be used ; hence even overestimating temperatures by a few k leads to underestimating masses by a factor of @xmath92 .",

    "( 2004 ) suggest that most of the cores in this region are embedded at @xmath94 mag or at even higher extinctions .",
    "hence the temperatures of many of the cores are expected to be even lower ( by @xmath85  k ) .",

    "the dust temperatures of prestellar cores are determined by the ambient radiation field heating the core ( since by definition there are no radiation sources inside the core ) .",
    "this radiation field is determined by environmental factors .",
    "it depends ( i ) on how deeply the core is embedded in its ambient cloud , and ( ii ) on the possible presence of nearby radiation sources , and their relative position / distance with respect to the core .",

    ", we follow the approach of stamatellos et al .",
    "( 2004 ) where the radiation field incident on the core is a direct result of the presence ( i ) of the ambient cloud that surrounds the core , ( ii ) of nearby embedded young protostars , ( iii ) of nearby luminous stars . the ambient cloud of each core / clump attenuates the isrf , as it acts like a shield to uv , visual and nir interstellar radiation , absorbing and re - emitting it in the fir .",
    "the nearby young protostars and stars also enhance the radiation field incident on core , mainly at long wavelengths ( @xmath95 ) due to the thermal emission from the outer regions of the heated ambient cloud ( mathis et al .",
    "1983 ) , as short wavelength radiation can not penetrate deep into the cloud .      in the previous sections we discussed in detail the region of the @xmath0 oph main cloud , where the external heating is dominated by a nearby b2v star . due to the presence of this star and embedded protostars in the @xmath0 oph main cloud",
    "the external radiation field is stronger than the standard isrf by a factor of @xmath96 ( the bolometric luminosity of the isrf heating the core is @xmath97 whereas the bolometric luminosity of the star s radiation reaching and heating each clump is @xmath98 ) .",

    "thus , the dust temperatures estimated by our model for the @xmath0 oph main cloud are upper limits to the temperatures of the cores in taurus .",
    "indeed , observations of tmc-1c , a prestellar core in in taurus ( schnee & goodman 2005 ; schnee et al . 2006 ) , suggest dust temperatures that drop from 11  k at the edge of the core ( @xmath100 ) to 5  k at its centre ( @xmath101 ) , which are consistent with heating from an isrf that is weaker than the standard isrf .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : tmc ] we present a model for tmc-1c . based on the estimates from schnee et al .",

    "oph a as a representative clump , and consider heating from a b2v star ( similar to hd147889 ) with different temperatures and at different distances from the centre of the clump .",
