    "<S> the author showed that @xmath2 and @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> together with the result @xmath4 by keaney and shiu , these results strongly suggest that @xmath5 for @xmath6 , in particular for the values @xmath7 , which correspond to cases that lie in between the previous results .    in this article </S>",
    "<S> we show that indeed @xmath5 for @xmath7 , implying that the most efficient packings of 22 and 33 squares are the trivial ones . to achieve our results , we modify the well - known method of sets of unavoidable points by replacing them with continuously varying families of such sets . </S>"
