    "@xcite ) . the calculation of correlation functions of a ll gas from the wave functions is a difficult task ; these functions furnish observables like the momentum distribution of particles in the gas , and were studied by using various approaches ( e.g. , see refs .",
    "time - dependent phenomena in the context of ll gases with finite - strength interactions have been addressed by using both analytical @xcite and numerical methods ( see , e.g. , refs .",
    "irregular dynamics of a ll gas was studied numerically in a mesoscopic system in ref .",

    "exact solutions for 1d bose gases are conveniently constructed by using the fermi - bose mapping techniques @xcite . in 1960",
