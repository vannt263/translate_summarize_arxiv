    "big bang nucleosynthesis ( bbn ) is a powerful tool to test physics beyond the standard model .",
    "recently , it has been realized that the presence of heavy long - lived negatively charged particles @xmath1 can have a substantial impact on the primordial light element abundances via bound - state formation  @xcite . in particular ,",
    "when @xmath1 and @xmath2 form coulomb bound states , @xmath4 , too much @xmath0 can be produced via the catalyzed bbn ( cbbn ) reaction  @xcite @xmath5 the formation of @xmath4 and hence the cbbn production of @xmath0 becomes efficient at temperatures @xmath6 , i.e. , at cosmic times @xmath7 at which standard bbn ( sbbn ) processes are already frozen out . the observationally inferred bound on the primordial @xmath0 abundance then restricts severely the @xmath1 abundance at such times . a long - lived @xmath1 may be realized if the gravitino is the lightest supersymmetric particle ( lsp ) . in particular , it is reasonable to consider gravitino lsp scenarios within the constrained minimal supersymmetric standard model ( cmssm )  @xcite in which the gaugino masses , the scalar masses , and the trilinear scalar couplings are parameterized by their respective universal values @xmath8 , @xmath9 , and @xmath10 at the scale of grand unification @xmath11 .",
    "within this framework , the lighter stau @xmath12 is the lightest standard model superpartner in a large region of the parameter space and thus a well - motivated candidate for the next - to - lightest supersymmetric particle ( nlsp ) . since its couplings to the gravitino lsp",
    "are suppressed by the ( reduced ) planck scale , @xmath13 , the stau will typically be long - lived for conserved @xmath14-parity and thus @xmath3 can play the role of @xmath1 . in scenarios with conserved @xmath14-parity , the gravitino lsp is stable and a promisig dark matter candidate .",
    "gravitinos can be produced efficiently in thermal scattering of particles in the primordial plasma .",
    "if the universe , after inflation , enters the radiation dominated epoch with a high reheating temperature @xmath15 , the resulting gravitino density @xmath16 will contribute substantially to the dark matter density @xmath17  @xcite . in this work",
    "we calculate the amount of @xmath0 produced in  ( [ eq : cbbn - reaction ] ) by following the treatment of ref .  @xcite . in particluar",
    ", we employ a recent state - of - the - art result for the cbbn reaction cross reaction  @xcite .",
    "the obtained upper limit on the @xmath1 abundance from possible @xmath0 overproduction vanishes for sufficiently short @xmath18 .",
    "this allows us to extract a lower limit on the universal gaugino mass parameter @xmath8 within minimal supergravity scenarios where the gravitino is the lsp and the @xmath1 is the @xmath3 nlsp .",
    "that exceeds the freeze - out temperature @xmath19 of the @xmath12 nlsp . ]",
    "this limit leads directly to an upper bound on @xmath15 since @xmath16 can not exceed the observed dark matter density .",
    "the bounds on @xmath8 and @xmath15 derived below depend on the gravitino mass but are independent of the cmssm parameters .    before proceeding , let us comment on the present status of bbn constraints on gravitino dark matter scenarios with a long - lived charged slepton nlsp .",
    "in a recent ambitious study  @xcite it is argued that bound - state formation of @xmath1 with protons at @xmath20 might well reprocess large fractions of the previously synthesized @xmath0 .",
    "this seems to relax the bound on the @xmath1 abundance for @xmath21 .",
    "however , at present , the uncertainties in the relevant nuclear reaction rates in  @xcite make it difficult to decide whether a new cosmologically allowed region will open up . in this work",
    "we assume that this is not the case , in particular , since the @xmath22he / d constraint on electromagnetic energy release  @xcite becomes severe in this region and excludes stau lifetimes @xmath23  @xcite .",
    "then only the constraint from hadronic energy release on d  @xcite can be slightly more severe than the one from catalyzed @xmath24li production  @xcite .",
    "we neglect the d constraint in this work since it can only tighten the bounds on @xmath8 and @xmath15 as can be seen , e.g. , in figs .  4  ( b  d ) and  5 of ref .  @xcite . for deriving conservative bounds on @xmath8 and @xmath15 ,",
    "it is thus sufficient to consider the cbbn reaction  ( [ eq : cbbn - reaction ] ) exclusively .",
    "the following set of boltzmann equations  @xcite describe the time evolution of bound - state ( bs ) formation of @xmath1 with @xmath2 and the associated evolution of the primordial light elements involved :    [ eq : boltzmann - eqs ] @xmath25    here we scale out the expansion of the universe by defining the yield @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the number density of species @xmath28 and @xmath29 is the entropy density . in particular , @xmath30 , @xmath31 , @xmath32 , @xmath33 , and @xmath34 denote the yields of the @xmath4 bound state , free @xmath1 , free @xmath2 , @xmath0 produced in cbbn , and @xmath35 , respectively .",
    "the quantity @xmath36 parameterizes the competition between recombination and photo - dissociation of bound states . for the latter , one defines @xmath37 with  @xcite @xmath38 where @xmath39  @xcite is the @xmath4 binding energy and @xmath40 .",
    "furthermore , @xmath41 denotes the total decay width of @xmath1 .",
    "the cbbn reaction cross section for the process  ( [ eq : cbbn - reaction ] ) has recently been computed with an advanced method from nuclear physics  @xcite @xmath42 which is given in units of @xmath43 with @xmath44 denoting the temperature in units of @xmath45 .",
    "the recombination cross section of @xmath1 with @xmath2 is estimated as  @xcite @xmath46 with @xmath47  @xcite and @xmath48 . )",
    "assumes a radiative capture of @xmath1 into the 1s bound state of a point - like @xmath49 particle .",
    "we use , however , @xmath50 obtained numerically in  @xcite rather than the bohr - like formula @xmath51 ; @xmath52 . ]",
    "produced in cbbn obtained by solving  ( [ eq : boltzmann - eqs ] ) ( solid lines ) and by using the saha type approximation for @xmath30 instead of computing  ( [ eq : boltz - bs ] ) ( dashed lines).,scaledwidth=45.0% ]    we solve  ( [ eq : boltzmann - eqs ] ) using as initial conditions the respective @xmath1 yield prior to decay , @xmath53 , and the sbbn output values of the computer code  ` parthenope `  @xcite : @xmath54 , @xmath55 , @xmath56 , and @xmath57 ; furthermore , @xmath58 and @xmath59 .",
    "while the variation of the @xmath35 and @xmath2 abundances from their sbbn values are negligible , the catalyzed fusion of @xmath0 is substantial as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] by the contour - lines of @xmath60 ( solid lines ) .",
    "contrasting with the observationally inferred upper limit on the primordial @xmath0 abundance  @xcite , @xmath61 one sees clearly that @xmath62 can be far in excess .",
    "the dashed lines in fig .  [ fig:1 ] show the solution of ( [ eq : boltzmann - eqs ] ) where instead of ( [ eq : boltz - bs ] ) the saha type equation @xmath63 is used as an approximation for the bound - state abundance .",
    "the obtained overestimation of the @xmath0 abundance demonstrates the importance of the use of the boltzmann equation  ( [ eq : boltz - bs ] ) .",
    "however , focusing on @xmath64 , we will read off the relevant constraint in the region @xmath65 in which the slope of the @xmath0 contours is very steep .",
    "therefore , the use of ( [ eq : boltz - bs ] ) instead of the saha type equation is an improvement on the conceptional side which has only a marginal effect on the bounds to be derived . by the same token , and from the comparison of our results with  @xcite",
    ", we find that also the destruction of @xmath0 due to @xmath1 decays affects those bounds only marginally .",
    "applying the above results to gravitino dark matter scenarios with the lighter stau @xmath12 as the nlsp , we now derive the conservative lower limit on @xmath8 .",
    "the stau nlsp with a mass of @xmath66 decouples from the primordial plasma with a typical yield of @xmath67  @xcite . with @xmath68",
    ", we find from fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] that the amount of @xmath0 produced in cbbn can be in agreement with ( [ eq : li - obs ] ) only for stau lifetimes of @xmath69 as can be seen from the supergravity prediction @xmath70 the requirement ( [ eq : lifetimebound ] ) implies a lower limit on the splitting between @xmath71 and @xmath72 provided @xmath73 .",
    "because of this hierarchy , the factor @xmath74 can be neglected in the following .",
    "let us now turn to the cmssm . in the region",
    "in which  @xmath12 is the nlsp , we find @xmath75 by scanning over the following parameter range : @xmath76 with @xmath9 as large as viable for a @xmath12 nlsp . here",
    "@xmath77 is the ratio of the two mssm higgs doublet vacuum expectation values and @xmath78 the higgsino mass parameter . for the top quark mass . in addition",
    ", we use the standard model parameters @xmath79 , @xmath80 , @xmath81 . ] for small left - right mixing , @xmath82 , ( [ eq : mstau - estimate ] ) can be understood qualitatively from the estimate for the mass of the right - handed stau @xmath83 near the electroweak scale @xcite @xmath84 since @xmath85 in a large part of the @xmath12 nlsp region .",
    "in fact , ( [ eq : mstau - estimate ] ) tends to be saturated for larger @xmath9 , i.e. , in the stau - neutralino - coannihilation region where the mass of the lightest neutralino @xmath86 .",
    "this can be understood since the neutralino is bino - like in this region so that @xmath87 . and",
    "valid in the @xmath8 region in which also the lep bound on the higgs mass  @xcite , @xmath88 , is respected . ] in the remaining part of the stau nlsp region , smaller values of @xmath66 satisfying , e.g. , @xmath89 can easily be found .    to be on the conservative side",
    ", we set the stau nlsp mass @xmath66 to its maximum value at which ( [ eq : mstau - estimate ] ) is saturated : @xmath90 .",
    "then , constraint  ( [ eq : lifetimebound ] ) together with  ( [ eq : taustau ] ) yields @xmath91 which is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:2 ] .     values . below the dashed line ,",
    "@xmath92 is possible.,scaledwidth=45.0% ]    the shaded region is disfavored by  ( [ eq : li - obs ] ) . below the dashed line ,",
    "@xmath93 is possible .",
    "since for a @xmath12 nlsp typically @xmath94 , it is the gaugino mass parameter @xmath8 which sets the scale for the low energy superparticle spectrum .",
    "thus , depending on @xmath72 , the bound  ( [ eq : lowerlimitm12 ] ) implies rather high values of the superparticle masses .",
    "this is particularly true for the masses of the squarks and the gluino since their renormalization group running from @xmath95 to @xmath96 is dominated by @xmath97 .",
    "since these masses govern the size of the total cross section for the production of superparticles at the large hadron collider ( lhc ) , the cosmologically favored region for @xmath98 is associated with a mass range that will be very difficult to probe at the lhc .",
    "let us stress at this point that the bounds  ( [ eq : lifetimebound ] ) and  ( [ eq : lowerlimitm12 ] ) and their severe implications for phenomenology at the lhc are valid only for the assumed standard cosmological history with @xmath99 and the associated considered values of @xmath100 .",
    "for example , non - standard entropy production after the thermal @xmath12 nlsp freeze out and before bbn might dilute the stau abundance prior to decay .",
    "thereby , the @xmath8 limit can be relaxed  @xcite . also for the case of inflation with a low reheating temperature , @xmath101 , one can obtain a stau abundance prior to decay that respects the @xmath0 constraint even for @xmath102  @xcite .",
    "thus , for a non - standard cosmolocial history , an observation of staus with @xmath102 and other cmssm phenomenology at the lhc could still be viable even in gravitino lsp scenarios with @xmath98 .",
    "the amount of gravitinos produced in thermal scattering is sensitive to the reheating temperature @xmath15 and to the masses of the gauginos and hence to @xmath8  @xcite . for a standard cosmological history ,",
    "the associated gravitino density can be approximated by , see sec .  2 in ref .",
    "@xmath103 this follows from eq .",
    "( 3 ) of ref .  @xcite .",
    "here we use that the running gaugino masses @xmath104 associated with the gauge groups @xmath105 , @xmath106 , and @xmath107 satisfy @xmath108 at a representative scale of @xmath109 at which we also evaluate the respective gauge couplings .",
    "furthermore , we only need to take into account the production of the spin-@xmath110 components of the gravitino since ( [ eq : lowerlimitm12 ] ) implies @xmath111 for @xmath112 .    for a given @xmath8 ,",
    "the reheating temperature @xmath15 is limited from above because @xmath16 can not exceed the dark matter density  @xcite @xmath113 where @xmath114 is the hubble constant in units of @xmath115 .",
    "requiring @xmath116 and using the derived lower bound ( [ eq : lowerlimitm12 ] ) allows us to extract the conservative upper limit : @xmath117 this constraint is a slowly varying function of @xmath72 : @xmath118 for @xmath119 .",
    "therefore , ( [ eq : upperlimittr ] ) poses a strong bound on @xmath15 for the natural gravitino lsp mass range in gravity - mediated supersymmetry breaking scenarios .",
    "note that the constraint  ( [ eq : upperlimittr ] ) relies on thermal gravitino production only .",
    "in addition , gravitinos are produced in stau nlsp decays with the respective density @xmath120 where @xmath121 = 3.6\\times 10^{-9}\\ { \\mathrm{gev}}$ ]  @xcite .",
    "while the precise value of @xmath122 depends on the concrete choice of the cmssm parameters , the upper limit ( [ eq : upperlimittr ] ) can only become more stringent by taking @xmath123 into account .",
    "for exemplary cmssm scenarios , this can be seen from the @xmath124 planes shown in figs .  4 and 5 of ref .",
    "@xcite . ) . ]",
    "these figures illustrate that the severe limits ( [ eq : lowerlimitm12 ] ) and ( [ eq : upperlimittr ] ) are conservative bounds .",
    "we have considered the catalysis of @xmath0 production in cmssm scenarios with the gravitino lsp and the stau nlsp . within a standard cosmological history , the calculated @xmath0 abundance drops below the observational limit on primordial @xmath0 for @xmath125 .",
    "taken at face value , we find that this constraint translates into a lower limit @xmath126 in the entire natural region of the cmssm parameter space .",
    "this implies a conservative upper bound @xmath127 .",
    "the bounds on @xmath8 and @xmath15 not only confirm our previous findings  @xcite but are also independent of the particular values of the cmssm parameters for the considered @xmath12 nlsp abundances .      _",
    "note added : _ after submission of this work , a substantially revised version  ( v3 ) of  @xcite together with  @xcite appeared on the ` arxiv ` .",
    "the results of these works affect our limits only mildly . because of the huge effect of  ( [ eq : cbbn - reaction ] ) on the @xmath0 abundance , our relatively simple treatment of cbbn is sufficient for our purposes .",
    "this is also confirmed by a direct comparison of our data with figs .  1 and  2 of the more elaborate cbbn treatment in  @xcite for @xmath128 ( @xmath129 , i.e. , @xmath130 ) @xcite at the relevant times of @xmath131 .",
    "for a given @xmath132 bound , the effect on the @xmath133 limit is less than a factor of 1.5 .",
