    "globular clusters ( gcs ) are generally old stellar systems and are believed to be the first objects to form in the process of the formation of a galaxy .",
    "this is supported by age estimates from observations of gcs in the milky way and other nearby galaxies .",
    "the large magellanic cloud ( lmc ) is however known to host several young blue `` populous '' clusters , which could be young globular clusters . in the recent years",
    "blue globular cluster candidates have been found in some interacting / merging galaxies such as ngc  3597 ( lutz 1990 , holtzman et al .",
    "1996 ) , ngc  7252 ( whitmore et al .",
    "1993 ) , `` the antennae '' ( whitmore & schweizer 1995 ) and ngc  3921 ( schweizer et al .",
    "this has strengthened the idea that gcs can form not only when galaxies form , but also when galaxies are reformed in the process of galaxy mergers ( schweizer 1986 , ashman & zepf 1992 , whitmore 1996 ) .",
    "this could possibly also circumvent the problem , faced by the idea that elliptical galaxies form by the merging of late type galaxies , that ellipticals have higher specific frequencies of globular clusters ( van den bergh 1984 , 1994 ) . understanding how and when gcs can form",
    "will thus not only help us in understanding these systems , but also aid in understanding galaxy formation and evolution .",
    "studies of actively star - forming galaxies , e.g. henize 2 - 10 ( conti et al . 1994 ) , ngc  1244 ( hunter et al . 1994 ) , ngc  1705 ( oconnell et al .",
    "1994 ) , ngc  1569 ( de marchi et al . 1997 ) and m82 ( oconnell 1995 ) have revealed the presence of star clusters with luminosities comparable to r126 , the central cluster of 30 doradus in the lmc , and higher .",
    "meurer et al.(1995 ) used the hst for an ultraviolet study of nine starburst galaxies and found bright `` super star clusters '' in all .",
    "these clusters are generally bluer than similar objects found in interacting galaxies , and are preferentially found in the central regions of the starbursts .",
    "it has been proposed ( e.g. conti et al . 1994 ) that these blue objects might be forming globular clusters .",
    "this is however still an open question since it is not clear if these systems will survive as gravitationally bound systems .",
    "uncertainties in the value of the ( universal ? )",
    "stellar initial mass function ( imf ) makes the mass estimates , mainly based on ultraviolet data , highly uncertain , especially since some studies only includes one spectral bandpass .",
    "many of these galaxies appear to be involved in some form of interaction .",
    "one could interpret these observations as evidence that massive star clusters can form in regions of very active star formation , such as giant extragalactic hii - regions ( gehrs ) like 30 doradus .",
    "kennicutt and chu ( 1988 ) made a statistical investigation of data on extragalactic blue populous clusters and giant hii - regions .",
    "they concluded that the young clusters in lmc are not luminous enough to evolve into globular clusters comparable to the massive galactic ones , and that far from all gehrs will produce young populous clusters that could become gcs .",
    "blue compact galaxies ( bcgs ) are characterised by their blue colours ( @xmath8 ) , strong nebular emission lines , indicative of the formation of relatively hot ( massive ) stars , and low chemical abundances .",
    "the derived star formation rates could , considering the gas supply , only be sustained for a small fraction of a hubble time .",
    "this together with the low metallicities ( with izw18 being the extreme in this sense ) once lead to the idea that bcgs might be genuinely young objects now experiencing their first star formation epoch ( sargent and searle 1970 ) .",
    "now , most bcgs are believed to be old , experiencing recurrent bursts of star formation intervened by long quiescent periods .",
    "still we do not yet understand what triggers these bursts of star formation .",
    "one possible trigger mechanism is tidal or direct interactions with companion galaxies or gas clouds .    in this paper",
    "we will present conclusive evidence for young and old globular clusters in the blue compact galaxy eso  338-ig04 .",
    "section 2 describes the observations and sect .",
    "3 describes how photometry was performed on the globular cluster candidates . in sect .",
    "4 we show that the objects are physically associated with the galaxy and that they are spatially resolved . in sect .",
    "5 we discuss how the observed photometric properties can be interpreted in terms of age and mass of the objects .",
    "section 6 includes a further discussion on the nature of the cluster candidates , and sect .",
    "7 contains the conclusions .",
    "eso  338-ig04 , also known as tol  1924 - 416 , resides at a distance of 37.5 mpc ( @xmath9 km  s@xmath10 , @xmath11 km s@xmath10 mpc@xmath10 ; this value will be used throughout the rest of the paper ) at the celestial coordinates @xmath12 .",
    "it is intrinsically bright ( @xmath13 ) and blue ( @xmath14 ) , ( bergvall and stlin 1998 ) . the oxygen abundance is @xmath15 of the solar value ( bergvall , 1985 ) .",
    "it s physical size is small , @xmath16 kpc measured at @xmath17 , the non dwarfish luminosity being due to the active star burst .",
    "it has an integrated hi - mass of @xmath18 ( stlin et al .",
    "1997b ) . the optical velocity field of eso  338-ig04 show rotation aligned with it s apparent major axis , though with several large scale irregular features , and",
    "it is most easily understood as a merger between two galaxies or a galaxy and a gas cloud ( stlin et al .",
    "this is supported by the optical tail , extending towards the east .",
    "it has a spectroscopically confirmed companion galaxy ( bergvall unpublished ; stlin et al .",
    "1997a ) which lies at a projected distance of 70 kpc , see fig .",
    "the companion is a somewhat fainter ( @xmath19 ) , star forming galaxy which shows regular rotation ( stlin et al .",
    "bergvall noticed , in ground based images , an apparent concentration of faint blobs around the galaxy , which he interpreted as globular cluster candidates . we have re - observed this galaxy with the hst and will in the subsequent sections",
    "show that there is substantial evidence that this galaxy has formed massive globular clusters at several epochs .    in july 1997 , we obtained spectra of a few of the brightest globular cluster candidates , using the eso new technology telescope ( ntt ) , at la silla , chile .",
    "the results from this spectroscopic study will be presented in a future publication .",
    "the field of eso  338-ig04 was observed with the planetary camera ( pc ) aperture ( centred on @xmath20 ,  @xmath21 , with the hst v3-axis at position angle 70.0 degrees ) of wfpc2 onboard hubble space telescope on april 29 , 1996 .",
    "exposures were taken in the f218w(1800s ) , f336w(900s ) , f439w(800s ) , f555w(260s ) and f814w(520s ) filters .",
    "each exposure was split in two to facilitate removal of cosmic rays .",
    "the work presented in this paper is based on the f336w , f439w , f555w and f814w data .",
    "the f218w data is underexposed and will be used only for the brightest super star clusters in the central starburst component , which will be discussed in a forthcoming paper .",
    "the pixel scale of the pc ccd is 0.0455 arcseconds , which at a distance of 37.5 mpc corresponds to 8.27 pc .",
    "data produced with the standard pipeline processing was used .",
    "additional reductions was performed with the stsdas package in iraf .",
    "additional hot pixels were examined using the warmpix task .",
    "images cleaned from cosmic rays were produced using the crrej task and the few remaining bad pixels were removed with the cosmicrays task .",
    "the f336w data have been corrected for `` uv contamination '' ( a gradual loss of uv throughput in between the monthly heating of the ccds ) using the quoted values in the hst data handbook ( table 41.2 ) .",
    "we used the photometric zero - points for vega ( vegamag ) given in the hst data handbook , version 2 , ( table 41.1 ) , and will use the notation @xmath22 , @xmath23 , @xmath24 and @xmath25 for the magnitudes in this system , sometimes @xmath26 , @xmath27 , @xmath28 , and @xmath29 may be used , e.g. for colour indices , @xmath30 etc .",
    "these zero - points give colours that agree with those of the standard @xmath31 kron - cousins ( kc ) system for a0v stars . for stars with spectral type differing a lot from a0v and for composite stellar systems ( e.g. galaxies ) ,",
    "the colours in the hst - vega system may differ appreciably from the kc colours ( wfpc2 instrument handbook , version 4 , tab 8.1 , see also holtzman et al .",
    "1995b ) . for most objects",
    "our resulting photometry is reasonably close to the standard kc @xmath32 ( f336w ) @xmath33 ( f439w ) , @xmath34 ( f555w ) and @xmath35 ( f814w ) filter system .",
    "however , as is shown in section 5.1 , our results are not sensitive to the similarity with the kc - system , since we used the actual filter profiles and model spectra to interpret the observed colours . for comparison with other published data on extragalactic globular cluster systems",
    "it is however convenient to use a photometric system close to the standard .",
    "the reduced images show a bright `` chaotic '' starburst region with several very bright knots and filamentary emission , superimposed on a redder ( @xmath36 ) component with lower surface brightness ( @xmath37 , the extrapolated central surface brightness obtained by fitting an inclination corrected disc between 1.5 and 2.5 kpc of the underlying component ) .",
    "the starburst region is surrounded by a system of point - like objects clearly concentrated towards the centre of the galaxy .",
    "figure 2 shows the reduced f814w image of eso  338-ig04 , and fig .",
    "3 a magnification of the central parts . due to the fairly short exposure times , the faint outer parts of the galaxy are not clearly visible .",
    "this means that most objects found outside the bright central component in the pc field of view are actually within eso  338-ig04 .",
    "the faintest parts of the galaxy extend far from the starburst centre , into the wide field ccds , primary wfc4 and wfc3 .",
    "in addition to the objects presented in this paper , the wfc ccds contain a few objects which likely are associated with eso  338-ig04 .",
    "figures 1 and 2 reveals several point - like objects . it is not obvious how to perform photometry of these objects . for objects outside the main body ,",
    "crowding problems are generally small and normal aperture photometry will be adequate . for the sources in the centre , several complications add .",
    "first , crowding poses severe difficulties in subtracting the background , and secondly gas emission , both line and continuos , associated with the bright young clusters and the filaments contaminate the broad - band colours and adds to creating an uneven background .",
    "these two subsets of objects will be referred to as the@xmath38 and the@xmath39sample .    to estimate the amount of milky way extinction along the line of sight we used the data by burstein and heiles ( 1982 ) which gives @xmath40 . to de - redden the data we applied this extinction and the average interstellar extinction curve ( osterbrock , 1989 ) .",
    ", in all figures and tables in this paper , the data have been corrected for this galactic reddening .",
    "in addition there will be internal extinction in the target galaxy and in the cluster candidates themselves ; this issue will be discussed in sect .",
    "5.3 . in none of the tables or figures , any correction for internal extinction has been applied to the data . to convert apparent magnitudes to absolute we used a distance modulus of 32.87 based on the distance 37.5 mpc and the above correction for milky way extinction .",
    "this of course assumes all objects to be at the distance of the target galaxy , which as we will see in sect . 4",
    "is strongly supported .",
    "we have identified all faint point - like sources in the pc images by eye , excluding obvious galaxies and diffuse sources . for the sources outside the crowded central regions , @xmath41 sources brighter than @xmath42 ( before extinction and aperture correction ) were found . to obtain photometry of these",
    "we have used the iraf task phot in the apphot package .",
    "photometry was performed at 40 different apertures with radii ranging from 0.2 to 9 pixels .",
    "then a mean growth curve were constructed from the best ( high signal - to - noise and well behaved growth curve ) objects for each filter .",
    "the magnitude of each individual object have been calculated by averaging up to 8 points ( fewer for faint objects with noisy growth curve ) where the differential growth curve ( the difference between the growth curve for the object and the mean growth curve ) is flat , normalised to an aperture with a radius of 9 pixels .",
    "this gives more accurate results than single aperture photometry since the magnitude is calculated from several points where the profile is well behaved , e.g. image artefacts like remaining hits will have little effect on photometry . furthermore , as will be shown , the objects are generally spatially resolved ; therefore methods using point spread function ( psf ) fitting , like daophot , will not work well .",
    "the sky was subtracted using the median pixel value in a 4 pixels wide annulus starting at a radius of 10 pixels from the object to be measured .",
    "aperture corrections were determined using table 2a in holtzman et al .",
    "( 1995a ) and taking into account both the fraction of the stellar flux outside the aperture radius of 9 pixels and the fraction of the stellar flux falling into the sky annulus .",
    "this photometric scheme works well for all objects outside the main body where crowding is not a problem . we have experimented with using smaller apertures and a closer sky annulus and have obtained consistent results .",
    "it is possible to achieve a higher formal signal - to - noise ( s / n ) , as measured by the photon statistics , by using a smaller aperture .",
    "this has the cost that centring errors will be introduced and the aperture corrections will be less accurate , depending on the extent of the object ; i.e. the effective s / n will not be higher .",
    "the data have not been corrected for geometric distortion in the pc since the objects are generally found far from the edges of the chip and the induced errors would in all cases be smaller than the photometric uncertainties ( maximum a few percent at the corners of the chip , hst data handbook ) . furthermore , geometric distortion would not alter the colours of objects , on which most of the analysis here is based .",
    "the photometry is presented in table 1 for the f336w , f439w , f555w and f814w data , where we have used the zero points for vega .",
    "figure 4 displays the photometric errors as a function of magnitude for the four different filters . due to their typical colours ,",
    "most objects are found in the f814w images , and least in the f336w images .",

& - & -7.2 & 1.98 & -0.47 & - +      in the main body there are several very bright point - like objects . in general , these are spatially extended , as will be discussed in sect .",
    "photometry is more difficult here and the above approach would fail due to severe crowding problems",
    ". moreover , the central part of the f555w images are severely affected by [ oiii]@xmath54 emission .",
    "contamination from gaseous emission is less problematic in the other filters since no bright lines are within the band - passes .",
    "the filaments do however also produce continuous emission which may cause problems for photometry in all filters , mainly because they contribute to make the background highly variable on small scales . since the objects are not true point sources it is hazardous to apply standard psf fitting methods like daophot",
    ". a possible approach would be to fit a mean psf for the intrinsically extended sources and use daophot with this as input psf .",
    "this does not work in practice since there is no well defined average profile for the objects and the final residuals from the psf subtraction becomes unacceptably large .    to extract information on the colours and luminosities of the sources in the centre we instead used simple aperture photometry in small apertures with radius 3 pixels .",
    "the sky was subtracted using the median in an annulus from 4 to 6 pixels .",
    "the small aperture was selected to minimise problems with neighbouring objects entering the aperture .",
    "this has the cost that centring errors may be important and aperture corrections may be inaccurate .",
    "the sky annulus was chosen to be close to the objects due the large amplitude of the small scale background brightness fluctuations .",
    "as for the outer sample , no correction for geometric distortion has been applied .",
    "contamination from [ oiii]@xmath54 emission in the f555w band can be serious for these objects ( see fig .",
    "5 ) , therefore more reliable colours of the stellar population may be achieved using the photometry in the f814w , f439w and f336w filters , which are free of strong nebular emission lines .",
    "the inner objects are , in general , bluer than the sources outside the main body .",
    "the photometric data for these objects are shown in table 2 and fig . 4 , and includes the formal photometric uncertainties .",
    "generally the photometry for the inner sample is less certain and the errors are probably larger than the quoted uncertainties , due to centring errors and background subtraction problems .",
    "e.g. our experiments show that centring errors may be as large as 0.05 magnitudes .",
    "these additional errors are not included in the entries in table 2 .",
    ", so for a fair comparison with the outer sample , the errors of the objects in the inner sample should be scaled up with approximately a factor of two .    lllllllllllllll object & x - coord & y

    "there is an apparent concentration of faint point - like objects near eso  338-ig04 .",
    "this was realised already from studying ground based images , and was one motive for studying this galaxy with hst .",
    "the apparent over density of faint objects was the first reason why these were suspected to be associated with eso  338-ig04 .",
    "as will be shown in this section , our new hst observations confirm the physical association of these faint objects with eso  338-ig04 .",
    "there is a clear concentration and over density of faint point - like objects around the galaxy ( figs . 2 and 9 ) .",
    "the distribution shows a spatial flattening which agrees closely with the isophotal shape of the galaxy at radii greater than 150 pixels ( 1.2 kpc ) , see fig .",
    "9 . this suggests a coeval formation of the galaxy and the population of outer objects and that the system is dynamically relaxed .      utilising the galaxy model by bahcall and soneira ( 1981 )",
    "we find that the predicted number of foreground stars brighter than @xmath62 magnitudes is approximately one within our @xmath63 pc field .",
    "thus the expected contamination of foreground stars is very small .",
    "however the bahcall and soneira model does not include the galactic halo .",
    "therefore we also examined the adjacent wide field camera ( wfc ) wfc2 and wfc3 fields of the wfpc2 ( wfc4 contains a larger fraction of the faint extensions of the target galaxy and was not included ) and counted all stellar objects brighter than the @xmath64 magnitude in @xmath24 and @xmath25 . in all",
    ", we found 67 objects with @xmath65 , and 28 objects with @xmath66 .",
    "the pc area coverage is 1/10 of that of two wfc chips , excluding the vignetted areas , so we would then suspect 6.7 and 2.8 stars in our pc field in f814w and f555w respectively from this comparison .",
    "this is however an overestimate since on the wfc chips some hits / hot pixels are left which will be hard to distinguish from faint stars due to the large pixel scale .",
    "also the bright part of the target galaxy covers more than 1/10th of the area on the pc , and any faint foreground star would completely drown in the light from the bright starburst .",
    "furthermore , it is possible that some sources in the wfc fields near the border to the pc field are actually objects associated with eso  338-ig04 .",
    "taking this into account we expect to find less than 5 and 2 foreground stars brighter than the @xmath64 magnitude in f814w and f555w respectively .",
    "also , since the number of foreground stars per magnitude interval increases when going to fainter magnitudes , they will primarily appear at the faint red end of our distribution , while most of our discussion will consider brighter objects .",
    "we conclude from these two estimates , that not more than a few objects are expected to be galactic stars , and in that case primarily some of the faint red ones",
    ". one obvious foreground star ( which in fact is an apparent double ) is located approximately five arcseconds to the west of the centre of eso  338-ig04 ( fig 2 ) .      another way to estimate",
    "the probability that some of the objects could be foreground stars is to calculate their photometric distances . by assuming them to be main sequence stars with spectral class given by their @xmath30 colour",
    ", we can determine their absolute magnitudes and calculate their distance modulii .",
    "for this purpose we used the @xmath67 versus @xmath68 relation by jarrett ( 1992 ) .",
    "for all outer objects for which we measured both the @xmath25 and @xmath24 magnitude , the photometric distances were calculated .",
    "all but 3 ( out of 70 ) objects have photometric distances larger than 13 kpc , excluding the possibility of them being milky way stars .",
    "three objects have lower photometric distances : object no .",
    "34 ( 9 kpc ) , no .",
    "39 ( 6 kpc ) and no .",
    "45 ( 10 kpc ) ; these could possibly be halo stars .",
    "if we would assume the objects to be giants , the photometric distances would increase by approximately a factor of ten , so the only possibility of them being foreground objects would be that they were all white dwarfs .",
    "considering that white dwarfs constitute only a small fraction ( @xmath69 , gliese , 1982 ) of the local stellar luminosity function , we conclude that it is very unlikely that even one could contaminate our sample .",
    "a few sources with @xmath70 are not visible in the v band images ; these could be foreground stars or background galaxies .",
    "in the inner sample all objects have photometric distances in excess of 20 kpc , except no .",
    "44 for which the photometric distance is 14 kpc .",
    "that a low photometric distance does not at all imply that the object really is a foreground star , only that @xmath30 and @xmath24 is consistent with a such .",
    "a few very faint diffuse objects have been found in the images , which probably are background galaxies . to asses the possibility that bright nuclei of distant galaxies have entered our sample of globular cluster candidates we have used the recent result from hubble deep field by williams et al .",
    "the expected number of galaxies brighter than 23.75 magnitudes is @xmath71 within the pc aperture ( also considering the obscuration of the central starburst ) for the f814w images and less in the f555w images . considering that only galaxies with bright point - like nuclei are likely to cause confusion ( also their total magnitude must then be brighter then 23.5 lowering the number even more )",
    ", we conclude that our results are most probably not affected by background galaxies .",
    "this is also supported by counting the galaxies in the adjacent wfc chips .",
    "we see one obvious , fairly bright , galaxy nw of the main body , with the interesting feature that it is only visible in the f814w images .",
    "the discussion of this object will be devoted to a separate investigation .",
    "other possible galaxies are object number 14 and 39 in table 1 .",
    "we could of course be extremely unfortunate , so that eso  338-ig04 was projected onto a very distant ( with a redshift above 1 ) cluster of galaxies lurking just below the detection threshold . in that case",
    "bright elliptical galaxies or bulges could enter the faint part of our sample .",
    "we have measured the spatial extent of all objects in our outer and inner sample and found that they are generally far too small to be galaxies .",
    "if part of the faint end was contaminated from a background cluster there should be a grouping of the faint objects , since these are generally redder , unless eso  338-ig04 was centred on the cluster .",
    "no grouping in colour can be found in the distribution , which indicates that a background cluster of galaxies do not contaminate our sample , as expected .",
    "there are a few objects which appear so red that they are only visible in the f814w image .",
    "these are the best candidates for being background galaxies , since the colours are redder than expected for globular cluster . alternatively , these could be foreground stars",
    ".      in this subsection we deal with the sizes of the gc candidates .",
    "one should bear in mind that even with the pc pixel size , the psf of the telescope is under - sampled .",
    "moreover , we are trying to estimate sizes typically smaller than the pixel size",
    ". therefore these estimates are necessarily uncertain and the fitted size of one single object should not be over - interpreted .      in order to see if the sources are extended or not we have used the following method .",
    "the images were cross - correlated with model psfs and a psf convolved modified power - law 2d cluster profiles ( lugger et al . , 1995 ) .",
    "the model profiles are good approximations to a @xmath72 king model , at a radius @xmath73 14 core radii ( @xmath74 ) .",
    "the method which is applicable to low signal - to - noise data is similar to the the cross - correlation method for surface photometry by phillips and davies ( 1991 ) .",
    "the normalised cross - correlation is maximised when the source and the model have the same light profile .",
    "model psfs were generated with tinytim , including `` jitter '' data for the images .",
    "the flux centra of the convolved model images were aligned to the pixels with the highest fluxes in the source images . in no case",
    "is the cross - correlation maximised for the bare psf .",
    "a typical @xmath74 is 0.5 pixels for the f555w data and 0.3 pixels for the f814w data , which corresponds to 4 and 2.5 pc respectively at the distance of eso  338-ig04 .",
    "the derived @xmath74 for an object in f555w and f814w is the same within 0.2 pixels , in all cases .",
    "the method is sensitive to variations in the background light distribution .",
    "the reason for f555w data giving larger sizes could be due to emission line contamination and larger background noise in this filter .",
    "no reliable results were obtained for sources overlaid on the main body of eso  338-ig04 , i.e. the inner sample .",
    "the method will generally overestimate sizes , since noise will make peaks appear less sharp on average and equal weight is given to all pixels within the fitting window .",
    "a number of tests were performed to check the reliability of this method .",
    "for example we ran the method on stellar images in the field .",
    "as there are no suitable stars in the pc chip this test was done on the wfc fields . for stellar images",
    "the cross - correlations are always maximised for @xmath75 0.0 - 0.1 pixels . in fig .",
    "10 a histogram of the estimated core radii of outer clusters in the f814w filter is shown .",
    "the distribution peaks at 2.5 pc .",
    "the majority of galactic gc s have @xmath76  pc with a peak in the distribution slightly below 1 pc ( harris 1995 ) .",
    "thus our gc candidates have larger radii than the average galactic gc , but fall within the observed distribution .",
    "translating a core radius ( half surface brightness ) to effective radius ( half - light ) , depends sensitively on the adopted @xmath77 value of the king - model used . for small @xmath77 the difference between the effective and core radius is small , while it is large for large values of @xmath77 . for galactic globular clusters",
    "@xmath77 ranges between 0.7 and 2.5 with 1.5 being a typical value .",
    "we have used @xmath72 , since it has an analytic representation at small radii ( lugger et al .",
    "1995 ) convenient for model fitting . since milky way",
    "gcs have a range in @xmath77 values , with @xmath72 being a relatively high value , we can not directly convert our distribution in core radii to a distribution in effective radii . galactic gcs with  @xmath78   have  @xmath79   ( trager et al . 1993 , harris 1996 ) . some authors ( e.g. whitmore et al .",
    "1993 ) have used gaussian profiles for which the core and effective radius are equal ( half width half maximum of the gaussian profile ) .",
    "using a gaussian is equivalent to using a very small value of @xmath77 , and will lead to an overestimate of the core radius if the true @xmath77 value would be larger than one .",
    "we also experimented using gaussian profiles convolved with the psf .",
    "this yielded core radii ( which here equals effective radii ) approximately a factor of two larger than when using @xmath72   king profiles , with a median value of 6 pc . comparing this to the distribution of effective radii for galactic gcs , which peaks at at @xmath02.5 pc and has a median value of 3 pc ( djorgovski 1993 , harris 1996 )",
    ", we find again that our clusters are approximately a factor of two larger .",
    "this also indicates that the choice of of  @xmath77   is not crucial .      to derive the spatial size of cluster candidates ,",
    "many authors have used the magnitude difference in apertures of varying size , i.e. something close to a growth curve ( e.g. whitmore et al .",
    "1993 , schweizer et al .",
    "this gives a measure of the width of the light profile , i.e. the spatial extent . to check for consistency we applied also this method on the candidate gcs .",
    "for all objects we measured @xmath80 , the magnitude difference between two small apertures with radii 0.8 and 3 pixels respectively ; the same estimate was used by schweizer et al .",
    "we measured this quantity for the convolved king profiles , the sole psf and the cluster candidates .",
    "in addition we also measured @xmath80 for psfs convolved with gaussian profiles .",
    "since this method uses information from a smaller area than the cross - correlation method it is less sensitive to background fluctuations . therefore the inner sample objects posed no problem and their spatial extent could be assessed .    for the gc candidates we obtained values of @xmath80 ranging from @xmath81 to @xmath82 , with a median value of @xmath83 for the outer sample and @xmath84 for the inner sample .",
    "thus there is a weak tendency for the inner sample objects to be larger . comparing the distribution of @xmath80 values",
    ", the inner sample has a less peaked distribution .",
    "this may indicate that a few sources in the inner sample are not gcs but more extended associations , but it may also reflect the larger difficulties in measuring the inner sample objects .",
    "projection effects may further cause objects to appear more extended than they are .",
    "the median @xmath80 values correspond to core radii of 0.25 and 0.4 pc pixels respectively .",
    "this is in perfect agreement with the measurements from the cross correlation method for the outer sample . at a distance 37.5",
    "mpc the median core radii estimates correspond to 2.0 and 3.2 pc and the quartile ranges in @xmath85 ( which contain 50 percent of the objects ) are 1.3 - 1.8 and 1.4 - 5.6 pc for the outer and inner sample respectively .",
    "these values are fully consistent with gcs .",
    "when comparing the median @xmath80 values to psfs convolved with gaussian profiles we derive median effective radii ( which for a gaussian profile equals the core radius ) of 0.56 and 0.80 pc pixels for the outer and inner sample respectively .",
    "this correspond to 4.5 and 6.4 pc at the distance 37.5 mpc .",
    "this is very close to the median effective radius of @xmath86 pc found by schweizer et al .",
    "( 1996 ) for gc candidates in the merger remnant ngc  3921 .",
    "our @xmath80 vs. effective radii relation for the f814w filter is almost identical to the one derived by schweizer et al .",
    "( 1996 ) for the f555w filter .",
    "convolving our tiny tim psfs for f555w with gaussians yield a @xmath80 vs. effective radii relation which is offset with 0.1 magnitudes in @xmath80 at a given effective radius , as compared to schweizer et al .",
    "it is possible that schweizer et al .",
    "( 1996 ) actually used psfs for f814w rather than f555w as was claimed , or that there are substantial differences in the tiny tim models and psfs measured in stellar fields . the difference between",
    "our and schweizer et al.s relations are however unimportant since we use the f814w filter .",
    "it is difficult to assess whether the broader distribution of @xmath85 for the inner sample is a consequence of larger intrinsic spatial extent or primarily reflects the general photometric difficulties in the inner sample region . for many sources in the inner sample",
    "the distance ( centre to centre ) to the nearest neighbour is only on the order of five pixels , and in some cases less .",
    "this means that the outer used aperture in the @xmath80 may contain a considerable contribution from neighbouring objects .",
    "the effect of this will an overestimate of the spatial extent of the inner objects with close neighbours , i.e. almost all inner objects .",
    "a conservative estimate can be obtained by removing the most extended sources in the outer sample until the median value and width ( as measured by the standard deviation ) of the inner sample agrees with that of the outer sample . to achieve this 27 percent of the inner sources",
    "must be removed . hence even assuming that crowding does not affect the distribution of core radii",
    ", only a minor fraction of the inner objects would have to be discarded as gc candidates . to further investigate this we measured also @xmath87 for the convolved king profiles and the outer and inner objects .",
    "now the inner sample objects have a more peaked distribution of fitted core radii and the difference between the median @xmath85 of the inner and outer sample decrease .",
    "this indicates that crowding may be the main cause for the larger appearance of the inner objects .",
    "an aperture with radius 1.5 will for some sources still be contaminated with light from a neighbouring source .",
    "in fact both samples get smaller median core radii : 1.75 and 2.7 pc for the outer and inner sample respectively .",
    "that also the outer sample radii decrease indicate that king @xmath72   profiles are not perfect representations for the sources in general .    in the outer sample two sources , object number 32 and 64 ( see table 1 ) , appear as sharp as the psf , i.e. unresolved and therefore suspected stars .",
    "a few more sources : number 39 , 45 and 58 are only marginally resolved , and objects 13 , 18 and 19 are resolved but the uncertainty in the @xmath80 measurement overlaps with the psf .",
    "however objects number 18 , 39 and 58 are clearly resolved using the gc method . in the inner sample ,",
    "object no .",
    "24 appears unresolved .",
    "two objects in the outer sample ( no . 63 and 68 ) and 9 in the inner sample(no .",
    "4 , 9 , 10 , 21 , 22 , 35 , 39 , 51 and 55 ) have @xmath88 , corresponding to @xmath89 pc .",
    "the cross - correlation and @xmath80 methods are found to yield fully consistent results .",
    "the estimated radii of the clusters fall within the distribution observed for galactic gcs .",
    "the inner sample objects are on average more extended , reflecting the greater difficulty assessing their sizes and perhaps that a small part of the inner sample objects are associations rather than young gcs .",
    "however , it should be stressed once more , that we are working with objects which have most of thier light concentrated within one pc pixel .",
    "thus all estimates of their spatial extent will be uncertain , no matter what method is used .",
    "the peak in our distribution of core radii occurs at 2.5 pc , approximately a factor 2 larger than the milky way distribution .",
    "could the larger size be a simple selection effect because the clusters we observe generally are more massive and thus on average larger than galactic ones ?",
    "probably not , since galactic gcs show no clear correlation between radius and luminosity(van den bergh et al .",
    "1991 , harris 1996 ) .      the distribution of absolute magnitudes of the gc candidates is shown in fig .",
    "all objects in table 1 and 2 are brighter than @xmath90 .",
    "comparable luminosities can be reached by super giant ( sg ) stars , i.e. massive stars in their late evolutionary stages .",
    "it is thus important to assess if our sample of gc candidates can be contaminated by luminous sgs in eso  338-ig04 .    to compare our objects with properties of individual stars",
    ", we have used the same evolutionary tracks as in the photometric evolution model , described in sect .",
    "we used the transmission profiles of the used filters convolved with the ccd response curve to calculate the magnitudes of the model stars in the vegamag system .",
    "thereby , we are able to study the location of stars in the @xmath91 space and compare with the location of our gc candidates .",
    "we find that luminosities of corresponding to @xmath90 or greater can only be reached or stars with mass greater than approximately 15 @xmath92 .",
    "however , to match also the observed @xmath30 colour , only stars more massive than 20 @xmath92 can cause confusion .",
    "such stars have life times shorter than about 10 myr .",
    "the current star formation activity is strongly concentrated to the centre of eso  338-ig04 .",
    "if we assume that a star has a typical velocity of @xmath93km / s , it would need more than 10 myr to travel the distance from the centre to the region of the outer sample .",
    "thus it is unlikely that the outer sample will be contaminated with sgs that has emigrated from the centre .",
    "however some star formation appears to be going on , at a slower pace , over an extended region outside the central star burst , why the presence of sgs is still possible . as we showed in the last section ,",
    "the majority of the objects are spatially extended , which makes it unlikely that they are individual stars , unless they have associated nebulosity or reside in clusters ; in the latter case they are of course not single stars at the present resolution . for the inner sample region ,",
    "we expect several sgs to exist , but we will only be able to distinguish them as individual stars if they are well isolated . since star formation tends to be a collective phenomenon , producing not only one star at an instant , we expect star formation to occur in associations and clusters .    by studying the location of the model stars and our observed objects in the @xmath91 space , we identify two areas where our objects overlap with the location of stars .",
    "the first one is for blue super giant ( bsg ) stars with @xmath94 and @xmath95 . only stars more massive than 60 @xmath92 will ever have such properties , and in total four of the objects are found in this region : no .",
    "91 in the outer sample and no .",
    "31 , 42 and 88 in the inner sample .",
    "the other region where sgs and our objects partly overlap is for @xmath96 and @xmath97 . in this region ,",
    "not all sources have measured @xmath49 colours so for these we have less constraints on their nature . for those objects with measured @xmath49 colours only one , no . 2 and to some extent no . 53 in the outer sample ,",
    "have properties consistent with a red / yellow super giant ( rsg ) star .",
    "for those without @xmath49 measured , no firm conclusions can be drawn , but only stars more massive than 20 @xmath92 will ever reach comparable luminosity and @xmath30 colour . speaking against their identification as rsgs rather than gcs",
    "is their location in the outer sample , and that the majority appear spatially resolved .    luminous rsgs origin from stars in the mass range 20 to 40 @xmath92 , and",
    "the duration of the rsg phase is on the order of 10 000 years . from the observed @xmath98 luminosity and a salpeter imf",
    "we expect a star formation rate of approximately one @xmath92 per year in the area covered by the pc field of view . for a salpeter imf ,",
    "a fraction of approximately 0.0005 of the newly formed stars will have a mass in the range required for it to become a rsg .",
    "thus we expect on the order of a dozen luminous rsgs to be present in eso  338-ig04 at each instant . the number of bsg luminous enough to enter the region in the @xmath99 plane where the gc candidates reside can in the same way be estimated to be less than five .",
    "thus we expect several sg stars to exist in eso  338-ig04 , but they are more likely part of the clusters than observable as individual stars , and in any case , their number should be ten times smaller than the number of observed gc candidates .",
    "object no . 2 and 91 in the outer sample and no . 31 , 42 and 88 in the inner sample ,",
    "are the best candidates for being individual sgs based on their colour and luminosity ; however all appear to be spatially extended , and only no .",
    "2 in the outer sample is beter fit by a single sg than with the photometric gc model described in sect .",
    "almost a third of the objects in the outer sample lack measured @xmath49 colour and are from the measured @xmath30 and @xmath61 consistent with the predictions for rsgs .",
    "a few of these , no . 13 , 19 , 32 , 45 and 64 , are in addition unresolved or only marginally resolved ( sect .",
    "4.4.2 ) , making the rsg interpretation possible for these .",
    "we conclude from the analysis above that the overwhelming majority of objects seen around eso  338-ig04 in the pc image must be associated with the galaxy . in general , we have shown that foreground star contamination is improbable and that the photometric distances are inconsistent with foreground stars .",
    "moreover , the vast majority of object have colours and absolute magnitudes that excludes the possibility that they could be super giant stars in the target galaxy .",
    "although sgs should be present , we expect them to be part of clusters and associations rather than isolated objects .",
    "furthermore , isolated giant stars should not appear spatially resolved .",
    "the remaining alternative is then that these are actually star clusters in eso  338-ig04 . since many of them appear to be quite old ( see next section ) and their light distribution is concentrated it is most likely that they actually are globular clusters .",
    "can we single out any probable interlopers ?",
    "in the next section we will see that the photometric evolution models predict @xmath100 for old gcs .",
    "objects which within the 1 sigma uncertainty are redder than this are therefore unlikely to be gcs , unless they have very high metallicity or internal reddening .",
    "this is the case for objects 39 , 45 , 13 , 19 and 63 in the outer sample .",
    "in addition objects 14 and 64 are too red for @xmath30 to be measured . of these , all but no . 14 and 63 , have @xmath80 values whose 1 sigma uncertainties include the psf . in view of this",
    "it is likely that they are foreground stars , while no .",
    "14 and 63 may be background galaxies .",
    "however all but no . 39 and 45 have photometric distances in excess of 10 kpc which cast some doubt on the foreground star interpretation , unless they reside way out in the halo .",
    "an alternative is that some of these could be individual rsgs in eso  338-ig04 after all .",
    "we should also add object no .",
    "32 in the outer sample to the interloper candidates , since it appears unresolved and in addition , very red .",
    "however , not all of these objects have colours that are fully consitent with main sequence stars .",
    "thus the nature of these eight objects remain unclear , although they are not likely to be gcs in eso  338-ig04 . in number",
    "they constitute only five percent of the total number of objects in the outer and inner sample , and affect in no way the conclusions in this paper .",
    "to estimate the ages of the cluster candidates we used a spectral evolutionary synthesis code developed by bergvall .",
    "this is based on evolutionary tracks of stars of metallicity in the range 5% ( mainly ) to 10% solar .",
    "tracks in the mass range 0.08 - 120 @xmath92were obtained from schaller et al .",
    "pre - main sequence tracks were obtained from vandenberg ( 1985 , 1986 ) , iben ( 1965 ) and grossman and graboske ( 1971 ) .",
    "horizontal - branch and agb tracks up to the onset of thermal pulsation were obtained from castellani et al .",
    "equivalent widths of the balmer lines and hei lines in absorption for stars with temperatures above 30000k were obtained from the non - lte stellar atmosphere models of auer and mihalas ( 1972 ) .",
    "line data for cooler stars were obtained from different sources in the literature .",
    "the evolutionary tracks were combined with synthetic stellar spectra obtained from kurucz ( 1992 ) . at the highest effective temperatures",
    "kurucz data were supplemented with data from howarth and lynas - gray ( 1989 ; computed from the kurucz model ) covering a wider range in log g. data for nebular line emission were obtained from ferlands models ( 1993 ) and the continuous emission was calculated from brown and mathews ( 1970 ) and sibille et al .",
    "the metallicity of the gas was assumed to be 10% solar . with this set - up",
    "we were able to make predictions of galaxy spectra as a function of time and initial mass function ( imf ) .",
    "these spectra have been integrated for the hst f336w , f439w , f555w and f814w filters using the transmission curves available at the stsci web - site . as for the photometry , the zero - points for vega were used . to check the accuracy",
    "a spectrum of vega was integrated the same way and yielded zero colours . since we derived the model colours using the transmission profiles of the filters , convolved with the ccd sensitivity , and the photometric zero - points for vega ( hst data handbook ) together with a spectrum of vega , our estimates do not rely on any colour terms .",
    "furthermore , since we use the full filter profiles the results are insensitive to red - leaks of the hst filters .",
    "both the contribution from line- and continuous emission are included in the model and thus , contamination from gaseous emission should not be a problem .",
    "unfortunately , this will not be the case since the emission is , at least partly , spatially decoupled from the ionising source , and found in the form of filaments several tens of pc away .",
    "this may be a problem for the inner sample .",
    "moreover , contrary to e.g. h@xmath101 , the predicted equivalent width of [ oiii]@xmath54 is sensitive to metallicity and to unknown physical parameters like the filling factor of the gas in the nebula .",
    "the models produce predicted fluxes for each time step which are fit to the observed fluxes of the cluster candidates using a least squares method .",
    "the models also , for a given imf , produce mass to luminosity ratios ( @xmath102 ) for the stellar population , including the mass contained in stellar remnants .",
    "these values can be used to estimate the mass of each cluster candidate by simply multiplying the @xmath102 value at the best fitting age with the observed absolute v - band flux , expressed in solar units .",
    "we have assumed a `` top hat '' star formation history in the models .",
    "the star formation rate is constant for @xmath103 myr and zero thereafter .",
    "since we are modelling regions of limited spatial extent such a short time - scale is probably realistic .",
    "our results are not sensitive to the value of @xmath104 as long as it is shorter than the age of the object . in regions where star formation is still going on",
    ", the choice of @xmath104 will affect the modelled ages .",
    "we used the model predictions at the time steps 10 , 20 , 30 , 40 , 50 , 60 , 70 , 80 , 90 , 100 , 200 , 300 , 400 , 500 , 600 , 800 , 1000 , 1500 , 2500 , 3500 , 5000 , 7000 , 9000 and 10800 myr to fit to the observed data .",
    "since the number of observables in the data set is too small to unamibigously discriminate between different imfs we will focus our discussion on results based on the classical salpeter imf ( salpeter 1955 ) and the more realistic miller - scalo imf ( miller - scalo 1982 ) .",
    "the salpeter imf is a single power - law with @xmath105 , the power - law index , where @xmath106 denotes the stellar mass and @xmath107 the number of elements in the interval @xmath108 $ ] . ] .",
    "the miller - scalo imf is characterised by three different power - laws at different mass intervals : @xmath109 for @xmath110 $ ] , @xmath111 @xmath112 $ ] and @xmath113 for @xmath114 $ ] . to illustrate how dependent our results are to the chosen imf",
    ", we have also modelled the objects using a flatter ( @xmath115 ) and a steeper ( @xmath116 ) mass function .",
    "we will sometimes refer to these as the @xmath117 and @xmath118 imfs respectively . in fig .",
    "11 we show the photometric evolution of a model globular cluster from 1 myr to 11 gyr for the four different imfs .",
    "as can be seen , the major difference occurs at low ages .",
    "in particular the steep imf gives considerable redder @xmath30 colours , due to the relatively larger influence of pre - main sequence evolution ( assuming `` naked '' pre - main sequence stars ) .",
    "another major difference is the difference in the mass to luminosity ratio , @xmath102 .",
    "as we will see , only the miller - scalo imf gives a @xmath102 value that agrees with those observed for old galactic gcs .",
    "the assumed metallicity is 5 - 10% ( [ fe / h]@xmath119 - 1.2 ) and 10% of the solar value for the stars and gas , respectively .",
    "the metallicity of the gas was chosen to be close to the observed nebular oxygen abundance of @xmath120 solar in eso  338-ig04 .",
    "the metallicity of the gas is only important at low ages when the ionizing field from young stars give rise to recombination radiation from the gas .",
    "the choice of metallicity for the stellar component is less obvious , since it may vary with the age of the stars . the young , newly formed clusters will have metallicity close to the nebular value , while possible old objects may have a considerably lower metallicity .",
    "it is well known that metallicity has a major impact on the colours of a stellar population , making them redder with increasing metallicity , and therefore it has to be handled with care .",
    "models using a higher metallicity , e.g. solar , generally gives very different results .",
    "observations of elliptical galaxies reveal that several have bimodal colour distributions , which is interpreted as two populations with similar age but different metallicity . in general",
    ", the metal rich gc population has a metallicity close to that of the host galaxy , and a lower peak magnitude in the luminosity function ( forbes et al .",
    "durrell et al .",
    "( 1996 ) studied the globular cluster systems of dwarf ellipticals in the virgo cluster . assuming them to have similar ages as galactic gcs",
    ", they found the mean metallicity of the gc systems in the virgo dwarfs to be [ fe / h]=-1.45 , for a host galaxy luminosity of @xmath121 . subtracting the starburst in eso338-ig04",
    ", the underlying galaxy has a similar absolute luminosity , @xmath122 .",
    "thus , there is no reason to assume that the metallicity of any gc in eso  338-ig04 should be higher than 10 % .",
    "the metallicity of galactic gcs vary between [ fe / h]=-2.5 and @xmath123 , with a clear peak at [ fe / h]=-1.5 , but with no dependence on absolute magnitude ( i.e. mass ) . depending on the age of our objects , we expect the metallicity to lie in the range [ fe / h]=-2 to -1 , and the mean metallicity should be somewhere around [ fe / h]=-1.5 as in dwarf ellipticals ( durrell et al .",
    "1996 ) and the milkyway ( harris 1996 ) .",
    "our used metallicity of [ fe / h]@xmath119 - 1.2 is thus not far from this .",
    "objects that form very early , during the early collapse phase of the protogalaxy may have a very low ( [ fe / h ] @xmath124 ) metallicity while only slightly older objects may be one order of magnitude more metal rich . with this uncertainty in the metallicity of the gc candidates we will have corresponding uncertainties in @xmath30 of less than  @xmath125   magnitudes at a given age ( couture et al .",
    "the uncertainties in @xmath48 and @xmath49 will be comparable .",
    "population synthesis models , e.g. worthey ( 1994 ) predict somewhat less metallicity dependence on the colours at low metallicities . it should be borne in mind",
    ", that part of the structure we find in the age distribution of gc candidates , may be illusive and caused by varying metallicity among the objects .",
    "the colour of any astronomical object will be affected by interstellar extinction .",
    "the reddening caused by our galaxy has been corrected for as discussed above .",
    "any additional internal extinction in eso  338-ig04 will of course affect our results .",
    "the internal extinction in the centre of the galaxy is very small ; bergvall ( 1985 ) finds @xmath126 , iye et al ( 1987 ) @xmath127 and calzetti et al .",
    "( 1995 ) @xmath128 .",
    "it may be a reasonable assumption that this is true also for the cluster candidates , since the metallicity is low and the amount of dust might be small outside the central component of the host galaxy .",
    "some dust will be produced internally in the clusters , due to mass loss from stars in their late evolutionary stages .",
    "however , galactic gcs appears to have very little internal extinction , suggesting that internally produced dust somehow is removed from a cluster ( cf e.g origlia et al .",
    "all the extinction measurements above concerns only the bright starburst which has a high ultraviolet flux .",
    "dust may have been photo - dissociated in this region , while dust outside the main starburst region , i.e. where our outer clusters reside , may have survived .",
    "a further uncertainty concerns the extinction law , which appears to be different in starburst galaxies ( calzetti et al .",
    "on the other hand , the outer clusters are not residing in the starburst itself , whence the average galactic or lmc extinction laws probably are more adequate here .",
    "it is also likely that clusters have different amounts of internal extinction depending on their age and on the physical conditions during their formation .",
    "one possibility to assess the internal extinction is to vary it and determine where the residual from the fitting procedure for each object is minimised .",
    "since the f336w and f439w data have rather low signal - to - noise for most sources , this may be hazardous and the fitted extinctions may finally rather reflect the uncertainties in the data .",
    "a safer way would be to model the cluster candidates with different internal extinctions for the whole sample to see where the average residual has its minimum .",
    "for the salpeter imf the minimum average residual for the whole outer sample was obtained for an extinction of @xmath40 . for the flat ( @xmath115 ) , steep ( @xmath116 ) and miller - scalo imfs the corresponding @xmath129 values were 0.08 , 0.0 and 0.10 respectively .",
    "these number should be viewed critically , since they may reflect intrinsic systematic errors in the models , but the values are reasonable .",
    "moreover we found that adding or subtracting an extinction of this magnitude had a negligible impact on the overall result .",
    "as a compromise , and due to the lack of information , an internal extinction of @xmath126 and the average interstellar extinction law ( the difference between this and the lmc extinction law is small in the optical region ) was assumed for all objects .",
    "this value is reasonable in view of galactic gcs . in fig",
    "12 it can be seen that an internal extinction correction of @xmath130 would bring the data into close agreement with the models , except for the bluest objects .",
    "for the bluest sources the extinction has to be small to make a good fit to the models .",
    "as long as the assumed internal extinction is small , changing it or the extinction law has no significant impact on the modelled properties , and the resulting age and mass distributions are almost identical .      to estimate the ages of the globular cluster candidates we used the observed fluxes , as described above , with an internal extinction correction of @xmath126 . for each time",
    "- step in the model , a least squares fit is made to the observed fluxes . the observed fluxes in each filter are weighted with the inverse of their photometric uncertainty .",
    "this procedure gives a best fitting age for each cluster candidate , where the residual , @xmath131 , defined as the weighted mean square deviation between the model and the data , is minimised .",
    "@xmath132    the symbols @xmath133 and @xmath134 represent the observed and model flux in the band - pass @xmath135 , and @xmath136 is the corresponding weight .    in effect , the f555w and f814w data are generally given higher weights than the f439w and f336w data .",
    "thus , it is not a problem if a particular data point has a low signal - to - noise , since it is given a lower weight in the fitting procedure . as the minimum photometric uncertainty used for weighting in each filter , we assumed @xmath137 as an estimate of the intrinsic photometric errors with wfpc2 which is of that order of magnitude .",
    "for the inner objects where [ oiii]@xmath138 contamination may be a problem , the weights for the f555w data were reduced with a factor of two .",
    "figure 12 shows a @xmath30 versus @xmath49 diagram for objects with good photometry together with the model predictions .",
    "( the motivation for only including objects with accurate photometry is for reasons of clarity ; in fig . 7 all sources are included . )",
    "the outer sample objects are shown as filled circles with thick error - bars whose length correspond to @xmath139 and @xmath140 , the 1-sigma combined errors , @xmath141 in @xmath30 and @xmath49 .",
    "the inner sample objects are shown as open circles with thin error - bars .",
    "the length of the error - bars for the inner sample corresponds to @xmath142 and @xmath143 . the inner sample formal errors have been scaled to make a comparison with outer sample objects more fair ( sect 3.2 ) .",
    "it can be directly seen that objects span a wide range of ages , with inner objects generally being younger .",
    "the agreement between the models and the observed objects is very good .",
    "as discussed above , adding an extinction correction of @xmath144 would make the agreement even better , except for the youngest objects .",
    "although there are a few objects with blue @xmath49 and red @xmath30 colours , close to the prediction of the steep imf , most objects appear to be better fitted by the other imfs .",
    "if there was a bimodality in the imf , this would be very interesting , but it is not possible to claim this from our data , considering the various uncertainties . for the objects with the bluest @xmath30 colours , it appears that only the flat imf model can reproduce them .",
    "this does not necessarily mean that the flat imf is to prefer , since we are now dealing with ages shorter than @xmath104 , and with sources which all have strong emission line contamination , and further the distance to the prediction at the lowest age in the salpeter imf is only a few sigma .",
    "we have seen that the colour of an object will be determined mainly by its age , but that the situation is complicated by varying extinction and metallicity , which can have a non neglible impact on the colours .",
    "below , we will begin with interpreting the colours as caused by age , and in the next subsection discuss how varying extinction and metallicity might modify the results .      for the standard salpeter imf the resulting age distribution for the outer objects",
    "is shown in fig .",
    "we did not include objects 14 and 64 in the modelling since they were not detected in the f555w , f439w or f336w data ( 14 was actually detected in f336w , which suggests that it may be a distant galaxy ) .",
    "we can identify what appears to be at least four different epochs in the cluster formation history .",
    "there is a group of young clusters with ages from @xmath14510 to 100 myr , an intermediate age 200 - 700 myr group , an older 1 - 7 gyr group with a peak at 2.5 and 5 gyr and finally an  @xmath011 gyr old group .",
    "thus there are indications of populations of young as well as old globular clusters present in this galaxy .",
    "varying the imf does not affect the general pattern in the age distribution .",
    "although the ages of the objects shift slightly ant the relative strength of the peaks change slightly , they remain at the same locations .",
    "all imfs produce the same median age of 2.5 gyr .",
    "the histogram of modelled masses are shown in fig .",
    "14 for the salpeter imf .",
    "it can be seen that the clusters are very massive , with a peak in the distribution around @xmath146 @xmath92 .",
    "even the objects with the lowest modelled mass , @xmath147 @xmath92 , are massive enough to be globular clusters . however , the modelled mass of a gc is quite sensitive to the assumed imf due to the varying @xmath102 value ( fig .",
    "the median mass of the clusters is @xmath148 for the salpeter imf , @xmath149 for the miller - scalo imf , @xmath150 for the steep imf and @xmath151 for the flat imf . at an age of 11 gyr , typical for old galactic gcs",
    "according to recent estimates ( e.g. chaboyer et al .",
    "1998 ) , the different imfs predict the following @xmath102 values : 5.7 for the salpeter , 3.5 for the miller - scalo , 11 for the steep , and 44 for the flat imf ; all expressed in solar units .",
    "the @xmath102 values for well studied old galactic gcs range between 1.8 and 3.6 ( meylan and pryor 1993 ) .",
    "thus only the miller - scalo imf can reproduce the observed @xmath102 values .",
    "the flat and steep imfs are both clearly ruled out , while the salpeter imf is at the limit .    as can be seen in fig .",
    "15 there is a correlation between the mass and age such that old clusters on average are more massive . since the luminosity of for a given mass decrease with time , i.e. the @xmath102 value increases , we do not expect to find any old low mass clusters .",
    "plotted in fig .",
    "15 is the photometric mass of a cluster with @xmath152 at a function of age .",
    "this is our expected low mass cut - off and agrees well with the observed distribution .",
    "considering that , including the objects falling below the detection threshold , we expect the number of old clusters to be larger than the number of young ones ( table 4 ) .",
    "therefore we expect to find more massive clusters among the older ones .",
    "this also means that the apparent situation in fig .",
    "14 , that the total number of clusters is dominated by young objects , most likely is not real ( cf sect .",
    "6.1 and 6.6 ) .    in fig 14",
    "we also show the luminosity function of all objects in the outer sample , transformed to an age of 9 gyr using the salpeter model , comparable to ages of galactic gcs ( chaboyer et al .",
    "the luminous part of the distribution have a shape not too far from gaussian , with a peak at @xmath153 .",
    "the shape is similar to the luminosity function of galactic globular clusters but the peak luminosity is @xmath0 1 magnitude brighter for our objects , due to incompleteness . the estimated absolute magnitude at an age of 9 gyr is also sensitive to the imf as seen in table 4 .      for the inner objects",
    ", it can be seen from their colours , in figs .",
    "6,7,11 and 12 , that all but a few have ages less than 100 myr . in fig .",
    "14 we show the resulting age and mass distribution for the inner sample , and also @xmath61 transformed to an age of 9 gyr .",
    "masses range from @xmath154 @xmath92 to @xmath155 @xmath92 assuming a salpeter imf .",
    "the transformed luminosity function does not have the nice shape of the outer sample .",
    "the inner sample is incomplete and in addition many sources may be double or multiple clusters , and further photometric errors can not be neglected .",
    "this may explain the irregular shape of the luminosity function at 9 gyr .",
    "further this transformation only includes photometric evolution , not dynamic .",
    "approximately 40 percent of the inner sample objects are fitted with an age @xmath156 myr .",
    "this subset may be contaminated by associations but most objects are expected to be young gcs since they have small radii and large masses .",
    "the older objects in the inner sample , are probably outer sample objects projected on the centre of the galaxy .",
    "the division between an outer and inner sample was made on practical grounds , not physical . in studying the statistical properties of the sources",
    "it is more interesting to combine the two sub - samples into a @xmath157 sample .",
    "table 4 presents median modelled properties for the whole sample as a function of age of the clusters , for the salpeter and miller - scalo imfs . except for the youngest objects , where the two imfs give almost equal @xmath102 values , the salpeter imf produce about twice as massive clusters .",
    "we noted in the previous section that only the miller - scalo imf gives @xmath102 values in accordance with observed gcs .",
    "therefore the flat and steep imfs are not included , since they give unrealistic @xmath102 values for old clusters .",
    "table 4 also presents @xmath158 , the median of @xmath61 transformed to an age of 9 gyr including only photometric evolution . in general the values predicted by the two used imfs",
    "are within a few tenths of a magnitude , with the largest difference again at low age .",
    "the quantity @xmath159 is the number of sources with @xmath160 , which is of relevance for assessing the richness of the gc population ; and @xmath161 is the total number of objects in the age interval in question .",
    "if there is a possible contamination of at most five foreground / background sources , @xmath161 should be lowered by this number but not @xmath159 since the possible interlopers are all faint .",
    "the median mass in each age interval is consistent with gcs .",
    "the youngest objects have a lower median mass reflecting the age dependent mass detection limit , see fig 15 .      in the following section we will critically examine the resulting age distribution obtained in sect .",
    "we discuss how reliable our results are considering photometric , metallicity , extinction and model uncertainties .      to estimate uncertainties we made the objects bluer and redder with the observed one sigma uncertainties .",
    "this had a minor effect on the shape of the age histogram . when adding the errors in the blue and red direction the median age was shifted down to 1500 myr and up to 3500 myr respectively .",
    "thus the age pattern in fig .",
    "14 is very robust to changes in the imf and to internal errors .",
    "not included in the modelling , nor in table 1 , are objects with @xmath162 , many of which are only detected in the f814w filter .",
    "these may partly be foreground stars , but some of them may be old low luminosity globular clusters .    the age distribution of the clusters in the outer and inner sample seen in fig .",
    "14 reveals that objects are found in most age bins .",
    "this could mean that clusters have formed at a more or less steady rate since more than 10 gyr back in time , and that at some occasions , e.g. at the present , the cluster formation rate have been heavily enhanced .",
    "however , it is likely that the true age distribution is different from the modelled one due to observational uncertainties , and uncertainties in the models .",
    "even if the true distribution is sharply peaked at different ages , the modelled distribution is likely to be smoother , since the corresponding peaks in the colour distributions would be smeared by observational errors .",
    "one specific suspicion was that the 11 gyr peak was not real , but created by 2.5 and 5 gyr objects which due to observational errors in the red direction piled up at the reddest model age , i.e. at 11 gyr .    to test this possibility",
    "we simulated the age distribution in the following way : we assumed an input age distribution with two to five sharp peaks , and the observed distribution of @xmath25 .",
    "the colours of the objects of a specific age are given by the model .",
    "errors are now added stochastically according to the observed @xmath163 relation ( fig .",
    "these simulated objects are modelled with the photometric evolution model to check if the age distribution of the observed objects can be reproduced . in this way we can determine which peaks are significant . to reproduce the data we need to have peaks in the age distribution at 10 myr , 30 myr , @xmath0100 myr , @xmath0600 myr , 2.5 gyr , 5 gyr and @xmath011 gyr .",
    "the peak at 100 myr is only marginally significant .",
    "the 2.5 and 5 gyr peaks could possibly be replaced by a more extended gc formation epoch lasting a few gyr , but not with a single peak of intermediate age .",
    "out of the seven suspected foreground / background objects ( sect .",
    "4.5 ) , five were best fitted with an age of 11 gyr .",
    "the total number of objects with this fitted age is 14 .",
    "thus up to one third of these could be actually foreground / background objects rather than old gcs in eso  338-ig04 .",
    "the 11 gyr peak could only partly be reproduced by assuming a 5 gyr peak broadened by observational errors , even when allowing for one third of them to be foreground / background objects .",
    "thus even if the number of very old gcs are less than the model - fitting indicates , objects with this age are required to explain the observed colour distribution .",
    "thus , in addition to the present active gc formation event , we are left with three prominent gc formation epochs in the past : 0.5 , 2.5 - 5 and @xmath14511 gyr ago .",
    "however , the 11 gyr peak may in reality be less peaked and extending to higher ages .      above we found that the observed distribution of colours could be understood by a wide range of cluster ages with several peaks in the age distribution .",
    "the observed range in @xmath30 and @xmath49 is about two magnitudes , which is far more than expected from variations in the metallicity and extinction alone .",
    "thus we need this wide range of ages to explain the data . however , we can not rule out that some smaller variations in the colour distribution are caused by varying extinction or metallicity .",
    "it is difficult to disentangle effects of metallicity and extinction , since their impact in a colour - colour diagram like fig .",
    "12 is very similar .",
    "could , for example , the apparent age structure seen among objects older than 1 gyr ( fig .",
    "14 ) be caused by varying extinction in objects of a uniform age of , say , @xmath164   gyr ? to reproduce the colour distribution we then need to add an additional extinction of more than 0.3 magnitudes in @xmath129 for those objects that first were fitted with an age of 11 gyr .",
    "the average extinction needed for these objects would be @xmath165 , and @xmath166 for the 5gyr objects .",
    "this is far more than expected , since there are no signs of any appreciable extinction in this galaxy .",
    "thus , it is unlikely that the range of ages ( 2 to 11 gyr ) inferrred for the oldest objects is an illusion caused by varying extinction .",
    "for the 2.5 vs the 5 gyrs peak , this can not be ruled out , but the required extinction is still higher than expected .",
    "we saw in section 5.3 that metallicity variations could cause colour variations up to 0.2 magnitudes in @xmath49 and @xmath30 .",
    "one could expect that the metallicity of the objects correlate with their age , with the oldest clusters beeing the most metal poor .",
    "this would make them bluer , and create an illusive youth .",
    "so if there is a simple relation between age and metallicity among the gc candidates this would rather hide age variations than create illusionary such .",
    "of course the situation may be more complicated than a simple age metallicity relation , e.g. if gc formation was triggred by merging with a gaseous component with a different metallicity than that of the host galaxy .",
    "the colour variations among objects with fitted ages above 1 gyr is still too large to be explained by metallicity variations alone , unless the apparently oldest objects are very metal rich ( almost solar ) , which we showed in sect . 5.3 was unrealistic .",
    "thus we are left with a real age structure that would require an opposite age - metallicity relationship and in addition appreciable extinction to be avoided .",
    "however , it is less certain wether the two connected age peaks at 2.5 and 5 gyr are real .",
    "the difference in the median @xmath30 value of the two sub populations is less than 0.1 magnitudes ( the difference in @xmath49 is larger ) , which could be explained by metallicity variations of the order of 1 dex",
    ". a smaller metallicity difference could be sufficient if the more metal rich clusters in addition had higher internal extinction .",
    "the conclusions are that fine structures ( at the 50 % level ) in the age distributions could equally well be caused by a metallicity bimodality as by real age differences , but that the overall age structure remains intact , i.e the peaks at @xmath167 myr , @xmath0 600 myr , 2.5 to 5 gyr and @xmath168 gyr remain . due to the unknown metallicity and extinction , the absolute values of the ages are uncertain at approximately the 50% level .",
    "note that the main effect of metallicity and extinction is to change the colours , and thus the interpreted age , of an object .",
    "the estimated masses and luminosity evolution of the objects will not be importantly affected .",
    "15 shows a plot of the residual of a fit for the salpeter imf versus the weighted mean error for each object in the outer sample .",
    "the weighted mean error , @xmath169 , is the for each object mean of all the photometric uncertainties weighted with their own inverse , i.e. the signal to noise :    @xmath170    this is the relevant quantity to compare with the residual of the fit , eq .",
    "( 1 ) , since it weights the different passbands in the same manner . on average",
    ", we do not expect objects to have smaller residuals than their weighted mean error .",
    "most objects should however have their residual within a few @xmath169 .",
    "fig . 15 verifies",
    "that this is the case . for objects with small @xmath169 , this will underestimate the errors since inherent photometric uncertainties in wfpc2 will enter .",
    "it is important to remember that all the given errors in the plots and tables are formal photometric errors , and are therefore lower limits to the true photometric errors , which may be affected by object centring errors , crowding background subtraction errors , contamination from gaseous emission , inherent photometric uncertainty in the wfpc2 system and possible systematic errors .",
    "in particular the former can be a problem for the inner sample .",
    "in addition , we have metallicity and extinction and model uncertainties .",
    "overall , there is no correlation between the fitted age and the residual , except that the lowest ( @xmath171myr ) and highest(@xmath172gyr ) age bins have on average slightly higher residuals .",
    "this is demonstrated in fig . 13 .",
    "this is expected since abnormally blue and red objects will always be fitted with one of these ages although the fit is not particularly good . these objects , where the fit is much worse than expected from the photometric errors are suspect .",
    "perhaps some could after all be distant galactic nuclei or halo stars ?",
    "in general though , the residuals are well within a few @xmath169 . for the outer sample and the salpeter imf , 65  % of the objects have fits better than @xmath173 .",
    "only five objects have @xmath174 , two which have fitted ages of 10 myr , one 50 myr and two 11 gyr . for the inner sample and the other imfs",
    "the numbers are almost identical .",
    "each object has been fitted to one of the time - steps in the model .",
    "however , the best fit might have been obtained for an age intermediate between two time - steps . for this reason ,",
    "objects that apparently coincide with the model prediction e.g. in fig .",
    "12 . , may still have a residual larger than the weighted mean error .",
    "we conclude that the residuals from the fit are reasonable as compared to the observational uncertainties , and in general the fits are as good as can be expected .",
    "although an object will always have a best fitting age , this tell us nothing about the significance of this result .",
    "if the signal to noise is sufficiently low , any age would be consistent with the observed properties , and the fitted age is more or less random .",
    "furthermore , if the residual is only a weak function of the age , these can not be said to be very significant since several ages are possible within the observational errors .",
    "fortunately , this is generally not the case : most objects have well defined minima in their age versus residual curve . in fig .",
    "16 , the residual for different ages is shown for object 40 in the outer sample , for the four different imfs used .",
    "for this particular object , a miller - scalo imf gives the best fit .",
    "the weighted mean error for this object is , @xmath175 .",
    "it can be seen that for each imf only a narrow range of ages gives residuals comparable to this .",
    "most objects have residual - age curves very similar to this with well defined minima .",
    "another important aspect is how accurate the models are .",
    "error sources will come from errors in the input stellar evolution models , stellar atmospheres and from interpolation problems where tracks are sparse or different tracks are patched together . while the latter kind of errors can be controlled , the accuracy of stellar evolution theories are difficult to assess .",
    "charlot ( 1996 ) made a comparison of different spectral evolutionary synthesis model and concluded that they may differ appreciably .",
    "furthermore , model spectra generated using the tracks from the geneva group ( the ones used here , schaller et al .",
    "1992 ) and the padova group differed in predicted colours , e.g. @xmath176 , up to several tenths of a magnitude at certain ages .",
    "therefore , it is very likely that the uncertainties of the model predictions arising from uncertainties in theories of stellar evolution is at least 0.1 magnitudes in colour indices .",
    "our models include agb stars only to the onset of thermal pulsations .",
    "later stages are very short and not including them will give errors less than 0.05 magnitudes in bolometric flux , and considerable less in the colours ( charlot & bruzual 1991 ) .",
    "further problems are caused by internal extinction , metallicity and uncertainties in the value and uniqueness of the imf , as discussed above .",
    "internal extinction is likely not to be constant , but to vary from cluster to cluster , and the same might be the case for the metallicity .",
    "a further uncertainty enters for the youngest objects ; here colours are uncertain since the time - scale for star formation , @xmath104 , is comparable to the modelled ages of the objects . in general @xmath104 is not well known .",
    "the imf is a statistical property and for small numbers , e.g. of very massive stars , there will be deviations from the `` true '' imf .",
    "since massive stars are very luminous this means that stochastic changes in the mass distributions among the most massive stars can have a noticeable impact on the colours of a young star forming region .",
    "since all our objects are fairly massive , any such fluctuations will be unimportant shortly after the star formation has ceased after 10 myr .",
    "another effect arises because the model colours and luminosities are smoothed over the width of the time - step . for low ages , rapid evolutionary stages of individual stars will affect a young stellar population . in effect , the ages and masses of clusters with fitted ages 10 myr and younger have more uncertain ages and masses , than those older than 10 myr .",
    "some objects will be redder than expected and fitted with a slightly higher age , e.g. 20 myr , while the too blue objects will still be fit with 10 myr . at this stage",
    "we will not discuss the details of the age distribution within the young objects but are primarily interested in concluding their youth and estimate their masses .",
    "the four imfs all give comparably good fits on average .",
    "the steep imf gives generally slightly worse fit than the other imfs , especially for young objects .",
    "the three other imfs give very similar quality of fit , except at low ages where the flat imf gives better fits .",
    "this is due to the presence of some very blue objects as discussed above , and can not be interpreted as clear - cut support for the flat imf .",
    "the strongest support for any individual imf is the fact that only the miller - scalo function gives reasonable mass luminosity ratios at high ages .",
    "there appears be a deficiency of blue luminosity at low ages for the miller - scalo imf , indicating that the slope at high masses could be flatter than @xmath177 .",
    "a miller - scalo imf with a slope @xmath178 at high masses , would be @xmath179 magnitudes bluer in @xmath30 at ages of a few myr , and still give a reasonable @xmath180 value at 10 gyr .",
    "we also tried by `` hiding '' the pre - main sequence stages in circum - stellar dust , with the result that the model @xmath30 colours get slightly ( @xmath181 magnitudes ) bluer at ages less than 10 myr .",
    "thus with a few modifications the miller - scalo imf can be made compatible with the bluest observed @xmath30 colours .",
    "however , it can not be excluded the problem with the colours at low ages is related to general uncertainties in the theories of massive star evolution , and to the observational uncertainties . in view of all these uncertainties , the fits of the objects to the models is as good as can be expected . the main conclusions , that in addition to the present one , there have several previous epochs of massive cluster formation , seem very robust .",
    "the fit of the observed fluxes of the gc candidates was made using a constant metallicity ( 5 - 10 % of solar ) and internal extinction ( @xmath126 ) .",
    "the result is that the objects span a wide range of ages , from a few myr to more than 10 gyr .",
    "in addition there were several peaks i the age distribution ( cf fig .",
    "14 ) , which were located at @xmath182   myr , 100 myr , 600 myr , 2.5 gyr , 5 gyr and 11 gyr .",
    "the majority of these must be real and can not be explained as caused by observational or model uncertainties .",
    "however , we can not exclude the existance of metallicity and extinction variations among the objects . within reasonable limits on the metallicity and extinction variations",
    ", these can distort the modelled ages at the 50 % level .",
    "thus we can not say with confidence that the 2.5 and 5 gyr peaks are real as a metallicity bimodality is also possible .",
    "however , we can say that there must be a rich subpopulation of objects with age in the range 2 to 5 gyr .",
    "in addition we can say with confidence that there are objects with age @xmath182   myr , @xmath183 gyr and probably also @xmath4 and @xmath184myr .",
    "we note that , if metallicity increases with age , the main effect of a metallicity variation will be to hide the real age differences present , rather than create illusionary age differences .",
    "the modelled masses are mainly sensitive to the adopted imf . the age and mass distributions",
    "are shown in fig .",
    "14 and table 4 .",

    "since eso  338-ig04 is a galaxy with rather low mass it is probably also a more favourable place for globular clusters to survive disruption      the results from the age modelling are robust to changes in imf and photometric errors as was shown in sect 5 . since the galaxy and an old globular clusters population was formed @xmath010 gyr ago , this galaxy has experienced additional major gc formation events .",
    "the last one is apparently still going on .",
    "major formation events appear to have occurred 0.1 , 0.6 , 2.5 and 5 gyr ago .",
    "the strongest peak is found at  @xmath218  gyr with 20 detected gcs .",
    "it is possible that there was a more or less continuos gc production during the epoch 2.5 to 5 gyrs ago rather than separate peaks , or that the two peaks rather reflects a metallicity bimodality among these objects .",
    "either altermative is interesting , since a possible metallicity bimodality among objects of similar age , signifies different formation histories . in general , including also uncertainties in metallicity and internal extinction we expect the absolute ages to be accurate to within 50 % . at present",
    ", we can only say that there are gc populations present with an ages  @xmath167  myr ,  @xmath219  myr ,  @xmath220  myr ,  @xmath221   gyr and  @xmath222   gyr ( the quoted uncertainties correspond to the maximun expected deviation ) .",
    "table 4 lists the number of objects in different age intervalls . however , as we have seen , the mass detection limit is age dependent . to estimate the total number of gcs in each age intervall ( including objects below the detection limit ) we use the number of objects with @xmath212 ( which should comprise 16 % of the total number of gcs at each age on the simplified assumption of a universal and gaussian lf for gcs , cf sect . 6.6 ) .",
    "then we see that slightly more than half the total number of gcs belong to the 2.5 - 5 gyr population .",
    "about one fifth of the gcs are older than 5 gyr , and one fourth younger than 1 gyr .",
    "thus the apparent situation in fig .",
    "14 , that very young objects dominate the total number of gcs , is not real , but created by the age dependent mass detection limit .",
    "however , over the last 1 gyr , the total number of gcs formed is comparable to the any of the 2.5 or 5 gyr peaks .",
    "we do not know how extended in time these events were .",
    "thus averaged over 1 gyr , the 2.5 to 5 gyr cluster formation episode(s ) can not be said with confidence to have been much stronger than the present one .",
    "the peaks at 2.5 and 5 gyr ago corresponds to redshifts of @xmath223 and @xmath224 respectively for the used value of @xmath225 , only weakly dependent on the value of @xmath226 .",
    "some investigations suggest that the `` faint blue galaxies '' phenomenon , i.e. the excess in the deep blue galaxy counts , have its origin in star bursting dwarfs at these redshifts ( see e.g. ellis 1997 for a review ) .",
    "we have found about five `` real '' peaks in the age distribution .",
    "a gc formation event must be associated with a star burst , as is the case presently .",
    "thus this galaxy should have experienced about five bursts of star formation in its lifetime .",
    "thus age dating of gc formation events is an efficient way of studying the violent star formation history in this , and similar , galaxies .",
    "the estimated masses of our gc candidates are similar to those of galactic gcs . in table 4",
    "the median masses of the gc candidates are tabulated for different age intervals .",
    "the estimated mass is quite sensitive to the adopted imf .",
    "at least for old clusters , the miller - scalo imf should give realistic mass estimates since it reproduces the observed mass luminosity ratio of galactic gcs ( cf .",
    "sect 5.4.1 ) .",
    "since there is no evidence that the imf is different for gcs in eso  338-ig04 and the milky way , the miller - scalo imf is the natural choice .",
    "the uncertainty in metallicity of the objects have no significant effect on the estimated masses , as compared to the other uncertainties .",
    "the photometric mass correlates with the fitted age in such a way that older clusters on average are more massive ( table 4 , fig .",
    "this is a simple consequence of luminosity evolution combined with a larger number of old clusters compared to young ones . since",
    "a gc becomes fainter with time we will be able to detect clusters with lower mass for young ages than for old .",
    "moreover , if the total number of old globular clusters is larger than the number of young ones , we expect the most massive old clusters to be heavier than the most massive young clusters .",
    "the highest mass is estimated for object no .",
    "34 ( table 1 ) in the outer sample , which has a photometric mass of @xmath227 and an age of 2.5 gyr for the both the salpeter and miller - scalo imf .",
    "the other two imfs give the same age and an even higher modelled mass .",
    "thus , irrespective of the uncertainties in the imf , it appears to be a very massive globular cluster .",
    "several almost as massive objects are found in both the inner and outer sample .      in sect .",
    "5 it was shown that there is strong support for the miller - scalo imf , since it best reproduced the @xmath180 values of old galactic gcs .",
    "the flat and steep imfs are ruled out by producing @xmath180 ratios an order of magnitude too large . on the other hand ,",
    "the miller - scalo imf have problems reproducing the @xmath30 colours of the bluest objects .",
    "does this suggest that the imf has changed or that we should take the salpeter imf which provides a fair compromise in these two respects ?",
    "there is no a priori reasons to assume that the imf should change with time .",
    "there have been claims of imf deficient in low mass stars in some starburst galaxies , but the results are inconclusive .",
    "old gcs must be fossil starburst clusters , due to their small physical size .",
    "recent hst results give support for a miller - scalo like mass function in the low mass region from direct star counts in old galactic gcs ( e.g. de marchi and paresce , 1997 ) .",
    "there seems to be no reason why the imf should be different in the present starburst clusters than the previous ones .",
    "one alternative is however that the imf is invariant but that the mass function evolves with time due to dynamical effects .",
    "once formed , a globular cluster continuously evolves .",
    "stars , mainly of low mass , are evaporated due to stellar collisions . in effect , the mass function is modified , not only by the death of massive stars , but also the low mass region is affected through dynamical processes . when supernovae explode , debris is ejected with high velocity and some material will leave the cluster .",
    "also , the kinetic energy received by the remnant will give this a higher than average probability of escape .",
    "thus , we expect a globular cluster to continuously decrease in mass , and the stellar mass function may change in shape .",
    "this means that the imf may be of salpeter shape , while subsequent dynamical evolution may bring the low mass region of the mass function into close resemblance with the miller - scalo imf .",
    "with such an evolution of the stellar mass function in gcs , both the bluest colours and the @xmath180 ratios can be reproduced .",
    "the specific frequency of globular clusters @xmath228 , is a measure of the relative richness of globular clusters of a galaxy .",
    "it is defined as @xmath229  ( van den bergh , 1985 ) , where @xmath68 is the absolute magnitude of the host galaxy ( for eso  338-ig04  @xmath230 ) . in general",
    ", @xmath228 is a strong function of galaxy type with ellipticals having the highest specific frequencies , @xmath231 while irregulars and late type spirals have @xmath232 ( harris , 1991 ; van den bergh , 1995 ) .",
    "this is a classical objection against the scenario that the majority of elliptical galaxies formed by merging late type galaxies .",
    "we have detected more than 120 globular cluster candidates , and even more are expected to hide beyond the detection limit .",
    "if we assume that all the 120 objects we are discussing in this paper are globular clusters we get @xmath233 .",
    "a lower conservative boundary on @xmath228 can be derived using only the objects in the inner and outer sample with age @xmath234myr , which totals 65 .",
    "if these were anything but gcs , they should have dissolved by now .",
    "as was discussed is sect .",
    "4.5 the expected number of interlopers , i.e. foreground stars and background galaxies , still contaminating our sample is expected to be six or less .",
    "subtracting five from the number of old detected gcs we are left with 60 .",
    "this gives a lower limit of @xmath235 .",
    "a more fair estimate of the richness of a globular cluster population is obtained by calculating the @xmath236-value ( zepf & ashman 1993 ) which relates the number of clusters to the mass of the host galaxy by also taking its @xmath237 into account .",
    "beeing involved in a starburst , eso  338-ig04 undoubtly has a low @xmath237 value , so by adopting @xmath238 as suggested by zepf & ashman ( 1993 ) for irregulars we will definetely not overestimate the @xmath236-value , but rather get a lower bound . for a total number of 120 gcs we then obtain @xmath239 which is very high even for giant elliptical standards .",
    "counting only gcs older than 1 gyr ( which should have orbits favourable for non destruction ) we still get 45 gcs and @xmath240 , see table 5 .",
    "this is without any correction for objects below the detection limit .",
    "thus , for beeing a late type galaxy , eso  338-ig04 appears to be very rich in gcs .    to estimate how many sources that may fall beyond the detection limit we assumed a gaussian luminosity function with a peak at @xmath241 and a one sigma width of the peak of @xmath206 magnitudes , which is a compromise between values for the milky way ( gnedin 1997 , harris 1991 ) dwarfs ( durrell 1996 ) and nearby galaxies ( harris 1991 ) . for a gaussian ( normal )",
    "distribution only 16% of the objects should have luminosities brighter than @xmath242 .",
    "thus we can use @xmath187 to estimate the total number of gcs , including those behind the detection limit . from table 4",
    "we see that in total 33 objects have @xmath212 .",
    "thus we expect the total number of globular clusters to be @xmath243 , i.e. only @xmath244 of the gcs in eso  338-ig04 have been detected . comparing the number of objects with @xmath212 with the total number of objects in each age interval in table 4",
    ", it is clear that all the undetected gcs are expected to be older than 50 myr , and the majority ( almost 90 % ) older than 1 gyr . if some young objects will not make their way to become old gcs it has little effect on the total expected number of globular clusters , since almost all the objects brighter than @xmath153 are older than 50 myr , and the majority ( 75 % ) older than 1 gyr .",
    "thus the total number of clusters is expected to be almost 200 anyway .",
    "the number of undetected clusters depends on the assumed peak luminosity , the dispersion @xmath245 , and of course on errors in the adopted distance and the transformation of the luminosities to 9 gyr .",
    "if , for example , @xmath246 would be 65 rather than the assumed value of 75 km  s@xmath10mpc@xmath10 , our globular clusters would become 0.3 magnitudes brighter and the total number of expected clusters would grow to more than 250 .",
    "however , the host galaxy would become correspondingly brighter , almost cancelling the effect . with these uncertainties in mind",
    "we conclude that the total number of clusters is @xmath247 , and arrive at @xmath248 .",
    "this is a typical value for elliptical galaxies ( harris 1991 ) .",
    "the corresponding @xmath236-value corrected for undetected gcs would however be very high ( @xmath249 ) .",
    "even if counting only the expected number of old ( @xmath250   gyr ) gcs we get  @xmath251 .",
    "since the host galaxy is involved in an active luminous starburst it is in a transient state where it is over - luminous as compared to galaxies with similar mass and size . in a hubble time",
    "a starburst will fade 4 - 5 magnitudes ( section 5 ) , and about 3 magnitudes in 1 gyr ( fig .",
    "11 ) . however , since there is an underlying intermediate age component with lower luminosity and larger extent than the starburst , the fading of the galaxy as a whole would only be approximately 1.5 magnitudes in 1 gyr as the starburst ceases .",
    "thus , if the number of clusters is preserved the specific frequency would rise with a factor of @xmath04 in one gyr . during this period",
    "many young gcs maight be disrupted , but not enough to cancel the effect .",
    "hence , in one gyr , this galaxy will become very rich in gcs ; even if only the detected old ( @xmath252 gyr ) objects are counted @xmath253 . including the expected number of old ( @xmath252 gyr ) objects behind the detection limit we expect 150 objects and @xmath254 .",
    "taking also young ( @xmath255   gyr ) objects into account and assuming that they survive we expect 200 gcs which yields @xmath256 .",
    "thus irrespective of the uncertainties in the total number of clusters , when the present starburst terminates eso  338-ig04 will become very rich in globular clusters within 1 gyr .",
    "values of @xmath257 are only found in e and cd galaxies .",
    "it is interesting to note that cd galaxies also are believed to have a multiple merger history .",
    "we conclude that even conservative estimates on  @xmath228   and  @xmath236   yields very high values of the richness of the gc system in eso  338-ig04 . in table 5",
    "we present @xmath228 values for different cases described in this section .",
    "lllll   & @xmath258 & @xmath228-now & @xmath228 - 1gyr & @xmath236 + gcs @xmath205 myr , detected & @xmath259 60 & @xmath119 1 & @xmath119 5 & @xmath260 + gcs @xmath261 gyr , detected & @xmath119 45 & @xmath119 1 & @xmath119 3 & @xmath262 + gcs @xmath200 myr , detected & 57 + gcs total , detected & @xmath119 120 & @xmath119 2 & @xmath119 9 & @xmath168 + gcs @xmath261 gyr , expected & @xmath119 150 & @xmath119 3 & @xmath119 11 & @xmath263 + gcs total , expected & @xmath119 200 & @xmath119 4 & @xmath119 15 & @xmath264 +      the final question is :  why has this galaxy , at different epochs , been forming and probably still is forming , globular clusters in large numbers ?",
    "the best guess at hand would be that this cluster formation is connected to an ongoing merger .",
    "this is supported by the velocity field ( stlin et al .",
    ". an alternative explanation may be interaction with the 70 kpc distant confirmed companion galaxy .",
    "this galaxy is about 2 magnitudes fainter and also show signs of active star formation",
    ". it would be interesting to know if it possesses the same kind of clusters as eso  338-ig04 .",
    "the formation of globular clusters requires a substantial mass of gas to be transformed into stars in a very limited region of space .",
    "the process of gc formation therefore requires both high gas densities and pressures , and high overall gas masses ( elmegreen and efremov 1997 ) .",
    "in addition , the timescale for bulding up the required gas masses and densities , must be shorter than the timescale for destruction of molecular clouds .",
    "these conditions are fulfilled in mergers involving a late type galaxy .",
    "it is not certain at all , if a mere tidal interaction can trigger enough gas flows to create the necessary conditions .",
    "the velocity dispersion in the ionised gas in eso  338-ig04 is high , @xmath265 km / s ( stlin et al",
    ". 1997a , iye et al . 1987 ) , indicating a high pressure and favourable conditions for gc formation .",
    "it seems like objects similar to our young ones can form also in large ( kiloparsec scale ) cirumnuclear rings in giant spirals ( barth et al .",
    "the cluster formation in such environments is probably triggered by dynamical resonances enhancing the local gas density .",
    "such mechanisms are lacking in dwarf galaxies , why mergers may be the only efficient way of gc formation .",
    "once formed a gcs have better chances of surviving in a dwarf galaxy since the destruction mechanisms ( tidal shocking , disk shocking , bulge shocking etc ) are less efficient or absent in dwarfs .",
    "the age distribution of the clusters indicates several different formation epochs have taken place , suggesting that the galaxy has been involved in a merger or strong interaction more than once since it and the original clusters were formed .",
    "the presently ongoing merger has distorted the velocity field enough that it is impossible to derive information on any previous merger .",
    "earlier cluster formation epochs could possibly also be connected to a previous very close encounter between the galaxies that now are merging .",
    "if we accept the merger scenario we then ask what kind of galaxies have been involved ?",
    "a quite substantial population of old clusters suggest that one of the initial galaxies was an elliptical ( dwarf ) galaxy , while the existing large amounts of gas needs a late type galaxy for it s explanation . of course it is also possible that the galaxy has merged with gas clouds rather than bona fide galaxies .",
    "the specific frequency of gcs suggests that , if the present amount of gas can be consumed or expelled , this galaxy will probably evolve into an dwarf e / so galaxy once the merger remnant relaxes .",
    "the event 2.5 - 5 gyr ago must also have involved a gas rich dwarf in order to provide raw material for the large number of gcs formed then .",
    "an alternative explanation could be that the 2.5 - 5 gyr population partly was `` stolen '' from another dwarf elliptical .",
    "multi - colour photometry with hst / wfpc2 of the metal poor blue compact galaxy eso  338-ig04 ( tol  1924 - 416 ) has revealed a rich population of faint point - like sources in and surrounding the galaxy .",
    "aperture photometry has been performed on these , and the photometric results have been transformed into ages and masses using a spectral evolutionary synthesis model .",
    "special care was taken to assure that the sources are physically associated and not chance projected background or foreground sources .",
    "the results can be summarised as follows :    1 .",
    "the objects discussed in this paper have absolute magnitudes ,  @xmath61 , in the range -7 to -15 and @xmath30 colours ranging from less than -1 to almost 2 .",
    "the vast majority of the found objects are spatially resolved star clusters , physically associated with the galaxy .",
    "the outer objects follow the luminosity distribution of the galaxy closely ( fig .",
    "the number of interlopers , i.e. foreground stars , background galaxies and super giants in the target galaxy , in the presented sample is conservatively estimated to be less than ten objects .",
    "this leaves us with more than 112 detected star clusters in eso  338-ig04 .",
    "4 .   using the photometric evolution model",
    "we show that the objects , in general , are well fitted by salpeter and miller - scalo imfs , and that the resulting age distribution is insensitive to the adopted imf .",
    "the ages of the clusters range from a few myr to more than 10 gyr .",
    "the objects have inferred masses ranging from @xmath1 to more than @xmath2 .",
    "the above listed properties show that the objects are massive globular clusters of varying age .",
    "there are several peaks in the globular cluster age distribution .",
    "this shows that there have been several globular cluster forming events in this galaxy .",
    "these appear to have occurred  @xmath0 11 gyr ago , 2.5 - 5 gyr ago , 600 myr ago , 100 myr ago and `` now '' .",
    "the present event has lasted for a few times 10 myrs .",
    "more than half of the total expected number of gcs have an age in the range 2 to 5 gyr .",
    "this peak consists of two subpopulations with either different age ( @xmath266  gyr ) or metallicity ( @xmath267 } \\sim 1 $ ]  dex ) .",
    "the specific frequency , @xmath228 , is high in this galaxy .",
    "taking into account that the fading starburst will decrease the luminosity of the galaxy by 1.5 magnitudes in 1 gyr , this galaxy will be come very rich in globular clusters , even if the newly formed gcs do nt survive .",
    "the predicted specific frequency of globular clusters is much larger than for late type galaxies and comparable to that for giant ellipticals .",
    "we suggest that a merger is responsible for the current starburst and cluster formation . in view of the high specific frequency of old globular clusters",
    "suggests that an elliptical galaxy is a main ingredient in this system . to provide gas for star and cluster formation",
    "a gas rich dwarf must be the other main ingredient .",
    "a major formation event 2.5 - 5 gyr ago suggests that a merger involving one gas rich component also occurred at that time .",
    "11 . in view of the high specific frequency and the present merger",
    ", we suggest that this galaxy will evolve into a moderately luminous elliptical galaxy , unless disturbed by possible future interactions . 12 .",
    "this investigation for the first time gives strong support for a rich population both old and newly formed gcs in a metal poor blue compact galaxy .",
