    "the investigation of the asymptotic spectral distributions of random matrices with independent entries is a major topic in random matrix theory . in recent years",
    "sums and products of independent _ non - hermitian _ random matrices with independent entries have found increasing attention ; see e.g.  @xcite , and also the survey papers @xcite and the references therein . in particular , the paper @xcite provides a  general approach for the investigation of the limiting ( global ) spectral distributions of products of independent random matrices with independent entries .",
    "furthermore , the paper @xcite shows that this approach proves useful for the investigation of sums of products of independent random matrices as  well .",
    "the main aim of the present paper is to  show that certain products of independent random matrices give rise to random matrices with _",
    "stable _ limiting eigenvalue distributions , in the sense that the sums of several independent copies of these products have the same limiting eigenvalue distribution after appropriate rescaling .    throughout this paper , for each @xmath9 , let @xmath10 be independent random matrices of size @xmath2 with independent entries . more precisely , we  assume that @xmath11 where @xmath12 is a family of independent real  or  complex random variables such  that @xmath13 and @xmath14 and we additionally assume that this family is uniformly square - integrable , i.e. @xmath15 in this case we also say the matrices @xmath16 are independent _ girko  ginibre matrices_. in the special case where the entries have real or complex gaussian distributions , we usually write @xmath17 instead of @xmath18 and call the matrices @xmath19 _ gaussian random matrices _ or _",
    "ginibre matrices_. note that the assumption is clearly satisfied in this special case , the random variables @xmath20 being i.i.d .",
    "we are interested in the spectral distributions of sums of products of the matrices @xmath16 and their inverses , such as @xmath21 or @xmath22 , in  the limit  as @xmath7 .",
    "more precisely , we consider matrices of the form @xmath23 where @xmath24 , @xmath25 , and @xmath26 are fixed .",
    "( thus , the matrices @xmath27 are independent random matrices of the same form as the matrix @xmath28 . )",
    "let us note that under the  above assumptions ",
    ", for fixed @xmath29 , @xmath30 is invertible with probability @xmath31 as @xmath7 ( see lemma [ lemma : c1 ] ) , so  that @xmath32 is well - defined with probability @xmath31 as @xmath7 . since we are interested in limit theorems in  probability , this is sufficient for our purposes .",
    "furthermore , write @xmath33 for the eigenvalues of @xmath32 and @xmath34 for the _ ( empirical ) eigenvalue distribution _ of @xmath32 . note that @xmath35 will in general be a probability measure on the complex plane , @xmath32  being non - hermitian .",
    "we are interested in the problem(s ) whether there exists a non - random probability measure @xmath36 on the complex plane such that @xmath37 weakly ( in probability , say ) and whether this probability measure @xmath36 can be described more explicitly ( in terms of its density or one of its transforms , say ) .",
    "if existent , the probability measure @xmath36 is also called the _ limiting eigenvalue distribution _ of the matrices @xmath32 .    as is well known in random matrix theory , the limiting eigenvalue distribution @xmath36 is usually _ universal _ ,",
    "i.e. it does not depend on the distributions of the matrix entries apart from a  few moment conditions as in  .",
    "in our situation , we have the following universality result :    [ prop : simple - limit - theorem ] let the matrices @xmath32 be defined as in .",
    "then there exists a non - random probability measure @xmath36 on @xmath38 such that @xmath37 weakly in  probability , and the limiting eigenvalue distribution @xmath36 is same as in the gaussian case , i.e. for the corresponding matrices @xmath32 derived from gaussian random matrices @xmath39    for a closer description of the limiting eigenvalue distribution @xmath36 , see theorem  [ thm : limit - theorem ] below . for the moment , we confine ourselves to a few comments .",
    "first of all , by universality , it remains to find the limiting eigenvalue distribution @xmath36 in the gaussian case .",
    "now , the gaussian random matrices @xmath40 are _ bi - unitary invariant _ , i.e. for any unitary matrices @xmath41 and @xmath42 of size @xmath2 , the matrices @xmath43 have the same ( matrix - valued ) distributions as the matrices @xmath40 .",
    "this clearly implies that the limiting eigenvalue distribution @xmath36 of the matrices @xmath32 , if  existent , will be a  _ rotation - invariant _ probability measure on the complex plane , i.e. for any @xmath44 @xmath45 , the induced probability measure of @xmath36 under the mapping @xmath46 will coincide with  @xmath36 .",
    "hence , if @xmath36 has a density @xmath47 ( which will be the case in all our examples ) , this density may be supposed to be rotation - invariant as well , and we write @xmath48 instead of @xmath49 , with @xmath50 .",
    "let us mention some relevant results from the literature .",

    "\\(f ) let @xmath68",

    "thus , for the rescaled matrices @xmath70 , the  limiting eigenvalue distribution is again the spherical distribution on the complex plane .    in view of examples ( b ) and ( f )",
    ", it seems natural to ask whether there exist further examples of random matrices @xmath5 such that for any @xmath24 , the sums of @xmath71 independent matrices of the same form as @xmath5 have the same limiting eigenvalue distribution as the original random matrices @xmath5 , after appropriate rescaling .",
    "we  will answer this question in the affirmative by proving the following result , which contains examples ( b ) and ( f ) as special cases :    [ thm : new ] fix @xmath24 and @xmath72 , let @xmath73 where @xmath1 are independent random matrices as in  , and let @xmath4 be independent matrices of the same form as @xmath5 . then the  matrices @xmath74 and @xmath5 have the same limiting eigenvalue distribution @xmath36 .",

    "( see section  [ sec : fpt ] ) .",
    "let us note that for @xmath80 and @xmath81 , we re - obtain the above - mentioned results from tikhomirov and timushev @xcite .",
    "moreover , as we will see in section  3 , apart from a possible permutation of the exponents @xmath82 , the matrices @xmath5 in theorem  [ thm : new ] are the only examples of products of _ independent _ girko  ginibre matrices and their inverses such that for any @xmath24 , @xmath5 and @xmath83 have the same limiting eigenvalue distribution after appropriate rescaling .",
    "in particular , the matrices @xmath84 with @xmath85 do not share this property .    however , the same limiting eigenvalue distributions may arise for products involving _ powers _ of random matrices :    [ thm : newpower ] fix @xmath24 , @xmath86 and @xmath87 , let @xmath88 and @xmath89 where @xmath90 are independent random matrices as in  , and let @xmath4 be independent matrices of the same form as @xmath5 .",
    "then the  matrices @xmath74 and @xmath5 have the same limiting eigenvalue  distribution @xmath36 , which is the same as in theorem [ thm : new ] .    to obtain the preceding results ,",
    "we  apply the general framework from @xcite for the investigation of ( global ) limiting spectral distributions to sums of products of  independent girko ",
    "ginibre random matrices and their inverses ( see section  [ sec : limit - theorem ] ) . related results for various special cases can be found e.g. in @xcite . in particular , in the gaussian case ,",
    "the limiting eigenvalue and singular value distributions of the products were recently obtained in @xcite and @xcite , respectively .    furthermore , to identify the limiting spectral distributions",
    ", we use tools from free probability theory . here",
    "it is worth emphasizing that for the matrices occurring in theorems [ thm : new ] and [ thm : newpower ] the limiting spectral distributions may be described relatively explicitly .",
    "it seems that comparable results are available only in a  few special cases , see e.g. @xcite .",
    "let us mention , however , the very recent work @xcite which provides an algorithm for calculating the brown measures of general polynomials in free non - commutative random variables .",
    "this yields many further examples where the limiting spectral distributions may now be determined .",
    "we present formal proofs of theorems [ thm : new ] and [ thm : newpower ] in section  [ sec : formalproof ] , after recalling some relevant facts from random matrix theory and free probability theory in section  [ sec : background ] . in section  [ sec : convolution ] , we point out that the limiting spectral distributions in theorem [ thm : new ] may be viewed as _ stable _ distributions with respect to an appropriate convolution @xmath8 defined on a certain set of rotation - invariant probability measures on the complex plane , and we discuss some generalizations of theorem  [ thm : new ] .",
    "section  [ sec : limit - theorem ] is  devoted to the proof of an enhanced version of proposition [ prop : simple - limit - theorem ] , viz .",
    "theorem  [ thm : limit - theorem ] . in particular , combining the formal proofs from section [ sec : formalproof ] with that of theorem  [ thm : limit - theorem ] , we obtain rigorous proofs of theorems [ thm : new ] and [ thm : newpower ] ; see section [ sub : rigor ] for details .",

    "it is worth pointing out that there is another description of the density @xmath181 of the limiting eigenvalue distribution in theorem [ thm : main ] .",
    "this description is due to haagerup and larsen @xcite for probability measures with bounded support and to haagerup and schultz @xcite for probability measures with unbounded support .",

    "an @xmath154-diagonal element is a non - commutative random variable of the form @xmath183 , where @xmath184 is a  haar unitary and @xmath185 is positive element @xmath186-free from @xmath184 .    for our purposes ,",
    "this description of the density @xmath47 may be summarized as  follows : in the situation of theorem [ thm : main ] , suppose that the matrices @xmath187 have a  limiting distribution @xmath188 on @xmath109 which is not a dirac measure and for which @xmath189 let @xmath190 denote the @xmath129-transform of @xmath188 , and set @xmath191 then @xmath192 is a smooth bijection from the interval @xmath193 to the interval @xmath194 ( where @xmath195 and @xmath196 ) , and the limiting eigenvalue distribution @xmath97 of the  matrices @xmath32 has a rotation - invariant density @xmath48 given by @xmath197 clearly , the connection to the above theorem [ thm : main ] arises from the fact that @xmath198 on the interval @xmath199 . furthermore , equation shows that @xmath200 , which implies that @xmath201 is uniquely determined by @xmath97 .",

    "in this section we give a formal proof of theorem [ thm : new ] in the gaussian case which  conveys the main idea without being cluttered by technical details .",

    "the proof of theorem [ thm : new ] presented here is formal in that we use the concept of _ asymptotic freeness _ for random matrices whose ` moments ' ( in the sense of free probability theory ) do not exist .",
    "moreover , we use theorem [ thm : main ] purely formally without checking the assumptions .",
    "however , the argument can easily be converted into a  rigorous proof by using the regularization procedure and the results from section  5 ; see section  [ sub : rigor ] for more comments .",
    "similar remarks pertain to the  proof of theorem [ thm : newpower ] .",
    "recall that we concentrate on the gaussian case , we have @xmath234 , where @xmath235 are independent random matrices of dimension @xmath2 with independent real or complex gaussian entries with mean @xmath54 and variance @xmath236 .",
