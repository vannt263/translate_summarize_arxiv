    "at low energies and baryon densities _ quantum chromo dynamics _ ( qcd ) is in the confined phase where chiral symmetry is spontaneously broken while at high temperature or density the quarks and gluons form a correlated plasma in which chiral symmetry is restored .",
    "the various phases of qcd are characterized by order ( and disorder ) parameters . these order ( and disorder )",
    "parameters are vacuum expectation values of certain gauge invariant products of quark and gluon operators and are usually referred to as condensates .",
    "the most prominent ones are the quark condensate @xmath0 and the gluon condensate @xmath1 .",
    "these condensates play an important role in the operator product expansion where they incorporate the vacuum properties and they are central to qcd sum rule calculations .    in in a series of papers @xcite it was recently argued that the strong interaction condensates like the quark and gluon condensate are not properties of the qcd vacuum but instead associated with the internal dynamics of hadrons . to substantiate this interpretation the authors of those papers allude to the light front formulation of spontaneous breaking of chiral symmetry @xcite and the description of hadrons in terms of dyson  schwinger and bethe  salpeter equations @xcite .",
    "this interpretation has far reaching consequences . if the quark and gluon condensates are not properties of the qcd vacuum but of the hadrons they do not contribute to the cosmological constant while a naive ( unrenormalized ) inclusion of the condensates would result in a cosmological constant , which is about a factor of @xmath2 larger than the currently accepted value .    in this paper",
    "we provide strong arguments that invalidate the interpretation of the qcd condensates as `` in  hadron '' properties as proposed in ref . @xcite .",
    "in addition , we will present a model calculation that clearly shows that the translationally invariant quark condensate is a vacuum property .",
    "however , this condensate is strongly distorted inside the hadrons .",
    "low energy hadron physics is dominated by chiral dynamics .",
    "the concept of approximate chiral symmetry for the light quark flavors , being spontaneously broken in the ground state with the pseudoscalar mesons , like pions and kaons , identified as goldstone bosons , has been overwhelmingly successful .",
    "the order parameter of chiral symmetry breaking is the quark condensate : it is non  zero in the chiral symmetry broken phase and vanishes ( for massless quarks ) in the chirally symmetric phase . for the moment",
    "let us assume that the picture of `` in  hadron '' condensates put forward in ref .",
    "@xcite were correct , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath3 inside the hadrons and @xmath4 outside . this would imply that chiral symmetry is spontaneously broken only inside the hadrons , while the exterior of hadrons is in the chirally symmetric phase .",
    "consequently the corresponding goldstone boson , the pion , could exist only inside other hadrons .",
    "outside the lightest particle with pion quantum numbers would be massive and degenerate with the @xmath5 .",
    "this , of course , contradicts the experimental observation .",
    "the pion is measured outside the hadrons with a light mass ( for example in a bubble chamber ) . for an additional counter  argument consider nuclear matter as an ensemble of hadrons .",
    "if chiral symmetry were spontaneously broken only inside the hadrons then there would be no reason why this symmetry is restored when the density of baryons is increased .",
    "if the condensates were indeed hadron properties , their universal character could not be sustained , no mechanism would prevent them to depend on the peculiarities of the considered hadron .",
    "furthermore we recall recent indications @xcite that at high density a so  called quarkyonic phase of baryonic matter exists where quarks and gluons are still confined but chiral symmetry is restored .",
    "it is thus very unlikely that confinement restricts chiral symmetry breaking to the interior of hadrons .",
    "the discussion in ref .",
    "@xcite does , unfortunately , not illuminate the specific manner in which confinement would trigger such a restriction .",
    "the mere feature that condensates are extracted from hadron properties seems irrelevant .",
    "this is true for other global quantities and external fields .",
    "the above considerations of empirical facts strongly suggest that the interpretation of condensates as hadron properties is invalid . and indeed , currently accepted baryon models manifest the opposite picture .",
    "the quark condensate is non ",
    "zero outside the baryon while it vanishes or is , at least , substantially reduced inside the hadrons , _",
    "i.e. _ chiral symmetry is spontaneously broken outside the hadrons and at least partially restored inside . to investigate condensates as eventual hadron properties ,",
    "the model must allow for a localized description of hadrons .",
    "we will present such a model calculation in the next section .",
    "the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite also refer to the superconductor to support their interpretation that the condensates are confined to a finite volume .",
    "of course , an actual superconductor has a finite volume .",
    "however , compared to the characteristic wave length of the electrons in the superconductor the latter can , of course , be considered as infinitely extended .",
    "the superconductor is actually a quite realistic analog to the qcd vacuum .",
    "in fact , there is lattice evidence @xcite that confinement is realized by the dual meissner effect implying that the qcd vacuum represents a dual superconductor . in this analogy",
    "the occupied electron levels below the fermi surface correspond to the occupied quark levels of the dirac sea .",
    "usually the electron ( cooper-)pair condensate is spread out through the whole superconductor and external magnetic fields are expelled by the meissner effect .",
    "if , however , an external magnetic field is applied to a type ii superconductor and the field strength exceeds a certain critical value the magnetic field can penetrate the superconductor in form of magnetic vortices ( flux tubes ) . at the position of the vortices the superconducting phase",
    "is destroyed and the u(1)symmetry is restored .",
    "the magnetic vortices have the same effect on the superconductor as the valence quarks on the qcd vacuum : their presence causes a local restoration ( at least partially ) of the symmetry that is spontaneously broken in the vacuum .    from the above given arguments and",
    "the model calculations presented below we conclude that the qcd condensates are indeed vacuum but not hadron properties .",
    "the quark condensate can be obtained from the functional @xmath6d[q]\\,\\overline{q}q \\ , { \\rm exp}(i\\mathcal{a } ) } { \\int d[\\overline{q}]d[q]\\ , { \\rm exp}(i\\mathcal{a})}\\ , \\label{eq : def1}\\ ] ] with @xmath7 $ ] being the underlying action of the quark field @xmath8 .",

    "hadron nature of condensates were due to qcd being a confining theory , a property not manifest in our model calculation . yet the explicit formulas in those papers do not reveal the specific role of confinement . to a large extend ref .",

    "functions  @xcite , the current model calculation does not indicate that the range of the quark condensate is related to that of the nucleon wave  function ( represented by the baryon density ) .",
    "apparently the subtle puzzle of the too large contribution from condensates to the cosmological constant remains .",
    "we note , however , that the non  zero condensates are quantum effects , as is the zero point energy contribution to the cosmological constant .",
