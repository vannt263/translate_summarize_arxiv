    "observations of quasars at redshifts @xmath3 demonstrate that supermassive black holes ( smbhs ) with masses of order @xmath4 had already managed to form by the time that the universe was one billion years old . however , this is difficult to understand if these smbhs form from the seed black holes with masses @xmath5 that are produced as the endpoints of the evolution of massive stars .",
    "the problem is one of timescales : even if we assume that accretion onto these seed black holes is very efficient , the time required for one of them to grow to a mass of @xmath4 can easily exceed the age of the universe at @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "for this reason , an alternative model for the formation of the progenitors of high - redshift smbhs has recently attracted considerable interest . in this model ,",
    "known as the direct collapse model , gas in a protogalaxy with a virial temperature @xmath6 that is illuminated by an extremely strong extragalactic radiation field collapses quasi - isothermally , maintaining its temperature in the range @xmath710000  k through the combined effects of atomic hydrogen cooling and h@xmath8 bound - free cooling @xcite .",
    "the high temperature keeps the jeans mass in the collapsing gas high and inhibits fragmentation during the collapse ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the precise outcome of the collapse remains uncertain , but the most likely outcomes are either the formation of a short - lived supermassive star or a quasi - star , a massive , optically - thick core whose centre has already collapsed to form a black hole @xcite . in either case , the end result is the formation of an intermediate mass black hole ( imbh ) with a mass @xmath9 or larger .",
    "the time required for this much larger seed black hole to grow by accretion into a @xmath4 smbh is short enough that this mechanism can explain the existence of the observed high redshift smbhs .",
    "in addition , the strength of the extragalactic radiation field required to suppress h@xmath0 formation and the associated cooling in the collapsing gas is much larger than the mean value produced by early stellar populations @xcite .",
    "this means that the formation of an imbh by direct collapse will be a rare event , occurring only in a small number of protogalaxies located in highly clustered regions where the local radiation field strength can be orders of magnitude above the mean value @xcite .",
    "the viability of the direct collapse model depends upon just how rare this outcome is , and hence on how strong the radiation field needs to be in order to sufficiently suppress h@xmath0 formation .",
    "if direct collapse occurs too rarely , then not enough imbh progenitors will be produced to explain the observed number density of smbhs at high redshift .",
    "unfortunately , there is little agreement on the precise value of the radiation field strength required .",
    "this is usually quantified in terms of the specific intensity of the ultraviolet portion of the radiation field at the lyman limit .",
    "following @xcite , it is common to measure this in units of @xmath10 and to write it as @xmath11 .",
    "the minimum value of @xmath11 for which h@xmath12 cooling is sufficiently suppressed is then commonly denoted as @xmath2 .",
    "physically , the value of @xmath2 depends strongly on the shape of the spectrum of the extragalactic radiation field @xcite and on the strength of any extragalactic x - ray background or cosmic ray background @xcite . however , our ability to determine @xmath2 accurately from simulations is also affected by uncertainties arising from the way in which the chemistry of h@xmath12 is modelled in these simulations",
    ".    there are three main ways in which the chemical model adopted can affect @xmath2 .",
    "first , its value in some circumstances is highly sensitive to the way in which the effects of h@xmath0 self - shielding are modelled @xcite .",
    "second , for reasons of computational efficiency , it is common to model the chemistry of the gas using a highly simplified chemical network , but if the model is made too simple , then errors of up to a factor of a few can be introduced into @xmath2 ( @xcite , 2015 ; hereafter , paper i ) .",
    "finally , as we explore in this paper , @xmath2 is also sensitive to the values adopted for the rate coefficients of some of the key chemical reactions occurring in the gas .",
    "since most chemical rate coefficients are not known absolutely precisely , uncertainties in the input rate coefficients inevitably introduce an uncertainty into the value of @xmath2 predicted by the simulations . in this study , we attempt to quantify the size of this uncertainty and to identify which chemical reactions make the largest contributions to it .",
    "in addition , as many previous numerical studies of the direct collapse model have adopted values for some of the chemical rate coefficients that are now known to differ significantly from the actual values , we also explore how sensitive @xmath2 is to these choices .",
    "the structure of our paper is as follows . in section  [ method ] ,",
    "we briefly present the numerical method we use in our study . in section  [ chemunc ]",
    ", we quantify the sensitivity of @xmath2 to the rate of each of the chemical reactions included in our model . using this information",
    ", we identify a subset of reactions for which the sensitivity is large and critically discuss the uncertainties that exist in the rate coefficients for each of these reactions . in section  [ coolunc ] ,",
    "we carry out a similar analysis for the different cooling processes included in our model . in section",
    "[ discuss ] , we combine our results and attempt to estimate the overall uncertainty in @xmath2 due to uncertainties in the chemical and cooling rate coefficients . we also compare the results of our analysis with those of previous studies of the direct collapse model .",
    "finally , we summarize the main results of our paper in section  [ conc ] .",
    "we model the thermal and chemical evolution of gravitationally collapsing gas in halos illuminated by a strong extragalactic radiation field using the same one - zone model as described in detail in paper i. we assume that the gas density evolves as @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the gravitational free - fall time .",
    "the thermal evolution of the gas is followed by solving the internal energy equation @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the internal energy density , @xmath17 is the gas pressure , @xmath18 is the radiative and chemical heating rate per unit volume and @xmath19 is the radiative and chemical cooling rate per unit volume .",
    "these are computed using the detailed atomic and molecular cooling function introduced in @xcite and updated in paper i.    to model the chemical evolution of the gas , we use the conservative reduced network derived in paper i. this consists of 25 reactions involving 8 different chemical species : e@xmath8 , h@xmath20 , h , h@xmath8 , h@xmath21 , h@xmath0 , he and heh@xmath20 . in paper i",
    "we showed that the difference between the value of @xmath2 derived using this network and that derived using a comprehensive chemical model of primordial gas is around 1% , much smaller than the uncertainties considered in this paper .",
    "the full list of reactions included in our model is given in table  [ tab : react ] .",
    "we model the effects of the external ultraviolet background using two different spectral shapes : a @xmath22  k black - body , cut off at @xmath23  ev to account for absorption by neutral hydrogen , and a @xmath24  k black - body cut off at the same energy . for brevity",
    ", we refer to these two spectral shapes in the remainder of the paper as t5 and t4 spectra , respectively .",
    "the normalization of the radiation field is specified in terms of its specific intensity at the lyman limit , measured in units of @xmath10 , and written as @xmath11 .",
    "we assume that the gravitationally collapsing gas is optically thin in the continuum and model the effects of h@xmath0 self - shielding using the modified version of the @xcite shielding function given in @xcite : @xmath25,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath26 , @xmath27 , and @xmath28 is the doppler broadening parameter , which we assume to be dominated by the effects of thermal broadening . to compute @xmath29",
    ", we assume that the dominant contribution comes from within a central dense core with radius equal to the jeans length , and hence estimate @xmath29 as @xmath30 , where @xmath31 is the jeans length .    as in paper i , we caution that the simple approximation used here to compute @xmath29 may yield values that are systematically incorrect by up to an order of magnitude .",
    "the absolute values derived here for @xmath2 should therefore be treated with caution . however",
    ", this systematic uncertainty should not affect the conclusions we draw here regarding the sensitivity of @xmath2 to uncertainties in the chemical rate coefficient adopted in the model .      in paper",
    "i , we found , in common with previous authors , that the value of @xmath2 depended only very weakly on our choices for the initial temperature , density and ionization state of the gas .",
    "the reason for this lack of sensitivity is that the question of whether or not enough h@xmath0 forms in the gas to provide efficient cooling to temperatures @xmath32 is generally decided once the gas has already reached a number density of 1001000  @xmath33 , by which time it retains only a weak memory of its initial conditions ( see e.g.  @xcite or paper i ) .",
    "therefore , in this study we consider runs performed using only a single set of initial conditions .",
    "we set the initial temperature to @xmath34  k , the initial hydrogen nuclei number density to @xmath35 , and assume that the initial fractional ionization and h@xmath0 fractional abundance are close to those found in the igm prior to the onset of pop .",
    "iii star formation ( @xmath36 , @xmath37 ) .",
    "we assume that the gas is initially in charge balance , so that @xmath38 , and place all of the hydrogen not accounted for by h@xmath20 or h@xmath0 in atomic form .",
    "we also assume that the helium starts entirely in neutral atomic form , and that the initial abundances of the other three chemical species in our network ( h@xmath8 , h@xmath21 , and heh@xmath20 ) are zero .",
    "we note that these initial conditions are the same as those adopted in runs 2 and 5 in paper i.",
    "as the starting point for our study , we first explore how sensitively our derived value of @xmath2 depends on the rate coefficient of each of the reactions in our chemical model .",
    "we do this for purely pragmatical reasons : if the value of @xmath2 is insensitive to the value of a particular rate coefficient , there is little point in spending time and effort critically assessing how well we know that value of that rate coefficient .    to assess how sensitive @xmath2 is to variations in the rate coefficients of the reactions in our reduced network ,",
    "we construct 52 different variants of our chemical model . in each of these variant models ,",
    "the rate of one of the rate coefficients for our reduced set of 26 reactions is adjusted either upwards or downwards by a factor of @xmath39 from its fiducial value .",
    "we then determine @xmath2 for each of these models , for both a t4 and a t5 spectrum . by comparing the outcome of the case in which a rate coefficient was adjusted upwards with the outcome of the case in which the same rate coefficient was adjusted downwards",
    ", we can quantify the effect of an order of magnitude change in that rate coefficient .",
    "the results of this analysis are shown in table  [ tab : react ] .",
    "the sensitivity values we quote in the table are defined as the ratio of the largest and the smallest values of @xmath2 that we obtain when modifying the rate coefficient of the specified reaction , i.e.@xmath40 with this definition , in a case where @xmath2 depends linearly on the rate coefficient in question we would expect to obtain a sensitivity of 10 , while a value of 1 shows us that @xmath2 is sensitive only to the inclusion of that reaction in the network , and not to the value of the rate coefficient adopted for the reaction .    from table",
    "[ tab : react ] , we see that @xmath2 is highly sensitive to the values of the rate coefficients for only a small subset of the reactions included in our minimal model .",
    "specifically , if we restrict our attention to those reactions for which the sensitivity exceeds 1.25 ( i.e.  where an order of magnitude change in the rate coefficient results in a change in @xmath2 of greater than 25% ) , then we find that in runs performed with a t4 spectrum , the high sensitivity reactions are numbers 1 - 3 , 5 - 8 , 10 and 12 . in runs performed with a t5 spectrum , we find high sensitivities for a slightly different subset of reactions , numbers 1 - 3 , 5 , 6 , 8 , 10 - 12 , and 22 .",
    "this difference in behaviour is a consequence of the difference in the identity of the key process suppressing h@xmath0 cooling in the runs with different incident spectra . in runs with a t4 spectrum ,",
    "h@xmath8 photodetachment plays a much greater role than h@xmath0 photodissociation in suppressing the h@xmath0 abundance .",
    "therefore , we find that in these runs , @xmath2 is only weakly sensitive to the h@xmath0 photodissociation rate ( reaction 1 ) , but has a much greater sensitivity to the h@xmath8 photodetachment rate ( reaction 7 ) . on the other hand , in runs with a t5 spectrum ,",
    "h@xmath0 photodissociation dominates , and so the value of @xmath2 depends strongly on the rate of reaction 1 , but has hardly any sensitivity at all to the rate of reaction 7 , since in this case other reactions dominate the destruction of h@xmath8 .",
    "[ cols=\"^,<,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]      direct comparison between the results we obtain with our chemical network and those obtained using the enzo primordial chemistry network is complicated by the fact that the enzo network not only makes different choices for a number of the chemical and cooling rate coefficients , but also consists of a different set of chemical reactions from those included in our model .",
    "in particular , the chemical network implemented in the most recent version of the enzo code ( version 2.4 ) omits two processes that have a significant influence on the value of @xmath2 : the collisional ionization of h by h ( reaction 10 ) and the dissociative tunneling contribution to the h@xmath0 collisional dissociation rate .",
    "therefore , to allow us to distinguish between the differences in @xmath2 caused by the omission of these reactions and the differences in @xmath2 caused by the differences in the rate coefficients , we compare our results with those from two additional sets of calculations .",
    "in one , we use the unmodified enzo network . in the other",
    ", we use a version of this network that we have modified to include the two omitted processes mentioned above .",
    "the results of our comparison are shown in table  [ tab : compare ] .",
    "we see that the enzo network systematically produces higher values of @xmath2 that those derived using our network . with the unmodified enzo network ,",
    "@xmath2 is increased by almost a factor of two for both the t4 and the t5 spectrum . with the modified network , on the other hand , the increase is smaller : around 30% for the t4 spectrum and 50% for the t5 spectrum .",
    "note that these values were computing using the case a hydrogen recombination rate , which is the default choice in enzo .",
    "if we instead use the case b rate , which is more physically appropriate in the present case , we recover values of @xmath2 that are almost a factor of two larger than those in table  [ tab : compare ] .",
    "the highest value quoted in the literature for @xmath2 in the case of a t4 spectrum and a one - zone calculation comes from @xcite , who find that @xmath41 , roughly a factor of two larger than most other estimates .",
    "however , they use the enzo chemistry network in their study , and our results here suggest that much of this factor of two differences is due to the composition of their network and their choice of reaction rate coefficients .",
    "it therefore seems plausible that most of the scatter in the reported values of @xmath2 for the t4 spectrum comes from differences in the chemical models used for the different studies .",
    "as already noted in paper i , the krome package provides a number of different networks suitable for simulating primordial gas , but provides little guidance regarding which network should be used for which application . for studying direct collapse",
    ", the most suitable choice appears to be the _",
    "react_xrays _ network .",
    "we therefore use this as the basis of our comparison . as in the case of the enzo network",
    ", this omits the effects of the collisional ionization of h by h , and so when carrying out our comparison , we consider both the unmodified version of the _ react_xrays _ network plus a modified version that includes this reaction .",
    "our results are shown in table  [ tab : compare ] .",
    "we see that the unmodified network underestimates @xmath2 by around a factor of two .",
    "including the collisional ionization of h by h improves the situation slightly , but even in this case the krome network still significantly underestimates @xmath2 .",
    "we have investigated the causes of this discrepancy and find that it is largely driven by the choice of h@xmath20 recombination rate .",
    "the krome _",
    "react_xrays _ network adopts the case a rate for this process , which causes the h@xmath20 abundance to fall off more rapidly with increasing density than in our models . if we instead use the more physically appropriate case b rate , we find much better agreement between the krome results and our own determination of @xmath2 .",
    "this demonstrates that the error introduced into @xmath2 is solely a consequence of the particular choice of network and rate coefficients , and not any intrinsic problem within the krome infrastructure itself ",
    "if krome is used simply as an ode solver and cooling function , with a user - supplied chemical network that includes all of the important chemical reactions and an up - to - date set of rate coefficients , then we expect it to be able to produce exactly the same values of @xmath2 as we find in our study .",
    "in this paper , we have attempted to determine the extent to which estimates of @xmath2 are affected by uncertainties in the chemical rate coefficients and cooling rates used to model the chemical and thermal evolution of primordial gas . to do this",
    ", we first examined how sensitive @xmath2 is to variation in the rate coefficients of the 26 reactions included in the reduced chemical network of @xcite . for those reactions where the sensitivity is large",
    ", we then critically examined the information available regarding the values of their rate coefficients , and quantified the effect of uncertainties in these values on our derived value of @xmath2 .",
    "we also carried out a similar analysis for the main cooling processes included in our model .",
    "we found that there are five key chemical reactions where the combination of sensitivity and uncertainty leads to an appreciable ( @xmath42% ) uncertainty in @xmath2 .",
    "these are the collisional dissociation of h@xmath0 by h ( reaction 2 ) , the formation of h@xmath0 by associative detachment of h@xmath8 ( reaction 3 ) , the formation of h@xmath8 by radiative association ( reaction 6 ) , the collisional ionization of h by h ( reaction 10 ) and the collisional detachment of h@xmath8 by h ( reaction 11 ) , although the last of these is important only in situations where h@xmath8 photodetachment is unimportant . amongst these reactions ,",
    "the single largest uncertainty comes from the collisional ionization of h by h , a process which is very poorly constrained at the low energies relevant for this study @xcite .",
    "in addition , in gas illuminated with a hard t5 spectrum , @xmath2 is also highly sensitive to the value of the h@xmath0 photodissociation rate , although in this case the intrinsic uncertainty in the rate is small , and the main difficulty comes from the fact that computationally efficient treatments of h@xmath0 self - shielding are often highly over - simplified ( see e.g. * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "the total uncertainty introduced into @xmath2 by uncertainties in the remaining 20 reactions is small in comparison to the effects of these six reactions .",
    "similarly , the remaining uncertainties in the cooling rates of h@xmath0 and atomic hydrogen do not significantly affect @xmath2 .    in the unlikely event that the errors in the different rate coefficients combine so as to maximum or minimize @xmath2",
    ", we find that for a t4 spectrum , @xmath43 and @xmath44 , while for a t5 spectrum , @xmath45 and @xmath46 .",
    "therefore , in the worst case , chemical rate coefficient uncertainties could introduce an uncertainty of around a factor of five into our estimates of @xmath2 . in the more likely case that the errors in the different rate coefficients are uncorrelated",
    ", we find that @xmath2 probably lies in the range @xmath47 for a t4 spectrum and @xmath48 for a t5 spectrum .",
    "finally , we have compared the values of @xmath2 that we have derived using our reaction network and rate coefficients with those that we obtain if we use instead the network and rate coefficients from ( a ) the enzo hydrodynamical code or ( b ) the krome astrochemistry package , both of which have been used in a number of previous studies of the direct collapse model .",
    "we find that the enzo chemical model tends to overestimate @xmath2 by around a factor of two , although this discrepancy increases to a factor of four if the physically appropriate case b hydrogen recombination rate is used in place of the case a rate that is the default in enzo .",
    "the krome model , on the other hand , underestimates @xmath2 by around a factor of two .",
    "the author would like to thank the anonymous referee for their detailed report on an earlier version of this paper , and for calculating the rate coefficient for h - h collisional ionization quoted in equation  [ ksrate ] .",
