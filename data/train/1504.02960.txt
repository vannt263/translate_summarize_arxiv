    "in the microwave - based implementation the required two spin states defined as @xmath2 are separated by an energy splitting in the microwave regime @xcite .",
    "the spin - spin interaction , which constructs multi - qubit gates , is induced via the exchange of virtual phonons between the ions , in the weak coupling regime @xcite , or real phonons in the strong coupling regime @xcite .",
    "therefore , a coupling between the spin and the interaction - mediating phonon is needed .",
    "due to the negligibly small lamb - dicke parameter associated with microwave radiation , inducing a sufficiently strong spin - phonon coupling requires the use of a large magnetic field gradient .",
    "there are two basic approaches to obtain a magnetic field gradient .",
    "one approach makes use of an oscillating magnetic field gradient induced by the microwave driving field in the near field regime , where the spin - phonon coupling is already linked to the driving fields which perform the gate @xcite .",
    "this enables to utilize qubits that can have first order magnetic field insensitive transitions @xcite ; namely , the qubit states should be magnetic field sensitive , yet the energy difference between the two states is insensitive to the first order in the magnetic field . therefore , these qubits are decoupled from the ambient magnetic noise , and thus can be considered as clock qubits .",
    "the other approach uses a static magnetic field gradient @xcite . here , the qubits must have first order field sensitive transitions , making them extremely sensitive to the ambient magnetic noise , which imposes the use of dynamical decoupling techniques .",
    "furthermore , in this approach the spin - phonon coupling is not linked to driving field transitions that eventually perform the gate . in order to analyze this setting",
    ", one can apply a polaron - like transformation @xcite . in that case",
    ", there always remain undesired transitions , which originate directly from the static magnetic field gradient @xcite .",
    "not accounting for these transitions may damage the gate fidelity , and adiabatically eliminating them imposes restrictions on experimental parameters , such as an upper bound to the effective lamb - dicke parameter , which can significantly increase the gate duration .",
    "instead of using the dressing fields as the gate performing term , in this proposal , the gate is generated directly by the static magnetic field gradient .",
    "to realize a gate in the strong coupling regime , it is necessary to have sideband addressing of the resolvable secular frequencies , namely to couple to only one common mode of motion of secular frequency @xmath3 .",
    "this is done by applying a microwave driving field on - resonance with the bare qubit @xmath2 , whose rabi frequency is nearly equal to the selected common mode of motion , @xmath4 , and far detuned from all the other modes .",
    "for a two - qubit gate , an increase of the gate speed could be obtained by coupling to two modes , with opposite detunings .",
    "this is done by setting the microwave rabi frequency exactly between the two modes ; however , for the simplicity of the derivation , we only consider coupling to one mode .",
    "due to the constant magnetic gradient and the difference in the magnetic moments of the spin states @xmath5 and @xmath6 , a state - dependent force is obtained .",
    "in addition , each ion feels different magnetic field , and as consequence , different zeeman splitting .",
    "therefore , the hamiltonian can be written as @xmath7 which includes the selected vibrational mode with secular frequency @xmath3 , the bare state energy structure of the @xmath8 ion , the magnetic field gradient , and resonant microwave driving fields applied to the @xmath8 ion respectively ( fig .",

    "second , we would like to have a maximally entangled state when starting with a separable state , so we require @xmath53 .",
    "these constraints determine the connection between the detuning and the rabi frequency of the sideband transitions , and the gate time , @xmath54 and @xmath55 , respectively .",
    "all of the assumptions made during the above derivation can be summarized as @xmath56",

    ", we have also neglected other terms from eq .",
    "[ lamb - dicke regime ] . in this section",
    "we will estimate the leading contribution of these fidelity damaging terms , and suggest a way to counter them using spin - echo .",
    "large magnetic gradient enables single addressing @xcite , since each ion feels different magnetic field , and as consequence , a different zeeman splitting .",
    "suppose we have two ions in our trap , aligned in the @xmath57 direction .",

    "this is due to the following three reasons : 1 . )",
    "applying a @xmath71-phase flip of the rf driving field , does not change the gate hamiltonian ( eq . [ red2 ] ) .",
    "it turns out that all the leading contributions of the a.c stark shifts ( eq .",

    "another advantage of applying a @xmath71-phase flip of the rf driving field is that it can work even for @xmath73 , as opposed to the @xmath71-pulse technique .    since eq .",
    "[ ac2 ] is also coupled to the phononic states @xmath74 , which are populated during the gate duration , ( especially due to the electric field effect , as will be discussed below ) , applying a single @xmath75phase flip may not be sufficient to obtain high fidelity .",
    "for that reason , we can apply a sequence of @xmath75phase flips .",
    "note that this sequence can be performed even within a single cycle in phase plane @xmath76 .",
    "we can evaluate the higher order contribution of the neglected terms using the simulation of the gate performance , including all the terms mentioned above without any approximation . in the simulation we have two yb ions of mass @xmath77 , magnetic gradient @xmath78 , secular frequency @xmath79 , effective lamb - dicke parameter @xmath80 , microwave field rabi frequency @xmath81 , rf field rabi frequency @xmath82 , one loop in phase space @xmath83 , the off - resonant microwave driving field contribution where @xmath84 , starting in the vibrational ground state , namely , the initial number of phonons is @xmath85 .",
    "this gives a gate duration of @xmath86 msec .",

    "[ delta ] would vanish . simulating all the terms but eq .",

    "there are several noise sources in this proposal , which are significantly suppressed using concatenated continuous dynamical decoupling @xcite .",
    "the main noise source originates from ambient magnetic field fluctuations .",

    "the second important noise source originates from fluctuations in the rabi frequency of the resonant microwave driving field .",
    "the rabi frequency fluctuations are one of the most fidelity damaging sources in reference @xcite .",
    "to protect our gate from this , we use a resonant rf or a detuned microwave driving field ( eq.[radio2 ] ) , whose effect can be shown in the double - dressed state basis , the eigenstates of @xmath101 .",
    "the @xmath57 direction is orthogonal to the resonant microwave driving field s polarization , and therefore to the rabi frequency fluctuations , which is described by the operator @xmath16 ( fig .",
    "[ dressed rf ] , [ dressed m ] ) ; thus , by moving to the interaction picture of the double - dressed state energy structure , as was done in eq.[red2 ] , the suppression of the rabi frequency noise is achieved . since the rabi frequency of the resonant microwave field is much larger than the rabi frequency of the rf or the detuned microwave driving field , the noise originated from fluctuations in one of those driving fields",
    "is less fidelity - damaging .",
    "we can estimate the infidelity due to these noise sources .",
    "previous experiments @xcite have shown that the dephasing rate of the ambient magnetic field noise was suppressed by the dressing microwave radiation to less than @xmath102 hz . with higher dressing rabi frequencies the dephasing rate would be decreased as @xmath103 assuming that the correlation time of the magnetic noise is much longer than @xmath104 .",
    "the dephasing rate due to the rabi frequency fluctuations without additional dressing fields can be approximated as @xmath105 .",
    "the time correlation of this noise source is long in most experiments , i.e. , of the same order as the two qubit gate rate .",
    "thus , by applying the second dressing fields , the first order noise is completely suppressed @xmath106 . yet , the second order contribution of this noise , which is an a.c stark shift , becomes dominant and behaves as @xmath107 .",
    "the second order contribution of the rabi frequency noise source has a long time correlation , and since it is an odd function of @xmath72 , with the spin - echo @xmath75phase flip , its contribution is negligible .",
    "the dephasing rate due to the rabi frequency of the last dressing field , the rf or the detuned microwave driving field , can be approximated as before as @xmath108 .",
    "we can assume that the time correlation of this noise source is very long , therefore , it can be refocused using the spin - echo .    in total ,",
    "the infidelity caused by the ambient magnetic field and the fluctuations of the first and second dressing fields can be estimated as @xmath109 for the @xmath110 gate duration .",
    "this is much smaller than the fault tolerance threshold , and therefore the gate is robust to the main noise sources .",
    "high fidelity depends on good timing ( fig .",
    "[ fidelity ] ) . in this regard , techniques such as pulse shaping as were suggested by c. f. roos @xcite , and hayes et al .",
    "@xcite have been developed in order to overcome this problem . yet , these techniques can not be implemented in the proposed scheme for the microwave - based implementations , since we can not modify the amplitude of the gate operator @xmath111 ( eq . [ red2 ] ) , as these techniques require .",
    "nevertheless , microwave signals can be created using highly accurate arbitrary waveform generators which can address this timing issue .    in addition",
    ", timing depends also on the stability of the rabi frequency of the resonant microwave @xmath36 and secular frequency @xmath3 ( eq . [ agate ] ) .",
    "the fluctuations in the rabi frequency are suppressed by the second dressing fields , and as is estimated at @xcite , the motional error of should be less then @xmath112 in a @xmath110 gate duration .",
    "applying a driving field closely - detuned from the selected mode of motion coherently increases the number of phonons in the system .",
    "although the driving field is magnetically coupled to the spin , its associated electric field is coupled directly to the motion , and causes displacement of the ion motion .",
    "this interaction can be written as @xmath113 where @xmath114 and @xmath62 is the ion charge .",
    "fortunately , the detuning @xmath115 reduces these effects , and protects against excessive motional displacement . in the motion s interaction picture , the displacement becomes @xmath116 , after the rwa , when assuming @xmath117 .",
    "since the gate hamiltonian and the additional undesired displacement term have the same rotating exponents , the hamiltonian of both of them can be represented by @xmath118 where , as before , an exact time propagator exists . completing an integer number of circles in phase space results in the desired phase gate transition with a correction which can be treated by moving to the interaction picture , or by either a @xmath71-pulse or a @xmath71-phase flip after half of the gate time , as was discussed above .",
    "the real influence of the electric coupling is the number of phonons that are coherently added during the gate operation , before closing a circle in phase space .",
    "it can be easily understood in the representation of the magnus expansion .",
    "the first order of the magnus expansion ( eq . [ magnus ] ) is the displacement operator , which is maximized in half of a cycle in phase space .",
    "for example , at @xmath119 , the displacement operator is @xmath120 , where @xmath121 .",
    "if we initialize our system in the motional ground state , after @xmath119 , the motional state becomes the coherent state @xmath122 , whose average number of phonons could reach @xmath123 , if @xmath124 . if there are too many phonons in the system important assumptions such as the lamb - dicke assumption ( @xmath125 ) made in eq .",
    "[ lamb - dicke regime ] would not hold and lead to a reduction in the achievable fidelity .",
    "it is therefore advantageous to ensure that @xmath126 , such that the electric coupling can be adiabatically eliminated in the second - order perturbation approach . to fulfil the restrictions in eq .",
    "[ assumption ] ( @xmath127 ) , the ratio between the magnetic coupling and the electric coupling @xmath128 must be large .",
    "if it is not the case , and the electric field is large , a sequence of many @xmath75phase flips can be applied in order to suppress the population of high phonon states .",
    "note that this sequence can be performed even within a single cycle in phase plane @xmath76 .    in the near field regime ,",
    "the magnetic field dominates over the electric field by a factor of the wavelength divided by the size of the system .",
    "therefore , the ratio between the magnetic coupling and the electric coupling can be estimated in the following way . for a rf field of frequency @xmath129 and dimension @xmath130 ,",
    "the typical velocity of the electrons is @xmath131 where @xmath132 is the speed of light . in that case",
    "the electric term in the hamiltonian would be @xmath133 where @xmath62 is the ion charge , @xmath134 the magnetic field and @xmath135 is the standard deviation of the wave function which is of the order on @xmath136 thus , the ratio between the magnetic and the electric energy is @xmath137 by reducing the dimension of the system a better reduction factor can be achieved .",
    "it means that even in the worst case , when lacking the ability to set the polarization of the rf driving field along the axial axis , the gate could still be performed with high fidelity .",
    "in addition to the above , unwanted e - fields can be created due to the finite resistance of a coil which creates the required rf field . in order to investigate this we simulated a coil that consists of 3 turns of copper wire with a wire diameter of 6.7 mm and a coil diameter of 4 cm .",
    "the coil is placed 1 cm from the ions . to make this even more accurate",
    "we have included the two feed - lines going to the coil .",
    "the e - field along the trap axis created due to the potential drop across the coils operated at a frequency of 500 khz and a current sufficient to obtain @xmath138 khz has been found to be @xmath139 v / m , which is negligible compared to the lorentz force discussed above .",
    "adding the rotating electric field into the simulation of the gate performance , with @xmath140 , yields infidelity of @xmath141 after a single spin - echo ( fig .",
    "[ fidelity ] ) .",
    "however , assuming that the two ions have the same bare energy gap ( such that eq .",
    "[ delta ] can be dropped ) , after a sequence of @xmath142 and @xmath143 phase flips , the infidelity reduces to @xmath144 and @xmath145 respectively ( fig . [ fidelity ] ) .",
    "in our proposal we move three times to different interaction pictures , with respect to : ( 1 ) the bare energy structure @xmath146 , ( 2 ) the dressed state energy structure @xmath147 , and ( 3 ) the double dressed state energy structure @xmath148 .",
    "the way it is done in the lab is the following .",
    "the driving fields accumulate the phases corresponding to the first interaction picture with respect to the bare energy structure , namely , the system automatically moves to the first interaction picture .    as regards to moving to the second interaction picture with respect to the dressed state energy structure , at the end of the experiment ( after time @xmath149 ) , after eliminating the rf field , we operate only with the microwave dressing fields for additional time @xmath150 , during which the accumulated phase of the second interaction picture trivially vanishes , namely @xmath151 for an integer @xmath152",
    ". however , since we can not shut down the static magnetic field gradient , we have to change the microwave rabi frequency ( @xmath153 ) , such that it would be far detuned from the secular frequencies , thus adiabatically eliminating the magnetic gradient s contribution .",
    "now the condition should be @xmath154 for an integer @xmath152 .",
    "the third interaction picture with respect to the double dressed energy structure , is carried via the @xmath75phase flip of the rf driving field .",
    "until now , we have discussed the realization of the gate in a microwave - based implementation . however , with a similar derivation , our scheme could also be implemented in laser - based set - ups . dealing with lasers ,",
