    "damped  absorption systems ( dlas ) identified along the line of sight toward distant quasars offer an interesting alternative for finding distant galaxies based on their neutral gas content , rather than apparent brightness or color .",
    "despite a well - established chemical enrichment history in the dla population ( e.g.  prochaska et al.2003 ) , constraints for different star formation recipes from dla studies remain limited ( e.g.  nagamine et al .",
    "2006 ) because of a lack of known stellar counterparts . specifically , the low metal content observed in the dla population is generally interpreted as supporting evidence for an origin in the dwarf galaxy population ( e.g.  pettini et al .",
    "1994 ) , as opposed to an unbiased sample of the field galaxy population ( c.f .",
    "chen et al .",
    "2005 ) . at the same time , studies of the fine structure transitions in the si@xmath12 and c@xmath12 ions associated with dlas ( wolfe et al .",
    "2004 ) suggest that dlas may contribute equally to the star formation rate density at redshift @xmath13 as the luminous starburst population selected at rest - frame uv wavelengths ( e.g.  steidel et al .",
    "1999 ) .    the nature of dla galaxies can be determined directly from comparisons between their luminosity distribution function with those of different field populations .",
    "identifying the absorbing galaxies allows us to not only measure their intrinsic luminosity but also study the gaseous extent of distant galaxies based on the galaxy - absorber pair sample . at @xmath9 , chen &",
    "lanzetta ( 2003 ) showed that the luminosity distribution function of 11 dla galaxies is consistent with what is expected from the general galaxy population , with a peak at @xmath14 and less than 40% arising from @xmath15 galaxies .",
    "this result clearly argues against a predominant origin of the dlas in dwarf galaxies . at higher redshift",
    ", however , identifying dla galaxies becomes exceedingly difficult because of their still fainter magnitudes and small angular separation from the background quasar . to date , only six out of the @xmath16 known dlas have been uncovered in stellar emission ( see table 1 of weatherley et al .",
    ", 2005 for a summary ) .    we have initiated a multi - band imaging study of quasar fields with known intervening absorbers at @xmath17 that exhibit strong mgii , feii , and sometimes mgi absorption features and are therefore promising dla candidates ( @xmath18% likelihood ; see rao et al .  2006 ) .",
    "we have targeted our searches specifically in quasar fields that also have an intervening lyman limit system ( lls ) along the line of sight at @xmath19 . in each field , we employ the higher - redshift lls as a natural blocking filter of the background quasar light at the rest - frame ultraviolet wavelengths of the foreground dla .",
    "the complete absence of quasar light allows an unimpeded search of intervening faint galaxies along the quasar sightline to the redshift of the lls , substantially increasing the likelihood of finding the dla galaxies .",
    "the goal of our program is to collect a large sample of dla galaxies at @xmath17 for follow - up studies . in this _ letter _ , we present imaging results from two pilot fields of our project . throughout the paper ,",
    "we adopt a @xmath20 cosmology , @xmath21 and @xmath22 , with a dimensionless hubble constant @xmath23 .",
    "our survey is designed to search for dla galaxies in the absence of background quasar light .",
    "therefore , we specifically target those dla fields for which an intervening lyman limit system ( lls ) also exists along the line of sight .",
    "the concept is illustrated in figure 1 , where in the bottom panel we show the spectrum a quasar at @xmath24 .",
    "an intervening lls is present at @xmath25 , which completely absorbs the photons from the background quasar at wavelength @xmath26  .",
    "a dla is identified at @xmath4 based on the presence of strong mgii @xmath27 doublet and mgi 2852 at @xmath28   ( figure 2 ) .",
    "together with the throughput curves of typical broad - band filters , the bottom panel of figure 1 clearly indicates that the intervening lls serves as an additional blocking filter of the background quasar light in the @xmath29 band .",
    "this particular dla - lls - qso combination along a single sightline offers a unique opportunity for conducting an exhaustive search for the dla galaxy in the @xmath29 band without the interference of background quasar light . for an lls at sufficiently high redshift ( i.e.  @xmath30 ) , this design allows us to search for ultraviolet emission from dla galaxies at @xmath31 with @xmath32% contaminating quasar flux in the @xmath29 band .",
    "we caution that for the technique to be successful , either the @xmath29 filter must suppress red leak to approximately one part in @xmath33 or a red blocking filter must also be used .",
    "our absorber sample is selected based on the presence of strong metal absorption features that are indicative of dla , because the presence of the intervening lls prevents us from measuring the neutral hydrogen column density @xmath34 .",
    "specifically , a combination of strong absorption in both mgii and feii with rest - frame absorption equivalent width @xmath35   ( figure 2 ) has also been employed by rao & turnshek ( 2000 ) and further refined in rao et al .",
    "( 2005 ) for selecting dlas .",
    "we note that these strong metal - lines guarantee that the absorbers originate in either a canonical dla with @xmath36  and fe abundance @xmath37 = -1.0 $ ] ( see e.g.  prochaska et al .",
    "2003 ) or in a region with lower @xmath34 but near or greater than solar metallicity . in both scenarios ,",
    "these strong metal - line absorbers offer a means of identifying star - forming galaxies at high redshift based on the metal content in their ism , rather than their optical brightness or color .",
    "we have completed a multi - band imaging program for two pilot fields toward pks2000@xmath3330 ( @xmath38 ) and sdss0322@xmath30558 ( @xmath39 ) .",
    "properties of the intervening absorbers along these sightlines are summarized in columns ( 3 ) through ( 6 ) of table 1 .",
    "absorption - line profiles of metal transitions identified with the candidate dlas are presented in figure 2 .",
    "the spectrum of pks2000@xmath3330 was obtained using the mike echelle spectrograph ( bernstein et al .",
    "2003 ) on the 6.5 m magellan clay telescope at las campanas observatory .",
    "in addition to the prominent lls found at @xmath40 ( figure 1 ) , a candidate dla is found at @xmath41 based on the presence of mgi , mgii and feii .",
    "the presence of mgi indicates that the metal - line transitions trace neutral gas and therefore provides further support for a dla nature of this absorber .",
    "the spectrum of sdss0322@xmath30558 was retrieved from the sdss data archive .",
    "in addition to an lls found at @xmath42 in the sdss quasar spectrum , a candidate dla is found at @xmath43 based on detections of both strong mgii and feii .",
    "because of the low resolution of sdss coupled with poor signal to noise in this particular spectrum , we were unable to observe other metal line transitions .",
    "optical imaging observations of the two quasar fields were carried out using the magic direct imager on the magellan clay telescope with the @xmath29 , @xmath44 , and @xmath45 filters .",
    "the optical imaging data presented in this paper were obtained separately in three different runs in august , september , and october of 2005 .",
    "all these images were taken under photometric conditions with an exquisite mean seeing of 0.6 , 0.5 , and 0.7  in the @xmath29 , @xmath44 , and @xmath45 bands , respectively .",
    "object photometry was calibrated using landolt standards ( landolt 1992 ) observed on the same nights as the science frames .",
    "optical @xmath29 , @xmath44 , and @xmath45 images of the field around sdss0322@xmath30558 were obtained in september 2005 through cirrus , and object photometry was calibrated using common sources identified in the sdss field .",
    "the mean seeing in the final stacked @xmath29 , @xmath44 , and @xmath45 images are respectively 0.8 , 0.7 , and 0.7 .",
    "near - infrared images of the field around sdss0322@xmath30558 were also obtained in october 2005 , using persson s auxiliary nasmyth infrared camera ( panic ; martini et al .",
    "2004 ) on the magellan baade telescope with the @xmath46 filter .",
    "the images were taken under photometric conditions with a mean seeing of 0.4 .",
    "object photometry was calibrated using several persson infrared standards ( persson et al .",
    "1998 ) observed on the same nights of the science frames .",
    "all imaging data were processed using standard pipeline techniques .",
    "the processed individual images were registered to a common origin , filtered for deviant pixels , and stacked to formed a final combined image using our own program . for each field , we detect objects separately in the @xmath29 and @xmath44 frames due to the absence and presence of the background quasar in these two bandpasses , using the sextractor program ( bertin & arnout 1996 ) .",
    "a segmentation map is produced that defines the sizes and shapes of all the objects found in the stacked images .",
    "object fluxes were measured by summing up all the photons in the corresponding apertures in the segmentation map .",
    "flux uncertainties were estimated from the mean variance over the neighboring sky pixels . the dominant error in object",
    "photometry is , however , in the photometric zero - point calibration .",
    "we estimate uncertainties in optical and near - infrared photometry are 0.1 mag and 0.05 mag , respectively .",
    "the results for pks2000@xmath3330 and sdss0322@xmath30558 are presented in figures 1 and 3 .",
    "galaxies identified at angular distance @xmath47 are summarized in columns ( 7 ) through ( 12 ) of table 1 .    in the field of pks2000@xmath3330 , two extended sources , @xmath48 and @xmath49 ,",
    "are found close to the sightline and above the @xmath50 limiting magnitude @xmath51 over a 1-diameter aperture .",
    "both @xmath48 and @xmath49 have similar @xmath29-band brightness @xmath52 and @xmath53 color , @xmath54 .",
    "object @xmath48 is located at 2.8from the sightline , not resolved from the quasar in the @xmath45-band image , and object @xmath49 is located at 4.7  from the sightline .",
    "we note that galaxies @xmath48 and @xmath49 are not likely associated with the strong lls at @xmath55 that produces the strong absorption feature at @xmath56  , because at @xmath57 nearly all the photons at @xmath58 ( rest - frame 912  ) are absorbed and the abundant fluxes observed in the @xmath29-band would imply an enormous ultraviolet flux intrinsic to these galaxies .",
    "figure 4 shows that the observed colors of galaxy @xmath49 are consistent with star - forming galaxies at @xmath59 ( adelberger et al .",
    "we therefore consider galaxy @xmath49 ( and possibly @xmath48 ) as the dla galaxy at @xmath4 and the @xmath45-band magnitude of @xmath49 indicates that it is nearly an @xmath6 galaxy ( c.f .",
    "@xmath60 for @xmath13 galaxies in adelberger & steidel 2000 ) . at @xmath4 ,",
    "the corresponding impact parameter of @xmath48 and @xmath49 is @xmath61 kpc and @xmath62 kpc , respectively .    in the field of sdss0322@xmath30558",
    ", we identify a single compact source @xmath49 at @xmath63 to the quasar with @xmath64 , and no other sources brighter than the @xmath50 limiting magnitude @xmath65 in the @xmath29-band . in figure 4 , we show that this object has observed colors consistent with star - forming galaxies at @xmath59 .",
    "we therefore consider this object the most likely candidate for the dla at @xmath5 . at @xmath66 ,",
    "the galaxy is at @xmath67 kpc and its @xmath46-band magnitude also indicates a nearly @xmath6 galaxy ( e.g.  chen et al .",
    "2003 ) .",
    "we have shown that in the absence of quasar light the @xmath29-band image of each field offers an unimpeded view along the line of sight to the redshift of the lls , allowing a complete search of the dla galaxy to the sensitivity limit of the imaging data .",
    "the consistent optical colors of these candidate galaxies summarized in table 1 strongly support their identification as the absorbing galaxies , despite a lack of redshift measurements .",
    "we note that the sensitivity of the @xmath29-band images allows us to uncover galaxies fainter than @xmath6 ( @xmath68 in pks2000@xmath3330 and @xmath69 in sdss0322@xmath30558 ) at the redshift of the dla , but no fainter galaxies are found .",
    "our identification is further strengthened by the number of random galaxies we expect to find within the small angular radius from the quasar along the quasar sightline . adopting a nominal galaxy luminosity function from ellis et al .",
    "( 1996 ) , we expect to find @xmath70 galaxies with @xmath71 within @xmath72 over the redshift interval @xmath73 .",
    "our survey results based on two mgii - selected dlas at @xmath74 agree with previous studies at @xmath9 in that strong mgii absorbers are commonly found to arise in typical @xmath6 galaxies ( bergeron 1986 ; steidel et al .",
    "their intrinsic luminosities are also comparable to the few dla galaxies known at @xmath75 ( mller et al.2002 ) .",
    "this is , however , at odds with the null results reported by colbert & malkan ( 2002 ) and with recent work by rao et al .",
    "( 2003 ) , who argued that strong mgii - selected dlas at @xmath9 most likely originate in @xmath76 dwarf galaxies . using the two galaxy - absorber pairs established in our pilot study",
    ", we also find that the @xmath77 versus @xmath78 distribution at @xmath79 is qualitatively consistent with the anti - correlation observed at @xmath9 ( lanzetta & bowen 1990 ; churchill et al .",
    "the agreement suggests that the size of extended mgii gas around luminous galaxies has not evolved significantly since @xmath80 .",
    "a larger sample is necessary for investigating the extent of neutral gas in high - redshift galaxies , as well as for a statistical comparison between the luminosity distribution of the dla galaxies and that of the field galaxy population .",
