    "detections of x - ray inverse - compton emission from components of radio galaxies have the potential to resolve long - standing questions about their particle content and magnetic field strength , because they allow direct measurements of electron energy density , unlike observations of radio synchrotron emission , where the electron density and magnetic field strength can not be decoupled .",
    "this technique has been successfully used to measure magnetic field strengths in the hotspots and lobes of frii @xcite radio galaxies and quasars .",
    "measurements of the internal energy density in relativistic electrons obtained from x - ray lobe detections can be used to constrain source dynamics and particle content by allowing a comparison of the internal pressure with the external pressure from x - ray - emitting hot gas ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "this is particularly important in view of the continuing uncertainty about the dynamical status and confinement of frii lobes @xcite .",
    "there are several possible sources of photons to be inverse - compton scattered up to x - ray energies by the radio - synchrotron - emitting electron population . in hotspots , where the electron density is high ,",
    "the dominant photon population comes from the radio emission itself ; this is the synchrotron - self compton process @xcite .",
    "however , in the lobes the density of synchrotron photons is much lower , so that the photon energy density from the cosmic microwave background typically dominates over that from the radio synchrotron emission .",
    "in addition , the photon field from the nuclear source may be important in some sources @xcite .",
    "_ chandra _ and _ xmm - newton _ have allowed a number of detections of x - ray emission from lobes to be made . in many sources the lobes",
    "have been claimed to be near to equipartition ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) whereas in others significant electron dominance is claimed ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "however , the results are dependent on the assumed electron energy spectrum and photon population characteristics .",
    "the unknown properties of the electron population at energies below those observable in the radio also introduce considerable uncertainty ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "differences in the methods used to separate thermal and non - thermal x - ray emission , and in the calculations of inverse - compton emissivity can also be important , so that estimates from different authors are often not directly comparable . as",
    "yet there is no overall picture of the magnetic field properties of the frii population .",
    "the particle content in radio galaxies and quasars has been the subject of debate over several decades .",
    "there are arguments in favor of electron - proton jets , principally based on energy transport close to the active nucleus ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) ; however , several independent arguments favor electron - positron jets ( e.g * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "inverse - compton studies can provide indirect information on the particle content on the large scale : although relativistic protons are not directly observable by this process , inverse - compton observations that are consistent with equipartition between the magnetic field and electron energy densities make it difficult to accommodate an energetically dominant population of protons in the lobes .",
    "@xcite have already used this argument to suggest that hotspot energetics are not dominated by protons , and @xcite and @xcite have applied it to individual frii lobes ; extending it to frii lobes in general would be of considerable interest .",
    "in this paper we use the _ chandra _ archives ( together with some _ xmm - newton _ data ) to compile a large sample of frii radio galaxies and quasars with which to investigate the inverse - compton properties of lobes .",
    "our approach differs from that of @xcite in that we do not only select sources with known hotspot , jet or lobe emission , but include sources whose extended components have not previously been detected in x - rays : this allows us to consider limits on the magnetic field strength , and gives us a much larger sample ( as well as allowing us to make some new lobe detections ) . in section  [ sec : stat ] , we compare our results with theirs . throughout the paper",
    "we use a cosmology in which @xmath4 km s@xmath5 mpc@xmath5 , @xmath6 and @xmath7 .",
    "spectral indices @xmath8 are the energy indices and are defined in the sense @xmath9 .",
    "the sample was compiled from the list of 3c frii radio sources for which public _",
    "observations existed as of early 2004 , which comprises 36 objects @xcite .",
    "we also included 4 _ xmm - newton _ observations of 3c radio galaxies for which detailed analysis of lobe - related emission has previously been carried out @xcite .",
    "this gave a total sample size of 40 objects , which span a redshift range of @xmath10 . in table",

    "the broad - line objects nearly all have @xmath160 , whereas the narrow - line objects mainly have @xmath161 .",
    "the median values of the samples are 2.1 ( narrow - line ) and 3.1 ( broad - line ) .",
    "a median test rejects the hypothesis that the two subsamples have the same median with @xmath162 percent probability .",

    "since we have not taken projection effects into account , this means that for most sources we have underestimated the source volume and therefore @xmath165 , so that @xmath147 for a given source will be likely to be overestimated",
    ". the effect will be at its most severe for the broad - line radio galaxies and quasars , thought to be within 45 degrees of the line - of - sight , where the volumes will have been significantly underestimated .",
    "if we assume that the population of narrow - line radio galaxies occupies all angles between @xmath159 and the plane of the sky with equal probability , then the most probable angle at which to observe a narrow - line radio galaxy is at @xmath158 degrees , where @xmath147 will be overestimated by a factor of @xmath166 , assuming that volume scales as @xmath167 , where @xmath167 is the observed lobe length .",

    "we compared the simulated distribution of @xmath176 to the observed distribution using a k - s test , and found that the intrinsic values for @xmath173 and @xmath12 that give the best match to the observed data are 2.5 and 1.15 , respectively .",
    "we next tested whether the observed distributions of @xmath147 for the narrow - line and broad - line objects could separately be explained by this intrinsic distribution .",
    "we find that the broad - line objects have a @xmath177 percent probability of being drawn from a parent population having this intrinsic distribution ; however , the narrow - line objects have only a @xmath178 percent chance of being drawn from such a population .",
    "the intrinsic distribution that gives the best fit to the narrow - line objects alone has @xmath179 and @xmath180 ( observed @xmath147 for the narrow - line and broad - line subsamples are @xmath181 and @xmath182 , respectively ) .",
    "we therefore conclude that projection is likely to be important in explaining the distribution of observed @xmath147 values ; however , some additional explanation may be needed to explain the differences between the narrow - line and broad - line objects .",
    "we note , however , that the _ actual _ distribution of inclination angles in this sample is unknown ; it is clear from the fact that it contains roughly equal numbers of narrow and broad - line objects that the probability distribution of line - of - sight angle we used for the simulation does not accurately represent the actual distribution in our sample .",
    "it is also possible that the high redshift quasars ( which often have high @xmath147 values ) may be biased towards small angles to the line of sight , since the radio flux observed at 178-mhz in the highest redshift objects may have contributions from beamed components ( although this will also reduce the intrinsic radio flux , which will act in the opposite direction to raise the observed value of @xmath147 ) .",
    "another possibility is that the systematic uncertainties in the x - ray analysis may be worse for the quasars , as contamination from the bright central source will be harder to remove ; this could be compounded by the fact that the quasars are typically more distant and so have smaller angular sizes ( although we find no correlation between @xmath147 and angular size ) .",

    "they conclude that inverse - compton emission with an equipartition magnetic field is the best model for lobe x - ray emission for their smaller sample , in good agreement with our results .",
    "together with the work we present here , these results provide strong support for the argument that frii radio lobes are near to equipartition .    to summarize , we find that detectable x - ray emission from the lobes of frii radio galaxies and quasars is common , that it is due predominantly to ic scattering of cmb photons , and that most frii sources are close to equipartition , with the energy densities perhaps being electron - dominated by a factor of a few . in the next sections , we discuss reliability issues , and alternative explanations of our results .",
    "as discussed in appendix  [ comp ] , our conclusions in several cases differ significantly from the work of previous authors .",
    "it is extremely difficult to obtain a correct flux measurement for lobe - related x - ray emission , because the best choice of extraction regions is sometimes uncertain .",
    "it is difficult to avoid agn contamination , particularly when the radio - lobe emission lies close to the core , and it is also important to exclude any contribution from a hot - gas atmosphere . we have carefully chosen our background regions to be at the same distance from the nucleus as the source regions , although in two cases ( 3c200 and 3c452 ) this was not possible because the radio - related x - ray emission surrounds the core .",
    "we believe that it is the difficulty of correctly separating the different components of the x - ray emission that has led to discrepant results in the literature .",
    "it is extremely unlikely that any of our flux measurements are _ under_-estimates of the lobe ic emission , so that any systematic uncertainty in the @xmath147 values is likely to be in the direction of overestimation . as mentioned in section  [ sec : stat ] , overestimation of @xmath147 values may be a particular problem for some of the quasars with strong agn and small angular sizes .      as mentioned in section",
    "[ intro ] , the properties of the low - energy electron population in the radio lobes are not well constrained , largely due to the lack of instruments capable of measuring the sycnhrotron emission from this population .",
    "this is particularly problematic when studying the ic / cmb process , as it is the low - energy electrons that scatter the cmb to x - ray energies .",
    "since we can not use observations to constrain directly the electron energy distribution below 178 mhz for our sample , it is necessary to assume a low - frequency spectral index , @xmath99 , and cutoff energy , @xmath107 . for this work",
    ", we assumed that at low energies , the electron population has an energy index @xmath210 , which corresponds to the prediction from shock acceleration .",
    "this prediction is supported by observations of hotspots ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which have the low - frequency spectral index predicted by the models .",
    "we therefore assume that the electron population in the lobes has been shock - accelerated while passing through the hotspots , resulting in an initial energy distribution with @xmath210 ( corresponding to a spectral index @xmath211 ) .",
    "spectral ageing has then steepened the spectrum at observable frequencies to the observed values of 0.5  1.0 .",
    "our modelled energy distribution ( section  [ sec : synchmod ] ) is therefore a power - law of index 2 at low energies , with a break to a steeper slope in the observable radio region .",
    "we also chose to use @xmath212 , motivated partly by observations of @xmath213 in hotspots ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * )  we would expect a lower @xmath107 in lobes due to the effects of adiabatic expansion  and partly to be conservative .",
    "we believe that , given the lack of knowledge about this electron population , our chosen electron energy distribution is physically plausible ; however , it is important to consider the effects of varying @xmath99 and @xmath107 , particularly since the measured x - ray spectral index for those sources where a spectral model could be fitted is steeper than 0.5 in a few cases .",
    "we first tested the effects of varying @xmath107 for several of our sources , covering a range of @xmath147 values .",
    "if we adopt @xmath214 , corresponding to the lower limit of observed radio emission from lobes , we find new @xmath147 values that do not differ from the quoted values ( table  [ icresults ] ) for @xmath100 within the 1@xmath12 errors .",
    "the reason that the prediction for x - ray inverse - compton emission does not change significantly is that , while the reduced energy range decreases the electron density , the normalization of the electron energy spectrum increases in order to maintain equipartition .",
    "we next tested the effect of varying @xmath99 .",
    "an alternative approach to our method is to assume that the electron energy index implied by the low - frequency radio spectral index can be extrapolated back to @xmath107 .",
    "we tested the effect of this assumption , using the 3crr spectral index @xmath8 measured between 178 mhz and 750 mhz ( tabulated in table  [ lobe_sample ] ) , which are always greater than 0.5 , for several of our sources , using @xmath212 and assuming @xmath215 and including a break or high - energy cutoff in the spectrum as needed to fit to the radio spectrum , as in our main analysis .",
    "we found that for all of the sources this resulted in a _",
    "prediction for the x - ray inverse - compton flux , increasing the @xmath147 values by a factor of @xmath216 .",
    "the reason for the lower ic prediction in this case is that the equipartition requirement causes the electron energy spectrum normalization to be lowered with respect to the @xmath210 calculation because of the large contribution to the electron energy density made by the additional low - energy electrons .",
    "if we adopt @xmath214 for this analysis , the electron normalization increases again , because of the reduced energy range , so that the resulting @xmath147 values are again roughly consistent with those in table  [ icresults ] .",
    "we therefore conclude that uncertainty in the distribution of electrons at low energies introduces at most a factor of 2 uncertainty into our quoted @xmath147 values .",
    "this corresponds to a factor of 0.7 in @xmath152 and 4 in @xmath151 .",
    "our analysis for 3c265 in section  [ sec:3c265 ] and for 3c284 @xcite , as well as the analysis of @xcite for 3c184 , shows that ic scattering of the photon field from a hidden quasar does not appear to be the dominant x - ray emission mechanism in these sources . as mentioned in section",
    "[ sec:3c265 ] , the x - ray emission from the ic / nuclear process would be brightest towards the nucleus and decrease rapidly with radius ; this is not the morphology that is observed .",
    "in contrast , the x - ray emission from cmb ic is expected to follow closely the structure of the low - frequency radio emission , which appears to be the case for those sources where the signal - to - noise is sufficiently high to observe the spatial distribution of emission .",
    "our calculations for ic / nuclear ( section  [ sec:3c265 ] ) , in contrast to the work of other authors , assume that the incident photon field is emitting isotropically .",
    "the justification for this assumption comes from observations of the infrared emission from narrow - line and broad - line objects which show that the infrared properties of the two types of object are the same @xcite .",
    "ic / nuclear emission may be important in some sources in this sample , and may help explain the different distributions of narrow - line and broad - line objects .",
    "3c207 @xcite may be an example where this process is important .",
    "however , we have shown that cmb ic with a near equipartition magnetic field can account for the majority of the observed x - ray emission in most narrow - line radio galaxies ( and , if projection is taken into account , in many broad - line and objects as well ) ; we conclude that in most cases ic / nuclear is not the dominant process .",
    "as discussed in the context of our observations of 3c223 and 3c284 @xcite , it is also possible that there is hot , shocked gas surrounding the radio lobes of some sources .",
    "the emission from such gas could be mistaken for ic emission , as it is difficult to distinguish spectrally between these models due to the small number of counts from most of the lobes . however , in the cases where spectral fitting could be performed , a thermal model was usually a significantly poorer fit to the data . as mentioned above",
    ", the lack of a correlation between @xmath147 and redshift also suggests that the emission is not dominated by such shocked gas , which would be difficult to detect at high redshifts ( based on the assumption that most friis reside in groups , as found by @xcite , and assuming a typical group luminosity of @xmath217 erg s@xmath5 ) .",
    "in addition , many of the sources have radio morphologies similar to 3c223 and 3c284 @xcite , for which we argue that highly supersonic expansion is unlikely",
    ". these arguments do not rule out some contribution from hot gas .",
    "however , the results from 3c452 , where a two - component model could be fitted , show that it is not possible to explain all of the excess x - ray emission above the equipartition prediction by contamination from thermal emission .    as an additional test",
    ", we can compare the expected luminosity of shock - heated gas with the observed luminosity in sources where some estimate of the physical conditions in the external medium has been made .",
    "we assume a shock - heated shell surrounding the entire lobe .",
    "the temperature of the shock - heated gas is unknown , though the evidence from spectral fits , where these are possible , is that it must be high ( @xmath218 kev ) .",
    "fortunately _ chandra _ s response to gas hotter than a few kev is only weakly sensitive to temperature , so this does not restrict our ability to carry out these calculations .",
    "we make the assumption that the shock - heated material is gas swept up in the radio lobe s expansion , compressed by some compression factor @xmath219 : then if the number of particles swept up by the lobe is @xmath220 , and the lobe s volume is @xmath221 , the mean density of particles in the shell is @xmath222 .",
    "assuming uniform density , the luminosity from the shocked shell is @xmath223 , where @xmath224 is a constant ( depending on the luminosity band of interest , the metal abundance of the shocked material , and , weakly , on its temperature ) . the compression factor is unknown , but given the close match of the detected x - rays to the shape of the radio - emitting lobes , must be significantly greater than 1 : application of standard jump conditions would give @xmath225 , while the observed shock around the southern lobe of cen a @xcite corresponds to @xmath226 .",
    "we have calculated the expected luminosity for shocked shells in several sources for which we have estimates of the group / cluster parameters ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "in general we find that the expected luminosity for @xmath227 exceeds the observed luminosity of the lobes ; what we observe is too faint to be compressed , swept - up gas .",
    "( the exceptions to this rule are sources that are found to lie in reasonably rich environments : for example , @xmath225 is allowed by the data for 3c263 . )",
    "while the results are uncertain because the physical parameters of the environments are poorly constrained , we consider the general incompatibility of this simple model with the observations to be an additional argument against the picture in which the lobe - related x - rays are due to shock - heated thermal material . if supersonic expansion occurred in a small region of the lobe , e.g. , around a hotspot , then the expected luminosity from the shocked gas would be lower , and could be compatible with the observations .",
    "however , in the largest sources with high signal - to - noise detections ( e.g. , 3c452 ) , the x - ray emission is not localized in this way , and any emission from shock - heated gas close to hotspots will have been excluded from our analysis . we therefore conclude that this scenario is probably unimportant for the majority of sources in the sample , although it could contribute in some high @xmath147 sources where the data quality is insufficient to rule out localized shock heating .",
    "if the lobes of frii sources contained an energetically dominant population of relativistic protons ( with a high ratio of @xmath228 ) , and the energy densities in magnetic field and _ particles _ were similar , then @xmath147 would be expected to be typically less than unity .",
    "our results therefore rule out a model where frii radio lobes have an energetically important proton population and are at equipartition .",
    "it is not possible to rule out directly a model in which radio lobes are highly particle - dominated , i.e. , where there is an energetically important population of protons giving a total energy density in particles that is an order of magnitude or more higher than that in the magnetic field .",
    "however , such a model can not explain why the measured magnetic field strengths are always close to the value for equipartition between relativistic _ electrons _ and magnetic field , unless the mechanism for achieving equipartition requires timescales longer than the lobe lifetimes for protons but not electrons .",
    "the results of our survey of frii radio lobes support the conclusions of our earlier papers on smaller samples of sources @xcite : the presence of an energetically dominant population of protons is unlikely , because it requires that the magnetic field energy density tends to be similar to the electron energy density rather than the conjectured overall energy density in relativistic particles .",
    "our study of the x - ray emission from the lobes of frii radio galaxies and quasars has shown that they can be magnetically dominated by at least a factor of 2 ; however , @xmath229 percent of the sample are at equipartition or electron dominated .",
    "there is a reasonably narrow distribution of @xmath147 values , where @xmath147 is the ratio of observed to predicted emission from cmb ic from synchrotron - emitting electrons at equipartition .",
    "the distribution peaks at @xmath156 , which corresponds to magnetic field strengths within 35 percent of the equipartition value , or electron dominance ( @xmath151 ) by a factor of @xmath230 . that the distribution is narrow and close to the expectation for equipartition between relativistic electrons and magnetic field shows that an energetically dominant proton population in frii radio sources is unlikely .",
    "the distribution of apparent @xmath147 values differs for narrow - line radio galaxies and broad - line objects ( broad - line radio galaxies and quasars ) ; this is due in part to projection effects , but may also be caused by worse systematic uncertainties for more distant objects .",
    "we argue that ic scattering of infrared and optical photons from the nucleus is unlikely to be the dominant x - ray emission process in the majority of radio galaxies and quasars , although it may play some rle in smaller objects .",

    "[ lobes1 ] ) excludes higher energy background counts included in their image ( which used a larger energy range ) , and shows clearly an excess of counts associated with both lobes .",

    "they argue that the choice of background region is not important as the _ chandra _ background is extremely low ; this suggests that they have not subtracted off the component of background from the wings of the psf , which is important , as can be seen from their smoothed image .",
    "they list several reasons why they believe that ic scattering of the cmb is not the dominant process .",
    "they argue that no emission is seen from the western lobe , which is of similar radio luminosity and size to the eastern one ; however , as the source is of small angular size , and the western lobe is dominated by jet emission , it is not possible to obtain a strong upper limit on its lobe - related x - ray emission , particularly in the presence of high background due to agn emission .",
    "brunetti et al .",
    "argue that the x - ray spectral index is flatter than the radio spectral index ; however , firstly there do not appear to be sufficient counts to constrain the spectral index , and secondly they consider only the high frequency spectral index , whereas it is lower energy electrons that will scatter the cmb and the nuclear emission .",
    "we obtained an @xmath147 value of 3 for the western lobe of 3c207 ( the intrinsic value may be lower due to projection , see above ) .",
    "it is therefore possible that some contribution to the x - ray flux comes from the ic / nuclear process as argued by @xcite , but it appears that cmb ic can explain a significant fraction of the observed emission if the lobe is near equipartition , or all of the x - rays if the lobe is modestly electron - dominated or at a small angle to the line of sight",
    ".      @xcite present the _",
    "observation of 3c219 and attribute the lobe - related emission to inverse - compton scattering of the cmb and nuclear agn photons .",
    "our spectral results for the northern lobe are consistent with the values they obtain for the entire source . however , their quoted flux is approximately twice our measured total flux from both lobes .",
    "this is probably due to their choice of spectral extraction region , which does not exclude the jet or nothern hotspot regions .",
    "additionally , they do not specify their choice of background region : if it is off - axis , then their spectrum could contain significant agn contamination .",
    "we obtain a comparable flux to their measured value if we use a large elliptical extraction region that includes the jet and northern hotspot , and use an off - source background region .",
    "we believe that our choice of extraction regions is preferable , as our regions follow the radio structure more closely , and because our background region , at the same distance from the core as the source regions , will remove contamination from the agn and hot - gas environment .",
    "therefore , we disagree with their conclusions that the lobes are electron - dominated by up to a factor of 100 , and find that this factor is more than an order of magnitude lower .",
    "@xcite present the results of an analysis of the _ chandra _ observation of 3c265 .",
    "they interpret the origin of the x - ray emission as ic scattering of agn photons ; however , our results show that cmb and ssc ic emission in an equipartition field can account for @xmath231 of the observed x - ray emission .",
    "it is nevertheless possible that ic / nuclear scattering makes a significant contribution to the flux from the eastern lobe , thought to be pointing away from us . to test this",
    ", we carried out similar calculations for this source to those for the eastern lobe of 3c284 presented by @xcite .    to model the illuminating flux",
    ", we used the infrared measurements ( at 4.5 , 6.7 and 12.0 @xmath98 m ) for 3c265 of @xcite , extrapolating to a frequency range of @xmath232 to @xmath233 hz .",
    "in order to model the shape of the spectrum at lower frequencies , we scaled the lower frequency spectrum for 3c295 @xcite to a value appropriate for the normalization of 3c265 s infrared spectrum .",
    "we used the same parameters for the electron energy spectrum as in the analysis of section  [ sec : synchmod ] , with @xmath107 of 10 , so that the predicted flux is an upper limit on the contribution from ic / nuclear .",
    "we find that the contribution to the predicted 1-kev flux density from ic scattering of this photon field to be less than 0.03 njy for all choices of inclination angle . therefore ,",
    "if the infrared emission is isotropic , this process can not account for the observed flux level . in order to produce the additional x - ray flux ( the observed excess of 1.7 njy above the cmb ic prediction ; see table  [ icresults ] ) , the luminosity of the quasar as seen by the lobes would have to be @xmath234 times more luminous than the isotropic luminosity , so that a beam of small opening angle would be required .",
    "this more luminous photon field , if symmetric on each side of the source , would also produce a significant flux from the western radio lobe ( e.g. , @xmath235 njy for the most probable angle of @xmath236 ) , so that ic / nuclear scattering in an equipartition magnetic field can not explain the observed fluxes .",
    "another argument against illumination from a narrow cone of infrared emission is the lack of evidence for differences in the infrared properties of narrow - line and broad line radio galaxies @xcite .",
    "finally , the ic / nuclear model predicts a steep decrease in the x - ray flux with distance from the nucleus ; this is not seen in the x - ray data .",
    "the asymmetry in x - ray - to - radio flux is therefore more plausibly explained by a difference in the relative magnetic field strength of the two lobes , perhaps due to their different sizes .",
    "there are several differences between our method and that of bondi et al . , which may explain our different conclusions as to the dominant photon population .",
    "our x - ray observational measurements appear to be in reasonable agreement ; however , from our l - band radio map we measure a much smaller flux ratio between the two lobes than that quoted by bondi et al .",
    "( a ratio of 2.7 between the east and west lobes ) .",
    "we also use a concordance model cosmology , whereas bondi et al . use a value of @xmath237 ; this has a significant effect on the volumes and the cmb energy density .",
    "the different radio measurements and cosmology may explain why our value for the equipartition magnetic field ( 2.4 nt ) is a factor of two below theirs .",
    "we used an illuminating spectrum based directly on the infrared measurements of @xcite for 3c265 , which gives an integrated luminosity just below the lower limit of the range quoted by bondi et al .",
    "in contrast , they use a value close to the upper limit of their quoted range .",
    "finally , we assumed that the illuminating source is isotropic , as supported by arguments from unified models ( see above ) .",
    "we believe our choice of cosmology is more appropriate , and our parametrization of the illuminating source is based directly on infrared measurements , and so we conclude that , in contrast to the findings of bondi et al . , ic from cmb photons in a near - equipartition field ( @xmath238 ) can explain the observed x - ray flux , and that the contribution from ic / nuclear is not dominant in this source .",
    "@xcite presented the _ chandra _ observation of 3c281 and attributed the extended x - ray emission to the northern hotspot and environment .",
