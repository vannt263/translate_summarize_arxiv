    "ultra - cold atoms in optical lattices nowadays represent a perfect laboratory system for the quantitative study of various condensed - matter models .",
    "in addition to offering an extremely high degree of experimental control and reproducibility , such systems have shown to provide a very useful theoretical testing ground for the quantum modeling of strongly correlated many - body systems . perhaps the most simple and fecund of such applications is given by the dynamics of double - well bose - einstein condensates @xcite , which has been extensively studied in recent years @xcite .",
    "in particular , for high enough barriers , a simple two - mode model hamiltonian describing josephson - oscillations and quantum self - trapping phenomena , has been analyzed by different authors @xcite , and later improved to better introduce interparticle interaction effects @xcite . on the other hand , the associated dynamics has been experimentally observed a few years ago @xcite .    in the last years",
    ", this research work has been extended to multiple well condensates motivated by the possibility of generating and manipulating vortex states . in a recent experiment , scherer _",
    "_ @xcite have reported observations of vortex formation by merging and interfering multiple bose - einstein condensates in a confining potential . in their experiment ,",
    "a single harmonic potential well was partitioned into three sections by barriers forming three independent bose - einstein condensates , which had no coherence between the respective phases . by removing the barriers",
    ", the condensates merged together and it has been shown that , depending on the unknown initial relative phases , the final state could acquire vorticity .",
    "the authors have observed single vortex states even after five seconds following the barrier ramp - down , indicating relatively long single vortex lifetimes .",
    "this experiment stimulated theoretical investigation as regards the maximum winding number a condensate in a ring - shaped lattice could sustain , depending on the trap properties , particularly , on the barrier height between wells .",
    "for example , in the case of large barrier heights , the problem of vortex trapping in cyclically coupled bose - josephson junctions has been recently addressed by ghosh and sols @xcite .",
    "they coupled initially independent bose - einstein condensates through josephson links and allowed the system to reach a stable circulation by adding a dissipative term in semiclassical equations of motion .",
    "in addition , the authors analyzed the probability of trapping a vortex with a given winding number , finding that a necessary condition to obtain a metastable nonzero circulation consists of generating a winding number smaller than a quarter of the total number of linked condensates .",
    "a different approach was utilized by prez - garca _ et al . _",
    "@xcite , which by means of group - theoretical methods , studied charge inversion and vortex erasing in condensates confined by traps with discrete symmetries @xcite .",
    "they have predicted the existence of stationary states up to a winding number which depends on the order of the symmetry . on the other hand ,",
    "the case of a continuous symmetry , represented by nonrotating ring shaped traps , has attracted renewed theoretical attention in connection with the existence of vortex states , due to recent experimental observations of persistent currents in multiple connected condensates @xcite .",
    "in particular , by computing the energy landscape , capuzzi _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite have shown that multiply quantized vortices and multivortex configurations can be locally energetically stable in a toroidal trap .    the aim of this work is to study vortex states in a ring - shaped optical lattice with variable barrier heights .",
    "this will allow us to explore the transition between the limit of low barrier heights , where large persistent currents are expected , and the high - barrier limit , where josephson - type links should rule the vortex configurations .",
    "for such purpose we will consider a condensate confined by superposition of a toroidal trap and equally spaced radial barriers forming a ring of @xmath0 linked condensates .",
    "in particular , we will investigate the energy and angular momentum dependence on the winding number for a wide range of barrier heights .",
    "such a system could be experimentally investigated , as it corresponds to a relatively simple combination of previously implemented experimental settings @xcite .",
    "actually , new techniques have been recently developed by henderson _",
    "@xcite to create and manipulate condensates in a variety of geometries , including the present type of ring lattices .",

    "we consider a bose - einstein condensate of rubidium atoms confined by an external trap @xmath1 , consisting of a superposition of a toroidal term @xmath2 and a lattice potential @xmath3 formed by radial barriers .",
    "similarly to the trap utilized in recent experiments @xcite , the toroidal trapping potential in cylindrical coordinates reads , @xmath4 +    v_0 \\ , \\exp ( -2 \\ , r^2/\\;\\lambda_0 ^ 2)\\ ] ] where @xmath5 and @xmath6 denote the radial and axial frequencies , respectively .",
    "we have set @xmath7 to suppress excitation in the @xmath8 direction .",
    "in particular , we have chosen @xmath9 hz and @xmath10 hz , while for the laser beam we have set @xmath11 and @xmath12 , with @xmath13 .",
    "on the other hand , the lattice potential formed by @xmath0 gaussian barriers located at equally spaced angular positions @xmath14 ( @xmath15 ) may be written , @xmath16 ^ 2 } { \\lambda_b^2}\\right\\}\\ ] ] for @xmath17 even .",
    "although , for simplicity the numerical simulations of this work have been restricted to the case of an even number of lattice sites , most of our findings can be easily shown to be valid irrespective of the parity of @xmath17 .",
    "we have fixed the trap parameters at @xmath18 and @xmath19 .",
    "the combination of these potentials gives rise to effective barriers between neighboring sites , as represented in fig .",
    "[ potenr ] .     with @xmath20 .",
    "right panel : effective potential barrier @xmath21 along the positive @xmath22 axis for several values of the parameter @xmath23 . ]",
    "the thomas - fermi ( tf ) approximation , will allow us to deduce some general features of the condensate from the characteristics of the trapping potential . to this aim",
    ", we will take into account that the tf - density vanishes at points fulfilling @xmath24 , @xmath25 being the chemical potential .",
    "on the one hand , around the trap center we can approximate @xmath26 and , as we restrict our calculations to chemical potentials smaller than @xmath27 , the condensate center will always exhibit a hole . on the other hand , between neighboring sites we have that the potential minimum shown in the right panel of fig .",
    "[ potenr ] , which corresponds to the saddle point in two dimensions , turns out to be located around @xmath28 , and the barrier height can be approximated as @xmath29 .",
    "notice that we have retained in this estimate only the @xmath30 term of the sum in @xmath3 , as the exponent of such a term vanishes , while the contributions of the remaining gaussian terms are negligible .",
    "thus , when the chemical potential becomes smaller than this potential minimum , the tf - density between neighboring sites vanishes .",
    "since the trapping potential is much stronger along the @xmath8 axis , the motion of the particles in the @xmath8 direction remains frozen in the ground state , and the energy per particle in the condensate is then given by the two - dimensional ( 2d ) energy functional @xcite @xmath31   = \\int \\left ( \\frac { \\hbar^2 } { 2 m }   |\\nabla \\psi |^2 + v_{\\rm{trap } } \\,|\\psi|^2 + \\frac{1}{2 } n g \\ , |\\psi|^4   \\right ) dx\\ , dy , \\label{ed}\\ ] ] where @xmath32 denotes the 2d order parameter , @xmath33 the number of particles , and @xmath34 the atom mass .",
    "the effective 2d coupling constant @xmath35 is written in terms of the 3d coupling constant between the atoms @xmath36 , where @xmath37 denotes the @xmath38-wave scattering length of @xmath39rb , @xmath40 being the bohr radius . in order to obtain stationary states",
    ", one has to perform variations of @xmath41 with respect to @xmath42 keeping the number of particles fixed , which yields the gross - pitaevskii ( gp ) equation @xcite @xmath43 the ground state wavefunction is numerically obtained without imposing any constraint .",
    "typical configurations are shown in fig .",
    "[ fun ] , where we depict the equidensity curves for different barrier heights .",
    "the left panel corresponds to the barrier - free system , while the middle and right panels correspond to barrier parameters fixed at @xmath44 and @xmath45 , respectively .",
    "we note that the chemical potential verifies @xmath46 for the lower barrier , while the higher barrier verifies the opposite inequality @xmath47 .",
    "thus , as we have explained in the previous section , the tf - density between neighboring sites should vanish in the latter configuration , while remaining finite in the former one .",
    "as regards the exact density , it should exhibit a similar behavior , except for a smoother decay .",
    "on the other hand , further constraints must be imposed in order to obtain stationary states with nonvanishing winding numbers , and to this aim we have employed a method which was described in detail in a previous work @xcite . summarizing , we begin by using the ground state wavefunction @xmath48 to construct an initial order parameter with vorticity @xcite :    @xmath49    where @xmath50 denotes the initial winding number or topological charge . from this ansatze ,",
    "it is straightforward to realize that @xmath51 and @xmath48 possess the same density profile , but @xmath51 presents an imprinted velocity field .",
    "such a field is irrotational everywhere , except at the origin , with a circulation along any closed loop around this point , which must be proportional to the winding number @xmath50 .",
    "next , we apply a minimizing procedure in order to obtain a stationary state . during the minimization such a velocity field undergoes drastic changes",
    "when large barrier heights are considered .",
    "notice that the presence of radial barriers destroys the axial symmetry , and thus the angular momentum does no longer commute with the hamiltonian . as a consequence , there is also no longer a linear relationship between the value of the angular momentum and the imprinted winding number .",
    "in addition , the final winding number @xmath52 after the minimization process may differ from the initial one @xmath50 , as will be shown in sec .  [ states ] , where we will also see that @xmath53 is bounded by a maximum value , which we shall call @xmath54 .     and @xmath55 .",
    "the number of particles corresponds to @xmath56 . ]",
    "in this section , we shall analyze the behavior of the angular momentum and the energy as functions of the winding number in two limiting cases , namely in the absence of barriers and for large barrier heights . in both cases",
    "we will derive analytical expressions for the mean values of such observables in terms of ground state magnitudes .",
    "hereafter , when referring to energy and angular momentum , it must be understood that they denote the mean value of the corresponding observables per particle .",
    "taking into account that the ground state density exhibits a hole at the condensate center , for vanishing barriers and an arbitrary winding number @xmath50 , the order parameter may be approximated as :    @xmath57    where we have assumed that the presence of a non - homogeneous phase in the wavefunction with its concomitant velocity field , does not affect appreciably the shape of the condensate density , as compared to that of the ground state .",
    "this occurs because the centrifugal force should have little effect outside the central hole , where the density is non - negligible .    replacing the wavefunction ( [ wfi0 ] ) in the first term of the integrand of ( [ ed ] ) we have :    @xmath58    and one",
    "can easily obtain the mean value of the energy as a quadratic function of the winding number @xmath50 ,    @xmath59    where @xmath60 denotes the ground state energy and @xmath61 is given by :    @xmath62 ^ 2 r dr .",
    "\\label{k}\\ ] ]    on the other hand , since the angular momentum commutes with the hamiltonian and the wavefunctions ( [ wfi0 ] ) are eigenfunctions of @xmath63 , we have the linear relationship    @xmath64      according to refs . @xcite and @xcite the most general solution of the gp equation is a bloch state of the form :    @xmath65    where the function @xmath66 is invariant under a @xmath67 rotation in @xmath68 .",
    "this type of solution is valid irrespective of the barrier height .",
    "the above periodicity is obvious in the modulus , since @xmath69 corresponds to the periodic particle density as shown in fig .",
    "however , the phase of @xmath70 does not necessarily present this symmetry . as an example , in fig .",
    "[ phase5 ] we depict the phase of @xmath71 as a function of the angular coordinate , which clearly does not exhibit such a symmetry .",
    "whereas , it is easy to verify that the phase of @xmath72 is indeed a @xmath67 periodic function .     as a function of the angular coordinate for @xmath73 , a winding number @xmath74 , and two values of the barrier height @xmath75 ( left panel ) and @xmath76 ( right panel ) .",
    "the number of particles is @xmath77 . ]    in this section we will concentrate ourselves on large barrier heights . in such a limit , the phase turns out to be almost uniform in each site , as it may be seen from the right panel of fig .",
    "[ phase5 ] .",
    "this is a consequence of the fact that for high barriers , the condensate portions become more isolated and thus the particle current diminishes .",
    "this , in turn , implies that the velocity field @xmath78 and hence the gradient of the phase @xmath79 practically vanishes within each portion .",
    "then , for large enough barriers , such that the chemical potential verifies @xmath80 , the system splits into a ring of weakly linked condensates , and the order parameter can be approximated as follows ,    @xmath81    where @xmath82 is a real function describing a localized state in the @xmath83-site , i.e. , having only a very little overlap with neighboring sites .",
    "this approximation is analogous to the tight - binding approximation @xcite , and the matrix element @xmath84 of a given observable @xmath85 can be approximated as    @xmath86    where we have assumed that only the matrix elements between neighboring sites are non - negligible . in our notation , the site denoted by @xmath87 ( @xmath88 ) is identified with that of @xmath89 ( @xmath90 ) .",
    "then , as the summation is performed over all @xmath83 values , we can rewrite the expression ( [ htermsgen ] ) as follows :    @xmath91    let us now assume that the observable @xmath85 is the angular momentum operator :    @xmath92    using that @xmath93 is hermitian and @xmath94 are real functions , the following equalities hold :    @xmath95    @xmath96    then replacing ( [ mom12 ] ) and ( [ mom2 ] ) in ( [ optermsgen1 ] ) we obtain @xmath97 and thus the mean value of the angular momentum reads :    @xmath98    note in the above expression that the winding number appears only in the argument of the sine , which determines that the angular momentum must exhibit a sinusoidal behavior as a function of @xmath50 .    in computing the mean value of the energy , it is convenient to separately treat the interacting and noninteracting terms .",
    "in fact , the noninteracting part , which corresponds to the observable @xmath99 , may be treated analogously to the angular momentum , yielding    @xmath100    which replaced in ( [ optermsgen1 ] ) leads to    @xmath101    on the other hand , the interacting term corresponds to the nonlinear operator @xmath102 , proportional to the particle density , for which the approximation ( [ optermsgen1 ] ) is no longer valid . in this case",
    ", the mean value must be computed to first order in the product of adjacent wavefunctions @xmath103 , yielding @xmath104 finally , from ( [ 20 ] ) and ( [ 21 ] ) we may conclude that the mean value of the energy will present a dependence of the type @xmath105 on the winding number .",
    "a vanishing barrier ( @xmath106 ) yields a ground state chemical potential @xmath107 ( @xmath108 ) for @xmath109 ( @xmath110 ) particles .",
    "such values turn out to be smaller than @xmath111 , and thus , as discussed in section ii , the corresponding condensates exhibit a hole at their centers @xcite .",
    "it has been shown , both experimentally @xcite and theoretically @xcite , that this type of configuration forming a torus can host locally stable multiply quantized vortices .",
    "we have found such stable vortices up to a maximum winding number of @xmath112 ( @xmath113 ) for @xmath109 ( @xmath110 ) , reflecting the fact that @xmath114 depends on the number of particles .",

    "( [ k ] ) , obtaining the values 0.01156 and 0.01114 for @xmath109 and @xmath110 , respectively .",
    "thus , we have drawn the curve arising from formulae ( [ ev0 ] ) , which shows an excellent agreement with the numerically obtained values ( circles ) , as seen from figs .  [ 3le0 ] and  [ 5le0 ] .",

    "we may also observe a decreasing value of the maximum winding number @xmath54 the system can host .",
    "in fact , we have found that for a given barrier height , the time evolution with a moderate dissipation @xcite of an initial state with winding number @xmath119 , may lead to different processes of vorticity reduction , which involve vortex motion along the barriers .",
    "such a vortex dynamics may either simply consist of a vortex escaping phenomenon or , by contrast , it may contain more complex processes such as , vortex escaping with the aid of antivortices .",
    "we describe in the following this last particular process .",
    "[ 32 ] shows a series of snapshots in time of the phase distribution when a winding number @xmath120 is initially imprinted in the condensate of 10@xmath121 particles and barrier height @xmath122 ( panel(a ) ) .",
    "we recall that the maximum winding number for this barrier height is @xmath123 , as shown in fig .",
    "the time evolution first yields a ring of @xmath124 vortices of topological charge @xmath125 , denoted as white dots in panel ( b ) , which move along the barriers from the condensate center outwards .",
    "thus , the circulation along the dashed line circle in panel ( b ) still bears @xmath120 , while the same calculation for a circle within the vortex ring would yield -7 . however , to reach the condensate border",
    ", each vortex should overcome the high density region corresponding to the potential minimum shown at the left panel of fig .",
    "[ potenr ] , which approximately lies around the dashed line circles shown in fig .",
    "such a displacement would produce an overall increase in energy that is actually avoided by the generation of an outer ring of antivortices , denoted as black dots in panel ( c ) .",
    "this leads to the formation of vortex - antivortex pairs , i.e. , dipoles , of lower kinetic energy that are then able to keep on moving towards the condensate edge , leaving behind them a pattern of centered vorticity of winding number -7 .",
    "this process is accompanied by a progressive reduction of the separation of both charges at each dipole . in the last panel ( d )",
    ", we may observe that each dipole is about to annihilate itself , while the final @xmath126 central vorticity pattern becomes evident by following the circulation along the dashed line circle .",

    "we may observe that while both magnitudes are well described by the periodic functions obtained in [ barrerasaltas ] , there still exist for the lower barrier heights , @xmath133 = 10 and 80 , some noticeable differences between the numerical values and the predicted curves .",

    "such intersections correspond to transitions between the low- and high - barrier regimes above described , i.e. , they indicate the barrier height above which the quantum tunneling regime becomes dominant .",
    "we have analyzed the angular momentum and energy as functions of the winding number in a ring - shaped lattice , finding two clearly differentiated regimes , according to the relative value of the barrier height as compared to the chemical potential .",
    "on the one hand , we have found that for low barriers , there exists an almost quadratic dependence on the winding number for the energy and a linear dependence for the angular momentum , as it is analytically derived in the absence of barriers . for high barriers , on the other hand",
    ", we have found that the energy and the angular momentum turn out to be accurately described by sinusoidal functions , as predicted from a simple analytical model .",
    "we have observed these regimes irrespective of the number of particles , and a remarkable difference between them consists in that for the low - barrier regime , metastable vortex states are obtained up to a maximum winding number @xmath114 , which depends on the particle number and the barrier height , whereas , for high barriers , such states are obtained up to a maximum winding number which only depends on the number of lattice sites .",
    "another difference between both regimes stems from the way in which vorticity becomes reduced from an initially imprinted winding number exceeding @xmath54 . for a low barrier , this process involves the displacement outwards along the barriers of positive point charges , jointly with an eventual generation of negative charges at the condensate edge .",
    "such antivortices penetrate along the barriers to form dipoles that , by diminishing the energy from velocity field , are then able to cross the maximum density region outwards . on the other hand ,",
    "the vorticity reduction in the large - barrier regime proceeds through the appearance of stretched positive vorticities along each barrier , which eventually escape from the condensate .",

    "<S> we study the winding number dependence of the stationary states of a bose - einstein condensate in a ring - shaped lattice . the system is obtained by confining atoms in a toroidal trap with equally spaced radial barriers . </S>",
    "<S> we calculate the energy and angular momentum as functions of the winding number and the barrier height for two quite distinct particle numbers . in both cases </S>",
    "<S> we observe two clearly differentiated regimes . for low barriers , </S>",
    "<S> metastable vortex states are obtained up to a maximum winding number which depends on the particle number and barrier height . in this regime , the angular momentum and energy show , respectively , almost linear and quadratic dependences on the winding number . for large barrier heights , on the other hand , stationary states are obtained up to a maximum winding number which depends only on the number of lattice sites , whereas energy and angular momentum are shown to be sinusoidal functions of the winding number . </S>"
