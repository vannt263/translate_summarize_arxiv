    "<S> we present a technique for extracting raman intensities from _ ab initio _ molecular dynamics ( md ) simulations at high temperature . </S>",
    "<S> the method is applied to the highly anharmonic case of dense hydrogen up to 500 k for pressures ranging from 180 gpa to 300 gpa . on heating or pressurizing </S>",
    "<S> we find first - order phase transitions at the experimental conditions of the phase iii - iv boundary . </S>",
    "<S> direct comparison of raman vibrons with experiment provides excellent discrimination between subtly different structures , found in md . </S>",
    "<S> we find candidate structures whose raman spectra are in good agreement with experiment . the new phase obtained in high temperature simulations </S>",
    "<S> adopts a dynamic , simple hexagonal structure with three layer types : freely rotating hydrogen molecules , static hexagonal trimers and rotating hexagonal trimers . </S>",
    "<S> we show that previously calculated structures for phase iv are inconsistent with experiment , and their appearance in simulation is due to finite size effects .    </S>",
    "<S> there have been some notable recent successes of using total energy calculations based on density functional ( dft ) to calculate expected signals from candidate structures , for comparison with inconclusive experimental data . </S>",
    "<S> agreement provides validation of the dft structure , and this combined approach can yield more information , with higher reliability , than either technique alone .    </S>",
    "<S> raman spectroscopy provides one such experimental probe , applicable in extreme conditions but providing insufficient data to determine crystal structure or identification of the vibrational mode @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> reliable calculation of raman frequencies and intensities of mechanically stable structures can be obtained using density functional perturbation theory ( dfpt ) @xcite based on _ ab initio _ lattice dynamics ( ld ) @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however these methods do not include high temperature effects , and fail for dynamically - stabilized structures with imaginary phonon frequencies . </S>",
    "<S> one solution to this is to extract vibrational frequencies from molecular dynamics ( md ) data @xcite .    for simple structures </S>",
    "<S> this is relatively straightforward ; _ bcc _ titanium and zirconium being nice examples . in these materials </S>",
    "<S> the soft @xmath0 phonon eigenvector is well defined , and its frequency and width can be calculated from projection of the md ( or monte carlo ) trajectories onto the relevant mode eigenvector , followed by fourier transform ( ft ) @xcite </S>",
    "<S> .    in lower - symmetry molecular systems there may be many modes which are formally raman active , and the coupling between lattice and molecular modes is typically highly temperature - dependent . </S>",
    "<S> worst of all are plastic crystal phases where the molecules can reorient in md and the eigenvectors calculated from perturbation theory become totally irrelevant .    in this letter </S>",
    "<S> we present a method for calculating raman frequencies from molecular dynamics , and apply it to the particularly awkward and topical case of the high - frequency vibron modes in high pressure hydrogen .    </S>",
    "<S> although liquid and solid phases i , ii of hydrogen have been well studied using md @xcite , much interest recently has focussed on pressures around 200 - 300 gpa where several phases are reported . </S>",
    "<S> generally accepted are a low temperature phase iii @xcite and a high temperature phase iv @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> theoretical predictions of many other phases @xcite have been made , and raman data suggests phase iv may itself have a subtle structural change at 270 gpa @xcite .    at these pressures x - ray experiments are exceedingly difficult , while neutron diffraction is simply impossible ; therefore most experimental data are extracted from raman and infrared spectroscopy , alongside conductivity measurements . </S>",
    "<S> none of these techniques produce enough data to resolve crystal structures , so dft studies have also been attempted @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> although these calculations typically ignore quantum effects on the protons , they still provide a useful indication of the likely structures . </S>",
    "<S> very recent papers @xcite applying path integral md to high pressure hydrogen show no qualitative behavioural change to the phase diagram : the main effect is that tunnelling allows molecular rotations to occur at slightly lower temperatures than in classical md , lowering the phase lines . </S>",
    "<S> most importantly for the present work , the vibrational frequencies of the molecules are largely unchanged by the path integral dynamics .    enthalpy is easily calculated in dft , being the combination of total energy of binding of electrons to atoms , plus the zero point energy . </S>",
    "<S> phase iii should be the lowest enthalpy phase over a wide range of pressures . _ ab initio _ structure search @xcite unveiled a number of candidate phases with low total energy , and evaluation of normal modes , phonon frequencies and zero point energy gave rise to prediction of a @xmath1 symmetry phase . from the phonon calculation it is further possible to calculate polarization and polarizability , from which raman and infrared intensities may be deduced . </S>",
    "<S> these show reasonable agreement between @xmath1 and experiment for phase iii @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> phase iv exists at higher temperatures and is therefore stabilized by entropy . </S>",
    "<S> high temperature calculations are more challenging for dft . </S>",
    "<S> using the quasiharmonic approach based on zero - temperature calculations , pickard et al @xcite evaluated free energies at finite temperature to claim that phase iv should be a layered structure with alternating graphene - like hexagonal layers interspersed with ordered molecular layers and @xmath2 symmetry . </S>",
    "<S> we refer to these layers as @xmath3 and @xmath4-type respectively . </S>",
    "<S> the critical result here is that the two different layers give strongly raman active vibron modes at two very different frequencies . </S>",
    "<S> experimental work also finds two vibron modes , lending support to a two - layer model @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> we have extended these calculations of enthalpies and phonons using the castep code @xcite across a wider range of frequencies and with a variety of pseudopotentials ( both ultrasoft and norm - conserving with various tunings ) and exchange - correlation functionals . </S>",
    "<S> we find that these previous results are robust @xcite . despite qualitative agreement , </S>",
    "<S> the lower - frequency vibron is observed at much higher frequency than calculated , and with very large width ( fig.[raman ] and @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> we also used static calculations to investigate whether the @xmath3 layers have atomic or molecular character . </S>",
    "<S> mulliken bond analysis shows very clearly that the @xmath3-layer hexagonal are rings of three @xmath5 molecules : the mulliken charge in the molecular bond is at least double that between molecules ( 1.5e vs 0.3e at 180 gpa , closing to 1.3e to 0.65e at 350 gpa ) . </S>",
    "<S> this result is consistent with snapshots from md . </S>",
    "<S> the reduction in molecular fidelity with pressure is accompanied by a steady reduction in the band gap .    </S>",
    "<S> we have conducted a range of md simulations at various conditions of temperature and pressure , starting in either the @xmath2 or the @xmath1 phase . </S>",
    "<S> we find that simulations with 48 atoms are plagued with finite size effects for reasons explained in @xcite , so all data here come from 288-atom calculations . </S>",
    "<S> the unit cells of @xmath2 and @xmath1 are sufficiently dissimilar that transformation between the two does not occur . </S>",
    "<S> this makes it clear that md alone can not be relied upon to find the experimental structure : comparison with data is essential for validation . </S>",
    "<S> however , we do observe direct phase transformation in the md between layered structures with and without the @xmath4-type free rotating molecular layer .    </S>",
    "<S> in simulations starting in @xmath1 we find a stable @xmath3-layered structure at temperatures up to around 300 k , above which a transformation occurs to a structure with alternating @xmath4 and @xmath3 layers similar to the monoclinic c2 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the transformation mechanism is such that the @xmath6-structure layers become almost orthogonal to the original @xmath1 @xcite .    for simulations starting in @xmath2 , we find reversible transitions between two phases : a structure with @xmath7 stacking similar to @xmath2 , with threefold layer - symmetry but with the @xmath4-layer molecules rotating about their centres , and a high - temperature structure with hexagonal symmetry , stacked @xmath8 with sixfold layer - symmetry where the @xmath9 layer has hexagonal symmetry and the @xmath10 layer exhibits fast rebonding which enables rotation of the hexagonal motifs of three hydrogen molecules . </S>",
    "<S> we refer to these phases as iva and ivb ( fig.[phaseiv ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> this transition is observed in two ways @xcite : a single md run with a ramped temperature rise and subsequent decrease traverses a path iva - ivb - iva with little hysteresis ; alternately , calculations at fixed t and p show the two phases . </S>",
    "<S> we use these latter calculations as the basis for our raman calculations , to test the simulated structures against experiment . </S>",
    "<S> it should be noted that our simulations have only four layers , so more complex stackings may exist .    </S>",
    "<S> our dfpt - ld calculations show that all modes in the @xmath2 phase are raman active . to compare with experiment we initially tried projecting the md trajectories onto ld eigenmodes , multiplying by the calculated raman intensity and taking the fourier transform @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this method relies on the normal mode vectors being invariant over time and with temperature . at the lowest temperature , 60 k , </S>",
    "<S> the structure remains in the initial configuration ( metastable @xmath2 ) and the projection method gives a raman signal in precise agreement with ld , as it should for harmonic vibrations @xcite . at higher temperatures molecular rotations exchange atom positions , and </S>",
    "<S> this method fails .        </S>",
    "<S> closer inspection shows that the strongly raman active vibron modes in all phases involve in - phase stretches of the molecules in the @xmath3 and @xmath4 layers . </S>",
    "<S> therefore we make the ansatz that , independent of molecular orientation , the raman - active vibron modes will involve in - phase stretches . extracting the raman signal from the md </S>",
    "<S> is now achieved by identifying molecular bondlengths at each step , which turns out to be always straightforward , and taking the time ft of the average projection of the velocity over the bondlengths @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we note that this procedure requires well defined molecules , but does not require us to identify layers @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this method produces well - defined peaks , and an example of the fit between simulated and experimental data at 270 gpa is shown in fig.[raman ] .     at 220 k ( solid red circles ) and in @xmath1 at 220 k ( solid red squares ) ( c ) lattice dynamics : in @xmath2 ( solid blue circles ) and in @xmath1 ( solid blue squares ) . </S>",
    "<S> the discontinuity in the @xmath2-md at 270 gpa corresponds to the iva - ivb transition . </S>",
    "<S> inset : the bifurcation of the @xmath1-md at 250 gpa corresponds to the two raman peaks which were calculated after @xmath1 was heated to 300 k and it transformed to a distorted structure similar to phase iv.,width=321 ]    in figure [ vibronp ] we show the pressure dependence of the md - calculated raman vibron frequencies compared with the experimental data . in phase </S>",
    "<S> iii the md has spectacular agreement with experiment @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> dfpt gives similar frequencies , but with a much lower slope ( fig.[vibronp ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> the simulation which started in @xmath1 at 250 gpa/ 220 k was also driven through the phase transition by heating to 300 k , where it formed a frustrated monoclinic , @xmath6-stacked structure @xcite leading to the appearance of a second vibron : this structure has mixed - layer character like phase iv , but the frequencies are clearly not in agreement with experiment ( inset to fig.[vibronp ] ) .    </S>",
    "<S> figure [ vibronp ] also shows that the ivb structure with rotating trimers does correctly reproduce the experimental frequencies , while iva and @xmath2 structures do not . </S>",
    "<S> the phase ivb lower peak seems to be comprised of two overlapping peaks(fig.[raman ] and @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> we can project the symmetric stretch modes layer by layer : for phase ivb with three different layers , this gives three different frequencies . </S>",
    "<S> the near - equal strength of the @xmath9 and @xmath10 peaks is due to having one layer of each in the simulation . </S>",
    "<S> this ratio is determined by finite size , and in reality the lower peak may be weaker . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , this feature is also probably present as a shoulder in the experiment , although its effect could be interpreted as an extended peak width ( see fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ raman ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> we therefore identify our phase ivb with the experimentally observed phase . </S>",
    "<S> iva occurs in a region of pt space occupied by phase iii , so we regard it as metastable .    </S>",
    "<S> the analysis of the detailed molecular motions gives a clear , intuitive picture of the high pressure phase behaviour of hydrogen . </S>",
    "<S> at low temperature we observe a series of @xmath3 layers to be the stable structure . above 60 k molecular motion </S>",
    "<S> means that this layer has 3-fold symmetry , but at 0 k a symmetry - breaking distortion freezes in giving the @xmath1 structure . </S>",
    "<S> at a temperature of around 250 - 300 k ( depending on pressure @xcite ) the transformation to phase iv ( our ivb ) occurs . </S>",
    "<S> the explanation for the entropy - driven transition is evident in the rapid rotational movement of the @xmath4 layer atoms . </S>",
    "<S> the molecules rotate rapidly in the @xmath4 layer such that their time - averaged positions have hexagonal symmetry . </S>",
    "<S> these rotations provide the entropy difference between phases iii and iv . at higher temperature , </S>",
    "<S> the fast rebonding in the @xmath10 layers enables the rotation of the hexagonal motifs and adds to the entropy , stabilising the ivb structure . </S>",
    "<S> once this rotation begins , the non - rotating @xmath3 layer adopts hexagonal symmetry . at lower temperatures </S>",
    "<S> , no rotation occurs and the hexagonal motifs are distorted and symmetry - broken , as in @xmath2 .    </S>",
    "<S> our 288-atom results are significantly different from previous md work @xcite which has been equivocal about the structure of phase iv , due reorienting of molecules , transformation of one layer type to another , and `` mixed '' phases of apparently random @xmath4 and @xmath3 layer stacking . in our own calculations with 24 or 48 atoms per unit cell </S>",
    "<S> we find the same behavior as described in @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> a simple 1d model @xcite of independent layers shows that the continual layer transformation ( random layer stacking ) is to be expected from finite size effects , rather than phase stability .    </S>",
    "<S> proton `` diffusion '' in the @xmath3-layers requires two distinct steps :    * rebonding within the rotating hexagonal motifs , a local process which can contribute to raman broadening and may be enhanced by tunnelling . </S>",
    "<S> this is seen in all simulation sizes at sufficient temperature and illustrated in figure [ phaseiv ] . * </S>",
    "<S> rearrangement of the motifs themselves , a process which must occur system - wide , and is seen only in 48 atom simulations and smaller .    </S>",
    "<S> the rebonding and rotation of these motifs was also described by liu et al @xcite , who also showed large diffusion of hydrogen which implies the rearrangement step .    </S>",
    "<S> the 48 atom cell has 2x2 trimer hexagons in a g layer , and we also observe correlated changes in the identity of pairs in these motifs , which combined with trimer rotation results in rapid diffusion of hydrogen through the system . this effect is not observed in our 288 atom simulations where the equivalent mechanism would require correlated changes in four trimers : we regard the apparent rapid diffusion in 48-atom simulations phase iv as a finite size effect @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> our ivb structure is the best model for the observed phase iv . </S>",
    "<S> our molecule - based technique shows vibron peaks appear which can be associated with each layer type . </S>",
    "<S> the b - layer gives the highest frequency , and analysis of the raman active modes associated with @xmath9 and @xmath10 layers in ivb gives two distinct vibrons of slightly different frequency . in the overall pattern , </S>",
    "<S> these peaks overlap to give a single peak with a shoulder . </S>",
    "<S> the wide variety of environments in which the g - layer molecules find themselves leads to a very broad raman width . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath4 layer molecules are well defined and the raman peak associated with them is sharper . in @xmath2 , iva and ivb </S>",
    "<S> the b - layer vibron has similar frequency , however the @xmath3 layer modes are quite different .    </S>",
    "<S> in sum , we have shown how raman frequencies can be extracted from molecular dynamics data allowing direct comparison to experiment . we have applied the method to hydrogen at high pressure , showing that the anharmonicity is so extreme as to invalidate use of dfpt normal modes , but that in - phase vibrons are the appropriate coordinates for projection . </S>",
    "<S> our simulations show several different phases , some of which are doubtless metastable , but by comparison to experiment we identify phase iii with a structure similar to c2/c , and phase iv with a high - entropy hexagonal structure of rotating molecules and trimer motifs . </S>",
    "<S> our simulations give no support to the notions that phase iv exhibits either proton transfer , proton tunneling or mixed molecular and atomic character .    </S>",
