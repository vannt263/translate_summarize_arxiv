    "analysis of wave scattering from spherical objects arises in many areas of acoustics , electromagnetics , biomedical imaging , and photonics research @xcite . in many real - world applications ,",
    "the quantities of interest are related to the transient scattering profile of the object , or to behavior that is not easily or efficiently characterized in frequency domain , such as broadband or nonlinear response @xcite . due to the various needs to model those transient phenomena directly in time domain , development of time domain modeling techniques",
    "is necessary .",
    "the analytical solution of scattering from spheres has been extensively studied for the time harmonic case , most commonly using multipole expansions such as those employed in mie theory @xcite and transition matrix ( t - matrix ) theory @xcite .",
    "compared to the wide array of frequency domain methods , there is a relative dearth of research on analytical or semianalytical approaches for transient wave scattering from spherical objects .",
    "this disparity arises primarily from the difficulty of translating the traditional frequency domain methods directly into time domain , as direct inversion from the frequency domain of mie - type solutions is not analytically tractable due to the singularity of hankel functions .",
    "time domain methods @xcite have been studied extensively to handle targets with arbitrary geometry , these methods are mesh - based schemes often incurring impracticably large computational cost due to the large number of degrees of freedom induced by basis sets tied to meshes .",
    "they also introduce inaccuracy as a consequence of nonconformality of the mesh to the true underlying spherical geometry , and suffer from well - known stability problems .",
    "the contribution of the present work is a semianalytical method that is capable of capturing all relevant transient acoustic scattering phenomena without recourse to simplified models , while retaining the efficiency and accuracy afforded by frequency domain mie - type expansions in the context of a time domain integral equation ( tdie ) framework .",
    "the resulting scheme is exact in space and exponentially accurate in time , of linear cost in both storage and computational complexity , and highly stable when solved using the marching on in time ( mot ) method .",
    "expansion of transient multipoles has been examined in the literature @xcite , but most of the work has focused on the radiation problem ; i.e. , fields radiated due to a source distribution , and not on the scattering problem . to the authors knowledge , the only previous work on the scattering problem is from buyukdura and koc @xcite who sought a scattering solution for the sound - soft case by using a multipole expansion in terms of time - dependent spherical wave functions . in their work , time domain coefficients for those wave functions",
    "are obtained by matching the same mode on both sides of the system . however , an inverse fourier transform of spherical hankel function leads to unstable numerical implementation due to the presence of convolution involving ultraspherical polynomials with rapidly growing tails .",
    "in contrast , the proposed tdie method utilizes orthogonal spherical harmonics instead of wave functions as the basis functions .",
    "a novel use of a time domain green s function expansion in terms of spherical harmonics avoids convolutions with ultraspherical polynomials while still allowing mode - by - mode solution ( orthogonality is still retained ) .",
    "though constructed within a integral equation ( ie ) based numerical solution framework , the proposed method does not suffer from geometry representation error and singular integrals , which are common for other ie - based methods .",
    "this formulation circumvents the problem of nonexistence of the inverse fourier transform of the hankel function , giving a rigorous and generalized framework for reconstructing the field on the surface .",
    "the resulting method exhibits excellent stability and accuracy even for very long time simulations .",
    "the principle contributions of this work are : ( 1 ) a mesh - free tdie framework with tesseral harmonics as spatial source and testing basis sets and a band limited temporal basis set .",
    "( 2 ) a spherical expansion of the time domain green s function that allows closed form evaluation of 4-dimensional spatial integrals as well as efficient numerical quadrature between smooth , bounded functions in computing temporal convolutions .",
    "( 3 ) a linear complexity marching on in time scheme with excellent late time stability that is accurate when compared with frequency domain mie theory . ( 4 ) a series of results demonstrating the high order accuracy and convergence of the method for sound - soft , sound - rigid and penetrable spheres .",
    "note that in this work , we restrict the pulse excitation to be a plane wave ; however , the same technique may be used for any band limited incident beam form .",
    "the remainder of the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "[ sec : prob_statement ] the time domain integral equations are formulated to describe the boundary value problem , with specializations to the soft , rigid and penetrable cases .",
    "exact equivalence between the mie solution and the frequency domain version of the integral solution is demonstrated in section [ sec : fdie ] .",
    "section [ sec : tdgf ] provides the expansion of the time domain green s function in spherical coordinates that underlies the formulation of the tdie - mot system in section [ sec : tdie ] .",
    "section [ sec : res ] presents results that validate the accuracy , convergence , and stability of the method .",
    "finally , we conclude and give future directions in section [ sec : conc ] .",
    "consider a spherical scattering object that occupies a volume @xmath0 residing in a homogeneous background medium occupying @xmath1 .",
    "the boundary of the scatterer is denoted using @xmath2 , and is equipped with an outward pointing normal @xmath3 .",
    "assume that the media in both @xmath4 and @xmath5 are irrotational , inviscid , and slightly compressible so that the velocity @xmath6 in each region may be characterized via the relation @xmath7 , @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is the velocity potential in region @xmath10 .",
    "the constitutive parameters of the background and the object are respectively denoted @xmath11 , and @xmath12 , where @xmath13 and @xmath14 for @xmath15 are the density and speed of sound in each region @xmath10 .",
    "assuming that the object is at rest with respect to the background medium , the pressure may be obtained as @xmath16 , where @xmath17 denotes derivative with respect to time . an acoustic pulse characterized by @xmath18 which contains information of @xmath19 that is band limited to a maximum frequency of @xmath20 and vanishingly small for @xmath21 , is incident on the scatterer .",
    "the total velocity potential for @xmath22 comprises both the incident and in scattered field , viz . , @xmath23 whereas the velocity potential for @xmath24 is purely due to the scattered field : @xmath25 .",
    "boundary conditions satisfied by the velocity potential follow those satisfied by the pressure and velocity , and are as follows :    [ equ : bc ] @xmath26 @xmath27    using the kirchhoff - helmholtz theorem and , the velocity potential satisfies the following equations for cases @xmath28 ( when @xmath29 approaches @xmath30 from @xmath4 ) and @xmath31 ( when @xmath29 approaches @xmath30 from @xmath5 ) respectively    @xmath32ds '    = \\partial_t \\varphi_0(\\bar{r},t )   \\end{split}\\ ] ]    @xmath33ds '   = - \\partial_t \\varphi_1(\\bar{r},t )    \\end{split}\\ ] ]    where @xmath17 denotes a derivative w.r.t time , `` @xmath34 '' denotes temporal convolution , @xmath35 , and @xmath36 .",
    "the temporal derivative is taken on both sides of the equation to facilitate application of the boundary conditions , which occurs as the next step of the formulation .",
    "doing so may be interpreted as using the more physical quantities of pressure and its normal derivative as unknowns instead of the corresponding velocity potential quantities . to simplify notation ,",
    "the following time - dependent single - layer and double layer potential operators are defined .",
    "@xmath37    @xmath38    using to rewrite , the limiting cases ( where both @xmath39 and @xmath40 ) of and can be written as    [ equ : tdlim ] @xmath41 @xmath42    where @xmath43 means taking the integral in @xmath44 in the cauchy principle value ( cpv ) sense . equations and for @xmath39 form the cornerstone of our analysis .",
    "these equations apply to the penetrable scatterer case ; reduced forms for the sound - soft and sound - rigid cases are obtained by imposing the usual modified boundary conditions .    for sound - soft sphere , pressure on the surface",
    "vanishes ( @xmath45 ) , therefore only one ie is left to represent the scattering problem .",
    "@xmath46    similarly for sound - rigid case , the normal velocity on the surface vanishes ( @xmath47 ) , and the corresponding ie is written as @xmath48    solution to these integral equations proceeds via two stages : ( i ) representation of the geometry and ( ii ) representation of potentials that reside on this geometry .",
    "the first is trivial : the spherical form of our structure permits an exact geometric representation .",
    "what is left therefore , is to represent the potential on the surface of the object . to this end",
    ", we choose to represent the potential using a basis of tesseral harmonics . in what follows , for the sake of completeness",
    ", we shall review using these basis functions in the frequency domain , and illustrate the close relationship between integral equations discretized using tesseral harmonics and analytical mie solutions .",
    "this will be then followed by deriving analogous expressions in time domain .",
    "in what follows , we briefly digress to draw equivalences between the time - harmonic version of the integral equations , and classical analytical solutions to these equations . in the fourier domain , and can be written as    [ equ : fdie ] @xmath49ds'=\\varphi_0(\\bar{r})\\ ] ] @xmath50ds'=- \\varphi_1(\\bar{r})\\ ] ]    and in the corresponding limiting cases as :    [ equ : fdielim ] @xmath51 @xmath52    where @xmath53/(4\\pi |\\bar{r}|)$ ] is the frequency domain helmholtz green s function for @xmath15 and an @xmath54 time dependence has been suppressed . the solution to these equations can be obtained assuming that the unknown potential can be represented using a space of basis functions . here",
    ", the basis functions are assumed to be spherical harmonics , viz .",
    ", @xmath55 where @xmath56 are the othornormalized version of spherical harmonics and @xmath57 is the truncation limit of the summation . in",
    "what follows , @xmath58 is used to denote @xmath59 .",
    "the addition theorem for the frequency domain green s function and representation of the incident plane wave in terms of spherical harmonics are given as @xmath60 @xmath61 in the above expressions , @xmath62 is an @xmath63th order spherical bessel function , @xmath64 is an @xmath63th order spherical hankel function of the second kind , and @xmath65 is the wave constant in medium @xmath66 .",
    "we note that the expansion for the green s function is convergent only for @xmath67 . as a result , must be used with the non - limiting cases of the fourier domain integral equations .",
    "after discretization and testing with the truncated tesseral harmonic expansions , orthogonality of the basis sets with the expansion results in a finite sum , and the limits @xmath68 and @xmath69 may be taken without issue .",
    "using expressions , together with the definitions of basis functions in , taking the inner product of the resulting system with @xmath70 results a system of equations for each mode @xmath71 ( after the limiting process ) : @xmath72   \\end{bmatrix }   \\begin{bmatrix }    d_{nm }    \\\\ c_{nm }   \\end{bmatrix } =    \\begin{bmatrix }    f   \\\\ 0   \\end{bmatrix } \\end{split}\\ ] ] where each of the elements are given as follows : @xmath73 @xmath74 @xmath75 @xmath76 @xmath77 the above expressions are obtained in the limit that @xmath78 .",

    "the coefficients are obtained using boundary conditions and orthogonality .",
    "it can be readily verified that the coefficients of the spherical harmonics used to represent the velocity potential in a traditional mie approach are identical to those obtained in .",
    "furthermore , it can be shown that the integral equations are unique and not corrupted by internal resonances .",
    "one can observe similar equivalence between ie and mie solutions for sound - soft and sound - rigid spheres , which means the analytical result for the ie should lead to mie solution .",
    "however , when analyzing either purely rigid or soft cases using integral equations , it is well known that discretization of these equations results in a non - trivial projection onto the null - space of the operators ( in the analytical scenario , the null - space is avoided through cancellation by the numerator ) . for the discretized problem , various methods have been developed to overcome this problem , including burton - miller @xcite and chief @xcite .    while the above exposition dealt with frequency domain , obtaining the transient response is not as trivial as taking the inverse fourier transform of because the inverse fourier transform of the spherical hankel function is not defined . in",
    "what follows , we present an approach using a novel representation of the retarded potential green s function in and together with to create an mot framework to compute transient coefficients associated with interior and exterior velocity potentials .",
    "this section presents an approach for deriving a time domain analog of the integral - equation based mie solutions presented in the previous section .",
    "the starting point of this analysis is the development of a novel expansion for the retarded potential green s function in terms of spherical harmonics without taking recourse to the addition theorem presented in .",
    "consider any function @xmath81 that can be expanded by legendre polynomials .",
    "@xmath82 suppose there exist coordinates denoted as @xmath83 , @xmath84 , with @xmath85 , @xmath86 and @xmath87 .",
    "one can then define @xmath88 the coefficients of the legendre expansion may then be rewritten as @xmath89 now , let @xmath81 denote the unbounded green s function in a medium with wave number @xmath90 , @xmath91 the green s function may now be represented in terms of legendre polynomials can be written as @xmath92 an inverse fourier transform ( ift ) of both sides of with respect to @xmath93 yields the desired representation of the retarded potential green s function @xmath94 where @xmath95 is a pulse function ( the value is @xmath96 when @xmath97 $ ] , and zero otherwise ) with @xmath98 and @xmath99 .",
    "finally , by employing the addition theorem for legendre polynomials , one can obtain an expansion for the time domain green s function in spherical coordinates @xmath100 where @xmath101 and @xmath102 are polar and azimuthal angles corresponding to @xmath103 for @xmath104 .",
    "when @xmath105 ( i.e. @xmath106 with the origin at the sphere center ) , equation separates spatial and temporal dependence of the time domain green s function .",
    "furthermore , because tesseral harmonics are by definition separable in their arguments , is separable in all arguments when restricted to the sphere surface . as is demonstrated in the next section , this allows closed form evaluation of all spatial integrals in the tdie system matrix .",
    "a similar expression was provided in the literature @xcite , _ sans _ the above derivation or its use in analysis . in",
    "what follows , this expression is used to construct a marching - on - in - time scheme to solve for scattering from soft , rigid and penetrable objects in time domain .",
    "the first step in solving and using the representation of the green s function given in section [ sec : tdgf ] is to represent the velocity potentials ( and their normal derivatives ) in terms of spatial and temporal basis functions . to this end , assume that the potentials can be represented as    [ equ : tdspbasis ] @xmath107    where @xmath108 and @xmath109 are the transient signatures of each spatial mode , and @xmath110 and @xmath111 are the final unknown coefficients to be solved for . in the above expansions @xmath112 are the temporal basis functions , @xmath113 is the time step size , and @xmath57 truncates the spatial basis expansions . while there are several choices for temporal basis functions including backward looking lagrange polynomials @xcite , and splines @xcite , in this paper we use approximate prolate spheroidal wave functions ( apswfs ) as interpolants @xcite .",

    "first , we present scattering results for the sound - soft , sound - hard , and penetrable cases . in each example",
    ", @xmath162 is chosen and @xmath163 is used as the half - width of the temporal basis function . due to the size of the scattering sphere and the frequency content of the incident pulse , four modes are sufficient to give convergent results .",
    "note that , because the expressions derived for the time domain integral equations are equivalent to the fourier transforms of the corresponding frequency domain expressions ( as shown in section [ sec : fdie ] ) , the number of harmonics required to reconstruct the field is exactly the same as in a traditional frequency domain mie solution , i.e. @xmath164 , with @xmath127 the wave number corresponding the maximum frequency .",
    "first , the tdie is applied to soft sphere case , to obtain the normal derivative of the velocity potential .",
    "figure 1 plots the time domain normal derivative of velocity potential observed at one point ( @xmath165and @xmath166 ) on the sphere surface compared with a result from the ift of the frequency domain mie solution , and figure 2 shows the normalized frequency spectrum of the tdie result , compared again with frequency domain mie solution . from the frequency spectrum plot , it is clear that all of the frequency components within the band are accurately captured .",
    "next , the results for the sound - hard case are given in figures 3 ( transient velocity potential ) and 4 ( normalized frequency spectrum ) .",
    "the velocity potential corresponding to the incidence pulse is also shown in figure 3 to illustrate the difference between the incident field and the total field including scattering field .",
    "a common practice in analyzing these types of problems is to assume that the total field is the same as the incident field .",
    "the result in figure 3 shows that , with the given problem parameters ( which are within the ranges used in applications such as ultrasound contrast agent simulation ) , this approximation is not valid , and the total field must be solved self - consistently to obtain a correct solution .",
    "the third example is the more complicated penetrable case in which both the velocity potential and its normal derivative are sought by solving the two coupled integral equations in section [ sec : tdie ] .",
    "the total velocity potential and its frequency spectrum are given in figures 5 and 6 respectively .",
    "for the penetrable case , resonance phenomena result in a response with duration much longer than that of the incident gaussian pulse .",
    "the corresponding resonance peaks are clearly visible in the frequency domain plot in figure 6 ; all of these are captured very accurately by the proposed time domain simulation .",
    "note that the inverse fourier transform of the time domain mie solution is not given here to make the plot easily readable .",
    "the accuracy of the time domain signal may be verified in the frequency domain plot of figure 6 .",
    "the next examples investigate convergence of the tdie method relative to the oversampling factor and the half - width @xmath118 of the apswf .",
    "the problem parameters are the same as for the previous three scattering results .",
    "results show convergence in the relative @xmath167 error norm for the frequency spectrum of the tdie solver compared with the frequency domain mie solution .",
    "figure 7 shows three curves which represent relative @xmath167 error versus oversampling factor ( @xmath168 ) for 0th , 4th and 8th mode .",
    "even for high order modes , the relative error decreases to approximately @xmath169 with decrease in time step size .",
    "another factor that influences the accuracy is the width ( @xmath170 ) of the temporal basis function .",
    "error curves for the 0th and 4th mode versus @xmath118 are plotted in fig .",
    "8 , where @xmath162 and @xmath118 is increased from @xmath96 to @xmath171 . by increasing the width of temporal basis function , the accuracy significantly improves due to the higher order interpolation capability of the apswf .",
    "there is a plateau in convergence at approximately @xmath172 that we attribute to other factors in the discretization and solution process , particularly in the inversion of the mot system ; the purpose of presenting this result is to show that the parameters for the apswf used in the scattering results above are sufficiently converged with respect to @xmath118 . with both the validation results and the shown convergence performance , the proposed time domain solver matches well against the analytical frequency domain mie theory results .",
    "in addition to accuracy , late - time stability is a very well known problem for tdie solvers , and has been heavily studied by researchers in both the acoustics and electromagnetics communities @xcite .",
    "analyses in several of these works indicate that a major source of instability is error in numerically evaluating spatial integrals . in the present work",
    "all spatial integrations are performed analytically and the temporal convolutions yield smooth functions . as a result",
    "the method exhibits excellent late - time stability .",
    "figure 9 shows a stable solution at an observation point on the sphere for 200,000 time steps .",
    "this paper presents a time domain boundary integral equation framework for analyzing acoustic scattering from spherical objects in a homogeneous medium . the unknown velocity potential is spatially discretized in terms of tesseral harmonics , and temporally discretized in terms of strictly band limited approximate spheroidal wave functions .",
    "an expansion of the time domain green s function in terms of spherical functions avoids the necessity of taking an inverse fourier transform of a spherical hankel function , as was done in previous work , and permits separation of temporal and spatial integrations in the boundary integral operators when applied to a spherical geometry .",
    "furthermore , the green s function expansion permits mesh free spatial discretization with analytical and singularity - free evaluation of spatial integrations in both the single and double layer potential operators .",
    "temporal convolutions involve band limited functions and therefore exhibit rapid convergence when numerically integrated .",
    "numerical results demonstrate that the global time domain matrix system is well behaved and the mot process is stable , even for long simulation time . since the spatial basis functions are mutually orthogonal , the system matrices are diagonal , which leads to an algorithm that with cost that scales linearly in both storage and computational complexity .",
    "it has been demonstrated both analytically and numerically that the tdie result converges to the traditional frequency domain mie theory solution , and is therefore capable of capturing all scattering phenomena without relying on simplifying assumptions .",
    "the method has several possible applications and extensions .",
    "first , it provides direct insight into the transient scattering behavior of acoustically excitepd spherical scatterers , e.g. microbubbles for drug delivery .",
    "second , it can provide direct time domain validation for purely numerical methods .",
    "third , it may be extended to nonlinear problems , for instance those in which the bubble moves under the influence of the exciting acoustic field .",
    "fourth , it can be expanded to systems of multiple spherical scatterers using a time domain analog to the t - matrix method .",
