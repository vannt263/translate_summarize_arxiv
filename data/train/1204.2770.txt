    "as the dirac operator comprises four - dimensional operators , its eigenfunctions possess four components .",
    "the coulomb interaction turned out to be sufficiently accurate for the description of chemical phenomena and the corresponding many - electron hamiltonian is called the dirac  coulomb hamiltonian .    a relativistic method based on the dirac  coulomb hamiltonian",
    "is called a four - component method .",
    "it yields negative - energy solutions , which are pathologic and of no use in chemistry .",
    "also , a large number of basis functions is required to properly describe the negative - energy states .",
    "these are two drawbacks of four - component methods that motivated the development of two - component methods , which remove the negative energy solutions and can , in principle , exactly reproduce the results of four - component calculations @xcite .",
    "several relativistic two - component methods were developed in the past decades .",
    "one of the widely used approaches is the second - order douglas ",

    "@xcite for a review .    in recent years",
    "it was shown that , if the goal is to exactly decouple the four - component hamiltonian matrix instead of the hamiltonian operator , the formulae of exact decoupling can be directly obtained .",

    " snijders ( bss ) @xcite method aims at exact decoupling of the free - particle fw - transformed four - component hamiltonian matrix by a matrix operator of the form derived in ref .",
    "the key matrix operator , which is used to construct the decoupling transformation matrix , is obtained by solving an iterative equation . however , invoking the free - particle fw transformation turns out to be not necessary for the construction of the exact decoupling transformation in a one - step protocol .",
    "the pioneering work of this one - step transformation was provided by dyall @xcite in the form of the so - called normalized elimination of the small component ( nesc ) approach .",
    "later it was generalized to the so - called exact two - component ( x2c ) method by several groups @xcite . since the dkh method also employs matrix techniques to evaluate the douglas ",
    "kroll transformation , it is also able to exactly decouple the four - component hamiltonian matrix .",
    "this has been shown within the arbitrary - order approach @xcite . for reviews of these developments",
    "@xcite .    even within a scalar relativistic approximation , where the spin - dependent operators are neglected",
    ", the construction of the relativistic hamiltonian matrix dominates the step of the one - electron integral evaluation .",
    "this is the case because the relativistic transformation is done within an un - contracted basis set and involves many matrix manipulations such as multiplication and diagonalization . for a large molecule including only one or a few heavy atoms , this procedure would waste computational resources since the relativistic effects are highly local and only significant for heavy atoms .",
    "it is therefore clear that a local relativistic method is desirable .",
    "even for a molecule containing only heavy atoms , such a local relativistic approach would be preferable as we shall see .",
    "the relativistic hamiltonian operator is universal in coordinate space and a local approach is unfeasible at the operator level .",
    "however , since most quantum chemical calculations apply a linear combination of atom - centered basis functions , we may employ these basis functions to construct atomic projectors as it is done in charge and spin population analysis @xcite .",
    "for those hamiltonian matrix blocks for which relativistic corrections are important , we shall derive a local relativistic hamiltonian matrix to evaluate it .",
    "the locality is then exploited in the basis - function space instead of coordinate space .",
    "a crucial aspect to determine will be which block of the hamiltonian matrix requires a relativistic description and how to evaluate it .",
    "undoubtedly , the heavy atom diagonal blocks will require a relativistic description , while the relativistic description of heavy atom off - diagonal blocks depends on their contribution to physical observables and on the feasibility of applying the relativistic description . for relativistic transformation techniques , such as dkh and x2c ,",
    "it is impossible to apply the relativistic transformation to an off - diagonal block alone without information about other blocks .",
    "it requires the information of a full square matrix to construct the relativistic transformation .",
    "such a difficulty disappears if one employs an operator - based relativistic method such as zora",
    ". the off - diagonal block of the hamiltonian matrix can be directly computed from relativistic integrals .",
    "however , the zora method provides a poor description of atomic inner - shell orbitals , which carry the largest part of the relativistic effect . in this sense ,",
    "the exact decoupling methods are the best candidate for applying a local relativistic scheme since they do not neglect important relativistic effects .",
    "all current exact decoupling methods employ the transformation technique .",
    "it is therefore not trivial to apply the relativistic description to heavy - atom off - diagonal hamiltonian matrix elements .",
    "however , in this work we propose that if the local approximation is applied to the decoupling transformation instead of the hamiltonian matrix , one could obtain results which include the relativistic description to heavy atom off - diagonal blocks .",
    "we also note that the main effort for the construction of the relativistic hamiltonian matrix with exact - decoupling methods is due to the evaluation of the decoupling transformation matrices .",
    "therefore , a local approximation to the decoupling transformation would also lead to a significant reduction of the computational cost .",
    "the following notation will be used throughout this paper .",
    "upper case labels @xmath1 denote heavy atoms which require a relativistic description , while lower case labels @xmath2 denote light atoms for which a ( standard ) nonrelativistic description can be assumed to be accurate enough based on numerical evidence compiled within computational chemistry in the past decades . to be more precise ,",
    "the former labels refer to nuclei with high nuclear charge numbers , while the latter refer to those with low nuclear charge numbers ( typically with nuclear charges of less than two dozen protons ) .",
    "of course , the distinction whether a nucleus is considered heavy or light bears some sort of arbitrariness and it will be made on the basis of the accuracy required in a quantum chemical calculation . in general , there are then five different types of hamiltonian matrix blocks @xmath3 , @xmath4 , @xmath5 , @xmath6 , and @xmath7 that need to be considered .    the evaluation of the relativistic hamiltonian matrix with exact - decoupling approaches requires a set of square matrices .",
    "they are the nonrelativistic kinetic energy matrix @xmath8 , @xmath9 the external potential matrix @xmath10 , @xmath11 and the overlap matrix @xmath12 , @xmath13 as well as an additional relativistic matrix @xmath14 @xmath15 denotes the @xmath16-th 2-spinor atom - centered basis function , @xmath17 the external potential , @xmath18 the speed of light , @xmath19 the vector of pauli spin matrices . the basis functions @xmath20 may be grouped according to the atomic nucleus to which they are assigned , which is key to the local approaches discussed in the following .",
    "the matrix representation of the relativistic hamiltonian is then evaluated as a function of the above - mentioned matrices @xmath21    a straightforward idea for a trivial local approximation is to apply the evaluation of the relativistic hamiltonian matrix only to atomic ( i.e. , diagonal ) blocks @xmath22 ( instead of to the full matrix , but where @xmath23 may also represent a group of atoms ) and to ignore the relativistic correction to all off - diagonal blocks @xmath24 adding more atoms to a group @xmath23 will improve the accuracy , but the computational advances will be lost when a group @xmath23 becomes very large .",

    "only in those cases for which the dlh scheme may work , we can further add the nr approximation on top of it for light atoms .",
    "as can be seen from both table [ tab_rei5 ] and table [ tab_rewp3 ] , different relativistic approaches behave basically identical with respect to the discussion of the nb and nr approximations .",
    "therefore , the approximations for the reduction of computational cost discussed in this article can be applied to all relativistic transformation approaches .",
    "in this work , we aimed at a rigorous local approximation to relativistic transformation schemes , which makes them applicable to and efficient for calculations on large molecules .",
    "we developed a systematic hierarchy of approximations that is based on the assembly of the unitary transformation from atomic contributions ( dlu ) rather than on a local approximation directly applied to the matrix representation of the hamiltonian ( dlh ) .",
    "the straightforward dlh scheme , which has evolved in the development of the dkh method ( see references given above ) , turns out to be not a very accurate local approximation since it only covers the relativistic treatment of the atom  same - atom diagonal blocks in the hamiltonian",
    ". it may fail if inter - atomic distances become short so that a relativistic treatment of the off - diagonal interatomic blocks becomes important . as a consequence ,",
    "the dlh approximation is not suitable , for example , in studies that crucially depend on accurate electronic energy surfaces .",
    "even if the molecular geometry is fixed , the dlh approach does not provide a balanced description for different molecular properties , since the contributions of the off - diagonal blocks to total observables are quite different for different properties .",
    "by contrast , the dlu scheme proposed by us in this paper overcomes the drawbacks of the dlh scheme .",
    "it is an excellent approach to take into account the atom  other - atom ( i.e. , interatomic ) off - diagonal relativistic transformations .",
    "it does not show an instability for varying molecular structures ( i.e , for electronic energy surfaces ) and properties .",
    "the size of the error introduced by dlu is much smaller than that of dlh ; it is typically only 1% of the latter .",
    "the errors of the dlu approach when compared to the full relativistic transformation without any local approximation turn out to be tiny .",
    "they are even smaller than the difference among the different exact - decoupling approaches , which are already very small .",
    "the dlu scheme is valid for all exact - decoupling approaches , while the local @xmath35-matrix scheme only works for the x2c approach .",
    "furthermore , the dlu scheme can also be applied to finite - order dkh approaches such as dkh2 , which has been very successful in computational chemistry and whose computational costs are less than those of any exact - decoupling approach .    if one has to use the dlh scheme for some reason , such as the lack of a dlu implementation or because of its linear - scaling behavior , the selection of a relativistic approaches is not decisive as the errors introduced by the dlh scheme are already higher than the difference of different relativistic approaches .",
    "hence , the approximate , but fast dkh2 method may be safely combined with the dlh approximation , while this can not be recommended for any exact - decoupling approach .    however , the linear - scaling behavior of dlh is no good reason since the dlu scheme can also be made linear - scaling within the neighboring - atomic - blocks approximation , which produces negligible errors .",
    "one can further reduce the computational costs by employing the bp or nr approximation to all light atoms . however , the bp approximation turns out to be not suitable for variational calculations since it introduces large errors . only the nr approximation yields acceptable results",
    ". the errors of the nr approximation will be larger if the nuclear charge of the atom for which the nr approximation is invoked increases .",
    "therefore , the application of the nr approximation will depend on the balance of accuracy and computational cost in an actual calculation .    while this work focused on the accurate approximation of exact - decoupling methods at the self - consistent - field level with respect to total electronic energies and first - order properties of a small , but well - selected test molecule set , further investigations into the dlu scheme concerning , for example , higher - order properties , spin  orbit and electron - correlation effects are under way in our laboratory ."

    "<S> therefore , dlu is an efficient relativistic method well suited for relativistic calculations on large molecules . </S>",
    "<S> if a large molecule contains many light atoms ( typically hydrogen atoms ) , the computational costs can be further reduced by employing a well - defined nonrelativistic approximation for these light atoms without significant loss of accuracy . </S>",
    "<S> we also demonstrate that the standard and straightforward transformation of only the atomic block - diagonal entries in the hamiltonian  denoted dlh in this paper  introduces an error that is on the order of the error of second - order douglas  </S>",

    "<S> hence , the local dlh approximation would be pointless in an exact - decoupling framework , but can be efficiently employed in combination with the fast to evaluate dkh2 hamiltonian in order to speed up calculations for which ultimate accuracy is not the major concern .    </S>",
