    "microwave kinetic inductance detectors ( mkids)@xcite are showing promising results to become the future of large detector arrays for terahertz astronomy",
    ". the main advantages of mkids are ease of fabrication , wide dynamic range and above all their inherent capability to read many pixels using frequency domain multiplexing@xcite .",
    "this has allowed a rapid development of mkid arrays over the past decade , which has recently resulted in the first observations using cameras based on mkid technology at ground - based ( sub-)mm telescopes@xcite .",
    "a common mkid pixel design used in these cameras is an antenna - coupled coplanar waveguide ( cpw ) resonator patterned in a superconducting film@xcite .",
    "the al resonators of such mkid pixels have shown@xcite a detector noise equivalent power ( nep ) as low as @xmath2 @xmath3 . while this is close to the sensitivity required for background photon noise limited photometry in space , @xmath4 @xmath3 , an improvement of two orders of magnitude is required to achieve this for spectroscopy@xcite : @xmath5 @xmath3 . + one possible route to improve the nep is to reduce the width of the cpw .",
    "experiments on al resonators wider than a few micrometers indicate that the nep@xcite scales as @xmath6 and @xmath7 for phase and amplitude read - out , respectively .",
    "this assumes @xmath8 is kept constant . here",
    "@xmath9 is the cpw central line width and @xmath10 is the width of the cpw slots .",
    "the sensitivity improvement results from the fact that the responsivity increases more rapidly @xmath11 than the noise @xmath12 for decreasing width .",
    "the increase in responsivity is due to a change in volume @xmath13 and kinetic inductance@xcite @xmath14 , while the increase in noise is a result of decreasing read - out power handling@xcite @xmath15 , which also affects the two level system ( tls ) noise@xcite in phase read - out @xmath16 . because of the low background loading in space , the majority of the quasi - particles are expected to be the excess quasi - particles created by microwave read - out power@xcite rather than those created by optical pair breaking .",
    "therefore , the quasi - particle lifetime is unaffected by the reduced width .",
    "if these trends continue down to a width of e.g. , @xmath17 nm , the nep would reach @xmath18 @xmath3 , which is sufficient for space - borne photometry .",
    "however , effects negligible for wide resonators could begin to play a significant role when the width approaches the film thickness and characteristic length scales such as the magnetic penetration depth .",
    "+ in this study , we systematically investigate the behavior of noise , responsivity and read - out power handling of the cpw resonators that are as narrow as 300 nm , in order to find out if width reduction is a viable route to improve the sensitivity of mkids to a level suitable for space - borne applications .",
    "electron beam lithography ( ebl ) and reactive ion etching ( rie ) are used to fabricate cpw resonators with a central line width as narrow as 300 nm .",
    "figure [ figsem ] shows on the left an optical micrograph of such a narrow quarter - wavelength ( qw ) resonator coupled to a 22 @xmath1 wide feedline .",

    "+ using only ebl and rie , cpw resonators with a central line width , @xmath9 , varying between 0.3 @xmath1 and 3.0 @xmath1 were patterned in a 100 nm thick nbtin film , which was sputtered on a hydrogen passivated high resistivity ( @xmath0 @xmath19 cm ) @xmath20100@xmath21-oriented si substrate .",
    "these resonators have a length between 3.5 and 5.0 mm .",
    "the @xmath8 ratio was kept constant at @xmath22 .",
    "the short quasi - particle lifetime @xmath23 ns@xmath24@xcite of stoichiometric nbtin prevents it from being used as the active material for mkids and therefore any optical experiments .",
    "however , in this work nbtin is used instead of al , because the higher @xmath25 k ( measured ) allows measurements in a he-3 sorption cooler with a base temperature of @xmath26 mk .",

    "however , at too high a read - out power a resonator will show unwanted non - linear behavior .",
    "hence each resonator has an optimum read - out power which balances these phenomena .",
    "we define the optimum power as the read - out power at which the transmission at resonance is not showing any non - linear behavior and the mean amplitude noise between 10 and 100 hz is the lowest .",
    "this minimum in the noise exists because an increase in read - out power will reduce the relative noise level of the lna , while overdriving manifests itself as additional @xmath46-noise . from the optimum read - out power , @xmath47 , the corresponding internal power ,",
