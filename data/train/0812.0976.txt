    "according to the standard picture of cosmic structure formation , dark matter and baryons acquire similar specific angular momentum during their collapse through external torques from neighbouring structures ( hoyle 1953 ; peebles 1969 ; white 1984 ) .",
    "discs are formed as the gas cools and condenses within the dark matter haloes conserving its specific angular momentum ( white & rees 1978 ; fall & efstathiou 1980 ; mo , mao & white 1998 ) . in these models , the final properties of discs",
    "are closely linked to those of their parent haloes : for example , disc sizes and stability properties depend on the spin parameter of the dark matter haloes in which they reside .    however , discs are unstable against rapid changes in the gravitational potential , such as those produced by the accretion of satellites ( toth & ostriker 1992 ; quinn , hernquist & fullagar 1993 ; velazquez & white 1999 ) .",
    "mergers of gas - poor disc galaxies are expected to produce early - type galaxies as remnants ( toomre & toomre 1972 ; toomre 1977 ) . isolated galaxy mergers have been extensively studied with hydrodynamical simulations , confirming that major mergers can indeed transform disc galaxies into elliptical - like systems ( barnes 1992 ; barnes & hernquist 1992 , 1996 ; mihos & hernquist 1994 , 1996 ) .",
    "given the fragility of discs and the fact that hierarchical models predict mergers to occur quite frequently , the existence of present - day spiral galaxies has been interpreted as an indirect proof of late disc formation in systems with a quiescent recent past .",
    "numerical hydrodynamical simulations are a powerful tool to study galaxy formation and evolution in its full cosmological context , since mergers are then naturally accounted for .",
    "state - of - the - art simulations currently include treatments of star formation , cooling , chemical enrichment and supernova ( sn ) feedback , and in some cases other processes such as black hole formation , active galactic nuclei ( agn ) feedback and/or cosmic ray generation .",
    "these have been successful in reproducing some observed properties of galaxies , such as overall scaling relations , star formation histories and chemical abundances ( e.g. springel & hernquist 2003 ; brook et al .",

    ". 2008 ( hereafter s08 ) ; among recent examples ) . however , such simulations have generally had difficulty reproducing disc - dominated galaxies in typical dark matter haloes , when taking into account the cosmological setting .",
    "a major problem is known as the `` angular momentum catastrophe '' .",
    "this occurs when baryons condense early and then transfer a significant fraction of their angular momentum to the dark matter as the final galaxy is assembled ( navarro & benz 1991 ; navarro & white 1994 ) . as a result , discs contain too small a fraction of the stellar mass in comparison to observed spirals .    in a limited number of cases ,",
    "simulations have been able to produce individual examples of realistic disc galaxies in @xmath0 cold dark matter ( @xmath0cdm ) universes ( e.g. abadi et al .",

    "; okamoto et al . 2005",
    "; governato et al . 2007 ; s08 ; see also croft et al .",
    "though , none has produced a viable late - type spiral .",
    "these simulations use the ` zoom ' technique which allows an individual galaxy to be simulated at high resolution in its proper cosmological context",
    ". the relative success of these models appears to reflect the inclusion of efficient supernova feedback and improved numerical resolution .",
    "typically , the simulated haloes are chosen so as to improve the chances of disc formation : masses similar to the milky way , relatively high spin parameters , and quiet merger histories . such haloes are believed to be the most likely to produce disc galaxies , but given our incomplete knowledge of galaxy formation and evolution , and our repeated failure to reproduce late - type spirals , it is uncertain whether these assumptions are correct .    in a recent paper ( s08 ) , we studied the effects of sn feedback on the formation of galaxy discs by using cosmological simulations of a milky way - type galaxy .",
    "this study used an extension of the tree - pm sph code gadget-2 ( springel 2005 ) which includes star formation , chemical enrichment and sn feedback , metal - dependent cooling and a multiphase model for the gas component ( scannapieco et al .",
    "2005 , 2006 ; hereafter s05 , s06 respectively ) . unlike other schemes",
    ", this treatment does not require ad hoc elements such as suppression of cooling after sn explosions or the explicit insertion of winds .",
    "galactic winds are _ naturally _ generated when the multiphase gas model and sn feedback are included .",
    "in s08 , we showed that this model can produce realistic discs from cosmological initial conditions .",
    "this is a consequence of self - regulation of the star formation and the generation of galactic winds .",
    "most combinations of the input parameters yield disc - like components , although with different sizes and thicknesses , indicating that the code can form discs without fine - tuning the implemented physics . in all cases",
    "tested , however , the dominant stellar component by mass was the spheroid .    in this paper , we investigate these issues further by following the evolution of eight different galaxy - halo systems in a @xmath0cdm universe at higher resolution than in our previous work .",
    "we use an updated simulation code gadget-3 ( springel et al .",
    "2008 ) which includes our multiphase gas and feedback algorithms .",
    "target haloes , similar in mass as the milky way and mildly isolated , were chosen from a dark matter only simulation of a cosmological volume , with no restriction on their spin parameter or merger history .",
    "these haloes were resimulated including baryons and at improved mass and force resolution .",
    "our main goal here is to test whether realistic discs form in typical @xmath0cdm haloes and whether spin parameter or merger history influences their properties as usually assumed .",
    "our paper is organized as follows . in section  [ sims ] , we describe the main characteristics of the initial conditions and the implemented physics . in section  [ results ] , we present the properties of our simulated galaxies at @xmath1 , while in section  [ halo_prop ] , we investigate the relation between the present - day morphology of the galaxies and the properties of their parent dark matter haloes . in section  [ disk_survival ] , we study the evolution of discs with time and investigate the processes leading to a morphological transformation . finally , in section  [ conclu ] , we summarize our main results .",

    "the initial conditions originally had dark matter particles only because the main aquarius project studies the properties of the dark matter distribution .",

    "we also show the sfrs constructed separately from disc ( green lines ) and spheroid ( red lines ) stars . clearly",
    ", both components have different typical time - scales of star formation ; stars formed at early times contribute to the formation of spheroids , while recent star formation leads to the formation of discs .",
    "this can be quantified through the half - mass formation times of the two components ( @xmath28 and @xmath29 ) , listed in table  [ table_disks ] .",
    "all spheroids are formed very early on , and they present typical mean formation times of the order of @xmath30 gyr .",

    "[ table_disks ] , we show the @xmath1 masses of the discs and spheroids for the simulated galaxies . from these values , we can see that discs are substantially less massive than spheroids in all cases ( see below ) .",
    "this suggests the need to prevent the formation of massive spheroids at early times : this would have the double effect of having less massive spheroids and leaving more gas available for star formation at recent times .",
    "it is striking that the remaining cold gas fractions in all our galaxies are very much smaller than in typical spiral galaxies .",
    "if more cold gas were left over , there would be a higher sfr at recent times , and later formation times for our discs , more similar to observed spirals ( macarthur et al .",
    "possible solutions intended to prevent the formation of spheroids at early times and to retain more gas for later star formation in discs will be investigated in a separate work .",

    "the milky way has a disc - to - total ratio of @xmath39 .",
    "this indicates that , although our code is able to generate extended galaxy discs and does not suffer from catastrophic loss of angular momentum , the discs obtained from this `` typical '' set of initial conditions are much less massive than typical real discs .",
    "this is probably due to overly strong feedback which expels a significant amount of baryons from the systems and removes the new material for disc star formation .",
    "all systems have baryon fractions of @xmath40 ( table  [ simulations_table ] ) . as discussed above ,",
    "our results suggest the need to investigate in more detail the formation of stars at early times which leads to the spheroidal components and the retention of cold disc gas to fuel recent star formation .",
    "the low sfrs we find in all our galaxies are a consequence of the very small amount of cold gas at low redshift , as indicated in table  [ table_disks ] .",
    "we note , however , that a correct comparison with observations is not trivial .",
    "in particular , d / t ratios calculated from the simulations refer to stellar mass , not luminosity , and therefore do not consider the age of the stellar populations .",
    "dust and inclination effects are not taken into account either .",
    "also , our selection of disc stars based on their kinematics may exclude bars , for example , which are labeled as part of the spheroids . as a result ,",
    "the d / t ratios listed in table  [ table_disks ] are probably underestimates of the mass of the geometrically thin component .",
    "we note that although improved numerical resolution might help to produce more realistic and thinner discs , the failure to simulate the formation of late - type galaxies will not be solved by an increase in resolution . as mentioned above , we have tested the effects of resolution by running two lower resolution versions of aq - e-5 ( table  [ simulations_table ] ) . in the case of aq - e-6 , we have also performed a full analysis of the final baryonic systems and find that the properties of the resulting discs and spheroids are consistent within a few per cent .",

    "on one hand , we investigate the effects of mergers on the disc components . on the other hand",

    "this galaxy is the only one in our sample that , at @xmath1 , has no disc component at all .",
    "mergers where @xmath71 can also produce important effects on the baryonic mass distributions .",

    "the d / t ratio drops rapidly from @xmath72 to @xmath73 after a merger event ( with @xmath74 ) ; however , the disc is able to survive until @xmath1 .",
    "smaller satellites ( @xmath75 ) do not seem to significantly affect the mass distributions . in general , we find that the effects of mergers with similar @xmath76 values can be different for different galaxies , presumably this partly depends on the orbit of the infalling satellite .",
    "these results suggest that satellites may significantly affect galaxy evolution , depending on both the relative mass of the satellite and central systems and the satellite s orbit .",
    "we now investigate another process which can lead to the destruction or shrinking of discs , this is the misalignment between the angular momentum of infalling cold gas and that of the stars in the centre of galactic haloes .",

    "we find clear differences in the evolution of @xmath77 for these two groups of galaxies .",
    "those in the second group , which have significant disc components at @xmath1 , typically have cos @xmath77@xmath78 since @xmath57 ( except for aq - d-5 where , around @xmath79 , the angular momenta of the cold disc and of the stars are almost perpendicular ) .",
    "( in the case of aq - e-5 , we detect two periods of misalignment corresponding to infalling cold clumps . ) on the contrary , those galaxies in the first group ( with little disc at @xmath1 ) show significant and rapid changes in cos @xmath77 with redshift .",
    "this indicates that the cold gas and stars are not coplanar .",
    "note that a second stellar disc , not aligned with the already existing one , may be formed from the cold gas , provided it is dense enough .",
    "in some cases , the cold gas and stellar components are even roughly counter - rotating , such as in aq - a-5 and aq - b-5 at @xmath70 , and in aq - h-5 at @xmath5 .",

    "clearly , a high misalignment between the gaseous and stellar discs is always accompanied by a decrease in the d / t ratio , indicating that mass is being transferred from the disc to the spheroid .",
    "note that , at high redshift , the decrease in d / t may also indicate that spheroids are getting more massive , not at the expense of the disc .",
    "however , for @xmath81 there are almost no new spheroid stars , as can be inferred from the star formation rates of spheroid stars ( fig .",
    "[ fig_sfrs ] ) and from the spheroid half - mass formation times @xmath29 ( table  [ table_disks ] ) , and therefore d / t can only decrease if stellar mass from the discs is transferred to the spheroids .",
    "our results show that both major mergers and disc instability , where mass is transferred from discs to spheroids , contribute to the destruction and/or shrinking of discs . taking into account the results of the previous section ,",
    "we conclude that the presence of discs at @xmath1 is more likely determined by the particular formation and merger histories of galaxies , rather than by the spin parameter of their parent haloes .",
    "the absence of major mergers seems to be a necessary condition for discs to form , but not to be sufficient .",
    "we have used a series of simulations to study the formation of galaxies in a @xmath0cdm cosmology .",
    "our simulations have enough resolution to follow the internal structure of galaxies and , at the same time , to keep track of larger scale processes such as mergers , infall and tidal stripping .",
    "we have simulated the evolution of eight galaxies with virial masses in the range @xmath82m@xmath17 .",
    "these were selected purely on the basis of their mass ( @xmath83 m@xmath17 ) and in isolation ( no companion exceeding half of their mass within @xmath7 mpc ) , with no additional restriction on spin parameter or merger history .",
    "the only condition was the absence of close massive companions at @xmath1 .",
    "as a result , our sample , although still small , should be representative for the formation of isolated galaxies similar to the milky way .",
    "dark matter only simulations of these haloes with much higher resolution than those studied here have been carried out for the aquarius project of the virgo consortium ( springel et al .",
    "2008 ) . in this paper",
    ", we have included gas dynamics using a specialized extension of the code gadget-3 which includes star formation and supernova feedback ( both from type ii and from type ia sne ) , metal - dependent cooling , a multiphase treatment of the gas component , and photoheating by the uv background ( s05 ; s06 ) .",
    "this hydrodynamical code includes no scale - dependent parameters , and is among the most detailed and least ad hoc attempts to describe the interstellar medium physics and sn feedback in galaxy formation .",
    "one of its main advantages is that galactic winds are naturally generated , without the ad hoc prescriptions required in most alternative simulation codes .    with the parameters adopted here",
    ", none of our eight haloes grows a @xmath1 disc with more than about @xmath2 per cent of the total stellar mass .",
    "four of the simulated galaxies do have well - formed and substantial discs in rotational support , three have dominant spheroids and little discs , and one has no disc at all .",
    "the star formation histories of all galaxies are similar , with an early starburst followed by a more quiescent phase and little star formation at @xmath1 .",
    "old stars populate the spheroids , while younger stars are found in the discs . as a result ,",
    "typical half - mass formation times are @xmath30 gyr for spheroids and @xmath84 gyr for discs .",
    "we find that , regardless of the presence or absence of a disc , all spheroids have similar mass profiles and stellar age distributions . while all discs formed from the inside - out , their mass distributions show greater variety .",
    "even the most massive discs formed in these simulations produce disc - to - total mass ratios of the order of @xmath85 , much lower than those of late - type spirals or of the milky way .",
    "this is primarily because of the small amount of cold gas available for star formation at late times .",
    "presumably , this is either due to an excess of star formation at early times which leaves the systems with too little gas to make a large disc , or due to too efficient feedback which expels the gas which would otherwise make the disc .",
    "we will investigate this problem in more detail in a forthcoming paper .",
    "we find that disc growth in dark matter haloes does not depend on spin parameter .",
    "we have significant discs in haloes with spin parameter as low as @xmath3 and as high as @xmath4 , and galaxies with little or no disc component in haloes with the same range of spin parameters .",
    "we also find no relation between disc mass fraction and halo spin parameter .",
    "as expected , our discs have high specific angular momentum , even higher than that of their dark matter haloes .",
    "in fact , the discs in our simulations all have similar specific angular momenta , independently of their mass .",
    "spheroids , on the contrary , span a wide range of specific angular momentum , although in all cases their values are smaller than those of the parent dark matter haloes .",
    "those spheroids with the highest specific angular momenta are found in haloes which have prominent discs at @xmath1 .",
    "the variation of disc - to - total ratio with redshift reveals that all our galaxies were able to form discs at some time during their evolution . at high redshift , some discs are comparable in mass to their spheroids .",
    "however , discs often fail to survive until the present time .",
    "we find that both major mergers and misalignment between the discs and newly accreted gas can completely or partially destroy them .",
    "only one of our galaxies experiences a major merger which completely destroys its disc and , at @xmath1 , it only has a spheroid .",
    "misalignment between stellar discs and newly accreted cold gas is more frequent and induces instabilities which transfer a significant amount of mass from the discs to the spheroids . among the galaxies which do have significant discs at @xmath1 ,",
    "there are substantial differences in disc evolution .",
    "discs can be stable since @xmath57 ; they can be completely destroyed and can regrow ; or they can lose part of their mass but survive until @xmath1 .",
    "our results suggest that discs can form easily in @xmath0cdm scenarios , regardless of the spin parameter of their parent haloes . however , their survival is strongly affected by major mergers and by disc instabilities .",
    "it is clear that the particular implementation of star formation and feedback physics in our current models , while it produces individual objects which resemble real galaxies , can not produce a galaxy population which matches observation .",
    "in particular , the disc mass fractions of our simulated galaxies are typically much lower than those of real galaxies of similar stellar mass .",
    "we produce nothing which looks like the milky way or other late - type spirals .",
    "apparently , real galaxies formed fewer stars at early times than our models and substantially more stars in a disc at late times .",

    "note that contamination will be present if the decomposition into the disc and spheroidal components is based on @xmath36 only .",

    "however , this system is a pure spheroid .",
    "all simulations would suffer from this contamination if no further restriction were done for disc stars .    as explained in the text ,",
    "our disc - spheroid decomposition is based on three conditions : @xmath88 , orbits roughly contained in the disc plane and disc stars lying above the white lines shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_epsilon_vs_r ] .",
    "the white lines are constructed in the following way .",
    "( i ) for each simulated galaxy , we first draw the lower white line , using the following functional form , @xmath89 and choosing values for @xmath90 , @xmath91 and @xmath92 in order to enclose most @xmath93 stars ( @xmath94 per cent ) between this line and a horizontal one at @xmath95 .",
    "( note that @xmath93 stars can be used as clean tracers of the spheroid . )",
    "the detailed shape of the curve is not important , provided it encloses most of the spheroid stars .",
    "the upper white line is then constructed by reflecting the lower line symmetrically about @xmath96 .",
    "the white lines thus delimit the spatial region of the velocity dominated spheroidal component .",
    "( ii ) as a safety check , we calculate the properties of the resulting disc and spheroid stars ( stellar age , metallicity , mass profile )",
    ". since the global properties of the disc and spheroidal components in our simulated galaxies are distinct and well - defined , contamination is easily detected .",
    "for example , if high @xmath36 stars in aq - f-5 are identified as disc stars , they will in any case be old , metal - poor , and centrally concentrated .",
    "these stars have the same characteristics as the spheroidal component present in this simulation , and clearly belong to it , rather than to a disc .",
    "our procedure is successful in avoiding this contamination .",
    "( iii ) if contamination is detected , we adjust our white lines , and repeat ( ii ) until we get clean samples for the disc and spheroidal components .    note",
    "that this procedure is valid provided the disc and spheroidal components have distinct and well - defined properties , which is the case for our simulated galaxies .",
    "we have tried a number of other ways to avoid contamination of the discs by spheroid stars , and found this particular one to be the most satisfactory one since it can be successfully applied to all our simulations , including aq - e-5 , where the decomposition is the hardest ."
