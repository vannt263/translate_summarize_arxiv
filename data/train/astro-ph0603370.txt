    "t tauri stars ( joy 1945 ) have long been known as solar - mass pre - main sequence stars . sprinkled throughout molecular cloud complexes , or gathered in dense clusters ,",
    "they have traditionally been identified by their unusual optical spectra which include bright emission lines of h@xmath0 and other permitted and forbidden atomic transitions . however , with the advent of x - ray molecular cloud surveys , another class of solar - type young star has been identified from their high x - ray luminosity . unlike the spectroscopically identified  classical \" t tauri stars ( ctts ) , these objects lack h@xmath0 emission in excess of 10   in equivalent width ( ew ) and are thus known as  weak - line \" t tauri stars ( wtts ; herbig & bell 1988 ) .",
    "confirmation that x - ray identified wtts are young stars requires high resolution optical spectra that show a solar - type spectrum with a li i 6707    absorption line equivalent width stronger than that of a pleiades star of the same spectral type ( covino et al .",
    "the presence of a strong lithium absorption indicates stellar youth among stars with deeply convecting photospheres since lithium is easily destroyed at high temperatures . in practice , using the li i ew to select young stars is a difficult task , since the strength of the lithium line may depend on the rotational history of the star and spot coverage ( mendes et al .",
    "in addition , spectral classes earlier than g5 may retain strong lithium lines throughout their main sequence lifetimes ( spite et al .",
    "thus , current lists of wtts are probably contaminated to some degree by young main sequence stars which are closer than the cloud , but too faint for accurate parallax measurements ( alcala et al .",
    "1998 ) .",
    "the current paradigm of planet formation is still based on the venerable iras ( strom et al .",
    "1989 ) and millimeter continuum surveys ( beckwith et al . 1990 ) of the late 1980 s that found mid - to - far - infared and/or millimeter excess emission around about half of solar - type stars in nearby clouds .",
    "this picture of disk evolution starts with class 0-i sources which are extremely faint shortward of 25 microns , proceeds through class i with a rising ir spectral energy distribution ( sed ) , continues to class ii which has a flat or falling sed with strong ir excesses above the photosphere , and ends at class iii where the excess emission indicates a tenuous , optically thin disk ( adams , lada , & shu 1987 ; andr & montmerle 1994 ) . in practice , iras and iso",
    "were not sensitive enough to detect optically thin disks in the mid - ir at the distance of nearby star formation regions ; however , the _ spitzer space telescope _ does have this capability .",
    "almost as soon as the first wtts were identified , they were presumed to be the class iii  missing link \" of the planet formation paradigm since ",
    "post \" t tauri stars had proved elusive .",
    "initial ground - based nir and mir studies showed that inner disks were very rare among the wtts population ( skrutskie et al .",
    "more recent jhkl studies of several young clusters indicated that inner disks disappear in 5 - 6 myr ( haisch , lada , & lada 2001 ) . on the other hand , a jhkl study of the @xmath1 10 myr @xmath2 cha cluster found a rather high disk fraction among its few known members ( lyo et al .",
    "2003 ) , although a smaller percentage of disks was found by haisch et al .",
    "both iras and millimeter surveys indicate that optically thick outer disks are rare among wtts ( strom et al .",
    "1989 , osterloh & beckwith 1995 ) .",
    "however , a sensitive study of tenuous material in the terrestrial planet forming zone of wtts has awaited the power of the _ spitzer space telescope _ ( _ spitzer _ ) . _",
    "spitzer _ has over 1000 times the sensitivity at 24  of the iras satellite , with similar improvements in its other imaging bands ( werner et al .",
    "2004 ) . only _",
    "spitzer _ can distinguish between transitional disks ( optically thick with inner holes ) , optically thin remnant disks with low disk luminosity l@xmath3 ( l@xmath3/l@xmath4 @xmath5 1 , like the debris disks found around older stars ) , and completely diskless  naked \" t tauri stars .",
    "study of circumstellar material around wtts promises to answer some significant questions about planet formation around low mass stars .",
    "the first is whether some young stars are born  diskless \" ; that is , some stars at the age of 1 - 3 myr do not retain remnant circumstellar material and did not possess substantial disks long enough for plausible planet formation .",
    "typical  core accretion \" models of giant planet formation require a minimum of 5 million years to make a jupiter , most of which is spent in the coagulation of dust and accretion of planetesimals ( wiedenschilling 2000 ) , although accretion times continue to drop in the most recent models ( goldreich et al .",
    "2004a , b ) and the alternative  disk instability \" model can produce giant planets on a very short timescale ( boss 2001 ) . a low detection frequency of any infrared excess among wtts would provide evidence for diskless young stars . in addition , this study will address the dispersion in disk properties among coeval stars in the same environment .",
    "these differences could possibly be related to the early formation of planets in the stars where the disks have inner holes or have disappeared entirely .",
    "such a hypothesis is potentially testable with future high resolution astrometric studies of young stars with and without disks to see if the presence of giant planets is related to the state of disk evolution .",
    "several _ spitzer _ surveys to assess the detection frequency of excess in young stars are either in progress or have been published recently .",
    "the entire range of @xmath6 instrumentation are utilized by these studies , including the 3.6 - 8.0 camera ( irac ) , the 24 , 70 , and 160  photometer ( mips ) , and the 5 - 40  spectrograph ( irs ) .",

    "due to the brightness of their targets and selection for low ir backgrounds , this program has much higher sensitivity at 70  than the other studies , enabling detection of very tenuous cold disks invisible to other surveys .",
    "two surveys which span a wide range of stellar ages are rieke et al .",

    "feps is examining stars with ages ranging from 3 myr - 3 gyr , divided into bins for stars of roughly equivalent ages ( meyer et al .",
    "the large age span for feps means that their sample has a large number of faint young stars at distances over 100 pc and a smaller number of bright nearby old stars for which 70 sensitivities are good .",
    "although their youngest age group includes solar - type stars of similar age to the current wtts sample , the feps young stars are located more than 6@xmath8 from nearby clouds ( silverstone et al .",
    "in contrast to these surveys , our 0.5 - 70  survey focuses only on wtts in and adjacent to several star - forming clouds within 200 pc .",
    "the current work is the first of three papers that will discuss disks around wtts in the c2d _ spitzer _ data .",
    "paper i discusses initial results for 90 stars specifically targeted for photometric mode observations with irac and mips .",
    "most of these sources fall outside of high extinction regions but within 6 degrees of cloud centers .",
    "paper ii ( cieza et al .",
    "2006 ) will present seds for wtts that fall within the large c2d cloud maps of perseus , ophiuchus , lupus , chamaeleon , and serpens .",
    "paper iii ( wahhaj et al . 2006 ) will present the remainder of the individually targeted wtts , provide upper limits for the 70 micron non - detections , and interpret the entire sample in terms of debris disk models .",
    "the c2d wtts survey source selection focuses on targets associated with nearby molecular clouds being mapped by large _ spitzer _ mapping surveys . only for nearby targets ( d @xmath9 200 pc )",
    "can _ spitzer _ achieve the needed sensitivity to optically thin dust in the planet formation region around a zams low - mass star , over a statistically meaningful sample , and in the 50 hours of observing time allocated for this study .",
    "molecular cloud association is crucial for establishing a star s youth : over 10 myrs , the measured proper motion dispersion for young stars at d@xmath10 140 pc can carry them 6@xmath11 of projected separation away from their formation region ( hartmann et al .",
    "we therefore required that our wtts targets lie within this radius from their associated cloud .",
    "about 1/3 of the sample lies within the clouds , 1/3 are adjacent to the clouds , and 1/3 are 3 - 6 degrees from the clouds . selecting wtts associated with clouds being mapped by _",
    "spitzer _ also allows an eventual comparison between the wtts disk properties and those of the younger cloud population ; both presumably formed under similar conditions . in the end , rich but distant regions of low - mass star formation ( orion , serpens , perseus ) were rejected for study in favor of those in the distance range 120 - 160 pc : taurus , lupus , ophuichus , and chamaeleon .",
    "the latter three are being mapped by the c2d project ( evans et al . 2003 ) , and a separate large _ spitzer _",

    "target sensitivities for the observations were defined relative to photospheric flux densities ; these were estimated by extrapolating optical and near - ir photometric measurements into the mid - ir using a blackbody appropriate to each star s spectral type .",
    "the irac observations consisted of two 12-sec exposures with an offset dither , plus two short 0.6 sec exposures ( `` hdr mode '' ) , taken in both camera fields of view .",
    "these achieved sensitivities sufficient to detect the photospheres of all the targets at s / n @xmath14 50 in irac s broad bands centered at 3.6 , 4.5 , 5.8 , and 8.0 @xmath15 m .",

    "most targets were therefore observed at a fixed total exposure time of 360 sec .",

    "sz 76 , an m1 star in lupus , is another borderline wtts / ctts with an h@xmath0 ew = 10.3   ( hughes et al . 1994 ) .",
    "the source was detected in x - rays during a pointed rosat observation of lupus i ( krautter et al .",
    "it was not seen at 1.3 mm down to a detection limit of 45 mjy which constrains its cold disk mass to @xmath25 5@xmath30 m@xmath31 ( nurnberger et al . 1997 ) .",
    "although no iras detections have been reported for this source due to this mission s limited sensitivity , we find substantial excess emission for this star longward of 4.5 microns ( figure 4 ) .",
    "a preliminary effort to model the possible disk of sz 76 is reported in section 4.2 .",
    "seven ctts either without iras detections or with confused iras seds were included in our sample .",
    "these vary in h@xmath0 properties from the borderline wtts / ctts sz 77 ( ew(h@xmath0 ) = 12  ; hughes et al 1994 ) to rxj1556.1 - 3655 ( ew(h@xmath0 ) = 83 wichmann et al .",
    "the seds of the ctts are presented in figure 5 with the exception of sz 77 , which is in figure 4 .",
    "a wide variety of sed morphologies are displayed by these sources .",
    "the most extreme levels of excess emission from 1.2 to 70 microns are shown by wa oph/6 , a k6 star with ew(h@xmath0 ) = 35   ( walter et al . 1986 ) .",
    "on the other hand , sz 84 , an m5.5 star with ew(h@xmath0 ) = 44  has almost no measureable excess shortward of 24 microns , implying a sizeable disk inner hole .",
    "the k5 star rxj1615.3 - 3255 ( ew(h@xmath0 ) = 19  ) also has very little excess shortward of 8 microns .",
    "thus , within our very limited sample , h@xmath0 equivalent widths do not appear to correlate with the presence of infrared excess , although it seems that ir excess is rare among stars with h@xmath0 ew @xmath25 10  .",
    "this finding appears to extend to somewhat below the wtts defining level of 10   h@xmath0 emission since the three borderline wtts / ctts in our sample show disk emission that is indistinguishable from the ctts in our sample .",
    "the purported ctts sz 84 merits additional consideration due to its very low fractional disk luminosity of @xmath9 0.001 .",
    "because of its relatively high h@xmath0 equivalent width , this source was listed as a lupus t tauri star in schwartz ( 1977 ) .",
    "however , it was not included in herbig & bell ( 1988 ) despite being discovered well in advance of this seminal work .",
    "its long pedigree and faint visual magnitude of 16.2 ( hughes et al . 1994 ) has apparently caused it to be overlooked entirely in li i 6707   equivalent width determinations .",
    "sz 84 also stands out as the star with the lowest n@xmath32 determined from _ rosat _ observations in krautter et al .",
    "it has a column density of hydrogen that is considerably lower than the bulk of stars in lupus ( log n@xmath32 @xmath10 18 versus 21 ) .",
    "although its estimated age on the dantona & mazzatelli ( 1997 ) tracks is 1.0@xmath280.3 myr , its age is entirely dependent on placing the object at the distance of the cloud . a young main sequence star in the foreground would also be consistent with the photometry and low a@xmath33 @xmath1 0 ( hughes et al . 1994 ) .",
    "given the tendancy of main sequence late m stars to have strong h@xmath0 lines , the low disk luminosity , and the n@xmath32 value which is suggestive of a foreground object , it is necessary to question the ctts identity of sz 84 .",
    "observations of the li i 6707   line will settle the question of whether this source is a foreground young star with a debris disk such as st 34 in taurus ( hartmann et al .",
    "two of the wtts in our survey show excesses only at 24 microns . although we are inclined to attribute this excess to dust emission in a disk due to analogy with ctts , it is also conceivable that excesses could be caused by an unresolved nearby source .",
    "the mips 24 @xmath7 psf has a fwhm of 5.7@xmath20 , larger than the irac psfs by a factor of 2 .",
    "thus , it is possible that a nearby source could be blended into the psf at the longer wavelength .",
    "however , in neither case is there an obvious irac source near the position of the 24 @xmath7 source .",
    "an exact overlap with an extragalactic interloper is also a possibility , although the areal density of these sources is only 300 deg@xmath34 for fluxes @xmath24 1 mjy ( papovich et al . 2004 ) . given a random distribution of galaxies , the probability of having one source with a superposition in the 6@xmath20 mips 24 @xmath7 beam is 0.065% .",
    "thus , in our list of 90 stars , there is about a 6% probability of a chance superposition or 0.138%  for two superpositions .",
    "it is also true that by selecting for x - ray bright stars , we may also be selecting for x - ray bright agn which are also bright at 24 @xmath7 ( franchesini et al . 2005 ) .",
    "most extragalactic sources have relatively flat spectra between 8 and 24 microns ( rowan - robinson et al . 2005 ) , and the sensitivity of irac is higher than mips , so extragalactic interlopers would likely be detected at the irac bands as well as 24 @xmath7 .",
    "unfortunately , the brightness of the stellar photosphere in the irac bands will likely drown out the extragalactic component .",
    "it is at 24 @xmath7 for stars with photospheric levels of @xmath1 1 mjy that this problem is most likely , as in our survey .",
    "unfortunately , very high resolution imaging at high contrast will be required to completely rule out this conundrum for low luminosity wtts disks .",
    "a final possibility is the presence of a low mass stellar companion that is unresolved even at optical wavelengths . due to the shape of the possible",
    "companion sed , it is highly unlikely that such a source would be undetected at 8 microns .",
    "these purported companions would have to be 3 times as bright as the primary at 24 but less than 10% as bright at 8  to fulfill the sed requirements .",
    "the only plausible stellar companion of this sort would be obscured by an edge - on disk and visible only in scattered light shortward of 10 microns , as in the case of hv tau c , where an edge - on disk is an optical companion of a wtts binary ( hartmann et al .",
    "2005a ) .",
    "in order to investigate the physical parameters of the wtts disks identified in section 3 , we compare their seds to disk models .",
    "we use the passive disk model presented by dullemond et al .",
    "( 2001 , d01 hereafter ) , which is based on the chiang @xmath35 goldreich ( 1999 ) flared disk model , but includes an evacuated inner cavity and an inner rim .",
    "the specific application of the dullemond model to t tauri star ( rather than herbig ae / be stars ) has been called into question recently by vinkovic et al .",
    "( 2006 ) and isella & natta ( 2005 ) .",
    "however , in the current case , this model is only used to provide preliminary insight into possible disk structures .",
    "it is entirely likely that more conventional t tauri disk models ( e.g. , dalessio et al .",
    "2005 ) would also fit the data , potentially requiring smaller inner disk holes . in the context of this model",
    ", the sed of an object can be constructed from the superposition of the flux contributions of 4 different components : the stellar photosphere , an inner rim , the disk s surface layer , and the disk s mid - plane .",
    "figures 6 - 8 show the seds and disk models for the pms stars sz 76 , sz 82 , and sz 84 .",
    "as described in section 3.2 , sz 76 and sz 82 are two borderline wtts / ctts , while sz 84 is a purported ctts with no measurable excess at irac wavelengths ( although it shows large 24 and 70 @xmath15 m excesses ) .",
    "the stellar and disk model parameters are listed in table 3 .",
    "the stellar @xmath36 and luminosity were derived as described in section 4.4 .",
    "the stellar masses come from the evolutionary tracks by siess et .",
    "the free parameters fitted to the disk models are : disk mass , inner and outer radii , inclination , and the power index of the surface density of the disk ( although the latter two parameters are not well constrained by the data ) .",
    "we find that for these particular models , the excesses at irac wavelengths are completely dominated by the blackbody emission from the inner rim .",
    "therefore , the inner radius and the inclination of the disk are relatively well constrained by the relative intensities and magnitude of the irac excesses .",
    "the total mass of the disk , the outer radius , and the power index are degenerate parameters only partially constrained by the 24 and 70 @xmath15 m fluxes .",
    "these are very preliminary results , but they show that the seds of wtts can be well reproduced by simple passive flared disk models with large inner holes .      if the low frequency of disks among wtts is confirmed by the remainder of the c2d wtts survey , it appears that most weak - line t tauri stars are indeed  naked \" t tauri stars at circumstellar radii less than those probed by 24 @xmath7 emission .",
    "a substantial population of stars apparently coeval with the ctts have fully disposed of their inner and outer disks within a time frame of a few million years .",
    "these results are similar to those found by hartmann et al .",
    "( 2005a ) for wtts in taurus - auriga .",
    "these authors found that the [ 3.6 ] - [ 4.5 ] versus [ 5.8 ] - [ 8.0 ] diagram clearly separates the bulk of ctts ( irac excess sources ) from wtts ( non - excess sources ) with a few ambiguous cases such as coku tau/4 which has excess only beyond 15 .",
    "however , the present study extends these conclusions beyond 8 microns to include the outer disks probed by 24 and 70 .",
    "another irac excess survey among young stars 3 - 30 myr in age is reported by the feps group ( silverstone et al .",
    "these authors found that 5/74 sources possess infrared excesses and four of these have ages estimated in the 3 - 10 myr range .",
    "interestingly , three of their five excess stars would be classified as ctts based on their h@xmath0 ew .",
    "a few _ spitzer _ excess surveys of slightly older stars have also been published recently . among the 23 g - type - m - type members of the tw hya association with an age of about 10 myr ,",
    "the 24  excess fraction is about 20% ( low et al .",
    "however , only one of the solar - type excess objects qualifies as a ctts based on spectroscopic criteria ( webb et al .",
    "an even higher excess fraction ( 40% ) was found in the 8 - 10 myr eta cha association , but 5/6 excess stars are ctts ( megeath et al .",
    "a similar fraction ( 35% ) has been found for the f- and g- type stars in upper sco - cen ( chen et al .",
    "notably , our excess fraction of 6% is considerably lower than the 20% excess fraction among a stars with ages of 5 myr or less ( rieke et al . 2005 ) , but these sources are not sorted by emission line brightness as in our survey . @xmath37 and @xmath38 studies of wtts mid - infrared excess are not sensitive enough to reach the photosphere at 24 so they are unable to identify more than just the optically thick disk population ( e.g. , gras - velquez & ray 2005 ) . for a similar reason ,",
    "it is important to note that some faint wtts may have outer disks which remain undetected by _ spitzer _ due to the lower than expected sensitivity of the mips 70 channel and the brightness of background nebulosity at that wavelength .",
    "unfortunately , the time required for _ spitzer _ to detect the photosphere of every wtts at 70  would be prohibitive",
    ". the old but nearby solar neighborhood population has been surveyed by _ spitzer _ at 70 @xmath7 to much greater depth than our survey , possibly accounting for its higher detection rate of cold disks ( bryden et al .",
    "based on the 24  and irac excess statistics , the frequency of excess among wtts is lower than any other group of young sources up to ages of 10 myr , but it is higher than the approximately 1% 24 @xmath7 excess frequency among main sequence populations ( bryden et al .",
    "we confirm and extend the findings of previous reseachers that lack of significant h@xmath0 emission among young solar - type stars indicates a lack of disk material even at a very tenuous level for r @xmath9 3 au .",
    "two of the objects in our survey have derived fractional disk luminosities which are among the lowest yet detected by @xmath6 for very young stars . in order to have a fractional luminosity of 1%",
    ", an optically thick disk must be extremely flat and thin to intecept such a small percentage of the stellar luminosity ( chen et al .",
    "2005 , kenyon & hartmann 1987 ) . on the other hand",
    ", these disks could be optically thin , in which case their l@xmath3/l@xmath4 of 0.01 would have approximately ten times the fractional disk luminosity of the @xmath19 pic disk . if the excesses of rxj0432.8 + 1735 and rxj1603.2 - 3239 are not due to a chance extragalactic superposition , they are possibly the first optically thin disks discovered around very young t tauri stars . at a brightness ten times that of @xmath19 pic , such disks should be easily visible with high contrast observations using",
    "_ hst_.",
    "one caveat to the above conclusion is continuing uncertainty as to the contamination of the wtts sample by @xmath10 100 myr old field stars ( covino et al .",
    "a recent astrometric evaluation of rosat selected young stars around tau - aur concludes that the sample is heterogeneous , consisting of a few actual tau - aur association members mixed with pleiades supercluster stars , hyades cluster member , and other foreground young stars ( li 2005 ) .",
    "certainly , the low frequency of disk excess found among our sample is more consistent with an older population than with million year old stars ( silverstone et al .",
    "2006 ; rieke et al .",
    "2005 ; gorlova et al .",
    "2004 ) .    in our survey ,",
    "the wtts with excesses are most often found within dark clouds or adjacent to known ctts .",
    "v836 tauri is on the border of lynds 1544 , sz 82 is within 10  of the famous emission star ru lup , and sz 76 lies only 20  from the ctts gq lup . even the low - excess star rxj0432.8 + 1735 is located within l1551 near gg tauri .",
    "only rxj1603.2 - 3239 is a relatively isolated source .",
    "thus , it appears that only the wtts that are projected onto dark clouds and ctts have a measureable excess .",
    "no excesses are measured for wtts more than one degree off - cloud .",
    "an additional source of contaminating young stars is present for the lupus star formation region .",
    "the sco - cen region , with its numerous members 5 - 20 myr in age , is adjacent to lupus and potentially overlaps the regions from which our lupus wtts were selected .    in order to estimate the age spread of our sample",
    ", we place our objects in the h - r diagram .",
    "we estimate the effective temperatures directly from the spectral type of the objects using the scale provided by kenyon & hartmann ( 1995 ) .",
    "we derive the stellar luminosities by applying a bolometric correction ( appropriate for each spectral type ) to the i - band magnitudes corrected for extinction and assuming the nominal cloud distances presumed by c2d ( taurus 140 pc , chamaeleon 178 pc , lupus 150 pc , oph 125 pc ) .",
    "an important _ caveat _ is that unresolved binary companions in our sample may produce up to a factor of two overestimates of stellar luminosity .",
    "the bolometric corrections were taken from hartigan , strom & strom ( 1994 ) and @xmath39 was calculated using @xmath40 .",
    "the ( r - i ) colors come from kenyon & hartmann ( 1995 ) .",
    "in order to evaluate the degree of model dependence of the stellar ages we derive , we use two different evolutionary tracks to estimate stellar ages : those provided by dantona @xmath35 mazzitelli ( 1997 , d97 hereafter ) and those presented by siess et al .",
    "( 2001 , s01 hereafter ) .",
    "we choose these two particular evolutionary tracks because they provide the appropriate mass and age range and are both widely used .",
    "figure 9 shows the ages derived for our sample using both sets of evolutionary tracks and reveals a considerable age spread .",
    "the error bars for every object have been calculated by propagating into the evolutionary tracks the observational uncertainties .",
    "we adopted a @xmath36 uncertainty equal to one spectral type subclass and a luminosity uncertainty of 30@xmath41 ( dominated by the distance uncertainty for individual stars ) .",
    "ages of pms stars are very difficult to estimate due to the large observational and model uncertainties involved .",
    "however , we find that , ( 1 ) even though d97 and s01 evolutionary tracks show some systematic differences ( i.e. d97 tracks yield significantly younger ages than s01 models ) , the relative ages agree fairly well , and ( 2 ) the total age spread in the sample is significantly larger than the typical ( observational ) error bar . we also find a possible decrease in the excess frequency of wtts with increasing derived age , although at a low significance level .",
    "according to the d97 models , 11% ( 4/37 ) @xmath28 5% of the wtts younger than 1 myr have a disk , while only 2% ( 1/46 ) @xmath28 2% of the wtts older than 1 myr have a disk .",
    "similarly , the s01 models indicate that 15% ( 4/26 ) @xmath28 7% of the wtts younger than 3 myrs have a disk , while only 2% ( 1/57 ) @xmath28 2% of the older stars do . even presuming that our stars are at the distance of the star - forming regions with which they are associated , about a third of the stars have properties that are consistent with an older population .",
    "the few sources with excess are among the presumably younger part of the sample , although many apparently diskless stars are also among the youngest . in the future",
    ", careful distance determinations will be required to eliminate main sequence interlopers from the true wtts sample .",
    "we have detected 24  excess emission from only 5 of 83 weak - line t tauri stars observed by the _",
    "spitzer _  cores to disks \" legacy project . the frequency for excess at @xmath23 @xmath9 10  is even lower ( 3/83 ) ; thus , two wtts only have excess at 24 microns .",
    "these may possess optically thin disks .",
    "the other three have seds indistinguishible from ctts , and h@xmath0 equivalent widths near the arbitrary 10 dividing line between ctts and wtts . according to our results and those of hartmann et al .",
    "( 2005a ) , solar - type pre - main sequence stars seem to predominantly be either diskless or surrounded by optically thick disks .",
    "there is no large population of optically thin disks around wtts .",
    "based on these preliminary results , we conclude that both optically thick and optically thin warm disks are rare among young solar - type stars with low h@xmath0 emission .",
    "this finding suggests that some stars may pass through the class ii stage in less than 1 - 3 myr . _",
    "spitzer _ observations at greater depth are required to determine whether the incidence of cold outer disks ( excess at @xmath24 70 @xmath7 ) for wtts is consistent with the field .",
    "further work is also required to determine the fraction of contaminating zams foreground stars in current wtts lists . a final _ caveat",
    "_ is that frequencies of apparently optically thin 24 @xmath7 excess among the wtts population are low enough so that confusion with background galaxies in the 6@xmath20 _ spitzer _ beam can not be ruled out as the source of the excess for individual objects .",

    "<S> weak - line t tauri stars are potentially extremely important objects in determining the timescale over which disk evolution may take place . our objective is to determine whether these young stars are diskless or have remnant disks which are below the detection threshold of previous infrared missions . we find that only 5/83 weak - line t tauri stars have detectable excess emission between 3.6 and 70  which would indicate the presence of dust from the inner few tenths of an au out to the planet - forming regions a few tens of au from the star . of these sources , </S>",
    "<S> two have small excesses at 24 microns consistent with optically thin disks ; the others have optically thick disks already detected by previous ir surveys . </S>",
    "<S> all of the seven classical t tauri stars show excess emission at 24 and 70 although their properties vary at the shorter wavelengths . </S>",
