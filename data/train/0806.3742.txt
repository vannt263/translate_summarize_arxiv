    "there is a project to measure directly n - n collision for checking charge symmetry of nuclear forces  @xcite .",
    "it is accepted that the best neutron source to perform such measurements is the russian pulsed yaguar reactor .",
    "some preliminary measurements and numerical simulations for expected experimental geometry had been performed  @xcite .",
    "we want to show here an analytical approach to calculations .",
    "first we obtain analytical momentum spectrum of scattered neutrons , then the time of flight spectrum of neutrons detected by a single counter .",
    "after that we consider coincidence scheme where we have two detectors , and calculate time of flight spectrum for one detector and delay time spectrum for the second one .",
    "we considered coincidence scheme because from the very beginning of discussions about the project , and all the time during preparation of the experiment , many people continue to express the opinion that the coincidence scheme has an advantage comparing to the single detector measurement .",
    "they claim that loss of intensity , which they usually estimated at the level of 20% , will be surpassed by much higher suppression of background .",
    "we show here analytically that in the coincidence scheme effect is so much suppressed , that the question about the background level becomes irrelevant .",
    "the scheme of the experiment is presented in fig . 1 borrowed from  @xcite .",
    "the yaguar reactor 1 gives a pulse of length @xmath0 ms , during which a huge amount of neutrons with flux density @xmath1 n/@xmath2s is released .",
    "after a moderator at room temperature @xmath3 neutrons in the thermal maxwellian spectrum arrive at the volume 2 ( @xmath4 @xmath5 ) , where they collide with each other and some of them after collision fly along the neutron guide 3 with collimators 4 , and arrive at the detector 5 , where they are registered with @xmath6% efficiency .",
    "the collimators 4 determine the solid angle @xmath7 , at which the volume @xmath8 is visible by the detector .",
    "the estimated number of neutrons that can be registered at a single pulse is equal to @xmath9 where factor 2 takes into account that the detector can register scattered neutron or neutron - scatterer .",
    "the square of the scattering amplitude @xmath10 is defined as : @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is the singlet scattering amplitude , which is accepted to be @xmath13 fm , and factor @xmath14 is statistical weight of the singlet scattering .",
    "therefore @xmath15 @xmath2 .",
    "the speed @xmath16 corresponds to the thermal speed @xmath17 m / s , and the factor @xmath18 determines number of collisions in the neutron gas per unit time .",
    "the factor @xmath19 is the square of the neutron density : @xmath20 @xmath21 .",
    "after substitution of all the parameters into ( [ e1 ] ) we find @xmath22 neutrons per pulse .",
    "however it is the estimation number . to find real number counted by the single detector , @xmath23",
    ", it is necessary to calculate the scattering process .",
    "calculation shows that @xmath24 , where factor @xmath25 is of the order unity .",
    "monte carlo calculations in  @xcite give @xmath26 .",
    "analytical calculations presented below give @xmath27 .",
    "the number of neutrons per pulse counted at coincidence , if the neutrons trap 6 is replaced by another detector , can be estimated as @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the width of the coincidence window , @xmath30 is the average length of measurement time after the reactor pulse , and @xmath31 m is the average distance between collision volume and the detectors . in the experimental scheme of fig .",
    "1 the time @xmath32 is of the order 5 ms .",
    "if we accept @xmath33 ms , then the ratio @xmath34 is 0.1 .",
    "the factor @xmath35 is included in ( [ e2 ] ) , because only neutrons in this solid angle will be registered by the second detector . the total factor , which suppresses the estimated number of neutrons registered per single pulse in coincidence scheme , is of the order @xmath36 , therefore the estimated number of counts in coincidence scheme will be @xmath37 , so the experiment becomes non feasible , and the level of the background , which is determined by neutron scattering on the residual gas atoms present at even very good vacuum conditions , becomes irrelevant .",
    "the analytical calculations , presented below , show that the real number of counted neutrons in coincidence scheme contains even additional small factor @xmath38 .",
    "our calculations will be based on the standard scattering theory of neutron scattering in the atomic gas .",
    "our main feature is that we shall make calculations directly in the laboratory reference frame without transition to the center of mass system .",
    "first we remind all the definitions of the standard scattering theory and then present analytical calculations of all the required integrals .",
    "the standard scattering theory starts with the fermi golden rule , according to which one can write down the probability of the neutron scattering per unit time on an arbitrary system as @xmath39 where @xmath40 , @xmath41 are initial , @xmath42 , @xmath43 are final states of the neutron and system with energies @xmath44 , @xmath45 , @xmath46 , @xmath47 respectively , @xmath48 is the neutron - system interaction potential , which in the neutron atom scattering is accepted in the form of the fermi pseudo potential @xmath49 here @xmath50 , @xmath51 are positions of the neutron and the system , @xmath52 is the density of the neutron final states @xmath53 @xmath54 , @xmath55 is the neutron mass , and @xmath56 is the size of some arbitrary space cell .    we suppose that the system is an atom with mass @xmath57 , and momentum @xmath58 .",
    "the initial and final states of the neutron and atom are described with similar wave functions @xmath59 where @xmath60 and @xmath61 are initial and final neutron and atom momenta respectively .",
    "the flux density of the single incident neutron is @xmath62 the scattering cross section at the given initial and final states is the ratio @xmath63 at the next step we need to sum this cross section over final states of the system and average over initial states . in our case summation over the system final states",
    "is the integration over density of the atomic final states @xmath64 this integration gives the cross section for the given initial states as @xmath65 @xmath66 where @xmath67 , @xmath54 , and the additional factor 2 means that the atom and neutron are the same particles , therefore we can detect with the same probability the scattered neutron in the phase element @xmath68 or an atom in the element @xmath69 .    for our experiment",
    "we need not a cross section , but the number of the neutrons @xmath70 scattered in the element @xmath68 .",
    "this number is determined by the number of collisions of neutrons with atoms , so the number of scattered neutrons is equal to @xmath71 where @xmath72 , @xmath73 are the number densities of atoms and neutrons with initial momenta @xmath74 and @xmath75 respectively , @xmath76 is the relative neutron - atom velocity , and @xmath8 , @xmath77 are volume and time , where collisions create detectable neutrons .    since our atoms and neutrons have the same maxwellian distribution with the temperature @xmath3 , the densities @xmath72 and @xmath73 are @xmath78 where @xmath79 is the average neutrons density , the letter @xmath3 denotes reduced temperature @xmath80/\\hbar^2 $ ] , and @xmath81 $ ] is the temperature in kelvin degrees . to find the total number of neutrons @xmath82 scattered into element @xmath68 of the final momentum space we must integrate ( [ q ] ) over @xmath83 , after which we get @xmath84 @xmath85 the matrix element of the potential ( [ wpg1d ] ) is @xmath86 and its square is @xmath87 after substitution of ( [ me1 ] ) into ( [ me0a2a1 ] ) we can extract @xmath10 from the square of the matrix element , @xmath35 from @xmath68 and introduce the thermal speed @xmath88 .",
    "as a result we obtain @xmath89 where @xmath90 is given in ( [ e1 ] ) , and @xmath91 is @xmath92 @xmath93    integration over @xmath94 gives @xmath95 where @xmath96 is the total momentum of two particles .    with all these definitions in hands we can directly calculate the spectrum of scattered neutrons      first we calculate the integral @xmath97 @xmath98 after change of variables @xmath99 we obtain @xmath100 where @xmath101 .    after representation @xmath102 , where polar axis is chosen along the vector @xmath103 , we can integrate over @xmath104 and @xmath105 . as a result we get",

    "we multiply it by unity @xmath140 where @xmath56 is the distance between scattering volume and the detector , and integrate over @xmath141 . after",
    "that we obtain @xmath142",
    "let s consider the case , when neutrons are registered in coincidence by two detectors on the opposite sides of the collision volume .",
    "it means that the angle between @xmath114 and @xmath115 is approximately 180@xmath143 .",
    "since we register both neutrons , we should not integrate ( [ me10 ] ) over @xmath69 .",
    "instead we should accept @xmath144 , @xmath145 , and @xmath146 with the same @xmath35 as in @xmath68 .",
    "taking into account eq .",
    "( [ e3 ] ) , ( [ e4 ] ) and ( [ e5 ] ) we can represent the number of neutrons counted by two detectors as @xmath147 after transformation to dimensionless variables @xmath148 and @xmath149 we get @xmath150 where @xmath151 and we replaced @xmath152 by @xmath153 .    to get tof spectrum in one detector and coincidence count in the second one with coincidence window @xmath29 we must multiply ( [ me2yy ] ) by the unit @xmath154 and integrate over @xmath155 . as a result",
    "we obtain @xmath156 after integration over @xmath157 in the range of the coincidence window @xmath29 we can put @xmath158 , and finally get @xmath159 for comparison of tof spectrum of two and single detectors it is useful to find ratio of ( [ me2u ] ) to ( [ me19e ] ) .",
    "this ratio is @xmath160    where @xmath161 the function @xmath162 is shown in fig .",
    "3 . its integral @xmath163 is equal to 0.15 .",
    "so we can tell that the ratio is approximately @xmath164 as is said in section 2 .",
    "we have shown that the effect of n - n scattering experiment and spectrum of detected neutrons in a single detector can be calculated analytically with the standard scattering theory without transformation to center of mass system .",
    "analytically calculated factor @xmath27 is close to that @xmath26 , calculated by monte carlo method .",
    "the difference can be attributed to slightly different spectra of neutrons in the collision volume . in monte carlo calculations spectrum",
    "contained maxwellian part and epithermal tail , while for analytical calculations we used only maxwellian part .",
    "we did not calculated background which is related to scattering of neutrons on gas molecules , but we claim that it also can be calculated analytically .",
    "one of the main conclusions of this paper is that coincidence scheme for this type of experiment is absolutely impractical , because the effect becomes so low , that the level of the background becomes irrelevant .",
    "i am grateful to a.v.strelkov for introduction me to this problem and to w.furman , e.lychagin and a.muzychka for interest and discussion .",
    "i submitted this paper on march 10 to the same journal j. phys .",
    "g : nucl . part . phys . , where the two papers@xcite were published . on march 31",
    "i received the electronic mail from editors with subject * final decision on your article from j. phys .",
    "g : nucl . part .",
    "phys . * , which meant that no more negotiations are supposed .",
    "the letter contained the referee report .",
    "i am not permitted by arxiv policy to present full content of the report , so i give a paraphrase of it .      that the paper is not worth of further consideration by the journal , because the journal has already published articles where neutron spectra were calculated by monte carlo techniques .",
    "analytical calculations by standard technique are not worth to be published . a new result of the paper , which shows that coincidence scheme is not profitable was also obtained by participants of the project ( their result was not yet published or submitted for publication ) ,",
    "therefore it is necessary to reject the paper .      in my opinion analytical calculation is much superior to monte carlo one .",
    "if it was not known and became known only later , it is worth its own publication .",
    "even if it gives the same result as monte carlo one , it is very important , because it proves that monte carlo calculations was made correctly .",
    "no one can check monte carlo calculations .",
    "every one can check analytical calculations .",
    "it is great that for analytical calculations one need nothing except standard theory , because , if it were necessary to make some new assumption , the merit of analytical calculation would become doubtful .",
    "referee also pointed out , that the papers [ 1,2 ] contain calculation of signal and background , while i calculated only signal . to this remark",
    "i can say that i am able to calculate the background too .",
    "however this analytical calculation is more laborious and why to do it , if it had already been calculated by the monte - carlo method , and analytical calculation are not worth of a `` stand - alone '' publication ?    after getting this reply",
    "i reconsidered my article and improved it .",
    "but in essence it remained the same .",
    "so the referee , if he were able to read the improved version , would have no reason to change his report .",
    "on april 3 i submitted the paper to yad.phys .",
    "( russian nuclear physics ) , and on april 29 i received the referee report , which approved the paper and contained some comments that helped me to improve it even further .",
    "so i want to express my gratitude to him .",
    "after correction of the article i submitted it again to yad .",
    "but after few days i obtained the letter , where editors asked me to delete section 6 .",
    "i replied why ? whether it is not my right to publish everything , which is related to the problem ?",
    "more over the referee did not require to omit this part .",
    "but in the next letter the editors informed me that the referee considered the deletion of the section 6 as self - evident .",
    "i sent to the editorial board my arguments why to accept my paper with the section 6 .",
    "they are :    1 .",
    "it is nasty to forbid something which can be permitted .",
    "it is nasty to apply power where it is useless .",
    "publication of the section 6 is harmful only for editorial board of the j. phys .",
    "g , and their referee , but is very profitable for the whole scientific community , because it shows that irresponsible referee reports will be published and it is a real punishment for them .",
    "any decision of the yad .",
    "editors will be historical one , because i shall publish everything in the arxiv , but the positive decision will demonstrate that the editorial board agree with me and takes the responsibility for future reports of its referees .",
    "the section 6 is not irrelevant to the content of the paper .",
    "it rises the important question : whether analytical calculations merit publication as a stand - alone article or not , if everything can be calculated numerically by , say , monte - carlo method .",
    "notwithstanding of my arguments the verdict was  to delete the section 6 .",
    "one of the vice chief editors ( he is not anonymous and advised me not to reveal his name ) wrote me that he can not publish because it contradicts to the law of genre .",
    "i asked him which article of the genre law does he refers ?",
    "one of the journals publishes my articles with referee reports .",
    "the editorial board does not think that it contradicts the genre law and i take off my hat to their editors .",
    "however , since there are no arguments except the claim that the journal can not publish the section 6 , i consider it as a demonstration of power to which i am to obey .",
    "i delete the section , but i shall publish the full article in the arxiv , and there i shall explain why the section 6 is excluded from the article published in yad.phys .",
    "i wanted also to publish my paper with section 6 as a preprint of jinr .",
    "the chief of publishing department told me that she has no right to publish such a section without approval by scientific secretary ( ss ) .",
    "i applied to ss for permission , but in vain .",
    "then i appealed to our director ( d ) with the same arguments as above .",
    " said one of my friends to whom i told the story .",
    " i can predict the end of it .",
    "the d will sent your article again to ss .",
    "the ss will return it to d with a note : `` i consider it not appropriate '' , and the d will write `` i agree '' and sign such a resolution !"
