    "next , in section [ sec::hd ] , we prove theorems [ thm::dimension ] and [ thm::dimension_circle ] .",
    "the first step is to establish the identity ( [ eqn::polar ] ) which is a consequence of the fact that the lebesgue measure on a disk can be written as a limit of riemann sums of the length measure where the convergence is an appropriate sobolev space .",
    "this allows us to sandwich the sets considered in theorems [ thm::dimension ] and [ thm::dimension_circle ] between @xmath49 and @xmath99 so that we need only show @xmath100 and @xmath101 .",
    "we prove the more difficult lower bound using a multi - scale refinement of the second moment method , similar to the techniques employed in @xcite .",
    "roughly speaking , the crucial estimate that one needs is a quantitative bound on the degree to which the events that two given points are @xmath5-thick are approximately independent .",
    "we address this by considering a special subset which we term `` perfect thick points . ''",
    "these are defined in such a way so that the approximate independence is a consequence of the markov property of the field .",
    "the upper bound follows from an estimate of the modulus of continuity of @xmath102 and that for fixed @xmath8 the processes @xmath103 evolve as brownian motions .",
    "finally , in section [ sec::conf_invariance ] , we prove theorem [ thm::conf_invariance ] .",
    "it is easy to predict that the conformal invariance result is true since the gff itself is conformally invariant , thick points are defined in terms of averages over small disks , and conformal maps send disks to disks at infinitesimal scales .",
    "this intuition , however , is far from a proof since integration against the gff does not define a measure , much less a measure that is absolutely continuous with respect to lebesgue measure . in particular , the gff can assign large mass to a set that is small in the lebesgue sense precisely due to the presence of thick points .",
    "the basic idea of our proof is as follows .",
    "we use the markov property of the field to reduce to the case that @xmath104 ^ 2 $ ] .",
    "this choice is particularly convenient because the @xmath105 ^ 2)$ ] orthonormal basis @xmath26 given by the eigenvectors of the laplacian is given by products of sine functions ; this makes many of our computations elementary and explicit .",
    "we then show that if @xmath39 is a small dyadic square centered at @xmath8 or the image of such centered at @xmath106 under @xmath107 then then @xmath108 is sufficiently well approximated by @xmath109 . using a covering argument",
    ", we then deduce that an analogous estimate also holds for disks @xmath36 and conformal images of disks @xmath110 with small radii .",
    "this argument is sensitive to the geometry of a disk since we need that the number @xmath111 of maximal dyadic squares of side length @xmath112 in @xmath36 does not grow too quickly as @xmath113 .",
    "theorem [ thm::conf_invariance ] then follows from a bound on the lebesgue measure of the symmetric difference @xmath114 and some gaussian estimates .    throughout the paper ,",
    "we will make use of the following notation .",
    "if @xmath115 are two functions , then we write @xmath116 provided that @xmath117 as either @xmath118 or @xmath113 , the case being clear from the context .",

    "this choice of inner product is particularly convenient because it is invariant under precomposition by conformal transformations .",
