    "they do not exhibit the typical narrow spectroscopic features of strongly interacting supernovae and they are usually referred as superluminous supernovae ( slsne ; see the review of * ? ? ?",
    "they can be divided in two main groups , hydrogen free - and hence labeled slsne i - and hydrogen rich - therefore called slsne ii .",
    "the first class is better studied : they show blue continua at maximum light , a distinctive `` w '' feature due to o  ii at early epochs and , at about 30 days after peak they are spectroscopically similar to normal or broad - lined type ic sne at peak luminosity @xcite ; consequently , they are also usually labeled slsne ic ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "additionally , slsne ic show different light curve behavior and , as a consequence , have been divided in the subgroup of fast evolving ( e.g. sn  2005ap , sn  2010gx ; * ? ? ?",

    "* ) and that of slow evolving ( e.g. sn  2007bi , ptf12dam ; * ? ? ?",

    "they show some resemblances to normal type iil , although by definition they are several magnitudes brighter ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* for a review ) .",
    "despite the increasing number of objects found every year , the nature of their explosion and the progenitor scenario are still debated .",
    "the favored scenario for all the types is that of an explosion driven by a magnetar as a central engine , which deposits energy into the supernova ejecta and significantly enhances the luminosity @xcite .",
    "however , alternative scenarios such as the accretion onto a central black hole @xcite , the interaction with a dense circumstellar medium ( csm , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and a pair instability explosion are still feasible alternatives .",
    "the pair - instability mechanism is only physically plausible for some of the objects , in particular those with the slowest evolving lightcurve ( e.g. see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* )    a powerful diagnostic to distinguish between scenarios is polarimetry since it can unveil information on the geometry of the explosion and hence increase our understanding of the transients .",
    "imaging polarimetry of a fast evolving slsne ic has been reported by @xcite but no evidence of asymmetries was found",
    ". however , spectropolarimetry offers a more in depth analysis of the geometry of sn explosions ( see * ? ? ?",

    "if this were true , we would expect to see an intrinsically asymmetric explosion characterized by a dominant polarization angle as observed for stripped envelope sne ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",

    "indeed many core collapse sne show large - scale departures from axisymmetry ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    if a magnetar is the central engine that powers the extreme luminosity , , then the strong magnetic field ( b@xmath1 g ) and rapid rotation could lead to asymmetries @xcite .",
    "such asymmetries are potentially stronger than in normal stripped envelope sne .",
    "detection of such signatures may suggest a core - collapse origin combined with an asymmetric magnetar energy injection process . on the other hand , alternative scenarios such as the interaction with a csm would exhibit spectropolarimetric evolution similar to those of type iin sne ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "these signatures are different than that of stripped envelope sne , since they typically show unpolarised broad lines and loops across spectral lines arising from the csm @xcite .",
    "an axisymmetric ejecta could be the consequence of : an aspherical production of energy and momentum from an explosion due to magnetohydrodynamic jets @xcite or magnetoturbulence ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "most of the peaks in the polarization signal are roughly coincident with the absorption minima of identifiable p - cygni profiles in the spectra : at the first epoch , there is a clear increase in polarization across the fe  iii absorption feature at about 5100   and also across both the oxygen lines at 4400   and 7700   . at the second , post - maximum epoch ( + 27.5d ) , the degree of polarization across o  i ( p@xmath41% ) remains similar to that found at the first epoch ( p@xmath201.2% ) . however , there are significant changes to all the features blueward of o  i. the si  ii line , which shows a more prominent p - cygni profile in the + 27.5d flux spectrum than the -23.7d , reaches a peak polarization signal of @xmath201% , while the fe  ii 5000   features reaches p@xmath42% .",
    "the high - polarization feature at about 7000   corresponds to the blue end of a shallow absorption trough in both the spectra , which was tentatively identified as carbon by @xcite or it could alternatively be associated with oxygen ( see section  [ sec : sp ] ) .",

    "we note that , in the first epoch , the dominant axis almost cross the origin and passes through the isp measurement ( black star in fig .",
    "[ fig : qu ] ) , suggesting that our estimate for the low level of isp was correct . on the other hand ,",
    "the best fit of the second epoch is slightly different than the previous and does not cross the isp . in principle , a difference might indicate an intrinsic change of the dominant axis from the first to the second epoch and hence a different dominant orientation between the external and inner layers of the ejecta .",
    "alternatively , the difference between the fits can be due to the larger uncertainties on q and u in the second epoch , especially in the red part of the spectrum .",
    "however , the change in angle of the best fit between the two epoch is sufficiently small , and comparable with the errors , that it can be attributed to measurement uncertainties only .",
    "we note that if we force our fit to pass through the isp in the second epoch we obtain an angle of -11@xmath46 , which is still comparable to that of the first epoch .",
    "we note that our analysis clearly suggests that the data at the first epoch cross the origin in the q - u plane ( from second to fourth quadrant ) .",
    "as discussed by @xcite , this often suggests that the isp may have been inaccurately estimated and that the true value of the isp should be at one of the two extremes of the data distribution in the q - u plane . in our case , however , that would imply a 1%@xmath47p@xmath48@xmath472% , which is inconsistent with the low reddening observed toward the sn ( see sect .

    "the second epoch is more polarized than the first and does not show a sign reversal .",
    " would be classified as spectropolarimetry type d0 in the terminology of @xcite since it shows a distinct dominant axis and a distribution orthogonal to that consistent with observational noise .",
    "in addition , the stronger lines do not exhibit a loop in the q - u diagram , hence they do not show large significant changes in amplitude and position angle .      to date , polarimetric data has been presented for only one other slsne ic , namely lsq14mo @xcite . however , only broad - band polarimetry in the fors2 v filter was obtained when the object had an observed magnitude @xmath54 .",
    "@xcite reported an average polarization of p  =  @xmath55% over five epochs from -7d to 18d since maximum light , which could be explained by isp in the host galaxy .",
    "a similar result , based again on broad - band imaging polarimetry , has been reported for a single epoch of slsn ii ps15br by @xcite .",
    "we checked if the findings of @xcite are consistent with ours . to do that , we scaled  spectra to the same distance of lsq14mo ( @xmath56 mpc ) .",
    "this decreased our observed flux by a factor @xmath57 - corresponding to a luminosity @xmath58 mag fainter with respect to those listed in tab .",
    "[ table : log ] - and the s / n by a factor of almost three .",
    "furthermore , our total exposure time is almost double than that used for lsq14mo , which would imply an additional decrease of the s / n by a factor of a third and hence higher error and scatter to the previous results .    integrating over the vlt+fors2 v broad - band we evaluated p@xmath59 = @xmath60% and p@xmath61 = @xmath62% for the first and second epochs , respectively .",

    "the average polarization is p  =  @xmath63% .",
    "hence , the data quality in case of lsq14mo was likely to have been too low to detect the intrinsic polarimetric signal of the sn , preventing any conclusion about the geometry .",

    "therefore the broad - band observations of lsq14mo ( which have less than 3 hr of integration ) almost certainly have insufficient signal - to - noise to determine reliable stokes parameters and the polarization vector .",
    "therefore it is not surprising that @xcite could not draw any firm conclusion about the intrinsic polarization of lsq14mo from their observations .",
    "furthermore , with imaging polarimetry any information about lines and continuum contribution from the ejecta is omitted and hence the results are hard to interpret .",

    "this causes a sign reversal of @xmath66 around @xmath102   , in good agreement with what is observed for  .",

    "the ejecta geometries proposed by our calculations are reported in fig .",
    "[ fig : geo ] . the implications of these results for the different progenitor scenarios will be discussed in section  [ sec : dis ] .",
    "we stress again that the simple ellipsoidal modeling developed here is only intended to broadly characterize the data and frame their interpretation .",
    "in particular , we did not attempt to model any discrete spectral features nor investigate the extent to which the two epochs are consistent with evolution in homologous expansion .",
    "instead we have considered the two epochs individually .    ) , while the inner shell has increased its asphericity from a@xmath110 to a@xmath111 .",
    "the pictured ellipsoids have the same asphericity reported in the figure and in the text . ]",
    "several scenarios have been proposed to account for the exceptional luminosity of slsne . among these ,",
    "the most successful to reproduce light curves , as well as velocity and temperature evolution , has been that of a central engine , likely a magnetar , that deposits its energy into the supernova explosion @xcite .",
    "however , other scenarios including the interaction of the ejecta with csm due to a pulsational pair instability sn ( ppisne , e.g. * ? ? ? * ) or a black hole as central engine @xcite can not be ruled out to explain the variety of slsne observables .",
    "our spectropolarimetric observations provide a new insight into the geometry of a slsn explosion and we can now consider the implications of this for identifying the explosion mechanism responsible for their extreme luminosity .    the data show a deviation from spherical symmetry and the presence of a dominant axis which implies an axisymmetric configuration of the ejecta .",
    "furthermore , the u@xmath52 polarization vector in the new rotated system - where the q@xmath52 vector is along the dominant axis and the u@xmath52 is orthogonal to the previous ( see sect .  [ sec : rot ] ) - indicates that there is almost no physical deviation from the dominant axis .",
    "to explain the observed increase in the q@xmath52 vector from the pre - peak to the post - peak epoch ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : rot ] ) we need an increase in the asphericity of the inner layers of the ejecta or the photosphere to recede into inner layers which are less spherical .",
    "the geometric parameters inferred from our toy ellipsoidal modeling of the inner zone ( a@xmath112 and a@xmath113 , see sec .",
    "[ sec : polmod ] ) are certainly model dependent and so can only be taken as indicative : they depend in detail on the composition / line opacity adopted and on all parameters controlling the shape and density distribution . to fully understand degeneracies among these parameters , and to construct a self - consistent model that accounts for both epochs is beyond the scope of the simplistic approach used here .",
    "nevertheless , the calculations illustrate that moderate departures from sphericity combined with substantial wavelength - dependent opacity can qualitatively account for the observed spectropolarimetric properties .",
    "although we used ellipsoidal toy models to characterize the data ( shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : geo ] ) , it is important to note that alternative axi - symmetric configurations , including bipolar ejecta morphologies , would also be able to match the observations .",
    "together , the data and modeling presented above suggest that , as time passes , the spectral forming region recedes into increasingly aspherical ( but axi - symmetric ) ejecta layers . in the following ,",
    "we consider the ramifications of this conclusions for our understanding of slsn explosion models , bearing in mind models involving a dominant axis are favored by the data .",
    "multidimensional simulations of magneto - rotational core - collapse sne have already shown large scale asymmetries @xcite . in the case of a magnetar as the inner engine , the overall axisymmetry and the increase of asphericity",
    "as the photosphere recedes through the inner layers with time could be the consequence of several factors .    1 .",
    "it could be a consequence of a jet - like flow stalled within the core in a similar fashion to that proposed for sn  2008d / xrf  080109 @xcite .",
    "this is an event linked to x - ray flashes which may also be related to @xmath114-ray bursts but with a softer radiation outburst . hypothetically , this suggestion could also be supported by the possible link between slsne ic and ultra long @xmath114-ray burst @xcite .",
    "2 .   as the ejecta expands , its density decreases and the non - thermal radiation from the magnetar wind nebula can ionize more of the ejecta @xcite . a magnetar wind nebula that is asymmetric could enhance such behavior .",
    "2d simulations of magnetar powered slsne @xcite have shown that fluid instabilities and mixing occurs if energy is deposited in a relatively small mass of material which could be , approximately , the mass of the inner ejecta .",
    "the amount of energy deposited needs to be comparable to that of the ejecta kinetic energy of the explosion . these instabilities and mixing could alter the geometry of the ejecta , giving an axysimmetric geometry reminiscent of that of the crab nebula , if the initial magnetar period is less than 3 ms @xcite .",
    "notably , the magnetar models proposed for the bolometric light curve of  do satisfy this condition ( 2.1 ms and 1.7 ms for the two best fit shown in * ? ? ?",
    "in the case of a black hole as a central engine , the first scenario described above ( the jet like flow ) would still be applicable . to date , there have been no multidimensional simulation of this mechanism and little can be added about the geometry of the ejecta .",
    "however , the inner engine mechanism would need to explain the wavelength dependence observed in  data .",
    "recently @xcite have suggested that pair instability sne ( pisne ) could still be a viable scenario to explain slow evolving slsne ic like  .",
    "ejecta from such explosions have a metal rich inner ejecta .",
    "the attempt in modeling the wavelength dependence in our spectropolarimetry data suggests a strong line opacity , achievable with a very metal rich composition .",
    "however , there is some tension between this ejecta composition and the observed spectra since they do not show very obvious signatures of strong ling blanketing .",
    "this suggest as detailed modelling including self - consisting spectra and polarisation is needed .",
    "additionally , it is hard for such massive explosions to break the original spherical symmetry as shown by several multidimensional simulations @xcite . a multidimensional simulation including rotation was actually able to produce an axisymmetric inner ejecta for a highly rotating co core @xcite , but this was at the cost of lower luminosity and redder spectra than those of non - rotating pisne .",
    "we note that one object showing similar behavior to that of highly rotating pisne has been reported ( ps1 - 14bj , * ? ? ?",
    "however , a pisn explosion for  is hard to reconcile with all the data we have to date ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "the last scenario to consider is that of the csm interaction . as mentioned in section  [ sec : intro ] , the most promising mechanism to explain the high luminosity in the framework of interaction is that of a pulsational pair instability sn ( ppisn ) , where thermonuclear outbursts due to a recurring pair - instability release massive shells of material that eventually collide with each other .",
    "the undulations observed in the  light curve@xcite , as in other slow - evolving slsne ic ( * ? ? ?",
    "* inserra et al . , in preparation ) , could be a consequence of collisions between multiple shells .",
    "such collisions could lead to a strong mixing and rayleigh - taylor instabilities creating a structure which deviates from spherical symmetry behind the shock generated in the last collision @xcite .",
    "however , such instabilities would not preserve an axis .",
    "additionally , the outermost collision is like that between a sn ejecta and a dense shell expelled by the star prior to its death as in the case of type iin .",
    "this was suggested for the case of slsn iin sn  2006gy @xcite , which shows narrow h lines in the spectra throughout its evolution .",
    "hence , it is difficult to reconcile the flux and polarization spectra with those of interacting sne . indeed , even if we assume that in our h- and he - free environment we should not observe narrow lines belonging to the unshocked external material .",
    "we should have observed an overall polarized continuum as in the other interacting supernovae ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) and a line polarization similar to those observed in normal , non - interacting sne which show an axisymmetric photosphere below the interaction . as reported in sections  [ sec : sp ]  &  [ sec : spol ] and shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : original ] we do not observe such behavior .",
    "we have presented the first spectropolarimetric data for a slsn .",
    "we have gathered two epochs , one pre - peak at -23.7d and the second 27.5 days after maximum light in the rest - frame .      1 .   the presence of a dominant axis and no physical departure from it ; 2 .   a strong wavelength dependence of the polarization spectra ; and 3 .",
    "an increase in the mean degree of polarization from the first to the second epoch of observations    we used our monte carlo toy - code to compare with the data in order to interpret the wavelength dependence and the time evolution of the polarization level .",
    "we calculated polarization spectra for prolate ellipsoidal geometries accounting for electron scattering and resonant line scattering .",
    "we were able to reproduce the wavelength dependence of the polarization by adopting a line opacity distribution for the inner ejecta that is rich in iron - group elements .",
    "this poses some challenges for the observed flux spectra , but further comprehensive modelling with full radiative transfer is required .",
    "we have also show that the evolution of the overall pseudo - continuum level can be replicated via two - zone aspherical ejecta models with an outer zone having a@xmath115 at both epochs and an inner zone showing an increase in the asymmetry from the first ( a@xmath110 ) to the second ( a@xmath111 ) epoch .",
    "these values are calculated for an equatorial viewing angle and thus should be considered as lower limits on the asphericities of the ejecta .",
    "orientations away from the equatorial plane would lead to lower polarization signals and would then require smaller axis ratio values .",
    "in addition , we caution that the specific values derived here ( a@xmath116 and a@xmath115 ) are model dependent .",
    "however , our findings qualitatively demonstrate that the  spectropolarimetry can be reproduced by an ellipsoidal geometry - or alternatively a bipolar geometry - with an inner region that increases its asymmetry as time passes .",
    "the general trend for an increase in polarization with time ( and the implied geometry ) are reminiscent of those observed in stripped - envelope core - collapse sne connected with @xmath114-ray bursts , supporting the possible link between slsne ic and ultra long @xmath114-ray bursts .",
    "among all the suggested scenarios for slsne i , these new data tend to favor a core - collapse explosion and a central inner engine as explanation for the inferred axisymmetric geometry , as well as the increase of the inner asymmetry . this could be achieved with an explosion of a rotating stellar progenitor .",
    "currently , this scenario does not comfortably reproduce the wavelength dependence we observe , since it seems challenging to obtain enough line opacity . on the other hand",
    ", we did not explore other opacity options than a simple iron core and hence a more complete modelling is needed ( including self - consistent spectra and polarimetry ) .    despite the uncertainties that still exist with our relatively simple modelling approach",
    ", the data should drive new initiatives in how to model these data with hydrodynamic simulations .",
    "these models will address questions such as the the geometry ( bipolar or ellipsoidal shapes ) and how an engine driven or interaction scenario could explain the wavelength dependence we observe ( which we interpret as due to line opacity ) .",
    "we also need to know if other slsne i and broad line slsne ii show similar properties .",
    "the next step is to collect further observations of the future nearby ( @xmath117 ) slsne at least at two epochs , ideally one before and one post maximum light . predicting polarization signatures for multi - dimensional hydrodynamic explosion models",
    "will then be required to better investigate the geometry of these explosions .",

    "<S> we find that the wavelength dependence of the polarisation is possibly due to a strong wavelength dependence in the line opacity , while the higher level of polarisation at the second epoch is a consequence of the increase in the asphericity of the inner layers of the ejecta or the fact that the photosphere recedes into less spherical layers . </S>",
    "<S> the geometry of the superluminous supernova results similar to those of stripped - envelope core collapse sne connected with grb , while the overall evolution of the ejecta shape could be consistent with a central engine . </S>"
