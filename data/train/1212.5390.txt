    "for spin - based electronics , spintronics , the manipulation of electron spins in semiconductors is an important issue.@xcite the strong spin - orbit ( so ) interaction in narrow - gap semiconductors , such as inas and insb , has attracted a lot of interest in this context .",
    "@xcite nanowires ( nws ) of such materials have a great potential for the application to the spintronic devices and also to quantum information processing by utilizing the so interaction .",
    "@xcite indeed , the electrical manipulation of single electron spins was reported for quantum dots fabricated on the nws .",
    "@xcite recently , the proximity effect was intensively examined when nws are put on superconductors , for the search of majorana fermions by the combination of so interaction and magnetic field .",
    "@xcite the dc josephson effect was also studied when the nws are connected to two superconductors ( s / nw / s junctions ) .",
    "@xcite in this paper , we theoretically study the effect of strong so interaction on the josephson current through the nws in a magnetic field , which is closely related to the recent experimental results .",
    "@xcite    the josephson current through mesoscopic systems of normal metal or semiconductor has been studied for a long time . at the interfaces between the normal systems and superconductors , the andreev reflection takes place in which an electron ( a hole ) is converted to a hole ( an electron ) .",
    "@xcite as a result , the electron and hole are coherently coupled to each other , forming the andreev bound states in the normal region around the fermi level within the superconducting energy gap @xmath7 .",

    "@xcite in the presence of phase difference @xmath2 between the superconductors , the supercurrent @xmath8 is carried by the andreev bound states when the length of the normal region @xmath9 is much smaller than the coherent length @xmath10 ( short junction ) .",

    "@xcite in the @xmath4-state , the free energy is minimal at @xmath19 , which stems from the zeeman splitting by exchange interaction in the ferromagnet .",
    "the splitting makes the spin - dependent phase shift for electrons in the propagation through the ferromagnet .",
    "since the andreev bound states consist of an electron with spin @xmath20 and a hole with spin @xmath21 , the andreev levels are dependent on the spin in the ferromagnet .",

    "it was investigated by a lot of theoretical groups , for normal metal with magnetic impurities ,  @xcite two - dimensional electron gas ( 2deg ) in semiconductor heterostructures ,  @xcite open quantum dots ( qds ) ,  @xcite qds with tunnel barriers ,  @xcite carbon nanotubes ,  @xcite quantum wires or nws ,  @xcite and others .",

    "the scattering is represented by a random matrix of the orthogonal ensemble in the absence of so interaction and that of the symplectic ensemble in the strong limit of so interaction .",
    "the ensembles are interpolated for the intermediate strength of so interaction .",
    "we show that the interplay between the so interaction and magnetic field results in the breaking of @xmath31 for the andreev levels , in contrast to the case of @xmath29 .",
    "this leads to the anomalous josephson current and the direction - dependent current .",
