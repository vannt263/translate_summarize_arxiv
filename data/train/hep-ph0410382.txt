    "the title of this short review could well be `` lepton flavour and cp violations without neutrinos for neutrino physicists '' since the aim here is to emphasize the impact of the present and near future experiments on charged lepton transitions on ( _ a _ ) the flavour and cp pattern of the new lepton - like states in theories beyond the sm and ( _ b _ ) the neutrino mass models .",
    "indeed , fcnc and cpv are generic problems for theories that postulate new states at the tev scales which is typically the case in string inspired solutions to the hierarchy problem : squark and sleptons in supersymmetric models and kaluza - klein states in models with large compact dimensions .",
    "basically , the problems arise because particles get mass from different , generically unrelated , mechanisms : higgs couplings for the usual fermions , supersymmetry breaking or compactification for the new heavy states .",
    "any misalignment in flavour space or in cp phases between the resulting mass matrices yields fcnc or cpv effective operators from radiative corrections involving the heavy states .",
    "the present experiments already put either strong limits on these misalignments or lower bounds above the tev for the new state masses .",
    "these constraints open a new framework to investigate both the flavour problem and the structure of the new theories , in particular , in the lepton sector .",
    "let us first summarize the basic facts .",
    "- neutrino oscillations require large lepton flavour ( as defined by the charged leptons ) mixing in the effective neutrino mass matrix , but this does not necessarily imply large mixing in the charged sector .    - leptogenesis is viable within the seesaw model for neutrino masses if the yukawa couplings of the neutrinos to the higgs ( _ i.e. , _ the dirac masses ) have sizeable cp phases .    - in the somewhat minimal framework where only the seesaw mechanism to generate neutrino masses is added to the standard model , the lfv&cpv effects in the charged lepton physics are extremely tiny because of the analogue of the gim mechanism : they depend on factors of @xmath2 .    - therefore , if observed in the current or planned experiments , lfv in charged decays ( @xmath3 ) or cpv electric dipole moments ( @xmath4 ) would be signals of new physics beyond the sm and seesaw models around the tev region ( _ e.g. , _ supersymmetry ) .",
    "- conversely , the present and future bounds on these lfv&cpv transitions constrain new physics around the tev region ( _ e.g. , _ supersymmetry ) and require a lfv&cpv inhibition mechanism in the corresponding theories .    -",
    "some of these experiments provide already relevant constraints on radiative corrections from new lfv&cpv couplings in theories at unattainable scales : gut s , seesaw , flavour models ...    we shall emphasize here the last point to demonstrate the importance of these experiments . indeed",
    "they provide already restrictions on the masses and couplings of very heavy states in seesaw and/or gut models from their virtual contributions in radiative corrections to the effective low energy parameters in any new theory in the tev region ( _ e.g. , _ slepton masses in supersymmetry ) .",
    "future experiments will make these constraints even more impressive .",
    "the phenomenological information gathered from lfv&cpv in the charged sector is quite complementary to those provided by measurements of neutrino oscillations or from the assumption of leptogenesis for the generation of the baryon asymmetry in the universe .",
    "this has been discussed in several papers and reviews at a more technical level @xcite and , here , we shall rather illustrate this aspect by comparing the explicit predictions of simple basic models with the available set of experimental data .",
    "the variety of these data are reviewed by m. aoki in these proceedings @xcite , which we refer to for more detailed description of different experiments and prospects and for the relevant bibliography .",
    "it is enough for our discussion to concentrate on the more relevant ones and to just keep the orders of magnitude of the experimental bounds , as shown in table  [ table:1 ] .",
    "notice that electric dipole moments are displayed in units of fm rather than cm - this is kind of more natural in comparing with the anomalous magnetic moments .    [ cols=\"<,<,<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]      +    the value of the new mass scale @xmath5 can be as low as o(@xmath6gev ) without violating the limits on @xmath7 . on the contrary , bounds on @xmath1 already require a suppression of two orders of magnitude in the cp violating effective coupling if @xmath8 o(tev ) .",
    "it is a well known fact that new physics is expected when experiments will go beyond the present tev frontier in order to explain the success of the sm as a very predictive effective theory . even on general grounds ,",
    "the experimental data on lfv&cpv are already providing relevant restrictions on the flavour pattern of this new physics .",
    "supersymmetry is one of the best candidates for the new physics framework and it has many sources of lfv&cpv , in particular , in the slepton mass matrices .",
    "it is worth looking in more detail for the experimental restrictions in the case of supersymmetry since we expect the sparticle masses to remain below the tev scale to avoid excessive fine - tuning in the model .",
    "let us consider msugra models where , by assumption , the slepton masses have no flavour structure and no relevant cp violating phases at the tree - level .",
    "we denote @xmath9 the masses of the scalar leptons associated to the @xmath10 doublets and the @xmath11 singlet respectively and we skip the so - called @xmath12terms for simplicity . in order to estimate the allowed deviations in the alignment in flavour space between @xmath9 and the charged lepton mass matrix , @xmath13",
    ", one usually defines the ratios @xmath14 with @xmath15 and determine the limits on these misalignment ratios as a function of the sfermion and slepton masses from the contributions they induce in lfv decays , and in cpv e.d.m .",
    "if they are complex @xcite .",
    "two examples of these limits are shown in figures  [ fig:1 ] and [ fig:2 ] @xcite in terms of three most relevant parameters : the slepton mass @xmath16 , the gaugino ( bino ) mass @xmath17 and the higgs v.e.v .",
    "angle , @xmath18 .",
    "( -50,-5)@xmath19 ( gev ) ( -220,227)@xmath20 ( gev )    the plots show the allowed flavour misalignment @xmath21 for sparticle masses below @xmath22tev to be already o(@xmath23 )  it will become 30 times smaller with the planned experiments  for the case of @xmath24 , actually a stronger limit than the generic order of magnitude in table  [ table:2 ] ( instead the limits on @xmath25 are much more model dependent due to destructive interference between different contributions ! ) .",
    "this is the lepton counterpart of the supersymmetric flavour problem : the supersymmetric scalar mass generation must be endowed with such a small misalignment between slepton and lepton masses .",
    "however , since the orders of magnitude are close to those expected in radiative corrections , the alignment must be preserved by quantum contributions .",
    "this fact will be exploited in the next section .",
    "( -50,3)@xmath26 ( gev ) ( -227,235)@xmath20 ( gev )     the limits on the phases in slepton mass matrices obtained from the experimental bounds on @xmath1 are even stronger as seen in figure  [ fig:2 ] for the product @xmath27 . indeed , for large @xmath18",
    "their imaginary parts are at most of o(@xmath28 ) , to go down to @xmath29 in the next future !",
    "also notice ( _ cf .",
    "_ table  [ table:2 ] ) that the future measurement of @xmath30 will provide limits comparable with the ones presently extracted from @xmath1 .",
    "it is a remarkable fact that the e.d.m .",
    "experiments are reaching the accuracy needed to put constraints on new physics around the tev scale at the level of radiative corrections .",
    "we now turn to discuss how this fact may tell us of properties of theories at a scale much above the tev region , such as the seesaw models and gut s .",
    "very heavy states that couple to sleptons leave their traces in the slepton mass matrices through their radiative corrections until they decouple from the effective supersymmetric theory . thus , in the ( type i ) seesaw model , the heavy singlet neutrinos are given very large masses , @xmath31 , and couple to the higgs and the light leptons and their sleptons through a yukawa matrix @xmath32 .",
    "correspondingly , they produce a correction to the lfv part of @xmath33 with a misalignment @xmath34 , where the planck mass @xmath35 is the cut - off for effective supergravity .",
    "this misalignment is bounded by the lfv decays @xcite , but only the bound on @xmath21 is really relevant .",
    "the phases generated only by the seesaw radiative loops could produce lepton e.d.m . at observable rates only if the @xmath31 eigenvalues are strongly hierarchical @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , in the simplest versions of su(5 ) gut s , the colour triplet partners of the higgs bosons , must get large masses , @xmath36 , through the doublet - triplet mechanism , while they couple to the right - handed leptons through a yukawa matrix which is approximately @xmath37 , the usual couplings of the up quarks .",
    "correspondingly , radiative corrections are generated to @xmath38 .",
    "they induce and are constrained by lfv decays as well @xcite .",
    "what about cpv corrections to the slepton masses from these heavy neutrinos and colour triplets ?",
    "it has been recently shown @xcite that with su(5 ) gut @xmath39 seesaw one obtains interesting constraints on @xmath32 matrix elements from the @xmath1 experiments , this is shown in figure  [ fig:3 ] @xcite for @xmath40 , where @xmath41 is the phase in the quark ckm matrix .",
    "remember that these limits will be improved by two orders of magnitude .    another way to see the relevance of the restrictions from @xmath1 on new physics is to show that they are competitive with the well - known constraints on the colour triplets masses from proton life - time , @xmath42 @xcite .",
    "let us take for definiteness @xmath43 and `` typical '' sparticle masses , @xmath44 and , _",
    "e.g. _ , @xmath45 , with msugra mass conditions and let us calculate @xmath1 and @xmath42 in the simplest models ( which are not meant to be more theoretically justified , see _",
    "@xcite ) : ( i ) su(5 ) with seesaw and the simplifying assumption , @xmath46 ; ( ii ) so(10 ) with two colour triplets and @xmath47 ; ( iii ) so(10 ) with pseudo - dirac like colour triplets , @xmath48 with @xmath49 .",
    "the results are summarized in table  [ table:3 ] .",
    "@lllll & @xmath50)/ ( @xmath51 & @xmath52 + & @xmath53 & @xmath54 + ( i ) su(5 ) w/ @xmath55 & @xmath56 & @xmath57 + ( ii ) so(10 ) w/ @xmath58 & @xmath56 & @xmath59 + ( iii ) so(10 ) w/ @xmath60 & @xmath61 & @xmath62 +     +    while models i and ii predict @xmath42 much below the experimental value , the pseudo - dirac trick introduces large negative interference between the two massive colour triplets increasing @xmath42 by almost two orders of magnitude ( depending on the various yukawa phases ; note that the quark ckm phase in @xmath37 alone is enough unless it is compensated by the unknown phases ) .",
    "but the supersymmetric so(10 ) models violate the limits on @xmath1 , at least in the simpler versions .",
    "while @xmath42 could be reduced by interference , the different contributions add up in the wave function renormalisation that leads to @xmath1 .",
    "in order to explicitly see the impact of the @xmath24 and @xmath1 experiments on flavour models to explain the fermion masses , including the neutrinos , let us consider the froggatt - nielsen simplest model with an @xmath63 flavour group @xcite .",
    "it is assumed to be broken by field whose v.e.v .",
    "defines a small number @xmath64 with respect to the cut - off scale of the model .",
    "charges are associated to each lepton field as follows : @xmath65 to the doublets @xmath66 , @xmath67 to @xmath68 , @xmath69 to @xmath70 , with @xmath71 as the flavour index , @xmath72 to the two higgses . in this way one obtains , after the @xmath63 breaking , effective yukawa couplings endowed with some kind of hierarchy in the eigenvalues and the mixings in terms of powers of @xmath64 defined by the flavour charges . ordering the heavy right - handed neutrinos by @xmath73",
    ", the present neutrino oscillation data ( mass differences and mixing angles for atmospheric and solar neutrinos ) basically fix the charges : @xmath74 , together with @xmath75 , close to the cabibbo angle that plays a similar role in the construction of quark mass models .",
    "the masses @xmath76 remain arbitrary , but leptogenesis is possible only if @xmath77 . because the @xmath65 are now given , the present experimental limit on @xmath24 requires @xmath78 , for @xmath79 .",
    "the charges @xmath69 are now more or less fixed so that the orders of magnitude of all other lfv&cpv predictions , in particular @xmath1 , come out much below the present experiments . with the expected improvement by a factor 30 in b.r.@xmath80",
    ", one would get @xmath81 and this very popular model is close to be excluded .",
    "what is nice in this exercise is that the constraints from different observables apply to different parameters and complement each other in an explicit way .",
    "the lfv&cpv experiments , mainly @xmath24 and @xmath1  but hopefully also @xmath30 in the near future  are a selective tool for new physics model building .",
    "they provide indirect tests which are already sensitive to physics in the tev region at the level of accuracy of the radiative corrections .",
    "they are pure signals of new phenomena around the tev scale since the sm contributions are definitely negligible .",
    "it is quite remarkable that they also give effective tests of the lfv&cpv in seesaw couplings and in grand - unified theories . in particular , the limits on @xmath1",
    "nicely complement the proton decay bounds in selecting o(10 ) models !",
    "the devised improvements in these experiments are important and theoretically welcome .",
    "the current direct measurement of @xmath30 , improving the present indirect bound , motivates a simple question @xcite : to what extent can the naive relation @xmath82 be violated ?",
    "needless to say , the fact that they are getting into the level of accuracy corresponding to where we do expect the new physics to show up means they are on the way to discover lfv&cpv in charged lepton transitions .",
