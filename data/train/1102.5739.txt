    "ad - hoc network consists of autonomous wireless nodes that collaborate on communicating information in the absence of a fixed infrastructure .",
    "each of the nodes might act as a source / destination node or as a relay , where communication occurs between a source - destination ( s - d ) pair through a single - hop transmission if they are close enough , or through multi - hop transmissions over intermediate relaying nodes if they are far apart from each other .",
    "the selection of the relaying nodes along the multi - hop path is governed by the routing scheme .",
    "takagi and kleinrock @xcite introduced the first position - based routing scheme , coined as _ most forward within radius _",
    "( mfr ) , based on the notion of progress : given a transmitting node @xmath1 and a destination node @xmath2 , the progress at relay node @xmath3 is defined as the projection of the line segment @xmath4 onto the line connecting @xmath1 and @xmath2 . in mfr , each node forwards the packet to the neighbor with the largest progress , or discards the packet if none of its neighbors are closer to the destination than itself .",
    "takagi and kleinrock @xcite also discussed a method in which one of the nodes with forward ( i.e. , positive ) progress is chosen at random , arguing that there is a tradeoff between progress and transmission success .",
    "this scheme bears the closest resemblance to the routing scheme that we consider in this paper , where each node picks the next relay uniformly at random among the nodes in its transmission range over the @xmath0-disk oriented towards the destination .",
    "there are some other variants of mfr in the literature . in @xcite",
    ", the authors introduced the _",
    "nearest forward progress _ ( nfp ) method that selects the nearest neighbor of the transmitter with forward progress ; in @xcite , the _ compass routing _ ( also referred to as dir method ) was proposed , where the neighbor closest to the line connecting the sender and the destination is chosen .",
    "all the aforementioned work lacks rigorous analysis of the conditions for guaranteed packet delivery and the expected hop - count between the s - d pairs .",
    "in particular , most of the existing convergence and hop - count results , based on the notion of progress , ignore the vertical distance of the next hop to the line connecting the current node to the destination , which has a considerable effect on the packet delivery as the packet gets closer to the destination .",
    "for other relaying schemes , there have been some results on routing convergence analysis . in particular , xing et al .",
    "@xcite showed that the delivery can be guaranteed between any s - d pair using the _ greedy forwarding scheme _ ( gfr ) , if the transmission radius is larger than twice the sensing radius in a fully covered homogeneous wireless sensor network . in @xcite",
    ", the authors derived the critical transmission radius that ensures the network connectivity asymptotically based on the gfr scheme .    in this paper , we elaborate on the sufficient conditions for asymptotically guaranteed packet delivery of the random @xmath0-disk routing scheme and derive bounds on the expected number of hops that a packet traverses to reach its destination .",
    "the remainder of this paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec : systemmodel ] we introduce the system model and define the notion of convergence for geometric routing schemes , based on _ connectivity _ and _ finite hop - count _ properties .",
    "then , we explain the localized properties that ensure the convergence of the random @xmath0-disk routing scheme with probability approaching one as the network density goes to infinity . in section [ sec :",
    "connectivity ] , we establish conditions on the node transmission range that ensure connectivity for the @xmath0-disk routing scheme in a dense network . in section [ sec : hopnumber ] , we derive bounds on the expected number of hops between an arbitrary source - destination pair and show that all packets will almost surely reach their destinations in finitely many hops if the network is connected .",
    "section [ sec : conclusion ] concludes the paper .",
    "let @xmath5 be the area of a convex region @xmath6 over which the network resides .",
    "network nodes are distributed according to a homogeneous poisson point process with density @xmath7 .",
    "each node picks a destination node uniformly at random among all other nodes in the network , and operates with a transmission range @xmath8 .    for a general geometric routing scheme ,",
    "when the destination is out of the one - hop transmission range of a given source / relay node , the next relay is selected ( based on some rule ) among the nodes contained in the _ relay selection region _ ( rsr ) of the transmitting node , where the rsr in general can be any subset of a full disk of radius @xmath8 centered at the transmitting node .",
    "we define the rule that governs the selection of the next relay in each node s rsr as the _ relay selection rule _",
    "( rsl ) . note that a node can potentially act as a _ relay _ only if it is contained in the rsr of the current source / relay .",
    "we define the _ convergence _ of a routing scheme as follows .",
    "[ convthm ] a routing scheme is _ convergent _ if the following two conditions are satisfied :    1 .",
    "_ connectivity _ : between each pair of nodes in the network that are not already in the transmission range of one another , there exists a sequence of relays complying with the rsl .",
    "finite hop - count _ : given such sequences determined in the connectivity condition above , their cardinalities are finite .    specifically , in this paper we study a special case of the localized geometric routing schemes , namely the _ random @xmath0-disk routing scheme _ , where for each transmitting node @xmath1 in the network , as illustrated in fig . [",
    "fig : routingscheme ] , the next relay @xmath3 is chosen _ randomly _ among the nodes contained in the _ @xmath0-disk _ of radius @xmath8 centered at node @xmath1 and oriented towards the packet destination @xmath2 . hence , the name _",
    "random @xmath0-disk routing scheme _ is coined .",
    "we denote the relay selection region and the relay selection rule of the random @xmath0-disk routing scheme by @xmath9rsr and rrsl , respectively .",
    "observe that according to our routing scheme , the next chosen relay might be farther away from the destination than the current node .",
    "this fact differentiates our routing scheme from gfr @xcite and its variants .",
    "-disk routing scheme.,width=3 ]    note that for the network to be connected based on any geometric routing scheme , the connectivity condition in definition [ convthm ] requires the existence of rsl - compliant routing paths between all source - destination pairs in the network .",
    "in particular , the network is connected under the random @xmath0-disk routing scheme if the @xmath9rsrs of every node @xmath1 in the network contain at least one node with high probability ( note that the @xmath9rsr of node @xmath1 can be oriented in any direction that @xmath2 may exist ) .",
    "this ensures the existence of a relaying node in every direction of a particular transmitting node and ascertains the possibility of packet delivery to a particular destination from any direction .",
    "in fact , a node has a possible relay / destination in any direction if and only if it can serve as relay / destination from any direction .",
    "now , given that the network is connected , the packets are guaranteed to be delivered to their destinations , according to the random @xmath0-disk routing scheme , if the cardinality of the rrsl - compliant relay sequence ( i.e. , the number of hops ) starting from the source and ending at the destination is finite almost surely . in the following , theorem [ thm1 ] presents the main result of this paper regarding the convergence of the @xmath0-disk routing scheme .",
    "for notational convenience , we let @xmath10 designate the expected number of nodes in the network region of area @xmath5 and @xmath11 denote the normalized area of a full disk of radius @xmath8 relative to the area of the whole region , such that @xmath12 is the expected number of nodes in such a disk .",
    "also , @xmath13 means that there exist positive constants @xmath14 and @xmath15 such that @xmath16 whenever @xmath17 , and @xmath18 means that there exist positive constants @xmath14 , @xmath19 and @xmath15 such that @xmath20 whenever @xmath17 .",

    "here we only sketch the outline of the proof and present the respective details in the following sections . according to definition [ convthm ]",
    ", we need to show that asymptotically ( i.e. , as @xmath23 ) a ) the network is connected based on the random @xmath0-disk routing scheme ; and b ) given a connected network , the random @xmath0-disk routing scheme delivers each packet to its destination in a finite number of hops .    in section [ sec : connectivity ] , regarding condition",
    "a ) described above , we derive the upper bound @xmath24 on the probability that some nodes in the network are not connected to the rest of the network .",
    "then we determine conditions that ensure the convergence of @xmath24 to zero as @xmath25 .",
    "this establishes the sufficient conditions for the network to be connected with probability approaching one as @xmath23 .    in section [ sec : hopnumber ] , regarding condition",
    "b ) described above , we show that given a connected network , the number of hops that each packet traverses to reach its destination with the proposed routing scheme is finite almost surely , by modeling the distance evolution of the packet to its destination as a markov process .",
    "this , together with the results in section [ sec : connectivity ] , concludes the proof for the asymptotic convergence of the random @xmath0-disk routing scheme .",
    "as mentioned earlier , the network is connected if there exists a sequence of rrsl - compliant relays between any two nodes of the network , which are not already in the transmission range of each other . hence , the problem of proving connectivity amounts to bounding the probability @xmath24 that there exist some network nodes which are not connected to the rest of the network .",
    "a node is connected to the rest of the network if it has a possible relay / destination in any direction , which is equivalent to being able to serve as relay / destination from any direction .",
    "thus , @xmath24 equals the probability that , for some network nodes , there are certain directions at which their @xmath9rsrs are empty .",
    "we can identify two types of network nodes based on their distances to the edge of the network : nodes that are farther than @xmath8 away from the edge of the network , which we call _ interior nodes _ , and nodes that are closer than @xmath8 to the edge of the network , which we call _ edge nodes_.    for interior nodes , it is clear that the node distribution in their @xmath9rsrs , looking in any direction , is similar .",
    "therefore , the existence probability of an empty @xmath9rsr for an interior node is independent of its direction .",
    "however , due to the proximity of edge nodes to the boundary of the network , the existence probability of an empty @xmath9rsr for an edge node highly depends on its orientation .",
    "for example , the @xmath9rsrs that fall partly outside the network region are more likely to be empty than the ones that are fully contained in the network region .",
    "hence , we derive the probabilities of a node being disconnected from the rest of the network separately for the interior nodes and the edge nodes , denoted by @xmath26 and @xmath27 , respectively .",
    "we now slightly generalize the problem as follows .",
    "suppose that the rsr of a node is instead a wedge of angle @xmath28 and radius @xmath8 , with @xmath29 ( hereafter called @xmath30-disk or @xmath30rsr , interchangeably ) .",
    "hence , the @xmath9rsr is a special case of @xmath30-disk with @xmath31 .",
    "each @xmath30-disk has an expected number of nodes @xmath32 . as shown in section [ calculationofsigma ] , the probability of network disconnectivity increases as @xmath30 decreases .",
    "however , we conjecture that the packet reaches its destination with fewer hops as @xmath30 decreases .",
    "hence , there may exist a tradeoff between the probability of network disconnectivity and the expected number of hops between a s - d pair parameterized by @xmath30 .",
    "we leave the study of this tradeoff to a future work and only derive ( in section [ sec : hopnumber ] ) the expected number of hops between a source and its destination for the case of @xmath31 .",
    "consider an interior node @xmath33 , fixed for now .",
    "given @xmath34 nodes in the transmission range of @xmath33 , their directions ( in reference to @xmath33 ) are independent and uniformly distributed on @xmath35 $ ] .",
    "the probability that @xmath33 is not connected to the rest of the network equals the probability @xmath36 that the angle of the widest wedge containing none of these @xmath37 nodes is at least @xmath38 .",
    "it is not difficult to give a simple upper bound on @xmath36 : of the @xmath37 nodes , without loss of generality ( w.l.o.g . )",
    ", we can assume that ( at least ) one is at one end of an empty wedge with angle of @xmath39 , while the other @xmath40 are distributed independently and uniformly in the remainder of the full transmission disk , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : emptyarc ] .",
    "note that , by assuming uniform ( and independent ) distribution for the remaining @xmath40 nodes over the remainder of the transmission disk , we are also taking into account the possibility of an effective empty wedge with an angle @xmath41 greater than @xmath39 , as suggested in fig .",
    "[ fig : emptyarc ] .",
    "hence , we obtain @xmath42 . of course ,",
    "if @xmath43 the probability is @xmath44 .",
    ".,width=3 ]    one can obtain the a more precise expression for @xmath36 using results in @xcite , page 188 as :    @xmath45    where @xmath46 is the largest integer smaller than @xmath33 .",
    "this expression is based on the inclusion - exclusion principle for the probability of the union of events , for which the first summand provides an upper bound and the first two summands provide a lower bound .    therefore ,",
    "averaging over @xmath37 ( number of the nodes in the transmission range of @xmath33 ) and over the number of interior nodes , we have :    @xmath47 \\nonumber \\\\ % & = \\big(1-(2-\\sqrt{d})\\sqrt{d}\\big)n\\bigg[e^{-dn } + dne^{-\\eta dn}\\bigg ] \\nonumber \\\\ & \\leq \\big(1 - 2\\sqrt{d}\\big)n(dn+1)e^{-\\eta dn},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath48 is the expected number of interior nodes if , for simplicity , we assume that the network region is a disk of radius @xmath49 .",
    "so far we have considered the interior nodes which are well away from the boundary of the network region .",
    "now , we consider edge nodes which are closer than @xmath8 to the edge of the network and do not have any nodes in the portion of their transmission ranges that falls outside of the network region . therefore , some @xmath30-disks ( of an edge node ) may fall partially ( up to half ) outside the region , which increases the chance that they are empty .",
    "we refer to this phenomenon as _ edge effect_. assuming the network region is circular , the number of such edge nodes equals @xmath50 , which is of order @xmath51 .",
    "we need to determine how their contribution to the bound on probability of connectivity differs from the previous computations .",
    "consider an edge node @xmath52 , @xmath53-distance away from the network edge , with @xmath54 .",
    "define angle @xmath55 to be perpendicular to the network edge and pointing towards the edge with node @xmath52 as the origin ; in other words , as shown in fig . [",
    "fig : edgecurvature ] , we take node @xmath52 as the pole and the ray @xmath56 ( perpendicular to the network edge ) as the polar axis of the _ local _ ( polar ) coordinates at node @xmath52 .",
    "we observe that , due to the curvature of the network edge , the overlap of node @xmath52 s transmission range with the network region is larger than what it would be if the network s edge were straight ( i.e. , the line passing through the intersection points @xmath57 and @xmath58 in fig . [",
    "fig : edgecurvature ] ) .",
    "this area difference ( the shaded area in fig .",
    "[ fig : edgecurvature ] ) is no larger than @xmath59 containing an expected number of nodes on the order of @xmath60 , where the maximum area difference is obtained when node @xmath52 is located on the straight network edge approximation ( i.e. , in the middle of @xmath61 in fig .",
    "[ fig : edgecurvature ] ) .",
    "accordingly , we make a further simplifying assumption that @xmath21 ; this is equivalent to a practical assumption that the ratio between the transmission range @xmath8 and the radius @xmath62 of the network region goes to zero fast enough such that the expected number of nodes in the shaded area of fig .",
    "[ fig : edgecurvature ] goes to zero as @xmath63 .",
    "then the error in calculating the probability of any event in the following will be a factor of no more than @xmath64 , where @xmath15 is a finite constant .",
    "henceforth , we proceed as if the network region is straight where it intersects with the node s transmission disk for large @xmath65 .",
    "-disk with the network region.,width=2 ]    we argued in the beginning of this section that , for edge node @xmath52 , the probability of an @xmath30-disk being empty , depends highly on its orientation .",
    "let us consider this claim more closely .",
    "let @xmath66 , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : area ] , where @xmath67 is the distance between node @xmath52 and the straight approximation of the network edge as defined before with @xmath68 .",
    "note that all the @xmath30-disks are oriented towards the destination of the packets .",
    "hence , for all @xmath30-disks that are oriented toward an angle in the range @xmath69 , we must have that the destination is within node @xmath52 s transmission range . therefore",
    ", we only need to be concerned with empty @xmath30-disks oriented towards an angle in the range @xmath70 .",
    "the @xmath30-disks oriented to an angle in either the range @xmath71 or the range @xmath72 are partially outside the network region , as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : area ] , and those oriented to any angle in @xmath73 are fully contained inside the network region ; this defines the effective @xmath30rsr range for node @xmath52 .",
    "note that here , all the angles are measured relative to the polar axis @xmath56 .",
    "we now compute @xmath27 for node @xmath52 .",
    "first , suppose that there are _ no _ nodes within the transmission range of node @xmath52 ; this event occurs with probability no greater than @xmath74 , which corresponds to the case where node @xmath52 s transmission disk is half outside the network region .",
    "therefore , the probability that some edge nodes having no other nodes within their transmission ranges is upper - bounded by @xmath75 .",
    "second , suppose that there are @xmath34 nodes in the intersection of node @xmath52 s transmission range with the network region . if an empty @xmath30-disk exists and it is completely contained within the network region , then , w.l.o.g . , there should be a node on its counter - clockwise edge - disk ) that over its counter - clockwise direction , the entire @xmath30-disk is located , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : area ] . ] at some angle @xmath76 .",

    "clearly , the existence probability of such empty @xmath30-disks ( that is partially contained in the region ) increases as either @xmath79 or @xmath80 decreases .",
    "the area of the intersection between the @xmath30-disk ( that is partially contained in the region ) and the network region is that of a wedge with angle @xmath81 ( wedge @xmath82 in fig .",

    "[ fig : area ] ) with area no more than @xmath84 .",
    "in fact if , for an arbitrary small @xmath85 , either @xmath86 or @xmath87 , then the area of the intersection between @xmath30-disk and the network region is at least @xmath88 . otherwise , it is at least @xmath89 .",
    "thus , after averaging over @xmath79 and @xmath90 ( note that the number of nodes approximately @xmath67 from the edge is uniformly distributed with an expected value proportional to @xmath91 when @xmath92 is very small ) , the probability that node @xmath52 is disconnected from the rest of the network is derived to be no more than    @xmath93 + 12\\pi\\epsilon^2e^{-\\eta dn/2 } \\leq e^{-(\\eta/2+\\epsilon)dn } + 12\\pi\\epsilon^2e^{-\\eta dn/2},\\ ] ]    where @xmath94 is an upper bound on the probability that @xmath95 and @xmath96 , and @xmath97 is the probability that the whole empty @xmath30-disk falls within the network region .",

    "subsequently , accounting for the expected @xmath12 nodes in node @xmath52 s transmission range and the expected @xmath100 edge nodes , we obtain the upper bound on the probability that some edge nodes are not connected to the rest of the network as :    @xmath101    where the second summand on the right - hand side is the probability that some edge nodes have no other nodes within their transmission ranges .",
    "finally , summing and , we obtain the bound @xmath24 on the probability that the network is not connected : @xmath102    this bound on @xmath24 is valid for all @xmath65 and @xmath21 , and is asymptotic to @xmath103 which goes to zero if @xmath22 as @xmath23 .",
    "particularly , assuming @xmath104 and @xmath105 results in the network being connected with probability approaching one as @xmath63 , which shows the consistency between our result and the ones derived in @xcite and @xcite for @xmath106 .",
    "assuming that the network is connected as stated in definition [ convthm ] , we now investigate the question of how many hops it takes for a packet to traverse from the source to its destination with the random @xmath0-disk routing scheme . to answer this question we need to have a mathematical description of the process that models the distance evolution from a typical packet to its destination .    specifically , we set the intended destination node at the origin and assume that the packet starts at the source node @xmath107 , where @xmath108 is the ( cartesian ) coordinate of the packet and @xmath109 is the ( euclidean ) distance from the packet to its destination at time @xmath110 .",

    "note that throughout this section we assume that the network is connected , i.e. , @xmath133 for all @xmath134 , unless otherwise stated .    since tracking the dependence of @xmath127 on all @xmath131 , @xmath135 is tedious , in this work we only investigate the dependence of @xmath127 on @xmath130 and @xmath136 and in particular , determine how close is the distribution of the nodes in @xmath122 to a uniform distribution when just knowing the location of the previous node @xmath136 . ,",

    "this is because there are only finitely many previous relays whose @xmath9rsr might intersect with @xmath122 , and we can assume , as a worst case scenario , that all of them have roughly similar and independent effects on the node distribution in @xmath122 . ] note that conditional on @xmath130 ( or equivalently on @xmath122 ) and network being connected ( @xmath133 ) , @xmath126 has a poisson distribution with intensity @xmath140 , given it is positive ( non - zero ) .",

    "[ fig : routingschemebound ] , we rewrite as    @xmath169    where @xmath170 is the projection of @xmath171 onto the _ local _ cartesian coordinates with the current node as the origin and the @xmath33 axis pointing from the current node to the destination . based on proposition [ prop1 ] ,",
    "@xmath170 is distributed uniformly on @xmath122 which makes the markov approximation of .",
    "define @xmath172 , for @xmath173 as the first time that the packet gets closer than @xmath174 to the destination .",
    "hence , @xmath175 represents the first time the packet enters the reception range of the destination and @xmath176 indicates the number of hops that a packet traverses to reach its destination .",
    "it is easy to show that @xmath177 is a stopping time @xcite .",
    "it is clear that    @xmath178    furthermore , let @xmath179 .",
    "we observe that @xmath180 is a decreasing function over @xmath174 , for fixed @xmath181 .",
    "thus , for @xmath182 , we have @xmath183 and    @xmath184    hence , we have    @xmath185    note , as well , that ( refer to appendix [ sec : expecting ] )    @xmath186    now , applying wald s equality to and and rearranging , we obtain a bound on the expected value of the stopping time @xmath177 :    @xmath187    substituting @xmath174 with @xmath8 we obtain a general bound for the expected number of hops that a packet traverses to reach the destination ( minus one ) as :    @xmath188    this implies that the packet reaches its destination almost surely ( a.s . ) in a finite number of steps when the network is connected , which happens with probability no less than @xmath189 as obtained in . specifically , with @xmath190 as @xmath23 , we have @xmath191 .",
    "moreover , when the ratio @xmath192 ( i.e. , the ratio between the source - destination distance and the transmission range ) is large , we can obtain a tighter bound on the expected number of hops between a source - destination pair that are @xmath193 apart . since @xmath194 , we must have @xmath195 .",
    "thus , by and proper substitutions , we have    @xmath196    for all @xmath197 . from this , it is easy to deduce that    @xmath198    this implies that as @xmath199 , the expected number of hops a packet traverses between a source and its destination is asymptotic to @xmath200 .",
    "furthermore , we can determine the expected initial distance @xmath193 between an arbitrary source - destination pair in the network by deriving the expected distance between any two points that are randomly located inside the network area .",
    "the problem of quantifying @xmath193 is well studied in the literature @xcite , with the following known results for two special convex network regions : if the region is a planar disc with diameter @xmath201 , we have @xmath202 ; and if it is a square with side length @xmath201 , we have @xmath203 .",
    "in this paper , we determined the sufficient conditions for a localized routing scheme , namely the random @xmath0-disk routing scheme , to be convergent based on a convergence notion that not only considers the feasibility of packet delivery to the destination via possibly multi - hop relaying , but also requires the packet delivery to occur in finitely many hops . to this end , we showed that , given certain conditions , there exists a sequence of relays complying with the @xmath0-disk routing scheme between any two nodes in the network with probability approaching one as the ( network ) node density goes to infinity .",
    "furthermore , we showed that given a network satisfying those conditions , the random @xmath0-disk routing scheme will deliver the packets to their destinations in finitely many hops almost surely , by modeling the distance evolution from a packet to its destination as a markov process .",
    "first , let us consider the distribution of a poisson point process conditioned on deleting one point .",
    "let @xmath65 be a homogeneous poisson point process with intensity @xmath7 and fix a region @xmath204 .",
    "if @xmath205 , one point in @xmath204 is selected at random and removed .",
    "let @xmath206 be the location of that point .",
    "the distribution of @xmath65 on @xmath207 remains poisson and independent of @xmath65 on @xmath204 , and thus independent of both @xmath208 and @xmath206 .",
    "let @xmath209 be the ( point ) process with the point at @xmath206 deleted .",
    "let @xmath210 be a partition of @xmath204 .",
    "given @xmath205 , the points in @xmath204 are distributed uniformly .",
    "if one point is removed at random , the remaining points are still distributed uniformly on @xmath204 .",
    "hence ,    @xmath211    since @xmath212 . therefore , conditional on @xmath213 ,",
    "@xmath209 is independent of @xmath206 . in particular ,    @xmath214    furthermore , given @xmath215 , we have    @xmath216    thus , for @xmath217 and given @xmath218 , @xmath219 is conditionally @xmath220 . without knowing @xmath221 , however , we obtain from that    @xmath222    where the second equality is due to    @xmath223    after the aforementioned preliminaries , we now proceed with the proof of proposition [ prop1 ] .",
    "suppose @xmath120 is a random set that depends only on @xmath206 .",
    "the points of @xmath209 , if any , that are in @xmath224 are uniformly distributed and independent of the points in @xmath225 , which also are uniformly distributed ( if any ) .",
    "the combined points are uniformly distributed on @xmath120 _ only if _ the expected proportion of points in @xmath226 is @xmath227 .    however , it is not in our case as we now compute .",
    "given @xmath228 , the probability that a randomly selected point in @xmath120 also is in @xmath204 is @xmath229 .",
