    "the critical behavior of magnetic systems in the presence of quenched disorder has been the subject of extensive theoretical and experimental study .",
    "an important class of systems is formed by amorphous alloys of rare earths with aspherical electron distribution and transition metals , for instance tbfe@xmath6 and yfe@xmath6 .",
    "these systems are modeled @xcite by the heisenberg model with random uniaxial single - site anisotropy , or , in short , by the random - anisotropy model ( ram ) @xmath7 where @xmath8 is an @xmath9-component spin variable , @xmath10 is a unit vector describing the local ( spatially uncorrelated ) random anisotropy , and @xmath11 the anisotropy strength . in amorphous alloys",
    "the distribution of @xmath10 is usually taken to be isotropic , since in the absence of crystalline order there is no preferred direction .",
    "on the other hand , in polycrystalline materials , for instance in the laves - phase intermetallic ( dy@xmath12y@xmath13)al@xmath6 compounds studied in refs .",
    "@xcite , the distribution of @xmath10 is expected to have only the lattice symmetry .    the critical behavior , and in particular the nature of the low - temperature phase , of a generic system with random anisotropy depends on the probability distribution of the random vector @xmath10 .",
    "in the isotropic case , i.e. when the probability distribution is uniformly weighted over the @xmath14-dimensional sphere , the imry - ma argument @xcite forbids the appearance of a low - temperature phase with nonvanishing magnetization for @xmath15 .",
    "this still allows the presence of a finite - temperature transition with a low - temperature phase in which correlation functions decay algebraically , as it happens in the two - dimensional xy model .",
    "such a behavior has been predicted for the ram with isotropic distribution in ref .",
    "@xcite and it has been recently supported by a @xmath16 study @xcite using the functional renormalization group ( rg ) @xcite . on the other hand , standard field - theoretical perturbative approaches do not find any evidence for a critical behavior with long - range correlations @xcite .",
    "while experiments have not yet found evidence of low - temperature quasi long - range order , numerical simulations seem to confirm the picture of refs .",
    "@xcite , but are still contradictory as far as universality and behavior in the strong - anisotropy regime are concerned @xcite . for these reasons , the critical behavior of the ram can still be considered as an open problem .",
    "the above arguments do not apply to spin models with the discrete anisotropic distribution introduced in ref .",
    "@xcite , in which the vector @xmath10 points only along one of the @xmath9 lattice axes , i.e. it has the probability distribution @xmath17 ,   \\label{cdistr}\\ ] ] where @xmath18 is a unit vector which points in the positive @xmath19 direction .",
    "this model , which we shall call random cubic anisotropic model ( rcam ) , should have a standard order - disorder transition : the random discrete cubic anisotropy should stabilize a low - temperature phase with long - range ferromagnetic order . on the basis of two - loop calculations in field - theoretical frameworks ,",
    "it has been argued @xcite that the transition belongs to the universality class of the random - exchange ising model ( reim ) for any number @xmath9 of components .    in this paper",
    "we study the critical properties of the three - dimensional rcam .",
    "we consider the field - theoretical approach based on the landau - ginzburg - wilson @xmath20 hamiltonian @xcite @xmath21 + \\frac{1}{4 ! } \\sum_{ijab } ( u_0 + v_0\\delta_{ij } + w_0\\delta_{ab}+y_0\\delta_{ij}\\delta_{ab } ) \\phi_{ai}^2\\phi_{bj}^2 \\right\\ } , \\label{lgwcram } \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath22 and @xmath23 . in the limit @xmath24",
    "the hamiltonian ( [ lgwcram ] ) is expected to describe the critical behavior of the rcam for @xmath9-component spins .",
    "using nonperturbative arguments , we show that the field theory with hamiltonian ( [ lgwcram ] ) has two stable fixed points ( fp s ) .",
    "one of them belongs to the reim universality class while the other corresponds to the o(@xmath25 ) model in the limit @xmath24 , the so - called self - avoiding - walk universality class .",
    "then , we investigate the rg flow for the model with hamiltonian ( [ lgwcram ] ) in the framework of a fixed - dimension expansion in powers of appropriate zero - momentum quartic couplings .",
    "we compute the corresponding callan - symanzik @xmath3-functions to five loops .",
    "their analysis shows that the only accessible stable fp from the region of parameters relevant for the rcam is the reim fp .",
    "this implies that the critical behavior of the rcam ( when the parameters allow a continuous transition ) belongs to the reim universality class , whose critical exponents are @xcite @xmath26 , @xmath27 , @xmath28 , etc .",
    "the approach to the reim scaling behavior is characterized by very slowly decaying scaling corrections proportional to @xmath29 with @xmath30 , which is much smaller than the scaling - correction exponent of the reim , which is @xcite @xmath31 .",
    "our results fully confirm and put on a firmer ground the conclusions of refs .",
    "@xcite based on two - loop perturbative calculations .",
    "it is important to note that our results are specific of distributions that vanish everywhere outside the lattice axes , such as the one given in eq .",
    "( [ cdistr ] ) . indeed , generic cubic - symmetric distributions @xmath32 , and in particular the isotropic one , give rise to an additional quartic term that should be added to the effective hamiltonian ( [ lgwcram ] ) , i.e. @xmath33 the reim fp is unstable with respect to this perturbation",
    ". we shall evaluate the corresponding crossover exponent , finding @xmath34 . therefore , even small differences from the discrete distribution @xmath35 cause a crossover to a different critical behavior .",
    "nonetheless , when @xmath35 turns out to be a good effective approximation  this might be the case in some crystalline cubic - symmetric random - anisotropy systems  reim critical behavior may be observed in a preasymptotic region .",
    "the general landau - ginzburg - wilson hamiltonian ( [ lgwcram ] ) can also be recovered by considering systems with cubic anisotropy such that disorder preserves the symmetry @xmath36 , @xmath37 , @xmath38 .",
    "a general hamiltonian with this property is given by @xmath39 where @xmath40 and @xmath41 is a random vector with a probability distribution that is invariant under the interchange @xmath42 .",
    "the exact reflection symmetry at fixed disorder  this symmetry is not present in generic models of type ( [ hram])is the key property that allows the rcam and the more general class of models ( [ hrcam - gen ] ) to have a standard order - disorder transition with a low - temperature magnetized phase .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec1 ] we apply the replica method to the @xmath20 theory corresponding to models ( [ hram ] ) and ( [ hrcam - gen ] ) , determining the corresponding @xmath43 hamiltonians that are the basis of the field - theoretical approach . in sec .",
    "[ sec2 ] we discuss some general properties of the theory ( [ lgwcram ] ) . in particular , we discuss the crossover behavior when randomness is weak , and we prove that the reim fp is stable by evaluating its stability eigenvalues . in sec .",
    "[ sec3 ] we investigate the rg flow by computing and analyzing the five - loop fixed - dimension expansion of the @xmath3-functions associated with the zero - momentum quartic couplings . in app .",
    "[ quadrop ] we report a six - loop calculation of the rg dimensions of the bilinear operators in cubic - symmetric models that are used in the discussion of the stability of the fp s .",
    "[ betaided ] reports the proof of some identities used in the paper .",
    "the mapping of the ram hamiltonian ( [ hram ] ) to an effective translationally - invariant @xmath43 hamiltonian was originally discussed in ref .  @xcite . in order to replace fixed - length spins with uncostrained variables ,",
    "one performs a hubbard - stratonovich transformation .",
    "then , for the purpose of studying the critical behavior one considers the continuum limit of the resulting hamiltonian and truncates its potential to fourth order .",
    "this leads to an effective continuum @xmath20 hamiltonian for an @xmath9-component real field @xmath45 @xmath46 , \\label{heff } \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath10 is an external spatially uncorrelated vector field with parity - symmetric distribution @xmath32 and @xmath47 is proportional to @xmath11 .",
    "we relax here the condition @xmath48 and require only that @xmath49 , thereby fixing the normalization of @xmath47 . using the standard replica trick it is possible to replace the quenched average with an annealed one .",
    "the system is replaced by @xmath25 noninteracting copies with annealed disorder .",

    "this is achieved if the distribution @xmath32 is such that @xmath56 this condition is satisfied if @xmath57 is cubic symmetric . under this further assumption",
    ", the fourth moment @xmath58 can be written as @xmath59 where @xmath60 and @xmath61 are parameters depending on the distribution that satisfy the cauchy inequalities @xmath62 and @xmath63 .",

    "it should be noticed that such a term arises naturally if one considers that , if the system is only cubic symmetric , quartic single - ion terms must be included . in this case",
    "it is natural to consider @xmath68 and the corresponding @xmath20 hamiltonian @xmath69 . \\label{heff2 } \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the hamiltonian ( [ lgwgen ] ) was originally introduced in ref .",
    "@xcite to describe magnetic systems with single - ion anisotropy and nonmagnetic impurities .",
    "there are two interesting particular cases .",
    "first , one may consider an @xmath70-invariant pure system coupled to an isotropic distribution @xmath57 . in this case @xmath71 in eq .",
    "( [ hram2])therefore , @xmath72and @xmath73 in eq .",
    "( [ mabcd ] ) , so that @xmath74 .",
    "these conditions are preserved under renormalization by the presence of the @xmath70 invariance .",
    "note that this is not the case if @xmath75 , i.e. if @xmath76 .",
    "distributions such that @xmath77 ( these distributions are not necessarily isotropic ) give apparently @xmath74 ; however , such a condition is not preserved under renormalization if @xmath78 .",
    "a second interesting case corresponds to distributions @xmath57 such that @xmath79 in eq .",
    "( [ mabcd ] ) .",
    "it is easy to show that distributions @xmath57 with this property are simple generalizations of the distribution ( [ cdistr ] ) .",
    "explicitly , they have the form @xmath80 where @xmath81 is a normalized probability distribution with unit variance . if @xmath82 , eq .",
    "( [ hrepl3 ] ) implies @xmath83 .",
    "such a condition is stable under renormalization . indeed ,",
    "the transformation @xmath84 for fixed @xmath19 and @xmath85 is a symmetry of the hamiltonian with @xmath83 , but not of the term proportional to @xmath86 .",
    "this symmetry is due to the fact that , for distributions of type ( [ rcam - distr ] ) , we can write @xmath87 , which is symmetric under the transformations @xmath88 at fixed @xmath89 . in other words , the theory with @xmath83 describes models in which the reflection symmetry of the spins is also preserved at fixed disorder .    in the case of discrete cubic - symmetric distributions of type ( [ rcam - distr ] ) , we have @xmath90 apparently , these conditions imply @xmath91 where the last condition follows from the bound @xmath92 .",
    "the equality @xmath93 is obtained by using distribution ( [ cdistr ] ) .",
    "relations ( [ rcampar ] ) and ( [ inequalities ] ) should be considered as indicative , since the mapping between the @xmath20 hamiltonian ( [ heff2 ] ) and the general hamiltonian ( [ lgwgen ] ) gives also rise to higher - order terms .",
    "it is also interesting to consider the effective continuum hamiltonian corresponding to eq .",
    "( [ hrcam - gen ] ) . in this case",
    "we obtain @xmath94 .",

    "finally , note that if @xmath104 then we have @xmath103 .",
    "such a condition is stable under renormalization , and thus this class of models is expected to have a different critical behavior .",
    "it corresponds to the one of the randomly dilute cubic models discussed in ref .",
    "distributions with this property are however quite peculiar .",
    "they have the general form @xmath105    the stability region of the quartic potential in the @xmath20 hamiltonian ( [ lgwcram ] ) is given by the conditions @xmath106 however , as discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite , in the zero - replica limit @xmath24 , the only relevant stability conditions are those obtained by using replica - symmetric configurations .",

    "the properties of the rg flow are essentially determined by its fp s .",
    "most of them can be identified by considering the theories obtained when some of the quartic parameters vanish .",
    "for example , we can easily recognize :                          the fp s of these theories are also fp s of the enlarged model ( [ lgwcram ] ) .",
