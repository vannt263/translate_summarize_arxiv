    "a qubit coupled with a quantum oscillator is the simplest model in quantum system , yet is an abundance of applications both in theoretical and practical aspects .",
    "its dynamics is described by the rabi hamiltonian @xcite",
    ". however , its analytical solutions is still unavailable .",
    "many approximations are applied . among them , the rotation wave approximation ( rwa ) @xcite and adiabatic approximation ( aa ) are major ones . under weak coupling and near resonant condition , it has been solved analytically by the method of rwa by discarding the non - energy - conserving terms , and is also called the jaynes - cumming model in quantum optics@xcite . in the opposite condition , that is , the strong coupling and large detuning , it is investigate by the adiabatic approximation ( aa ) and generalized rwa @xcite-@xcite .",
    "the aa method assumed large detuning and first only treat the quantum oscillator influenced by the qubit through the coupling , then solve the whole system by treating the qubit as a perturbation .",
    "further assumption of the qubit must be made for its solutions in aa method , that is why sometimes called it adiabatic approximation .",
    "the adiabatic assumption requires that the qubit as a perturbation does not have influence on the transition of the quantum oscillator from its different number states and discards these transition terms concerning the displaced number states and solved it accordingly .",
    "because recent achievements in circuit qed make the strong or even the ultrastrong coupling regime of light matter interaction achievable@xcite-@xcite , this in turn renews the theoretical interesting in qubit under adiabatic approximation .",
    "further extensions are made by replacing the qubit by two qubit and n - qubits or linear coupling by non - linear ones , etc @xcite-@xcite .    in the paper , we will restudy the qubit coupled strongly with quantum oscillator and focus on the rationality of the adiabatic assumption .",
    "though physically the low energy of the qubit can not promotes the transition of the oscillator to its different displaced number states , these omitting terms sometimes are larger than the keeped terms of the transition of the same number states displaced differently .",
    "so we will make a scrutiny into the adiabatic approximation and a generalized approximation is given and its new results are discussed .",
    "section 2 reviews the adiabatic approximation in the study of the qubit and quantum oscillator coupled system and section 3 gives new approximation .",
    "final section will discuss and conclude the results .",
    "the rabi hamiltonian for a qubit interacting with a harmonic oscillator is @xcite , @xcite , @xmath0 where @xmath1 are the usual pauli matrices with @xmath2 .    in the paper",
    ", we do not consider the rwa case where the non - rotation - terms @xmath3 are neglected . under large detuning and strong coupling condition ,",
    "the qubit is regarded as a perturbation .",
    "the so - called free hamiltonian is @xmath4whose solutions are @xmath5 where @xmath6 are the eigenvectors of the operator @xmath7 with @xmath8 @xmath6 are not @xmath9 .",
    "the hamiltonian describes the quantum oscillator influenced by force from its coupling with with qubit , and its solutions show that the force of the qubit acting on the oscillator has make the oscillator displace its equilibrium position according to the states of the qubit , just as shown in the displaced number states @xmath10 in its solutions .",
    "the displaced number states @xmath11 are not completely orthogonal due to the fact @xmath12 this will result in the complex situation when including the perturbation term @xmath13 of the qubit to be treated .",
    "this term @xmath13 of the qubit will produces the transition of the oscillator from its various eigenstates @xmath11 . from the theoretical view",
    ", the large detuning ( @xmath14 ) will make it reasonable to omit its transition among different numbers states .",
    "this means that the qubit mainly results in transition of the oscillator from the same number states which are displaced differently induced by the corresponding states of the qubit , that is , the transitions of the form @xmath15 .",
    "the other transitions ( @xmath16 ) will be omitted from the consideration .",
    "this approximation is called adiabatic . in this way",
    ", the whole hamiltonian becomes block - diagonal as @xmath17 with the @xmath18 matrices @xmath19 defined as @xmath20 where @xmath21 @xmath22 in the above equation are the laguerre polynomials .",
    "the new solutions are easy to obtain : @xmath23 all eigen - values @xmath24 are influenced by the parameters @xmath25 , so are the eigenvectors @xmath26 .",
    "the eigenvectors @xmath27 are complete and orthogonal basis for the composite system of the qubit and the quantum oscillator .",
    "the evolution of the qubit will definitely depends on the initial states of the composite system .",
    "here we only give some examples for showing the dynamics of the qubit . when the initial states of the composite system are @xmath28 , the possibility of the qubit remaining in its initial state are @xmath29    .",
    "the thick , solid and dashed lines correspond to the figures of @xmath30 with @xmath31 , @xmath32 , @xmath33 respectively.,scaledwidth=40.0% ]    the general initial state will evolute by the principle of superposition , see details in ref.@xcite .",
    "as stated before , the adiabatic approximation omits various terms of the form @xmath34 under the physical ground that @xmath14 .",
    "though physically the qubit seems not able to promote the oscillator to go from one displaced number state to a new one with different number as its energy gap @xmath35 is far more less that @xmath36 of the transition @xmath37 or @xmath38 .",
    "detailed quantities study also support the conclusion , and shows that the perturbation terms @xmath39 depend non - linearly on the coupling strength @xmath40 and the parameters @xmath41 . given an arbitrarily strong coupling @xmath40 , it is generally true that @xmath42 will be larger than most of @xmath43 .",
    "however , there are still several numbers @xmath44 that @xmath45 are much larger than @xmath42 .",
    "quantity study shows the number @xmath46 is finite and depends both the coupling strength @xmath40 and the number @xmath47 , so it will change accordingly . for example , fig.([fig2 ] ) shows @xmath48 is greater than @xmath49 when @xmath50 .",
    "so the adiabatic approximation must add these terms to be more applicable .",
    "there are two kinds of perturbations in quantum theory .",
    "the perturbation to the degenerate system and that to the non - degenerate ones .",
    "let s reconsider the perturbation @xmath51 to the free hamiltonian @xmath52 .",
    "the eigenstates are @xmath53 are degenerate , while other states with different numbers are not .",
    "so the perturbation @xmath54 will relate the two kinds ones in quantum theory . obviously , the adiabatic perturbation is the one only applied to the degenerate cases of the free hamiltonian .",
    "so , it is not complete as there is the non - degenerate perturbation to need to be added .",
    "some observation is given here for convenience : whenever there are perturbations of combination of both the degenerate one and non - degenerate one , one must first treat the degenerate one , then treats the non - degenerate one .",
    "the reverse order can not work , as the condition of perturbation is small relative the original energy gap of the free hamiltonian can not be met due to its degeneration .",
    "further more , for the second perturbation , there are two bases to use : one is from the eigen - states of the the free hamiltonian , the other comes from the first degenerate perturbation . in our case , they are @xmath55 and @xmath56 .",
    "of course , the basis @xmath57 are more favorable for the calculation of the second perturbation .    .",
    "the solid and dashed lines correspond to the figures for @xmath58 with @xmath59 respectively .",
    "the independent variable is @xmath60.,scaledwidth=40.0% ]    by the use of the basis @xmath61 , the dynamic equation for the composite systems is @xmath62 then the corresponding eigen - vectors and eigen - energies are    @xmath63,\\label{new en plus}\\\\    e_{n,-}&=&\\hbar\\omega\\bigg[(n-\\beta^2-\\omega_n ) + \\sum_{i=1}^{n_k}\\frac{|\\langle n_+| i_-\\rangle|^2}{4(n - i)}\\frac{\\omega^2_0 } { \\omega^2}\\bigg],\\label{new en mins}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath64 the summation includes those terms of @xmath65 that are comparable with the term @xmath66 .",
    "see appendix for details .",
    "the solid , thick and dashed lines of the figures represent for @xmath67 with @xmath68 respectively .",
    "the independent variable is @xmath60.,scaledwidth=40.0% ]    from comparison of the results ( [ new en vs]),([new en plus])-([new en mins ] ) with the old ones ( [ old en vs ] ) , ( [ old en pm ] ) , we could see the justification of the adiabatic approximation .",
    "the parameter @xmath69 is small , the new eigenstates ( [ new en vs ] ) differ from the old one ( [ old en vs ] ) only on first order of @xmath69 . though the new eigenvalues only has some extra terms in the second order of @xmath69 , the old one ( [ old en pm ] ) is already up to the first order of @xmath69 .",
    "some terms @xmath65 may be comparable or even larger than @xmath42 , discarding these terms to make the whole hamiltonian block - diagonal generally is feasible under the large detuning condition .",
    "however , because the term @xmath70 depends non - linearly on the parameter @xmath40 , in case of it being zero by some chosen @xmath40 , that is at the critical points , we consider it is reasonable to refer the adiabatic approximation as the new results ( [ new en vs]),([new en plus])-([new en mins ] ) .",
    "here we give an example .",
    "consider the composite system is initially in state @xmath71 .",
    "the quantum oscillator is in its displaced vacuum state or coherent state @xmath72 .",
    "suppose the coupling strength @xmath73 , we will have @xmath74 as the state of the system at time @xmath75 by the old adiabatic approximation method . from fig.([fig3 ] ) , we obtain that @xmath76 and all others much smaller than @xmath77 .",
    "so , in the new results of eqs.([new en vs ] ) , we have @xmath78 if we further choose @xmath79 , then @xmath80 similarly , we have @xmath81 the interesting things of the above equations are that @xmath82 combines the two states @xmath83 with opposite coefficient .",
    "of course , the coefficient in front of @xmath84 or @xmath85 very small .",
    "the change of the eigenvalues is ignorable in this case , that is , @xmath86 .",
    "therefore , @xmath87 becomes @xmath88\\label{new sol}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] eq.([new sol ] ) has the extra term , its last two parts , compared tith the old one ( [ old sol ] ) .",
    "so , even the quantum oscillator is initially in its displaced vacuum states , it will have some possibility to evolve into its displaced one photon states .",
    "the result may be of some use for the application of qubits coupled with a quantum oscillator .    in summary , concerning the system of a qubit",
    "coupled strongly to a quantum oscillator , the adiabatic approximation method is restudied and is extended or modified to the second order of @xmath69 for the eigenvalues and the first order for the eigenstates . though the modification is small and the old adiabatic approximation is justified , the new results will have some application .",
    "we could also extend the study to the system of @xmath89qubits coupled with a quantum oscillator , where the spectrum of the free hamiltonian @xmath52 is @xmath90 .",
    "the smallest energy gap is @xmath91 .",
    "for example , @xmath92 , the condition that the qubits energy @xmath93 is much more smaller than the transition energy gap @xmath94 can not be met for strong coupling ( large @xmath40 ) .",
    "so it is plausible the inclusion of the @xmath47-qubits will not induce the the transition of different displaced number states , that is , the adiabatic approximation might be put into doubt in this case .",
    "our study in the paper must be used to see that the adiabatic approximation can still be justified .",
    "this will be investigated in ref.@xcite .",
    "the work was supported by the national natural science of china ( no .",
    "10875018 ) .",
    "by the use of the perturbation method in quantum mechanics , we could solve eq.([hn eq ] ) by the following      where @xmath96 and @xmath97\\label{new en plus1},\\\\    e_{n,-}&=&e^0_{n,-}+\\frac14 \\hbar\\omega_0\\sum_{i=1}^{n_j}a^-_{n , i}(\\langle n_+| i_-\\rangle-\\langle    n_-| i_+\\rangle )   + \\frac14 \\hbar\\omega_0\\sum_{i=1}^{n'_j}b^-_{n , i}(-\\langle n_+| i_-\\rangle-\\langle   n_-| i_+\\rangle)\\nonumber\\\\ & = & \\hbar\\omega\\bigg[(n-\\beta^2-\\omega_n ) + \\sum_{i=1}^{n_k}\\frac{\\omega^2_0 } { ( n - i)16\\omega^2}|\\langle n_+| i_-\\rangle-\\langle    n_-| i_+\\rangle|^2+\\sum_{i=1}^{n'_k}\\frac{\\omega^2_0 } { 16(n - i)\\omega^2}|\\langle n_+| i_-\\rangle+\\langle    n_-| i_+\\rangle|^2\\bigg].\\label{new en mins1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]      because of the fact @xcite @xmath99 and @xmath100 being real , there are the relations @xmath101 and @xmath102 the above results concerning the coefficients @xmath103 , etc , could be simplified as eqs.([a bni ] ) .",
    "please note that @xmath104 in above is the associated laguerre function .",
    "the simple relation among the coefficients @xmath105 shows that the all upper limits of summation in eqs ( [ new en vs])-([new en mins ] ) could be put to the same as @xmath46 which depends on both @xmath106 .",
    "so , the results could be concisely written as eqs ( [ new en vs])-([new en mins ] ) .",
