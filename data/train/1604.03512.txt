    "community structure of networks has attracted a great deal of attention of the researchers in computer science , especially in the areas of data mining and social network analysis .",
    "although , community is an _ ill - defined _",
    "concept @xcite , a general consensus suggests that community structure is a decomposition of nodes of a network into sets such that nodes within a set are densely connected internally , and sparsely connected externally @xcite .",
    "communities are formed due to the structural or functional similarities among the vertices in the network @xcite .",
    "therefore , analyzing the community structure of a network provides a high - level view of the formation of network structure through the interactions of nodes having identical nature .",
    "communities in real - world networks are of different kinds : disjoint or non - overlapping ( e.g. , students belonging to different disciplines in an institute ) @xcite , overlapping ( e.g. , person having membership in different social groups in facebook ) @xcite , hierarchical ( e.g. , cells in human body form tissues that in turn form organs and so on ) @xcite etc .",
    "the task of community analysis goes through two separate phases : first , _ detection _ of meaningful community structure from a network , and second , _ evaluation _ of the appropriateness of the detected community structure . since there is no single definition of a community which is universally accepted , many thoughts emerged which in turn resulted in different definitions of community structure .",
    "every definition of community is justified in terms of different metrics formulated .",
    "therefore , analyzing such metrics is crucial to understand the development of the studies pertaining to community analysis .    due to the lack of consensus on the definition of a community , formulating metrics for evaluating",
    "the quality of a community is also a challenging task .",
    "there has been a large number of works aimed at designing functions quantifying properties proposed by their own in order to evaluate the goodness of a community .",
    "interestingly , these quality functions are not only useful for evaluation purposes but can also be used in various methods to detect the communities .",
    "the evaluation of the communities detected by an algorithm from a network becomes easier if the actual ( ground - truth ) community structure of the network is known a priori . in this direction",
    ", attempts were made to construct artificially - generated networks with inherent community structure @xcite . to make a correspondence between",
    "the detected and ground - truth community structures , few metrics were borrowed from the literature of _ clustering _ in data mining @xcite and reformulated by incorporating the network information .",
    "although , there have been studies surveying different approaches mostly on the _ detection _ of non - overlapping @xcite and overlapping @xcite communities separately , no attempts have been initiated to understand thoroughly _ the metrics used to design the algorithms and to evaluate the quality of the algorithms_. metrics help us in understanding the goodness of an algorithm in a quantitative manner .",
    "we believe that evaluating a community detection algorithm may be difficult because it requires selecting between several proposed quality functions that often output contradictory results .",
    "the structural properties of the network and of the communities being looked for may strongly differ from one case to the other .",
    "it is then of utmost importance to identify the right metric depending upon the purpose and properties of the given network .",
    "moreover , most of the metrics are extensions of some old measures . therefore , we need to understand the evolutionary route of a derived metric and its possible extensions .    in this paper , we conduct an extensive survey on the state - of - the - art metrics used for detecting and evaluating the community structure .",
    "more importantly , we bring together metrics related to all the classes of community structures ( disjoint , overlapping , fuzzy , local etc . ) into a single article that can help us understand the derivation of one measure into another .",
    "specifically , in case of metrics related to community detection we study traditional metrics like modularity and its variants as well as more recently proposed metrics including permanence , surprise , significance and flex . in case of community evaluation",
    ", we study various state - of - the - art metrics like normalised mutual information , purity , rand index and f - measure etc .",
    "finally , a comparative analysis is presented based on the experiments conducted on synthetically - generated and real - world networks . + * organization of the survey : * the survey has been conducted in two broad directions . in section [ sec : qualitymetric ] , we shall introduce metrics used as optimization functions in different algorithms for community detection in networks . in section [ sec : metricsofcommunityevaluation ] , we shall discuss the measures used for evaluating the goodness of the detected community structure ( i.e. , performance of the community detection algorithms ) .",
    "note that these two sets of metrics ( discussed in sections [ sec : qualitymetric ] and [ sec : metricsofcommunityevaluation ] ) are not mutually exclusive . in section [ result ]",
    ", we shall present a comparative analysis on the performance of the state - of - the - art metrics based on the experiments conducted on different networks .",
    "in each of these sections mentioned above , we shall present the metrics pertaining to all kinds of community structures . finally in section [ conc ] , we conclude the survey by addressing the shortcomings and limitations of the metrics found in the literature of community detection . to facilitate the discussion , we present in table  [ table : notations ] the summary of the notations used in this survey .",
    "the goal of community detection is to find inherent communities in a network .",
    "however , the definition of a community is not clear .",
    "what is a good community ? given a graph @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the set of nodes and @xmath2 is the set of edges , one can have an exponentially large number of possible communities . enumerating these communities",
    "is an np - complete problem @xcite .",
    "moreover , not all partitions of a graph are equally good . in order to obtain the best partition of the graph and thus significant communities , most of the community detection algorithms aim to optimize a _ goodness metric _ which essentially indicates the quality of the communities detected from the network .",
    "the goal of the community detection algorithm would be to obtain the best partition of the network which would optimize the metric .",
    "a wide variety of such metrics have been proposed which can detect the quality of the communities obtained for a given partition .",
    "this section presents a detailed study on the large number of goodness metrics proposed by the graph mining algorithms for community detection .",
    "note that apart from their extensive usage for community detection in different algorithms , these metrics are widely used to evaluate the quality of a detected community structure .",
    "we shall discuss this issue in section [ sec : metricsofcommunityevaluation ] .",
    "[ table : notations ]      the non - overlapping community detection algorithms aim at partitioning the vertices of @xmath0 into @xmath3 number of non - empty , mutually exclusive groups , @xmath4 such that each vertex belongs to _ one and only one _ community , i.e. , @xmath5 .    various simple metrics capturing the topological properties of the network have been proposed in the past which are used to compute the quality of communities detected .",
    "let us consider a function @xmath6 that characterizes the quality of the community on the basis of the connectivity of nodes in @xmath7 .",

    "the choice of the null graph is in principle arbitrary , and several possibilities exist .",
    "the usual choice of the null graph is to choose a model with the same degree distribution as of the original graph . for an unweighted and undirected network ,",

    "intuitively , a good community should be internally well and evenly connected , i.e. , it should be relatively hard to split a community into two sub - communities .",
    "this is characterized by the conductance of the internal cut .",
    "formally , @xmath30 , where @xmath31 is the conductance of @xmath32 measured in the induced subgraph by @xmath7 .",
    "intuitively , conductance measures the ratio of the edges in @xmath32 that point outside the set and the edges inside the set @xmath32 . a good community should have high cohesiveness ( high internal conductance ) as it should require deleting many edges before the community would be internally split into disconnected components @xcite . * * clustering coefficient * is based on the premise that network communities are manifestations of locally inhomogeneous distributions of edges , because pairs of nodes with common neighbors are more likely to be connected with each other @xcite .    in another paper , @xcite used two other topological metrics to measure the quality of a community :    * * volume * : @xmath33 is the sum of degrees of nodes in @xmath7 . *",

    "@xcite elegantly extended the definition of modularity while preserving its semantics in terms of probability to the scenario of directed networks . if an edge is directed , the probability that it will be oriented in either of the two possible directions depends on the in- and out - degrees of the end vertices .",
    "for instance , taken two vertices @xmath37 and @xmath38 under consideration , where @xmath37 has a high in - degree and low out - degree , while @xmath38 has low in - degree and high out - degree , in the null model of modularity an edge will be much more likely to point from @xmath38 to @xmath37 than from @xmath37 to @xmath38 . therefore , the expression of modularity for directed graphs can be defined as follows , @xmath46 \\delta_{\\omega_{i},\\omega_{j}}\\ ] ] where @xmath47 and @xmath48 are the in - degree and out - degree of node @xmath37 respectively .",
