    "in one of his seminal works , merton  @xcite considered the portfolio and consumption problem faced by a price - taking agent in a continuous - time stochastic model consisting of a risk - free bond and a risky asset .",
    "the agent is assumed to have the objective of maximising discounted expected utility from consumption over the infinite horizon . in a model",
    "in which the single risky asset follows an exponential brownian motion with constant parameters , and the agent has constant relative risk aversion , merton showed that optimal behaviour is to consume at a rate which is proportional to wealth , and to invest a constant fraction of wealth in the risky asset .",
    "constantinides and magill  @xcite were the first to add proportional transaction costs to the model .",
    "they conjectured the form of the optimal strategy , namely that is is optimal to keep the fraction of wealth invested in the risky asset in an interval .",
    "subsequently davis and norman  @xcite gave a precise statement of the result and showed how the solution could be expressed in terms of local times .",
    "optimal behaviour is to trade in a minimal fashion so as to keep the variables ( cash wealth , wealth in the risky asset ) in a wedge - shaped region in the plane , and this is achieved by sales and purchases of the risky asset in the form of singular stochastic controls .",
    "the approach in davis and norman  @xcite is to write down the hamilton - jacobi - bellman equation , and to characterise the candidate value function as a solution to this equation .",
    "subsequently , shreve and soner  @xcite reproved many of the results of @xcite using viscosity solutions .",
    "these approaches remain the main methods for solving portfolio optimisation problems with transaction costs , although recently a different technique based on shadow prices has been proposed , see guasoni and muhle - karbe  @xcite for a users guide .",
    "the results in davis and norman  @xcite are limited to a single risky asset , and it is of great interest to understand how they generalise to multiple risky assets . in his survey article on consumption / investment problems with transaction",
    "costs cadenillas  @xcite says that ` most results in this survey are limited to the case of only one bond and only one stock .",
    "it is then important to see if these results can be extended to cover a realistic number of stocks ' .",
    "although there has been some progress since that paper was published , similar sentiments are echoed in recent papers by chen and dai  @xcite : ` most of the existing theoretical characterisations of the optimal strategy are for the single risky - asset case .",
    "in contrast there is a relatively limited literature on the multiple risky - asset case ' and guasoni and muhle - karbe  @xcite : ` in sharp contrast to frictionless models , passing from one to several risky asstes is far from trivial with transaction costs ",
    "multiple assets introduce novel effects , which defy the one - dimensional intuition ' . in summary therefore , there is great interest in both theoretical and numerical results on the multi - asset case , and this paper can be considered as a contribution to that literature .    in the multi - asset case , and on the computational side , muthuraman and kumar  @xcite use a process of policy improvement to construct a numerical solution for the value function and the associated no - transaction region , and collings and haussman  @xcite derive a numerical solution via a markov chain approximation , for which they prove convergence . on the theoretical front akian _",
    "@xcite show that the value function is the unique viscosity solution of the hjb equation ( and provide some numerical results in the two - asset case ) and chen and dai  @xcite identify the shape of the no - transaction region in the two - asset case .",
    "explicit solutions of the general problem remain very rare .",
    "one situation when an explicit solution is possible is the rather special case of uncorrelated risky assets , and an agent with constant absolute risk aversion . in that case",
    "the problem decouples into a family of optimisation problems , one for each risky asset , see liu  @xcite .",
    "another setting for which some progress has been made is the problem with small transaction costs , see whalley and willmott  @xcite , and for a more recent analysis soner and touzi  @xcite .",
    "whalley and willmott use an expansion method to provide asymptotic formulae for the optimal strategy .",
    "in this paper we consider a different extreme in which transaction costs are either zero or ( with regard to trades in one direction of a particular risky asset ) infinite",
    ". expressed differently , one of the risky assets is assumed to not be available for dynamic trading ( either to the market as a whole , or to the utility - maximising agent , perhaps for legal reasons , or simply because it is difficult for individuals to trade particular stocks actively ) .",
    "instead the assumption is that this asset can only be sold : ( re)-purchases are not allowed .",
    "our agent is endowed with an initial quantity of this asset , and her strategies include when to sell units of this ( infinitely divisible ) asset over time .",
    "the assumption that there are infinite transaction costs on purchases of endowed asset is complemented by an assumption that sales and purchases of the other risky assets are permissible , and incur zero transaction costs .",
    "the set - up of our problem in which one asset is identified as a non - traded asset is similar to that in the real options literature ( miao and wang  @xcite , henderson  @xcite , henderson and hobson  @xcite ) in which an agent with the option to invest in a project ( or sell an asset ) chooses the optimal sale time .",
    "the difference with respect to that literature is that we assume that the non - traded asset is infinitely divisible , whereas in the real options literature it is typically assumed to be indivisible .",
    "our model consists of an agent who is endowed with units of an infinitely divisible risky asset which may be sold , but not bought , and whose opportunity set includes investment in a risk - free bond , and investment in other risky assets to which a zero transaction cost applies .",
    "the risky assets follow correlated exponential brownian motions and the objective of the agent is to choose a consumption rate and an investment strategy ( including a sale strategy for the endowed asset ) so as to maximise the discounted expected utility of consumption .",
    "this paper is an extension of hobson and zhu  @xcite which considers a similar problem with an endowed asset but with no other risky assets .",
    "many of the techniques of @xcite carry over to the wider setting of this paper , however , since there are fewer parameters when there are no investments beyond the endowed asset , the problem in @xcite is significantly simpler and much more amenable to a comparative statics analysis . in contrast , this paper treats the multi - asset problem which has proved so difficult to analyse in full generality , albeit in a rather special case .",
    "the multi - asset setting brings new challenges and complicates the analysis .",
    "it is straightforward to write down the hamilton - jacobi - bellman ( hjb ) equation for our problem .",
    "in general the value function is a function of four variables ( wealth in liquid assets , price of the endowed asset , quantity of endowed asset held , time ) and satisfies a hjb equation which is second order , non - linear and subject to value matching and smooth fit at an unknown free - boundary .",
    "( the smooth fit turns out to be of second order . ) in our special setting the problem of finding the free - boundary and value function is reduced to study of a boundary crossing problem for the solution of a first - order ordinary differential equation ( ode ) .",
    "this first crossing problem has four types of solution ( ` crossing ' at zero , crossing in @xmath0 , no crossing in @xmath1 $ ] and hits zero before crossing ) .",
    "each different type of solution is identified with a different type of solution to the optimisation problem ; for example the first type of solution corresponds to a strategy of immediately selling all units of the endowed asset .",
    "it is relatively straightforward to identify the parameter combinations which lead to different types of solution , even if explicit solutions of the first order ode are not available .",
    "then we can relate the optimal wealth process , consumption strategy , sale strategy and investment strategy of the agent path - wise to the solution of a skorokhod - type problem .",
    "let @xmath2 be a filtered probability space , such that the filtration satisfies the usual conditions and is generated by a two - dimensional brownian motions , and @xmath3 financial assets and a single endowed asset , but the situation reduces to the case considered here .",
    "in particular , the @xmath4 financial assets reduce to a single mutual fund . ]",
    "standard brownian motion @xmath5 . set @xmath6 , where @xmath7 .",
    "the financial market is modelled with three stochastic processes on this space , a bond paying a constant rate of interest @xmath8 , a financial ( or hedging ) asset with price process @xmath9 and a non - traded ( or endowed ) asset with price process @xmath10 .",
    "assume the price processes of the risky assets satisfy @xmath11 where @xmath12 and @xmath13 are the constant mean return and volatility of the financial asset , and @xmath14 is the initial price , and @xmath15 where @xmath16 and @xmath17 are the constant mean return and volatility of the non - traded asset , and @xmath18 is the initial price .",

    "let @xmath21 denote the consumption rate of the individual , let @xmath22 denote the number of units of the endowed asset held by the investor and let @xmath23 denote the cash amount invested in the hedging asset @xmath24 .",
    "the consumption rate is required to be progressively measureable and non - negative , the process @xmath25 is required to be progressively measureable , right - continuous with left limits and non - increasing to reflect the fact that the non - traded asset is only allowed for sale and @xmath26 is required to be progressively measurable .",
