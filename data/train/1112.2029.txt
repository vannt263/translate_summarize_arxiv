    "gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) are among the brightest cosmological explosions in the universe , mostly lasting from a few seconds to a few thousand seconds in soft @xmath13-ray .",
    "thanks to quick follow - up observations in optical band , the redshifts of some grbs have been measured by detecting the absorbtion lines of their afterglows or the emission lines of their host galaxies .",
    "so far the number of _ swift_-detected grbs with known redshifts has grown up to about one hundred and thus makes a reliable statistical analysis possible . among various statistical works ,",
    "the luminosity function as well as the cosmic formation rate of grbs are particularly interesting .",
    "the luminosity function is a measure of the number of bursts per unit luminosity , which sheds light on the energy release and emission mechanism of grbs .",
    "the cosmic formation rate is a measure of the number of events per comoving volume and time , which can help us understand the production of grbs in various stages of the universe .",
    "the isotropic - equivalent luminosity ( @xmath2 ) function of grbs was firstly assumed to be a standard candle @xcite and later more realistic shapes of the luminosity function were derived @xcite .",
    "the cosmic grb formation rate has also been extensively investigated ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",

    "for example , @xcite found a correlation between the variability degree of the prompt gamma - ray light curve and the luminosity and then adopted it to estimate the luminosities / redshifts of 220 bright long grbs detected by _",
    "@xcite used this grb sample to estimate the luminosity function evolution and the cosmic formation rate of grbs .",
    "wei & gao ( 2003 ) find that there is a tight correlation between the peak energy of the prompt emission spectrum ( @xmath14 ) and the luminosity .",
    "recently , @xcite find that both short and long grbs all comply with this correlation .",
    "using this correlation , @xcite estimated the luminosities / redshifts of the 689 batse grbs and hence derived their luminosity function and the formation rate .",
    "essentially these two works with simulated grb redshifts reached quite similar results , i.e. , the grb formation rate increases quickly in the region of @xmath15 and keeps constant up to @xmath16 , which is inconsistent with the cosmic star formation rates ( sfrs ) inferred from uv , optical , and infrared observational data so far @xcite .",
    "the original concept of luminosity function comes from astrophysical objects such as stars and galaxies which are long - lasting and quite stable in releasing their energy . for grb - like",
    "high energy transients , the total isotropic - equivalent energy ( @xmath1 ) released in the whole duration of one event can be reliably measured , and its function ( i.e. , the number density of bursts per @xmath1 interval ) likely provides an independent or even more representative clue on the underlying physics .",
    "that s why in this work we focus on the so - called `` isotropic - equivalent - energy function '' rather than the traditional luminosity function .",
    "this paper is arranged as follows .",
    "  2 introduces our sample and data selection .   3",
    "presents the statistical technique while ",
    "4 shows the results .",
    "we adopt a robust , nonparametric statistical technique to derive the isotropic - equivalent - energy function and the cosmic formation rate of grbs from a @xmath17 sample . for comparison ,",
    "the results from a @xmath18 grb sample are also presented . in  5 , we discuss the implication of our results and compare the cosmic grb formation rate with the observational cosmic star formation rate . throughout the paper ,",
    "we use the standard @xmath19 cold dark matter cosmology with the typical parameters @xmath20 , @xmath21 , and @xmath22 .",
    "in this work , two sets of data are analyzed .",
    "the @xmath17 sample comes from @xcite , containing 95 long grbs and x - ray flashes ( xrf , i.e. particularly soft bursts ) .",
    "this sample is made up of two parts .",
    "the first part consists of 70 long grbs from @xcite and their redshifts range from 0.033 to 6.3 .",
    "the @xmath1 values in this work are slightly different from those in @xcite because of the different cosmological parameters adopted in two works .",
    "the second part is from @xcite without any modification .",
    "all the grb spectra have been extrapolated and corrected to [ 1,10000 ] kev in the cosmological restframe .",
    "the @xmath17 sample suffers from various selection effects @xcite , among which the dominated one is the truncation due to the detection limit of the telescope , as seen in fig .",
    "if this bias not removed , the @xmath17 correlation would be far from the intrinsic one .",
    "a nonparametric @xmath27 statistical technique may be introduced to resolve this problem , which was first put forth by @xcite and further developed by @xcite .",
    "@xcite first applied this technique to grbs with simulated redshifts and later @xcite applied it to a larger grb sample still with simulated redshifts but up to @xmath28 . in this work",
    ", we continue to use this technique , but for the first time to two grb samples with observed / measured redshifts . in short ,",
    "this nonparametric @xmath27 statistical technique uses a well - defined truncation criterion to estimate the correlation ( if any ) between the relevant variables and their underlying parent distributions .",
    "the @xmath1 and @xmath3 are not independent . without loss of generality ,",
    "the total isotropic - equivalent - energy function can be rewritten as @xmath29 , where @xmath30 is the grb formation rate at @xmath3 , @xmath31 is the present - day ( i.e. , @xmath32 ) isotropic - equivalent - energy function , and @xmath33 counts for the cosmic evolution of @xmath1 , that said , @xmath34 . in the following analysis , the evolution @xmath33 will be removed from the @xmath1 sample ; after that one obtains the @xmath35 distribution , then the cumulative function @xmath36 , and finally the grb formation rate @xmath30 .",
    "distribution and the fluence limit .",
    "[ fig1],width=340 ]    consider a set of observable @xmath37 and @xmath38 , where @xmath39 indexes the @xmath39th burst and in our case @xmath39 runs from 1 to 95 . as shown in fig .",

    "if @xmath38 and @xmath37 are independent to each other , one would expect the number of the following sample @xmath46 to be uniformly distributed between 1 and @xmath43 . to estimate the correlation degree between @xmath1 and @xmath3",
    ", one may introduce the test statistic @xmath27 parameterized as @xmath47 where @xmath48 and @xmath49 are the expected mean and the variance of the uniform distribution , respectively .",
    "if @xmath50 follows an ideal uniform distribution , then the samples of @xmath51 and @xmath52 should be equal , and thus the statistic parameter @xmath27 tends to be zero .",
    "note that the @xmath27 value here has been normalized by the square root of variance , so the correlation degree @xmath3 and @xmath1 can be measured in units of standard deviation .",
    "the two variables @xmath1 and @xmath3 are connected through the form of @xmath53 , where @xmath54 is the fluence in 1@xmath5510000 kev in the burst restframe .",
    "note that bursts in the sample were actually detected by instruments onboard different satellites .",
    "the flux sensitivities of these instruments are as follows : @xmath56 for _ cgro_/batse ; @xmath57 for konus - wind , bepposax and _ fermi_/gbm ; @xmath58 for _ hete-2 _ ; and @xmath59 for _ swift_/bat .",
    "some bursts were detected by more than one satellite . to be safe , we choose the best sensitivity of @xmath60 as the flux limit of the whole sample .    for the @xmath2 sample ,",
    "the two variables are connected by @xmath61 where @xmath62 is the flux in 1@xmath5510000 kev in the burst restframe .",
    "we set the flux limit as @xmath63 in view of the fact that the sensitivity of bat is a few @xmath64 @xcite . nevertheless , our results are not sensitive to the limit of @xmath54 and/or @xmath65 .",
    "following @xcite and @xcite , we take the form of @xmath66 in order to separate the isotropic energy evolution @xmath67 from the grb sample . the value @xmath68 represents the isotropic energy after removing the evolution effect .",

    "the null hypothesis of the evolution is rejected at about 3.5 @xmath73 confidence level .",
    "the best fit to the @xmath17 data yields that @xmath74 , i.e. , @xmath75 .     as a function of the evolution parameter @xmath72 . the best - fit @xmath70 as well as its @xmath6 error ( i.e. , @xmath76 ) correspond to @xmath77 .",
