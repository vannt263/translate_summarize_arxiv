    "the nuclear collisions at sps energies , when combined with the na49 apparatus , open a possibility to study several subtle effects @xcite which are difficult to study at larger energies , like e.g. at rhic . on the other hand , a few new typically nuclear effects",
    "have been predicted recently for sps energies @xcite .",
    "recently the na49 experiment made a preliminary observation @xcite of a new interesting phenomenon in peripheral collisions , which after a more refined experimental analysis was advocated @xcite to be a coulomb effect due to spectator charge .",
    "here we discuss the origin of this effect .",
    "in particular , we discuss electromagnetic ( em ) interaction between the remnants of the two colliding nuclei and @xmath3 and @xmath4 produced in the collision .",
    "the two highly charged spectator systems generate a rapidly changing em field which modifies the pion trajectories .",
    "this causes a distorsion of observed kinematical pion spectra .",
    "we show that this distorsion is interrelated to the dynamics of the collision , and in particular to the time evolution and initial conditions of the participant and spectator zones .",
    "we study this em effect for the specific case of peripheral pb+pb collisions at sps energies ( 158 gev / nucleon beam energy , @xmath5=17 gev ) .",
    "this short presentation is based on our recent detailed studies @xcite .",
    "our approach is based on a monte carlo simulation of initial conditions and subsequent propagation of charged pions in the em field of moving spectator charge . in ref.@xcite",
    "we have devoted a separate section where we discuss the choice of the initial conditions .",
    "these roughly correspond to experimental samples available at the sps .",
    "here we concentrate only on propagation of pions in the em field .",
    "we define @xmath6 as the constant electrostatic field generated by the spectator @xmath7 in its rest frame , and @xmath8 as the field generated by the spectator @xmath9 in its rest frame .",
    "we assume both spectator systems to be uniform spheres with a normal nuclear density @xmath10/@xmath11 and with a total charge @xmath12 elementary units",
    ". then the static electric fields is given by a simple nuclear - physics text - book formula @xcite .",
    "we transform the fields @xmath6 , @xmath8 to the overall center of mass system . here",
    "@xmath13 for the left spectator and @xmath14 for the right spectator .    in the equations above",
    ", the @xmath15 factor is defined as @xmath16 .",
    "the vectors @xmath17 @xmath18 and @xmath19 @xmath20 are respectively the electric and magnetic fields generated by the left ( right ) spectator at the space - time position @xmath21 .    the resulting pion trajectory @xmath22 is defined by its time - dependent velocity @xmath23 : @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the pion mass .",

    "the pion density is drawn as a function of @xmath0 at @xmath26 mev / c ( thin solid ) , 75 mev / c ( dash ) , 125 mev / c ( dot ) , 175 mev / c ( dash - dot ) , and 325 mev / c ( thick solid ) ; @xmath27 values corresponds to a bin of @xmath28  mev / c .",
    "this simulation was made for @xmath29=0 .",
    "[ dndx ] , height=151 ]    our main results are illustrated in fig .",
    "panel * ( a ) * shows the initial spectra of emitted pions .",
    "as explained in ref.@xcite , in our simple model these spectra are identical for @xmath3 and @xmath4 .",
    "the presented @xmath30 density distributions are scaled down by the number of participant pairs .    in panel * ( b ) * , the corresponding distributions of @xmath3 in the final state of the pb+pb reaction are shown .",
    "these are obtained by our monte - carlo simulation .",
    "it is clearly apparent that the distributions are distorted by the coulomb repulsion between the pion and spectator charges .",
    "the effect is largest for pions moving close to spectator velocities ( @xmath31 ) and at low transverse momenta ( @xmath26  mev / c ) . here ,",
    "two deep valleys in the @xmath3 density are visible .",
    "a similar but smaller distorsion is also apparent at @xmath32  mev / c .",
    "an opposite distorsion is present for @xmath4 densities shown in panel * ( c)*. negative pions are attracted by the positive spectator charge and gather at low transverse momenta close to spectator velocities .",
    "this results in the presence of two large peaks at @xmath31 .",
    "remnants of these peaks are apparent at @xmath32  mev / c .",
    "[ rat ] shows the @xmath0-dependence of the @xmath33 for different pion emission time @xmath29 ( the time is measured since the time of the closest approach of two colliding nuclei ) . for @xmath34 0 the spectator coulomb field appears to produce a characteristic , complex pattern of deviations from unity .",
    "the first element of this pattern is a double , two - dimensional valley which covers the low-@xmath27 region in the vicinity of @xmath31 ; the valley remains still visible at @xmath35  mev / c .",
    "the second element is a smooth rise of the @xmath33 ratio at higher @xmath36 .",
    "this rise is present for all the considered @xmath27 values ; at fixed @xmath0 , the ratio slowly decreases with increasing @xmath27 .",
    "the central result of our analysis is the sensitivity of spectator - induced coulomb effects to initial conditions . indeed , clear differences appear for different @xmath29 values ( figs.2a , b , c , d )",
    ". with increasing @xmath29 , a broadening of the double valley at @xmath37 , and a decrease of the @xmath33 ratio at higher absolute @xmath0 , are visible .     and @xmath4 for a peripheral pb+pb reaction , for five values of @xmath29 .",
    "the @xmath1 ratio is drawn as a function of @xmath0 at @xmath26 mev / c ( thin solid ) , 75 mev / c ( dash ) , 125 mev / c ( dot ) , 175 mev / c ( dash - dot ) , and 325 mev / c ( thick solid ) .",
    "[ rat],height=151 ]",
    "the electromagnetic interaction between highly charged spectators and charged pions produced in the peripheral pb+pb reaction has been studied by means of a simplified but realistic model .",
    "this interaction leads to significant distorsions on the final state densities of @xmath3 and @xmath4 .",
    "the main feature of this `` coulomb '' effect is a big dip in the @xmath3 density distribution at low transverse momenta in the vicinity of @xmath31 , accompanied by an increase of @xmath4 density in the corresponding region of phase space .",
    "this results in the presence of a two - dimensional valley in @xmath38 for the @xmath1 cross section ratio . in addition , at higher absolute @xmath0 , a smooth increase of @xmath1 with @xmath0 may appear .    the sensitivity of this em effect to initial conditions has been estimated .",
    "the effect is clearly sensitive to initial conditions .",
    "changes of the pion emission time by 0.5 fm / c ( in c.m.s .",
    "time ) are sufficient to modify the observed distorsion pattern . in our model ,",
    "such changes are equivalent to changes of position of the formation zone by 0.5 fm relative to the two spectator systems .",
    "thus , the em effect appears to depend on the evolution of the pion production process in space and in time .",
    "therefore , it constitutes a new source of information on the non - perturbative process of light ",
    "meson production .",
