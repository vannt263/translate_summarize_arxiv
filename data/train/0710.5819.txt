    "the experimental success of the bose - einstein condensation ( bec ) @xcite of the trapped ultracold atomic gas has made much progress in the physics of quantum gases@xcite , which includes fermi - degenerate systems and bose - fermi mixtures .",
    "recently , using the feshbach - resonance method , molecular formations have been performed experimentally in ultracold atomic gases for two fermions@xcite and two bosons@xcite ; bose - einstein condensations have been observed for the thus created molecules of two fermions@xcite and two bosons@xcite . in these experiments ,",
    "the molecular binding energies can be tuned by continuous changes of the applied magnetic fields ; especially , bound molecular states can be changed into resonances by shifting the binding energies above the atom - atom scattering thresholds .",
    "one of the interesting applications of ultracold molecules is the observation of the bec - bcs crossover in experiments with atomic fermi gases : continuous crossover between the strong - coupling molecular bec and weak - coupling bcs superconducting states @xcite . in ultracold atomic - gas experiments ,",
    "the crossover occurred by a change of the molecular binding energy through the feshbach resonance method@xcite , and the experimental success has led to a lot of experimental and theoretical works on the crossover@xcite and molecular bec physics@xcite .",
    "molecules in optical lattice potentials are also an interesting problem . after the first observation of molecular formations using @xmath0rb@xcite",
    ", many experiments have been performed on the long - lived state of the @xmath0rb molecule@xcite , @xmath1k difermion@xcite , and @xmath0rb-@xmath1k boson - fermion heteronuclear molecules@xcite .",
    "quantum degeneracy has also been observed in gases of @xmath0rb molecules@xcite .",
    "the phase structure of the lattice - trapped atomic gas , which is produced through interparticle correlations , has much interest in relation to the strongly correlated condensed - matter system described by the hubbard model .",
    "thus many experimental and theoretical works have been done : for example , on the superfluid - mott insulator transition in bosonic@xcite , fermionic @xcite , and boson - fermion systems@xcite .    other theoretical studies on ultracold molecules include coherent molecular solitons@xcite , coherent photoassociation@xcite , and coherent intercondensate exchange between atoms and molecules@xcite .    in this paper , we discuss atom - molecule equilibrium for boson - fermion , fermion - fermion , and boson - boson mixtures of ultracold atomic gases with quasichemical equilibrium theory , an extension of classical chemical equilibrium theory@xcite for the quantum many - body problem , which was originally developed for the electron system in superconductors@xcite .",
    "our special interest is in applications of this method to boson - fermion and boson - boson mixtures , especially occurrences of atom or molecule bec , as shown in some works for boson - fermion mixtures@xcite .",
    "in addition , in contrast to the fermionic system , where many - body quantum calculations based on the microscopic model have been established , the singularities from the boson degrees of freedom sometimes cause problems in calculations of boson - fermion and boson - boson mixtures ; quasichemical equilibrium theory can give definite solutions in such cases . as another interest of this approach , it should be pointed out that we can easily include interparticle interactions , especially atom - molecule and molecule - molecule ones , which are sometimes omitted in many - body calculations .",
    "the quasichemical approach gives the equilibrium structures in a less model - independent way .",
    "it turned out that the effects of these interactions should change the atom - molecule equilibrium structures drastically in the strong - coupling region .    in sec .",
    "ii , a general formulation of quasichemical equilibrium theory is presented for molecular formation or dissociation processes in noninteracting atomic - gas mixtures , and in sec .",
    "iii , the method is applied to boson - fermion , fermion - fermion , and boson - boson mixtures and the atom - molecule equilibrium structures are shown at zero and finite temperatures .",
    "special attention is paid to the condition on the occurrences of atom or molecule bec ; the shifts of the bec transition temperatures are discussed from the molecular binding energy effects . in sec .",
    "iv , the law of mass action , which is satisfied in chemical processes with classical boltzmann statistics , is shown to deviate in ultracold molecular formation or dissociation processes by quantum - statistical effects ( the law of quantum mass action ) . in sec .",
    "v , we extend the quasichemical theory to include interparticle interactions for @xmath2-wave scattering processes ( three kinds of atom - atom ones , two kinds of atom - molecule ones , and one kind of molecule - molecule one in combination ) in molecular formation or dissociation processes . in the mean - field approximation ,",
    "the original six coupling constants of the interactions are shown to integrate into two parameters .",
    "it allows discussions of the interaction effects to be very clear .",
    "the formulations are applied to molecular formation or dissociation processes in interacting mixtures , and we discuss the change of the equilibrium structures at @xmath3 through interaction effects ; new phases with coexisting local - equilibrium states are shown to appear in the case of strongly repulsive interactions .",
    "section vi is devoted to a summary and outlook .",
    "we should comment that a relativistic extension is also possible of quasichemical theory and applications to diquark condensates in quark matter have been done in @xcite .",
    "let us take an atomic - gas mixture consisting of two atomic spices @xmath4 and @xmath5 with masses @xmath6 and @xmath7 ; in quantum statistics , @xmath8 are bosons or fermions , so that we have three kinds of combinations : boson - boson ( bb ) , fermion - fermion ( ff ) , and boson - fermion ( bf ) .    to develop a quasichemical equilibrium theory",

    "we take the quasiparticle picture wherein the system consists of atoms @xmath4 and @xmath5 and molecule @xmath10 , which are quasiparticles@xcite . in this picture ,",
    "two - body interactions between `` bare '' atoms bring about two - body correlations in the mixture ; their major effects are the creation of the composite molecule @xmath10 with binding energy @xmath17 and atoms and molecules , which are quasiparticle in the mixture , and interact through residual interactions , which are generally different from the original interaction between bare atoms .",
    "these quasiparticle interactions are generally regarded to be weak , and we neglect them in the first part of this paper . in sec .",
    "iv , we introduce the quasiparticle interactions and discuss their effects on atom - molecule equilibrium within the mean - field approximation .",

    "<S> atom - molecule equilibrium for molecular formation processes is discussed for boson - fermion , fermion - fermion , and boson - boson mixtures of ultracold atomic gases in the framework of quasichemical equilibrium theory . </S>",

    "<S> the temperature dependences of the atom or molecule densities are calculated numerically , and finite - temperature phase structures are obtained of the atom - molecule equilibrium in the mixtures . </S>",

    "<S> quantum - statistical deviations of the law of mass action in atom - molecule equilibrium , which should be satisfied in mixtures of classical maxwell - boltzmann gases , are calculated , and the difference in the different types of quantum - statistical effects is clarified . </S>",
    "<S> mean - field calculations with interparticle interactions ( atom - atom , atom - molecule , and molecule - molecule ) are formulated , where interaction effects are found to give the linear density - dependent term in the effective molecular binding energies . </S>",
