    "plasmonic metallic structures are well - known for the ability of breaking the diffraction limit and achieving large field enhancements or field confinements in small volumes@xcite .",

    "are carefully tuned so that the propogation of spp originated at the sites can get focused into a hot spot on the metal film .",
    "typical planar patterns for plasmonic excitation on the metal film include individual circular rings  @xcite , multiple concentric rings  @xcite , curved arrays of nanoholes  @xcite , and certain coaxial structures  @xcite .",
    "the other is geometry - induced plasmonic nanofocusing . in principle , tapering the cross section of the spp propagation gradually will increase the intensity of the spp and the slow down its group velocity . at the tip end of the taper , the group velocity becomes infinity which means the surface plasmon becomes localized and the energy is highly concentrated  @xcite .",
    "this type of techniques can accurately control the focus point and usually with a higher concentrating ability .",
    "conventionally , the nanofocusing techniques have the spp excited from free space and the devices are usually bulky . there are two issues which limit the concentration efficiency .",
    "first , the efficiency of spp excitation is usually low and unstable .",
    "second , the spp propagation length is limited by the lossy nature of metal . very recently , several approaches of realizing plasmonic nanofocusing on integrated - optics platforms have been reported  @xcite . using these on - chip light concentration techniques ,",
    "the light energy is coupled from a photonic waveguide to a plasmonic structure ( usually a metallic taper ) and then concentrating the light energy to the tip of the taper .",
    "the coupling from the photonic waveguide to the plasmonic structure is efficient and robust , while the plasmonic part is usually compact since it only concentrates light energy from a `` @xmath11 '' scale to a `` @xmath12 '' scale .",
    "therefore , the two limitations for free space plasmonic nanofocusing can be well addressed by the on - chip techniques .",

    ", we will present the design of a novel ultra - compact on - chip plasmonic light concentrator ( plc ) , and show that there are three major effects ( mode beat , nanofocusing , and weak resonance ) that govern this light concentration phenomenon and affect the efficiency of the device . by coordinating these effects , this proposed structure can maintain very high concentrating efficiency while the size dimensions ( width@xmath13 length@xmath14 ) are the smallest among the all the plasmonic - light - concentration techniques that have been reported .     or si ) ridge waveguide with a @xmath15 buffer layer .",

    "as mentioned above , the field concentration is governed by three effects : mode beat , nanofocusing and weak resonance .",
    "we have analyzed in section  [ s : plc : hybridwg ] that the incident mode @xmath33 in the bare photonic waveguide can excite two supermodes , @xmath37 and @xmath38 , in the corresponding hybrid waveguide with a metal ( au ) strip integrated on top .",
    "the triangle - shaped plc can be considered as a taper with the width @xmath27 of the au strip gradually going down to @xmath52 .",
    "therefore , we can still use the two supermodes for the au taper in our analysis .",
    "the mode beat between the two supermodes can make a side - coupling which transfers light energy quickly from the dielectric region to the metal region , and the triangle taper performs plasmonic nanofocusing at the same time .",
    "a big advantage of our design is that light coupling ( induced by mode beat ) and focusing are realized in a single triangle - shaped metal taper so that the device can be made ultra - compact .",
    "note that a short taper also means that we can not separate the processes of supermode excitation , evolution , interference , and coupling between each other . in the following , we will use a simplified model , in which the two supermodes have constant mode effective indices calculated based on the average width of the taper and the exact ratio change of the two supermodes along the taper is not considered .",
    "a certain amount of the light energy will be reflected at the apex and the input end of the taper , and some resonance effect can be observed .",
    "this weak resonance also affects the efficiency of how much energy we can concentrate into the tip . by adjusting the size parameters of the au taper , we can coordinate the three effects and optimize the efficiency of the plc .     of the au triangle .",

    "the blue curve is for @xmath81 , and the red curve if for @xmath68 .",
    "these curves are composed of two oscillatory parts , the slow variations corresponding to the mode - beat effect and the ripples of high oscillation frequency corresponding to the resonance effect .",
    "both of them can be clearly seen from the figure .",
    "recall that for a hybrid waveguide , we use equation  ( [ eq : beatlength ] ) to estimate the beat length . for the triangle - shaped structure , we may still use equation  ( [ eq : beatlength ] ) for beat - length estimation while @xmath27 is set to be @xmath82 which is about the average width of the triangle . for the blue curve",

    "the beat lengths can also be estimated from the figure by approximately locating the the first minimums of slow variation parts .",
    "these two methods of beat - length estimations agree with each other very well .",
    "when @xmath21 is about half of the beat length , the light energy transfers from the dielectric region to the metal region most efficiently , which results in a higher fcf , as can be seen from the figure .",
    "this is actually a principle of design .",
    "more accurately speaking , the tapering also induces energy coupling between the two supermodes . in other words ,",
    "the ratio of energy stored in the two modes will change at different locations along the metal taper , and only the @xmath37 mode becomes localized as the metallic tip .",
    "the ripples on the curves come from the resonance effect . although the presented structure is not designed based on resonance , the limited length of the taper results in the resonance effect as shown in figure  [ fig : plc : fcf_aulength ] .",
    "to calculate the free spectral range ( fsr ) , we need to use the effective index of the @xmath37 mode .",

    "this corresponds to about @xmath95 peaks for the red curve , a good matching with an actual counting on the figure .",
    "the fcf is usually the highest , when @xmath21 is chosen to be at a resonance peak close to half the beat length .",

    "the field is more concentrated in the metal region , which lowers down the transmission but causes a larger reflection .",
    "it is noticeable that the reflection part contributes less significantly to the overall @xmath113 than the transmission part , and therefore the profile of the @xmath113 spectrum is basically determined by the transmission spectrum .",
    "when the structure is off resonance , we have @xmath113 about @xmath114 , which means a certain amount of power is still coupled into the the metal region .",

    "the spacing between two successive drops in the transmission spectrum is clearly less than that of the @xmath99 case .",
    "moreover , since @xmath106 is close to the beat length , the plc is expected to be less efficient . as a result ,",

    "our analytic model using two supermodes is no longer valid in this case . as a result ,",
    "the field concentration effect is tremendously suppressed . for wavelengths larger than @xmath101 ,",
    "the vertical dashed lines indicate that a local minima of the transmission corresponds almost exactly to a local maxima of the fcf , which means that the plasmonic structure is at resonance .",
    "note that when @xmath21 is small , the resonance wavelengths are more sensitive to a change @xmath118 of @xmath21 .",

    "we have showed that three major effects ( mode beat , nanofocusing , and weak resonance ) interplay to generate the light concentration phenomenon and govern the performance of the device .",
    "the principles of design follow by adequately coordinating these effects .",
    "the plc has highest efficiency when length of the triangle is about half the beat length .",
    "in particular , we have demonstrated that after an optimization of the size parameters , a field concentration factor ( fcf , defined as the norm of the electric field at the apex normalized to the average norm of the electric field in the inputting waveguide ) of about @xmath3 can be achieved with the length of the device less than @xmath4 for a moderate tip radius @xmath5 .",
