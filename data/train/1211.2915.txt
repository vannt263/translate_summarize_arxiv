    "the visualization of three - dimensional structures and cosmic flows is a critical ingredient of research into the cosmography of the local universe .",
    "the purpose of cosmography is to characterize the morphology of features pertaining to the hierarchy of cosmological structures such as voids , groups , clouds , sheets , clusters , filaments , chains , superclusters , and walls .",
    "since structures at all scales are not static in the hubble flow , cosmography also has to deal with kinematic information .",
    "maps that assume relative distances based on galaxy redshifts are distorted from true 3d positions .",
    "the analysis of cosmic flows in the context of the spatial distribution of charted structures involves identification of attractors and other sources of motions . in turn",
    ", the reconstruction of flows provides new insights on their source density field . in this context",
    ", accurate determinations of distances and the peculiar velocity of galaxies are required .",
    "the objective of the cosmic flows project is to improve our knowledge of the cosmography of the nearby universe , with an emphasis on the identification of attractors .",
    "a key issue is to measure the radial component of the galaxies deviant motion from the hubble cosmic expansion .",
    "the radial peculiar velocity @xmath0 is expressed as a function of the velocity relative to the cmb background , the distance @xmath1 and the value of the hubble constant @xmath2 : @xmath3 . within 10 mpc , the cepheid period - luminosity relation ,",
    "the tip of the red giant branch method and the surface brightness fluctuation luminosity indicators provide measurements of the distances with 10% accuracy . further up to 200 mpc",
    ", the galaxy neutral hi gas luminosity - rotation rate tully - fisher correlation gives distance measurements with an accuracy of @xmath4 20% .",
    "hi observations most recently have been conducted using the nrao 100-meter diameter robert c. byrd green bank telescope , complemented in the southern sky with the parkes telescope .",
    "the photometry is acquired with several systems including the university of hawaii 2.2 m telescope .",
    "a first release of measurements of distances and peculiar velocities of 1797 galaxies was achieved with the _ cosmicflows-1 _ catalog presented in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* tully  ( 2008 ) ) .",
    "a three - dimensional velocity and density reconstruction of these peculiar velocities using the wiener filter technique was presented in ( * ? ? ?",

    "our study of the cosmography of the local universe benefits from the catalogs made available through the extragalactic distance database presented in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* tully  ( 2009 ) ) .",

    "are adjusted following a numerical action flow model .",
    "redshift distortions associated with virial velocities within clusters are also corrected .",
    "a weakness in the use of these catalogs consists in their growing incompleteness with distance .",
    "a description that takes this bias into account is offered by the reconstruction of the luminosity density field obtained by smoothing the distribution of galaxies corrected with a schechter function , as described in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* courtois  ( in preparation ) ) .",
    "cosmography calls upon the tools of visualization .",
    "an assembly of individual galaxies forms a cloud of points , each one possibly attached with a pointing velocity vector .",

    "galaxies in this plane , at sgz=0 , are displayed in fig.[slices ] ( left ) . the milky way , located at the center ,",
    "belongs to the local supercluster whose main component is the virgo cluster .",
    "a dense filament connects virgo to the region of the centaurus cluster , as can be further appreciated in the other projection shown in fig.[slices ] ( right ) . at a distance similar to virgo cluster but at negative",

    ", we find three major concentrations labelled pavo - indus , perseus - pisces , and the southern wall . in terms of cosmography ,",
    "another striking feature is the presence of voids with dimensions as large as 5000 km / s .",
    "these two maps are affected with the growing incompletness with distance .",
    "this is corrected in the three - dimensional map offered in fig.[widget ] , which illustrate the preponderance of the great wall as the most important structure of the local universe , and the relatively low importance of our local supercluster .",

    "this map also shows the underlying density field colored from black ( underdense ) to red ( overdense ) , the _ v8k _ galaxies , and the _ cosmicflows-1 _ galaxies with radial peculiar velocities attached ( blue and red arrows for inward and outward moving galaxies , respectively ) .",
    "this map reveals the presence of the very underdense  local void \" in the immediate vicinity of the milky way .",

    "the map illustrates the clearing from the voids in the form of outbound flows , as already reported in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* tully  ( 2008 ) ) .",
    "the map also reveals that the milky way is caught in a flow toward the virgo cluster , associated mostly with the virgo gravitational infall .",
