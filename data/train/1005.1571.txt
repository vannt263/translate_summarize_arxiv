    "the large and homogeneous redshift and image surveys like the 2dfgrs ( colles et al .",
    "2001 ) , sdss ( york et al . 2000 ) and more recently the 6dfgrs ( jones et al . 2004 ; 2009 ) have helped us to extend our view of the local universe . not only the small - scale distribution of galaxies is being revealed but equally important , now it is possible to make accurate measurements of the relationship between the various physical properties of galaxies and the local environment . recently , park et al .",
    "( 2007 , 2008 ) and park & choi ( 2008 ) used the sdss data and studied the environmental dependence of the observed morphology at large and small smoothing scales to address the question of whether galaxy morphology depends primarily on the large - scale environment in which the galaxy initially formed or on a smaller scale environment that may reflect the influence of later evolutionary effects such as galaxy - galaxy interactions .",
    "park et al . ( 2008 ) pointed out that galaxies statistically become more isolated if they recently merged and that at a fixed large - scale density , more isolated galaxies are more likely to be recent merger products .",
    "galaxy formation models within the @xmath9 paradigm are every time better tuned to fit the joint luminosity / color / morphology distribution of low - redshift galaxies ( c.f .",
    "de lucia et al . 2006 ) .",
    "these models assume that bulge formation takes place during mergers and that a galaxy can grow a disk later on provided that it is fed by an appreciable cooling flow .",
    "spheroid formation is extended by assuming that bulges can also grow from disc instabilities .",
    "this additional mechanism can change the relative fractions of morphological types in these models . in the simulations of de lucia et al .",
    "( 2006 ) , the final fractions of ellipticals , spirals and lenticulars brighter than -18 in the @xmath10 band are 17% , 65% and 18% , very close to the fractions of 13% , 67% and 20% reported by loveday ( 1996 ) .",
    "if bulge growth is switched - off , the above fractions become 7% , 84% and 8% respectively , very close to the reported fractions for isolated galaxies from the cig catalog ( karachentseva 1973 ) that are in common to the sdss ( dr6 ) by hernndez - toledo et al .",
    "this could be evidencing the impact of secular processes in the properties of isolated galaxies .",
    "uniformly selected and observed samples of galaxies that have not suffered any interaction with another normal galaxy or with a group environment over a hubble time are thus crucial for studying intrinsic and secular processes able to affect the structure , morphology and dynamics of galaxies , for instance , the formation and evolution of bars , rings , lopsidedness , and bulges .",
    "homogeneous observational data for such isolated galaxies are crucial for obtaining transparent scaling relationships and correlations that can be appropriately confronted to model predictions ( see , e.g. zavala et al .",
    "2003 ; avila - reese et al . 2008 ) .",
    "it is worth to mention that an important requirement for all these samples is that of a well defined and strong isolation criteria , along with a uniform quality data acquirement in several wavelengths , and of statistical completeness .    in order to overcome some limitations of",
    "one of the most representative census of isolated galaxies in the local universe started a few decades back by karachentseva ( 1973 ) ( e.g. lack of uniform , deep and high resolution ccd imaging , scarce of uniform and reliable photometric data as well as incompleteness in high resolution spectroscopic data ) , we compiled a new catalog of isolated galaxies from the sloan digital sky survey ( dr5 ) as part of the iaunam - kias collaboration .",
    "this hereafter called unam - kias catalog has been compiled by implementing a variation on the criteria developed by karachentseva , including full redshift information as well as more accurate photometric information now available in the sdss database .",
    "using the three dimensional information , we are able to avoid missing galaxies that happen to lie close to background or foreground galaxies . one principal aim of this new catalog is , providing new isolated galaxy candidates with the highest possible statistical and redshift completeness to complement the existing lists of similarly selected galaxies in the local universe .",
    "another relevant aim is to provide a body of observational parameters that will be used for a comparison analysis of the predicted properties of different models of galaxy formation and evolution .    in a companion paper by hernndez - toledo",
    "2008 ( hereafter paper 1 ) the results of a detailed morphological reevaluation of all the available isolated cig galaxies ( 549 ) from the karachentseva ( 1973 ) catalog in common to the sdss ( dr6 ) was presented .",
    "the methodology was based on an image processing scheme that takes advantage of the uniformity , photometric conditions and high resolution ( 0.4 @xmath1/pix ) of the sdss ccd images .",
    "here we have applied the same image procedures to proceed with a morphological classification for the isolated galaxies of the unam - kias catalog .",
    "a good understanding of these isolated , non  perturbed , galaxies and in particular of their morphological content is at the basis of any further correlations with other physical parameters and is one of the main legacies in the presentation of the unam - kias catalog .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows .",
    "section 2 summarizes the relevant sdss information and selection criteria used to compile the unam - kias catalog of isolated galaxies . in section 3",
    "the results of a detailed morphological classification are presented along with the public release of the unam - kias morphological atlas . in section 4",
    "some general properties , namely , completeness , apparent magnitude , color distributions , color - color diagrams , absolute magnitude - color and concentration - color diagrams as a function of morphological type are presented .",
    "finally , in section 5 a brief summary of the principal results and the main conclusions achieved are presented .",
    "the corresponding photometric and spectroscopic catalogs will be presented elsewhere .",

    "the sdss ( york et al . 2000 ; stoughton et al . 2002 ) is a survey to explore the large - scale distribution of galaxies and quasars by using a dedicated 2.5 m telescope at apache point observatory ( gunn et al .",
    "the photometric survey has imaged roughly @xmath15 steradians of the northern galactic cap in five photometric band - passes denoted @xmath16 , @xmath2 , @xmath5 , @xmath17 , and @xmath18 centered at 3551 , 4686 , 6165 , 7481 , and 8931 , respectively , by an imaging camera with 54 ccds ( fukugita et al .",

    "; tucker et al . 2006 ) , targets are selected for spectroscopic follow - up observation .",
    "we used a large - scale structure sample , dr4plus , from the new york university value - added galaxy catalog ( nyu - vagc ; blanton et al .",
    "the nyu - vagc is a local galaxy catalog containing the sdss galaxies with redshifts below about 0.3 , and selects galaxies in the way similar to that by which the sdss main galaxy sample is made ( see strauss et al .",
    "2002 for the detailed selection criteria for the sdss main galaxies ) .",
    "the sdss produced two galaxy samples ; one is a flux - limited sample to extinction corrected apparent petrosian @xmath5-band magnitudes of 17.77 ( the main galaxy sample ) , and a color - selected and flux - limited sample extending to @xmath19 ( the luminous red galaxy sample ) .",
    "the sample dr4plus is close to the sdss data release 5 ( adelman - mccarthy et al .",
    "2007 ) . from this catalog",
    ", we selected the galaxies with @xmath5-band magnitudes in the range @xmath20 .",
    "we did not use galaxies in the southern galactic cap because of the narrow angular extent of the survey regions .",
    "our survey region covers 4464 deg@xmath21 , containing 312,338 galaxies . of the sample ,",
    "approximately 6% lack measured redshifts because of fiber collisions , are assigned the spectroscopic redshift of the nearest neighbor , and are kept in our parent galaxy catalog .",
    "the isolated galaxies in our catalog are restricted to those with measured redshifts .",
    "however , we included galaxies with borrowed redshifts when the neighbors are searched to determine isolation of the target galaxies .",
    "this primary sample effectively has a magnitude range of only about 3.1 mag , which significantly limits the number of candidate isolated galaxies . to extend the range of magnitude , we attempt to include the bright galaxies with @xmath22 . however , the spectroscopic sample of the sdss galaxies is not complete for @xmath23 .",
    "we thus searched for the various literature to borrow redshifts of the bright galaxies without sdss spectra to increase the spectroscopic completeness .",
    "we added 5195 bright galaxies within our survey boundary to the primary sample ( see choi et al .",
    "2007 for further details ) . in total , the final data set consists of 317,533 galaxies with known redshift and sdss photometry .",
    "our isolation criteria is specified by three parameters .",
    "the first is the extinction - corrected petrosian @xmath24band apparent magnitude difference between a candidate galaxy and any neighboring galaxy , @xmath25 .",
    "the second is the projected separation to the neighbor across the line of sight , @xmath26 .",
    "the third is the radial velocity difference , @xmath27 .",
    "suppose a galaxy @xmath17 has a magnitude @xmath28 and @xmath17-band petrosian radius @xmath29 .",
    "it is regarded as isolated respect to potential perturbers if the separation @xmath26 between this galaxy and a neighboring galaxy @xmath30 with magnitude @xmath31 and radius @xmath32 satisfies the conditions    @xmath33    or the conditions    @xmath34    for all neighboring galaxies . here",
    "@xmath35 is the seeing - corrected petrosian radius of galaxy @xmath30 , measured in @xmath36band using elliptical annuli to consider flattening or inclination of galaxies ( choi et al . 2007 ) .",
    "we choose @xmath37 . using these criteria",
    ", we found a total of 1548 isolated galaxy candidates .",
    "note that a magnitude difference of 2.5 in our selection criteria translates into a factor of about 10 in brightness similar to that imposed by karachentseva ( 1973 ) .",
    "we removed spurious objects due to poor image deblending , bright stars within the area of a galaxy , images with strong diffraction spikes and the presence of strong diffuse light from other sources .",
    "we also removed galaxies fainter than @xmath38 for reliability of our isolated galaxy sample because we require @xmath39 to galaxies in the primary sample defined by the magnitude limit of @xmath40 .",
    "thus the final number of isolated galaxies that will comprise the unam - kias catalog amounts to 1520 .",
    "since the sdss project scanned a quarter of the sky , one can figure out the number of cig galaxies intersected by the sloan survey , namely ; ( 1050/2 ) @xmath0 525 galaxies , similar to the number of cig galaxies ( @xmath0 550 ) found in common to the sdss ( dr6 ) by hernndez - toledo et al .",
    "the cig and the unam - kias catalogs have an interesting overlapping at velocities up to @xmath41 10000 km s@xmath12 sharing 107 galaxies in common ( see table 1 ) .",
    "this means that more than 400 cigs were rejected after applying our selection criteria .",
    "part of this can be explained by invoking equations 1 and 2 and imposing , to the sake of clarity , the condition @xmath42 ( or @xmath43 in karachentseva criteria ) .",
    "the isolation from similar - sized neighbors as projected in the sky is stronger in the unam - kias , rejecting cases where strict isolation is not satisfied by cig galaxies and cases where isolation is satisfied but not equation 2 above .",
    "equations ( 3 , 4 and 5 ) also impose a stronger restriction to the presence of small - sized galaxies in the neighborhood of an isolated galaxy , rejecting a fraction of cigs in such circumstances .",
    "evidence for this comes from the refinement of the cig isolation criteria in terms of collective tidal effects of small - sized neighbors ( verley et al . 2007 ) showing that an additional @xmath44 of the cigs should be eliminated from the original sample . from the 107 cig galaxies in common to the unam - kias , 77 belong to the refined sample in verley et al ( 2007 ) indicating that our selection criteria includes much of such a refinement .",
    "the unam - kias not only adds a significant number of new isolated galaxies at @xmath45 10000 km s@xmath12 vindicating some previously presumed non - isolated cases lacking radial velocity information ( c.f hernndez - toledo et al .",
    "2009 ) , but becomes a natural extension of the cig for @xmath46 10000 km s@xmath12 up to a bit more than 20000 km s@xmath12 .",
    "it is therefore hoped that any joint study of the properties of these isolated galaxies should add necessarily more statistical significance and deeper insight to the origin of such galaxies .      in table 1",
    "we list the general properties of the 1520 isolated galaxies sorted in right ascension : column ( 1 ) gives a running identification number ; column ( 2 ) , the galaxy name ( following the iau - designated sdss naming convention ) , column ( 3 ) , an alternative name when available in the hyperleda database , or cig number when a match is produced , column ( 4 ) the @xmath47-band petrosian magnitude corrected for galactic extinction according to schlegel et al .",

    "the general criteria to carry out a morphological classification of the sdss galaxies have been established and presented in a companion paper by hernandez - toledo et al .",
    "( 2008 ) where @xmath0 550 isolated galaxies from the cig in common to the sdss ( dr6 ) database were classified in detail following an image processing scheme that take advantage of the improved scale and dynamic range of the sdss images and that enhances various low / high spatial frequency structural components in galaxies . here only a brief description of our morphological considerations is presented .    in order to discuss the optical morphology and its relationship to the global photometric properties , the isolated galaxies in the unam - kias catalog were visually inspected through mosaics of images including , from upper - left to lower - right panel : ( 1 ) a gray scale @xmath2-band image where a logarithmic transformation was applied to look for bright / faint internal / external details , ( 2 ) a @xmath2 band filtered - enhanced image where a gaussian kernel of various sizes is applied to look for internal structure in the form of star forming regions , bars , rings and/or structure embedded into dusty regions .",
    "the filtered - enhancing techniques ( sofue 1993 ) allow the subtraction of the diffuse background in a convenient way to discuss different morphological details , including low surface brightness features , ( 3 ) an rgb color image from the sdss database to complement our morphological analysis",
    ". these images are useful to visualize the spatial distribution of various morphological components in the images ( blue colors are for recent sf and red colors for older populations / dusty components ) .    for e / s0 candidates ,",
    "we further include in each mosaic , plots of surface brightness profiles and the corresponding geometric profiles ( ellipticity @xmath6 , position angle @xmath7 and @xmath8 coefficients of the fourier series expansions of deviations of a pure ellipse ) from the @xmath5 band images to provide further evidence of boxyness / diskyness and other structural details .",
    "the classification of the sample followed the basic hubble sequence . for spiral types",
    "the bulge to disk ratio as judged from the observed prominence of the bulge , tightness of the arms , and the degree of resolution of structure along the arms / outer disk were considered . in the majority of the unam - kias",
    "spirals these features are well recognized , however in some cases the presence of structures like dust lanes , prominent knots and the apparent tightening of the arms in the central regions may confuse the identification of structures like inner rings or bars .",
    "outer rings / pseudo - rings ( buta 1995 ) were also identified when possible . while the presence / absence of a bar was confirmed in some cases ( sb ) , in the suspected cases we adopted the ( sab ) nomenclature convention .",
    "the data presented in table 1 reports the @xmath17 band minor - to - major isophotal axis ratio as an indicator of the inclination .",
    "this is important to evaluate the reliability of the classification presented here .",

    "the middle panel shows the corresponding filtered - enhanced version and the right panel the corresponding @xmath48 image from the sdss database .",
    "the relative importance of the bulge , arms and their degree of resolution into fragmented clumps in sb , sbc , sc and scd types is considered . some main structural features like bars and rings were identified and sometimes suspected .",
    "each galaxy is identified by its iso number and the corresponding morphological type .",
    "the average radial velocity of the unam - kias spirals is @xmath0 10000 km s@xmath12 and in some cases the structural details are difficult to recognize at v @xmath49 10000 km s@xmath12 .    for early - type ( e / s0 ) candidates , in addition to a careful inspection to the corresponding mosaic images , an evaluation of the geometric profiles after an isophotal analysis was carried out .",
    "although the absolute value of the @xmath50 parameter depends on the inclination of the galaxy to the line of sight , its sign is useful to detect subtle disky features in the early - type candidates .",
    "a galaxy was judged to be an elliptical if the @xmath50 parameter showed : 1 ) no significant boxy ( @xmath51 ) or disky ( @xmath52 ) trend in the outer parts , or 2 ) a generally boxy ( @xmath51 ) character in the outer parts .",
    "we further inspected the surface brightness profile for the presence / absence of 3 ) a linear component in the surface brightness - radius diagram .",
    "central diskyness is considered not enough for an s0 classification .",
    "figure 2 shows iso 1404 to illustrate an elliptical galaxy and figure 3 shows iso 459 to illustrate a lenticular galaxy both at @xmath53 .",
    "the @xmath2-band filtered - enhanced image of iso 1404 shows some sort of faint external envelope .",
    "we caution the reader about the reality of these features in some of our e / s0 candidates and that care must be taken about its interpretation , specially at velocities @xmath54 where our image methodology might not be good enough to resolve some structural details .",
    "another relevant goal of our image procedure is to isolate as much as possible the differences among lenticulars and very early - type spirals . only from a more uniform and deeper survey like the ccd sdss it is possible to systematically search for fainter features that could point to a more definite morphological classification .",
    "here we use in addition , plots of both @xmath6 and @xmath7 radial profiles as an auxiliary tool to disentangle among s0 or sa cases .",
    "significant and not necessarily coupled changes in @xmath6 and @xmath7 radial profiles should be evidencing the presence of additional structure ( in the form of a disk ) for an s0 galaxy or in the form of arms , outer rings or envelopes for sa galaxies .",
    "if further additional image processing did not show definite evidence of those features , we kept the galaxy type as lenticular .",
    "figure 4 shows iso 283 to illustrate a very early - type sa galaxy .",
    "the advantages of the higher resolution and depth of the ccd sdss images , in combination with our image procedures , is illustrated here for a galaxy with @xmath53 .",
    "nevertheless , the reader should be cautious about the classification for distant e / s0/sa galaxies where it may be difficult to discriminate among representative structural details .",
    "table 2 reports our morphological evaluation for 1318 unam - kias galaxies , after removing 202 not classifiable galaxies ( advanced mergers , compact , poorly defined objects , edge - on and highly inclined galaxies , as devised from their aspect ratio ) .",

    "isolated late - type galaxies show a larger scatter in ( @xmath77 ) color compared to early - type galaxies . notice that the color distribution of late - type galaxies overlaps with early types practically at all absolute magnitude intervals and thus a line dividing the sequences of red and blue galaxies is difficult to find .",

    "is interpreted as a statistical fluctuation or incompleteness due to small number of galaxies in those magnitude bins . since the parent galaxy sample from which the unam - kias was select is intrinsically incomplete at bright magnitudes and in spite that bright galaxies from other catalogs were added , the effect this supplement had on completeness appeared to be non - significant and reflects the difficulty of having nearby isolated bright galaxies . at intermediate ( 13.7 - 15.2 ) @xmath5 band magnitudes where most of our galaxies yield statistical significance to the test ,",
    "the unam - kias is about  80level of completeness for galaxies satisfying our selection criteria .",
    "incompleteness of this sample beyond 15.2 @xmath5 band petrosian magnitudes , is a natural consequence of our selection criteria that excludes galaxies beyond that magnitude range to ensure that we are within the completeness limit of the parent sample ( section 2.2 ) .",
    "notice how the faint - end completeness limit in the @xmath5 band magnitude is correctly recovered from this test .",
    "in order to overcome some limitations of the previous major sample of isolated galaxies in the local universe by karachentseva ( 1973 ) ; to mention , a lack of uniform , deep and high resolution ccd imaging , the scarcity of uniform and reliable photometry and high resolution spectroscopic incompleteness , we compiled a new catalog of isolated galaxies from the sloan digital sky survey ( dr5 ) that adds a significant number of new isolated galaxies in the local universe also complementing the previous census .",
    "this catalog coined as unam - kias , has been compiled by implementing a variation on the criteria developed by karachentseva , including full redshift information as well as more accurate photometric information now available in the sdss database .",
    "we have taken advantage from the high resolution ( @xmath0 0.4 @xmath1/pix ) and high dynamic range of the sdss images by implementing a simple digital image processing scheme that enhances structural details in galaxies of various types supporting a detailed morphological characterization for the isolated galaxies in the unam - kias catalog . a morphological atlas containing detailed mosaic images for the galaxies",
    "is also presented and released along with this paper .",
    "the classification presented here preserves the optically observed morphology but takes into account structural information provided from the digital image processing , the isophotal analysis ( e / s0/sa cases ) and the color information provided by the sdss rgb images .",
    "the isolated galaxy candidates in the unam - kias catalog show a wide morphological diversity , from e to sm types .",
    "80@xmath58 of these galaxies are in the range of ( sa - sm ) types , 14.5@xmath58 are of ( e , s0 ) type and 50@xmath58 are of sbc type or latter ( up to sm types ) .",
    "although this is an attempt to provide an uniform morphological classification , the reader should notice that this classification is not free of uncertainties , specially for some e / s0/sa galaxies at larger distances where our image procedures may no longer be enough for disentangling among their characteristic structural properties",
    ". a tentative fraction of about 62.9@xmath58 of the isolated galaxies in the unam - kias catalog show evidence of barred structure : for 26.3@xmath58 the evidence is clear ( sb galaxies ) and for 36.6@xmath58 the bars are weak or suspected ( sab galaxies ) .",
    "the bar fraction ( sab + sb ) by morphological type is 27.8@xmath58 for early types and 35@xmath58 for late types .    although we did not a systematic search for bars in the present study , we notice that the tentative fraction of bars ( 62.9@xmath58 ) is not so different from that reported for galaxies in other environments .",
    "this could be suggesting that interactions and the global effects of the group / cluster environment are not crucial for the formation / destruction of bars .",
    "however , in an analysis of a volume - limited sample of the general sdss galaxies , lee & park ( 2008 ) have found a dependence of the bar fraction on the large - scale background density when the bars are visually identified .",
    "it is fundamental thus to carefully infer the fraction of bars in the unam - kias sample by an homogeneous method .",
    "a first exploration of the general properties of the galaxies in the unam - kias catalog and of the relations among some of their representative physical parameters leaded us to some important conclusions :    \\a ) the spatial distribution of the unam - kias galaxies , as seen from their redshift distribution does not show evidence of obvious concentrations associated with major components of large - scale structure in the local universe but a more careful study in this direction needs to be done .",
    "this apparent homogeneity points to a sample that is close to a local homogeneous component of the isolated galaxy distribution .",
    "\\b ) although the unam - kias galaxies comprise a nearby sample , its redshift interval has increased with respect to that in the cig catalog by about a factor of two , making it deeper and representative of the galaxies in this environment in the local universe .",
    "\\c ) the unam - kias sample is also diverse in terms of physical properties explored here .",
    "a scarcity of nearby dwarf isolated e / s0 galaxies and a tendency of bright e / s0 galaxies being farther away than spiral galaxies is observed .",
    "\\d ) the unam - kias catalog of isolated galaxies is a magnitude - limited sample that is reasonably complete ( @xmath0 80@xmath58 ) up to 15.2 @xmath5 band apparent magnitudes , providing statistical significance to studies of these galaxies in isolated environments .",
    "the finding of reasonably nearby isolated galaxies uniformly - selected and with detailed morphological information is of high relevance .",
    "the unam - kias catalog along with the most isolated galaxies of the cig catalog that are in common to the sdss will provide a unique database that can be used for several studies , including ( i ) studies of the environmental effects on galaxies belonging to groups and clusters , and ( ii ) for confronting with theoretical and model predictions of galaxy evolution .",
