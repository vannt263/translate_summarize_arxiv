    "consider the graph in figure [ fig : nonplanar ] , obtained from @xmath161 by adding two edges .",

    "a copy of this graph , denoted @xmath11 , is also included in figure [ fig : nonplanargolden ] . consider the intersection of @xmath11 with the shaded region indicated in the figure as a particular example of the second graph in figure [ fig : linear tutte ] .",

    "this identity is intrinsic to planar graphs , and it certainly does not hold for general ribbon graphs",
    ". however we will now show that it still holds for _ some _ non - planar graphs .    in the relation ( [ linear tutte ] ) and figure [ fig : linear tutte ] there is an arbitrary number of edges leading to the boundary of the disk . in the special case in figure [ fig : nonplanargolden ]",

    "( more generally , the identity still holds for an arbitrary number of edges leading to the boundary of the disk at the other three vertices in figure [ fig : nonplanar2 ] , and these local pictures may be paired with an arbitrary non - planar graph . )",
    "the chromatic polynomial of these graphs satisfies the contraction - deletion rule pictured in figure  [ chromatic relations ] : @xmath215 as shown in the proof of lemma 3.1 in @xcite , ( [ projector equation ] ) yields @xmath216 equations ( [ eq1 ] ) , ( [ eq2 ] ) , combined with the fact that three of the graphs satisfy the golden identity , imply that the remaining graph , @xmath11 , also obeys ( [ golden identity ] ) .",
    "the argument above suggests a strategy for generating families of non - planar graphs satisfying the chromatic golden identity",
    ". it would be interesting to find a characterization of all such graphs , and in particular to see whether the argument using the 4th jones - wenzl projector considered here generates all of them .",
    "another open question is whether there exist @xmath97-connected non - planar graphs with the number of edges and vertices satisfying @xmath217 ( analogous to the case of a planar triangulation ) and satisfying the golden identity ( [ golden identity ] ) .    *",
