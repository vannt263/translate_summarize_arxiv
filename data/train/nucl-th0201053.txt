    "the masses for the proton - rich nuclei above @xmath2 have not yet been measured . however , they are important for the astrophysical rapid - proton capture ( rp ) process @xcite which follows a path in nuclei near @xmath3 for @xmath4 .",
    "the rp process is the dominant source of energy in type i x - ray bursts , and it determines the crust composition of accreting neutron stars @xcite",
    ". it may also be responsible for the p process nucleosynthesis of a few proton - rich stable nuclei in the @xmath5@xmath6 mass range . in the absence of experimental masses for the proton - rich nuclei",
    ", one often uses the masses based upon the audi - wapstra extrapolation ( awe ) method @xcite . in this paper",
    "we use the displacement - energy method @xcite to obtain the proton - rich masses with the skyrme hartree - fock model for the displacement energies .",
    "the displacement energy is the difference in the binding energies of mirror nuclei for a given mass @xmath7 and isospin @xmath8 :    @xmath9    where @xmath10 , @xmath11 is the binding energy of the proton - rich nucleus and @xmath12 is the binding energy of the neutron - rich nucleus",
    ". the displacement energy can be much more accurately calculated than the individual @xmath13 in a variety of models since it depends mainly on the coulomb interaction .",
    "in particular , we will use the spherical hartree - fock model based upon the recent skx set of skyrme parameters @xcite , with the addition of charge - symmetry breaking ( csb ) , skx@xmath14 @xcite . with the addition of csb these calculations are able to reproduce the measured displacement energies for all but the lightest nuclei to within an rms deviation of about 100 kev @xcite . in the @xmath0 mass region the mass ( binding energy ) of most of the neutron - rich nuclei are experimentally usually known to within 100 kev or better ( the only exception being @xmath15br for which we use the awe ) .",
    "thus we combine the experimental binding energy for the neutron - rich nucleus @xmath16 together with the hartree - fock value for @xmath17 to provide an extrapolation for the proton - rich binding energy :    @xmath18    the method is similar to the one used by ormand @xcite for the proton - rich nuclei with @xmath19 .",
    "in @xcite the displacement energies are based upon shell - model configuration mixing which includes coulomb and csb interactions with parameters for the single - particle energies and strengths which are fitted to this mass region . in the present work , which covers the region @xmath0 ,",
    "the displacement energies are based upon skyrme hartree - fock calculations with a global set of parameters which are determined from the properties of closed - shell nuclei and nuclear matter .",
    "the csb part of the interaction has one parameter which was adjusted to reproduce the displacement energies in the @xmath20 mass region @xcite .",
    "the displacement energies for all but the lightest nuclei can be reproduced with the constant csb interaction given in @xcite , and we use the same csb interaction for the extrapolations to higher mass discussed here .",
    "the calculations presented here are relevant for the masses of proton - rich nuclei via their connection with their mirror neutron - rich analogues .",
    "we are not able to improve upon the masses of nuclei with @xmath1 , and as will be discussed , the relative large errors which remain for the @xmath21ge and @xmath22se masses provide now the dominant uncertainty in the rp - process calculations .",
    "details of the hartree - fock calculations will be discussed , and a comparison between the calculated and experimental displacement energies for the @xmath0 mass region will be made .",
    "then the extrapolations for the proton - rich masses and the associated one- and two - proton separation energies will be presented . the proton drip line which is established by this extrapolation",
    "will be compared to experiment , and the nuclei which will be candidates for one- and two - proton decay will be discussed .",
    "finally we explore the significance of the new extrapolation for the rp process in type i x - ray bursts .",
    "the skx@xmath14 interaction is used to carry out hartree - fock calculations for all nuclei in the range @xmath23 and @xmath24 .",
    "the binding energies are then combined in pairs to obtain theoretical displacement energies for @xmath0 and @xmath25 to @xmath26 :    @xmath27    the calculation is similar to those presented in @xcite , but several refinements are made .",
    "the single - particle states in proton - rich nuclei become unbound beyond the proton - drip line . in the nuclei",
    "we consider they are unbound by up to about 2 mev . since 2 mev is small compared to the height of the coulomb barrier ( about 6 mev at a radius of 7 fm ) , the states are  quasi - bound \" and have a small proton - decay width ( on the order of kev or smaller ) . to obtain the quasi - bound wave functions we put the hf potential in a box with a radius of 20 fm and a depth of 20 mev . in all cases",
    "we consider , the dependence of the results on the form of the external potential is negligible as long as the radius is greater than about 10 fm and the potential depth is greater than about 10 mev .    in @xcite",
    "the occupation numbers of the spherical valence states were filled sequentially , and in this mass region they always occur in the order f@xmath28 , p@xmath29 , f@xmath30 , p@xmath31 and g@xmath32 .",
    "we have improved on this scheme by carrying out an exact pairing ( ep ) calculation @xcite at each stage of the hf iteration .",
    "the exact pairing model has recently been discussed in @xcite .",
    "the ep method uses the single - particle energies from the hf calculation together with a fixed set of @xmath33 two - body matrix elements and gives the orbit occupations and the pairing correlation energy .",
    "the orbit occupations are then used together with the hf radial wave functions to calculate the nucleon densities which go into the skyrme energy density functional .",
    "this procedure is iterated until convergence ( about 60 iterations ) .",
    "the pairing is calculated for protons and neutrons with the same set of two - body matrix elements taken from the fpd6 interaction for the pf shell @xcite and the bonn - c renormalized g matrix for the matrix elements involving the g@xmath32 orbit @xcite . for those nuclei",
    "we consider here , the occupation of the g@xmath32 orbit is always small .",
    "it is known that deformed components of the 2s-1d-0 g shell are essential for the nuclear ground states above @xmath34 as indicated by the sudden drop in the energy of the 2@xmath35 state from 709 kev in @xmath36kr to 261 kev in @xmath37sr @xcite .",
    "thus we do not go higher than @xmath34 .",
    "in addition , one can not always use eq .",
    "( 2 ) above @xmath34 since many of the masses of the neutron - rich nuclei are not known experimentally .",
    "the results we obtain are not very sensitive to the strength of the pairing interaction and the associated distribution of the nucleons between the @xmath38 and @xmath39 orbits , since these orbits have similar rms radii and single - particle coulomb shifts .",
    "for example , a 20 percent change in the strength of the pairing interaction results in displacement energy changes of less than 20 kev .",
    "if pairing is removed , the displacement energies can change by up to about 100 kev .",
    "thus , at the level of 100 kev accuracy pairing should be included , but it is not a crucial part of the model .    a final refinement has been to add a coulomb pairing contribution to the proton - proton @xmath40 matrix elements .",
    "the two - body coulomb matrix elements were calculated in a harmonic - oscillator basis .",
    "the coulomb pairing is then defined as the difference of the diagonal @xmath40 matrix elements from the @xmath41 weighted average ( which corresponds to the spherical part of the coulomb potential which is in the hf part of the calculation ) .",
    "the coulomb pairing matrix elements are 50 - 100 kev .    in fig .",
    "[ f1 ] the calculated displacement energies ( crosses ) are shown in comparison with experiment ( filled circles ) in cases where both proton- and neutron - rich masses have been measured and with the awe ( squares ) in cases where the mass of the proton - rich nucleus is based upon the awe . the corresponding differences between experiment and theory are shown in fig .",
    "[ f2 ] including the experimental or awe error bars .",
    "it can be seen that when the displacement energy is measured the agreement with the calculation is excellent to within an rms deviation of about 100 kev .",
    "the most exceptional deviation is that for @xmath42 involving the @xmath43ni-@xmath43fe mirror pair ; a confirmation of the experimental mass for @xmath43ni ( which has a 50 kev error ) would be worthwhile .",
    "the comparison based upon the awe ( squares ) shows a much larger deviation with typically up to 500 kev differences , but the awe error assumed is sometimes ( but not always ) large enough to account for the spread .",
    "the implication of this comparison is that the error in the hf extrapolation of the displacement energies is probably much less than the error in the awe of the displacement energies .",
    "in particular , one notices in fig .",
    "[ f1 ] in the region @xmath44 that the displacement energy based upon the awe shows a small oscillation which is not present in the hf calculation and which is not present in the experimental data for @xmath45 .",
    "the next step is to use eq .  ( 2 ) to calculate the binding energy of the proton - rich nuclei based upon the hf calculation of the displacement energy together with the experimental binding energy of the neutron - rich nucleus @xcite .",
    "the only neutron - rich nucleus whose mass is not yet experimentally measured is @xmath15br for which we use the awe value .",
    "the binding energies for the hf extrapolations for the proton - rich nuclei are given an error based upon the experimental error of the neutron - rich binding energy folded in quadrature with an assumed theoretical error of 100 kev .",
    "the hf extrapolated set of binding energies for proton - rich nuclei together with the experimental binding energies for nuclei with @xmath3 and neutron - rich nuclei provides a complete set of values from which the one- and two - proton separation energies are obtained .",
    "the masses for the @xmath3 nuclei @xmath46as , @xmath22se , @xmath47br , are not measured and we use the awe value .",
    "the mass for @xmath48rb has a relatively large experimental error .",
    "results for the one- and two - proton separation energies are shown in fig .",
    "the first line in each box is the one - proton separation energy ( and the associated error ) based upon the awe with the associated error .",
    "the second line is the one - proton separation energy based upon the hf extrapolation , and the third line is the two - proton separation energy based upon the hf extrapolation .",
    "the error in the separation energies is the error for the binding energies of the parent and daughter nuclei folded in quadrature .    the double line in fig .",
    "[ f3 ] is the proton - drip line beyond which the one - proton separation energy and/or the two - proton separation energy becomes negative .",
    "however , due to the coulomb barrier , some of the nuclei beyond the proton - drip line may have lifetimes which are long enough to be able to observe them in radioactive beam experiments .",
    "the observation of @xmath49as in the experiment of blank et al .",
    "@xcite excludes half - lives which are much shorter than 1 @xmath50s which indicates that it is unbound by less than 400 kev .",
    "the identification of @xmath49as as a @xmath51-emitter by winger et al .",
    "@xcite together with the non - observation of emitted protons by robertson et al .",
    "@xcite indicates that it is unbound by less than 250  kev .",

    "the non - observation of @xmath52br in the radioactive beam experiments of blank et al .",
    "@xcite and pfaff et al .",
    "@xcite means that its lifetime is less than 24 nsec which implies that it is proton unbound by more than 500 kev @xcite .",

    "@xcite gives an upper limit of 30 nsec for the half - life which implies that @xmath53rb is proton unbound by more than 570 kev , again in agreement ( within error ) of the present hf result .",
    "thus all of the current experimental data are consistent with our calculations .",
    "the proton - drip line has not yet been reached for most @xmath54 values . beyond the proton - drip line",
    "there are several candidates for nuclei which should be explored for one - proton emission : @xmath43cu , @xmath55ge , @xmath21as , @xmath22br , @xmath52br , @xmath36rb and @xmath53rb .",
    "the most promising candidates for the illusive diproton emission ( in addition to @xmath56ni @xcite ) are @xmath21zn , @xmath57ge , @xmath58se , @xmath59kr and @xmath15sr .",
    "estimated lifetime ranges for these diproton decays are given by ormand @xcite .",
    "the rp process beyond ni plays a critical role during hydrogen burning at high temperatures and densities on the surface of accreting neutron stars in x - ray bursters and x - ray pulsars @xcite .",
    "nuclear masses are among the most important input parameters in rp - process calculations , as they sensitively determine the balance between proton capture and the inverse process , ( @xmath60,p ) photodisintegration .",
    "it is this ( @xmath60,p ) photodisintegration that prevents the rp process from continuing via proton captures , once a nucleus close to the proton drip line is reached .",
    "this nucleus becomes then a `` waiting point '' as the rp process has to proceed at least in part , via the slow @xmath61 decay .",
    "the effective lifetime of the waiting points in the rp process determines the overall processing time scale , energy generation , and the final abundance distribution . at a waiting point nucleus ( z , n ) , a local ( p,@xmath60)-(@xmath60,p ) equilibrium is established with the following isotones ( z+1,n ) , ( z+2,n ) .",
    "the effective proton capture flow destroying waiting point nuclei and reducing their lifetime is then governed by the saha equation and the rate of the reaction leading out of the equilibrium .",
    "because of the odd - even structure of the proton drip line 2 cases have to be distinguished @xcite . for temperatures below @xmath62 1.4  gk equilibrium",
    "is only established with the following isotone ( z+1,n ) . in this case , the destruction rate of the waiting point nucleus via proton captures @xmath63 is determined by the saha equation and the proton capture rate on the following isotone ( z+1,n ) . the total destruction rate of the waiting point nucleus ( z , n ) is then given by the sum of proton capture and @xmath51-decay rates : @xmath64 @xmath65 is the @xmath51-decay rate of nucleus ( z , n ) , @xmath66 the hydrogen abundance , @xmath67 the mass density , @xmath68 the proton spin , @xmath69 the partition function of nucleus ( z , n ) , @xmath70 the temperature , @xmath71 the reduced mass of nucleus ( z , n ) plus proton , @xmath72 the proton capture q - value of the waiting point nucleus , and @xmath73 the proton capture rate on the nucleus ( z+1,n ) . for higher temperatures local equilibrium",
    "is maintained between the waiting point nucleus ( z , n ) and the next two following isotones ( z+1,n ) and ( z+2,n ) . in this case , @xmath63 is given by the saha equation and the @xmath51-decay rate of the final nucleus @xmath74 , and the total destruction rate @xmath75 of the waiting point nucleus becomes : @xmath76 in both cases , the destruction rate of a waiting point nucleus depends exponentially either on its one - proton capture q - value @xmath72 or two - proton capture q - value @xmath77 .",
    "nuclear masses therefore play a critical role in determining the rp - process waiting points and their effective lifetimes .",
    "it has been shown before that the most critical waiting point nuclei for the rp process beyond ni are @xmath21ge , @xmath22se and @xmath36kr @xcite . with the exception of @xmath78ni and @xmath79zn , these nuclei are by far the longest - lived isotopes in the rp - process path .",
    "the reason for those three nuclei being the most critical ones is that with increasing charge number the @xmath1 line moves closer to the proton drip line and away from stability . therefore , proton capture q - values on even - even @xmath1 nuclei , which are favored in the rp process because of the odd - even structure of the proton drip line , decrease with increasing charge number , while the @xmath51-decay q - values become larger .",
    "@xmath21ge , @xmath22se and @xmath36kr happen to be located in the `` middle '' , where proton capture q - values are already low enough to suppress proton captures and allow @xmath51 decay to compete , but at the same time @xmath51-decay q - values are still small enough for half - lives to be long compared to rp - process time scales .",
    "the critical question is to what degree proton captures can reduce the long @xmath51-decay lifetimes of @xmath21ge ( 63.7  s half - life ) , @xmath22se ( 35.5  s half - life ) and @xmath36kr ( 17.2  s half - life ) . as eqs .",
    "[ eq2p1 ] and [ eq2p2 ] show , the answer depends mainly on the one- and two - proton capture q - values .",
    "unfortunately , experimental data exist for none of the relevant q - values .",
    "the only available experimental information are upper limits of the one - proton capture q - values of @xmath22se and @xmath36kr from the non - observation of @xmath52br @xcite and @xmath53rb @xcite , and the lower limits on the one - proton capture q - value on @xmath49as from its identification as a @xmath51-emitter in radioactive beam experiments ( see sec .",
    "[ secsp ] ) .",
    "while these data provide some constraints , accurate q - values are needed for the calculations and have to be predicted by theory .",
    "the new masses calculated in this work cover exactly this critical mass range , and provide improved predictions for all the relevant q - values in the @xmath8072 mass region ( see fig .",
    "[ f3 ] ) . as discussed in sec .",
    "[ secsp ] , all of our new predictions are compatible with the existing experimental limits .    to explore the impact of the new mass predictions on rp - process models , we performed calculations with a 1-d , one zone x - ray burst model @xcite .",
    "ignition conditions are based on a mass accretion rate of 0.1 times the eddington accretion rate , an internal heat flux from the neutron star surface of 0.15  mev / nucleon , an accreted matter metallicity of 10@xmath81 and a neutron star with 1.4 solar masses and 10  km radius .    in principle , proton separation energies can influence the reaction flow in two ways .",
    "first , they affect the forward to reverse rate ratios for proton capture reactions and the local ( p,@xmath60)-(@xmath60,p ) equilibria through the @xmath82 term in the saha equation ( in eqs .",
    "[ eq2p1 ] and [ eq2p2 ] ) .",
    "this leads to an exponential mass dependence of the waiting point lifetimes .",
    "second , theoretical predictions of reaction rates @xmath83 ( in eq .",
    "[ eq2p1 ] ) depend also on the adopted q - values . in this work",
    "we choose to take into account both effects . to explore the impact of q - value uncertainties on proton capture reaction rate calculations we use the statistical model code smoker @xcite .",
    "even though the nuclei in question are close to the proton drip line a statistical approach is justified in most cases because reaction rates tend to become important only for larger q - values when a local ( p,@xmath60)-(@xmath60,p ) equilibrium can not be established . then the level density tends to be sufficient for the statistical model approach .",
    "based on the new reaction rates we then use our new q - values to recalculate ( @xmath60,p ) photodisintegration rates via detailed balance as discussed in @xcite .    for the relevant temperature range between 1 - 2  gk",
    ", our new proton capture reaction rates vary in most cases not more than a factor of two within the explored mass uncertainties .",
    "an exception among the relevant reaction rates are the proton capture rates on @xmath84as , @xmath85br , and @xmath86rb .",
    "these rates show a somewhat stronger variation of typically a factor of 4  6 as the associated proton capture q - values are particularly uncertain .",
    "[ f4 ] shows two examples for the q - value dependence of statistical model reaction rates .",
    "generally , a larger q - value leads to larger rates , as the higher excitation energy of the compound nucleus opens up more possibilities for its decay . for reference ,",
    "[ f4 ] also shows the rates listed in @xcite , which had been calculated using q - values from the finite range droplet mass model ( frdm1992 ) @xcite .    to disentangle the different effects of mass uncertainties",
    "quantitatively we performed test calculations in which changes in masses were only taken into account in the calculation of the ( @xmath60,p ) photodisintegration rates , while the proton capture rates were kept the same .",
    "these test calculations lead to very similar luminosity and burst time scale variations as presented in this paper .",
    "discrepancies were at most 8% in the luminosity and 0.1% in the burst timescale .",
    "this can be understood from eq .",
    "[ eq2p1 ] and [ eq2p2 ] .",
    "for example , a change of 1.37  mev in the proton capture q - value changes the @xmath49as reaction rate and therefore the lifetime of the @xmath21ge waiting point nucleus by a factor of 34 ( see fig .  [ f4 ] and eq .",
    "[ eq2p1 ] ) .",
    "however , the same 1.37  mev q - value change in the @xmath82 term in eq .",
    "[ eq2p2 ] would result in a lifetime change of 6 orders of magnitude ( for a typical @xmath87  kev ) .",
    "we therefore conclude that the impact of mass uncertainties on rp process calculations through changes in theoretical reaction rate calculations within the statistical model is much smaller than the impact through changes in ( p,@xmath60)/(@xmath60,p ) reaction rate ratios .",
    "the following calculations were performed with different assumptions on masses beyond the @xmath1 line from @xmath88 - 38 : skx based on the mass predictions of this work , skx - min with all proton capture q - values set to the lowest value , and skx - max with all proton capture q - values set to the highest values within the error bars of our binding energy predictions .",
    "a similar set of calculations has been performed for the mass extrapolations of audi and wapstra 1995 @xcite ( aw95 ) and are labeled aw , aw - min , and aw - max .",
    "[ f5 ] shows the x - ray burst light curve , the nuclear energy generation rate , the abundances of the most important waiting point nuclei and the hydrogen and helium abundances as a function of time for all our calculations . as an example ,",
    "[ f6 ] shows the time integrated reaction flow corresponding to the skx calculation . while the @xmath89p and rp processes below @xmath78ni are responsible for the rapid luminosity rise at the beginning of the burst , processing through the slow waiting points @xmath21ge , @xmath22se , @xmath36kr and the operation of the snsbte cycle ( indicated by the @xmath90sn abundance ) lead to an extended burst tail . the rp process from @xmath78ni to @xmath21ge , and the slowdown at @xmath21ge lead to a pronounced peak in the energy generation rate around 50  s after burst maximum .",
    "in principle the other waiting points have a similar effect , but the corresponding peaks in the energy production are much wider and therefore not noticeable .    fig .",
    "[ f7 ] compares x - ray burst light curves for different assumptions on nuclear masses .",
    "generally , lower proton capture q - values enhance photodisintegration and favor the waiting point nuclei in local equilibria .",
    "both effects lead to a slower reaction flow and therefore to less luminous but longer lasting burst tails . even though the uncertainties in our new mass predictions are significantly smaller than in aw95 , they still allow for a burst length variation from @xmath91  @xmath92 and a luminosity variation of about a factor of 2 ( skx - min and skx - max ) .",
    "the lower limit q - value calculation with aw95 masses ( aw - min ) is similar to our lower limit ( skx - min ) , but the larger uncertainties in the aw95 masses lead to large differences in the upper limits ( skx - max and aw - max ) and would imply significantly shorter bursts with much more luminous tails ( aw - max ) .",
    "however , some of the large proton capture q - values in aw - max and to a lesser degree in skx - max are already constrained by the experiments on @xmath52br and @xmath53rb . if those constraints are taken into account one obtains the aw - maxexp and skx - maxexp calculations respectively , which are also shown in fig .",
    "the skx - maxexp and aw - maxexp light curves are very similar .",
    "the dependence of the light curves on the choice of proton capture q - values can be understood entirely from the changes in @xmath51-decay and proton - capture branchings of the main waiting points @xmath21ge , @xmath22se , and @xmath36kr shown in table  [ tabbranch ] . the calculations with the lower limits on proton capture q - values ( skx - min and aw - min ) do not differ much as they all predict that proton captures do not play a role . however , for the upper limits sizable proton capture branches occur and lead to significant reductions in the lifetimes of the waiting points . in our upper limit ( skx - max )",
    "we obtain 26% proton capture on @xmath22se ( via 2p capture ) and 86% proton capture on @xmath21ge , while proton captures on @xmath36kr , with 8% , play only a minor role .",
    "these branchings become even larger for the aw95 upper limit calculations ( aw - maxexp and aw - max ) .",
    "note that @xmath51 decay of @xmath79zn is negligible ( see table  [ tabbranch ] ) because proton capture dominates for the whole range of nuclear masses considered here .",
    "the importance of the one - proton capture q - values in the determination of lifetimes for rp - process waiting points has been discussed extensively before @xcite .",
    "this importance is clearly expressed by the large changes in branching ratios and light curves when experimental constraints ( which only exist for one - proton separation energies ) are imposed on the aw - max calculations leading to aw - maxexp ( fig .  [ f7 ] and table  [ tabbranch ] ) . however , the two - proton capture q - values can be equally important .",
    "for example , the proton capture branching on @xmath22se changes by an order of magnitude from 2% in aw to 15% in aw - maxexp .",
    "this change is entirely due to the change in the @xmath47kr proton separation energy from 1.86  mev in aw to 2.4  mev in aw - maxexp as the proton capture q - value on @xmath22se is very similar ( only 0.05  mev difference ) .",
    "the reason for this sensitivity is the onset of photodisintegration of @xmath47kr that depends very sensitively on its proton separation energy .",
    "as soon as temperatures are sufficiently high for @xmath47kr(@xmath60,2p)@xmath22se to play a role , @xmath22se , @xmath52br , and @xmath47kr are driven into a local ( p,@xmath60)-(@xmath60,p ) equilibrium .",
    "with rising temperature the proton capture on @xmath22se drops then quickly to zero , because the temperature independent and slow @xmath51 decay of @xmath47kr in eq .",
    "[ eq2p2 ] can not provide a substantial leakage out of the equilibrium .",
    "this is different from the situation at lower temperatures described by eq .",
    "[ eq2p1 ] where a lower equilibrium abundance of @xmath52br at higher temperatures can be somewhat compensated by the increasing proton capture rate on @xmath52br .",
    "this effect is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ f8 ] which shows the lifetime of @xmath22se against proton capture and @xmath51 decay as a function of temperature for different choices of proton capture q - values .",
    "the lifetime equals the @xmath51-decay lifetime for low temperatures because of slow proton capture reactions , and at high temperatures because of the photodisintegration effect discussed above . for the aw masses ,",
    "the low proton separation energy of @xmath47kr leads to strong photodisintegration already at temperatures around 1.15  gk before proton captures can play a role .",
    "therefore proton captures never reduce the lifetime significantly . for aw - maxexp",
    ", the only change is a larger @xmath47kr proton separation energy of 2.4  mev .",
    "though @xmath52br is unbound by 500  kev , proton captures can reduce the lifetime of @xmath22se by about a factor of two around 1.4  gk before photodisintegration sets in and starts inhibiting further proton captures .",
    "this can be compared with the upper limits of our predictions for proton separation energies ( skx - max ) .",
    "the larger proton separation energy of @xmath52br allows an onset of proton captures at slightly lower temperatures , but the lower proton separation energy of @xmath47kr leads also to an onset of photodisintegration at somewhat lower temperatures thus effectively shifting the drop in lifetime by about 0.1  gk .",
    "note that it is not only the amount of lifetime reduction , but also how well necessary conditions match the actual conditions during the cooling of the x - ray burst that determine the role of proton captures and therefore the overall time scale of the rp process . as fig .",
    "[ f8 ] shows , both depends sensitively on the nuclear masses .",
    "a long - standing question is how the nuclear physics , and in particular the properties of the long - lived waiting points @xmath21ge , @xmath22se , and @xmath36kr affect the end - point of the rp process . even for our lowest proton capture q - values where proton captures on @xmath22se and @xmath36kr",
    "become negligible , we still find that the rp process reaches the snsbte cycle @xcite .",
    "[ f9 ] shows the final abundance distribution for the two extreme cases - our calculation with the slowest ( skx - min ) and the fastest ( aw - max ) reaction flow . in both cases , the most abundant mass number is @xmath93 , which is due to accumulation of material in the snsbte cycle at @xmath90sn .",
    "the main difference between the abundance patterns are the abundances that directly relate to the waiting points at @xmath80 , 68 , and 72 and scale roughly with the waiting point lifetime .",
    "in addition , for aw - max nuclei in the @xmath94103 mass range are about a factor of 3 more abundant because of the faster processing and the depletion of @xmath80 , 68 , and 72 .",
    "we have made a new set of predictions for the masses of proton - rich nuclei on the basis of the displacement energies obtained from spherical hartree - fock calculations with the skx@xmath14 skyrme interaction @xcite .",
    "skx@xmath14 provides a large improvement in the displacement energies over those obtained with other skyrme interactions via the addition of a one - parameter charge - symmetry breaking component @xcite .",
    "a comparison with the experimental displacement energies measured in the mass region a=41 - 59 indicates that the accuracy of the calculated displacement energies is about 100 kev .",
    "we thus use this as a measure of the uncertainty expected for the higher mass region of interest in this paper .",
    "experimental masses for some proton - rich nuclei in the mass region a=60 - 70 will be required to test our predictions . at the upper end",
    ", we may expect some deviation due to the very deformed shapes which involve the excitation of many @xmath95-shell nucleons into the @xmath96 ( @xmath97 ) shell which go beyond our spherical approach .",
    "in addition to the application to the rp - process , we have discussed the implication of the present model for the proton drip line .",
    "the most promising candidates for diproton emission are @xmath21zn , @xmath57ge , @xmath58se , @xmath59kr and @xmath15sr .",
    "our rp - process calculations based upon the masses obtained in the present model and those obtained from the audi - waptra mass extrapolations demonstrate clearly the sensitivity of x - ray burst tails on nuclear masses at and beyond the @xmath1 line between ni and sr .",
    "such a sensitivity on the q - values for proton capture on @xmath21ge and @xmath22se has been pointed out before by koike et al .",
    "@xcite based on a similar x - ray burst model",
    ". however , koike et al .",
    "@xcite used a limited reaction network including only nuclei up to kr . as we show in this paper , this is not sufficient for any assumption on nuclear masses , and as a consequence we find very different light curves and final abundances .",
    "our new calculation leads to tighter constraints on proton capture q - values as compared with the aw95 mass extrapolations ( see fig .",
    "the first radioactive beam experiments including the nonobservation of @xmath52br and @xmath53rb have also begun to provide important constraints .",
    "if those experiments are taken into account , our new predictions do not lead to substantially tighter limits , with the exception of the proton capture on @xmath21ge , where no experimental upper limit on the proton capture q - value exists .",
    "our new calculations increase the minimum @xmath51 branching at @xmath21ge by an order of magnitude from 1% to 14% , leading to a lower limit of the average @xmath21ge half - life in the rp process of 12.6  s instead of 0.9  s. as a consequence , we predict a smooth and continuous drop in the light curve during the first 3040  s after the maximum , as opposed to the hump predicted with aw - max .",
    "however , uncertainties in the mass predictions are still too large to sufficiently constrain the light curves and to determine the role that proton captures play in the reduction of waiting point lifetimes .",
    "while we find that within the errors of our mass predictions proton capture on @xmath36kr is negligible , our predicted average proton capture branchings for @xmath21ge and @xmath22se still cover a large range of 0.5%86% and 0.0% - 26% respectively ( of course this is a model - dependent result - for example more hydrogen or a higher density could strongly increase the proton capture branches ) . to a large extent",
    "this is because of the large uncertainties in the masses of @xmath1 nuclei @xmath21ge ( measured : 270  kev ) , @xmath22se ( aw95 extrapolated : 310  kev ) , and @xmath36kr ( measured : 290  kev ) @xcite that can not be determined with the method presented here .",
    "in addition , uncertainties in the masses of mirror nuclei increase the errors for @xmath53rb ( 170  kev ) and @xmath47kr ( 160  kev ) substantially beyond the @xmath62100  kev accuracy of our predicted coulomb shifts .",
    "overall , this results in typical uncertainties of the order of 300  kev for several of the critical proton capture q - values .    to summarize",
    ", uncertainties in the masses of the nuclei that determine the proton capture branches on @xmath21ge and @xmath22se represent a major nuclear physics uncertainty in x - ray burst light curve calculations . the relevant nuclei",
    "are listed in the upper part of table  [ tabexp ] together with the currently available mass data and their uncertainties .",
    "the proton capture branches on @xmath79zn and @xmath36kr are of similar importance , but are sufficiently well constrained by current experimental limits and theoretical calculations .",
    "however , both the experimental and the theoretical limits are strongly model dependent . therefore , improved experimental mass data would still be important to confirm the present estimates .",
    "these nuclei are listed in the lower part of table  [ tabexp ] . as discussed in sec .",
    "[ secsp ] there is experimental evidence indicating proton stability of all the nuclei listed , except for @xmath52br and @xmath53rb , which are probably proton unbound .",
    "mass measurements of the proton bound nuclei could be performed with a variety of techniques including ion trap measurements , time of flight measurements , or @xmath51 decay studies .",
    "recent developments in the production of radioactive beams allow many of the necessary experiments to be performed at existing radioactive beam facilities such as anl , ganil , gsi , isolde , isac , and the nscl .",
    "mass measurements of the proton unbound nuclei @xmath52br and @xmath53rb require their population via transfer reactions from more stable nuclei , or by @xmath51 decay from more unstable nuclei .",
    "both are significantly more challanging as much higher beam intensities or the production of more exotic nuclei are required , respectively .",
    "of course , burst timescales depend sensitively on the amount of hydrogen that is available at burst ignition .",
    "the more hydrogen that is available the longer the rp process and the longer the burst tail timescale . in this work",
    "we use a model with a large initial hydrogen abundance ( close to solar ) to explore the impact of mass uncertainties on x - ray burst light curves .",
    "this allows us to draw conclusions on the uncertainties in predictions of the longest burst timescales and the heaviest elements that can be produced in x - ray bursts .",
    "the former is important for example in light of recent observations of very long thermonuclear x - ray bursts from gx 17 + 2 @xcite , the latter for the question of the origin of p nuclei discussed below .",
    "nevertheless we expect a similar light curve sensitivity to masses for other models as long as there is enough hydrogen for the rp process to reach the @xmath98 mass region . in our one zone model",
    "we find that this requires about a 0.35 - 0.45 hydrogen mass fraction at ignition . even though the burst temperatures and densities vary somewhat with the initial conditions we find shorter , but otherwise very similar reaction paths governed by the same waiting point nuclei .",
    "for bursts with initial hydrogen abundances below @xmath62 0.3 the rp process does not reach the @xmath99 mass region anymore and the mass uncertainties discussed in this work become irrelevant .",
    "observed type i x - ray bursts show a wide variety of timescales ranging from 10  s to hours .",
    "our goal is to improve the underlying nuclear physics so that the observed burst timescales can be used to infer tight constraints on ignition conditions in type i x - ray bursts such as the amount of hydrogen available for a given burst .",
    "such constraints would be extremely useful as they could , for example , lead to constraints on the impact of rotation and magnetic fields on the fuel distribution on the neutron star surface as well as on the heat flux from the neutron star surface @xcite .",
    "our results indicate that without further theoretical or experimental improvements on nuclear masses it will not be possible to obtain such tight , quantitative constraints .",
    "nevertheless , some qualitative conclusions can already be drawn on the basis of our new mass predictions .",
    "our new results provide strong support for previous predictions that the rp process in the @xmath100 mass region slows down considerably leading to extended burst tails @xcite . as a consequence , the long bursts observed for example in gs  1826 - 24 @xcite",
    "can be explained by the presence of large amounts of hydrogen at ignition and can therefore be interpreted as a signature of the rp process .    even for our lowest proton capture q - values ,",
    "when @xmath22se and @xmath36kr slow down the rp process with their full @xmath51-decay lifetime the rp process still reaches the snsbte cycle .",
    "clearly , such a slowdown of the rp process does not lead to a premature termination of the rp process as has been suggested previously ( for example @xcite ) , but rather extends the burst time scale accordingly . as a consequence we find that hydrogen is completely consumed in our model .",
    "however , a slower rp process will produce more nuclei in the @xmath8072 range and less nuclei in the @xmath94103 mass range .",
    "interestingly , among the most sensitive abundances beyond @xmath101 is @xmath102ru , which is of special interest as it is one of the light p nuclei whose origin in the universe is still uncertain .",
    "p nuclei are proton rich , stable nuclei that can not be synthesized by neutron capture processes . while standard p process models can account for most of the p nuclei observed , they can not produce sufficient amounts of some light p nuclei such as @xmath103mo and @xmath104ru ( for example @xcite ) .",
    "costa et al .",
    "@xcite pointed out recently that a increase in the @xmath105ne(@xmath89,n ) reaction rate by a factor of 10 - 50 above the presently recommended rate could help solve this problem , but recent experimental data seem to rule out this possibility @xcite .",
    "alternatively , x - ray bursts have been proposed as nucleosynthesis site for these nuclei @xcite .",
    "an accurate determination of the @xmath102ru production in x - ray bursts requires therefore accurate masses in the @xmath100 mass range .",
    "further conclusions concerning x - ray bursts as a possible p process scenario have to wait for future self - consistent multi - zone calculations with the full reaction network , that include the transfer of the ashes into the interstellar medium during energetic bursts",
