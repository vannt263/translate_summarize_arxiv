    "fermi gases below the degeneracy temperature have been the subject of intensive research in the last years both experimentally and theoretically ( see for reviews @xcite ) .",
    "particular interest has been devoted to the possible superfluid state whose creation and properties have been studied for both negative and positive values of @xmath6-wave scattering lengths @xmath7 , characterizing the interaction between the particles . at the feshbach resonance @xcite @xmath7 becomes infinity and certain universal behavior shows up .",
    "an important aspect of the problem is that the gas is trapped and thereby is inhomogeneous .",
    "when the energy gap function exceeds the level spacing near the fermi sea a local density approximation ( lda ) is applicable . as a simplest approach in its spirit neglecting the space gradients of the density and the gap function the thomas - fermi theory was generalized to include superfluid pair correlation results @xcite , when the system is treated in the generalized hartree - fock method @xcite .",
    "since the thomas - fermi approximation is widely used in case of trapped gases it is desirable to investigate systematically the corrections to it , even if they are expected to be small for large particle numbers , except in the surface region ( here the gradient corrections make explicitely visible the limits of the usual lda results ) . for particle numbers , however , which are treated in monte - carlo simulations the thomas - fermi theory needs corrections .",
    "more importantly it makes possible to extend the concept of universality at unitarity @xcite . in particlular",
    "we derive in this paper a universal prefactor for the von weizscker type correction to the generalized thomas - fermi theory ( see for a review of the von weizscker correction in normal systems @xcite ) .    in the present paper gradient corrections are calculated up to second order at zero temperature .",
    "baranov @xcite studied the gradient corrections even at finite temperatures in cases when eilenberger s equations @xcite are applicable .",
    "that approach is different from ours , which is free from this restriction .",
    "the applied technique here is based upon the equation of motion as expressed in terms of the green s functions .",
    "the method has been developed first to the electron gas of the atoms , which is of course a normal system @xcite .",
    "it has been generalized to superfluid state somewhat later independently for superconductors in slowly varying magnetic field @xcite and for nuclei @xcite .",
    "the latter work is most closely related to the present one .",
    "the resulting expressions are rather cumbersome , but considerably simplify at unitarity . to evaluate them we choose the mean - field bcs ( mf - bcs ) model introduced by leggett , eagles , nozires and schmitt - rink @xcite , which neglects the self - consistent hartree - type terms .",
    "we start however , from the generalized hartree - fock ( ghf ) model @xcite to present the results in a more complete form for future use .",
    "the hamiltonian is @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the trapping potential , @xmath10 is the chemical potential , @xmath11 describes the interaction and @xmath12 stands for the internal degrees of freedoms .",
    "we assume two equally populated hyperfine states and @xmath13 will be termed as spin . in ghf approximation",
    "the hamiltonian simplifies to @xmath14 here @xmath15 the first line in ( [ eq : mfham ] ) contains the one - particle term of ( [ eq : horig ] ) , the second line is the hartree term , the third is the fock term and furthermore the cooper pairing is represented by the last line , where @xmath16 the correlation functions @xmath17 and @xmath18 have to be determined self - consistently .",

    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec : formulation ] .",
    "we present the equations for the green s functions , while in section [ sec : pert_series ] .",
    "their perturbation series are presented .",
    "the self - consistent scheme for the density and the gap function is worked out in section [ sec : gradexpofphysq ] . up to second order in @xmath23 to the local density approximation , which can be regarded as a generalized thomas - fermi theory . in the second part of the paper",
    "the mf - bcs model is applied . in section [ sec : secordercorr ] .",
    "the second order corrections are evaluated perturbatively in the case of a general external potential .",
    "section [ sec : univprefactor ] . is devoted to the problems of the unitary gas , in particular the prefactor of the von weizscker type correction is calculated . in section [ sec : isotropictrap ] .",
    "the trap potential is assumed to be an isotropic harmonic one to make some features more visible .",
    "section [ sec : summary ] . contains the discussion of the results .",

    "the value of @xmath268 has been chosen in @xcite , while @xmath269 has been obtained in @xcite by assuming the validity of a kind of ginzburg - landau theory at zero temperature .",
