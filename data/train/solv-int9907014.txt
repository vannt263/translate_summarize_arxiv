    "the quadrilateral surface was first proposed in @xcite as the proper discrete analogue of a conjugate net on a surface , without any connection with integrability .    indeed , at the moment",
    ", the above construction does not seem to have anything to do with integrability ; to show its profound connection with the familiar integrability schemes it is necessary to generalize the picture to higher dimensions , imposing the planarity constraint on each two - dimensional @xmath20 surface of the lattice @xcite .",

    "they were first derived in  @xcite as integrable discrete analogues of the darboux equations for conjugate nets , but without any geometric characterization .",
    "we remark that , if a quadrilateral lattice exists , it is integrable by construction , since it is built out of the linear constraints ( [ eq : laplace ] ) .",
    "indeed , in the language of the theory of integrable systems , the planarity constraints correspond to the set of linear spectral problems ( [ eq : laplace ] ) and the resulting ql and its characterizing equations ( [ eq : mql - a ] ) correspond to the integrable nonlinear equations arising as the compatibility condition for such spectral problems .",
    "actually , in connection with integrability , certain constructions based on the quadrilateral surfaces were already known : the integrable discrete analogue of isothermic surfaces  @xcite and the laplace sequence of quadrilateral surfaces  @xcite , which provides the geometric meaning for the hirota equation ( see also section  [ sec : hir ] and  @xcite for more details ) .",
    "it is often convenient to reformulate equations ( [ eq : laplace ] ) as a first order system @xcite .",

    "the compatibility condition for the system ( [ eq : lin - x ] ) gives the following new form of the ql equations    @xmath33    and the scaling factors @xmath34 , called the lam coefficients , solve the linear equations    @xmath35    whose compatibility gives equations ( [ eq : mql - q ] ) again ; moreover @xmath36 .    the solution of the initial value problem for the ql is contained in the following result @xcite .",
