    "the physics of electronic phase separation is very popular nowadays in connection with the strongly correlated electron systems , especially , in materials with the colossal magnetoresistance such as manganites  @xcite .",
    "the phase separation manifests itself in other magnetic materials such as cobaltites  @xcite , nickelates  @xcite and also in low - dimensional magnets  @xcite .",
    "the nanoscale inhomogeneities were also widely discussed for heavy fermion compounds  @xcite , string oscillators in magnetic semiconductors  @xcite , electron - hole droplets in semiconducting nanostructures  @xcite , and high - tc superconductors  @xcite , in particular , in relation to the phase separation in the @xmath3 model  @xcite and to the formation of paramagnetic spin bags  @xcite .",
    "the formation of small ferromagnetic ( fm ) metallic droplets ( magnetic polarons or ferrons ) in antiferromagnetic ( afm ) insulating matrix was discussed beginning from works refs .  .",
    "in application to manganites , this problem was addressed in a number of papers ( see for the review ref .  ) . usually in manganites ,",
    "the rigid ( well - defined ) magnetic polarons with very rapidly decreasing tails of magnetic distortion are considered . in other words ,",
    "the intermediate region where the canting angle @xmath4 changes from @xmath5 ( fm domain ) to @xmath6 ( afm domain ) is narrow ( of the order of interatomic distance @xmath7 ) , so the radius of the magnetic polaron @xmath8 is a well defined quantity .",
    "moreover , the tails of magnetic distortions exponentially decrease for the distances @xmath9 ( outside the ferron ) .",
    "long ago , de gennes discussed the possibility of a slow decay of the afm order distortions due to the magneto - dipole interaction  @xcite . an attempt to get such a type of coated magnetic polarons",
    "was made for a one - dimensional ( 1d ) afm chain in refs .  .",
    "these calculations show that the characteristic length of the distorted spin surrounding can be much larger than the size of the trapping region",
    ". however , in 1d , the coated ferrons turn out to be metastable objects while rigid magnetic polarons correspond to the ground state  @xcite . a continuous 3d model of coated magnetic polarons with the account taken of the tails of electron wave function in the afm matrix ( which appeared when we consider quantum nature of canting ) was studied in ref .  .",
    "unfortunately , even in this more advanced approach , the tails of the magnetic distortions exponentially decrease outside the ferron .",
    "however , in ref .  , the gradient contribution to the magnetic energy proportional to @xmath10 was not included to the variational procedure to reduce the order of the differential equations under study . in the present paper , we generalize the 1d model considered in ref .   to the 2d and 3d cases .",
    "in contrast to the approach of ref .  , we take into account the magnetic anisotropy , discrete nature of the lattice , and the gradient terms . appropriate account of the gradient terms leads to a slower decrease of magnetic distortions outside the ferron .    in our model",
    ", we consider an electron , which is bound at a donor impurity by the coulomb attractive potential .",
    "the coulomb potential @xmath11 is assumed to be strong in comparison to the other relevant interactions .",
    "namely @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is the hund s rule coupling , @xmath14 is the afm exchange interaction , @xmath15 is a hopping integral , @xmath16 is a constant of the magnetic anisotropy . in this range of parameters ,",
    "the radius of the electron localization is of the order of interatomic distance @xmath7 .",
    "the magnetic distortions outside the electron localization region ( ferron core ) are shown to decrease with the distance @xmath17 as @xmath2 and @xmath1 in the 3d and 2d cases , respectively .",
    "in contrast to the 1d model  @xcite , these coated ferrons correspond to the ground state of the system .",
    "note that the 2d case widely discussed in our paper could be rather relevant to experiment since a lot of magnetic oxides including manganites and cobaltites have layered magnetic structure and a 2d structure is simply a limiting case of the layered system",
    ". actually , as it was shown by neutron diffraction studies  @xcite , the ferrons in low - doped manganites could be platelets characteristic for 2d rather than spherical droplets characteristic for 3d .    at the end of the paper , we find the applicability range of the proposed approach by taking into account the tails of the electron wave function outside the ferron .",
    "our results enrich the concept of microscopic phase separation for the localized magnetic polarons .",
    "we consider 2d or 3d cubic lattice of antiferromagnetically coupled local spins @xmath18 treated as classical vectors .",
    "we assume that the crystal has uniaxial magnetic anisotropy , with @xmath19 axis being the easy axis .",
    "the nonmagnetic donor impurities are placed in the center of some unit cells of the lattice .",

    "<S> the structure of bound magnetic polarons in an antiferromagnetic matrix is studied in the framework of two - dimensional ( 2d ) and three - dimensional ( 3d ) kondo - lattice models in the double exchange limit ( @xmath0 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the conduction electron is bound by a nonmagnetic donor impurity and forms a ferromagnetic core of the size about the electron localization length ( bound magnetic polaron ) . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the magnetic polaron produces rather long - range extended spin distortions of the antiferromagnetic background around the core . in a wide range of distances , these distortions decay as @xmath1 and @xmath2 in 2d and 3d cases , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , the magnetization of the core is smaller than its saturation value . </S>",
    "<S> such a magnetic polaron state is favorable in energy in comparison to usually considered one ( saturated core without extended distortions ) . </S>"
