    "in @xcite , the authors introduce a model for stochastic gene expression to study the heterogeneity of cell populations .",
    "they assume that the cells , or for example the product of some gene , can be in two distinct states or colonies .",
    "let @xmath0 and @xmath1 be the sizes of these colonies , which are here considered as birth with migration processes .",
    "we assume that the birth rates are either @xmath2 or @xmath3 with @xmath4 , and that the associated migration rates @xmath5 and @xmath6 are such that @xmath7 , that is cells located in the colony having the smaller birth rate migrate at a higher rate to the colony with the higher birth rate than the other way round .",
    "if the birth and migration rates are assigned once and for all to a corresponding colony ( e.g. @xmath3 and @xmath6 to @xmath8 , and @xmath2 and @xmath5 to @xmath9 ) , then the mean sizes @xmath10 and @xmath11 satisfy the pair of differential equations ( see @xcite or @xcite ) @xmath12 according to @xcite , we say that cells of the first colony represented by @xmath0 are _ unfit _ ( they have the lower birth rates ) , and conversely that cells of the second colony represented by @xmath1 are _ fit_. the proportion of fit cells in the global population , @xmath13 , @xmath14 , satisfies the non - linear differential equation @xmath15    then , as @xmath16 , @xmath17 , where @xmath18 follows directly from ( [ fit ] ) , see section [ s.stationary ] .",
    "this describes the equilibrium value of the proportion of fit cells in a non - changing environment .",
    "fixing the values of the parameters @xmath6 , @xmath3 and @xmath2 , we can ask for the value of @xmath19 which maximizes the proportion of fit cells , i.e. the equilibrium value of @xmath20 : the optimal strategy is to keep all the fit cells in the fit state , that is to set their migration rate to zero , @xmath21 .",
    "this leads to @xmath22 , and thus the optimal solution would be a homogeneous population .",
    "observations reveal however that most cell populations are not homogeneous ; to explain this , the authors of @xcite propose to introduce a small modification in the model by allowing environmental changes ( for related questions in this context , see e.g. @xcite ) , and show through monte - carlo simulations that the homogeneous solution @xmath21 is then not always optimal .",
    "the idea in their model is to allow the birth and migration rates to switch at random times from one colony to the other , so that cells in the fit colony become unfit and vice versa .",
    "if for example an environmental change occurs at some random time @xmath23 ( @xmath24 ) , then the function @xmath25 representing the proportion of fit cells solves ( [ fit ] ) up to time @xmath26 , and just after @xmath26 , say at time @xmath27 , the fit cells corresponding to @xmath1 become unfit and vice versa .",
    "the proportion of fit cells @xmath25 is then switched to @xmath28 .",

    "the authors then use monte - carlo simulations to estimate the limiting value of the time averages along trajectories of the process @xmath25 , of the form @xmath39 this limiting average value is denoted by @xmath40 to express its dependency on the migration rate @xmath41 , when all the remaining parameters are fixed .",
    "their simulations indicate that there is a range of parameters ( @xmath6 not too large ) such that @xmath42 which means that heterogeneous populations are more adapted than homogeneous ones in a switching environment .    in this paper",
    ", we study mathematically the limiting behavior of the stochastic process @xmath25 and the associated time average @xmath43 by giving its stationary measure , and we provide mathematical formulas and numerical solutions , which might be of interest in practical laboratory experiments ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
