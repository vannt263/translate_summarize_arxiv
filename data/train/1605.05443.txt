    "the theory of positional games on graphs and hypergraphs goes back to the seminal papers of hales and jewett  @xcite and of erds and selfridge  @xcite .",
    "the theory has enjoyed explosive growth in recent years and has matured into an important area of combinatorics ( see the monograph of beck  @xcite , the recent monograph  @xcite and the survey  @xcite ) .",
    "there are several interesting types of positional games , the most natural of which are the so - called _",
    "strong games_.    let @xmath12 be a ( possibly infinite ) set and let @xmath13 be a family of finite subsets of @xmath12 .",
    "the _ strong game _",
    "@xmath14 is played by two players , called fp ( the first player ) and sp ( the second player ) , who take turns claiming previously unclaimed elements of the _ board _",
    "@xmath12 , one element per move .",
    "the winner of the game is the _ first _ player to claim all elements of a _ winning set _ @xmath15 . if no player wins the game after some finite number of moves , then the game is declared a _ draw_. a very simple but classical example of this setting is the game of tic - tac - toe .",
    "unfortunately , strong games are notoriously hard to analyze and to date not much is known about them . a simple yet elegant game - theoretic argument , known as _",
    "strategy stealing _ , shows that fp is guaranteed at least a draw in any strong game .",
    "moreover , using ramsey theory , one can sometimes prove that draw is impossible in a given strong game and thus fp has a winning strategy for this game .",
    "note that these arguments are purely existential and thus even if we know that fp has a winning / drawing strategy for some game , we might not know what it is .",
    "explicit winning strategies for fp in various natural strong games were devised in  @xcite and in  @xcite .",
    "these strategies are based on fast winning strategies for _ weak _ variants of the games in question .",
    "more on fast winning strategies can be found in  @xcite and  @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we study a natural family of strong games . for integers @xmath16 , consider the strong ramsey game @xmath17 .",
    "the board of this game is the edge set of @xmath18 and the winning sets are the copies of @xmath19 in @xmath18 . as noted above , by strategy stealing",
    ", fp has a drawing strategy in @xmath17 for every @xmath20 and @xmath21 .",
    "moreover , it follows from ramsey s famous theorem  @xcite ( see also  @xcite and  @xcite for numerous related results ) that , for every @xmath21 , there exists an @xmath9 such that @xmath17 has no drawing position and is thus fp s win for every @xmath11 .",
    "an explicit winning strategy for fp in @xmath17 is currently known ( and is very easy to find ) only for @xmath22 ( and every @xmath23 ) . moreover , for every @xmath24 , we do not know what is the smallest @xmath25 such that @xmath17 is fp s win for every @xmath11 .",
    "determining this value seems to be extremely hard even for relatively small values of @xmath21 .",
    "consider now the strong game @xmath26 .",
    "its board is the edge set of the countably infinite complete graph @xmath27 and its winning sets are the copies of @xmath19 in @xmath27 .",
    "even though the board of this game is infinite , strategy stealing still applies , i.e. , fp has a strategy which ensures that sp will never win @xmath26 .",
    "clearly , ramsey s theorem applies as well , i.e. , any red / blue colouring of the edges of @xmath27 yields a monochromatic copy of @xmath19 .",
    "hence , as in the finite version of the game , one could expect to combine these two arguments to deduce that fp has a winning strategy in @xmath26 .",
    "the only potential problem with this reasoning is that , by making infinitely many threats ( which are idle , as he can not win ) , sp might be able to delay fp indefinitely , in which case the game would be declared a draw . as with the finite version ,",
    "@xmath28 is an easy win for fp .",
    "the question whether @xmath26 is a draw or fp s win is wide open for every @xmath24 .",
    "in fact , using different terminology , it was posed by beck  @xcite as one of his `` 7 most humiliating open problems '' , where he considers even the case @xmath29 to be `` hopeless '' ( see also  @xcite and  @xcite for related problems ) .",
    "playing ramsey games , we do not have to restrict our attention to cliques , or even to graphs for that matter .",
    "for every integer @xmath30 and every @xmath1-uniform hypergraph @xmath3 , we can study the finite strong ramsey game @xmath31 and the infinite strong ramsey game @xmath0 .",
    "the board of the finite game @xmath31 is the edge set of the complete @xmath1-uniform hypergraph @xmath32 and the winning sets are the copies of @xmath3 in @xmath32 .",
    "as in the graph case , strategy stealing and hypergraph ramsey theory ( see , e.g. ,  @xcite ) shows that fp has winning strategies in @xmath31 for every @xmath3 and every sufficiently large @xmath20 .",
    "the board of the infinite game @xmath0 is the edge set of the countably infinite complete @xmath1-uniform hypergraph @xmath33 and the winning sets are the copies of @xmath3 in @xmath33 . as in the graph case ,",
    "strategy stealing shows that fp has drawing strategies in @xmath0 for every @xmath3 .",
    "hence , here too one could expect to combine strategy stealing and hypergraph ramsey theory to deduce that fp has a winning strategy in @xmath0 for every @xmath3 .",
    "our main result shows that , while it might be true that @xmath26 is fp s win for any @xmath24 , basing this solely on strategy stealing and ramsey theory is ill - founded .",
    "[ th::main ] there exists a @xmath4-uniform hypergraph @xmath34 such that the strong game @xmath5 is a draw .",
    "apart from being very surprising , theorem  [ th::main ] might indicate that strong ramsey games are even more complicated than we originally suspected .",
    "we discuss this further in section  [ sec::openprob ] .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows . in section  [ sec::notation ]",
    "we introduce some basic notation and terminology that will be used throughout this paper . in section  [ sec::sufficientcondition ]",
    "we prove that @xmath0 is a draw whenever @xmath3 is a @xmath1-uniform hypergraph which satisfies certain conditions . using the results of section  [ sec::sufficientcondition ] , we construct in section  [ sec::example ] a @xmath4-uniform hypergraph @xmath35 for which @xmath36 is a draw , thus proving theorem  [ th::main ] .",
    "finally , in section  [ sec::openprob ] we present some open problems .",

    "we denote its vertex set by @xmath37 and its edge set by @xmath38 .",
