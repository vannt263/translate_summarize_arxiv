    "since the early days of fractality,@xcite the scattering of electromagnetic ( em ) waves from fractal surfaces has been a field of intense activity .",
    "physical fractals appear ubiquitously in nature , possessing fractal properties within a broad , however finite , range of scales .",
    "therefore the study of classical wave scattering from fractals is a problem of interest not only from a fundamental point of view , but also from the practical knowledge that probing technologies such as surface optical characterization , remote sensing , radar , sonar , etc .",
    "can yield about a wide variety of systems .",
    "in fact , it is now well understood that many naturally occurring surfaces exhibit scale invariance , particularly in the form of self - affinity.@xcite    there exists a large amount of theoretical works devoted to wave scattering from fractal surfaces .",
    "most of them make use of approximations , such as kirchhoff approximation ( ka ) or perturbation methods , in order to obtain analytical expressions that are useful in certain regimes , but thereby imposing a constraint on the length scales over which fractality might be present .",
    "others include calculations within the rayleigh hypothesis and/or restricted to perfectly conducting surfaces . and only very recent works are capable of dealing with arbitrarily rough metal or dielectric surfaces,@xcite on the basis on the green s theorem integral equation formulation for rough surface scattering.@xcite    on the other hand , in addition to far field scattering , the near em field on self - affine fractals has attracted a great deal of attention.@xcite to a large extent , the interest lies in the observation in the near field intensity distributions , through photon scanning tunneling microscopy ( pstm ) , of large concentrations of em field intensity on _ bright spots_).@xcite the appearance of such _ localized optical modes _ is mediated by the roughness - induced excitation of surface - plasmon polaritons ( spp ) on very rough surfaces with subwavelength features .",
    "the occurrence of large surface em fields is indeed crucial to the em mechanism in surface - enhanced raman scattering ( sers ) and to other non - linear surface optical processes .",
    "furthermore , the predicted , enormously high values of the surface electric field intensity have been related to the recent observation of sers single molecule probing.@xcite    it is our aim to employ the above mentioned rigorous green s theorem formulation to study the far - field and near - field scattered from one - dimensionally rough , self - affine fractal ag surfaces , restricted to one dimension for the sake of computational limitations .",
    "the scattering model is described in sec .",
    "[ sec_eq ] .",
    "we focus on fractals preserving self - affinity from tens of microns to subwavelength dimensions .",
    "actually , we analyze the influence of the lower scale cutoff as is reduced from @xmath2 nm ( as used in refs . ) to a few nanometers .",
    "it should be mentioned that the effect on the far field of the lower scale cutoff in deterministic koch fractals has been previously studied.@xcite the results for the far - field and near - field calculations are presented in secs .",

    "a monochromatic , linearly polarized gaussian beam of frequency @xmath3 and @xmath4 amplitude half width @xmath5 impinges at an angle @xmath6 on a randomly rough surface @xmath7 .",
    "the rough interface separates vacuum from a semi - infinite silver volume occupying the lower half - space [ @xmath8 and characterized by an isotropic , frequency - dependent homogeneous dielectric function @xmath9 .    with the aim of solving this scattering problem for arbitrarily large roughness parameters ,",
    "we make use of the scattering integral equations based on the the application of green s second integral theorem.@xcite it is well known that this full vectorial formulation is considerably simplified when restricted to 1d surfaces and linear polarization , thereby being reduced to four scalar integral equations for the only nonzero component of either the electric field amplitude @xmath10 with @xmath11 for @xmath0 polarization , or the magnetic field amplitude @xmath12 with @xmath13 for @xmath1 polarization.@xcite two of these surface integral equations can be used as extended boundary conditions , which ( recalling the continuity relations across the interface ) lead to a system of two coupled integral equations for the surface field and its normal derivative .",
    "this can be solved numerically in the form of linear equations by means of a quadrature scheme.@xcite once these source functions are obtained , it is straightforward to calculate the far field scattered intensity,@xcite and in general the electric ( magnetic ) field amplitude for @xmath0 ( @xmath1 ) polarization at any point in vacuum or inside the metal from two of the integral equations.@xcite in addition , from the latter integral equations , the corresponding expressions for the magnetic ( electric ) field amplitudes for @xmath0 ( @xmath1 ) polarization can be simply obtained by making use of maxwell equations ( cf . ref . in the case of @xmath1 polarization ) .",
    "these expressions can be useful in near electric or magnetic field calculations .",
    "however , they exhibit non - integrable singularities when approaching the surface profile .    in this regard ,",
    "the calculation of the surface magnetic field intensity for @xmath0 polarization has been done in a simple manner by exploiting the connection between its normal and tangential components on the vacuum side    @xmath14    [ eq_smf_s ]    with the surface electric field and its normal derivative from the vacuum side ,    @xmath15    [ eq_sef_s ]    with @xmath16 ^ 2]^{1/2}$ ] .",
    "the corresponding expressions for the surface electric field components for @xmath1 polarization are given by:@xcite    @xmath17    [ eq_sef_p ]    where    @xmath18    [ eq_smf_p ]    as mentioned above , @xmath19 constitute the source functions of the integral equations in this scattering configuration .",
    "as a model describing many naturally occurring surface growth phenomena exhibiting self - affine fractality , we have chosen that given by the trace of a fractional brownian motion through voss algorithm,@xcite in addition , this model yields self - affine fractal structures that resemble fairly well the properties of some sers metal substrates.@xcite the ensembles of realizations thus generated are characterized by their fractal dimension @xmath20 ( @xmath21 being the hurst exponent ) and rms height @xmath22 .",
    "( in order to avoid the inherent ambiguity in the definition of the rms height for self - affine fractals , @xmath22 refers in our calculations to the rms height defined over the entire fractal profile with length @xmath23 m . recall that @xmath22 depends on the length @xmath24 over which it is measured through@xcite @xmath25 , @xmath26 being the topothesy .",

    "this choice is justified for we expect the influence of decreasing @xmath32 to be more significant for larger fractal dimensions . and recall that the effect of varying @xmath34 has been already studied on the far field @xcite and the near field @xcite , albeit for a relatively large lower cutoff @xmath32 .",
    "the values of the lower scale cutoffs hitherto considered are @xmath35 and 6.425 nm , resulting from sequences of @xmath36 and 819 points extracted from profiles with @xmath37 and 8192 points .",
    "the length of all realizations is thus @xmath38 m .",
    "actually , the final number of sampling points per realization used in the numerical calculations is significantly higher for the sake of accuracy : @xmath39 as obtained by introducing @xmath404 - 10 cubic - splined interpolating points , the latter being chosen on the basis of numerical convergence tests .",

    "[ fig_ff ] the angular distributions of the speckle pattern intensities scattered from self - affine ag surface profiles with identical properties ( @xmath33 , @xmath41 m , and @xmath22 ) except for @xmath35 and 6.425 nm , as mentioned in the preceding section .",
    "both @xmath0- and @xmath1-polarized incident ( @xmath42 ) gaussian beams are considered with wavelength @xmath43 nm and @xmath44 , the dielectric constant of ag at this frequency being@xcite @xmath45 .",

    "no significant differences are found ( note the semi - log scale in order to enhance them ) for @xmath0 polarization , nor even away from the bright specular peak . in the case of @xmath1 polarization , a weak decrease in the specular peak with decreasing @xmath32",
    "is barely observed , whereas small differences appear in the speckle pattern away from the specular peak .",
    "we now consider rougher surfaces with @xmath48 nm and topothesy @xmath49 nm ( see figs .  [ fig_ff]c and  [ fig_ff]d ) .",
    "appreciable changes are observed in the @xmath0-polarized speckle with decreasing @xmath32 , although the patterns are qualitatively similar .",
    "however , in the case of @xmath1-polarized speckle patterns , differences are both quantitative and qualitatively notorious . note the absence of specular peaks in both polarizations .",

    "[ fig_aff]b , exhibits a larger decrement ( from @xmath51 down to @xmath52 ) with diminishing @xmath32 .",
    "interestingly , despite the specular components are not included in figs .",
    "[ fig_aff]a and  [ fig_aff]b , the resulting angular distributions of diffusely scattered intensities present pronounced peaks at the specular directions .",

    "[ fig_aff]a and  [ fig_aff]b demonstrate that such peaks are not substantially affected by the fractal scales below a hundred nanometers .",
    "ensemble averaging of the speckle pattern scattered from very rough ( @xmath48 nm ) self - affine fractal surfaces also tends to wash out differences arising from nanoscale fractal details ( see figs .",
    "[ fig_aff]c and  [ fig_aff]d ) .",
    "in fact , no differences are found in the angular distribution of @xmath0-polarized , mean scattered intensities ( leaving aside some spurious speckle noise due to the limited number of realizations employed ) , even though quantitative changes have been found above in the speckle patterns for single realizations ( see fig .",
    "[ fig_ff]c ) .",
    "furthermore , the remarkable qualitative and quantitative changes in the @xmath1-polarized speckle spots seen in fig .  [ fig_ff]d reduce to significant , though only quantitative , variations upon ensemble averaging as shown in fig .",

    "only the central part of the illuminated surface is shown .    before analyzing the spatial distributions ,",
    "let us recall what is expected within the ka , namely , the sum of the incident and the specularly ( locally ) reflected fields .",
    "since the angular variation of the fresnel coefficients for metals at this frequency is small , the local variations of the specular field can be neglected .",
    "therefore , the ka field intensities are approximately given by those for a planar surface , namely :    @xmath56    [ eq_feka_s ]    for @xmath0 polarization ; and    @xmath57    [ eq_feka_p ]    for @xmath1 polarization , @xmath58 and @xmath59 being the corresponding fresnel coefficients for @xmath6 on a planar metal surface .",
    "the latter field intensities are plotted in figs .",
    "[ fig_sf_1_s ] and  [ fig_sf_1_p ] .",
    "as expected , the ka does not hold even for the moderately rough surface profiles used therein , nor does perturbation theory ( recall that the planar surface field intensities can be considered the zeroth order approximation in the small - amplitude perturbation expansion of the field ) , but they provide the background about which the actual surface em field intensities strongly vary .    in the case of @xmath0 polarization , fig .",
    "[ fig_sf_1_s ] , significant variations appear in the surface em field upon decreasing the lower scale cutoff .",
    "no appreciable differences have been found in the corresponding far field speckle patterns in fig .",
    "[ fig_ff]a and  [ fig_ff]b , so that the surface field nanoscale fluctuations are mostly due to the evanescent components . fluctuations about the background distributions , eqs .",
    "( [ eq_feka_s ] ) , become narrower and steeper the smaller is @xmath32 , namely , the smaller are the surface features .",
    "this effect is more pronounced for the normal magnetic field , for which the expected ka background is indeed very small .",
    "interestingly , it should be noted that the electric field intensity resembles with positive contrast the surface profile ( the same is true for the total , tangential plus normal , magnetic field intensity ) , which is not the case in general.@xcite although not valid from a quantitative standpoint , small amplitude perturbation theory can provide a qualitative explanation .",
    "the first - order term of the surface electric field in powers of the surface height , which in turn gives the first - order correction to the planar surface background,@xcite can be cast for this particular scattering geometry , polarization and near normal incidence in the form of a convolution integral involving the surface profile function .",
    "we have verified , though not shown here , that by simply increasing the angle of incidence up to @xmath60 the resemblance is slightly lost .    upon illuminating with @xmath1-polarized light ,",
    "see fig .",
    "[ fig_sf_1_p ] , the surface em field intensity distributions become more complicated , with larger variations from one realization to another with diminishing @xmath32 , and no resemblance whatsoever with the surface profiles .",
    "these variations are considerably larger than those for the far - field speckle patterns , indicating the crucial role played by the evanescent components .",
    "furthermore , the excitation of spp propagating along the surface and reradiating into vacuum mediates the scattering process .",
    "in fact , the spatial frequency of the large oscillations about the background in the surface em field intensity is related to the spp wavelength;@xcite this is more easily observed in the surface magnetic field in fig .",
    "[ fig_sf_1_p]a ( also in the total electric field , not shown here ) for the profiles with higher @xmath32 . on the other hand ,",
    "the surface normal electric field component for the smaller @xmath32 ( see fig .  [ fig_sf_1_p]b ) reveals the appearance of narrow and bright spots where an enhancement of the field intensity of nearly two orders of magnitude occur , despite the relatively low value of @xmath22 .",
    "this clearly manifests the crucial role played by the lower scale cutoff in the excitation of localized optical modes.@xcite    what if the surface roughness parameter is increased ? in figs .",

    "lower-@xmath32 surfaces lead to surface em field intensities with higher spatial frequency components , but the smoothly varying envelopes correspondig to smaller spatial frequencies are largely preserved .",
    "the former are mostly evanescent components that contribute little to the far - field intensities , which are basically originated in the propagating components , and thus quite similar for all surface profiles ( see fig .",
    "[ fig_ff]c ) .",
    "it should be remarked that no localized optical excitations seem to appear , as expected since no spp can be excited , nor significant em field enhancements are found . note that , thanks to the semi - logarithmic scale used in figs .",
    "[ fig_sf_5_s ] for the surface field intensities , a weak qualitative resemblance of positive contrast with the surface profiles can be seen .",
    "the @xmath1-polarized surface em field intensities presented in fig .  [ fig_sf_5_p ]",
    "reveal very strong changes in all field components with lower @xmath32 .",
    "these changes are considerably stronger than those for the smoother surfaces ( see fig .",
    "[ fig_sf_1_p ] ) .",
    "as mentioned above , narrow , large peaks tend to concentrate at bright spots in the form of _ localized optical modes _ , exhibiting very large electric field enhancements preferentially polarized along the normal to the surface , in agreement with the spp polarization , although significantly large enhancements of the tangential electric field intensity are also found . in addition , large magnetic field intensities abound , not necessarily at the same electric field bright spots .",
    "the polarization of the modes has been discussed in ref . for rougher self - affine fractals with large , but yet subwavelength , @xmath32 . it should be emphasized that the nanoscale lower cutoff largely contributes to the building and strengthening of such optical excitations .",
    "let us plot the em field in the near vicinity of the rough interface .",
    "this is done in figs .",
    "[ fig_nf_s ] and  [ fig_nf_p ] , where the near - field intensity maps in a logarithmic scale for @xmath0 and @xmath1 polarization , respectively , are shown in a region around the origin of the surface profile with @xmath61 nm in figs .",
    "[ fig_sf_5_s]d and  [ fig_sf_5_p]d .",
    "all the em field components are included for the sake of completeness ; recall that it has been recently reported that the magnetic field intensity can be also probed through pstm for certain experimental configurations.@xcite the actual surface profile , though not explicitly depicted , can be inferred from the fairly black , metal regions due to the evanescent behavior of the em fields inside metal with a small skin depth ( @xmath62 nm ) .",
    "note that no bright spot whatsoever is observed in the em field intensity maps in the case of @xmath0 polarization , fig .",
    "[ fig_nf_s ] , which exhibits no relevant features in the near field .",
    "the actual interface appears slightly blurred , since the minima have been reduced to enhance contrast .",
    "incidentally , the continuity of the ( tangential ) electric field is satisfied in fig .",
    "[ fig_nf_s]a , as well as the ( dis)continuity of the ( normal ) tangential magnetic field in figs .",
    "[ fig_nf_s]c and [ fig_nf_s]d .",
    "on the other hand , a very bright spot is found at the local maximum in the central part of the intensity map in fig .",
    "[ fig_nf_p]a : the intensity field enhancement at such spot is @xmath63 ( recall that the maximum scale of em field intensities in fig .",
    "[ fig_nf_s ] is about 3 orders of magnitude lower than those in fig .",

    "note that there seems to be a bright , though weaker , magnetic spot associated with the optical mode ( see fig .  [",
    "fig_nf_p]b ) , which is nonetheless slightly shifted to the right of the electric field maximum , on the surface local minimum nearby .",
    "the electric field intensity decays rapidly upon moving into vacuum away from the bright spot , faster than expected for the evanescent decay of spp propagating on a plane .",
    "this may help to explain why localized optical modes experimentally observed through pstm yield considerably smaller enhancement factors,@xcite leaving aside the fact that no direct comparison with theoretical calculations for the actual experimental surface profile are available .",
    "with regard to the electric field orientation on the bright spot , figs .",
