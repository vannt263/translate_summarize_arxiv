    "in quantum mechanics , observable quantities are represented by linear operators .",
    "the eigenvalues of an operator represent the possible values of the measurement of the corresponding observable .",
    "these eigenvalues , which mathematically correspond to the spectrum of the operator , can be discrete ( as the energies of a particle in a box ) , continuous ( as the energies of a free , unconstrained particle ) , resonant ( as in @xmath0 decay ) , or a combination thereof .",
    "the hilbert space includes only the bound and scattering spectra , because the hilbert space spectrum of an observable is real , thereby discarding the resonance spectrum as unphysical . however , radioactive nuclei and unstable elementary particles are physical objects that ought to have a place in the quantum mechanical formalism .",
    "this is why we need to extend the hilbert space to a rigged hilbert space , within which the resonance spectrum has a place .",
    "the purpose of this series of lectures is to explain how one should use the rigged hilbert space in quantum mechanics and , in particular , how to incorporate the resonance spectrum into the quantum mechanical formalism by using the rigged hilbert space .",
    "when the spectrum of an observable @xmath1 is discrete and @xmath1 is bounded , then @xmath1 is defined on the whole of the hilbert space @xmath2 and the eigenvectors of @xmath1 belong to @xmath2 . in this case",
    ", @xmath1 can be essentially seen as a matrix .",
    "this means that , as far as discrete spectrum is concerned , there is no need to extend @xmath2 .",
    "however , quantum mechanical observables are in general unbounded and their spectrum has in general a continuous part . in order",
    "to deal with continuous spectrum , we use dirac s bra - ket formalism .",
    "this formalism does not fit within the hilbert space alone , but within the rigged hilbert space .    loosely speaking , a rigged hilbert space ( also called a gelfand triplet )",
    "is a triad of spaces @xmath3 such that @xmath2 is a hilbert space , @xmath4 is a dense subspace of @xmath2 , and @xmath5 is the space of antilinear functionals over @xmath4 .",
    "mathematically , @xmath4 is the space of test functions , and @xmath5 is the space of distributions .",
    "the space @xmath5 is called the antidual space of @xmath4 .",
    "associated with the rigged hilbert space  ( [ rhstintro ] ) , there is always another rigged hilbert space , @xmath6 where @xmath7 is called the dual space of @xmath8 and contains the linear functionals over @xmath4 .    the basic reason why we need the spaces @xmath7 and",
    "@xmath9 is that the bras and kets associated with the elements in the continuous spectrum of an observable belong , respectively , to @xmath7 and @xmath9 rather than to @xmath10 .",
    "the basic reason reason why we need the space @xmath4 is that unbounded operators are not defined on the whole of @xmath10 but only on dense subdomains of @xmath10 that are not invariant under the action of the observables .",
    "such non - invariance makes expectation values , uncertainties and commutation relations not well defined on the whole of @xmath2 .",
    "the space @xmath4 is the largest subspace of the hilbert space on which such expectation values , uncertainties and commutation relations are well defined .    besides accommodating resonances and dirac s bra - ket formalism , the rigged hilbert space seems to capture the physical principles of quantum mechanics better than the hilbert space .",
    "for example , assuming that the hilbert space provides the whole mathematical framework for quantum mechanics leads to the conclusion that heisenberg s uncertainty relations are not physical , since they can not be defined on the whole of the hilbert space  @xcite . using the rigged hilbert space ,",
    "one overcomes this difficulty after realizing that the commutation relations are well defined on @xmath4 .",
    "the completeness relation is a good place to appreciate the added value of the rigged hilbert space .",
    "consider , for example , the hamiltonian @xmath11 of a system . in the hilbert space ,",
    "one writes the completeness relation as @xmath12 where @xmath13 are the spectral projections of @xmath11 and @xmath14 is its spectrum .",
    "however , within the rigged hilbert space one can write ) , by means of direct integral decompositions . ]",
    "@xmath15 where @xmath16 and @xmath17 are the bound and scattering states of @xmath11 , respectively .",
    "in addition to  ( [ crhs ] ) , the rigged hilbert space gives you an additional completeness relation in which the resonance states participate : @xmath18 where @xmath19 are the gamow ( resonance ) states of @xmath11 and the last integral , called the background , is performed in the complex plane right below the negative real axis of the second sheet . ) must be either regulated or understood in a time - dependent way . ]",
    "thus , the completeness relation   substitutes the scattering states contribution by the resonance contribution plus a background , thereby putting the resonance spectrum on the same footing as the bound and scattering spectra .",
    "it is important to note that the integrals in ( [ crhs ] ) and ( [ crrhs ] ) are different , and that the resonance contribution does not appear in  ( [ crhs ] ) , because resonances are not asymptotic states . also important",
    "is to note that the resonance states , and therefore expansion  ( [ crrhs ] ) , need a different rigged hilbert space from that needed by the scattering states and expansion  ( [ crhs ] ) .",
    "there are dangers in using the rigged hilbert space indiscriminately , though .",
    "for instance , a.  bohm and collaborators have been using a rigged hilbert space ( of hardy class ) to construct a quantum theory of resonances , see review  @xcite and references therein .",
    "however , such theory is inconsistent with quantum mechanics and must be discarded  @xcite .    the structure of these lectures is as follows .",
    "after an introductory lecture  1 , i will explain in lecture  2 how to construct the rigged hilbert space of the one - dimensional rectangular barrier potential .",
    "this will show that the rigged hilbert space is already needed to provide the mathematical support of the most basic quantum systems .",
    "in lecture  3 , i will construct the rigged hilbert space of the lippmann - schwinger equation , which equation governs quantum scattering . in lecture  4 , i will construct the rigged hilbert space of the analytic continuation of the lippmann - schwinger equation .",
    "the rigged hilbert space of lecture  4 will be needed in the final lecture  5 to provide the mathematical support for the resonance states .",
    "the pdf file of each talk will be posted at http://www.ucsd.edu/~rafa .",

    "if resonances are not included , the way to construct the rigged hilbert space of a quantum system is as follows :    1 .",
    "we identify the observables of the system .",
    "their expressions are usually given by linear , differential operators .",
    "we identify the hilbert space , whose scalar product is used to calculate probability amplitudes .",
    "3 .   we identify the domains , spectra and eigenfunctions of the observables .",
    "if the observables have a discrete spectrum , we need not go beyond the hilbert space .",
    "however , if at least one of the observables has continuous spectrum , we need to enlarge the hilbert space to the rigged hilbert space .",
    "( if position and momentum are among the observables , we will always need the rigged hilbert space . )",
    "we construct the space @xmath4 in which physical quantities such as expectation values , uncertainties and commutation relations are well defined . when resonances are not included , the space @xmath4 is usually given by the maximal invariant subspace of the algebra of observables .",
    "we construct the dual @xmath20 and antidual @xmath5 spaces .",
    "we construct the bras and kets of the observables and check that they respectively belong to @xmath20 and @xmath5 .",
    "the completeness relations and all the features of dirac s bra - ket formalism now follow .",
    "let s see how the above steps are carried out in the case of a spinless particle moving in one dimension and impinging on a rectangular barrier .",
    "the observables relevant to this system are the position @xmath21 , the momentum @xmath22 , and the hamiltonian @xmath11 : @xmath23 @xmath24 @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the 1d rectangular barrier potential .",
    "these observables satisfy the following commutation relations : @xmath27 = i \\hbar i \\ , , \\label{cr1}\\ ] ] @xmath28 = - \\frac{i \\hbar}{m } p \\ , , \\ ] ] @xmath29 = i \\hbar \\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial x } \\ , .",

    "( [ ddomain ] ) , we deduce that the elements of @xmath4 satisfy the following estimates : @xmath56 these estimates mean that the action of any combination of any power of the observables remains square integrable .",
    "for this to happen , the functions @xmath57 must be infinitely differentiable and must fall off at infinity faster than any polynomial .",
    "hence , @xmath4 is a schwartz - like space .    because @xmath4 is invariant under the action of the observables , @xmath58 the expectation values @xmath59 are finite , and",
