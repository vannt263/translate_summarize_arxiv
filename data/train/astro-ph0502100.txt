    "the most readily observed signature of accretion in a young brown dwarf is a broad h@xmath10 emission line profile , which has been observed through high - resolution spectroscopy in gm tau , ic  348 - 382 , and ic  348 - 415 at a spectral type of m6.5 @xcite and in ic348 - 355 and 2mass  1207 - 3932 at m8 @xcite .",
    "very large equivalent widths of h@xmath10 in low - resolution spectra also have been suggestive of accretion in kpno - tau  12 and s  ori  55 at m9 @xcite and in s  ori  71 at l0 @xcite .",

    "the _ infrared space observatory ( iso ) _ detected excesses for cfht  4 at m7 @xcite , cha  h@xmath10  1 at m7.75 @xcite , and gy141 at m8.5 @xcite .",

    ", we describe these observations , construct a spectral energy distribution ( sed ) for ots  44 , measure its mid - ir excess emission , and compare this excess to our model predictions for emission from a circumstellar disk .",
    "as a part of the guaranteed time observations of the irac instrument team , we obtained images at 3.6 , 4.5 , 5.8 , and 8.0  with irac on the _ spitzer space telescope _ of the northern cluster in the chamaeleon  i star - forming region on 2004 july 4 ( ut ) .",
    "the plate scale and field of view of irac are @xmath13 and @xmath14 , respectively .",
    "the camera produces images with fwhm@xmath15-@xmath16 from 3.6 to 8.0  @xcite .",
    "the cluster was mapped with a @xmath17 mosaic of pointings separated by @xmath18 and aligned with the array axes .",
    "at each cell in the map , images were obtained in the 12  s high dynamic range mode , which provided one 0.4  s exposure and one 10.4  s exposure .",
    "the map was performed twice with offsets of several arcseconds between the two iterations .",
    "the resulting maps had centers of @xmath19 , @xmath20 ( j2000 ) for 3.6 and 5.8  and at @xmath21 , @xmath22 ( j2000 ) for 4.5 and 8.0  , dimensions of @xmath23 , and position angles of @xmath24 for the long axes .",
    "the images from the spitzer science center pipeline ( version s10.5.0 ) were combined into one mosaic at each of the four bands using custom idl software developed by robert gutermuth .",
    "aperture photometry for ots  44 was extracted with the task phot under the iraf package apphot using a radius of two pixels ( @xmath25 ) for the aperture and inner and outer radii of two and six pixels for the sky annulus . in the next section",

    "therefore , we also measured kpno - tau  4 from images obtained by @xcite with the same aperture sizes applied to ots  44 . because the 8.0  images of kpno - tau  4 were contaminated by residual images from a prior observation of a bright star , the photometry in this band is uncertain and therefore is not considered in this work . for an aperture radius of 10 pixels and",
    "a sky annulus extending from 10 to 20 pixels , we adopted zero point magnitudes ( @xmath26 ) of 19.601 , 18.942 , 16.882 , 17.395 in the 3.6 , 4.5 , 5.8 and 8 @xmath27 m bands , where @xmath28 .",
    "we then applied aperture corrections of 0.210 , 0.228 , 0.349 , and 0.499  mag to the photometry of ots  44 and kpno - tau  4 .",
    "the resulting irac photometry for ots  44 and kpno - tau  4 are listed in table  [ tab : data ] .",
    "the photometric uncertainties for both objects are 0.02  mag at 3.6 and 4.5  and 0.04  mag at 5.8 and 8.0  , with an additional 10% uncertainty in the irac calibration .",
    "table  [ tab : data ] includes optical and near - ir photometry for ots  44 and kpno - tau  4 .",
    "the data at @xmath0 are from k. luhman ( in preparation ) and @xcite and the near - ir measurements are from @xcite and the 2mass point source catalog for ots  44 and kpno - tau  4 , respectively .",
    "before discussing ots  44 , we first examine the sed of the comparison source , kpno - tau  4 .",
    "figure  [ fig : sed ] shows the sed of kpno - tau  4 derived from the photometry in table  [ tab : data ] using a distance modulus of 5.76 for taurus @xcite and the appropriate zero - magnitude fluxes @xcite . no correction for extinction",
    "was applied to these data because of the negligible extinction toward this object @xcite .",
    "as shown in figure  [ fig : sed ] , the mid - ir sed of kpno - tau  4 is consistent with a blackbody at the effective temperature of the central object ( @xmath29  k ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and thus exhibits no evidence of excess emission from circumstellar material . therefore , in the following analysis , we adopt the sed of kpno - tau  4 to represent the intrinsic photosphere of young objects at the spectral type of ots  44 .",
    "we now examine the sed of ots  44 , which is shown in figure  [ fig : sed ] after an extinction correction of @xmath30 @xcite and adopting a distance modulus of 6.13 for chamaeleon  i @xcite . in comparison to kpno - tau  4 ,",
    "ots  44 exhibits excess flux in the irac bands that becomes stronger with longer wavelengths .",
    "we have compared this excess emission with the predictions of a model of an irradiated accretion disk . for these calculations",
    ", we adopted a stellar mass @xmath31  @xmath32 and radius @xmath33  @xmath34 @xcite , uniform grain size distribution everywhere given by the standard power law @xmath35 with minimum and maximum grain sizes @xmath36 m and @xmath37 m @xcite , uniform mass accretion rate , and an inner radius @xmath38  @xmath39 ( given by the silicate sublimation radius ) . the disk was heated by local viscous dissipation and stellar irradiation .",
    "the emission from a wall at the dust destruction radius was included .",
    "detailed descriptions of the method used to calculate the disk structure and emergent intensity are given by @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "as shown in figure  [ fig : sed ] , we were able to fit the observed sed with a disk model seen pole - on ( @xmath40 ) with an accretion rate of @xmath41 and an inner radius of 3  @xmath39 .",
    "we were driven to low inclinations because we found that any significant contribution from the inner wall , which radiates approximately as a blackbody at 1400 k , resulted in an sed that was inconsistent with the irac observations .",
    "our estimate of the accretion rate is higher than values derived for other young brown dwarfs from modeling of h@xmath10 emission profiles @xcite . within the context of our model and the adopted inclination , we required substantial viscous dissipation due to accretion as well as irradiation from the central star to achieve high enough temperatures at the inner edge of the disk .",
    "our model assumes that the inner disk wall is perfectly vertical ( perpendicular to the disk plane ) .",
    "if the disk wall is actually somewhat tilted or curved , as was adopted to model the older t tauri star tw hya @xcite , also seen pole - on , it is possible that the intermediate range of temperatures at the inner disk edge resulting from such structure would enable us to fit the observations with lower @xmath42 .",
    "further exploration of this issue is needed .",
    "the accretion luminosity for the adopted values of the stellar mass and radius and the disk mass accretion rate is 0.0002  @xmath43 , which corresponds to 15% of the stellar luminosity ,",
    "@xmath44  @xmath43 @xcite .",
    "if matter from the disk is loaded onto the star through a magnetospheric flow , as the observed line profiles in higher mass brown dwarfs and very low mass stars seem to indicate @xcite , then an accretion shock should form at the stellar surface , where most of the accretion luminosity would be emitted @xcite .",
    "this emission would veil the photospheric lines . to estimate the expected degree of veiling ,",
    "we have calculated the emission from accretion shocks on the stellar surface following the procedures of @xcite .",
    "figure  [ fig : sed ] shows the shock emission from two models of accretion columns with values of the energy flux in the column @xmath45 and @xmath46 , which are representative of those estimated for higher mass t tauri stars @xcite and correspond to filling factors on the stellar surface of 0.0016 and 0.00016 , respectively .",
    "as shown in figure  [ fig : sed ] , veiling from the shock is predicted to be significant at optical wavelengths but negligible longward of 1  .",
    "optical spectroscopy can test the model prediction of a high accretion rate ; as discussed above , modifying the structure of the inner disk edge could result in acceptable fits with lower accretion rates and thus lower accretion shock luminosities .",
    "the irac data do not constrain the maximum grain size . disk models with different grain maximum sizes have the same sed for @xmath47 m because the fluxes arise from the optically thick and flat inner disk regions .",
    "thus , observations at longer wavelengths are necessary for constraining the dust properties in the ots 44 disk .",
    "similarly , it is not possible to constrain the disk mass with the available data ; models with a different viscosity parameter @xmath10 and disk radius ( which implies different disk masses for a given mass accretion rate ) have the same sed in the observed spectral range .",
    "through observations with irac aboard the _ spitzer space telescope _ , we have shown that the least massive known member of chamaeleon  i , ots  44 , exhibits strong mid - ir excess emission , which we have reproduced with a model of an accretion disk . with a spectral type of m9.5 and a mass of @xmath6  @xmath7 , ots",
    "44 is now the coolest and least massive brown dwarf observed to have a circumstellar disk .",
    "the presence of a disk around ots  44 demonstrates that the formation of free - floating bodies via disks extends down to the deuterium burning mass limit ( @xmath48  @xmath7 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and raises the possibility of planet formation around objects that themselves have planetary masses . indeed , a candidate planetary companion has already been discovered near the earlier and more massive young brown dwarf 2mass  1207 - 3932 ( m8 , @xmath49  @xmath7 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) by @xcite .",
    "the relative ease of the detection of the excess emission from ots  44 ( @xmath50  s ) demonstrates the feasibility of searching for disks around young brown dwarfs at even lower masses with irac ( @xmath51  @xmath7 ) . in addition , photometry at longer wavelengths with the multiband imaging photometer for spitzer and spectroscopy with the infrared spectrograph on _ spitzer _ of ots  44 and brown dwarfs like it should provide detailed constraints on the physical properties of disks around low - mass brown dwarfs , such as their mineralogy and geometry ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) .",
