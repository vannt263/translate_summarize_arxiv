    "solar radiation is far from constant .",
    "these changes can be seen in many solar activity indicators , such as sunspot number , sunspot area , total solar irradiance , solar flares , the recurrence index of geomagnetic disturbances @xcite , dynamo models @xcite , and solar cycle length @xcite .",
    "however , sunspot number is the most common solar activity indicator , having been recorded since 1700 , and used as an indicator for solar cycle prediction since 1913 @xcite .",
    "any change in solar activity presents challenges in solar physics ( understanding solar cycle mechanisms , prediction of solar events such as flares , cme , etc ) or in the field of space weather ( satellite drag , telecommunication outages , etc ) .",
    "therefore solar cycle prediction is of vital importance now , and will be even more important in the future . despite general knowledge of solar cycles , reliable forecasting of",
    "sunspot number remains problematic .",
    "several statistical methods have already been applied , but due to the nonlinear nature of the time series , linear approaches are expected to fail .",
    "other techniques have been employed ( e.g. precursors , @xcite ) that offer theoretical advantages . because of the wide variety of techniques used , the present solar cycle ( cycle 24 ) has been predicted to have a maximum sunspot number as low as 50 or as high as 180 @xcite . in this study , we predict the length and intensity of cycle 24 using two statistical / dynamical methods : the hurst exponent and the sugihara - may algorithm .",
    "the monthly issn ( international sunspot number ) data were used from 1847 to 2007 . though data is available back to 1700 , according to @xcite `` the quality of the data is considered as poor during 1700 - 1748 , questionable during 1749 - 1817 , good during 1818 - 1847 , and reliable since 1848 . ''",
    "the maximum of intensity of each cycle and the time from the beginning of the cycle to its maximum ( hereafter `` ascension time '' ) was derived for cycles 1 ( february 1755 ) to 23 ( march 2000 ) .",
    "all the datasets used in this study were taken from national geophysical data center ( ngdc ) . because standard methods are expected to fail to make accurate predictions , we apply two unusual techniques to this data to make our predictions .",
    "\\(1 ) the hurst exponent or rescaled range analysis .",
    "this method was proposed by @xcite for an experimental study of long term information storage in time series data .",
    "this technique has had wide application in many research fields , including finance @xcite , astronomy @xcite , climate @xcite , and others .",
    "hurst analysis is a simple and robust way to analyze randomness in a dataset .",
    "the parameter @xmath0 measures the persistence of structures in the time series , indicating whether the data represent a pure random walk or have underlying trends .",
    "another way to state this is that a random process with an underlying trend has some degree of autocorrelation . when the autocorrelation has a very long ( or mathematically infinite ) , decay the process is referred to as a long memory process .",
    "the value of @xmath0 varies from 0 ( indicating anti - persistent brown noise ) to 0.5 ( random white noise ) , 1.0 ( indicating a strong , smooth trend ) .",
    "hurst found that the rescaled range series @xmath1 over a time window of width @xmath2 is described as a power law : @xmath3 where @xmath4 is a constant and @xmath0 is the hurst exponent . to estimate the value of the hurst exponent ,",
    "@xmath5 is plotted versus @xmath2 on log - log axes .",
    "the slope of the linear regression gives the value of the hurst exponent .",
    "more details about @xmath5 analysis , see @xcite .",
    "\\(2 ) the sugihara - may algorithm . this algorithm compares a library of ( known ) past patterns to patterns seen later in the real time series .",
    "it does this by reconstructing an attractor from the library , locating the `` present '' point on the attractor , and tracing that point forward along the attractor s trajectory .",
    "the dimension of the attractor is determined by the complexity of the process that generates it , and the number of points involved in tracing forward determines the nonlinearity of the system .",
    "a similar chaos technique was firstly applied to the historical sunspot data by @xcite to determine the nonlinearity of the data set and to predict the following solar cycle . for a chaotic time",
    "series , the accuracy of nonlinear forecast falls off as prediction time increases @xcite .",
    "this is a two step procedure .",
    "first , simplex projection identifies the best embedding dimension , which is then used in a s - map procedure to check the nonlinearity @xcite .",
    "a time series @xmath6 of length @xmath7 , is embedded in @xmath8-dimensional euclidean space to create a `` landscape '' @xmath9 of @xmath10 vectors , where _ @xmath11 : ( @xmath12)_. the first @xmath13 of these _ @xmath11 _ vectors are associated with output values _",
    "@xmath14_. then forecasts of the @xmath15 remaining input vectors , i.e. predictions , are made by    @xmath16    @xmath17    where the summation is taken over the @xmath18 closest neighbors in @xmath8-dimensional euclidean space .",
    "ideally , these closest neighbors form the vertices of the smallest simplex containing the predictee . in this context , this predictive approach is a local approximation similar to kernel density estimation . to find an appropriate value of d",
    ", various values of d are applied to find the value that minimizes prediction error ( i.e. , an embedding that minimizes the singularities or indeterminate crossing points of trajectories in the putative attractor ) .",
    "the optimal @xmath8 is then used in an s - map to build weighted ( local ) linear predictions .",
    "the rate of decay of weight given to each point is set by @xmath19 parameter , and it describes the degree of caoticity of a data set .",
    "the forecast improvement with local weighting indicates that the underlying dynamics are nonlinear .",
    "hence @xmath19 = 0 performs best for linear time series ( i.e. , @xmath19 = 0 is the global linear solution ) , and when @xmath19 @xmath200 performs best , the time series is nonlinear @xcite .",
    "we investigate the significance of the historical relationship between maximum sunspot number and ascension time with pearson s test .",
    "hurst exponent analysis was applied to the monthly issn data separated in two time intervals : 1700 to 2007 and 1848 to 2007 .",
    "@xmath0= 0.86@xmath210.008 , and @xmath0=0.88@xmath210.009 for these datasets respectively ( fig .",
    "the bulge between 6 and 8 in panels ( a ) and ( b ) of figure 1 is due to the main contribution of the 11-year cycle @xcite .    to investigate the complexity , nonlinearity and predictability of the data , the sugihara - may algorithm was applied as described above . from this analysis",
    ", it was discovered that the data are high - dimensional , i.e. governed by many orthogonal processes such as solar rotation and inner magnetic activity ( fig .",
    "2 ) .    in the second step of this procedure , the s - map analysis ( fig .",
    "3 ) , a weak nonlinear signature was detected in 8 dimensions , indicating weak chaotic behavior .",
    "we also tested the prediction capability of our method by predicting the second half of the given data set ( 1927 - 2008 ) using only data from 1848 - 1926 .",
    "the model produced very skillful predictions , showing a correlation of 0.94 with the observed values ( fig .",
    "4 ) . we therefore attempted to perform long - range forecasts by sequentially increasing tp ( the time length into the future that one tries to predict from the last data point ) .",
    "these results are mostly an echo of the previous cycle .",
    "this technique predicts that the current solar cycle will reach a maximum on december 2012 , peaking at a sunspot number of 87.4 ( fig .",
    "a similar method to our prediction analysis was used by @xcite for the solar cycle 22 .",
    "they found that the maximum sunspot number would be about 150 . because the observed maximum of that cycle was 158 , a rather good prediction estimate",
    ", it instills more confidence in the technique .    for historical cycles",
    ", we further investigated the link between the maximum sunspot number and the ascension time .",
    "we found that the two variables have a strong negative correlation ( r=0.82 , df=21 , and p@xmath22.001 ; fig .",
    "our prediction above ( 87.4 sunspots in 5.1 years from december 2007 ) is plausible given the historical relationship between the two values , as cycles with an ascending phase between 4.5 and 5.5 years have a maximum in the 64.2 to 131.6 sunspot range .",
    "our results show that the hurst exponents of the issn data for the periods of time 1700 - 2007 and 1848 - 2007 are 0.86@xmath210.008 and 0.88@xmath210.009 respectively .",
    "this is in agreement with @xcite who first applied this type of analysis to the monthly sunspot number , and found @xmath0 = 0.86 .",
    "similarly @xcite analyzed the @xmath23 radiocarbon data as a proxy of solar activity , and found @xmath0= 0.84 . in analyzing daily doppler solar differential rotation",
    "coefficients a and b measured at mount wilson , usa , @xcite found @xmath0 to be 0.83 and 0.86 respectively .",
    "the slightly higher exponent obtained for the recent dataset indicates that more reliable sunspot data exhibits a slightly stronger autocorrelation ( or tendency to trend ) , and thereby has more statistical predictability than the full data set ( 1700 - 2007 ) .",
    "thus it is likely that errors or uncertainty within the unreliable data affected its inherent predictability .",
    "our prediction of ascension time compare with values already available in the literature , which range from december 2009 to 2014 @xcite .",
    "@xcite reported that the second half of 2010 or the first quarter of 2011 would be the most reliable extimates for the maximum of cycle 24 .",
    "@xcite suggested october 2011 or august of 2012 , while @xcite found that cycle maximum will occur as early as december 2009 .",
    "our prediction of cycle 24 s intensity also bears comparison with other forecasts . as early as 1983",
    ", @xcite claimed that cycle 23 and 24 would be low and cycle 24 would be lower than cycle 23 .",
    "@xcite predicted a maximum of 87.5@xmath2123.5 , and @xcite estimated a peak between 83.2 and 119.4 .",
    "@xcite reported that cycle 24 has to be low by analyzing the number of flares .",
    "@xcite obtained a value of 74 from the sunspot group data and @xcite obtained a value of 116 by using a harmonic oscillator solar cycle model .",
    "@xcite predicted that sunspot number would be 129.7@xmath2116.3 for the present cycle , but later ( 2008 ) revised this estimate to either 140@xmath2120 in october 2011 or 90@xmath2110 in august 2012 .",
    "it must be emphasized that the observational result for the start of cycle 24 ( april 2008 ) , is in rather good agreement with kane s prediction .",
    "thus , we can think that kane s estimates for the time at which cycle 24 will reach its maximum could be reliable . using neuronal prediction , @xcite predicted 145 sunspots at the peak in december 2009 .",
    "the precursor models , which use data from the declining phase of cycle @xmath24 to predict height and timing of cycle @xmath7 , were used by @xcite .",
    "they reported that `` the precursor models based on the polar field or @xmath25 data often yield lower values of the current cycle '' , which vary from 70@xmath2110 and 120@xmath2140 . from the dynamo model @xcite have reported that cycle 24 would be 35@xmath26 lower than cycle 23 .",
    "@xcite disagreed  using a flux transport dynamo model they argued that cycle 24 will be 30 - 50@xmath26 higher than cycle 23 .",
    "@xcite give a value of 160 based on geomagnetic activity at the minimum .",
    "from the index of the global magnetic field , @xcite forecast that cycle 24 would be of `` medium high , the same or somewhat higher than cycle 23 '' . finally , @xcite using a nonlinear dynamo model as described by @xcite which takes into account dynamics of the turbulent magnetic helicity , predict that the next sunspot cycle will be significantly weaker ( by @xmath27 ) than the previous cycle , continuing the trend of low solar activity .    by means of the two methods utilized here , the rescaled range analysis and the sugihara - may algorithm",
    ", we were able to deduce from the significant trends of the issn data , both the cycle duration and its maximum intensity .",
    "unlike previous analysis our forecasting results are based on models that were tested out of sample to have a high degree of forecast skill .",
    "our conclusions therefore are ( i ) the reliable monthly mean sunspot data during 1848 - 2007 @xcite yield a slightly higher hurst exponent than do all the historical observational data ; ( ii ) @xmath0 , being greater than 0.5 , shows that the sunspots series are highly persistent ( exhibit momentum or trending ) ; ( iii ) concerning cycle 24 , the maximum intensity of 87.4 will be reached in december 2012 ; ( iv ) according to this forecast , the current solar cycle will have a magnitude far lower than any other since 1890 - 1910 .",
