    "phases of superfluid @xmath0he provided the first example of unconventional superfluidity , which triggered the search for the identification of the unconventional superconductivity and superfluidity first in the systems with heavy fermions , then in high - temperature superconductors , and most recently in a layered superconductor sr@xmath2ruo@xmath3 and in a multi - component bose condensates .",
    "unconventional superfluidity of @xmath0he - a manifests itself in exotic types of the topological defects and in unusual behavior at low temperature caused by the gap nodes .",
    "@xmath0he - a is the first example of superfluids with the gap nodes in the energy spectrum for quasiparticles . though existence of nodes in @xmath0he - a was proven only recently in experiments with the ab interface where",
    "the @xmath4 behavior has been verified @xcite , these nodes influence the investigation of low-@xmath5 properties of unconventional superconductors .",
    "in particular , the observed low-@xmath5 and low-@xmath6 scaling for the specific heat in a mixed state of high-@xmath7 superconductors related to the gap nodes and vortices @xcite has its history started in 1981 , when it was found that gap nodes in @xmath0he - a lead to finite nonanalytic density of states at @xmath8 in the presence of the order parameter texture @xcite .",
    "the intermediate steps were the ref .",
    "@xcite , where the superfluid velocity field has been used instead of a texture , and ref .",
    "@xcite where this was extended for the superflow around the vortex in @xmath1-wave superconductor .",
    "another example of influence of @xmath0he - a is the observation in high-@xmath7 superconductors of the fractional flux attached to the tricrystal line , which is the junction of three grain boundaries@xcite .",
    "this was inspired by the discussion of the flux quantization with the half of conventional magnitude in a heavy fermionic superconductors @xcite , which in turn has been inspired by @xmath0he - a where the possibility of a vortex with half - integer circulation has been shown @xcite .",
    "the two examples above are the two sides of the same phenomenon : the nontrivial topology .",
    "the gap nodes in momentum space and vortices  the nodes in position space  are topological objects , which can be continuously transformed to each other by transformation in the extended momentum+position space , as also was first discussed in @xmath0he - a @xcite . the same topology is also in the basis of the standard model of electroweak and strong interactions in particle physics @xcite ( see review @xcite ) . as a result ,",
    "in the vicinity of the gap nodes the @xmath0he - a liquid as well as the high - temperature superconductors and other similar systems acquire some attributes of relativistic quantum field theory such as lorentz invariance , gauge invariance , chirality and chiral fermions , etc .",
    "the conceptual similarity between these condensed matter systems and the quantum vacuum makes them an ideal laboratory for simulating many effects in high energy physics and cosmology .",
    "now it is believed that the tetragonal layered superconductor sr@xmath2ruo@xmath3 has the order parameter of the same symmetry class as @xmath0he - a @xcite and thus shares many unusual properties of the latter .",
    "in particular , it is assumed that the superconducting state of sr@xmath2ruo@xmath3 is chiral , i.e. reflection and time reversal symmetries are spontaneously broken .",
    "there are other systems which share some of unusual properties of @xmath0he - a : the multicomponent atomic bose - condensates @xcite ; neutron superfluids ; quark matter with colour superconductivity ... it is worthwhile to consider where we are now : what is observed from these exotic properties and what is to be observed .",
    "according to the landau picture of superfluidity , the superfluid flow is potential : its velocity @xmath9 is curl - free : @xmath10 .",
    "later onsager @xcite and feynman @xcite found that this statement must be generalized : @xmath11 at singular lines , the quantized vortices , around which the phase of the order parameter winds by @xmath12 .",
    "discovery of superfluid @xmath0he - a made further weakening of the rule : the nonsingular vorticity can be produced by the regular texture of the order parameter @xcite .",
    "the order parameter  the wave function of cooper pair with spin @xmath13 and orbital momentum @xmath14  is determined by two vectors @xmath15 the real unit vector @xmath16 enters the spin part of the order parameter , where @xmath17 are the pauli matrices .",
    "the orbital part , which shows the momentum @xmath18 dependence , is described by the complex vector @xmath19 , whith mutually orthogonal real and imaginary parts .",
    "the order parameter is intrinsically complex , i.e. its phase can not be eliminated by a gauge transformation .",
    "this violates the time reversal symmetry and leads to the spontaneous angular momentum along the unit vector @xmath20 .",
    "the superfluid velocity of the chiral condensate is @xmath21 ( where @xmath22 is the mass of the cooper pair ) with continuous vorticity satisfying the mermin - ho relation : @xmath23 .",
    "quantization of vorticity is provided by topology of textures : the texture which is homogeneous at large distances @xcite has @xmath24 winding ( i.e. @xmath25 ) if the @xmath26 field covers all @xmath27 orientations in the soft core of continuous vortex . if the order parameter is a spinor ( the `` half of vector '' ) , as it occurs in spin-1/2 bose condensates @xcite and in the standard model of electroweak interactions , the continuous vortices and correspondingly continuous cosmic strings @xcite have twice less winding number , @xmath28 .",
    "the nmr measurements already in 1983 provided the indication for existence of the continuous @xmath24 lines in rotating @xmath0he - a ( see review @xcite ) .",
    "however , the first proof that the isolated continuous vortex contains @xmath25 circulation quanta has been obtained only recently @xcite .",
    "lines with continuous vorticity has been used for `` cosmological '' experiments .",
    "investigation of the dynamics of these vortices presented the first demonstration of the condensed matter analog of the axial anomaly in relativistic field theory , which is believed responsible for the present excess of matter over antimatter @xcite .",
    "another cosmological phenomenon is related to nucleation of these vortices investigated in @xcite .",
    "vortex formation marks the helical instability of the normal / superfluid counterflow in @xmath0he - a ( the counterflow is the flow of the normal component with respect to the superfluid one ) .",
    "the instability is described by the same equations and actually represents the same physics ( see review @xcite ) as the helical instability of the bath of right - handed electrons towards formation of the helical hypermagnetic field discussed in @xcite .",
    "this experiment thus supported the joyce - shaposhnikov scenario of formation of primordial cosmological magnetic field .",
    "another example of continuous vorticity observed in @xmath0he - a is the vortex sheet @xcite .",
    "this is the chain of the so called mermin - ho continuous vortices with @xmath28 trapped by the soliton .",
    "each vortex is the kink in the soliton structure .",
    "the kink can live only within the soliton , precisely as the bloch line within the bloch wall in magnets .",
    "in @xmath0he - a the fractional vorticity is still to be observed . the discrete symmetry , which supports the half - quantum vortex comes from the identification of points @xmath16 , @xmath29 and @xmath30 , @xmath31 . in a half - quantum vortex both",
    "vectors change sign after circling around the vortex while the order parameter in eq.([orderparameter ] ) returns to its initial value @xmath32 here @xmath33 is the azimuthal angle of the cylindrical coordinate system ; the magnetic field is applied along @xmath34 to keep the @xmath16-vector in @xmath35 plane .",
    "@xmath16 is quantization axis for spin .",
    "since it rotates by @xmath36 around the vortex , a `` person '' living in @xmath0he - a , who moves around the vortex , insensibly finds its spin reversed with respect to the fixed environment .",
    "this is an analog of alice string in particle physics @xcite .",
    "a particle which moves around an alice string continuously flips its charge or parity or enters the `` shadow '' world @xcite .    in superconductors",
    "the crystalline structure must be taken into account .",
    "in simplest representation , which preserves the tetragonal symmetry , the order parameter in sr@xmath2ruo@xmath3 : @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the phase of the order parameter ; @xmath39 and @xmath40 are the elementary vectors of the crystal lattice within the layer .    vortices with fractional @xmath41 can be obtained in two ways .",
    "if @xmath42-field is flexible enough , there is analog of @xmath43 vortex in eq.([halfquantumvortex ] ) , in which @xmath44 and @xmath45 around the vortex @xcite .",
    "another is the mbius strip geometry produced by twisting the crystal axes @xmath39 and @xmath40 around the loop @xcite",
    ". the closed wire traps the fractional flux , if it is twisted by an angle @xmath46 before gluing the ends .",
    "since the local orientation of the crystal lattice continuously changes by @xmath46 around the loop , @xmath47 and @xmath48 , the order parameter is multiplied by @xmath49 after encircling the loop .",
    "the single - valuedness of the order parameter requires that this must be compensated by a change of its phase @xmath38 by @xmath46 . as a result the phase winding around the loop",
    "is @xmath46 , i.e. @xmath50 .",
    "this , however , does not mean that the loop of the chiral @xmath51-wave superconductor traps 1/4 of the magnetic flux @xmath52 of conventional abrikosov vortex .",
    "because of the breaking of time reversal symmetry in chiral crystalline superconductors , persistent electric current arises not only due to the phase coherence but also due to deformations of the crystal @xcite : @xmath53 magnetic flux trapped by the loop is obtained from the condition of no current in the wire , @xmath54 in eq.([superfluidcurrent ] ) .",
    "thus , the trapped flux depends on the parameter @xmath55 in the deformation current . in the limit case of @xmath56 the flux",
    "is @xmath57 ( or @xmath58 if the underlying crystal lattice has hexagonal symmetry ) .    in the nonchiral @xmath1-wave superconductor in layered",
    "cuprate oxides the order parameter can be represented by : @xmath59 the same twisted vortex loop with @xmath47 and @xmath48 , leads to the change of sign of the order parameter , which must be compensated by a change of its phase @xmath38 by @xmath36 .",
    "this corresponds to the @xmath43 of circulation quantum .",
    "the fractional flux trapped by the loop is now exactly @xmath60 , since the parameter @xmath55 in eq.([superfluidcurrent ] ) is exactly zero in nonchiral superconductors .",
    "the same reasoning gives rise to the @xmath60 flux attached to the tricrystal line @xcite : around this line one has @xmath61 and @xmath62 .",
    "observation of the fractional flux different from @xmath60 would indicate breaking of the time reversal symmetry @xcite .",
    "let us also mention that the vortex sheet with fractional elementary vortices has been predicted to exist in chiral superconductors @xcite , even before the experimental identification of the vortex sheet in @xmath0he - a .",
    "the object which traps vorticity is the domain wall separating domains with the opposite orientations of the @xmath26-vector @xcite .",
    "the kink  the bloch line  in the domain wall is the vortex with the fractional winding number @xmath43 .",
    "when there are many fractional vortices ( kinks ) trapped , they form the vortex sheet , which as suggested in @xcite can be responsible for the flux flow dynamics in the low - t phase of the heavy fermionic superconductor upt@xmath63 .    in conclusion of this section",
    "let us mention an exotic combined object in @xmath0he - a which still have not been observed  vortex terminated by hedgehog @xcite .",
    "four equally `` charged '' half - quantum vortices , i.e. each with @xmath64 winding number , can meet each other at one point  the hedgehog in the @xmath26 field ( see review @xcite ) . such combined object , which reminds the dirac magnetic monopole with one or several physical dirac strings , is called a nexus in relativistic theories @xcite . in electroweak theory the monopole - antimonopole pair connected by @xmath65 string is called a dumbell @xcite",
    ". these objects can exist in chiral superconductors too , where the nexus has a magnetic charge emanating radially from the hedgehog : this charge is compensated by the flux supplied to the hedgehog by @xmath43 abrikosov vortices .",
    "nexus provides a natural trap for massive magnetic monopole ",
    "t hooft - polyakov magnetic monopole .",
    "if such a monopole enters the chiral superconductor , it is bound to the hedgehog by two @xmath28 or four @xmath43 vortices @xcite .",
    "in a vector bose - condensate with the hyperfine spin @xmath66 an order parameter consists of 3 complex amplitudes of spin projections @xmath67 .",
    "they can be organized to form the complex vector @xmath39 : @xmath68 there are two symmetrically distinct phases of the @xmath66 bose - condensates : ( i ) the chiral state , which mimics the orbital part of the @xmath0he - a order parameter in eq.([orderparameter ] ) , @xmath69 , @xmath70 , occurs when the scattering length @xmath71 in the scattering channel of two atoms with the total spin 2 is less than that with the total spin zero , @xmath72 @xcite .",
    "( ii ) the nonchiral state , which mimics the spin part of the @xmath0he - a order parameter in eq.([orderparameter ] ) , @xmath73 , occurs for @xmath74 .",
    "each of the two states shares some properties of superfluid @xmath0he - a .",
    "in particular , the chiral state ( i ) has continuous @xmath24 vortices @xcite , which are called skyrmions there . an optical method to create half of the full skyrmion  the",
    "mermin - ho continuous vortices with @xmath75 winding  in the @xmath66 bose - condensates has been recently discussed in ref .",
    "the nonchiral state ( ii ) may contain @xmath43 vortex  the combination of @xmath36-vortex in the phase @xmath38 and @xmath36-disclination in the vector @xmath16 as in eq.([halfquantumvortex]):@xcite @xmath76 in spin projection representation the order parameter far from the core is @xmath77 this means that the @xmath43 vortex can be represented as a vortex in the @xmath78 component , while the @xmath79 component is vortex - free .",
    "the same two cases can occur in a mixture of two condensates .",
    "the skyrmion and @xmath43-vortex can be written in the same form : @xmath80 for skyrmion one has @xmath81 and @xmath82 .",
    "this represents the @xmath28 vortex in condensate @xmath83 , whose soft core is filled by the condensate @xmath84 as was observed in ref.@xcite .",
    "note that this is the full skyrmion , i.e. the @xmath85 vector sweeps the whole sphere , however it has @xmath28 winding instead of @xmath25 in a vector bose - condensate @xcite .",
    "the @xmath43-vortex is obtained if @xmath86 : it is the @xmath28 vortex in the @xmath83 component , while the @xmath84 component is vortex - free .",
    "interesting phenomena to be observed are related to behavior of fermionic quasiparticles in topologically nontrivial environments provided by fractional vortices and monopoles . in the presence of a monopole",
    "the quantum statistics of particles can change , e.g. isospin degrees of freedom are trasformed to spin degrees @xcite .",
    "there are also the fermion zero modes : bound states of fermions at monopole or vortex with exactly zero energy .",
    "the low - energy fermions bound to the vortex core play the main role in the thermodynamics and dynamics of the vortex state in superconductors and fermi - superfluids .",
    "the spectrum of low - energy bound states in the core of the @xmath87 vortex in @xmath88-wave superconductor was obtained in ref.@xcite @xmath89 this spectrum is two - fold degenerate due to spin degrees of freedom .",
    "the integral quantum number @xmath90 is related to the angular momentum of the fermions @xmath91 .",
    "the level spacing is small compared to the energy gap of the quasiparticles outside the core , @xmath92 , and the discrete nature of the spectrum becomes revealed only at @xmath93 .",
    "there are no quasiparticle states with energies below @xmath94 .",
    "the latter , however , can appear if the core structure is deformed @xcite , or in some regions of the magnetic field due to zeeman splitting @xcite : one or several energy levels cross zero as a function of momentum @xmath95 , and one obtains the 1d fermi liquid(s ) living in the vortex core , which can exhibit all the exotic properties of 1d fermi systems including peierls instability @xcite and luttinger liquid physics @xcite .",
    "@xmath96 vortex in @xmath0he - a has also equidistant energy levels but the maslov index in bohr - sommerfeld quantization is @xmath97 instead of @xmath98 in eq.([caroli ] ) @xcite : @xmath99 the spectrum now contains the state with @xmath100 , which has exactly zero energy .",
    "this @xmath101 level is doubly degenerate due to spin .",
    "such fermion zero mode is robust to any deformations , which preserve the spin degeneracy @xcite .",
    "the most exotic situation will occur for the @xmath43 vortex in layered chiral superconductors .",
    "as we discussed above , the @xmath43 vortex is equivalent to the @xmath28 vortex in only one spin component . that is why each layer of superconductor contains only one energy level with @xmath101 .",
    "since the @xmath101 level can be either filled or empty , there is a fractional entropy @xmath102 per layer per vortex .",
    "the factor ( 1/2 ) appears because in superconductors the particle excitation coincides with its antiparticle ( hole ) , i.e. the quasiparticle is a majorana fermion @xcite .",
    "majorana fermions at @xmath101 level lead to the non - abelian statistics of @xmath43 vortices : the interchange of two point vortices becomes identical operation ( up to an overall phase ) only on being repeated four times @xcite .",
    "this can be used for quantum computing @xcite .",
    "also the spin of the vortex in a chiral superconductor can be fractional , as well as the electric charge per layer per vortex @xcite , but this is still not conclusive .",
    "the problem with the fractional charge , spin and statistics , related to the topological defects in chiral superconductors is still open .",
    "this is related also to the problem of the quantization of physical parameters in 2d systems , such as hall conductivity and spin hall conductivity @xcite .",
