    "ices are important constituents in the collisional formation of comets and planetesimals in protoplanetary disks .",
    "as various species of ice appear in different distances to the central star due to their individual sublimation pressures , there are various icelines within the disk .",
    "planet formation in general but especially collision outcomes are tied to these icelines and the physics of the prevailing kind of ice . @xcite .    in earlier experiments we showed that it is necessary to distinguish the different ices while studying their growth potential @xcite .",
    "we suggested that collisional growth should be most efficient between the water and the co@xmath0 iceline or between 2.0 to 9.3 au according to the minimum mass solar nebula model .",
    "beyond 9.3 au non - polar co@xmath0 dominates .",
    "collision experiments showed that co@xmath0 collisions are comparable to silicate collisions .",
    "an increased sticking of water ice was proposed but not verified in experiments .",
    "h@xmath0o is often considered as a driving mechanism for planetesimal growth due to a high sticking efficiency compared to other materials @xcite .",
    "while this is plausible as water does have a high electrical dipole moment and as individual experiments with water ice point to this , a direct experimental comparison with other ices under similar conditions is missing .",
    "therefore , we compare collisions of pure co@xmath0 , pure h@xmath0o and 1:1 mixtures by mass here .",
    "the experimental setup is equal to the former experiment from @xcite .",
    "details can be found there . in short ,",
    "the experiment consists of a vacuum chamber flooded with different gas samples . in the former experiment we used co@xmath0-gas . in this work",
    "we additionally take a mixture between co@xmath0 and h@xmath0o gases and h@xmath0o vapor . a scheme of the experimental setup",
    "is shown in fig .",
    "[ kryostat ] .",
    "the chamber is cooled by liquid nitrogen to a temperature of 80 k in the collision section . within several minutes",
    "a 2 mm thick ice layer is deposited on the walls of the chamber .",
    "the chamber is sealed and evacuated to an ambient pressure of @xmath21 mbar . by means of a gearwheel driven by an electrical motor ice grains",
    "are beveled off from the cryostate .",
    "this produces @xmath290 @xmath3 m ice particles .",
    "the chemical composition of the produced aggregates depends on the gas ( mixture ) which was used to float the chamber .",
    "the particles collide with an ice - layer of the same composition which is deposited on a copper plate connected to the cryostate .",
    "collision velocities reach up to 1 m / s in this work .",
    "collisions are imaged with a camera at 1250 frames per second with a spatial resolution of 10 @xmath3 m .",
    "experimental setup : a vacuum chamber is flooded with a gas ( mixture ) which is deposited on a cryostate cooled with liquid nitrogen . then the chamber is evacuated to an ambient pressure of 0.1 - 1 mbar and particles are beveled off by using a rotating gearwheel .",
    "the particles collide with an ice layer on a copper plate connected to the cryostate . depending on the impact velocity , sticking or bouncing can be observed . in earlier work",
    "we also observed fragmentation for co@xmath0 @xcite . ]",
    "the colliding ice particles are generated by scraping them off from the cooled cryostate .",
    "the structure and the chemical composition of these aggregates depends on the initial atmosphere within the vacuum chamber .    for pure co@xmath0",
    "aggregates the chamber is just continuously flooded by a stream of co@xmath0 gas .",
    "the co@xmath0 sublimation point is at about 195 k @xcite .",
    "therefore , we argue that the molecules only freeze out once they hit a cold wall but do not already form ice grains within the gas phase .",
    "the scraping then removes material from a solid ice surface . according to our earlier analysis of fragmenting collisions the co@xmath0 particles are small aggregates .    for the h@xmath0o - co@xmath0 aggregates we use the same procedure with a mixture of co@xmath0 gas and h@xmath0o vapor .",
    "the mass ratio between co@xmath0 and h@xmath0o is 1:1 .",
    "this value was determined after the experiment by weighing the mass loss of the ice mixture outside of the chamber , which is caused by the rapid evaporation of co@xmath0 . unlike the co@xmath0 vapour the water supply already consists of @xmath4 m water droplets besides vapour .",
    "the structure of the ice surface will be slightly different then .",
    "we currently can not analyze this in detail but would argue on the state of the ice surface as follows :    some of the water droplets will diffuse towards the walls and stick there as water ice grains .",
    "however , gas molecules will reach the surface by diffusion preferentially ( due to their smaller mass compared to the droplets ) and stick there as in the pure co@xmath0 case .",
    "this leads to an intimate mixture of co@xmath0 and water ice molecules with a certain amount of pure water ice grains embedded which can be regarded as homogeneous material .",
    "our collision results are in favor of this view .",
    "as seen below , we see a clear threshold velocity between bouncing and sticking for particles from the mixed sample .",
    "this threshold is distinguished from the pure co@xmath0 threshold by an order of magnitude .",
    "would the particles which are beveled off be inhomogeneous and consist of large fractions of pure water or pure co@xmath0 ice or otherwise locally distinguished compositions at their surface , then an individual collision should depend on the material during contact which should e.g. be water or co@xmath0 in a given collision . in any case we should not see a clear threshold in collision experiments then .",
    "the same argument holds if there is a significant amount of ice grains embedded but if scraping preferentially breaks the mixed matrix in between which is supposedly less stable .",
    "also then only one sort of mixed surface would interact with the same material . in this case",
    "the mixing ratio might not be the mixing ratio of the matrix material measured ( 1:1 ) though , but might be shifted towards the co@xmath0 fraction .",
    "as the co@xmath0 fraction is high in this case the mix will glue together any pure water ice spheres efficiently , though .",
    "they might be porous , but the aggregates can not restructure at the given impact energies and can be considered as individual grains for low velocities .    for the h@xmath0o sample we flooded the chamber only with water vapour and droplets .",
    "the same arguments hold that there should be a mixture of water ice droplets embedded in a water ice matrix .",
    "it is likely though that the water ice matrix is very thin and weak . in this case",
    "it might not be appropriate to treat the aggregate particles as single grains as already small impact velocities might be sufficient to restructure the aggregate .",
    "some elasticity in larger aggregates is clearly visible in the high speed observations for the case of pure water ice .",
    "this changes the outcome of collisions ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "it will depend on the specific configuration now and the amount of energy that is dissipated by restructuring if an aggregate sticks or bounces .",
    "we should not expect a clear threshold velocity then .",
    "we consider the pure co@xmath0 particles as mixed particles as solid spheres even if they would be aggregates .",
    "all particles are initially modeled as spheres of a size with the same cross sections as the observed grains .",
    "we determined the cross section by optical imaging . this way we get size distrubutions of the particles which can be found in fig .",
    "[ size ] .",
    "size distrubution for the different species of ice particles considered for this study .",
    "the distribution for the co@xmath0 aggregates is taken from @xcite .",

    "a bin size of 20 @xmath3 m is chosen with respect to the spatial resolution of the camera . ]",
    "these distributions are comparable ; they all peak around @xmath250 @xmath3 m and have a medium size of @xmath290 @xmath3 m .",
    "the bin size of 20 @xmath3 m is chosen due to the spatial resolution of the optical system of 10 @xmath5 .",
    "there is an indication in the size distribution of a cut - off at 20 @xmath5 . in any case",
    ", @xcite showed that there is a smallest fragment in a dissipative process so it is not likely for all particles to be covered by a layer of small unseen grains .",
    "smaller particles may be present but should not affect the observed collision outcomes .",
    "the analized grain sizes are a narrow but representative illustration of dust found in protoplanetary disks . here , the sizes reach from sub-@xmath6 , which is a typical size for dust in the ism @xcite , to the cm - regime at which the bouncing barrier sets in @xcite .",
    "the size distribution typically follows a power law @xcite .    since the distributions of all analyzed paticles ( fig .",
    "[ size ] ) are comparable we can directly compare the collisional behavior for one mean size of the different species of ice grains depending on the collision velocity keeping in mind though that aggregation might affect the result .",
    "collision outcomes at low speed can be categorized in two types : 1 ) sticking between the grain and the target at low velocities ; 2 ) bouncing from the target at higher impact velocities @xcite .",
    "the threshold between sticking and bouncing is not only important for understanding whether collisional growth of aggregates in protoplanetary disks is possible but also allows to determine fundamental parameters like the surface energy of the particles @xcite . in general",
    ", there are more effects for higher impact velocities like the fragmentation of or mass transfer to the aggregates @xcite which we do not consider in this work .    in fig .",
    "[ surface ] we show samples of the largest aggregates for each dataset of different ices ( not analyzed collision - wise ) . for the largest aggregates , the surface structure and porosity can be determined easiest .",
    "observation of these particles suggest a more irregular surface structure and higher porosity for water ice . a quantitative analysis of the surface and the porosity is not possible so far .",
    "as described above , due to the variation in the microstructure between the co@xmath0-aggregates and the co@xmath0-h@xmath0o-/ h@xmath0o - aggregates a comparision of their collisional behavior is given only roughly .",
    "the porous structure of the water ice aggregates suggests that restructuring might be important as indicated above .",
    "the mixed ice samples qualitatively look compact enough that they should only show hit - and - stick or just bouncing slightly above the threshold for sticking .",
    "more quantitatively , the collisional behavior can be described by the coefficient of restitution ( cor ) which we define as the ratio of the absolute value of the particle velocity after @xmath7 and before @xmath8 the collision @xmath9 there are many theroretical models describing the cor for elastic , plastic and viscous spheres @xcite .",
    "other approaches try to describe the cor by heuristic functions , like @xcite did for water ice spheres . for the cor resulting from the observed collisions we use our model deduced in the earlier work on pure co@xmath0 collisions @xcite . @xmath10 with the critical velocity @xmath11 , the sticking velocity @xmath12 and material dependend parameters @xmath13 and @xmath14 . here",

    "models three different effects ; sticking with @xmath17 , elastic bouncing with @xmath18 and plastic deformation with @xmath19 .",
    "this function gives the most appropriate fit for the cor for co@xmath0 particles .",

    "this effect distorts the analysis of the data , because low cor collisions might be classified as sticking events .",
    "nonetheless , in @xcite we show , that this effect becomes significant only for collisions with impact velocities below 0.05 m / s .",
    "this is also the reason for deducing the sticking velocity for co@xmath0 aggregates by a model fit in the previous work .",
    "collisions of co@xmath0-h@xmath00 particles are more inelastic than collisions of co@xmath0 , since the cor in fig .",

    "in general , the jkr - theory can give us only an approximation here anyway , because it does not describe nonspherical aggregate shapes and complicated contacts including dipole moments or hydrogen bonds . a more detailed analysis based on thorough variation of the mass ratios ( @xmath41 )",
    "would be needed to quantify this further . however , as outlined above the preparation does not warrant homogeneous mixtures yet but grains might e.g. be core - mantle particles with embedded water ice grains . in this case",
    "the total mass ratios determined by sublimation of the co@xmath0 afterwards could be different from mass ratios of the surfaces which are actually in contact during a collision .",
    "hence , such a study would require a spatially resolved analysis of the composition of the grains on the nm - scale .",
    "this seems feasible with current microscopic techniques but due to the volatile nature of the ices this is not straightforward and is beyond the scope of this paper .",

    "our deduced values for pure co@xmath0 is also overestimating existing values by a factor of a few @xcite . experimental work from @xcite suggested that the model by @xcite might give values for @xmath12 which are an order of magnitude too low .",
    "if this is a theoretical ( model ) / experimental mismatch , our deduced values from eq . could be overestimated by an order of magnitude though they would be self - consistent among themselves .",
    "another uncertainty in the calculation of the surface energy is the structure of the particles .",
    "for once they are irregular and not spheres and likely can be small aggregates . with the optical observation used we can not resolve the particles further and do not know the total mass exactly .",
    "we used bulk densities instead . in total , the value in eq .",
    "should rather be treated as an estimation than an exact result at the moment .",
    "this does not devalue the qualitative dependence of the sticking velocity with water content though .",
    "in this work we measured the threshold velocity between sticking and bouncing for collisions of ice grains with a solid wall of the same material .",
    "we studied three compositions : pure dry ice , pure water ice and a 1 to 1 mixture . as we used the same setup , the results are immediately comparable . in all three cases",
    "the average particle size analyzed was @xmath54 @xmath5 @xmath55 @xmath5 .",
    "collision velocities were up to 1 m / s .",
    "our goal was to show explicitly how in comparison the sticking properties of these ices differ in collisions .",
    "while co@xmath0 particles of the given size only stick at velocities below 0.04 m / s , mixtures of 1:1 mass ratio have a sticking threshold at 0.43 m / s .",
    "for pure h@xmath0o ice we could not find a steep threshold velocity but only probabilities on the order of 60 to 70 % for sticking up to 1 m / s , which is likely caused by a fragile aggregate structure . from the sticking velocity for the particles consisting of the mixture of h@xmath0o / co@xmath0 ice we calculate the surface energy to @xmath56 @xmath57 .",

    "we showed that co@xmath0 behaves mostly like silicates @xcite . here , we show that adding water makes particles much stickier .",
