    "a metric on a manifold is a covariant rank-@xmath1 tensor field ( i.e.  it is continuous and bi - linear ) which is symmetric and non - degenerate . as a consequence of continuity and non - degeneracy ,",
    "the signature of any metric is constant .",
    "fixing the signature restricts the set of all possible metrics .",
    "when we speak about `` space of metrics '' in this article we assume that all elements have the same prescribed signature .",
    "it is one aim to discuss the fundamentals of the geometry of such a space .",
    "in fact , the requirement for non - degeneracy , or equivalently , for a fixed signature , imposes a _ non - linear constraint _ on metrics , and all non - trivial geometric properties of the space of metrics are due to this requirement .",
    "while the constraint must be strictly satisfied in general relativity , it is not clear a priori if it should be respected in a gravitational path integral , too @xcite .",
    "however , in the class of actions that we would like to consider , i.e.  functionals constructed from invariants of the type @xmath2 , @xmath3 , etc . , it is crucial to have a non - degenerate metric",
    ". otherwise , the volume element @xmath4 could vanish and the inverse metric required to raise indices could be non - existent .",
    "therefore , we take the view that the constraint has also to be taken into account in the domain of integration in a path integral .",
    "the application of conventional quantum field theory methods to gravity requires the introduction of a background metric , say , @xmath5 .",
    "usually , the dynamical metric @xmath6 is split into background and fluctuations @xmath7 in the standard linear way by writing @xmath8 due to the non - linear constraint , however , the space of metrics is not a vector space , and thus , the addition in equation has to be handled with care .",
    "there are two ways to approach this difficulty @xcite .",
    "( a ) if @xmath5 and @xmath6 lie in the same coordinate patch , then @xmath7 can simply be seen as a coordinate increment , where the addition is well defined in the chart .",
    "( b ) in general , one should regard @xmath7 as components of a tangent vector to the space of metrics at @xmath9 .",
    "then the `` addition '' in is to be understood as starting at the base point @xmath5 and going along a geodesic in the direction of @xmath7 which assumes the role of geodesic ( normal ) coordinates .",
    "as we will see , both points of view ultimately lead to a more natural parametrization of metrics in comparison with the linear one .",
    "the gravitational path integral is given by an integration over the metric fluctuations , @xmath10 .",
    "now the different notions ( a ) and ( b ) , which we refer to as non - geometric and geometric , respectively , lead to different implementations of the constraint for the metrics . in the non - geometric interpretation ( a ) we have to _ restrict the domain of integration _ to the ( @xmath5-dependent ) subset of those @xmath7 which define allowed metrics when using . this can be done by reparametrizing the metric such that it automatically has the correct signature for all fluctuations and that the new domain of integration is trivial .",
    "by contrast , in case ( b ) the constraint is _ satisfied already by construction_. the fluctuations are interpreted as tangent vectors that are inserted into the exponential map of the space of metrics , thus giving rise to admissible metrics only .    motivated by a different argument",
    ", one particular metric parametrization has been used previously in reference @xcite .",
    "it is given by the exponential relation @xmath11 where indices are raised and lowered with the background metric , and @xmath12 is a symmetric matrix - valued field , @xmath13 ( or @xmath14 with the shifted index position )",
    ". in matrix notation equation reads @xmath15 with @xmath16 .",
    "note that the factor @xmath17 in the exponent is meant implicitly in equation , indicated by the index positions . in our present context , the special significance of this exponential parametrization lies in the fact that it satisfies the above constraint .    to see this ,",
    "let us first adopt the non - geometric interpretation .",
    "from that point of view we regard equation as a mere _ change of coordinates _ from metrics @xmath6 to symmetric tensors @xmath7 , i.e.  as a _",
    "reparametrization_. it can be shown without relying on geometric constructions based on geodesics that this is a one - to - one correspondence @xcite .. ] that is , not only does the right hand side of give rise to admissible metrics , but there also exists a unique symmetric @xmath7 for any given @xmath6 and @xmath5 .",
    "hence , the required signature constraint is satisfied , and the path integral over the fluctuations @xmath7 captures every @xmath6 once and only once .",
    "on the other hand , let us take the geometric view now , where @xmath7 assumes the role of a _",
    "tangent vector_. in the remainder of this article we will always take this view , unless stated otherwise .",
    "it allows for profound insights into the structure of the space of metrics .",
    "remarkably enough , it leads to the same parametrization as above .",
    "this is worked out in detail in section [ sec : grouptheory ] ( cf .",
    "also @xcite ) .",
    "the construction is based on _ geodesics _ , and thus , the parametrization clearly depends on the underlying _ connection_. we will argue , however , that there is one natural choice of a connection which results from the basic properties of metrics .",
    "accordingly , we consider the exponential relation the most natural parametrization .    apart from its fundamental geometric meaning and its advantage of generating only such metrics that satisfy the signature constraint , the exponential parametrization is further motivated by several physical arguments . here",
    "we briefly mention some of them .    1 .",
    "as already indicated above , the use of parametrization allows for an easy separation of the conformal mode from the fluctuations : when splitting @xmath7 into trace and traceless contributions , @xmath18 , with @xmath19 and @xmath20 , the trace part gives rise to a conformal factor in , and notably , the volume element on the spacetime manifold depends only on @xmath21 , @xmath22 . in the context of gravity",
    "this means that the cosmological constant occurs as a coupling only in the conformal mode sector .",
    "this is one reason for the following point .",
    "some computations are simplified and some are feasible only when using parametrization , for instance to avoid infrared singularities in the search of scaling solutions in scalar - tensor gravity @xcite , for calculating the limit @xmath23 of the effective action in @xmath24 dimensional quantum gravity @xcite , in unimodular quantum gravity @xcite , and for ensuring gauge independence at one loop level without resorting to the vilkovisky - dewitt method @xcite ( cf .  also section [ sec : compconn ] ) .",
    "it is known from conformal field theory studies that there is a critical number of scalar fields in a theory of gravity coupled to conformal matter , referred to as the critical central charge , which amounts to @xmath25 @xcite .",
    "this result is correctly reproduced in the asymptotic safety program @xcite when using the exponential parametrization @xcite , while a different number is obtained when using the linear relation @xcite .    at this point",
    "a comment is in order . the equivalence theorem @xcite states invariance of the @xmath26-matrix , and thus , of all physical quantities , under field redefinitions . with this in mind let us discuss why the choice of parametrization matters at all .",
    "the first point we want to make is that the linear split is often taken seriously where the addition is the usual tensor addition",
    ". the path integral is then thought of as an integration over all symmetric tensors .",
    "this way , it would be easy to evaluate gaussian integrals @xcite , for instance .",
    "however , as discussed above , metrics have to satisfy the signature constraint which amounts to a restricted domain of integration . therefore , _ the exponential parametrization _",
    "_ is a field redefinition of _ _ only if the latter is combined with the constraint_. only then the @xmath26-matrices can be expected to agree .",
    "secondly , one is often interested in off shell quantities , e.g.  in @xmath27-functions for renormalization group studies or in the effective potential part of the effective action for investigating spontaneous symmetry breaking .",
    "in general , off shell quantities depend on the choice of parametrization .",
    "this fact can be important when comparing different approaches that describe the same physics .",
    "for instance , there are several candidate theories of quantum gravity , and the use of a particular parametrization in one theory might be most appropriate for a comparison with another one .",
    "so the choice of parametrization can indeed be relevant in the usual non - invariant framework , and it can be a powerful tool to simplify computations .",
    "pioneered by vilkovisky @xcite and dewitt @xcite , there is , however , a way to construct an effective action @xmath28 which is reparametrization invariant and gauge independent both off and on shell .",
    "the price one has to pay for this invariance is a nontrivial dependence of @xmath28 on the background metric , encoded in generalized nielsen identities @xcite ( cf .",
    "section [ sec : applications ] ) , which obscures relations between variables and makes calculations more complex .",
    "as we will argue , _ the geometric interpretation of _ _ leads to reparametrization and gauge invariant ( but not gauge independent ) constructions _",
    ", too , and it entails a simpler relation between two metrics connected by a geodesic as compared to the vilkovisky - dewitt approach .",
    "thus , it depends on the desired application whether a reparametrization invariant method is useful , and which connection for determining geodesics should be chosen .",
    "above we have seen the significance of the exponential parametrization with its geometric meaning and its many advantages for physical applications .",
    "the present work is dedicated to investigating the geometric structure behind it .",
    "we aim at finding a connection in field space such that the corresponding geodesics are parametrized by relation . to put it another way ,",
    "we determine _ a connection such that the exponential map is given by the standard matrix exponential_.    some of the arguments brought up here for our calculations are already known .",
    "our objective is to collect them , supplement them further , compare different approaches and embed the ideas into a broader context .",
    "this article is organized as follows . in section [ sec : derivationndconnection ] we present a derivation of a connection that leads to parametrization .",
    "we compare this connection with the levi - civita connection and the vilkovisky - dewitt connection in section [ sec : compconn ] , starting from a metric in field space . the main part is contained in section [ sec : grouptheory ] : we rederive the connection of section [ sec : derivationndconnection ] with more general methods borrowed from group theory and differential geometry , where we find that it originates from a basic geometric structure that is given in a natural way . furthermore , we study differences between the space of euclidean and lorentzian metrics , see section [ sec : eulor ] . in section",
    "[ sec : applications ] we discuss the meaning of the exponential parametrization for its application to covariant taylor expansions and nielsen identities .",
    "finally , we conclude with a short summary in section [ sec : conclusion ] .",
    "geodesics on a differentiable manifold",
    " parametrized by means of the _ exponential map _  are fixed by the choice of an affine connection . in this context ,",
    "different connections lead to different exponential maps .",
    "since we have already discussed the importance of the metric parametrization , we now aim at finding a connection on the space of metrics such that the exponential map has the simple form of the standard _ matrix exponential_.    before we start , let us briefly fix the notations and conventions used in this article .",
    "the spacetime manifold is denoted by @xmath29 , and points in @xmath29 by @xmath30 .",
    "the set of all field configurations is referred to as _ field space _ , henceforth denoted by @xmath31 . in the present case , @xmath31 is the space of all metrics on @xmath29 . it can be shown that @xmath31 exhibits the structure of an ( infinite dimensional ) manifold @xcite .",
    "we observe that any spacetime metric @xmath32 at a given spacetime point can be considered a symmetric matrix .",
    "more precisely , if @xmath33 has signature @xmath34 , then in any chart @xmath35 for the spacetime manifold @xmath29 the metric in local coordinates is a map @xmath36 where @xmath37 denotes the set of real non - degenerate symmetric @xmath38 matrices with signature is the number of positive eigenvalues and @xmath39 the number of negative ones . due to non - degeneracy",
    "we have @xmath40 .",
    "matrices with @xmath41 , @xmath42 are positive definite , corresponding to euclidean metrics . ]",
    "@xmath34 , @xmath43 due to this local appearance of metrics at a given point , we may think of the configuration space @xmath31 as the topological product @xmath44 . in practice",
    ", this notion has to be supplemented by additional requirements concerning continuity .",
    "actually , @xmath31 is the space of sections of a fiber bundle with typical fiber @xmath37 and base space @xmath29 , but in the present context it is not necessary to specify this further .",
    "as we will argue , geodesics in @xmath31 are closely related to geodesics in @xmath37 for a certain class of connections .",
    "a generic field @xmath45 can be regarded as the local coordinate representation of a point in field space @xmath31 .",
    "we employ dewitt s condensed notation @xcite , where the ( latin ) index @xmath46 represents both discrete and continuous ( e.g.  spacetime ) labels , so we identify @xmath47 .",
    "repeated condensed indices are interpreted as summation over discrete and integration over continuous indices . by @xmath48",
    "we denote a fixed but arbitrary background field .    our starting point for the derivation of the desired connection will be an expansion of @xmath45 in terms of tangent vectors of a geodesic connecting @xmath48 and @xmath45 .",
    "let @xmath49 denote such a geodesic , i.e.  a curve with @xmath50 that satisfies the geodesic equation @xmath51 where the dots indicate derivatives w.r.t .",
    "the curve parameter @xmath52 , and @xmath53 is the christoffel symbol evaluated at @xmath49 , i.e.  @xmath54 $ ] . we assume for a moment that the geodesic @xmath49 lies entirely in one coordinate patch . as we will see , the connection determined below only gives rise to such geodesics that automatically satisfy this assumption .",
    "then we can expand the local coordinates as a series , @xmath55 we observe that it is possible to express all higher derivatives in in terms of @xmath56 by using equation iteratively .",
    "if @xmath57 denotes the tangent vector at @xmath58 in the direction of the geodesic , we obtain the following relation for @xmath59 : @xmath60 with @xmath61 $ ] and @xmath62 . in standard index notation equation",
    "reads @xmath63 this expansion is to be compared with the exponential metric parametrization , which can be written as the series @xmath64 from the second order terms in and we can finally read off the connection @xmath65 .. ] since the result is valid for arbitrary base points @xmath5 , we can go over to its unbarred version , i.e.  to the connection evaluated at @xmath6 , and we obtain @xmath66 this is the main result of this section .    it remains to be shown that the connection is consistent also with all higher orders in and .",
    "one can check as an easy exercise that the third order terms do in fact agree . for a proof at all orders ,",
    "however , we proceed differently .",
    "the idea is to find exact solutions to the geodesic equation based on the connection .    but first , we make an important remark about a fundamental property of the connection . since @xmath67 is proportional to @xmath68 , all integrations in are trivial . thus , the geodesic equation is _ effectively pointwise _ with respect to the spacetime .",
    "as already stated above , at any given point @xmath69 the metric can be considered an element of @xmath37 , defined in , which is an open and connected subset in the vector space of symmetric matrices ( cf .",
    "discussion in section [ sec : grouptheory ] ) , and which can thus be covered with one coordinate chart .",
    "therefore , geodesics corresponding to stay indeed in one chart .    due to the pointwise character of the geodesic equation ,",
    "the dependence on @xmath69 is not written explicitly in the following .",
    "now equation becomes @xmath70 after multiplication with @xmath71 , we observe that can be brought to the form @xmath72 that is , @xmath73 . in matrix notation",
    "this reads @xmath74 equation is known to have the unique solution @xmath75 . with the initial conditions @xmath76 and",
    "@xmath77 we obtain @xmath78 , which finally leads to @xmath79 at @xmath80 and in index notation this is precisely the exponential relation for the metric .",
    "hence we have proven that geodesics corresponding to the connection are uniquely parametrized by @xmath0 . as a result , and agree at all orders .",
    "note that equation defines a geodesic in @xmath37 , too , as it holds at each spacetime point @xmath69 separately , while it becomes a geodesic in @xmath31 when regarding @xmath9 and @xmath12 as @xmath69-dependent tensor fields .",
    "continuity of @xmath33 with respect to @xmath69 is then ensured by continuity of @xmath9 and @xmath12 .    in conclusion , there is indeed a connection that defines a structure on field space @xmath31 entailing a simple parametrization of geodesics . whether there is even more structure by virtue of a field space metric",
    "will be discussed in the following section .",
    "above we showed that the field space @xmath31 can be equipped with a connection @xmath81 that reproduces the exponential parametrization .",
    "now , we discuss different connections on field space known from the literature and their relation to the new connection .",
    "as we already described in the previous section , the metric @xmath6 is a map from the spacetime manifold @xmath29 to the set of non - degenerate symmetric matrices @xmath37 , which by itself carries the structure of a manifold . including field space",
    ", we are dealing with three manifolds in total , which we carefully distinguish .",
    "we will see that all of them can be equipped with a metric , leading to the three ( semi- ) riemannian manifolds @xmath82 where @xmath83 is the spacetime metric , @xmath84 is the metric in @xmath37 and @xmath85 denotes the field space metric .",
    "note that @xmath6 also represents a point in @xmath31 .",
    "the field space metric @xmath85 is part of the definition of the theory under consideration , but nevertheless , it can be fixed if a few requirements are made .",
    "firstly , we want to take into account that gravity is a gauge theory .",
    "the classical action is invariant under diffeomorphisms , and so are all physical quantities .",
    "this leads to the reasonable requirement that the metric @xmath85 on @xmath31 be gauge invariant , too , i.e.  that the action of the gauge group on @xmath31 be an isometry . in general terms",
    ", a gauge transformation can be written as @xmath86 \\delta\\epsilon^\\alpha\\ , ,   \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath87 parametrizes the transformation and the @xmath88 are the generators of the gauge group @xmath89 . in the case of gravity",
    ", equation reads @xmath90 , with the lie derivative @xmath91 along a vector field @xmath92 .",
    "the action of @xmath89 on @xmath31 induces a principal bundle structure .",
    "points that are connected by gauge transformations are physically equivalent while the space of orbits @xmath93 contains all physically nonequivalent configurations .",
    "now , if the gauge group is to generate isometric motions in @xmath31 , then the field space metric @xmath94 $ ] must satisfy killing s equation , i.e.  our first requirement reads @xmath95 where commas denote functional derivatives with respect to the field @xmath45 .",
    "secondly , we require that @xmath94 $ ] be ultra - local , i.e. that it involve only undifferentiated @xmath96 s and that it be diagonal in @xmath69-space .",
    "there is a unique one - parameter family of field space metrics satisfying all requirements , which is known as dewitt metric @xcite .",
    "it reads @xmath97 = { \\sqrt{g}}\\left(g^{\\mu(\\rho } g^{\\sigma)\\nu } + \\frac{c}{2}\\ , g^{\\mu\\nu }    g^{\\rho\\sigma}\\right ) \\delta(x - y ) \\",
    ", , \\label{eqn : dewitt_metric}\\ ] ] where the @xmath69-dependence of @xmath6 is implicit .",
    "this metric on @xmath31 is our starting point .    from it",
    "we can deduce a metric on @xmath37 as well by identifying it with the tensor part of the dewitt metric .",
    "( the factor @xmath4 in is needed only to make @xmath98 a bi - tensor density of correct weight . )",
    "that is , we define @xmath99 hence , the dewitt metric can be written as @xmath97 = \\sqrt{g(x)}\\ , \\gamma^{\\mu\\nu\\,\\rho\\sigma } ( g(x))\\ , \\delta(x - y ) \\ , .",
    "\\label{eqn : ultra_local_metric}\\ ] ]    next , we determine the levi - civita ( lc ) connection on @xmath37 w.r.t .",
    "the metric , where we point out the difference compared with the lc connection on @xmath31 induced by the dewitt metric . in the following",
    ", capital latin indices abbreviate pairs of spacetime indices , e.g.  @xmath100 .",
    "let @xmath101 denote the lc connection on @xmath37 .",
    "by definition we have @xmath102 notably , a direct calculation yields @xmath103 which has exactly the same tensor structure as our connection given by , reproducing the exponential parametrization .    with this in mind , let us construct connections on field space @xmath31 now .",
    "for that purpose we start from the lc connection w.r.t .",
    "the dewitt metric .",
    "it is denoted by @xmath104 , and it follows from the usual definition , @xmath105 its form in terms of field space coordinates @xmath6 will be specified below .",
    "now , a generic connection on @xmath31 can be written as @xmath106 the last term in is an arbitrary smooth bi - linear bundle homomorphism , and different connections on @xmath31 merely differ in that term .",
    "we would like to emphasize that , although by equation @xmath98 is proportional to @xmath107 , the corresponding lc connections are not .",
    "the field space lc connection rather contains additional terms .",
    "we find that it decomposes into two pieces , @xmath108 where the first term is given by equation with @xmath6 replaced by @xmath109 , and @xmath110 reads @xcite @xmath111 clearly , the reason for this difference between the lc connections on @xmath37 and @xmath31 can be traced to a _ non - constant proportionality factor _ relating the underlying metrics , i.e.  to the volume element @xmath112 in .",
    "when taking functional derivatives of @xmath85 they act both on @xmath112 and on @xmath107 in .",
    "thus , the second term in contains only contributions due to derivatives acting on the volume element .",
    "this is a special characteristic of gravity . in other theories , like in non - linear sigma models for instance @xcite , proportionality of a field space metric to a metric in ( the equivalent of ) @xmath37 results in proportional lc connections .",
    "there the volume element is a prescribed external ingredient , while it depends on the field in the case of gravity .",
    "if we want to lift geodesics w.r.t .   from @xmath37 to @xmath31 , or , in other words , if we want to obtain the connection on @xmath31 that reproduces the exponential parametrization , we simply have to remove the terms originating from the volume element .",
    "this can easily be achieved by choosing a bundle homomorphism @xmath113 in which takes the form @xmath114 that choice is perfectly admissible : all terms in @xmath115 are properly symmetrized , and thus , it maps two symmetric tensors to a symmetric tensor again .",
    "therefore , @xmath113 represents a valid bundle homomorphism .",
    "that way , we can indeed reconstruct our connection .    for comparison",
    ", we would like to mention another famous choice for @xmath113 which is due to vilkovisky @xcite and dewitt @xcite .",
    "it is adapted to the principal bundle structure of @xmath31 induced by the gauge group .",
    "the basic idea is to define geodesics on the physical base space @xmath93 of the bundle and horizontally lift them to the full space @xmath31 . in this manner",
    ", coordinates in field space are decomposed into gauge and gauge - invariant coordinates .",
    "the resulting vilkovisky - dewitt connection is obtained by using with the bundle homomorphism @xmath116 where semicolons denote covariant derivatives w.r.t .",
    "the field space lc connection .",
    "in contrast to , the vilkovisky - dewitt connection is highly non - local , containing infinitely many differential operators @xcite .",
    "based on this connection it is possible to construct a reparametrization invariant and gauge independent effective action .    to sum up",
    ", we discussed three different connections on field space @xmath31 , all of which have the form given by equation , using different choices for @xmath113 . setting @xmath117 yields the lc connection induced by the dewitt metric , where associated geodesics were calculated in @xcite .",
    "choosing relation gives rise to the vilkovisky - dewitt connection which takes into account the principal bundle character of field space with the gauge group as structure group .",
    "instead , the choice leads to connection which entails the easy exponential parametrization of geodesics . furthermore",
    ", the latter choice is adapted to the geometric structure of @xmath37 , i.e.  to the local appearance of all metrics in @xmath31 as symmetric matrices with a prescribed signature .",
    "this is worked out explicitly in the next section .",
    "in this section we describe our results concerning the connection and the corresponding exponential map in terms of a more general group theory and differential geometry language .",
    "it turns out that the connection derived in section [ sec : derivationndconnection ] is not merely a choice adapted to one particular parametrization but rather has a more fundamental justification as it arises in a canonical way from the geometry of the space of metrics .",

    "we observe that for the search of a geodesic in @xmath31 connecting two different metrics @xmath33 and @xmath119 it is sufficient to find a geodesic in @xmath37 that connects @xmath109 to @xmath120 for some @xmath121 and repeat the construction for all points in @xmath29 . in that sense",

    "@xcite it can be shown that the points which can be reached from the base point by a geodesic are given by the white region in figure [ fig : reachable ] .",

    "@xmath331 the identity reduces to the standard form .",
    "another instructive limit is @xmath332 which considers flat field space , where the last term in vanishes .",
    "recently , rg flows satisfying nielsen identities like have been studied in @xcite .",
    "it would be interesting to see to what extent the geometry of field space corresponding to the exponential parametrization with its property simplifies the nielsen identities .",
    "we postpone this question to future work , but we conclude by stating that all geometric identities discussed above are valid when using parametrization .",
    "when approaching a quantum theory of gravity on the basis of standard quantum field theory methods involving a path integral it seems inevitable to introduce a background field @xmath333 .",
    "then , fluctuations @xmath334 around this background field are quantized , assuming the role of variables of integration .",
    "we have argued that the path integral should include only proper metrics , i.e.  non - degenerate metrics with prescribed signature .",
    "this requirement is implemented in a very natural way by choosing an appropriate metric parametrization , where we identified the exponential parametrization as the most straightforward choice .",
    "its justification resides in the fact that _ it strictly satisfies the non - degeneracy and signature constraint _ , and that _ it is adapted to the geometry of field space _ @xmath31 at a given spacetime point @xmath69 .",
    "the fluctuations @xmath7 are interpreted as tangent vectors which parametrize geodesics in @xmath31 starting at @xmath5 by means of @xmath335 .",
    "we explicitly constructed a connection @xmath81 on field space that reproduces _ the exponential parametrization as the riemannian exponential map _ from tangent space to field space .",
    "thereby , we can identify metrics @xmath6 as points connected to @xmath5 by geodesics . the `` naturalness '' of the connection and the resulting parametrization originates from the geometric structure of field space .",
    "locally , metrics at a given point @xmath69 can be considered as elements of @xmath37 , the space of symmetric matrices with prescribed signature .",
    "we have demonstrated that @xmath37 is a _ homogeneous space _ which can be written as @xmath336 . for the tangent space @xmath153 of @xmath337 at the identity",
    "there is a vector space decomposition @xmath338 that represents the bundle structure of @xmath339 , where @xmath159 is the lie algebra of @xmath340 and @xmath161 defines the horizontal direction .",
    "pushing forward the space @xmath161 to other points in @xmath337 gives rise to a connection on the principal bundle , referred to as the _ canonical connection_. as we have shown , _",
    "geodesics on _ @xmath37 _ induced by this connection are parametrized by the exponential relation _ . in that sense",
    ", this parametrization arises canonically .",
    "we have seen that the linear split @xmath341 as it stands is not suitable in respect of the signature constraint , which any metric has to satisfy .",
    "therefore , when writing @xmath342 in a path integral , it seems reasonable to assume that the @xmath7 s are tangent vectors which parametrize metrics by means of the `` natural '' relation @xmath335 .",
    "that is , it is reasonable to assume that _ the functional integral measure is simple when using this parametrization_. if one adopted the point of view that the measure is simple when @xmath7 is defined by the linear parametrization , the transition to the exponential parametrization would require the introduction of a non - trivial jacobian @xcite .    as a brief remark we would like to mention that , owing to the fact that the metric is a map between two manifolds , gravity shares many properties with non - linear sigma models , e.g.  the @xmath137-structure as a homogeneous space @xcite .",
    "these models play an important role in many branches of physics , in particular in the context of symmetry breaking .",
    "recently , breaking of spacetime symmetries in gravity has drawn some attention again @xcite .",
    "there is , however , a significant difference between non - linear sigma models and the geometry discussed in the present article .",
    "any metric @xmath85 on field space @xmath31 must contain the volume element @xmath4 , which is field dependent in our case while it is a field independent externally prescribed factor in non - linear sigma models .",
    "we have seen that this factor leads to additional terms in the levi - civita connection .",
    "our approach is to be contrasted with the one of vilkovisky and dewitt .",
    "while the latter takes into account the bundle structure of field space with respect to the gauge group , we take into account the canonical bundle structure of the space of symmetric matrices with prescribed signature .",
    "the vilkovisky - dewitt method is crucial for constructing gauge independent quantities like a gauge independent effective action . due to the non - locality of the connection",
    ", however , it is involved to perform explicit calculations and to determine the corresponding geodesics . instead , our method does not aim at gauge independence , but it leads to a local connection giving rise to geodesics which are described by a simple exponential parametrization . thus , its advantage are considerable simplifications in particular calculations .",
    "after all , whether the connection derived here or the vilkovisky - dewitt connection should be used depends on the desired application .",
    "we would like to emphasize that there is a difference between euclidean and lorentzian metrics .",
    "this difference is particularly important for the gravitational path integral . in the euclidean case",
    "any two metrics can be connected by a geodesic based on the canonical connection .",
    "thus , we have geodesic connectedness of field space @xmath31 . in contrast , this does not hold in the lorentzian case : in spite of geodesic completeness , @xmath31 does not exhibit geodesic connectedness .",
    "there are points that can not be reached by geodesics from a fixed base point @xmath5 , and there are periodic geodesics , i.e.  the cut locus of @xmath5 is non - empty . as a consequence , _ in the euclidean case",
    "the path integral _",
    "@xmath343 _ using the exponential parametrization captures all metrics once and only once_. _ for lorentzian signatures , however , some metrics are covered more than once and some are not reached at all_. this flaw can be cured by two steps .",
    "( i ) one should sum over several background metrics such that any metric can be reached .",
    "( ii ) the tangent spaces should be restricted such that each metric is integrated over only once .",
    "having established a connection between the exponential parametrization and the geometry of field space @xmath31 , we have argued that this parametrization is appropriate for the construction of covariant quantities with respect to the field space connection .",
    "the use of the geodesic formalism allows for covariant taylor expansions and the definition of a geometric effective ( average ) action . with regard to bi - metric truncations for gravity",
    "it would be interesting to see if the geometry of field space with the exponential parametrization can further simplify the nielsen identities and renormalization group flows .",
    "it remains an open question , too , whether the ideas presented here can be combined with those of vilkovisky and dewitt , that is , whether it is possible to find a simple geometric parametrization which respects to some extent the gauge bundle structure of field space .",
    "remarkably , at one loop level the exponential parametrization considered here can already be sufficient to ensure gauge independence @xcite .",
