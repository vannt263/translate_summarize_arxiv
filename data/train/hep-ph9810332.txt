    "we report here on the recent progress we made with the thermal model freeze - out analysis of the cern - sps 200 a gev sulphur beam reactions with laboratory stationary ` heavy ' targets , such as gold , tungsten or lead nuclei @xcite , and we also present the current status of our ongoing effort to understand the results from cern 158 a gev lead beam pb  pb collisions @xcite .",
    "these reactions occur at an energy @xmath0@xmath1 per participating nucleon in the center of momentum frame .",
    "this high energy available materializes in form of high hadronic particle multiplicity which we are aiming to interpret . in this work",
    "we assume local thermal ( _ i.e. , _ energy equipartition ) equilibrium @xcite reached in a relatively small and dense volume of highly excited hadronic matter , the ` fireball ' .",
    "one can argue that the accessibility of many degrees of freedom , as expressed by high specific entropy content , validates thermal equilibrium approach . as of now",
    "there is no established theoretical argument for the rapid kinetic equilibration process in highly excited , dense hadronic matter .",
    "however , this seems to be the case : consider that as seen in the results of the precise measurements made by experiments wa85/wa94/wa97 @xcite , the transverse mass spectra are nearly identical for particle - antiparticle pairs where particles comprise some quarks brought into the reaction , _",
    "e.g. _ , @xmath2@xmath3 , @xmath4@xmath5 . when modeling the production of these particles in microscopic models , we encounter in general vastly different @xmath6 spectra @xcite .",
    "the fireball undergoes complex _ chemical _ evolution until at some stage final state particle abundances freeze - out .",
    "we refer here to the stage in evolution of the fireball at which density has dropped to the level that in subsequent collisions particle abundances remain unchanged .",
    "the mechanisms of chemical equilibration in which particle numbers change are today theoretically better understood than are mechanisms responsible for what is believed to be much faster to establish thermal ( kinetic ) equilibration , where momentum exchange between existent particles is the key mechanism .",
    "recall that it has been the allowance of non - equilibrium chemical abundance for strange quarks which permitted to analyze accurately the experimental strange particle abundance data and to characterize the properties of the particle source @xcite . here",
    "our primary result , concluded from the success of the description of the experimental data , is that chemical non - equilibrium both for light and strange quarks is a necessary requisite for the understanding of the experimental particle abundances .",
    "the corresponding technical refinement not present in earlier work is that we introduce a parameter , the light quark phase space occupancy ( see below ) @xmath7 to describe the light quark chemical non - equilibrium@xcite .",
    "we did not previously consider simultaneously a interpretation of strange and non - strange particles and hence the need to allow for light quark chemical non - equilibrium was not visible to us : the strange quark phase space occupancy @xmath8 was determined _ relative _ to @xmath7 , which we now understand is also off - equilibrium .",
    "since we now can accurately describe abundances of strange as well as non - strange hadrons , we combine in the present analysis the strangeness diagnostic tools of dense matter with the entropy enhancement @xcite .",
    "we side - step here initially , mainly to keep the number of parameters to a minimum , the need to study collective matter flows originating in both , the memory of the initial ` longitudinal ' collision momentum , and the explosive disintegration driven by the internal pressure of compressed hadronic matter .",
    "however , we will present in section  [ flowsec ] a short account of the results obtained with such effects , and illustrate changes that arise in our present study .",
    "we employ the local thermal equilibrium method , and thus use a local freeze - out temperature @xmath9 . regarding chemical equilibration , we will recognize two different types , relative and absolute .",
    "we speak of relative chemical equilibration occurring through quark exchange reactions described in terms of fugacities @xmath10 . in general we will not distinguish between the two light @xmath11 quarks , and thus we use two fugacities only .",
    "the hadronic particle fugacities are obtained from the valance quark fugacities .",
    "however , the fugacities @xmath12 do not regulate the total number of quark - pairs present , and this number has to be controlled by a new parameter , the phase space occupancies @xmath13  again , we shall not distinguish between the two light flavors .    to understand the role of @xmath14 note that any compound particle comprising a particle - antiparticle pair is not controlled in abundance by a fugacity , since the formation of such particles does not impact the conservation laws .",
    "the abundance of , _",
    "neutral pions comprises normally no ( quark ) fugacity at all .",
    "this abundance is thought to be regulated solely by temperature .",
    "this of course implies the tacit assumption of absolute chemical equilibrium .",
    "however , the effective fugacity of quarks is @xmath15 and antiquarks @xmath16 , and thus with the introduction of @xmath14 we can control pair abundance independently of other properties of the system .",
    "the proper statistical physics foundation of @xmath14 is obtained considering the maximum entropy principle for evolution of physical systems .",
    "in such a study it has been determined that while the equilibrium limit @xmath17 maximizes the specific chemical entropy , this maximum is very shallow @xcite , indicating that a system with dynamically evolving physical properties such as the occupied volume will in general find more effective paths to increase entropy , than offered by the establishment of the absolute chemical equilibrium .",
    "the dynamical theory for @xmath8 has been one of the early cornerstones of the proposal to use strangeness as signature of deconfinement @xcite .",
    "a time dependent build up of chemical abundance was first considered in the context of microscopic strangeness production in qgp , after it was realized that strange flavor production occurs at the same time scale as the collision process .",
    "more generally , one must expect , considering the time scales , that all quark flavors will not be able to exactly follow the rapid evolution in time of dense hadronic matter .",
    "moreover , fragmentation of gluons in hadronizing qgp can contribute additional quark pair abundance , conveniently described by the factor @xmath14 .",
    "it is thus to be expected that also for light quarks the chemical phase space occupancy factor @xmath18 . introduction of the factor @xmath19 leads to a precise chemical description of the s  au / w / pb 200 a gev collisions @xcite , which was not possible before .",
    "the tacit choice @xmath20 has not allowed previously to distinguish the different reaction scenarios in pb ",
    "pb collisions leading to contradictory results @xcite .",
    "introduction of @xmath19 , along with improvement in experimental precision , and a greater data sample , allows to develop the here presented precise analysis .",
    "the evaluation of the final particle yields follows the pattern established in our earlier work ( see , _",
    "e.g. _ , @xcite ) .",
    "the relative number of primary particles freezing out from a source is obtained noting that the fugacity and phase space occupancy of a composite hadronic particle is expressed by its constituents and that the probability to find all @xmath21-components contained within the @xmath22-th emitted particle is : @xmath23 the unstable hadronic resonances are allowed to disintegrate and feed the stable hadron spectra .",
    "full phase space coverage or central rapidity region @xmath24 , is considered , where as usual the energy of the particles is expressed by @xmath25 and @xmath26 is the center of momentum rapidity of the colliding nuclei .",
    "hadron spectra are not significantly deformed by cascading decays of heavier resonances at sufficiently high @xmath27 , and all small acceptance particle ratios we consider are thus chosen to satisfy well this criterion .",
    "therefore , in our approach , we first evaluate the partial multiplicities for different hadrons within the acceptance domain , and allow these to decay to obtain the contributing fraction . in principle",
    "the approach must be to take the momentum distribution of primary particles , have the momentum distribution cascade into secondaries which may again cascade .",
    "only the final abundance is then kinematically cut to the experimental acceptance . unless a random simulation is carried out ( unsuitable for rarely produced particles we are interested in ) , this approach is completely impossible numerically : at each level of cascading there is a new level of averaging over the phase space in addition to the one needed when treating the flow , see below , and thus normally only one decay step is accounted for .",
    "our approach thus has the advantage of incorporating multi - step cascading effects , at the cost of somewhat inaccurate implementation of cuts .",
    "however , we believe , and have checked in so far possible , that the theoretical uncertainties our approach introduces are much smaller than the experimental errors .    once the parameters @xmath28 are determined from the particle yields available , we can evaluate the properties of the entire hadronic particle phase space and obtain the physical properties of the system , such as , _",
    "e.g. _ , energy and entropy per baryon , strangeness content .",
    "even though we are describing a free streaming gas of emitted particles , we can proceed as if we were evaluating partition function of system with the phase space distribution described by the statistical parameters , given that just in an earlier instant in a gedanken experiment we have a cohesive , interacting system .",
    "we have implemented all relevant hadronic states and resonances in this approach and have also included quantum statistical corrections , allowing for first bose and fermi distribution corrections in the hadron abundances and in the phase space content .",
    "these corrections influence favorably the quality of the agreement between theory and experiment .",
    "most of our analysis will be carried out under the assumption that the effects of matter flow can be accommodated later , since the @xmath29 particle ratios are not influenced , and the ratios of compatible particles ( _ i.e. _ , those dragged along by matter in the same manner , _ viz _ , strange baryons and antibaryons ) are not affected significantly . while this is correct in general , the precision of the experimental data at this time requires a more detailed study , for the flow also depends on particle mass and strange ( anti)baryons differ by nearly 50% comparing @xmath3 with @xmath30 .",
    "thus , in section  [ flowsec ] , we shall briefly discuss the influence on our analysis of the collective matter flow flow velocity @xmath31 at chemical freeze - out .",
    "several different schemes to implement flow were studied previously @xcite . as our example",
    "we adopt here a radial expansion model and consider the causally disconnected domains of the dense matter fireball to be synchronized at the instance of collision  in other words the time of freeze - out is for all volume elements a common constant time in the cm frame .",
    "the freeze - out occurs at the surface of the fireball simultaneously in the cm frame , but not necessarily within a short instant of cm - time . since we do not use a radial profile of the flow velocity in the fireball , which amounts to the tacit assumption that all hadrons are born at same surface velocity",
    "this would be the case if the chemical freeze - out condition were also the qgp - hadronization condition .",
    "within this approach the spectra and thus also multiplicities of particles emitted are obtained replacing the boltzmann factor in eq.([abund ] ) by : @xmath32 where as usual @xmath33 .",
    "eq.([abundflow ] ) can be intuitively obtained by a lorentz transformation between an observer on the surface of the fireball , and one at rest in laboratory frame . in certain details",
    "the results we obtain confirm the applicability of this simple approach .    as can be seen in eq.([abundflow ] ) we need to carry out an additional two dimensional ( half - sphere ) surface integral with the coordinate system fixed by an arbitrary , but fixed ( collision ) axis which defines the transverse particle momentum .",
    "just a one dimensional numerical integration over one of the surface angles needs to be carried out . to obtain the particle spectra as function of @xmath6 we need also to integrate over rapidity @xmath34 .",
    "this rapidity integration can be approximated for a narrow rapidity interval using the error function .",
    "we consider for s ",
    "au / w / pb reactions 18 data points listed in table  [ resultsw ] ( of which three comprise the @xmath30 s ) . for pb ",
    "pb we address here 15 presently available particle yield ratios listed in table  [ resultpb ] ( of which four comprise the @xmath30 s ) .",

    "pb data , and thus it is likely that the difficulty to balance strangeness in the s ",
    "au / w / pb is really a reflection on the high @xmath27 cuts inherent in these experimental results , which had to be obtained against the background of many soft spectator particles , given the non - symmetric collision system considered .",
    "the specific @xmath43 content is determined to be @xmath44 in s ",
    "au / w / pb case and it is noticeably less , @xmath45 for the pb  pb collisions",
    ". this may be perhaps attributable to greater baryon content of the pb  formed fireballs , and/or , somewhat lower available energy , in case d we find a difference of 0.8 gev per nucleon in the cm frame .",
    "the second explanation may be more to the point considering that in the s ",
    "s case for which we have yet slightly higher energy available in the collision , yet higher strangeness content can be qualitatively inferred @xcite .",
    "thus we question if it could be that the energy of cern experiments is just barely at the critical value and that every small energy increase matters ?",
    "this invites an experimental test , since very probably with sufficient effort more energetic pb - sps beams could be achieved .",
    "the specific entropy content also drops slightly for pb  pb ( @xmath46 ) compared with s ",
    "au / w / pb ( @xmath47 ) for the best case d  these values agree well with the entropy content evaluation made earlier @xcite .",
    "this is so because the abundances of ( predominantly high @xmath27 ) strange particle data are indeed found in this study to be fully consistent within a chemical - nonequilibrium description with the @xmath29 total particle multiplicity results .",
    "the pressure of the hadronic phase space in high confidence cases @xmath48@xmath49 has the magnitude of the vacuum confinement pressure ( bag constant ) .",
    "we do not present here the highly strategy sensitive freeze - out volume @xmath50 , which can be determined assuming that the hadronic phase space comprises for the s  au / w / pb collisions baryon number @xmath51 , and in pb ",
    "pb case being @xmath52 , as stated in @xcite .",
    "however , we find that a spherical source corresponding to the best case d in case of pb  pb reactions would have a source radius 9.6 fm , which in turn can be checked to be in agreement with deconfined strangeness conservation as described by eq.([nsls ] ) , given the established statistical parameters and @xmath53mev .    comparing the two tables  [ tqsw ]  and  [ tqpb ] we note similarities in results which become more clear when we study the extensive physical properties of the two freeze - out systems .",
    "we choose a fixed given value of the freeze - out temperature @xmath54 ( 125200 ) mev and find best values of the other parameters according to the strategy d , and evaluate for both systems extensive physical properties .",
    "this comparison yields a surprise shown in figure  [ compare ] .",
    "we see that solid lines ( case of pb  pb ) are crossing dashed lines ( case of s ",
    "au / w / pb ) at nearly the same value of @xmath55 mev .",
    "thus it appears possible that a universal freeze - out for these and other similar collision systems arises , corresponding possibly to the common physical properties of qgp at its breakup into hadrons  in this context we draw attention to the interesting result about the scale of the energy density at freeze - out : @xmath56 .",
    "these results , along with earlier shown strange phase space symmetry and the coulomb effect in the pb  pb system has as simple interpretation the formation of a deconfined phase in the initial stages of the collision , which subsequently evolves and flows apart till it reaches the universal hadronization point , with many similar physical properties , independent of the collision system .",
    "system dependent will certainly the surface collective velocity  @xmath31 .",
    "so far we have considered only the particle yields , and have not addressed particle spectra which requires that we allow for the doppler - like blue shift of the particles emitted from a moving source at hadronization . to do this",
    "quantitatively we need to consider explicitly the collective velocity @xmath31 , see section [ subsecflow ] .",
    "moreover , while the integral over the entire phase space of the flow spectrum yields as many particles with and without flow , when acceptance cuts are present particles of different mass experience differing flow effects .",
    "while we made an effort to avoid forming ratios of particles which are subject to greatly differing flow effects , we must expect some change in our results .",
    "we will consider here the radial flow model , perhaps of the simplest of the complex flow cases possible @xcite , but it suffices to fully assess the impact of flow on our analysis .",
    "we deal with the doppler effect as follows : for a given pair of values @xmath9 and @xmath57 , the resulting @xmath6 particle spectrum is obtained and analyzed using the spectral shape and procedure ( error is proportional to spectral strength ) employed by the experimental groups , and the theoretical inverse slope ` temperature ' @xmath58 is determined for each particle @xmath21 which we can compare with the experimental results for @xmath58 .",
    "let us first address the case of s",
    " w reactions . here",
    "the strange ( anti)baryon slopes are quite similar @xcite . in consideration of , within error , overlapping values of @xmath58 we decided to consider only one value @xmath59 , chosen near to the most precise fitted lambda spectra slope .",
    "once we find values of @xmath9 and @xmath57 , we can check how the slopes of all particles have fared .",
    "the resulting @xmath58 are in remarkable agreement with experiment , well beyond what we expected : we find for kaons , lambdas and cascades the values @xmath60 and 246 mev respectively , which both in trend and value agrees with the k@xmath61 , @xmath62 , @xmath4 and @xmath5 wa85 results  @xcite : @xmath63 and @xmath64 .",
    "since the flow effect shifts particles of different mass differently into different domains of @xmath65 , it is not surprising that the inclusion of flow only impacts the phase space abundance parameters , beyond their established errors . in the theory ",
    "experiment comparison the strategy corresponding to the case d remains the best , it has now ( eliminating to simplify the analysis all redundant data points ) @xmath66dof = 0.73 .",
    "fit f has @xmath66dof = 0.83 , and thus we can conclude that the s  au / w / pb data is fully understood within the freeze - out non - equilibrium model with flow . in order to facilitate comparison with other work",
    "we note here to greater mathematical precision our case d with flow results for s  au / w",
    "/ pb : @xmath67 mev , @xmath68 and @xmath69 .",
    "we also note that allowing for flow the consequences regarding strangeness non - conservation remain unchanged : case d@xmath70 with flow has negligible confidence level with @xmath71/dof @xmath72 .",
    "the strangeness imbalance in fits d , f is the same as we have obtained without flow . we conclude that strangeness imbalance problem we see in the data is not result of radial flow effects .    an interesting feature of case d with flow is that there is little correlation between now 6 theoretical parameters , in other words the flow velocity is a truly new degree of freedom required by the experimental data and it helps attain a good agreement with experimental results .",
    "we also checked that nearly the same flow velocity is found when we only study the particle multiplicity , and disregard the information about the experimental inverse slope of @xmath6-spectra .",
    "it is for this reason that we present here the simple radial flow model , as within this scheme the inverse transverse slope of hadrons is correctly ` predicted ' by the chemical freeze - out analysis with flow , and the systematic change of the individual doppler - shifted slopes seems to be as described above , just right for different particles .",
    "we note that in just one physical aspect consideration of collective flow offers a new insight : the value of @xmath73 we determine is compatible with unity .",
    "this value was noted already in the analysis of the s ",
    "s collision results @xcite , and so far eluded the analysis of s ",
    "w / au / pb collisions .",
    "specifically , we find @xmath74 , @xmath75 .",
    "another result to note is that the specific energy per baryon when flow is present just needs the lorentz factor @xmath76 to be nearly exactly the same as the result we found without flow , which was in fact just the available energy in the collision .",
    "this observation merely proves time and again the physical consistency of the statistical approach to particle abundance study .    we are presently completing a similar analysis of the pb  pb system which shall be reported in another paper @xcite .",
    "our findings are for this reaction case also fully compatible with the picture of the reaction we have been developing here , the major highlights of this work are that the collective radial flow velocity is fitted now to be just above , but compatible with the sound velocity of quark matter @xmath77 .",
    "the chemical non - equilibrium parameters @xmath78 are yet bigger , and exceed both value 2 , the temperature at freeze - out increases slightly to 136139 mev from the value 133 mev we saw in the case d without flow . the fugacities @xmath79 remain unchanged . despite further increase in the values of @xmath78 we still find a smaller specific yield of @xmath80 compared to the s ",
    "au / w / pb case .",
    "the higher collective velocity suggests as possible explanation the fact that the greater internal pressure reached in pb ",
    "pb collisions compared to s  au / w / pb case shortens the effective available time for strangeness production , resulting in lesser yield , despite a expected higher initial temperature @xcite .",
    "a full report on these developments will also contain a possible resolution of @xmath81 high yield riddle exploiting a model involving gluon assisted production mechanism @xcite .",
    "we have presented detailed analysis of hadron abundances observed in central s  au / w / pb 200 a gev and pb  pb 158 a gev interactions within thermal equilibrium and chemical non - equilibrium phase space model of strange and non - strange hadronic particles .",
    "we assumed formation of a thermal dense matter fireball of a priori unknown structure , which explodes and disintegrates into the final state hadrons .",
    "this approach allows excellent description of all abundance data , and when flow is considered , also a good understanding of the transverse mass inverse slopes . for pb  pb system we have , depending on strategy we adopt , no less than 5 independent degrees of freedom , and a few more in s ",
    "au / w / pb reactions , and thus our approach is not a process of fitting an ` elephant ' to a few data , but indeed it should be seen as a solid confirmation the chemical freeze - out as a well defined stage of the evolution of dense matter .",
    "we also find results that may indeed be of quite considerable importance for the search for quark - gluon plasma .",
    "in particular , the physical statistical parameters obtained here characterize a strange particle source which , both for s  au / w / pb and for pb ",
    "pb case , when allowing for coulomb deformation of the strange and anti - strange quarks , is exactly symmetric between @xmath82 and @xmath43 quark carriers , as is natural for a deconfined state .",
    "we find a highly significant description of all experimental data leading to a fireball having specific baryon energy @xmath83 gev , high specific entropy @xmath84@xmath85 , and chemical freeze - out temperature @xmath86 mev . the dense blob of matter was expanding in case of s ",
    "au / w / pb reactions with surface velocity @xmath87 and in case of pb ",
    "pb reactions just nearly with sound velocity of quark matter @xmath77 .",
    "the near equilibrium abundance of strange quarks ( @xmath88 , including flow ) , and the over - abundance of light quarks ( @xmath89 ) , is pointing to a deconfined , fragmenting quark - gluon fireball as the direct particle emission source .",
    "even though there is still considerable uncertainty about other freeze - out flow effects , such as longitudinal flow ( memory of the collision axis ) , the level of consistency and quality of agreement between a wide range of experimental data and our chemical non - equilibrium , thermal equilibrium statistical model suggests that , for the observables considered here , these effects do not matter .",
    "considering the quality of the data description obtained it is impossible to consider the results presented here as accidental and likely to see further major revision .    in conclusion ,",
    "we have shown that strange particle production data , combined with the global hadron multiplicity ( entropy ) , can be consistently interpreted within a picture of a hot hadronizing blob of matter governed by statistical parameters acquiring values expected if the source structure is that of deconfined qgp .",
    "we have further found that radial flow allows to account exactly for the difference between freeze - out temperature and the observed spectral shape , and allows full description of the inverse slope of @xmath6 strange baryon and antibaryon spectra for s - induced reactions .",
    "the only natural interpretation of our findings is that these particles are emerging directly from hadronizing deconfined state and do not undergo a chemical re - equilibration after they have been produced .    _",
