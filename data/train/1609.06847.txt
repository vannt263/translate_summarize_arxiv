    "living systems provide a formidable source of inspiration for the design and synthesis of new classes of materials with a potentially wide range of medical and non - medical applications @xcite .",
    "the structural and mechanical properties of animals mostly relies on collagen @xcite , one of the main protein constituents of the extracellular matrix in connective tissues and an essential component of mammalian skin , bones and tendons . to achieve remarkable mechanical properties ,",
    "long collagen molecules self - assemble into hierarchical structures by forming fibrils that can then arrange into bundles , known as fibers , and extended elastic networks .",
    "the mechanics of fiber networks has received a wide attention both experimentally @xcite and computationally @xcite because of its relevance for applications but also as a model system to understand soft and disordered matter in general .",
    "most of the experimental studies focus on shear deformation of very soft collagen gels which are typically extremely soft at small deformations and become stiffer as the deformation proceeds @xcite .",
    "this peculiar non - linear strain stiffening , observed widely in soft collagen gels under shear @xcite but also present in stiffer skin tissues under tension @xcite , has important mechanical and physiological implications since it provides at the same time stability for large deformations and facilitates soft remodeling at small deformations .",
    "the precise origin of non - linear stiffening is still under scrutiny . in biopolymer networks",
    "this general behavior is usually attributed to a crossover between bending dominated and stretching dominated elasticity @xcite or to the strain induced reorientation of the fibers @xcite .",
    "the application of these ideas to collagen is still debated @xcite and it is not clear if the deformation is dominated by the non - linear response of individual fibers or by collective properties of the network @xcite .",
    "marine - derived biomaterials in general  and marine collagens in particular  are promising materials for applications to tissue engineering . the mutable collagenous tissues ( mcts ) of echinoderms , widespread in all five extant echinoderm classes , display striking passive mechanical properties ( viscosity , tensile strength , and stiffness ) that can be actively transformed within seconds by active mechanisms controlled by the nervous system @xcite . hence , in addition to the mechanical functions usually associated with ` conventional ' collagenous structures ( i.e. energy storage , transmission and dissipation ) , mcts allow for the detachment of appendages or body parts in response to disease , trauma or predator attack @xcite and for the energy - sparing maintenance of posture @xcite . as in mammalian connective tissues ,",
    "most mutable collagenous structures are formed by parallel aggregations of collagen fibrils attached to proteoglycans @xcite .",
    "collagen fibers are usually surrounded by an elastic network further improving the structural and mechanical properties of the tissue @xcite .",
    "besides their physiological relevance , mcts have been recently proposed as a promising source of collagen for applications to regenerative medicine @xcite . in particular , collagen barrier - membranes of mammalian origin are typically used to facilitate proper tissue regrowth in anatomically separated compartments during guided tissue regeneration @xcite .",
    "marine collagen and mcts in particular could provide an innovative and safer alternative to mammalian ones @xcite .",
    "moreover , other new intriguing applications could be derived from the use of collagen derived from echinoderms : for example to investigate cellular contractility as a biomechanics - related readout for phenotypic drug assessment @xcite    in this paper , we characterize the elastic tensile deformation and failure of cross - linked collagen networks derived from three echinoderms ( fig .",
    "[ fig : collagen ] ) : sea urchin ( _ paracentrotus lividus _ ) , starfish ( _ echinaster sepositus _ ) and sea cucumber ( _ holothuria tubulosa _ ) . we analyze the stiffening behavior of the networks and characterize sample - to - sample fluctuations in the elastic modulus and tensile strength .",
    "we compare our results with numerical simulations for a three dimensional model for cross - linked elastic fibrils with parameters chosen to mimic the microstructure of our samples as revealed by sem microscopy .",
    "our model is similar in spirit to recent three dimensional models of cross - linked fiber networks @xcite but its features and parameters are adapted to the stiff collagen networks we study experimentally . in particular , we explicitly endow each cross - linker with bending , shear and torsional rigidities @xcite .",
    "simulations of the model highlight the importance of cross - linking in determining the mechanical properties of these networks , setting the bases for a computational guided design for this kind of bio - inspired materials .",
    "adult specimens of the starfish _ echinaster sepositus _ , the sea urchin _",
    "paracentrotus lividus _ and the sea cucumber _ holothuria tubulosa _ were collected by scuba divers in paraggi ( marine protected area of portofino , ligurian sea , italy ) and quickly transferred to the department of biosciences ( university of milan ) in order to be immediately dissected .",
    "the aboral body walls ( abw ) of the starfish , the peristomial membrane ( pm ) of the sea urchins and the whole body walls ( bw ) of the sea cucumbers were dissected and stored at -20@xmath0 c for the subsequent collagen extraction protocol .",
    "sea urchin and starfish collagen were extracted from the pm and abw , respectively , as previously described@xcite with only slight modifications for the latter ( see below ) .",
    "briefly , both starfish abw and sea urchin pm were dissected in small pieces , rinsed in artificial sea water ( asw ) , left in a hypotonic buffer ( 10 mm tris , 0,1% edta ) for 12 h ( rt ) and then in a decellularizing solution ( 10 mm tris , 0,1% sds ) for 12 h ( rt ) .",
    "after several washings in pbs , samples were placed in a disaggregating solution ( 0.5 m nacl , 0,1 m tris - hcl ph 8,0 , 0,1 m @xmath1-mercapto - ethanol , 0,05 m edta - na ) .",
    "starfish samples underwent an additional washing step in citric acid ( 1 mm ph 3 - 4 ) between the decellularizing and the disaggregating solutions .",
    "all these steps were performed under stirring ( rotating ) conditions . the obtained collagen suspension was filtered and dialyzed against 0,5 m edta - na solution ( ph 8,0 ) for 3 h ( rt ) and against dh2o overnight ( rt ) .",
    "sea cucumber bw was dissected in small pieces , placed in pbs and gentamicin ( 40 @xmath2g / ml ) and left in stirring condition ( rt ) for at least 5 days until an homogeneous collagen suspension was obtained , which was then subsequently filtered .",
    "the suspensions obtained from the three experimental models were stored at -20@xmath0c until membrane preparation .",
    "membranes of the three different collagen types were prepared as previously described for sea urchin collagen matrices @xcite .",
    "the collagen suspensions were centrifuged for 10 minutes at 50x g and then for 20 minutes at 2000x g. the pellet was re - suspended in autoclaved dh2o ( final concentration 2mg / ml ) and 8,7ml of this suspension were placed in 5 cm x 3 cm rubber silicone molds and left dry overnight at + 37@xmath0 c. the so obtained collagen membranes were then immersed in a edc / nhs cross - linker solution ( edc 30 mm / nhs 15 mm in mes buffer 100 mm ph 5,5 ) for 4 h and then washed with pbs , dh2o and ethanol 70% .",
    "substrates were fixed with 2% glutaraldehyde in 0.1 m cacodylate buffer for 2 h at 4@xmath0c and post - fixed with 1% osmium tetroxide in 0.1 m sodium cacodylate buffer ( 2 h , room temperature ) .",
    "after several washings with dh@xmath3o , they were dehydrated in an increasing ethanol scale and treated with a series of solutions of hmds ( hexamethyldisilazane ) and ethanol in different proportions ( 1:3 , 1:1 , 3:1 and 100% hmds ) , mounted on stubs , covered with pure gold ( agar sem auto sputter , stansted , uk ) .",

    "after clamping samples into place , leibovitz l-15 liquid was added on the surface in order to wet them completely .",

    "this feature is possibly relevant in order to use marine collagen in biomedical applications @xcite .",
    "slight quantitative differences exist for starfish collagen that appears to be stronger and stiffer than the other two .",
    "this could be attributed to different cross - linking properties due to differences in the sample preparation and extraction .",
    "furthermore , as in other fiber networks studied in the past @xcite , our samples also display non - linear stiffening and sample - to - sample strength fluctuations typical of systems with a heterogeneous microstructure @xcite .",
    "to clarify the microscopic origin of the experimentally observed behavior , we develop a computational model for the deformation of cross - linked elastic fibril networks .",
    "the model allows to reproduce some key features of the experimental results such as the non - linear stiffening behavior .",
    "if we use linear - elastic cross - linkers , we find non - linear stress - strain curves induced by a reorientation of the fibrils .",

    "when we include non - linear elastic cross - linkers in the model , as suggested by ref .",
    "@xcite , we obtain a more pronounced stiffening .",
    "additional sources of non - linearity may come from non - linear elastic deformation of the fibril themselves @xcite and from internal stresses due to sample preparation @xcite .",
    "furthermore , our model highlights the crucial role played by the amount of cross - linking in determining the mechanical response of the sample .",
    "this suggests an interpretation from the experimentally measured sample - to - sample fluctuations in the stress strain curves displaying large variations ( around 50% ) in the young modulus .",
    "we have performed simulations of the model using the same parameters but different initial arrangements for the fibrils .",
    "when we do this we find much smaller variations of the resulting young modulus ( around 5% ) .",
    "a possible explanation is that the experimental variations reflect internal fluctuations in the cross - linking probability or in their stiffness , quantities that we have held constant in the simulations but have shown ( fig .",
    "[ fig : p - depend ] ) to have a crucial influence on the resulting young modulus .",
    "our modeling strategy allows us to obtain an agreement with experimental results and suggests mechanisms for the observed non - linear elasticity .",
    "the current version of the computational model is presently not able to simulate fracture , since simply breaking overstretched cross - linkers or fibrils leads to discontinuities that are difficult to deal with in the present framework .",
    "a possible solution would involve quasi - static approaches where the network deformation is obtained by energy minimization as for other models for fracture @xcite .",
    "these types of models pave the way for a computationally based design of bio - inspired materials where the mechanical properties can first be explored _ in silico _ to guide the production of materials with desired mechanical properties .",
