    "while the recent discovery of the higgs boson with mass @xmath11 gev at the cern lhc  @xcite confirms the particle content of the standard model ( sm ) , many physicists nonetheless expect new physics beyond the sm to yet emerge .",
    "this expectation arises theoretically from two fine - tuning problems that afflict the sm : one in the electroweak sector arising from quadratically divergent contributions to the higgs mass while the other arises in the qcd sector and is known as the strong cp problem  @xcite .",
    "the latter of these is solved elegantly by hypothesizing the existence of a global @xmath12 symmetry  @xcite valid at some high energy scale  @xcite , @xmath13 gev , where @xmath14 is the scale of the pq symmetry breaking and @xmath15 is the axion decay constant . and @xmath15 .",

    "[ sec : results ] . ] upon breaking of pq symmetry , the axion field emerges as the associated massless goldstone boson  @xcite .",
    "the axion field acquires a mass and hence a potential due to qcd instanton effects . in this case , then the offending cp - violating term ( |-)g^a^a _ can dynamically settle to tiny values . in the process , the universe is filled with a cold axion fluid via the mis - alignment mechanism which acts as cold dark matter ( cdm )  @xcite .",
    "the ew fine - tuning ( or big hierarchy ) problem is elegantly solved by introducing supersymmetry ( susy ) which guarantees cancellation of quadratic divergences  @xcite .",
    "the softly broken minimal supersymmetric sm ( mssm ) then requires superpartners for all sm states which are expected to lie at or around the weak scale , since indeed some soft masses and the superpotential @xmath4 parameter contribute directly to the higgs , @xmath17 and @xmath18 masses  @xcite .",
    "while indirect support for susy exists via gauge coupling unification and the measured values of the top quark and higgs boson mass , so far no superparticles have been seen at lhc .",
    "this latter situation is summarized by mass limits @xmath19 tev ( for @xmath20 ) and @xmath21 tev ( for @xmath22 ) in the context of simple models such as msugra / cmssm  @xcite . in models of gravity - mediated susy breaking , one expects susy to be broken in a hidden sector so that the gravitino gains a mass @xmath23 where @xmath24 is some mass scale associated with the hidden sector and @xmath25 is the reduced planck scale  @xcite .",
    "the effect of hidden sector susy breaking on the observable sector is to induce soft susy breaking terms of order @xmath5 in the lagrangian so that the gravitino mass sets the scale for the sparticle masses  @xcite .",
    "based on recent lhc8 search limits , we thus expect @xmath26 tev which would then imply @xmath27 gev .",
    "in contrast to the expectations for soft term masses given above , it is important to note that the @xmath17 , @xmath18 and @xmath28 masses also depend on soft susy breaking terms and the superpotential @xmath4 term via the shape of the ( radiatively corrected ) scalar potential which determines the higgs field vevs @xmath29 and @xmath30 . for the @xmath18 mass",

    "to avoid large , unnatural cancellations between @xmath31 and @xmath35 in obtaining the measured value of @xmath36 , one then expects that @xmath37 and @xmath35 are both @xmath38  @xcite .",

    "[ eq : lh ]    the soft term @xmath31 is expected to be @xmath39 at some high scale ( usually taken to be @xmath40 gev ) .",

    ". one simple way to accommodate naturalness is to accept that @xmath31 has been driven to small rather than large negative values .",
    "such a scenario has been dubbed `` radiatively - driven natural susy '' or rns for short  @xcite .",
    "in addition to @xmath31 , naturalness also expects that @xmath41 .",
    "however , since the @xmath4 parameter arises in the superpotential ( _ i.e. _ it is supersymmetric and not susy breaking ) , naively one expects it to be of order the reduced planck mass @xmath42 gev .",
    "this mis - match in expectations is known as the supersymmetric @xmath4 problem  @xcite .",
    "solutions to the @xmath4 problem first invoke some symmmetry to forbid the appearance of @xmath4 in the superpotential .",
    "next , the up- and down- higgs multiplets are coupled to new singlet fields either via renormalizable ( nmssm  @xcite ) or non - renormalizable ( kn  @xcite or gm  @xcite ) operators suppressed by powers of @xmath25",
    ". finally , one arranges for the singlets to gain suitable vevs so that an effective weak scale value of @xmath4 is induced .    in the kim - nilles solution  @xcite to the @xmath4 problem , one introduces pq charges for the higgs fields @xmath43 and @xmath44 along with a pq - charged field @xmath45 coupled via _",

    "originally kim and nilles had sought to relate the scales @xmath15 and @xmath24 .",
    "instead , we see that the emerging little hierarchy characterized by @xmath50 may just be a consequence of a disparity between intermediate mass scales f_am_hidden . while it is sufficient phenomenologically to accommodate the pq / hidden sector hierarchy by hand , it would be more satisfying to see such a hierarchy emerge naturally from a particle physics model .",
    "a model which accomplishes such a goal has in fact been proposed some time ago by murayama , suzuki and yanagida ( msy )  @xcite . in the msy model ,",
    "the pq scale @xmath14 emerges quite naturally in that pq symmetry is radiatively broken as a consequence of susy breaking , much like the case where ewsb emerges as a consequence of susy breaking .",
    "the question then is : does the msy model ( or other similar models ) generate a @xmath4 value comparable to @xmath5 , or one that is comparable to @xmath36 or @xmath51 as expected by naturalness ?",
    "we will show in this paper that the latter possibility emerges easily for generic model parameters , showing that values of @xmath4 comparable to @xmath36 can be generated from tev - scale values of @xmath5 ( as seemingly required by lhc8 constraints ) .",
    "thus , the little hierarchy seems to lose some of its mystery , and one can reconcile naturalness with the higgs mass @xmath51 and lhc8 sparticle mass bounds .    to this end , in sec .",

    "[ sec : results ] we present our numerical results showing that natural values of @xmath4 can be easily generated from multi - tev values of @xmath5 . since the pq scale @xmath14 is related to @xmath4 , then the higgs mass , and better yet the higgsino masses if they are discovered , would provide an important clue as to the value of the axion mass . an additional feature of the msy model is that it generates simultaneously a third intermediate mass scale the majorana mass scale @xmath52 associated with the neutrino see - saw mechanism .",
    "in such a model , we expect dark matter to be composed of a mixture of higgsino - like wimps ( but with non - negligible gaugino components ) along with axions .",
    "the exact abundances of each depend on details of the susy axion model  @xcite ( such as axino and saxion masses , pq breaking scale and saxion field strength ) and computations for the susy dfsz model have been presented previously in ref .",
