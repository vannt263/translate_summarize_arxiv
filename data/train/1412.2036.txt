    "r0.45        more than 40 years after the discovery of pointlike components within the proton , its quarks and gluons structure is still not well understood and is still intensively studied .",
    "hard exclusive processes on the proton provide access to the generalized parton distributions ( gpds )  @xcite which contain informations about the longitudinal momentum and the spatial transverse distributions of partons inside the proton ( in a frame where the nucleon has an  infinite \" momentum along its longitudinal direction ) .",
    "such a hard exclusive process is the deeply virtual compton scattering process which corresponds to the reaction @xmath0 and to the scattering of a high - energy virtual photon off a quark inside the proton .",
    "there are two particular cases of deep compton processes .",
    " spacelike \" deeply virtual compton scattering ( dvcs ) corresponds to the case where the incoming photon is emitted by a lepton beam and has a high spacelike virtuality and and where the final photon is real .",
    "the dvcs process has been studied for the past @xmath115 years and is still intensively studied both theoretically and experimentally .",
    "the second particular case of deep compton scattering is the timelike compton scattering ( tcs ) process .",
    "it corresponds to the case where the incoming photon is real and the final photon has a high timelike virtuality and decays into a lepton pair ( see fig . [",
    "fig : tcs ] ) .",
    "contrary to dvcs , there is no published experimental data yet for tcs . both dvcs and tcs give access to the same proton gpds in the qcd leading twist formalism .",
    "the study of tcs in parallel to dvcs is a very powerful way to check the universality of gpds and/or to study higher twist effects .",
    "the reaction @xmath2 also involves the bethe - heitler process , where the incoming real photon creates a lepton pair , which then interacts with the proton .",
    "it is not sensitive to the gpds but to the form factors .",
    "it can be calculated with a few percent accuracy .",
    "the four vectors involved are indicated in fig . [ fig : tcs ] . according to qcd factorization theorems , at sufficiently large @xmath3 ( photon s virtuality ) , we can decompose the tcs amplitude into a soft part , parameterized by the gpds , and a hard part , exactly calculable by feynman diagrams techniques .",
    "we work in a frame where the average protons and the average photons momenta , respectively @xmath4 and @xmath5 , are collinear along the @xmath6-axis and in opposite directions . we define the lightlike vectors along the positive and negative @xmath6 directions as @xmath7 and @xmath8 , with @xmath9 .",
    "we have the properties @xmath10 and @xmath11 . in this frame",
    ", the tcs amplitude can be written in the asymptotic limit ( mass terms are neglected with respect to @xmath12 ) with the ji convention for gpds  @xcite : @xmath13,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath14 is the quark longitudinal momentum fraction , @xmath15 is the momentum transfer , @xmath16 and @xmath17 is defined as @xmath18 in eq . [ eq : h_tcs ] , we used the metric @xmath19 the bethe - heitler amplitude reads : @xmath20 where @xmath21 and @xmath22 are the proton dirac and pauli form factors . at fixed beam energy , the cross section of the photoproduction process",
    "depends on four independant kinematic variables , which we choose as : @xmath12 , @xmath23 and the two angles @xmath24 and @xmath25 of the decay electron in the @xmath26 center of mass .",
    "the 4-differential unpolarized cross section reads : @xmath27 where @xmath28 is averaged over the target proton and beam polarizations and summed over the final proton spins .",
    "+ we define the single and double spin asymmetries as : @xmath29 where the first index of @xmath30 corresponds to the polarization state of the beam and the second one corresponds to the polarization state of the target .",
    "@xmath31 is the circularly polarized beam spin asymmetry .",
    "the @xmath32 and @xmath33 superscripts in @xmath34 correspond to the two photon spin states , right and left polarized .",
    "@xmath35 are the single target spin asymmetries where the @xmath32 and @xmath33 superscripts refer to the target spin orientations along the axis @xmath36 .",
    "the axis @xmath14 and @xmath37 are perpendicular to the incoming proton direction ( along the @xmath6-axis ) in the @xmath38 center of mass frame and are respectivelly in the scattering plane and perpendicular to this plane .",
    "@xmath39 are the double spin asymmetries with a circularly polarized beam and with a polarized target .",
    "we finally define the single linearly polarized beam spin asymmetry as @xmath40 where @xmath41 is the angle between the photon polarization vector and the @xmath42 plane and where @xmath43 ( @xmath44 ) indicate a photon polarized in the @xmath14-(@xmath37-)direction .",

    "top right : @xmath45 for bh and bh+tcs .",
    "bottom left : @xmath46 for bh+tcs .",
    "bottom right : @xmath47 for bh and bh+tcs .",
    "all calculations are done at @xmath48 , @xmath49 gev@xmath50 , @xmath51 and @xmath24 integrated over @xmath52 $ ] .",
    "@xmath45 is also shown for @xmath53 and @xmath54 .",
    ", width=491,height=325 ]    we performed our calculations using the gpd parameterization of the vgg model  @xcite .",
    "we focus here on the spin asymmetries .",
    "figure [ fig : bsa ] shows the circularly ( top row left ) and linearly ( top row right ) polarized beam spin asymmetries as a function of @xmath23 .",
    "one should note that @xmath55 is particularly sensitive to the gpds as it is exactly @xmath56 for bh alone .",
    "it comes from the fact that this asymmetry is sensitive to the imaginary part of the amplitudes and the bh amplitude is purely real .",
    "we also show @xmath55 with a factorized-@xmath23 ansatz instead of a reggeized-@xmath23 ansatz for the @xmath57 gpd which illustrates the sensitivity to the gpd modeling .",
    "in contrast , the @xmath58 asymmetry , which is strong , is dominated by the bh and the tcs makes up only small deviations .",
    "indeed , this asymmetry is sensitive to the real part of the amplitudes .",
    "we display in fig .",
    "[ fig : bsa ] ( bottom row ) two examples of asymmetries with a polarized target : @xmath46 and @xmath47 ( double spin asymmetry ) .",
    "we present the results for tcs+bh with different gpds contributions and parameterizations .",
    "all single target spin asymmetries are zero for the bh alone as they are proportional to the imaginary part of the amplitudes .",
    "this makes the @xmath35 asymmetries privileged observables to study gpds . on the contrary , it is more difficult to access gpds with double spin asymmetries as the bh alone produces a strong double spin asymmetry .",
    "we have presented a sample of our results to be published soon , namely the @xmath23-dependence of single and double spin asymmetries for the @xmath2 reaction which we analyzed in the framework of the gpd formalism .",
    "we did nt discuss this here due to lack of space but we also compared our unpolarized cross sections and our single beam spin asymmetries with those of the earlier work of refs  @xcite and they are in agreement at the few percent level .",
    "we have introduced in our work the target polarization in order to define the single and double spin asymmetries with polarized targets .",
    "we have also introduced some higher twist corrections and gauge invariance restoration terms .",
    "+ as the bh contribution alone does nt contribute to single target spin asymmetries and to circularly polarized beam spin asymmetries , these observables are good candidates to study gpds .",
    "such measurements can be envisaged at the jlab 12 gev facility . in particular , a proposal has been accepted for the clas12 experiment ( jlab hall b ) to measure the unpolarized bh+tcs cross section  @xcite .",
    "the work that we presented here can open the way to new complementary experimental programs with polarized beams and/or targets .",
