    "disordered solids , such as glasses , are characterized by a lack of structural order , which leads to disorder in many physical quantities .",
    "for example , atomic charges in glasses fluctuate in space .",
    "the origin and properties of such fluctuations are of considerable interest in the field of disordered systems .",
    "one such intriguing question concerns the scale of charge fluctuations and possible charge ordering in glasses @xcite .",
    "another intriguing question is related to the possibility of obtaining information about the charge distribution from experiment .",
    "it has been recently discussed how terahertz absorption spectroscopy can be used for this purpose @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we study the atomic charge distributions in glassy arsenic sulfide , as@xmath0s@xmath1 , by means of first principle tight - binding molecular dynamics simulations and compare the characteristics of these distributions with those obtained from experimentally available far - infrared ( fir ) absorption coefficient measurements .",
    "first , we recall how the absorption coefficient in the fir region is related to the atomic charge distribution @xcite . the expression for the linear absorption coefficient of photons , @xmath3 , caused by the interaction with harmonic atomic vibrations in solids",
    "is given by the following expression ( see e.g. @xcite ) , @xmath4 where @xmath5 and @xmath6 are the mass and the dynamical charge tensor for atom @xmath7 ( @xmath8 , with @xmath9 being the number of atoms in a solid of volume @xmath10 ; @xmath11 and @xmath12 run over cartesian coordinates ) , @xmath13 is the @xmath12-component of the vibrational eigenvector of frequency @xmath14 corresponding to atom @xmath7 , @xmath15 stands for the high - frequency dielectric constant , @xmath16 is the atomic concentration and angular brackets denote configurational averaging . as follows from eq .",
    "( [ e1 ] ) , the ir absorption coefficient is proportional to the self - averaging value of the vibrational density of states ( vdos ) , @xmath17 where @xmath18 runs over all the eigenfrequencies , i.e. @xmath19 the coefficient of proportionality , @xmath20 , is called the coupling coefficient between ir photons and atomic vibrations for linear light absorption .",
    "the vdos behaves universally ( @xmath21 according to the debye law ) in the fir regime and thus all interesting and possibly universal features can be attributed to the frequency dependence of the coupling coefficient .",
    "the absorption coefficient given by eq .",
    "( [ e1 ] ) is temperature independent and some variations of @xmath3 with temperature found experimentally for microwave frequencies @xcite , @xmath22 , which may possibly be attributed to excitations of two - level systems and/or to highly anharmonic atomic modes , are not considered here .",
    "the dynamical charge tensors are crucial for a correct description of the peak positions and their relative intensities in the bulk of the vibrational band ( above the fir region ) @xcite but are not so significant in the fir regime and thus a simpler ( rigid - ion ) model @xcite can be used , so that @xmath23 with @xmath24 being the temporally fixed but spatially fluctuating atomic charges and @xmath25 in the well - studied case of ordered systems , where the charges do not fluctuate , and the eigenmodes are phonons , the coupling coefficient is non - zero only for optic modes at the centre of the brillouin zone . in disordered systems , structural disorder leads to charge transfer between atoms , i.e. to disorder in atomic charges @xmath24 , and to intrinsic disorder in the components of the eigenvectors which lose their translational invariance .",
    "these two related sources of disorder , encoded in eq .",
    "( [ e2 ] ) , are responsible for the peculiar behaviour of @xmath26 in amorphous systems , which actually has a universal functional form in the fir regime @xcite , @xmath27 where @xmath28 and @xmath29 are material - specific constants .    in order to see this , we use two facts known about the structure of the eigenmodes in the fir regime and about the distribution of atomic charges .",
    "first , the disordered eigenmodes in the fir regime resemble plane waves @xcite characterized by pseudo - wavevectors @xmath30 and exhibiting pseudo - dispersion , @xmath31 ( with @xmath32 being the sound velocity for branch @xmath18 ) and can be well approximated @xcite by a plane wave characterized by wavevector @xmath33 and unit polarization vector @xmath34 , @xmath35 with @xmath36 and @xmath37 being the position vector of atom @xmath7 .",
    "the second useful fact concerns the distribution of charges in disordered systems .",
    "it has been found in simulations @xcite that the charges in the models of some amorphous materials preserve approximately charge neutrality within certain structural units .",
    "for example , the sio@xmath38 structural units in vitreous silica are approximately electro - neutral @xcite meaning that the positive charge on an si atom is approximately equal in magnitude to half of the sum of the charges on the four nearest oxygen atoms .",
    "the values of silicon and oxygen charges vary strongly between structural units , depending on local structural characteristics such as the si - o - si bond angle .",
    "moreover , the electro - neutrality within the structural units is maintained only approximately ( see below ) and there is always a stochastic component in the charge distribution due to intermediate and long - range fluctuations in the structure .",
    "these observations allow the values of atomic charges to be split into two components , @xmath39 , with @xmath40 representing uncorrelated charge components , and the random charges @xmath41 satisfying local charge neutrality .",
    "the values of @xmath40 depend on the atomic coordinates @xmath42 in a complicated fashion so that we can approximately assume the absence of correlations between @xmath43 on different atoms , i.e. @xmath44 where the variance @xmath45 can vary for different type of atoms , or for the same atoms but e.g. that are abnormally coordinated .",
    "similarly , we assume no correlations between @xmath43 and atomic position vectors , so that @xmath46 the random charges @xmath41 obeying local charge neutrality can be imagined as resulting from charge transfers between nearest - neighbour atoms , i.e. @xmath47 , where @xmath18 runs through all the nearest - neighbours of atom @xmath7 and @xmath48 ( @xmath49 ) is the charge transfer from the originally neutral atom @xmath18 to the originally neutral atom @xmath7 . in heteropolar crystals , the values of @xmath48",
    "are not random and finite . in disordered systems ,",
    "the values of @xmath48 are distributed around mean value(s ) which do not necessary coincide with those for crystalline counterparts ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "such fluctuations and deviations of means in @xmath48 are due to distortions in local structural units , e.g. in bond angles and bond lengths .",
    "we also assume that there are no correlations between randomly fluctuating charges @xmath43 and local charge transfers , @xmath50 the configurationally averaged coupling coefficient can be recast in terms of correlated and uncorrelated charges in the following manner , @xmath51 where @xmath52 ( @xmath53 ) . in the absence of correlations between @xmath43 and @xmath54 ( see eq .",
    "( [ eq : q1q2 ] ) ) , the above formula for @xmath55 reduces to @xmath56 the first component in eq .",
    "( [ eq : c_tilde ] ) can be further simplified as , @xmath57 where we have used eqs .",
    "( [ eq : q1_ij])-([eq : q1_r ] ) . in the case of a two - component system containing @xmath58 and @xmath59 atoms of different types , @xmath60 .",
    "therefore , the first contribution in the coupling coefficient is frequency independent and depends only on the variance of uncorrelated charge distributions .",
    "the second component in the coupling coefficient , @xmath61 , which is due to random and locally correlated charge fluctuations , does not contain the frequency - independent part and , in fact , is proportional to @xmath62 .",
    "this can be demonstrated using the bond representation for @xmath63 , @xmath64 with @xmath65 and @xmath66 , where the sum is taken over all the bonds @xmath67 in the system . in the absence of the plane wave ( * k*=0 ) , this sum equals zero , thus reflecting global charge neutrality of locally neutral units ( the contribution from each bond is exactly zero due to the local charge neutrality ) . in the fir regime , @xmath68 and eq .",
    "( [ eq : s2 ] ) can be recast as @xmath69 with @xmath70 . consequently , the contribution from the correlated charges to the coupling coefficient is @xmath71 so that @xmath72 ( implying linear dispersion in the fir regime ) . the double sum in eq .",
    "( [ eq : s2b ] ) depends on precise structural details of the material but does not depend on @xmath30 in the fir range ( @xmath73 ) and thus the @xmath62-dependence of the second contribution in the coupling coefficient is a general feature of the fir absorption in disordered solids .    therefore , we have demonstrated that uncorrelated atomic charges result in the frequency - independent part of the coupling coefficient , while locally correlated charges , maintaining the charge neutrality within local structural units , give rise to the quadratic frequency dependence of the coupling coefficient .",
    "as follows from the previous section , the coupling coefficient for the fir absorption has a universal frequency dependence ( see eq.([e0 ] ) ) , containing a frequency - independent part and a frequency - dependent contribution ( @xmath74 ) .",
    "the frequency dependence of the absorption coefficient , @xmath3 , can be measured experimentally using thz time - domain spectroscopy @xcite .",
    "the vdos can also be measured experimentally using , e.g. inelastic neutron scattering @xcite .",
    "therefore , the frequency dependence of the coupling coefficient for the fir absorption , @xmath75 , can be found experimentally ( see fig .  [ f1 ] ) .",
    "fitting experimental data with theory  ( [ e0 ] ) allows the values of constants @xmath28 and @xmath29 entering eq.([e0 ] ) to be estimated .",
    "we have done such a fitting to the experimental data for as@xmath0s@xmath1 glass ( cf . the solid and dashed lines in fig .",
    "[ f1 ] ) and found the values of these constants to be @xmath76 and @xmath77 @xcite .",
    "the constant @xmath29 depends on the structural characteristics of glass in quite a complicated fashion ( see eq .",
    "( [ eq : s2b ] ) and can not be used straightforwardly for extracting the relevant charge distributions . however , the constant @xmath28 is directly related to the width of the uncorrelated charge distribution , @xmath78 where the coefficient @xmath79 is given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : c0 ] ) . using eq .",
    "( [ eq : sigma1 ] ) , we have estimated the value of @xmath80 for a - as@xmath0s@xmath1 .    in order to verify and support the consistency of the presented model for the frequency dependence of the coupling constant ,",
    "we have created a model of as@xmath0s@xmath1 glass using density functional theory - based tight - binding ( dftb ) @xcite molecular - dynamics simulation @xcite .",
    "first , we checked the local charge neutrality within ass@xmath1 pyramids , these being typical structural units in as@xmath0s@xmath1 glass .",
    "the results presented in fig .  [ f2 ] clearly demonstrate correlations between the charge at the central as atom and surrounding s atoms .",
    "as expected for such a covalent material , the local charge neutrality is not exact and the data points fluctuate around the bisector due to contributions from @xmath43 .",
    "2truecm    s@xmath1 ( solid line @xcite and circles @xcite ) .",
    "the dot - dashed lines represent the numerical data obtained from a dftb molecular - dynamics model .",
    "the dashed line shows the fit of the experimental data by eq .",
    "[ e0 ] with @xmath76 and @xmath77 .",
    ", width=491 ]    2truecm    , in electron charge units versus the neutralising charge @xmath81 , where the summation is taken over all three nearest - neighbour sulfur atoms .",
    "the dashed line corresponds to the exact charge neutrality , @xmath82 , within the structural units .",
    ", width=491 ]    2truecm    s@xmath1 .",
    "the left curve is for s atoms while the right one is for as atoms .",
    "the dashed curves show the gaussian fits for these distributions with the mean values @xmath83 , @xmath84 and standard deviations @xmath85 and @xmath86 .",
    ", width=491 ]    second , we calculated the mulliken charge distributions for as and s atoms in our dftb model of as@xmath0s@xmath1 glass ( see fig .",
    "the charges are distributed approximately normally ( see the dashed lines in fig .",
    "[ f3 ] ) ) around the mean values @xmath83 and @xmath84 , with the standard deviations @xmath85 and @xmath86 .",
    "therefore , the value of @xmath87 can be estimated as @xmath88 .",
    "this value is somewhat less than that estimated from the fit of the experimental data for @xmath26 by eq .",
    "( [ e0 ] ) ( cf .",
    "the solid and dashed lines in fig .  [ f1 ] ) , i.e. @xmath89 .",
    "several possible effects could account for such a discrepancy .",
    "the mulliken charges are an artificial way of assigning charge values to particular atoms within the dftb scheme - a different population analysis may give different absolute values of the charges and thus different widths of the charge distributions .",
    "another possible reason for the discrepancy is due to the experimental uncertainty in measuring the absorption coefficient at very low frequencies , @xmath90 , caused by parasitic secondary reflections of thz pulses of light which , after the fourier transform , can contribute in this frequency range .",
    "to conclude , it has been demonstrated that the frequency dependence of the coupling coefficient for far - infrared absorption can be used to extract characteristics of the atomic charge distribution in glasses .",
    "namely , a fit of such an experimentally measured dependence by the theoretically predicted law , @xmath91 , allows the constants @xmath28 and @xmath29 to be extracted .",
    "the value of @xmath28 is simply proportional to the variance of the uncorrelated charge distribution , @xmath92 . in the case of as@xmath0s@xmath1 glass",
    ", we have estimated this value to be @xmath89 .",
    "a similar estimate of @xmath93 has been obtained from a first - principles molecular - dynamics model of the same glass ."
