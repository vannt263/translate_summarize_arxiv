    "optical microcavities with embedded quantum dots ( qds ) have become a very active area of research , with applications to triggered single photon sources@xcite , strongly coupled light - matter systems for quantum networking@xcite , and low threshold microcavity lasers@xcite . for these applications",
    "some of the most important microcavity parameters are the quality factor ( @xmath0 ) , mode volume ( @xmath1 ) , and the efficiency of light collection from the microcavity ( @xmath16 ) . @xmath0 and @xmath1 describe the decay rate ( @xmath17 ) and peak electric field strength within the cavity , respectively , which along with the oscillator strength and dephasing rate of the qd exciton determine",
    "if the coupled qd - photon system is in the regime of reversible energy exchange ( strong coupling ) or in a perturbative regime ( weak coupling ) characterized by a modification of the qd exciton radiative lifetime ( the purcell effect)@xcite .",
    "the collection efficiency @xmath18 is of great importance for quantum networking@xcite and linear optics quantum computing applications@xcite , where near - unity photon pulse collection values are required .",
    "microdisks supporting high-@xmath0 whispering - gallery resonances were first studied in the context of semiconductor microlasers in the early 1990s@xcite . since that time",
    "there has been extensive work on incorporating self - assembled inas qd active regions within semiconductor microdisks for studying quantum interactions of light and matter@xcite . with respect to lasers ,",
    "the relatively small modal gain available from a single layer of qds has typically resulted in device operation at reduced temperatures@xcite , or the use of multiple qd layers to achieve room temperature ( rt ) operation@xcite .",
    "more recently , improvements in the cavity @xmath0 have resulted in rt operation in devices containing a single layer of qds@xcite .",
    "furthermore , it has been shown that the collection efficiency of emitted power can be significantly increased by using optical fiber tapers to evanescently couple light from the microdisk@xcite .",
    "as discussed above , these improvements in @xmath0 and @xmath18 are not only important for lasers , but for future experiments in cavity quantum electrodynamics ( cqed ) .    in this article",
    ", we continue our study of taper - coupled microdisk - qd structures by considering device performance as the disks are scaled down in size . in section [ sec : sims ] ,",
    "we use finite element simulations to examine the behavior of @xmath0 and @xmath1 as a function of disk diameter .",
    "we relate these parameters to those used in cqed , and from this , determine that disks of @xmath19 @xmath4 m in diameter are optimal for use in future experiments with inas qds .",
    "section [ sec : setup ] briefly outlines the methods used to fabricate and test devices consisting of a 2 @xmath4 m diameter disk created in an algaas heterostructure with a single layer of self - assembled inas qds . in section [ sec : results ] , we present experimental measurements of the fabricated devices . through passive characterization ,",
    "cavity @xmath0s as high as @xmath7 are demonstrated for devices with a predicted @xmath20 . in addition , photoluminescence measurements show that the devices operate as lasers with rt , continuous - wave thresholds of @xmath211 @xmath4w of absorbed pump power .",
    "finally , the optical fiber taper is used to increase the efficiency of out - coupling by nearly two orders of magnitude , so that an overall fiber - coupled laser differential efficiency of @xmath10 is achieved .",
    "we conclude by presenting some estimates of the number of qds contributing to lasing and the spontaneous emission coupling factor ( @xmath22 ) of the devices .",
    "to study @xmath0 and @xmath1 of the microdisk cavities , finite - element eigenfrequency simulations@xcite are performed using the comsol femlab commerical software . by assuming azimuthal symmetry of the disk structures ,",
    "only a two - dimensional cross - section of the disk is simulated , albeit using a full - vectorial model .",
    "the cavity mode effective volume is calculated according to the formula@xcite :    @xmath23}\\\\ \\end{split}\\ ] ]    where @xmath24 is the dielectric constant , @xmath25 is the electric field strength , and @xmath26 is a quantization volume encompassing the resonator and with a boundary in the radiation zone of the cavity mode under study .",
    "the resonance wavelength @xmath27 and radiation limited quality factor @xmath28 are determined from the complex eigenvalue ( wavenumber ) of the resonant cavity mode , @xmath29 , obtained by the finite - element solver , with @xmath30 and @xmath31 .",
    "figure [ fig : sem](a ) shows a scanning electron microscope ( sem ) image of a fabricated microdisk .",
    "the devices are formed from a gaas / algaas waveguide layer that is @xmath32 nm thick , and due to an emphasis of sidewall smoothness over verticality during fabrication@xcite , the etched sidewall angle is approximately @xmath33 from vertical .",
    "these parameters are included in the simulations as shown figure [ fig : sem](b ) . here",
    ", we will focus on resonant modes in the 1200 nm wavelength band , corresponding to the low temperature ( t=4 k ) ground - state exciton transition of the qds , relevant for future cqed experiments .",
    "we confine our attention to the more localized transverse electric ( te ) polarized modes of the microdisk , and only consider the first order radial modes . in",
    "what follows we use the notation te@xmath34 to label whispering - gallery - modes ( wgms ) with electric field polarization dominantly in the plane of the microdisk , radial order @xmath35 , and azimuthal mode number @xmath36 .",
    "the refractive index of the microdisk waveguide is taken as @xmath37 in the simulations , corresponding to the average of the refractive indices of the gaas and algaas layers at @xmath38 nm .    in addition , the modes that we study are _ standing wave _ modes that are superpositions of the standard clockwise ( cw ) and counterclockwise ( ccw ) _ traveling wave _ modes typically studied in microdisks .",
    "these standing wave modes form when surface scattering couples and splits the initially degenerate cw and ccw traveling wave modes@xcite ; this process is contingent upon the loss rates within the disk being small enough for coherent coupling between the traveling wave modes to occur . for the algaas microdisk devices",
    "we have studied thus far@xcite , this has indeed been the case . the effective mode volume for a standing wave mode , as defined in equation [ eq : mode_volume ] , is roughly half that of a traveling wave mode@xcite .",
    "this is of particular relevance to cqed experiments involving such microdisks as the coherent coupling rate of light and matter scales as @xmath39 .",
    "a qd positioned at an anti - node of the standing wave will have an exciton - photon coupling rate which is @xmath40 times larger than for the traveling wave mode .",
    "figures [ fig : sem](b ) and [ fig : sim_results](a ) show the results of the finite element simulations .",
    "we see that @xmath1 for these standing wave modes can be as small as @xmath41 while maintaining @xmath42 .",
    "indeed , for microdisk average diameters @xmath43 @xmath4 m , radiation losses are not expected to be the dominant loss mechanism as @xmath28 quickly exceeds @xmath44 , and other sources of field decay such as material absorption or surface scattering are likely to dominate . to translate these results into the standard parameters studied in cqed",
    ", we calculate the cavity decay rate @xmath45 ( assuming @xmath46 ) and the coherent coupling rate @xmath47 between the cavity mode and a single qd exciton . in this calculation , a spontaneous emission lifetime @xmath48 ns is assumed for the qd exciton , and @xmath49 is the vacuum coherent coupling rate between cavity mode and qd exciton , given by@xcite :    @xmath50    where @xmath51 is the speed of light and @xmath52 is the refractive index at the location of the qd .",
    "this formula assumes that the qd is optimally positioned within the cavity field , so that the calculated @xmath47 is the maximum possible coupling rate .",
    "the resulting values for @xmath47 and @xmath17 are displayed in figure [ fig : sim_results](b ) , and show that @xmath53 can exceed @xmath54 by over an order of magnitude for a range of disk diameters .",
    "in addition , for all but the smallest - sized microdisks , @xmath55 ghz . a decay rate of @xmath9 ghz is chosen as a benchmark value as it corresponds to a linewidth of a few @xmath56ev at these wavelengths , on par with the narrowest self - assembled inas qd exciton linewidths that have been measured at cryogenic temperatures@xcite . indeed , because dissipation in a strongly - coupled qd - photon system can either be due to cavity decay or quantum dot dephasing , in figure [ fig : sim_results_2 ] we examine the ratio of @xmath47 to the maximum decay rate in the system assuming a fixed qd dephasing rate @xmath57=1 ghz is in general greater than half the total excitonic decay rate ( @xmath58 ) or radiative decay rate ( @xmath59 ) for qd excitons , due to near - elastic scattering or dephasing events with , for example , acoustic phonons of the lattice . ] .",
    "this ratio is roughly representative of the number of coherent exchanges of energy ( rabi oscillations ) that can take place between qd and photon .",
    "we see that it peaks at a value of about 18 for a disk diameter @xmath60 @xmath4 m . for diameters smaller than this",
    ", loss is dominated by cavity decay due to radiation , while for larger diameters , the dominant loss mechanism is due to dephasing of the qd .    for other types of atomic - like media besides the self - assembled inas qds considered here one need not assume a limit of @xmath61 ghz , and we note that due to the exponential dependence of @xmath28 and approximately linear dependence of @xmath1 on microdisk diameter , @xmath62 rapidly rises above @xmath44 for microdisks of diameter only @xmath63 @xmath4 m . these values of @xmath28 and @xmath1 are comparable to those found in recent high-@xmath0 photonic crystal microcavity designs@xcite .",
    "in fact a similar scaling for high-@xmath0 planar photonic crystal microcavities , in which one may trade - off a linear increase in @xmath1 for an exponential increase in @xmath0 , has recently been described by englund , et al .",
    "for now , however , we take the ratio @xmath64 with @xmath61 ghz as our metric , and as such focus on @xmath65-@xmath66 @xmath4 m diameter microdisks .",
    "the samples used were grown by molecular beam epitaxy , and consist of a single layer of inas qds embedded in an in@xmath67ga@xmath68as quantum well , which is in turn sandwiched between layers of al@xmath69ga@xmath70as and gaas to form a 255 nm thick waveguide layer .",
    "this dot - in - a - well ( dwell ) structure is grown on top of a 1.5 @xmath4 m thick al@xmath70ga@xmath69as buffer layer that is later undercut to form the disk pedestal .",
    "growth parameters were adjusted@xcite to put the material s rt ground state emission peak at @xmath5 nm .",
    "fabrication of the microdisk cavities begins with the deposition of a @xmath71 nm thick si@xmath72n@xmath73 etch mask layer through plasma - enhanced chemical vapor deposition .",
    "this is followed by electron - beam lithography to define a linear array of disks , a post - development reflow of the resist , and a sf@xmath74/c@xmath75f@xmath76 inductively coupled plasma reaction ion etch ( icp - rie ) of the nitride mask .",
    "the dwell material is then etched using ar / cl@xmath77 icp - rie , and the array of disks is isolated onto a mesa stripe through standard photolithography and an icp - rie etch .",
    "finally , the disks are undercut using a dilute solution of hydrofluoric acid ( 20:1 h@xmath78o : hf ) ; an image of a fabricated device is shown in figure [ fig : sem ] . during the fabrication , two goals were given special consideration .",
    "as discussed within the context of silicon microdisks in ref .",
    "@xcite , elimination of radial variations in the disk geometry is important for reducing scattering loss ; this is accomplished through optimization of the electron - beam lithography , and in particular , use of the post - development resist reflow technique of ref . @xcite .",
    "in addition , a premium was placed on sidewall smoothness , even at the expense of sidewall verticality .",
    "this required an optimization of the icp - rie processes used to etch both the si@xmath72n@xmath73 mask and gaas / algaas waveguide layer .",
    "in particular , a low bias voltage , c@xmath75f@xmath76-rich plasma is used to etch the si@xmath72n@xmath73 , and a low cl@xmath77 percentage is used in the ar / cl@xmath77 etch of the waveguide to eliminate any sidewall pitting due to excessive chemical etching .",
    "the microdisks are studied in a photoluminescence ( pl ) measurement setup that provides normal incidence pumping and free - space collection from the samples .",
    "the pump laser is an @xmath79 nm laser diode that is operated continuous - wave , and the pump beam is shaped into a gaussian - like profile by sending it through a section of single mode optical fiber , after which it is then focused onto the sample with an ultra - long working distance objective lens ( na @xmath80 ) .",
    "the free - space photoluminescence is first collected at normal incidence from the sample surface using the same objective lens for pump focusing , and is then coupled into a multi - mode fiber ( mmf ) using an objective lens with na @xmath81 .",
    "the luminescence collected by this mmf is wavelength resolved by a hewlett packard 70452b optical spectrum analyzer ( osa ) .",
    "the pl setup has been modified@xcite to allow for devices to be probed by optical fiber tapers .",
    "the fiber taper is formed by heating ( with a hydrogen torch ) and adiabatically stretching a single mode fiber until its minimum diameter is approximately @xmath9 @xmath4 m .",
    "it is mounted onto an acrylic mount that is attached to a motorized z - axis stage ( 50 nm encoded resolution ) , so that the fiber taper can be precisely aligned to the microdisk , which is in turn mounted on a motorized xy stage .",
    "when doing passive measurements of cavity @xmath0 , the taper input is connected to a scanning tunable laser ( 5 mhz linewidth ) with a tuning range between @xmath82-@xmath83 nm , and the taper output is connected to a photodetector to monitor the transmitted power .",
    "alternately , when collecting emission from the microdisk through the fiber taper , the taper input is left unconnected and the output is sent into the osa .",
    "we begin our measurements by using the fiber taper to passively probe the @xmath0 of the microdisks . based on the simulations presented in section [ sec : sims ] ,",
    "we have focused on @xmath66 @xmath4 m diameter microdisks . due to the small diameter of these microdisks ,",
    "the finite - element - calculated free - spectral range of resonant modes is relatively large , with resonances occurring at @xmath84 , @xmath85 , and @xmath86 nm for the te@xmath87 wgms with azimuthal mode numbers @xmath88,@xmath89 , and @xmath90 , respectively .",
    "the simulations presented in section [ sec : sims ] were done for the te@xmath91 mode in the @xmath38 nm band due to the applicability of that wavelength region for future low temperature cqed experiments .",
    "however , for the current room - temperature measurements , the absorption due to the qd layer at those wavelengths is significant , so we probe the devices within the @xmath92 nm band ( @xmath21100 nm red - detuned from the peak ground - state manifold qd emission ) . at these longer wavelengths",
    "the radiation - limited @xmath28 for a given disk diameter will be smaller than its value in the shorter @xmath38 nm band .",
    "table [ table : femlab_results ] summarizes the properties of the te@xmath87 wgms within the @xmath93-@xmath94 wavelength band for a @xmath95 @xmath4 m microdisk with shape as shown in fig .",

    "the doublet resonance appearing at @xmath102 nm in the spectrum is the signature of the standing wave modes described earlier@xcite .",
    "the measured linewidths correspond to @xmath0 factors of @xmath7 , and in general @xmath0s of @xmath103-@xmath104 have been measured for these @xmath66 @xmath4 m diameter microdisks .",
    "the @xmath0s of these modes are approaching the radiation - limited value of @xmath98 , and are some of the highest measured values for near - ir wavelength - scale microcavities in algaas@xcite .",
    "the corresponding cavity decay rates are @xmath105 ghz , over an order of magnitude smaller than the predicted coupling rate @xmath47 for an optimally placed qd .",
    "in addition , these @xmath0s , if replicated within the qd emission band at @xmath106 nm , are high enough to ensure that room - temperature lasing should be achievable from the single layer of qds in these devices@xcite . from calculations of the intrinsic radiation loss , the shorter @xmath107 nm wavelength modes should in fact have a significantly increased @xmath28 of @xmath100 , although surface scattering may also slightly increase due to its approximate cubic dependence on wavelength@xcite .",
    "the emission properties of the qd - containing microdisks are tested at room temperature by continuous - wave optical pumping through a high - na objective lens at normal incidence and , initially , collecting the normal incidence emitted light through the same lens . a light - in versus light - out ( l - l ) curve for one of the @xmath108 @xmath4 m microdisks with a resonant emission peak at @xmath109 nm",
    "is shown in figure [ fig : q_plus_fs_coll](b ) , and displays a lasing threshold kink at approximately @xmath110 @xmath4w of absorbed pump power .",
    "the laser mode wavelength corresponds well with the te@xmath111 mode from finite - element simulations ( see table [ table : femlab_results ] ) .",
    "the absorbed pump power is estimated to be @xmath112 of the incident pump power on the microdisk , and was determined assuming an absorption coefficient of @xmath113 @xmath114 for the gaas layers and quantum well layer .",
    "this threshold level is approximately two orders of magnitude smaller than those in recent demonstrations of rt , continuous - wave microdisk qd lasers@xcite , although the active regions in those devices contain five stacked layers of qds while the devices presented here contain only a single layer of qds .",
    "the low lasing threshold of the device presented in figure [ fig : q_plus_fs_coll](b ) was consistently measured for the set of devices on this sample ( approximately @xmath115 devices ) . in figure",
    "[ fig : fs_coll_vs_fiber_coll](a ) we show another l - l curve , this time for a device that has a te@xmath111 wgm emission peak at @xmath116 nm and has a threshold absorbed pump power of @xmath117 @xmath4w . as demonstrated in ref .",
    "@xcite , the same fiber taper used to measure the cavity @xmath0 can efficiently out - couple light from the lasing mode .",
    "we do this by maintaining the free - space pumping used above while contacting a fiber taper to the side of the microdisk as shown in the inset of figure [ fig : fs_coll_vs_fiber_coll](b ) . from the corresponding l - l curve ( fig .",
    "[ fig : fs_coll_vs_fiber_coll](b ) ) we see that the laser threshold under fiber taper loading has increased from @xmath117 @xmath4w to @xmath118 @xmath4w , but in addition the differential laser efficiency @xmath119 is now @xmath120 compared to @xmath121 when employing free - space collection ( fig .",
    "[ fig : fs_coll_vs_fiber_coll](a)-(b ) ) . furthermore , because the microdisk modes are standing waves they radiate into both the forwards and backwards channels of the fiber . with collection from both the forward and backward channels",
    "the differentially efficiency was measured to be twice that of the single forward channel .",
    "collecting from both channels and adjusting for all fiber losses in the system ( roughly @xmath122 due to fiber splices and taper loss ) , the total differential laser efficiency with fiber taper collection is @xmath123 . due to the difference in photon energy of the pump laser and microdisk emission",
    ", this laser differential efficiency corresponds to a conversion efficiency of @xmath11 from pump photons to fiber - collected microdisk laser photons .",
    "@xmath11 is thus a _ lower _ bound on the fiber - taper collection efficiency and/or quantum efficiency of the qd active region .",
    "in addition to the improved laser differential efficiency of the te@xmath111 laser mode when using the fiber taper to out - couple the laser light , we also see in the below - threshold spectrum of figure [ fig : fs_coll_vs_fiber_coll](b ) that two additional resonances appear at @xmath124 nm and @xmath125 nm . the long wavelength mode is identified as tm@xmath126 and the short wavelength mode as te@xmath127 from finite - element simulations .",
    "these modes are not discernible in the free - space collected spectrum due to their low radiation - limited @xmath0 factors ( @xmath128 and @xmath129 for the te@xmath130 and tm@xmath131 , respectively ) , but show up in the taper coupled spectrum due to their alignment with the qd ground - state exciton emission peak and the heightened sensitivity of the taper coupling method .",
    "the single - mode lasing and limited number of wgm resonances ( @xmath132 when including the degeneracy of the wgms ) in the emission spectrum in these @xmath95 @xmath4 m microdisks is a result of the large @xmath133-@xmath134 nm free - spectral - range of modes in the @xmath107-@xmath135 wavelength band . as a result",
    ", one would expect the spontaneous emission factor ( @xmath22 ) of these microdisk lasers to be relatively high .",
    "a log - log plot of the fiber taper coupled laser emission of figure [ fig : fs_coll_vs_fiber_coll](b ) is shown in figure [ fig : log_log](a ) along with a rate - equation model fit to the data . of particular note is the well defined sub - threshold linear slope of the log - log plot . in this case",
    "the sensitivity of the fiber taper collection allows for the sub - threshold slope to be accurately estimated at m=1.67 , corresponding to a near quadratic dependence of spontaneous emission intensity on pump power ( figure [ fig : log_log](b ) , inset ) and indicating that there is likely significant non - radiative recombination . assuming that radiative recombination occurs as a bi - particle process",
    ", the larger than unity power law dependence of sub - threshold emission on pump power is indicative of single - particle non - radiative recombination processes such as surface recombination@xcite .",
    "given the close proximity of the wgm laser mode to the periphery of the microdisk and the above - band pumping , the presence of significant surface recombination is not surprising .",
    "unfortunately , due to this large non - radiative component one can only provide a _ weak lower bound _",
    "@xmath136 for the @xmath22-factor directly from the l - l curve . from figure [ fig : log_log ] we estimate @xmath137 .    a rate - equation model incorporating bi - particle spontaneous emission proportional to @xmath138 and surface recombination with a @xmath139 carrier dependence ( the ratio of the power law dependences is set equal to the measured sub - threshold slope of m=1.67 ) is fit to the data and shown as a solid curve in figure [ fig : log_log ] . in this model",

    "an estimate for the actual radiative @xmath22-factor of @xmath140 was used , corresponding closely with the partitioning of spontaneous emission amongst the @xmath132 localized and high-@xmath0 wgm resonances within the qd ground - state manifold emission band ) , and suppression of spontaneous emission for qds spatially and spectrally misaligned from the wgms ( @xmath141 ) .",
    "this simple estimate is consistent with accurate finite - difference time - domain calculations of similar sized microdisks@xcite . ] .",

    "as seen in figure [ fig : log_log ] , the fit is quite good over the entire sub - threshold and threshold regions of the laser data .",
    "the inferred surface recombination velocity from the fit is @xmath142 cm / s , extremely slow for the algaas material system@xcite but perhaps indicative of the fast capture rate of carriers , and consequent localization , into qds@xcite . due to the large perimeter - to - area ratio in these small @xmath95 @xmath4 m microdisks ,",
