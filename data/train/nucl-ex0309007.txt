    "the interpretation of resonant structures observed in the excitation functions in various combinations of light @xmath6-cluster nuclei in the energy regime from the barrier up to regions with excitation energies of 30 - 50  mev remains a subject of contemporary debate .",
    "in particular , in collisions between two @xmath7 nuclei , these resonances have been interpreted in terms of nuclear molecules  @xcite . however , in many cases these structures have been connected to strongly deformed shapes and to the clustering phenomena , predicted from the @xmath6-cluster model  @xcite , hartree - fock calculations  @xcite , and the nilsson - strutinsky approach  @xcite .",
    "the question whether these molecular resonances represent true cluster states in the @xmath1 mg compound system , or whether they simply reflect scattering states in the ion - ion potential is still unresolved .",
    "various decay branches from the highly excited @xmath1mg@xmath8 nucleus , including the emission of @xmath6-particles or heavier fragments , are possibly available .",
    "however , @xmath0-decays have not been observed so far .",
    "actually , the @xmath0-ray branches are predicted to be rather small at these excitation energies , although some experiments have been reported  @xcite , which have searched for these very small branches expected in the range of @xmath9  fractions of the total width  @xcite .",
    "the rotational bands built on the knowledge of the measured spins and excitation energies can be extended to rather small angular momenta , where finally the @xmath0-decay becomes a larger part of the total width .",
    "the population of such states in @xmath6-cluster nuclei , which are lying below the threshold for fission decays and for other particle decays , is favored in binary reactions , where at a fixed incident energy the composite nucleus is formed with an excitation energy range governed by the two - body reaction kinematics .",
    "these states may be coupled to intrinsic states of @xmath1mg@xmath4 as populated by a breakup process ( via resonances ) as shown in refs .",
    "the @xmath1mg+@xmath5c reaction has been extensively investigated by several measurements of the @xmath5c(@xmath1mg,@xmath5c@xmath5c)@xmath5c breakup channel  @xcite .",
    "sequential breakups are found to occur from specific states in @xmath1 mg at excitation energies ranging from 20 to 35 mev , which are linked to the ground state and also have an appreciable overlap with the @xmath5c+@xmath5c quasi - molecular configuration .",
    "several attempts @xcite were made to link the @xmath5c+@xmath5c barrier resonances @xcite with the breakup states .",
    "the underlying reaction mechanism is now fairly well established  @xcite and many of the barrier resonances appear to be correlated indicating that a common structure may exist in both instances . this is another indication of the possible link between barrier resonances and secondary minima in the compound nucleus .",
    "the study of particle-@xmath0 coincidences in binary reactions in reverse kinematics is probably a unique tool for the search for extreme shapes related to clustering . in this way",
    "the @xmath1mg+@xmath5c reaction has been investigated with high selectivity at e@xmath3(@xmath1 mg ) = 130 mev with the binary reaction spectrometer  @xcite ( brs ) in coincidence with euroball iv ( eb ) installed at the vivitron tandem facility of the ires at strasbourg .",
    "the choice of the @xmath10 reaction implies that for an incident energy of 130  mev an excitation energy range up to 30  mev in @xmath1 mg is covered  @xcite .",
    "the brs gives access to a novel approach to the study of nuclei at large deformations .",
    "the excellent channel selection capability of binary and/or ternary fragments gives a powerful identification among the reaction channels , implying that eb is used mostly with one or two - fold multiplicities , for which the total @xmath0-ray efficiency is very high .",
    "a schematic lay - out of the actual experimental set - up of the brs with eb is shown in fig .  3 of ref .",
    "the brs trigger consists of a kinematical coincidence set - up combining two large - area heavy - ion telescopes .",
    "both detector telescopes comprise each a two - dimensional position sensitive low - pressure multiwire chamber in conjunction with a bragg - curve ionization chamber .",
    "all detection planes are four - fold subdivided in order to improve the resolution and to increase the counting rate capability ( 100 k - events / s ) . the two - body q - value has been reconstructed using events for which both fragments are in well selected states chosen for spectroscopy purposes as well as to determine the reaction mechanism responsible for the population of these particular states . fig .",
    "1 displays a typical example of a two - dimensional bragg - peak versus energy spectrum obtained for the @xmath1mg+@xmath5c reaction .",
    "this spectrum shows the excellent charge discrimination achieved with the bragg - curve ionization chambers .",
    "the z = 12 gate , which is shown in fig .  1 , will be used for the processing of the @xmath1 mg @xmath0-ray spectra of interest .",
    "mg(130 mev)+@xmath5c reaction with the brs .",
    "the marked z=12 gate is used to trigger the @xmath1 mg @xmath0-ray spectrum displayed in fig .",
    "2._,scaledwidth=44.0% ]    [ fig.1 ]",
    "the inverse kinematics of the @xmath1mg+@xmath5c reaction and the negative q - values give ideal conditions for the trigger on the brs , because the angular range is optimum for 12@xmath11 - 40@xmath11 in the lab - system ( with the range of 12@xmath11 to 25@xmath11 for the recoils ) and because the solid angle transformation gives a factor  10 for the detection of the heavy fragments .",
    "thus we have been able to cover a large part of the angular distribution of the binary process with high efficiency , and a selection of events in particular angular ranges has been achieved . in binary exit - channels",
    "the exclusive detection of both ejectiles allows precise q - value determination , z - resolution and simultaneously optimal doppler - shift correction .",
    "2 displays a doppler - corrected @xmath0-ray spectrum for @xmath1 mg events in coincidence with the z=12 gate defined in the bragg - peak versus energy spectrum of fig .  1 .",
    "all known transitions of @xmath1 mg  @xcite can be identified in the energy range depicted . as expected we see decays feeding the yrast line of @xmath1 mg up to the 8@xmath12 level .",
    "the population of some of the observed states , in particular , the 2@xmath13 , 3@xmath13 and 4@xmath13 members of the k=2 rotational band , appear to be selectively enhanced . the strong population of the k=2 band has also been observed in the @xmath5c(@xmath5c,@xmath0 ) radiative capture reaction  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , there is an indication of a @xmath0 ray around 5.95 mev which may be identified with the 10@xmath14 @xmath15 8@xmath12 transition as proposed in ref .",
    "it has been checked in the @xmath0-@xmath0 coincidences that most of the transitions shown in fig .",
    "2 belong to cascades which contain the characteristic 1368 kev @xmath0 ray and pass through the lowest 2@xmath13 state in @xmath1 mg .",
    "still , a number of transitions in the high - energy part of the spectrum ( 6  mev  -  8  mev ) have not been clearly identified .",
    "the reason why the search for a @xmath0-decay in @xmath5c+@xmath5c has not been conclusive so far  @xcite is due to the excitation energy in @xmath1 mg as well as the spin region ( 8@xmath16 - 12@xmath16 ) which were chosen too high .",
    "the next step of the analysis will be the use of the brs trigger in order to select the excitation energy range by the two - body q - value ( in the @xmath5c+@xmath1 mg channel ) , and thus we will be able to study the region around the decay barriers , where @xmath0-decay becomes observable . according to recent predictions",
    "@xcite @xmath0-rays from 6@xmath13 @xmath15 4@xmath13 should have measurable branching ratios .",
    "work is currently in progress to analyse the @xmath0 rays from the @xmath5c(@xmath1mg,@xmath5c @xmath5c)@xmath5c ternary breakup reaction .",
