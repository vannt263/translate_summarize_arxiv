    "in previous publications  @xcite we have studied the azimuthal angle decorrelation between mueller  navelet jets at different hadron colliders within the balitsky  fadin  kuraev  lipatov ( bfkl ) formalism  @xcite beyond leading order accuracy  @xcite . in the present work we extend these studies to predict the decorrelation in azimuthal angle between the electron and a forward jet associated to the proton in deep inelastic scattering ( dis ) . when the separation in rapidity space , @xmath0 , between the scattered electron and the forward jet is large and the transverse momentum of the jet is similar to the virtuality of the photon resolving the hadron , then the dominant terms in the scattering amplitude are of the form @xmath1 .",
    "these terms can be resummed to all orders by means of the bfkl integral equation .",
    "the calculation for this process is very similar to that of mueller  navelet jets , the only difference being the substitution of one jet vertex by a vertex describing the coupling of the electron to the nlo bfkl gluon green s function via a quark ",
    "antiquark pair .",
    "this observable was previously investigated in the leading logarithmic approximation ( lo ) in ref .",
    "@xcite . in the following we build on that work while still using the lo approximation for the jet vertex and the virtual photon impact factor . however , we improve the calculation by considering the bfkl kernel to next  to  leading ( nlo ) accuracy , _",
    "i.e. _ we also keep @xmath2 terms in the gluon green s function , a process ",
    "independent quantity which governs the dependence on @xmath0 of the cross section , previous analysis in this direction can be found in ref .",

    "we will leave this task for future work .",
    "for the production of a forward jet in dis it is necessary to extract a parton with a large longitudinal momentum fraction @xmath3 from the proton . when the jet is characterized by a hard scale it is possible to use conventional collinear factorization to describe the process .",
    "consequently , the jet production rate may be written as @xmath4 with @xmath5 denoting the partonic cross section , and the effective parton density  @xcite being @xmath6,\\ ] ] where the sum runs over all quark flavors , and @xmath7 stands for the factorization scale .",

    "the azimuthal angle of @xmath8 is @xmath10 and that of @xmath9 is @xmath11 .",
    "we also work with commonly used dis variables such as the proton momentum @xmath12 , the photon s momentum @xmath13 , its virtuality @xmath14 , the bjorken scaling variable @xmath15 and the inelasticity @xmath16 . making use of the relation @xmath17 and the specific structure of the leptonic vertex , we can write the partonic cross section in the form @xmath18 where the rapidity is defined as @xmath19 . in bold",
    "we denote the transverse euclidean momenta .",
    "we can further decompose the integration and write @xmath20 we have introduced a fourier expansion on conformal spins @xmath21 , to be defined below .",
    "the integrals in transverse momenta are taken over the whole two dimensional space while the @xmath22 integrations go from @xmath23 to @xmath24 .",
    "the contour in the @xmath25plane is to be taken to the right of all possible singularities .    in eq .",
    "we have used the transverse momentum representation defined by @xmath26 where the kernel in operator form @xmath27 , @xmath28 defines the bfkl integral equation at nlo , _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath29 to change representation we introduce the basis @xmath30 where @xmath11 is the azimuthal angle of @xmath31 .",

    "unfortunately , to the best of our knowledge , the azimuthal angle correlation between the electron and a forward jet has not been extracted from the hera data so far . for a future comparison with the experimental results in this work",
    "we implement the same kinematical cuts and constraints as those used at hera .",
    "the zeus  @xcite and h1  @xcite collaborations have imposed upper and lower cuts in the transverse momentum of the forward jet taking into account the photon virtuality @xmath39 .",

    "the last term in this equation stems from the scale dependent part of the nlo kernel , i.e. from the running of the coupling .",

    "a prescription to increase the convergence of the perturbative expansion is to improve the original calculation by imposing compatibility of the scattering amplitudes with the collinear limit dominated by renormalization group evolution  @xcite . in recent publications",
    "@xcite we have introduced these collinear improvements to describe azimuthal angle dependences in the context of mueller  navelet jets .",

    "( 24 , 25 ) of ref .  @xcite .",
    "besides the particular experimental cuts in the forward jet taken into account when calculating the jet vertex of eq .  , we also used the following experimentally motivated  @xcite constraints in the leptonic sector : @xmath66 the final expression for the cross section at hadronic level reads @xmath67 with @xmath68 where we performed the convolution with the effective parton distribution of eq .  .",
    "the index in the integral sign refers to the particular cuts of eq .  .",
    "the integration over the longitudinal momentum fraction @xmath3 of the forward jet involves a delta function fixing the rapidity @xmath19 .",
    "it is noteworthy that any additional experimental upper cut on @xmath3 would modify the coefficients @xmath69 , with a negligible change in their ratios .    since the structure of the electron vertex singles out the components with conformal spin 0 and 2 , the number of observables related to the azimuthal angle dependence is limited when compared to the mueller  navelet case .",
    "the most relevant observable is the dependence of the average @xmath70 with the rapidity difference between the forward jet and outgoing lepton .",
    "it is natural to expect that the forward jet will be more decorrelated from the leptonic system as the rapidity difference is larger since the phase space for further gluon emission opens up .",
    "this is indeed what we observe in our numerical results shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : hera1 ] .",
    "we find similar results to the mueller  navelet jets case where the most reliable calculation is that with a collinearly  improved kernel .",
    "the main effect of the higher order corrections is to increase the azimuthal angle correlation for a given rapidity difference , while keeping the decrease of the correlation as @xmath0 grows .     at the @xmath71 collider hera at leading ( solid ) , next to leading order ( dashed ) , and for resummed kernel",

    ", width=415 ]    it is interesting to point out that , even for very small @xmath0 , the inclusive quark  antiquark pair ( produced to couple the electron to the gluon evolution ) generates in the case of no gluon emission some angular decorrelation between the forward jet and the electron .    finally , we estimate the theoretical uncertainties derived from not including the nlo impact factors by varying the scale @xmath72 , and those related to the running of the coupling by doing the same with the renormalization scale @xmath73 . the range of variation in both parameters is between @xmath74 and 2 and the result",

    "the projected center of mass energy @xmath75 is more than four times bigger than at hera and would allow for a larger rapidity separation between the electron and the forward jet .",
    "we use the same cuts as for hera ( eq .  ) apart from an adjusted lower bound for @xmath76 of @xmath77 .",

    "we have studied the effect of higher order corrections to the bfkl equation on the angular decorrelation of forward jets in deep inelastic scattering .",
    "the effect of these additional terms is similar to the previously studied case of mueller  navelet jets at hadron colliders . as the rapidity difference between the outgoing lepton and the forward jet increases , the two systems decorrelate in azimuthal angle due to the extra emission of soft gluons and higher order terms largely increase the amount of correlation when compared to the leading order calculations .",
    "it would be very interesting to extract this dependence from the hera data with forward jets and study how important bfkl effects are for this observable .",
    "if the experience at the tevatron is valid in this case , the bfkl prediction will probably lie below the data , with a gradual improvement of the fits as the rapidity difference increases .",
