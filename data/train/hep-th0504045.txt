    "although black holes in 3 + 1 dimensions are largely stable , an intriguing instability of schwarzschild black strings in 4 + 1 dimensions was discovered by gregory and laflamme @xcite and has been the focus of numerous investigations @xcite , both analytic and numerical .",
    "perhaps the most interesting issue is the question of the end - point of time evolution under this instability .",
    "gregory and laflamme originally argued on entropic grounds that the black string should break up into a set of disconnected black holes .",
    "such behavior is particularly interesting as it would provide a counter - example to at least certain versions of the cosmic censorship conjecture in 4 + 1 dimensions .",
    "the details of the pinch - off process were considered by horowitz and maeda @xcite , who used the raychaudhuri equation @xcite to derive bounds on how fast the area - radius @xmath0 of smallest sphere on the horizon can shrink in terms of the affine parameter @xmath1 along null generators of the horizon .",
    "they found that if @xmath0 tends to zero , it must do so quite slowly with @xmath0 vanishing only at infinite affine parameter . imposing the physically reasonable assumption that the final horizon area remains finite converge on the ` neck ' where the black string pinches off .",
    "this requirement is also physically reasonable , but is technically stronger than finiteness of the total horizon area ( which would also involve an integral along the string direction of the horizon ) . ]",
    "further restricts the analytic form of @xmath2 power laws and simple exponential behaviors are forbidden , and for functions of the form @xmath3 with constant @xmath4 , one must have @xmath5 .",
    "however , as mentioned in @xcite , delaying the pinch - off until infinite affine parameter along the horizon is not necessarily the same as delaying the pinch - off until an infinite value of some time measured near infinity .",
    "thus , the horowitz - maeda argument does not rule out a scenario in which the black string breaks up into black holes at a finite time as measured by an asymptotic observer . if a singularity forms on the horizon , then the relationship between the affine parameter on the horizon and some asymptotic time is allowed to become singular .",
    "our purpose here is to note that such a scenario is a natural expectation based on the bounds derived by horowtiz and maeda .",
    "in particular , we show below that if _ i _ ) the decay of the radius follows ( [ hmbound ] ) for some @xmath4 , @xmath6 and _ ii _ ) the relationship between affine parameter and advanced time at infinity can be modeled on the familiar relationship for static black holes , then the advanced time remains finite at @xmath7 such a scenario would resolve an apparent tension between the results of @xcite and various investigations @xcite which together indicate that , at least in spacetime dimension @xmath8 , the only equilibrium final state to which the instability could lead is a set of separated black holes .",
    "this argument is given in section [ main ] below , after which we provide a brief discussion ( section [ disc ] ) .",
    "both @xcite and @xcite considered the fate of the schwarzschild black string in 4 + 1 dimensional einstein - hilbert gravity .",
    "this black string spacetime is the direct ( metric ) product of a spacelike real line with the 3 + 1 schwarzschild solution . in familiar coordinates ,",
    "the exterior is described by the line element : @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the line element on the unit two - sphere and @xmath0 is a constant giving the value of the area - radius @xmath11 at the horizon .",
    "are shown , along with the horizon @xmath12 .",
    "the affine parameter @xmath1 along @xmath12 and the advanced time @xmath13 along @xmath14 are indicated , and can be compared on ingoing null surfaces ( dotted lines ) .",
    "a similar retarded time @xmath15 can of course also be introduced along @xmath16.,width=226 ]    many salient features of this spacetime may be described by a two - dimensional conformal diagram similar to that associated with the schwarzschild black hole .",
    "figure 1 shows this diagram for a related spacetime where the black string forms from gravitaitonal collapse ( so that there is a regular center of the rotational symmetry ) .",
    "the diagram indicates the affine parameter @xmath1 along the horizon , as well as the advanced time @xmath13 along past null infinity .",
    "note that , while both @xmath1 and @xmath13 are defined as parameters along distinct null curves ( @xmath1 on the horizon and @xmath13 at infinity ) , either may naturally be taken to label the family of ingoing null surfaces ( dotted lines ) .",
    "similar parameters may be introduced in any static asymptotically flat spacetime where the time - translation has a killing horizon .",
    "if the horizon is non - degenerate one has @xcite @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the surface gravity of the timelike killing vector field . in the particular case of schwarzschild ( [ sbs ] ) , we have @xmath19    here we wish to consider the relationship between @xmath1 and @xmath13 for the dynamic spacetime that results from activating the gregory - laflamme instability @xcite of the schwarschild black string .",
    "in particular , we follow @xcite in considering a perturbation which has both @xmath20 rotation invariance around the black string and reflection symmetry about some hypersruface @xmath21 .",
    "thus , @xmath21 is a totally geodesic sub - manifold , and it is useful to draw a conformal diagram for this hypersurface even in our dynamic spacetime .",
    "furthermore , we can foliate the @xmath21 plane with null surfaces generated by radial null geodesics , much like the dotted lines shown in figure 1 for the static black string . thus ,",
    "in the @xmath21 plane it is again meaningful to compare the affine parameter @xmath1 along the horizon with the advanced time @xmath13 at infinity .",
    "we may also speak of the radius @xmath0 of the horizon at each @xmath1 ( equivalently , at each @xmath13 ) .",
    "the relationship between @xmath1 and @xmath13 may be quite complicated as there is no longer a time - translation symmetry . even on a null surface labeled by fixed @xmath1 and @xmath13",
    ", the spacetime will not match any static black string due to the presence of both non - vanishing derivatives and radiation .",
    "however , we are free to define an _ effective _ surface gravity @xmath22 such that a relation of the form ( [ rel ] ) continues to hold : @xmath23 this effective surface gravity will of course be a function of @xmath1 ( or , equivalently , a function of @xmath13 ) .",
    "as further motivation for this definition , let us recall that @xcite analyzed the dynamical black string simulation of @xcite and found that evolution even of quantities associated with the horizon was more naturally described in terms of @xmath24 than in terms of @xmath1 .    while we have no analytic control over @xmath22 , it is interesting to investigate the consequences of a plausible assumption : namely , that @xmath22 scales with @xmath0 in a manner similar to the relationship for static black holes .",
    "that is , we suppose that for schwarzschild black branes ( in any dimension ) we have @xmath25 for some @xmath26 . since horowitz and maeda noted that relations of the form ( [ hmbound ] ) with @xmath5 are consistent with their bounds , let us also suppose that such a relation holds .",
    "then , introducing @xmath27 we have @xmath28 integrating this relation and using @xmath29 we see that the advanced time @xmath13 asymptotes to a finite value as @xmath30 ( i.e. , as @xmath31 ) .",
    "we have considered a plausible assumption for the scaling of the effective surface gravity ( [ rel2 ] ) at the neck ( i.e. , the smallest sphere ) of the horizon of a dynamic black string . in particular , by assuming that it scales with the neck size @xmath0 in the same manner as the surface gravity of a static black string scales with the horizon size , we have shown that the bounds of horowitz and maeda @xcite naturally lead to a scenario in which the neck reaches zero size at finite advanced time . in this scenario ,",
    "such an event occurs only at _ infinite _ affine parameter along the horizon .",
    "however , we note that it is the advanced time which is more directly relevant to an asymptotic observer .",
    "in fact , it is plausible that any observer maintaining a finite separation from the horizon crosses the @xmath32 ingoing null surface at a finite proper time .",
    "as noted in @xcite , such a scenario would resolve the apparent tension between @xcite and detailed analytic and numerical investigations @xcite .",
    "while we have no direct argument for the above assumption , we note that similar results continue to hold under much weaker conditions .",
    "static schwarzschild black branes satisfy @xmath33 but to obtain the above conclusion it is sufficient that the effective surface gravity satisfy @xmath34 for any constant @xmath35 .",
    "thus , there is still room for the dynamic black string to differ significantly from the static black string without affecting the conclusion .    in practice",
    ", it will likely be left to numerical simulations to determine the asymptotic behavior of @xmath22 .",
    "an an initial step in this direction , let us consider the analysis of @xcite , using the data set of @xcite .",
    "their figure 1 shows what in our notation is @xmath36 vs. the advanced time @xmath13 , and from the plot it is clear that they find @xmath22 to increase over the range of the simulation .",
    "while the data set of @xcite does not appear to have sufficient resolution to test our conjecture in detail , this may prove to be a fruitful direction for future investigation .    even under the above scenario ,",
    "interesting questions remain with regard to the dynamics . in particular , while a bifurcation of the horizon requires a violation of the kaluza - klein generalization of strong future asymptotic predictability @xcite , a weaker notion of cosmic censorship ( such as a kaluza - klein generalization of just future asymptotic predictabiliity ) might perhaps continue to hold .",
    "the essential difference between the two asymptotic predictability criteria is that the strong version requires the cauchy surfaces to extend inside the horizon , whereas the other version only requires that the past of @xmath16 be globally hyperbolic .",
    "in addition we may note that , even if the bifurcation occurs at finite advanced time , this does not rule out the possibility that any singularity might occur only at infinite _ retarded time _ ( @xmath15 ) measured along @xmath16 .",
    "if this is the case , then @xmath16 would remain complete .",
