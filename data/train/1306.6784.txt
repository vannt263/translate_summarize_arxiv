    "_ palindromic closure _ of a finite word @xmath7 is the shortest palindrome having @xmath7 as a prefix .",
    "this concept was introduced in 1997 by aldo de luca for words over the binary alphabet . in @xcite",
    ", de luca showed that any standard sturmian word is a limit of a sequence of palindromes @xmath8 , where @xmath9 equals the empty word and @xmath10 is the palindromic closure of @xmath11 for some letter @xmath12 from the binary alphabet . and ,",
    "vice versa , the limit of such a sequence is always a standard sturmian word .",
    "this construction was extended to any finite alphabet @xmath13 by droubay , justin and pirillo in @xcite , and words arising by their construction are called _ standard episturmian words_. the sequence @xmath14 of letters that are added successively at each step is referred to as the _ directive sequence _ of the standard episturmian word .",
    "an important generalization of standard episturmian words appeared in @xcite , where the palindromic closure is replaced by _",
    "@xmath15-palindromic closure _ with @xmath15 an arbitrary involutory antimorphism of the free monoid @xmath16 .",
    "the corresponding words are called _ @xmath15-standard words _ , or _ pseudostandard words_.",
    "a further generalization was provided in 2008 by michelangelo bucci , aldo de luca , alessandro de luca , luca q. zamboni in @xcite , where the sequence @xmath8 is allowed to start with an arbitrary finite word @xmath9 , and the limit word is a _",
    "@xmath15-standard word with the seed @xmath9_. words obtained by these generalizations are in some sense quite similar to the standard episturmian words : by results of bucci and de luca @xcite , any @xmath15-standard word with a seed is a morphic image of a standard episturmian word .    the described constructions of @xmath8 guarantee that the language of a standard episturmian word contains infinitely many palindromes .",
    "droubay , justin and pirillo in @xcite deduced that any finite word @xmath7 contains at most @xmath17 distinct palindromes ( @xmath18 stands for the length of @xmath7 ) .",
    "a word @xmath7 with exactly @xmath19 palindromes is called _ rich _ ( in @xcite ) , or _ full _ ( in @xcite ) .",
    "an infinite word is _ rich _ if every finite factor of this word is rich .",
    "examples of rich words include all episturmian words , see @xcite , two interval coding of rotations , see @xcite , words coding interval exchange transformation with symmetric permutation , see @xcite , etc .",
    "the notion of rich word was generalized as well : the concept of _ @xmath15-rich _ word was introduced in @xcite .",
    "a @xmath15-rich word is saturated by _",
    "@xmath15-palindromes _ , fixed points of the involutory antimorphism @xmath15 , up to the highest possible level .",
    "another generalization of the concept of richness is a measure of how many palindromes are missing in a certain sense .",
    "this quantity is called the _ palindromic defect _ and it was first considered in @xcite .",
    "analogously to standard episturmian words , one can prove that every @xmath15-standard word is @xmath15-rich , and every standard word with seed has finite palindromic defect .",
    "again , both generalizations of rich words are not too far from the original notion .",
    "in particular , any uniformly recurrent @xmath15-rich word and any uniformly recurrent word with finite defect is just a morphic image of a rich word , see @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , the operation of palindromic closure enables us to construct a big class of rich words .    up to this point , we were concerned with properties of words with respect to one fixed involutory antimorphism @xmath15 on @xmath16 .    in the last section of the paper",
    "@xcite , de luca and de luca introduced an even more general concept - generalized pseudostandard words .",
    "they considered a set @xmath20 of involutory antimorphisms over @xmath16 and beside a directive sequence @xmath21 of letters from @xmath13 , also a directive sequence of antimorphisms @xmath22 from @xmath20 .",
    "the construction of @xmath8 starts with the empty word @xmath9 and recursively , @xmath23 is the @xmath24-palindromic closure of @xmath25 .    then de luca and de luca focused on the prominent thue ",
    "morse word @xmath26 .",
    "they showed that @xmath26 is a generalized pseudostandard word with the directive sequences @xmath27 and @xmath28 , where @xmath29 denotes the mirror image operator , and @xmath30 the antimorphism which exchanges the letters @xmath31 .",
    "the example of the thue ",
    "morse word illustrates that generalized pseudostandard words substantially differ from the previous notions where only one antimorphism is used .",
    "this is due to the fact that the thue ",
    "morse word is not a morphic image of a standard episturmian word as all @xmath15-standard words are .",
    "this can be seen when comparing the factor complexities of a standard episturmian word , which is of the form @xmath32 except for finitely many integers @xmath33 ( see @xcite ) , and the factor complexity of the thue ",
    "morse word ( see @xcite or @xcite ) .    the results of @xcite confirm that the notion of the generalized pseudostandard word is very fruitful . in particular , blondin - mass , paquin , tremblay , and vuillon showed that any standard rote word is a generalized pseudostandard word .",
    "since the rote words are defined over the binary alphabet , their directive sequences @xmath34 contain antimorphisms @xmath29 and @xmath30 only .    in this article",
    "we focus on the so - called generalized thue ",

    "as shown in @xcite , the language of @xmath3 is closed under a finite group containing @xmath36 involutory antimorphisms .",
    "this group is isomorphic to the dihedral group @xmath44 .",
    "our aim in this paper is to prove the following theorem :    [ main ] the generalized thue ",
    "morse word @xmath3 is a generalized pseudostandard word if and only if   @xmath45  or   @xmath46 .",
    "unlike the case of the standard words with seed , very little is known about the properties of generalized pseudostandard words . in the last section ,",
    "we propose several questions the answering of which would bring a better understanding of the structure of such words .",
    "our motivation for the study of generalized pseudostandard words stems from a desire to find @xmath47-rich words recently introduced in @xcite .",
    "words that are rich in the original sense are @xmath47-rich with respect to @xmath48 . in @xcite",

    ", one can also show that the rote words are @xmath49-rich ( for definition of the rote words see @xcite ) .",
