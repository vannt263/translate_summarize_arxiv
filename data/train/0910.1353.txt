    "but , despite its many phenomenological successes , the microphysical origin of inflation remains unclear ; indeed , ever since its inception , it has been a challenge to derive successful inflationary models from fundamental particle physics  @xcite .",

    "the speed of sound can be significantly smaller than unity . because cosmological perturbations travel at speeds less than that of light in these models ,",

    "- gaussianity is an additional observable providing new information that can be used to distinguish between certain inflationary models .",
    "it is the nature of quantum field theory in curved spacetime that scalar fields generically couple non - minimally to gravity  @xcite . in this paper",
    "we study effects of gravitational couplings in inflationary models with non - standard kinetic terms .",
    "in particular , we are interested in determining how such couplings alter cosmological observables .",
    "our goal is to determine if it is possible to probe such couplings using measurements of non - gaussianity together with measurements of other standard physical quantities .",
    "we ultimately focus on the theoretically well - motivated setting of a non - minimally coupled inflaton field in a dbi inflationary model ; however , the methods we develop are applicable to more general settings as discussed below .",
    "an outline of the paper is as follows : in  [ motive ] , we provide a brief introduction to gravitational couplings in theories with non - standard kinetic terms and dbi models of d - brane inflation . in  [ analytic ] , we derive analytic expectations for the observables of canonical and non - canonical models with conformal coupling . in  [ discrim ] , we discuss the prospects of observationally discriminating between pure dbi theories and dbi theory with a conformal coupling term . in  [ monte ] , we describe the priors and general methodology used in our monte - carlo simulations . in ",

    ", a particularly well - motivated instance of non - standard kinetic term occurs in d - brane inflation : the inflaton kinetic term is of the dirac - born - infeld ( dbi ) form  @xcite : [ pdbi ] p(x , ) = - f^-1 ( ) + f^-1 ( ) - v ( ) , where the warp factor @xmath4 is related to the harmonic function of a warped compactification .",
    "the non - standard form of the kinetic lagrangian imposes an effective speed limit on the inflaton field , analogous to the speed limit imposed on particle motion in special relativity .",
    "this behavior results in a new form of slow - roll inflation even when the potential is very steep @xcite .",
    "the most well studied d - brane inflation scenario consists of a brane anti - brane pair embedded in the warped throat region of a conformally calabi - yau flux compactification in type iib string theory .",
    "the warping can be used to obtain a large hierarchy in scales between the electroweak and planck scales .",
