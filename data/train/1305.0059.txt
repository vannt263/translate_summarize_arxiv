    "periodic orbits have been at core of much of the mathematical work on the theory of the classical and quantum dynamical systems .",
    "one of the primary motivations to consider periodic orbits in quantum chaos stems from their role as a bridge between two theories . in the semiclassical limit",
    "spectral density of chaotic hamiltonian systems can be expressed by the gutzwiller trace formula through the sum over periodic orbits @xmath2 , where each term is determined by the stability and the action of @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "straightforwardly , this implies that spectral correlations between energy levels of quantum chaotic systems must be related to correlations between actions of periodic orbits .",
    "this remarkable connection has been fruitfully employed in a last decade to deduce universal features of quantum spectrum in chaotic systems described by random matrix theory @xcite .    on a heuristic level",
    ", the action correlation mechanism can be understood in the following way .",
    "a generic long periodic orbit in a chaotic system has a number of _ encounters _ where it closely approaches itself in the phase space .",
    "it can be shown that for any such orbit there exist partner orbits following approximately the same path but in a different time - order .",
    "the switches in the direction of motion occur at the encounters , see fig .",
    "[ graphs]a .",
    "these periodic orbits form families , or _ clusters",
    "_ as we refer to them hereafter .",
    "all members of the cluster traverse through approximately the same points of the configuration space and , therefore , have close actions . moreover , if the time reversal symmetry is broken the orbits from the same cluster must be close to each other also in the phase space of the system .",
    "the clustering phenomenon can be rigorously described using symbolic dynamics . assuming that dynamical system allows a finite markov partition any periodic orbit can be represented as a cyclic sequence of symbols from certain alphabet @xcite : @xmath3 to simplify the treatment",
    ", we will assume in this paper the simplest possible symbolic dynamics  alphabet of two symbols @xmath4 with any sequence allowed by the trivial grammar rules .",
    "such symbolic dynamics appears for instance in baker s map @xcite .",
    "two periodic orbits from the same cluster induce two sequences @xmath5 , @xmath6 with the property , that each subsequence of @xmath1 consecutive symbols in @xmath5 appears the same number of times in @xmath6 , and vice versa .",
    "accordingly , all periodic orbits can be arranged into a number of clusters .",
    "it is straightforward to see by the above definition that two periodic orbits from the same cluster are separated by metric distances of the order @xmath7 in the phase space @xcite .",
    "consequently , the number @xmath1 controls the differences between their actions .    in chaotic systems",
    "the number of periodic orbits grows exponentially with their length .",
    "because of this , there are in general many periodic orbits with close actions which belong to different clusters .",
    "nevertheless , clustering phenomenon plays very important role in quantum chaos . due to their topological nature",
    "the action correlations between orbits within the same cluster are rigid .",
    "namely , periodic orbits from the same clusters keep their action differences small also under small perturbation of the system .",
    "it can be expected that the only systematic contribution into spectral correlations comes from such orbits . taking this into account it seems to be a natural and important question to ask what is the distribution of cluster sizes for given @xmath1 and @xmath0 .",
    "note that in a nutshell this is a purely combinatorial problem , as we need to count the number of sequences of length @xmath0 satisfying certain constraint .      the cluster distribution can be studied through @xmath8-th moments : @xmath9 where the sum runs over all clusters and @xmath10 is the number of periodic orbits in the cluster @xmath11 .",
    "it worth noting that the first momentum @xmath12 provides just the total number of periodic orbits of the period @xmath0 , whose asymptotics for the baker s map is given by @xmath13 . in this paper the consideration will be restricted to the second moment @xmath14 .",
    "the ratio @xmath15 then can be used as a measure of the average cluster size .    as can be easily understood",
    "the asymptotic behavior of @xmath14 for long orbits crucially depends on the interplay between parameters @xmath1 and @xmath0 . in our previous work @xcite and related studies @xcite the long trajectory limit @xmath16 , with @xmath1 being fixed",
    "was considered .",
    "note however , that in a proper semiclassical limit the parameters @xmath17 are related to each other .",
    "indeed , the spectral correlations on the scale of mean level spacing @xmath18 are determined by periodic orbits with the periods of the order of the _ heisenberg time _ @xmath19 .",
    "for two - dimensional systems this time scale is proportional to the inverse planck s constant @xmath20 . on the other hand ,",
    "the action differences between correlating orbits must be of the order of planck s constant .",
    "since action differences and periods of orbits are controlled by @xmath1 and @xmath0 respectively , in a semiclassical regime both parameters must tend to infinity .",
    "the main focus of the present paper is on the limit : @xmath21 , where @xmath22 is a fixed parameter and @xmath23 .",
    "speaking informally , this regime can be interpreted as the limit where the average number of encounters in periodic orbits is fixed .",
    "this is so , since for long periodic orbits with @xmath24 the number of encounters is proportional to @xmath25 .",
    "note that this regime is essentially different from the aforementioned semiclassical limit needed for the evaluation of spectral correlation on the scale of mean level spacing . in the last case @xmath26 and",
    "the number of encounters in periodic orbits tends to infinity .",
    "the central idea of our approach is to represent @xmath14 through the spectral form factor of an ensemble of truncated @xmath27 unitary matrices .",
    "as we show , the relevant spectral information necessary for evaluation of @xmath14 depends on the relationship between @xmath0 and @xmath28 . in the semiclassical regime @xmath26 the asymptotic form of @xmath14 is determined solely by the distribution of the largest eigenvalue in the ensemble of random matrices . on the contrary , in the regime",
    "@xmath29 the relevant information arrives from the edge of the spectrum , where both eigenvalues distribution and their correlations are of importance . remarkably , the density and correlations of eigenvalues at the @xmath30 vicinity of the spectral edge exhibit universal properties .",
    "this observation allows us to obtain asymptotics of @xmath14 and estimate  average ",
    "cluster size @xmath31 analytically .",
    "+ the paper is structured as follows : in sec .",
    "2 we relate function @xmath14 to the spectral form factor of an ensemble of truncated @xmath27 unitary matrices .",
    "we then analyze the spectrum of these matrices in sec .",
    "we demonstrate numerically that at the edge of the spectrum a universality of eigenvalue distribution holds .",
    "this universal behavior is then analyzed in sec .",
    "4 using circular ensemble of truncated unitary ( cue ) matrices with the standard invariant measure . for these ensembles",
    "we analytically derive asymptotics of the spectral form factor in the regime @xmath29 . in sec .",
    "5 we exploit these results in order to obtain asymptotics of @xmath14 and consider implications for the average size of clusters .",
    "discussion of different regimes along with open questions for further research are put in sec .",
    "as a first step , we show below that the problem of finding cluster sizes is equivalent to the one of counting closed paths of the same length on a special class of graphs @xmath32 .",
    "specifically , for the symbolic dynamics of backer s map @xmath32 happen to be famous _ de bruijn graphs_.      let @xmath33 be the set of all possible sequences of zeroes and ones having the length @xmath34 .",
    "the graph @xmath32 is constructed in the following way .",
    "first , with each sequence @xmath35\\in x_{p-1}$ ] we associate a vertex of @xmath32 .",
    "second , a sequence @xmath36 $ ] , @xmath37 defines the directed edge @xmath38 of @xmath32 which connects vertex @xmath35 $ ] to the vertex @xmath39 $ ] .",
    "thus the total number of edges is @xmath40 and each vertex has two incoming and two outcoming edges , see fig .",
    "[ graphs]b .",
    "it is worth mentioning that the resulting graphs @xmath32 are actually well known in the literature .",
    "these are so - called de bruijn graphs , first introduced in @xcite .",
    "a ) 1.2 cm b )    it is straightforward to see that any closed path @xmath41 on the graph @xmath32 passing through @xmath0 edges can be uniquely represented by a cyclic sequence @xmath42 . by such identification",
    "each edge of @xmath32 traversed by @xmath41 corresponds to a certain segment @xmath43 $ ] of the sequence @xmath5 .",
    "let @xmath44 denote a set of integers , such that @xmath45 is the number of times the path @xmath41 passes through the edge @xmath46 .",
    "correspondingly @xmath47 is the length of the path .",
    "then two sequences @xmath48 , belong to the same cluster if and only if @xmath49 .",
    "equivalently , @xmath50 are in the same cluster if @xmath41 and @xmath51 traverse edges of @xmath32 the same number of times ( which can be also zero ) . as a result ,",
    "each cluster of periodic orbits can be unambiguously labeled by the vector of integers @xmath52 . keeping this in mind",
    "we introduce notation @xmath53 for the cluster of periodic orbits corresponding to vector @xmath54 and aim to find asymptotics of : @xmath55    [ remark ] by attaching incommensurate `` lengths '' to edges of the graph @xmath32 one can turn it into a metric graph .",
    "then each @xmath53 can be seen as a cluster of closed paths with equal lengths .",
    "accordingly , counting of cluster sizes is equivalent to counting of degeneracies in the length spectrum of the corresponding metric graph .",
    "the last problem has been studied in @xcite for some classes of metric graphs .",
    "rather then consider @xmath14 directly it turns out to be convenient to introduce a slightly different function .",
    "recall that each periodic orbit is uniquely identified by a sequence of symbols up to a cyclic shift .",
    "this means all @xmath0 sequences : @xmath56\\in x_n , \\qquad i=1,\\dots n\\ ] ] correspond to one and the same periodic orbit @xmath41 . for _ prime _ periodic orbits , which have no repetitions all these sequences are different . on the other hand for periodic orbits with repetitions some of the above sequences",

    "we define the following functions : @xmath59 where @xmath60 is the number of sequences in @xmath57 . for prime periodic orbits",

    "we introduce the connectivity matrix @xmath63 between edges of the graph and the auxiliary diagonal matrix @xmath64 :    @xmath65    the dimensions of these matrices are @xmath66 , with @xmath67 .",
    "the usefulness of introduction of matrices @xmath63 and @xmath68 is seen from the relation connecting traces of their powers with the sizes of the clusters @xmath57 : @xmath69 where the first sum runs over all clusters @xmath57 .",

    "<S> periodic orbits in chaotic systems form clusters , whose elements traverse approximately the same points of the phase space . </S>",
    "<S> the distribution of cluster sizes depends on the length @xmath0 of orbits and the parameter @xmath1 which controls closeness of orbits actions . </S>",
    "<S> we show that counting of cluster sizes in the baker s map can be turned into a spectral problem for an ensemble of truncated unitary matrices . based on the conjecture of the universality for the eigenvalues distribution at the spectral edge of these ensembles , </S>",
    "<S> we obtain asymptotics of the second moment of cluster distribution in a regime where both @xmath0 and @xmath1 tend to infinity . </S>",
    "<S> this result allows us to estimate the average cluster size as a function of the number of encounters in periodic orbits . </S>"
