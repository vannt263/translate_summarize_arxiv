    "we use the analogies found in nature and introduce a non  feedback model of entrainment in a system of coupled nonlinear oscillators . our model might help to elucidate the basic underlying mechanisms that regulate synchronization of processes in a real biosystem .",
    "although simplified low  dimensional models can capture inherent mechanisms leading to synchronization , quite often it happens that spatial dynamics plays a crucial role in mediating synchronization  @xcite in a given system . to unveil the whole variety of possible synchronization scenarios one has to introduce a spatial dimension in the mathematical model of a biosystem .",

    "for instance , models of self  oscillatory systems are widely used to describe biochemical pattern formation processes in spatially extended systems  @xcite .",
    "it is well known that the complex spatiotemporal behavior in a system is largely determined by its dynamical instabilities .",
    "there are two basic approaches that are used for numerical and analytical studies of stability in spatially extended systems subjected to external forcing .",
    "the first approach implements the mathematical framework provided by the complex ginzburg  landau equation ( cgle )  @xcite . in this case",
    "the description of an oscillatory medium is reduced to the study of the amplitude equation with a periodic forcing .",
    "different types of periodic forcing of the cgle and a rich set of dynamical states and their bifurcations have been studied in  @xcite .",
    "the second approach uses a description of system spatiotemporal dynamics in terms of a large populations of coupled oscillators .",

    "we describe the mechanism of entrainment of the frequency of system solutions to the stimulation frequency .",
    "the essential feature of the described non  feedback mechanism of entrainment is that the external stimulation enters in the model as a parametric modulation .",
    "two types of parametric excitations are treated : the first type is the periodic modulation of the inertial oscillator stiffness ; the second type is the peridic excitation of a natural frequency of a self  oscillatory element .",
    "we show that the synchronization scenarios are ruled not only by the choice of parameters of the excitation force but depend on the initial collective state in the ensemble . for both types of the periodic excitations entrainment behavior",
