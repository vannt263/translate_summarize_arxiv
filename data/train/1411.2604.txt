    "both pointings were centered at ( @xmath12 ) = 348.49384@xmath13 , -42.7251@xmath13 , which provided overlap with the full extent of the complex h@xmath6 emission presented in @xcite .",
    "the choice of two far - uv filters was made for two reasons .",
    "first , the use of two filters allows us to remove the known acs / sbc red leak , which has a non - negligible contribution due to the fact that the underlying bcg is very red and luminous .",
    "since both f140lp and f150lp are long - pass filters , they have approximately the same throughput at @xmath141500 .",
    "thus , the difference of these two filters yields a narrow effective bandpass from 14001500 , which is free from any red leak emission . secondly ,",
    "as we show in figure [ fig : uvfiltesr ] , this narrow bandpass is free of contamination from bright uv emission lines such as ly@xmath6 , civ , and heii .",
    "thus , we can conclude that any emission in the differenced image is most likely due to uv continuum .    following the differencing of the f140lp and f150lp images ,",

    "the final processed ( differenced , binned , smoothed ) image is shown in figure [ fig : imtile ] , compared to imaging at a variety of other wavelengths .",

    "the uv peak is offset by @xmath05kpc to the south of the central galaxy .",
    "this offset may be due to the fact that the dust emission peaks on the central galaxy , which may be obscuring much of the uv emission at this position .",
    "figure [ fig : core ] highlights the h@xmath6-free uv emission to the south , with two distinct filaments extending radially in this direction ( figure [ fig : core ] ) .",
    "these short , h@xmath6-free filaments are similar to what we observe north of the central galaxy in abell  1795 . both of these clusters have extended filaments of mixed h@xmath6 and uv emission in one direction , with `` bare '' uv filaments in the counter direction .",
    "this may indicate that recently - formed stars have fallen back onto the central galaxy , with the stars over - shooting the galaxy and the gas accumulating in the center .",
    "given the freefall time at the entropy minimum ( @xmath040 myr ) , the youngest stars that make it to the galaxy center ought to be b stars , which may be another explanation for the lack of h@xmath6 emission .",
    "to the east , the uv emission is relatively diffuse and has a similar morphology to the old stellar population ( see figure [ fig : imtile ] ) .",
    "however , the fact that this emission is not symmetric around the center suggests that this is not uv emission from old stars ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , but rather diffuse emission from a young stellar population .    /uv",
    "sfr map of emission around the central galaxy in srsic  159 - 03 , where we assume that all h@xmath6 and uv ( f140lp band ) emission can be traced to young stars .",
    "assuming that variations in this ratio are due to stellar ages ( with young stellar populations having a larger fraction of ionizing o stars ) , this figure suggests that filaments to the north and west of the central galaxy are sites of ongoing star formation .",
    "the h@xmath6/uv distribution peaks to the north of the central galaxy , coincident in position with the lowest entropy x - ray emitting plasma .",
    "the white contours show the extent of the uv emission ( see also figure [ fig : imtile]).,scaledwidth=49.0% ]        in table [ table : sfrs ] we show the integrated uv flux in the f140lp passband for various morphologically - defined regions .",
    "the total uv flux in this system is 5.9 @xmath20 0.09 @xmath1810@xmath21 erg s@xmath2 @xmath22 hz@xmath2 .",
    "assuming no intrinsic extinction and that all of the uv flux comes from young stars , this corresponds to a star formation rate ( sfr ) of 0.66 m@xmath23 yr@xmath2 , following @xcite .",
    "this is most likely an underestimate of the total sfr , given that we measure significant reddening via optical spectroscopy @xcite and ir continuum emission ( figure [ fig : imtile ] ) .",
    "assuming an empirically - calibrated relation between intrinsic extinction and uv luminosity @xcite , we estimate an extinction - corrected star formation rate of @xmath24 m@xmath23 yr@xmath2 .",
    "this is slightly higher than the h@xmath6-derived star formation rate of @xmath01 m@xmath23 yr@xmath2 , where we have again assumed that the h@xmath6 flux is entirely due to photo - ionization by young stars .",
    "this difference may be , in part , due to the narrow bandpass of the mmtf ",
    "@xcite quote an h@xmath6 flux 35% higher than our measured value , using a wider bandpass .",
    "unfortunately , this wider bandpass is contaminated by emission from the [ nii ] doublet , meaning that the true h@xmath6 flux most likely lies somewhere between these two measurements .",
    "we measure a broad range of uv / h@xmath6 ratios across the full extent of the central galaxy , suggesting that simple continuous star formation is insufficient to explain the uv and h@xmath6 morphologies . to the west and southeast of the galaxy center",
    ", there is a dearth of h@xmath6 emission .",
    "this can not be explained by extinction or by including an additional source of ionization .",
    "the likely explanation is that the stellar populations in these regions are older than in the more extended filaments .",
    "if we carry this explanation further and assume that the h@xmath6/uv ratio probes the age of the young stars  where recently - formed stars have an abundance of ionizing o stars , and older stellar populations have their uv flux dominated by weakly - ionizing b stars  we can make a pseudo - age map by simply dividing these two images .",
    "this is demonstrated in figure [ fig : uvha ] .",
    "we find that the h@xmath6/uv ratio peaks to the north of the central galaxy , precisely where the icm entropy is minimized .",
    "given that the ir emission is relatively faint at this position ( see figure [ fig : imtile ] ) , we expect that this high ratio is not a result of intrinsic extinction . instead",
    ", we propose that this northern region , along with the bright western filament , are sites of ongoing star formation . in contrast",
    ", the southern and western regions have low h@xmath6/uv ratios , suggesting an older stellar population .",
    "we will return to this discussion of stellar ages in  4 .      in figure [",
    "fig : imtile ] we show that the 250@xmath16 m emission peaks on the central cluster galaxy and extends to the northwest , out to the maximum extent of the h@xmath6 filaments . in figure",
    "[ fig : ir ] we show that this dust emission is present at all wavelengths @xmath2524@xmath16 m , while the central galaxy is brightest at @xmath26250@xmath16 m .",
    "modeling and subtracting emission from three nearby point sources , we can isolate the extended dust emission .",
    "this emission is peaked just north of the h@xmath6 filament .",
    "the brightness of this dust at such long wavelengths suggests that it is cold ( @xmath012k ; see  3.3 ) , if it is located at the distance of srsic  159 - 03 .",
    "the amount of dust in the extended region to the north and northeast is sufficient to prevent the detection of any uv emission from this region , perhaps explaining why the uv emission is not as extended in this direction as the h@xmath6 emission .",
    "the relative lack of extended emission at shorter wavelengths suggests that the dust to the north of the galaxy is significantly cooler than that in the center .",
    "this is confirmed in figure [ fig : irsed ] , which shows the ir spectral energy distributions ( seds ) for the core emission ( centered on the bcg ) and the extended emission to the north of the central galaxy .",
    "a pair of modified blackbody models were fit to these seds , assuming @xmath27 and normalizing the absorption cross section to @xmath28(250@xmath16 m ) = 4.0 @xmath29 g@xmath2 @xcite .",
    "we note that this normalization term is known to be quite uncertain ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in the inner @xmath020kpc ,",
    "the dust has a mix of temperatures with a total dust mass of @xmath010@xmath3 m@xmath23 .",
    "the majority of the flux comes from a cool 20k component , likely associated with the star formation in the central galaxy . a second , warmer ( 54k ) ,",
    "component in the core is likely attributed to the central agn .",
    "these two dust temperatures are consistent with typical values for star - forming galaxies and central agn ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the extended emission originates predominantly from cold dust ( 12k ) , with m@xmath30m@xmath23 .",
    "interestingly , this suggests that the vast majority of the dust , by mass , is at large radii ( @xmath1430kpc ) .",
    "the total dust mass in this system is similar to that observed in abell1068 and zw3146 @xcite , despite the fact that these clusters have star formation rates more than a factor of ten times higher than that measured in the center of srsic  159 - 03 .",
    "we measure a small secondary peak at @xmath060k , suggesting that some of the dust in this cloud is being heated , perhaps by interaction with the icm .    considering only the cool dust in the central region , where we see evidence for star formation",

    "the total infrared luminosity from cool dust in the extended region is l@xmath32 l@xmath23 , suggesting that there may be an additional @xmath01 m@xmath23 yr@xmath2 in obscured star formation in the extended northern filament .",
    "figure [ fig : imtile ] demonstrates that [ cii ] 157@xmath16 m emission is present along the full extent of the uv / h@xmath6 filaments , suggesting that there is a substantial amount of cold ( @xmath0100k ) gas in the core of srsic  159 - 03 . similar to the uv emission , the cool gas is significantly more extended to the south and west of the central galaxy than the h@xmath6 emission .",

    "the kinematics of the cold gas appear consistent with those of the warm molecular @xcite and ionized @xcite gas .",
    "the velocity dispersion peaks at a value of @xmath0200 km s@xmath2 toward the galaxy center , dropping to @xmath0100 km s@xmath2 in the more extended filaments .",
    "there is very little variation in the line - of - sight velocity along the extended filaments ( @xmath37 @xmath0 50 km s@xmath2 ) , suggesting that the filaments lie ( primarily ) in the plane of the sky .",
    "below , we discuss possible interpretations of the uv , ir , and [ cii]157@xmath16 m emission presented in  3 .",
    "this is , by no means , an exhaustive list of possible contributing sources , but is meant to provide a broad , coherent picture of what may be occurring in the core of srsic  159 - 03 .      in  3 and",
    "previous works @xcite we show significant evidence for star formation in the central galaxy of srsic  159 - 03 . the measured star formation rate of @xmath013 m@xmath23 yr@xmath2 ( derived from uv , h@xmath6 , far - ir , and [ cii ] ) is concentrated in the center of the galaxy , but extends in all directions for @xmath01015kpc and to the north for @xmath035kpc .",
    "@xcite showed that the extended northern filament is coincident with an offset cool core , suggesting that star formation may be triggered by whatever process has dislodged the cool core from the minimum of the gravitational potential .",
    "sloshing of the cool core following an interaction with another massive system is the most common explanation for offset cool cores ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the large - scale x - ray emission of the icm is , however , extremely smooth in this system @xcite , with no obvious indications of sloshing ( i.e. , cold fronts , spiral structure , asymmetric isophotes ) .",
    "an alternative explanation , for which there is some evidence , is that a burst of radio - mode feedback has dislodged the cool core to the north .",
    "this hypothesis is consistent with the direction of the radio jet ( figure [ fig : imtile ] ) which is aligned along the north - south direction . following the strategy described in @xcite",
    ", we can estimate whether or not the current agn power is sufficient to displace the cool core . requiring an energy outburst of @xmath38 to remove the cool core yields an estimate of @xmath39 erg s@xmath2 , assuming a timescale of 10@xmath40 yr ( @xmath41 s ) , a cool core radius of 30kpc ( @xmath42 @xmath43 ) , and a core pressure of 0.012 kev @xmath44 ( @xmath45 erg @xmath44 ; * ? ? ?",
    "following @xcite , and using the measured 1.4ghz luminosity of @xmath46 erg s@xmath2 hz@xmath2 @xcite , we estimate a mechanical power of @xmath010@xmath47erg s@xmath2 from the radio - loud agn .",
    "thus , it appears that the current outburst of agn feedback is sufficient , both in power and direction , to displace the cool core to its current , observed position .    in this scenario ,",
    "the hot gas is displaced most easily by the radio - mode feedback  the molecular gas , warm gas , and dust are not as easily pushed around by the agn jets .",
    "we speculate then that the filaments of young stars and ionized gas are , instead , due to recent star formation as the cool core moves from the center to the north  not unlike a passing raincloud leaving everything in its path wet .",
    "@xcite estimate that the age of the extended filament is @xmath010@xmath40  yr . removed from the direct influence of the central agn , and compressed by the agn jets / lobes , the displaced cool core should cool rapidly .",
    "this scenario is corroborated by the peak in the h@xmath6/uv ratio at _ precisely _ the location of the entropy minimum .",
    "this seems to indicate that the youngest , strongly - ionizing o stars are located at the entropy minimum , _ regardless of whether or not that minimum lies in the cluster center_. there are , of course , other possible explanations for a high h@xmath6/uv ratio .",
    "reddening due to dust would reduce the observed uv flux considerably more so than the h@xmath6 flux .",
    "however , both the dust map ( figure [ fig : ir ] ) and the reddening map @xcite show minimal dust at the position of the entropy minimum .",
    "alternatively , the h@xmath6/uv ratio could be increased by including a secondary ionization source such as shocks ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , particle heating ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , or mixing with the hot icm ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "we note that both the [ oi]/h@xmath6 ratio and the velocity dispersion are minimized at the position of the entropy minimum , suggesting that turbulent mixing and/or shocks are probably not strong contributors . given that the spectral signatures of cooling and mixing are , for the most part , indistinguishable , it is difficult to rule out the possibility that the h@xmath6 may peak due to the cooling enhancement at this position . in either case ( cooling , mixing , star formation ) , the h@xmath6/uv peak appears to be signaling the presence of rapid cooling at the position of the entropy minimum , leading to the formation of the stars in the northern filament .",
    "following these same lines of arguments , the low values of the h@xmath6/uv ratio in the center , south , and western regions would indicate that the stars here are slightly older .",
    "these stars were likely formed when the cool core was still centered on the bcg , and the cooling / feedback loop was closed .",
    "the recent burst of agn feedback has disrupted this loop , halting star formation in the central regions and relocating it to the northern filament .",
    "star formation from extended filaments produced by agn uplift may contribute significantly to the formation of the outer stellar haloes and massive star - clusters surrounding cd galaxies @xcite .",
    "about 10% of the observed uv emission in the northern filament of srsic  159 - 03 comes from a single massive , young star cluster ( see figure [ fig : core ] ) .",
    "this is consistent with the star forming filaments in the outskirts of the perseus cluster , where 10% of the young star light is in star - clusters @xcite .",
    "shock heating and compressing the cold gas by a galaxy falling through the core of the cluster might also have triggered and enhanced the star formation rate in the filament ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "optical images of the cluster core show a pair of small , perturbed galaxies @xmath03040  kpc northeast of the cd galaxy ( see figure [ fig : fors1 ] ) .",
    "it is unclear whether either of these galaxies are cluster members ( we lack redshift information ) , although their apparent size and magnitude are appropriate given the distance to sersic  159 - 03 .",
    "if these galaxies passed through the cluster core ( the core passage would have occurred @xmath060  myr ago ) they might have interacted with the cold gas in the cluster center , triggering some of the observed star formation and contributing to the disturbed distribution of the cold gas .",
    "further , some of the warm , ionized gas , specifically in the northeast filament , may have been stripped from the satellite galaxy during this interaction .",
    "given the morphology of the bulk of the h@xmath6 and uv emission ( corresponding well with the x - ray morphology ) , we do not expect that a significant fraction of the gas or stars were stripped from these galaxies , but their passage may aid in the triggering of star formation and the `` stretching out '' of additional filaments via tidal interactions .",
    "we find a significant amount of extended , cold dust to the north of the central galaxy in srsic  159 - 03 ( figure [ fig : ir ] ) .",
    "this massive ( 10@xmath40 m@xmath23 yr@xmath2 ) cloud of cold ( 12k ) dust extends to the north of the central galaxy for @xmath1430kpc , making it the most extended complex of dust yet found in a cool core cluster .",
    "if truly associated with the star - forming filaments , it suggests that these filaments extend further to the north than is observed , and would explain why the uv emission is less extended than the h@xmath6 emission .",
    "there is , however , the possibility that this dust is associated with background galaxies , in an unfortunate alignment with both the central galaxy and the extended filament .    attributing this dust to background galaxies would help alleviate the issue of sustaining such a large quantity of cold dust surrounded by hot intracluster gas .",
    "deep optical imaging along the 250@xmath16 m filament reveals three galaxies which may be contributing to the ir flux ( figure [ fig : fors1 ] ) and are coincident with peaks in the extended northern filament .",
    "emission from these sources were subtracted and removed ( see figure [ fig : ir ] ) . in the residual ir peak , highlighted in figure [ fig : fors1 ] , we see no evidence for background galaxies .",
    "this would , conservatively , put a lower limit of @xmath48 on 0.1l@xmath49 galaxies that may be contributing to the cold dust peak to the north of the central galaxy in sersic  159 - 03 .",
    "if this ir emission did , indeed , come from galaxies at @xmath50 it would imply l@xmath51 l@xmath23 , which is a factor of @xmath010 times larger than the typical luminosity of an `` ultraluminous infrared galaxy '' @xcite .",
    "m emission , green contours show h@xmath6 emission , and blue circles show 24@xmath16 m sources which we have subtracted in our analysis . in the lower panel",
    "we zoom in and center on the cold dust peak to the north of the central galaxy , showing a lack of background galaxies that could be contributing to this flux.,scaledwidth=45.0% ]    in the absence of an alternative , viable explanation for the source of the dust , we conclude that it is most likely associated with the northern star - forming filament .",
    "it is unclear how dust this cold ( 12k ) can avoid being heated by the hot icm , but the fact that we see a warm ( 60k ) component in the extended emission suggests that the dust cloud may be in the process of heating up along the outer surface .",
    "future observations with alma will allow us to both confirm that the dust is indeed linked to the cooling filament , and look for cold molecular gas along its full extent .",
    "cooling and star formation in the cores of clusters of galaxies appear to be regulated by feedback from the central agn . here , we studied the properties of the dusty , filamentary cold gas and star formation in the core of the galaxy cluster srsic 159 - 03 using new fuv images from hst and fir data from _ herschel _ , along with a wealth of archival data .",
    "we find :    * extended , filamentary and clumpy uv emission , indicating a star formation rate of @xmath523  @xmath53  yr@xmath2 and an abundance ( @xmath54 ) of cold ( 20  k ) dust in the center of the cluster .",
    "the morphology of the uv , h@xmath6 , [ cii ] , and ir emission are all broadly consistent with one another . *",
    "the most recently formed stars , indicated by the peak h@xmath6/uv ratio , are spatially coincident with the lowest entropy icm , that has been displaced by the agn @xmath07.5kpc north of the center of the cd galaxy .",
    "this suggests that the displacement of the cooling core from the direct vicinity of the central agn can temporarily break the feedback cycle and lead to cooling and star formation that is offset from the center of the galaxy . *",
    "extended fir continuum emission is observed north to north - east of the central galaxy .",
    "if this fir emission is located at the distance of the cluster then this implies that large amounts ( @xmath010@xmath40m@xmath4 ) of cold ( 12k ) dust may be associated with the h@xmath6 filament @xmath030kpc north of the central galaxy",
    ". this would be the most extended complex of dust yet found in a cool core cluster .",
    "if associated with the cooling flow , this would imply an additional @xmath01 m@xmath23 yr@xmath2 of obscured star formation .    these results , and our interpretation , could be corroborated by high angular resolution sub - mm observations , both of cold molecular gas and far - ir continuum .",
    "if the `` focus '' of cooling has really been relocated from the cluster center , then we would expect the cold gas reservoir to be depleted on the central galaxy , and enhanced to the north .",
