    ", such a study can not be found in the literature .",
    "the aim of this paper is to compile the present knowledge of the non - relativistic qcd theory for the description of the bound - state effects in the massive - quark - loop amplitude , and to present a dedicated study on the diphoton mass spectrum near the @xmath6 threshold .",

    "the size of the imaginary part increases rapidly above @xmath84  gev with showing a resonance - like curve just below the threshold .",
    "the scale dependence of the green function originates from the two sources , one in the qcd potential and the other from the real - part renormalization . for the nlo green function , the former",
    "is well suppressed and the latter affects only the real part of the amplitude by a constant for any @xmath78 . for the lo green function , both effects are large and the amplitude shows a complicated scale dependence . especially , there remains a scale dependence in the imaginary part of the amplitude .",
    "this explains the reason that the shape of the invariant - mass distribution is stable by using the nlo green function in contrast to the lo green function .",
    "although the uncertainty in the real part of the amplitude is significant , it leads only the 10% level uncertainty to the cross section , due to the presence of the large imaginary part and the light - quark - loop contribution .",
