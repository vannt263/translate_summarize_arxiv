    "one dimensional lattice models are important tools in nonequilibrium physics . they are used to model physical systems like shaken granular gases  @xcite , vehicular traffic  @xcite and ribosomal motion on mrna  @xcite .",
    "the scope of these models however is larger than modelling particular phenomena . in absence of a general formalism",
    ", their study helps us understand the nature of steady states and phase transitions in nonequilibrium systems  @xcite .",
    "in particular , the asymmetric simple exclusion process ( asep )  @xcite and the zero range process ( zrp )  @xcite have emerged as paradigms and have provided us important insights owing to their simplicity and analytic tractability .",
    "the asep with open boundaries shows the interesting phenomenon of boundary induced phase transitions  @xcite .",
    "the phase behaviour and steady state properties in this case can be obtained analytically  @xcite .",
    "apart from open boundaries , dynamical features also have a significant effect on the steady state .",
    "the steady state of the zrp is known to be a product measure for certain forms of the hop rate , allowing analytic treatment  @xcite .",
    "other dynamical features like chipping and aggregation  @xcite , disorder  @xcite and evaporation / deposition  @xcite have been shown to affect the steady state behaviour .",
    "our work involves studying the effect of non - local hops , a feature whose effect on simple exclusion process has recently been explored  @xcite .",
    "the study of zrp like models with hops of arbitrary length has been done in the equilibrium context in the urn models  @xcite .",
    "+ in this paper we study a one dimensional lattice model similar to the zrp , allowing for unlimited occupancy .",
    "the particles have an attractive interaction with hopping rates inversely proportional to the occupancy @xmath2 , @xmath3 being the label of the site to which they belong .",
    "the dynamics consists of two possible moves - a particle from a randomly chosen site can either move to one of the nearest sites with a probability @xmath4 or make a non - local hop to one of the two sites at a distance of @xmath2 with probability @xmath5 ( see fig .",
    "( [ dynamics ] ) ) .",
    "thus the non - local move is always to a distance equal to the occupancy of the chosen site . while the attractive interaction aids the clustering of particles on a site , the non - local hops promote declustering .",
    "we show that the competition between these opposing mechanisms leads to a phase transition between a condensate and a homogeneous density phase .",
    "it is well known for the zrp that if the hop rate decays to zero in the limit of infinite occupancy , there is a condensate formations at all densities  @xcite .",
    "thus the @xmath6 limit of our model has a steady state with a condensate containing a finite number of particles , while the density on the rest of the lattice approaches zero .",
    "as we will see , the steady state changes as @xmath0 is increased and the condensate disappears at a finite value of @xmath0 .",
    "+ our model can be compared to the conserved mass aggregation ( ca ) models studied in  @xcite where a phase transition occurs due to the opposing mechanisms of chipping and aggregation . in these models ,",
    "a cluster of particles moves as a whole and merges with particles already present at the arrival site .",
    "this promotes clustering . on the other hand",
    ", it is also possible for single particles to chip off from a cluster , promoting declustering .",
    "the control parameters here are the density and the probability of chipping .",
    "as the density is increased for a given chipping probability , the system goes from a homogeneous to a condensate phase . +",
    "our results show some similarity with the model described above .",
    "we find a phase transition controlled by two parameters - the density and the probability of non - local hops ( phase diagram , fig .",
    "( [ phase ] ) ) .",
    "while nonequilibrium models with a condensation transition have been well studied , the importance of this work lies in a novel physical mechanism for the transition .",
    "the melting of the condensate in our case crucially depends on the symmetry in particle dynamics and on the dimension .",
    "the phase transition happens only with symmetric dynamics and is expected to occur only in one dimension .",
    "we will describe the physical mechanism behind these results in the discussion section .",
    "+ the paper is organised as follows . in section @xmath7",
    ", we describe the model and present numerical results for the phase transition .",
    "we analyse these results in section @xmath8 .",
    "we find that a mean field approximation for the model does not capture the phase transition .",
    "we provide heuristic arguments for the physical mechanism of the transition .",
    "our arguments are supported by numerics .",
    "we summarise our results in section @xmath9 .",
    "we consider a lattice with @xmath10 sites and @xmath11 particles moving on it . we take periodic boundary conditions and allow for arbitrary occupancy at the sites .",
    "the dynamics is as follows : we choose a site at random and if it is occupied , we attempt to move a particle from this site . the rate of a particle moving out of this site , @xmath12 , is determined by the occupancy @xmath13 of the site and we take @xmath14 .",
    "a particle that leaves the site can either make a local move to one of the nearest neighbour sites with probability @xmath4 , or it can make a non - local move to one of the two sites at a distance @xmath13 with probability @xmath5 . here",
    "@xmath0 lies in the interval @xmath15 $ ] .",
    "the dynamical moves with the overall rates of particle motion are shown schematically in fig .",
    "[ dynamics ] .",
    "the non - local hops and periodic boundary condition impose a limit on the number of particles .",
    "long jumps of length @xmath16 or more will move the particle closer to the originating site instead of taking it farther .",
    "therefore , the maximum possible value of @xmath11 is @xmath17 .",
    "+      we performed monte - carlo simulations using the dynamics described in the previous section .",
    "we computed the distribution @xmath18 which gives the probability of finding @xmath13 particles on any given lattice site .",
    "( [ probdist ] ) shows the variation of @xmath18 as a function of the parameter @xmath0 .",
    "the number of particles here is @xmath19 ( @xmath20 , @xmath21 . for smaller values of @xmath0",
    "we see a peak in the distribution function at large @xmath13 , in addition to a continuous function at small @xmath13 .",
    "the peak represents a condensate while the continuous part represents the distribution of particles which are not part of the condensate .",
    "the peak disappears as @xmath0 is increased beyond a critical value @xmath1 indicating that there is no condensate for @xmath22 .",
    "the value of @xmath1 in this case is @xmath23 .",
    "the probability distribution at @xmath1 is a power law and the exponent @xmath24 seems to best fit the data at small arguments .",
    "the data for @xmath25 does not fit a simple functional form .",
    "the noncondensate part of the probability distribution for @xmath26 also does not fit a simple function unlike previously studied models where it is shown to be a power law @xcite .",
    "+ figure  ( [ cluster ] ) plots the average number of particles in the condensate , @xmath27 , as a function of the system size @xmath10 , for density close to half ( @xmath19 ) .",
    "the data fits a straight line indicating that the number of particles in the condensate is a finite fraction of the total number .",
    "this fraction can be inferred from the slope of the lines .",
    "as expected from the zrp results , at @xmath28 nearly all of the mass is contained in the condensate . as @xmath0 is increased , the fraction of particles in the condensate decreases but is still a finite fraction of the total mass .",
    "thus the picture of the steady state in the @xmath29 regime is that in addition to a condensate , there is a finite number of particles distributed homogeneously on the lattice .",
    "+    we computed the probability distribution @xmath18 for different values of particle density @xmath30 and studied the change in steady state as a function @xmath0 .",
    "our results show that there is a phase transition and the value of @xmath1 decreases with the decrease in density .",
    "the phase diagram in fig .",
    "( [ phase ] ) sums up our results .",
    "while we have kept the density constant and studied the phase change as a function of @xmath0 , one could equivalently see the transition from a homogeneous density to a condensate phase by keeping @xmath0 constant and increasing the density .",
    "the factorisation of steady state probability in the zero range process makes analytic treatment possible .",
    "the criterion for factorisability has been discussed in  @xcite and it has been shown that the steady state factorises if the hop rate from a site @xmath31 to a site @xmath32 , @xmath33 , has the general form @xmath34 . here @xmath35 gives the probability of a particle leaving the site @xmath31 which is occupied by @xmath36 particles and @xmath37 is the probability that the particle hops to site @xmath32 . in our case",
    "however , there is an explicit dependence of @xmath37 on @xmath36 and the steady state in our model can not be written in a factorised form .",
    "when exact treatment is not possible , mean - field analysis has proven to be successful in studying phase transitions in similar systems  @xcite .",
    "we will show that in our case , a mean - field equation that assumes no correlation between the sites does not capture the phase transition and the steady state behaviour .",
    "we will provide a heuristic understanding of the phase transition mechanism and discuss a possible cause of the failure of the mean - field treatment .",
    "+ we can write the equation for the probability @xmath18 in the mean - field approximation as    @xmath38    here @xmath14 is the probability of a particle escaping a site having @xmath13 particles .",
    "the probability @xmath18 will decrease if a site occupied with @xmath13 particles either loses or gains a particle .",
    "the first term on the rhs is a loss term arising from a particle leaving a site having @xmath13 particles .",
    "the second term accounts for a particle being added to the @xmath13 particles already present .",
    "this may happen in two ways ; via a local hop from the nearest neighbours or from a non - local hop from any site on the lattice .",
    "thus the term with co - efficient @xmath39 inside the bracket comes from the local jumps and the summation is over all possible occupancies for the nearest neighbour site .",
    "the term inside the bracket with co - efficient @xmath0 arises from non - local hops , the summation here is over sites at a distance @xmath32 which have exactly @xmath32 particles .",
    "the third and fourth terms are gain terms - @xmath18 increases if one of the @xmath40 particles present at a site leaves or if a particle enters a site having @xmath41 particles .",
    "the last term again has local and non - local contributions . in all terms",
    ", there is an implied left and right contribution of @xmath42 and @xmath42 each , which add up to give @xmath43 .",
    "+ the above equation reduces to    @xmath44    which is independent of @xmath0 and carries no information about the non - local dynamics .",
    "in fact eq .",
    "( [ meanfield2 ] ) is the same as that for a simple zrp with nearest neighbour hops i.e. the p=0 limit of our system .",
    "it therefore describes a steady state with a condensate containing all the particles .",
    "thus , the above equation does not describe phase transition in the one dimensional system we are looking at .",
    "since mean field theory is expected to work in higher dimensions , the observed transition should be a feature restricted to low dimensions .",
    "+ a comparison of the relevant time scales in a system can provide insight into the cause of the phase transition  @xcite and we employ a similar method to analyse our system .",
    "consider the system to have a condensate of mass @xmath45 at some value of @xmath46 . since the rate of a particle to leave the condensate is @xmath47 , one particle",
    "is lost every @xmath45 time steps .",
    "a fraction @xmath0 of these particles make non - local hops , therefore there is one non - local hop in @xmath48 time steps . now consider the time of return to the condensate of the particle that has made a non - local hop .",
    "since the density on the lattice is small , this particle will return diffusively , making mainly local hops .",
    "thus the time of return of this particle goes as @xmath49 .",
    "this is comparable to the time it would take for the whole condensate to melt down , @xmath50 .",
    "the local hops are irrelevant as the particles can return to the condensate in a time of order one and therefore can not cause declustering .",
    "+ so we see that it is an interplay of the two time scales of condensate melting versus diffusive return that determines the phase of the system . which one of these dominates is determined by the value of @xmath0 as well as the density of particles on the lattice .",
    "a higher value of @xmath0 leads to more declustering and a smaller density leads to smaller condensates , both of which favour a homogeneous density phase . on the other hand a higher density and a smaller value of @xmath0 will favour condensate formation . this heuristic argument ,",
    "if true , leads to interesting consequences which serve as checks for its validity . +",
    "suppose the probability of a particle leaving a site has a general form @xmath51 , with our model above corresponding to the special case of @xmath52 .",
    "the argument of competing time scales predicts that for @xmath53 , the steady state will have a condensate for any value of @xmath0 .",
    "this is borne out in our simulations , fig .",
    "( [ alphadep ] ) . for @xmath54 ,",
    "the @xmath28 state is a condensate phase as predicted by the zrp but we expect that there should be no condensate for @xmath55 .",
    "we indeed see that for small @xmath56 , the condensate disappears at very small values of @xmath0 , fig .",
    "( [ alphadep ] ) ( inset ) .",
    "another possible alteration in our original model can be that the non - local hop , instead of having a length @xmath13 , has a length equal to the integer part of @xmath57 .",
    "for @xmath58 , we expect from the argument of time scales that the condensate will always persist .",
    "we have also confirmed this prediction with our numerics .",
    "these results give credence to our argument .",
    "+    we also studied the effect of introducing asymmetry in the dynamics . in the model above , the particles have an equal probability of moving either in the left or the right direction .",
    "we introduced an asymmetry so that the probability of moving in one direction is greater than the other . because of this asymmetry , particles making a non - local hop can return to the cluster in a time proportional to size of the cluster @xmath45 instead of the diffusive @xmath49 .",
    "thus the asymmetry acts to stabilise the condensate .",
    "our results in fig .",
    "( [ asymmetry ] ) show that the introduction of even a slight asymmetry causes the homogeneous density phase to disappear .",
    "we again see that it is the diffusive dynamics which is responsible for the phase transition .",
    "+    let us now consider dimensions higher than one .",
    "since we are working with a finite density , the number of particles on the lattice scales as @xmath59 , @xmath60 being the dimension .",
    "thus the size of the condensate also scales as @xmath59 . on the other hand",
    ", our dynamical rules do not allow the particles to make jumps of length larger than the system size @xmath10 .",
    "thus a particle farthest from the condensate will make a diffusive return in time of order @xmath61 .",
    "this is always smaller than the time scale of cluster melting which goes faster than @xmath62 .",
    "thus , if we define a restricted model in higher dimension , it will always have a condensate as predicted by the mean field theory .",
    "our model therefore is expected to work only in one dimension .",
    "we have studied phase transition in a nonequilibrium lattice model in one dimension . the transition from a condensate phase to a homogeneous density phase",
    "is caused by two opposing factors - the attractive interaction between the particles which promotes condensation and the non - local move which destabilises the condensate .",
    "we find that the diffusive dynamics is crucial to the transition , as is the fact that the leaving probability @xmath12 is inversely proportional to the number of particles in the cluster , @xmath14 .",
    "this explains why the transition takes place only in one dimension and the mean - field treatment fails .",
    "for the same reason , an introduction of asymmetry in the dynamics leads to only one phase , the condensate phase .",
