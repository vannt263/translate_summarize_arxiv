    "we consider experiments with two qualitative factors at two levels each with binary response , and investigate the robustness of the @xmath1-optimal allocation of replicates .",
    "binary responses are usually modelled using generalized linear models ( glms ) .",
    "glms have been used widely for modelling the mean response both for discrete and continuous random variables with an emphasis on categorical response .",
    "although the methods of analyzing data using these models have been discussed in depth in the literature ( mccullagh and nelder ( 1989 ) , agresti ( 2003 ) ) , only a limited number of results are available for the choice of optimal design of experiments under glms ( khuri et al .",
    "( 2006 ) ) .",
    "recently mandal , yang and majumdar ( 2010 ) obtained some theoretical results for locally d - optimal @xmath2 designs in some special cases . recall that fisher s information matrix contains the unknown parameters , and so does the d - optimality criterion .",
    "as we consider the locally optimal designs , a critical question is how to choose the initial values of the unknown parameters , and also to investigate the robustness of the optimal designs with respect to misspecification of the values of the parameters , an issue which was briefly mentioned but not explored in details in our earlier parer . in this paper , we obtain theoretical as well as numerical results on the optimality of @xmath2 designs .",
    "we investigate thoroughly the robustness of designs , with particular emphasis on the uniform ( @xmath3 , equireplicate ) design .",
    "the optimality criterion can be written in terms of the variances , or information , at each of the @xmath4 points .",
    "note that these variances depend on the parameters through the link function .",
    "it turns out that the @xmath1-optimal design can be quite different from the uniform design , especially when at least two of these variances are far from each other .",
    "our results can be described as follows . if the experimenter has reliable knowledge of the variances then the design obtained by using the cylindrical algebraic decomposition ( cad ) technique discussed later results in a highly efficient design .",
    "if the experimenter has some approximate knowledge of those variances , then using our results , efficient designs can be obtained . in the absence of any prior idea of the variances our recommendation is to use the uniform design , which is the most robust one in general .",
    "it may be noted that for applications where a @xmath1-optimal design can not be used , it can still serve as a benchmark to evaluate other designs .    for illustration",
    "suppose we have a linear predictor involving two factors , namely , family history ( @xmath5 ) and physical exercise ( @xmath6 ) , which leads to the linear predictor @xmath7 .",
    "if we have sound reasons to believe that family history is a much more dominant factor than exercise , and on the basis of prior knowledge , an initial choice of parameters @xmath8 is reasonable , then the optimal allocation of 100 experimental units using the cad method will be @xmath9 .",
    "one the other hand , if the practitioner decides to use the popular uniform design , then the relative loss of efficiency is approximately 5% .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "we give the preliminary setup and some relevant results from mandal , yang and majumdar ( 2010 ) . the cylindrical algebraic decomposition technique to solve the general @xmath1-optimality problem for @xmath4 experiment",
    "will be discussed in section 3 . in section 4",
    "we discuss robustness of the @xmath1-optimal designs both theoretically and numerically .",
    "we study the robustness of uniform design as well as a real experiment in section 5 and conclude with some remarks in section 6 .",
    "all proofs are relegated to the appendix .",
    "consider a @xmath10 experiment , i.e. , an experiment with @xmath11 explanatory variables at @xmath0 levels each .",
    "suppose the proportion of units allocated to the @xmath12th experimental condition is @xmath13 , such that @xmath14 @xmath15 , and @xmath16 .",
    "in this paper we consider the problem of finding the `` optimal '' @xmath13 s .",
    "let @xmath17 be the linear predictor for the chosen model .",
    "for instance , in a @xmath18 experiment , @xmath19 represents a model that includes all the main effects and the two - factor interaction of factors @xmath0 and @xmath20 . the aim of the experiment is to obtain inferences about the parameter vector of factor effects @xmath21 in the preceding example , @xmath22    in this paper , we consider the @xmath4 experiment with main - effects model , which gives @xmath23 and @xmath24 . here",
    "the mean response @xmath25 is connected to the linear predictor @xmath26 by the link function ( mccullagh and nelder ( 1989 ) ) .",
    "the maximum likelihood estimator of @xmath27 has an asymptotic covariance matrix that is the inverse of @xmath28 , where @xmath29 , @xmath30 and @xmath31 is the `` model matrix '' .",
    "for example , for a @xmath4 experiment with main - effects model , @xmath32 , @xmath33 , @xmath34 @xmath35 @xmath36 .",
    "the _ @xmath1-optimality _ criterion maximizes @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the number of parameters in the model ; in this case @xmath39 . in the rest of this section",
    ", we will give some basic ideas and results developed in mandal , yang and majumdar ( 2010 ) .",
    "for the @xmath2 experiment with main - effects model , the optimization problem maximizing @xmath37 reduces to maximizing @xmath40 where @xmath41 , @xmath42 , @xmath43 and @xmath44 . assuming @xmath45 for @xmath46",
    ", we consider the problem of maximizing @xmath47 over all vectors @xmath48 with @xmath49 and @xmath50 .",
    "although the objective function ( [ simplifiedprob ] ) is elegant , an analytic solution with general @xmath45 is not available .",
    "mandal , yang and majumdar ( 2010 ) proved the following results .",
    "[ lemma:1 ] if @xmath51 , then any solution maximizing @xmath47 must satisfy @xmath52 ; if @xmath53 , then any solution must satisfy @xmath54 .",
    "[ thm:1 ] @xmath47 has a unique maximum at @xmath55 if and only if @xmath56 .",
    "note that this does not correspond to a complete @xmath2 experiment , rather it corresponds to a design supported only on three points , which is saturated for the main effects plan @xmath57 .",
    "theorem  [ thm:1 ] reveals that the @xmath1-optimal design is saturated if and only if @xmath58 , that is , @xmath59 we call ( [ boundarycondition ] ) the _ saturation condition_. this condition will play a crucial role in our robustness study .",
    "we defer the discussion on the importance of condition until section  4 .",
    "we also need the two corollaries listed below in the robustness study .",
    "[ corollary:1 ] suppose @xmath60 and @xmath61 .",
    "then the solution maximizing ( [ simplifiedprob ] ) is @xmath62 with the maximum @xmath63 .",
    "[ corollary:2 ] suppose @xmath64 , @xmath65 , and @xmath66 .",
    "then the solution maximizing ( [ simplifiedprob ] ) is @xmath67 with the maximum @xmath68 $ ] , where @xmath69 .",
    "since analytic solutions for the optimization problem in ( [ simplifiedprob ] ) is not available , in this section we will investigate computer - aided exact solution .",
    "one option is to use the lagrange multipliers or the karush - kuhn - tucker ( kkt ) conditions ( karush ( 1939 ) , kuhn and tucker ( 1951 ) ) .",
    "it leads to intractable polynomial equations .",
    "another option is to use numerical search algorithms such as nelder - mead , quasi - newton , conjugate - gradient , or simply a grid search ( for a comprehensive reference , see nocedal and wright ( 1999 ) ) .",
    "those numerical methods are computational intensive in general when an accurate solution is needed .",
    "we suggest using the _ cylindrical algebraic decomposition _ ( cad ) algorithm to find the exact global solution .",
    "fotiou et al .",
    "( 2005 ) gave detailed description of using cad for general constrained optimization problems .",
    "our optimization problem ( [ simplifiedprob ] ) is associated with the so - called _ boolean expression _ : @xmath70 where @xmath71 , and @xmath72 is a new parameter indicating the value of the objective function .",
    "given specific values of @xmath73 , the cad can represent the feasible domain of @xmath74 in @xmath75 as a finite union of disjoint cells .",
    "each cell takes the form @xmath76 for some constants @xmath77 and some functions @xmath78 , @xmath79 .",
    "since @xmath72 indicates the value of the objective function @xmath80 ( or @xmath81 ) , the cell with greatest @xmath72 provides us the maximum of @xmath80 .",
    "we will illustrate the method with an example .",
    "suppose @xmath82 . using the software mathematica",
    ", we obtain that the maximum of @xmath80 based on cad is the negative first root of equation @xmath83 and    * @xmath84 is the @xmath85th root of equation @xmath86 * @xmath87 is the @xmath0nd root of equation @xmath88 * @xmath89 is the @xmath0nd root of equation @xmath90 .    here the numerical solution is @xmath91 with @xmath92 .",
    "note that the cad algorithm can be used to find exact solution for general @xmath73 , although an explicit formula is not available .",
    "this technique will be used in the next section for robustness study .",
    "since locally optimal designs depend on the assumed values of the parameters , it is important to study the robustness of the designs to these values . for experiments where there is no basis for making an informed choice of the assumed values ,",
    "the natural design choice is the uniform design . in this section",
    ", we study the robustness of the optimal design for misspecification of assumed values .",
    "suppose @xmath94 is the true @xmath95 , and @xmath96 is the chosen ( assumed ) @xmath95 .",
    "let @xmath97 and @xmath98 be the optimal designs corresponding to @xmath99 and @xmath100 , respectively .",
    "the relative loss of efficiency of choosing @xmath100 instead of @xmath99 may be defined as @xmath101 where the notation @xmath102 was defined prior to expression ( [ simplifiedprob ] ) .",
    "note that @xmath103 in equation  ( [ eqn : r ] ) remains invariant under scalar multiplication of determinants .",
    "now let us define the maximum relative loss of efficiency as @xmath104 this maximum will correspond to the worst case scenario .",
    "this tells us , for each @xmath105 , how bad the design can perform if we do not choose the @xmath105 correctly .     versus @xmath106,width=211,height=192 ]    for a binary response , we consider the commonly used link functions including logit , probit , log - log and complimentary log - log links .",
    "figure  [ fig1 ] illustrates the range of @xmath93 for specific link functions .",
    "the logit link corresponds to @xmath107 whereas for the probit link @xmath108 and for the ( complementary ) log - log links @xmath109 .",
    "it should also be noted that the @xmath93-curve is symmetric for logit and probit links but asymmetric for the ( complementary ) log - log link . to examine the robustness for mis - specification of @xmath93 for different links , we assume @xmath110 for some constants @xmath111 and @xmath112 , since @xmath113 leads to trivial cases .    fixing a chosen @xmath96 ,",

    "define @xmath118 with @xmath119 , @xmath46 . in practice",
    ", the experimenter might have some rough idea about the range of the parameter values and our next theorem specifies the worst possible performance of a chosen design for that assumed range .    [ thm:2 ] suppose @xmath120 and @xmath121 , @xmath46 .    *",

    "if we randomly select @xmath161 s between @xmath131 and @xmath162 , the chance of getting a saturated design can be as high as 48% when some @xmath161 is close to @xmath131 and the condition of theorem  [ thm:1 ] applies .",
    "we try to skip the cases that give a saturated design since in those cases both the exact solution and robustness are clearly known .",
    "so here we consider @xmath163 only .",
    "then the chance of saturated design drops to 6% for uniformly distributed @xmath161 s .",

    "the main difficulty is that a concise expression like @xmath173 is not available .",
