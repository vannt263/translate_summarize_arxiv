    "the breaking of space - time symmetries , and their role in the generation of directed transport in single particle hamiltonian ratchets , have been extensively studied in the classical @xcite and quantum regimes @xcite .",

    "real experiments involve many atoms , and interaction between them may be tuned , but will always be left at least at some residual nonzero level .",
    "therefore , the impact of interactions on quantum ratchets has to be addressed .    in this paper , we study , using the mean - field approach , the generation of directed transport of interacting quantum particles in a periodic potential under the action of a two harmonic driving . with this approach",
    "we mimic the motion of cold atoms in an optical lattice under the presence of an external force @xcite , but at much lower temperatures , when a bose - einstein condensate may form @xcite . to this end",
    ", we investigate the continuation of floquet states of the corresponding linear system into the nonlinear domain .",
    "we show that a resonant enhancement of the current in the nonlinear regime takes place , which results from the resonant interaction between _ nonlinear floquet states_. we derive an analytical expression for the evolution of quasienergies in the nonlinear regime .",
    "finally we show the relation between the transport properties of nonlinear floquet states and the asymptotic current of an initial state with zero momentum .",
    "experimental realizations of ratchets with cold atoms may tune the temperatures from mk down to @xmath0k , such that a bose - einstein condensate may form due to interactions between particles @xcite . the corresponding general equation to be studied",
    "is then given by the one - dimensional gross - pitaevskii equation ( see e.g. @xcite ) @xmath1     \\psi+ \\frac{4\\pi \\hbar^2 a_{s } } { m } | \\psi |^2 \\psi ,   \\label{shrogauge0}\\ ] ] where @xmath2 is the s - wave scattering length , @xmath3 is the atomic mass , @xmath4 is the optical lattice wave number with optical step @xmath5 , @xmath6 is the periodic potential depth , and @xmath7 is a periodic driving force .",

    "it was shown in @xcite that , for the appearance of a dc - current in the quantum regime , two symmetries need to be broken .",
    "these symmetries are defined in the classical limit as follows @xcite .",
    "if @xmath26 is shift symmetric @xmath27 , then the hamiltonian ( [ hamilto0 ] ) is invariant under the transformation @xmath28 likewise if @xmath26 possesses the symmetry @xmath29 , then ( [ hamilto0 ] ) is invariant under the transformation @xmath30 the hamiltonian eq.([hamilto0 ] ) is a periodic function of time .",
    "then the solutions , @xmath31 , can be characterized by the dynamics of the eigenfunctions of @xmath32 which satisfy the floquet theorem : @xmath33 @xmath34 and the floquet eigenstates can be obtained as solutions of the eigenvalue problem of the floquet operator @xmath35 due to the discrete translational invariance of eq.([hamilto ] ) and bloch s theorem all floquet states are characterized by a quasimomentum @xmath36 with @xmath37 which corresponds to initial states where atoms equally populate all ( or many ) wells of the spatial potential .",
    "this allows us to use periodic boundary conditions for eq.([shrogauge ] ) , with spatial period @xmath38 , so that the wave function can be expanded in the plane wave eigenbasis of the momentum operator @xmath39 , @xmath40 , viz .",
    "@xmath41-[hamilto ] ) in the linear limit . in the computations we neglect the contribution originating from @xmath42 , since it only yields a global phase factor .",
    "details of the numerical method are given in @xcite .",
    "a study of a related problem with nonzero @xmath36 has been published in @xcite , which shows that the essential features of avoided crossings survive .    .",

    "the quasienergies are symmetric with respect to a reflection in @xmath44 as deduced from eq.([sym - ener ] ) , while from eq.([sym - current ] ) it follows that the current is antisymmetric with respect to a reflection at the origin .",

    "it is necessary to compute the asymptotic current .",
    "it is obtained using the expression @xmath59 are the floquet states momenta and @xmath60 are the expansion coefficients of the initial wave function in the basis of floquet states . breaking the symmetries @xmath52 ( [ eq : sa ] ) and @xmath57 ( [ eq : sb ] ) , we desymmetrize the floquet states , i.e. the floquet states momenta acquire a finite value @xmath61 , which results in the appearance of a directed transport .    in general , the current is a function of the initial time @xmath22 and the relative phase @xmath44 , namely @xmath62 . after averaging over the initial time it exhibits the property @xcite :    @xmath63    we focus the analysis on previous computations obtained for @xmath64 in @xcite .",

    "the quasienergies of the system eqs.([shrogauge]-[hamilto ] ) in the linear limit possess the property @xcite @xmath66    fig.[fig : linear]b shows the current dependence on @xmath44 .",
    "the computation is performed taking the initial state @xmath67 , which overlaps with states in the chaotic layer . with this initial condition",
    "we mimic a dilute gas of atoms which are spread all over the lattice with zero momentum .",
    "the current has two peaks which are linked to avoided crossings displayed in fig.[fig : linear]a . in these particular avoided crossings , states from the chaotic layer and transporting states mix , which leads to a leakage from the chaotic layer to the transporting state , thereby enhancing the current .",
    "on the other hand , it was shown in @xcite that by tuning the amplitude of the second harmonic of the driving force the peaks becomes broader which makes it easier resolving it in experiments ( see dashed line in fig.[fig : linear]b ) .      in the nonlinear case",
    "the analysis of the generation of directed transport in the presence of a driving force is much more complicated , due to possible nonintegrability , classical chaos , and mixing @xcite .",
    "however , one can take the floquet states of the linear problem , and continue them as periodic orbits into the nonlinear regime",
    ". then these nonlinear floquet states can be analyzed .",
    "while in the linear regime the evolution of the floquet state is determined by eq.([operator ] ) with a unitary operator @xmath68 , in the nonlinear regime the unitarity is lost , and is replaced locally by simplectic maps @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , a similar transformation over one period of the ac driving can be defined , viz .",
    "@xmath69 where @xmath55 is a nonlinear map of the phase space onto itself , defined by integrating a given trajectory over one period of the ac driving @xcite .",
    "the solutions @xmath70 constitute generalizations of the linear floquet states ( [ eq : floquet ] ) .    to compute the nonlinear floquet states , we use a numerical method implemented in computational studies of periodic orbits @xcite .",
    "the basics steps are as follows .",
    "first , we choose a linear floquet state as an initial seed . then taking a small value of the nonlinearity strength , we compute the new solution using a newton - raphson iterative procedure , by variying initial seed ( see appendix a for a detailed explanation ) .",
    "the procedure involves conservation of the norm and the variation of the quasienergy of the state , which together enforce the convergence to the desired solution . in each iteration step , the new trial solution is integrated over one time period @xmath71 .",
    "once a solution is found , we increase the nonlinearity strength again by a small amount and repeat the same procedure .",
    "thus , we trace the solution into the nonlinear domain .",
    "desymmetrization of the floquet states , due to breaking of symmetries , leads to the appearance of directed transport in the linear regime with enhancement of transport due to resonant floquet states .",
    "it is therefore worthwhile to investigate what happens with nonlinear floquet states in the absence of those symmetries , and trace the fate of the abovementioned resonances in the nonlinear regime .      to gain insight into the effect of breaking symmetries on nonlinear floquet states , we utilize a basic model of two coupled bec states in the presence of an external driving .",
    "the equations for a driven two sites model can be written as @xmath72 where @xmath73 , @xmath74 is the coupling term , and @xmath75 are the populations or number of particles in the sites 1,2 .",
    "the above equations can be also qualitatively viewed as a restriction of the original case ( [ hamilto ] ) to just two basis states with opposite momenta .",
    "that leads to the corresponding different signs of the last terms in the rhs of the above equations .",
    "with @xmath76 the equations above are used to describe , on the mean field level , the self - trapping transition of two coupled bec .",
    "it was shown in @xcite that such a phenomenon occurs when the nonlinearity exceeds a critical value , and the new states are characterized by a population imbalance @xmath77 .",
    "the existence of critical or threshold values have been predicted as well @xcite .",
    "the critical value is determined by the bifurcation point of the stationary solutions .",
    "the selftrapped states violate the permutational symmetry of ( [ eq : dimer1]),([eq : dimer2 ] ) , which implies that the equations are invariant under permutation of the two indices . if @xmath78 , the permutational symmetry is broken in general . if however @xmath79 is symmetric , then the dimer equations are invariant under the combined action of permutation _ and _ time reversal .",
    "let us consider the linear case @xmath80 first . for @xmath76",
    "the stationary solutions are the in- and out - of - phase modes @xmath81 , which are in fact strictly time - periodic states , with period @xmath82 .",
    "adding the ac drive @xmath79 they transform into two linear floquet states .",
    "they will start to become asymmetric , since the presence of @xmath79 violates permutational invariance , _ but only if @xmath79 is also violating time - reversal antisymmetry_. note that if @xmath79 is antisymmetric , the original ac field @xmath26 is symmetric .",
    "if on the contrary time - reversal antisymmetry is in place , the linear floquet states will still be invariant under the combined action of permutation , time reversal , and complex conjugation .",
    "thus they do not acquire any population imbalance .",
    "also the floquet states will now acquire a nonzero phase shift @xmath83 , where @xmath84 in the limit @xmath85 , when iterated over one period of the driving @xmath71 .    in the presence of nonlinearity close to these linear floquet states",
    "there will be again states , which are periodic in the sense that after one period of the ac driving the state returns to itself , up to a corresponding phase .",
    "note that both the shape of the eigenstate , but also the phase ( i.e. the analogue of the quasienergy in the linear case ) will smoothly change upon continuation into the nonlinear regime .",
    "the continuation process of such a nonlinear floquet state is thus encoded by the linear floquet state at @xmath80 , which is chosen to be continued .    in the case of @xmath86 ,",
    "@xmath87 being nonzero , @xmath44 becomes a relevant parameter . for @xmath88 time - reversal antisymmetry",
    "is broken , and the nonlinear floquet solutions will also loose that symmetry , together with the permutational symmetry ( see above ) .",
    "hereafter , we name by symmetric the case when @xmath89 and nonsymmetric otherwise .",
    "we will also coin linear and nonlinear floquet states _ periodic orbits _ , although they are only periodic up to the above mentioned phase shift .    [",
    "cols=\"<,^ \" , ]     let us now investigate the evolution of the state @xmath90 for @xmath91 . in the linear regime , we use the floquet representation to derive the expression for the asymptotic current . in the nonlinear regime",
    "it is no longer possible .",
    "instead , we compute the running average momentum @xmath92 with @xmath93 , over long times , which becomes the asymptotic current in the limit @xmath94 , i.e. , @xmath95 . to validate the convergence to the asymptotic current we use maximum integration times ranging from 100000 till 300000 time periods .",
    "first we compute the current for @xmath96 .",
    "in such a case , for @xmath80 , there is an avoided crossing ( see above discussion ) , i.e. a resonance .",
    "further increase of the nonlinearity leads to a decay of the current ( fig.[fig : init ] ) .",
    "however , taking @xmath97 , we observe a corresponding shift of the resonance peak to larger values of the nonlinearity parameter , thus showing a robustness of the resonant current enhancement observed in the linear limit .",
    "fig.[fig : init ] shows the dependence of the current on @xmath44 .",
    "resonances similar to the linear case are observed , which are shifted in @xmath44 .",
    "thus the nonlinearity strength can also be used as a control parameter for tuning resonances .",
    "it was shown for the linear regime @xcite that the current depends upon the initial time @xmath22 . in the nonlinear case",
    ", the dynamics may exhibit similar behavior to classical chaos @xcite , making the analysis more complicated .",
    "an essential point here is that , while in the linear regime floquet states mix in narrow parameter regions via avoided crossings , in the nonlinear domain mixed states may survive for a fairly large range of nonlinearity values .",
    "this , along with the fact of having multiple bifurcations with the appearance of new periodic states @xcite , may lead to classical - like chaotic behavior predicted in @xcite .",
    "a benchmark for the persistence of directed transport is that the sum of currents for different initial times do not cancel . to check that , we compute the momentum evolution for different initial times with the system in and out of resonances . in fig.[fig : init ] , we present the current dependence upon the initial time @xmath22 .",
    "the curve depicted by filled circles shows a similar behavior to the one obtained in the linear regime with the system in resonance ( cf .",
    "fig.4 in @xcite ) .",
    "it also displays a large positive current for all initial times , thus confirming the existence of directed motion . on the contrary",
    ", the curve with squares shows a nearly flat profile with smaller current values , recalling the off resonance scenario in the linear limit .",
    "we have studied the rectification of interacting quantum particles in a periodic potential exposed to the action of an external ac driving , using a mean - field approach .",
    "we showed that by tuning the nonlinearity in an optical lattice it is possible to enhance the directed transport of cold atoms . a possible experimental way to achieve",
    "it is to vary the scattering length by changing the strength of the magnetic field @xcite .",
    "these resonances are partly continued from the noninteracting system , but become saddle node bifurcations of more complicated nonlinear floquet states in the nonlinear system under consideration .",
    "we developed analytical estimates of the nonlinearity strength in the resonance , and showed that the evolution of an initial state with zero momentum carries all signatures of a ratchet state , i.e. its average momentum is nonzero .",
    "therefore , ratchets and quantum resonances of ( nonlinear ) floquet states are robust with respect to interactions , and should be observable in real experiments .    finally , bifurcations of the nonlinear floquet states have been observed , which may affect the measured currents strongly .",
    "take eq.([osymplectic ] ) @xmath98 where @xmath70 are periodic solutions in the nonlinear domain and @xmath55 is a symplectic operator .",
    "the periodic states @xmath99 are decomposed into real and imaginary parts as @xmath100 ,   { \\mbox i m } [ \\psi_{\\alpha}(0 ) ] \\}$ ] .",
    "likewise , we define the vector @xmath101,{\\mbox im}[\\exp(i    \\epsilon_{\\alpha } ) u \\psi_{\\alpha}(0)]\\ } $ ] . for convenience",
    "we write them as @xmath102 dimensional vectors @xmath103 , @xmath104 $ ] , where @xmath105 is the dimension of the hilbert space @xcite . hereafter ,",
    "for simplicity , we drop the index @xmath106 .",
    "the two vectors @xmath107 , @xmath108 are identical for the linear case . assuming weak nonlinearity , we compute the vector @xmath107 after one integration period , taking as initial seed the linear state @xmath108 .",
    "this implies that after a full integration period our final state deviates from the initial state : @xmath109=\\vec{x}-\\vec{x}(0).\\ ] ]    to correct such a deviation we use the newton - raphson method .",
    "basically , the method updates the initial seed @xmath108 after every iteration until each component of @xmath110 is reduced to a value less than @xmath111 . for every integration over the period @xmath71 , we use the split operator method .    to successfully accomplish the reduction of the vector difference ( [ a2 ] ) , some constraints should be fulfilled .",
    "first , the floquet states should preserve the norm .",
    "we thus add another component @xmath112 , and the iteration process is also zeroing this component .",
    "to fully characterize our nonlinear floquet states , we define the new variable vector @xmath113 , with the quasienergy as the @xmath114 component .",
    "next , we define the new vector function @xmath115 $ ] . having @xmath114 variables and @xmath114 functions to be zeroed , we now may apply standard newton - raphson methods .",
    "we define an expression similar to eq.([eq : floquet ] ) , but for the nonlinear case , viz .            now define @xmath120 \\tilde\\phi(t)$ ] such that @xmath121 with @xmath122 .",
    "this assumes that after projecting the nonlinear state onto the linear space , both vectors , the projected and the floquet states in the linear space , have a phase difference @xmath123 @xcite . for simplicity",
    "we take in the following @xmath124 .",

    "( [ eq : energy - non ] ) , we rewrite it as a function of the real quasienergy @xmath130 ( see @xcite for definition ) .",
    "it relates to our @xmath131 as @xmath132 , where @xmath133",
    ". then we obtain      this expression tells us that the energy of our nonlinear floquet state is the sum of the corresponding linear and nonlinear contributions .",
    "the second term is the time average of the state energy due to the nonlinear interaction .",
