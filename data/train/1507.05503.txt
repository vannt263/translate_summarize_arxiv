    "the full configuration interaction quantum monte carlo method ( fciqmc ) and its initiator adaptation ( @xmath0-fciqmc ) are projector qmc techniques , capable of providing near - exact , systematically improvable descriptions of correlated wavefunctions expressed as linear combinations of slater determinants.@xcite this convergence is achieved by stochastically sampling the exponentially large ( though finite ) hilbert spaces of configuration interaction theory _ via _ a population dynamics performed on an ensemble of signed walkers .",
    "annihilation processes provide a means of combating the ill effects of the fermion sign problem which plagues projector approaches,@xcite exploiting the sparsity of the wavefunction induced by a judicious choice of orbital basis .",
    "the approach requires substantially less computational effort than an iterative diagonalisation technique , and has thus found considerable success in studies of atomic and molecular systems,@xcite model systems such as the homogeneous electron gas and the hubbard model,@xcite and solid - state systems.@xcite    the principal focus of many of these studies has been to derive properties based upon total energies , for which an unbiased projected estimator is readily available , and which have included excitation and dissociation energies,@xcite electron affinities,@xcite ionisation potentials,@xcite and equations of state.@xcite despite their success , however , the extension to include the calculation of a greater range of properties  expectation values of operators which do not necessarily commute with the hamiltonian  remains highly desirable .",
    "this focus has been the subject of considerable interest for the qmc community in general , and has posed a considerable challenge for decades.@xcite these properties , which include static correlation functions and entropy estimators as well as the forces , multipole moments , and polarisabilities considered here , may be deduced from the effect of a perturbation from the corresponding operator , @xmath1 , upon the hamiltonian , @xmath2 with @xmath3 the perturbation strength , such that the expectation value , @xmath4 , is given by the derivative of the energy with respect to @xmath3 , evaluated at @xmath5 : @xmath6 in accordance with the hellmann ",
    "feynman theorem,@xcite applicable to converged ( normalised ) wavefunctions by analogy with deterministic and strictly variational fci , this expression reduces to @xmath7 or equivalently to the trace of @xmath1 with the appropriate rank of reduced density matrix.@xcite it is worth noting that unconverged @xmath0-fciqmc wavefunctions need not rigorously obey the hellmann  feynman theorem , and",
    "so in this work we ensure that we are working in the large walker limit , such that systematic errors in the sampled distribution due to insufficient walker numbers have been minimized to the fci - limit",
    ".    the effective stochastic acquisition of these reduced density matrices , therefore , has the capacity to broaden the scope of significantly , and motivates the present work .",
    "we begin with a brief overview of the @xmath0-fciqmc algorithm , including its extension to non - integer walker weights,@xcite before recapitulating some of the details of the `` replica '' density - matrix sampling technique.@xcite building upon that previous work , our discussion turns to consider the calculation of nuclear forces , molecular dipole moments , and atomic dipole polarisabilities , and in so doing confirms the high quality of the sampled one- and two - body reduced density matrices which is now achievable .",
    "initiator full configuration interaction quantum monte carlo provides stochastic integration of the @xmath8-electron , imaginary - time schrdinger equation , yielding wavefunctions expressed as a linear combination of the set of slater determinants , @xmath9 , formed from the underlying one - particle ( most often hartree  fock ) basis : @xmath10 the coefficients of this wavefunction expansion are obtained by iterative application of the equations @xmath11 representing the evolution of the coefficients over a timestep @xmath12 in imaginary time .",
    "this evolution is achieved by subjecting an ensemble of signed walkers to a three - step population dynamics algorithm of `` spawning '' , `` death '' , and `` annihilation '' steps , the walker populations , @xmath13 , becoming proportional to the coefficients .",
    "the full details of this approach have been expounded in previous papers,@xcite , and what follows should be regarded only as a brief summary .",
    "typically initialised with a single walker placed upon the hartree ",
    "fock determinant , @xmath14 , a simulation using integer walkers proceeds with a coupled determinant , @xmath15 , being randomly selected for each walker on parent determinant , @xmath16 , with a probability @xmath17 .",
    "the determinant selected , the parent walker then attempts to spawn a child on to it , with a probability @xmath18 if the attempt is successful , the sign of the spawned walker matches that of its parent if @xmath19 and is inverted if @xmath20 .",
    "the initiator adaptation , @xmath0-fciqmc , modifies the spawning step by introducing a parameter , @xmath21 , which specifies a lower population threshold under which a parent determinant is prevented from spawning on to unoccupied determinants .",
    "each walker next attempts to die , with a probability given by @xmath22 in which @xmath23 is a population control parameter  known as the `` shift ''  which tends to the ground - state energy in the long-@xmath24 limit .",
    "these two steps are themselves sufficient to describe eq .",
    "[ evolution ] fully , but are insufficient to provide convergence to a fermionic wavefunction . instead",
    ", a third step  `` annihilation ''  is required in order to suppress the deleterious effects of the fermion sign problem.@xcite after each iteration , walkers of opposite sign on the same determinant annihilate , and in so doing ensure that each determinant is populated by walkers of only one sign for the next iteration .",
    "the success of these processes relies on the sparsity of the wavefunction induced by the underlying basis  typically chosen to be hartree  fock orbitals  which confines it to a generally small region of the hilbert space . in so doing",
    ", it ensures that annihilation events are numerous enough to maintain the sign structure of the sampled wavefunction accurately .",
    "although the walkers of ( @xmath0)-fciqmc were initially conceived as an ensemble of discrete particles , there is some merit in instead positing a set of non - integer walkers.@xcite such an approach reduces the amount of random number generation required , reduces the instantaneous fluctuations in the populations on a given determinant , and hence the fluctuations in the energy estimators in imaginary time .",
    "this formulation is achieved by applying the spawning , death , and annihilation steps introduced earlier _ continuously _ , rather than discretely .",
    "thus , instead of spawning a walker of signed integer weight from a determinant @xmath16 to a coupled determinant @xmath15 with a probability @xmath25 , a walker of weight @xmath26 is spawned with probability @xmath27 .",
    "likewise , the death step is remodelled such that it simply involves reducing the population on a determinant @xmath16 by @xmath28 .",
    "annihilation is achieved by taking the signed sum of walkers on each determinant on a given iteration as the residual population for the next iteration . for @xmath0-fciqmc calculations , the parameter @xmath21 is recast as a continuous variable rather than an integer .",
    "the continuous nature of the spawned walkers in this approach does not , however , imply that the number of spawning _ events _ becomes continuous . as in the integer formulation , where there are exactly @xmath29 spawning attempts from determinant @xmath16 with a population @xmath29 on each iteration , there are a discrete number of attempts per determinant per iteration . for practical purposes , a continuous spawning threshold , @xmath30 ,",
    "is introduced such that if @xmath31 , @xmath30 walkers are spawned with a probability @xmath32 .",
    "this implementation is designed to alleviate the significant cost of low - weighted spawnings compared to their effect on the overall wavefunction , as well as ensuring that the wavefunction remains compact and expressible instantaneously by a number of walkers far smaller than the size of the space .",
    "whilst the death step requires no extra modification of this kind , some additional considerations must be addressed for annihilation . in order that determinants can become completely depopulated , and",
    "we are not forced to store large numbers whose populations are very close to , but not exactly , zero , a minimum occupation threshold , @xmath33 , is imposed upon them . if , after annihilation , the population on a determinant @xmath34 , its population is set either to @xmath33 with probability @xmath35 , or else to @xmath36 with probability @xmath37 .    as a final practical means of alleviating the computational burden of this approach , it is possible to treat only a subspace of the full hilbert space with non - integer walkers , continuing to describe the remainder in a discretised fashion . in order to preserve the benefits of the non - integer approach on the fluctuations of the energy estimators ,",
    "the truncation is specified by an excitation level , @xmath38 , with only @xmath38-fold and lower excitations from the reference included in the non - integer subspace",
    ". a typical choice of parameters @xmath39 , @xmath40 ( @xmath41 is used here ) , and @xmath42 entails only a modest increase in the computational cost of the calculation over the integer implementation , while retaining many of the benefits of the full non - integer approach .",
    "@xmath0-fciqmc provides two essentially independent energy estimators , which , taken together , provide a useful confirmation of the validity of the obtained result .",
    "the first , to which we have already alluded , is the shift , @xmath23 .",
    "this is initially held constant ( typically at zero ) to facilitate an exponential growth in the number of walkers , before being allowed to vary dynamically to keep the population constant . at convergence",
    ", this variation fluctuates around the energy of system , and thus provides an energy on the basis of the growth rate of the entire ensemble of walkers .",
    "a projected energy estimator , of the form @xmath43 on the other hand , depends only upon the populations of the determinants coupled to the reference state , @xmath14 .",
    "whilst the error in this projection is formally first - order in the wavefunction error , its non - variationality tends to mean that it converges rather faster to the exact , infinite - walker limit than does a variational estimator , owing to favourable cancellation of errors .",
    "the projected energy is thus typically preferred when the wavefunction is dominated by the hartree ",
    "fock determinant , but a projection on to a multi - reference trial wavefunction or the variational estimator provided by the density matrices ( which is second - order in the wavefunction error ) are often more useful in more strongly - correlated cases.@xcite once the ensemble has equilibrated , the simulation is allowed to evolve in imaginary time until the statistical errors in both @xmath23 and @xmath44 have been satisfactorily reduced , upon which a flyvbjerg  petersen blocking analysis is performed to estimate the error in the obtained result.@xcite      in terms of the wavefunction ansatz of @xmath0-fciqmc ( eq .  [ fci - expansion ] ) and the creation and annihilation operators , the one- and two - body reduced density matrices , @xmath45 and @xmath46 , may be formulated in terms of the wavefunction expansion and the conventional creation and annihilation operators , @xmath47 and @xmath48 , as @xmath49 and , @xmath50 respectively,@xcite and an important recent development of the theory allows these objects to be sampled in an efficient , stochastically unbiased fashion.@xcite    the diagonal elements of these objects , of the form @xmath51 may be calculated straightforwardly , as each determinant , @xmath16 , contributes @xmath52 to each of the @xmath53 matrix elements involving its occupied orbitals .",
    "the corresponding explicit generation of all the required determinant pairs for the off - diagonal elements is not practical , but the observation that the relevant pairs are at most double excitations of one another allows both @xmath45 and @xmath46 to be sampled _ via _ the spawning steps.@xcite thus , the existing computational effort required for the communication of the spawning event need only be slightly accentuated ( by the need now to convey both the amplitude and the identity of the parent determinant to the child ) to allow the contributions to the off - diagonal matrix elements from determinant pairs to be calculated on the fly .    as these off - diagonal contributions are only added upon a _ successful _ spawning event , it is necessary that they be rescaled according to the probability of such an event taking place . that is , a contribution @xmath54",
    "will instead be accumulated as @xmath55 with @xmath56 the probability that at least one spawning attempt from @xmath16 to @xmath15 is successful on a given iteration . depending on whether integer or non - integer walkers",
    "are considered , this probability is given by @xmath57 with @xmath29 the instantaneous walker population residing on @xmath16 and @xmath3 the probability that no walker is spawned between @xmath16 and @xmath15 in a single attempt .",
    "for an integer spawning event , this probability is @xmath58 but this must be modified in the case of continuous spawning to @xmath59 where @xmath30 is the continuous spawning threshold , if used .",
    "a nave implementation of the above sampling is satisfactory for the accumulation of approximate density matrices , but is beset by a number of shortcomings which should be considered.@xcite as contributions to the off - diagonal matrix elements are only added upon a successful spawning attempt , problems can arise when the spawning events are discretised . in this case , the probability that such an event occurs is proportional to the coupling hamiltonian matrix element , @xmath60 , and pairs of determinants which are connected by large matrix elements are correspondingly sampled more often than pairs which are only weakly coupled .",
    "thus , if two highly - weighted determinants contained in the stochastically - sampled , integer walker space are connected by a small hamiltonian element , their contribution to the density matrices may be severely under - represented , or neglected entirely .",
    "this problem is most notably in evidence in the case of single excitations of the reference determinant , for which the coupling matrix elements are strictly zero according the brillouin s theorem .",
    "this is countered in the present implementation by accounting for these contributions to the density matrices explicitly , and hence removing the dependence upon a successful spawning event .",
    "other contributions , however , whose sampling will still be proportional to the reduced hamiltonian,@xcite defined in terms of the one- and two - electron integrals , @xmath61 and @xmath62 , as @xmath63 will give rise to an biasing error in density matrices in the long-@xmath24 limit for determinant pairs where @xmath64 , but whose amplitudes are both significantly non - zero . however , modifications to the algorithm to treat the bias remaining beyond that already defined by brillouin s theorem explicitly  such as introducing additional events to spawn walkers proportionally to the inverse of the hamiltonian element  have been shown to be of little additional benefit due to the negligible nature of this bias in numerical studies to date.@xcite    in a separate difficulty , it has been shown previously that a straightforward implementation of the above sampling gave rise to a convergence of the density matrices with increasing @xmath65 which was rather slower than that of , say , the projected energy .",
    "this behaviour stems not simply from undersampling , but rather from a bias in the statistical sampling technique itself .",
    "in particular , appropriate contributions to the matrix elements are approximated by @xmath66 ignoring the potentially significant covariance , @xmath67 , between the two amplitudes and introducing a bias , whether or not the averaged walker populations are themselves unbiased .",
    "it is , to that end , unsurprising that this problem is at its greatest for diagonal elements , for which the `` two '' amplitudes are perfectly correlated , and  the error being of a single sign  there is no possibility of error cancellation .",
    "this problem is rather more serious than the previous concerns over discretised spawning , but one for which a rather simple solution exists .",
    "unbiased density matrices can be calculated with the introduction of a second , uncorrelated walker ensemble , to which the stochastic spawning , death , and annihilation steps are applied independently , and whose statistics are acquired separately , from the first.@xcite this adaptation , known as replica sampling , achieves the unbiasing by ensuring that all the products of determinant amplitudes are calculated using populations from both simulations , and has previously found application in the stochastic sampling of the @xmath8-electron density matrix known as density matrix quantum monte carlo,@xcite and the recently - introduced krylov - projected quantum monte carlo.@xcite that is , for example , a successful spawning event from @xmath16 to @xmath15 in replica @xmath27 , occurring with a probability @xmath68 , gives rise to a contribution of : @xmath69 this approach bears some conceptual similarity with the bilinear sampling algorithm in green s function monte carlo , introduced by zhang and kalos , in that both seek a means of finding expectation values of operators which do not commute with the hamiltonian , _ via _ two sets of independent walker distributions.@xcite the main difference , though , is that the bilinear approach transforms the schrdinger equation such that there are two related wavefunctions to sample , while in the present work the walker ensembles are independent samples of the same underlying object . in providing a stochastically unbiased route to the density matrices , the replica sampling technique thus provides the first realistic opportunity to achieve high - accuracy _ ab initio _",
    "results for the sizeable suite of properties that can be derived therefrom .",
    "the force acting on a nucleus in a molecule or cluster is defined as the negative gradient of the molecular energy with respect to the nuclear coordinates : @xmath70 in eq .",
    "the symbol @xmath71 denotes the nuclear force vector , @xmath72 the energy of a molecule at a fixed geometry in the electronic ground state , and @xmath73 refers to the vector of nuclear coordinates in the centre of mass frame of reference .",
    "a comprehensive review of techniques and explicit expressions to compute derivatives of the electronic energy with respect to nuclear coordinates is available in the literature.@xcite the following discussion is thus limited to the basic concepts for the calculation of nuclear forces using all - electron fci wavefunctions as obtained as a statistical average using the method , once the calculation has been converged with respect to the number of walkers . in the present work ,",
    "we have adjusted the total number of walkers to achieve a walker population of 50000 at the reference ( i.e.  highest populated ) determinant .",
    "preceding work confirmed that , at such a population levels , noise arising from small stochastic populations of random determinants is sufficiently suppressed and the wavefunction converged .",
    "the first derivative of the electronic energy of a ci wavefunction generally depends on the derivatives of the atomic orbitals ( aos ) and the molecular - orbital ( mo ) and ci coefficients .",
    "all these terms depend upon the nuclear coordinates , and the computation of nuclear forces requires knowledge of the first derivatives with respect to all considered degrees of freedom .",
    "however , electronic wave functions obtained from @xmath0-fciqmc optimizations are variational with respect to the ci coefficients and a component @xmath74 of the nuclear force vector can be expressed in terms of the reduced density matrices as @xmath75 in which the terms @xmath61 represent the one - electron integrals from the hamiltonian , and @xmath76 is the contribution from the fixed nuclei .",
    "moreover , all - electron fci wavefunctions considered in this work are also invariant under variation of the mo coefficients .",
    "the nuclear forces can thus be expressed solely in terms of the one- and two - electron density matrices and the skeleton derivative integrals of the basis functions : @xmath77 where @xmath78 is an element of the lagrangian and @xmath79 is an element of the overlap matrix . in particular , neither the computation of derivatives of the ci hamiltonian matrix nor the solution of the coupled - perturbed hartree  fock equation for the derivatives of the mo coefficients are required .",
    "we have implemented an interface to ` molpro ` to compute the integrals and nuclear forces from the @xmath0-fciqmc density matrices.@xcite    as a first benchmark , we have applied the @xmath0-fciqmc methodology to compute the nuclear forces at several points along the dissociation curve of molecular nitrogen , as the electronic wavefunction changes from single- to strong multi - reference character .",

    "the accuracy of the @xmath0-fciqmc methodology for the computation of total energies was already evaluated @xcite , and we generally find excellent agreement between the @xmath0-fciqmc and fci data set .    in figure",
    "[ fig : n2 ] ( bottom ) , the nuclear forces for the same geometries are illustrated .",
    "comparison with fci results obtained from numerical gradients provides a direct measure of the quality of the reduced density matrices computed from the replica algorithm based on @xmath0-fciqmc , and , once again , the data shows excellent agreement between the analytic @xmath0-fciqmc forces and the fci results for all geometries .    o molecule computed using @xmath0-fciqmc and fci with a 6 - 31 g and cc - pvtz basis set ( the sign corresponds to the z - component of the force vector ) .",
    "the data were acquired for symmetric displacements of the hydrogen atoms from the equilibrium geometry .",
    "the abscissa indicates the oh bond length of the respective molecular geometry.,scaledwidth=40.0% ]    as second example for the calculation of analytic gradients and nuclear forces , we considered symmetric displacements of the atoms in a water molecule along the oh bonds . in a small 6 - 31 g basis set , exact ( fci ) diagonalisation of the hamiltonian matrix is still feasible and figure  [ fig : h2o ] illustrates results from fci reference and @xmath0-fciqmc calculations .",
    "the nuclear forces as shown in figure  [ fig : h2o ] have been obtained from the cartesian force vectors as the absolute force acting on either a hydrogen or the oxygen atom with the sign taken from the z - component of the force vector , which has been aligned with the symmetry principal axis .",
    "although there is no computational advantage over direct diagonalisation methods for basis sets as small as the 6 - 31 g basis , the replica algorithm implemented in @xmath0-fciqmc can be applied to much larger molecules and basis sets , providing essentially numerically exact nuclear forces . in order to demonstrate the scope of the @xmath0-fciqmc replica technology ,",
    "we have also computed the all - electron forces within a cc - pvtz basis set , evidently an infeasible task for current deterministic fci algorithms , where the many - body basis now spans @xmath81 $ ] determinants .",
    "figure  [ fig : h2o ] ( dashed lines ) illustrates the notably larger forces at intermediate stretching of the oh bonds if accurate cc - pvtz basis set are combined with this level of theory in the calculations .",
    "this would have implications for dynamics calculations , as well as providing the basis for highly accurate geometry optimisations for systems with electronic ground states of strong multi - reference character .",
    "the interaction of an electronic system of charge @xmath82 with an external electric field , @xmath83 , in an external potential , @xmath84 , may be expressed as an expansion in terms of multipoles , @xmath85 with @xmath86 the rank-1 dipole moment , @xmath87 the rank-2 quadrupole moment , and so on .",
    "it is the dipole moment itself with which we are presently concerned , and which may be calculated according to : @xmath88 where , in the last line , the substitution @xmath89 ( for electrons ) has been made .",
    "applying the slater ",
    "condon rules,@xcite this expression can be recast in terms of the one - body reduced density matrix and one - electron molecular - orbital integrals for an arbitrary cartesian component , @xmath90 , as , @xmath91 to which the contribution from the ( fixed ) nuclei with charges @xmath92 and positions @xmath93 has been added .",
    "thus , given the molecular - orbital integrals , @xmath94 , @xmath95 , and @xmath96 , which are readily available,@xcite the one - body reduced density matrix obtained from @xmath0-fciqmc provides direct access to the dipole moment , and , more generally , to multipole moments of arbitrary rank .    as an interesting application of this approach , we consider the well - known problem of the dipole moment of co at its equilibrium bond length , @xmath97.@xcite this system , with its subtle combination of @xmath67 and @xmath98 effects , is difficult to predict intuitively _ a priori _ , and hartree  fock theory notably suggests the polarity to be c@xmath99o@xmath100 , while it is experimentally known to be c@xmath100o@xmath99 .",
    "we use the large aug - cc - pv@xmath101z - dk basis sets for this study and adopt the second - order douglas  kroll ",
    "hess hamiltonian.@xcite although relativistic effects are small for these comparatively light atoms , the calculation of the dipole moment tends to be strongly basis - set dependent , and the use of a large set becomes correspondingly desirable .",
    "to that same end , it is desirable to be able to extrapolate finite - basis dipole moments to the complete - basis - set limit , as such extrapolations have previously been useful in @xmath0-fciqmc studies.@xcite it has been shown that the asymptotic convergence of the correlation part of the dipole moment with the cardinality of the basis set , @xmath101 , is suitably described by the form @xmath102 in much the same way as the correlation energy itself.@xcite the complete - basis - set limit correlation contribution to the dipole moment , @xmath103 , may thus be derived from two consecutive finite - basis results , of cardinality @xmath104 and @xmath101 , according to @xmath105 to which the hartree  fock contribution in a suitably large basis ( aug - cc - pv5z - dk is used here , for which @xmath106 ) may then be added to obtain the total dipole moment .",

    "the experimentally obtained bond length , @xmath97 , is used,@xcite and the @xmath110 electrons are held frozen and neither relaxed nor optimised for the response of an electric field .",
    "the signs are arranged such that @xmath111 indicates a c@xmath99o@xmath100 polarity , and thus all the post - hartree  fock methods successfully reproduce qualitative agreement with the observed dipole s direction . the @xmath0-fciqmc calculations were performed for @xmath112 hours on @xmath113 cores ( @xmath114d and t ) or @xmath115 cores ( @xmath114q ) using @xmath116 walkers , with the adjustable parameters @xmath39 , @xmath117 , @xmath42 , and @xmath118 , and the timstep allowed to vary dynamically to limit noisy walker growth .",

    "in addition to the most obvious extension of an ability to compute a larger range of properties for a wider variety of systems , there remain a number of theoretical and technical challenges to be addressed in future studies .",
    "perhaps the most pressing task is to extend this work to encompass results from open - shell systems , in which correlation effects are likely to be more important .",
    "moreover , if comparisons to experimental results are to be further sought and achieved for dipole moment properties , there is some motivation to explore larger basis sets with multiple levels of augmentation,@xcite which may be of particular use in better describing the more diffuse electron densities of finite - field calculations , and more generally in describing larger and heavier atoms of interest .",

    "<S> the matrices obtained from this approach are shown to be representative of full configuration - interaction quality , and hence provide a realistic opportunity to achieve high - quality results for a range of properties whose operators do not necessarily commute with the hamiltonian . a density - matrix formulated quasi - variational energy estimator having been already proposed and investigated , the present work extends the scope of the theory to take in studies of analytic nuclear forces , molecular dipole moments and polarisabilities , with extensive comparison to exact results where possible . </S>",
    "<S> these new results confirm the suitability of the sampling technique and , where sufficiently large basis sets are available , achieve close agreement with experimental values , expanding the scope of the method to new areas of investigation . </S>"
