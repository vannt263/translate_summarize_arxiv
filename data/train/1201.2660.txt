    "the @xmath4 quark is the heaviest known elementary particle and was discovered at the tevatron @xmath5 collider in 1995 by the cdf and dcollaboration @xcite at a mass of around @xmath6 .",
    "the production is dominated by the @xmath7 annihilation process with 85% as opposed to gluon - gluon fusion which contributes only 15% . both measurements presented here",
    "are performed using the @xmath8jets  channel , where one of the @xmath9 bosons ( stemming from the decay of the @xmath4 quarks ) decays leptonically .",
    "the other @xmath9 boson decays hadronically .",
    "the @xmath8jets  channel is a good compromise between signal and background contribution whilst having high event statistics .",
    "the branching fraction for top quarks decaying into @xmath10 is almost 100% .",
    "jets containing a beauty quark are identified by means of a neural network ( nn ) build by the combination of variables describing the properties of secondary vertices and of tracks with large impact parameters relative to the primary vertex .",
    "the measurement of the transverse momentum distribution of the top quarks @xcite selects events with an isolated lepton with a transverse momentum @xmath11 of at least @xmath12 and a pseudo - rapidity of @xmath13 ( @xmath14jets ) or @xmath15 ( @xmath16jets ) .",
    "a cut on the missing transverse energy ( @xmath17 ) of @xmath12 is applied .",
    "furthermore at least four jets are required with @xmath18 and @xmath19 , an additional cut of @xmath20 is applied for the leading jet .",
    "finally at least one jet needs to be identified as a @xmath21-jet . for the reconstruction of the event kinematics",
    "additional constraints are used : the masses of the two @xmath9 bosons are constrained to @xmath22 .",

    "all possible permutations of objects are considered where the final solution is the one with the smallest @xmath23 .",

    "all predictions use the proton parton density function ( pdf ) cteq61 with the scale set to @xmath24 ( @xmath25 ) except for the approximate nnlo perturbative qcd ( pqcd ) prediction which uses the mstw08 pdf .",
    "the normalization is nicely described by pqcd in ( n)nlo , however there is an offset for pythia and alpgen in normalization .",

    "the sm uncertainty reflects all systematic uncertainties , except for the luminosity uncertainty in each bin . especially the tail of @xmath30 is sensitive to broad enhancements as well as to narrow resonances , which is why the agreement between data and sm expectation has been evaluated .",
