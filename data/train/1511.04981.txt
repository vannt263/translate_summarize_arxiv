    "the formation of co in low - density interstellar clouds proceeds mainly through gas - phase chemical reactions involving h@xmath7 , and therefore detecting and measuring co spectral lines is one way to trace the molecular interstellar medium  ( ism ) in the region .",
    "while h@xmath7 rotational lines are difficult to observe from the ground , co is more easily detected as its rovibrational transitions can be observed as absorption in the ultraviolet  ( uv ) and near - infrared  ( nir ) and emission in the nir , far - infrared  ( fir ) , and submillimeter .",
    "the rotational energy level spacings of a diatomic molecule depend inversely on its moment of inertia , and the relatively large moment of inertia of co compared to h@xmath8 yields rotational levels with small energy separation .",
    "the lowest rotational transition of co has a wavelength of @xmath92.6  mm which gives an excitation temperature of just @xmath95.5  k. therefore , co can be collisionally excited to high rotational levels in photon - dominated regions ( pdrs ) , in shocks , and in other moderately energetic environments .    a number of co pure rotational lines starting at @xmath10 , where @xmath3 is the rotational quantum number , have been detected with the long - wavelength spectrometer  ( lws ) @xcite aboard the _ infrared space observatory _",

    "the spectral and photometric imaging receiver ( spire , * ? ? ? * ) aboard _ herschel _ has also probed the submillimeter molecular interstellar medium of m82 from @xmath17 up to @xmath18 @xcite .    the chemical and physical conditions where co resides are deduced from observed spectral lines , but it is often not appropriate to assume local thermodynamic equilibrium  ( lte ) when modeling these regions . in low - density environments where the level populations routinely depart from lte , collisional excitation rate coefficients with the dominant species  mainly h@xmath7 , h , he , and electrons  are necessary to accurately predict spectral line intensities .",
    "although the effect of electron collisions is minor , the role of collisional excitation of co by h , especially in environments such as diffuse molecular clouds @xcite and cool mixed atomic and molecular hydrogen gas @xcite , can not be neglected .",
    "rate coefficient calculations for pure rotational excitation of the first 15 rotational levels of the he - co system were performed by @xcite for the temperature range 5 to 500  k. @xcite calculated reliable h@xmath8-co rate coefficients for rotational transitions in co induced by both para- and ortho - h@xmath8 collisions for deexcitation from @xmath19 to all lower @xmath5 levels for temperatures between 1 and 3000  k. although the h - co system has been studied extensively with the most recent rate coefficients reported by @xcite , there is unsatisfactory agreement between the results obtained upon the various potential energy surfaces  ( pess ) .",
    "the earliest analysis of h - co collisions was performed by @xcite , who used a short - range , semi - empirical potential joined with a long - range buckingham potential to calculate cross sections via two close - coupling formulations .",
    "the resulting cross sections were found to be comparable to those of h@xmath7-co for small @xmath20 .",
    "the maxwellian - averaged rate coefficients were calculated for the temperature range of @xmath21  k. the following year , quantal calculations were carried out by @xcite over the same temperature range , but with a new semi - empirical potential and strikingly different results .",
    "these collisional rate coefficients were typically an order of magnitude smaller than those of @xcite , and small @xmath20 transitions , i.e. , @xmath22 @xmath23 1 or 2 , were reported to have much larger rate coefficients when compared to large @xmath20 transitions .",
    "the small magnitude of the h - co rate coefficients obtained by @xcite led to the neglect of h as a collider in co emission modeling .",

    "restricted hartree - fock calculations were carried out , followed by configuration interaction computations including all singly- and doubly - excited configurations .",

    "the _ ab initio _ electronic structure calculations were performed with the molpro program package @xcite using the internally contracted multireference configuration interaction ( icmrci ) method .",
    "resonance energies and widths from the wks surface agreed with experimental data @xcite , but striking differences were apparent in the collision cross sections obtained using the bbh and wks surfaces @xcite .",
    "the cross sections on the newer wks surface , especially for low-@xmath3 pure rotational transitions , yielded higher values than those calculated on the bbh surface .",
    "@xcite obtained similar results when they used both the bbh and the wks surfaces to compute collisional rate coefficients for temperatures in the range 5 to 3000  k. the discrepancy in the co(@xmath24 ) transition was the largest .",
    "however , @xcite performed explicit quantum - mechanical scattering calculations with the wks pes for the first eight pure rotational transitions ( using the close - coupling [ cc ] framework ) and first five vibrational levels ( in the infinite order sudden  [ ios ] approximation ) , and this complete set of rate coefficients has been extensively used in astrophysical models .",
