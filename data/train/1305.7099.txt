    "the @xmath0-quark mass  for instance , the @xmath8 running mass at renormalization scale @xmath9 @xmath10 or @xmath11   is  one of the fundamental parameters of the standard model and therefore its precise knowledge is highly desirable .",
    "the latest edition of the review of particle physics reports @xmath12 @xcite .",
    "a direct way to determine @xmath1 is by means of lattice qcd simulations ; however , since the physical @xmath0-quark is too heavy for current lattice setups , the determination of @xmath1 from pure lattice qcd requires either the extrapolation of the lattice results from lighter simulated masses or the use of the heavy - quark effective theory ( hqet ) formulated on the lattice . using the former approach ,",
    "the values @xmath13 @xcite and @xmath14 @xcite have recently been deduced , while the results @xmath15 @xcite , @xmath16 @xcite , and @xmath17 @xcite  have been determined adopting the hqet - based approach .",
    "all above findings have been obtained using unquenched gauge configurations with @xmath18 dynamical flavors in the sea .",
    "recently , more accurate determinations of the @xmath0-quark mass have been performed by exploiting moment sum rules for two - point functions of heavy ",
    "heavy currents : low-@xmath19 moment sum rules based on three - loop @xmath6 @xcite and four - loop @xmath20 @xcite fixed - order pqcd calculations combined with the experimental data yield @xmath21 @xcite and @xmath22 @xcite , respectively . the latter finding has been confirmed by a study based on a combination of perturbative qcd and lattice qcd simulations with @xmath23 dynamical flavors in the sea @xcite . combining  large-@xmath19 moments obtained within renormalization - group - improved nnll - order @xmath24 sum rules with the experimental data yields @xmath25 @xcite .    in this paper , we show that the borel qcd sum rules for heavy ",
    "light correlators provide the possibility to extract  the bottom - quark mass with comparable accuracy if a precise value for the @xmath2-meson decay constant @xmath5 is adopted as  input .",
    "let us first explore what degree of sensitivity of @xmath5 to the precise value of the @xmath0-quark mass can be expected on the basis of simple quantum - mechanical considerations .",
    "nonrelativistic potential models predict the following relationship between the ground - state wave function at the origin , @xmath26 and the ground - state binding energy @xmath27 : latexmath:[\\[\\begin{aligned } \\label{qm1 }    exact for any ground state in a purely coulomb or purely harmonic - oscillator potential ( or , to be more precise , in any model where the potential involves only one coupling constant ) .",
    "moreover , this relation proves to be a good approximation for ground states in potentials given by the sum of confining and coulomb interactions  @xcite .",
    "now , taking into account that the decay constant is the analogue of the wave function at the origin and incorporating the known scaling behaviour of the decay constant of a heavy meson in the heavy - quark limit @xcite  which should  work well for the beauty mesons  one obtains an approximate relation between the @xmath2-meson mass @xmath29 and the heavy - quark pole mass @xmath30 : @xmath31    keeping the ground - state mass fixed and equal to its experimental value @xmath32 , we can easily pin down the dependence of @xmath5 on small variations @xmath33 of the heavy - quark pole mass near some average value of @xmath30 . taking into account",
    "that @xmath34 for @xmath35 we end up with @xmath36 and @xmath37  or ,  equivalently , @xmath38 thus , the sensitivity of @xmath5 to the precise value of the heavy - quark mass should be rather high : a variation of  the  quark mass by @xmath39 entails @xmath40 clearly , a similar effect should be observable in the outcomes of qcd  sum rules @xcite .    recently , several qcd sum - rule analyses @xcite of beauty - meson decay constants relying on three - loop heavy ",
    "light correlators @xcite have been published , see table [ table:1 ] ( note that all results collected in table [ table:1 ] are obtained by applying  the qcd sum - rule method to essentially the same analytical expression for the correlator ) .",
    ".some recent qcd sum - rule predictions for @xmath5 from heavy  light two - point functions . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     figure [ plot :",
    "mb]c presents the extracted values of @xmath1 depending on the number of terms kept in the perturbative part of the correlator . moving from @xmath41 ( lo ) to @xmath42 ( nlo ) accuracy of the perturbative expansion",
    "has two effects :  first ,  the central @xmath1 value decreases sizeably from @xmath43 to @xmath44 and , second , the ope - error also reduces considerably .",
    "adding the @xmath6 ( nnlo ) correction does not , however , entail a sizeable  change of the predictions : @xmath45 obviously , the extracted values of  @xmath1 exhibit a nice `` convergence '' depending on the accuracy of the perturbative correlation function .",
    "the ope error in the extracted @xmath46 is related to the variations of the ope parameters in the ranges given in ( [ table:2 ] ) and the independent variations of the scales @xmath47 and @xmath48 in the range 3 gev @xmath49 6 gev .",
    "the individual contributions to the ope error read : 14 mev ( @xmath47 , @xmath48 ) , 20 mev ( quark condensate ) , 7 mev ( gluon condensate ) , 8 mev ( @xmath50 ) , and 4 mev ( light - quark mass ) . adding these values in the quadrature",
    "gives 27 mev .",
    "the systematic uncertainty in the extracted value of @xmath1 is found as the spread of the  results for different anstze for the effective continuum threshold and amounts to 11 mev . to obtain the final estimate for @xmath1 one should further add the ( gaussian ) error 18 mev , related to the uncertainty in the lattice value of @xmath51 mev .",
    "the @xmath20 correction to the perturbative spectral density is , at present , not known .",
    "nevertheless , on the basis  of  our findings we do not expect a sizeable shift of the central value of @xmath1 due to the inclusion of the @xmath20 correction .",
    "one , however , might expect a reduction of the sensitivity of the extracted value of @xmath1 to the precise values of the scales @xmath47 and @xmath48 and thus a further increase of the accuracy of the extracted value of the bottom - quark mass .",
    "we performed a detailed qcd sum - rule analysis of the @xmath2- and @xmath52-meson decay constants , with particular emphasis on the study of the errors in the extracted decay - constant values : the ope uncertainty due to the errors of the qcd parameters and the intrinsic error of the sum - rule approach due to the limited accuracy of the extraction procedure .",
    "our main findings may be summarized by the following observations :    1 .",
    "the choice of the renormalization scheme used to define the heavy - quark mass is crucial for the convergence of the perturbative expansion of the two - point function : the latter exhibits in its pole - mass formulation no sign of convergence but develops in its running - mass formulation a clear hierarchy of the perturbative contributions . for the extracted decay constant ,",
    "the pole - mass result is sizeably smaller than its running - mass counterpart ,  albeit both enjoy a perfect stability in the borel parameter .",
    "borel stability does not imply reliability of sum - rule  results .",
    "the extraction of hadronic properties is significantly improved by allowing a borel - parameter dependence for the effective continuum threshold , which then quite naturally increases the accuracy of the duality approximation .",
    "as shown already before in the charmed - meson sector @xcite , considering suitably optimized polynomial anstze for the effective continuum threshold provides an estimate  of the intrinsic uncertainty of the method of qcd sum rules .",
    "3 .   for beauty mesons , a very strong correlation between the exact @xmath1 value and the sum - rule result for @xmath5",
    "is found : @xmath53 this enables us to revert the problem and to make use of the precise lattice - qcd computations of @xmath5 to extract the value of @xmath1 . combining our sum - rule analysis with the latest results for @xmath5 and @xmath54 from lattice qcd  yields",
    "@xmath55 the ope error is related to the uncertainties in the ope input parameters , and the `` exp '' error is induced by the error in the lattice determination of @xmath5 .",
    "news is that the systematic uncertainty of the sum - rule method , estimated from the spread of the results for different anstze of the effective continuum threshold , amounts to @xmath56 and remains under control .",
    "adding all three error in quadrature yields our final estimate @xmath57 with ( [ ourmb1 ] ) , the qcd sum rules for heavy ",
    "light correlators evaluated at @xmath6 accuracy yield , for the decay  constants , @xmath58 our algorithm enables us to provide both the ope uncertainties and the intrinsic ( systematic ) uncertainty  of  the sum - rule method related to the limited accuracy of the extraction procedure .",
    "we observe an extreme sensitivity of the decay constant to the input value of the quark mass , but only for beauty mesons .",
    "it is not observed in  the charm sector , where one finds @xmath59 @xcite .",
    "therefore , the extracted value of @xmath60 is rather  mildly sensitive to the precise value of @xmath61 in the charm sector , on the other hand , one observes a stronger sensitivity  of the extracted value of @xmath60 to the algorithm adopted for fixing the @xmath62-dependent effective continuum threshold  @xcite .",
    "our value ( [ ourmb ] ) of @xmath1 is extracted from the borel qcd sum rule for the heavy ",
    "light correlator known to @xmath6 accuracy . taking into account that the value of @xmath1 is changing only marginally when moving from the @xmath42  to @xmath6 accuracy of the correlator , we do not expect that the inclusion of the presently unknown @xmath20 correction will lead to a substantial change in the extracted value of @xmath1 .",
    "our result is compatible with the result @xcite @xmath63 found from moment sum rules for heavy ",
    "heavy correlators known to the same @xmath6 accuracy as in our  analysis .",
    "we observe an excellent agreement with the prediction of the rg - improved nnll analysis of the @xmath24 sum rule  @xcite , @xmath64 our result agrees within 2@xmath65 with the pdg estimate @xmath66 we realize , however , a pronounced tension with the predictions of @xcite @xmath67 and @xcite @xmath68 based on sum rules for heavy  heavy correlators calculated to @xmath20 accuracy .",
    "as already noticed above , it seems unlikely that the @xmath20 correction may bring our result in agreement with the relatively low value of  @xcite ; therefore , we expect that this tension will persist .",
    "the origin of this disagreement requires further  considerations .",
    "we conclude by emphasizing that the properly formulated borel qcd sum rules for heavy  light correlators provide a competitive tool for the reliable calculation of heavy - meson properties and for the extraction of basic qcd parameters by making use of the results from lattice qcd and the experimental data .",
    "we point out that in the context of qcd sum rules based on correlation functions calculated at @xmath6 accuracy , eq .",
