    "such equilibrium exploration of the environment will result in a long time to find the food source , especially when ` food ' is far relative to the step size of the random walker and the bias is small .",
    "instead , consider `` active exploration '' : after the random walker has randomly decided to take a step backwards , the walker can randomly decide to make the size of the backward motion large compared to the usual step size .",
    "such a large step is allowed to reverse a finite fraction of the displacement from ` home ' . the initiation and termination of such a reversal are analogous to catastrophes and rescues discussed earlier in the context of proofreading ; in particular , the length of such reversals is related to the balance of catastrophe and rescue rates .",
    "`` active exploration '' can be thought of as exploration with alternate statistics of returns ` home ' but with no greater intrinsic bias towards ` food ' .",
    "nevertheless , search is greatly enhanced by tuning the active component of the exploration statistics to the localization - delocalization transition .",
    "in such a regime , even if the bias is weak and the variations in catastrophe rates in space is small , the net effect of such a change on large scale motion can be dramatic .",
    "trajectories that head in the wrong direction have catastrophic reversals at a rate that is just high enough to localize the walker at ` home ' . on the other hand , trajectories in the right direction",
    "might begin similarly biased towards ` home ' but have a falling catastrophe rate as they proceeds towards ` food ' .",
    "once the catastrophe rate falls below a threshold , the walker moves rapidly forward and finds the ` food ' .",
    "` food ' is effectively brought closer to the walker , positioned at a point where the catastrophe rate falls below a threshold .",
    "microtubules are thought to face a similar problem in the search for chromosomes ( or centromeres ) during mitotic spindle assembly @xcite .",
    "the framework of dynamical phase coexistence emphasized in this review suggests that the search for chromosomes is greatly sped up when microtubule growth is posed close to phase coexistence between ` bounded ' and ` unbounded ' growth , i.e. , when the rate of catastrophes is comparable to the rate of rescues . in this limit",
    ", even a weak gradient of molecules that can modulate the catastrophe rate can have a dramatic impact on large scale motions .",
    "evidence for such molecular mechanisms that can modulate catastrophe rates has emerged in recent years @xcite .      within the context of proofreading ,",
    "recent work @xcite has classified proofreading schemes by whether the difference between right and wrong substrates is encoded in differing binding energies ( as in the original papers @xcite ) or in the heights of activation barriers ( as in subsequent work by bennett @xcite ) .",
    "the latter models can be described by eqn .",
    "[ eqn : nue ] if binding energy @xmath13 is replaced by the height of an activation barrier in the network . while small networks have been studied by @xcite ,",
    "the response of large generic networks to changes in activation barriers remains unexplored .",
    "many biochemical systems might well rely on such discrimination coded in activation barriers @xcite .",
    "spent in such signaling states .",
    "the receptor can measure concentrations accurately by expending free energy ( e.g. , coupling atp hydrolysis along the ring shown ) and reducing the variance of @xmath87 . a particularly favorable regime of highly enhanced accuracy at a small free energy cost ( in the sense of fig .",
    "[ fig : jsp_tradeoffs]b ) might be obtained by tuning the network at coexistence between localized and delocalized phases .",
    "[ fig : bp ] ]      exploring the tradeoffs between entropy consumption and the ability of a biochemical apparatus to sense concentrations has been a topic of recent interest  @xcite . a recent paper by lang et al  @xcite puts forward a general phenomenological model ( fig .",
    "[ fig : bp ] ) to understand the tradeoffs between concentration sensing and entropy consumption .",
    "the model system is composed of a non signaling chemical state coupled to an array of signaling states .",
    "the rates for transition between signaling and non signaling states depends on the concentration of the ligand .",
    "the transition from the non signaling state to the signaling states is driven by ligand binding events . for constant rates @xmath88 and @xmath89 for transitions between the signaling states , the network in fig  [ fig : bp ] ( and its generalizations with additional signaling states )",
    "qualitatively supports the same dynamical phases described in the previous sections  @xcite .",
    "the transition rates between the non - signaling and the signaling links play the role of the heterogeneity or the @xmath54 link .    the concentration of the ligand can be inferred from measurements of the time spent by the system in the signaling states .",
    "the uncertainty in the concentration measured has been worked out to be  @xcite @xmath90\\ ] ] where @xmath91 is the number of ligand binding events , @xmath92 is the mean time spent in the signaling state after binding a ligand and @xmath93 is the variance of the time spent in the signaling states .",
    "can the variance of the time spent in the signaling states , and hence the uncertainty , be reduced at the cost of energy consumption ?",
    "lang et al  @xcite find this to be case .",
    "in fact , they find a trade - off curve resembling fig .",
    "[ fig : jsp_tradeoffs]b where a large reduction in uncertainty can obtained at a small energy cost followed by a regime of small further reductions in uncertainty at a large energy cost .",
    "this analogy suggests that tradeoffs similar to those discussed here for kinetic proofreading and search strategies might be accessible to signaling networks .",
    "a signaling network at the cusp of dynamic phase transition can remain localized near the non signaling states in the absence of any ligand binding events . a minor perturbation , such as a ligand binding event ,",
    "can induce the system to undergo a transition to the delocalized signaling state .",
    "the trade - off between reliability of the concentration readout and entropy consumption might be optimal closer to such a coexistence point .",
    "additional support for the unifying theme of dynamical phases comes from recent work on variable sensitivity and programmability of concentration sensing @xcite .",
    "@xcite found that the sensitivity to concentrations can be modulated , closely paralleling variable proofreading regimes found in @xcite .",
    "the parallels extend to  anti - proofreading regimes of @xcite where the response to changing binding energies ( or ligand binding in @xcite ) is reduced as compared to equilibrium . in @xcite ,",
    "some of these  anti - proofreading regimes were interpreted in terms of modular sub - networks which can in turn be interpreted as designer phase coexistence .",
    "the general relationship between modular design of non - equilibrium mechanisms and dynamical phases deserves further study .",
    "non - equilibrium driving forces also play important roles in sensory adaptation  @xcite and ultra sensitivity  @xcite .",
    "the framework of localized and de - localized phases might indeed apply to these other processes .",
    "the localized phases can be a generic route used by biochemical systems to reinforce information encoded in the equilibrium landscape .",
    "consider for instance ultra sensitive switches @xcite found in e. coli chemotaxis and other biochemical signaling motifs .",
    "existing modeling approaches rely on an equilibrium allosteric framework .",
    "however , recent experimental @xcite and theoretical results  @xcite suggest that non - equilibrium forces might play a crucial role in ultra sensitive switches the landscape imposed by the equilibrium allosteric interactions can be reinforced with non equilibrium fluxes in a localized phase .",
    "further an ultra sensitive switch positioned at the cusp of a dynamic phase transition can fruitfully utilize non equilibrium driving forces to rapidly go between different dynamical regimes .",
    "indeed , the enhanced fluctuations in the ultra sensitive e. coli flagella motor as it switches from the clockwise rotational mode to the counter clockwise rotation mode is reminiscent of a delocalized state",
    ". it will be interesting to study well characterized ultra sensitive systems and investigate whether dynamical phase transitions serve as an important organizing principle .",
