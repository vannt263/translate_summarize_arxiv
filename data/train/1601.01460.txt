    "the epoch of gravitational wave astronomy has now begun with the first detection @xcite of the merger of binary black holes by advanced ligo @xcite . now that the first ground based gravitational wave detection has been achieved , observations of binary neutron star mergers should soon be forthcoming .",
    "this is particularly true as other second generation observatories such as advanced virgo @xcite and kagra @xcite will soon be online .",
    "in addition to binary black holes , neutron - star binaries are thought to be among the best candidate sources gravitational radiation @xcite . the number of such systems detectable by advanced ligo is estimated @xcite to be of order several events per year based upon observed close binary - pulsar systems @xcite .",
    "there is a difference between neutron - star mergers and black hole mergers , however , in that neutron star mergers involve the complex evolution of the matter hydrodynamic equations in addition to the strong gravity field equations .",
    "hence , one must carefully consider both the hydrodynamic and field evolution of these systems .    to date",
    "there have been numerous attempts to calculate theoretical templates for gravitational waves from compact binaries based upon numerical and/or analytic approaches ( see for example @xcite ) . however , most approaches utilize a combination of post - newtonian ( pn ) techniques supplemented with quasi - circular orbit calculations and then applying full gr for only the last few orbits before disruption . in this paper",
    "we review the status of the hydrodynamic evolution in the spatially conformally flat metric approximation ( cfa ) as a means to compute stable initial conditions beyond the range of validity of the pn regime , i.e near the last stable orbits .",
    "we establish the numerical stability of this approach based upon many orbit simulations of quasi - circular orbits .",
    "we also illustrate the equation of state ( eos ) dependence of the initial conditions and associated gravitational wave emission .",
    "when binary neutron stars are well separated , the post - newtonian ( pn ) approximation is sufficiently accurate @xcite . in the pn scheme , the stars are often treated as point masses , either with or without spin . at third order , for example , it has been estimated @xcite that the errors due to assuming the stars are point masses is less than one orbital rotation @xcite over the @xmath1 cycles that pass through the ligo detector frequency band @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , it has been noted in many works @xcite that relativistic hydrodynamic effects might be evident even at the separations ( @xmath2 km ) relevant to the ligo window .    indeed , the templates generated by pn approximations , unless carried out to fifth and sixth order @xcite , may not be accurate unless the finite size and proper fluid motion of the stars is taken into account .",
    "in essence , the signal emitted during the last phases of inspiral depends on the finite size and eos through the tidal deformation of the neutron stars and the cut - off frequency when tidal disruption occurs .",
    "numeric and analytic simulations @xcite of binary neutron stars have explored the approach to the innermost stable circular orbit ( isco ) .",
    "while these simulations represent some of the most accurate to date , simulations generally follow the evolution for a handful of orbits and are based upon initial conditions of quasi - circular orbits obtained in the conformally flat approximation .",
    "accurate templates of gravitational radiation require the ability to stably and reliable calculate the orbit initial conditions .",
    "the cfa provides a means to obtain accurate initial conditions near the isco .",
    "the spatially conformally flat approximation to gr was first developed in detail in @xcite .",
    "that original formulation , however , contained a mathematical error first pointed out by flanagan @xcite and subsequently corrected in @xcite .",
    "this error in the solution to the shift vector led to a spurious ns crushing prior to merger .",
    "the formalism discussed below is for the corrected equations . here",
    ", we discuss the hydrodynamic solutions as developed in @xcite .",
    "this cfa formalism includes much of the nonlinearity inherent in gr and leads set of coupled , nonlinear , elliptic field equations that can be evolved stably .",
    "we also note that an alternative spectral method solution to the cfa configurations was developed by @xcite , and approaches beyond the cfa have also been proposed @xcite",
    ". however , our purpose here is to review the viability of the hydrodynamic solution without the imposition of a killing vector or special symmetry .",
    "this approach is the most adaptable , for example , to general initial conditions such as that of arbitrarily elliptical orbits and/or arbitrarily spinning neutron stars .",
    "here , we review the original cfa approach and associated general relativistic hydrodynamics formalism developed in @xcite and illustrate that it can produce stable initial conditions anywhere between the post - newtonian to isco regimes .",
    "we quantify how long this method takes to converge to quasiequilibrium and demonstrate the stability by subsequently integrating up to @xmath0 orbits for a binary neutron star system .",
    "we also analyze the eos dependence of these quasi - circular initial orbits and show how these orbits can be used to make preliminary estimates of the gravitational wave signal for the initial conditions .",
    "this review is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "the basic method is summarized and in section 3 a number of code tests are performed in the quasi - equilibrium circular orbit limit to demonstrate the stability of the technique .",
    "the eos dependence of the initial conditions and associated gravitational wave frequency and binding energy of various systems is analyzed in section 4 .",
    "conclusions are presented in section 5 .",
    "the solution of the field equations and hydrodynamic equations of motion were first solved in three spatial dimensions and explained in detail in the 1990 s in @xcite and subsequently further reviewed in @xcite . here",
    ", we present a brief summary to introduce the variables relevant to the present discussion .",
    "one starts with the slicing of spacetime into the usual one - parameter family of hypersurfaces separated by differential displacements in a time - like coordinate as defined in the ( 3 + 1 ) adm formalism @xcite .",
    "in cartesian @xmath3 isotropic coordinates , proper distance is expressed as @xmath4 where the lapse function @xmath5 describes the differential lapse of proper time between two hypersurfaces .",
    "the quantity @xmath6 is the shift vector denoting the shift in space - like coordinates between hypersurfaces .",
    "the curvature of the metric of the 3-geometry is described by a position dependent conformal factor @xmath7 times a flat - space kronecker delta ( @xmath8 ) .",
    "this conformally flat condition ( together with the maximal slicing gauge , @xmath9 ) requires @xcite , @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the extrinsic curvature tensor and @xmath12 are 3-space covariant derivatives",
    ". this conformally flat condition on the metric provides a numerically valid initial solution to the einstein equations .",
    "the vanishing of the weyl tensor for a stationary system in three spatial dimensions guarantees that a conformally flat solution to the einstein equations exists .",
    "one consequence of this conformally - flat approximation to the three - metric is that the emission of gravitational radiation is not explicitly evolved .",
    "nevertheless , one can extract the gravitational radiation signal and the back reaction via a multipole expansion @xcite .",
    "an application to the determination of the gravitational wave emission from the quasi - circular orbits computed here is given in @xcite .",
    "the advantage of this approximation is that conformal flatness stabilizes and simplifies the solution to the field equations .    as a third gauge condition",
    ", one can choose separate coordinate transformations for the shift vector and the hydrodynamic grid velocity to separately minimize the field and matter motion with respect to the coordinates .",
    "this set of gauge conditions is key to the present application .",
    "it allows one to stably evolve up to hundreds and even thousands of binary orbits without the numerical error associated with the frequent advecting of fluid through the grid .",
    "given a distribution of mass and momentum on some manifold , then one first solves the constraint equations of general relativity at each time for a fixed distribution of matter .",
    "one then evolves the hydrodynamic equations to the next time step .",
    "thus , at each time slice a solution to the relativistic field equations and information on the hydrodynamic evolution is obtained .",
    "the solutions for the field variables @xmath13 , @xmath5 , and @xmath14 reduce to simple poisson - like equations in flat space .",
    "the hamiltonian constraint @xcite , is used to solve for the conformal factor @xmath13 @xcite , @xmath15~. \\label{phi}\\ ] ] in the newtonian limit , the rhs is dominated @xcite by the proper matter density @xmath16 , but in strong fields and compact neutron stars there are also contributions from the internal energy density @xmath17 , pressure @xmath18 , and extrinsic curvature .",

    "this factor , @xmath19 , becomes important near the last stable orbit as the specific kinetic energy of the stars rapidly increases .    in a similar manner @xcite ,",
    "the hamiltonian constraint , together with the maximal slicing condition , provides an equation for the lapse function , @xmath23    - 2 \\rho(1 + \\epsilon ) + 3 p   + \\frac{7}{16\\pi } k_{ij}k^{ij}\\biggr]~. \\label{alpha}\\ ] ]    finally , the momentum constraints yields @xcite an elliptic equation for the shift vector @xcite , @xmath24 where @xmath25 here the @xmath26 are the spatial components of the momentum density one - form as defined below .",
    "we note that in early applications of this approach , the source for the shift vector contained a spurious term due to an incorrect transformation between contravariant and covariant forms of the momentum density as was pointed out in @xcite .",
    "as illustrated in those papers , this was the main reason why early hydrodynamic calculations induced a controversial additional compression on stars causing them to collapse to black holes prior to inspiral @xcite .",
    "this problem no longer exists in the formulation summarized here .      to solve for the fluid motion of the system in curved spacetime it is convenient to use an eulerian fluid description @xcite .",
    "one begins with the perfect fluid stress - energy tensor in the eulerian observer rest frame , @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the relativistic four velocity one - form .    by introducing the usual set of lorentz contracted state variables it is possible to write the relativistic hydrodynamic equations in a form which is reminiscent of their newtonian counterparts @xcite .",
    "the hydrodynamic state variables are : the coordinate baryon mass density , @xmath29 the coordinate internal energy density , @xmath30 the spatial three velocity , @xmath31 and the covariant momentum density , @xmath32    in terms of these state variables , the hydrodynamic equations in the cfa are as follows : the equation for the conservation of baryon number takes the form , @xmath33 the equation for internal energy evolution becomes , @xmath34~~.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] momentum conservation takes the form , @xmath35 where the last term in eq .",
    "( [ hydromom ] ) is the contribution from the radiation reaction potential @xmath36 as defined in @xcite . in the construction of quasi - stable orbit",
    "initial conditions , this term is set to zero . including this term would allow for a calculation of the orbital evolution via gravity - wave emission in the cfa . however , there is no guarantee that this is a sufficiently accurate solution to the exact einstein equations .",
    "hence , the cfa is most useful for the construction of initial conditions .      in the quasi - circular orbit approximation ( neglecting angular momentum in the radiation field ) , this system has a killing vector corresponding to rotation in the orbital plane .",
    "hence , for these calculations the angular momentum is well defined and given by an integral over the space - time components of the stress - energy tensor @xcite , i.e. , @xmath37 aligning the @xmath38 axis with the angular momentum vector then gives , @xmath39    to find the orbital frequency detected by a distant observer corresponding to a fixed angular momentum we employ a slightly modified derivation of the orbital frequency than that of @xcite . in",
    "asymptotically flat coordinates the angular frequency detected by a distant observer is simply the coordinate angular velocity , i.e. , one evaluates @xmath40    in the adm conformally flat ( 3 + 1 ) curved space , our only task is then to deduce @xmath41 from code coordinates . for this",
    "we make a simple polar coordinate transformation keeping our conformally flat coordinates , so @xmath42 now , the code uses covariant four velocities , @xmath43 .",
    "this gives @xmath44 .",
    "finally , one must density weight and volume average @xmath45 over the fluid differential volume elements .",
    "this gives , @xmath46/(x^2 + y^2 ) }          { \\int d^3 x \\phi^6 ( d + \\gamma e ) } .\\ ] ] this form differs slightly from that of @xcite , but leads to very similar results .    a key additional ingredient , however , is the implementation of a grid three velocity @xmath47 that minimizes the matter motion with respect to @xmath22 and @xmath6 .",
    "hence , the total angular frequency to a distant observer @xmath48 , and in the limit of rigid co - rotation , @xmath49 , where @xmath50 .    for the orbit calculations illustrated here we model corotating stars , i.e. no spin in the corotating frame .",
    "this minimizes matter motion on the grid .",
    "however , we note that there is need at the present time of initial conditions for arbitrarily spinning neutron stars and the method described here is equally capable of supplying those initial conditions .    as a practical approach",
    "the simulation @xcite of initial conditions is best run first with viscous damping in the hydrodynamics for sufficiently long time ( a few thousand cycles ) to relax the stars to a steady state .",
    "one can then run with no damping . in the present illustration",
    "we examine stars at large separation that are in quasi - equilibrium circular orbits and stable hydrodynamic configurations .",
    "these orbits span the time from the last several minutes up to orbit inspiral . here",
    ", we illustrate the stability of the multiple orbit hydrodynamic simulation and examine where the initial conditions for the strong field orbit dynamics computed here deviates from the post - newtonian regime .",
    "to evolve stars at large separation distance it is best @xcite to decompose the grid into a high resolution domain with a fine matter grid around the stars and a coarser domain with an extended grid for the fields .",
    "figure  [ simgrid ] shows a schematic of this decomposition from @xcite .    ]",
    "as noted in @xcite it is best to keep the number of zones across each star between @xmath51 and @xmath52 @xcite .",
    "this keeps the error in the numerics below @xmath53 .",
    "it has also been pointed out @xcite that an artificial viscosity ( av ) shock capturing scheme has an advantage over riemann solvers in that only about half as many zones are required to accurately resolve the stars when an av scheme is employed compared to a riemann solver .",
    "figure  [ courcon ] shows a plot of orbital velocity vs.  time for various courant parameters .",
    "this figure establishes that the routines for the hydrodynamics are stable ( e.g. changing the courant condition has little to effect ) as long as @xmath54 .",
    "figure  [ denvszon ] illustrates the central density vs.  number of zones across the star when calculated with the mw eos , i.e the zero temperature , zero neutrino chemical potential eos used to model core - collapse supernovae @xcite .",
    "this figure illustrates that here is only a @xmath55 error in central density with @xmath56 zones across the star , while increasing the number of zones across the star to @xmath57 produces less than a @xmath58 . in the illustrations below we maintain @xmath59 and @xmath60 zones across each star as the best choice for both speed and accuracy needed to compute stable orbital initial conditions .     vs.  time for different values of the courant parameter @xmath61 .",
    "as can be seen , the simulations with @xmath62 result in stable runs that converge to the same value , implying that a smaller @xmath61 , or equivalently a smaller @xmath63 , is not necessary and would only use extra cpu time . for comparison",

    "the orbits were followed for nearly 100 orbits .",

    "one can see that only orbits with @xmath82 @xmath81 are stable .",

    "one conclusion that may be drawn from the above set of simulations , however , is that the initial data must be evolved for ample time ( @xmath99 orbit ) for the stars to reach a true quasi - equilibrium binary configuration .",
    "that has not always been done in the literature .",
    "one hope in the forthcoming detections of gravitational waves is that a sensitivity exists to the neutron star equation of state . for illustration in this review",

    ", a striking feature of figure [ fvd ] is that as the stars approach the isco , the frequency varies more slowly with diminishing separation distance for the softer equations of state .",

    "at least part of the difference between the soft and stiff eoss can be attributed to the effects of the finite size of the stars which is more compact for the soft equations of state .",

    "we note that , for comparable angular momenta , our results are consistent with the eos sensitivity study of @xcite based upon a set of equations of state parameterized by a segmented polytropic indices and an overall pressure scale .",
