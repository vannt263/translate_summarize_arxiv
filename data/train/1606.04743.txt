    "the recent discovery of non - zero @xmath0 in reactor  @xcite and accelerator  @xcite neutrino experiments has opened a new window for neutrino oscillation studies . with relatively large @xmath0 , the unknown neutrino mass hierarchy ( i.e.",
    ", the sign of @xmath1 or @xmath2 ) and lepton cp violation are anticipated to be measured in the near future .",
    "the determination of the neutrino mass hierarchy ( mh ) is applicable in the long - baseline accelerator neutrino experiments  @xcite , atmospheric neutrino experiments  @xcite , and medium baseline reactor antineutrino experiments @xcite .",
    "the jiangmen underground neutrino observatory ( juno ) is a multipurpose liquid scintillator ( ls ) neutrino experiment , whose primary goal is to determine the neutrino mass hierarchy and measure the oscillation parameters at the sub - percent level using reactor antineutrino oscillations  @xcite .",
    "the layout of the juno experiment  @xcite is shown in fig .",
    "[ location ] , where the experimental site is located at jiangmen in south china , @xmath353 km away from the yangjiang and taishan reactor complexes , which are planed to have six reactor cores of 2.9 gw@xmath4 and four reactor cores of 4.6 gw@xmath4 , respectively .",
    "juno will build a ls detector of 20 kton with the 3%/@xmath5 energy resolution .",
    "the detector is planed to be located in an experimental hall with the overburden of larger than 700 meters for the purpose of reducing the muon - induced backgrounds .    [ cols=\"^ \" , ]     juno will deploy a ls detector of 20 kton in the underground experimental hall .",
    "the total overburden is @xmath3700 m rock .",
    "the baseline design of the juno detector system is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : detector ] , which consists of the central detector ( cd ) , the veto detectors and the systems for calibration , electronics , data acquisition and detector control  @xcite .",
    "the cd , which contains 20 kton ls , 17,000 20-inch pmts and upto 34,000 3-inch pmts , is designed to reach the energy resolution of 3%/@xmath6 and the lifetime of over 20 years .",
    "the cd  @xcite is an acrylic sphere of 35.4 m in diameter supported by stainless - steel structures , where the acrylic sphere will be built from hundreds of acrylic sheets with a thickness of 12 cm using the bulk - polymerization technology .",
    "the pmt assembly design including water sealing , implosion protection and installation on the detector is in progress , and a prototype to study the performance of pmts is under operation . the cd is filled with ls serving as the neutrino detection target . the current ls recipe is linear alkyl benzene ( lab ) as the solvent , with ppo as the scintillation fluor and bis - msb as the wavelength - shifter .",
    "the veto detector system consists of a water cherenkov ( wc ) detector and a top tracker using for the muon detection and muon induced background reduction .",
    "the wc detector is a pool filled with purified water and instrumented with pmts surrounding the cd",
    ". the opera target tracker will be re - used as the top tracker to reconstruct the direction of cosmic muons .",
    "the 20-inch pmts are mounted on a spherical surface of @xmath340 m in diameter , covering @xmath375% of the surface area of the sphere .",
    "the total number of inward facing pmts to detect scintillating photons generated in the cd is @xmath317,000 .",
    "in addition , upto 34,000 3-inch pmts will fill the gaps among the large pmts in order to improve the energy and vertex resolution .    to achieve the primary goal of the mh determination ,",
    "an unprecedented energy resolution of 3%/@xmath6 is a critical parameter in the experimental design , which requires : a ) the totoal photocathode coverage @xmath7 , b ) the pmt detection efficiency @xmath8 ( defined as the quantum efficiency times the collection efficiency )  @xcite , c ) the ls attenuation length @xmath9 m at 430 nm , which is equivalent to an absorption length of 60 m with a rayleigh scattering length of 30 m. m at 430 nm  @xcite . ]",
    "the juno project was approved by the chinese academy of sciences under the strategic priority research program in 2013 .",
    "the international collaboration was formed in july of 2014 , which includes over 300 collaborators and over 60 institutions from asia , europe and the americas .",
    "the groundbreaking ceremony at the experimental site was hold on january 10th , 2015 .",
    "it would take around 3 years to finish the civil construction .",
    "after the detector component production and the following detector installation and filling , juno is planed to start operation in 2020 .",
    "the primary goal of juno is to resolve the neutrino mass hierarchy and measure the oscillation parameters at the sub - percent level using reactor antineutrino oscillations . meanwhile , as a multipurpose neutrino experiment , it is also capable of measuring supernova burst neutrinos , the diffuse supernova neutrino background , geo - neutrinos , solar neutrinos and atmospheric neutrinos .",
    "juno has received approval since 2013 and the civil construction has started from 2015 .",
    "the r@xmath10d activities addressing the technical challenges are ongoing within the collaboration .",
