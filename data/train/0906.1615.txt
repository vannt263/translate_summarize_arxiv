    "weakly interacting massive particles ( wimps ) with electroweak scale masses are currently a favored explanation of the missing mass in the universe .",
    "such particles must either be stable or have a lifetime comparable to the age of the universe , and they would interact with baryonic matter gravitationally and through weak interactions .",
    "the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) provides a natural candidate , the lightest neutralino @xcite .",
    "a large range of potential neutralino masses exists , with a lower bound on the mass of the lightest neutralino of 47 gev imposed by accelerator - based analyses @xcite , while predictions based on the inferred dark matter density suggest masses up to several tev @xcite .",
    "searches for neutralino dark matter include _ direct _ searches for nuclear recoils from weak interaction of neutralinos with matter @xcite and _ indirect _ searches for standard model particles produced by neutralino annihilation .",
    "particularly , a fraction of neutralinos interacting with massive objects would become gravitationally bound and accumulate in the center .",
    "if neutralinos comprise dark matter , enough should accumulate and annihilate to produce an observable neutrino flux .",
    "searches for a high energy neutrino beam from the center of the earth @xcite and the sun @xcite have yielded negative results .",
    "observations of a cosmic ray electron - positron excess by atic @xcite , ppb - bets @xcite , fermi @xcite , and hess @xcite , along with the anomalous cosmic ray positron fraction reported by pamela @xcite , could be interpreted as an indirect signal of dark matter annihilation in our galaxy @xcite .",
    "here we present searches for a flux of gev  tev neutrinos from the sun using amanda .",
    "we improve on the sensitivity of the previous amanda analysis @xcite significantly and extend the latest results from icecube @xcite to lower neutralino masses .",
    "we observe no neutralino annihilation signal and report limits on the neutrino - induced muon flux from the sun and the resulting limits on neutralino - proton spin - dependent cross section .",
    "the detection of neutrino fluxes above @xmath0 gev is a major goal of the antarctic muon and neutrino detector array ( amanda ) .",
    "amanda consists of 677 optical modules embedded 1500 m to 2000 m deep in the ice sheet at the south pole , arranged in 19 vertical strings and occupying a volume of @xmath1 km@xmath2 .",
    "each module contains a 20 cm diameter photomultiplier tube ( pmt ) optically coupled to an outer glass pressure sphere .",
    "pmt pulses (  hits \" ) from incident cherenkov light are propagated to surface electronics and are recorded as an event when 67 hits on any one string or 24 total hits occur within 2.5 @xmath3s . the vast majority of the o(@xmath4 )",
    "events recorded each year are downgoing muons produced by cosmic ray air showers in the atmosphere above the south pole .",
    "relativistic charged leptons produced near the detector via charged - current neutrino interactions similarly trigger the detector , with several thousand atmospheric neutrino induced muon events recorded per year .",
    "the hit leading edge times , along with the known amanda geometry and ice properties @xcite , allow reconstruction of muon tracks with median accuracy 1.5@xmath5  2.5@xmath5 , dependent on zenith angle .",
    "amanda operated in standalone from 20002006 and is currently a subdetector of the much larger ( @xmath6 km@xmath2 ) icecube neutrino observatory @xcite , scheduled for completion in 2011 .",
    "the optical module density of amanda is much higher than that of icecube , making amanda more efficient for low - energy muons ( @xmath7 gev ) which emit less cherenkov light .",
    "we describe two separate searches for solar neutralinos in this proceeding .",
    "first , we present a search using a large data sample from 20002006 prepared for a high energy extraterrestrial point source search @xcite .",
    "we also present a search using data from 20012003 , optimized to retain low energy events @xcite .",
    "both analyses are done in two stages ; first , neutrino induced muon events are isolated from the much larger background of downgoing muons , then a search method is used to test for an excess at the location of the sun .",
    "while the sun is above the horizon , neutrino - induced muons from the sun are masked by the much larger background of downgoing cosmic ray muons ; thus , we select data during the period when the sun is below the horizon ( mar .",
    "21  sept .",
    "21 ) , resulting in 953 days livetime from 20002006 and 384 days from 20012003 . in both analyses ,",
    "neutrino events are isolated by selecting well reconstructed upgoing muon tracks .",
    "events are first reconstructed with fast pattern matching algorithms , and events with zenith angles @xmath8 ( @xmath9 for the 2001 - 2003 analysis ) are discarded , eliminating the vast majority of downgoing muons .",
    "the remaining events are reconstructed with a more computationally intensive maximum - likelihood reconstruction @xcite accurate to 1.5@xmath5  2.5@xmath5 , and again events with @xmath8 are discarded .",
    "o(@xmath10 ) misreconstructed",
    "downgoing muon events remain per year , and these are reduced by cuts on track quality parameters such as track angular uncertainty @xcite , the smoothness ( evenness ) of hits along the track @xcite , and the likelihood difference between the maximum - likelihood track and a forced downgoing likelihood fit using the zenith distribution of downgoing muons as a prior @xcite . for the 20002006 analysis ,",
    "6595 events remain after quality cuts , dominantly atmospheric neutrinos @xcite , reduced to 4665 events by requiring dates when the sun is below the horizon .",
    "zenith distributions from 20002006 are shown in figure [ zenith ] .",
    "we consider neutralino masses from 100 gev to 5 tev and two extreme annihilation channels : @xmath11 ( @xmath12 for 50 gev ) and @xmath13 , which produce high and low energy neutrino spectra , respectively , relative to the neutralino mass .",
    "the fraction of signal events retained depends on the neutrino energy spectrum and varies from 17% for a 5 tev neutralino mass and @xmath11 channel to 1% for 100 gev and @xmath13 channel , relative to trigger level , in the 20002006 analysis .    ) , and final cut level , true ( fine dotted ) and reconstructed ( solid ) zenith angles of corsika @xcite downgoing muon simulation at trigger level , reconstructed zenith angles of anis @xcite atmospheric neutrino simulation at trigger level , filter level , and final cut level ( dashed ) , and reconstructed zenith angles of a neutrino signal from the sun at final cut level ( dash - dotted).,width=288 ]    the 20012003 analysis is a dedicated neutralino search , unlike the 2000 - 2006 analysis , and more consideration is given to low energy events .",
    "twelve event observables are considered , and selection criteria based on these observables are optimized separately for three signal classes , dependent on neutralino mass and annihilation channel , to maximize retention of signal events .",
    "the signal classes are shown below along with the number of events passing selection criteria .    [",
    "cols=\"^,^,^,^ \" , ]",
    "these limits extend the latest icecube limits to lower neutralino masses and are now beginning to exclude neutralino spin - dependent cross sections allowed by direct detection experiments ( figure [ limit_fig ] ) . a 1000-fold improvement over current direct - detection limits @xcite does not significantly constrain allowed spin - dependent cross sections ; thus , neutrino telescopes will continue to observe a complementary portion of mssm parameter space over the next several years .",
    "icecube is currently operating with 59 strings and will contain 86 strings when complete in 2011 . the deepcore extension to icecube @xcite , six strings with tighter string spacing ( 72 m ) , tighter optical module spacing ( 7 m ) , and higher pmt quantum efficiency , will be complete in 2010 .",
    "deepcore will significantly enhance the sensitivity of icecube to low energy muons , extending the reach of icecube to lower neutralino masses .",
