    "microwave rb vapor - cell atomic clocks @xcite , based on optical - microwave double resonance , are today ubiquitous timing devices used in numerous fields of industry including instrumentation , telecommunications or satellite - based navigation systems .",
    "their success is explained by their ability to demonstrate excellent short - term fractional frequency stability at the level of 10@xmath1 , combined with a small size , weight , power consumption and a relatively modest cost . over the last decade ,",
    "the demonstration of advanced atom interrogation techniques ( including for instance pulsed - optical - pumping ( pop ) ) using narrow - linewidth semiconductor lasers has conducted to the development in laboratory of new - generation vapor cell clocks @xcite .",
    "these clocks have succeeded to achieve a 100 times improvement in frequency stability compared to existing commercial vapor cell clocks .    in this domain ,",
    "clocks based on a different phenomenon , named coherent population trapping ( cpt ) , have proven to be promising alternative candidates . since its discovery in @xmath2 @xcite , coherent population trapping physics @xcite has motivated stimulating studies in various fields covering fundamental and applied physics such as slow - light experiments @xcite , high - resolution laser spectroscopy , magnetometers @xcite , laser cooling @xcite or atomic frequency standards .",
    "basically , cpt occurs by connecting two long - lived ground state hyperfine levels of an atomic specie to a common excited state by simultaneous action of two resonant optical fields . at null raman detuning , i.e. when the frequency difference between both optical fields matches perfectly the atomic ground - state hyperfine frequency , atoms are trapped through a destructive quantum interference process into a noninteracting coherent superposition of both ground states , so - called dark state , resulting in a clear decrease of the light absorption or equivalently in a net increase of the transmitted light .",
    "the output resonance signal , whose line - width is ultimately limited by the cpt coherence lifetime , can then be used as a narrow frequency discriminator towards the development of an atomic frequency standard . in a cpt - based clock , unlike the traditional double - resonance rb clock @xcite , the microwave signal used to probe the hyperfine frequency is directly optically carried allowing to remove the microwave cavity and potentially to shrink significantly the clock dimensions .",
    "the application of cpt to atomic clocks was firstly demonstrated in a sodium atomic beam @xcite . in @xmath3 , n. cyr",
    "et al proposed a simple method to produce a microwave clock transition in a vapor cell with purely optical means by using a modulated diode laser @xcite , demonstrating its high - potential for compactness . in @xmath4 , a first remarkably compact atomic clock prototype was demonstrated in nist @xcite .",
    "further integration was achieved later thanks to the proposal @xcite and development of micro - fabricated alkali vapor cells @xcite , leading to the demonstration of the first chip - scale atomic clock prototype ( csac ) @xcite and later to the first commercially - available csac @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , this extreme miniaturization effort induces a typical fractional frequency stability limited at the level of @xmath5 , not compliant with dedicated domains requiring better stability performances . in that sense , in the frame of the european collaborative mclocks project @xcite",
    ", significant efforts have been pursued to demonstrate compact high - performance cpt - based atomic clocks and to help to push this technology to industry .    in standard cpt clocks ,",
    "a major limitation to reach better frequency stability performances is the low contrast ( @xmath6 , the amplitude - to - background ratio ) of the detected cpt resonance .",
    "this low contrast is explained by the fact that atoms interact with a circularly polarized bichromatic laser beam , leading most of the atomic population into extreme zeeman sub - levels of the ground state , so called `` end - states '' .",
    "several optimized cpt pumping schemes , aiming to maximize the number of atoms participating to the clock transition , have been proposed in the literature to circumvent this issue ( @xcite , and references therein ) , but at the expense of increased complexity .    in that sense , a novel constructive polarization modulation cpt @xcite pumping technique , named double - modulation ( dm ) scheme , was recently proposed .",
    "it consists to apply a phase modulation between both optical components of the bichromatic laser synchronously with a polarization modulation .",
    "the phase modulation is needed to ensure a common dark state to both polarizations , allowing to pump a maximum number of atoms into the desired magnetic - field insensitive clock state .",
    "this elegant solution presents the main advantage compared to the push - pull optical pumping @xcite or the lin@xmath7lin technique @xcite to avoid any optical beam separation or superposition and is consequently well - adapted to provide a compact and robust linear architecture setup .    in this article",

    "<S> we demonstrate a vapor cell atomic clock prototype based on continuous - wave ( cw ) interrogation and double - modulation coherent population trapping ( dm - cpt ) technique . </S>",
    "<S> the dm - cpt technique uses a synchronous modulation of polarization and relative phase of a bi - chromatic laser beam in order to increase the number of atoms trapped in a dark state , _ </S>",
    "<S> i.e. _ a non - absorbing state . </S>",
    "<S> the narrow resonance , observed in transmission of a cs vapor cell , is used as a narrow frequency discriminator in an atomic clock . a detailed characterization of the cpt resonance versus numerous parameters is reported . </S>",
    "<S> a short - term frequency stability of @xmath0 up to averaging time is measured . </S>",
    "<S> these performances are more than one order of magnitude better than industrial rb clocks and comparable to those of best laboratory - prototype vapor cell clocks . </S>",
    "<S> the noise budget analysis shows that the short and mid - term frequency stability is mainly limited by the power fluctuations of the microwave used to generate the bi - chromatic laser . </S>",
    "<S> these preliminary results demonstrate that the dm - cpt technique is well - suited for the development of a high - performance atomic clock , with potential compact and robust setup due to its linear architecture . </S>",
    "<S> this clock could find future applications in industry , telecommunications , instrumentation or global navigation satellite systems . </S>"
