    "since the pioneer work of caves in 1981  @xcite , quantum metrology has made a great progress as a successful application of quantum mechanics to enhance the measurement precision  @xcite . however , unlike the single - parameter quantum metrology , multiparameter quantum metrology for a long time was not adequately studied .",
    "one major reason is that quantum multiparameter cramr - rao bound in general can not be saturated .",
    "a decade ago , the condition of this bound to be tight for pure states has been given  @xcite .",
    "since then , several protocols on multiparameter estimation were proposed in different scenarios  @xcite .",
    "one of these works was given by humphreys _",
    "_ in ref .",
    "@xcite , where the phase imaging problem was mapped into a multiparameter metrology process and a generalized form of noon states was used as the input resource .",
    "they found that the simultaneous estimation with the generalized noon states is better than the independent estimation with the noon state .    on the other hand ,",
    "the noon state is not the only state that is available to reach the heisenberg limit .",
    "another useful state is the so - called entangled coherent state ( ecs ) , which has been widely applied and studied in quantum metrology recently  @xcite . in a mach - zehnder interferometer",
    ", ecs has been proved to be more powerful than noon state in giving a heisenberg scaling precision  @xcite . even in a lossy interferometer",
    ", ecs can still beat the shot - noise limit for a not very large loss rate  @xcite .",
    "thus , it is reasonable for one to wonder that if a generalized form of ecs could give a better theoretical precision than the counterpart of noon state .",
    "this is the major motivation of this work .    in this paper",
    ", we apply a generalized form of ecs in linear and nonlinear optical interferometers . by calculating the quantum fisher information matrix ( qfim )",
    ", we give the analytical expression of the quantum cramr - rao bound ( qcrb ) for both linear and nonlinear protocols . in the linear protocol",
    ", the bound can reach the heisenberg scaling for most values of the total photon number .",
    "meanwhile , with respect to the parameter number @xmath0 , in both protocols , for most values of photon number , the bounds provide better precisions than that given by independent protocol with ecs or noon state , which is the same as the generalized noon state discussed in ref .",

    "[ sec : cramer - rao - bound ] , we briefly review the quantum cramr - rao bound as well as the quantum fisher information matrix for multiparameter estimations . in sec .",
    "[ sec : ecs ] , we introduce a generalized form of entangled coherent state for multiple modes and apply it in linear and nonlinear optical interferometers .",

    "in a multiparameter quantum metrology process , the quantum state @xmath1 depends on a set of deterministic parameters @xmath2 .",
    "the value of @xmath3 is estimated by processing the observation data obtained by measuring the quantum system .",
    "a generalized quantum measurement is characterized by a positive - operator - valued measure @xmath4 with @xmath5 denoting outcomes . according to quantum mechanics , the probability of obtaining the outcome @xmath5 is @xmath6 .",
    "denote the estimator for @xmath7 by @xmath8 , which is a map from the measurement outcome @xmath5 to the estimates .",
    "the accuracy of the multiparameter estimation can be measured by the estimation - error covariance matrix : @xmath9[\\hat\\theta_k(x)-\\theta_k]\\mathrm{tr}(e_x\\rho)$ ] . for ( locally ) unbiased estimators",
    "@xmath8 , the qcrb on the estimation error reads  @xcite @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the number of the repetition of the experiments , and @xmath12 is the quantum fisher information matrix ( qfim ) .",

    ", the elements of qfim can be expressed as  @xcite @xmath18    in this work , we use the the total variance @xmath19 as a figure of merit for the multiparameter estimation . taking the trace on both sides of inequality ( [ eq : c_r ] )",
    "leads to @xmath20 where we have set @xmath21 as we are only interested in the quantum enhancements .",
    "for a two - parameter case , eq .  ( [ eq : tot_var ] ) is reduced into @xmath22 , where @xmath23 with @xmath24 denoting the determinant can be treated as an effective quantum fisher information .    in order to draw conclusion on the best possible estimation error from the qcrb , it is important to know whether the lower bound is achievable .",
    "the qcrb for multiparameter estimation is in general not achievable .",
    "however , for pure states , the qcrb can be saturated if @xmath25 are satisfied for all @xmath26 , @xmath27 , and @xmath3  @xcite .",

    "this implies that the cramr - rao bound is theoretically achievable .",

    "entangled coherent state ( ecs ) has been applied in several single - parameter quantum metrology protocols and proved to be powerful in beating the shot - noise limit  @xcite .",
