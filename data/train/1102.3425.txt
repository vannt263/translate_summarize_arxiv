    "the question for the perfect cone compactifications was not previously considered , to our knowledge .    in this paper , we prove that the extended map is regular for the perfect cone compactification for all @xmath20 . much more than that , we prove that the perfect and the 2nd voronoi compactifications share a common open neighborhood of the image of @xmath1 .",

    "we need to show that this is greater than 1 on all integral noncoedges .",
    "equivalently ( by lemma  [ coedge_lemma ] ) , we need to show that for any @xmath482 with @xmath483 for some @xmath353-cycle @xmath357 there is an @xmath484 and @xmath353-cycle @xmath485 in @xmath352 such that @xmath486 .",
    "we may assume that @xmath357 is the sum of at most two simple cycles ( if @xmath487 then @xmath488 or @xmath489 for some @xmath490 ) .",
    "since @xmath357 is a ( 0,1 ) cycle it must be the image of a cycle in at least one of @xmath127 , @xmath128 , @xmath395 . if it is the image of a cycle in @xmath128 or @xmath395 there is nothing to show , so we can assume that it is the image of some cycle @xmath442 in @xmath127 , but not of any cycle in @xmath128 or @xmath395 . in order for this to be true @xmath357 must contain the edge @xmath393 and not the edge that becomes a bridge in @xmath127 .    by symmetry",
    "assume that @xmath442 contains the edge @xmath360 and not @xmath394 .",
    "note that since @xmath357 was a sum of 2 ( possibly trivial ) simple cycles , so is @xmath442 , say @xmath491 where @xmath492 the simple summand containing @xmath360 .",
    "note that , since @xmath493 contains neither @xmath360 nor @xmath394 , the image of @xmath493 in @xmath101 is also the image of simple cycles in @xmath128 and @xmath395 , so if @xmath494 the problem would be solved immediately .",
    "hence we will further assume @xmath495 .",
    "we will proceed to use @xmath442 to construct a @xmath353 cycle @xmath496 in @xmath127 that contains both @xmath360 and @xmath394 and has @xmath497 . if we can succeed in doing this",
    "the result will follow , because depending on the relative orientations of @xmath360 and @xmath394 in @xmath496 there must be either a @xmath353 cycle @xmath485 in @xmath128 that maps to the same cycle in @xmath101 as @xmath496 does ( so @xmath498 ) or one in @xmath395 that maps to the same cycle as @xmath496 ( so @xmath499 ) .    to build @xmath496 , find a simple cycle @xmath500 passing through @xmath394 that intersects @xmath493 in a ( possibly empty ) arc ( continuous path of edges ) .",
    "such a cycle always exists , since given any cycle containing @xmath394 ( these exist by connectedness ) there is a maximal arc ( possibly the whole cycle ) disjoint from @xmath493 , and a ( possibly empty ) arc in @xmath493 joining its endpoints .",
    "we can choose the arc in @xmath493 such that @xmath500+@xmath493 is also a @xmath353 cycle .",
    "but now since @xmath501 , out of the four @xmath353 cycles @xmath502 , @xmath503 one of @xmath504 , @xmath505 must be greater than 1 .",
    "( indeed , recalling our assumption that @xmath506 , if @xmath507 one of @xmath502 will work , if @xmath508 one of @xmath503 will work , otherwise all four work . ) calling this cycle @xmath496 the result follows .",
    "hence the nongeneric cases are resolved .",

    "then one of the graphs @xmath352 may have a component which is a `` loop with one edge @xmath345 and zero vertices '' .",
    "we deal with this case formally , by taking @xmath509 to be the corresponding quadratic form .",
    "[ thm : remm - existence ] any graph @xmath101 admits a strong @xmath166-emm .",
    "existence of an @xmath166-emm follows at once from theorem  [ thm : remm - cubic ] and lemma  [ lem : reduction ] which reduces graph @xmath101 to a disjoint collection @xmath510 of cubic graphs . however , the inclusion @xmath204 ( see definition  [ def : set - squares ] ) may be strict , so a strong @xmath166-emm @xmath88 of @xmath141 may not be a strong @xmath166-emm of @xmath101 .    by the result @xcite which we mentioned in remark  [ rem : toroidal - schottky ] ,",

    "the matrix of @xmath88 is the inverse of the matrix of @xmath98 .",
