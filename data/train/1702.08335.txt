    "<S> 3 - 5 , we present the variation of eigenvalues when the distance between wells in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 1(a , b , c ) is increased slowly . </S>",
    "<S> the blue lines present the coalescing of two levels when the total potential is mildly complex pt - symmetric ( @xmath19 is small ) . </S>",
    "<S> see the dashed red lines for hermitian double - well ( @xmath54 ) representing merging of two levels . </S>",
    "<S> green dotted and blue dot - dashed lines arise when non - hermiticity parameter becomes large , then the coalesced levels are not contained between the merging levels ( red dashed lines ) .    </S>",
    "<S> lastly , we conclude that the models discussed here bring the spectral phenomena of coalescing and merging of energy levels closer , however we know that they occur in two different domains : hermitian and complex pt - symmetric . </S>",
