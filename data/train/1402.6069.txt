    "in this paper we described a general algorithm to calculate dynamical spin - spin correlation function using linear spin wave theory on magnetic lattices with incommensurate order .",
    "the method can accommodate models where the interacting atoms have different spin quantum numbers .",
    "it also includes a general single ion anisotropy , anisotropic and antisymmetric exchange interactions . the main idea behind the general solution is to define a local coordinate system that transforms the incommensurate magnetic structure into ferromagnetic order by the consecutive application of two rotations .",
    "first a global rotation , that transforms the incommensurate structure into a commensurate one . secondly a local rotation on every moment within the crystallographic unit cells .",
    "this method enables the calculation of the spin wave spectrum of incommensurate systems , that was achieved without using a large supercell and an approximate ordering wave vector @xcite .",
    "we also showed the necessary steps that define an algorithm , that is available under gnu general public license @xcite .",
    "finally as an example we showed how the algorithm can be used to calculate the spectrum of magnetic c - site langasites with incommensurate magnetic order @xcite .",
