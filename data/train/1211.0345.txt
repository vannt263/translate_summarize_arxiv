    "massive stars have a profound effect on stars that subsequently form in their vicinity , thus significantly influencing the initial mass function ( imf ) , the star formation efficiency , and the total extent and mass of star clusters . in massive star - forming regions ( sfrs ) ,",
    "the ionizing radiation from ob stars can produce photo - evaporating protoplanetary disks or _ proplyds _ , the most famous of which lie in the orion nebula ( e.g. , odell , wen , & hu 1993 ; ricci , robberto , & soderblom 2008 ) .",
    "this radiation can also progressively ionize dense knots of nearby molecular material , forming evaporating gaseous globules , or _ eggs _",
    "( hester et al . 1996 ) .    a new class of tadpole - shaped objects was recently discovered near the cygnus ob2 association ( sahai , morris & claussen 2012[smc12 ] , wright et al . 2012[wetal12 ] )  the most massive young association within 2 kpc of the sun , located inside the cygnus - x giant molecular cloud complex where considerable star formation is ongoing .",
    "the strong morphological similarity between these objects and proplyds led wetal12 to conclude that these objects are  a unique class of photoevaporating , partially - embedded , young stellar objects \" and unlikely to be eggs , from a comparison of the large fraction ( about 70% ) of these objects that appear to contain one or more young stars with the much lower value for m16 ( 15% ) .",
    "however , smc12 concluded that wetal12 s argument is not compelling , as several unconsidered variables , including density and mass of parent cloud , and strength of radiation field and winds , can affect this fraction .",
    "in addition , the sizes of these objects ( 20,000110,000au ) are huge compared to the orion proplyds ( 40350au : henney & odell 1999 ) . recognizing the importance of these issues , smc12 carried out molecular - line observations that reveal dense molecular cores associated with two of these objects ( the tadpole and the goldfish ) , with total masses of cold ( @xmath3k ) molecular gas exceeding 12 , strongly favoring the egg hypothesis .",
    "these data also conclusively rule out the proplyd hypothesis since a proplyd is highly unlikely to harbor such a substantial mass of molecular gas . to date",
    ", no dense molecular medium has yet been found towards any known proplyd , and the low orion proplyd disk masses ( 0.0030.07 )  ( mann & williams 2010 ) , derived from continuum observations of dust emission , imply even smaller masses for the circumstellar material being evaporated from them .",
    "finally , the evaporated material is likely to be primarily atomic , not molecular .",
    "smc12 concluded that these tadpole - shaped objects are dense , star - forming molecular cores that originated in the cygnus cloud and are now being photoevaporated by ultraviolet radiation from the cygob2no.8 cluster located @xmath410pc to their north - west , and shaped by ram pressure of strong , nearby wind sources .",
    "continuing observations of @xmath0co and @xmath5co lines , as well as high - density tracers such as the j=3 - 2 lines of hco@xmath1 , hcn , hnc , and n@xmath6h@xmath1 in a sample of about 20 such objects have strongly supported the smc12 hypothesis ( sahai et al .",
    "2012b ) .",
    "the discovery of these free - floating evaporating gas globules ( hereafter freggs ) raises a fundamental question for star and protoplanetary disk formation in massive sfrs : what fraction of the previously classified proplyd objects are really eggs ?",
    "the distinction between freggs and proplyds is quite important , because in the former case , star formation and protostellar accretion are still very much under way , whereas proplyd disks are in much later stages in which accretion no longer has a strong effect on the protostellar evolution , although planet formation may still be in progress .",
    "we have therefore begun a study of the molecular gas content of objects previously classified as proplyds with the goal of determining their true nature .",
    "smith , bally & morse ( 2003 : sbm03 ) found many objects in the carina sfr from ground - based optical emission - line images that closely resemble the proplyds found in orion , and concluded that the former were proplyds as well in spite of their significantly larger ( factor @xmath7 ) sizes . in this letter , we report single - dish molecular line observations of one such representative object from the set of 12 reported in sbm03 , 104632.9 - 600354 ( hereafter carina - fregg1 ) , and show that our data rule out the proplyd hypothesis for this object and support its fregg nature .",
    "we observed carina - fregg1 ( fig.[irachst ] ) in the co j=32 , 43 , 65 and 76 lines , the @xmath0co j=32 and the hcn and hco@xmath8 j=43 lines , and the continuum at 350 and 870  using the atacama pathfinder experiment ( gsten et al .",

    "gaussian fits to the line profiles result in a width ( fwhm ) of about 3.1  in the 32 and 43 lines , and 3.5 and 4.1   in the 65 and 76 lines , respectively , implying an increase in the wing contribution relative to the core for the higher excitation lines .",

    ", we convolved the co 65 and 76 maps to the 43 map resolution , @xmath20 ( we chose not to convolve these maps to the larger 32 beamsize because of possible contamination from the extended cloud to the east ) . since the source is unresolved",

    "using two nearby field stars to register the acs and 2mass ks images , we find that the source is located at @xmath46 , roughly in the middle of the dark waist .",
    "we also retrieved archival ks images towards carina - fregg1 taken with the naco+conica instrument on the eso - vlt - u4 on 10 jan 2007 , with a total field - of - view @xmath47 . using standard iraf packages",
    ", we generated a flat - field from these images using median - averaging and applied it to each of the 17  30-sec dithered exposures , which were then registered to a common reference frame and averaged .",
    "the angular resolution in the final image is about @xmath48 as measured from radial intensity cuts of several neighbouring field stars .",
    "we find an extended faint hourglass - shaped nebula with a bright central region ( fig.[irachst]c ) with its symmetry axis aligned with that of the jet .",
    "the northern lobe is much brighter than the southern one , implying that the hourglass structure is tilted such that its northern lobe is closer to us . in the central region of the northern lobe , which has a wide - u shape with its apex located at the center of the hourglass ( inset , fig.[irachst]c ) ,",
    "the brightest feature is a small spur ( of length @xmath450au ) oriented at a position angle , @xmath49 .",
    "the spur is located slightly west of the jet axis and is not aligned with the latter ( which is oriented at @xmath50 ) .",
    "the spitzer irac images ( 3.68 ) show an elongated morphology similar to carina - fregg1 s optical shape ( but at much lower angular resolution ) . as in the ks image ,",
    "the shape is bipolar , with the northern half significantly brighter than the southern one .",
    "no central star can be seen in the ks image or the irac images , implying that the former is deeply embedded within a dusty disk with very high line - of - sight extinction . in longer - wavelength spitzer images ( i.e. , @xmath51 )",
    ", no isolated source can be detected at the location of carina - fregg1 due to bright extended emission from foreground or background clouds in its vicinity .",
    "we have determined the sed of carina - fregg1 from 1.25 to 870 .",
    "we carried out aperture photometry on the j and h - band 2mass images ( since the 2mass catalog gives only a ks magnitude ) .",
    "aperture photometry for irac ( channel 1 to 4 ) and mips ( channel 1 ) is provided by povich et al .",
    "( 2011 : source pcyc1173 in their catalog ) .",
    "since no compact source can be seen in the mips 24  image at carina - fregg1 s location , we treat povich et al.s measured 24  magnitude of 3 as an upper limit .",
    "the sed ( fig.[sed ] ) continues to rise towards 350   the longest wavelength for which we have a detection  indicating a substantial amount of emission from cool circumstellar dust in the far - ir range . for the source luminosity",
    ", we integrate the sed up to 350  to estimate @xmath52 ; a rough upper limit of @xmath53  is provided by assuming flux values equal to the upper limits at 24 and 870 .",
    "the observed fluxes have been corrected using an interstellar extinction @xmath54 , that is intermediate between the value ( 1.78 ) given by smith et al .",
    "( 2004 ) and that ( 1.3 ) computed from a numerical algorithm provided by hakkila et al . (",
    "1997 ) , which estimates the @xmath55 of a galactic source from its longitude , latitude and distance .",
    "we modeled the sed using an online tool that applies least - squares fitting to find the best models from a large set of pre - computed yso models having accretion disks and infall envelopes with biconical outflow cavities ( robitaille et al.2007 ) .",
    "the ten best - fit models ( fig.[sed ] ) have relatively low stellar effective temperatures ( 26603800k ) , stellar masses ( 0.10.65 ) and total luminosities ( stellar+disk - accretion : 610 ) and small ages ( 11003000 yr ) .",
    "these results support our inference of a deeply - embedded yso in carina - fregg1 , but must be treated with some caution . although the inferred inclination of the outflow to the line - of - sight , @xmath56 , together with the large circumstellar extinction along the disk s mid - plane ( @xmath57 ) , is qualitatively consistent with the strong asymmetry in the brightness of the bipolar lobes in the ks image , the projected opening angle of the cavity , @xmath58  ( @xmath59 , is the intrinsic opening angle in these models ) appears smaller than observed .",
    "our detection of a substantial mass of molecular gas in carina - fregg1 shows that it is an fregg , not a proplyd ( as classified previously ) . since the discovery of proplyds in orion , many studies have reported the finding of proplyds in other sfrs with massive stars ( e.g. , balog et al .",
    "2006 , koenig et al .",
    "2008 , brandner et al .",
    "however , in light of this study and that in smc12 , it is likely that the true nature of many or all of these objects has been misunderstood , and that some ( or even all ) of the previously classified proplyds in carina , especially those which are significantly larger in size than the orion proplyds , are really freggs .",
    "both proplyds and eggs are unique probes of the effects of the harsh uv radiation and strong stellar winds from massive stars on the formation of lower - mass stars in their vicinity , thus it is of fundamental importance to be able to distinguish between these two classes .",
    "eggs are most likely the surviving high density concentrations in a cloud as the ionization front sweeps through it .",
    "the formation of a protostar in the egg may be induced by the compression of the latter by the high - pressure environment of the ambient hii region , supplemented by the even higher pressure at the high - density ionization front at the egg surface .",
    "photoevaporation sculpts out and exposes an egg while the stellar object(s ) in it is ( are ) still accreting mass , ultimately freezing the protostellar mass distribution at a relatively early stage in its evolution ( e.g. , hester et al .",
    "freggs like carina - fregg1 ( where the presence of collimated jets , central hourglass structure , and low luminosity , all imply the presence of a jet - driving , young , low - mass star ) or the tadpole ( smc12 ) represent the early formation phase of low or intermediate - mass stars within a massive sfr .",
    "proplyds may represent the endpoint of evolution of such freggs , or may form coevally with the ob stars in these sfrs . whether other objects like",
    "carina - fregg1 are proplyds or eggs has major implications for the star - formation rate and the imf in the massive sfrs where they are found .",
    "outstanding questions that future research should address are : ( i ) do proplyds represent the evolutionary endpoint of freggs and ( ii ) is the formation of stars that may form in freggs induced by the surrounding hii region s compression or were such stars already in the process of formation in the relatively dense cloud cores that are susceptible to becoming freggs ?",
