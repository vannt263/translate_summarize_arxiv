    "the existence of short - range interaction can induce many exotic physical phenomena , and therefore boost a theoretical interest in a variety of correlated quantum systems . owing to the rapid advance of experimental techniques , ultracold quantum gases trapped in optical lattices",
    "have provided in the past decade a route to simulate the physics of different kinds of correlated quantum systems @xcite . for few interacting particles , experiments with ultracold atoms",
    "have so far demonstrated the existence of bound pair ( bp ) states @xcite and correlated tunneling phenomena @xcite .",
    "this stimulate many experimental and theoretical investigations aiming at the correlated particles , which lead to a series of intriguing novel phenomena involving bp formation @xcite , detection @xcite , dynamics petrosyan , zollner , chens , valiente2,wang , jlnjp , jlbp , jltrans , and bp condensate @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , recent experiments on optical lattices @xcite have renewed the interest for investigating the behavior of correlated quantum system after a sudden change of hamiltonian parameters , the so - called quantum quench .",
    "the corresponding spectacular experimental results have triggered an intensive research on quantum quenches in various systems involving one - dimensional bose systems @xcite , luttinger liquids cazalilla and others @xcite . among many",
    "remarkable quench dynamical phenomena , it has been possible to observe collapse and revival of matter waves with bose - einstein condensates in optical lattices @xcite , coherent quench dynamics of fermionic atoms @xcite , as well as non - thermal behaviors in near - integrable experimental regimes @xcite . a straightforward method to realize such quenched systems",
    "is the instantaneous change of a global or local parameter of the system like an external field or the interaction strength . in particular , when an external field is applied to the correlated few - body system , preservation of the correlation between the two particles in matter - wave transport can exhibit unusual phenomena that are generally inaccessible in solid - state systems , such as frequency doubling of bloch oscillation ( bo ) of two correlated particles @xcite , dynamic localization longhid , coherent destruction of tunneling @xcite and the fractional bo of atomic pairs @xcite .",
    "however , if the external field is applied in a suitable manner , tunnelling between bloch bands becomes possible , which leads to a sudden death of the bo @xcite or bloch - zener oscillation @xcite .    in previous work",
    "@xcite , the dynamical behavior of bp has been investigated for the extended hubbard model driven by an external field .",
    "it has been shown that the nearest - neighbor interaction can spoil the completeness of the bound band , which can induce a sudden death of the oscillation of bp and break the correlation between the particles when the external field is switched on . however , the underlying mechanism of such dynamical behaviors is not clear .",
    "motivated by this question , here , we theoretically investigate the underlying mechanism of the dynamics of the two - particle correlation in the frame work of the hubbard model driven by a field , and show that , the presence of the external field can bring about an avoided crossing between the correlated energy level and uncorrelated scattering band leading to the correlation and energy transfer among involved states . in this case",
    ", correlated particles can be pumped into the scattering regime accompanied with the energy transfer from the field to particles , rather than preserving the correlation of the particles in the unmixed region in which the correlated and uncorrelated state are not mixed .",
    "intuitively , when an external field is applied , there can exist a threshold below which the field can not induce the destruction of the short - range correlation between the particles .",
    "furthermore , as the magnitude of the field strength is beyond the threshold , the transfer rate from correlated state to uncorrelated states gets larger with increase of the quench field strength .",
    "however , in this paper , we show that the long time - scale transfer rate from an initial correlated state to final uncorrelated particle states exhibits a periodic behavior with the increase of the quench field strength , which can occur in a small range of the field .",

    "[ fig4 ] . for the quenched system with",
    "multi avoided crossings , the distribution of initial correlated state @xmath88 mainly concentrates on the mixed region and therefore refers to many energy levels .",
    "this is due to the fact that the correlation exchange takes place among the involved correlated state and uncorrelated band through the avoided crossing . on the contrary , when the sudden change of the field strength @xmath0 is far away from the avoided crossing region , the wave functions of two types of states are not mixed , which suppress the tunneling from the correlated to uncorrelated states .",
    "this leads to the fact that the corresponding eigenstates remain their correlation .",
    "therefore , in contrast to the case of the quenched system with multi avoided crossing regions , the initial state @xmath88 is mainly distributed on the correlated states and contains less energy levels , which are equally spaced with an approximately constant spacing given by @xmath0 . as a comparison ,",

    "this indicates that the initial two correlated particles lose their correlation , which can be seen from the fig .",

    "furthermore , the step decrease of @xmath100 as a function of time in fig .",
    "[ fig7](b ) can be explained from another perspective as follows : after a field quench , the presence of the external field can not only drive the correlated wave packet to move along the bound band but also give rise to the zener tunneling between the bound and scattering band of @xmath5 .",
    "the zener tunnelling takes place almost exclusively when the momentum of the wave packet reaches to the point of center momentum @xmath104 , which is either at the top of the bound band or at the bottom of the scattering band . in this case",
    ", the correlated pair can be partially pumped into the upper scattering band accompanied by the destruction of correlation and the increase of energy . at this time",
    ", the evolved state is a mixed state composed of correlated and scattering states . over a period of time",
    ", the scattering and correlated components of the evolved state once again arrive at the transition point simultaneously with a characteristic period given by @xmath76 .",
    "then the two components of the evolved state exchange the energy and correlation from each other due to the zener tunneling . through a number of these processes , the @xmath105 tends to be a steady value .",
    "the corresponding time @xmath106  can be termed as quench relaxation time , which deeply depends on the distribution of the initial state in the energy space . to further understand the field - induced energy variation arising from the zener tunneling from the bound band to scattering band , we study the average energy of @xmath5 , which can be defined by @xmath107as comparison , the average energy @xmath108 as a function of time for two typical quenched systems is plotted fig .",

    "[ fig7](a ) , the average energy of the evolved state oscillates around the strength of on - site interaction @xmath109 preserving the constancy of the average interval energy .",
    "the corresponding oscillation period is given by @xmath76 .",
    "this implies that the two correlated particles undergo a bo , which is in accordance with our previous analysis . while for the dynamics of correlated particles in the quenched system with multi avoided crossing regions , the average energy of the evolved state is first around the strength of on - site interaction @xmath109 and then oscillates around @xmath101 , which indicates  that the evolved state is completely pumped into the scattering region with the increase of the average energy of two particles",
    "this can be seen from fig . [",
    "fig7](b ) . on the other hand ,",
    "when the quench field is switched off at time @xmath106 , the time evolution of the state @xmath110  is driven by the hamiltonian @xmath5  leading to a constant average energy . at this time",
    ", the state @xmath110  are mainly distributed on the scattering band of @xmath5  owing to the increase of the average distance @xmath23 , which indicates that the quench process accomplishes the energy transfer from the field to particles .",
    "this is analogous to the electrothermal effect in the context of classical physics , which describes the interconversion of thermal energy difference and electrical potential .",
    "therefore , such a quench process , in which the energy of the two particles is elevated by the external field , can be termed as a quantum electrothermal effect .",
    "furthermore , one can extend this result to the system consisting of multi correlated pairs in which the pair - pair interaction is neglected .",
    "the  quench field can elevate the total energy of the particles associated with the disassociation of the pairs in the coordinate space .",
