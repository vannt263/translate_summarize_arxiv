    "the andreev reflection in normal metal - superconductor(ns ) junctions has attracted great interests of researchers in the field of superconductivity in recent years@xcite .",
    "the tunneling spectrum of electrons on a ns junction is sensitive to the superconducting gap of the superconductor(sc ) , thus providing an important technique to measure the gaps and gap properties of scs . when an electron tunnels into a sc from a metal there appears a hole reflection to conserve the electric charge , which is called the andreev reflection , since the incident electron may form a cooper pair in the sc .",
    "a commonly used theoretical method to investigate the andreev reflection is the blonder - tinkham - klapwijk(btk ) approach@xcite , which takes the interface of a ns junction as a @xmath0 potential barrier .",
    "this theory has been widely and successfully applied to systems like ns junctions@xcite , ferromagnet - sc junctions@xcite , etc .",
    "wei , dong and xing _ et al _ studied the tunneling spectrum in metal - sc - metal(nsn ) junctions using the btk approach@xcite .",
    "they found that the incident and outgoing currents in both sides do not balance each other@xcite .",
    "thus they claimed earlier that the btk approach were not suitable for the andreev reflection in nsn junctions and treated them in the landauer - buttiker formalism@xcite .",
    "later they proposed a mechanism to balance the currents by adjusting the chemical potential of the sc inside the nsn junctions@xcite .",
    "this mechanism seems reasonable since the unbalance of currents will change the charge density and thus the fermi surface of the sc . in a similar idea",
    "we proposed recently another mechanism that the interface of the ns junctions is charged by the unbalanced currents@xcite .",
    "although these mechanisms successfully balanced the incident current and the outgoing current , however , they mis - considered the phase between the incident electron and hole .",
    "we found that different phases just balance the incident current and the ougoing current . after averaging over the phases the incident and outgoing currents",
    "coincide each other through the whole range of bias voltage .",
    "the charge density , the fermi surface , and the interface charge state wo nt change at all .",
    "this provides us a more natural and physical mechanism for the theory of multiple ns junctions . in the present paper",
    "we study the superlattice of multiple ns junctions using this new mechanism .",
    "a ns junction superlattice is shown in fig.1 , where metals and scs with width @xmath1 and @xmath2 are sandwiched periodically but the outmost layers are metals working as two leads . a thin insulating interface exists in every junction to be treated as a @xmath0 potential barrier in the btk approach .",
    "an electron and a hole are incident into the superlattice under a bias voltage on both sides .",
    "there is no incident electron in the right metal , thus @xmath3 and in the left metal no incident hole @xmath4 .",
    "due to the potential barriers the electron and the hole in one layer are partially reflected and partially transmitted into the next layer . in the sc only a pseudo - particle can propagate above the energy gap @xmath5 .",
    "when the bias voltage is smaller than @xmath5 only cooper pairs can do in the sc .",
    "this causes a hole reflected from the interface , which is called the andreev reflection in literatures .     and in the left side @xmath4 .",
    "( b ) the fermi surfaces and energy bands of metals and superconductors . except for the two metal leads the metals and scs have 0 bias voltage .",
    ", title=\"fig:\",width=226,height=151 ]   and in the left side @xmath4 .",
    "( b ) the fermi surfaces and energy bands of metals and superconductors . except for the two metal leads the metals and scs have 0 bias voltage .",
    ", title=\"fig:\",width=302,height=188 ]    the tunneling process of an electron and a hole in the ns junction superlattice is described by the bogoliubov - de gennes ( bdg ) equation@xcite @xmath6 where @xmath7 on the interfaces .    when the bias voltage satisfies @xmath8 an incident particle in metals tunnels into the sc through the interfaces and propagate as a quasi - particle inside the sc .",
    "it is then partially reflected by the following interface and partially tunnels into the following metal .",
    "the wave functions of the electron and the hole inside the @xmath9th metal layer and the @xmath9th sc layer are written as @xmath10 \\label{wf2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath11 and @xmath12 are the quasi - eletron ( @xmath13 ) and quasi - hole ( @xmath14 ) wave functions with the same energy @xmath15 in the sc layers , respectively .",
    "they are given by @xmath16 the wave vectors are determined by @xmath17 when @xmath18 , @xmath19 become complex numbers , so that cooper pairs appear and the wave functions in the sc become damping traveling waves . in this case one",
    "has @xmath20 the coefficients @xmath21 in ( [ wf1 ] ) to ( [ wf2 ] ) are obtained from the boundary conditions of wave functions on the interfaces , where the wave functions are continuous but due to the @xmath0 barriers the first derivatives of them are not , i.e. , @xmath22 where 1 and 2 denote the adjacent metal and sc layers , and @xmath23 and @xmath24 is the position of the interface .",
    "these boundary conditions give the following matrix equations @xmath25 for @xmath26 , where @xmath27 and @xmath28 are called the transfer matrices at interface @xmath24 between the metal and sc layers and interface @xmath29 between the sc and metal layers . using this matrices",
    "we find the relation between the coefficients of the incident and outgoing particles in the following form @xmath30 assigning @xmath31 , and @xmath32 for an incident electron and an incident hole with a phase difference @xmath33 , other coefficients can be obtained relative to @xmath33 from this matrix equation .",
    "these coefficients determine the the incident and outgoing current densities and the differential electric conductance@xcite .",
    "@xmath34\\\\ j_{n+1 } \\sim[k_-(1-|d_{n+1}(ev)|^2)+k_+|a_{n+1}(ev)|^2]\\\\ { di_1(ev)\\over dv}\\sim 1-|b_1(ev)|^2+|c_1(ev)|^2\\\\ { di_2(ev)\\over dv}\\sim 1-|d_{n+1}(ev)|^2+|a_{n+1}(ev)|^2\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    in general the incident current and the outgoing current do not match each other in a ns junction superlattice even in nsn junctions as pointed by xing et al@xcite .",
    "the key idea of this work is that the currents depend on the phase difference @xmath33 . after averaging over the phase the incident current just balances the outgoing current and",
    "so does the differential conductance .",
    "the phase difference @xmath33 has strong effect on the currents on the ns superlattice , as shown in fig.2 for a 2-ns - junction lattice .",
    "it is found that the probabilities of the reflected electron @xmath35 , the outgoing electron @xmath36 , the andreev reflection @xmath37 and the hole reflection @xmath38 vary periodically with the the phase difference @xmath33 , and so do the incident and outgoing currents .",
    "the total probability is always conserved at different phase differences @xmath39 .",
    "however , the incident and outgoing currents do not match each other at different phase differences(except two points ) .",
    "this result has never been reported in literatures and no one noticed that these two currents oscillate about the phase difference .",
    "xing et al simply averaged the two currents from only in - phase incidences of an electron and a hole to balance the two currents@xcite .",
    "one of the present authors assumed in an earlier paper a charge accumulation on the interfaces to conserve the currents@xcite .",
    "they all neglected the effect of the phase difference on the currents .",
    "an important result of the present computation is that the incident and outgoing currents have almost the same average value for different @xmath33 .",
    "this indicates that a great number of electrons and holes with random phase differences incident on the two leads of the ns junction superlattice will balance the two currents naturally .",
    "this provides a new but final mechanism for the balance of currents on the ns junction superlattice .    using the above mechanism the bias voltage is scanned for the currents as shown in fig.3 .",
    "it is seen that the currents from in - phase incidences of an electron and a hole obviously deviate from each other above the superconducting gap as reported by earlier works@xcite . after averaging over the phase difference",
    "the currents meet each other perfectly except small deviations at the three peaks of the currents .",
    "therefore , this averaging process successfully recovers the balance of currents in a ns superlattice .",
    "the differential conductance for different interface barriers under this phase - averaging mechanism is shown in fig.4(a ) . for smaller and smaller barrier potentials the differential conductance approaches the saturating value , i.e. fully conducting ns junctions .",
    "as the barrier increases the differential conductance shows stronger and stronger tunneling effect .",
    "the first resonance peak takes place slightly higher than the superconducting gap .",
    "this provides a technique for measuring superconducting gaps .",
    "the other two resonance peaks occur at about @xmath40 .",
    "these resonances need experimental verification . for a comparison to dong s work@xcite , where only in - phase incidence of electrons and holes is considered ,",
    "fig.4(b ) shows the differential conductance using the phase averaging method and dong s parameters . for weak barriers",
    "the present result is quite different from dong s result , but for strong barriers the present result approaches to dong s result .    , @xmath41 at different phase @xmath33",

    "superlattices of 2,4,8 and 16 ns junctions are studied in the above phase averaging mechanism .",
    "the differential conductances of them with barriers @xmath43 and @xmath44 are shown in fig.5(a , b ) .",
    "it is seen that in these two cases the ns junction superlattices have some sharp zero conductance resonances .",
    "especially those of the superlattice of 16 junctions has a full width at half maximum of @xmath45 , as seen in the inset of ( b ) , which is equivalent to a voltage of about @xmath46",
    ". this effect may find applications such as sensitive millivolt electronic switches , where a weak voltage increase induces a strong current response .",
    "finally it should be pointed out that the first resonance peak of the differential conductance does not occur exictly at voltages corresponding to the energy gap of the sc at small values of @xmath47 . as shown in fig.6",
    "until @xmath48 the first resonance peak moves to the gap position .",
    "this indicates that the measuring density of states using the technique of tunneling spectrum of metal - sc junctions requires a thickness of the sc layer above the minimum value .     of superconducting layers .",
    "other parameters see fig.2.,height=143 ]    in summary , the tunneling spectrum of an electron and a hole on a superlattice of ns junctions is computed using the btk approach .",
    "it shows a more abundant structure compared to that on a single ns junction , such as the sharp resonance above the gap . in particular , the sharper the resonance is the more layers the superlattice has .",
    "this effect may find applications in the electronic industry in the future .",
    "we find for the first time a mechanism to balance the incident and outgoing currents on the superlattice by averaging over the phase between the incident electron and the incident hole .",
