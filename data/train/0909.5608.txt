    "progress in many areas of science and its application is fueled by the ongoing progress to measure and structure small objects . in many cases ,",
    "light is used as a primary tool for reading or writing .",
    "but since light is subject to diffraction , a straightforward implementation is restricted to structures of order of the involved wavelength  @xcite .",
    "different methods have been invented to surpass this limit , such as near - field imaging  @xcite , techniques based on the selective addressing of nearby particles  @xcite , resolution enhancement due to non - classical effects  @xcite , multiphoton spectroscopy  @xcite , quantum lithography with classical fields  @xcite , or position - dependent dark states  @xcite .    among the most fundamental problems in this area",
    "is the measurement of the distance between two nearby quantum particles such as atoms .",
    "it has been recognized that a precise determination of the interparticle distance is possible down to distances far below the wavelength of the employed light based on their mutual interaction . for small distances ,",
    "the atoms are coupled by the dipole - dipole interaction , which modifies the optical properties of the system  @xcite .",
    "this was confirmed in a recent experiment  @xcite , and it was found that the resonance fluorescence exhibits characteristic features which enable one to determine the relative distance over a large range of small distances  @xcite .",
    "the resonance fluorescence has the advantage that it can be observed in the far field , and distance determination via fluorescence is not affected by the usual resolution limitations since the distance information is encoded in the frequency spectrum of the emitted light .",
    "similar ideas have also been used for the localization of single particles  @xcite .",
    "the existing distance measurement techniques based on the dipole - dipole interaction , however , are restricted to two two - level atoms in specific geometries , such as aligned along the propagation direction of the exciting laser field . in most practical cases",
    ", however , the relative orientation of the two nearby atoms is unknown , and for similar reasons , it is equally difficult to measure the relative orientation as the distance . thus the question arises , whether the ideas of  @xcite can be extended to the case of arbitrary orientation .",
    "it turns out that it is not meaningful to study the system of two two - level atoms in the case of arbitrary orientations .",
    "the reason for this is the appearance of dipole - dipole couplings between orthogonal transition dipole moments ( ddotdm ) in more general geometries  @xcite .",
    "the electric field emitted by one of the particles has not only a component corresponding to the emitting transition dipole moment , but also a component along the interparticle distance vector .",
    "the projection of the latter field component on a transition dipole moment in the second atom can be non - zero even if it is orthogonal to the emitting dipole  @xcite . in a real atom with magnetic level structure , these ddotdm lead to the population of excited states even if they are not driven by the external laser field .",
    "thus , the two - level approximation breaks down , and correct predictions can only be expected if the theoretical modelling includes complete zeeman manifolds including all occurring dipole dipole couplings  @xcite .    motivated by this , here we study the determination of relative distance and orientation of two nearby atoms in arbitrary geometry .",
    "the atoms are driven by a single resonant standing - wave laser field , and we make use of the far field resonance fluorescence intensity and spectrum as observables .",
    "each atom is modelled as a four - level system with one ground state ( total angular momentum zero ) and three excited states ( total angular momentum one ) , including all relevant dipole - dipole couplings occurring in arbitrary geometries .",
    "we start by analyzing the distance determination for the case of a known orientation , and present dressed - state interpretations of the obtained resonance fluorescence spectra in various cases of relevance .",
    "next , we describe a method to determine the interparticle distance for arbitrary orientation , which works as long as the particles are sufficiently close to each other .",

    "[ 2d - strong ] , the peaks in the spectrum of resonance fluorescence occur at approximately @xmath140 , @xmath164 , @xmath165 , @xmath166 , and @xmath167 . considering the mean values of the peak separation in the inner side band doublets as @xmath168 and that in the exterior side band doublets as @xmath160 , from eq .",
    "( [ eq - phi ] ) we obtain @xmath169 as the value of @xmath153 , which deviates from the true value by about @xmath170 .",
    "this deviation can be attributed to the imperfect determination of the rabi frequencies as the mean value of the two peaks in the doublets .",
    "increasing @xmath153 from the value that has been used in fig .",
    "[ 2d - strong ] , the position - dependent rabi frequencies change , until the sideband doublets corresponding to the two rabi frequencies start to overlap , as the two position - dependent rabi frequencies approach each other . in this case , it is difficult to estimate @xmath153 directly from the spectrum , since a clear identification of the different peaks is not obvious .",
    "one strategy is to increase the driving field intensity .",
    "since the peak separation @xmath171 is proportional to @xmath172 , this increase eventually leads to a splitting larger than the line widths of the involved peaks , such that an identification becomes possible . in any case",
    ", it can be concluded from overlapping peaks that @xmath153 is close to @xmath173 or @xmath174 , since then @xmath175 .    in summary",
    ", the relative orientation of the two atoms with respect to the laser can be determined using stronger laser fields .",
    "this works well if the position dependent rabi frequencies are different from each other , since then the spectral lines are well separated .",
    "this is the case for @xmath153 not close to @xmath173 or @xmath174 .",
    "accordingly , if the corresponding spectral peaks overlap , it can be concluded that @xmath153 is close to @xmath173 or @xmath174 .",
    "( color online ) fluorescence intensity emitted on the @xmath176-transitions observed in @xmath94 direction from two atoms on a surface .",
    "@xmath177 is the relative angle between laser polarization and interatomic distance vector .",
    "the green dashed lines indicate the four possible values of @xmath177 corresponding to a possible measured intensity indicated by the solid red line .",
    "the parameters are @xmath178 , @xmath63 and @xmath115 . ]    in this section , we consider the case of two atoms on a surface , driven by a laser field propagating perpendicular to the surface .",
    "thus , @xmath153 is fixed to @xmath173 , while @xmath57 is unknown . in this case , the two rabi frequencies experienced by the atoms are equal and independent of @xmath58 and @xmath57 .",
    "therefore , in contrast to the previous sec .",
    "[ unknown - phi ] , here , we determine the value of @xmath57 with the help of the resonance fluorescence intensity . in particular , we consider the @xmath176-intensity emitted by the dipoles @xmath179 and @xmath180 , measured by a detector placed in @xmath94 direction since there is no @xmath176-spectrum in @xmath92 direction .",
    "it turns out that the configuration is symmetric in the sense that a rotation of the laser polarization and the detectors around the @xmath152 direction is equivalent to a corresponding rotation of the interatomic distance vector .",
    "therefore , the measured resonance fluorescence intensity depends only on the relative angle @xmath177 between the laser polarization direction and the orientation of the two atoms @xmath57 on the surface . in fig .",
    "[ int - theta ] , we show this resonance fluorescence intensity versus the relative angle @xmath177 . a plot like this",
    "can either be recorded by rotating the sample in the @xmath92-@xmath94 plane , or by rotating the polarization vector of the laser field around its propagation axis .    from fig .",
    "[ int - theta ] , we find that the intensity is symmetric around @xmath181 , and it is easy to see that one value of @xmath176 intensity corresponds to at most four values of @xmath177 .",
    "these four values of @xmath182 can be roughly divided into the four ranges @xmath183 , @xmath184 , @xmath185 and @xmath186 , respectively .",
    "this can be understood by noting that the orthogonal coupling constants responsible for the @xmath176 intensity are the same for orientations @xmath57 , @xmath187 , @xmath188 and @xmath189 . at @xmath190 ,",
    "the @xmath176 intensity is zero since the orthogonal dipole dipole coupling constants @xmath158 and @xmath157 vanish at these points , see fig .",
    "[ fig - coupling](a ) .",
    "thus there is no population in states @xmath149 and @xmath150 , and the intensity of light emitted from these states is zero .",
    "the points of zero @xmath176 intensity @xmath191 correspond to situations in which the polarization vector is parallel , perpendicular , or anti - parallel to @xmath2 , respectively .",
    "since these values of @xmath177 with vanishing intensity can easily be identified , they allow to determine @xmath57 from the amount of sample or driving field polarization rotation required to reach these values . in particular , the symmetry point @xmath181 is well - suited for such a measurement .",
    "we have discussed methods to measure the relative distance and orientation of two nearby atoms in arbitrary geometry .",
    "our methods are based on the driving of the two atoms with a standing wave field , and on detection of the resonance fluorescence intensity and spectrum in the far field .",
    "the distance and orientation information is encoded in the scattered light via the position - dependent rabi frequencies and via the distance- and orientation - dependent dipole - dipole couplings . since unlike in previous studies",
    ", we consider the case of arbitrary orientation , the atoms must be described using complete zeeman manifolds in order to correctly model all relevant dipole - dipole couplings between parallel dipole moments as well as between orthogonal ones .    as preliminary work",
    ", we have analyzed the fluorescence spectra in particular known geometries , in order to identify dressed - state interpretations in the various limiting cases of interest .",
    "these in particular are the case of dominating laser - induced dynamics perturbed by the dipole - dipole interaction , and the case of dominating dipole - dipole coupling modified by the presence of a weaker laser field .",
    "next , we have shown that the case of dominating dipole - dipole interaction enables one to measure the distance between two nearby particles independent of the relative orientation .",
    "the reason for this is that the eigenvalues of the total hamiltonian describing the dynamics , and thus the position of the system dressed states , are independent of the orientation if the two atoms are undriven .",
    "we found that a weak driving field allows to probe these dressed states without perturbing the independence on the orientation .",
    "finally , we discussed the measurement of the relative orientation .",
    "we presented two methods .",
    "the first is based on the position - dependent rabi frequencies , which under certain conditions reveal the orientation of the two particles .",
    "the second method is based on the measurement of the resonance fluorescence intensity in a particular direction .",
    "this intensity is a measure for the population in the excited states not driven by the laser field , and therefore a signature for the magnitude of the dipole - dipole coupling between orthogonal dipole moments .",
    "we applied the two methods to the two cases of atoms confined in a two - dimensional waveguide , and to atoms on a surface , in which either the polar or the azimuthal angle of the interatomic distance vector is known .    in principle , these methods to determine the orientation can also be applied for the determination of both polar and azimuthal angle .",
    "the most promising ansatz is to make use of the resonance fluorescence intensity in a particular direction as discussed in sec .",
    "[ unknown - theta ] together with a rotation of the sample or of the driving laser polarization in order to fix one of the two angles at a value which renders the spectrum simpler ( e.g. , @xmath140 , @xmath173 or @xmath98 ) . then , the methods described in secs .",
    "[ unknown - phi ] and [ unknown - theta ] can be used to determine the other angle .",
    "the most straightforward implementation , however , strongly depends on the experimental possibilities to modify the setup . for example , in many cases , a rotation of the sample will be difficult .    for many applications ,",
    "the generalization to more than two particles is desirable .",
    "it remains to be seen whether methods based on the dipole - dipole interaction can also be applied in such cases .",
    "one approach could be to combine methods presented here together with a selective addressing of individual atoms at least in one or two dimensions , for example , by position - dependent state transfer .",
