    "this will prove the claim .",

    "this in turn implies that after applying  @xmath274 , the simplex  @xmath30 can be described by , and with @xmath368 for all @xmath369 , since the points @xmath370 satisfy all the constraints , and  .",
    "along with the standard unit vectors @xmath371 , we use @xmath372 to denote the origin @xmath250 .",
    "let @xmath373 .",
    "then @xmath374 because otherwise the system  , and defines a cylinder over @xmath351 and not a simplex .",
    "let @xmath375 be the point given by @xmath376 and @xmath377 . since @xmath378 for all @xmath379 and @xmath380",
    ", we have @xmath381 .",
    "we define the following @xmath360 regions : @xmath382    note that each @xmath383 .",
    "we consider @xmath351 as an @xmath59-dimensional simplex embedded in @xmath384 containing @xmath385 , then we can define the region @xmath386 for @xmath351 as in .",

    "therefore , if we view @xmath386 and @xmath388 as sets of @xmath0 , @xmath389 by theorem  [ thm : main ] . we now show that for every point @xmath390 in @xmath388 , there exists a segment @xmath391 of height  1 above @xmath390 that lies in @xmath392 ( recall @xmath234 is the vertex of @xmath30 not on the facet @xmath337 ) .",
    "this will then show that @xmath393 and we will be done .",
    "consider any @xmath394 for some @xmath395 .",
    "this means @xmath396 let @xmath397 . then @xmath398 .",

    "this is a lattice point in @xmath367 .",
    "therefore , @xmath407 .",
    "we now check that @xmath408 and @xmath409 both satisfy the constraints , and .",

    "we finally deal with @xmath417 .",
    "for this purpose we use the parallelotope @xmath418 which is again obtained using the form with @xmath419 . now the point @xmath390 can be represented as @xmath420 .",
    "we set @xmath421 and @xmath422 and @xmath423 .",
    "similar computations as before can be carried out to check that the entire segment @xmath424 $ ] of height  1 lies in this parallelotope .",
    "the proof of theorem  [ thm : multiple ] also shows how to explicitly construct a simplex  @xmath425 with more than one lattice point in the relative interior of a facet and @xmath426 when @xmath14 is one of the vertices .",
    "below we make the construction of such an example more concrete for the case @xmath427 .",
    "observe that for @xmath278 , we know that any maximal lattice - free triangle @xmath428 with more than one lattice point in the relative interior of a side is a type 2 triangle , according to the classification by dey and wolsey in  @xcite .",
    "then @xmath40 as described in the statement of theorem  [ thm : multiple ] is always a unimodular transformation of @xmath429 .",
    "so for @xmath278 , we can not construct such an example with multiple liftings .",
    "we construct @xmath430 as follows .",
    "one facet is given by @xmath431 .",
    "@xmath432 is a type  3 triangle ( following the classification of dey and wolsey  @xcite ) .",
    "@xmath433 is a homothetic copy of this type  3 triangle , blown up by a very large factor ( hence , the number of integral points in the interior of this facet can be made arbitrarily large ) .",
    "this implies that the vertex of @xmath30 opposite the facet @xmath431 is very close to the plane @xmath434 .",
    "now when @xmath14 is one of the vertices of @xmath30 on the facet @xmath431 , as observed in the proof of theorem  [ thm : multiple ] , the lifting region is a cylinder of height  1 over the lifting region of the type  3 triangle @xmath432 which has area @xmath435 , and so the volume of the lifting region for @xmath30 with this position of @xmath14 is less than 1 .",
    "this construction can be generalized to higher dimensions where @xmath432 is a maximal lattice - free @xmath436-simplex not equal to an affine unimodular transformation of @xmath437 .",
