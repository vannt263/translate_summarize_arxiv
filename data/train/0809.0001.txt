    "radio observations conducted over the past several years have uncovered a substantial fraction of magnetically active low mass stars and brown dwarfs .",
    "both quiescent and flaring emission are present , with luminosities that remain unchanged down to at least spectral type @xmath10 , in contrast to the declining activity seen in x - rays and h@xmath2 @xcite .",
    "depending on the nature of the radio emission mechanism , the inferred magnetic field strengths are @xmath11 kg with order unity filling factors @xcite .",
    "long term monitoring of several objects in the spectral type range m8l3.5 has further shown that the fields are generally stable for at least several years ( @xcite ; but see also @xcite ) , providing an important constraint on the lifetime of magnetic dynamos in fully convective objects .",
    "the strength , scale , and stability of the inferred fields is in good agreement with recent results from phase - resolved spectropolarimetry ( spectral type @xmath12 ; @xcite ) and zeeman broadening of feh lines ( spectral type @xmath13 ; @xcite ) , as well as with the most recent numerical dynamo simulations ( e.g. , @xcite ) .    equally important ,",
    "three ultracool dwarfs to date have been observed to produce periodic radio emission , with periods of 184 min ( 2mass j00361617 + 1821104 ; @xcite ) , 118 min (;",
    "@xcite ) , and 170 min ( lsr1835 + 3259 ; @xcite ) . in the case of 2m0036 + 18",
    "the periodic emission is sinusoidal , while in the latter two objects it is in the form of short duration pulses ( duty cycle of a few percent ) . in all three cases the observed periods are in good agreement with the known rotation velocities ( @xmath14 ) , indicating that the radio periodicity traces the stellar rotation .    as a result ,",
    "in addition to allowing a measurement of the magnetic field properties , radio observations provide a unique opportunity to measure the radii of late - m and l dwarfs through the combination of rotation period and velocity .",
    "however , since only @xmath14 values are known for these objects , there is an inherent degeneracy between the radius and the inclination of the rotation axis , @xmath15 . using a typical range of @xmath16 r@xmath7 for late - m and l dwarfs , the allowed range of inclinations span a relatively wide range of @xmath17 @xcite . to break this degeneracy , and thus measure the radius directly ,",
    "it is desirable to observe objects for which the inclination can be estimated .",
    "this is the case for binary systems with well determined orbital parameters if we make the reasonable assumption that the rotation and orbital axes are aligned @xcite .",
    "along with an estimate of the mass , we can thus place constraints on the mass - radius relation for ultracool dwarfs .    here",
    "we present simultaneous radio , x - ray , optical , and uv observations of one such system , the l dwarf binary 2massw j0746425 + 200032 ( hereafter , m0746 ) .",
    "these observations are part of a long - term project to study the field properties of ultracool dwarfs @xcite .",
    "while no x - ray or uv emission are detected , the radio and h@xmath2 emission exhibit clear periodicity , which along with the known orbital inclination and @xmath14 allow us to explore for the first time the radius and magnetic field topology of an l dwarf .",
    "we targeted the l dwarf binary m0746  ( l0+l1.5 ) due to the availability of its orbital parameters and rotation velocity , as well as previous detections in h@xmath2 .",

    "no radio emission was previously detected at 8.46 ghz to a @xmath27 limit of @xmath28 @xmath29jy @xcite , but subsequent to the observations presented here , @xcite published a radio detection at 4.86 ghz with @xmath30 @xmath29jy , based on a 2-hour observation .",
    "they further detect the possible emergence of a flare in the last few minutes of their observation .",
    "the simultaneous observations presented here were conducted on 2008 february 22 ut for a total of 8.4 hr in the radio ( 02:1110:34 ut ) , 8.83 hr in the x - rays ( 02:2011:10 ut ) , and 7.4 hr in the optical ( 05:4313:09 ut ) .",
    "observations with the  uv / optical telescope ( uvot ) took place intermittently between 01:32 and 09:54 ut with a total on - source exposure time of 2.15 hr .",
    "very large array observations were obtained simultaneously at 4.86 and 8.46 ghz in the standard continuum mode with @xmath31 mhz contiguous bands .",

    "photometry of the combined image results in a limit of @xmath43 erg @xmath38 s@xmath4 @xmath4 in a @xmath35 aperture .",
    "the ratio of uv to bolometric luminosity is @xmath44 .",
    "the radio emission from m0746  has an average flux density of @xmath45 @xmath29jy at 4.86 ghz , and @xmath46 @xmath29jy at 8.46 ghz .",
    "this is the first detection of the object at 8.46 ghz , with an increase by at least a factor of three compared to previous limits from june 2002 @xcite .",
    "the average fraction of circular polarization is @xmath47 ( @xmath27 ) and @xmath48 , respectively .",
    "the resulting average luminosities are @xmath49 and @xmath50 erg @xmath38 s@xmath4 hz@xmath4 , and the ratio relative to the bolometric luminosity is @xmath51 .",
    "these values are similar to those of previously - detected late - m and l dwarfs @xcite .",
    "the radio light curves are shown in figure  [ fig : radio ] .",
    "the most striking aspect of the radio emission is a set of bright ( @xmath52 mjy ) , short duration ( 1.2 min ) , circularly polarized ( @xmath53 ) , and _ periodic _ pulses at 4.86 ghz .",
    "the period measured from the well - defined peaks of the four detected pulses is @xmath54 min .",
    "no corresponding emission is detected at 8.46 ghz , indicating that the fractional bandwidth is @xmath55 .",
    "the pulses are detected at both intermediate frequencies of the 4.86 ghz band ( 4885 mhz and 4835 mhz ) , with no clear time delay implying that @xmath56 .",
    "the detailed temporal profiles of the pulses in total intensity and circular polarization are shown in figure  [ fig : flares ] .",
    "the profiles are similar in all four cases , with a rise time of about 20 s , followed by a decline timescale of 40 s. the high degree of stability of the period and emission properties demonstrate that the pulsing activity is the result of stellar rotation , rather than genuine episodic flares . in this context",
    ", the duty cycle of only @xmath57 implies that the radio emitting region has an azimuthal scale of only @xmath58 r@xmath59 ( assuming a height above the surface of about @xmath60 r@xmath59 ; @xcite ) .",
    "furthermore , since the measured period roughly agrees with the rotation velocity of m0746([sec : obs ] ) , we conclude that only one pulse is observed per rotation . along with the uniform sense of circular polarization",
    ", this indicates that we observe only one of the magnetic poles .",
    "the properties of the periodic pulses are similar to those observed in  and  @xcite , and point to a coherent emission process , most likely the electron cyclotron maser ( e.g. , @xcite ) . in this framework ,",
    "the radiation is produced primarily at the electron cyclotron frequency , @xmath61 hz , indicating that the magnetic field strength of m0746is @xmath1 kg . we can also place a limit on the electron density using the constraint that the plasma frequency , @xmath62 hz , has to be lower than @xmath63 .",
    "we thus find , @xmath64 @xmath65 .    a single short duration burst is also detected at 8.46 ghz ( 03:49:36 ut ; figure  [ fig : radio ] ) , with a peak flux of about 6 mjy , an identical duration to the 4.86 ghz pulses , and @xmath53 right circular polarization .",
    "no corresponding emission is detected at 4.86 ghz . in the context of electron cyclotron maser emission",
    ", this burst requires a stronger magnetic field component of @xmath66 kg .",
    "the burst is delayed by 72 min ( or @xmath67 ) relative to the preceding 4.86 ghz pulse , indicating that its emission region is not trivially related to that of the periodic pulses .",
    "this , and the lack of periodicity , suggest that the 8.46 ghz burst is either the result of transitory field dissipation ( a genuine flare ) , or that the physical conditions in its emission region ( field strength and/or density ) vary rapidly with time so as to suppress the emerging 8.46 ghz radiation during subsequent rotations . in either case , it is clear that the magnetic field strength ranges by at least a factor of two over the stellar surface and/or corona .    eliminating the contribution of the short duration pulses , we find baseline quiescent emission of @xmath68 @xmath29jy ( 4.86 ghz ) and @xmath69 @xmath29jy ( 8.46 ghz ) with no clear sign of variability ( figure  [ fig : radio ] ) .",
    "the quiescent emission is distinct from the narrow - band pulses since it is detected at both 4.86 and 8.46 ghz and it does not vary with the stellar rotation .",
    "the wide frequency range ( @xmath70 ) and inferred spectral index of @xmath71 are typical of gyrosynchrotron emission from a power law distribution of electrons with an energy index of @xmath72 @xcite .",
    "the lack of variability during 8.4 hours ( or four rotations ) suggests that the quiescent emission arises from particle acceleration in a uniform large - scale field component with order unity covering fraction .",
    "the h@xmath2 light curve is shown in figure  [ fig : halpha ] .",
    "the equivalent width ranges from 2.4 to 3.1  , with a mean value of about 2.7  .",
    "more importantly , the light curve is clearly periodic , with @xmath73 min in excellent agreement with the radio periodicity .",
    "this indicates that the radio and h@xmath2 emission arise from the same binary member .",
    "however , despite the identical periods , two clear differences are present between the h@xmath2 and radio light curves , which provide additional constraints on the geometry of the magnetic field .",
    "first , the h@xmath2 light curve is sinusoidal as opposed to the @xmath74 duty cycle of the radio pulses .",
    "this indicates that the h@xmath2 emission is produced by chromospheric plasma that covers a substantial fraction ( though less than 100% ) of the stellar surface and rotates relative to our line of sight .",
    "a small enhancement is ruled out since it would result in a sharp rise and decline through ingress and egress , respectively , and a flat - topped peak .",
    "in addition , the non - zero minimum equivalent width ( @xmath75  ) indicates that the sinusoidal variations are most likely due to a combination of rotation and field orientation effects , such that at any given time some fraction of the h@xmath2-emitting chromosphere is visible , with the maximum projected solid angle corresponding to the light curve peaks ( see  [ sec : geom ] ) .",
    "second , while the radio and h@xmath2 periods are identical , the phase of the two light curves differs ( figure  [ fig : halpha ] ) . in particular , we find that the h@xmath2 peaks lead the radio pulses by about 31 min , corresponding to 1/4 of the period ( or , equivalently 1/4 of a rotation ) .",
    "this lag indicates that the narrow beam which gives rise to the radio pulses is offset by about @xmath76 relative to the central axis of the chromospheric geometry .",
    "as we show in the following section , such a @xmath76 offset can not be accommodated in a simple dipole magnetic field model , unless there is a significant breaking of the symmetry between the field and emission regions .",
    "we have previously observed similar periodic h@xmath2 emission from the m8.5 dwarf , with @xmath77 hr well - matched to the rotation velocity of @xmath78 km s@xmath4 @xcite .",
    "this object has also been shown to produce radio bursts on a separate occasion @xcite . in the case of , on the other hand , despite the presence of periodic radio bursts @xcite no periodic h@xmath2 emission was evident in a separate 5.4 hr observation @xcite .",
    "it is thus possible that the magnetic field topology and stability timescale , as well as the viewing and magnetic axis orientation , play a role in determining the correlation ( or lack thereof ) between the periodic radio and h@xmath2 signals .",
    "taking into account the properties of the radio and h@xmath2 emission , we now investigate the magnetic field topology .",
    "this topology has to satisfy the following requirements : ( i ) the h@xmath2 emission is due to a large scale feature ; ( ii ) the non - zero minimum of the h@xmath2 light curve requires some fraction of the active chromosphere to be visible at all times ; ( iii ) the short duration radio pulses arise from a narrow region ; and ( iv ) the radio pulses lag the h@xmath2 peaks by 1/4 of the period .",
    "the first scenario we explore is a poloidal field with a simple dipole geometry .",
    "such fields have been inferred for convective mid - m dwarfs , such as v374 peg , from phase - resolved spectropolarimetry @xcite .",
    "this field geometry , and our line of sight orientation , are shown in figure  [ fig : geom1 ] .",
    "we assume that the inclination of the rotation axis relative to our line of sight is identical to the orbital axis , @xmath79 . in order to explain the radio pulses with a small duty cycle the magnetic axis has to be tilted relative to the rotation axis so that the beam emerging from the radial field at the poles sweeps into out line of sight once per rotation ( a  pulsar configuration \" ) .",
    "this configuration also explains the h@xmath2 modulation since the solid angle subtended by the poloidal field that is projected along our line of sight varies sinusoidally as the object rotates .",
    "specifically , as the field is tilted towards our line of sight we observe maximum h@xmath2 emission ( see panels _ a _ and _ b _ of figure  [ fig : geom1 ] for the geometry corresponding to the maximum and minimum h@xmath2 emission , respectively ) .",
    "unfortunately , while this simple model explains both the radio pulsations and the h@xmath2 light curve , it predicts a _ 1/2 phase lag _ between the two light curves , rather than the observed 1/4 phase lag .",
    "this is simply because the same phase of the rotation that orients the magnetic pole toward our line of sight ( resulting in a radio burst ) , also projects the minimum solid angle of the dipole field ( i.e. , minimum h@xmath2 emission ) .",
    "this effect is independent of our choice of orbital inclination ( figure  [ fig : geom1 ] ) .    alternatively , a toroidal dipole configuration , with the polar caps producing the brightest h@xmath2 emission ,",
    "will also produce radio bursts and sinusoidal h@xmath2 emission",
    ". however , in this configuration the two light curves would be exactly in phase since when the polar region is oriented toward our line of sight we will observe both an enhancement of the h@xmath2 emission and a radio pulse .",
    "having rejected the simple dipole poloidal and toroidal configurations , we are left with two possibilities to explain the 1/4 phase lag and the radio / h@xmath2 light curves .",
    "first , the magnetic field configuration is more complex and dominated by higher order multipoles . or second , there is a breaking of the symmetry either in the alignment between the poles and radio pulses , or between the poloidal / toroidal structure and the h@xmath2 emission . in the former case ,",
    "the simplest possibility is that the field is quadrupolar , leading naturally to the possibility of a 1/4 phase lag ( as opposed to 0 or 1/2 phase lag for the dipole field ) .",
    "however , the quadrupole can not produce uniform h@xmath2 emission since this would result in a non - varying light curve .",
    "instead , two of the quadrupole  lobes \" have to produce enhanced h@xmath2 emission  for example , one each in the northern and southern hemispheres .",
    "this configuration is shown in figure  [ fig : geom2 ] , and it appears to explain all of the available observations .    the alternative hypothesis of symmetry breaking can accommodate several possibilities . in the simplest scenario ,",
    "the radio emission does not emerge uniformly from the polar caps , but is instead produced in a localized region at lower latitude ( a  hot spot configuration \" ) . as the object rotates the hot spot moves in and out of our line of sight .",
    "this may work in both the toroidal and poloidal dipole configurations , since both can explain the sinusoidal h@xmath2 variability .",
    "however , the arbitrary location of the hot spot does not trivially explain the exact 1/4 phase lag observed here .",
    "more complex possibilities exist for both the high - order multipole scenario and the broken symmetry scenario .",
    "however , the stability of the radio pulses and the overall smooth h@xmath2 light curve suggest that the dominant topology is not significantly more complex than the scenarios we explored here .    to summarize , we find that the 1/4 phase lag between the radio and h@xmath2 light curves eliminates simple and symmetric dipole field configurations in which the radio emission is produced at the poles , and the h@xmath2 emission arises from plasma confined by the dipole field",
    "; in this configuration we expect the phase lag to be either zero ( toroidal field ) or 1/2 ( poloidal field ) .",
    "the simplest alternative is to either : ( i ) retain the polar origin of the radio emission , but appeal to a quadrupole field with non - uniform h@xmath2 emission ; or ( ii ) retain the dipole configuration as the origin of the h@xmath2 emission , but shift the location of the radio emission from the poles to a hot spot at lower latitude .",
    "we finally note that in any of the possible configurations , the quiescent non - variable radio emission is likely produced by the largest scale field structure , such that the projection effects caused by the rotation and magnetic axis tilt are minimized .",
    "the possible field topologies that give rise to the observed radio and h@xmath2 emission appear to be somewhat more complex than those inferred for mid - m dwarfs from spectropolarimetric observations @xcite .",
    "zeeman - doppler imaging points to predominantly dipole poloidal fields , particularly for objects with the lowest rossby numbers , @xmath80 , ( @xmath81 is the convective overturn timescale ) . for m0746",
    "we estimate @xmath82 d (  [ sec : mr ] ) , so the inferred rossby number is extremely small , @xmath83 , and we may have expected the dipole poloidal configuration to dominate .",
    "thus , our observations indicate that the field topology possibly evolves from mid - m dwarfs to l dwarfs , and that @xmath84 may not be the only relevant parameter .",
    "we next use the rotation period of m0746  as determined from the radio and h@xmath2 emission to measure its radius .",
    "we make the reasonable assumption that the inclination of the rotation axis , @xmath15 , is identical to the orbital orientation of @xmath19 @xcite .",
    "thus , the projected @xmath22 km s@xmath4 translates to an actual rotation velocity of @xmath85 km s@xmath4 . for a period of @xmath54 min ,",
    "the corresponding radius of m0746  is @xmath86 cm , or @xmath6 r@xmath7 . as far as we know , this is the first radius estimate ( without a @xmath87 degeneracy ) for an l dwarf through photometric variability .",
    "the total mass of the binary , inferred by @xcite from the orbital dynamics , is @xmath20 m@xmath7 .",
    "these authors further estimated a range of @xmath88 m@xmath7 for the primary by comparing the infrared photometry with dusty model isochrones .",
    "@xcite , on the other hand , argued that the primary mass is @xmath89 m@xmath7 , primarily as a result of an older age for the system .",
    "taking the conservative approach , we adopt here the wider range of values from @xcite .",
    "the inferred radius and mass are plotted in figure  [ fig : mr ] .",
    "also shown are the mass - radius relations from the evolutionary models of @xcite for ages of 0.5 , 1 , and 2 gyr and solar metallicity , as well as masses and radii for stars in the range @xmath90 m@xmath7 from a recent compilation by @xcite .",
    "m0746a  lies below the model predictions , @xmath91 r@xmath7 , by about @xmath9 .",
    "this is surprising since stars with known radii in the mass range @xmath92 m@xmath7 appear to generally agree with the model predictions @xcite .",
    "moreover , stars in the mass range @xmath93 m@xmath7 generally lie above the model predictions , possibly as a result of magnetic activity @xcite .",
    "it is somewhat surprising then , that a highly active l dwarf would underlie the same theoretical models .",
    "similarly , a recent estimate of @xmath94 r@xmath7 for the m8.5 dwarf  @xcite , based on similar periodic radio emission to that of m0746 , indicates that there is possibly a larger than expected dispersion in the radii of ultracool dwarfs .    with only a single object",
    "it is impossible to assess whether the apparent discrepancy indicates that the theoretical models break down across the sub - stellar boundary , or if this is the result of our assumption that the rotation axis is aligned with the orbital inclination .",
    "it is unlikely that the problem is with the value of @xmath14 since several groups have measured consistent values (  [ sec : obs ] ) .",
    "if we relax our assumption of @xmath79 , then the minimum allowed radius ( corresponding to @xmath95 ) is @xmath96 r@xmath7 .",
    "the radius corresponding to the 90% probability of the inclination axis distribution ( @xmath97 ) is @xmath98 r@xmath7 ( i.e. , there is only a 10% probability that @xmath99",
    "r@xmath7 ) .",
    "this latter value is marginally consistent with the theoretical predictions , but it requires the rotation axis to be severely misaligned with the orbital inclination .",
    "we presented simultaneous radio , x - ray , optical , and uv observations of the l dwarf binary m0746 .",
    "both the radio and h@xmath2 light curves are dominated by periodic emission , with @xmath100 min .",
    "the agreement between the two periods indicates that both arise from the same binary member , which we assume to be the primary star .",
    "we note that high angular resolution very long baseline array observations may pinpoint the origin of the radio emission .",
    "the observed period is well - matched to the rotation velocity of m0746 , and the assumption that the rotation axis is aligned with the orbital inclination allows us to infer a radius of @xmath101 r@xmath7 .",
    "combined with the estimated mass of @xmath8 m@xmath7 @xcite , we find that the radius is about 30% smaller than predicted from theoretical evolutionary models .",
    "it is unclear from this single object whether this is the result of a breakdown in the models , or an indication that the rotation and orbital axes are severely misaligned .",
    "both possibilities have important implications for our understanding of ultracool dwarfs and their formation mechanism .",
    "the combination of periodic radio and h@xmath2 emission further allows us to explore the magnetic field topology .",
    "the radio periodicity is in the form of short duration pulses with a duty cycle of @xmath57 and a uniform sense of circular polarization , while the h@xmath2 emission is sinusoidal and leads the radio emission by 1/4 of a phase .",
    "these emission properties can be explained in the context of a rotating mis - aligned magnetic field , but the observed phase lag rules out a symmetric dipole field .",
    "instead , we conclude that either the field is dominated by a quadrupole configuration , or the emission regions are not trivially aligned with a dipole field . in both scenarios",
    "the quiescent and non - variable radio emission most likely arises from the largest scales of the field , which are least affected by rotation and inclination effects .",
    "we note that the availability of simultaneous radio and optical data is crucial to our understanding of the field geometry . if only one band was available to us ( as in all previous cases of detected radio pulses ) , we would have concluded that the dipole topology is the most likely scenario .",
    "instead , the field configuration of m0746  appears to be somewhat more complex than those inferred for mid - m dwarfs from phase - resolved optical spectropolarimetry @xcite , although the vast difference in techniques may result in sensitivity to different field structures .",
    "regardless of the exact configuration , our observations support the general conclusions of recent numerical dynamo simulations @xcite , which predict large - scale fields at low rossby numbers .",
    "indeed , we estimate that the rossby number for m0746  is very low , @xmath102 .",
    "future observations of m0746  will allow us to determine the stability timescale of the magnetic field configuration , a crucial constraint on dynamo models .",
    "previous observations of the l3.5 dwarf 2m0036 + 18 @xcite indicated stability on a timescale of at least @xmath103 yr .",
    "in addition , continued surveys for radio emission from low mass stars and brown dwarfs , particularly in binary systems , are warranted . as demonstrated here , these observations , particularly in conjunction with optical spectroscopy , can provide important constraints not only on the mass - radius relation below @xmath104 m@xmath7 , but also on the magnetic field topology of fully convective objects .",

    "<S> the h@xmath2 emission exhibits identical periodicity , but unlike the radio pulses it varies sinusoidally and is offset by exactly 1/4 of a phase . </S>",
    "<S> the sinusoidal variations require chromospheric emission from a large - scale field structure , with the radio pulses likely emanating from the magnetic poles . </S>",
    "<S> while both light curves can be explained by a rotating mis - aligned magnetic field , the 1/4 phase lag rules out a symmetric dipole topology since it would result in a phase lag of 1/2 ( poloidal field ) or zero ( toroidal field ) . </S>",
    "<S> we therefore conclude that either ( i ) the field is dominated by a quadrupole configuration , which can naturally explain the 1/4 phase lag ; or ( ii ) the h@xmath2 and/or radio emission regions are not trivially aligned with the field . </S>",
    "<S> regardless of the field topology , we use the measured period along with the known rotation velocity ( @xmath3 km s@xmath4 ) , and the binary orbital inclination ( @xmath5 ) , to derive a radius for the primary star of @xmath6 r@xmath7 . </S>",
    "<S> this is the first measurement of the radius of an l dwarf , and along with a mass of @xmath8 m@xmath7 it provides a constraint on the mass - radius relation below 0.1 m@xmath7 . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the radius is about @xmath9 smaller than expected from theoretical models , even for an age of a few gyr . </S>",
    "<S> the origin of this discrepancy is either a breakdown of the models at the bottom of the main sequence , or a significant mis - alignment between the rotational and orbital axes . </S>"
