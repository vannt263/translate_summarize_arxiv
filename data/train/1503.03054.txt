    "molecular clouds in their vast complexity hold the key to understanding the early stages of the star formation process .",
    "magnetic fields and turbulence are the two main mechanisms that dictate the structural , dynamical and evolutionary properties of these clouds , through their competition against gravity .",
    "their role in the onset of star formation can be studied best in quiescent non  star - forming regions , where stellar feedback is not present .",
    "one such region is the polaris flare , a translucent molecular cloud at a distance between 130 pc and 240 pc @xcite , discovered by @xcite .",
    "it is believed to be in the early stages of its formation , since it does not exhibit any signs of active star formation @xcite .",
    "co observations have provided invaluable information on the turbulence signatures in the densest parts of the cloud @xcite .",
    "recently , the herschel space telescope mapped over 15 deg@xmath2 of the cloud in dust emission @xcite .    the structure of the magnetic field of a cloud , as projected on the plane of the sky , can be probed by observing polarized radiation .",
    "the polarization of starlight transmitted through a cloud is believed to be caused by dichroic extinction due to aspherical dust grains that are partially aligned with the magnetic field .",
    "this alignment causes the polarization direction of the light of background stars to trace the magnetic field direction of the cloud as projected on the plane of the sky .",
    "the same alignment process causes the thermal emission of these dust grains to be polarized in the direction perpendicular to the magnetic field .",
    "information on the plane - of - the - sky magnetic field of the polaris flare has been provided for the first time through polarized dust emission @xcite .",
    "these data , however , are limited by the instrumental resolution and confusion along the line of sight .",
    "a mapping of the region in polarized starlight , which is complementary to the dust emission but suffers from different limitations , is necessary to resolve these issues .",
    "we obtained optical polarization measurements of stars projected on 10 deg@xmath2 of the polaris flare region with robopol .",
    "the robopol instrument is a 4-channel optical polarimeter with no moving parts , other than a filter wheel ( ramaprakash et al .",
    ", in prep ) .",
    "it can measure both linear fractional stokes parameters @xmath3 and @xmath4 simultaneously , thus avoiding errors caused by the imperfect alignment of rotating optical elements and sky changes between measurements ( polarization , seeing conditions ) .",
    "each star in the field of view creates four images ( spots ) on the ccd displaced symmetrically in the horizontal and vertical directions .",
    "a mask supported by four legs is positioned at the centre of the field of view .",
    "this allows targets that are centred on the mask to be measured with four times lower sky noise than the rest of the field . a typical image seen with robopol",
    "is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : typicalfield ] .",
    "the instrument has a @xmath5 field of view , enabling the rapid polarimetric mapping of large areas of the sky .",
    "robopol is equipped with standard johnson - cousins @xmath6- and @xmath7-band filters and is mounted on the 1.3-m , f/7.7 ritchey  crtien telescope at skinakas observatory in crete , greece .",
    "it has been operating since may 2013 .",
    "robopol has been monitoring the optical linear polarization of a large sample of gamma - ray bright blazars for the past two years @xcite .",
    "in addition , the instrument is being used for long - term monitoring of be x - ray binaries @xcite .",
    "observations of optical afterglows of gamma - ray bursts have also been conducted with robopol @xcite .",
    "more complete descriptions of the instrument and data reduction pipeline are given in ramaprakash et al .",
    "( in prep . ) and @xcite , respectively .",
    "the data presented here are the first obtained from an analysis of the instrument s entire field of view .",
    "we present the observational details in section [ sec : observations ] . in section [ sec : pipelinecuts ] we describe the methods used for analysing sources in the entire field of view .",
    "we present and discuss the results of our observations in section [ sec : pf ] and summarize our findings in section [ sec : summary ] .",
    "observations were taken during 25 nights from august to november 2013 , totaling around 60 hours of telescope time .",
    "the observations covered an area of 10 deg@xmath2 : @xmath8 [ 122.6@xmath9 , 126.0@xmath9 ] , @xmath11 [ 24.7@xmath9 , 27.9@xmath9 ] .",
    "the area was initially divided into 275 non - overlapping fields spaced 13.2 arcminutes apart ( slightly larger than the size of the robopol field of view ) . of them ,",
    "227 were observed by the end of the period .",
    "the number of observations of each field ranges between 2 and 6 , with 93% of all fields having been observed at least 3 times .",
    "the exposures were either 120 or 180 seconds long , with 95% of the exposures having lasted 180 s. all observations were taken in the r band .",
    "previous studies with robopol concentrated on sources either exclusively within the mask , or with the addition of some selected sources in the field of view around the central target .",
    "although the data reduction pipeline presented by @xcite was designed for the entire robopol field of view , its implementation in this particular project showed the need for some adjustments and additions .",
    "sources outside the mask present a number of challenges .",
    "some are common in most polarimetric studies in the optical , while others are due to the particular design of the instrument .",
    "a measurement may be adversely affected by one of the following sources of systematic error :    * large - scale optical aberrations * proximity to the mask and its legs * proximity to the ccd edge * proximity to other sources * selection of apertures for photometry * dust on optical elements    an additional systematic error has already been identified and discussed by @xcite .",
    "a rotation in the polarization reference frame of the telescope with respect to that of the sky causes all angles to be larger by @xmath12 .",
    "all polarization angle measurements presented in this paper have been corrected for this .",
    "this section outlines the analysis of observations and the methodology adopted to control these systematic effects .",
    "the measurement of the fractional linear polarization ( @xmath13 ) at the low polarization regime which is relevant for interstellar polarization , being always positive , is biased towards values larger than the true ( intrinsic ) polarization @xcite .",
    "thus , @xmath13 measurements should be debiased to find their most probable intrinsic value . in the analysis",
    ", we consider only sources with signal - to - noise ratios ( @xmath14 ) so that errors are approximately normally distributed .",
    "the maximum - likelihood estimator of the true value of @xmath13 found by @xcite for measurements with @xmath15 significance is : @xmath16 we extend this formula to @xmath14 and use it to debias all measurements of @xmath13 .",
    "( top ) and @xmath17 ( bottom ) .",
    "right : residual @xmath18 ( top ) and @xmath17 ( bottom ) after subtracting the fitted model .",
    "each square panel shows values on the ccd binned in 100 cells .",
    "each cell is colored according to its average value . ]",
    "large - scale aberrations caused by the optical system are corrected by the instrument model , as presented by @xcite .",
    "the model is created by placing an unpolarized standard star at many positions across the field of view and finding the best - fitting parameters that cancel the global , instrumentally - induced polarization and vignetting .",
    "the instrument model has been found to perform equally well , regardless of telescope pointing position ( which may result in different telescope stresses ) and after multiple removals and re - installations of the instrument on the telescope .",
    "the set of models that were created for these tests have been combined into one with improved performance with respect to that presented by @xcite .",
    "below we estimate the systematic uncertainty that remains after the model correction .       and",
    "@xmath17 across the ccd , after the subtraction of the model fit ( q : dotted , u : solid ) .",
    "the vertical lines show the standard deviation of each distribution . ]",
    "[ fig : modelu ] shows the uncorrected ( left ) and corrected ( right ) @xmath18 ( top ) and @xmath17 ( bottom ) values across the ccd derived by using this combined model .",
    "the data are binned in 100 cells of 39 arcsec width and the mean value is plotted in each one . on average , 2.4 star measurements contribute to each cell .",
    "the residuals appear to be homogeneous across the ccd .",
    "the distributions of residual @xmath18 and @xmath17 of the combined model are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : residual - dist ] .",
    "vertical lines show the standard deviation of each distribution ( @xmath19 = 0.0034 , @xmath20 = 0.0031 ) .",
    "statistical errors of measurements of unpolarized standards are an order of magnitude lower than these standard deviations , thus their contribution to this scatter can be ignored .",
    "therefore , we take the systematic uncertainties in @xmath18 and @xmath17 to be @xmath21 .    from now on , in order to estimate total uncertainties in @xmath18 and @xmath17 , we add statistical and systematic uncertainties in quadrature , @xmath22 @xmath23    the total uncertainty in @xmath18 and @xmath17 can be propagated to find the total uncertainty in fractional linear polarization ( @xmath13 ) and electric vector position angles ( evpa or @xmath24 ) using the equations : @xmath25 @xmath26    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ tab : data ]",
