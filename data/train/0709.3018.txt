    "the aggregation of many individual preferences into a single , `` social '' preference is a long - studied problem in mathematical social sciences which has more recently also been considered from a statistical mechanics viewpoint . here by `` preference ''",
    "we mean simply a ranking of say @xmath0 objects , i.e. a complete ordering e.g. from the favorite downwards .",
    "a minimal consistency requirement for preferences is that they should be transitive , i.e. if @xmath3 is preferred to @xmath4 and @xmath4 to @xmath5 , then @xmath3 should be preferred to @xmath5 .",
    "it is however well known that as soon as @xmath0 exceeds 2 the construction of the aggregate preference runs into the condorcet problem @xcite : starting from transitive individual preferences , the social preference may turn out to be intransitive , i.e. contain a cycle of the type @xmath6 ( meaning a preferred to b etc . ) .",
    "the probability with which an intransitive ranking emerges from random individual preferences ( ` impartial culture assumption ' @xcite ) has been studied in the mathematical economics literature in the past @xcite . remarkably , this bottleneck is present to different degrees for all aggregation methods one considers and can be removed only at the cost of loosening some of the requirements that a social choice should satisfy .    among the different aggregation methods ,",
    "the pairwise - majority rule ( pmr ) has been the most studied as it appears to be more robust to the above mentioned requirements . according to pmr , the social preference corresponds to that derived by comparing objects pairwise via a simple majority rule .",
    "recently it has been possible to quantify the extent to which pmr is effective as a social choice rule by computing the probability that the aggregate of @xmath7 random preferences is transitive within a statistical mechanics framework @xcite .",
    "it is similarly important to understand how the situation changes if voters interact before casting their ballot . in @xcite ,",
    "a random - field type of interaction with conformism has been considered , and it has been shown , among other results , that an interacting population may reach consensus on one of @xmath0 issues more easily the larger is @xmath0 .",
    "a scenario that has received much attention recently is the so - called deliberative approach @xcite , where voters discuss the alternatives before the vote and eventually change their preferences .",
    "the idea is that discussion should lead to preference harmonization and structuring and thus drastically reduce the probability of an intransitive social choice .    in this paper",
    "we study the deliberative scenario in a dynamical model of @xmath8 interacting agents or voters , whose preferences are initialized to transitive random ones to simulate the original diversity of opinions .",
    "the key ingredient of the model is that an agent interacts only with agents whose preferences are sufficiently close to his . in such `` neighborhoods '' , by conformity he aligns to the pmr - aggregate preference ( if transitive ) .",
    "this generalizes a classical social interaction mechanism investigated previously in e.g. @xcite . as a measure of similarity between orderings we use the kemeny distance @xcite , widely used in the social sciences ( it is related to their hamming distance )",
    "this choice is arbitrary and it is likely that distances more sensitive to the position in the orderings may give different results .",
    "a social preference is then formed via pmr after every agent has updated his preference .",
    "we are interested in studying the behavior of a specific macroscopic observable , namely the probability of a transitive aggregate ranking as a function of time ( number of system - wide updates ) and of the range of interaction ( the maximum distance within which agents interact ) .",
    "our main result is that there is an optimal interaction range ( or more properly a window of ranges ) for which the condorcet problem is much less likely to occur than in the non - interacting case , and that the frustration decreases as a function of both time and @xmath0 .",
    "the model will be fully defined in the following section .",
    "its complexity has prevented analytical approaches on our side .",
    "our results are thus obtained by means of numerical simulations .",
    "consider @xmath8 agents ( labeled by @xmath9 ) each of whom ranks @xmath0 alternatives @xmath10 .",
    "a ranking is a complete transitive ordering such as @xmath11 . at time zero",
    ", every agent possesses a transitive preference ranking selected randomly with uniform probability among the @xmath12 possible ones .",
    "every ranking can be split uniquely into pair - wise comparisons of @xmath13 pairs of distinct alternatives .",
    "we label pairs as @xmath14 and denote by @xmath15 agent @xmath16 s preferences on pair @xmath17 . specifically , @xmath18 if @xmath19 and @xmath20 otherwise ( ties are excluded ) .",
    "the dissimilarity between the rankings of agents @xmath16 and @xmath21 is given by their kemeny distance @xmath22 where the sum runs over all @xmath13 pairs .",
    "@xmath23 measures simply the normalized number of pairs that are ranked differently by agents @xmath16 and @xmath21 , irrespective of the position in the alignment , or in other words it is the number of adjacent pairwise switches needed to convert one preference order into the other .",
    "we introduce an interaction range @xmath24 and define the neighborhood of @xmath16 as the set of agents whose rankings have a kemeny distance of at most @xmath1 from his : @xmath25 at every time step , an agent is selected randomly and interaction takes place .",
    "specifically , the agent changes his ranking to that derived from a pmr among agents in his neighborhood if the latter is transitive , otherwise he keeps his preference unchanged . in subsequent interactions",
    "the agents enters with his new ranking . after a system - wide update ( sweep )",
    "is performed a global vote by pmr takes place , the social ranking is computed and agents move into the next round .",
    "we describe details of the pmr procedure below ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "we notice that as @xmath1 decreases from 1 to 0 the interaction becomes more and more of a local nature .",
    "however it is to be expected that the number of surviving rankings decreases in time as the local interaction mimics conformist behavior on the side of agents .",
    "furthermore , neighborhoods evolve in time ( also inside a single system - wide update ) .",
    "the basic function which is numerically evaluated in this study is the probability that pmr yields a social transitive ranking , denoted by @xmath26 .",
    "it is evaluated by counting the number of times a collective transitive order is obtained through pmr , out of a large number of samples .",
    "we monitor the evolution of @xmath26 in time specifically varying the number @xmath27 of sweeps . in absence of interaction",
    ", @xmath26 decays as @xmath0 increases , though less fast than the nave guess @xmath28 corresponding to the ratio of the number of transitive rankings to the total number of binary vectors encoding different rankings of @xmath0 objects @xcite .    coming to the details of pmr voting , for each pair @xmath29 ,",
    "let @xmath30 where @xmath31 is heaviside function .",
    "clearly , @xmath32 if the majority of agents prefers @xmath33 over @xmath34 , whereas @xmath35 if the majority ranks @xmath34 over @xmath33 . the aggregate order ( either local or global ) emerges from separate majority votes over all pairs , that is from a computation of the @xmath36 , for all @xmath29",
    ". there is a simple method to check whether a ranking defined through the different @xmath36 s is transitive .",
    "indeed each @xmath36 can be seen as the element of a @xmath37 matrix since @xmath38 .",
    "let us then write explicitly @xmath36 as @xmath39 and let @xmath40 one easily understands ( e.g. by induction starting from small @xmath8 and @xmath0 ) that if the pmr ranking is transitive , then the @xmath0-vector @xmath41 will contain once and only once each of the integers @xmath42 as elements .",
    "in fig . [ figure3 ] we display the time evolution ( in units of sweeps ) of @xmath43 as a function of @xmath1 for a system of size @xmath44 ( the choice of @xmath45 alternatives is here only a matter of convenience ; qualitatively identical results occur for larger values of @xmath0 ) .",
    "@xmath26 as a function of the interaction range @xmath1 and of the number of sweeps @xmath27 .",
    "parameters : @xmath44 , @xmath46 ; average over @xmath47 samples.,width=377 ]    it is evident that after just a cycles the dependence of @xmath43 on the radius of interaction becomes stable .",
    "it is clear , also from this graph , the onset of a peculiar regime in a window of interaction radii comprised between @xmath48 and @xmath49 , where the probability of getting a transitive ranking is considerably enhanced with respect to the non interacting case .",
    "it is also worth noting that , until @xmath1 is sufficiently small , @xmath43 is almost constant and coincident with the corresponding probability in the non interacting case ; then it abruptly increases and reaches the value of @xmath50 at @xmath51 . for larger ranges ,",
    "@xmath43 decreases again to the non - interacting case .    in order to characterize the scaling of the distribution with increasing system size , in fig .",
    "[ figure2 ] we show the dependence of @xmath43 on the number of agents @xmath8 and on the radius of interaction @xmath1 ( the asymptotic states is reached in all cases shown ) .",
    "the reference value for a non - interacting system is @xmath52 .",
    "@xmath43 as a function of the radius of interaction @xmath1 and the number of agents @xmath8 after @xmath53 sweeps .",
    "average over @xmath47 samples .",
    "for @xmath54 and @xmath55 one recovers the value observed for the non interacting case.,width=377 ]    remarkably , the existence of an optimal interaction range is reinforced by increasing the number of alternatives , as shown in fig .",
    "[ figure4 ] .",
    "@xmath26 normalized by the corresponding @xmath56 for non interacting agents as a function of @xmath1 .",
    "parameters are the same as in the previous figure , except for @xmath57 , for which @xmath58 and the average is performed over 500 samples . here , @xmath59.,width=377 ]    note that for @xmath60 the probability of getting a transitive majority ranking is still that of the non - interacting case . for @xmath61",
    "this probability increases , with a gradual gain which abruptly falls down for larger @xmath1 .    to shed light on these observations , we report in fig .",
    "[ figure5 ] , for different @xmath0 , the @xmath1-dependence of the average fraction of neighbors , i.e. the average number of agents with preference orders whose kemeny distance does not exceed @xmath1 .",
    "average fraction of neighbors as a function of @xmath1 and @xmath0 .",
    "parameters are the same as in the previous figure.,width=377 ]    this parameter is computed , after @xmath27 sweeps , by recording the number of neighbors of each agent in a sample and averaging over samples . by increasing @xmath0 there is a marked tendency of the curve to acquire a sigmoidal shape .",
    "the average fraction of neighbors increases gradually , with a maximum rate at @xmath62 , and saturates to @xmath63 for large enough @xmath1 .",
    "this result indicates that there is a cooperative transition between a local regime and a global , effectively long range , regime . in the former ,",
    "each agent interacts and confronts its preference order only with a small mass of the other agents ; in the latter , each agent s opinion is influenced by the opinions of most of the others .",
    "note that in the cases @xmath64 and @xmath60 the @xmath1 dependence is monotonously increasing , but no sign of cooperativity is present yet , in accordance with the result of the previous figure .    to investigate further this transition",
    ", we consider in fig .",
    "[ figure6 ] the @xmath1 dependence of the mean fraction of different transitive preference orders present in a population of agents after a long update cycle .",
    "mean fraction of different transitive preference orders surviving after @xmath59 sweeps as a function of @xmath1 .",
    "parameters are the same as in the previous figure.,width=377 ]    remember that initially , before the update cycle starts , transitive preference orders are randomly distributed among the agents .",
    "below @xmath65 the interaction preserves all the possible diversity of preference orders , while above the cooperative transition has taken place and there is a reduction of diversity . for @xmath61 at @xmath51 only about ten percent of the possible different transitive rankings are still present among the agents .",
    "note that for sufficiently large @xmath1 one observes an increase of different transitive preference order , as is to be expected in view of the fact that the interaction mechanism in systems with very large and very small @xmath1 is qualitatively similar .",
    "this phenomenon should be confronted with the result in fig .",
    "[ figure7 ] , where the @xmath1-dependence of the fraction of samples with only one surviving preference order .",
    "fraction of samples in which only one ranking survives after @xmath59 sweeps as a function of @xmath1 .",
    "parameters are the same as in the previous figure.,width=377 ]    note , that at @xmath55 this fraction coincides , for different @xmath0 , with the corresponding @xmath26 values of the non interacting case .",
    "figures [ figure6 ] and [ figure7 ] show that update interaction cycles induce , if the cooperative transition is established , a reduction of the different transitive preference orders among which to choose in the pmr . moreover , for large enough interaction radii , when practically each agents interacts with all the others , there is a marked tendency towards the emergence of a dominant transitive preference order . as is to be expected , this tendency is contrasted by the increase in @xmath0 , the number of alternatives .    in fig .",
    "[ figure8 ] and [ figure9 ] we show the pair distribution function of the kemeny distances among individual rankings , as a function of @xmath1 .",
    "we consider in these figures the discriminating cases : @xmath60 and @xmath46 .",
    "pair distribution function @xmath66 of the kemeny distances between the preference orders of pairs of different agents , after the interaction process .",
    "@xmath60 @xmath59 ; @xmath44 and @xmath47 samples.,width=10 ]    pair distribution function @xmath66 of the kemeny distances @xmath67 between the preference orders of pairs of different agents , after the interaction process .",
    "@xmath46 @xmath59 ; @xmath44 and @xmath47 samples.,width=10 ]    in both cases , if @xmath1 is less than @xmath68 , the pair distribution has a maximum for @xmath69 ( corresponding to @xmath70 adjacent pairwise switches needed to convert one ranking into the other ) .",
    "this is essentially the pair distribution function corresponding to the initial random assignment of preference orders . as an effect of the interaction",
    "it is seen that , when the cooperative transition is completed , i.e. for large enough @xmath1 , a peak at @xmath71 emerges , corresponding to the formation of a big clique of agents with the same transitive preference order .",
    "this points to an interesting herding effect , whose details deserve further investigation .",
    "we have studied the emergence of the condorcet problem in a deliberative multi - agent scenario . we have studied in particular if and how the frustration expressed by condorcet s paradox can be mitigated by interaction among the agents , before the global pmr voting takes place .",
    "we have introduced an interaction scheme based on local pmr voting among `` neighboring '' agents , whose preference orders are close , to mimic conformist behavior .",
    "our results point to the existence of two regimes controlled by the interaction range @xmath1 , with a crossover from one to the other at intermediate @xmath1 . for low @xmath1 ,",
    "the probability of getting a transitive outcome is unaffected ( with respect to the non - interacting case ) , whereas for sufficiently large @xmath1 a marked enhancement in @xmath26 is observed , which increases with @xmath0 , the number of alternatives to be ranked .",
    "a herding phenomenon is furthermore observed which reduces the repertoire of different surviving rankings .",
    "so , if the radius of interaction is too large it is difficult to have a transitive pmr outcome , but in the case it is reached that happens because all the agents practically vote in the same way .",
    "these results support the claims that deliberative systems reduce the chance for the formation of cycles in the social choice , provided the interaction range lies in the optimal window",
    ". it would be important to get a deeper insight on the microscopic details of this model .",
    "in particular the computation of two point correlations , like the probability that after an interaction cycle two agents taken at random belong to the same neighborhood , or the probability that after the interaction two initially separated neighborhoods become overlapping .",
    "the further investigation of the clustering dynamics ( including coalescence of neighborhoods ) could provide important insight also in directions different than statistical mechanics @xcite .",
