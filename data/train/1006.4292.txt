    "the presence of metals and x - rays in star forming regions affect processes like gas heating , ionization degree and cooling time , and do so up to column densities of 10@xmath9 @xmath10 that are typical of dense cores ( e.g. , hocuk & spaans 2010 ; meijerink & spaans 2005 ) . at the same time",
    ", star formation in the early universe and inside active galactic nuclei may depend strongly on the ambient metallicity and radiation background as well as on mechanical feedback from supernovae ( e.g. , greif et al .",
    "2010 ) .       the simulation with x - rays results in a much flatter imf slope than the one without radiation , @xmath11 after @xmath12 years of evolution ( see figure 5 ) .",
    "this is much flatter than the salpeter slope of -1.35 that we find for the simulation without x - rays , which has a typical cloud temperature of 10 k due to cosmic ray heating only .",
    "these trends are maintained at higher dynamical times , @xmath13 .",
    "the main reason for the change in imf comes from the jeans mass .",
    "the efficient x - ray heating yields temperatures in the cloud of 50 k at densities as high @xmath14 @xmath7 and columns of @xmath15 @xmath10 .",
    "we find that the sink particles still grow in mass after @xmath16 and experience competitive accretion ."

    "<S> star formation is regulated through a variety of feedback processes . in this study </S>",
    "<S> , we treat feedback by metal injection and a uv background as well as by x - ray irradiation . our aim is to investigate whether star formation is significantly affected when the ism of a proto - galaxxy enjoys different metallicities and when a star forming cloud resides in the vicinity of a strong x - ray source . </S>",
    "<S> we perform cosmological enzo simulations with a detailed treatment of non - zero metallicity chemistry and thermal balance . </S>",
    "<S> we also perform flash simulations with embedded lagrangian sink particles of a collapsing molecular cloud near a massive , 10@xmath0 m@xmath1 , black hole that produces x - ray radiation .    </S>",
    "<S> we find that a multi - phase ism forms for metallicites as small as @xmath2 solar at @xmath3 , with higher ( @xmath4 ) metallicities supporting a cold ( @xmath5 k ) and dense ( @xmath6 @xmath7 ) phase at higher ( @xmath8 ) redshift . a star formation recipe based on the presence of a cold dense phase leads to a self - regulating mode in the presence of supernova and radiation feedback . </S>",
    "<S> we also find that when there is strong x - ray feedback a collapsing cloud fragments into larger clumps whereby fewer but more massive protostellar cores are formed . </S>",
    "<S> this is a consequence of the higher jeans mass in the warm ( 50 k , due to ionization heating ) molecular gas . </S>",
    "<S> accretion processes dominate the mass function and a near - flat , non - salpeter imf results . </S>"
