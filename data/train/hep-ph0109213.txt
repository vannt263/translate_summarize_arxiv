    "hadron models set up to understand the structure of the nucleon should respect the constraints imposed by chiral symmetry .",

    ", nucleon observables have to receive contributions from the pion cloud .",
    "we recently suggested @xcite a baryon model as based on earlier consideration @xcite , the perturbative chiral quark model ( pcqm ) , which includes relativistic quark wave functions and confinement as well as the chiral symmetry requirements .",
    "the pcqm was successfully applied to @xmath6-term physics @xcite and extended to the study of electromagnetic properties of the nucleon .",
    "similar perturbative quark models have also been studied in @xcite .",
    "although the lagrangian for this model fulfils the @xmath7 symmetry , it is in general nontrivial to identify the explicit hadron dynamics which leads to well - known predictions of current algebra for various observables .",
    "for instance , the @xmath1-wave @xmath0 scattering at threshold is such a process in the presence of a pion cloud .    as was shown by weinberg and tomozawa @xcite , a model - independent expression for the @xmath1-wave @xmath0 scattering lengths in terms of the pion mass and the weak decay constant",
    "is obtained when using the current algebra relations and the partial conservation of axial current ( pcac ) assumption : @xmath8 to reproduce this result for the @xmath0 scattering lengths one can also use a specific lagrangian in the nucleon field refered to as the weinberg - tomozawa ( wt ) term @xcite-@xcite .",
    "formulated on the quark level @xcite the wt term is part of the effective weinberg lagrangian @xcite .",
    "this form can be derived from the original @xmath6-model @xcite by performing a chiral - field dependent rotation on the quark field .",
    "thereby , the transformation eliminates the nonderivative coupling of the chiral ( pion ) field with the quarks and replaces it by a nonlinear derivative coupling ( axial vector term + wt term + higher order terms in the chiral field ) . both realizations of chirally - symmetric lagrangians ( the original @xmath6-model and the weinberg type lagrangian ) should  priori give the same result for the @xmath0 @xmath1-wave scattering lengths .",
    "starting point of present considerations is the pcqm @xcite which , as dictated by global chiral symmetry , originally employs a nonderivative coupling between the pions and the quarks @xcite .",
    "the purpose of the present work is first to demonstrate how , in the context of this chiral quark model , the wt result can be consistently obtained to the order of accuracy we are working in .",
    "second , after fulfilling the constraint of reproducing @xmath0 @xmath1-wave scattering at threshold , we include the photon field in our formalism .",
    "we determine first - order ( @xmath9 ) radiative corrections to the nucleon mass and the pion - nucleon amplitude at threshold .",
    "we thereby predict the full set of @xmath2 electromagnetic low - energy couplings ( lecs ) originally defined in the effective lagrangian of chiral perturbation theory ( chpt ) .",
    "quantitative information about these constants is important for the ongoing experimental and theoretical analysis of decay properties of the @xmath10 atom ( for a detailed discussion see ref .",

    "we extended the pcqm to include the electromagnetic field . again , both lagrangian versions are fully equivalent when introducing the photon field by minimal substitution .",
    "we apply the formalism to radiative corrections of low - energy nucleon observables . in the limit of a heavy nucleon mass",
    "we express the electromagnetic mass shift of nucleons and the @xmath9 corrections to the @xmath0 amplitude in terms of the proton charge form factor only .",
    "final expressions can be shown to be independent of the gauge choice .",
