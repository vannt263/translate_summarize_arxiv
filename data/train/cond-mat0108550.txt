    "spatiotemporal chaos , where the physical variables vary in time and space in a seemingly random way , may arise when a spatially extended system is driven far from the primary instability  @xcite . in some systems ,",
    "spatiotemporal chaos is understood as a complicated evolution of the amplitude field , and the behavior can be described in terms of the dynamics of this field  @xcite . in some other systems ,",
    "the dynamics of defects plays a primary role in the transition to spatiotemporal chaos ; cases include rayleigh - bnard convection  @xcite , electrohydrodynamic convection  @xcite , chemical patterns  @xcite , and faraday instabilities  @xcite .",
    "several mathematical models have been proposed to describe the transition to spatiotemporal chaos in spatially extended physical systems , including amplitude chaos  @xcite , phase turbulence  @xcite , defect - mediated turbulence  @xcite , and invasive defects  @xcite , but the understanding is still far from complete .    in this paper , we study patterns around the transition from the @xmath1 subharmonic hexagonal pattern to spatiotemporal chaos in granular layers with large aspect ratio ( @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is characteristic horizontal size of the layer , and @xmath8 is the depth of the layer ) .",
    "the layers are subject to a sinusoidal oscillation in the direction of gravity .",
    "the oscillation is characterized by two nondimensional control parameters , @xmath9 and @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is the amplitude of the oscillation , @xmath12 is the frequency of the oscillation , @xmath13 is the period of the oscillation , and @xmath14 is the acceleration due to gravity .",
    "we also define the nondimensional depth of the layer , @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is the diameter of the particle .",
    "various subharmonic standing wave patterns have been observed as a function of @xmath17 and @xmath18  @xcite ; however , the transition to spatiotemporal chaos has not previously been investigated . in this study , we show that the transition to spatiotemporal chaos in granular patterns is due to the intrinsic dynamics of oscillated granular layers ; a large lengthscale undulation of the layer and an oscillatory momentum transfer across a kink .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section ii presents the methods in the simulation and the experiment .",
    "kinks , phase bubbles , and randomly moving labyrinths are described in section iii . in section",
    "iv a large lengthscale undulation of the layer and its relation to the nucleation of a phase bubble is described .",
    "section v discusses how a phase bubble shrinks and disappears . in section",
    "vi , the prediction and observation of transient @xmath4 and @xmath5 patterns are presented , and the paper is concluded in section vii .",
    "in the absence of well - validated macroscopic governing equations for vertically oscillated granular layers , current theoretical investigation proceeds at a more basic level , that of individual particles .",

    "@xcite developed an event - driven inelastic hard sphere molecular dynamics simulation of this system , by implementing the collision operators in ref .",
    "this collision model conserves both linear and angular momentum , but allows energy to be dissipated through inelastic collisions and surface friction .",
    "the normal coefficient of restitution @xmath19 depends on the magnitude of the normal component of relative colliding velocity @xmath20 , where @xmath21 .",
    "the accurate form of @xmath19 is not known ; it was assumed that @xmath22 for @xmath23 less than a crossover velocity @xmath24 , and @xmath25 otherwise .",
    "the value of @xmath26 was set to make @xmath19 continuous at @xmath27 .",
    "here we use @xmath28 and @xmath29 .",
    "the simulation results are not sensitive to the form of @xmath19 for @xmath30 . the tangential impulse is given by a coefficient of friction @xmath31 times the normal impulse , with a cutoff corresponding to the crossover from a sliding contact to a rolling contact .",
    "the crossover ratio of the relative surface velocity after the collision to that of before the collision , @xmath32 , was set to @xmath33 as suggested in ref .",
    "@xcite , and @xmath31 was set to @xmath34 .",
    "the values of these parameters were chosen to fit the wavelength of the pattern obtained in the experiments with lead particles , for three different control parameter sets .",
    "these fitting parameters reproduced the observed patterns quantitatively throughout the control parameter space  @xcite .",
    "the collisions between the grains and the container were treated in the same way as the collisions between grains .",
    "the mass of the container was assumed to be infinitely large compared to that of the granular layer .",
    "we performed three types of simulations : ( 1 ) 2d , ( 2 ) quasi-2d , and ( 3 ) 3d .",
    "we simulated a 2d or quasi-2d layer as vertical cross - section of a 3d layer ( figs . 3 and 10 ) .",
    "a quasi-2d layer is a 3d layer whose dimension in one direction is short enough ( @xmath35 ) to be homogeneous in that direction ; these simulations run much faster than a fully 3d simulations yet yield the same statistical information ( figs . 7 , 8 , and 11(a ) ) .",
    "we performed simulations of 3d layers of square - shape with horizontal periodic boundary condition ( fig .",
    "11(b ) ) and of 3d layers of cylindrical shape with side wall , when we compare with the experiments ( figs . 4 , 9 ) .",
    "experiments were conducted with vertically oscillated layers of granular material consisting of spherical bronze particles of mean diameter 165 @xmath36 ( spherical lead particles of diameter 165 @xmath36 were used only for fig .",
    "the nondimensional depth of the layer , @xmath37 , was in the range of 5 to 15 , and the aspect ratio @xmath38 ranged from 40 to 150 .",
    "both circular and rectangular containers with various sizes were used in the experiments .",
    "the container was mounted on an electro - magnetic shaker , and it oscillated sinusoidally in the direction of gravity with a single frequency , in the range 10 - 150 hz .",
    "the value of @xmath17 varied from 0 to @xmath39 .",
    "the container was evacuated to a pressure of 4 pa to reduce the role of interstitial gas .",
    "the container was encircled by a ring of leds , and the images were taken by a digital camera mounted above the container .",
    "a more detailed description of the experimental apparatus is found in ref .",
    "the phase diagram of the patterns in oscillated granular layers has been reported previously  @xcite .",
    "we present a new phase diagram in fig .",
    "1 that shows the details above the @xmath1 subharmonic hexagonal pattern regime , which is the focus of the current study .      much of the dynamics of the patterns in this system can be understood from the single inelastic ball model  @xcite . in this section",
    "we review the results of this model in the @xmath40 and @xmath1 patterns regime .",
    "the single ball model is a one - dimensional model of the oscillated granular layer , which approximates the center of mass of the layer as a completely inelastic ball ( @xmath41 ) on an oscillating plate .    for @xmath42 ,",
    "the magnitude of the acceleration of the container exceeds @xmath14 during a fraction of the cycle , so that the layer loses contact with the container when the plate s acceleration becomes @xmath43 , and then the layer makes a free flight until colliding with the container later . in the @xmath40 square / stripe pattern regime ,",
    "the flight time of the layer is a fraction of the oscillation period @xmath13 , and the layer leaves and hits the container every cycle ( fig .",
    "2(a ) ) . in this regime ,",
    "the magnitude of the acceleration of the container at the collision is less than @xmath14 ( the ball hits below the dot - dashed line in fig .",
    "2(a ) ) , and the layer stays on the container until the acceleration becomes @xmath43 again ( the intersection of the dot - dashed line and the trajectory of the plate ) .",
    "the layer leaves the container at the same phase angle of the oscillation at every cycle ; hence the take - off velocity or the flight time is single - valued .",
    "this regime is called _ period 1 , n = 1 _ , which means the period of the trajectory is single - valued ( _ period 1 _ ) and the ball collides with the plate every cycle ( _ n = 1 _ ) . for @xmath44 ,",
    "the trajectory consists of two different flight times , and the flight time is still a fraction of the period @xmath13 ( fig .",
    "2(b ) , _ period 2 , n = 1 _ ) ; it corresponds to the @xmath40 hexagonal pattern . in this regime ,",
    "the magnitude of the container acceleration at collision is larger than @xmath14 once every other cycle ( the ball hits above the dot - dashed line in fig .",
    "2(b ) ) . at this collision",
    ", the layer leaves the container immediately , and the take - off velocity and flight time are smaller than those of the other cycles , in which the ball stays on the container until the acceleration of the container becomes @xmath43 .    for values of @xmath17 above @xmath45 , the flight time of the layer exceeds @xmath13 , and the layer hits the container once every other cycle . in this regime ,",
    "the layer can hit the container either on odd cycles or on even cycles ; the trajectory becomes degenerate ( the trajectory in the @xmath40 hexagonal pattern regime is also degenerate , and a @xmath40 hexagonal pattern can have a phase discontinuity defect which is different from a kink ) .",
    "the trajectory of single inelastic ball in the @xmath1 square / stripe pattern regime ( @xmath46 ) is shown in fig .",
    "2(c ) ( _ period 1 , n = 2 _ ) .",
    "when @xmath17 is increased to @xmath47 , the trajectory of the layer consists of longer and shorter flight times , and a bifurcation to the @xmath1 hexagonal pattern occurs ( fig .",
    "2(d ) , _ period 2 , n = 2 _ ) . at @xmath48 , another bifurcation to _",
    "period 1 _ and _ n = 3 _ state occurs , which corresponds to a @xmath4 flat pattern ; however , the @xmath4 flat pattern has not been observed before , and the layer has been known to exhibit spatiotemporal chaos in this regime .",
    "we found transient @xmath4 and @xmath5 patterns in this study ( see sec .",
    "since the layer collides with the container every other cycle for @xmath49 , domains @xmath2 out of phase may coexist in the layer . when these opposite phase domains coexist , there is a phase discontinuity line defect between the adjacent phase domains , which we call a kink  @xcite ( two sides of a phase discontinuity defect in the @xmath40 hexagonal pattern regime are not at opposite phases , and this defect is not a kink ) . in the experiments ,",
    "kinks are created by inhomogeneous initial conditions or external perturbations such as side wall friction or tilt of the container ; see sec .",
    "iv . a sequence of an @xmath1 pattern with kinks obtained from a 2d simulation",
    "is shown in fig .",
    "3 , where one domain has fully developed pattern , and the other is nearly flat .",
    "an animated movie is in _ http://chaos.ph.utexas.edu / research / moon_.      as @xmath17 is increased further from the @xmath1 hexagonal pattern regime , the layer exhibits spatiotemporal chaos , which is not included in the single ball model .",
    "snapshots obtained from the experiments and simulations of this regime are shown in fig .",
    "as @xmath17 is increased above a critical value @xmath50 in the @xmath1 hexagonal pattern regime , a small localized region spontaneously changes its phase angle , and this region becomes enclosed by a kink .",
    "we call this localized region a phase bubble ; see fig .",
    "4(c ) and 4(d ) .",
    "phase bubbles suddenly ( in one cycle ) pop up at random locations , and they shrink and disappear over several tens to hundreds of cycles . the nucleation rate increases with @xmath17 , and",
    "the decay time depends on the control parameters and the initial size .",
    "@xmath50 varies with the depth of the layer and the material used ; it is @xmath51 in the experiment with bronze particles and @xmath52 , and is @xmath53 in layers of lead particles with @xmath52 , in 3d . in the simulations we find that the value of @xmath50 is a few percent smaller in 2d or quasi-2d layers than in 3d .",
    "a phase bubble is not just a defect in the @xmath1 hexagonal pattern of this system ; it arises due to an inherent instability of the oscillated granular layer ( see sec .",
    "phase bubbles are spontaneously nucleated even without side wall friction or any other external perturbation , while kinks for @xmath54 are never created spontaneously without an external perturbation .",
    "as @xmath17 is further increased , the nucleation rate of phase bubbles increases faster than the decay rate , and the layer eventually exhibits spatiotemporal chaos in the form of randomly moving labyrinths ( fig .",
    "4(e ) and 4(f ) ) .",
    "note that there are a few kinks of closed form ; _ i.e. _ , phase bubbles . in this regime ,",
    "labyrinthian kinks move around in the container in a seemingly random fashion .",
    "each phase domain of labyrinths collides with the container every other cycle , and an @xmath1 subharmonic pattern is superposed on it .",
    "the layer behavior does not show any qualitative difference up to @xmath55 , the highest value investigated in the experiment .    as a phase bubble shrinks ,",
    "it becomes more circular , as though it had a surface tension .",
    "this behavior is more clearly observed with phase bubbles in the @xmath40 flat pattern regime , because there is no superposed pattern .",
    "phase bubbles are not nucleated spontaneously for @xmath56 , but we can make them from initial conditions with inhomogeneous phase , by suddenly decreasing @xmath17 from the randomly moving labyrinths regime to the @xmath40 flat pattern regime .",
    "such phase bubbles in the @xmath40 flat pattern regime are shown in fig .",
    "an animated movie is in _ http://chaos.ph.utexas.edu / research / moon_.    a kink acts on the pattern as if it were a boundary , and the pattern tries to rotate perpendicular to the kink .",
    "these `` boundaries '' of the layer have irregular shape ; a well - ordered hexagonal pattern does not form in the phase bubble regime because phase bubbles break the long range order of the pattern ( fig .",
    "4(c ) and 4(d ) ) .",
    "pattern selection is also affected by the size of a phase bubble , or the width of a phase domain in the randomly moving labyrinths regime , because of the `` boundary condition '' of the pattern imposed by the kink .",
    "when a phase bubble is larger than the wavelength of the hexagonal pattern , the phase bubble has an @xmath1 hexagonal pattern superposed on it .",
    "otherwise , an @xmath1 stripe pattern is superposed because it is the only pattern that can fit in such small domains .",
    "we find in the simulation that for @xmath17 slightly below @xmath50 , the bottom of the layer exhibits an undulation , of which length scale is much larger than the wavelength of the pattern . in this section ,",
    "we discuss how the undulation leads to the nucleation of phase bubbles .    in the @xmath1 hexagonal pattern and the phase bubble regime ,",
    "the temporal dynamics of the layer is sensitive to a small change in the flight time .",
    "this is the case also in the single ball model ; in the @xmath1 hexagonal pattern regime , the ball immediately leaves the container at every other collision , so that the instantaneous velocity of the container at this collision becomes the take - off velocity of the ball .",
    "thus , if the velocity is changed slightly and the flight time is increased , the take - off velocity at the next flight becomes smaller ; this velocity may be too small for the ball to fly over the container during the following two cycles , so that the ball collides with the container in the very next cycle ( fig .",
    "6 ) . in a real layer ,",
    "the flight time has some fluctuation due to the undulation ; the mechanism in fig .",
    "6 will create a phase bubble when the undulation is big enough ( fig .",
    "7 ) .    the power spectral densities ( psd s ) of the top and the bottom of a layer are obtained from the simulation .",
    "spectra for the values of @xmath17 slightly below @xmath50 show that another peak with small wave number appears as @xmath17 approaches @xmath50 ( fig .",
    "for smaller @xmath17 ( @xmath57 for this case ) , the shape of the bottom of the layer is slaved to the top of the layer and has the same wavelength as the top ; psd s have peaks only at the wavelenght of the pattern and its subharmonics .",
    "the nucleation rate of phase bubbles monotonically increases with @xmath17 ; we hypothesize that the amplitude or the growth rate of the undulation increases with @xmath17 . above some value of @xmath17 ( @xmath58 ) ,",
    "the nucleation rate exceeds the decay rate , and phase bubbles or kinks accumulate in the layer until each phase domain reaches the shortest length scale that can not have another kink in it ; _ i. e. _ , this sets the width of the labyrinths . as a result",
    ", the layer is filled with a superposition of phase bubbles which connect to one another , forming non - closed kinks .",
    "we propose that the randomly moving labyrinth pattern results from the above mechanism .",
    "_ i.e. _ , randomly moving labyrinths may be understood as a `` saturated '' state of phase bubbles .",
    "there are two more mechanisms responsible for the creation of phase bubbles or kinks : ( 1 ) side wall friction and ( 2 ) tilt of the layer . in an infinitely extended layer without side walls ,",
    "kinks are formed only by the undulation of the layer , or nucleation of phase bubbles , if the layer is perfectly level . in the simulation , side walls",
    "are easily eliminated by imposing horizontal periodic boundary condition ; however , the layer size is always finite in the experiment , and the side wall effect can not be completely eliminated . in the experiment",
    ", the friction due to the side walls disturbs the oscillatory motion of the layer , which often creates kinks .",
    "this effect becomes more and more important as @xmath17 is increased .",
    "there are some phase bubbles in contact with the side wall in fig .",
    "4(c ) and 4(d ) , which are kinks created by the side wall friction . in the randomly moving labyrinths regime ,",
    "the side wall effect is one of the major reasons for the decay of @xmath4 or @xmath5 transient patterns ( see sec .",
    "in addition to the above effect , tilt of the container also creates kinks .",
    "this is the main mechanism of the creation of kinks for @xmath54 in the experiment .",
    "once formed , a phase bubble shrinks as if it had a surface tension , and then disappears ( fig .",
    "we now discuss why this happens .    when the layer collides with the plate , a density wave forms and propagates across the boundary of a phase bubble ( a kink ) .",
    "this density wave initiates a collisional momentum transfer in the horizontal as well as in the vertical direction , across a kink ( fig .",
    "a sequence of side views of a kink in a 2d layer is in fig .",
    "10 , which shows the relation for the density wave to the momentum transfer . at @xmath59 in fig .",
    "10 , the left half of the layer collides with the plate ( horizontal bar ) and is pushed up .",
    "it becomes compact and nearly static with respect to the plate , acting as if it were a part of the container . at this moment , the rest of the layer is still falling and is dilated .",
    "the two parts of the layer interact at the kink , and a density wave forms at the interface due to the large density gradient .",
    "the density wave propagates toward the dilated part until the compact part loses contact with the plate .",
    "the density wave drives a collisional momentum transfer and pushes the interface toward the dilated part ( the kink is shifted rightward at @xmath60 compared to its earlier location at @xmath59 ) . in the next cycle",
    ", the same process occurs in the opposite direction , and the kink is pushed back to its original position ( not shown in fig .",
    "10 ) , provided that the phase difference is exactly @xmath2 ( then both parts of a 2d layer are symmetric ) . as a result ,",
    "the momentum flux across a kink in a 2d or quasi-2d layer oscillates symmetrically with a period of @xmath61 , with no net translational motion ; thus a phase bubble in a 2d or quasi-2d layer never shrinks but only oscillates symmetrically ( fig .",
    "11(a ) ) .",
    "the mechanism of the density wave and the momentum transfer across a kink in a 3d layer is the same as in a 2d / quasi-2d layer ; however , in a 3d layer , there is a geometric effect which is absent in a 2d / quasi-2d layer : the two sides of a kink are not symmetric unless the kink is straight .",
    "as the particles at the front of the density wave are nearly static with respect to the plate , the momentum flux is roughly proportional to the number of particles at the front of the density wave and the velocity of the container . for a kink with nonzero local curvature , the number of particles at the front of the density wave for the two successive cycles are different , even if the two sides of the kink are exactly @xmath2 out of phase .",
    "thus the momentum transfer in one direction is always larger than that of the other .",
    "this leads to an asymmetric momentum transfer , or an asymmetric oscillatory motion of a kink .",
    "consequently , the total net momentum flux across the boundary of a phase bubble over a multiple of @xmath61 is always inward , because its boundary is a kink of a closed shape . as a result ,",
    "a phase bubble shrinks and disappears .",
    "an asymmetric oscillation of a boundary of a phase bubble is shown in fig .",
    "the difference in the numbers of particles at the interface of the density wave for the two consecutive cycles is approximately proportional to the local curvature of the kink .",
    "thus , the speed of a kink is roughly proportional to the local curvature , leading to an effective surface tension .",
    "there are other mechanisms driving the motion of a kink in the experiment , which are minor compared to the previously discussed curvature - dependent geometrical effect : ( 1 ) _",
    "non-@xmath2 phase difference effect _ and ( 2 ) _ the finite mass ratio effect_. firstly , we have assumed in the above discussion that both sides of a kink are exactly @xmath2 out of phase ; if this were not the case , the impact from the container for two successive cycles would be different , and the oscillation of a kink would be asymmetric , even if the local curvature were zero . this is why a secondary forcing can control the motion of a straight kink , as was experimentally observed by aranson _",
    "et al . _",
    "secondly , if the difference in the mass of each phase domain of the layer is not negligible compared to mass of the container , the impact by the container on both domains of the layer are different , and a net translational motion of a kink is induced , even if it has zero local curvature and the phase difference is @xmath2 .",
    "we call this _ the finite mass ratio effect_. in the experiment , a kink in the @xmath40 flat pattern regime eventually travels to the center of the container , until the impacts from the container on both phase domains are balanced ; it was observed in refs .",
    "this effect is absent in the simulation , because the mass of the container is assumed to be infinitely large compared to the mass of the layer .",
    "until now , no standing wave pattern has been observed above the @xmath1 hexagonal pattern regime in the phase diagram in fig .",
    "1 . in this section",
    "we present the first observation of the @xmath4 flat and @xmath5 square / stripe patterns .",
    "these patterns were found first in the simulations , which motivated the experiments .",
    "we start the discussion with the single ball model .",
    "the single ball model predicts an infinite cascade of bifurcations with increasing natural number @xmath64 , for increasing @xmath17 ( there are small chaotic windows along @xmath17 , but this is not important in this discussion ) . for the granular layers , these bifurcations correspond to the following patterns : +    ( 200,100)(0,0 ) ( 20,90)@xmath65 flat ( 20,50)@xmath66 squares / stripes ( 20,10)@xmath66 hexagons ( 40,80)(0,-1)15 ( 40,40)(0,-1)15 ( 105,12)(1,0)45 ( 150,12)(0,1)81 ( 150,93)(-1,0)85 ( 160,50)@xmath67     + where the initial @xmath64 is @xmath68 . this model predicts a bifurcation from an @xmath1 to an @xmath4 state ( _ period 1 ,",
    "n = 3 _ ) at around @xmath69 , however , in the experiments , the cascade of bifurcation stops at @xmath70 .",
    "we discussed how the undulation of the layer leads to the nucleation of phase bubbles in sec .",
    "if the undulation of the layer could be avoided , we expect that @xmath4 flat and @xmath5 square / stripe patterns would exist . to test this conjecture , we performed a series of numerical simulations of a small layer ( @xmath71 and @xmath72 with @xmath73 ) in the randomly moving labyrinths regime for ( @xmath74 ) = ( 8 - 11 , 0.8 - 1.0 ) , using periodic horizontal boundary conditions . in these simulations , we observed that the layer collides with the plate every third cycle , and that the dynamics is stable up to order of @xmath75 cycles ; we conclude that if a larger layer followed this behavior , @xmath4 or @xmath5 subharmonic patterns would exist .    in larger layers",
    ", the undulation of the layer can not be completely avoided , but can be suppressed at least during a short time by preparing a flat and compact layer as an initial condition ; when @xmath17 is quickly increased from the flat pattern regime to where @xmath4 or @xmath5 subharmonic patterns are predicted by the single ball model ( @xmath76 ) , a @xmath4 or @xmath5 pattern is found in the simulation .",
    "later these transient patterns were found in the laboratory experiments as well , as fig .",
    "12 and 13 illustrate .",
    "these patterns emerge as the primary instability of the layer in this regime , but they are invaded and overtaken by either kinks formed due to the side wall friction ( fig .",
    "12 ) or by the undulation of the layer ( fig . 13 ) . as a result ,",
    "the domain of these transient patterns gradually decreases and is eventually taken over by randomly moving labyrinths .",
    "these transient patterns last up to several hundreds of cycles , depending on the initial condition , control parameters , and the system size .",
    "we have shown that phase bubbles play a critical role in the transition to spatiotemporal chaos in the patterns formed by vertically oscillated granular layers .",
    "phase bubbles spontaneously form first in the f/4 hexagonal pattern regime as the acceleration @xmath17 is increased . at larger @xmath17",
    ", the rate of nucleation of bubbles grows faster than the decay rate , leading ultimately to a spatiotemporally chaotic pattern of randomly moving labyrinths . in a qualitatively similar way",
    ", the formation of defects has been found to lead to spiral defect chaos  @xcite and to chaos in a model with invasive defects  @xcite .",
    "we have investigated the mechanism of the nucleation and the dynamics of phase bubbles and randomly moving labyrinths , using inelastic hard sphere molecular dynamics simulations and experiments .",
    "we have found that a vertically oscillated granular layer has a large scale undulation , even without interstitial gas ( sec .",
    "the undulation constitutes an inherent feature of oscillated granular layers , like the standing wave pattern formation , and can not be avoided ; above some critical value of @xmath17 in the @xmath1 hexagonal pattern regime , the undulation of the layer gives rise to the nucleation of a phase bubble .",
    "the spontaneous nucleation of kinks in vertically oscillated 2d or quasi-2d granular layers for large @xmath17 has been called `` subharmonic instability ''  @xcite or `` arching ''  @xcite , but the mechanism has not been elucidated .",
    "these two phenomena are all essentially phase bubbles in 2d or quasi-2d oscillated granular layers .",
    "we also found that a kink of nonzero curvature has a net translational motion due to the asymmetric collisional momentum transfer across a kink ( sec .",
    "the local speed of a kink is roughly proportional to the local curvature ; a phase bubble shrinks as if it had a surface tension and then disappears , because it is a kink of a closed form .",
    "we showed that shrinking of a phase bubble and translational motion of a kink are essentially the same phenomena .",
    "finally , based on the understanding of kinks , we predicted transient @xmath4 and @xmath5 subharmonic patterns and observed them for the first time ( sec .",

    "<S> we use inelastic hard sphere molecular dynamics simulations and laboratory experiments to study patterns in vertically oscillated granular layers . </S>",
    "<S> the simulations and experiments reveal that _ phase bubbles _ spontaneously nucleate in the patterns when the container acceleration amplitude exceeds a critical value , about @xmath0 , where the pattern is approximately hexagonal , oscillating at one - fourth the driving frequency ( @xmath1 ) . </S>",
    "<S> a phase bubble is a localized region that oscillates with a phase opposite ( differing by @xmath2 ) to that of the surrounding pattern ; a localized phase shift is often called an @xmath3 in studies of two - dimensional systems . </S>",
    "<S> the simulations show that the formation of phase bubbles is triggered by undulation at the bottom of the layer on a large length scale compared to the wavelength of the pattern . </S>",
    "<S> once formed , a phase bubble shrinks as if it had a surface tension , and disappears in tens to hundreds of cycles . </S>",
    "<S> we find that there is an oscillatory momentum transfer across a kink , and this shrinking is caused by a net collisional momentum inward across the boundary enclosing the bubble . at increasing acceleration amplitudes </S>",
    "<S> , the patterns evolve into randomly moving labyrinthian kinks ( spatiotemporal chaos ) . </S>",
    "<S> we observe in the simulations that @xmath4 and @xmath5 subharmonic patterns emerge as primary instabilities , but that they are unstable to the undulation of the layer . </S>",
    "<S> our experiments confirm the existence of transient @xmath4 and @xmath5 patterns .    2 </S>"
