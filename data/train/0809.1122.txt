    "supersymmetry is the leading candidate for the physics beyond the standard model ( sm ) .",
    "it not only solves the gauge hierarchy problem , but also provides a dynamical mechanism for electroweak symmetry breaking and a natural candidate for the dark matter .",
    "the minimal version , the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) , has suffered from what so called little hierarchy problem and the @xmath6 problem .",
    "an extension with an extra singlet superfield , known as the next - to - minimal supersymmetric standard model ( nmssm ) was motivated to provide a natural solution to the @xmath6 problem .",
    "the @xmath6 parameter in the term @xmath7 of the superpotential of the mssm naturally has its value at either @xmath8 or zero ( due to a symmetry ) .",
    "however , the radiative electroweak symmetry breaking conditions require the @xmath6 parameter to be of the same order as @xmath9 for fine - tuning reasons .",
    "such a conflict was coined as the @xmath6 problem @xcite . in the nmssm ,",
    "the @xmath6 term is generated dynamically through the vacuum - expectation - value ( vev ) , @xmath10 , of the scalar component of the additional higgs field @xmath11 , which is naturally of the order of the susy breaking scale .",
    "thus , an effective @xmath6 parameter of the order of the electroweak scale is generated .",
    "the nmssm was recently revived because it was shown that it can effectively relieve the little hierarchy problem @xcite . due to the additional higgs singlet field and an approximate pq symmetry",
    ", the nmssm naturally has a light pseudoscalar higgs boson @xmath0 .",
    "it has been shown @xcite that , in most parameter space that is natural , the sm - like higgs boson can decay into a pair of light pseudoscalar bosons with a branching ratio larger than @xmath12 .",
    "thus , the branching ratio of the sm - like higgs boson into @xmath13 would be less than @xmath14 and so the lepii bound is effectively reduced to around 100 gev @xcite .",
    "the dominance of @xmath15 mode for the intermediate higgs boson has significant impacts on the higgs search strategies @xcite .",
    "the most useful channel for intermediate higgs boson , @xmath16 and @xmath17 would be substantially affected because @xmath18 lowers by a factor of a few .",
    "so is the @xmath19 in @xmath20 production .",
    "new search modes via @xmath21 are mandatory .",
    "for example , @xmath22 for @xmath23 via @xmath24 production with at least one charged lepton and @xmath25-tags in the final state has been shown to afford a clean signal of high significance and a full higgs mass reconstruction at the lhc @xcite . the associated higgs production with gauge bosons or @xmath26 pairs",
    "was shown to be effective @xcite .",
    "similar studies at the tevatron were also performed @xcite . other possibilities like @xmath27 @xcite and @xmath28 @xcite",
    "can further enhance the signal , especially when @xmath29 . in the extreme limit of zero mixing with the mssm pseudoscalar ,",
    "the singlet - like @xmath0 can decay into a pair of photons . in this case , @xmath30 @xcite .",
    "the light pseudoscalar @xmath0 can also be produced in non - higgs decays .",
    "it can be produced in @xmath31 meson decays @xcite , in @xmath32 decays @xcite and other rare decays @xcite , and in associated production with chargino pair @xcite . in some other contexts ,",
    "a light pseudoscalar boson can also be frequently produced in association with a higgs boson or a heavy quark pair @xcite .",
    "there could also be other unconventional decay modes of the sm - like higgs boson in the nmssm , e.g. , invisible decay into neutralinos @xcite .",
    "a recent summary can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite .    in this note",
    "we point out another important production channel of a light pseudoscalar higgs boson @xmath0 via the decays of neutralinos , including @xmath1 , in the framework of the nmssm .",
    "this is potentially much more important than from the decay of the higgs boson or from the associated production .",
    "in particular , if the gluino and squarks are light enough for copious production of susy events at the lhc , there would be numerous number of @xmath3 in subsequent decays of gluinos and squarks .",
    "therefore , the production rates of @xmath0 via neutralino decays would be much more important than @xmath21 and others .",
    "there is also the possibility of @xmath33 followed by @xmath4 .",
    "it was argued in refs .",
    "@xcite that the mass @xmath34 in most favorable parameter space is lighter than @xmath35 , and thus @xmath36 is the most frequent . in this case ,",
    "susy events would be filled with many @xmath5 leptons plus missing energies , with the corresponding @xmath37 reconstructed at the @xmath0 mass .",
    "we scan the whole parameter space using the most up - to - date version of nmhdecay @xcite and search for regions where @xmath38 .",
    "we show characteristics of this region of parameter space .",
    "the superpotential of the nmssm is given by @xmath39 where @xmath40 , @xmath41 , @xmath42 , @xmath43 , @xmath44 , @xmath45 , @xmath46 , and @xmath47 are the doublet quark and lepton , doublet up - type higgs and down - type higgs , singlet up - quark and down - quark , and the singlet scalar superfields , respectively .",
    "the higgs sector of the nmssm consists of the usual two higgs doublets @xmath48 and @xmath49 and an extra higgs singlet @xmath11 .",
    "the extra singlet field is allowed to couple only to the higgs doublets of the model , the supersymmetrization of which is that the singlet field only couples to the higgsino doublets . consequently , the couplings of the singlet @xmath11 to gauge bosons and fermions will only be manifest via their mixing with the doublet higgs fields .",
    "after the higgs fields take on the vev s and rotating away the goldstone modes , we are left with a pair of charged higgs bosons , 3 real scalar fields , and 2 pseudoscalar fields . in particular , the mass matrix for the two pseudoscalar higgs bosons @xmath50 and @xmath51 is @xmath52 with @xmath53 where @xmath54 and @xmath55 and @xmath56 and @xmath57 . here",
    "@xmath50 is the pseudoscalar in mssm while @xmath51 comes from the singlet @xmath11 and from the effects of rotating away the goldstone modes .",
    "the pseudoscalar fields are further rotated to the diagonal basis ( @xmath58 , @xmath59 ) through a mixing angle @xcite : @xmath60 where the masses of @xmath61 are arranged such that @xmath62 . at tree - level the mixing angle is given by @xmath63 we also use @xmath0 to denote the @xmath58 .",
    "the @xmath0 is mainly the singlet when @xmath64 is small .",
    "the couplings of @xmath0 to fermions scale with @xmath65 while @xmath0 can have large couplings to higgsinos and higgs bosons via the @xmath66 term of the superpotential .",
    "we use the publicly available code , nmhdecay @xcite , to generate parameter space points .",
    "currently , the code has imposed a number of experimental constraints , including the radiative @xmath67 decay , the @xmath68 and @xmath69 mixing parameters , @xmath70 decay , @xmath71 decay , and the relic density of the lightest neutralino .",
    "these experimental constraints can be turned on or off .",
    "the parameter space points presented in this section satisfy all the above constraints . before we show the decay branching ratios of the second lightest neutralino , we would like to give the vertex factor that we are considering",
    ". the vertex factor @xmath0-@xmath72-@xmath73 is given by @xmath74 the other competing channels for @xmath75 include @xmath76 , and 3-body decays via off - shell particles .",
    "the detailed formulas will be shown in a future publication @xcite .",
    "the 3-body decays are suppressed as long as at least one of the 2-body modes are open .",
    "we show in fig .",
    "[ br1 ] the branching ratios of @xmath77 for two sets of parameter space points , with varying @xmath78 and @xmath79 respectively .",
    "it is clear that @xmath80 dominates in these two sets of points , which satisfy all experimental constraints and relic density of the lsp .",
    "the parameters @xmath78 and @xmath79 can be kept small by the approximate pq and @xmath81 symmetries , which guarantee the lightness of @xmath0 .",
    "experimentally , the decay @xmath82 gives very interesting signatures .",
    "in typical susy events , a lot of gluinos or squarks are produced , which subsequently decay into the third or second lightest neutralinos , instead of directly decaying into the lightest one .",
    "thus , there are numerous second lightest or third lightest neutralinos , which then decays into the lightest neutralino and the light pseudoscalar @xmath0 .",
    "the @xmath0 then decays into either @xmath13 or @xmath37 depending on its mass .",
    "therefore , the final state will be filled with many @xmath5 leptons , which can be carefully reconstructed at the mass of @xmath0 .",
    "this is a clean , observable , and distinguishable signature for nmssm .",
    "leptons is often the signature .",
