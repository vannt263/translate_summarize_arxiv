    "many problems in nuclear astrophysics usually require the use of numerical simulations and network calculations using weak interaction rates as input parameters @xcite .",
    "high quality nuclear input is a necessary condition for a high quality astrophysical model .",
    "thus , the models for the energy generation in stars and for nucleosynthesis may depend critically on the nuclear input used .    in particular , the rapid proton capture ( rp ) process is of special interest @xcite .",
    "it is expected to take place in explosive scenarios , such as x - ray bursts , where the necessary conditions of high densities and temperatures are met .",
    "actually , the relevance of the nuclear rp - process network lies in its importance as the dynamical engine of the observed x - ray bursts .",
    "the rp - process is characterized by the fact that the proton capture reaction rates are orders of magnitude faster than the competing @xmath1 decays . when the proton capture is inhibited , the reaction flow has to wait for a relatively slow @xmath1 decay to continue @xcite .",
    "the longer lived @xmath1 emitters are called waiting points .",
    "the half - lives of the waiting point nuclei determine the time scales of the flow .",
    "calculations of @xmath1/ec half - lives have been carried out in the past at different levels of approximation .",
    "the first large scale calculations were based on the gross theory @xcite .",
    "this is a statistical model that averages over the @xmath2-strength distributions in the daughter nucleus ignoring the intrinsic nuclear structure .",
    "more recently , many efforts have been done to calculate the weak interaction rates from microscopic calculations taking into account the nuclear structure details of the individual nuclei , see for instance @xcite . among the microscopic methods , the proton - neutron quasiparticle random phase approximation ( pnqrpa or qrpa ) is one of the most reliable and widely used microscopic approximations for calculating the correlated wave functions involved in @xmath2 decay processes .",
    "the method was first studied in ref .",
    "@xcite to describe the @xmath2 strength distributions .",
    "the inclusion of a particle - particle ( @xmath3 ) residual interaction @xcite , in addition to the particle - hole ( @xmath4 ) usual channel , and the extension of the method to deal with deformed nuclei @xcite using phenomenological potentials , were major steps to improve the method .",
    "selfconsistent methods have been also applied to the study of the decay properties of spherical neutron - rich nuclei @xcite and deformed proton - rich nuclei @xcite . in the latter work ,",
    "@xmath5-decay properties were studied on the basis of a deformed hf+bcs+qrpa calculation with density dependent effective interactions of skyrme type .",
    "this is indeed a very suitable method to study the @xmath2-decay half - lives of the exotic proton - rich waiting point nuclei involved in the rp - process , namely the @xmath6 nuclei @xmath7ge , @xmath8se , @xmath9kr , @xmath10sr , @xmath11zr , @xmath12mo , @xmath13ru , and @xmath14pd .",
    "the experimental information on half - lives existing on these nuclei is used to test the model results and to asses the predictive power of the method for network calculations of the rp - process .",
    "the deformed hf+bcs+qrpa with density - dependent skyrme forces and residual interactions consistent with the mean field is a method that has been successfully used in the description of the nuclear structure properties of nuclei within the valley of stability .",
    "the quality of the two - body effective skyrme interaction and the selfconsistent procedure will finally determine the extrapolability to unknown exotic regions .",
    "nuclear deformation is a relevant ingredient in this mass region @xcite , which is crossed by the rp - path , and should be included in a reliable calculation .",
    "the procedure determines the deformation selfconsistently , which is again a clear advantage in regions where there is no experimental information on nuclear shapes .",
    "following this method , we study in this work the half - lives of the above mentioned waiting points and their dependence on deformation and residual forces .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    ", we present a brief summary containing the basic points in our theoretical description .",
    "section 3 contains the results obtained for the ground state properties of the @xmath6 waiting point nuclei considered , as well as the half - lives and their dependence on deformation and residual forces .",
    "the conclusions are given in section 4 .",
    "in this section we summarize briefly the theoretical formalism used to describe the gamow - teller transitions . more details can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "we follow a selfconsistent hartree - fock procedure to generate microscopically the deformed mean field , which is assumed to be axially symmetric .",
    "this is done with density dependent effective interactions of skyrme type .",
    "the equilibrium deformation of the nucleus is obtained selfconsistently as the shape that minimizes the energy of the nucleus . in this work we present results obtained with the most traditional of the skyrme forces ( sk3 ) @xcite and with the force sg2 @xcite , which is known to provide a good description of the spin - isospin excitations in nuclei .",
    "the single - particle wave functions are expanded in terms of the eigenstates of an axially symmetric harmonic oscillator in cylindrical coordinates , using eleven major shells in the expansion . pairing correlations between like nucleons",
    "are included in the bcs approximation with fixed gap parameters for protons and neutrons .",
    "the gap parameters are determined phenomenologically from the odd - even mass differences .",
    "following bertsch and tsai @xcite , the particle - hole interaction consistent with the hartree - fock mean field is obtained as the second derivative of the energy density functional with respect to the one - body density .",
    "neglecting momentum dependent terms , the resulting local interaction can be written in the landau - migdal form .",
    "after functional differentiation , one can establish a relationship between the landau and the skyrme parameters .",
    "the resulting residual local force is now approximated @xcite by a separable force by averaging the local force over the nuclear volume assuming a constant density distribution inside a sphere with the nuclear radius .",
    "integrating over this volume , we arrive to a separable spin - isospin force whose coupling strength is determined by the skyrme parameters and the equilibrium radius .",
    "hence , it varies in accordance with the skyrme force used .",
    "the reliability of this procedure was discussed in refs .",
    "@xcite in the context of the spin magnetic dipole excitations , which are the @xmath15 isospin counterparts of the @xmath16 gt transitions .",
    "the conclusion was that , although less realistic , the separable interaction contains the essential features of the zero - range force @xcite . in summary ,",
    "the method is a compromise between exact consistency and manageability of the residual force , which is a separable residual interaction whose strength is consistent with the ground state mean field .",
    "this procedure can be viewed as an approximation to the more general method @xcite , where the exact @xmath4 residual interaction is first reduced to its landau - migdal form and then the rpa matrix is expanded into a finite sum of @xmath17 separable terms .",
    "one may expect that for radial independent rpa modes , which are considered here , the approximation made here gives a good average of the above mentioned expansion .",
    "the results in ref .",
    "@xcite support this view .",
    "the particle - particle part is a neutron - proton pairing force in the @xmath18 coupling channel .",
    "we introduce this interaction in terms of a separable force with a coupling strength , @xmath19 , determined by fitting the @xmath2-decay half - lives of @xmath2 emitters at their equilibrium shapes .",
    "the basic quantities needed to calculate the @xmath2-decay properties are the matrix elements connecting proton and neutron states with fermi or gamow - teller operators .",

    "we have used the initial and final states in the laboratory frame expressed in terms of the intrinsic states using the bohr - mottelson factorization @xcite .",
    "the effect of angular momentum projection is then , to a large extent , taken into account . in the deformed cases , the spurious contributions to the strengths coming from higher angular momentum components in the wave functions are of the order @xmath37 @xcite , where @xmath38 is the ground state expectation value of the angular momentum operator component perpendicular to the symmetry axis .",
    "values of @xmath38 for the deformed nuclei considered in this work are always much larger than 10 @xcite and therefore , spurious contributions are expected to represent less than @xmath39 effect .",
    "similarly , the fermi strength is obtained as    @xmath40    in @xmath41 $ ] units .",
    "the @xmath2-decay half - life is obtained by summing up all the allowed transition probabilities weighted with some phase space factors up to states in the daughter nucleus with excitation energies lying within the @xmath42-window ,    @xmath43    where @xmath44 is the fermi integral @xcite and @xmath45  s. we include standard effective factors    @xmath46 ^{2}=\\left [ 0.75\\left ( g_{a}/g_{v}\\right ) _",

    "since the experimental information on these nuclei is still very little , we compare in table 1 our results with the results from relativistic mean field calculations of ref . @xcite and with results from systematic calculations @xcite based on macroscopic - microscopic models ( finite range droplet macroscopic model and folded yukawa single particle microscopic model ) .",
    "the charge radii are quite similar but in most cases the results from sg2 are closer to the relativistic results than those calculated with sk3 .",

    "the method has also been used to analyze the recently measured @xcite gt strength distributions in @xmath63kr and @xmath10sr .",
    "the dependence on deformation of these distributions allows one to conclude that the decay pattern of @xmath10sr is compatible with a prolate shape while that of @xmath63kr requires an admixture of oblate and prolate shapes .",
    "0.5 cm    once the reliability of the method has been contrasted , we proceed now with the calculation of the half - lives in the waiting point nuclei .",
    "2 shows the dependence of @xmath64 on the strength of the @xmath3 residual interaction , using the skyrme force sg2 .",
    "as we have mentioned , the @xmath4 strength is fixed by the skyrme force in a consistent way but the @xmath3 strength remains undetermined .",

    "there is a competition between the global reduction of the gt strength and the accumulation of extra strength at lower energies .",
    "the latter effect becomes dominant and the half - lives are suppressed as we increase @xmath19 .",
    "the experimental half - life is reproduced in almost all cases with values of @xmath19 around 0.07 and therefore this is the value postulated to be used in those cases where the half - lives have not been measured yet .    in fig.3",
    "we study the sensitivity of @xmath64 to deformation .",
    "we use the force sg2 and @xmath65 mev .",
    "we can see how the hf+bcs half - lives are systematically lower than the qrpa and experiment , sometimes even by one order of magnitude .",
    "qrpa correlations reduce the mean field gt strength and as a result the half - lives increase accordingly .",
    "deformation can also change the half - lives by factors up to four .",
    "what is remarkable is that the experimental half - lives are systematically better reproduced for the selfconsistent deformations that minimize the energy , as can be seen by comparing fig .",
    "3 with the sg2 minima in fig .",
    "the same feature is found with the sk3 force .",
    "this shows to what extent selfconsistency plays an important role in the calculation of the half - lives . in this respect , it is interesting to note that with the sg2 force , the experimental value of @xmath64 for @xmath11zr is reproduced at the sg2 equilibrium deformation ( @xmath66 ) , but not at the experimental deformation ( @xmath67 ) that corresponds to a higher local minimum .",
    "0.5 cm    0.5 cm    finally in fig .",
    "4 we show the results for the half - lives obtained from our approach in the even - even @xmath6 waiting points from a=64 up to a=92 .",
    "the results correspond to the forces sk3 and sg2 with the deformations and coupling strengths residual forces discussed above .",
    "again , the hf+bcs results appear systematically below the qrpa results and below the experiment .",
    "the qrpa results from both forces agree nicely with experiment .",
    "we get also in general agreement with the qrpa results obtained from a different formalism based on yukawa potentials @xcite .",
    "using a deformed qrpa formalism , based on a selfconsistent quasiparticle mean field , which includes @xmath4 and @xmath3 separable residual interactions , we have studied the @xmath2-decay properties of several @xmath6 waiting point nuclei involved in the astrophysical rp - process .",
    "we have analyzed the half - lives as a function of deformation and residual interactions and have found that best agreement with the laboratory experimental half - lives is obtained using : a ) the selfconsistent deformations obtained from the minimization of the energy , and b ) residual interactions with a consistently derived @xmath4 strength and @xmath68 mev .",
