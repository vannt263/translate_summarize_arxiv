    "of the various families of iron pnictide superconductors , the so - called 122 family has been extensively studied due to their high t@xmath6 s and the ability to grow relatively large single crystals , which includes bafe@xmath3as@xmath3 , srfe@xmath3as@xmath3 and cafe@xmath3as@xmath3 . unlike the case of the cuprates , superconductivity in these materials is apparently quite robust against in - plane disorder , brought about by electron - doping for fe atoms either by co , ni or other transition metals .",
    "the transition temperatures remain fairly high for these substitutions , with t@xmath6 = 22k for ba(fe@xmath7co@xmath8)@xmath3as@xmath3  @xcite , 20.5k for ba(fe@xmath9ni@xmath10)@xmath3as@xmath3  @xcite , 23k for ba(fe@xmath11pt@xmath12)@xmath3as@xmath3  @xcite , 14k for ba(fe@xmath13rh@xmath14)@xmath3as@xmath3  @xcite , 19.5k for sr(fe@xmath15co@xmath16)@xmath3as@xmath3  @xcite , 9.5k for sr(fe@xmath17ni@xmath18)@xmath3as@xmath3  @xcite and 12k for ca(fe@xmath19co@xmath20)@xmath3as@xmath3  @xcite .    like the cuprate superconductors , these materials exist in close proximity to magnetism . however , the nature of the competition or coexistence of magnetism and superconductivity in the pnictides has been debated , particularly since there may be different behaviours in different families  @xcite .",
    "this continues with the nature of the gap symmetry which also may vary across different families  @xcite and where the temperature - dependence of the superfluid density raises the possibility of multi - band superconductivity  @xcite .",
    "muon spin rotation ( @xmath0sr ) is a powerful local microscopic tool for characterizing the magnetic properties of materials in superconducting or other states .",
    "a thorough description of the application of @xmath0sr to studies of superconductivity can be found elsewhere  @xcite .",
    "each implanted muon spin precesses around the local magnetic field until the muon decays into a positron , which is preferentially ejected along the direction of the muon spin at the time of decay ( as well as two neutrinos which are not detected ) . due to the large gyromagnetic ratio of the muon , local fields as small as 0.1 g can be detected .",
    "single crystals of ba(fe@xmath1co@xmath21as@xmath3 with x=0.038 and 0.047 were grown at ames from self flux as described in detail elsewhere  @xcite .",
    "the crystals , each of roughly 1@xmath22 area , were mounted in a helium gas flow cryostat on the m15 and m20 surface muon beamlines at triumf , using a low background arrangement such that only positrons originating from muons landing in the specimens were collected in the experimental spectra .",
    "using zero field ( zf)-@xmath0sr , magnetic fields at the muon site can be measured through precession of the muon spins in the local field .",
    "the presence of magnetic order in the samples is manifested as an oscillation in the zf-@xmath0sr spectra , as was the case in the samples measured here .",
    "characteristic spectra for the samples with x=0.038 , 0.047 and the parent material , bafe@xmath3as@xmath3 , at t=1.65k are shown in fig .",
    "[ rawdata ] , with the spectra vertically offset for clarity . here and elsewhere in this work ,",
    "the data for the parent compound was originally reported in ref .",
    "motivated by previous studies of the underdoped and parent compounds in which two muon sites have been observed @xcite , as well as dft calculations supporting two electrostatic minima in the crystal structure  @xcite , the zf-@xmath0sr data was fit to a fitting function : @xmath23    this is a model containing two precessing muon signals and a relaxing , non - precessing signal . furthermore , a single damped exponential did not fit the data well . in fig .",
    "[ rawdata ] , we can see the clear precession indicative of well - ordered magnetism that is present in the parent material is not long - lived in the doped samples .",
    "the highly damped precession indicates a broad distribution of local fields at the muon sites , indicating a substantial degree of disorder in the magnetic ordering .",
    "( color online ) the zero - field ( zf)-@xmath0sr spectra taken at t=1.65k for the parent ( x=0 , blue ) , x=0.038 ( red ) and x=0.047 ( black ) samples .",
    "the x=0.038 data is vertically offset by + 0.15 and the x=0 data is vertically offset by + 0.3 for clarity .",
    "the solid lines are the fits to the data , as described in the text . here",
    ", we see clear precession in the parent material , but the precession in the doped compounds is strongly damped , indicating significantly disordered magnetism . ]",
    "the precession frequencies , @xmath24 and @xmath25 , extracted from this model are shown as a function of temperature in fig .",
    "[ zf_frq ] .",
    "the onset of the magnetic ordering was estimated to be 71(3)k for ba(fe@xmath26co@xmath27)as@xmath3 and 45(2)k for ba(fe@xmath28co@xmath29)as@xmath3 , in excellent agreement with transport and scattering measurements  @xcite .    in these measurements",
    ", we find that the magnitudes of the two frequencies scale with one another , which is evidence for two inequivalent muon sites with different local fields . this scaling would not be expected in the case of muons landing in different regions of the sample with distinct environments , such as multiphase samples .",
    "the scaling dependence was found during the initial analysis and so the frequencies and asymmetries of the two signals were constrained to be a constant multiple of one another .",
    "these ratios were fit to a temperature - independent value using the whole temperature range below t@xmath30 .",
    "the frequency ratio was found to decrease with doping , being @xmath31 for the parent material , @xmath32 at 3.8% co doping and @xmath33 at 4.7% .",
    "the decrease in the ratio may reflect the growing co concentration , which distorts the magnetically - ordered lattice and the electrostatic potential at the muon site  @xcite . at the 4.7% doping",
    ", the extremely small value of the ratio of high- and low - field sites may represent the nearly complete loss of long - range order , so that all sites appear to have different local fields , consistent with the data from fig .",
    "[ rawdata ] , where the oscillations disappear within the first 0.1 - 0.2@xmath0s .",
    "the frequencies observed in our measurements are lowest in the 4.7% sample , while both are lower than for the parent compound@xcite .",
    "this indicates that the average magnetic field at both muon sites decreases with increasing doping .",
    "this could be due to the replacement of fe moments with co atoms , which reduces the size of the internal field .",
    "the replacement of fe moments with co atoms may also cause disorder in the local field , leading to a high muon relaxation rate in the zf-@xmath0sr measurements . as seen in fig .",
    "[ rawdata ] , the relaxation rates of the oscillating components are highest in the 4.7% sample and slightly lower in the 3.8% sample , while the oscillations in the parent material persist to much longer times .",
    "this is in agreement with other work on the underdoped ba(fe@xmath1co@xmath2)@xmath3as@xmath3 compounds , where the precession signals observed are fairly short - lived , indicating that the magnetic ordering in these samples are most likely strongly disordered or incommensurate@xcite .",
    "incommensurate magnetic order has been observed by neutron scattering in dopings above @xmath4=0.056  @xcite .",
    "( color online ) ( a ) zf-@xmath0sr spectra for ba(fe@xmath1co@xmath2)@xmath3as@xmath3 with x=0.038 ( t@xmath34=71k and t@xmath6=8k ) and x=0.047 ( t@xmath34=45k and t@xmath6=15k ) .",
    "there is a clear onset at t@xmath34 , where the precession frequency becomes non - zero .",
    "there is no significant change below t@xmath6 . ]",
    "when zf-@xmath0sr spectra are measured with the initial muon polarization in the direction of the local field , @xmath35 , the spectra do not relax to zero asymmetry in the ordered region .",
    "this behaviour was observed when the direction of the initial muon spin was parallel to the crystallographic @xmath5 direction .",
    "this was verified by measuring zf-@xmath0sr spectra in an orientation in which the muon spin is perpendicular to the @xmath5-axis , @xmath36 , where the spectra do relax to zero at long times .",
    "the fits of the zf-@xmath0sr spectra give internal fields at the high - field muon site to be approximately 0.13 t in x=0.038 and 0.11 t in x=0.047 .",
    "this is consistent with other studies of ba(fe@xmath1co@xmath2)@xmath3as@xmath3 that have found strong internal fields ( @xmath370.15 t ) along the @xmath5-axis in various dopings , from the parent compound up to the loss of magnetic order@xcite .",
    "we also measured these samples in a transverse field ( tf ) of 4mt to probe the paramagnetic volume fraction . in a weakly magnetic or paramagnetic region",
    "the muon ensemble sees a local field equal to the applied field , @xmath38 , so it can be fit to a simple exponentially - damped cosine :    @xmath39    where @xmath40 .    below a magnetic ordering transition , the local field becomes a vector sum of the ordered and external fields , so the muons no longer precess at the frequency given by the external field .",
    "the amplitude of the measured signal , @xmath41 , of the precessing signal decreases , though any para- or weakly - magnetic region will still precess at this frequency .",
    "this allows tf-@xmath0sr to be used for measurements of the magnetic volume fractions in magnetically - ordered materials . in these samples , we find that the volume fraction of the magnetically - ordered region increases sharply below t@xmath34 ( as shown in fig  [ wtf_frq_rlx](c ) ) , saturating within 15k of the ordering temperature .",
    "we see that in the 4.7% sample , there is a residual signal that still precesses down to the lowest temperatures measured , but has a relaxation that increases below t@xmath34 indicating that it is weakly magnetic . this low - field region is less than 10% in the x=0.038 sample , while it is approximately 40% for x=0.047 .",
    "this is an indication that the fraction of the sample that sees weak magnetism increases with increasing co concentration .",
    "( color online ) tf-@xmath0sr measurements of x=0.038 and 0.047 in tf=4mt .",
    "( a ) the frequency shows a drop below the magnetic ordering temperature , but slowly increases again towards t=0 .",
    "this may be indicative of field - induced ordering .",
    "( b ) the relaxation rate increases sharply below t@xmath30 , saturating well before t=0 .",
    "this indicates that the local field is fairly inhomogeneous in these samples , which causes dephasing of the muon spin polarization in the ordered part of the phase diagram .",
    "( c ) we see a 100% paramagnetic signal above t@xmath34 , which drops sharply at the transition . below the ordering temperature , there is a residual paramagnetic signal , about 40% for x=0.047 and less than 10% for x=0.038 . due to the small residually - precessing volume fraction present in the 3.8% sample",
    ", the points below 50k are omitted from ( a ) and ( b ) . ]",
    "[ wtf_frq_rlx](a ) and ( b ) show the precession frequencies , @xmath42 , and relaxation rates , @xmath43 , present in the tf-@xmath0sr spectra .",
    "the relaxation rate measures the rate of the depolarization of the muon spins , which may be caused by inhomogeneities in the local magnetic field among other factors .",
    "we see in fig .",
    "[ wtf_frq_rlx](a ) that the frequency shows a decrease below the magnetic ordering transition .",
    "this can be attributed to the antiferromagnetic order that emerges and causes inhomogeneities in the local field ; this is significant evidence for disordered magnetism at these dopings .",
    "this inhomogeneity in the local field is also seen in the tf-@xmath0sr relaxation rates ( fig .",
    "[ wtf_frq_rlx](b ) ) that show a sharp increase at the magnetic ordering transition .",
    "the relaxation rates saturate , and remain relatively constant down to @xmath44 . when this is taken together with the zf and with the tf-@xmath0sr spectra in different orientations , we find a magnetic structure that displays a large internal field oriented along the @xmath5-axis .",
    "as was seen with @xmath0sr measurements of the parent material@xcite , these samples see magnetism everywhere , but in the doped samples the magnetism is highly disordered .",
    "this is in agreement with nmr@xcite and mssbauer@xcite measurements that find disordered , possible incommensurate magnetic order in the underdoped ba(fe@xmath1co@xmath2)@xmath3as@xmath3 compounds .",
    "this is somewhat in contrast to neutron scattering measurements that see well - defined magnetic scattering , which continues to be sharp below t@xmath6@xcite .",
    "neutron scattering also sees incommensurate magnetic order at higher dopings , for x=0.056 to x=0.060@xcite .",
    "this incommensuration depends on composition , though the magnetic bragg peaks remain well - defined .",
    "the fact that neutron scattering sees a well - ordered magnetic structure may be due to fluctuations in the local magnetism on timescales slower than that detectable by neutron scattering , but observable by @xmath0sr .",
    "this is in agreement with other techniques that operate on similar timescales , such as mssbauer ( @xmath45s ) and nmr ( @xmath46s ) .",
    "incommensuration has been observed at dopings near the loss of antiferromagnetic order with a very small splitting  @xcite . in lower doped samples , such as those in this study",
    ", it is possible that the incommensuration is too small to be observed by neutron scattering but results in disorder in the local field , consistent with what has been observed in the ni - doped system  @xcite .",
    "another possible explanation is that the magnetic moments are a superposition of an ordered and a disordered component .",
    "while neutron scattering is sensitive only to the ordered component , muons would see both components , resulting in a largely disordered local field .",
    "this is consistent with neutron measurements of ca(fe , co)@xmath3as@xmath3 , which find a decrease in the size of the fe ordered moment with increasing co - doping  @xcite . in the latter two cases , the disorder would increase with increasing co - doping , as is seen in both zf- and tf-@xmath0sr relaxation rates .    below the superconducting transition ,",
    "we see only small changes in the tf-@xmath0sr parameters .",
    "we see a slight decrease in the relaxation rate in the 4.7% sample below t@xmath6=15k , while we do not have enough data points around and below t@xmath6=8k in the 3.8% sample to see any changes in behaviour . by using a higher transverse field of 0.02 t",
    ", we find more direct evidence of superconductivity .",
    "this was measured at t=1.65k for both field - cooled ( fc ) and zero field - cooled ( zfc ) orientations .",
    "compared to the fc data , the zfc spectrum displayed a strong increase in the relaxation , indicative of flux pinning , clearly indicating that we have superconductivity in these samples .",
    "superconductivity may exist in the low - field regions since this region exhibits a growing volume fraction with increasing doping and by x=0.061 there is no static magnetism present@xcite .",
    "the entire sample displays magnetism but some regions have small local fields , so there may be phase separation on the nanoscale with superconductivity existing in or near the magnetic regions of the sample .",
    "this is in agreement with scanning tunnelling spectroscopy ( sts ) results , that see no phase separation on length scales larger than tens of nanometers@xcite .",
    "we have measured single crystals of ba(fe@xmath1co@xmath2)@xmath3as@xmath3 that show both magnetism and superconductivity using zero - field and transverse - field muon spin relaxation / rotation .",
    "these measurements demonstrate the clear onset of a local magnetic field below t@xmath30 , largely along the @xmath5-axis , the magnitude of which decreases with increasing co doping .",
    "tf-@xmath0sr measurements suggest some inhomogeneity in the local field , where the disorder is greater in the 4.7% doping as evidenced by the lower precession frequency in the tf-@xmath0sr signal at low t and a higher relaxation in the zf-@xmath0sr spectra . there is a residual volume fraction that displays low - field magnetism , which increases with co doping from less than 10% in bafe(@xmath26co@xmath27)@xmath3as@xmath3 to 40% in bafe(@xmath28co@xmath29)@xmath3as@xmath3",
    ". a possible source of this disorder may be the loss of fe moments , which results in lower internal fields in the higher doped sample .",
    "these measurements are consistent with other techniques that suggest an incommensuration of the magnetic order that increases with co - doping .",
    "this is reflected in the zf-@xmath0sr measurements , that show reduced precession frequencies and increased relaxation rates at higher dopings , suggesting lower internal fields and increased magnetic disorder .    measurements in a larger transverse field of 0.02 t display flux pinning and superconductivity , which may display nanoscale phase separation existing in the low - field regions of the sample",
    ". however , there is no detectable change in the local magnetic field or magnetic volume fractions below t@xmath6 .",
    "this suggests that the entire sample sees some magnetic order , indicating that the superconductivity exists in or near regions of large local magnetic order .",
