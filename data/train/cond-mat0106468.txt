    "the present paper reviews properties of a three - dimensional weakly diluted quenched ising model ( random ising model : rim  see figure [ figlattice ] ) in the vicinity of critical point . for weak dilution by a non - magnetic component ,",
    "i.e. far from the percolation threshold , the magnetic second - order phase transition still maintains in the rim @xcite although it possesses novel features in comparison with the pure @xmath0 ising model .",
    "static critical exponents of a rim @xcite have been a subject of a detailed experimental , numerical and theoretical analysis almost for three decades .",
    "recently , new data were obtained both in experimental measurements @xcite and monte carlo simulations .",
    "theoretical breakthrough occurred along several months in 19992000 when the perturbation expansion series for rim were extended from the 4th @xcite through 5th @xcite to the sixth order @xcite .",
    "therefore it seems for us worth collecting together the bulk of available results concerning critical behaviour of the rim .    in the present discussion , we will be mainly interested in the rim critical exponents .",
    "an _ asymptotic critical exponent _",
    "@xmath1 of a physical observable @xmath2 is defined @xcite asymptotically close to the critical point @xmath3 : @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the reduced distance to the critical point . for instance",
    ", the magnetic susceptibility @xmath6 diverges as : @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the susceptibility critical exponent , while @xmath9 and @xmath10 are critical amplitudes above and below the critical point respectively .",
    "the power law of type ( [ 1 ] ) holds exactly in the asymptotic regime @xmath11 . in this regime",
    "the critical exponents and ratios of the critical amplitudes take constant values .",
    "according to the universality hypothesis they are defined by global variables only . for a short - range interaction",
    "the global variables are the space dimension and tensor characteristics of an order parameter . in the non - asymptotic regime",
    "the approach to criticality is described by non - universal _ effective critical exponents _ , which are introduced to describe the behaviour of a quantity in a certain temperature interval @xcite .",
    "the susceptibility effective critical exponent @xmath12 by definition reads : @xmath13 in the asymptotic limit @xmath14 the effective and asymptotic exponents coincide . in the intermediate region",
    "the behaviour is characterized by the so  called wegner expansion @xcite : @xmath15 where @xmath16 are non  universal amplitudes , @xmath17 is the correlation length critical exponent , and @xmath18 is the correction  to  scaling exponent .",
    "it is the art of a physicist which allows to discriminate between regimes ( [ 1])([3 ] ) either performing experimental measurements or doing theoretical calculations and numerical simulations .",
    "below we will review available data on effective and asymptotic critical exponents of the rim .",
    "the paper is arranged as follows . in the next section [ ii ]",
    "we will give general considerations about an influence of a weak quenched disorder on a second order phase transition , formulate the model as well as outline the main features of its critical behaviour .",
    "in section [ iii ] we review experiments on weakly diluted uniaxial magnets , whereas computer monte carlo simulations of a rim are analyzed in section [ iv ] . in sections",
    "[ v ] and [ vi ] we outline the method of renormalization group as the most fruitful theoretical tool in the study of the critical properties of rim .",
    "we consider different renormalization schemes and pay special attention to analysis of divergent series obtained within the approach .",
    "conclusions ( section [ vii ] ) complete the article .",
    "the central questions one has to answer studying the influence of weak disorder on a magnetic second - order phase transitions are : do the critical exponents of a homogeneous magnet change under dilution by a non - magnetic component ? and if this is the case , are the new exponents universal ? regarding the first question it was argued @xcite that if the heat capacity critical exponent @xmath19 of the pure ( undiluted ) system is positive , i.e. the heat capacity diverges at the critical point , then a quenched disorder causes changes in the critical exponents .",
    "this statement is known as harris criterion .",
    "later , for a large class of @xmath20dimensional disordered systems it was proven that the correlation length critical exponent @xmath17 must satisfy the bound @xmath21 @xcite .",
    "both statements focus attention towards studies of the @xmath0 ising model , where the typical numerical values of the above exponents , together with the magnetic susceptibility and the order parameter critical exponents in the pure case read @xcite : @xmath22 according the inequalities of the criteria mentioned above for the case of the diluted ising model new exponents are expected .    in order to obtain precise values of critical exponents it is standard now to rely on renormalization group methods . in particular , the theoretical estimates given above ( [ 4 ] ) were obtained on the basis of a deep analogy between long - distance properties of the ising model in the neighbourhood of a second - order phase transition point and a field theory with an effective landau - ginzburg - wilson hamiltonian of the form : @xmath23 + { \\tilde u_0\\over 4 ! } \\varphi^4\\big\\},\\ ] ] where @xmath24 is a bare mass proportional to distance to a critical point , @xmath25 , @xmath26 are ( bare ) scalar field and coupling .",
    "one of the ways to introduce quenched dilution to the effective hamiltonian ( [ 5 ] ) is to add to @xmath24 the random - temperature like variable @xcite @xmath27 : @xmath28 + { \\tilde u_0\\over 4 ! } \\varphi^4\\big\\}.\\ ] ] taking that @xmath29 obeys gaussian distribution : @xmath30 with @xmath31 being a half of dispersion , and introducing @xmath32 replicas @xcite of a model ( [ 5 ] ) in order to perform averaging over quenched disorder @xcite one ends up @xcite with a familiar effective hamiltonian : @xmath33 + { u_{0}\\over 4 ! } \\sum_{\\alpha=1}^{n}{\\varphi}_\\alpha^4 + { v_{0}\\over 4 ! } \\left(\\sum_{\\alpha=1}^{n}{\\varphi}_\\alpha^2 \\right)^2 \\big\\}.\\ ] ] in the limit @xmath34 field theory ( [ 8 ] ) describes critical properties of a rim . here",
    ", the bare coupling @xmath35 is positive ( being proportional to @xmath26 ) whereas the bare coupling @xmath36 is proportional to minus variance of the random variable @xmath29 and thus is negative . the last term in ( [ 8 ] )",
    "is present only for non - zero dilution : it is directly responsible for the fluctuations effective interaction due to the presence of impurities .",
    "often ( e.g. in monte carlo simulations ) the microscopic hamiltonian of rim is written in the following form : @xmath37 where @xmath38 runs over sites of simple cubic lattice , @xmath39 is a short  range translationally invariant interaction between pairs of @xmath40 `` classical '' ising spins , @xmath41 is an occupation number equal either to 0 or to 1 .",
    "it is considered that geometrically the vacancies @xmath42 are distributed independently according to the law @xmath43 and fixed in different sites of the lattice ( see figure [ figlattice ] ) . in ( [",
    "10 ] ) @xmath44 is the concentration of occupied sites . calculating free energy of a model ( [ 9 ] ) and using replica trick @xcite to perform the configurational averaging of the logarithm of configuration - dependent partition function it is straightforward to show that one ends up with the effective hamiltonian of ( [ 8 ] ) type in the @xmath45 replica limit with @xmath46 and @xmath47 .",
    "from the viewpoint of dynamics one can point to two opposite types of a disorder @xcite .",
    "if a characteristic time of impurities dynamics is comparable to relaxation times in the pure system , impurity variables are treated identically to the `` pure '' dynamical variables and are a part of the disordered system phase space .",
    "the corresponding annealed disorder @xcite is a subject of special investigations and reveals trivial results at criticality .",
    "the so called fisher renormalization @xcite states that when a heat capacity critical exponent of an undiluted system @xmath48 is positive , then the critical exponents @xmath1 of an annealed system are determined by those of the corresponding pure one ( @xmath49 ) by a simple renormalization of the form : @xmath50 this explains why prevailing interest is attracted by the quenched disorder when impurities can be considered as fixed and thus one needs to perform configurational average over an ensemble of disordered systems with different realization of the disorder .",
    "the hamiltonian ( [ 8 ] ) represents critical properties of the problem ( [ 9 ] ) for small randomness .",
    "alternatively , the scale - invariant fractal ramified cluster at the percolation threshold is a starting point of the strong disorder approach . here",
    ", the field theoretical description starts with the effective hamiltonian of the potts model .",
    "a unified theory of random systems critical behaviour which would give both regimes of strong disorder and weak disorder as its limiting cases is still absent .",
    "the translation invariant hamiltonian ( [ 8 ] ) presumes perturbative account of thermal fluctuations around a spatially homogeneous unique ground state .",
    "while it appears to hold for a pure system , for a random system there is a macroscopic number of spatially inhomogeneous ground states in a disorder dominated region .",
    "these correspond to local minimum solutions of a saddle - point equation for the effective hamiltonian ( [ 8 ] ) @xcite .",
    "physically the last corresponds to the so ",
    "called griffiths phase @xcite caused by the existence of ferromagnetically ordered `` islands '' in the temperature interval between the critical temperatures of pure and random systems .",
    "the description of the phase at the critical point is provided by a replica ",
    "symmetry breaking hamiltonian @xcite leading to non - trivial results @xcite .",
    "however recently a refined analysis of the problem brought about a stability of the critical behaviour of the weakly disordered systems with respect to replica symmetry breaking effects @xcite .",
    "the theoretical results reviewed in the present discussion will be based on the replica symmetrical hamiltonian ( [ 8 ] ) ( see section [ v ] ) .",
    "the effective hamiltonians ( [ 6 ] ) and ( [ 8 ] ) possess different global variables : although the space dimension is the same ( @xmath0 ) the symmetry and order parameter components number differ .",
    "thus one may expect that by application of renormalization group approach they will lead to different critical behaviour .",
    "one of the central notions in the renormalization group formalism applied to the critical phenomena is the notion of the fixed point of the renormalization group transformation .",
    "if a fixed point exists and it can be reached from the initial values of the couplings it corresponds to a critical point of the system . applying the renormalization group transformation to the effective hamiltonian ( [ 6 ] ) and starting from positive values of @xmath51",
    "one reaches the stable fixed point @xmath52 which corresponds to the critical point of a @xmath0 pure ising model and leads in particular to the results ( [ 4 ] ) . the fixed point structure for the effective hamiltonian ( [ 8 ] )",
    "is sketched in figure [ figfp ] .",
    "the earliest qualitative results about the structure of rim fixed points appeared in mid - seventies @xcite .",
    "later analysis supported this picture @xcite : indeed the fixed point * i * of the @xmath0 pure ising model appears to be unstable and a new stable fixed point * r * exists ( see figure [ figfp ] ) .",
    "thus the general answer of the renormalization group analysis of the rim supports non - perturbative results of refs @xcite : rim critical behaviour is governed by critical exponents different from those of the pure ising model .    in the subsequent chapters we will have a look",
    "how this statement was made clear in experimental , monte carlo and theoretical studies .",
    "the ising model is represented in experiments on magnets by crystalline difluoride of a transition metal , normally iron or manganese . in @xmath53 which possesses a rutile crystalline structure with @xmath54 and @xmath55 at room temperature @xcite ,",
    "the spins of metal ions align along @xmath56 axis in such a way that spins of the body - centered ions are oriented in opposite directions to those of the corner ions .",
    "the system can be well described by a heisenberg  like spin @xmath57 hamiltonian with quadratic anisotropic single ion terms and other interactions less than @xmath58 of interspin exchange force constant @xmath59 mev , as follows from the spin - wave dispersion relations on the basis of neutron scattering measurements @xcite .",
    "dominant intersublattice exchange interaction and high anisotropy makes @xmath53 a very good experimental realization of an ising antiferromagnet , where the order parameter is the sublattice magnetization .",
    "experimental studies confirm pure ising model critical behaviour for the reduced temperature range @xmath60 ( @xmath61 ) around nel temperature @xmath62 .",
    "another example is @xmath63 with similar crystalline structure but much weaker single ion anisotropy than @xmath53 , however the experimental study showed the substance to belong to the ising universality class @xcite as well .",
    "a material which corresponds to rim can be obtained as a crystalline mixture of two compounds on the basis of `` pure '' ising model matrix ( see table [ table_experiment ] ) .",
    "a corresponding site - diluted uniaxial alloy can be prepared by substitution of @xmath53 ( @xmath63 ) with non - magnetic isomorph @xmath64 .",
    "experiments on the critical behaviour of random systems are extremely sensitive to the sample quality .",
    "asymptotic critical behaviour is observable only very close to @xmath62 and macroscopic non - statistical gradients in concentration cause variation of @xmath62 through the sample smearing out the sharp transition . therefore , to provide a satisfactory good realization of random substitutional disorder of magnetic ions ( @xmath65 , @xmath66 ) by non - magnetic ones ( @xmath67 ) , mixed crystals @xmath68 as well as @xmath69 should be grown with very high crystalline accuracy of the mosaic pattern , chemical homogeneity and especially with small impurity concentration gradients .",
    "the last can be achieved by choosing a concentration of impurities such that @xcite @xmath70 or by a geometry which takes into account that usually gradients are parallel to the growth axis .",
    "early experimental studies on the disordered crystals critical behaviour @xcite proved the crucial role of a sample quality and high quality samples allowed to observe sharp phase transition and to measure the dependence of nel temperature @xmath62 on @xmath71 via linear birefringence method @xcite .",
    "this provided a basis for universal critical properties measurements .",
    "the earliest experimental study of the critical exponents governing the sharp transition at a weak quenched dilution was the nuclear magnetic resonance measurement of magnetization in @xmath72 @xcite .",
    "the value of magnetization exponent @xmath73 was found to differ strongly from that in non - diluted sample ( see table [ table_experiment ] for details ) .    in a few years",
    "the study of ref .",
    "@xcite was corroborated by nuclear scattering ( ns ) measurements in a two - axis spectrometer configuration @xcite of the staggered susceptibility and the correlation length in a crystal on the iron basis with concentration @xmath74 in the high dilution regime . in the experiment",
    "the smearing effect was eliminated by masking the crystal to expose only a small homogeneous region , while the relative temperature control to about @xmath75 together with the substance nel temperature @xmath76 gave the accuracy @xmath77 with the same critical exponents ( see table [ table_experiment ] ) below and above @xmath3 and differing strongly from those of the pure ising model . to support the result by alternative",
    "experimental methods caloric properties were measured .",
    "utilizing the fact that for transition  metal difluorides the temperature derivative of the linear birefringence is proportional to the magnetic specific heat within @xcite @xmath78 , measurements of the critical exponent @xmath19 were performed for a sample @xmath79 with @xmath80 . in order to minimize the effect of concentration gradients the laser beam was oriented perpendicularly to the concentration gradient .",
    "the numerical value of the critical exponent was extracted by fitting the data to the temperature integral of specific heat scaling function taking into account correction - to - scaling terms ( i.e. the first two terms in the expansion ( [ 3 ] ) ) .",
    "in contrast to the pure ising case , the data obtained yielded @xmath81 ( see table [ table_experiment ] ) . within no region in reduced temperature @xmath82",
    "any evidence of pure ising behaviour or a crossover from pure to random fixed point critical behaviour was found .",
    "so one concluded that the crossover is either outside the critical region or it is too slow .",
    "the data obtained in ref .",
    "@xcite on the basis of two different substances and quite different experimental procedures proofed that the scaling relation @xmath83 holds for them and thus supported strongly scaling in dilute systems .    with a typical energy of the neutron beam about @xmath84 mev",
    ", the ns measurements appeared to be one of the most useful method to study criticality , however they turned out to be in particular very sensitive to the sample quality since typical sample sizes are less than several millimeters .",
    "the ns measurements contain contributions from transverse and longitudinal spin fluctuations , which have to be separated in a detailed data analysis .",
    "this explains why in the neutron scattering measurements of the ref .",
    "@xcite which were performed on @xmath68 with concentration @xmath85 on the similar device , special attention was paid to the quality of a sample . in the study",
    "a variation @xmath86 in concentration over the entire volume was achieved which permitted scattering studies up to @xmath87 . within the interval",
    "@xmath88 the inverse correlation length was obtained from the width of the lorentzian fits as a function of temperature , and the correlation length exponent was extracted from the power - law fits .",
    "the fit to the power ansats for @xmath6 with background term yielded @xmath8 after extrapolation to the wave vector length @xmath89 ( see table [ table_experiment ] ) . an alternative substance with the base mn ( @xmath90 )",
    "was studied by neutron scattering experiments a year later @xcite .",
    "the sample with @xmath91 had overall spread in concentration @xmath92 and allowed to perform measurements up to @xmath93 ( see figure [ figmitchell1 ] ) , while the @xmath74 sample was of lower quality with a spread in concentration of @xmath94 .",
    "quite high quality of the samples as well as the temperature control up to @xmath95 k allowed to obtain critical amplitudes ratios and exponents with good accuracy . however , systematic errors , which were assumed to be due to the resolution corrections , the quasi - elastic approximation , concentration fluctuations and background effects , appeared to be of more importance than statistical ones .",
    "the authors stressed that since no correction - to - scaling terms were used , the exponents found are effective ones . however the @xmath91 sample was shown to exhibit rim critical behaviour over the reduced temperature interval @xmath96 , whereas the critical exponents at higher dilution @xmath74 had not reached their asymptotic rim values ( see table [ table_experiment ] and figure [ figmitchell2 ] ) .",
    "the results mentioned above for the single crystal of transition metal fluorides were corroborated @xcite by neutron scattering technique for a sample of dysprosium aluminum garnet @xmath97 powder .",
    "a powder was prepared of this cubic non - collinear ising antiferromagnet together with non - magnetic yttrium to avoid gradients in composition which unavoidably occur .",
    "the critical exponent @xmath73 increased in disordered sample in comparison to the value of the `` pure '' ising model ( see table [ table_experiment ] ) and provided an extra evidence of the mapping between experiment and theoretical insight .",
    "it is known that static critical behaviour of the diluted ising magnet in a uniform field @xmath98 along the uniaxial direction behaves according to the random - field ising model @xcite .",
    "the random - field ising model is the subject of intensive recent experimental studies ( see @xcite for a review ) .",
    "two studies on the ns measurements in rim appeared in the middle of 90th in the context of random - field model investigations @xcite . in",
    "the ns studies the problem of the bragg scattering saturation due to extinction effects was reduced by growing a @xmath99 @xmath100 epitaxial film of @xmath101 on a @xmath102 @xmath103 substrate .",
    "the small @xmath104-ray rocking curve line - width of the @xmath105 reflection showed the film to be of very high quality which was in part due to the nearly identical @xmath106-axis lattice parameters of the substrate and substance .",
    "nevertheless , the film contained @xmath107 lattice spacings and could be considered as a three - dimensional object as was proven in @xmath53 showing the critical behaviour of the `` pure '' @xmath0 ising magnet @xcite .",
    "the transverse @xmath108 bragg scattering scans data appeared to be well described by a gaussian distribution with a background term .",
    "fitting the bragg amplitude vs temperature to the simple power law a critical exponent @xmath109 was found for @xmath110 , however , a rounding of the expected critical behaviour of the magnetization close to @xmath62 prevented an accurate analysis of the data .",
    "to reveal whether this was caused by poor sample quality the measurements on the @xmath99 @xmath100 film of @xmath111 were performed @xcite .",
    "the higher resolution data confirmed the value of @xmath73 obtained and showed that rounding was only due to resolution .",
    "recently in a thin crystal of @xmath112 mm the scattering measurements were extended from @xmath113 to @xmath114 to obtain the correlation length and susceptibility critical exponents @xcite .",
    "the msbauer spectroscopy ( ms ) studies of the critical behaviour started in 1986 on a class of @xmath115-based substances with various magnetic atom concentrations @xcite .",
    "the method was tested earlier for the `` pure '' ising antiferromagnet @xmath53 , where the sublattice magnetization was shown to be proportional to the iron hyperfine field @xmath116 which can be measured in ms @xcite . to apply the approach to a dilute magnet ,",
    "the variation of the concentration of @xmath117 was reduced to @xmath118 and a temperature stability of @xmath119 k was achieved . in order to fix the critical temperature the values of @xmath73 were chosen such that the plot @xmath120 vs @xmath121 became a straight line intercepting the abscissa axis at @xmath62 .",
    "this method appeared to be not sensitive to particular values of @xmath73 and gave the accuracy @xmath95 k for critical temperature location .",
    "though the critical exponent @xmath73 can be obtained from the curve slope in double - logarithmic plot , this method produced results only after separating the data into two intervals in @xmath82 which were characterized by obviously different critical exponents : one of the `` pure '' ising model and the other one of rim .",
    "the crossover in @xmath73 occured within a very narrow range and at relatively large values of @xmath122 for small dilution @xmath123 .",
    "the subsequent ms study appeared two years later @xcite and is characterized by a very detailed analysis of the data .",
    "an advantage was the high quality of the sample grown from a stoichiometrical mixture of @xmath53 and @xmath64 powders , each prepared by reacting a metal sponge with dry @xmath124 at @xmath125 . in the experiment concentration gradients in a single crystal absorber",
    "were minimized by choosing the direction of the @xmath8-ray parallel the growth axis , both perpendicular to the plane of the sample disk of exposing sizes @xmath126 mm .",
    "20 constant - acceleration spectra were obtained within @xmath127 .",
    "very good temperature stability @xmath128 mk / day and account of correction - to - scaling permitted to obtain the asymptotic rim magnetization critical exponent @xmath73 from the data in the investigated interval ( see table [ table_experiment ] ) .",
    "the optical linear birefringence method ( lb ) introduced in ref .",
    "@xcite for the study of critical behaviour of the magnetic part of the specific heat @xmath129 in disordered magnets was continued in refs @xcite .",
    "the proportionality between the temperature derivative @xmath130 of the optical birefringence @xmath131 and @xmath129 is assumed for studies of optically transparent materials . while the caloric properties in the critical region can be measured also by the pulsed heat technique ,",
    "the lb method has several advantages : first of all , the non - magnetic contribution to the temperature derivative of the optical birefringence is insignificant , contrary to thermal techniques where the non - magnetic phonon background is often large and difficult to eliminate ; secondly , one can minimize the concentration fluctuations effects by applying a laser beam perpendicularly to the concentration gradients . in the first experiment @xcite a class of single crystals with various impurity concentration showed the exponent @xmath19 to be independent of concentration and in very good agreement with the theoretical predictions ( see table iii ) , while the two subsequent studies @xcite showed the equivalence of the lb method results with the direct heat pulsing measurements .",
    "magnetic @xmath104-ray scattering successfully applied to the `` pure '' ising crystal @xcite was applied to the ",
    "random  ising crystal for high dilution in ref .",
    "@xcite . for samples of sizes",
    "@xmath132 mm and of good crystallographic as well as mosaic quality the mean - field value for the exponent @xmath73 has been found up to @xmath133 , while closer to @xmath62 an exponent @xmath73 consistent with the rim value was obtained .",
    "the power  law singularities like ( [ 2 ] ) in physical quantities only appear in the thermodynamic limit when the system volume and the number of particles tend to infinity .",
    "therefore an obvious obstacles in computer  experiments  is that simulations can be done for a system of finite size only .",
    "moreover the asymptotic temperature interval fails to be reached since @xmath3 itself is not known exactly , whereas the location of the critical temperature is crucial for the accuracy of critical exponents determination .",
    "one can extrapolate to the thermodynamic limit assuming that the regime of a constant asymptotic critical exponent is established already starting from a certain finite system size and within an interval around @xmath3 of a certain non  zero size .",
    "the last assumption exploited in computer simulations leads to a very narrow temperature intervals below and above @xmath3 reliable for data sampling .",
    "the upper bounds are the temperatures where correction - to - scaling accounts for , while the lower bounds follow from finite - size effects and are of order @xmath134 for typical system sizes achieved now in the monte carlo ( mc ) simulations .",
    "therefore , the exponents obtained in the manner described often are effective critical exponents which characterize the critical behaviour in the observable temperature range . on the other hand different time scales govern the dynamical behaviour of pure and disordered spin systems and only very long - running simulations yield reliable data .",
    "the relaxation time increases drastically not only when approaching @xmath3 . moreover , in the early simulations it increased also with dilution and yielded in several decades greater values when passing from a pure @xmath135 system to a diluted one with @xmath136 .",
    "however an application of a more elaborated simulation technique resulted in an opposite behaviour : the decrease of the relaxation time for a certain disordered sample with an increase of @xmath71 @xcite . and",
    "it is the configurational averaging that leads to overall increase of the computation time .",
    "the statistical errors for thermodynamic observables result mainly from variance in configurational space and are larger than usual statistical errors in finite - size simulations with usual now statistics of @xmath137 mcs ( monte carlo steps per spin ) .",
    "consequently , the accuracy is bounded by the available cpu time from one side and limited by the number of samples to perform the configuration average of a disordered model @xcite from the other side .",
    "efficient algorithms together with high - speed computers partially solve the task .    despite of this unpleasant situation",
    "monte carlo studies provided deep insight into the origin of the phase transition in the rim as well as resulted in reliable numerical values for the critical exponents .",
    "mc studies of three dimensional rim systems have been carried out over the last two decades . the first search @xcite for universal critical characteristics of a rim was performed on a simple cubic lattice of a size up to @xmath138 on the basis of an importance sampling mc method @xcite .",
    "the positions of specific heat peaks corresponding to finite - lattice pseudo - critical temperature were extrapolated by means of finite - size scaling theory to @xmath3 , and the accuracy of @xmath139 mcs per data point with averaging over several different starting configurations of impurities did not allow to discriminate between disorder relevance or irrelevance . from a fit the value of the order parameter exponent @xmath73 and the susceptibility exponent @xmath8 of rim could not be distinguished within the error bars from the corresponding exponents of the pure ( non - diluted ) system for any dilution ( see table ii , ref .",
    "@xcite ) . as a possible explanation",
    "it was stated that the lattice studied were too small to reach the critical region .",
    "the predictions of the authors that `` impure '' critical behaviour can be observed only for systems with larger critical regions ( larger @xmath48 ) was objected by the mc simulations of rim on larger lattices with narrower dilution range @xcite , higher statistics of @xmath140 mcs , larger number of averaged samples and more detailed analysis of simulational data .",
    "the phase transition temperature @xmath3 was located by adjusting data of specific  heat and numerical derivative of the energy . in this way",
    "the critical temperature accuracy was improved to @xmath141 and the relevance of disorder for the universal critical properties was concluded .",
    "this result was confirmed by magnetization data , though the critical exponent @xmath73 was found to vary continuously with the magnetic sites concentration and no temperature region with constant @xmath73 was found .",
    "similarly to ref .",
    "@xcite the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite stressed that while they can not exclude the existence of a tiny impure critical region it must be unobservable for the weak dilution experimentally as well as by monte carlo methods , and effective critical exponents varying continuously with dilution would always show up according to the two fixed points scenario ( see fig .",
    "[ figfp ] ) .",
    "even the possibility of the existence of a line of fixed points , one for each impurity concentration , was not excluded ( compare the dependence of the magnetization critical exponent @xmath73 on the concentration of magnetic sites in table [ table_mc ] , ref .",
    "@xcite ) .    the results mentioned above appeared to be in a good agreement with the mc data of ref .",
    "@xcite obtained on the basis of a multi - spin coding program where twice as large systems and @xmath142 mcs statistics were used for a given concentration and temperature .",
    "the effective exponent @xmath73 was found to increase continuously with dilution as well .",
    "however this was believed to be a consequence of the fact that one needs to compute the equilibrium magnetization much closer to the critical point .",
    "two years later the conclusion that reliable critical exponent values could not be obtained by the simulation of systems with sizes @xmath143 was drawn in ref .",
    "statistical errors in the determination of the critical temperature from susceptibility and/or specific heat data , together with the extrapolation by finite - size scaling were thought to be responsible for this situation . in particular correction - to - scaling @xcite",
    "should be taken into account .",
    "instead , the simulation with the statistics @xmath140 mcs , but no configuration average allowed a determination of the exponent @xmath73 obviously larger than the pure one , while the determination of @xmath8 were not done because of a large scatter of the data .",
    "a reanalysis of the previous mc simulations @xcite led the authors to the conclusion that a large part of critical regime is dominated by the crossover from the pure ising exponents to rim ones : the results of ref .",
    "@xcite may correspond to a plateau value of the effective critical exponent governed by the pure ising fixed point , while refined results of refs @xcite correspond to an intermediate regime before the asymptotic regime , unaccessible near @xmath3 , is reached . enforcing the concept of effective critical exponents @xcite ( see formula ( [ 2 ] ) ) the authors of ref .",

    "one can see that they do not possess non - trivial fixed points at all !",
    "however , such behaviour is not surprising and is not a particular feature of the rim .",
    "it is well known that perturbation series for the rg functions in the weak coupling limit are asymptotic at best and should be evaluated by means of special resummation technique",
    ". this will be the subject of the next section [ vi ] , and here , to complete the list of possible calculation schemes we mention two more schemes in the massive rg approach :    @xmath276 * 3 . * the massive rg scheme is implemented by ( i ) solving the system of fixed point equations ( [ 24 ] ) numerically and then ( ii ) substituting the fixed point coordinates numerical values into the series for the critical exponents .",
    "this is the way which most of the papers are devoted to in the rim rg analysis ( see the next section for more details ) .",
    "@xmath276 * 4 . * the massive rg scheme implemented by a pseudo-@xmath270 expansion @xcite .",
    "this scheme is based on the observation that in order to analyze the series ( [ 39])([42 ] ) one can imitate an @xmath270expansion introducing an auxiliary parameter @xmath82 instead of the zeroth ",
    "order term @xmath163 in the massive scheme @xmath73functions ( [ 39 ] ) , ( [ 40 ] ) .",
    "then fps and critical exponents are obtained as series in @xmath82 with substitution @xmath290 to obtain their final values .",
    "the described pseudo@xmath270 expansion @xcite allows to avoid cumulation of the errors for the critical exponents from the errors of the fixed point coordinates and the @xmath8 functions .",
    "it proved to be highly efficient for the pure @xmath0 ising model @xcite .",
    "for the same reasons as the @xmath270-expansion for rim turns to the @xmath287 expansion , the expansion in @xmath82 turns to a @xmath291expansion . on the basis of the six",
    " loop expansions ( [ 39])([42 ] ) we get the following @xmath291expansion for the rim critical exponents and the stability matrix eigenvalues : @xmath292 these expressions are to be compared with the formulas ( [ 47])([51 ] ) .",
    "the core of the perturbation approach described above is the account of higher perturbation contributions .",
    "however , such a way does not lead necessarily to cumulation of the calculation accuracy by a `` naive '' summation of successive perturbation theory terms .",
    "it is well known by now that the weak coupling expansion series for rg functions have zero radii of convergence and are asymptotic at best @xcite .",
    "appropriate resummation procedures are to be applied in order to handle them",
    ". early studies of critical phenomena by the @xmath270-expansion technique lead to a concept of a series `` optimal truncation '' as a maximal number of terms possessing convergent behaviour .",
    "such behaviour is typical for asymptotic series @xcite where series expansion coefficients grow factorially .",
    "for example , the expansion of a rg function @xmath293 of pure ising model in powers of a ( single ) renormalized coupling @xmath51 : @xmath294 was shown to possess the following behaviour @xmath295 , \\hspace{1em } k\\to\\infty\\ ] ] with known values @xcite of constants @xmath56 , @xmath296 , @xmath106 .",
    "the property ( [ 58 ] ) indicates the borel summability of the series ( [ 57 ] ) .",
    "the borel resummation procedure takes into account the asymptotic behaviour of the coefficients ( [ 58 ] ) and maps the asymptotic series ( [ 57 ] ) to a convergent one with the same asymptotic limit",
    ". we will describe the procedure in more details in subsections [ vi2 ] and [ vi3 ] .",
    "it is worthwhile to note , that there does not exists a proof of borel - summability for the @xmath270-expansion of a pure ising model . only expansion in coupling ( [ 57 ] ) is proved to posses this property @xcite .",
    "nonetheless the rich amount of numerical estimates obtained on the basis of resummed @xmath270-expansion for the pure ising model ( see e.g. @xcite ) convinces one in its reliability .",
    "however it is not the case for the @xmath287-expansion of rim .",
    "the fact that @xmath270-expansion will not be able to give information on critical exponents in system with quenched disorder was predicted already in refs @xcite by studying the randomly diluted model in zero dimensions .",
    "the perturbation theory series of this toy - model appeared to be borel non - summable .",
    "moreover , such properties were shown @xcite to be the direct consequence of the existence of griffiths - like singularities @xcite caused by zeroes of the partition function of the pure system . although the @xmath287-expansion allowed to predict qualitatively new critical behaviour of the rim @xcite it seems to be of no use for a quantitative analysis .",
    "moreover , from naively adding the successive perturbational contributions in the @xmath287-expansion for the rim stability matrix eigenvalues ( [ 50 ] ) , ( [ 51 ] ) one observes that already in the three ",
    "loop approximation ( @xmath297 ) @xmath298 becomes negative and therefore no stable fixed point exists in strict @xmath287-expansion @xcite ! even the resummation procedures applied do not change this picture @xcite .",
    "quite different convergence properties of the expansions for pure @xmath0 ising model and rim may be seen already applying simple pad analysis as it was shown in refs @xcite .",
    "the above mentioned divergent properties of the @xmath287-expansion concern also the pseudo-@xmath287 expansion ( [ 52])([55 ] ) derived in section [ v ] .",
    "so there remain only two out of four different ways of numerical analysis of the rim rg functions .",
    "they are denoted by * @xmath276 2 * and * @xmath276 3 * in the preceding subsection [ v2 ] .",
    "both are based on analysis of rg series in two couplings .",
    "the nature of the rim rg functions series in couplings @xmath51 , @xmath266 remains opened .",
    "nonetheless , the resummation procedures which in different modifications are used in analysis of asymptotic series have been applied fruitfully to the rim rg series as well . the method which prevails in the resummation of the rim rg series is the generalization of a pad - borel resummation technique @xcite for the case of two variables .",
    "we will review results based on such resummation in the next subsection [ vi2 ] .",
    "recently , it was shown that the expansions for the quenched diluted ising model in @xmath299 dimensions are borel summable , provided a specific way of summation is applied @xcite .",
    "this allowed authors of ref . @xcite both to recover the asymptotic behaviour of expansion coefficient as well as to apply to rim six  loop massive rg functions @xcite the resummation technique refined by a conformal mapping .",
    "this method will be reviewed in the last subsection [ vi3 ] .      in order to perform the pad - borel resummation of a truncated ( asymptotic ) series in a single variable ( e. g. series ( [ 57 ] ) with @xmath300 terms available )",
    "one defines the borel ",
    "leroy image of the initial sum @xmath301 by : @xmath302 where @xmath303 is the euler s gamma function and @xmath304 is an arbitrary non - negative number , which will serve as a fit parameter . the result ( [ 59 ] ) is extrapolated by means of a rational approximant @xmath305 ( u)$ ] , which is the quotient of two polynomials in @xmath51 with @xmath180 as the order of the numerator and @xmath306 as that of the denominator ( a pad approximant @xcite ) .",
    "subsequently , the resummed function @xmath307 is obtained in the form : @xmath308 ( ut).\\ ] ] in the single - variable rg functions analysis this procedure was initiated in refs @xcite .",
    "there are different ways to generalize single variable pad approximants for the case of two variables @xmath309 @xcite and , subsequently to generalize the resummation procedure ( [ 59 ] ) , ( [ 60 ] ) .",
    "one possibility is to construct the series in a single dummy variable @xmath1 ( so - called resolvent series @xcite ) .",
    "the variable is introduced by a substitution @xmath310 , @xmath311 and @xmath1 must be put equal to @xmath163 to obtain final results . in accordance , the borel - leroy image of a truncated series @xmath312 is defined by : @xmath313 then the series in @xmath1 is resummed by formula ( [ 60 ] ) and evaluated at @xmath314 .",
    "we will refer to this method as to the pad ",
    "borel method similarly to the one  coupling case .",
    "another way to proceed is to make use of the chisholm approximants @xcite which are the generalization of pad  approximants to many",
    " variable case .",
    "a chisholm approximant can be defined as a ratio of two polynomials both in variables @xmath51 and @xmath266 , of degree @xmath180 and @xmath306 such that the first terms of its expansion are equal to those of the function which is approximated .",
    "again , the resummation is performed by ( [ 60 ] ) with chisholm approximant instead the pad one .",
    "this method will be referred below as the chisholm - borel resummation .    for a given borel ",
    "leroy image many approximants , both pad and chisholm , can be constructed .",
    "however , restrictions are imposed naturally .",
    "firstly , an approximant should be chosen in the form re - constituting the sign - alternating high - order behaviour of the general term of @xmath73- and @xmath8-functions @xcite .",
    "the approximant generating a sign  alternating series might be chosen in a form @xmath315 $ ] with the positive coefficients at the variable @xmath1 ( or @xmath51 and @xmath266 ) .",
    "however , these are the diagonal approximants which give the best convergence in pad analysis @xcite ( see also @xcite for a toy model example ) .",
    "on the other hand , high degree of a polynomial in the denominator often leads to poles on the positive semi - axis .",
    "one can use analytic continuation and calculate the principal value of the integral ( [ 60 ] ) to process the singularities however practical calculations reject the generalization @xcite .",
    "the reason is both unexpected shift of fixed point location and different topological structure of the lines of zeros for the resummed @xmath73-functions .",
    "the choice of a chisholm approximant is even more complicated since often its coefficients are undetermined .",
    "for instance , already two ",
    "variable polynomials of a second order require two additional conditions to be imposed .",
    "normally they are chosen to preserve certain symmetry properties .",
    "provided the couplings @xmath35 and @xmath36 enter the hamiltonian ( [ 8 ] ) symmetrically , the approximants must be symmetric in variables @xmath51 and @xmath266 in order not to introduce an additional symmetry .",
    "another point is that by substitution @xmath282 all the equations which describe the critical behaviour of the diluted model are converted into appropriate equations of the pure model . however ,",
    "if pure model is solved independently , the resummation technique with the application of pad approximant is used .",
    "thus , chisholm approximant is to be chosen in such a way that , by putting any of @xmath51 or @xmath266 equal to zero , one reproduces familiar results for the one - variable case .",
    "this also implies a special choice of additional conditions .",
    "most numerical results on the universal characteristics of rim at criticality were obtained on the basis of the massive renormalization scheme by numerically solving fixed point equations ( [ 24 ] ) for the resummed @xmath73-functions ( [ 39 ] ) , ( [ 40 ] ) and resumming the @xmath8functions ( [ 41]),([42 ] ) in the stable fixed point ( scheme * @xmath276 3 * in the subsection [ v2 ] ) .",
    "the study of the massive @xmath73-functions of rim resummed in this way revealed that starting from the two ",
    "loop approximation the random fixed point ( * r * : see figure [ figfp ] ) is stable and is present in all orders of perturbation theory .",
    "as an example , in figures [ figcomp1 ] , [ figcomp2 ] we show the lines of zeros of functions @xmath316 @xmath317 in different orders of perturbation theory without resummation and resummed by the chisholm - borel method .",

    "loop level the straightforward analysis of the @xmath73functions @xcite yielded fixed point coordinates and critical exponents without resummation , but the obtained accuracy did not allow to estimate , for instance , heat capacity critical behaviour . on the other hand , the application of the pad ",
    "borel technique also encountered hardships within the three ",
    "loop level ( see diagram in the fig . [ table.eps ] ) . here",
    ", the approximant with linear denominator does not yield a fixed point , while another near  diagonal approximant @xmath319 $ ] is unreliable because reveals fixed point only when processing the pole on the real axis via analytic continuation .",

    "whereas pad  borel calculations of ref .",
    "@xcite exploited the [ 3/1 ] pad approximant , ref .",
    "@xcite used a more elaborated generalized pad ",
    "borel  leroy resummation method .",
    "the last is based on exploiting all possible pad approximants in the borel - leroy resummation ( [ 59])([60 ] ) choosing for each of them the optimal value of the leroy parameter @xmath304 and then averaging the result over all values given by the approximants @xcite .",
    "the expressions in the five  loop approximation analyzed with the application of the fit parameter @xmath304 required rather artificial rejecting of many approximants @xcite .",
    "for instance , using a criterion that those approximants are working , which provide maximal stability against variation of @xmath304 , the approximant @xmath321 $ ] was chosen to estimate @xmath52 and the approximant @xmath322 $ ] to obtain @xmath323 .",
    "the analysis allowed the authors of refs @xcite to obtain the five loop estimates for the rim critical exponents ( see table [ table_theory ] ) .",
    "however , the extend to the six  loop order revealed a wide gap between five and six  loop fixed point coordinates @xcite with subsequent inconsistency of the six  loop values of critical exponents compared with the five  loop results of refs @xcite . this might serve as an indirect evidence of a possible non - asymptotic nature of the series under consideration .",
    "similar resummation technique was also applied to the minimal subtraction rg functions ( [ 35])([38 ] ) directly at @xmath0 ( scheme * @xmath276 2 * in the subsection [ v2 ] ) @xcite . here ,",
    "asymptotic as well as effective critical behaviour was studied .",
    "again , as in the massive rg case , resummation restores the presence of non - trivial fixed point in the two  loop approximation ( see figure [ figbetares ] ) and preserves it in three @xcite and four loops @xcite . however , in the five - loop order the applied chisholm - borel resummation scheme did not lead to a real root for the random fixed point @xcite .",
    "one of reasons for such behaviour may be ( possible ) borel - non - summability of the series under consideration .",
    "in this case the four  loop approximation will be an `` optimal truncation '' for the resummed minimal subtraction perturbation theory series , similar to the non - resummed asymptotic series , e.g. in the @xmath270expansion of @xmath324symmetric @xmath325 model , where `` naive '' interpretation of the series truncated by @xmath326 term leads to the best ( optimal ) result .",

    "but it assumes that the behaviour of high order terms of the series expansion is known .",
    "it is not the case for the rim and hence the pad - borel based resummation technique was used there as described in the former subsection [ vi2 ] .",

    "it leads to the conclusion @xcite that probably the optimal truncation of the rim @xmath73-functions corresponds to a shorter series than a six  loop one .",
    "in the present article we have reviewed results obtained so far in the description of critical properties of a three dimensional weakly diluted quenched ising model ( rim ) .",
    "following the prevailing bulk of experimental , monte - carlo , and theoretical studies we focused our attention on critical exponents of the model .",
    "it can be seen from the number of relevant papers that the precise determination of the values of the exponents was a challenge justifying the scientific effort .",
    "the reason for this is two - fold .",
    "( i ) the rim allows to include in a simple model the macroscopic effects of disorder always present in real substances .",
    "( ii ) the study of the influence of disorder on universal properties of critical behaviour besides practical needs is of high academic interest .",
    "it is the domain very close to critical temperature where even a very small amount of impurities can change the properties drastically in comparison with an ideal magnet . in accordance with the heuristic harris criterion @xcite ,",
    "only when the ideal system specific heat is divergent at criticality , the disordered magnet is characterized by new critical exponents .",
    "the change of critical exponents of rim is well established in experimental as well as monte - carlo and theoretical studies .",
    "however , the numerical values obtained show much worse self - consistency compared with the situation in studies of pure ising magnets .",
    "this happens due to both technical and principal difficulties .",
    "moreover , often the technical difficulties in determination of the rim exponents are related to the principal ones !",
    "though it is commonly believed that various defects are inevitable in experimental samples , the number of experimental rim studies is much less than those devoted to the determination of the ising model critical exponents . as an explanation",
    "one might mention that the ising model universality class includes not only magnets but also simple fluids , ferroelectrics , binary alloys , etc .",
    "moreover the rim itself can show an effective critical behaviour of the same type as the behaviour in the ising model universality class ( ! ) .",
    "the data for experimentally determined rim critical exponents are collected in table [ table_experiment ] . as an peculiarity it is interesting to note that already in early studies @xcite critical behaviour different from the pure ising model has been observed . surprisingly enough , since this work neither the experimental precision of the determination of the critical exponents has increased nor a narrower temperature interval around the critical point could be accessed .",
    "this can be explained by noting that starting from the end of eighties the researchers attention shifted to random - field ising model and the data for rim were obtained only as side product results .",
    "it is worthwhile to note that the theoretically predicted critical exponents for quenched disorder @xcite : @xmath341 and for annealed disorder @xcite : @xmath342 , are different but only by a small amount .",
    "most probably , in real samples one encounters intermediate situations and exact coincidence between experiments on diluted crystalline antiferromagnets and theoretical calculations is hardly expected .    while the existence of a new universality class for the rim has been observed already in early experimental studies , this was not the case in monte - carlo simulations . due to the lack of a proper finite size analysis a continuous dependence of the critical exponents on concentration was observed .",
    "the exponents were interpreted as effective critical exponents @xcite . in the following it was crucial to recognize the role of the correction - to - scaling exponent in the analysis of the simulation data @xcite .",
    "this allowed to conclude from the numerical data on the concentration - independent asymptotic critical exponents @xcite .",
    "as one can note from the table [ table_mc ] the improvement of computers as well as of the calculation algorithms allowed to increase the accuracy of critical exponents . recently in monte - carlo simulations of the rim attention was paid also to study of the problems of self - averaging in diluted systems @xcite .",
    "the results of experimental studies and monte - carlo simulations are confirmed by theoretical calculations .",
    "the numerical values of critical exponents obtained by different theoretical methods are collected in the table [ table_theory ] .",
    "note , that all theoretical results were obtained within renormalization - group approach , and most of them within its field - theoretical formalism on the basis of the effective landau - ginzburg - wilson hamiltonian ( [ 8 ] ) .",
    "though the last approach encounters intrinsic obstacles such as problems with the breakdown of replica symmetry and the possible existence of griffiths phase @xcite , it remains the only method which can calculate the asymptotic values of exponents .",
    "for the pure ising model many results are also based on other methods such as high- and low - temperature expansions",
    ".    another evident difference of the rim in comparison with the ising model lies in the applicability of different regularisation schemes of field - theoretical renormalization - group approach . in the case of ising model",
    "both massive and minimal subtraction scheme followed by @xmath270-expansion provide consistent and reliable results . for the rim , the @xmath270-expansion degenerates into @xmath343-expansion @xcite which seems to be of no use for quantitative studies @xcite .",
    "moreover , the initial series in the couplings , both in the massive and the minimal subtraction schemes , seem not to be borel summable @xcite .",

    "however , the determination of error - bars in the theoretical calculations is a difficult problem which is solved in various ways @xcite . here , the error - bars seem to measure rather uncertainty of specific theoretical procedures than the confidence intervals of true values .    for",
    "a comparison of the theoretical predictions with experimental and simulation data one should use effective critical exponents which have been calculated for the rim within the rg approach @xcite .    at the very end of this review",
    "we want to attract attention again to the fact that the new critical behaviour corresponding to the rim universality class was experimentally observed so far only in magnetic systems like ( anti)ferromagnets ( see table [ table_experiment ] ) .",
    "still it remains a challenge to set up an experiment showing rim - behaviour in other condensed matter systems .",
    "a promising example might be a fluid near its liquid  gas critical point in a porous medium .",
    "recently , precise experiments on the critical behaviour of liquid helium-4 near the superfluid transition in porous medium @xcite confirmed the irrelevancy of quenched disorder .",
    "this was expected from the harris criterion @xcite since the specific heat exponent near the superfluid transition is roughly zero .",
    "thus an experimental study of a simple liquid in a porous medium may provide the first observation of a rim critical behaviour in a non - magnetic system @xcite .",
