    "at sufficiently large momentum transfer @xmath0 , the deep - inelastic scattering ( dis ) process receives significant electroweak contributions where a virtual @xmath1 or @xmath2 boson is exchanged between the lepton and the nucleon instead of a photon .",
    "while parity - violating neutral current ( nc ) reactions are also accessible at values of @xmath0 much smaller than the @xmath1 boson mass , thanks to the presence of @xmath3-interference contributions to dis , charged current ( cc ) events can only be studied either in high - energy lepton - nucleon collisions @xcite or at neutrino scattering experiments @xcite .",
    "data from cc dis experiments provide invaluable , complementary information on the partonic structure of nucleons as they probe combinations of quark flavors different from those accessible in purely electromagnetic dis . in global qcd extractions of unpolarized parton density functions ( pdfs )",

    "the results confirmed expectations from electroweak theory by extracting , for instance , up - type and down - type quark couplings .",
    "corresponding cc dis data taken on longitudinally polarized nucleons do not yet exist , and flavor - separated quark and antiquark helicity pdfs are obtained exclusively from semi - inclusive dis data with identified pions and kaons in the final state @xcite .",
    "their theoretical description is more involved than for inclusive dis and requires the knowledge of parton - to - hadron fragmentation functions which in turn have to be extracted from global qcd analyses of inclusive hadron yields @xcite .",
    "new data from bnl - rhic on @xmath2 production in polarized proton - proton collisions shall provide an alternative and novel source of information on helicity pdfs at medium - to - large momentum fractions @xmath4 @xcite .",
    "clearly , cc dis measurements with polarized nucleons would be a very welcome and valuable addition to the existing suite of experimental data used in extractions of helicity pdfs .    in this paper",
    "we perform a detailed study of the feasibility , expected accuracy , and physics impact of cc dis measurements on polarized nucleons to be performed for the first time at a future electron - ion collider ( eic ) @xcite such as the erhic project at bnl @xcite . a major experimental complication and potential limitation compared to purely electromagnetic or nc dis is the lack of the scattered lepton to determine the relevant kinematic variables @xmath4 and @xmath0 in cc dis .",
    "therefore , we will carefully scrutinize the validity and the accuracy of the jacquet - blondel ( jb ) method for reconstructing @xmath4 and @xmath0 from the measured hadronic final state in cc events @xcite , assuming realistic detector performance parameters .",
    "to simulate polarized cc dis events , we utilize the event generator package djangoh @xcite , which we have extended to handle processes with longitudinally polarized nucleons .",
    "djangoh also allows us to study and quantify the size of electroweak radiative corrections , in particular qed effects due to the emission of real photons which can lead to significant shifts of the kinematic variables away from their `` true '' or born - level values .",
    "such radiative corrections are known to be sizable in certain kinematic regimes from nc and cc dis measurements at hera and need to be properly unfolded .",
    "we will demonstrate below that at an eic one can perform measurements of cc dis in the range @xmath5 @xmath6 $ ] and @xmath7 , accessible with the planned lepton and nucleon beam energies of @xmath8 @xmath9 $ ] , with good resolution from the jb method . since the expected cc single - spin asymmetries are large for most of the accessible @xmath4 and @xmath0 region , ranging from a few percent at low @xmath4 up to @xmath10 at large @xmath4 , even modest integrated luminosities of @xmath11 turn out to be sufficient for first meaningful measurements .",
    "we use pseudo - data generated with djangoh in the above kinematic domain to study their potential impact in constraining helicity pdfs . to this end , we perform a global qcd analysis at next - to - leading order ( nlo ) accuracy following the framework and methodology of the dssv collaboration @xcite .",

    "the implementation of higher - order corrections at one - loop order and including one - photon radiative effects is straightforward in the case of cc scattering since for massless quarks helicity agrees with chirality .",

    "we should emphasize that the actual size of radiative effects strongly depends on the prescription used to reconstruct kinematic variables .",
    "the numerical results shown here are meant as an illustration of the possible importance of radiative corrections , but will be numerically different when they are evaluated within a realistic analysis where kinematic variables are reconstructed from the hadronic final state , as described in the next section .",
    "qed is invariant with respect to parity and the probability to emit a photon , which can be described by a `` radiator function '' , does not depend on the chirality of the emitting particle .",

    "a commonly used technique would be to use roman pots properly integrated into the interaction region to guarantee high detection efficiencies of @xmath89 .",

    "this is readily understood from the relative @xmath67-resolutions for both methods : @xmath92 and @xmath93 .",
    "the resolution in @xmath0 degrades the more of the hadronic transverse momentum @xmath94 of an event is missed by the detector .",

    "the resolution improves with increasing @xmath0 as more particles are scattered into the acceptance of the detector .",
    "as @xmath95 is calculated from @xmath96 and @xmath97 , the @xmath4 resolution generally follows that of @xmath0 . for both @xmath97 and @xmath95 , smearing due to detector resolution effects and radiative corrections can result in reconstructed values significantly deviating from the generated ones",

    "[ fig : jb ] , at the high @xmath0 values relevant for cc dis measurements , the jb method generally yields good resolutions in all relevant kinematic variables .",

    "the relatively low purities found at the highest @xmath0 bin for any given @xmath4 bin is caused by binning effects , which can be mitigated by adjusting the binning in the experiment .",

    "we note that we obtain quantitatively very similar results also for a lower electron beam energy of @xmath103 , i.e. , @xmath104 , but resulting in a somewhat limited kinematic @xmath105 coverage as will be illustrated below .    the dominant systematic uncertainty for a measurement of cc dis at an eic will be the error from the measurement of the hadron beam polarization .",
    "the currently best value for polarized protons achieved at rhic is @xmath106 .",
    "all other systematic uncertainties for cc dis will be significantly smaller .",
    "for our detailed phenomenological studies , we will mainly consider a c.m.s .",

    "as expected , @xmath159 changes only very little , mainly due to minor adjustments in @xmath185 and the sea quark densities in the special dssv set in order to respect sum rules .",

    "[ fig : kine ] , @xmath196 appears to be an appropriate choice .",
    "clearly , cc dis data will greatly help to further our understanding of helicity pdfs for @xmath168 and @xmath169 quarks and antiquarks .",
    "note that the sensitivity of @xmath163 to a possible @xmath202 for @xmath47 as discussed above is not even included in the estimates shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : profiles ] as they are based on the standard functional form of dssv .",

    "rhic they offer invaluable checks on current estimates of flavor separated helicity pdfs @xcite which are solely based on semi - inclusive dis data taken at relatively low values of @xmath0 where , in addition to uncertainties from ffs @xcite , power or higher - twist corrections can still be of some importance .",
    "we have presented a detailed phenomenological study of cc - mediated dis off longitudinally polarized protons and neutrons at a future electron - ion collider .",
    "our simulations have been based on an updated version of the event generator package djangoh , which previously could only handle unpolarized nucleons in dis .",
    "we have carefully explored the applicability of the jacquet - blondel method for reconstructing the relevant kinematic variables from the observed hadronic final state .",
    "detector effects were found to be the dominant source of kinematic smearing while the radiative corrections included in djangoh typically add an additional @xmath203-@xmath204 .",
    "error estimates for our simulated charged current single - spin asymmetries in electron - proton and electron - neutron scattering properly include unfolding corrections from imperfect purities in each bin .    to estimate the impact of the generated charged current single - spin asymmetries on determinations of helicity parton distributions , we have performed global qcd analyses at next - to - leading order accuracy including studies of uncertainties based on the lagrange multiplier technique .",
    "it was demonstrated that charged current dis measurement at an eic would be a very valuable addition to the suite of existing data , as they provide independent constraints on the @xmath168 and @xmath169 quark and antiquark helicity densities , free of ambiguities from hadronization .",
    "in addition , measurements of charged current dis off a longitudinally polarized effective neutron target , with spectator protons being tagged , have been shown to be particularly sensitive to theoretical expectations based on helicity retention arguments that the @xmath169 quark polarization should saturate and align with the nucleon s spin direction at large momentum fractions @xmath4 .",
    "all our studies were performed assuming a c.m.s .",
    "energy of @xmath71 , however , energies down to about @xmath205 , which are expected to be available at an initial version of an eic , appear to be sufficient as well . in each case , only modest integrated luminosities of about @xmath128 are needed to perform inclusive charged current dis measurements at an eic .",
    "we note that there are various other avenues for electroweak measurements at an eic that can be pursued based on the tools developed and studies performed in this paper .",
    "a natural extension would be to look into charged current mediated semi - inclusive dis . identified",
    "kaons may provide some sensitivity to the strangeness polarization at medium - to - large values of the momentum fraction @xmath4 and large @xmath0 .",
    "the relevant next - to - leading corrections were computed recently in @xcite . another way to determine strange sea distributions at an eic",
    "could be provided by measurements of charged current mediated charm production in dis .",
    "next - to - leading order qcd calculations for this process have already been performed quite some time ago @xcite when the prospect of operating hera with polarized hadron beams was discussed .",
    "both types of processes would require further additions to the djangoh event generator before detailed phenomenological studies , including detector effects and radiative corrections , can be pursued .",
    "lastly , it might be interesting to determine whether or not an eic could provide determination of electroweak vector and axial - vector couplings with an accuracy better than what was already achieved at hera",
