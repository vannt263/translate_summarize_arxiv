    "bismuth - tellurium systems@xcite and lead chalcogenides@xcite are excellent thermoelectric material in the application of thermoelectric devices .",
    "searching for high @xmath5 materials is the main objective of thermoelectric research , which requires a high electrical conductance and large seebeck coefficient and low thermal conductance .",

    ", we use 200 @xmath15 200 @xmath15 1 k - point meshes in the first brillouin zone for the energy band calculation .",
    "firstly , the crystal structure of monolayer @xmath0 is constructed with the vacuum region of 20 @xmath10 to avoid spurious interaction , and the optimized lattice constant is @xmath7=3.13 @xmath10 by using lda .",
    "the soc effect on electronic structures is considered , and the energy band structures by using lda and lda+soc are plotted in .",
    "both lda and lda+soc results show @xmath0 is a direct gap semiconductor , with the band gap value being 1.87 ev and 1.76 ev , respectively .",
    "both @xmath7 and lda gap are consistent with other theoretical values@xcite .",
    "it is clearly seen that soc has obvious influence on the valence bands near high symmetry k point , leading to a spin - orbital splitting value of 0.146 ev at k point , while has a negligible effect on the conduction bands near k point . however , the remarkable splitting is observed along the high symmetry @xmath16-k line on the conduction bands .",
    "these soc effects produce remarkable influence on the thermoelectric properties .",
    "the transport coefficients calculations , such as seebeck coefficient s and electrical conductivity with respect to scattering time @xmath8 , are performed within csta boltzmann theory .",

    "the negative doping levels imply the n - type doping , being related to conduction bands , with the negative seebeck coefficient , and the positive doping levels mean p - type doping , being connected to the valence bands , with the positive seebeck coefficient .    in p - type doping , soc has a detrimental influence on the seebeck coefficient s , while has a improved effect on s ( absolute value ) in n - type doping .",
    "the opposite soc effect on the @xmath8 is observed for both p - type and n - type doping .",
    "due to the dominant role of s to power factor , the same influence of soc on the power factor with s is found .",
    "the soc produces larger influence on power factor in p - type than in n - type .",
    "the maximum power factors ( mpf ) in unit of @xmath17@xmath18 are extracted in n - type and p - type doping with lda and lda+soc .",
    "the mpf by using lda+soc in p - type doping is about 52.5% smaller than that with lda , while the mpf with lda+soc is about 14.6 % bigger than that by lda in n - type .",
    "so , the soc has to be considered in the theoretical prediction of power factor of monolayer @xmath0 .",
    "the effects of soc on s can be explained by analyzing soc influence on the band structure . upon opening of soc , the conduction band extremum along the @xmath16-l line moves close to the conduction band minimum ( cbm ) due to the spin - orbital splitting , giving rise to more adjacent electron pockets ( n - type ) , which induces higher",
    "s. however , soc removes the degeneracy of valence band maximum ( vbm ) at the k point , reducing the slope of density of states ( dos ) near the fermi level in the valence bands ( p - type ) , which leads to the lower s. when soc is included , the valence bands become more dispersive , increasing the mobility of p - type charge carriers , resulting in an improved @xmath8 . however , soc has little effect on the conduction band dispersion , leading to weak dependence of soc on @xmath8 .",
    "strain effect on the electronic structures of monolayer @xmath0 has been widely investigated by the theoretical calculations at the absence of soc , and semiconductor - metal phase transition has been predicted by using both tensile and compressive strain@xcite .",

    "strain can induce the direct - indirect - gap crossover , due to changing from one point of @xmath16-k line to k point for cbm and from k to @xmath16 for vbm with increasing @xmath7 .",
    "the spin - orbit splitting monotonically increases with the increasing @xmath7 , but has little change about 0.02 ev with @xmath7 varying from 3.03 @xmath10 to 3.23 @xmath10 .",
    "the strain dependence of s , @xmath8 and @xmath9 with @xmath7 changing from 3.03 @xmath10 to 3.23 @xmath10 calculated by using lda+soc at temperature of 300 k are plotted in .",
    "the complex dependence of strain is observed , due to the sensitive dependence of energy band structures on the applied strain . by analysing the energy band structure and the corresponding power factor ,",
    "strain driven accidental degeneracies can explain strain dependence of power factor . in n - type doping , the larger",
    "s can be attained , leading to larger power factor , when the energy level of some conduction band extrema is closer . for these calculated @xmath7 ,",
    "the largest s and @xmath9 can be attained with @xmath7=3.10 @xmath10 in n - type doping due to the near degeneracy between conduction band extremum along @xmath16-k line and one at k point .",
    "the same mechanism can be used for p - type , and when the energy level of some valence peaks is more adjacent , the greater power factor can be gained . for p - type , s and",
    "@xmath9 reach the peak with @xmath7=3.17 @xmath10 , because the near degeneracy happen to be induced between @xmath16 point and k point near the fermi level in the valence bands .",

    "the soc can remove the band degeneracy , which produces remarkable influence on the power factor .",
    "the soc can lead to detrimental influence on power factor in @xmath20@xcite and half - heusler @xmath21 ( a = ti , hf , sc , y ; b = sn , sb , bi)@xcite , especially for p - type doping . for monolayer @xmath0 with optimized lattice constant , soc not only can reduce power factor in p - type doping , but can enhance one in n - type doping .",
    "when soc is not included , the p - type and n - type doping have the near same power factor .",
    "however , at the presence of soc , the n - type doping shows more excellent power factor than p - type doping .",
    "so , it is very crucial for power factor calculations to consider soc for monolayer @xmath0 in both p - type and n - type doping .",
    "strain or pressure is a very effective way to realize novel phenomenon by tuning the electronic structures , such as pressure - induced high - tc superconductivity@xcite and strain - induced topological insulator@xcite .",
    "the sensitive strain dependence of electronic structures of monolayer @xmath0 provides a platform to tune its thermoelectric properties .",
    "the high power factor can be attained by symmetry driven degeneracy , low - dimensional electronic structures and accidental degeneracies@xcite . here , the accidental degeneracies can be induced by both compressive and tensile strain at the critical strain of direct - indirect gap transition , which leads to the larger power factor in certain doping range .",
    "similar pressure induced accidental degeneracies , leading to large power factor , can be found in @xmath20 at the critical pressure of energy band gap@xcite .",
