    "to date , more than 250 extrasolar planets have been discovered and more than 29 of them are transiting their primary star .",
    "one transiting planet is a ",
    "neptune \" ( gj 436b ) , but the rest are giant planets with an impressively wide range of masses and radii that speak to the heterogeneity of the family of close - in egps ( * e*xtrasolar * g*iant * p*lanets ) .",
    "table [ t1 ] lists these transiting egps and some of their relevant properties , along with many of the references to the observational and discovery papers from which these data were taken .",
    "table [ t2 ] lists useful data for the corresponding primary stars , including their masses , luminosities , radii , and approximate ages .",
    "both tables are in order of increasing planetary semi - major axis and , considering the pace of the field , both should be considered provisional . not shown are the eccentricities , which are generally small , but which for hat - p-2b , gj 436b , and xo-3b are @xmath20.507 , @xmath20.14 , and @xmath20.22 , respectively . for these three close - in egps , significant tidal heating and , perhaps , forcing by an unseen companion are implied .",
    "radial - velocity measurements for a non - transiting egp provide a lower limit to its mass , but little else . however , the transiting egps yield radii as well , and resolve the @xmath3 ambiguity to reveal the planets masses .",
    "these data provide physical constraints with which detailed evolutionary and structural models that incorporate irradiation and migration can be tested ( see , e.g. , burrows et al . 2007a ; guillot et al . 2006 ) . with superb photometric accuracy ,",
    "the wavelength - dependence of the transit radii can in principle provide a measure of a planet s atmospheric composition ( fortney et al .",
    "2003 ) . in this way",
    ", sodium has been detected in hd 209458b ( charbonneau et al . 2002 ) and water has been identified in both hd 189733b ( tinetti et al .",
    "2007 , but see ehrenreich et al . 2007 ) and hd 209458b ( barman 2007 ) .",
    "moreover , high - precision optical photometry has constrained ( perhaps , measured ) the geometric albedo of the close - in egp hd 209458b ( rowe et al .",
    "2006 , 2007 ) .",
    "hd 209458b s optical albedo is very low ( @xmath23.8@xmath4% ) , in keeping with the predictions of sudarsky et al .",
    "( 2000 ) when the alkali metals , and not clouds , dominate absorption in the atmosphere and rayleigh scattering dominates scattering .    nevertheless , using current technology , transit measurements have limited utility in characterizing the atmospheres and compositions of these planets .",
    "astronomers require more direct detections of the planet s spectrum to probe its chemistry and atmospheric properties .",
    "this is in the tradition of remote sensing in the solar system and of the earth . until recently , it had been thought that the light from an extrasolar planet had to be separated from under the glare of its parent star using high - angular resolution , extremely high - contrast imaging",
    "this is still the case in the optical for the cool  wide - separation \" egps ( burrows et al . 2004 ; sudarsky et al . 2005 ; burrows 2005 ) and terrestrial planets , for which the planet - star contrast ratio is @xmath210@xmath5 to @xmath210@xmath6 , but such performance has not yet been demonstrated .",
    "however , for the hot close - in egps , the planet - star contrast ratios in the mid - infrared are much more favorable ( burrows , sudarsky , & hubeny 2003,2004 ) , oftimes exceeding 10@xmath7 .",
    "this capability has led to a breakthrough in the study of exoplanets . with the infrared space telescope _ spitzer _",
    "( werner & fanson 1995 ) , using its irac and mips cameras and the irs spectrometer , one can now measure the summed light of the planet and the star in and out of secondary eclipse , and thereby , from the difference , determine the planet s spectrum at superior conjunction .",
    "moreover , for a subset of the closest egps it is possible to use _",
    "spitzer _ to measure their flux variations with planetary phase between transit and secondary eclipse .",
    "hence , for the close - in egps in the near- to mid - infrared , and without the need to separately image planet and star , the direct detection of planetary atmospheres via low - resolution spectroscopy and precision infrared ( ir ) photometry is now a reality .",
    "the secondary eclipse fluxes have now been measured for five transiting egps ( hd 189733b , tres-1 , hd 209458b , hd 149026b , gj 436b ) , but not yet in all _ spitzer _ bands .",
    "in addition , using the irs spectrometer , spectra between @xmath27.5 @xmath8 m and @xmath215 @xmath8 m of two transiting egps at secondary eclipse have been obtained ( hd 189733b [ grillmair et al . 2007 ] and hd 209458b [ richardson et al . 2007 ] ) .",
    "though at very low resolution , these are the first measured spectra of any extrasolar planet . furthermore , light curves have been measured for three egps ( @xmath0 and b [ harrington et al .",
    "2006 : at 24 @xmath8 m ] , hd 179949b [ cowan et al . 2007 : at 8 @xmath8 m ] , and hd 189733b [ knutson et al .",
    "2007b : at 8 @xmath8 m ] ) .",
    "only one of these ( hd 189733b ) is transiting and has an absolute calibration . for none of the latter three",
    "are there extant light - curve measurements for more than one _ spitzer _ band ; for some of these egps only upper limits in a few of the other bands have been determined .",
    "table [ t3 ] summarizes all the direct detection data for the egp family obtained to date ( circa june 1 , 2007 ) , along with associated references , comments , and table notes .",
    "clearly , in the next year or two we can expect a great deal more secondary eclipse and light - curve data in the various _ spitzer _",
    "irac and mips bands .",
    "however , there has already been significant progress in measuring egp atmospheres .",
    "this paper is a continuation of our series of interpretative studies ( e.g. , burrows et al .",
    "2005 , 2006 , 2007b ) of the direct measurements of close - in egps . here ,",
    "we analyze the secondary eclipse and light - curve data summarized in table [ t3 ] for the egps hd 189733b , hd 209456b , tres-1 , hd 149026b , hd 179949b , and @xmath0 and b and make theoretical predictions in support of future _ spitzer _ planet measurement campaigns .",
    "importantly , by fitting the current data we extract physical information concerning the atmospheres , compositions , and thermal profiles of these first six objects listed in table [ t3 ] .",
    "we have explored the dependence of the spectra and light curves on the heat redistribution factor p@xmath1 ( burrows et al .",
    "2006 ) , on atmospheric metallicity , and on the possible presence of a stratospheric absorber . the recent analysis by burrows et al .",
    "( 2007b ) of the irac data of knutson et al . ( 2007c ) indicates that hd 209458b boasts a thermal inversion that radically alters the _ spitzer _ fluxes and their interpretation .",
    "in fact , in burrows et al .",
    "( 2007b ) , we speculate that thermal inversions and stratospheres may play a role in the atmospheres of many close - in egps and are a new feature in the study of transiting planets .",
    "a similar conclusion was reached by fortney et al .",
    "( 2006 ) , specifically in the context of hd 149026b .",
    "we find that we can fit all the secondary eclipse and light - curve data , except for the nightside flux of hd 189733b and its day / night contrast .",
    "while we can fit its dayside secondary eclipse flux , we suspect that hd 189733b will require a more sophisticated day / night redistribution model than we now employ (  [ tech ] ) .",
    "we note that knutson et al .",
    "( 2007b ) conclude that the dimmest and brightest spots on hd 189733b reside on the same hemisphere and that the dimmest spot is shifted from the anti - stellar point by as much as @xmath230@xmath9 .",
    "our current light curve models are symmetric about the peak .",
    "we find that the degree of longitudinal heat redistribution ( p@xmath1 ) may vary from planet to planet , hinting at a variety of meteorological conditions and day / night contrasts within the family of close - in egps .",
    "moreover , as also concluded in burrows et al .",
    "( 2005 ) , we can not obtain good fits at secondary eclipse without the presence of water in abundance in the atmospheres of these irradiated egps .",
    "this is particularly true for tres-1 and hd 209458b . though we will not dwell in this paper on metallicity , we find that the metallicity dependence of the secondary - eclipse fluxes is not strong , but that it is in principle measurable , and that the metallicity dependence of the variation of the planetary flux with phase is only modest .",
    "importantly , we also conclude that upper - atmosphere absorption in the optical by an as - yet unknown molecule , and the concommitent thermal inversions and stratospheres , provide better fits to some of the data .    in  [ tech ]",
    ", we describe our numerical techniques , the new heat redistribution model , and how we generate stratospheres .",
    "this section is supported with appendices  [ redist ] ,  [ app2 ] ,  [ app3 ] , and  [ app5 ] , in which we provide details concerning the heat redistribution model and derive some analytic formulae concerning atmospheric physics with day - night coupling . in particular , in  [ app5 ]",
    ", we address the enhancement at secondary eclipse in the integrated planetary flux at earth over and above what would be expected if the planet emitted isotropically . for a radar antenna",
    ", this would be its  gain \" factor . in ",
    "[ tp ] , we discuss the derived temperature - pressure profiles on the day and the night sides for all six egps highlighted in this investigation . we show that the @xmath10 decoupling layers for the _ spitzer _ irac and mips ( 24-@xmath8 m ) band fluxes are all above the isothermal region of an irradiated egp s atmosphere and , hence , that _",
    "spitzer _ does not probe these deeper regions .",
    "for the same reasons , we find that the presence of a thermal inversion at altitude and of a stratosphere in some egp atmospheres can significantly alter these _ spitzer _ fluxes and their relative strengths . in  [ tp ] , we also provide representative planet spectra to demonstrate that most of the planet s flux emerges at shorter wavelengths than are accessible to _ spitzer _ , and , hence , that _",
    "spitzer _ probes only a small tail of the emergent flux distribution .",
    "this may be of relevance when jwst is available to follow up on the _ spitzer _ egp data and , even earlier , as the jwst exoplanet campaign is being designed .    in  [ planetstar ] , we present the best - fit planet - star contrast ratios at secondary eclipse for four of the transiting egps for which these have been measured ( all but gj 436b , for which see deming et al .",
    "2007 and demory et al . 2007 ) , as well as various comparison models to gauge a few parameter dependences . then",
    ", in  [ curves ] we match our theoretical phase light curves with the three measured light curves and derive approximate planetary parameters .",
    "the paper is brought to a close in  [ conclusions ] with a synopsis of our results and a general discussion of the issues raised .",
    "our model atmospheres are computed using the updated code cooltlusty , described in sudarsky , burrows , & hubeny ( 2003 ) , hubeny , burrows , & sudarsky ( 2003 ) , and burrows , sudarsky , & hubeny ( 2006 ) , which is a variant of the universal spectrum / atmosphere code tlusty ( hubeny 1988 ; hubeny & lanz 1995 ) .",
    "the molecular and atomic opacities are taken from sharp & burrows ( 2007 ) and the chemical abundances , which include condensate rainout , are derived using the thermochemical model of burrows & sharp ( 1999 ) , updated as described in sharp & burrows ( 2007 ) and in burrows et al .",
    "( 2001 ) .    to handle convection",
    ", we use standard mixing - length theory , with a mixing length equal to the pressure scale height .",
    "the stellar irradiation boundary condition is numerically challenging , and has not been done properly by some workers in the past .",
    "to ensure an accurate numerical solution with a non - zero incoming specific intensity , we use the formalism discussed in hubeny , burrows , & sudarsky ( 2003 ) .",
    "the stellar spectral models are taken from kurucz ( 1994 ) for the six stars listed in table [ t2 ] that are the primaries of the egps upon which we focus in this paper . the day and night",
    "sides are approached differently , with the nightside , quite naturally , experiencing no incident flux , but receiving heat from the irradiated dayside using the new algorithm described in appendix  [ redist ] .",
    "an important additional feature of our new heat redistribution formalism is the capacity to match both the entropy and the gravity at the base of both the day- and the night - side atmospheres . since the inner convective zone , which constitutes most of the planet , is isentropic , this is the physically correct procedure . for a dayside calculation",
    ", we can assume a given interior flux effective temperature , @xmath11 ( a standard number could be 75 k ) . for a given gravity and irradiation regime ,",
    "this leads to an atmosphere solution on the dayside .",
    "this solution incorporates an entropy in the convective zone . for the nightside atmosphere",
    ", we can adjust the nightside @xmath11 until the entropy in its convective interior matches that found in the dayside convective zone .",
    "one product of this procedure is a connection between dayside and nightside @xmath11 that has a bearing on overall planet cooling and shrinkage ( burrows et al .",
    "however , since for a given measured planet radius , this mapping does not have a significant effect on the close - in planet s spectrum , we do this here only approximately and leave to a later paper a general discussion of this topic .",
    "the simple parametrization we use to simulate the effects of an extra stratospheric absorber entails placing an absorber with constant opacity , @xmath12 , in the optical frequency range @xmath13 = ( @xmath14 hz , @xmath15 hz ) and high up at altitude , where the pressure is below a prescribed value , generally take to be 0.03 bars . hence , @xmath12 is the most important parameter to be adjusted .",
    "we could easily introduce a specified frequency and/or depth dependence , but this would add free parameters which we feel are not justified at this stage .",
    "we have also generated models in which tio and vo are allowed to assume their chemical - equilibrium upper - atmosphere abundances ( sharp & burrows 2007 ) , uncorrected for the cold - trap effect (  [ conclusions ] ; burrows et al .",
    "2007b ) , and to generate a stratosphere .",
    "these tio / vo models produce qualitatively the same effects as do our ad hoc models .",
    "however , in this paper we prefer the flexibility of the @xmath12 prescription .    in burrows et al .",
    "( 2006 ) , once the day- and night - side atmospheres were calculated , we used a 2d radiative transfer code to determine the integrated emissions  at infinity \" at a given viewing angle from the planet - star axis for the day- and night - side hemispheres .",
    "these numbers were then transformed into a light curve as a function of wavelength and planetary phase angle using the methods described in sudarsky et al .",
    "( 2000 , 2005 ) .",
    "however , we have found that since the detailed shape of the light curve connecting the day- and the night - side fluxes is likely to be only poorly constrained for the foreseeable future and since our model is symmetric about secondary eclipse , it is inappropriate to invest a disproportionate amount of effort in performing expensive 2d transfer calculations .",
    "rather , we invest our efforts in obtaining state - of - the - art day- and the night - side fluxes at secondary and primary eclipse and then connect them with a simple , though well - motivated , curve .",
    "therefore , our light curve model is : @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the planet / star flux ratio , @xmath18 is the dayside flux ( see fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] ) , @xmath19 is the nightside flux , @xmath20 is the phase angle , and @xmath21 is the inclination angle ( @xmath22 if in transit ) .",
    "this is the form adopted in cowan et al .",
    "( 2007 ) . using this simpler approach",
    ", one does not imply more precision than is warranted at this preliminary stage of inquiry .",
    "we have revisited the question of what type of averaging of the incoming radiation from the star over the surface of the planet is best suited to describe the planetary spectrum close to the secondary eclipse .",
    "we had demonstrated earlier ( sudarsky et al . 2005 ) that detailed 2d phase - dependent spectra averaged over the phase are equal , within a few percent , to the spectrum computed for a representative model atmosphere that is constructed assuming that the incoming flux is distributed evenly over the surface of the dayside . in the usual terminology , this corresponds to the flux distribution factor @xmath23 ( burrows et al .",
    "2000 ) . ] .    however , the spectrum of a planet observed close to the secondary eclipse should be biased toward a higher flux than that obtained using the @xmath23 model .",
    "this is because the hottest part of the planet , the substellar point , is seen as emerging from the planet perpendicularly to the surface , and , thus , with the lowest amount of limb darkening .",
    "therefore , the contribution of the hottest part of the planet is maximized . to study this effect ,",
    "we have computed a series of model atmospheres corresponding to a number of distances from the substellar point , and have integrated the individual contributions to get the flux received by an external observer at a phase close to superior conjunction .",
    "it turns out that the flux is very close to that computed for @xmath24 , which is the value we subsequently use in all simulations presented here .",
    "there is a simple analytic argument why @xmath25 should be approximately equal to @xmath26 which we present in appendix ",
    "[ app5 ] .",
    "the formalism for @xmath18 and @xmath19 is the best we have fielded to date .",
    "nevertheless , a 3d general circulation model ( gcm ) that incorporates state - of - the - art opacities , compositions , and radiative transfer will be needed to properly address day - night heat redistribution , the vortical and zonal mass motions , and the positions of the hot and cold spots .",
    "such a model is not yet within reach , but there have been preliminary attempts to treat this physics ( showman & guillot 2002 ; cho et al .",
    "2003 ; menou 2003 ; williams et al .",
    "2006 ; cooper & showman 2005 ; lunine & lorenz 2002 ) . the proper gcm physics remains the major uncertainty in current planetary secondary eclipse and light - curve modeling .",
    "we have used the techniques outlined in  [ tech ] and in appendix  [ redist ] and the data in tables [ t1 ] and [ t2 ] to create models of six of the close - in egps in table [ t3 ] for which there are _ spitzer _ secondary eclipse or phase light curve data .",
    "these planets are hd 209458b , hd 189733b , tres-1 , hd 179949b , hd 149026b , and @xmath0 and b. the product of our investigation is an extensive collection of atmosphere models , with associated spectra , for many combinations of planet , p@xmath1 , metallicity , and values of @xmath28/@xmath29 (  [ redist ] ) .",
    "we have , however , settled on presenting in this paper only the central and essential results for each planet , in the knowledge that the data are not yet exquisitely constraining .",
    "we focus on models with solar - metallicity ( asplund , grevesse , & sauval 2006 ) opacities , ( @xmath30 ) = ( 0.05 , 0.5 ) bars , and an interior flux @xmath11 of 75 k. these are our baseline model parameters . for a given measured planet radius ,",
    "the dependence of the models on @xmath11 is extremely weak .",
    "we find that the specific pressure range ( @xmath30 ) in which most of the heat carried from the dayside to the nightside is conveyed plays a role in the planet - star flux ratios , but a subtle one .",
    "therefore , in lieu of a comprehensive , and credible , 3d climate model , we prefer not to claim too much concerning the details of atmospheric circulation and heat redistribution .",
    "we also explore the effects of a stratospheric absorber with an optical opacity of @xmath12 ( see also burrows et al .",
    "we find that such models will be most important for close - in egps with the greatest stellar insolation and guided by this principle , particularly relevant for hd 209458b , hd 149026b , and @xmath0 and b , we explore the consequences .",
    "figure [ fig1 ] portrays in six panels the temperature - pressure ( @xmath31 ) profiles of a representative collection of dayside and nightside models of the six close - in egps of this study . for the dayside",
    ", the different curves correspond to different values of p@xmath1 from 0.0 ( no redistribution ) to 0.5 ( full redistribution ) and to models with and without stratospheric absorbers . for the nightside , p@xmath1 ranges from 0.1 to 0.5 .",
    "for all models , the radiative - convective boundaries are identified and are quite deep ( on the far right of each panel ) . when @xmath32 , the @xmath31 profiles show distinct thermal inversions .",
    "there are quite a few generic features in evidence on these panels .",
    "the first is that the atmospheres are never isothermal .",
    "since the opacities in the optical , where most of the stellar irradiation occurs , and in the infrared , where most of the reradiation occurs , are very different , a quasi - isothermal inner region interior to @xmath21 bar is always bounded by an outer region in which the temperature decreases ( hubeny , burrows , & sudarsky 2003 ) . as fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] indicates , the magnitude of the temperature decrease from the plateau to the @xmath210@xmath33 bar level for dayside models without stratospheres is @xmath21000 k. with a stratosphere , the outward increase from a pressure of @xmath20.1 bars can be correspondingly large . for our nightside models ,",
    "the monotonic decrease is @xmath2500@xmath271000 k. models with temperature inversions due to a strong absorber at altitude clearly stand out in the panels of fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] and may result from the presence of a trace species , tio / vo , or a non - equilibrium species ( burrows et al .",
    "the possible effect of such upper - atmosphere absorbers on the @xmath31 profiles and the resultant dayside spectra are exciting new features of the emerging theory of irradiated egps .",
    "the discussion above is made more germane when we note that the decoupling surfaces for the irac and mips ( 24-@xmath8 m ) channels , the effective photospheres where @xmath34 , are all in the outer zone .",
    "figure [ fig1 ] indicates their positions for the dayside p@xmath35 model of tres-1 .",
    "they are at similar pressures for all other models .",
    "the photospheres for shorter wavelengths not accessible to _ spitzer _ are deeper in .",
    "figure [ fig2 ] portrays these  formation , \"  brightness , \" or photospheric temperatures as a function of wavelength for three models of tres-1 with different values of p@xmath1 , and for both the dayside and nightside , and illustrates this fact .",
    "the approximate wavelength intervals of the _ spitzer _ bands are superposed .",
    "though the irac 1 flux can decouple at interesting depths , the photospheres for the @xmath36 , @xmath37 , @xmath38 , and @xmath39 bands are generally deeper .",
    "the photospheres in the far - ir beyond @xmath210 @xmath8 m are high up at altitude and we repeat that _ spitzer _ photometry does not probe the isothermal region so characteristic of theoretical close - in egp atmospheres . moreover , since the _ spitzer _ observations are probing the outer regions of the atmosphere most affected by stellar irradiation and which can have inversions , the treatment of the outer boundary condition due to incoming stellar flux must be accurate .",
    "slight errors or uncertainties in the outer boundary condition of the transfer solution , or in the upper - atmosphere opacities , can translate into significant errors in the predicted _ spitzer _ fluxes .",
    "this is particularly true longward of @xmath210 @xmath8 m . as a result , measured",
    "fluxes in both the near - ir and mid - ir are useful diagnostics of upper - atmosphere absorbers and thermal inversions ( hubeny , burrows , & sudarsky 2003 ; burrows et al .",
    "2006 ; burrows et al . 2007b ; knutson et al .",
    "all these caveats and points must be borne in mind when interpreting the _ spitzer _ egp data .    as a prelude to our discussions in  [ planetstar ] and  [ curves ] of the _ spitzer _ planet - star flux ratios at secondary eclipse and during an orbital traverse , and to emphasize the fact that _",
    "spitzer _ does not comprehensively probe the irradiated planet s atmosphere , we plot in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] theoretical dayside spectra ( @xmath40f@xmath41 versus log@xmath42(@xmath40 ) ) for three models of tres-1 at zero phase angle ( superior conjunction ) .",
    "superposed on the plot are the positions of the near - ir , irac , and mips bands .",
    "such a figure allows one to determine at a glance the wavelengths at which most of the flux is radiated ( at least , theoretically ) . as fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] suggests , most of the planet s flux emerges in the near - ir , not in the irac or mips channels .",
    "in fact , depending on the planet , no more than one fifth to one third of the planet s flux comes out longward of @xmath23.6 @xmath8 m ( irac 1 ) , while no more than one twentieth to one tenth emerges longward of @xmath26.5 @xmath8 m , the  left \" edge of the irac 4 channel . since much of the best egp data have been derived in irac channel 4 , one must acknowledge that they may represent very little of the total planetary emissions .",
    "finally , we call the reader s attention to the slight bumps ( on the nightside ) and depressions ( on the dayside ) between 0.05 and 1.0 bars in the @xmath31 profiles depicted in fig .",
    "this region is near where we imposed heat redistribution using the formalism described in  [ redist ] .",
    "the actual shapes of these profiles are determined by this mathematical procedure and other algorithms will produce different local thermal profiles .",
    "note that with this formalism it is possible at the higher p@xmath1s ( @xmath43 ) for the nightside to be hotter than the dayside at the same pressure levels in the redistribution region . while this may seem at odds with thermodynamics , what is essential is that energy is conserved and is redistributed at optical depths that are not either too low or too high .",
    "if the former , the absorbed stellar heat would be reradiated before it can be carried to the nightside .",
    "if the latter , then the stellar radiation can not penetrate to the conveyor belt .",
    "for our default choice of @xmath28 and @xmath29 , @xmath44 is generally between @xmath20.3 and @xmath26 .",
    "these depths are not unreasonable , but our redistribution algorithm is clearly only a stopgap until a better gcm can be developed and justified .",
    "we discuss below and in turn model fits for each transiting egp at secondary eclipse . however , first we present our results collectively and in summary fashion . figure [ fig4 ] in four panels portrays for the four transiting egps the correspondence between the secondary eclipse data and representative models of the planet - star flux ratio as a function of wavelength from 1.5 @xmath8 m to 30 @xmath8 m",
    ". this figure summarizes our major results .",
    "the models are for values of p@xmath1 of 0.1 , 0.3 , and 0.5 and various values of @xmath12 .",
    "the data include 1-@xmath45 error bars and can be found in table [ t3 ] . as fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] indicates , we can fit all the published data .",
    "the p@xmath1 dependence for both stratospheric models and models without inversions is strongest in the @xmath39 band and in irac 1 .",
    "in fact , in the near - ir , models with inversions depend very strongly on p@xmath1 .",
    "[ fig5 ] for hd 209458b in the near - ir indicates this most clearly .",
    "this finding implies that measurements at these shorter ir wavelengths are good diagnostics of p@xmath1 , particularly if inversions are present .",
    "importantly , including a non - zero @xmath12 and generating a stratosphere results in a pronounced enhancement longward of irac 1 , particularly in irac 2 and 3 , but also at mips/24 @xmath8 m and at the 16-@xmath8 m peak - up point of _ spitzer_/irs .",
    "hence , fluxes at the longer ir wavelengths might be good diagnostics of thermal inversions .",
    "the models in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] for hd 209458b and hd 149026b demonstrate this feature best .",
    "no attempt has been made to achieve refined fits , but the correspondence between theory and measurement , while not perfect , is rather good for all the planets . moreover , different egps seem to call for different values of p@xmath1 and @xmath12 , and , hence , perhaps , different climates , degrees of heat redistribution , compositions , and upper - atmospheric physics .",
    "the light - curve analyses in  [ curves ] also suggest this . a goal is to relate these measured differences with the physical properties of the star and planet and",

    "2005 ; barman , hauschildt , & allard 2005 ; seager et al .",
    "2005 ; burrows et al . 2006 ) is consistent with the models with an extra upper - atmosphere absorber in the optical , particularly for higher values of p@xmath1 .",
    "this is more clearly seen in fig .",

    "( 2007c ) points .",

    "richardson et al . (",
    "2007 ) also suggest that the flatness and extension of their data to shorter wavelengths implies the near absence of water , since previous theoretical models predicted a spectral trough between @xmath24 @xmath8 m and @xmath28 @xmath8 m .",
    "however , if there is an outer thermal inversion , as we here and in burrows et al ( 2007b ) argue is the case for hd 209458b , a trough is flipped into a peak for the same water abundance .",
    "this renders moot the use of the spectral slope at the edge of the irs spectrum to determine the presence or absence of water .",
    "one of our major conclusions , implicit in figs .",
    "[ fig4 ] and [ fig5 ] , is that water is not depleted at all in the atmosphere of hd 209458b .",
    "the recent controversies surrounding such an interpretation occasion the following remarks .",
    "one thing to bear in mind concerning the use of these irs spectra to infer compositions is that they are very low resolution .",
    "the use of classical astronomical spectroscopy to identify constituents stems from the ability at much higher resolution to see characteristic features at precise wavelengths and patterns of absorption or emission lines to high accuracy .",
    "this allows one to make element and molecule identifications in a narrow wavelength range without a global view across the whole spectrum .",
    "however , at the low resolution of the irs , no individual water features are accessible",
    ". there are water features near @xmath210 @xmath8 m , but they would require a @xmath49 is excess of @xmath22000 to identify . otherwise , all one sees is the collective effect of millions of lines and the resulting pseudo - continuum ( the band structure ) . clearly , when the data are low - resolution , a _ global _ photometric and spectral fit is necessary to address the issue of composition .",
    "the signature of water s presence comes from the goodness of the global fit across the entire spectrum from the optical to the mid - ir .",
    "the good fit we obtain in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] , lead us to conclude that the irs , irac 4 , and mips data for hd 209458b are consistent with the presence of water in abundance .",
    "note that if the @xmath31 profile were entirely flat ( but see fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) , whatever the opacity and molecular abundances the emergent spectrum would be a perfect black body and would give no hint concerning composition .",
    "transit spectra would then be our only reliable means of determining atmospheric composition ( fortney et al .",

    "we have derived constraints on their atmospheric properties .",
    "we find , as did burrows et al .",
    "( 2007b ) , that many severely irradiated egps can have thermal inversions at altitude which translate into qualitative changes in 1 ) the planet / star contrast ratios at secondary eclipse , 2 ) their wavelength dependences , and 3 ) day - night flux contrasts during a planetary orbit .",

    "the upper - atmosphere absorber that is producing stratospheres for the higher values of f@xmath51 might indeed be tio / vo , but a  cold - trap \" effect can operate to deplete the upper atmosphere of tio / vo .",
    "however , when mass loss is ongoing , as we know to be the case for hd 209458b ( vidal - madjar et al .",
    "2003,2004 ) , the atmosphere is constantly being replenished and tio / vo at some non - zero abundance remains a viable option .",
    "such vigorous mass loss is expected for those planets with the highest values of f@xmath51 , and in this paper we have discovered a possible correlation between f@xmath51 and the existence of thermal inversions and stratospheres .",
    "hence , the possible mass - loss / stratosphere connection may make for a compelling scientific narrative",

    "given the stellar uv and integral - flux regimes experienced by strongly - irradiated egps , such species might be photolytically produced with sufficient abundance ( burrows et al . 2007b ; marley et al .",

    "using all the above approximations , we obtain for the region between @xmath166 and @xmath167 : @xmath168 since @xmath167 is typically larger than 1 , we neglect the term @xmath169 compared to @xmath170 .",
    "this is not necessary for the formal development , but it simplifies the resulting expressions . the derivative @xmath171 ; therefore , the local minimum of @xmath172 is at @xmath173 .",
    "since the most interesting case is for strong irradiation where @xmath149 , we see that the minimum of @xmath174 is close to @xmath167 .",
    "the value of @xmath172 at the local minimum is @xmath175 the condition for the existence of the solution is that @xmath176 , and , thus , @xmath177 taking the most interesting case of strong irradiation , we can neglect the second factor , and write simply @xmath178 an analogous analysis for model 2 gives a similar condition , @xmath179 for instance , this demonstrates that for @xmath180 , the case with the maximum energy sink on the dayside and the maximum degree of redistribution , the deeper ( high - pressure ) limit of the sink region must be at optical depths less than 8 .",
    "[ result ] indicates that this limit is larger for smaller @xmath165 ( e.g. , it is 40 for @xmath181 ) .",
    "hence , we have derived consistency conditions for our redistribution algorithm that have physical content and in our choices for @xmath28 and @xmath29 , we are careful not to exceed this condition .",
    "our default values of @xmath28 and @xmath29 , 0.05 and 0.5 bars , respectively , translate into an optical depth range of a few@xmath600.1 to @xmath2a few , within the consistency constraints for all the p@xmath1s .",
    "indeed , if we were to exceed the consistency constraints in our atmosphere calculations , they would not converge and the simulations would crash numerically .",
    "to derive the proper @xmath25 factor , we now expand upon the formalism of appendix  [ redist ] . the total energy flux received by a unit area on the planetary surface at angle @xmath183 from the substellar point",
    "is given by @xmath184 where @xmath185 and @xmath183 is the angle between the normal to the planetary surface and the direction toward the star .",
    "for simplicity , we assume that the angular diameter of the star is small",
    ". consequently , all rays coming from the star are parallel . @xmath186 and @xmath187 is the radiation flux at the surface of the star .",
    "the average flux received by the planet is then @xmath188 which explains the origin of the @xmath23 ansatz .    to improve upon this",
    ", we assume the eddington approximation , @xmath189 , and ignore convection , which allows us to write down an analytic solution of eq .",
    "( b4 ) for @xmath37 : @xmath190 where @xmath191 is the interior planetary flux . to obtain the constant @xmath192",
    ", we employ the formal solution of the transfer equation for the specific intensity : @xmath193 since the source function , @xmath194 , is given by @xmath195 . as shown by hubeny et el .",
    "( 2003 ) , @xmath196 can differ significantly from unity , but only for low values of the flux - mean optical depth , @xmath197 . therefore , we set @xmath198 , and , using eq .",
    "( [ jeq ] ) , we integrate eq .",
    "( [ ifor ] ) to obtain @xmath199 which is the well - known eddington - barbier relation .",
    "the mean intensity on the planetary surface is given by @xmath200 where @xmath201 because we have assumed all incident rays from the star are parallel .",
    "@xmath202 is the dirac @xmath203-function .",
    "therefore , @xmath204 and , consequently @xmath205 the specific intensity is then given by @xmath206 where we have given the explicit dependence of the emergent specific intensity on @xmath207 .",
    "for close - in planets , the irradiation flux is much larger than the intrinsic flux , @xmath191 , so we neglect the second term . the local atmosphere characterized by angle @xmath207 exhibits , within the present approximations , an essentially isotropic emergent radiation pattern , independent of the local polar angle @xmath8 and dependent only on the angular distance from the substellar point , @xmath207 . for the total planetary flux close to secondary eclipse received by a observer at a distance @xmath18 , we have the expression @xmath208 for an average atmosphere characterized by the parameter , @xmath25 , the external flux is given by eq .",
    "( [ fav ] ) , where we replace @xmath209 by @xmath25 .",
    "we obtain @xmath210 and , therefore , @xmath211 in order to get agreement between eqs .",
    "( [ fobs1 ] ) and ( [ fobs2 ] ) , we have to set @xmath24 .",

    "<S> we present theoretical atmosphere , spectral , and light - curve models for extrasolar giant planets ( egps ) undergoing strong irradiation for which _ spitzer _ planet / star contrast ratios or light curves have been published ( circa june 2007 ) . </S>",

    "<S> this is particularly true for hd 209458b , hd 149026b , and @xmath0 and b. this finding translates into qualitative changes in the planet / star contrast ratios at secondary eclipse and in close - in egp orbital light curves . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , the presence of atmospheric water in abundance is fully consistent with all the _ spitzer _ data for the measured planets . for planets with stratospheres , </S>",
    "<S> water absorption features invert into emission features and mid - infrared fluxes can be enhanced by a factor of two . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , the character of near - infrared planetary spectra can be radically altered . </S>",
    "<S> we derive a correlation between the importance of such stratospheres and the stellar flux on the planet , suggesting that close - in egps bifurcate into two groups : those with and without stratospheres . from the finding that tres-1 shows no signs of a stratosphere , </S>",
    "<S> while hd 209458b does , we estimate the magnitude of this stellar flux breakpoint . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the heat redistribution parameter , p@xmath1 , for the family of close - in egps assumes values from @xmath20.1 to @xmath20.4 . </S>",
    "<S> this paper provides a broad theoretical context for the future direct characterization of egps in tight orbits around their illuminating stars . </S>"
