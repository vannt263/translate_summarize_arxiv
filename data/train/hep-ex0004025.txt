    "both the experimental and the theoretical baryon spectroscopy is under steady progress in recent years .",
    "the study of photo- and electro - production of nonstrange resonances was started by elsa ( bonn ) and clas ( cebaf ) experiments . as a result of the development of the chiral perturbation theory ( chpt ) dynamically generated resonances in the isospin channels 0(@xmath3 ) and @xmath4(@xmath5 )",
    "were predicted as a consequence of the existence of quasi - bound @xmath6 and @xmath7 states  @xcite .",
    "method of amplitude speed plots was developed @xcite for resonance parameter studies .",
    "nevertheless a number of important questions of the baryon spectroscopy is still waiting for their solutions . among them",
    "is the existence of clusters of baryon resonances , low energy of two - phonon excitation ( for instance @xmath8 ) , the problem of `` missing '' resonances in the second resonance region , the role played by the gluonic degrees of freedom at low energies .    partial wave analysis ( pwa ) is one of the most powerful instruments in the baryon spectroscopy .",
    "but it is still not free from ambiguities caused by the incomplete experimental database .",
    "especially poor is the knowledge on spin rotation parameters @xmath0 and @xmath9 in the region of incident particle momenta above 0.75  gev / c .",
    "predictions of these parameters made by different pwa contradict with each other in a number of kinematic regions .",
    "the single measurement in this region fulfilled by the itep - pnpi collaboration @xcite contradict with predictions of * kh80 * @xcite and * cmb * @xcite and agree with that of * sm90 * @xcite .",
    "the analysis of the data by the method of transverse amplitude zeroes @xcite show that the disagreement with * kh80 * and * cmb * could be attributed to the discrete ambiguity of barrelet - type .",
    "absence of the data on spin rotation parameters at the time when these analyses were performed did nt allow their authors to choose the correct branch of the solution .",
    "it was shown that proper amplitude correction results in a good agreement between the predictions of * kh80 * and * cmb * and the experimental data , but the parameters of 6 resonances with isospin @xmath10 and masses near 1.9  gev / c@xmath11 are significantly changed @xcite .",
    "this experiment was aimed at several goals : ( i ) to obtain new experimental data for unambiguous reconstruction of @xmath12-elastic amplitudes in the range of @xmath13@xmath14 , where the largest disagreement between predictions of the existing pwa s is observed ; ( ii ) to confirm the choice of the transverse amplitude zero trajectory ( solution branch ) done in our previous analysis @xcite ; ( iii ) to test pwa predictions on spin rotation parameters in @xmath15-elastic scattering .",
    "spin rotation parameter @xmath0 is measured in the elastic scattering on the longitudinally - polarized proton target as a component of the recoiled proton polarization perpendicular to its momentum and laying in the scattering plane .",
    "this component is determined by the secondary scattering of the recoiled protons on the carbon filter .",
    "the apparatus is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : setup ] .",
    "its basic elements are : ( i ) polarized proton target ( p ) @xcite ; ( ii ) carbon filter ( c ) ; ( iii ) four sets of multiwire magnetostrictive spark chambers to detect the incident beam ( msc1msc6 ) , the scattered pion ( msc7msc12 ) and the recoiled proton before ( msc13msc16 ) and after ( msc17msc21 ) the second scattering and ( iv ) a number of scintillation counters ( c1-c10 ) to provide the trigger and to identify the positive pions in the beam by the time of flight . a container filled with the target material ( propanediole @xmath16 doped by @xmath17 complexes )",
    "is placed into magnetic field of 2.5  t created by a helmholtz pair of superconductive coils .",
    "the container has a cylindrical form with vertical size and diameter of 30  mm  @xmath18  30  mm .",
    "cooling of the target downto 0.5  k is provided by an evaporation - type @xmath19he cryostat .",
    "the polarization is pumped by the dynamic nuclear orientation method up to the absolute value of 70 - 80  % with the measurement uncertainty 2  % .",
    "the two sets of chambers with the 36.5  g / cm@xmath11 thick carbon filter in between form the polarimeter .",
    "the analyzing power of this polarimeter was measured in advance at the polarized proton beam of the itep accelerator @xcite .",
    "the false asymmetry in the polarimeter was also measured with a pion beam and appeared to be @xmath21 .",
    "this paper presents the results of two runs at the itep accelerator . during the first run @xmath22 triggers with @xmath23 beam",
    "were obtained while the second one gave @xmath24 triggers from @xmath25 beam .",
    "r0.5    the processing of the data was performed in several steps :    * events of the elastic @xmath26 scattering on the polarized target were selected by coplanarity and pion - proton angular correlation .",
    "@xmath27 was calculated for each event , where @xmath28 and @xmath29 are deviations from the elastic kinematics in azimuthal and polar angles and @xmath30 and @xmath31 are the rms of the corresponding distributions obtained from monte carlo simulation .",
    "@xmath32 distributions of the data taken on the polarized target and on a carbon target normalized at @xmath33 are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : chi2]a . the distribution from the carbon target representing the pure quasielastic background can be approximated with a straight line .",
    "the distribution of elastic events with subtracted background follows @xmath32 distribution with 2 degrees of freedom ( fig .",
    "[ fig : chi2]b ) .",
    "the selection criteria @xmath34 corresponds to 6% background and 85% good events after the cut",
    ". the normal polarization of the quasielastic background was taken 0.7 of that for the elastic scattering @xcite .",
    "for every event a @xmath35 matrix was calculated , describing recoiled proton spin rotation in the magnetic field of the setup along its trajectory from the vertex of the first scattering to the point of the rescattering on the carbon nucleus . * single track events with polar angle of the second scattering @xmath36 were selected in the polarimeter . from them only those events were taken for which all the azimuthal angles are allowed by the chambers geometry .",
    "the average analyzing power for selected events is 0.191 .",
    "more details on data processing in the polarimeter can be found in @xcite .",
    "after this selection 16686 events of elastic @xmath12 scattering and 4708 events of @xmath15 scattering were left for further processing . * the method of maximum likelihood was used to get the polarization parameters from the data .",
    "the probability density was built only as a function of parameters @xmath0 and @xmath37 , while the parameter @xmath9 was calculated from the equation : @xmath38 .",
    "the result of the fit practically does not depend on the assumption over the sign of @xmath9 .",
    "the likelihood function accounts for : the target polarization , the quasielastic background and its polarization , the analyzing power of the polarimeter and the rotation of the proton spin in the magnetic field between the first and the second scattering .",
