    "microswimmers , by virtue of their size , typically have reynolds numbers @xmath2 .",

    "these are time independent and therefore , as first recognised by @xcite , any swimming stroke that leads to motion at re=0 must be non - invariant under time reversal .",
    "swimming strategies evolved by microorganisms to overcome this restriction include waving flagella and rotating helical filaments .",
    "bacteria , algae and other microorganisms usually live in complex fluids , sharing their environment with a myriad of inert particles such as colloids and biofilaments . as they swim , the flow fields they produce stir the surrounding fluid , leading to the enhanced tracer diffusion observed in swimmer suspensions @xcite , and predicted by simulations and using theoretical arguments @xcite .",
    "bacterial stirring is thought to be an important factor in controlling and enhancing nutrient uptake .",
    "moreover , but still controversially , it has been suggested that stirring by small swimmers could provide a significant contribution to oceanic mixing @xcite .    however , experimental trajectories of tracers in a suspension of swimmers often look loop - like @xcite , with the net displacement between the initial and final locations considerably shorter than the characteristic trajectory size , fig .",

    "indeed , it has been shown that tracers advected by a passing swimmer follow closed trajectories when the swimmer , modelled as a viscous dipole or quadrupole , travels along a straight , infinite path @xcite .",
    "this loop - like nature of the swimmer paths was found , on the average , to survive the smearing effect of brownian fluctuations",
    ".    clearly , closedness of tracer trajectories severely limits the effectiveness of stirring , yet microswimmers enhance tracer diffusion .",

    "examine the tracer trajectories , identifying the properties of the flow field and the necessary assumptions and conditions that lead to loops .",
    "in particular we find that the trajectories are not closed for tracers near to the swimmer .",
    "such particles are entrained by the swimmer , following it over a distance that diverges for a head - on collision .",
    "loops are also destroyed by finite swimmer paths , and by the flow field appropriate to swimming in two dimensions .    in the remainder of the paper we focus on investigating entrainment in detail . to do this",
    "we calculate the darwin drift , the volume of fluid moved by a swimmer as it travels along an infinite straight path @xcite .",
    "we find that although this quantity is infinite for a colloid pulled through a viscous fluid @xcite , it is finite for a swimmer .",
    "moreover it can be written as the sum of a universal term , which depends only on the quadrupole flow produced by the swimmer , and a non - universal contribution equal to the volume of fluid in the swimmer wake .",

    "this physical requirement imposes a strong restriction on its velocity field . in particular , the stokeslet term of the multipolar expansion must vanish and the velocity far from the swimmer is generally dominated by the force dipole flow :    @xmath11    where @xmath12 is the stokeslet , the gradient operator @xmath13 acts on the first argument of @xmath12 , and @xmath14 is the dipole strength .",
    "the sign of @xmath14 distinguishes the far - field of pushers ( such as _ e. coli _ ) , @xmath15 , from that of the pullers ( such as _ c. reinhardtii _ ) , @xmath16 .",
    "( note that @xmath14 needs to be multiplied by the prefactor @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is the kinematic fluid viscosity , in order to have units of a force dipole . )",
    "the stokeslet can be expressed via the oseen tensor @xmath19 : @xmath20 here @xmath21 and @xmath22 is the identity matrix .",
    "thus , the dipolar flow field @xmath23 decays at large distances as @xmath24 .",
    "note that the expression ( [ eq : dipole ] ) is considerably more restrictive than the general definition of the force dipole ( also commonly referred to as stresslet and stokeslet doublet ) @xcite .",
    "the strength of the general force dipole is a symmetric second order tensor and it may have six independent components . however , it is physically reasonable to expect that the lines of action of the resultant thrust and drag forces coincide and are aligned with the direction of swimming @xmath5 .",
    "these conditions reduce the number of independent components from six to one .    under this assumption the quadrupolar terms of the multipole expansion for an axisymmetric swimmer",
    "can be written @xmath25 where @xmath26 and @xmath26 are the force quadrupole strengths along and perpendicular to the swimming direction respectively and @xmath27 is the laplace operator in the plane normal to the swimming direction . in the particular case of @xmath28 , @xmath29 a spherical body or a spherical droplet passively towed in viscous fluid has the quadrupole term of the same form @xcite .",
    "remarkably , the flow field of a spherical particle moving in _ inviscid _ fluid also has the same form .",
    "indeed , the expression to the right from the identity sign in ( [ eq : quadsym ] ) is but a potential dipole @xcite .",
    "it is essential for our further argument that the quadrupole term ( [ e : quadrupole ] ) , similarly to the dipole term ( [ eq : dipole ] ) , can be expressed as a derivative along the swimming direction .",
    "indeed , @xmath30 hence a general flow field produced by a swimmer takes the form @xmath31    we are now in a position to see that closedness of tracer trajectories is a universal feature rooted in the expression ( [ eq : gradgen ] ) .",
    "consider the velocity @xmath32 at the tracer location .",
    "its lagrangian derivative is @xmath33 when the tracer velocity is negligible in comparison to the swimmer velocity , @xmath34 , the lagrangian derivative coincides with the eulerian derivative : @xmath35 combining this expression with eqns .",
    "( [ eq : tracer ] ) and ( [ eq : gradgen ] ) , results in : @xmath36 therefore , the overall displacement of the tracer as the swimmer travels along the infinite path equals : @xmath37 i.e. the tracer trajectory is closed .    besides translating",
    ", some swimmers , such as bacteria , often rotate around their bodies .",
    "but since typically the rotation axis coincides with the swimming direction , the induced azimuthal flow causes mixing only in the azimuthal direction .",
    "our interest is in the cylindrically symmetrical transport and hence we have disregarded the azimuthal component of the flow .",
    "the validity of the representation ( [ eq : dipole ] ) was verified in recent experiments for _ e. coli _ in @xcite and for _ c. reinhardtii _ in @xcite .",
    "the assumptions inherent in proving that the tracer loops are closed can be summarised as follows : +   + 1 ) the ( induced ) tracer velocity is much smaller than the swimmer velocity .",

    "the character of such violations may serve as basis for systematic analysis of different mechanisms of biomixing , and we list examples in table [ tab ] . in the remainder of this paper we provide a detailed analysis of situations where the first assumption is violated , and the tracer velocity is no longer small compared to that of the swimmer .",
    "this occurs for tracer particles that happen to lie in the vicinity of a swimmer path .",
    "their motion can be understood as entrainment of the neighbouring fluid by a swimmer .",

    "the fluid flow near a swimmer is determined by the swimmer shape and gait . consequently ,",
    "important physical quantities , such as the dissipated energy or the ability to stir the surrounding fluid may strongly depend upon the particular swimmer features",
    ". however , some aspects of the hydrodynamics , for example the dipolar far flow field , are _ universal _ , i.e. generic across a wide range of swimmers . when considering the effect of entrainment on particle transport we shall , in particular , identify the universal aspects of the tracer motion .",
    "in order to analyse permanent displacement of fluid by a moving body it is convenient to envision an initially flat material sheet ( ie a plane of tracer particles ) of infinite extension , and a swimmer approaching it normally , see fig .  [",
    "fig : loops ] . as the body moves , the sheet is deformed .",
    "studies of the asymptotic shape of the material sheet and the fluid transfer fall under the rubric of the darwin drift .",
    "the cases of towed bodies in inviscid @xcite and viscous flows @xcite have been analysed in detail . here",
    "we consider the darwin drift for force - free swimmers , far from , and then closer to , the swimmer trajectory .      the velocity field",
    "far from a swimmer is dominated by the dipolar and quadrupolar terms which , from eqns .",
    "( [ eq : dipole ] ) and ( [ e : quadrupole ] ) , are @xmath43 here we use cartesian coordinates with the z - axis directed along the swimming direction and hence @xmath44 .",
    "the multipole expansion ensures that the asymptotic shape of the material sheet is naturally universal at large distances from the swimmer path .",
    "let @xmath0 be the distance from this path to a tracer in the material sheet and @xmath45 the resulting tracer displacement along the swimming direction , as the swimmer travels from and to infinity .",
    "straightforward asymptotic calculations ( see appendix a ) result in @xmath46 here @xmath47 and @xmath48 are constants . detailed calculation show that @xmath49 . a typical shape of the deformed sheet is shown in fig .  [ fig : loops ] . as @xmath50 ,",
    "far from the swimmer the sheet is displaced oppositely to the swimming direction both for pushers and pullers .",
    "pushers and pullers are distinguished by the sign of the second term in ( [ eq : delta ] ) .",
    "notably , the displacement @xmath45 turns out independent of the quadrupole strength @xmath26 .",
    "the calculation we have just described is valid in the region of small negative total tracer displacement . a quantitative comparison to numerical results",
    "will be given in sec .",
    "unlike the case of far distances , at close separations from the swimmer the shape of the deformed material sheet strongly depends on the swimmer size , shape , and stroke .",
    "it will , however , always remain integrable , and the volume of fluid entrained by the swimmer finite .",
    "we shall show , surprisingly , that the total volume of fluid displaced by the swimmer @xmath51 can be decomposed into a universal and a swimmer - dependent part having a lucid physical meaning . before deriving this result",
    ", we pause to note that in his seminal paper @xcite put forward a remarkable proposal that for a body moving steadily in an inviscid fluid , @xmath51 equals the added mass of the body .",
    "he derived this result for a sphere and a cylinder of circular shape , finding in accordance with his hypothesis @xmath52 , where @xmath53 for a sphere and @xmath54 for a cylinder .",
    "later his arguments were refined ( * ? ? ? * and references therein ) and a notion of the partial darwin drift was introduced to account for the case of a body starting a finite distance from the sheet before crossing it and moving to infinity .",
    "more recently , a spherical viscous drop towed through a fluid of different viscosity was considered @xcite .",
    "it was found that in this case @xmath51 is divergent with a pre - factor proportional to the viscosity of the surrounding fluid .",
    "a viscosity - enhanced mechanism of ocean biomixing @xcite was proposed based on this result .",
    "we follow the ideas of darwin in our derivation of @xmath51 for force - free swimmers .",
    "we set the z - axis along the swimming direction and introduce the cylindrically symmetric stream function in the system of reference co - moving with the swimmer @xmath55 . for a swimmer with the velocity field ( [ eq : ufar ] ) we obtain ( see appendix b ) : @xmath56}+ o(r^{-2}),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath57 and @xmath58 .",
    "next , we consider a flow region around the swimmer which has a finite lateral extension @xmath59 and is enclosed in a streamtube of a finite initial radius @xmath60 : @xmath61 .",
    "the total entrained volume is obtained from the volume entrained by the flow within this region by letting @xmath62 . by a simple geometrical argument ( see appendix b and fig .",
    "[ darwinpic ] ) , the latter equals @xmath63 here @xmath64 is the volume of the flow region enclosed by a stagnation streamline around the swimmer ( in the co - moving reference frame ) and @xmath65 depends only on the far - field of the swimmer velocity : @xmath66 at this point , however , eq .  ( [ eq : a ] ) is not well - defined , as the first term on the right hand side may diverge as @xmath62 .",
    "but it will remain finite , in fact equal to zero , if the swimmer path is symmetric with respect to the initial plane of the material sheet , @xmath67 .",
    "hence , under this condition , the dipole flow component does not contribute to the permanent volume transfer across the sheet and , when the swimmer travels an infinite distance , @xmath68        the final expression for the darwin drift reads @xmath69 similarly to the tracer displacement @xmath45 , the darwin drift of a swimmer turns out independent of the quadrupole strength @xmath26 . to appreciate the result ( [ eq : vd ] ) , the distinction between the volume @xmath64 and the swimmer volume @xmath70 should be emphasized : @xmath71 where @xmath72 is the volume of the swimmer wake .",
    "( [ eq : vd ] ) provides a decomposition of @xmath51 into a universal and a swimmer - dependent part . for an arbitrary force - free swimmer",
    "the near - field details affect the entrained volume by virtue of @xmath64 only . in the next section",
    "we illustrate the utility of the expression ( [ eq : vd ] ) for two model swimmers : the squirmer model and a numerical model of the bacterial cell",
    ".    for the special case of @xmath28 , the expression ( [ eq : vd ] ) reduces to @xmath73 this formula is , in fact , identical to the one derived by @xcite in the context of inviscid flows . but the underlying physical reasons are , of course , different . in the inviscid case",
    "the potential dipole ( coinciding with the viscous force quadrupole @xcite ) is the only dominant fluid velocity component present that may contribute to @xmath65 . in the ( highly ) viscous case ,",
    "however , the stokeslet and stresslet components do not contribute because of the force - free nature of the swimmer motion and the symmetry conditions on the swimmer trajectory respectively .",
    "we recently found that the expression ( [ eq : darwin ] ) was also stated in the context of swimmers in @xcite but the questions of universality and the role of the wake were not discussed .",
    "we have assumed so far that microswimmers move in a roughly steady fashion and produce stationary flows . but some microswimmers , such as _ c. rheinhardtii _ , produce oscillatory flows by beating their flagella asymmetrically during the power and recovery strokes .",
    "nevertheless , all conclusions obtained in this chapter remain valid if we understand the physical quantities such as the fluid velocity , the streamfunction and the multipole strengths in the beat cycle - averaged sense .",
    "the spherical squirmer model has been the theorists workhorse for studying swimming at low _ re _",
    "numbers for more than half a century @xcite .",
    "it assumes a spherical swimmer of radius @xmath74 with a prescribed tangential velocity @xmath75 on the swimmer s surface in the co - moving reference frame ( @xmath76 is the polar angle measured from the swimming direction ) .",
    "the induced flow can be found analytically as a superposition of spherical harmonics . in the simplest nontrivial case when just the first two harmonics are nonzero : @xmath77 where @xmath78 and @xmath79 are constants . for a neutrally buoyant",
    ", force - free swimmer @xmath78 sets the swimming speed @xmath80 , and @xmath79 sets the swimmer dipole strength .",
    "the squirmer streamfunction equals @xmath81,\\ ] ] where @xmath82 .",
    "comparison of the latter expression with ( [ eq : streamf ] ) shows that squirmer dipole strength @xmath83 and the quadrupole strength @xmath84 .",
    "clearly , squirmers having @xmath85 are pushers while those having @xmath86 are pullers . for strong enough dipole strength , @xmath87 , squirmers develop a bubble - like wake .",
    "the dependence of the squirmer wake volume on @xmath88 , @xmath89 , can be calculated analytically , see appendix c.    having substituted the above calculations in the expression ( [ eq : darwin ] ) , we readily obtain : @xmath90 the first term in the brackets is the added mass coefficient for a sphere @xmath53 .",
    "the function @xmath91 is plotted on figure [ p : squirmwavevol ] .",
    "thus , when @xmath92 the volume entrained by a squirmer equals that of a sphere of the same size moving with the same speed in inviscid fluid . for larger @xmath93 , @xmath51 decreases and becomes negative for @xmath94 .",
