    "in the past two decades , an important progress of nonequilibrium physics is the discovery of a variety of fluctuation relations  @xcite .",
    "these exact relations about the statistics of entropy production or dissipated work have greatly deepened our understanding of the second law of thermodynamics and nonequilibrium physics of small systems .",
    "recently , these fluctuation relations were also extended into other fields , _",
    "e.g. _ , the thermodynamics of information - processing systems  @xcite .",
    "for instance , sagawa and ueda  @xcite obtained a generalized jarzynski equality with feedback control , @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the inverse temperature of heat bath , @xmath2 is the dissipated work  @xcite , and @xmath3 is the mutual information .",
    "this intriguing work equality leads into an inequality , @xmath4 which agrees with the second law of information thermodynamics  @xcite .",
    "the validity of these relations has been verified by the single colloidal particle experiment  @xcite .",
    "very recently , abreu and seifert  @xcite extended sagawa - ueda s equality  ( [ orgsagawauedaequality ] ) into genuine nonequilibrium processes in the master equation systems .",
    "analogous equalities and inequalities with feedback control were obtained for the excess entropy production and total entropy production .",
    "other more general relations were also reported  @xcite .    as we mentioned at the beginning , in classical systems there are various fluctuation relations . the results of sagawa and ueda  @xcite , and abreu and seifert  @xcite have implied the plausibility of introducing feedback control into those relations .",
    "moreover , we note that in the past few years there were quiet a few efforts of unifying the fluctuation relations  @xcite .",
    "hence , it shall be more desirable if these various relations with feedback control could be as well unified under a single formula .",
    "here we show that the unification does exist for the continuous diffusion processes .",
    "instead of starting from the conventional detailed fluctuation theorem  @xcite , our theory is based upon the generalized fluctuation integral relation ( gifr )  @xcite that we proposed earlier .",
    "its advantage is that the gifr does not need to explicitly define _ time - reversal_. hence , it is capable to unify the various fluctuation relations relying on distinct time - reversals , _",
    "e.g. _ , that of the hatano - sasa equality  @xcite .",
    "the organization of the work is as follows . in sec .",

    "second , extending the fluctuation relations with feedback control essentially depends on the validity of the relations themselves . finally , there is a highly analogous gifr  @xcite in the continuous time master equation with discrete states  @xcite .",
    "its extension of feedback control can be easily carried out as what we did here ; see the details in  [ appendixa ] .",
    "the very general  ( [ gifrfeedback ] ) in fact presents an infinite number of equalities due to almost arbitrary choice of @xmath45 and @xmath38 .",
    "however , it is nontrivial to reveal some of them of physical interest .",
    "we first show that  ( [ gifrfeedback ] ) can cover several known fluctuation relations with feedback control  @xcite .",
    "below we set @xmath32@xmath7@xmath10 for simplicity .",
    "the first example is for the diffusion process that starts from the steady state @xmath113 .",
    "if the system has instantaneous steady - state solution @xmath114 at any fixed parameters @xmath115 , we may choose the solution as @xmath45 and let @xmath116=0 .",
    "then the gifr  ( [ gifrfeedback ] ) reduces into @xmath117 this is the generalized jarzynski - hatano - sasa equality with feedback control .",
    "abreu and seifert first presented the equality in the discrete master equations  @xcite .",
    "specifically , if the steady - state solution is just the instantaneous thermal equilibrium state , @xmath118 ,  ( [ hatanosasafeedback ] ) may be further simplified into the work equality  ( [ orgsagawauedaequality ] ) of sagawa and ueda  @xcite .",
    "note that under this circumstance if the control parameters jump at the measurement times , the @xmath95-term represents the amount of energy input by the external controller into the system . in sec .",
    "[ overdampedmodel ] , we use a brownian model to illustrate this point .",
    "the second example is to choose @xmath45 to be the pdf @xmath119 of the system and @xmath120 to be its irreversible current , @xmath121 where @xmath122 is the irreversible component of the drift force  @xcite",
    ". then the gifr  ( [ gifrfeedback ] ) reduces into @xmath123(x(\\tau),\\tau,\\lambda^k_{\\tau})d\\tau -j- i}\\hspace{0.1cm}\\right\\rangle_{\\rho_0}=1.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] we have shown that , for the nonequilibrium processes with predetermined external parameters , the integrand  ( [ jfunctional ] ) with these specific @xmath45 and @xmath116 is the rate of the total entropy production  @xcite . therefore , the equality  ( [ totentropyfeedback ] ) is nothing but its extension of taking feedback control into account  @xcite .",
    "the reader is reminded that the @xmath95-term here is generally zero , since the pdf of the system is continuous in time even if the control parameters have finite jumps . however , this is no longer true for the parameters being @xmath124-functions , _",
    "e.g. _ , an underdamped brownian model in sec .  [ underdampedbm ] .",
    "contrary to the equality  ( [ hatanosasafeedback ] ) , which requires the existence of the instantaneous steady - state solutions ,  ( [ totentropyfeedback ] ) holds for general diffusion processes .",
    "in addition to the above known results in the literature , the gifr  ( [ gifrfeedback ] ) predicts a previously unnoticed equality in the dynamic perturbation problem  @xcite . consider a perturbed system with the fokker - planck operator @xmath125@xmath7@xmath126@xmath57@xmath127 , where @xmath126 denotes the time - independent operator of the free system , and @xmath128 is the perturbation in which the control parameters are involved . before applying the perturbation ,",

    "the physical relevance of above equality may be clearly explained by the 1-d underdamped brownian particle : @xmath132 where @xmath6@xmath7@xmath133 is the coordinate of the particle in its phase space , @xmath134 is the friction coefficient , the dynamic force @xmath115 represents the control parameter , and @xmath135@xmath7@xmath136@xmath57@xmath137 is the hamiltonian of the free system .",

    ". we do not clearly understand the physical meaning of the above equality , though the integral indeed possesses the dimension of work . even though we must emphasize that for the overdamped particle the bke  ( [ bkfeedback ] ) is still true but it does not originate from ( [ gbkfeedback ] ) .",
    "we leave the discussion in  [ appendixb ] .",
    "horowitz and vaikuntanathan  @xcite , and sagawa and ueda  @xcite have discussed the time reversal explanation of  ( [ orgsagawauedaequality ] ) in great details .",
    "the equality was thought to be the consequence of the detailed trajectory fluctuation theorem with discrete feedback control .",
    "this theorem is about the ratio of the joint probability of observing trajectory and protocol in the forward process and the joint probability of observing reversed trajectory and protocol in the time - reversed process  @xcite .",
    "different from the forward protocols determined by the feedback measurements , the reversed protocols are randomly drawn from the known probability distribution of the protocols recorded in the forward process  @xcite . interestingly , this result automatically emerges in  ( [ rfunctionfeedback ] ) : its right - hand side is the statistical average of the pdf @xmath148 of the time reversed process with the specific reversed protocol @xmath101 over the pdf @xmath149 ; there are no measurements at all",
    ". we must emphasize that  ( [ rfunctionfeedback ] ) is valid for very general diffusion processes .",
    "particularly , the content of the time - reversal is far broader than that considered in previous works  @xcite .",
    "in addition to the interest in the concept , the time reversal explanation of  ( [ rfunctionfeedback ] ) is also useful .",
    "we can obtain an alternative inequality with feedback control : @xmath150({x } ( \\tau),\\tau,\\lambda^k_\\tau)d\\tau\\right\\rangle_{\\varrho_0}+\\langle j \\rangle_{\\varrho_0}\\ge d[\\varrho(x,0)||{\\left\\langle q_{\\tilde{\\lambda}}(\\tilde{x},t_f)\\right\\rangle_{\\mu_m}}]-\\langle",

    "e.g. _ , ( [ sagawaineq ] )  @xcite , ( [ inequalityfeedback ] ) presents a stronger one on the entropy - like quantity .",
    "this inequality is the other center result of this work . in the next section",
    ", we will concretely illustrate it by two brownian models with single feedback control .",
