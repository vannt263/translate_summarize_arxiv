    "the internal constituents of compact stars are a great source of speculation @xcite",
    ". they could be made of hadronic matter only , quark matter only ( a possibility arisen by the bodmer - witten conjecture @xcite ) , or they could be hybrid .",
    "hybrid stars may have in their interior hadrons and quarks with or without a condensate .",
    "if the star is composed of quark matter only , it may be a bare star and we will tackle this point at the end of this chapter . on the other hand ,",
    "if it is made of hadrons only or if it is a hybrid object , it has a crust , our main interest in what follows .",
    "the crust mass and thickness depend on the equation of state ( eos ) that describes the star .",
    "they also depend on the total stellar mass ; an increase of the stellar mass increases the gravitational pull within the crust resulting in the thinning of the crust .",
    "an estimation of the size of the crust done in @xcite gives values varying from 1.01 to 0.29 km .",
    "in particular , we will discuss the possible existence of inhomogeneous structures , i. e. the pasta phase , in the inner crust due to the competition between the strong and coulomb interactions and their implications for the properties of the crust .    through out this chapter , we consider a system of protons and neutrons with mass @xmath0 interacting with and through an isoscalar - scalar field @xmath1 with mass @xmath2 , an isoscalar - vector field @xmath3 with mass @xmath4 , an isovector - vector field @xmath5 with mass @xmath6 .",
    "we also include a system of leptons composed by electrons and muons , electrons and neutrinos or just electrons , depending on the problem .",
    "the lagrangian density reads : @xmath7 where the nucleon lagrangian density has the form @xmath8 \\psi _ { i }   \\label{lagnucl},\\ ] ] with @xmath9 the lepton lagrangian density is given by @xmath10\\psi_l , \\label{lage}\\ ] ] where @xmath11 , @xmath12 stand for the charge and mass of the lepton , respectively , and the meson lagrangian densities are @xmath13 where @xmath14 , @xmath15 and @xmath16 .",
    "the parameters of the models are the nucleon mass @xmath17 mev , the coupling parameters @xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath20 of the mesons to the nucleons , the electron mass @xmath21 mev , the muon mass @xmath22 mev and the electromagnetic coupling constant @xmath23 .",
    "the electron neutrino mass is considered to be zero . in the above lagrangian density @xmath24",
    "are the pauli matrices .",
    "when density dependent models are used , the non - linear terms are not present and , hence , @xmath25 and the density dependent parameters are chosen as in @xcite .",
    "for the parametrizations with constant couplings , @xmath26 is replaced by @xmath27 , where @xmath28 as in the nl3 parameter set @xcite .",
    "some expressions are often used next . @xmath29 and",
    "@xmath30 refer to the proton and lepton fractions respectively .",
    "if matter in @xmath31-equilibrium is considered in a system of protons , neutrons , electrons and possibly trapped electron neutrinos , one has : @xmath32 for neutrino free matter @xmath33 .",
    "neutrality of charge requires @xmath34 and , if @xmath35 is present , its chemical potential is equal to the electron chemical potential .",
    "it was shown in @xcite that the pressure and density at the inner boundary of the crust ( transition pressure and transition density ) define the mass and moment of inertia of the crust .",
    "this establishes a relation between the equation of state ( eos ) and compact - star observables . in this section",
    "we show how an estimation of the transition properties may be obtained from the thermodynamical binodal and spinodal surfaces , or the dynamical spinodal .",
    "a better estimation , obtained from the pasta phase calculation , will be discussed in section [ pasta ]    the liquid - gas phase transition at subsaturation densities is a well known feature of the nuclear eos @xcite .",
    "it corresponds to the presence of a negative curvature of the free energy density @xmath36 . in this case",
    "the system is unstable against separation into two infinite homogeneous phases .",
    "the spinodal surface , which limits the unstable region in the @xmath37 space , is defined by the cancellation of the determinant of the free energy curvature matrix @xcite : @xmath38    the eigenvalues of the curvature matrix are given by @xmath39 and are associated to the eigenvectors @xmath40 . inside the spinodal region the lowest eigenvalue @xmath41 is negative .",
    "the direction of the vector @xmath42 defines the direction of instability , which generally dictates a distillation effect corresponding to a phase separation into a high density symmetric matter and low density neutron rich matter @xcite .    in the left panel of fig.[inst ]",
    "the spinodal sections obtained for different relativistic mean field ( rmf ) models are plotted in terms of the total density @xmath43 and the asymmetry parameter @xmath44 while for symmetric matter most of the models show a similar behavior , at high asymmetry and/or temperature models differ .",
    "for this reason , establishing constraints on the equations of state based on experimental results is an important step , and a discussion on this aspect is done in section [ vinculos ] in the right panel of fig .",
    "[ inst ] , the spinodal sections for several temperatures and two models ( nl3 @xcite and tw @xcite ) are an example of the possible existing differences : for tw with a symmetry energy and corresponding slope equal , respectively , to 32.76 and 55.30 mev , the transition density ( identified by a full dot ) occurs at a larger density and for a smaller proton fraction than for nl3 with a symmetry energy and slope equal , respectively , to 37.34 and 118.30 mev .",
    "also , for tw the spinodal surface extends to a larger temperature .    [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]     to extend the present calculation in order to consider matter in protoneutron stars , the enforcement of charge neutrality and @xmath31-equilibrium is required .",
    "the ideal calculation would consider a fixed entropy resulting in temperatures lower than 50 mev in the interior of the stars .",
    "this extension is simple and straightforward .",
    "in this chapter we have focused on the study of possible internal structures of the neutron stars crust .",
    "the existence of the pasta phase is related to the instabilities and possible coexisting phases in the nuclear matter , features well described by the spinodal and binodal sections .",
    "important remaining questions are : at which temperatures do the pasta structures dissolve ? up to which temperatures is the ansatz of a wigner seitz cell valid ? we have tried to validate a simple coexistence phase approach to obtain the pasta phase and its structure by using the results of possible surface energy parametrizations and comparing the final results with the more realistic and self - consistent thomas - fermi approximation , which is very time consuming .",
    "it remains to be checked how the thomas - fermi calculation of @xmath31-equilibrium pasta phase compares with the results obtained within hartree - fock and hartree - fock - bogoliubov , where only spherical clusters are considered .",
    "more calculations in this direction are still required .",
    "so far , we have included @xmath45 particles as part of the pasta phase . will light clusters other than @xmath45 particles contribute in a significative manner to the extension of the pasta phase and its transition density to homogeneous matter ? moreover , how will the presence of light clusters affect the properties of the pasta phase ?",
    "are the values for the dissolution density of the different light clusters in nuclear matter realistic @xcite ?",
    "we have also seen that the inclusion of the pasta phase affects the neutrino opacities through its diffusion coefficients .",
    "it remains to be checked how the internal structure of the pasta phase , which is model and approximation dependent , influences the diffusion coefficients through the different neutrino mean free paths .",
    "a more complete calculation will show us how the existence of the pasta structures affect the transport properties of the crust .",
    "our last section was devoted to a subject other than the crust of neutron stars .",
    "the measurement of a pulsar of inferred mass @xmath46 known as psr j1614 - 2230 @xcite , opened new questions about its possible constituents and related equation of state .",
    "it is well known that there is a maximum mass that can be supported against collapse and its theoretical value is very model dependent . according to @xcite , the maximum mass of a quark star lies between 2 and 2.7 @xmath47 .",
    "hence , it is claimed that psr j1614 - 2230 can be a quark star .",
    "do quark stars really exist ? how are they affected by strong magnetic fields ?",
    "we have seen that our results for the njl model can not reproduce such high masses , not even with very strong magnetic fields .",
