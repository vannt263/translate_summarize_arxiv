    "charge - coupled device ( ccd ) imaging detectors convert incident photons into electrons . the electrons are stored within a silicon substrate , in a pixellated grid of electrostatic potential wells that gradually fill up during an exposure . at the end of the exposure ,",
    "the electrons are shuffled , row by row , to a readout register at the edge of the device .",
    "they are then counted and converted into a digital signal .        above the earth s atmosphere",
    ", a continuous bombardment of high energy particles makes a harsh environment for sensitive electronic equipment .",
    "protons , neutrons , high - energy electrons and heavy ions create bulk damage by colliding with and displacing atoms from the silicon lattice .",
    "the dislodged atoms can come to rest in the interstitial space , and the vacancies left behind move about the lattice until they combine with interstitial impurities , such as phosphorous , oxygen or another vacancy @xcite .",
    "such defects degrade a ccd s ability to shuffle electrons , known as its charge transfer efficiency ( cte ; charge transfer _ in_efficiency cti=1-cte ) .",
    "electrons can become temporarily trapped in the local potential , then released after a delay that depends upon the properties of the lattice and impurities , and the operating temperature of the device @xcite .",
    "if a few electrons are trapped during ccd readout , and held while other electrons are moved along , they are released as a spurious trail ( see figure  [ fig : rawacsimage ] ) . regions of the image furthest from the readout register are worst affected , because electrons starting there encounter the most charge traps during their journey across the device .",
    "charge transfer inefficiency gets worse over time , as cumulative radiation damage creates more charge traps . by january 2007 , when the hubble space telescope ( hst ) advanced camera for surveys ( acs ) encountered an electronic failure , the instrument had been in operation on - orbit for almost 5 years and its scientific imagaging technologies ( site ) st002a ccds were already significantly affected by cti .",
    "similarly , the wide field and planetary camera 2 ( wfpc2 ) instrument spent 16 years on - orbit . by the time it was decommissioned ,",
    "its truly severe cti created trailing that was readily visible on every exposure .",
    "different astronomical measurements are hindered by different species of charge traps .",
    "charge traps with a characteristic release time of a few ccd clock cycles move electrons by a few pixels , creating short trails that alter the apparent position ( astrometry ) and shape ( morphology ) of faint objects .",
    "charge traps with a release time of many clock cycles completely detach electrons from their original objects , thus also lowering their measured brightness ( photometry ) .",
    "several parametric schemes have been developed to estimate and thus correct all these effects at a catalogue level .",
    "fitting formulae have been approximated , as a function of objects detector position , date of observation and flux , for incorrect astrometry with wfpc2 @xcite , photometry with acs @xcite , morphology with stis @xcite and acs @xcite , and others .",
    "although such schemes provide first order mean correction for a large number of objects , they are inaccurate for high precision measurement of individual objects . for example , no account is made for the screening of faint objects by bright objects slightly closer to the readout register ( which pre - fill charge traps ) or , with extended sources , for the dependence upon object size , radial profile , and shape ( see discussion in @xcite and @xcite )",
    ".    more precise removal of cti trailing requires manipulation of the raw pixel data , using software to move electrons back to their original locations .",
    "since ccd readout is the last stage of data acquisition , this should be the first stage of a final data reduction pipeline ( calacs , * ? ? ?",
    "even this will never achieve precision at the level of single electrons , since charge trapping and release are stochastic , quantum mechanical effects .",
    "however , such software has been demonstrated to be much more accurate than parametric solutions for the correction of hst stis imaging ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* & 2007 ) and spectroscopy @xcite , and chandra acis spectroscopy @xcite .",
    "this approach can also provide physically motivated model parameters , rather than an ad - hoc fitting function to arbitrary parameters .    in this paper",
    ", we develop an empirical but physically motivated , pixel - based cti correction scheme for acs / wfc imaging .",
    "we concentrate on traps with release times of a few ccd clock cycles , but our algorithm is sufficiently general to be able to incorporate additional species of traps with longer release times if necessary . in  [ sec : model ] , we build a model of the readout process by measuring the rate at which the ccds potential wells are filled by electrons , and the properties of charge traps within those wells . in  [ sec : correction ] , we describe software to implement this readout model , and use the iterative approach of @xcite to reverse the process . in  [ sec : tests ] , we apply this to real data and obtain better measurements of galaxy photometry , astrometry and ellipticity in the hst cosmos survey . in  [ sec : conclusions ] , we discuss possible improvements to our algorithm , and summarise our work .",
    "we primarily base our analysis on the `` _ raw '' data obtained during hst cycles 12 and 13 for the cosmos survey ( hst - go-09822 , p.i . :",
    "n.  scoville ) .",
    "these are 2368 uniform , extragalactic exposures of 507  seconds each @xcite . for convenience , we first split each exposure into the four quadrants read out through different amplifiers , rotating and flipping them to orient the readout in the same direction for all . we then multiply the image by the calibrated gain ( which varies slightly between amplifiers ) and subtract the corresponding superbias images created by stsci .",
    "this reverts the images to units of electrons , in approximately their configuration on the ccd immediately prior to readout ( but note uncertainty about the imperfectly modeled injection of charge by warm pixels during readout in  [ sec : warmpixels ] ) .",
    "we have also tested our cte correction method in a less systematic manner on imaging from cycle 14 ( hst - go-10496 , p.i .",
    ": s.  perlmutter ) .",
    "this extends the analysis to nearly january 2007 , when acs failed . while this smaller survey provided sufficient data to verify an extrapolation of our correction parameters , such non - uniform observational strategies proved less useful for tracking the gradual cte degradation .",
    "our model could also be extrapolated to correct observations obtained after servicing mission 4 .",
    "however , this would be a large extrapolation , and the trap density did not necessarily continue to rise at the same rate while the instrument was offline .",
    "we would therefore recommend new calibrations as soon as sufficient images become available .",
    "a detector s cti can be measured using first pixel response ( fpr ) tests , extended pixel edge response ( eper ) tests , or @xmath2fe radiation @xcite .",
    "fpr and eper tests involve uniformly illuminating a ccd and measuring deviations from that uniformity in the few pixels nearest the readout register and ( virtual ) pixels obtained by continuing to clock charge past the end of the ccd .",
    "in addition , a radioactive iron source can be used to create a series of @xmath3-functions on the ccd , all of a fixed energy level .",
    "deficiencies in the observed number of electrons in some events , or deviations in their shape , reveal the presence of charge traps between the event and the readout electronics .",
    "a continuous programme of fpr and eper monitoring has been carried out on the acs / wfc detectors since launch ( hst programs 9649,10044,10369 and 10732 ; * ? ? ?",
    "radiation testing was performed prior to launch , but is not possible on - orbit in hst .    after experimenting on all three types of data acquired in a laboratory environment , we decided that that the parameters needed for our model are most easily extracted from radiation tests .",
    "although in - flight @xmath2fe data are unavailable , cosmic ray damage has also created randomly distributed `` warm pixels '' that suffice instead @xcite .",
    "warm pixels are short circuits in the ccd electrostatic potentials used to collect charge , and continuously inject spurious charge into the device . during a long exposure ,",
    "warm pixels create single - pixel @xmath3-functions . since the rate of charge injection varies between warm pixels",
    ", these @xmath3-functions have a range of amplitudes . in some ways",
    ", this is actually more convenient than an @xmath2fe source .    to identify warm pixels within each image @xmath4",
    ", we locate 2d local maxima , after unsharp masking to eliminate extended objects ( whether they be resolved galaxies or merely a point spread function ) .",
    "one such warm pixel is labeled @xmath5 in figure  [ fig : rawacsimage ] , and contains @xmath6 electrons .",
    "this number has been only slightly changed during readout .",
    "we measure the trail @xmath7 where @xmath8 are pixels defined relative to the location of the warm pixel @xmath5 in figure  [ fig : rawacsimage ] , and @xmath9 is an integer from @xmath10 .",
    "note that we could have replaced pixels with negative indices by a locally - determined background level .",
    "our better scheme is robust to the accidental inclusion of any extended sources ( or cosmic rays covering more than one pixel ) in our catalogue .",
    "although such individual artefacts have a shape , they should not have a preferred direction on average , and therefore should not bias our measurement of @xmath11 .",
    "indeed , we could even have intentionally measured the trailing behind extended sources . however , in practice , averaging out their intrinsic radial profile adds more noise than the extra numbers of pixels add signal .    at the very faint end of our warm pixel catalogue , which we push down to @xmath12  electrons",
    "so that it only just exceeds the background level , our algorithm often finds noise peaks instead of true warm pixels .",
    "if the noise were due to photon shot noise , these pixels would be ideal for our purposes , but it is more often read noise  which is added after clocking and therefore untrailed . to prevent the dilution of our trail measurements , we discard pixels that are not flagged as warm in at least half of the exposures .",
    "in the faintest two bins , this process removes @xmath13 and @xmath14 of the catalogue , but quickly becomes negligible for brighter pixels .",
    "true warm pixels persist through many exposures .",
    "we avoid `` hot '' pixels containing more than 76230  electrons , which is @xmath15 of the full well depth .",
    "saturated pixels bleed charge into nearby pixels on the same column , interfering with the observed shape of the cti trail .",
    "note that warm pixels also inject a low level of charge into a column of pixels during readout .",
    "this is a relatively small complication : the ratio of charge in this line to that in the @xmath3-function is equal to the ratio of the clock speed to the total exposure time .",
    "the data can be corrected along all but the worst - affected columns by subtracting superbias frames ( produced from a zero - second exposure but normal readout ) .",
    "we subtract bias frames before anything else , since we are trying to obtain data as it was immediately before readout .",
    "however , this is a simplification because ( some of ) the spurious charge was also present during readout , when the cti trails were created . a more complete ccd model might also measure the `` temperature '' of each warm pixel , then incorporate a continuous injection of charge during readout",
    "this would be most important for measurements of the density of charge trap species with long release times , whose extended trail is partly degenerate with a constant line of charge injection ( as opposed to charge re - emitted from short timescale traps for which the original source can be readily identified ) .",
    "even more worryingly , there is ( unexplained ) temporal structure in the injection of charge to some warm pixels that is not necessarily reproduced in the superbias frames .",
    "we therefore decided to incorporate the few percent of columns containing the warmest pixels in the calacs bad pixel mask .",
    "this is more severe than excluding hot pixels , since the entire rest of the column is masked .      to emulate the process of ccd readout ,",
    "we first need to model the collection of electrons within a pixel s potential well . in theory ,",
    "the expected locations of a given number of electrons can be calculated from a model of the ccd , by solving poisson s equation within the appropriate applied potential .",
    "@xcite and @xcite find that , for typical ccds , electrons are contained within a well - defined volume  outside which their density falls rapidly to zero . adopting this result",
    ", we shall regard a given number of electrons as filling a three dimensional pixel up to a specific height .",
    "we then need to model the charge traps .",
    "we assume that none are filled during integration .",
    "however , following @xcite ( but not * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , we simplify the problem of charge capture as soon as readout begins by assuming that unoccupied traps _ instantly _ capture any electrons in their vicinity (  all traps inside the well - defined volume get filled ) .",
    "in reality , there is an exponential decay time needed for traps to capture an electron , but this is typically much shorter than the electron dwell time within one ccd clock cycle @xcite .",
    "the rapid and efficient capture of electrons , even in locations where the electron density is low , further delineates the quantifiable volume of a pixel occupied by a given number of electrons .",
    "it also means that any charge traps physically located near the bottom of a pixel ( below the ambient background level ) reach the steady state of being permanently occupied , even during readout . in our model",
    "such traps never affect an image , so we can never probe them ; but then , we never need to .    each filled trap releases its electron after a time determined by @xmath16 , the e - folding time of an exponential decay @xcite . if the trap is inside the volume currently occupied by electrons , it will immediately capture a new one ; if it is above , the electron will be pulled down and added back to the cloud ( which thus expands and may even be exposed to new charge traps ) .",
    "we concentrate on species of traps with capture times @xmath16 of a few ccd clock cycles ( @xmath17s in the parallel direction ; @xcite ) .",
    "traps with long release times affect the leading edge of the first bright object in a ccd column , but then reach a full steady state ( at least while the rest of the object passes by ) and only minimally affect its photometry , astrometry and morphology @xcite . for a fixed clock speed",
    ", @xmath16 can be conveniently expressed in units of the number of pixels that have passed since capture .",
    "if the charge traps are evenly distributed , we need measure only the mean density of each species . in  [ sec : volume ] , we indeed find the distribution of traps to be uniform in the @xmath18 direction ; we have no reason to suggest that the distribution is not similarly uniform in the other directions .",
    "in addition , our approach will internally parametrize out any smooth density gradients in the vertical direction .",
    "we assume that each charge trap always captures a single electron .",
    "real traps might be able to hold several , or occasionally capture none .",
    "if they hold several , and especially if the trap densities are low , simultaneous release of many electrons could produce correlated spikes in the trails . trapping mechanisms are not yet sufficiently understood to know whether electrons are released singly or in groups ( c.  bebek , priv .",
    "we therefore simply assume that any multiple ( or partial ) occupancy of traps is equivalently modelled by an the _ effective _ density of single - electron traps .    finally , we ignore ccds three - phase clocking cycle , by which a cloud of electrons is transferred from one pixel to the next @xcite .",
    "the transition period exposes the electron cloud to additional regions of silicon , and additional charge traps .",
    "however , with our assumption of instantaneous charge capture , extra charge traps in regions between pixels can again be modeled to first order as an increase in the _ effective _ trap density .",
    "these traps are a fraction of a pixel nearer to ( or further from ) the readout register , but horizontal translations of the exponential release curve are also degenerate with a change in normalisation .",
    "the only remaining finesse is that the width ( and therefore the height ) of the electron cloud changes during the three - phase clocking cycle , making the cloud dwell temporarily at different heights within the silicon and therefore being exposed to a different number of charge traps .",
    "we ignore this second - order effect , but incorporating a model of the full , three - phase clock cycle might be a useful exercise for future work .",
    "our model features the following free parameters :    * number of ( relevant ) species of charge trap , * characteristic release time of each species of charge trap , * density of each species of charge trap    ( or a functional form for their distribution if they are not uniformly located throughout the ccd ) , plus the    * height occupied by a cloud of electrons in a pixel s potential well (  the number of charge traps they are exposed to ) , as a function of the number of electrons .    as we shall now demonstrate , warm pixels enable us to measure all of these quantities from on - orbit science exposures .",
    "scatter from measurements behind the whole population of warm pixels .",
    "the dashed curve shows the best - fit double exponential model.,width=317 ]      to obtain maximum signal to noise , we begin by studying the brightest warm pixels , furthest from the readout register and in data obtained near the chronological end of the cosmos survey .",
    "we select 20 images taken on 15 may 2005 , 1171 days after the launch of acs , and measure the mean trail @xmath11 around all warm pixels between 1634 and 2039 pixels from the readout register , and containing between 3234 and 76230 electrons ) . ] .",
    "the mean trail is shown in figure  [ fig : onetrail ] .",
    "using levenberg - marquardt least - squares minimization , we find that the mean trail is well - fit by a sum of two exponentials , @xmath19 where @xmath20  e@xmath21 , @xmath22  pixels , @xmath23  e@xmath21 and @xmath24  pixels . at the @xmath25c operating temperature of acs / wfc ,",
    "these correspond precisely with the release times of trap species found by @xcite in a marconi ccd47 - 20 n - channel detector at 0.34  ev and 0.31  ev below the conduction band .",
    "the origin of these particular traps is unknown , but they have been speculated to be e - centres ( phosphorous - vacancy complexes ) with impurities of either carbon @xcite or hydrogen @xcite .",
    "pure e - centre charge traps at 0.44  ev exist in both the marconi and acs / wfc @xcite ccds , with a characteristic release time of @xmath26  pixels in the marconi .",
    "all other charge traps in the marconi ccd have @xmath27  pixels @xcite , so this 1-to-1 correspondence is unlikely to be coincidence .",
    "however , allowing a third exponential prevents our fit from converging , with positive @xmath28 but @xmath29 iterating towards infinity . fitting slowly decaying exponentials is a standard problem @xcite , because they are nearly degenerate with a constant .",
    "a line of charge above a warm pixel could represent either a species of trap with a very long release time or contamination from continued charge injection during readout (   [ sec : assumptions ] ) .",
    "we therefore restrict our analysis to the two species of traps with shorter @xmath16 , which also have a much more profound effect on object astrometry and morphology @xcite .",
    "henceforth , we shall fix the release times of the charge trap species at @xmath30 and @xmath31  pixels , and also fix their relative densities to be 3.0:1 .",
    "fitting to earlier acs data yields consistent ( but noisier ) values of @xmath16 and the relative density .",
    "the total number of electrons that have been displaced from a packet originally containing @xmath32 electrons is the integral under the curve @xmath33~.\\ ] ] since we are assuming that any traps surrounded by free electrons are instantly filled , this number of trapped electrons equals the ( effective ) number of charge traps @xmath34 in the volume @xmath35 traversed by electrons between their original pixel and the readout register .",
    "the volume @xmath35 is the product of the distance @xmath18 to the readout register , the width of a pixel , and the height within a pixel filled by @xmath32 electrons , above a background level @xmath36 .",
    "warm pixels are available with a range of @xmath18 and @xmath32 and in images with a range of backgrounds @xmath36 ( this varies around @xmath37  e@xmath21 due to the angle between the telescope and the sun : @xcite ) . by counting the number of electrons trailed behind a variety of warm pixels",
    ", we directly measure @xmath38 .",
    "note that the interpretation of electrons filling pixels to a given height is instructive but not necessary : this function is precisely what we require .",
    "figure  [ fig : rawtrails ] shows the mean cti trail behind warm pixels at varying distances from the readout register and of varying warmth .",
    "the top - right panel reproduces figure  [ fig : onetrail ] .",
    "the other panels show trails behind different pixels within the same set of 20 images .",
    "although a busy plot , it has been simplified for illustration . for the real analysis , the number of bins was doubled in both @xmath18 and @xmath32 directions , and an additional dimension , with five bins of varying background level , has been marginalised over here . towards the left hand side ,",
    "the trails may be systematically underestimated due to the inclusion in our catalogue of read noise peaks .",
    "however , the efforts in  [ sec : warmpixels ] to exclude them have kept this small , as demonstrated by the still - recovered shape of the trails .",
    "each trail is fitted with double exponential decays ( [ eq : doubleexp ] ) , the integral under which gives the total number of trapped electrons , and hence the number of exposed traps @xmath34 .",

    "parameter @xmath44 is the full well depth , which we assume to be fixed at 84700  e@xmath21 even though it varies by a few thousand electrons across the device @xcite , and @xmath42 is the depth of the supplementary buried channel or `` notch '' in the ccds , which we fit .",
    "the notch is a small region at the bottom of a potential well used to gather electrons when only a small number are present , much like a narrow channel cut into the bed of a water drainage canal . in our model ,",
    "the notch has zero volume , so it merely adjusts the starting point of the power - law increase in height governed by @xmath40 .",

    "the cumulative number of traps increases linearly with that distance , implying that the traps are uniformly distributed throughout the ccd .",
    "the dashed curves show a model in which the electrons occupy zero volume within the ccd notch ( the depth of which is a free parameter ) , and increase as a power law of the number of electrons above it.,width=317 ]    we again use levenberg - marquardt least - squares minimization to fit the free parameters .",
    "we find that @xmath46 , consistent with a uniformly increasing number of traps with increasing distance from the readout register .",
    "since we would expect this behavior , we explicitly fix @xmath47 and then obtain best - fit values of @xmath48 , @xmath49  e@xmath21 and @xmath50  pixel@xmath51 , split between the two species of charge trap in a ratio of 3.0:1 .",
    "note that these errors do not include the uncertainty propagated from the measurement of the charge trap release times and density ratio .",
    "acs was installed on 7 march 2002 , and cumulative radiation damage since then has gradually created more charge traps .",
    "we can use the cosmos data , which was acquired uniformly over a long period , to track cti degradation . assuming that charge trap release times and the relative densities of the two species remain unchanged",
    ", we use the warmest pixels furthest from the readout register ( as in ",
    "[ sec : species ] ) to measure the density of charge traps @xmath43 at twelve additional times during the survey .    figure  [ fig : trapgrowth ] shows the measured increase in charge trap density over time .",
    "this is fit by a constant accumulation of @xmath52 traps per pixel per day , and an initial density on launch of @xmath53 traps per pixel ( although the formal error on the latter is probably an underestimate , since the extrapolated value is very sensitive to errors in the gradient ) .",
    "we also tried fitting a sawtooth model in which a fraction of the traps were removed during their first subsequent anneal ( as described by @xcite , the temperature is raised to @xmath54c about once a month ; the exact dates during cycles 12 and 13 are recorded in the appendix ) . @xcite and",

    "while hot pixels and charge traps are likely both a product of the same non - ionising energy loss and should accumulate at the same rate , @xcite find that traps are only effectively removed by annealing at temperatures above @xmath55c for e - centre traps and @xmath56c for divacancy traps .    )",
    "we now describe a software imitation of the hardware ccd readout , using the model developed in  [ sec : model ] .",
    "just like the real version on hst , our software uses a fairly simple algorithm to shuffle charge to an adjacent pixel , and this is repeated many times to complete a full readout . for convenience ,",
    "our code has a user interface written in idl , but for speed , the core is written in java .",
    "even so , the software algorithm is much slower than an on - board hardware readout , taking 25  minutes per @xmath57 acs / wfc image on a single 2  ghz processor , compared to 2.5  minutes on hst @xcite .",
    "however , it is trivially parallelisable for multiple exposures , and need ever be run only once on any given exposure .    since the mean density of charge traps @xmath43 is known , but their exact locations are not , traps are scattered at random 3d locations within the model silicon wafer .",
    "importantly , each trap is allocated a particular vertical height in some detector pixel .",
    "the occupancy of each will be continuously monitored .",
    "electrons are then added into the pixel array , in the numbers we think they were at the end of an exposure .",
    "a cloud of @xmath32 electrons is assumed to fill a pixel to a fractional height @xmath58 .",
    "any charge traps inside the occupied volume immediately capture one electron .",
    "all free electrons are then transferred instantaneously to their adjacent pixel ( or to the serial register for the last pixel in parallel array , or to the preamplifier from the last pixel of the serial register ) . as discussed in ",
    "[ sec : model ] , we do not attempt to model the three - phase clock cycle of a real ccd .",
    "finally , electrons inside traps are allowed to decay with probability @xmath59 .",
    "released electrons are returned to the free electron pool , and the process is repeated .",
    "shot noise in this model created ragged trails behind faint objects and amplified background noise fluctuations .",
    "we introduce two numerical schemes to ameliorate this .",
    "firstly , to counter the random release or non - release of electrons from charge traps , our model traps are allowed to contain fractional numbers of electrons . in this scheme ,",
    "each electron is gradually released in a floating - point exponential trail , until the trap is refilled to a whole electron by the passing of a new bright pixel ( removing only a fractional number of electrons from the free pool ) .",
    "after readout , the number of electrons in each pixel is rounded back to an integer value for storage .",
    "secondly , to counter the necessarily random locations of model traps , we can run the code multiple times with different random seeds and average the results . to save cpu time ,",
    "this is equivalently implemented by increasing the density of traps by a factor of 3 ( or any other number specified as an optional input parameter ) , each of which is only allowed to contain a third of an electron .",
    "this most improves the sampling of traps in the thin slice of the ccd above the image background level that profoundly affect faint sources . with both schemes ,",
    "the change in background noise level during readout becomes less than 1% .",
    "moving electrons back to where they belong , and thus removing the cti trails , requires the image mapping to be inverted .",
    "this is not analytically possible .",
