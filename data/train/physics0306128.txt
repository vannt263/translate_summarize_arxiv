    "[ see fig .",
    "[ fig : localupdates]a ) ] and hence a change of the local configuration is @xmath47 the number of such changes remains finite in the limit @xmath46 .",
    "the representation is thus well defined , and , equivalently , in eq .",
    "( [ eq : pert ] ) only a finite number of terms contributes in a finite system .    the second change concerns the updates , since the probability for the insertion of a pair of jumps in the world line [ the upper move in fig .",

    "one proposes to insert a pair of jumps not at a specific location but _ anywhere _ inside a finite time interval @xcite .",
    "the integrated probability then remains finite in the limit @xmath49 .",
    "similarly instead of shifting a jump by @xmath26 [ the lower move in figs . [ fig : localupdates]b , c ) ] we move it by a finite time interval in the continuous time algorithm .      an alternative monte carlo algorithm , which also does not suffer from time discretization , is the stochastic series expansion ( sse ) algorithm @xcite , a generalization of handscomb s algorithm @xcite for the heisenberg model .",
    "it starts from a taylor expansion of the partition function in orders of @xmath50 : @xmath51 where in the second line we decomposed the hamiltonian @xmath9 into a sum of single - bond terms @xmath52 , and again inserted complete sets of basis states .",
    "we end up with a similar representation as eq .",
    "( [ eq : suzuki ] ) and a related world - line picture with very similar update schemes . for more details of the sse method",
    "we refer to the contribution of a.w .",
    "sandvik in this proceedings volume .",
    "the sse representation can be formally related to the world line representation by observing that eq .",
    "( [ eq : sse ] ) is obtained from eq .",
    "( [ eq : pert ] ) by setting @xmath53 , @xmath54 and integrating over all times ( compare also fig .",
    "[ fig : sse ] ) @xmath55 @xcite .",
    "this mapping also shows the advantages and disadvantages of the two representations .",
    "the sse representation corresponds to a perturbation expansion in all terms of the hamiltonian , whereas world line algorithms treat the diagonal terms in @xmath42 exactly and perturb only in the offdiagonal terms @xmath43 of the hamiltonian .",
    "world line algorithms hence need only fewer terms in the expansion , but pay for it by having to deal with imaginary times @xmath55 . the sse representation is thus preferred except for models with large diagonal terms ( e.g. bosonic hubbard models ) or for models with time - dependent actions ( e.g. dissipative quantum systems @xcite ) .",
    "while the local update world line and sse algorithms enable the simulation of quantum systems they suffer from critical slowing down at second order phase transitions .",
    "even worse , changing the spatial and temporal winding numbers has an exponentially small acceptance rate . while the restriction to zero spatial winding can be viewed as a boundary effect , changing the temporal winding number and thus the magnetization or particle number is essential for simulations in the grand canonical ensemble .",
    "the solution to these problems came with the loop algorithm @xcite and its continuous time version @xcite .",
    "these algorithms , generalizations of the classical cluster algorithms @xcite to quantum systems , not only solve the problem of critical slowing down , but also updates the winding numbers efficiently for those systems to which it can be applied .        since there is an extensive recent review of the loop algorithm @xcite , we will only mention the main idea behind the loop algorithm here . in the classical swendsen - wang cluster algorithm",
    "each bond in the lattice is considered , and with a probability depending on the local configuration two neighboring spins are either `` connected '' or left `` disconnected '' , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : clusters]a ) .",
    "`` connected '' spins form a cluster and must be flipped together .",
    "since the average extent of these cluster is just the correlation length of the system , updates are performed on physically relevant length scales and autocorrelation times are substantially reduced .        upon applying the same idea to world lines in qmc",
    "we have to take into account that ( in systems with particle number or magnetization conservation ) the world lines may not be broken .",
    "this implies that a single spin on a plaquette can not be flipped by itself , but at least two , or all four spins must be flipped in order to create valid updates of the world line configurations . instead of the two possibilities `` connected '' or `` disconnected '' , four connections are possible on a plaquette , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : clusters]b ) : either horizontal neighbors , vertical neighbors , diagonal neighbors or all four spins might be flipped together .",
    "the specific choices and probabilities depend , like in the classical algorithm , on details of the model and the world line configuration .",
    "since each spin is connected to two ( or four ) other spins , the cluster has a loop - like shape ( or a set of connected loops ) , which is the origin of the name `` loop algorithm '' and is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : loopupdate ] .",
    "while the loop algorithm was originally developed only for six - vertex and spin-1/2 models @xcite it has been generalized to higher spin models @xcite , anisotropic spin models @xcite , hubbard @xcite and @xmath35-@xmath36 models @xcite .      out of the large number of applications of the loop algorithm we want to mention only a few",
    "which highlight the advances made possible by the development of this algorithm and refer to ref .",
    "@xcite for a more complete overview .    *",
    "the first application of the discrete and continuous time loop algorithms @xcite were high accuracy simulations of the ground state parameteres of the square lattice heisenberg antiferromagnet , establishing beyond any doubt the existence of nel order even for spin @xmath56 . * the exponential divergence of the correlation length in the same system",
    "could be studied on much larger systems with up to one million spins @xcite and with much higher accuracy than in previous simulations @xcite , investigating not only the leading exponential behavior but also higher order corrections . * for quantum phase transitions in two - dimensional quantum heisenberg antiferromagnets , simulations using local updates had been restricted to small systems with up to 200 spins at not too low temperatures and had given contradicting results regarding the universality class of the phase transitions @xcite .",
    "the loop algorithm enabled simulations on up to one hundred times larger systems at ten times lower temperatures , allowing the accurate determination of the critical behavior at quantum phase transitions @xcite . * similarly , in the two - dimensional quantum @xmath57 model the loop algorithm allowed accurate simulations of the kosterlitz - thouless phase transition @xcite , again improving on results obtained using local updates @xcite . * in su(4 ) square lattice antiferromagnets , the loop algorithm could clarify that a spin liquid state thought to be present based on data obtained using local update algorithms on small lattices @xcite is actually nel ordered @xcite . * a generalization , which allows to study infinite systems in the absence of long range order ,",
    "was invented @xcite . *",
    "the meron cluster algorithm , an algorithm based on the loop algorithm , solves the negative sign problem in some special systems @xcite .",
    "as successful as the loop algorithm is , it is restricted  as the classical cluster algorithms  to models with spin inversion symmetry ( or particle - hole symmetry ) .",
    "terms in the hamiltonian which break this spin - inversion symmetry  such as a magnetic field in a spin model or a chemical potential in a particle model  are not taken into account during loop construction .",
    "instead they enter through the acceptance rate of the loop flip , which can be exponentially small at low temperatures .    .",

    "this move costs potential energy @xmath66 and thus has an _ exponentially small acceptance rate _ @xmath67 .",
    "once we accept this move , immediately many small loops are built , exchanging the spins on the two sites , and gaining exchange energy @xmath66 by going to the spin singlet state . a typical world line configuration for the singlet is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : loopfield]d ) .",
    "the reverse move has the same exponentially small probability , since the probability to reach a world line configuration without any exchange term [ fig .",
    "[ fig : loopfield]c ) ] from a spin singlet configuration [ fig .",
    "[ fig : loopfield]d ) ] is exponentially small .",
    "this example clearly illustrates the reason for the exponential slowdown : in a first step we _ lose all potential energy _ ,",
    "before _ gaining it back in exchange energy_. a faster algorithm could thus be built if , instead of doing the trade in one big step , we could trade potential with exchange energy in small pieces , which is exactly what the worm algorithm does .",
    "the worm algorithm @xcite works in an extended configuration space , where in addition to closed world line configurations one open world line fragment ( the `` worm '' ) is allowed .",
    "formally this is done by adding a source term to the hamiltonian which for a spin model is @xmath68 this source term allows world lines to be broken with a matrix element proportional to @xmath69 .",
    "the worm algorithm now proceeds as follows : a worm ( i.e. a world line fragment ) is created by inserting a pair @xmath70 of operators at nearby times , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : worm]a , b ) .",
    "the ends of this worm are then moved randomly in space and time [ fig .",
    "[ fig : worm]c ) ] , using local metropolis or heat bath updates until the two ends of the worm meet again as in fig .",
    "[ fig : worm]d ) . then an update which removes the worm",
    "is proposed , and if accepted we are back in a configuration with closed world lines only , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : worm]e ) .",
    "this algorithm is straightforward , consisting just of local updates of the worm ends in the extended configuration space but it can perform nonlocal changes .",
    "a worm end can wind around the lattice in the temporal or spatial direction and that way change the magnetization and winding number .    .",
    "a ) starting from the triplet configuration @xmath58 a worm is constructed in b ) by inserting a pair of @xmath71 and @xmath72 operators .",
    "c ) these `` worm end '' operators are then moved by local updates until d ) they meet again , when a move to remove them is proposed , which leads to the closed world line configuration e ) . as in the two previous figures a thick line denotes an up - spin and a thin line a down - spin . ,",
    "height=188 ]    in contrast to the loop algorithm in a magnetic field , where the trade between potential and exchange energy is done by first losing all of the potential energy , before gaining back the exchange energy , the worm algorithm performs this trade in small pieces , never suffering from an exponentially small acceptance probability . while not being as efficient as the loop algorithm in zero magnetic field ( the worm movement follows a random walk while the loop algorithm can be interpreted as a self - avoiding random walk ) , the big advantage of the worm algorithm is that it remains efficient in the presence of a magnetic field .",
    "a similar algorithm was already proposed more than a decade earlier @xcite . instead of a random walk using fulfilling detailed balance at every move of the worm head in this earlier algorithm just performed a random walk .",
    "the _ a posteriori _ acceptance rates are then often very small and the algorithm is not efficient , just as the small acceptance rates for loop updates in magnetic fields make the loop algorithm inefficient .",
    "this highlights the importance of having the cluster - building rules of a non - local update algorithm closely tied to the physics of the problem .",
    "algorithms with a similar basic idea are the operator - loop update @xcite in the sse formulation and the directed - loop algorithms @xcite which can be formulated in both an sse and a world - line representation . like the worm algorithm ,",
    "these algorithms create two world line discontinuities , and move them around by local updates .",
    "the main difference to the worm algorithm is that here these movements do not follow an unbiased random walk but have a preferred direction , always trying to move away from the last change .",
    "the directed loop algorithms might thus be more efficient than the worm algorithm but no direct comparison has been performed so far . for more details",
    "see the contribution of a.w .",
    "sandvik in this volume .      just as the loop algorithm enabled a break - through in the simulation of quantum magnets in zero magnetic field , the worm and directed loop algorithms allowed simulations of bosonic systems with better efficiency and accuracy .",
    "a few examples include :    * simulations of quantum phase transitions in soft - core bosonic systems , both for uniform models @xcite and in magnetic traps @xcite . * by being able to simulate substantially larger latttices than by local updates @xcite the existence of supersolids in hard - core boson models was clarified @xcite and the ground - state @xcite and finite - temperature phase diagrams @xcite of two - dimensional hard - core boson models have been determined . * magnetization curves of quantum magnets have been calculated @xcite .",
    "the main problem during the simulation of a first order phase transition is the exponentially slow tunneling time between the two coexisting phases . for classical simulations the multi - canonical algorithm @xcite and",
    "recently the wang - landau algorithm @xcite eases this tunneling by reweighting configurations such as to achieve a `` flat histogram '' in energy space . in a canonical simulation the probability of visiting an energy level @xmath73 is @xmath74 where the density of states @xmath75 is the number of states with energy @xmath73 .",
    "while the multi - canonical algorithm @xcite changes the canonical distribution @xmath76 by reweighting it in an energy - dependent way , the algorithm by wang and landau discards the notion of temperature and directly uses the density of states to set @xmath77 , which gives a constant probability in energy space @xmath78 . the unknown quantity @xmath75 is determined self - consistently in an iterative way and then allows to directly calculate the free energy @xmath79 and other thermodynamic quantities at any temperature .",
    "the main change to a simulation program using a canonical distribution is to replace the canonical probability @xmath80 by the inverse density of states @xmath81 .",
    "this algorithm can not be straightforwardly used for quantum systems , since the density of states @xmath75 is not directly accessible for those .",
    "instead we recently proposed @xcite to start from the sse formulation of the partition function eq .",
    "( [ eq : sse ] ) : @xmath82 the coefficient @xmath83 of the @xmath84-th order term in an expansion in the inverse temperature @xmath50 now plays the role of the density of states @xmath75 in the classical algorithm .",
    "similar to the classical algorithm , by using @xmath85 as the probability of a configuration instead of the usual sse weight , a flat histogram in the order @xmath84 of the series is achieved .",
    "alternatively instead of such a high - temperature expansion a finite - temperature perturbation series can be formulated @xcite .",
    "this algorithm was shown to be effective at first order phase transitions in quantum systems and promises to be effective also for the simulation of quantum spin glasses .",
    "since there is no `` best algorithm '' suitable for all problems we conclude with a guide on how to pick the best algorithm for a particular problem .    * for models with particle - hole or spin - inversion symmetry a loop algorithm is optimal @xcite .",
    "usually an sse representation @xcite will be preferred unless the action is time - dependent ( such as long - range in time interactions in a dissipative quantum system ) or there are large diagonal terms , in which case a world line representation is better . * for models without particle hole symmetry a worm or directed - loop algorithm is the best choice : * * if the hamiltonian is diagonally dominant use a worm @xcite or directed loop @xcite algorithm in a world line representation . *",
