    "witten s open cubic string field theory @xcite is usually formulated in terms of @xmath2-string gluing vertices @xcite .",
    "the expressions for these vertices in the basis which diagonalizes @xmath5 lead to complicated calculations . using the fact that @xmath6 commutes with witten s vertex , rastelli et al .",
    "@xcite transformed it to the basis with @xmath7 diagonal .",
    "they found that the neumann matrices in the zero momentum vertex take a simple diagonal form in this basis .",
    "further it was realized that many calculations in the string field theory which looks complicated in the @xmath5-basis can be done easily and analytically in the @xmath7-basis .",
    "using their technique @xcite the succeeding authors generalized their result to including momenta @xcite , ghosts @xcite , background @xmath8-field @xcite and fermions @xcite .",
    "however all of these calculation were intrinsically indirect .",
    "recently the authors of @xcite formulated a simple and direct method of changing the basis .",
    "this method is so powerful that it allowed them to diagonalize at once @xmath2-string neumann matrices for all scale dimensions in the matter sector , @xmath1-string neumann matrices for @xmath9 and @xmath0 ghosts , and to resolve the momentum difficulty .",
    "however unlike all other cases the @xmath1-string @xmath0-ghost s vertex was diagonalized indirectly by relating it to the @xmath10-string matter neumann matrices @xcite .",
    "the present paper has three aims .",
    "firstly , we diagonalize the @xmath1-string @xmath0-ghost vertex by directly changing the basis in its neumann functions .",
    "secondly , we consider the general bosonized ghost system @xcite which is characterized by the background charge @xmath11 and the parity @xmath12 .",
    "we find an expression for the @xmath2-string gluing vertex of this system in the @xmath7-basis .",
    "then we show that ghost numbers can be added to the vertex by a unitary transformation , and discuss the differences of this construction from the one for the matter sector @xcite .",
    "thirdly , we test the descent relations @xmath13 and other associativity relations for the combined bosonic matter+ghost gluing vertex @xmath14 .",
    "the need to verify them arises from several inconsistencies in the calculations performed in the past two years .",
    "first , there is a strange anomaly in the multiplication of the wedge states @xmath15 @xcite [ eq .",
    "( 5.40 ) therein ] .",
    "second , the direct calculation of the inner product of two wedges @xmath16 differs from the expected unity @xcite .",
    "this result is in contradiction with the statement of @xcite [ eq .",
    "( 5.59 ) therein ] . and",
    "third , assuming that the descent relation are true for the vertices defined in @xcite the authors of @xcite find some contradictions in their calculations [ compare eqs .",
    "( 3.34 ) and ( 3.38 ) therein ] . in the present paper",
    "we show that for critical bosonic string there is a finite constant @xmath17 in the rhs of the descent relation .",
    "this constant can be written as @xmath18 where the function @xmath3 is @xmath19^{9/2}\\ , \\exp\\biggl\\{\\frac{27}{2}\\bigl[d_0(n)-d_0(2)\\bigr]\\biggr\\}.\\ ] ] the explicit expression for @xmath20 is given in the text of this paper . here",
    "one only needs to know that for @xmath21 it monotonically increases , and goes to zero as @xmath22 .",
    "now it is obvious that in order to satisfy the descent relation one has to normalize the vertices by @xmath23 we also verify that the normalized vertices satisfy all other associativity conditions .",
    "notice that for @xmath24 the normalization @xmath25 equals 1 , therefore the string inner product is not affected by .",
    "the function @xmath25 is nothing else but the partition function of the matter+ghost cft on the gluing surface , which is the unit disk with neumann boundary conditions and midpoint cone like singularity specifying by the angle excess @xmath4 .",
    "for @xmath26 the vertex normalized as in eq .",
    "coincides with witten s original definition @xcite . in that paper",
    "he defined it as the polyakov integral over the gluing surface .",

    "so we need to calculate the following product @xmath274 the inner product in the @xmath275 tensor component is easy to calculate :    @xmath276,\\end{gathered}\\ ] ]    where @xmath277 .",
    "it is a matter of simple algebra to show that the term in @xmath278 equals @xmath279 .",
    "hence we see that the descent relation is actually satisfied up to a numeric coefficient @xmath280 where @xmath281 and @xmath263 is defined in . in other words",
    "@xmath282 is @xmath283 where @xmath284 is the trace density which was calculated in @xcite @xmath285 \\\\ -\\frac{1}{4\\pi } \\biggl[\\psi\\bigl(1+\\frac{i\\kappa}{2}\\bigr)+\\psi\\bigl(1-\\frac{i\\kappa}{2}\\bigr ) + 2\\gamma_e\\biggr].\\end{gathered}\\ ] ] from this it follows that @xmath286 .",
    "if the descent relation were true , all @xmath17 with @xmath287 would be @xmath71 .",
    "but as we will see in a moment @xmath17 is a nontrivial function of @xmath2 , and therefore the vertices must contain an additional normalization factor .    for the critical bosonic string ( @xmath288 , @xmath289 and @xmath69 ) @xmath17 is a finite function of @xmath2 @xmath290 where @xmath291 , @xmath292 and @xmath293 the details of this calculation will be presented in @xcite . from the representation",
    "it follows that @xmath17 can be written as @xmath294 here the logarithm of @xmath3 is given by @xmath295 .",
    "\\label{zcn}\\ ] ] notice that the function @xmath25 can _ not _ be uniquely determined from the relation .",
    "it is defined up to a rescaling @xmath296 the function @xmath3 defined in monotonically goes to zero on the interval @xmath297 , and its asymptotic at infinity is @xmath298^{9/2}\\ , \\exp\\biggl\\{-\\frac{27}{2 } d_0(2)+o\\bigl(\\frac{1}{n}\\bigr)\\biggr\\}.\\ ] ]    now it is obvious that in order to have the descent relation one has to introduce the normalized gluing vertices @xmath299 , which are defined by @xmath300 the normalization @xmath25 is given by or any of . notice that @xmath301 independently on the choice of the scaling factor in .",
    "the ambiguity is closely related to the string field redefinition .",
    "indeed the factor @xmath302 in the vertex can be cancelled by simultaneous rescaling of the string field @xmath303 and the coupling constant @xmath304 .",
    "the natural choice of the factor in is that where @xmath25 coincides with the partition function of the bosonic matter+ghost cft on the gluing surface , which is the unit disk with neumann boundary conditions and the angle excess @xmath4 .",
    "this choice is basically follows from the relation @xmath305 where @xmath299 is supposed to be a surface ( multi)state , and therefore the rhs must be the partition function of this surface [ see figure  5 in @xcite ] .    for @xmath26 the normalized as in eq . @xmath1-string vertex coincides with witten s original definition @xcite . in that paper",
    "he defined it as the polyakov integral over the gluing surface which , of course , includes the partition function in its definition .",
    "notice that in moyal formulation of sft ( msft ) @xcite the star product is associative by construction and there is a way to obtain the neumann matrix elements from it @xcite",
    ". therefore it should be also possible to extract the normalization of the gluing vertices and compare them with @xmath25 .",
    "the associativity requires many relations between the gluing vertices .",
    "for example , @xmath306 and many many more .",
    "the question is if these relations are satisfied for the normalized vertices .",
    "actually the question is only about the normalization factors , since the exponentials were worked out in @xcite .",
    "we claim that the normalized vertices indeed satisfy the relations like .",
    "the proof is simple and does not require complicated calculations . let us prove , for example , the first relation in .",
    "suppose that it is false , and there is a constant @xmath307 in the rhs : @xmath308 now we contract this equation with the identity state @xmath309 in the @xmath10-th tensorial space .",
    "using the descent relations we obtain @xmath310 noticing that @xmath311 one finds that the constant @xmath312 equals @xmath71 .",
    "so the first relation in is true .",
    "actually all relations like can be proved in this manner .",
    "therefore the normalized vertices _ do _ satisfy the associativity relations .",
    "here i want to discuss some consequences of the normalization for the numeric calculations of the tachyon condensation @xcite .",
    "first , the calculations in which one uses only vertices @xmath313 and @xmath314 ( see for example @xcite ) are _ not _ affected by the normalization .",
    "one can simply cancel the factor @xmath315 in the cubic vertex by simultaneous rescaling of the string field and the coupling constant as @xmath316 and @xmath317 correspondingly .",
    "however the calculations in the bosonic string which involve the higher vertices ( if any were done ) have to be revised .",
    "second , the fact that @xmath318 ( @xmath319 and @xmath320 ) for the bosonic string may potentially affect the numeric calculations in the nonpolynomial fermionic string field theory ( see for example @xcite ) . to check",
    "this one has to calculate the contribution of the matter fermions and superghosts into the partition function @xmath25 .",
    "for the same reason as for the bosonic cubic sft the calculations in the cubic fermionic string field theory ( see for example @xcite ) are not affected .",
