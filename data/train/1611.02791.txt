    "the rosenblatt and the generalized rosenblatt processes are of interest because they are the simplest extension to the non - gaussian world of the gaussian fractional brownian motion .",

    "it follows from @xcite that the generalized rosenblatt process @xmath19 is also self - similar with stationary increments with self - similarity parameter @xmath34 we get @xmath24 because @xmath35 imply @xmath36 and @xmath37 implies @xmath38 .",
    "fractional brownian motion and the generalized rosenblatt process @xmath19 belong to a broad class of self - similar processes with stationary increments defined on a wiener chaos called _ generalized hermite processes_. the generalized hermite processes appear as limits in various types of non - central limit theorems involving volterra - type nonlinear process .",
    "in particular , the generalized rosenblatt process @xmath19 can arise as limit when considering a quadratic form involving two long - memory linear processes with different memory parameters .",

    "we give two different proofs of this convergence , one based on the method of moments , and one which provides more intuitive insight .",
    "we also give the rate of convergence to the marginal distribution in the preceding two cases .",
    "the situation at the corners is particularly delicate . at the corner @xmath45 , the limit process is a linear combination of two independent degenerate chi - square processes . at the other two corners ,",
    "the limit is a linear combination of two processes : a brownian motion and the product of another brownian motion times an independent gaussian random variable .",
    "these linear combinations , which depend on the direction at which the critical exponents approach the corners , will be given explicitly .",
    "we also show that the convergences mentioned can not be strengthened from weak convergence to @xmath1 convergence , nor even to convergence in probability .",
