    "the distribution of wealth or income in society has been of great interest for many years . as first noticed by pareto in the 1890 s @xcite",
    ", the wealth distribution seems to follow a `` natural law '' where the tail of the distribution is described by a power - law @xmath2 .",
    "away from the tail , the distribution is better described by a gamma or log - normal distribution known as gibrat s law @xcite .",
    "considerable investigation with real data during the last ten years revealed that the power - law tail exhibits a remarkable spatial and temporal stability and the pareto index @xmath3 is found to have a value between @xmath4 and @xmath5 @xcite .",
    "even after 110 years the origin of the power - law tail remained unexplained but recent interest of physicists and mathematicians in econophysics has led to a new insight into this problem ( see refs .",

    "our general aim is to study a many - agent statistical model of closed economy ( analogous to the kinetic theory model of ideal gases ) @xcite , where @xmath6 agents exchange a quantity @xmath7 , that may be defined as wealth .",
    "the states of agents are characterized by the wealth @xmath8 , and the total wealth @xmath9 is conserved .",
    "the evolution of the system is then carried out according to a prescription , which defines the trading rule between agents .",
    "these many - agent statistical models have @xmath6 basic units @xmath10 , interacting with each other through a pair - wise interaction characterized by a saving parameter @xmath1 , with @xmath11 .",
    "we define the equilibrium distribution of wealth @xmath12 as follows : @xmath13 is the probability that in the steady state of the system , a randomly chosen agent will be found to have wealth between @xmath7 and @xmath14 . in these models ,",
    "if @xmath1 is equal for all the units , @xmath12 is fitted quite well by a gamma - distribution @xcite @xmath15 where @xmath16 this equilibrium distribution had been suggested by an analogy with the kinetic theory of gases in @xmath17 dimensions @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we show by the method of moment calculations that the resulting wealth distribution can not be the gamma distribution that was conjectured in ref .",

    "the states of agents are characterized by the wealth @xmath8 , and the total wealth @xmath9 is conserved .",
    "the evolution of the system is then carried out according to a prescription , which defines the trading rule between agents . at every time step",
    "two agents @xmath18 and @xmath19 are extracted randomly and an amount of wealth @xmath20 is exchanged between them , @xmath21 it can be noticed that in this way , the quantity @xmath7 is conserved during the single transactions : @xmath22 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : exchange ] ) , where @xmath23 and @xmath24 are the agent wealths after the transaction has taken place .",
    "several simple models dealing with different transaction rules have been studied ( see the reviews @xcite and references therein ) . here",
    "we will present a few examples .      in the first version of the model , the wealth difference @xmath20 is assumed to have a constant value @xcite , @xmath25 this rule , together with the constraint that transactions can take place only if @xmath26 and @xmath27 , provides a boltzmann distribution , see the curve for @xmath28 in fig .",
    "[ fig : gamma ] .",
    "alternatively , @xmath20 can be a random fraction of the wealth of one of the two agents , @xmath29 where @xmath30 is a random number uniformly distributed between 0 and 1 .",
    "a trading rule based on the random redistribution of the sum of the wealths of the two agents had been introduced by dragulescu and yakovenko @xcite , @xmath31 equations ( [ basic1 ] ) are easily shown to correspond to the trading rule ( [ basic0 ] ) , with @xmath32 all the versions of the basic model lead to an equilibrium boltzmann distribution , given by @xmath33 where the effective temperature of the system is just the average wealth @xmath34 @xcite . the result ( [ bd ] )",
    "is found to be robust ; it is largely independent of various factors .",
    "namely , it is obtained for the various forms of @xmath20 mentioned above , for a pair - wise as well as multi - agent interactions , for arbitrary initial conditions @xcite , and finally , for random or consecutive extraction of the interacting agents . for the trading rule",

    "this can be practically achieved by defining a saving propensity @xmath11 , which represents the fraction of wealth which is saved  and not reshuffled  during a transaction .",

    "( [ gamman ] ) on the basis of an analogy with the kinetic theory of gases .",
    "indeed , it is easy to show , starting from the maxwell - boltzmann distribution for the particle velocity in a @xmath41 dimensional gas , that the equilibrium kinetic energy distribution coincides with the gamma - distribution with @xmath42 .",
    "this conjecture is remarkably consistent with the fitting provided to numerical data @xcite . in the following section we will show by two different approaches that the conjecture can not be the actual equilibrium distribution .",
    "let @xmath43 be a random variable which stands for the wealth of one agent , at equilibrium and in the limit of an infinite number of agents , we can say from eq . that the law of @xmath43 @xmath44 , is a fixed - point distribution of the equation @xmath45 where @xmath46 means identity in distribution and one assumes that the random variables @xmath47 and @xmath43 have the same probability law , while the variables @xmath47 and @xmath30 are stochastically independent .",

    "one can write immediately @xmath48 and by developing one can find the recursive relation @xmath49 using with initial conditions @xmath50 ( normalization ) and @xmath51 ( without loss of generality ) , we obtain @xmath52 now let us compare theses moments with conjecture s moments . setting @xmath53 in eq .",
    "it is easy to show @xmath54 writing for @xmath55 and choosing @xmath56 as in we find @xmath57 the fourths moments ( eqs . and )",
    "are different so the conjecture that the gamma distribution is an equilibrium solution of this model is wrong .",
    "nevertheless the first three moments coincide exactly which shows that the gamma - distribution is strangely a very good approximation .",
    "moreover the deviation in the fourth moment is very small ( see fig .",
    "[ fourth ] , which shows that the two curves can hardly be distinguished by the naked eye ) .    .",
    "the inset shows the relative difference between exact fourth moment eq . and gamma distribution fourth moment eq . against @xmath1 .",
    "]    finding a function that would coincide to higher moments is still an open challenge .",
    "these results are consistent with the ones found by repetowicz et al .",
    "@xcite which will be presented in the following section .      in this section",
    "we will confirm the previous result with a different approach based on the boltzmann equation and along the lines of bassetti et al .",
    "@xcite . given a fixed number of @xmath6 agents in a system , which are allowed to trade , the interaction rules describe a stochastic process of the vector variable @xmath58 in discrete time @xmath59 .",
    "processes of this type are thoroughly studied e.g. in the context of kinetic theory of ideal gases . indeed , if the variables @xmath60 are interpreted as energies corresponding to the @xmath18-th particle , one can map the process to the mean - field limit of the maxwell model of particles undergoing random elastic collisions . the full information about the process in time @xmath59 is contained in the @xmath6-particle joint probability distribution @xmath61 .",
    "however , one can write a kinetic equation for one - marginal distribution function @xmath62 involving only one- and two - particle distribution functions @xmath63 \\bigg \\rangle,\\end{gathered}\\ ] ] which may be continued to give eventually an infinite hierarchy of equations of bbgky ( born , bogoliubov , green , kirkwood , yvon ) type @xcite . the standard approximation , which neglects the correlations between the wealth of the agents induced by the trade gives the factorization @xmath64 which implies a closure of the hierarchy at the lowest level .",
    "in fact , this approximation becomes exact in the thermodynamic limit ( @xmath65 ) .",
    "therefore , the one - particle distribution function bears all information .",
    "rescaling the time as @xmath66 in the thermodynamic limit @xmath65 , one obtains for the one - particle distribution function @xmath67 the boltzmann - type kinetic equation @xmath68 this equation can be written ( see matthes et al .",
    "@xcite ) as @xmath69 where @xmath70 is a _ collision operator_. a collision operator is bilinear and satisfies , for all smooth functions @xmath71 @xmath72 where @xmath23 and @xmath24 are the post - trade wealth . with this property",
    "the equation can be written in the weak form , for all smooth functions @xmath71 @xmath73 it is very useful because the choice @xmath74 gives ( after some calculations ) the boltzmann equation for the laplace transform @xmath75 of @xmath44 @xmath76 for the steady state , and if @xmath30 is drawn randomly from a uniform distribution , the previous equation reduces to @xmath77 which coincides with results of @xcite .",
    "the taylor expansion of @xmath78 can be derived by substituting the expansion @xmath79 in .",
    "since @xmath80 is the moment - generating function we have @xmath81 . with this method repetowicz et al . @xcite obtained the recursive formula @xmath82 with @xmath83 @xmath84 @xmath85 now with this formula one can obtain the first four moments and they match the ones found in the previous section eqs.(14 - 16 ) , which confirms that the gamma - distribution is not the stationary distribution .",
    "from equation @xmath86 we have for all @xmath87 @xmath88 = \\mathbb{p}[\\lambda x_i + \\epsilon(1-\\lambda)(x_i+x_j ) \\leq x],\\ ] ] where @xmath89 $ ] means the probability of the event inside the brackets .",

    "hence we get @xmath98        this immediately gives @xmath99 where @xmath100 we assume that @xmath44 decays fast enough near 0 so that the integral in is well defined .",
    "now may be rewritten by rescaling the variable , as @xmath101 we now use the observation that for @xmath36 the numerically determined @xmath12 is a continuous function with a single maximum , say at @xmath102 ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : gamma ] ) .",
    "then for all @xmath103 , the integrand takes its maximum value at the right extreme point , i.e. when @xmath104 .",
