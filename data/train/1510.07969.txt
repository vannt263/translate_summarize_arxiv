    "frustrated quantum antiferromagnets continue to provide opportunities for the investigation of new states of matter and therefore are still nowadays the object of intense experimental and theoretical effort.@xcite the interplay of frustration and quantum fluctuations can determine dramatic effects on the ground state of spin systems compared to the simple classical picture .",
    "the suppression of dipolar magnetic order in favor of spin liquid states@xcite or multipolar order such as the spin nematic state@xcite is perhaps the most striking phenomenon ; however , there are also interesting situations such that an order of magnetic moments can be stabilized in the ground state , which does not have an analog in the ground state phase diagram of related classical systems.@xcite also , it is well understood that phase transition lines in frustrated systems are more subject to large quantum correction , especially due to degeneracy or quasi - degeneracy in the energy landscape .",
    "the triangular heisenberg antiferromagnet is perhaps the most studied theoretical model in the field . a lot of its features",
    "have been understood over the years , including the removal of classical degeneracies by quantum or thermal fluctuations and its signature one - third magnetization plateau.@xcite one of the most natural extensions of this model consists in the introduction of anisotropy in spin space , in the form of xxz anisotropy,@xcite namely a difference between the @xmath5 coupling @xmath6 and the ising coupling @xmath7 [ see eq .",
    "( [ hamiltonian ] ) ] , which is in general induced in real materials by a combination of crystal field and spin - orbit coupling .",
    "recently there has been a remarkable revival of the triangular xxz model , especially due to very interesting experimental works on ba@xmath0cosb@xmath1o@xmath2.@xcite this compound is particularly attracting because it features a stack of geometrically almost perfect triangular lattices made of co@xmath8 ions , which in the presence of trigonal crystal field and spin - orbit coupling carry an effective spin @xmath9 at temperatures well below the scale set by the spin - orbit coupling,@xcite in this case about 250 k. besides , the highly symmetric crystal structure forbids dzyaloshinsky - moriya interaction up to the third - nearest neighbor in the plane and between any pair of spins along the @xmath10 axis .",
    "magnetic ordering is observed below 3.8 k. electron spin resonance@xcite and , very recently , inelastic neutron scattering@xcite experiments also provided evidence for xxz anisotropy of the easy - plane type , as well as a small nearest - neighbor interlayer exchange coupling ( a few percent of the intralayer one ) .",
    "currently ba@xmath0cosb@xmath1o@xmath2 is believed to be a very good physical realization of the xxz model on a vertically stacked triangular lattice ( the importance of the interlayer coupling , however small , has been highlighted in refs .  ) ; this is strongly supported by the agreement between the magnetization process in longitudinal and transverse magnetic field and the model calculation.@xcite however , we can not exclude that a refinement of the theoretical model should be pursued to explain further experimental results.@xcite    this line of research is being expanded to other compounds with identical or very similar structure , such as ba@xmath0ninb@xmath1o@xmath2 ( @xmath11)@xcite , ba@xmath0conb@xmath1o@xmath2 ( @xmath9)@xcite , ba@xmath0mnnb@xmath1o@xmath2 ( @xmath12)@xcite and ba@xmath0nisb@xmath1o@xmath2 ( @xmath11).@xcite while in general all these materials feature magnetic ions occupying the sites of triangular lattice layers which are arranged in a simple aa type of stacking , it becomes interesting to understand how various details of the single material , such as the value of @xmath3 , the dimensionality ( strength of the interlayer coupling ) , certain spin anisotropies , etc . , influence the actual observations .",
    "the latest theoretical works@xcite thoroughly mapped out the magnetic phase diagram of the spin 1/2 triangular xxz model , pointing out numerous interesting features ( see fig .",
    "[ classquantpd ] ) . among these , in the case of the purely two - dimensional model in longitudinal applied field , the extension of the one - third magnetization plateau phase to the easy - plane region up to @xmath13 ( or more according to ref .  ) ; the possibility of a new coplanar phase ( named @xmath14-coplanar or @xmath15 ) emerging from a peculiar lifting of the classical ground - state degeneracy ; the presence of a tricritical point along the transition line between the plateau and the high field @xmath16-coplanar ( or v ) state , which changes from second to first order going towards the ising limit at about @xmath17 . in the case of layered systems in a transverse applied field , the appearance of a new first - order phase transition in the easy - plane region at about 70% of the saturation magnetization , which is induced by any small but non - vanishing antiferromagnetic interlayer exchange coupling .    in case of larger but finite spin , @xmath18",
    ", it is naturally expected that the effect of quantum fluctuation will be milder , although it is in general difficult to quantify this expectation and not many studies can be found in literature ; besides , a considerable part of them concentrates on the isotropic ( heisenberg ) model .",
    "in fact , for this model there is quite a clear understanding of how the one - third magnetization plateau shrinks as a function of @xmath3 .",
    "@xcite other studies based on the @xmath4 expansion@xcite give us information about the generically anisotropic model in a longitudinal high magnetic field and find that the phase diagram in that region is qualitatively the same as the one found in ref .",
    "for @xmath9 . on these grounds and",
    "assuming some more analogy with the @xmath9 case , in fig  [ classquantpd ] ( middle panel ) we draw a sketch of how the phase diagram of the purely two - dimesional model in longitudinal field should look like for a fixed finite spin @xmath3 . such a sketch is meant to illustrate the picture that is currently available , but clearly it should be taken with a certain amount of caution . in particular",
    "we remind that the tricritical point in the easy - axis region has been confirmed so far only for @xmath9 , so that it can either disappear continuously for @xmath19 or at some critical value of @xmath3 .",
    "also , let us mention that ref .",
    ", based on exact diagonalization of the @xmath9 model , claims that the @xmath14-coplanar state corresponds to a spurious phase which is present in finite - size calculations and disappears in the thermodynamic limit ; however , a more thorough analysis of the exact diagonalization data in the three - magnon sector shows that the spurious phase is actually a chirally symmetric combination of finite - size umbrella states , while the lowest eigenstate in the coplanar region is always doubly degenerate.@xcite    ; in particular , the umbrella - coplanar transition point at saturation , @xmath20 , is shifted to the easy - plane region by quantum fluctuations .",
    "`` tcp '' stands for tricritical point .",

    "[ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]      in general the interlayer exchange coupling , however small , is important to determine the ground state of layered frustrated magnets , as emphasized in ref .   for the particular case of the triangular xxz model in a transverse field .",
    "in this section , we aim to analyze quantitatively the combined effect of antiferromagnetic interlayer coupling and intralayer spin anisotropy on the umbrella - coplanar transition of the triangular xxz model in longitudinal field just below saturation . here the umbrella and coplanar states have to be intended as associated with a well - defined stacking pattern dictated by the antiferromagnetic coupling , as depicted in fig .",
    "[ pdanisinter ] , where the primed ( non - primed ) indices refer to the even ( odd ) layers .    since the system is three - dimensional , there are no issues related to the infrared divergences discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec : bseq ] and the calculation is essentially the same as in ref .  .",
    "here we extend it systematically to a wide range of the parameters and provide some theoretical considerations .",
    "we have learned that quantum fluctuations in two dimensions not only select the @xmath16-coplanar phase in the isotropic ( heisenberg ) model , but also stabilize a coplanar phase up to quite large values of easy - plane anisotropy .",
    "this effect naturally weakens for higher spin , but it is notable for all physically interesting values of @xmath3 .",
    "one is then led to ask what is the effect of introducing three - dimensionality and an antiferromagnetic coupling in the direction perpendicular to the triangular lattice layers .",
    "two facts are known about the isotropic case .",
    "on one hand in the classical limit a small interlayer coupling stabilizes the stacked umbrella state for all values of the applied field.@xcite on the other hand for @xmath9 at @xmath21 , the effect of the interlayer coupling is sufficient to contrast the quantum fluctuations and destabilize the stacked @xmath16-coplanar phase in favor of the stacked umbrella phase.@xcite combining these observations with the result of the previous subsection , one can argue that the phase diagram in the @xmath22 $ ] plane features a stacked coplanar phase in the lower - left corner and the stacked umbrella in the upper - right region .",
    "furthermore the first - order phase transition line between the two progressively shifts downwards as @xmath3 increases , which asymptotically leads to the disappearance of the coplanar phase from the easy - plane region , consistently with the classical result .",
    "the actual calculation indeed confirms this scenario and is reported in fig .",
    "[ pdanisinter ] ( an isotropic interlayer coupling is used , namely @xmath23 ) . the same phase diagram for the case of @xmath9 , @xmath24 , was discussed in ref .  .",
    "we recall that for fixed @xmath3 we expect an additional first - order phase transition between @xmath16 and @xmath14 states within the coplanar region,@xcite but its determination goes beyond the scope of this paper ( see the discussion in sec .",
    "[ sec : intro ] and [ sec : setup ] ) .",
    "we illustrate in a more detailed fashion the calculation for the specific case of the model with isotropic intralayer interaction ( @xmath25 ) in fig .",
    "[ heisfig ] .",
    "additionally , we note the consequence of changing the spin anisotropy of the interlayer exchange . in general ,",
    "if that anisotropy is of @xmath5 type ( respectively ising type ) the coplanar region expands ( respectively contracts ) .",
    "we have checked that this tendency occurs also when the model possesses a ( fixed ) spin anisotropy in the intralayer exchange interaction ( @xmath26 ) .",

    "in this study , we provided an accurate determination of the umbrella - coplanar transition point of the two - dimensional triangular xxz model near saturation for arbitrary spin @xmath3 .",
    "this was made possible by using the holstein - primakoff mapping together with normal ordering that allowed for the appropriate dilute boson expansion ; also , the singularities of the ladder approximation in two dimensions were worked around with a sort of dimensional regularization ( smooth extrapolation to zero interlayer coupling ) .",
    "we thus made the information that a larger @xmath3 weakens quantum fluctuations , and then the coplanar states , quantitative .",
    "in addition , we studied the effect of a finite antiferromagnetic interlayer coupling ( which makes the system three - dimensional ) , an ingredient quite important for modeling real compounds , and found precisely how it also tends to stabilize the umbrella state .",
