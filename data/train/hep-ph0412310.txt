    "since the first experimental realization of a bose condensed dilute gas in 1995 there has been an intense effort to further understand this new state of matter both from the experimental and theoretical point of view .",
    "the most common theoretical ansatz for a wide range of questions is the famous gross - pitaevskii equation of motion ( e.o.m . )",
    "this equation for the bose macroscopic wavefunction @xmath6 gives a complete description of the condensate at @xmath7 .",
    "near the phase transition one clearly has to take into account the effects of the non - condensate atoms .",
    "one approach to this problem is to derive a useful kinetic equation that includes the collisions between the condensate and non - condensate part of the system .",
    "this was done by griffin , nikuni and zaremba @xcite starting from a suitably generalized gross - pitaevskii equation ( see also the work by imamovic - tomasovic and griffin @xcite ) .",
    "further approaches to a quantum kinetic description of bose condensed systems can , e.g. , be found in @xcite .",
    "+ in this paper we apply a method coming from non - equilibrium relativistic quantum field theory . for a recent review of the so called two particle irreducible ( 2pi )",
    "effective action techniques see @xcite .",
    "this powerful method has already been used in a variety of interesting issues like physics of the early universe and heavy ion collisions @xcite , and recently to the non - equilibrium dynamics of bose - einstein condensates @xcite .",
    "we use the e.o.m . for a n - component scalar field",
    "obtained within a @xmath0-expansion of the 2pi effective action to next to leading order ( nlo ) @xcite .",
    "we finally arrive at the same kinetic equation previously derived in @xcite .",
    "our starting point is the relativistic e.o.m . from the @xmath0-expansion of the 2pi effective action at nlo . for a n - component real scalar field",

    "the @xmath17-integral in ( 2 ) is taken along this contour as well ( see fig.1 ) .",
    "+ as we ultimately want to describe a bose condensed gas we have to take @xmath18 , or @xmath19 .",

    "our goal in this section is to derive a kinetic equation for @xmath6 in terms of the non - condensate distribution functions .",
    "this equation will have a clear physical interpretation .",
    "we have to make some approximations as the very concept of a distribution function @xmath48 can not be strictly applied to a quantum mechanical problem .",
    "first of all , we will work within the popov approximation @xcite , i.e. we neglect the anomalous correlators @xmath49 and @xmath50 . in addition , we suppose the coupling constant @xmath51 to be small as in current experiments the densities near the phase transition are such that the gas is in the weak coupling limit @xcite .",
    "+ one then obtains @xmath52    @xmath53    with @xmath54 and so on .",
    "we take only the first term of the iterative equation ( 21 ) for @xmath55 what leads to a collision term up to order @xmath1 . +",
    "following the well known approach of kadanoff and baym @xcite , we now assume that the correlation length of the system under consideration is sufficiently small and one can write    @xmath56    @xmath57    where @xmath58 and @xmath59 are the relative and center of mass coordinates , respectively , while @xmath60 denotes the non - condensate quasiparticle four - momentum .",
    "the dependence of the correlation functions ( 28 ) and ( 29 ) on the relative time @xmath61 is assumed to be determined by these quasiparticles . according to ( 39 ) , given later , the hartree - fock energy is given by @xmath62 $ ] ( see also @xcite ) .",

    "@xmath66 is applied , with @xmath67 and @xmath68 being the condensates atoms local velocity and energy , respectively .",

    "the physical interpretation is obvious : the first term in the integrand of the rhs corresponds to the gain term , i.e. it describes the collisions of two non - condensate atoms scattering into a non - condensate and a condensate state .",
    "similarly , the second term describes the inverse process leading to a loss of condensate states .",
    "the collision term is shown pictorially in figure 2 .",
    "dashed lines correspond to the condensate and full ones to the non - condensate field .",
    "in the previous section we derived a kinetic equation for the condensate field @xmath6 in terms of the non - condensate distribution function @xmath75 . in order to obtain a complete set of equations we thus have to find the boltzmann equation fulfilled by @xmath75 .",
