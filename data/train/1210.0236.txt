    "although the black hole x - ray binaries ( bhbs ) have been intensively studied for over four decades , many problems remain unsolved . among the most debated topics",
    "are the physics of state transitions , the interplay between the cold accretion disc and the hot medium , the role of the jet , the source of rapid variability , radiative processes shaping the broadband spectrum and , specifically , the nature of various components contributing to its different parts .",
    "when addressing the latter problem , three distinct components are usually considered : the standard ( or irradiated ) cool accretion disc , the hot inner flow ( or corona ) and the jet .",
    "their relative contribution depends on the spectral energy range and varies with time and can be assessed by performing ( quasi- ) simultaneous multiwavelength observations .    over the past decade , numerous multiwavelength campaigns have resulted in a significant progress in the field .",
    "broadband radio to x - ray spectral energy distributions ( seds ) for many black holes ( bh ) low - mass x - ray binaries ( lmxbs ) were constructed ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "in addition to the spectral information , data on the fast variability are now available in the x - rays as well as at lower energies .",
    "the light curves in the optical / infrared ( oir ) and ultraviolet ( uv ) bands are significantly correlated with the x - rays @xcite showing a complex shape of the cross - correlation function ( ccf ) .",
    "it provides an important information on the interrelation between various components and gives clues to their physical origin .",
    "the radio emission in bhbs is likely dominated by the jet as supported by the observed linear polarization at a 13 per cent level in the hard state @xcite and up to ten per cent in spatially resolved components during the transient events @xcite . in addition , a relatively high luminosity , requiring the size exceeding the typical binary separation @xcite , as well as the detection of superluminal motion @xcite lean towards this interpretation .",
    "the power - law - like radio spectrum is often attributed to synchrotron emission of an inhomogeneous source in analogy with the extragalactic jets @xcite . in blazars ,",
    "the jet is also responsible for the x - ray and @xmath0-ray production @xcite . on the contrary ,",
    "the jets in bhbs are unlikely to be responsible for bulk of the x - ray photons ( for comprehensive discussion see * ? ? ?",
    "further , the medium producing the x - ray radiation can neither form the base of the jet @xcite , nor be a jet - dominated accretion flow @xcite .",
    "the spectra of hard - state bhbs constitute a power - law in the x - ray band with a stable spectral slope and ubiquitous sharp cut - off at @xmath1100  kev @xcite .",
    "it is broadly accepted to be produced by thermal comptonization ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "additionally , a compton reflection feature originating from cool opaque matter ( likely the cool accretion disc ) is often detected .",
    "its strength is correlated with the x - ray slope ( @xcite ; @xcite ) , with the width of the iron line as well as with the quasi - periodic oscillation ( qpo ) frequency @xcite .",
    "these observations support a view that the x - rays are produced in the very vicinity of the bh , in a hot flow surrounded by the cold disc . in this scenario ,",
    "variations in the mass accretion rate are correlated with the cool disc truncation radius @xcite , with the flux of soft seed photons that determines the spectral slope and with the reflection amplitude that scales with the solid angle at which the cold disc is seen from the hot flow .",
    "correlations with the qpo frequency are also naturally explained if the oscillations are produced in the innermost part of the accretion flow by lense  thirring precession @xcite .",
    "such a scenario would favour models where seed photons for comptonization are provided by the standard @xcite accretion disc .",
    "however , the hot flow itself also produces synchrotron radiation that can contribute or even dominate the seed photon flux to the comptonizing medium ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "discovery of the high - energy ( mev ) tails in the hard - state accreting bhbs ( @xcite ; @xcite ) suggests the presence of non - thermal particles in these systems .",
    "such particles may be produced in a hot inner flow or a jet .",
    "their association with the jet , however , is inconsistent with detections of even more prominent high - energy non - thermal tails in the soft state of bhbs @xcite , when the jet is quenched @xcite . in this state",
    "the inner flow is likely to be replaced by a corona , which remains here the only alternative . in the hard state ,",
    "the entire x/@xmath0-ray spectra can be produced by hybrid ( thermal plus non - thermal ) electrons via synchrotron self - compton ( ssc ) mechanism @xcite .",
    "the thermal part of the particle distribution is responsible for the power - law - like comptonization continuum with the sharp cut - off , while the non - thermal particles both produce seed synchrotron photons for comptonization and contribute to the mev energies via inverse compton process .",
    "transition to the soft state can then be associated with the rising role of the disc as a source of seed photons , which increases compton cooling and causes changes in the electron distribution from mostly thermal to nearly non - thermal @xcite .",
    "the ssc mechanism was also shown to be consistent with the peculiar optical variability , which in a number of bhbs is partially anticorrelated with the x - ray emission @xcite .",
    "namely , the increasing mass accretion rate results in a higher x - ray and a lower synchrotron oir emission , because of an increasing role of synchrotron self - absorption within the source @xcite .",
    "the oir spectra of lmxbs often show an excess above the standard accretion disc ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ) . in some cases",
    "the spectrum can be described by a power - law of index close to zero ( i.e. @xmath2 ) .",
    "such data were previously explained by additional contribution from the irradiated disc @xcite , dust heated by the secondary star @xcite or the jet @xcite .",
    "we show that they also can be explained by the synchrotron radiation from the non - thermal particles in the hot flow",
    ". however , in some cases the oir fluxes are higher than expected from any candidate alone @xcite , suggesting contribution of at least two components simultaneously .",
    "this can be a reason for the complex shape of the optical / x - ray ccf @xcite .",
    "the general shape of the time - averaged x/@xmath0-ray spectrum of bhb can be well explained in terms of a one - zone hybrid comptonization model .",
    "however , the short - term spectral variability , reflected in hard x - ray time - lags @xcite , and asymmetries of the ccf between hard and soft x - ray energy bands ( @xcite ; @xcite ) suggest that a number of regions simultaneously contribute to the total spectrum .",
    "the observed logarithmic dependence of the time - lags on photon energy can be phenomenologically explained by spectral pivoting @xcite .",
    "theoretical model capable of explaining the observed timing properties was proposed by @xcite and further developed in @xcite .",
    "it assumes that the x - ray spectrum is produced in the hot flow / corona , present in a range of radii , by comptonization of the disc photons .",
    "the power - law slope of the locally emitted spectrum depends on the distance from the bh : the hardest spectra are produced in the innermost region due to the lack of photons from the cold disc .",
    "the main source of the short - term variability in bhs is believed to be fluctuations in the mass accretion rate , propagating through the hot accretion flow @xcite .",
    "the hard time - lags thus naturally appear from the perturbations propagating from the larger distances to the vicinity of the bh .",
    "the model of @xcite considers thermal comptonization of the disc photons , but as we show below the results hold in the framework of hybrid comptonization , with the synchrotron mechanism as the major seed photon supplier .",
    "it is clear that the complete description of the timing and spectral properties of bhbs requires a multizone model . in this paper",
    "we construct such a model for the extended hot accretion flow .",
    "this model is somewhat analogous to the inhomogeneous synchrotron models developed for extragalactic jets @xcite .",
    "the difference is that in our model the emission originates from an inflow , not an outflow .",
    "the advantage of the hot - flow model is that the energy input can be estimated from the available gravitational energy transferred to particles via some mechanism , while in the jet scenario the energy release is an arbitrary function .",
    "similarly to the previously studied one - zone models @xcite , we assume that gravitational energy is dissipated in the flow and injected in the form of electrons having a power - law distribution ( while the steady - state electron distribution is mostly thermal ) .",
    "we compute the steady - state particle and photon distributions self - consistently by solving corresponding kinetic equations .",
    "our aim is to understand the broadband spectral properties of such a flow and compare them to the bhb data .",
    "in section  [ sect : model ] , we give constraints on the size of the hot accretion flow that can be derived from the observed level of the oir emission .",
    "we first construct an analytical model for the hot flow assuming power - law radial dependences of the main parameters .",
    "we then proceed to the numerical model where the electron distributions and the emitted spectra are computed self - consistently . in section  [ sect : synch_num ] , we present the results of simulations for the model corresponding to the hard state of bhbs .",
    "we show that the multizone hot disc model produces flat oir spectra resulting from synchrotron emission of non - thermal electrons at different radii .",
    "we then model the state transitions by decreasing the truncation radius of the hot flow .",
    "in section  [ sect : comparison ] , we provide a detailed analysis of the observational data and compare them to our model and to the jet scenario .",
    "we summarize our finding in section  [ sect : summary ] .",
    "many observational properties suggest that the standard disc in the hard state is truncated far away from the central object ( for detailed description and challenges to the truncated disc scenario , see review by * ? ? ?",
    "the inner part is probably occupied by some type of geometrically thick , optically thin , hot accretion flow , which is responsible for the x - ray comptonization continuum , but also contributes to the longer wavelengths .",
    "one can roughly estimate the minimum size of the source that is required to produce the observed oir luminosity .",
    "let us first assume that oir emission is produced by synchrotron radiation from thermal particles ( as for example was discussed earlier by @xcite ) .",
    "the typical temperature of the electron gas determined from the comptonization cut - off is @xmath3@xmath1100  kev and the typical ir luminosity at @xmath4  ev can reach @xmath5  erg  s@xmath6 .",
    "thus , we get the minimum size from the rayleigh - jeans formula @xmath7 for a 10@xmath8 bh , assumed in all calculations hereafter , this corresponds to 750  @xmath9 ( here @xmath10 is the schwarzschild radius )",
    ". however , many observed properties [ e.g. iron line width , amplitude of compton reflection , drop of the iron line equivalent width with the fourier frequency , see @xcite , as well as dependence of the x - ray time - lags on energy below @xmath11  kev , @xcite ] suggest that the cold disc in the hard state is truncated at a smaller radius . moreover , in order to produce sufficient amount of seed photons for comptonization , an extremely high magnetic field is required in addition to the large source size ( see appendix  [ apndx : nth_frac ] and also , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "thus , the thermal radiation of the hot flow is unlikely to be a good candidate to produce enough oir photons ( see also * ? ? ?",
    ".    however , even a weak , energetically unimportant non - thermal tail , in addition to the mostly maxwellian distribution , gives a significant rise to the synchrotron luminosity ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "for example , a tail containing only one per cent of total particle energy increases it by a factor of @xmath11 .",
    "accurate calculations ( see below ) show that the source size of @xmath12 , an order magnitude smaller than given by equation ( [ eq : radius_therm ] ) , would in principle be enough to radiate the observed oir luminosity .",
    "such a size is consistent with the above estimates of the truncation radius and with the typical size of the region of the gravitational energy release .",
    "it is worth noticing that a strong synchrotron emission from non - thermal particles makes it a good candidate for seed photons for comptonization @xcite , which implies that the ssc spectrum extends from the x - rays down to the oir band with the low - energy turnover determined by the maximum extent of the hot flow .",
    "spectral properties of the hot flow in the oir band can be understood from simple analytical considerations .",
    "let us consider the flow with a constant height - to - radius ratio @xmath13 , extending between radii @xmath14 and @xmath15 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig_inner_flow ] for the geometry ) . in order to estimate the synchrotron luminosity and spectra",
    ", we assume that the electrons follow a power - law distribution in lorentz factor @xmath16 , starting from @xmath17 to infinity .",
    "deviations from the power - law at low energies do not play any role , as the synchrotron emission produced by these electrons is self - absorbed .",
    "the thomson optical depth across the disc is assumed to follow the power law @xmath18 .",
    "for the constant @xmath13 this is equivalent to @xmath19 .",
    "we further assume that the magnetic field depends on the distance from the bh as @xmath20 .",
    "our analytical model of the hot flow is analogous to the non - uniform synchrotron source models , previously applied to the emission from extragalactic jets @xcite . for the parameters considered here ,",
    "most of the luminosity is produced in the inner part of the source , so that the oir spectrum is composed of emission components coming from different radii and is not dominated by the radiation from the outer regions ( these two cases are illustrated in figs 2a and 2b in @xcite ) .",
    "a region of the disc at a given radius emits synchrotron radiation , which is self - absorbed below the turnover frequency @xmath21 . for power - law electrons , this frequency can be calculated as @xcite @xmath22^{\\frac{2}{p+4}},\\ ] ] where @xmath23 is the larmor frequency , @xmath24 is a combination of euler s gamma functions ( due to averaging over electron pitch angles ) , @xmath25 is the classical electron radius . substituting the constants , we get @xmath26 where @xmath27 in cgs units .",
    "the term in brackets can also be written as @xmath28 , with @xmath29 being the lorentz factor of the electrons emitting at the turnover frequency and @xmath30 being the thomson optical depth per unit lorentz factor at @xmath29 . in the later representation , the equation is also valid for hybrid electrons ( e.g. , maxwellian with power - law tail ) , as long as the electrons emitting at the turnover frequency are in the power - law tail . the low - frequency cut - off for synchrotron spectrum from",
    "power - law electrons scales as @xmath31/(p+4)}.\\ ] ] again , for hybrid electron distribution one should consider scaling with radius of the power - law tail ( parameter @xmath32 ) , which can be different from scaling of the total optical depth .",
    "as immediately follows from equation ( [ eq : turn_over_exact ] ) , the turnover frequency may fall to optical and even ir wavelengths for sufficiently low magnetic field and/or thomson optical depth .",
    "the emission at the turnover frequency is optically thick , so the intensity is equal to the source function for the power - law electrons . for isotropic electrons the intensity",
    "is ( averaged over pitch angles ) @xmath33 where @xmath34 ( again , coming from the angle - averaging ) . at each wavelength",
    ", there is a contribution from the optically thick and optically thin emission from different radii . for simplicity , we assume that emission from each radius contributes only to its own turnover frequency , therefore the resulting spectrum of an inhomogeneous synchrotron source constitutes a power - law @xmath35 substituting the appropriate parameter scaling and using equation  ( [ eq : turn_over_sca ] ) , we get the spectral index @xmath36 where @xmath37 . in a wide range of parameters",
    "@xmath38 $ ] and @xmath39 $ ] the resulting spectral slope lies between @xmath40 and @xmath41 ( see fig .  [ fig_alpha_oir ] ) .",
    "the analytical model developed in section  [ sect : synch_th ] describes only the oir _ synchrotron _ spectra and is valid for purely power - law electrons .",
    "such distributions may result from various acceleration mechanisms e.g. shock acceleration or magnetic reconnection . in the limit of low optical depth and weak magnetic field the electrons are unable to cool and",
    "the shape of the distribution stays unchanged .",
    "these conditions might be satisfied in quiescent state , for which the analytical model can be applied . during the accretion outbursts ,",
    "the matter density in the hot flow increases and the energy exchange and cooling processes become important ; thus , the initial power - law distribution evolves .",
    "the most important mechanisms operating in the hot rarefied plasmas of the hot accretion flows are compton scattering , synchrotron emission and absorption , coulomb collisions , bremsstrahlung , and possibly photon - photon pair production and annihilation . at high energies , for a continuously operating acceleration ,",
    "the steady state distribution remains a power - law - like , but softens because of cooling by compton , synchrotron and bremsstrahlung . at lower energies , coulomb collisions and synchrotron self - absorption efficiently thermalize particles , forming a maxwellian distribution .",
    "the total particle distribution consists of a low - energy maxwellian plus a high - energy tail .",
    "such a distribution we call hybrid . the shape and energy content of the tail",
    "are fully determined by the balance between acceleration and cooling processes .",
    "it can not be calculated analytically ; therefore , we treat this problem numerically . the photon spectrum emitted by the hot flow",
    "is computed self - consistently with the particle distributions .",
    "the time - scale of equilibration of electron and photon distributions for typical parameters of our model is smaller than the corresponding advection time in the hot flow ( see appendix  [ apndx : times ] ) .",
    "thus we can use an assumption that the electron and photon distributions are in a steady state .",
    "we obtain them by solving the relevant kinetic equations .",
    "we consider a geometrically thick optically thin inner accretion flow , which vertical extent is parametrized by the ratio @xmath42 .",
    "we assume that the hot flow corresponds to some type of radiatively inefficient accretion flow ( see review in * ? ? ?",

    ", we discuss the validity of such an approximation and show that the results hold due to efficient electron thermalisation at low lorentz factors . ]",
    "the model has seven parameters : ( i ) the total luminosity @xmath53 , ( ii ) the index of the electron power - law injection spectrum @xmath51 ( constant throughout the flow ) , ( iii ) the electron thomson optical depth @xmath54 and ( iv ) the magnetic field @xmath55 in the innermost regions , ( v - vi ) indices of their power - law radial dependencies @xmath32 and @xmath56 , and ( vii ) the hot - flow size @xmath48 .",
    "the energy given to electrons is redistributed between the particles ( electrons and positrons ) and photons in processes of synchrotron emission and self - absorption , compton scattering , coulomb collisions , pair production and annihilation and bremsstrahlung emission .",
    "the dominating cooling regime for a specific electron lorentz factor depends on the luminosity , magnetic field and the optical depth ( relevant scaling is given in appendix  [ apndx : times ] ) .",
    "in addition to the internally produced radiation , we also consider soft photons from the cold outer accretion disc in the form of the blackbody radiation injected homogeneously into the system .",

    "this approach keeps the energy density inside the sphere and the torus the same . after the spectrum in a sphere",
    "is computed , we multiply it by the same factor @xmath76 in order to account for the radiation from entire torus .",

    "such spectra are consistent with those observed from the bhbs . for example , the best studied bh , cyg  x-1 , clearly has a concave spectrum @xcite that can be fitted with two comptonization continua @xcite .    a larger contribution from the outer zones to the soft x - rays",
    "should be reflected in the variability properties .",
    "assuming that variability is produced by propagation of fluctuations in the mass accretion rate through the disc @xcite , we expect an increase in the variability amplitude for higher photon energies at higher fourier frequencies , which is indeed observed @xcite .",
    "the autocorrelation function of soft x - rays in our model is expected to be wider than that of the hard x - rays , consistent with what is measured in cyg  x-1 @xcite .",
    "the same effect is more obviously seen in the fourier - frequency - resolved spectra @xcite , which are softer and have larger reflection amplitude at low fourier frequencies .",
    "this implies that the outer zones of the hot flow ( which are closer to the cold reflecting medium ) give a relatively larger contribution to the soft x - ray flux than to the hard x - rays .",
    "the reduction of the equivalent width of the 6.4  kev fe line in the frequency - resolved spectra above 1  hz suggests that the cold disc truncation radius is of the order of 100 @xmath9 @xcite , further supporting our scenario .",
    "similarly , even larger inner radii of the cold disc were measured in the low - extinction bh transient xte  j1118 + 480 @xcite .",
    "another important finding is that the harder x - rays are delayed with respect to the soft x - rays ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the large values of these hard time lags and their frequency - dependence @xmath126 can naturally be explained by spectral pivoting of a power - law - like spectrum @xcite .",

    "the computed ccf have a complicated shape with a dip in the optical light curve preceding the x - ray peak ( the so - called precognition dip ) , together with an optical peak lagging the x - rays .",
    "the behaviour can be explained if the optical emission consists of two components : one coming from the synchrotron in the hot flow and another from reprocessed x - ray emission @xcite .",
    "increase of the mass accretion rate causes an increase in the x - ray luminosity and affects the parameters of the hot flow , leading to a higher synchrotron self - absorption .",
    "the latter results in a drop of the optical emission , therefore these two energy bands appear anticorrelated .",
    "this is reflected in the negative ccf with the shape resembling that of the x - ray autocorrelation function .",
    "on the other hand , the reprocessed radiation is delayed and smeared , giving rise to a ccf peaking at positive lags ( optical delay ) .",
    "the combined ccf has a complicated shape consistent with the data . from the point of view of the multizone consideration , with a small increase of the mass accretion rate the cool disc moves inwards and causes the collapse of the hot flow at large radii .",
    "thus , the suppression of the oir emission with increasing x - ray radiation is also expected in this scenario .",
    "a different , one - peak structure of the ir / x - ray ccf was found in gx  3394 @xcite , suggesting the hot flow was not the dominant source of the correlated variability during their observations .",
    "however , it might still give significant contribution to the constant flux component , but less to the varying component , and therefore would not be detected in the timing analysis .",
    "as it can be seen from figs  [ fig_puressc_inj2_5 ]  and  [ fig_puressc_inj3 ] , the zones giving major contribution to the ir wavelengths do not contribute much to the x - rays .",
    "therefore , the fraction of the correlated variability coming from these regions is expected to be small , and another source ( likely the jet emission , as suggested in @xcite ) might be responsible for the shape of the ccf .",
    "we also note that large amplitude of fluctuations in the ir light - curve suggests that the source of correlated variability is also dominating over the constant flux component .",
    "the optical correlation with the x - rays was also detected in the quiescent state of v404 cyg @xcite , while no clear radio / x - ray ( nor radio / optical ) correlation was found on the time - scales of hours , again suggesting the radio and optical / x - ray emission are produced by the different components .",

    "sometimes the oir slope is different from the radio as , for example , in xte  j1118 + 480 the oir spectrum with @xmath128 is much softer than the radio spectrum with @xmath152 @xcite , but much harder than expected from the optically thin jet emission . the hot - flow scenario can reproduce the observed flat oir spectra , at the same time the slopes in the oir and radio do not necessarily match , as they are produced in different regions ( inflow and outflow ) .    a rather low oir polarization ( at most a few per cent ) observed in bhbs is clearly much below the high polarization observed in many extragalactic jets . on the other hand ,",
    "certain types of objects , the so - called compact steep - spectrum and gigahertz peaked - spectrum radio sources , demonstrate similarly small polarization levels ( 0.2 and up to 7 per cent , respectively , @xcite ) .",
    "however , the ( rest - frame ) break frequency measured in these objects is quite low ; thus , in the x - ray binary jets , as expected from the scaling laws the break frequency is in the ( sub- ) millimeter range .",
    "the two models make different predictions for changes of the oir spectrum during the state transitions . in the hot - flow scenario",
    ", the spectrum gradually hardens at hard - to - soft transition on the time - scales of days to weeks , corresponding to the typical time - scales on which the cold accretion disc evolves .",
    "it softens again at the reverse transition . on the other hand",
    ", one would not expect systematic changes of the jet spectral slope , as any fluctuations would propagate through the jet on time - scales of hours , much shorter than the state transition .",
    "however , if the jet power is gradually decreasing at the transition , then the dependence of the turnover frequency on the mass accretion rate suggests that @xmath21 is also decreasing @xcite .",
    "thus , the jet scenario predicts softening of the oir non - thermal spectrum at hard to soft state transition and hardening at the reverse transition , opposite to the hot - flow scenario .    in reality , the oir emission can contain contributions from a number of components : the hot flow , the jet , and the cold accretion disc ( likely irradiated ) .",
    "it is also possible that in some sources there is a dip in the microwave band , where the transition from the radio jet to the hot flow occurs .",
    "the dip can be detected in the far infrared / submillimeter wavelengths , which were not systematically studied in the past .",
    "it is thus of high interest to observe at these wavelengths , especially with the available capabilities of the atacama large millimeter / submillimeter array .",
    "the observed oir flat spectra and the mev tails evidence the significant role of non - thermal electrons in spectral formation of accreting bhbs . on the other hand ,",
    "the commonly detected x - ray spectral cut - offs at @xmath1100  kev can be produced only by thermal particles .",
    "whether these two populations belong to one component or originate from completely different places is debated .",
    "we present a model , in which the entire infrared to x - ray/@xmath0-ray continuum is produced by one component , the inhomogeneous hot accretion flow , present in the vicinity of compact object .",
    "the difference from the earlier studied hot geometrically thick optically thin flows is that the steady - state electron distribution in our model is hybrid , i.e. maxwellian with a weak high - energy tail .",
    "the x - ray spectra in our model are dominated by the radiation of the innermost regions of the hot flow .",
    "for this reason , the model inherits the advantages of the one - zone synchrotron self - compton model @xcite that explains well the x - ray spectral properties of bhb in their hard state , such as    1 .",
    "stable spectra with photon index @xmath1531.61.9 and the cutoff at @xmath1100  kev in the hard state , 2 .   low level of the x - ray polarization , 3 .",
    "presence of the mev tail in the hard state , 4 .",
    "power - law - like x - ray spectra extending to a few mev in the soft state , 5 .",
    "softening of the x - ray spectrum with decreasing luminosity below @xmath110@xmath154 , 6 .",
    "weakness of the cold accretion disc component in the hard state , and 7 .",
    "correlation between the spectral index , the reflection amplitude , the width of the iron line and the frequency of the qpo .",
    "we show that the multizone consideration allows to understand many other observables in the context of the hot - flow model :    1 .",
    "hard x - ray lags with logarithmic energy dependence , 2 .",
    "concave x - ray spectrum , 3 .",
    "non - thermal oir excesses and flat spectra , 4 .",
    "strong correlation between oir and x - ray emission and a complicated shape of the ccf , and 5 .   a complex evolution of the oir  uv spectrum during the state transition .",
    "we present relevant analytical expressions to estimate the hot - flow parameters from the oir data ( see eqs  [ eq : turn_over_exact ] , [ eq : oir_slope ] and [ eq : luminosity ] ) .",
    "additional x - ray and @xmath0-ray data are required to find a complete parameter set .",
    "however , the hot flow extent can be found from the oir data alone under certain assumptions ( eqs  [ eq : turn_over_calc ] and [ eq : luminosity_calc ] ) .",
    "we compare the developed model to the popular jet scenario and show that in a number of cases the data favour the hot - flow interpretation .",
    "we encourage future observations in the far infrared and submillimeter wavelengths to provide the missing link between radio and infrared , which would allow us to determine the contribution of the two components to the oir emission .",

    "we assume the photon spectra and electron distributions in each zone are in equilibrium ; thus , the typical time - scales of equilibration should be much less than the dynamical time - scale at a given distance . to estimate the latter",
    ", we consider the properties of an advective hot flow , derived by @xcite . taking their radial velocity approximation , viscosity parameter 0.1 and assuming the adiabatic index 3/2 @xcite",
    ", we obtain the advection / accretion time @xmath167 we can compare the coulomb ( the radiative cooling is faster than coulomb for @xmath168 ) and advection time - scales ( again , assuming @xmath165 ) @xmath169 hence , for typical parameters @xmath1701100 and @xmath1710.11 the cooling time - scale is shorter than the advection time .",
    "one of the main assumptions in our work is that all the energy dissipated in the flow is transferred to the electrons by acceleration , i.e. 100 per cent of the power is injected in the form of power - law electrons . in reality , many other dissipation mechanisms may play a significant role in particle heating , such as electron - proton coulomb collisions ( the main energy transfer mechanism in the advective flow models ) , resonant interactions with plasma waves and other collective plasma effects .",
    "these acceleration processes do not lead to power - law electron distributions ; instead , the maxwellian distribution is heated as a whole , achieving higher temperature .",
    "thus it is important to check how robust the model is to changes in the fraction of non - thermal particles .",
    "we note that effects of decreasing non - thermal injection fraction were considered in @xcite , who showed that as long as this fraction is more than @xmath130 per cent , the results are very similar . however",
    ", they fixed the minimum and the maximum lorentz factors of the injection ; thus , decreasing the non - thermal fraction would result in decreasing of normalization of the injected power - law electrons . here",
    "we investigate the effects of decreasing non - thermal energy fraction keeping the normalization of the injected power - law constant by increasing @xmath172 .",
    "as previously mentioned , the maximum lorentz factor of accelerated electrons @xmath173 is assumed .",
    "the energy fraction given to power - law electrons is calculated as @xmath174_{\\rm nth } }               = \\!\\ !",

    "the non - thermal fraction is @xmath177 , and for @xmath178 , @xmath179 .",
    "the rest of dissipated energy is given to electrons via stochastic heating as described in sect .",
    "4.1 of @xcite .",
    "we also consider a purely thermal model , where 100 per cent of energy gained by electrons is due to stochastic heating .",
    "for an illustration , we simulated an innermost zone ( @xmath80 ) of the hot flow with parameters described in table  [ tab_params ] .",
    "the results are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_nth_frac ] .",
    "we find that the resulting spectra are very similar for non - thermal fractions @xmath180 . for even smaller @xmath181 ,",
    "the spectra are harder , but slightly adjusting other parameters ( magnetic field , thomson optical depth ) we can obtain spectra , which are very close to the original purely non - thermal models . at the same time , purely thermal model has a much harder x - ray spectrum ( with spectral index @xmath182 against @xmath183 for the non - thermal case ) and higher equilibrium temperature ( @xmath184  kev against @xmath185  kev for the non - thermal case ) , inconsistent with the existing x - ray data .    in order to describe the data with purely thermal model , a much higher magnetic field is required .",
    "analysis of @xcite showed that purely thermal ssc can not be the dominant radiative mechanism in majority of the x - ray binaries .",
    "however , it is interesting to test how the oir spectrum would change in this case .",
    "following equation 18 of @xcite , the turnover frequency scales as @xmath186 . as in the case of power - law electrons",
    ", it strongly depends on the magnetic field ; however , the strongest dependence here is on the electron temperature . assuming its scaling with radius @xmath187 , we get @xmath188 which then implies that the oir slope is @xmath189    as an illustration , we performed simulations for a purely thermal model for the whole inhomogeneous hot flow with the parameters from table  [ tab_params ] , except that the magnetic field in every zone was taken an order of magnitude larger , @xmath190 . this assumption is needed to match the typical x - ray spectra in the hard state ( @xmath191 )",
    ". however , such high @xmath113 is above the upper limit determined by the equipartition with protons at a virial temperature .",
    "the equilibrium electron temperature determined by the heating = cooling condition is about 20 per cent larger than in the non - thermal case ( with lower @xmath113 ) .",
    "the spectra and the electron distributions are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_th_oir ] .",
    "we find that the scaling of the electron temperature with radius can be approximated with @xmath192 .",
    "substituting @xmath193 and @xmath129 , gives the resulting oir slope @xmath194 , in good agreement with the computed slope .",
    "of course , no mev emission is expected from purely thermal flows .      in this section ,",
    "we investigate how the assumed geometry of the flow and the interaction between the zones affect the results .",
    "let us first check how the thickness of the hot flow affects the spectra . in order to approximate the hot flow with a number of tori",
    ", the condition of @xmath195 should be satisfied .",
    "taking @xmath196 and using equation ( [ eq : rii1 ] ) we find @xmath197 , with the innermost radius @xmath198 . to cover the same distances from the bh",
    ", we now consider nine zones and scale parameters from table  [ tab_params ] so that they correspond to the distance to the centre of each zone . we compare the results of calculations for @xmath196 to those for @xmath83 in fig .",
    "[ fig_hr ] . due to the increase of local electron number density (",
    "@xmath13 is reduced , while optical depth was kept constant ) , the x - ray spectrum has become harder compared to the case @xmath83 , while the oir slopes are almost identical .",
    "the later is not surprising , as the oir spectral shape is determined by scaling of the hot - flow parameters , rather than by their exact values in each zone .    in our calculations we neglected the interaction between the zones and the spectrum of every zone",
    "was computed in the local approximation .",
    "however , photons from each zone can travel to the neighbouring zones .",
    "the largest effect is expected for the outer zones , because they occupy a large solid angle as viewed from the inner zones and their luminosity is smaller than that of the inner zones .",
    "the radiative transfer effects can be approximately accounted for by first computing spectra of each zone in local approximation and then by adding some fraction of the radiation escaping from each zones as an additional photon source for other zones .",
    "luminosity coming from the @xmath57th zone to an adjacent @xmath199th zone is parametrized by @xmath200 , where @xmath201 is the solid angle occupied by @xmath202th zone as seen from @xmath57th zone .",
    "the formalism is similar to that used to simulate the outer cold disc photon injection to the hot flow .",
    "luminosity coming from the @xmath57th zone to a non - adjacent zone @xmath203 can be expressed as @xmath204 , where @xmath205 is the photon optical depth of the medium between zones @xmath57 and @xmath203 ( energy dependent , cumulative from different processes ) .",
    "the resulting spectra accounting for the radiative transfer effects are compared to those computed in local approximation in fig .",
    "[ fig_transfer ] .",
    "the changes in the oir slope are hardly visible .",
    "the x - ray spectra of the outer zones became now harder and the variation of the 210 kev spectral index is smaller @xmath206 ( vs. 0.08 ) .",
    "this effect is caused by additional photons coming from the harder - spectra inner zones and scattered in the outer zones in the direction to the observer .",
    "thus , the spectra computed in the local approximation are rather accurate and agree well with more detailed calculations ."
