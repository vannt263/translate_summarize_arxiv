    "in this contribution we present the results of our studies of the equation of state ( eos ) for the cold nuclear matter .",
    "we work on the extension of a relativistic mean - field ( rmf ) model  @xcite including a possibility for scaling of hadron masses and meson - baryon coupling constants . as in  @xcite",
    ", all hadron masses are scaled in the same way , whereas the coupling constants are scaled differently .",
    "the current challenge is to construct such an eos that can describe a neutron star ( ns ) with the mass of @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the mass of the sun , which was recently observed , cf .",
    "@xcite . for",
    "that the eos should be rather stiff . simultaneously",
    "the eos has to respect the constraint derived from the flow of particles produced in heavy - ion collisions  @xcite .",
    "that oppositely requires the eos to be rather soft .",
    "the additional complication in the description of heavy nss arises if hyperons are included into consideration , since their presence softens the eos , cf .",
    "the nuclear energy - density functional of the rmf model including members of the baryon su(3 ) octet ( @xmath6 ) which interactions are mediated by the scalar meson ( @xmath7 ) and non - strange members of the vector - meson su(3 ) nonet @xmath8 , is @xmath9 =   \\sum_b \\int_0^{p_{{\\rm f},b } } \\frac{p^2 dp}{\\pi^2 } \\sqrt{p^2 + m_b^{*2}(f ) } + \\frac{m_n^4 f^2}{2 c_\\sigma^2 } + u(f )   + \\sum_v \\frac{c_v^2\\widetilde{n}_{v}^2}{2m_n^2\\eta_v(f)}. \\label{efunc}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here @xmath10 is the baryon fermi momentum with @xmath11 standing for the density of baryon @xmath12 .",
    "the effective baryon density @xmath13 , being a source for the mean - field of meson @xmath14 , is defined as @xmath15 , where @xmath16 stands for the baryon charge for @xmath17 , the baryon third isospin projection for @xmath18 , and the baryon strangeness for @xmath19 .",
    "the effective baryon mass @xmath20 differs from the vacuum mass @xmath21 because of the coupling to the scalar field , @xmath22 , where @xmath23 is the dimensionless scalar field , and @xmath24 is the @xmath25 coupling constant .",
    "the functions @xmath26 are the key ingredients , which differ our approach from other rmf models .",
    "these functions stem from the ratios of scalings of vector - meson masses to scalings of hadron - nucleon coupling constants and are tuned in our approach to render the best agreement of the resulting eos with empirical constraints .",
    "the scalar field is found from the minimization of the functional ( [ efunc ] ) with respect to @xmath27 : @xmath28/\\delta f=0 $ ] .",
    "the coupling constants @xmath29 are to be determined from the saturation properties of the nuclear matter , therefore we have @xmath30 .",
    "since the @xmath3 meson does not couple to a nucleon , if the strict okubo - zweig - iizuka selection rule is applied , i.e. @xmath31 , the coupling constant @xmath32 is related to the coupling of the @xmath33 meson as @xmath34 , where @xmath35 , @xmath36 .",
    "the coupling constants of vector mesons to hyperons are chosen traditionally according to the quark su(6 ) symmetry @xmath37 the coupling constants of hyperons with the scalar mean field are derived from the hyperon binding energies @xmath38 in isospin - symmetric matter ( ism ) at the saturation density @xmath39 given by  @xcite @xmath40 and the empirical values @xmath41mev , @xmath42mev and @xmath43mev . the repulsive @xmath44 potential prevents the appearance of @xmath44 hyperons in all models considered below .    for the description of the ns one should add to ( [ efunc ] ) the energies of leptons .",
    "the ns composition is governed by the weak processes bringing the matter in the @xmath45-equilibrium and relating chemical potential of all species to the electron and neutron chemical potentials . together with the electroneutrality condition",
    "these relations allow to express the densities of all baryonic and leptonic species as functions of the total baryon density @xmath46 .",
    "the pressure of the ns matter follows then as @xmath47 . with @xmath48 at hand ,",
    "the ns masses and radii are calculated with the help of the tolman - oppenheimer - volkoff ( tov ) equation . in the crust region",
    "we match smoothly our eos with the bps eos  @xcite .",
    "with appropriate choices of the scaling functions @xmath26 , and @xmath49 and , perhaps , also with a modification of @xmath50 , our model can be reduced to various traditional rmf models .",
    "for example , putting @xmath51 we recover the extension of the original walecka model proposed by boguta and bodmer  @xcite , the so - called non - linear walecka ( nlw ) model , which allows to fit satisfactory the nuclear saturation properties , which we chose here for an illustration as follows : the saturation density @xmath52 , the binding energy per nucleon @xmath53mev , the compressibility modulus @xmath54mev , the effective nucleon mass @xmath55 , and the symmetry energy @xmath56mev . for this choice of parameters and scalings ( [ nlwscale ] )",
    "the limiting mass of a ns is @xmath57 that is below the experimental limit .    in  @xcite we proposed a simple method how one can stiffen the eos in an rmf model .",
    "the strategy is to reduce the growth of the scalar field above a value @xmath58 . as argued in  @xcite ,",
    "this can be achieved by adding to the original energy - density functional ( [ efunc ] ) a function of the scalar field , which is vanishingly small for @xmath59 and is sharply increased for @xmath60 , so that its second derivative becomes sufficiently large .",
    "then , the self - consistent solution of the equation for @xmath27 does not let the function @xmath61 to grow significantly above @xmath58 within a broad interval of densities for @xmath62 , where @xmath2 is determined by @xmath58 .",
    "we will illustrate this mechanism at hand of the following example : we replace @xmath63 in ( [ nlwscale ] ) by @xmath64 , where @xmath65\\,,\\quad \\alpha= m_\\pi^4\\,,\\quad \\beta=120 .",
    "\\label{umod}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] we will refer to such an extension as the `` @xmath7-cut scheme '' and call the model as the nlwcut model . applying the method to models with different values of @xmath66 it is convenient to parameterise @xmath67 , and allow different values of @xmath68 to vary . the nlw model is recovered from the nlwcut model for @xmath69 corresponding to @xmath70 .    on panel ( a ) in fig .",
    "[ fig : sig - cut ] we show the effective nucleon mass @xmath71 as a function of the nucleon density in ism .",

    "the shadow region shows the constraint on the pressure extracted from the particle flow in hic  @xcite .",

    "the stiffening of the eos reflects in an increase of the ns mass at a given central density .",

    "in  @xcite the model kvor was proposed with scaling functions @xmath89 and @xmath90 for @xmath91 , which were chosen to shift the threshold of direct urca ( du ) process , @xmath92 , to higher densities ( via the @xmath93 tuning ) and to increase the maximum neutron star mass ( via the @xmath94 tuning ) .",
    "the kvor model exploits the saturation parameters @xmath95 , @xmath96mev , @xmath97mev , and other parameters being the same as for the nlw model discussed above .",
    "the kvor eos was shown in  @xcite to satisfy appropriately the majority of experimental constraints known by that time .",
    "hyperons were not included in the original kvor model .",
    "however even without hyperons the kvor eos yields the maximum mass @xmath98 that fits the constraint  @xcite only marginally .",
    "we discuss now several extensions of the kvor model  @xcite , which can better fulfill the modern constraints on the nuclear eos . to stiffen the eos we use the method described in the previous section but now will change not the potential @xmath49 but the @xmath99 function as @xmath100\\,.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] we will call such extensions the kvorcut models .",
    "we consider three choices of parameters @xmath101 , @xmath102 and @xmath103 : kvorcut04 with @xmath104 , @xmath105 , @xmath106 ; kvorcut03 with @xmath104 , @xmath107 , @xmath108 ; kvorcut02 with @xmath109 , @xmath110 , @xmath111 . in  @xcite",
    "we introduced another rmf model with scaling  the mkvor model  where the mechanism of the @xmath27 stabilization is implemented not in the @xmath99 function but in the @xmath112 function , which rises for @xmath113 similarly to the kvor model but drops fast for @xmath114 .",
    "therefore in the mkvor model the nucleon mass decreases with the density increase in the ism matter stronger than in the @xmath45-equilibrium matter ( bem ) .",

    "the pressure as a function of the nucleon density in the ism is shown on panel ( b ) in fig .",
    "[ fig : kvorcut ] .",
    "we see that pressure for the kvorcut04 model is only slightly higher than that of the kvor one .",
    "the curve for the kvorcut03 model goes on top of the upper boundary of the experimentally allowed region .",
    "the mkvor - model curve goes through the region for @xmath115 but escapes it at higher density .",
    "oppositely , the curve for the kvorcut02 model lies above the region for @xmath116 but enters it for higher @xmath80 .",
    "panel ( c ) in fig .",
    "[ fig : kvorcut ] demonstrates the ns mass as a function of the central density for our eoss .",
    "the band shows the uncertainty range of the masses for psr  j0348 + 0432  @xcite which is fulfilled by all models .",
    "we see that for the kvorcut models the lesser the value @xmath117 is chosen , the larger the value of the maximum mass is and the smaller the central density corresponding to @xmath118 becomes .",
    "the mkvor eos is the stiffest among the eoss considered here .",
    "dashes on the right panel indicate the du thresholds .",
    "the mkvor model yields the highest du threshold density .",
    "thus , the kvorcut03 and mkvor models are the most promising models for the simultaneous fulfillment of the particle - flow and ns - mass constraints .",
    "we discuss now the results of the hyperonization phase transition on the eos within our rmf models .",
    "we will consider three schemes for the inclusion of hyperons : + ( i ) the hyperons are included with the vector - meson coupling parameters @xmath119 and @xmath120 according to ( [ ghm ] ) and the scalar coupling parameters @xmath121 constrained by the hyperon binding energies as outlined in section  [ sec : model ] .",
    "we switch off the hyperon coupling to @xmath3 mesons , putting @xmath122 .",
    "the models with hyperons obtained within such a scheme are labeled as the kvorh , kvorhcut03 and mkvorh models .",
    "+ ( ii ) next we incorporate the @xmath3-meson mean field and assume the very same scaling of its mass as for all other hadrons , i.e. , @xmath123 , but with the unscaled hyperon-@xmath3 coupling constants , which gives the scaling function @xmath124 .",
    "the resulting models are denoted as kvorh@xmath3 , kvorhcut03@xmath3 and mkvorh@xmath3 .",
    "+ ( iii ) in addition to the @xmath3-meson mass scaling we take into account a possible change of the @xmath121 parameters with an increase of density . we assume these parameters being unchanged for densities @xmath125 and decreasing for higher densities , so that they reach and stay zero for the baryon density @xmath126 , where @xmath127 are critical densities for hyperonization .",
    "with such a parametrization we will exploit vacuum masses of the hyperon @xmath128 for @xmath126 .",
    "such extensions of the models are call kvorhcut03@xmath129 and mkvorh@xmath129 models .    as known , the inclusion of hyperons results usually in a substantial decrease of the maximum ns mass .",
    "the difference between ns masses with and without hyperons proves to be so large for reasonable hyperon fractions in the standard rmf approach that in order to solve the puzzle one needs to start with a very stiff eos without hyperons that would be in odds with microscopical calculations and with the constraints from heavy - ion collisions .",
    "the ns masses as functions of the central baryon density for various models with hyperons are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : hyper ] . comparing with fig .",
    "[ fig : kvorcut ] we see that the appearance of hyperons reduces the maximum ns mass for the kvorh and kvorhcut03 models by @xmath130 and @xmath131 , respectively , bringing them below the empirically known pulsar mass .",
    "we find also that hyperons can not be incorporated in the mkvor model , since the solution for @xmath61 does not exist for all densities .",
    "including the @xmath3-meson with an @xmath27-dependent mass and scaling of @xmath132 coupling constants ( schemes ( ii ) and ( iii ) above ) we obtain maximum ns mass of @xmath133 for kvorhcut03@xmath3 that marginally agrees with the observational constraint and @xmath134 for kvorhcut03@xmath129 that fully fulfils the maximum ns mass constraint .",
    "for the extensions of the mkvor models we find the maximum mass of @xmath135 for mkvorh@xmath3 and @xmath136 for mkvorh@xmath129 ; both values are well above the observational maximum ns mass constraint .",
    "mass - radius relations for kvorhcut03@xmath3 , kvorhcut03@xmath129 , mkvorh@xmath3 and mkvorh@xmath129 eoss are shown on panel ( c ) in fig .",
    "[ fig : hyper ] .",
    "we see that the mkvorh@xmath3 and mkvorh@xmath129 eoss satisfy all presented constraints , whereas the kvorhcut03@xmath3 and kvorhcut03@xmath129 eoss render star radii slightly larger than the corridor of allowed values ( shown by black thin lines ) extracted in  @xcite from the analysis of empirical data .",
    "we presented a novel mechanism of stiffening the eos within an rmf model with hadron masses and coupling constants depending on the scalar field .",
    "the key idea is to quench the growth of the scalar field and correspondingly a decrease of the nucleon mass with a density increase .",
    "three different approaches are outlined where the quenching is achieved by the modification of the @xmath7 mean - field self - interaction or by changing in the vector ( @xmath137 ) and isovector ( @xmath138 ) sectors of the energy density functional . within these schemes",
    "we discuss the @xmath7-cut versions of the traditional non - linear walecka model , the @xmath137-cut versions of the kvor model proposed in  @xcite ( kvorcut models ) and a new model mkvor combining various schemes .",
    "the hyperons are included and it is demonstrated that kvorcut and mkvor models can support sufficiently heavy neutron stars if a decrease of the @xmath3-meson mass or the hyperon-@xmath7 coupling constants are incorporated .",
