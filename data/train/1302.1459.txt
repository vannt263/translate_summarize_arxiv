    "cooperative relaying is an efficient technique to combat fading and path - loss effects in wireless systems .",
    "it enables multiple nodes to create virtual multiple - input multiple - output ( mimo ) configurations in order to provide spatial transmit and/or receive diversity to single - antenna destinations @xcite .",
    "traditional cooperative systems are characterized by the half - duplex constraint that relay nodes can not receive and transmit data simultaneously , a fact that results to bandwidth loss . in order to overcome this bandwidth limitation ,",
    "several techniques have been proposed in the literature @xcite . among them",
    ", the successive relaying scheme in @xcite incorporates multiple relay nodes and proposes a transmission overlap ( source - relay , relay - destination ) in order to mimic an ideal full - duplex transmission .",
    "however , this scheme refers to scenarios with a long distance between the relays and thus inter - relay interference is not considered .",
    "an extension of this work is discussed in @xcite , where the authors consider that iri is strong ( co - located or clustered relays ) and can always be decoded at the affected nodes ; this decoded iri is exploited in a superposition coding scheme that significantly improves the diversity - multiplexing tradeoff ( dmt ) performance of the system . on the other hand ,",
    "relay selection has been introduced as a promising practical solution that achieves full diversity by keeping the implementation complexity low . in earlier works in which relays",
    "were assumed to lack data buffers , relay selection was mainly based on the max - min criterion and its variations ( see , for example , @xcite and references therein ) . as a result , based on either proactive or reactive criteria ,",
    "the relay that received the source signal is the same with the one that is subsequently forwarding the signal towards the destination .    in the adoption of buffer - aided relays ,",
    "this coupling is broken as different relays could be selected for transmission and reception .",
    "buffering at the relay nodes is a promising solution for cooperative networks and motivates the investigation of new protocols and transmission schemes .",
    "_ @xcite propose a novel criterion based on the @xmath0 relay selection ( mmrs ) , in which the relay with the best source - relay ( sr ) link is selected for reception and the relay with the best relay - destination ( rd ) link is selected for transmission .",
    "the mmrs implementation with buffers of finite size is subsequently also discussed .",
    "another work that adopts mmrs is @xcite which aims to recover the half - duplex loss by adopting successive transmissions . as the proposed topology aims to mimic full - duplex relaying ,",
    "different relays are selected in the same time slot .",
    "however , relays are considered isolated and the effect of inter - relay interference is ignored , while relay buffers are never considered to be full or empty .",
    "also , outage performance is examined for a fixed rate and the achieved capacity for adaptive rate .",
    "@xcite proposed the @xmath1 protocol , which allows all the sr and rd links to enter the competition for the best link through which a signal will be transmitted , thus providing additional freedom in the scheduled transmissions at each time slot .",
    "adaptive link selection , but for a single relay setup , is proposed by zlatanov _",
    "_ in @xcite .",
    "the performance potentials of the buffer - aided relaying concept are further investigated in @xcite , where the authors show that half - duplex relaying with storage capabilities outperforms ideal full - duplex relaying .",
    "although most of the studies refer to one - way relaying , the work in @xcite studies the employment of buffers in a two - way relay network and investigates an opportunistic scheduling that maximizes the system sum - rate while ensuring buffer stability .    in the majority of the aforementioned works the main target is outage probability reduction or throughput improvement .",
    "another characteristic that is of utmost importance in wireless cooperative networks is energy - efficiency .",
    "the proposed algorithm in @xcite selects the end - to - end paths based on their achievable capacities and uses hierarchical and adaptive modulation . in this way",
    "the power of the source and the transmitting relay are adjusted according to the level required for successful reception . in various works ( see , e.g. , @xcite and references therein ) relays are assumed to be battery operated . due to this practical assumption ,",
    "the proposed algorithms select the best relays according to two factors .",
    "first , the selected relay will spend the minimum amount of energy that is required to surpass the outage threshold of the network .",
    "second , by considering the remaining energy of each node , relays that were selected often will be protected in order to extend their operation and increase the network lifetime .",
    "a variation of this energy - efficiency metric is provided in @xcite , where circuit - energy consumption is considered and dynamic time allocation is implemented . also in @xcite , by modeling the residual energy of each relay as an energy state , the transition probabilities among states are calculated and an expression of the average network lifetime is obtained in a variable gain amplify - and - forward relay network .",
    "optimal energy allocation techniques are presented in @xcite , where the effects of co - channel interference at the relays and the destination are studied .",
    "closed - form expression for the outage probability is derived and in addition , under different global and individual energy constraints , resource allocation algorithms are provided in a multi - relay network .",
    "finally , in @xcite , a multi - user network is investigated aiming to improve the energy efficiency per user , so that relays and subcarriers are selected and allocated accordingly for each user .",
    "this work proposes a buffer - aided successive opportunistic relaying protocol with iri cancellation . through the successive nature of this protocol",
    ", we aim to recover the half - duplex constraint of cooperative relaying .",
    "in contrast to other works in the literature , we consider the arising iri and with the aid of buffers we mitigate the detrimental effect of iri through interference cancellation , if feasible . more specifically , we propose the @xmath2 relay selection policy that acts in conjunction with interference cancellation and adjusts the power levels required accordingly to support the end - to - end communication .",
    "the @xmath2 relay selection policy in terms of outage probability and diversity , is analyzed by modeling the evolution of the relay buffers as a mc .",
    "the construction of the state transition matrix and the related steady state of the mc are studied ; then , the derivation of the outage probability is presented .",
    "the contribution of this work is twofold .",
    "* buffer - aided relays and interference cancellation are combined for the first time , thus decoupling the necessity of the receiving relay to transmit in the next time slot , even if the channel is in outage .",
    "hence , an extra degree of freedom is obtained for choosing which relay to transmit , so that iri cancellation is also achieved , if it is feasible . also , the current channel state is the deciding factor in choosing a relay rather than the prediction of the next channel state .",
    "* power adjustment is also included in our scheme . in this way",
    ", the total energy expenditure in the network is minimized , as well as the inter - relay interference , thus reducing the outage probability of the network .",
    "the @xmath2 relay selection policy outperforms the current state - of - the - art schemes , with which it is compared .",
    "the outage , throughput and energy efficiency performance metrics considered are uniformly improved .",
    "the structure of this paper is as follows . in section  [ sec : model ] , we present the system model .",
    "section  [ policies ] reviews the most relevant relay selection schemes and section  [ sec : minpow ] introduces the @xmath2 relay selection policy proposed herein .",
    "then , a model of this communication scheme and an outage probability analysis is performed in section  [ sec : outage ] , while illustrative examples and numerical results are provided in sections [ sec : examples ] and  [ sec : numerical ] , respectively .",
    "finally , conclusions are discussed in section  [ sec : conclusions ] .",
    "we assume a simple cooperative network consisting of one source @xmath3 , one destination @xmath4 and a cluster @xmath5 with @xmath6 decode - and - forward ( df ) relays @xmath7 ( @xmath8 ) .",
    "all nodes are characterized by the half - duplex constraint and therefore they can not transmit and receive simultaneously . a direct link between the source and the destination does not exist and communication can be established only via relays @xcite .",
    "each relay @xmath9 holds a buffer ( data queue ) @xmath10 of capacity @xmath11 ( number of data elements ) where it can store source data that has been decoded at the relay and can be forwarded to the destination .",
    "the parameter @xmath12 , @xmath13 $ ] denotes the number of data elements that are stored in buffer @xmath10 ; at the beginning , each relay buffer is empty ( i.e. , @xmath14 for all @xmath15 ) we denote by @xmath16 all the relays for which their buffer is not empty , i.e. , @xmath17 , @xmath18 .",
    "time is considered to be slotted and at each time - slot the source @xmath3 and ( possibly ) one of the relays @xmath9 transmit with power @xmath19 and @xmath20 , respectively .",
    "the source node is assumed to be saturated ( it has always data to transmit ) and the information rate is equal to @xmath21 bits per channel use ( bpcu ) . the retransmission process is based on an acknowledgment / negative - acknowledgment ( ack / nack ) mechanism , in which short - length error - free packets are broadcasted by the receivers ( either a relay @xmath9 or the destination @xmath4 ) over a separate narrow - band channel in order to inform the network of that packet s reception status .",
    "all wireless links exhibit fading and additive white gaussian noise ( awgn ) .",
    "the fading is assumed to be stationary , with frequency non - selective rayleigh block fading .",
    "this means that the fading coefficients @xmath22 ( for the @xmath23 link ) remain constant during one slot , but change independently from one slot to another according to a circularly symmetric complex gaussian distribution with zero mean and unit variance .",
    "the channel gains are @xmath24 and exponentially distributed , taking values in the range @xmath25 $ ] . the power level chosen by the transmitter @xmath26",
    "is denoted by @xmath27 .",
    "@xmath28 denotes the variance of thermal noise at the receiver @xmath26 , which is assumed to be awgn .",
    "since we implement successive relaying , we ( may ) have concurrent transmissions by the source and one relay taking place at the same time slot .",
    "this results in iri and the source has to consider the interference power that the candidate relay for reception will receive by the transmitting relay",
    ".     communicates with destination @xmath4 via a cluster of relays @xmath7 , @xmath29 $ ] . ]",
    "it is worth noting that our focus is to investigate the performance of a new buffer - aided successive opportunistic relay selection scheme under a global channel state information ( csi ) assumption and hence , the implementation issues are beyond the scope of this work .",
    "note , however , that conventional centralized / distributed half - duplex relay selection approaches can be applied for the implementation of the proposed scheme ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the interference power at the @xmath15-th receiver , @xmath30 , in its general case , includes the interference from all the transmitters ( belonging in a set @xmath31 ) in the network apart from the intended transmitter @xmath26 and the thermal noise , and is given by @xmath32 therefore , the signal - to - interference - and - noise ratio ( sinr ) at the receiver @xmath15 is given by @xmath33 the quality of service ( qos ) is measured in terms of sinr .",
    "hence , independently of nodal distribution and traffic pattern , a transmission from transmitter to its corresponding receiver is successful ( error - free ) if the sinr of the receiver is greater or equal to the _ capture ratio _ @xmath34 .",
    "therefore , we require that @xmath35 the value of @xmath34 depends on the modulation and coding characteristics of the radio .",
    "due to battery limitations , we assume that each transmitting node @xmath26 ( source and relays ) has a maximum power @xmath36 .",
    "in this section , we briefly review the main buffer - based relay selection policies used in the literature .      the @xmath37 relay selection policy @xcite , @xcite is considered as the optimal selection scheme for conventional df relay setups without buffers and is used as our baseline relay selection strategy .",
    "the selected relay is the one that provides the `` best '' ( strongest ) end - to - end path between the source and the destination .",
    "the @xmath37 selection policy ensures a full diversity ( equal to the number of the relays ( e.g. @xmath6 ) ) and refers to a standard cooperative protocol where communication is performed in two time slots : a ) in the first time slot , the source transmits b ) in the second time slot , the selected relay forwards the data received by the source towards the destination .",
    "the @xmath37 relay selection policy can be written as @xmath38 where @xmath39 denotes the selected relay .",
    "although the @xmath37 selection scheme achieves a diversity equal to @xmath6 , it does not take into account the fact that relays are equipped with buffers and their potential benefits .",
    "the selected relay forwards the received data ( in case of a successful decoding ) immediately in the next time slot to the destination and therefore the ability of the relays to store at least a limited number of data packets is not elaborated .",
    "the @xmath37 relay selection policy implemented in a successive relaying network takes a different form if the iri can be canceled at the relays .",
    "in@xcite , a reactive relay selection policy is proposed .",
    "more specifically , instead of considering only the _ sr _ and _ rd _ channel gains , the feasibility of ic is also examined . in this way , with a very simple ic condition the following two cases for relay selection are given .    * if candidate relay @xmath9 can perform ic then it may be selected to receive from the source based on the following value : @xmath38 * on the other hand , if @xmath9 can not perform ic then it can be selected after competing with the rest of the relays as below : @xmath40    it is obvious that by having two simultaneous transmissions by the source and the transmitting relay reduces the diversity of the network as @xmath39 can not participate in the selection process due to the half - duplex constraint . on the other hand , if iri is effectively mitigated , a full - duplex behavior can be achieved and the half - duplex loss is leveraged .",
    "the @xmath0 relay selection @xcite is the first policy that exploits buffering capability at the relay nodes and is used as a reference selection scheme .",
    "given that the relay nodes are equipped with buffers and thus can store the data received from the source , the @xmath0 policy splits the relay selection decision in two parts and selects the relay with the best source - relay link for reception and the relay with the best relay - destination link for transmission .",
    "the @xmath0 selection policy respects the conventional two - slot cooperative transmission where the first slot is dedicated for the source transmission and the second slot for the relaying transmission , but the relay node may not be the same for both phases of the protocol .",
    "the @xmath0 relay selection policy can be written as @xmath41 where @xmath42 and @xmath43 denote the relay selected for the first phase and the second phase of the cooperative protocol , respectively .",
    "it has been proven that the @xmath0 relay selection policy also ensures full diversity equal to the number of the relays and it provides a significant coding gain in comparison to the conventional @xmath37 selection scheme .",
    "however , it is worth noting the the above selection strategy assumes that no relay s buffer can be empty or full at any time and thus all relays have always the option of receiving or transmitting ( * ? ? ?",
    "therefore , the @xmath0 relay selection considered provides the optimal performance that can be achieved by such a scheme , thus yielding the lowest outage bound .",
    "the previous relay selection schemes are associated with a two - slot cooperative protocol where the schedule for the source and relay transmission is fixed a priori . here , this limitation is relaxed and each slot is allowed to be allocated dynamically to the source or a relay transmission , according to the instantaneous quality of the links and the status of the relays buffers .",
    "more specifically , the proposed @xmath1 relay selection scheme exploits fully the flexibility offered by the buffers at the relay nodes and at each time selects the strongest link for transmission ( source or relay transmission ) among the available links .",
    "a source - relay link is considered to be available when the corresponding relay node is not full and therefore can receive data from the source , while a relay - destination link is considered to be available when the relay node is not empty and thus can transmit source s data towards the destination .",
    "the proposed scheme compares the quality of the available links and adjust the relay selection decision and the time slot allocation to the strongest link .",
    "if a source - relay link is the strongest link , the source transmits and the corresponding relay is selected for reception ; on the other hand , if a relay - destination link is the strongest link , the corresponding relay is selected for transmission . the @xmath1 relay selection policy can be analytically expressed as follows : @xmath44 where @xmath39 denotes the selected relay ( either for transmission or reception ) and the function @xmath45 , gives the number of data elements that are stored in buffer @xmath10 .",
    "in this section , we present a novel relay selection policy called @xmath2 .",
    "this relay selection scheme is associated with a one - slot cooperative protocol ( similar to the @xmath1 relay selection policy @xcite and the one in @xcite where however , iri and power minimization are not considered ) , rather than two - slot protocols ( as in @xcite ) . at each time slot",
    ", the source @xmath3 transmits data to a selected relay ( denoted by @xmath46 ) with a non - full buffer , and another relay with a non - empty buffer ( denoted by @xmath47 , @xmath48 ) transmits data to the destination @xmath4 .",
    "a packet is successfully transmitted from the transmitting relay @xmath49 to the destination @xmath4 if the signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) , denoted by @xmath50 , is greater than or equal to the capture ratio @xmath34 , i.e. , @xmath51 a packet is successfully transmitted from source @xmath3 to the receiving relay @xmath52 , if the signal - to - interference - and - noise ratio ( sinr ) at the receiving relay , denoted by @xmath53 is greater than or equal to @xmath34 , i.e. , @xmath54 where @xmath55 is a factor indicating whether interference cancellation is satisfied and it is described by @xmath56    the following proposition states that if the maximum powers @xmath57 and @xmath58 are large enough ( thus not imposing any limitations / constraints ) , for each pair of relays @xmath52 and @xmath49 , then we can always find power levels such that interference cancellation conditions are satisfied .",

    "hence , the worst case complexity of the problem is @xmath95 .",
    "in this section , the outage probability behavior of the @xmath2 relay selection scheme follows the theoretical framework of @xcite , which is also a relay network with finite buffers .",
    "the main differentiation compared to @xcite is that we have additional ways of transmission through successive relaying ; in other words , we have additional links from a certain buffer state to others .",
    "this will be more clearly reflected in the illustrative example .",
    "we first formulate the state transition matrix of the markov chain ( mc ) , denoted as @xmath96 , @xmath97 .",
    "more specifically , @xmath98 are the transition probabilities to move from a state @xmath99 to a state @xmath100 .",
    "the transition probability depends on the number of relays that are available for cooperation .",
    "as we consider finite buffers , relays that have full buffers can not compete in the selection of the best relay that will receive the source s signal .",
    "also , relays with empty buffers are not able to transmit and as a result they are excluded from the best transmitting relay selection . moreover , when there is no possibility of transmitting successively through two selected relays our system reduces to the @xmath1 relay selection scheme . the number of links that are available in this mode is reduced if the relays have full or empty buffers .",
    "let @xmath101 denote all the possible out - going links from state @xmath99 . among them",
    ", @xmath102 links are considered through non - successive ( also referred to as _ _ single - link _ _ ) transmissions , while @xmath103 through successive transmissions .",
    "these transmissions endure for one transmission phase . since the source and one relay will transmit simultaneously",

    "we denote with superscript @xmath104 the non - successive ( single - link ) transmissions and with @xmath105 the successive ones .",

    "the third metric that we study is the power reduction achieved by @xmath2 .",
    "the value on y - axis refers to differential power gain i.e. the power in db that is saved when the proposed scheme is employed .",
    "the reference scheme that is used to calculate the power gain is a buffer - aided relay selection scheme that does not employ power minimization in the selection process and transmits each time with the maximum available power .",
    "for example , if the fixed power scheme uses 6 db to perform a transmission and @xmath2 reduces this requirement to 2 db we keep the difference of 4 db and we calculate the average after the end of all transmissions for this step of maximum power value . as stated in section  [ sec : minpow ] , when @xmath2 relay selection is used , a search for the pair of relays that require the minimum sum of transmission powers starts for a given snr threshold .",
    "similarly , for the case of single link transmission , the link requiring the minimum power to achieve a successful transmission is selected .",
    "we note that when a successive transmission is feasible both the source and a relay transmit , resulting in increased power reduction margin as the most appropriate relay pair is selected . on the contrary ,",
    "when a single - link transmission occurs , we calculate power reduction by comparing the power used by the transmitting node in the fixed power scheme to the power used by the transmitting node in the selected single - link .",

    "the limiting factor is inter - relay interference .",
    "we see that for increased values of @xmath11 greater than 8 , differences in power are minor but still , the selection bound is not met .",
    "this comes as a consequence of the difficulty to cancel iri since only two relays are employed in the transmission .     and",
    "@xmath139 . for increased values of @xmath11",
    "greater than 8 , power differences are minor , however the selection bound is not met . as only two relays",
    "are employed in the transmission iri cancellation is difficult . ]    in order to examine the effect of additional relays , we present corresponding results in fig .",
    "[ pow_kvl8 ] .",
    "we see that adding more relays to the cluster , the relay selection alternatives increase , thus leading to improved power minimization . as fixed transmission rate",

    "since fixed transmission rate is adopted , a saturation is observed as differences in the required power for transmission are very close after @xmath171 relays . ]",
    "in this paper we proposed an opportunistic relaying protocol that minimizes the total energy expenditure per time slot under an iri cancellation scheme . by making use of power adaptation and buffer - aided relays , the detrimental effect of iri through interference cancellation",
    "is mitigated .",
    "it is the first time that interference cancellation is combined with buffer aided relays to mitigate iri and on top this is combined with power adaptation for minimizing the energy expenditure ; the examples demonstrate the improvements achieved . for the evaluation of the performance of the @xmath2 relay selection policy , we performed comparisons with other schemes and the results showed that by combining successive transmission and a buffer - aided half - duplex protocol , gains were achieved in both outage and throughput performance .",
    "moreover , we studied the effect of changing the buffer sizes and relay numbers on the outage , throughput and power reduction metrics . when the number of buffers and relays becomes large enough , the gain obtained by our proposed scheme vanishes .",
    "this observation suggests the need for additional approaches that will offer new characteristics to @xmath2 , thus improving its potential .",
    "a future direction includes the study of network coding schemes for further throughput improvement in this network setup and exploitation of the inter - relay interference by using superposition coding schemes .",
