    "the cold atoms in optical lattices are well known for their high controllability .",
    "recently , a three - component ( color degrees of freedom ) fermionic gas has been realized using @xmath2 atoms with three hyperfine states @xcite . in this system a balanced population of each color atoms has been achieved , while color - dependent three interactions are different , preventing the emergence of su(3 ) symmetry .",
    "highly symmetric systems with su(6 ) symmetry and su(2)@xmath3su(6 ) symmetry have been realized in @xmath4yb atoms @xcite and in a mixture of @xmath5yb atoms and @xmath4yb atoms @xcite , respectively .",
    "a su(10 ) symmetric system has been realized in @xmath6sr atoms @xcite .",
    "these results mean that the cold fermionic atoms in optical lattices constitute a quantum simulator for studying the correlation effects of multicomponent lattice fermions .    currently , one of the most attractive research fields in condensed - matter physics is superconductivity in strongly correlated multiorbital systems .",
    "for instance , superconductivity mediated by orbital fluctuations has been discussed as a possible mechanism of unconventional characters of the heavy - fermion superconductivity in @xmath7 @xcite and @xmath8 @xcite . for iron - based superconductors ,",
    "it has been pointed out that the electron correlation effects in the multiorbital system play a key role in the appearance of superconductivity . as regards cooper - pairing symmetry , both the spin fluctuation - mediated @xmath9 wave @xcite and",
    "the orbital fluctuation - mediated @xmath10 wave @xcite have been proposed theoretically . in the former",
    "the gap function changes the sign between different fermi surfaces , while in the latter the sign of the gap function is unchanged .",
    "pairing symmetry and its origin have been actively debated . as discussed later , in three - component repulsive fermionic atoms in optical lattices three kinds of quantum fluctuations",
    "can be controlled , leading to a change in the superfluid pairing symmetry between an @xmath0 wave and a @xmath11 wave .",
    "thus , three - component repulsive fermionic atoms in optical lattices act as a minimal model for discussing the cooper - pairing mechanism and symmetry of multicomponent repulsive lattice fermions .",
    "our findings provide an insight into the cooper - pairing mechanism of , for instance , multiorbital correlated electron systems .",
    "we have already investigated repulsively interacting three - component fermionic atoms in optical lattices with a balanced population @xcite .",
    "we have shown that characteristic mott states can appear in spite of half filling , where the average atom number per site is the noninteger 3/2 .",
    "when two of the three repulsions are stronger than the other , pairs of weakly repulsing atoms are formed to avoid the two stronger repulsions .",
    "this mott state is called the paired mott insulator ( pmi ) @xcite .",
    "when two of the three repulsions are weaker than the other , atoms with the strongest repulsion undergo a mott transition while atoms with the remaining color stay a fermi liquid .",
    "this state is called the color - selective mott state ( csm ) @xcite . in the ground state at half filling , two kinds of the staggered ordered states appear in the respective parameter regions : a color - density wave ( cdw ) and a color - selective antiferromagnet ( csaf ) @xcite . in the cdw paired",
    "atoms with two different colors and atoms with the remaining color alternately occupy different sites , while in the csaf localized atoms with two different colors alternately occupy different sites .",
    "these results suggest a possibility of emergence of a superfluid state . using a dynamical mean - field theory ( dmft )",
    "we have shown that a superfluid state appears at close to half filling in the parameters for the cdw @xcite .",
    "it has been also shown that a superfluid appears at close to the pmi transition point in the ` color paramagnetic ' sector at half filling @xcite . in these superfluid states , atoms with the weakest repulsion form cooper pairs while atoms with the remaining color stay a fermi liquid .",
    "these calculations are based on a dmft , thus making it difficult to discuss cooper - pairing symmetry .    in this paper , we investigate superfluid pairing symmetry in repulsively interacting three - component fermionic atoms in square optical lattices by using an liashberg equation . we show that when two of the three repulsions are sufficiently strong , pairing symmetry is an extended @xmath0 wave , although the superfluid state appears adjacent to the pmi in the phase diagram .",
    "when two of the three repulsions are weaker than the other , a superfluid state with a @xmath1-wave pairing appears . from our calculations of the effective interaction , we show that this change in pairing symmetry can be attributed to the change in the dominant quantum fluctuations among the local density fluctuations of unpaired atoms , the nonlocal cdw fluctuations , and the nonlocal csaf fluctuations .",
    "the low - energy properties of the ultracold atoms in optical lattices are well described by the following hubbard - type hamiltonian @xcite : @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the nearest - neighbor hopping integral , and @xmath14 and @xmath15 are creation ( annihilation ) and number operators of a fermion with color @xmath16 at the @xmath17th site .",
    "the subscript @xmath18 is the summation over the nearest - neighbor sites .",

    "we focus on the situation with a balanced population .",
    "thus we set the chemical potential @xmath23 so as to satisfy @xmath24 , which yields @xmath25 at half filling .",
    "the on - site repulsive interactions between color-@xmath22 and @xmath26 atoms are denoted as @xmath27 .",
    "we consider that cooper pairs are formed between color-1 and 2 atoms .",
    "for this purpose , we set @xmath28 and @xmath29 for convenience , which yield @xmath30 and @xmath31 .",
    "we discuss pairing symmetry by solving the following liashberg equation for the superfluid order parameter @xmath32 within a weak - coupling theory : @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the number of @xmath35-point meshes , @xmath36 , and @xmath37 is the bare energy dispersion of the color-1 and 2 atoms measured from the chemical potential .",
    "the eigenvalue @xmath38 is a measure of the dominant pairing symmetry and it reaches unity at the transition point . the effective pairing interaction between color-1 and 2 atoms is calculated by collecting random - phase - approximation - type bubble diagrams and ladder - type diagrams , and is given as @xmath39 where @xmath40 @xmath41 here , @xmath42 is the bare susceptibility of color-1 and 2 atoms , @xmath43 is the bare susceptibility of color-3 atoms with @xmath44 being the bare energy dispersion of color-3 atoms measured from the chemical potential , and @xmath45 is the fermi distribution function .    according to eq .",
