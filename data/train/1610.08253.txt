    "chemically peculiar ( cp ) stars , which comprise about 15% of the upper main sequence stars between spectral types early b to early f , are characterized by abnormal line strengths of one or several elements .",
    "this peculiar abundance pattern is thought to be produced by selective processes ( radiative levitation , gravitational settling ) operating in calm radiative atmospheres @xcite .",
    "evidence has accumulated that there is no clear boundary between normal and cp stars but rather a smooth transition in regard to peculiarity @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the cp phenomenon is not restricted to a particular evolutionary stage . divided the cp stars into the following four subgroups : cp1 stars ( the metallic line or am / fm stars ) , cp2 stars ( the magnetic bp / ap stars ) , cp3 stars ( the hgmn stars ) and cp4 stars ( the he - weak stars ) .",
    "further groups of cp stars were subsequently defined , like e.g. the he - strong stars ( @xcite ) or the @xmath1 bootis stars ( @xcite ) .",
    "the cp2 stars differ from the cp1 and cp3 objects in that they possess globally organized magnetic fields from about 300 g to several tens of kilogauss ( ) , which also holds true for the cp4 objects .",
    "cp2 stars show a nonuniform distribution of chemical elements , which manifests itself in the formation of spots and patches of enhanced element abundance , in which flux is redistributed through bound - free and bound - bound transitions . therefore , as the star rotates , strictly periodic changes are observed in the spectra and brightness of many cp2 stars , which are satisfactorily explained by the oblique rotator model @xcite . cp2",
    "stars exhibiting photometric variability are traditionally referred to as @xmath0 canum venaticorum ( acv ) variables @xcite .",
    "cp3 stars do not show strong large - scale organized magnetic fields , and the discussion about the presence of tangled magnetic fields is ongoing .",
    "however , the line - profile variations detected in the spectra of these stars have also been interpreted in the terms of abundance inhomogeneities ( @xcite ) .",
    "therefore , rotationally induced photometric variability at some level would be expected .",
    "while photometric variations in cp3 stars have been established beyond doubt , the underlying mechanism is still a matter of debate .",
    "however , rotational modulation due to surface spots in cp3 stars is believed to produce only marginal photometric amplitudes @xcite , which can likely be studied with high - precision ( space ) photometry only . in the preparatory stage of our investigation",
    ", some cp3 stars were checked for light variability in asas-3 data , albeit with null results , which substantiates this assumption . however , this question is beyond the scope of the present investigation , which concentrates on the classical magnetic cp2/4 stars .",
    "cp2 stars are natural atomic and magnetic laboratories and , because of their unusual abundance patterns , ideal testing grounds for the evaluation of model atmospheres . increasing the sample of known cp2 stars is therefore an important task considerable effort has been devoted to in the past ( ) .",
    "our own efforts in this respect ( ) have produced extensive lists of new acv variables and candidates that have been found by an investigation of publicly available sky survey data . investigated the photometric variability of ap stars using observations from the third phase of the all sky automated survey ( asas-3 , * ? ? ? * ) and identified 323 variable stars ( mostly acv variables ) , 246 of which were reported as variable objects for the first time . as an expansion of this work , we here report on the discovery of an additional 360 variable stars in asas-3 data which have been found by a refined analysis approach . in agreement with our expectations ,",
    "the new sample is also composed mostly of bona - fide acv variables .",
    "observations and target selection are described in section [ observ ] , data analysis and classification in section [ dataan ] .",
    "results are presented and discussed in section [ result ] , and we conclude in section [ conclu ] .",
    "the aim of the all sky automated survey ( asas ) is the detection and investigation of any kind of photometric variability . to this end",
    ", asas constantly monitored the entire southern sky and part of the northern sky to about @xmath2@xmath3 + 28 .",
    "the third phase of the project , asas-3 , lasted from 2000 until 2009 @xcite . the employed instrumentation , which was situated at the 10-inch astrograph dome of the las campanas observatory in chile , consisted of two wide - field telescopes equipped with f/2.8 200 mm minolta lenses and 2048 x 2048 ap 10 apogee detectors that covered a field of sky of 88x88 .",
    "about 10@xmath4 sources brighter than @xmath5 14 mag were monitored in johnson @xmath6 .",
    "the achieved ccd resolution was about 148 / pixel , which led to an astrometric accuracy of around 3  5  for bright stars and up to 15.5  for fainter stars .",
    "as a result , photometry in crowded fields , as in star clusters , is rather uncertain . a field",
    "was typically observed every one , two or three days @xcite . this observing cadence results in strong daily aliasing and renders the interpretation of the resulting fourier amplitude spectra ambiguous .",
    "the asas-3 archive contains reasonable photometry for stars in the magnitude range 7@xmath7@xmath6@xmath714 .",
    "however , the most accurate data were obtained for targets in the magnitude range 8@xmath7@xmath6@xmath710 . here",
    ", the typical scatter is about 0.01mag ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "however , because of the long time base of almost ten years , asas-3 data allow for the detection of periodic signals with very small amplitudes . for instance , @xcite identified periodic variables with a range of variability of 0.01  0.02mag in the magnitude range of 7@xmath7@xmath6@xmath710 .",
    "@xcite estimated that periodic signals with amplitudes as low as about 5millimag ( mmag ) can be detected .",
    "@xcite has shown that the zero - points of the asas-3 and hipparcos photometry agree to within about @xmath80.015 mag for stars lying close to the frame center .",
    "however , flat - fielding issues , missing color information and blending may result in much larger differences .",
    "we have investigated the agreement between mean asas-3 @xmath6 magnitudes and @xmath6 magnitudes given by @xcite for the stars of our final sample .",
    "the results are shown in figure [ fig_asastycho ] and indicate very good general agreement between both sources . in most cases ,",
    "unresolved close companions are responsible for the observed discrepancies .     magnitudes and @xmath6 magnitudes given by @xcite for the stars of our final sample.,scaledwidth=47.0% ]      an intial list of target stars was created by selecting cp2 stars or cp2 star candidates and he - weak ( cp4 ) / he - strong objects from the most recent version of the catalogue of ap , hgmn , and am stars .",
    "objects in the rm09 catalogue are not explicitly subdivided according to the classification established by .",
    "we therefore resorted to the listed spectral types to distinguish between the different groups of cp stars ( mainly denoted as ` si ' , ` sr ' , ` sr eu si ' , ` he weak ' , ` hg mn ' , and so on ) . the resulting list of stars was cross - matched with the tycho-2 catalogue ; unlike our initial approach , where we defined a cut - off at @xmath9@xmath311mag ( cf .",
    "paper 1 , section 2 ) , no brightness limit was imposed .",
    "in addition to that , a systematic investigation of early - type ( spectral types b / a ) variable stars of undetermined type in the aavso international variable star index ( vsx ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) yielded additional acv candidates , which were added to our target list .",
    "we consulted the gcvs @xcite , vsx , simbad and vizier databases in order to check for an entry in variability catalogues and to collect literature information on our target stars .",
    "known acv variables with well determined parameters were dropped from our sample ; suspected or misclassified variables and variables of undetermined type were kept .",
    "the light curves of our sample stars were downloaded from the asas-3 website . for the present investigation ,",
    "a refined analysis approach was developed with the intention of discovering variable objects that might have been missed by the imposed criteria in our previous work ( paper 1 ) . in order to retain as many objects as possible ,",
    "no lower limit was imposed on the number of observations in the asas-3 archive . in paper 1",
    ", we restricted our analysis to promising candidates in order to keep our sample down to a manageable size . as promising candidates , we defined stars showing a larger scatter than usually observed for apparently constant stars in the corresponding magnitude range with comparable instruments @xcite .",
    "no such criteria were imposed in the present investigation ; instead , every individual asas dataset was roughly cleaned of outliers and searched for periodic signals in the frequency domain of 0@xmath3@xmath10 ( cycles per day ; c / d hereafter)@xmath320 using period04 @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the periodicity detection threshold was lowered significantly .",
    "only objects with semi - amplitudes of @xmath11 0.007 mag ( as derived with period04 ) were considered in paper 1 . in the present investigation ,",
    "all objects exhibiting variability with a semi - amplitude of at least 0.004 mag were subjected to a more detailed analysis .",
    "this limit is an experiental value based on our own extensive experience in dealing with the asas-3 data and the results of @xcite and @xcite .",
    "it was chosen as a compromise between retaining variables with small amplitudes and eliminating spurious detections .    in the next step of analysis ,",
    "left - over data points with a quality flag of d ( = worst data , probably useless ) were rejected and remaining outliers were carefully removed by visual inspection .",
    "furthermore , the data were checked for the presence of systematic trends .",
    "these were mostly due to strong blending effects which might result in significant additional scatter due to the inclusion of part of a neighbouring star s flux @xcite or instrumental long - term trends that could introduce spurious signals into the data .",
    "depending on the severity of artifacts , the affected datasets were either rejected or the trends were removed .    to refine the initial frequency analysis ,",
    "the pretreated datasets were again searched for periodic signals in the frequency domain of 0@xmath3@xmath10(c / d)@xmath310 with period04 .",
    "the data were folded on the resulting best fitting frequency and visually inspected .",
    "objects exhibiting convincing phase plots were kept .",
    "the light curves of cp2 stars can be well described by a sine wave and its first harmonic ( ) .",
    "we performed a least - squares fit to the data using period04 .",
    "each light curve was fitted using a fourier series consisting of the fundamental sine wave and its first harmonic , from which the light curve parameters ( semi - amplitudes @xmath12 , @xmath13 , and the corresponding phases @xmath14 , @xmath15 ) were derived .",
    "as pointed out , the light curves of most acv variables are sinusoidal . in orientations where two photometric spots of overabundant optically active elements come into view during a single rotation cycle ,",
    "the light curve becomes a double wave .",
    "if the two spots are of similar extent and photometric properties , the resulting maxima will be of approximately the same height .",
    "therefore , a twice longer ( or shorter ) rotation period can not be excluded .",
    "this holds especially true for objects with very small amplitudes and/or significant scatter in their light curves .",
    "in addition to that , alias periods can not be totally excluded because of the strong daily aliasing inherent to asas-3 data ( cf .",
    "section [ charac ] ) .",
    "however , we have checked the period solution of all doubtful cases and are confident that we have come up with the period that fits asas-3 data best .",
    "this assumption is further corroborated by the generally very good agreement of our period solutions to those from the literature ( cf . also paper 1 ) .      for the final classification , all available information ( spectral type , colour indices , period , shape of the light curve , fourier amplitude spectrum ) was taken into account . except for the eclipsing binary systems ( see below ) , all stars in our final sample exhibit a variability pattern that is in general accordance with rotational modulation caused by spots .",
    "hd 66051 ( v414 pup ) is a special case in that it clearly shows both orbital ( eclipses ) and rotational modulation .",
    "however , caution has to be taken , as it is not straightforward to distinguish between variability induced by rotation and other sources like e.g. pulsation or orbital motion .",
    "this holds especially true when analysing variable stars whose photometric amplitudes are near the detection limit of the employed data , as is the case for many of our targets .",
    "pulsation as the underlying mechanism of the observed variability can be ruled out for most objects of our sample on the following grounds .",
    "the vast majority of our sample stars is found between spectral types b7 to a5 ( see figure [ distri ] ) .",
    "therefore , pulsators that are exclusively found among earlier spectral types , like e.g. @xmath16 cephei variables ( gcvs - type bcep , spectral types @xmath17o8b6 ) , or primarily among later spectral types , as e.g. the @xmath18 doradus stars ( gcvs - type gdor , spectral types @xmath17a7f7 ) , are not expected to contribute much to our sample .",
    "of course , inaccuracies / difficulties in spectral classification have to be considered , and the spectral types shown in figure [ distri ] might be uncertain by several subclasses .",
    "furthermore , our target stars exhibit photometric periods longer than @xmath19 0.5 days .",
    "we can thus exclude the presence of @xmath2 scuti variables ( gcvs - type dsct ) or other short period pulsators .",
    "on the other hand , some types of pulsating variables partly overlap with acv stars in respect to spectral type and period .",
    "the so - called slowly pulsating b ( gcvs - type spb ) stars , for instance , are encountered down to spectral type b9 ( figure [ distri ] ) and exhibit periods between about 0.4 to 5 days .",
    "the @xmath18 doradus stars are found between spectral types a7 to f7 ; observed periods usually range from 0.3 to 3 days .",
    "one way of distinguishing these types of variable stars is an investigation of their fourier amplitude spectra .",
    "many kinds of pulsators , like e.g. spb and @xmath18 doradus stars , show multiple periods and quite different frequency spectra from rotating variables .",
    "for instance , harmonics of pulsation modes are only expected to be present in frequency spectra when the amplitude is large . on the other hand , harmonics are a consequence of localized spots and a characteristic of the frequency spectra of rotating variables @xcite .    spots form and decay in late - type , active stars , and differential rotation might led to the presence of multiple , closely - spaced periods in these objects . however , the presence of starspots in stars with radiative envelopes , like b / a stars , is still a matter of some controversy .",
    "recently , balona and coworkers have collected evidence that a - type stars are active and show starspots in the same way as their cooler counterparts ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . nevertheless , the spots on cp2 stars are of a different nature ( abundance patches ) and constitute durable configurations that remain stable for decades , probably as a consequence of strong magnetic fields .",
    "differential rotation , however , plays an important role in a - type stars ( ) .",
    "however , to our knowledge , no study of the possible effects of differential rotation on cp2 star light curves exists . judging from the stability of the periods and light curves among acv variables , we assume that these effects , if present , are generally small .",
    "however , it must not be dismissed that the presence of multiple , closely - spaced frequencies in the fourier amplitude spectra of early - type stars might be due to differential rotation and need not automatically imply pulsation . apart from this special scenario , however , the presence of multiple periods is not to be expected in cp2 stars and interpreted by us as an indication of pulsation in a non - cp2 star as the underlying mechanism of the observed photometric variability .",
    "figure [ acvspb ] shows the fourier amplitude spectra of two b - type stars and illustrates the described differences in the frequency spectra between a multi - periodic , pulsating variable ( nsv 24561 , spectral type b3 , likely an spb star ) and a rotating variable ( hd 63204 , spectral type b9psi , a confirmed acv variable , cf . ) .",
    "no harmonics are seen in the spectrum of nsv 24561 , which exhibits two significant low frequencies .",
    "in contrast , only one frequency and its first harmonic are present in the frequency spectrum of hd 63204 .",
    "it has to be kept in mind , though , that these assumptions are simplifications that do not represent nature with all its intricacies .",
    "for instance , recent evidence from kepler data indicates that rotational frequencies might possibly be present in spb variables and result in the presence of harmonics in the corresponding fourier amplitude spectra @xcite .     and @xmath10 ( lower panels ) .",
    "significant frequencies are indicated in red .",
    "the corresponding @xmath20 and @xmath21 aliases are indicated , respectively , in blue and green.,scaledwidth=47.0% ]    finally , and most importantly , the spectra of all these kinds of pulsating variables are not characterized by the abnormal abundance patterns of the cp2/4 stars , which are a confirmed characteristic of most of our target stars and are expected for the cp2 star candidates in our sample . generally , pulsation is not to be expected in cp2 stars .",
    "the only proven form of pulsational variability among this type of cp stars is observed in the so - called rapidly oscillating ap ( roap ) stars @xcite which exhibit photometric variability in the period range of  5 - 20 min ( high - overtone , low - degree , and non - radial pulsation modes ) .",
    "this is very different from what has been observed for our sample stars .",
    "we therefore feel confident in ruling out pulsation as the underlying cause of the observed photometric variability in most of our sample stars .",
    "the discrimination between rotational modulation and variability induced by orbital motion ( as observed in ellipsoidal variables , gcvs - type ell , and eclipsing binaries ) is more difficult , though .",
    "generally , it is not possible to distinguish between both types of variations without additional spectroscopic information ( paper 1 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . for some cp stars , for instance , a double - wave structure of the photometric light curve has been observed .",
    "the light curves of these double - humped acvs are not to be distiguished from the light curves of ellipsoidal variables on grounds of single - passband photometric data alone .",
    "however , it has been shown that the incidence of ellipsoidal or eclipsing variables among cp2 stars is very low ( ) and even in a sample of some hundred stars , only very few ellipsoidal or eclipsing variable star candidates are to be expected ( cf .",
    "paper 1 ) .    we have identified three eclipsing binary stars among our targets ( cpd-20 1640 , hd 66051 , and hd 149334 , cf .",
    "section [ result ] ) .",
    "while the system of hd 66051 ( v414 pup ) definitely hosts a cp2 star , the cp classification of the other two objects is doubtful ; thus , spectroscopic investigations are needed to confirm or reject the assumed presence of a cp2 star in these systems .",
    "furthermore , with the available data , we are not able to distinguish between rotational and orbital modulation as the underlying cause of the photometric variability of the cp4 star hd 161733a .",
    "section [ noteso ] provides a detailed discussion of these objects .    before the background of the characteristic light variations and fourier amplitude spectra , the confirmed cp2/4 nature of our targets , and the available spectral classifications , which go along well with the observed colour indices , the most likely explanation of the observed light variations in the majority of our sample stars is the redistribution of flux in spots of overabundant optically active chemical elements .",
    "we are therefore confident that most of the confirmed cp2/4 stars in our sample are bona - fide acv variables ( @xmath22 ) .",
    "the few exceptions or special cases are commented on in section [ noteso ] .",
    "this assumption is further corroborated by the fact that ( with the exception of the eclipsing binaries ) all light curves of our sample stars can be well represented by a sine wave and its first harmonic - a procedure which has been shown to adequately describe the light curves of acv variables ( cf .",
    "section [ datapr ] ) .",
    "the photometrically variable cp2 star candidates in our sample are here proposed as acv variable candidates ( type acv : in table [ table_master ] ; @xmath23 ) on grounds of their periods and typical photometric variability but need spectroscopic confirmation of their cp status .",
    "the two cp4 objects and the he - strong star are also designated as acv candidates , as other mechanisms beside rotational modulation might be at work in these objects ( section [ noteso ] ) .",
    "employing the methodology outlined above ( sections [ observ ] and [ dataan ] ) , 360 stars exhibiting photometric variability in the accuracy limit of the asas-3 data were identified among the stars of our target list .",
    "we have ruled out pulsation as the underlying mechanism of the observed variability in most of our targets and are confident of the applicability of our classifications .",
