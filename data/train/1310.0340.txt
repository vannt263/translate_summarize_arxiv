    "since the @xmath4-coloring problem is known to be np - complete for any fixed @xmath26 , there has been considerable interest in studying restrictions to various graph classes . for instance",

    "one type of graph class that has been given wide attention in recent years is the class of @xmath28-free graphs , for various graphs @xmath28 @xcite .",

    "this follows from the fact , proved by kamiski and lozin @xcite and independently krl , kratochv ' il , tuza , and woeginger @xcite , that , for any fixed @xmath29 and @xmath30 , the @xmath4-coloring problem is np - complete for the class of graphs of girth at least @xmath31 .",
