    "with the launch of the _ far ultraviolet spectroscopic explorer _ ( fuse ) in 1999 , the astronomical community will have access to the first long duration satellite devoted to high - resolution ( @xmath0@xmath124,00030,000 ) spectroscopic studies of the far ultraviolet ( far - uv ) universe since the _ copernicus _ mission .",
    "fuse will have a point source sensitivity approximately 10,000 times that of _ copernicus _ , which will allow systematic studies of distant regions in the milky way and other galaxies to be conducted at high spectral resolution in the 9051187   bandpass for the first time .",
    "fuse will also be able to observe the far - uv light from distant quasars and active galactic nuclei .",
    "the far - uv wavelength region is rich in spectral line diagnostics of plasmas ranging in temperature from 10@xmath210@xmath3  k. it encompasses the lyman series of  and , as well as resonance lines of the heavy element species , , , , , , , , fi , , , siii , , , , , , , , , , , , and .",
    "weak lines of other heavy elements ( e.g. , cr , mn , ni ) and low excitation fine - structure lines of , , , and  may be visible along some sight lines .",
    "the bandpass also contains molecular lines in the lyman and werner systems of h@xmath4 and hd , and the @xmath5 and @xmath6 bands of co.",
    "during the first three years of operation , approximately half of the fuse observing time will be used by guest investigators selected through a competitive peer - reviewed process , which at the time of writing has been completed for the first observing cycle . a small amount ( roughly 10% ) of the total observing time has also been reserved for the french and canadian astronomical communities .",
    "the remainder will be used by the fuse science team , which will undertake several large science investigations as well as a number of moderate - sized programs designed to study specific astronomical objects or phenomena .",
    "the two primary science programs include :    \\1 ) a study of the d / h ratio and its dependence upon the chemical evolution of the interstellar gas in the milky way and intergalactic gas in the low redshift universe .",
    "\\2 ) a study of the origins and properties of hot ( t@xmath710@xmath810@xmath3  k ) interstellar gas in the milky way and magellanic clouds as traced through  absorption and emission .    to conduct these two comprehensive studies ,",
    "the fuse science team will observe a large number of objects in the galactic disk and halo .",
    "figure  1 is a projection of these sight lines onto the sky .",
    "the sight lines sample the interstellar medium ( ism ) in a variety of directions over distances ranging from a few parsecs to tens of kiloparsecs .",
    "the types of regions to be explored include translucent molecular cloud envelopes , cool neutral clouds , warm neutral clouds , the ionized ism of the galactic disk and halo , supernova remnants , and hot gas associated with bubbles / supershells in the magellanic clouds .",
    "the fuse team will also observe sight lines to quasars and active galactic nuclei to study high velocity clouds , the distant galactic halo and intergalactic gas in the low redshift universe .",
    "a portion of the observing time will be used for short snapshot exposures to determine the best sight lines for extended observations .",
    "the primary objectives of the d / h and  programs are listed below in  2.1 and  2.2 .",
    "most of the deuterium in the universe was created within a few minutes of the big bang , and it is generally believed that the net abundance of deuterium decreases with time due to stellar processing ( astration )",
    ". the present day value of the deuterium abundance should therefore reflect the imprint of big bang nucleosynthesis as well as the subsequent chemical evolution of the universe . to understand this history ,",
    "it is necessary to disentangle local effects from global effects on the d / h ratio , and to integrate the results for a large number of regions into a coherent description of the zero - redshift abundance of deuterium . to this end",
    ", the fuse team has outlined the following objectives :    \\1 ) quantify the effects of local environmental conditions and processes ( e.g. , astration , fractionation , ionization , metal production ) on the measured abundance of deuterium .",
    "\\2 ) determine whether the d / h ratio varies within the milky way and the implications variability would have for the chemical evolution and mixing of the interstellar medium .",
    "\\3 ) determine the d / h ratio in environments with a range of metallicities to use as zero redshift benchmarks for d / h values obtained for low metallicity systems at high redshift .",
    "\\4 ) integrate the milky way d / h results with chemical evolution models to provide a clearer understanding of galactic chemical evolution , the baryonic content of the universe , and big bang nucleosynthesis .",
    "is the primary far - uv line diagnostic of hot ( t@xmath73@xmath910@xmath8 k ) , collisionally ionized gas in the interstellar medium . the production , distribution , and quantity of interstellar gas in this temperature regime outside the local region of the ism surveyed by _",
    "is unknown . since the processes that create hot gas ( e.g. , supernovae ) are closely related to the physical properties of the ism , star - formation , heavy element production , the transport of mass and energy , and the chemical evolution of galaxies , the fuse team has defined the following objectives :    \\1 ) study the physical processes that create interstellar and quantify the role of the hot ism in controlling the physical properties , distribution , and chemical evolution of gas in the galaxy .",
    "\\2 ) study the transport of energy and matter in the galaxy and the effects of a `` disk - halo connection '' on the maintenance of a hot galactic corona .",
    "\\3 ) determine the three dimensional distribution of local hot gas and study the hot / warm gas interfaces at the local cloud / local bubble boundaries .",
    "\\4 ) understand how hot interstellar gases in the milky way , lmc , and smc are related to large scale ism structures ( supernova remnants , supershells , radio loops , etc . ) , and apply this knowledge to studies of galaxies and quasar absorption line systems .",
    "in addition to the d / h and  programs , the fuse science team will conduct studies in a number of areas using data from the key programs as well as supplemental observations .",
    "these investigations will include studies of h@xmath4 and the co / h@xmath4 ratio , hot star winds and atmospheres , cool star chromospheres , supernova remnants ( including sn 1987a ) , cooling flows , active galactic nuclei , jets and circumstellar disks , and planetary atmospheres .",
    "a high - resolution measurement of the heii gunn - peterson effect will also be made if in - orbit background levels are sufficiently low .",
    "for the first cycle of operations , 63 guest investigator programs have been selected to address many intriguing astronomical questions .",
    "the data from team and gi investigations will provide a wealth of information long after the mission has ended .",
    "fuse data will have a six month proprietary period and will be archived at the space telescope science institute in baltimore , maryland .",
    "the properties of high velocity clouds ( hvcs ) are poorly known despite several decades of study .",
    "this is due in large part to the general lack of spectroscopic information at ultraviolet wavelengths .",
    "key pieces of information , such as the metallicity and ionization of the hvcs , have remained elusive .",
    "this situation has improved in recent years as absorption line observations toward quasars and active galactic nuclei have been conducted with the _ hubble space telescope _ ( hst ) .",

    "this determination rests critically upon the assumption that the ionization correction for the amounts of sii and feii arising in ionized gas associated with the hvcs are small [ i.e. , n(s)/n(fe)/n(h)@xmath1n(sii)/n(feii)/n ( ) ] . using hst data , wakker and collaborators ( this volume )",

    "fuse observations will provide valuable information for determining the metallicities and ionization of hvcs .",
    "in particular , measurements of , which has an ionization potential of 13.6 ev and is strongly tied to  through charge exchange reactions ( spitzer 1978 ) , will yield oxygen abundances for neutral clouds .",
    "reliable oxygen abundances currently exist for very few clouds , since the two primary transitions in the hst wavelength region are either heavily saturated in most directions ( @xmath161302.168 ) or extremely weak ( @xmath161355.598 ) ( see meyer , jura , & cardelli 1998 ) .",
    "besides containing  lines , the fuse bandpass encompasses lines of abundant elements that will be useful for estimating gas - phase abundances in the neutral ism and hvcs .",
    "several atomic species have lines spanning a large range in @xmath18 ( e.g. , , , and ) . curves of growth for these species are shown in figure  2 for n()=1@xmath910@xmath13 atoms @xmath14 and no gas - phase depletion onto dust .",

    "the dashed lines are curves for doppler widths of 3 kms@xmath12  ( lower curve ) and 10 kms@xmath12  ( upper curve ) .",
    "the primary obstacle facing abundance studies of hvcs is the difficulty in making accurate determinations of neutral hydrogen column densities through 21 cm emission since some hvcs appear to contain structure at arc minute scales ( c.f . ,",

    "it might be possible to do so when the velocity of the hvc is large ( @xmath20v@xmath21@xmath20@xmath7200 kms@xmath12 ) , the width of the low velocity absorption is small ( fwhm@xmath2250 kms@xmath12 ) , and the amount of intermediate velocity gas is negligible ( n()@xmath22few@xmath910@xmath23 atoms @xmath14 )",
    ". detections in multiple  lines will be necessary since a typical hvc  column density of @xmath710@xmath24 atoms @xmath14 will place most of the  lines on the flat part of the curve of growth .",
    "absorption line observations of ionized gas species in some hvcs indicate that they can contain large quantities of ionized gas ( sembach _ et al .",

    "h@xmath11 imaging of the larger hvc complexes ( tufte , reynolds , & haffner 1998 , this volume ) also reveals the presence of ionized gas .",
    "therefore , it is important to consider whether gas - phase abundances derived from measurements of singly charged ions ( e.g. , , , ) or neutral atoms with first ionization potentials greater than 13.6 ev ( e.g. , , ) are affected by  region contributions .",
    "lines of adjacent ionization stages of many elements in the far - uv ( e.g. , ci - iii , ni - iii , pii - v , siii - iv , cli - ii , ari - ii , and feii - iii ) can be used to estimate ionization corrections when necessary .",
    "ionized gas diagnostics in the far - uv wavelength region span a large range in ionization potential . of these , the strong  lines are the most important for studying gases with t@xmath2510@xmath8 k. the observable lines of other elements trace lower temperature gases ranging from 10@xmath26 to @xmath710@xmath8 k. table  1 contains a list of the ionized gas resonance lines in the fuse bandpass",
