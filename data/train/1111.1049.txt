    "the two predominant astrophysical mechanisms for production of heavy elements in the universe are the slow neutron - capture process ( s - process ) and the rapid neutron - capture process ( r - process ) @xcite .",
    "the r - process occurs in high neutron - density areas in the universe , where the average time for neutron capture is smaller than the half life of the radioactive isotope , and an equilibrium between neutron capture , ( n,@xmath3 ) , and photodisintegration , ( @xmath3,n ) , has established itself .",
    "after this so called steady phase of the r - process , the free neutrons disappear and the nuclei @xmath4 decay back to stability , a process called freeze out .",
    "the most dominant features of the abundance distribution of elements created during the steady phase and freeze out are the large peaks at @xmath5 , @xmath6 and @xmath7 that are due to the r - process flow through closed shells .",
    "the second most pronounced feature is the peak at @xmath8 in the rare - earth region .",
    "while the closed shell peaks are well understood to be formed during the steady phase @xcite , it has been argued that the @xmath8 peak is due to the deformation in the nuclei created after the steady phase , just before freeze out @xcite .",
    "an explanation that has been proposed is that as the deformation maximum is reached the nucleus can not deform more so the next heavier nucleus will be less stable , an effect that can mimic closed shells .",
    "one of the standard references for nuclear masses , and deformations , is the calculations made by mller and nix using the finite range liquid drop model @xcite .",
    "this reference has , for example , been used in the calculations in @xcite , reproducing the @xmath0 r - process peak position but slightly underestimating the low-@xmath9 side and slightly overestimating the high-@xmath9 side . in @xcite ,",
    "the deformations behave smoothly with a maximum in the region around @xmath10@xmath11 . in figure",
    "[ fig : mnsystematics ] , the evaluated experimental deformations from @xcite are shown , but the calculations from @xcite do not appear to follow the same pattern as the experimental data .",
    "besides the larger absolute variation in deformations for different @xmath12 values , the deformation maximum for each @xmath12 does not appear to be as stable around @xmath13 as in the mller and nix calculations . rather , the deformations seem to peak at lower values of @xmath14 for lower values of @xmath12 , further discussed in @xcite .",
    "values ( left ) and @xmath15 harris parameters ( right ) for a selection of even - even nuclei @xcite.,scaledwidth=80.0% ]    as the experimental data on nuclear deformation is quite sparse in this neutron - rich region , other ways of understanding the evolution of nuclear deformations have to be investigated . for example , one can use the excitation energy spectrum together with the vmi model , which is based on the harris parameters @xmath16 $ ] .",
    "the parameter @xmath15 can be related to the deformation of the nucleus and @xmath17 can be related to the amount of freezing of the internal structure , that is the rigidity . in this way it is possible to obtain a much richer set of data than when using only experimental deformations directly .",
    "recently , an experiment to study the yrast band in the mid - shell nuclei @xmath18 ( @xmath19 was carried out at the prisma and clara set - up at lnl , the results of which are shown in figure  [ fig : dy_syst ] .",
    "the vmi fits have been made according to the procedure in @xcite , with the inclusion of the data on @xmath20 @xcite and @xmath21 @xcite .",
    "the experimental data from @xcite is shown together with the harris parameters @xmath15 in figure  [ fig : mnsystematics ] .",
    "these new data points show an increase in @xmath15 , suggesting that the @xmath22 deformation maximum could be reasonably stable at least from dy to hf , @xmath23 . however , further investigations at lower @xmath12 and higher @xmath14 , as well as direct measurements of the deformation parameters , are important for a full understanding of the evolution of nuclear deformations .",
    "taking advantage of new detector technology , like agata @xcite , and the possibility to use a heavier beam , like @xmath24 , both the detection power and production cross - section of the experiment described in @xcite could be improved considerably .",
    "thus , it would be possible to extend the systematic studies of collectivity further into the neutron - rich region using multi - nucleon transfer reactions .",
    "the production cross - section of dysprosium isotopes for three different types of ion beams calculated using the ` grazing ` code @xcite are shown in figure  [ fig : grazing - dy ] .",

    "see @xcite for details.,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=40.0% ]    a valuable complement to the multi - nucleon transfer reaction measurements are the fragmentation reactions",
    ". using these it is possible to establish @xmath31 values to determine the electric quadrupole moments and the degree of triaxial deformation , and thus the evolution of quadrupole collectivity , for a range of neutron - rich rare - earth nuclei @xcite . by relativistic coulomb excitation",
