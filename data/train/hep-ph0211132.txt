    "our aims in this discussion are to summarize briefly on the main features of yfs / ceex exponentiation  @xcite in qed and to present examples of recent theoretical results  @xcite relevant for the lep / lc physics programs .    in the next section",
    ", we review the older eex exclusive realization and summarize the new ceex exclusive realization of the yfs  @xcite theory in qed . in this way",
    "we illustrate the latter s advantages over the former , which is also very successful .",
    "we also stress the key common aspects of our mc implementations of the two approaches to exponentiation , such as the exact treatment of phase space in both cases , the strict realization of the factorization theorem , etc . in sect .",
    "3 , we illustrate recent improvements in the @xmath1 mc realization of ceex for the @xmath8 channel . in sect .",
    "4 we illustrate recent exact results on the single hard bremsstrahlung in 2f processes which quantify the size of the missing sub - leading @xmath9l terms in the @xmath1 mc . sect .",
    "5 contains our summary .",
    "there are currently many successful applications  @xcite of the yfs theory of exponentiation for lep and lc physics : ( 1 ) , for @xmath10 , @xmath11 there are yfs1 ( 1987 - 1989 ) isr , yfs2@xmath12koralz ( 1989 - 1990 ) , isr , yfs3@xmath12koralz ( 1990 - 1998 ) , isr+fsr , and @xmath1  mc ( 98 - 02 ) isr+fsr+ifi with @xmath13 ; ( 2 ) , for @xmath14 for @xmath15 there are bhlumi 1.x , ( 1987 - 1990 ) , and bhlumi 2.x,4.x , ( 1990 - 1996 ) , with @xmath16 ; ( 3 ) , for @xmath14 for @xmath17 there is bhwide ( 1994 - 1998 ) , with @xmath18 at the z peak ( just off the z peak ) ; ( 4 ) , for @xmath19 , @xmath20 there is koralw ( 1994 - 2001 ) ; and , ( 5 ) , for @xmath19 , @xmath20 there is yfsww3 ( 1995 - 2001 ) , yfs exponentiation + leading pole approximation with @xmath21 at lep2 energies above the ww threshold .",
    "the typical mc realization we effect is in the form of `` matrix element @xmath22 exact phase space '' principle , as we illustrate in the following diagram :    in practice it means :    * the universal exact phase - space mc simulator is a separate module producing `` raw events '' ( with importance sampling ) . *",
    "the library of several types of sm / qed matrix elements which provides the `` model weight '' is another independent module ( the @xmath1mc example is shown ) . * tau decays and hadronization come afterwards of course .",
    "the main steps in yfs exponentiation are the reorganization of the perturbative complete series such that ir - finite @xmath23 components are isolated ( factorization theorem ) and the truncation of the ir - finite @xmath23s to finite with the attendant calculation of them from feynman diagrams recursively .",
    "we illustrate here the respective factorization for overlapping ir divergences for the 2@xmath24 case  @xmath25 and @xmath26 as they are shown in the following picture :    @xmath27 + @xmath28 + @xmath29 .",
    "+ note : @xmath30 and @xmath31 are used beyond their usual ( born and @xmath32 ) phase space .",
    "a kind of smooth `` extrapolation '' or `` projection '' is always necessary .",
    "we see that a recursive order - by - order calculation of the ir - finite @xmath23s to a given fixed is possible : specifically , + @xmath33 , + @xmath34 , + @xmath35 , @xmath36 , allow such a truncation .    in the classic eex / yfs",
    "schematically the @xmath37 s are truncated to , in the isr example . for @xmath38 , we have + @xmath39 with @xmath40 the real soft factors are @xmath41 + and the ir - finite building blocks are + @xmath42 , with @xmath43 = fermion hel .",
    ", @xmath44 = photon hel . , and + @xmath45 .",
    "+ everything is in terms of @xmath46 !",
    "the new ceex replaces old the eex , where both are derived from the yfs theory  @xcite : eex , exclusive exponentiation , is very close to the original yennie - frautschi - suura formulation ; ceex , coherent exclusive exponentiation , is an extension of the yfs theory .",
    "its coherence makes ceex friendly to quantum coherence among the feynman diagrams , so that we have the complete @xmath47 rather than the often incomplete @xmath48 .",
    "this means be get readily the proper treatment of narrow resonances , @xmath49  exchanges , @xmath50  channels , isr@xmath51fsr , angular ordering ,  etc .",
    "examples of the eex formulation are koralz / yfs2 , bhlumi , bhwide , yfsww , koralw and koralz ; the example of the ceex formulation is @xmath1mc .",
    "we illustrate ceex schematically with the example of isr for the process @xmath38 .",
    "we have + @xmath52 , + @xmath53,@xmath43=fermion helicities , + @xmath54 , + @xmath55 , +    @xmath56 + @xmath57 .",
    "the ir - finite building blocks are : + @xmath58 + @xmath59    everything is done in terms of @xmath60-amplitudes !",
    "+ distributions are @xmath61 by construction ! + in @xmath1mc the above is done up to for isr and fsr .",
    "the full scale ceex , r=1,2 , master formula for the polarized total cross section reads as follows : @xmath62^\\star\\nonumber\\\\   & \\sigma^l_{\\bar{\\lambda}_c \\lambda_c } \\sigma^m_{\\bar{\\lambda}_d \\lambda_d } \\hat{h}^l_c               \\hat{h}^m_c.\\nonumber\\\\   \\end{aligned}\\ ] ]      the precision tags of the @xmath1mc are determined by comparisons with our own semi - analytical and independent mc results and by comparison with the semi - analytical results of the program zfitter  @xcite . in fig .",
    "[ zfit ] we illustrate such comparisons , which lead to the @xmath1mc precision tag @xmath13 for example .",

    "it is a replacement for the older koralz program .",
    "this new mode of the @xmath1mc is useful for lep final data analysis and for the first steps toward the lc .",
    "we note the following properties and improvements due to this new @xmath1mc ceex treatment of the @xmath64 process : ( 1 ) , the systematic error is now estimated to be 1.3% for @xmath65 and 0.8% for @xmath66 and @xmath67 ; ( 2 ) , for observables with two observed photons we estimate the uncertainty to be about 5% ; ( 3 ) , these new improved results were obtained thanks to the inclusion of the non - photonic electroweak corrections of the zfitter package and due to newly constructed , exact , single and double photon emission amplitudes in the @xmath1  mc for the contribution with the @xmath68-channel @xmath69 exchange ; and , ( 4 ) , the virtual corrections for the @xmath69 exchange are at present introduced in an approximated form but the ceex exponentiation scheme is the same as in the original @xmath1  mc program .",
