    "obtaining a detailed understanding of a dissipation in small quantum systems coupled to a reservoir held in thermodynamic equilibrium poses a formidable challenge . with the increasing accuracy of experimental techniques in diverse fields such as condensed matter physics , quantum optics , cold atomic gases , physical chemistry , and quantum information science ,",
    "phenomenological approaches need to be complemented by a more microscopic view .",
    "one thus has to develop appropriate microscopic models for dissipation as well as the corresponding quantum many - body methods to solve those with sufficient precision .",
    "we here report on progress with respect to the second aspect .",
    "focusing on the commonly investigated spin - boson model ( sbm),@xcite we propose two complementary renormalization group ( rg ) based methods which allow controlled access to the relaxation dynamics of the ohmic sbm close to its coherent - to - incoherent transition@xcite : the real - time rg ( rtrg ) ( ref .  ) and the functional rg ( frg ) ( ref .  ) .",
    "we study the relaxation dynamics under the sbm hamiltonian out of an initially ( at time @xmath0 ) prepared product state of spin - up and the boson vacuum together with the time evolution after a quantum quench where one of the parameters of the sbm is changed abruptly ; we here exclusively consider temperature @xmath1 .",
    "the time dependence of the position of a classical damped harmonic oscillator constitutes a possible point of reference for the functional dependence of the spin expectation value @xmath2 on time @xmath3 in the sbm .",
    "an important intrinsic property of the sbm that is absent in the oscillator is the system s memory .",
    "non - markovian memory effects are a fundamental issue in dissipative quantum systems , in particular due to their relevance in quantum information theory .",
    "several ways have been proposed to characterize and measure to which degree the dynamics of an open quantum system shows non - markovian features , see e.g. ref .",
    "for a recent review . here , we define non - markovian memory by those effects which result from the energy dependence of the effective kernel in laplace space determining the time evolution of the local quantum system . using rtrg ,",
    "a generic analysis@xcite has shown that non - markovian dynamics results in additional exponentially decaying terms for the time evolution , which have unexpected oscillation frequencies and decay rates compared to the leading markovian terms , together with pre - exponential functions containing power laws and logarithmic functions in the long - time limit .",
    "these effects result from the nonanalytic energy dependence of the effective kernel , where the position of a branching point determines the exponential part , whereas the pre - exponential function follows from the scaling behavior around the branching point . in special cases ,",
    "like e.g. quantum critical points or reservoirs with specific nonanalytic density of states , it may even happen that non - markovian effects lead to a pure power law in the long - time limit without any exponentially decaying part , as it is e.g. the case for multi - channel kondo models.@xcite    non - markovian effects have already been reported for the ohmic sbm .",
    "its hamiltonian reads as @xmath4 where @xmath5 , @xmath6 , are the pauli matrices , and @xmath7 are bosonic ladder operators . a spin-@xmath8 with zeeman splitting @xmath9 and tunneling @xmath10 between the two states is coupled by @xmath11 to a reservoir of bosonic modes with dispersion @xmath12 . of interest is the computation of the spin expectation value @xmath13 primarily considering the initial condition @xmath14 .",
    "@xmath15 corresponds to the population imbalance of left and right double - well states when exploiting the analogy of the sbm to a particle in a double - well potential.@xcite the spin - boson coupling is characterized by a spectral density @xmath16 containing the microscopic details of the model.@xcite we concentrate on the extensively studied ohmic case when the spectral density is linear up to a cutoff @xmath17 , e.g. @xmath18 . in the special case without bias , @xmath19 , the standard result quoted for the spin expectation value @xmath15 is the one resulting from the noninteracting blip approximation ( niba ) , where @xmath15 decomposes into a coherent ( pole ) and incoherent ( branch cut ) contribution @xmath20 . in the long - time limit , @xmath21 ,",
    "the niba predicts @xcite @xmath22 here , @xmath23 and @xmath24 are the characteristic scales determining the exponential time dynamics of the coherent part @xmath25 , and @xmath26 is an effective tunneling rate .",
    "the incoherent part @xmath27 is a term resulting purely from non - markovian dynamcis , whereas the coherent part @xmath25 is also obtained in markov approximation but the precise values of @xmath28 , @xmath29 , and the prefactor are influenced by non - markovian contributions .",
    "for strong enough damping @xmath30 , the niba predicts correctly that the coherent term @xmath25 is absent .",
    "although the results and were originally predicted for all values of @xmath31 , controlled calculations for small @xmath31 and for @xmath31 close to @xmath8 have shown that this result can not be correct for all @xmath31 . for small @xmath31",
    "it has been shown recently that @xmath27 is also exponentially decaying with a rate @xmath32 ( refs .   and  ) and",
    "the @xmath33 correction to the exponent of the algebraically decaying function is absent @xcite .",
    "especially the latter requires a controlled analysis close to branching points of the effective kernel , such that all powers @xmath34^n$ ] are systematically taken into account .",
    "so far , this has only been achieved by the rtrg method , where a controlled renormalization group study is possible for the weak - coupling regime of small @xmath31 .",
    "for @xmath31 close to the coherent - to - incoherent transition at @xmath35 , which is the regime of interest in this work , a systematic perturbative analysis is also possible in the parameter @xmath36 .",
    "for small @xmath37 and for @xmath38 being the largest energy scale ( scaling limit ) the sbm can be mapped onto the interacting resonant level model ( irlm),@xcite which describes a quantum dot connected to a lead featuring fermionic degrees of freedom with a constant density of states of bandwidth @xmath39 .",
    "its hamiltonian reads @xmath40 where @xmath41 is the fermionic dot ladder operator , @xmath42 is an annihilation ( creation ) operator of a fermion in the lead with energy @xmath43 , and the density of states in the lead is @xmath44 for @xmath45 .",
    "normal ordering with respect to ( w.r.t . )",
    "the reservoir equilibrium distribution is denoted by @xmath46 .",
    "the irlm parameters are related to the ones of the sbm as @xmath47 and @xmath48 .",
    "our observable of interest @xmath15 corresponds to @xmath49 , with the expectation value of the dot level occupancy @xmath50 and the initial condition @xmath51 . throughout this work we mainly use the language of the irlm but switch to the sbm language whenever this is useful to describe the underlying physics .",
    "concerning the relaxation dynamics of @xmath15 for @xmath31 close to @xmath8 , is has already been shown by an improved niba calculation @xcite that the incoherent part @xmath27 has to be changed to @xmath52 \\frac{e^{-\\gamma_2^ * t}}{(t_k t)^{1+|g| } } \\,,\\ ] ] i.e. it is also exponentially decaying with a rate @xmath53 , the prefactor changes to @xmath54 for @xmath30 , and the exponent of the algebraically decaying function was predicted to change to @xmath55 for @xmath30 .",
    "however , a systematic analysis containing all powers @xmath56^n$ ] with @xmath36 is still missing , i.e. the corrections in @xmath57 to the exponent can not be trusted so far .",
    "the predictions of improved niba were recently confirmed in a letter - style paper using rtrg and frg for the irlm.@xcite in addition , it was shown that the incoherent part @xmath27 has the form eq .   for _ exponentially large times _",
    "@xmath58 only and an analytical formula was proposed valid for all times @xmath59 .",
    "furthermore , an improved expression for the rate @xmath60 was presented , and it was shown that the prefactor of the coherent part @xmath25 has to be changed to @xmath61.@xcite one purpose of this paper is to present more details of the results from rtrg and frg for the relaxation dynamics close to the coherent - to - incoherent transition at @xmath35 .    from this discussion , it is obvious that the relaxation dynamics of the unbiased , ohmic sbm differs from the niba prediction for @xmath62 and for @xmath63 and it remains to be seen if similar deficits prevail for other @xmath31 .",
    "the rtrg and frg methods are perturbative renormalization group methods for nonequilibrium systems , and therefore their applicability range for a controlled analysis of the time evolution is restricted to the weak - coupling regime . however , in contrast to bare perturbation theory or the self - consistent born approximation , as e.g. applied to the ohmic spin - boson model at small @xmath31,@xcite the rtrg and frg are unique in the sense that they can select systematically all logarithmically diverging terms in the band width @xmath38 in all orders of perturbation theory , such that renormalized parameters and exponents of power laws for the time evolution can be determined .",
    "other numerical studies for the sbm using a variety of different methods , either being formally exact or selecting certain subclasses of processes in all orders of perturbation theory , have found exponential dependence and substantiated the coherent - to - incoherent crossover but pre - exponential functions were so far not identified unambiguously.@xcite    for @xmath31 close to @xmath8 , one of the important characteristics to compare is the transition between coherent and incoherent relaxation . in accordance with the standard terminology in the field of dissipative quantum mechanics we speak of incoherent dynamics if @xmath15 is a monotonically decaying function while we refer to coherent behavior if @xmath15 is nonmonotonic . to understand the effect of the memory on this transition",
    ", we study the system s dynamics in two cases : ( 1 ) when it relaxes with time - independent hamiltonian out of a nonequilibrium product state , and its dynamics is affected by the memory collected over time , and ( 2 ) when in addition at time @xmath64 some of the hamiltonian s parameters are changed abruptly so that the behavior of the system at @xmath65 is influenced by the interplay of the dynamics in the new regime and the memory collected before @xmath64 .",
    "the first case we name the _ relaxation protocol _ , implying that the small system and the bath held in thermodynamic equilibrium were decoupled initially [ i.e. , @xmath66 or @xmath67 , @xmath68 for the sbm hamiltonian eq .",
    "] , and at the time @xmath0 the hamiltonian in eq",
    ".   with non - zero @xmath69 and @xmath70 comes into effect .",
    "the _ quench protocols _ in addition to the steps of the relaxation protocol imply the sudden change of the hamiltonian parameters @xmath9 , @xmath69 , and/or @xmath70 at time @xmath71 [ in the language of the sbm the parameters @xmath9 , @xmath72 , and/or @xmath31 are quenched ; see eq .  ] .",
    "particularly interesting is the quench that invokes a transition between the coherent and incoherent regimes of the dynamics . in this case",
    "the difference in the time dependencies is particularly clear .",
    "the quench dynamics constitutes the main focus of our work .",
    "we investigate quenches of the system - bath coupling as well as those of the zeeman splitting of the up and down spin .",
    "in addition we leave the framework of the sbm and identify a part of the sbm physics in a bias voltage driven irlm with two leads . as the standard relaxation dynamics forms the basis for the understanding of the quench ones a detailed study of the former",
    "is presented first . in particular , we note that an understanding of the crossover between coherent and incoherent dynamics requires the knowledge of the time dynamics on intermediate time scales , which is accessible by our methods , numerically as well as analytically .",
    "parts of our results for the quench dynamics were earlier published in a letter - style publication.@xcite    at @xmath73 , that is @xmath68 , the fermionic quantum dot model becomes noninteracting and can be solved exactly ( toulouse limit ) . for finite interactions we use the rtrg and frg method .",
    "the rtrg was specifically developed as an analytical tool to study the nonequilibrium physics of small interacting quantum systems coupled to noninteracting reservoirs in the weak coupling limit.@xcite in particular , the method has the advantage that it can address each individual term contributing to the time evolution and it can provide analytical insight as to what the generic form of the time evolution looks like.@xcite the method has already been applied to the stationary properties of the irlm and to the time evolution for @xmath74.@xcite in this paper , we will discuss the solution of the rg equations and the time dynamics for the more difficult resonant case @xmath19 .",
    "moreover , we will generalize the rtrg method to the case of arbitrary time - dependent hamiltonians and will discuss in detail the quench dynamics for an abrupt change of some system parameter . the second method applied in this paper",
    "is the frg , which is a very flexible rg method and can be used for open as well as closed quantum many - body systems of different dimensionality.@xcite the practical implementation for the time evolution in the model at hand has been developed in refs .  .",
    "we discuss in detail how the combined use of the two methods provides controlled analytical as well as numerical access to the standard relaxation and the quench dynamics of the irlm for small @xmath75 that is close to the toulouse point .",
    "the time evolution of the sbm in other parameter regimes and for other nonequilibrium setups was investigated in refs .   using a variety of methods .",
    "the paper is structured as follows . in the next section",

    "[ sec : conclu ] .",
    "the appendixes contain technical details on the generalization of the rtrg method to time - dependent hamiltonians and quantum quenches together with the flow equations and their solutions for the irlm .",
    "the main goal of the rtrg method is to compute the reduced density matrix of a small interacting quantum system coupled to several reservoirs by integrating out the degrees of freedom of the noninteracting bath . from this",
    ", the observables of interest can be extracted .",
    "the reservoirs are initially decoupled from the interacting system and are held in thermodynamic equilibrium .",
    "wick s theorem , which is applicable for the ladder operators of the bath , allows us to write a diagrammatic series for an effective liouvillian which determines the time evolution of the reduced density matrix of the local quantum system.@xcite for the sbm ( ref .  ) at small @xmath31 and the irlm@xcite at small @xmath75 , that is the sbm for @xmath31 close to @xmath76 , the perturbative series contains logarithmic divergencies , which can be regularized either by cutting off the matsubara frequencies characterizing the poles of the bose / fermi - functions of the reservoirs@xcite or by using the laplace variable @xmath77 as a flow parameter .",
    "the latter is exploited in the recently developed e - rtrg method.@xcite in both cases one obtains rg flow equations , the solution of which gives the effective liouvillian .",
    "here in the main text we qualitatively summarize the ideas of the rtrg method and its extension to time - dependent hamiltonians and quenches ; for technical details and the precise diagrammatic rules we refer the interested reader to appendices  [ sec : app : diagrams ] and [ sec : app : quench_dynamics ] .",
    "the time dependence of the reduced density matrix @xmath78 of the local quantum system is determined by the von neumann equation .",
    "due to the coupling to the bath , the system acquires a memory which is stored in the form of excitations in the leads .",
    "this results in a time - dependent effective liouvillian @xmath79 , defined for times @xmath80 , which acts in liouvillian space of the local system and determines the dynamics of the reduced density matrix via the effective von neumann equation @xmath81 where the coupling of the system to the bath at time @xmath82 is implied ( later on we will set @xmath83 for convenience ) .",
    "the effective liouvillian can be decomposed as @xmath84 where @xmath85 is the bare liouvillian of the isolated local quantum system and @xmath86 is the dissipative part of the kernel emerging from the coupling to the reservoirs .",
    "defining for @xmath80 a propagator @xmath87 relating the reduced density matrix at time @xmath3 to the one at @xmath88 where system and bath are assumed to be decoupled , we can write the solution of the kinetic equation formally as @xmath89 where the relation between @xmath87 and @xmath79 is given by @xmath90 here , all functions depending on two time arguments are retarded ones , i.e. , are defined as zero for negative time differences .",
    "the last equation expresses the physical property that @xmath91 contains the sum of all correlated processes between @xmath88 and @xmath3 .",
    "the rules for the classification of all these processes by a diagrammatic expansion in the system - bath coupling are provided in appendix  [ sec : app : diagrams ] .    for a time - independent hamiltonian ,",
    "the effective liouvillian is a function of the time difference only .",
    "the resulting von neumann equation @xmath92 can be formally solved by means of a half - sided fourier transform ( or laplace transform with the rotated laplace variable @xmath93 ) @xmath94 where @xmath95 is the propagator containing the effective liouvillian in laplace representation .",

    "thus , the laplace integral transforms into an integral over the contour @xmath98 which goes around the nonanalyticities of the propagator in the lower half - plane . the general structure of those has been investigated in refs .  .",
    "in short , the real and imaginary parts of the pole positions @xmath99 determine the oscillation frequencies @xmath100 and decay rates @xmath101 of an exponential decay .",
    "poles with a finite real part occur in pairs @xmath102 .",
    "one pole is always located at @xmath103 corresponding to the stationary state @xmath104 .",
    "additionally , branch cuts occur from the nonanalytic function @xmath105 , which contains typically logarithms or power laws arising from logarithmic divergencies in the perturbative series . for the time evolution",

    "the non - markovian contribution to the dynamics is encrypted in the @xmath77 dependence of the effective liouvillian @xmath105 .",
    "@xmath105 is computed by means of the rtrg approach.@xcite as proposed in ref .  , it is convenient to decompose the liouvillian as @xmath111 where @xmath112 and @xmath113 are slowly varying logarithmic functions .",
    "the idea of the e - rtrg method,@xcite where the laplace variable @xmath77 is used as the flow parameter , is to set up equations for the derivatives @xmath114 and @xmath115 , and to resum the series on the right - hand side ( r.h.s . ) of the differential equation in terms of effective propagators and effective vertices .",
    "closing the set of differential equations by deriving corresponding differential equations for the effective vertices , one obtains universal rg equations in the infinite band - width limit @xmath116 which are free of logarithmic divergencies .",
    "provided that the effective vertices stay small ( the so - called weak - coupling limit ) , the rg equations can be solved perturbatively in the renormalized couplings along an arbitrary path in the complex plane , providing analytical access to an individual study of all singularities and branch cuts in the lower half of the complex plane .",

    "quench dynamics in open quantum systems we note that the rtrg and frg methods are quite flexible tools to discuss various models , physical quantities and initial setups . whereas the rtrg requires a weak system - bath coupling , the frg needs weak local interactions in the quantum system . in this respect",
    "the two methods are complementary and a huge parameter regime can be covered . aside from the local density matrix , other physical observables such as the particle and heat current for biased situations , spectral densities , and explicitly time - dependent hamiltonians can be treated .",

    "correlations are built up by the real - time dynamics such that , in the limit @xmath559 , all equilibrium density matrices containing arbitrary local interactions and system - bath correlations can be used as initial condition .",
    "furthermore , by using sequences of different quenches at different times , together with the possibility to choose a finite value for @xmath560 , many more initial conditions even in nonequilibrium setups can be studied .",
    "an interesting aspect of our approach is the possibility to investigate non - markovian dynamics of open quantum systems and to analyze the relation to concepts of quantum non - markovianity discussed within information theoretic approaches.@xcite several measures have been proposed to characterize the degree to which the dynamics of a given system is non - markovian . for weak - coupling models our methods provide controlled access to the reduced density matrix ,",
    "that is all diagonal and nondiagonal matrix elements , from which the proposed measures of non  markovianity can be determined .",
    "however , for the specific example of the ohmic sbm close to the coherent - to - incoherent transition ( at @xmath35 ) , the coupling constant @xmath31 is of order 1 and we rely on the mapping to the irlm , where a weak - coupling expansion in the parameter @xmath36 is possible . as a consequence , we were only able to discuss the spin expectation value of the sbm in the @xmath312 direction , since this observable can be directly related to the local occupation probability of the irlm .",
    "in contrast , the spin expectation values in the @xmath561 or @xmath562 directions can not be related to the off - diagonal elements of the local density matrix of the irlm but is a rather complicated nonlinear observable involving reservoir degrees of freedom .",
