    "bringing a superconductor ( sc ) and a ferromagnetic ( fm ) material in close proximity to each other results in drastic changes for the spin - singlet cooper pairs . while the pauli principle requires the spins to orient parallel in the fm region , the spin - singlet cooper pair electrons tend to align antiparallel in the sc region .",
    "this leads to the following consequences : i ) different fermi velocities in the spin - up and spin - down channel of the electrons due to the exchange field lead to a centre of mass modulation and an oscillating behaviour of the superconducting correlations within the fm region  @xcite , namely the fflo oscillations  @xcite .",
    "unequal - spin spin - triplet correlations ( @xmath1 ) are also generated .",
    "both of these correlations are oscillating and suppressed in the fm region , and are essentially short - range .",

    "et al . _",
    "@xcite it should also be possible to induce equal - spin spin - triplet cooper pairs which are compatible with and unaffected by the fm exchange field , thus leading to much larger penetration depths .",
    "this phenomenon requires spin - flip processes at the interface and is called the long - range proximity effect .",
    "since this first theoretical prediction equal - spin spin - triplet pairing correlations have attracted a lot of attention and are reviewed by buzdin  @xcite , bergeret _ et al . _",

    "several multilayer setups have been suggested experimentally and theoretically to shed some light on the specific interface properties necessary to generate equal - spin spin - triplet pairing correlations within such structures .",
    "these setups typically involve noncollinear magnetic structures within the interface region as provided by different fm layers  @xcite , helical ( or conical ) magnetic layers  @xcite , or through specific interface potentials  @xcite",
    ". moreover , also the effects of bloch  @xcite and nel  @xcite domain walls , as well as interfacial spin - orbit coupling  @xcite as source for generating equal - spin spin - triplet pairing correlations have been investigated .    on the theoretical side ,",
    "equal - spin spin - triplet pairing correlations have been investigated using green s function techniques based on solutions of the usadel equations  @xcite , and self - consistent solutions of the bogoliubov@xmath0de gennes ( bdg ) equations  @xcite .",
    "while the green s function techniques allow for an easier inclusion of scattering effects describing a shorter electron mean free path in the diffusive limit , these effects can in principle be incorporated into the bdg equations as well via additional impurity scattering potentials .",
    "however , in the present work we are solely concerned with the special case of odd - frequency triplet pairing correlations , which are not affected by nonmagnetic impurities  @xcite .",
    "the inclusion of additional impurity scattering potentials would require further investigations .",
    "the main aim of the paper is to assess the effectiveness of bloch and nel domain walls in comparison to conical magnetic layers to generate long - range proximity effects .",
    "this is motivated by the potential use of magnetic domain walls incorporated in experimental heterostructures to allow for a switching of the generated long - range spin - triplet josephson current .",
    "based on an established heterostructure setup successfully used in previous experimental and theoretical works we introduce bloch and nel domain walls in the interface regions and investigate its suitability to generate equal - spin spin - triplet pairing correlations .",
    "these results will be compared to the corresponding results with interface regions containing conical magnetic layers of varying thicknesses .",

    "provides a summary and an outlook .",
    "the results presented in this paper are obtained by means of the microscopic bdg equations , which have been solved self - consistently in the clean limit . in the most general spin - dependent case and incorporating an expression for arbitrary exchange fields * h * needed later to describe the influence of bloch and nel domain walls , the bdg equations read  @xcite @xmath4 where @xmath5 , @xmath6 , and @xmath7 denote eigenvalues , and quasiparticle and quasihole amplitudes for spin @xmath8 , respectively .",

    "one immediately notices that spin magnetisation only occurs in the respective interface regions and that no magnetisation leaks into the sc regions of the heterostructures .",
    "the overall rise in spin magnetisation is stronger for the bloch domain walls and saturates earlier than in the conical magnetic layers .",
    "the latter also show stronger oscillations depending on the thickness @xmath30 compared to the bloch domain wall thickness @xmath2 .",

    "it seems that the orientation of the noncollinear magnetic moments with respect to the interface plane does not influence the induced unequal - spin spin - triplet pairing correlations .",
    "this changes drastically when looking at the equal - spin spin - triplet pairing correlations where we find no contribution stemming from heterostructures containing nel domain walls ( within the particular setup investigated in the present work ) .",

    "hence does not contribute towards equal - spin spin - triplet pairing correlations .",
    "focusing now at the properties of @xmath63 shown in , one notices again that the contributions from heterostructures containing bloch @xmath2 ( middle panels ) and nel @xmath3 domain walls ( lower panels ) are again indistinguishable .",
    "the spin magnetisation is only present in the interface regions and does not leak into the sc regions of the heterostructures .",

    "it has been shown that for the unequal - spin spin - triplet pairing correlations @xmath66 both bloch and nel domain walls exceed the efficiency provided by conical magnetic layers at the interface .",
    "for the equal - spin spin - triplet pairing correlations @xmath67 only the bloch domain walls show considerable improvement over the conical magnetic layer setup , whereas the specific orientation of the nel domain wall ( noncollinear magnetic moments perpendicular to the interface plane ) prevented the occurrence of equal - spin spin - triplet pairing correlations in that case .",
    "different orientations of nel domain walls with respect to the interface plane deserve further investigations .",
