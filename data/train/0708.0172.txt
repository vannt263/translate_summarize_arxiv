    "the study of nucleon transition form factors has long been recognized as one of the essential steps towards a deep understanding of strong interaction .",
    "the transition process between nucleon and @xmath0(1232 ) resonance , the lowest baryon excitation , is important to investigate the internal quark and gluon structure of the nucleon and its resonance .",
    "when hadronic systems are described in terms of quarks and gluons , it is part of nature that the characteristic momenta are of the same order or even very much larger than that of the masses of the particles involved .",
    "thus , a relativistic treatment is one of the essential ingredients for a successful model description . the light - front constituent quark model ( lfqm ) within the framework of light - front  ( lf ) dynamics  @xcite appears to be a useful phenomenological tool which keeps the relativistic effect into account while it incorporates some basic spin - flavor structure of the hadron .    in the formalism of lfqm",
    ", the good  (  + \" ) component of current matrix elements for the analysis of the hadron form factors can be divided into two parts .",
    "one is the valence part , in which the  + \" current matrix elements are diagonal in the fock state expansion , that can be expressed in terms of the convolutions of lf wavefunctions .",
    "the other is the nonvalence part , in which the  + \" components are only related to the off - diagonal elements in the fock state expansion . in the @xmath4 limit , where @xmath5 is the longitudinal component of the momentum transfer @xmath6 ( @xmath7 , @xmath8 ) , it was usually taken for granted that the nonvalence part vanishes and thus one only needs to take into account the valence part or the diagonal elements in the fock state expansion .",
    "this is true in the cases when the hadrons involved are spin-0 bosons and spin-1/2 fermions as in most previous investigations .",
    "the  + \" component of matrix elements is therefore denoted as  good \" component .",
    "however , in recent analyses of spin-1 form factors  @xcite , it has been shown that the nonvalence part has non - vanishing contribution in the @xmath4 limit , which is called _",
    "zero mode_. without the zero mode contribution , the angular condition  @xcite , which assures that different ways of extracting the form factors produce the same physical results , would be violated .    in this paper",
    "we analyze the zero mode contribution to the transition form factors in the @xmath9-@xmath0 transition process . as our purpose is for a recovery of full covariance in the lfqm formalism by including the zero - mode contribution in the @xmath9-@xmath0 process but not to present a realistic model which can fit the available data , we adopt a simple but exactly solvable quark - spectator - diquark model for the sake of simplicity and clarification .",
    "we specify the kinematics in drell - yan - west  ( dyw ) frame with the lf gauge ( @xmath10 , which has been used in the lfqm analysis .",
    "to investigate the zero mode contribution in a clear way , we make the taxonomical decomposition of the full current matrix elements into valence and nonvalence contributions . performing calculation in the lf helicity basis",
    "we find that indeed the good component of the currents has non - vanishing zero mode contribution in this model .",
    "in particular , there is zero mode contribution in the lf helicity amplitudes @xmath11 and @xmath3 , where @xmath12 and @xmath13 are the initial and final helicities , respectively . when the number of current matrix elements gets larger than the number of physical form factors , the conditions that the current matrix elements must satisfy are essential to test the underlying theoretical model for the hadrons .",
    "the analysis of @xmath9-@xmath0 transition process requires in general eight light - front helicity amplitudes although there are only three physical form factors .",
    "thus , there must be five conditions for the helicity amplitudes . using the light - front parity relation",
    ", one can reduce the number of helicity amplitudes down to four .",
    "one more relation among the remaining four helicity amplitudes comes from the conservation of angular momentum and this relation is called _",
    "angular condition_. consequently , only three helicity amplitudes are independent of each other as it should be because there are only three physical form factors involved in the @xmath9-@xmath0 transition process .",
    "however , there are several different prescriptions  @xcite in choosing independent current matrix elements to extract the three physical form factors .",
    "we take four prescriptions as examples , and show that different types of helicity combinations produce the same results and the angular condition is satisfied if the zero mode contribution is included in each description .",
    "we do this taking the baryon as a system of quark and diquark .",
    "note that there are different ways of treating the diquarks in the literature .",
    "one way is called the quark - spectator - diquark model in which one would re - organize the spectators by an effective diquark to take into account the flavor - spin structure of the whole spectator when any of the quark is struck . in this framework , there is no struck diquark and one should have an additional factor of 3 to account for that there are three valence quarks in the baryon .",
    "another way is called the quark - diquark model in which the diquarks are treated as independent particles and one should also take into account the contribution when diquarks are struck .",
    "however , the zero - mode issue is completely independent from whether the model is  spectator diquark \" or  struck diquark \" . that is to say that the lorentz covariance must work independently for each contribution . in this work ,",
    "we thus compute only one part of the full contribution neglecting the flavor structure and show that the covariance is nevertheless recovered on its own with the inclusion of the zero - mode contribution .",
    "the struck diquark contribution would independently work essentially in the same way .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "[ sec.2 ] , we present the lorentz - invariant transition form factors and angular conditions in lf helicity basis .",
    "the four prescriptions used in extracting the physical form factors are also briefly discussed . in section  [ sec.3 ] ,",
