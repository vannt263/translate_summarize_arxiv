    "abundance gradients in galactic discs are an important constraint on the star formation and interstellar medium history and the possible secular evolution of stars post - formation in those discs . in the milky way galaxy",

    "much effort to search for local abundance variations , and abundance variations with azimuth , show little if any detectable variation in young systems @xcite , limiting the importance of radial gas flows .    quantifying the abundance distribution functions and their radial and vertical gradients in both",
    "the thin and thick discs can be achieved using stellar abundances , especially those from major surveys such as radial velocity experiment ( rave , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "several recent analyses of rave data have studied the metallicity and kinematics of the galactic discs distribution functions from rave data @xcite .",
    "even more fundamental is the variation of the abundance gradient with time .",
    "some information is available , especially from open star clusters and field stars .",
    "the evidence here suggests the gradient flattens beyond about 12 kpc galactocentric radius @xcite , as is seen in other spiral galaxies @xcite . at very outer",
    "radii the situation may be more complex .",
    "the observational situation however can be improved .",
    "extant data suggest vertical metallicity gradients in the @xmath5/dz<-0.2 $ ] dex kpc@xmath2 range for relatively small distances from the galactic plane , i.e. @xmath6 kpc @xcite . for intermediate @xmath7 distances , where the thick disc is dominant ,",
    "the vertical metallicity gradient is low , @xmath1/dz=-0.07 $ ] dex kpc@xmath2 and the radial gradient is only marginal , @xmath8/dz\\leq0 $ ] dex kpc@xmath2 @xcite .",
    "there is some evidence that metallicity gradients for relatively short vertical distances , @xmath9 kpc , show systematic fluctuations with galactic longitude , similar to those of the thick - disc scaleheight , which may be interpreted as a common flare effect of the disc @xcite .",
    "these vertical gradients are perhaps a convolution of a time - dependent abundance and the well - established stellar age - velocity dispersion relation .",
    "alternatively , they may be more consistent with two independent , rather narrow metallicity distributions , one thin disc , one thick disc , with the apparent gradient being simply a reflection of the two different scale heights @xcite .",
    "in this study we analyse stellar abundance gradients from rave data , using colour bins as a proxy for mean age , to test for time - dependent effects .",
    "rave is a multi - fibre spectroscopic astronomical survey of stars in the milky way , which covers just over half of the southern hemisphere , using the 1.2 m uk schmidt telescope of the australian astronomical observatory ( aao ) .",
    "rave s primary aim is to derive the radial velocity of stars from the observed spectra for solar neighbourhood stars .",
    "additional information is also derived , such as photometric parallax and stellar atmospheric parameters , i.e. effective temperature , surface gravity , metallicity and elemental abundance data .",
    "this information is important in calculating metallicity gradients , which provides data about the formation and evolution of the galaxy .",
    "as the data were obtained from solar neighbourhood stars , we have limitations to distance and range of metallicity . however , the metallicity measurements are of high internal accuracy which is an advantage for our work",
    ". a radial metallicity gradient of -0.04 dex kpc@xmath2 , based on calibrated metallicities from the rave dr2 data has already appeared in the literature @xcite .",
    "however , this metallicity gradient covers all spectral types , and thus a wide age range , which is a disadvantage for a sample of stars with distance and metallicity range restrictions .",
    "hence , in this study we will use only the data for the f and g spectral type stars .",
    "we test for different metallicity gradients for different spectral types .",
    "the structure of this paper is : data selection is described in section 2 ; calculated space velocities and orbits of star samples and population analysis are described in sections 3 and 4 , respectively .",
    "results are given in section 5 and a summary and conclusion are presented in section 6 .",
    "the data were selected from the third data release of rave ( dr3 - * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "rave dr3 reports 83072 radial velocity measurements for stars with @xmath10 .",
    "this release also provides stellar atmospheric parameters for 41672 spectra representing 39833 individual stars @xcite .",
    "the accuracy of the radial velocities is high , marginally improved with dr3 : the distribution of internal errors in the radial velocities has a mode of 0.8 km s@xmath2 and a median of 1.2 km s@xmath2 , while 95 per cent of the sample has an internal error smaller than 5 km s@xmath2 .",
    "the uncertainties for the stellar atmospheric parameters are : 250 k for effective temperature @xmath11 , 0.43 dex for surface gravity @xmath0 and 0.2 dex for @xmath12 $ ] .",
    "while rave supports a variety of chemical abundance scales , we use here just the public dr3 values .",
    "since anticipated gradients are small , this provides a well - defined set of parameters for analysis .",
    "a surface gravity constraint @xmath13 was applied to the 83072 star sample to obtain a homogeneous dwarf - star subsample with accurate data .",
    "distances of the subsample stars were obtained using the absolute magnitude calibration of @xcite , whereas the reddening values were obtained iteratively , following published methodology ( for more detailed information regarding the iterations see * ? ? ? * and the references therein ) .",
    "our aim here is to take advantage of rave s focus on high galactic latitude to isolate , statistically , samples dominated by thin disc and by thick disc stars .",
    "thus , after dereddening , stars were split into f and g spectral type subsamples using @xcite s criteria , i.e. @xmath14 and @xmath15 leaving us with 17768 stars . out of these 17768 stars",
    "10661 are f- and 7107 are g - type dwarfs , while the sample median distances are 326 and 272 pc , respectively .",
    "we combined the distances estimated in section 2 with rave kinematics and the available proper motions , applying the ( standard ) algorithms and the transformation matrices of @xcite to obtain their galactic space velocity components ( @xmath16 , @xmath17 , @xmath18 ) . in the calculations epoch j2000",
    "was adopted as described in the international celestial reference system ( icrs ) of the _ hipparcos _ and _ tycho-2 _ catalogues @xcite .",
    "the transformation matrices use the notation of a right handed system .",
    "hence , @xmath16 , @xmath17 and @xmath18 are the components of a velocity vector of a star with respect to the sun , where @xmath16 is positive towards the galactic centre ( @xmath19 , @xmath20 ) , @xmath17 is positive in the direction of galactic rotation ( @xmath21 , @xmath20 ) and @xmath18 is positive towards the north galactic pole ( @xmath22 ) .    correction for differential galactic rotation is necessary for accurate determination of @xmath16 , @xmath17 and @xmath18 velocity components .",
    "the effect is proportional to the projection of the distance to the stars onto the galactic plane , i.e. the @xmath18 velocity component is not affected by galactic differential rotation @xcite .",
    "we applied the procedure of @xcite to the distribution of the sample stars and estimated the first order galactic differential rotation corrections for @xmath16 and @xmath17 velocity components of the sample stars .",
    "the range of these corrections is @xmath23 and @xmath24 km s@xmath2 for @xmath16 and @xmath17 , respectively .",
    "as expected , @xmath16 is affected more than the @xmath17 component . also",
    ", the high values for the @xmath16 component show that corrections for differential galactic rotation can not be ignored .",
    "the uncertainty of the space velocity components @xmath25 , @xmath26 and @xmath27 were computed by propagating the uncertainties of the proper motions , distances and radial velocities , again using a ( standard ) algorithm by @xcite .",
    "then , the error for the total space motion of a star follows from the equation :    @xmath28    the median and standard deviation for space velocity errors are s@xmath29 km s@xmath2 and @xmath30 km s@xmath2 , respectively .",
    "we now remove the most discrepant data from the analysis , knowing that outliers in a survey such as this will preferentially include stars which are systematically mis - analysed binaries , etc .",
    "astrophysical parameters for such stars are also likely to be relatively unreliable .",
    "thus , we omit stars with errors that deviate by more than the sum of the standard error and the standard deviation , i.e. @xmath3125 km s@xmath2 .",
    "this removes 760 stars , @xmath324.3 per cent of the sample .",
    "thus , our sample was reduced to 17008 stars , those with more robust space velocity components . after applying this constraint ,",
    "the median values and the standard deviations for the velocity components were reduced to ( @xmath33 , v@xmath33 , w@xmath33)=(@xmath34 , @xmath35 , @xmath36 ) km s@xmath2 .    to complement the chemical abundance data , accurate kinematic data have been obtained and used to calculate individual galactic orbital parameters for all stars . in order to calculate those parameters we used standard gravitational potentials",
    "well - described in the literature @xcite to estimate orbital elements of each of the sample stars .",
    "the orbital elements for a star used in our work are the mean of the corresponding orbital elements calculated over 15 orbital periods of that specific star .",
    "the orbital integration typically corresponds to 3 gyr , and is sufficient to evaluate the orbital elements of solar neighbourhood stars , most of which have orbital periods below 250 myr .",
    "solar neighbourhood velocity space includes well - established substructures that resemble classic moving groups or stellar streams @xcite . @xcite and @xcite",
    "show that , although these streams include clusters , after which they are named , and evaporated remnants from these clusters , the majority of stars in these streams are not coeval but include stars of different ages , not necessarily born in the same place nor at the same time .",
    "they argue these streams are dynamical ( resonant ) in origin , probably related to dynamical perturbations by transient spiral waves @xcite , which radially migrate stars to specific regions of the @xmath37-plane .",
    "stars in a dynamical stream just share a common velocity vector at this particular epoch .",
    "these authors further point out the obvious and important point that dynamical streams are kinematically young and so integrating backwards in a smooth stationary axisymmetric potential the orbits of the stars belonging to these streams is non - physical .",
    "does this fundamentally invalidate our calculations ?",
    "@xcite assigned probabilities for each star in their sample to belong to different kinematic groups .",
    "they found that stars not belonging to dynamical streams ( young giants and the smooth background ) make up the majority ( 70 per cent ) of their sample .",
    "@xcite s fig .",
    "10 illustrates that the majority of @xcite s stars are within @xmath38 pc of the galactic plane , with the distribution centred on the galactic plane .",
    "our rave sample of f - g dwarfs are at similar line - of - sight distances from the sun as the @xcite s k - m giants ( 200 - 400 pc ) . however , @xcite s fig .",
    "15 shows that rave stars are selected to avoid the galactic plane ( @xmath39 ) .",
    "this means our rave sample will include stars further from the galactic plane than the @xcite sample .",
    "dynamical perturbations by transient spiral waves are strongest closest to the galactic plane so there will be fewer dynamical stream stars in our rave sample . while we could in principle assign our stars to different kinematic groups , compared to @xcite s , it is probable that our sample has more than the local 70 per cent of stars whose orbital parameters can adequately be determined from the static milky way disc potential and not influenced by transient spiral waves .",
    "@xcite s space velocities are also much more accurate than our rave values , so considering all factors , we have not attempted to remove dynamical stream stars from our sample .",
    "contamination is unlikely to affect our statistical results .    to determine a possible orbit , we first perform test - particle integration in a milky way potential which consists of a logarithmic halo of the form @xmath40 with @xmath41 km s@xmath2 and @xmath42 kpc .",
    "the disc is represented by a miyamoto - nagai potential : @xmath43 with @xmath44 , @xmath45 kpc and @xmath46 kpc .",
    "finally , the bulge is modelled as a hernquist potential @xmath47 using @xmath48 and @xmath49 kpc .",
    "the superposition of these components gives quite a good representation of the milky way .",
    "the circular speed at the solar radius is @xmath50 km s@xmath2 .",
    "@xmath51 years is the orbital period of the lsr and @xmath52 km s@xmath2 denotes the circular rotational velocity at the solar galactocentric distance , @xmath53 kpc .    for our analysis of gradients , we are interested in the mean radial galactocentric distance ( @xmath54 ) as a function of the stellar population and the orbital shape .",
    "@xcite has analysed the radial orbital eccentricities of a rave sample of thick disc stars , to test thick disc formation models . here",
    "we focus on possible local gradients , so instead consider the _ vertical _ orbital eccentricity , @xmath55 .",

    "due to @xmath7-excursions @xmath56 and @xmath57 can vary , however this variation is not more than 5 per cent .",
    "the procedure of @xcite was used to separate sample stars into different populations .",
    "this kinematic methodology assumes that galactic space velocities for the thin disc ( @xmath60 ) , thick disc ( @xmath61 ) , and stellar halo ( @xmath62 ) with respect to the lsr have gaussian distributions as follows :    @xmath63    where @xmath64 normalizes the expression . for consistency with other analyses",
    "@xmath65 , @xmath66 and @xmath67 were adopted as the characteristic velocity dispersions : 35 , 20 and 16 km s@xmath2 for thin disc ( @xmath60 ) ; 67 , 38 and 35 km s@xmath2 for thick disc ( @xmath61 ) ; 160 , 90 and 90 km s@xmath2 for halo ( @xmath62 ) , respectively @xcite .",

    "the metallicity results match if a similar analysis method is used .",
    "the results of the analysis using an independent @xmath82 procedure @xcite yield metallicities which are entirely consistent with the rave pipeline results , i.e. mean offset of @xmath83 dex and a standard deviation of @xmath84 dex .",

    "one can see the following trends in a comparison of metallicities derived by other methods and the rave pipeline : i ) the difference between rave and reference metallicity increases with an increased @xmath85-enhancement , in the sense that rave values become too metal poor .",

    "10271 stars of this sample are f - type stars , whereas 6737 of them are g - type stars . for each star we calculated distances , total space motions , and integrated the stellar orbit in a galactic potential to derive both mean galactocentric distance and stellar orbital shape .",
    "we used the calibrated rave dr3 metallicities and these mean radial distances to investigate the presence of a radial metallicity gradient , dividing the sample into a variety of subsamples .",
    "these subsamples were defined using probabilistic population assignment , considering in turn space motions and stellar galactic orbital properties - what we term `` kinematic '' and `` dynamic '' methods .",
    "kinematic properties allowed stars to be separated into four populations , i.e. high probability thin disc stars , low probability thin disc stars , low probability thick disc stars and high probability thick disc stars , although only the high probability thin disc category retained sufficiently large sample size for more detailed consideration . in the dynamically - defined sample , stars were separated into three subsamples according to their vertical orbital eccentricity , i.e. @xmath96 , @xmath97 and @xmath98 .    in all cases ,",

    "the chemical evolution model of @xcite was tuned to provide an excellent fit to this gradient . in the model",
    "the gradient is caused by radial migration of stars and flow of gas through the disc .",
    "this gradient is at least a factor of two steeper than our values , presented in table 3 . however , as discussed in section 3 , our sample of rave stars are further from the galactic plane than the @xcite stars , so vertical abundance gradients may - or may not - be an additional parameter . at face value",
    "the amplitude of time - dependent effects in models such as that of @xcite may need to be re - tuned to have a smaller effect for stars further from the plane than @xcite s sample because radial migration of stars and flow of gas through the disc appears to be less effective further from the plane .",

    "this trend is different to what is seen in the thin disc , suggesting these stars do not share the same origin as the thin disc .",
    "metallicity gradients we have estimated from f - type stars are steeper than the ones obtained from g - type stars , for a given population ( table 4 ) . given our sample size , the only robust metallicity gradients we determine are @xmath100 dex kpc@xmath2 and @xmath102 dex kpc@xmath2 respectively , for stars classified as high probability thin disc , i.e. for population types labeled with @xmath99 and @xmath116 .",

    ", we may conclude that the rave dr3 data may be described as two different subsamples , i.e. a thin disc sample biased to young ages , with a detected metallicity gradient , and a thin disc sample biased to somewhat older ages , in which we do not detect any metallicity gradient .",
