    "the majority voter ( mv ) model is one of the simplest non - equilibrium models that present a second order phase transition , and its critical exponents for a two - dimensional square lattices are the same as those of the ising model  @xcite . those results confirm the conjecture that non equilibrium models with up - down symmetry and spin flip dynamics fall within the universality class of the equilibrium ising model  @xcite . however , other numerical results suggest that the mv on non - regular lattices does not belong to the ising universality class  @xcite .    in a recent work yang _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite carried out monte carlo simulations for the mv model on regular lattices from three to seven dimensions , and they found that the critical exponents differ from the ising ones below @xmath2 . based on this results they suggest that the upper critical dimension for the mv model is 6 instead of 4 .",
    "this is a really important result that requires verification , since it implies the existence of a new universality class for ising - like spin systems in regular lattices .",
    "another result that raises some concerns relates to the rushbrooke and josephson hyperscaling relation , which is not satisfied with the reported exponents for the three - dimensional case .",
    "in fact ,  @xcite obtains @xmath3 , and this implies that there is an effective non - integer dimension , a fact that can not be overlooked .",
    "the aim of this work is to study the critical phenomena of the three - dimensional mv model on a cubic lattice , using monte carlo simulations and taking into account the effects of the leading correction to scaling in the evaluation of the critical exponents . in this way",
    "we expect to clarify the universality class for this model .",
    "the mv model in two - dimensional lattices belongs to a family of two - dimensional non - equilibrium kinetic spin models introduced some time ago in  @xcite , and defined by the following evolution rules : during an elementary timestep , an ising - like spin @xmath4 on a square lattice is randomly picked up , and flipped with a probability given by @xmath5 here @xmath6 is the local field produced by the four nearest neighbors to the @xmath7-th spin and @xmath8 is the control parameter ( coupling ) .",
    "the system presents a continuous phase transition from an disordered state ( paramagnetic - like phase ) to an ordered one ( ferromagnetic - like phase ) as @xmath8 is increased , the reported value for the critical point @xmath9 in two - dimensional lattices is @xmath10  @xcite .",
    "this evolution rule can be used also in a three - dimensional cubic lattice , since the updating prescription depends only on the sign of the local field @xmath6 .",
    "this definition is fully equivalent to the used in  @xcite with @xmath11 .",
    "the instantaneous order parameter @xmath12 is defined as an spin average over all lattice sites in each monte carlo time step ( mcts ) @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the total number of lattice sites and @xmath15 is the linear dimension .",
    "from here we can evaluate the moments of the order parameter as time averages @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the transient time and @xmath18 is the running time .",
    "the susceptibility is given by @xmath19 we will use two different cumulants in order to locate the critical point , the fourth order cumulant  @xcite ( commonly known as binder cumulant ) @xmath20 which is often used to locate the critical point , and the second order cumulant  @xcite @xmath21 in the next section we will explain how both cumulants can be combined to improve the estimation of the critical point .",
    "finite size scaling theory establishes that it is possible to know the critical properties of an infinite system , in particular , its critical exponents and amplitude ratios , using a set of finite systems of increasing linear sizes that obey the same microscopic dynamics of the infinite one .",
    "we assume that , even though we are working with a non - equilibrium model , the same scaling forms used in the equilibrium models can be applied .",
    "so , we start with the following fact : for an equilibrium finite systems of linear size @xmath15 , with couplings close to those of the critical point that appears at its @xmath22 limit , the free energy density is given by the scaling ansatz @xmath23 where @xmath24 , @xmath9 is the critical point for the infinite system , @xmath25 is a universal function and @xmath26 is the symmetry - breaking ( magnetic ) field . the parameters @xmath27 , @xmath1 , @xmath28 and @xmath29 are the critical exponents for the infinite system . from  ( [ scaling ] ) the scaling forms for the thermodynamic observables",
    "can be obtained , with @xmath30 , as @xmath31 in principle the scaling relations  ( [ scaling2 ] ) can be used to evaluate the critical exponents when @xmath15 is sufficiently large . for smaller systems scaling corrections",
    ", presents as power law corrections , must be taken into account .",
    "considering one leading correction exponent @xmath32 the scaling relations behave as @xmath33 setting @xmath34 we obtain the following set of equations that allow us to evaluate the critical exponents for small lattice sizes : @xmath35 and @xmath36 the parameters @xmath37 and @xmath38 are non - universal constants . in order to use equations  ( [ beta])@xmath39([nu ] )",
    "we need to evaluate with good accuracy the critical point @xmath9 . in this work",
    "we are using an approach suggested by prez  @xcite that is based on observing the differences between the crossing points in @xmath40 for different values of @xmath15 , with respect to the corresponding crossings evaluated for @xmath41 .",
    "the method take into account the correction - to - scaling effects on the crossing points .",
    "first it is necessary to expand eq .",

    "the next relation must be satisfied @xmath51 here @xmath52 .",
    "we next get the relations @xmath53 and @xcite @xmath54 that can be used to evaluate the critical point . however , in order to avoid nonlinear fittings we need to get rid of the dependence of these expressions on @xmath29 and @xmath32 .",
    "the presence of different @xmath55 coefficients allow us to do this , using the combination of the last two equations to get @xmath56 here @xmath57 and @xmath58 .",
    "( [ linealcrit ] ) is a linear equation that makes no reference to @xmath29 or @xmath32 , and requires as inputs only the numerically measurable crossing couplings @xmath59 .",
    "the intercept with the ordinate provides an improved estimate of the critical coupling .",
    "our simulations where carried out on a three - dimensional simple cubic lattice with periodic boundary conditions , and the linear sizes used were @xmath60 and @xmath61 . starting with a random configuration of spins",
    "the system evolves following the dynamic rule explained in section  [ model ] . even though the mv model does not satisfy the detailed balance condition , it has stationary probability distribution functions .",
    "the stationary state is reached after a transient time , which in this work varied from @xmath62 mcts for @xmath63 to @xmath64 mcts for @xmath65 .",
