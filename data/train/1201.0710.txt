    "in the theory of random media , a variety of different types of two - point correlation functions naturally arise @xcite . here",
    "we define seven different ones that will be employed in this paper .",
    "consider @xmath12-dimensional two - phase textures in which phase @xmath13 has volume fraction @xmath14 ( @xmath15 ) and is characterized by the indicator function @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the region occupied by phase @xmath13 ( equal to 1 or 2 ) .",
    "note that here `` phase '' is used in a general sense in that it can refer to a solid , liquid or even void .",
    "the standard two - point correlation function is defined as @xmath18 where angular brackets denote an ensemble average .",
    "this function is the probability of finding two points @xmath19 and @xmath20 both in phase @xmath13 .",
    "henceforth , we will drop the superscript `` @xmath13 '' and only consider the correlation functions for the phase of interest .",
    "for _ statistically homogeneous _ and _ isotropic _ microstructures , which is the focus of the rest of the paper , two - point correlation functions will only depend on the distance @xmath21 between the points and hence @xmath22 .",
    "the surface - void @xmath8 and surface - surface @xmath7 correlation functions are respectively defined as @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the two - phase interface indicator function . by associating a finite thickness with the interface , @xmath8 and @xmath7",
    "can be interpreted , respectively , as the the probability of finding @xmath19 in the `` dilated '' interface region and @xmath20 in the void phase and the probability of finding both @xmath19 and @xmath20 in the `` dilated '' interface region but in the limit that the thickness tends to zero @xcite .",
    "the lineal - path function @xmath25 is the probability that an entire line of length @xmath26 lies in the phase of interest , and thus contains a coarse level of _ connectedness _ information , albeit only along a _ lineal path _",
    "the chord - length density function @xmath27 gives the probability associated with finding a  chord \" of length @xmath26 in the phase of interest and is directly proportional to the second derivative of @xmath25 @xcite .",
    "( chords are the line segments between the intersections of an infinitely long line with the two - phase interface . )",
    "the pore - size function @xmath28 is related to the probability that a sphere of radius @xmath26 can lie entirely in the phase of interest @xcite and therefore is the three - dimensional  spherical \" version of the lineal measure @xmath10 .",
    "the two - point cluster function @xmath29 gives the probability of finding two points separated by a distance @xmath26 in the same _ cluster _ of the phase of interest @xcite .",
    "note that a cluster of a phase is any topologically connected subset of that phase .",
    "the two - point cluster function can be measured experimentally using any appropriate three - dimensional imaging technique ( e.g. , tomography , confocal microscopy and mri ) @xcite .",
    "the fact that @xmath30 contains intrinsic three - dimensional topological information is to be contrasted with @xmath4 , which can obtained from a planar cross - section of the texture . in general , @xmath30 is expected to embody a much greater level of three - dimensional connectedness information than either @xmath10 or @xmath9 , but the degree to which this is true has yet to be quantitatively demonstrated , which is one of the aims of this paper .",
    "the stochastic optimization reconstruction algorithm for digitized media formulated by yeong and torquato @xcite is ideally suited to carry out the aforementioned analysis because it can incorporate different types of target statistical descriptors .",
    "this algorithm is both robust and simple to implement @xcite . in this method ,",
    "one starts with an initial realization of a random medium and a set of target correlation functions @xmath31 , @xmath32 , @xmath33 , @xmath34 , which are obtained ( i.e. , measured ) from the medium of interest . here",
    "@xmath35 is an @xmath1-point correlation function of type @xmath36 , @xmath37 , and @xmath38 denotes the position vector of the i_th _ point .",
    "the method proceeds to find a realization in which calculated correlation functions @xmath39 ,",
    "@xmath40 , @xmath41 , @xmath34 best match the corresponding target functions .",
    "this is achieved by minimizing an  energy \" @xmath42 ^ 2,\\ ] ] which is defined to be the sum of squared differences between the calculated and target functions , via a simulated annealing method in which a sequence of trial realizations is generated and accepted with the probability min@xmath43 , where @xmath44 is the energy difference between the new and old realizations and @xmath45 is a fictitious temperature",
    ". the initially  high \" temperature is lowered according to a prescribed annealing schedule until the energy of the system approaches its ground - state value within a very small tolerance level .",
    "it is instructive to consider the energy defined by ( [ eq208 ] ) when only the standard two - point correlation function @xmath4 is used . in this special instance , the energy is given by @xmath46 ^ 2 , \\label{energy_s2}\\ ] ] where @xmath47 and @xmath4 are the two - point correlation functions of the target and reconstructed medium , respectively .",
    "we note that most previous reconstruction studies have only tried to match @xmath4 .",
    "however , it is now well established that @xmath48 is not sufficient information to generally get an accurate rendition of the original microstructure @xcite in other words , the ground states when only @xmath4 is incorporated in the energy [ eq .",
    "( [ energy_s2 ] ) ] are highly degenerate due to the nonuniqueness of the information content of this two - point function , which is clearly illustrated by the subsequent examples in the paper .",
    "the reader is also referred to the _ supporting text _ , which provides a rigorous explanation for the degeneracy of the ground states for digitized representations of textures .",
    "an obvious additional set of correlation functions that could be incorporated in the reconstruction is the higher - order versions of @xmath4 , namely , @xmath5 , @xmath6 , etc .",
    "however , not only is the three - point correlation function @xmath5 more difficult to compute , it is not at all clear that its incorporation will result in appreciably better reconstructions because it only introduces local information about triangles when there is no long - range order , the most common occurrence .",
    "we can quantitatively verify the insufficiency of conventional triangular information by reconstructing a one - dimensional equilibrium distribution of equal - sized hard rods @xcite using @xmath5 ( see the _ supporting text _ for technical details ) . figure [ fig_hardrod ] compares this reconstruction to those involving @xmath4 alone and a combination of @xmath4 and @xmath30 .",
    "it is clear that the reconstruction using @xmath4 only significantly results erroneously in a highly clustered `` rod '' phase .",
    "although incorporating @xmath5 provides an improved reconstruction , it still contains large clusters and isolated rods that can be much smaller than actual rod size . on the other hand ,",
    "the @xmath4-@xmath30 hybrid reconstruction produces the most accurate rendition of the target medium . while this one - dimensional example is suggestive that @xmath30 contains nontrivial structural information in excess to what is contained in @xmath4 , one must investigate this problem in higher dimensions , which presents algorithmic challenges , as we will describe in the next section",
    "here we present a general methodology that enables one to efficiently incorporate a wide class of lower - order correlation functions in the yeong - torquato reconstruction procedure .",
    "the aforementioned probabilistic interpretations of the correlation functions enable us here to develop a general sampling method for reconstruction of statistically homogeneous and isotropic digitized textures based on the  lattice - gas \" formalism , which was introduced in ref .",
    "@xcite and has been generalized here . in the generalized formalism ,",
    "pixels with different values ( occupying the lattice sites ) correspond to distinct local states and pixels with the same value are considered to be `` molecules '' of the same  gas \" species @xcite .",
    "the correlation functions of interest can be obtained by binning the separation distances between the selected pairs of molecules from particular species .    in the case of @xmath4 ,",
    "all `` molecules '' are of the same species .",
    "we denote the number of lattice - site separation distances of length @xmath26 by @xmath49 and the number of molecule - pair separation distances of length @xmath26 by @xmath50 .",
    "thus , the fraction of pair distances with both ends occupied by the phase of interest , i.e. , the two - point correlation function , is given by @xmath51 .",
    "to obtain @xmath30 , one needs to partition the `` molecules '' into different subsets @xmath52 ( `` species '' ) such that any two molecules of the same species are connected by a path composed of the same kind of molecules , i.e. , molecules that form a cluster , which is identified using the `` burning '' algorithm @xcite . the number of pair distances of length @xmath26 between the `` molecules '' within the same subset @xmath52 is denoted by @xmath53 . the two - point cluster function",
    "is then given by @xmath54 .",
    "the calculation of @xmath7 and @xmath8 requires partitioning the `` molecules '' into two subsets : the surface set @xmath55 containing only the `` molecules '' on the surfaces of the clusters and the volume set @xmath56 containing the rest . in a digitized medium",
    ", the interface necessarily has a small but finite thickness determined by the pixel size .",
    "thus , the surface - surface and surface - void correlation functions can be regarded as probabilities that are given by @xmath57 and @xmath58 , respectively ; where @xmath59 gives the number of distances between two surface molecules with length @xmath26 and @xmath60 is the counterpart for pairs with one molecule on the surface and the other inside the cluster .",
    "the lineal path function @xmath10 can be obtained by computing the lengths of all digitized line segments ( chords ) composed of pixels of the phase of interest , and for each chord incrementing the counters associated with the distances equal to and less than that chord length @xcite .",
    "the chord - length density function @xmath11 can then be easily obtained by binning the chord lengths that are used to compute @xmath10 @xcite .",
    "the pore - size function @xmath9 can be computed by finding the minimal separation distances of pixels within the phase of interest to those at the two - phase interfaces .",
    "the minimal distances are then binned to obtained a probability distribution function , the complementary cumulative distribution function of which is @xmath9 @xcite .",
    "we have also devised methods to track clusters and surfaces that enable one to quickly compute the correlation functions of the new realization based on the old ones ( see the _ supporting text _ for technical details ) and thus make the yeong - torquato reconstruction procedure much more efficient than methods that directly re - sample the correlation functions for each trial realization .",
    "we have used this general procedure here to reconstruct a wide spectrum of random textures , including model microstructures , such as the cherry - pit model , equilibrium hard spheres , debye random media and symmetric cell materials @xcite , as well as the digitized representations of sandstones @xcite , metal - ceramic composites @xcite , concrete microstructures @xcite , laser speckle patterns @xcite and galaxy distributions . using the aforementioned largest set of correlation functions utilized to date",
    ", our analysis reveals that the best reconstructions always incorporate the two - point cluster function @xmath29 . in what follows",
    ", we will present specific results for only a subset of the correlation functions that we used , namely , various combinations of @xmath4 , @xmath7 , @xmath9 and @xmath30 , for the non - percolating phases of a concrete microstructure @xcite , a distribution of galaxies , and a three - dimensional hard - sphere packing .",
    "the wide range of structural features in concrete , from nanometer - sized pores to centimeter - sized aggregates , makes it a wonderful example of a multi - scale microstructure @xcite .",
    "figure  [ fig - con](a ) shows a binarized digitized image of a concrete sample cross - section .",
    "we have thresholded the original image so that the blue phase represents the stones and the lighter gray phase is the cement paste .",
    "the  stone \" phase is characterized by a dense dispersion of  particles \" of various sizes : a nontrivial situation to reconstruct .",
    "using @xmath4 alone overestimates clustering in the system and indeed incorrectly yields a percolating `` particle '' phase .",
    "thus , although @xmath4 of the reconstruction matches the target one with very small error ( see the figure in the _ supporting text _ ) , such information is insufficient to get a good reconstruction . incorporating both @xmath4 and surface - surface function @xmath7 leads to a better rendition of the target system but the reconstruction still overestimates the degree of clustering . on the other hand , incorporating @xmath30 yields an excellent reconstruction in that the `` stone '' phase clearly appears as a particle dispersion with a size distribution that closely matches that of the target structure .",
    "as noted in the introduction , we can quantitatively test the accuracy of the reconstructions by measuring unconstrained correlation functions and comparing them to the corresponding quantities of the target system . here",
    "we choose to compute the unconstrained lineal - path function @xmath10 .",
    "figure  [ fig - con](e ) reveals that the lineal - path function of the reconstruction that incorporates @xmath30 matches the target function @xmath10 well and it clearly is appreciably more accurate than the other reconstructions .",
    "correlation functions have been used to understand the formation of galaxies and the large scale structure of the universe @xcite .",
    "such characterizations are becoming increasingly important with the advent of high - quality surveys in cosmology .",
    "we suggest that the reconstruction procedure can provide an important tool in cosmological and astrophysical applications , especially in helping to determine the lower - order correlation functions that reflect _ a priori _ information about nontrivial structural features , such as multi - scale clustering and filamentary structures in the universe .",
    "figure  [ fig - galaxy](a ) shows a binarized image of a portion of the abell 1689 galaxy cluster .",
    "we have chosen the binarizing threshold such that the  galaxy \" phase ( bright spots in fig .",
    "[ fig - galaxy]a ) exhibits different sized clusters .",
    "as one can see , the `` primary '' ( single largest ) cluster in the target system has been reproduced by all the reconstructions .",
    "this is because the volume fraction of the `` galaxy '' phase is relatively small while the target @xmath4 has a relatively long tail ( see the figure in the _ supporting text _ ) , which requires the clustering of a majority of `` galaxy '' phase .",
    "however , the `` secondary '' ( smaller compact ) clusters are significantly different for different reconstructions .",
    "the reconstruction using @xmath4 only produces large elongated secondary clusters .",
    "incorporating @xmath7 enables one to obtain a better rendition , however it still contains a few elongated secondary clusters .",
    "the incorporation of @xmath30 again provides the most accurate reconstruction .",
    "this is visually verified by examination of both the sizes and shapes of the primary and secondary clusters , and is quantitatively confirmed by the comparison of the unconstrained @xmath10 of the reconstructed and target systems , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig - galaxy](e ) .      as an application of our methodology to three dimensions ,",
    "we have reconstructed a digitized realization of an equilibrium distribution of equal - sized hard spheres , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig - sphere](a ) .",
    "this packing is generated using the standard metropolis monte carlo technique for a canonical ensemble of hard spheres in a cubical box under periodic boundary conditions @xcite .",
    "a visual comparison of the hybrid reconstruction involving the two - point cluster function reveals that it accurately yields a dispersion of well - defined spherical inclusions of the same size , in contrast to the @xmath4 reconstruction , which again grossly overestimates clustering of the  sphere \" phase .",
    "in contrast to the previous examples , here we incorporate the pore - size function @xmath9 ( not the surface correlation functions ) in one of the reconstructions .",
    "although the reconstruction incorporating @xmath9 provides improvement over the rendition on the @xmath4-alone reconstruction , it is still inferior to the @xmath4-@xmath30 reconstruction in reproducing both the size and shape of the `` sphere '' phase .",
    "( the target and reconstructed correlation functions are shown in the _ supporting text_. ) the accuracy of the @xmath4-@xmath30 hybrid reconstruction can also be seen by comparing the unconstrained lineal - path function @xmath10 of the target system to those of the reconstructed media [ see fig .",
    "[ fig - sphere](e ) ] .",
    "in summary , while it was known that the information content of the standard two - point function @xmath4 of a random texture is far from complete , we have demonstrated here that the next higher - order version @xmath5 generally does not contain appreciably greater information .",
    "the fact that this natural extension to incorporate higher - order @xmath61 , which has been pursued in the last century in statistical mechanics , is not a fruitful path motivated us to inquire whether there exist sensitive two - point statistical descriptors that embody nontrivial structural information .",
    "we probed the information content of seven different types of two - point functions using inverse reconstruction methods . for all of the examples studied here , reconstructions that include the two - point cluster function @xmath30 were always found to be significantly more accurate than those involving any of the combinations of pairs of the other functions .",
    "more precisely , the incorporation of @xmath30 significantly reduces the number of compatible microstructures as compared to the compatible microstructures consistent with the same three - point function @xmath5 , which is schematically indicated in fig .",
    "[ fig00 ] .",
    "the two - point cluster function is an especially sensitive structural signature when clustering and phase connectedness are present , the most difficult situations to treat .",
    "this can be seen from the reconstruction of the hard - rod system that incorporated @xmath30 ( see fig .  [ fig_hardrod ] ) .",
    "more importantly , we showed the utility of @xmath0 in higher dimensions by accurately reconstructing galaxy distributions , concrete microstructures and dense hard - sphere packings , among other examples .    why is @xmath29 a superior two - point structural signature ? to answer this question , it is useful to first compare it to @xmath62 .",
    "the latter , unlike @xmath29 , does not distinguish between events in which the end points of the line segment of length @xmath26 fall in the same cluster of a particular phase and those that do not involve the same cluster of that phase @xcite .",
    "more precisely , @xmath30 is the  connectedness \" contribution to the standard two - point correlation function , i.e. , @xmath63 where @xmath64 measures the probability that the end points of a line segment of length @xmath26 fall in different clusters of the phase of interest .",
    "therefore , whereas @xmath62 is insensitive to clustering and percolation , @xmath29 becomes a progressively longer - ranged function as clusters grow in size such that its volume integral diverges at the percolation threshold @xcite .",
    "by contrast , the quantities @xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath9 , @xmath7 and @xmath8 are insensitive to crossing the percolation threshold . indeed , for particle systems",
    ", one can show that @xmath30 is a functional of the infinite set of ",
    "@xmath1-particle \" connectedness functions @xcite .",
    "thus , although @xmath30 is a  two - point \" quantity , it actually embodies higher - order structural information in a way that makes it a highly sensitive statistical descriptor over and above @xmath4 .",
    "this ability to  leap frog \" past the usual approach of incorporating additional information via higher - order versions of @xmath4 has important ramifications for new structure / property of random textures .",
    "specifically , our work suggests that new theories should be developed that relate the transport , mechanical , chemical and optical properties of random textures to functionals that incorporate @xmath30 .",
    "it is clear that such theories would be highly predictive , since it is well established that the presence of clusters in textures can dramatically alter their macroscopic physical properties @xcite .",
    "it should not go unnoticed that our work also has important implications for atomic and molecular systems where the analogous standard correlation functions that arise are the two - body correlation function @xmath65 , three - body correlation function @xmath66 , etc .",
    "@xcite the three - body function @xmath66 , for example , has been the focus of great attention , e.g. , integral equations and approximations have been devised for @xmath66 @xcite .",
    "the spatial structure of disordered atomic or molecular systems may be regarded to be special cases of random textures .",
    "for example , the particles that comprise simple atomic systems are fully specified by their center - of - mass coordinates .",
    "these point distributions can be decorated in an infinite number of ways to produce random textures in the sense that we have defined them in this paper .",
    "for example , one could circumscribe the points by spheres of size dictated by the physics of the problem ( e.g. , electron hopping distance ) . for such systems",
    ", our work suggests that the pair - connectedness function @xmath67 ( i.e. , the connectedness contribution to @xmath65 @xcite ) should contain far greater information than @xmath66 beyond that contained in @xmath65 .",
