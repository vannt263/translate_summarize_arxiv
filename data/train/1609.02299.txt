    "the realization of both high optical transmission and long group delay still remain a challenge  @xcite . due to the resolved - sideband condition , a high mechanical frequency",
    "is required , which inevitably leads to a high mechanical dissipation rate , and thereby small group delay . even though the optical transmission can be increased by a larger optomechanical cooperativity",

    "in contrast to conventional optomechanical systems , a small gain for the mechanical mode is introduced ( @xmath154 ) , so that the system works in the deeply - unbalanced gain and loss regime .",
    "we will show that even a small amount of mechanical gain may greatly enhance the transmission center peak , which corresponds to a much sharper change in the dispersion curve and hence to an ultra - long group delay .",

    "the enhancement of the optical transmission [ see the red - solid curve in fig .  [ fig8](a ) ] leads to an abrupt variation of the dispersion [ see the red - solid curve in fig .  [ fig8](b ) ] and therefore a large optical group delay of the outgoing optical field .",
    "the center dispersion variation is shown in the inset of fig .",
    "[ fig8](b ) .",
    "next , we discuss how the coupling strength @xmath6 affects the enhancement of the group delay of the optical field . the transmission coefficient @xmath133 versus detuning @xmath131 for different coupling strengths @xmath6 ( e.g. , @xmath156 )",

    "[ fig9](b ) ] are not linearly dependent on the coupling strength @xmath6 ; that is , there is a critical value of @xmath6 beyond which leads to a decrease in the enhancement .",
    "in contrast with conventional optomechanical systems , the @xmath0-symmetric - like optomechanical system possesses one critical point ( @xmath157 ) in the broken @xmath0-symmetry regime .",
    "when @xmath6 is set to bring the system to the vicinity of the critical point , an enhancement of the probe field and sharp variation of the dispersion can be achieved . here",

    "the critical point appears when the denominator of eq .",

    "physically , such strong enhancement of @xmath133 and @xmath159 originates from the small mechanical - gain - induced strong photoelastic scattering and anti - stokes field . in other words , the optomechanical interaction and the anti - stokes field",

    "it is well known that the optical transmission in an eit window experiences a dramatic reduction in its group velocity , which is also true for the light transmitted in the omit window for conventional optomechanical systems  @xcite .",

    "figure  [ fig10](e ) also shows that the position of the critical point can be controlled by adjusting the mechanical gain .    in conventional optomechanical systems ,",
