    "we deal with groups isospectral to finite simple classical groups .",

    "we conclude that @xmath669 , a contradiction . if @xmath486 , then the numbers @xmath670 , @xmath671 , and @xmath672 are odd and one of them is a multiple of @xmath29 .",

    "therefore , @xmath685 is equal to @xmath686 when @xmath484 and to @xmath687 when @xmath486 .",
    "let @xmath688 and @xmath386 .",
    "as for @xmath681 , we have @xmath689 , it follows that @xmath690 .",
    "if @xmath691 , then @xmath478 is even , and so @xmath692 .",

    "so @xmath705 and there are only two possible values for @xmath567 .",

    "then @xmath489 yields @xmath708 . if @xmath499 , then @xmath492 , and if @xmath709 , then @xmath710 , which contradicts to the fact that @xmath516 .",
    "thus @xmath486 , and it follows from @xmath489 that @xmath499 .",

    "choose @xmath688 and take @xmath386 .",
    "since for @xmath681 , we have @xmath689 , it follows that @xmath726 .",
    "it is easy to see that if @xmath727 , then @xmath614 contains a number divisible by @xmath703 for each @xmath681 , which is impossible .",
    "so we assume that @xmath728 .",

    "similarly , if @xmath741 then @xmath742 . if @xmath743 , then @xmath386 can take at most two different values , but there must be at least three of them as @xmath706 is a coclique in @xmath334 . and if @xmath744 , then @xmath745 , and this contradiction completes the proof .",
    "if @xmath17 with @xmath18 , @xmath447 with @xmath746 , @xmath24 with @xmath23 , or @xmath22 with @xmath21 , then @xmath525 .",
    "we eliminated all possibilities for the group @xmath6 under the assumption that @xmath525 , and so the proof of theorem  [ t : main ] is complete .    although the final part of the proof is technically complicated , its idea is transparent and based on an application of the well - known pigeonhole principle . here",
    "pigeons are from @xmath747 and holes are from @xmath748 .",
    "the number of pigeons and number of holes are almost the same and , what is sufficient , the difference between them is a small constant which does not depend on @xmath312 .",
    "however , there are prohibited holes , and the number of those holes increases when so does  @xmath27 .",
    "it provides a contradiction that becomes evident with the growth of  @xmath27 .",
