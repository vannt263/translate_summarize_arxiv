    "the explosion mechanism known as the delayed - detonation model seems to offer the best agreement with sn ia observations , provided one varies the deflagration - to - detonation transition density to yield a range of  mass .",
    "successes of this model include the reproduction of the observed range of peak luminosities ; the correct stratification of chemical elements in the ejecta to match the spectral line widths of c , o , intermediate - mass elements ( imes ) and iron - group elements ( iges ) ; the proper correlation between maximum brightness and width of the light curve @xcite ; the diversity in maximum - light spectra from sub - luminous to  standard \" luminosity events @xcite .",
    "modeling of x - ray spectra from sn ia remnants provides independent support for this delayed - detonation mechanism @xcite .    in ( * ? ? ? * hereafter d13 ) , we presented an investigation , probably not exhaustive , of critical ingredients for the radiative - transfer modeling of sn ia ejecta until the onset of the nebular phase .",
    "our work revealed the need to treat a variety of non - lte processes that are crucial to obtain reliable temperature and ionization structures . with such ingredients included , it appears that one can capture the fundamental spectral characteristics of sne ia from @xmath010 to + 40d after @xmath1-band maximum , i.e. , at least until the onset of the nebular phase .",
    "how well the delayed - detonation scenario reproduces the observed evolution of sne ia during their first week after explosion has been less studied .",
    "interest in this question is warranted today by the novel observational constraints set by the nearby sn2011fe @xcite .",
    "the color and brightness of a sn ia at early times may be affected in various ways , but the consensus is that it is controlled by  decay heating @xcite .",
    "multi - d fluid instabilities inherent to combustion may produce a complex 3-d chemical distribution in the ejecta , and in particular mixing of -rich material that could influence the outer ejecta @xcite , its heat content and therefore the sn ia radiation at early times . in numerical simulations ,",
    "ejecta asphericity seem further enhanced , perhaps unrealistically , by a non - spherical initiation of the explosion itself @xcite .",
    "such ejecta asphericities cause the sn radiation to be angle dependent , producing one possible explanation to sn spectral diversity @xcite .",
    "observationally , sne ia exhibit diverse trajectories for the p - cygni profile minima in velocity space , implying distinct recession velocities of sn ia ejecta photospheres @xcite .",
    "early time observations are probably best to reveal the diversity of progenitor and explosion properties since early - time spectra and photometry should show signatures related to the companion star @xcite , or the structure of the outer layers of the white dwarf as a result of a merger and/or complex accretion processes .",
    "however , there has been only a limited discussion in the literature concerning the specific behavior of delayed - detonation models at early times , and then they are usually limited to semi - analytical solutions for the luminosity ( e.g. , @xcite ) . since sne ia may exhibit a  dark phase \" @xcite , there is also some tension in the explosion time inferred from observations and models @xcite , suggesting that such a fundamental quantity still retains some uncertainty even for the best observed type ia sn , sn 2011fe .",
    "for that sn , @xcite primarily focus on the maximum - light spectrum to discriminate between explosion models .",
    "previous time - dependent simulations of sne ia , generally performed using the monte carlo technique , typically adopt a modest maximum grid velocity of @xmath225000(e.g . , @xcite ) .",
    "this value is somewhat small for a radiative - transfer study at early post - explosion time , when the spectrum - formation region is located in the outermost ejecta layers .",
    "poor photon statistics also impact the accuracy of predicted observables .",
    "this can prevent an assessment of the properties of weaker lines , such as c  line emission / absorption ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) which can carry critical information on the explosion mechanism .",
    "it is commonly assumed that the light - curve of type ia sne is almost entirely controlled by through heating of the ejecta  any observational signature of the initial temperature arising from the sn explosion being lost ( before the ejecta is 1 day old ) due to the large expansion rate . when there are discrepancies of the light - curve with observations , mixing or ejecta asymmetry is invoked .",
    "however it is necessary to consider whether the outer temperature of sn ia ejecta could be larger than that generally obtained in standard explosions of chandrasekhar - mass white dwarfs in hydrostatic equilibrium . in nature , a larger progenitor radius ( as in the extreme case of red - supergiant stars ) can cause a sn to remain more luminous and relatively bluer for longer . in the case of a white dwarf , very large variations would be needed to sufficiently swell the star and quench cooling from expansion .",
    "such modulations are therefore unlikely to be large enough to produce the desired effect . instead",
    ", an attractive configuration is an explosion from a pre - expanded white dwarf or from a white dwarf with a buffer of mass around it , or similar configurations that may arise from a pulsation or from a binary merger .",
    "as we show in this paper , such configurations will alter in other ways the outer ejecta and offer an interesting means to generate spectral diversity from sn ia models , even for a quasi spherical ejecta .    in the next section , we present the observational data we use to confront with our models .",
    "we then investigate the behavior of our delayed - detonation models at early times , and in particular discuss the ingredients that affect their properties ( section  [ sect_pb ] ) .",

    "in this section we discuss the potential merits of the pulsational - delayed detonation model to explain a number of sn ia properties , in particular those that we do not reproduce satisfactorily with the  standard \" delayed - detonation model .",

    "we first initiate a deflagration in a chandrasekhar - mass white dwarf . after a modest expansion of the white dwarf , we stop nuclear burning . upon the subsequent infall and compression of the white dwarf material that is still bound ,",

    "this allows more carbon to remain unburnt compared to the  standard \" delayed - detonation scenario , which generally leaves no unburnt material at all @xcite .",
    "pulsational - delayed - detonation models correspond to the pddel sequence , which is composed of individual models named pddelm with m being 1 , 3 , 7 , 4 , 9 , 11 , and 12 , in order of decreasing  mass , from 0.76 to 0.25 .",

    "hence , our simulations differ only in initial ejecta properties .",
    "the ejecta structures of models pddel are significantly different from those of ddc models , forming two distinct families .",
    "this stems primarily from the hydrodynamical interaction that takes place in pddel models , between the outer infalling white dwarf and the inner layers of the white dwarf where the detonation goes off .",
    "this reduces the amount of mass at large velocity .",
    "it also produces a steep change in density ( hereafter termed the cliff ) at the lagrangian mass where the interaction takes place and a much larger temperature of the lower density shocked material than in the  standard \" delayed - detonation scenario .",
    "the density cliff is located at slightly larger velocities in models with a larger  mass , but the scatter is small , with a mean velocity of @xmath214000  ( in practice , this value can be altered by slight adjustments in the numerical procedure , so it is not obtained robustly from first principles ) .    to illustrate differences ,",

    "these non - trivial variations could be a clear source of diversity at a given  mass ( or peak luminosity ) .",
    "models of the pddel sequence also systematically show a stronger confinement of chemical species .",
    "in particular , nuclear processed imes are restricted to a narrower velocity range than in  standard \" delayed - detonation models .",
    "using physically - consistent ejecta properties is essential for sn studies ( see , e.g. , the discussion in @xcite in the context of sne ii - plateau ) . here , our simulations have to capture the different chemical stratifications , as well as the distinct density and temperature structures of the original ddc and pddel models . as shown in the left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig_comp_tinit ] , the temperature profile at 100s after explosion is drastically different between models pddel1 and ddc6 ( although they have the same  mass )",

    "the temperature shift is very large , much larger than obtained in the ddc sequence through a change in  mass of a factor of 5 and therefore will no doubt cause a dramatic change in the sn radiation properties . for pddel models ,",
    "it is essential to use this initial temperature , which is physical , rather than assuming that it is entirely controlled by  decay , which is only true in -rich regions .",

    "in contrast , the inner ejecta ( say below @xmath210000 ) are very comparable between the ddc and pddel sequences , so we anticipate that the photometric and spectroscopic differences between the two sets of models will occur primarily at early times , during the rise to bolometric maximum . in the next section , we discuss to what extent the different initial conditions ( enhanced temperature in the outer ejecta ; presence of a density cliff at @xmath213000 - 15000 ; residual unburnt carbon ) alter the sn ia radiative properties we obtain for the  standard \" delayed - detonation simulations presented in @xcite and d13 .",
    "in this section , we discuss the photometric and spectroscopic differences between the ddc and pddel series . to be concise , we focus on two sets of models at large ( ddc6 and pddel1 ) and low ( ddc22 and pddel12 )  mass .",
    "our  simulations of pulsational - delayed detonation models exhibit a number of striking differences with their  standard \" delayed - detonation counterparts .    at times prior to peak , pddel models are more luminous and bluer than their corresponding ddc model ( fig .  [",
    "fig_lc ] ; the effect is more pronounced in @xmath16 than in the @xmath11 color shown in the right panel ) .",
    "the early - time luminosity still correlates with  in the pddel sequence , but the sensitivity is weaker .",
    "all these properties stem from the larger initial temperature in the outer ejecta , which is caused not by  but by the hydrodynamic interaction that arises in the pulsational - delayed - detonation scenario . in practice , assuming no decay heating , no radiative cooling , and no radiative diffusion , the @xmath17 evolution of outer ejecta mass shells yields a temperature on the order of 10000k at 0.5d for pddel models , and typically a factor of 10 lower in ddc models ( fig .",
    "[ fig_comp_tinit ] ) .",
    "a temperature offset subsists for about 1 - 2 weeks , which suggests that the ejecta keeps a memory of these different initial conditions ( pulsation or not ) until bolometric maximum ( figs .",

    "our pddel models appear more luminous and bluer early on , and from @xmath21d to bolometric maximum pddel models span a reduced range of color compared to our  simulations of ddc models ( right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig_lc ] ) .",
    "however both ddc and pddel models show similar photometric and spectroscopic properties at maximum , and post maximum . at these times",
    "the evolution is controlled by the inner cobalt / iron rich ejecta which have similar properties for a given  mass . as illustrated in figs .",
    "[ fig_comp_tinit][fig_comp_dinit ] , the impact of the  pulsation \" is limited to the outer ejecta layers and , consequently , to the early - time evolution .    for the same level of mixing , the early photometric behavior of pddel models is in better agreement with the observations of sn2011fe than obtained with the ddc models ( fig .",
    "[ fig_pddel_color ] ) .",
    "the higher luminosity and bluer color at early times makes the rising slopes more compatible with observations , the power - law exponents now being @xmath23 rather than @xmath27 for the ddc models .",
    "pddel models are still too red prior to 1 - 2d , but after that those with a large  mass match the color of sn2011fe ( some are even a little too blue ) .",
    "thus the pulsational - delayed - detonation mechanism offers an interesting means to obtain bluer colors and a sizable sn ia luminosity early after explosion , without invoking a direct contribution from  heating through a strong mixing of the ejecta .",
    "a weak correlation of the early luminosity to  mass is present but it results not from decay heating , but from the differing strengths of the hydrodynamic interaction that is caused by the different strengths of the detonation .",
    "these results rely on having knowledge of the initial ejecta temperature immediately after explosion .",
    "they depend on the use of physically consistent models rather than crafted ones with a zero initial temperature  it can not be assumed that nuclear decay is solely responsible for the luminosity at early epochs . at early times , the match would be improved by introducing a 1d shift , as in @xcite , but this worsens the match for the @xmath1-band rise time of model pddel4 with sn2011fe . for the purpose of the present paper , and given the artificial setup for the  pulsation \" , it is unnecessary to be more quantitative .",
    "the contrast between the pddel and ddc models suggests that a slight adjustment of the pulsation setup and burning ( through its influence on the explosion energy ) could bring our pddel4 model in agreement with the observations of sn2011fe , perhaps even using the inferred explosion time of @xcite .",
    "the key is that the early light curve may not be controlled primarily by nuclear decay .",
    "this works also highlights the need for deep observations as early as possible  such observations are needed to capture the sn when it is about a thousand times fainter than at bolometric maximum , and to study what controls the early evolution in luminosity and color .",
    "the early - time light curve and spectra provide important insights into both the explosion mechanism and the progenitor properties .",
    "however , given the uncertainties in numerical models , it is important to build a statistical data base of snia behavior 1520 days before bolometric maximum so that we can investigate how the early - time behavior correlates with other properties of sne ia .",
    "spectroscopic properties of pddel models are markedly different from those of ddc models up until ( approximately ) bolometric maximum .",
    "a montage of spectra that illustrates these spectroscopic differences for our two sets of pddel / ddc models at large and small  mass is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_spec_comp ] . at early times , the bluer color in pddel models is associated with a bluer spectrum throughout the optical range , although all models are typically too cold to radiate much flux in the uv ( i.e. , shortward of @xmath23000k ) .",
    "the concept of a photosphere is still meaningful at such times so this change in color and slope stems from the higher temperature of the radiating layer , in analogy to the emission from a blackbody .",
    "the higher temperature in the outer ejecta of pddel models leads to an increase in ionization at early times .",
    "this , together with the presence of unburnt carbon , produces clearly visible c  lines at early times in pddel models , in particular for high  mass ( fig .",
    "[ fig_pddel_spec@5d ] ) . besides the doublet at 6580 , the c7234  triplet is also present .",

    "blanketing by fe  lines is visible but quite weak .",
    "the conspicuous presence of lines from si , s , and other imes indicates that such pddel models do not match the basic properties of 91t - like events ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "it is clear from the early time spectrum that the ejecta model properties are in error at large velocities .",
    "strong lines like the ca8500  triplet are very broad in the model but much narrower in the observations .",
    "although a mismatch in ionization is a possibility , an alternative is that the density is much lower in reality beyond @xmath225000  than our hydrodynamical code presently predicts .",
    "this applies to both ddc and pddel models .",
    "the density cliff , present in pddel ejecta but absent in  standard \" delayed - detonation models , is central to the understanding of the early spectral morphology of pddel models .",
    "because the outer ejecta layers have a very low density above the cliff , the spectrum formation region quickly recedes after explosion to @xmath214000  where the density steeply rises in our pddel set ( fig .",
    "[ fig_comp_dinit ] ) .",
    "while the spectrum formation region tends to continuously recede in ddc models , it resides for longer within that cliff because it represents a large jump in optical depth .",
    "this density jump also spans a very narrow range of velocities , which drastically reduces the change of line widths with time .",
    "consequently , the radiation forms and emerges from a region with a large density gradient , which is known to reduce the spatial extent of line formation , and thus produce weak absorption / emission in sn ejecta @xcite . because of the particular chemical stratification of pddel models in velocity space , line absorption ( especially associated with imes )",

    "the light curves for the two models and the two sne lie very close to each other , although sn2002bo is notorious for its broad lines @xcite , while sn2011fe has in contrast narrow lines .",
    "this demonstrates that for a given light curve , constrained primarily by the  mass , spectral diversity can arise even from spherical ejecta like the pddel and ddc models we study here .",
    "interestingly , the strongly mixed model ddc10_m4 and the pulsation - delayed - detonation model pddel4 have comparable early - time light curves .",
    "as mentioned earlier , the match at early times would be improved by introducing a 1d shift , as in @xcite , but this worsens somewhat the match for the @xmath1-band rise time of model pddel4 .",
    "more importantly , it seems that the need to argue for a dark phase in a sn ia stems from the assumption that the sn radiation is powered entirely by . at early times",
    ", this radiation could instead come from shock - deposited energy in a configuration conceptually equivalent to the pulsational - delayed - detonation presented here . in that sense ,",
    "sne ia could exhibit a short but not so faint post - breakout phase , analogous to what is expected in sne iib / ib / ic @xcite .",

    "spectroscopically , the match between model pddel4 and sn2011fe is also good ( fig .",

    "the largest discrepancies are at early times , but they seem to concern primarily the widths of the lines .",
    "it is hard at this stage to address this since the outer ejecta is poorly covered by the hydrodynamical code , which probably compromises the accuracy of the density profile beyond 20000 - 30000 .",
    "this density profile would also be different if we changed the setup for the pulsation .",
    "a steeper profile would quench absorption / emission at large velocity and would prevent the formation of the very broad ca  features that we predict , for example . because of this and uncertainties on the temperature / ionization , abundance determinations for these layers are uncertain .",

    "this suggests that apart from a few mismatches at early times ( cah&k region , red part of the optical ) , the pulsational - delayed - detonation model pddel4 is a sound physical model of sn2011fe .",
    "of course , this does not mean it is the only possible ejecta that has a similar evolution as sn2011fe , but it strongly suggests that delayed detonations of that nature are not incompatible with this event .",
    "this result contrasts with the conclusions of @xcite , who favor a white - dwarf  white - dwarf merger progenitor based on maximum - light spectral properties .",
    "however , the numerical procedure we employ to set the pulsation may actually mimic with some basic fidelity the effect that a buffer of mass , resulting from a merger event , would have on the exploding white dwarf remnant .",
    "the hydrodynamic interaction that takes place in pulsational - delayed - detonation models of sne ia causes two features that affect the evolution of line profile widths .",
    "first , the spectrum formation region will tend to reside longer within the density cliff located at the outer edge of the ime - rich layers .",
    "secondly , the bulk of the ejecta mass covers a reduced range of velocities , in particular for imes .",
    "together , these effects reduce the maximum range of line - profile widths as the sn ages .",
    "these effects are absent in  standard \" delayed - detonation models .",
    "hence , the distinct explosion mechanism between pddel and ddc models offers one physical source of spectral diversity . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_line_path ] , these two populations of models are reminiscent of the so - called hvg and lvg sne ia @xcite . while ddc models can match the broad si6355  trough in sne ia like 2009ig or 2002bo @xcite , they poorly fit the sne ia exhibiting a narrower si6355  line , such as sn2005cf ( d13 ) , or sn2011fe . for these ,",
    "the pddel models match both the narrow absorption and the near - constancy of the location of the absorption maximum ( fig .  [ fig_spec_11fe ] ) .",
    "more quantitatively , over the range 20 to 30d after explosion , we obtain a mean velocity gradient of 100300kms@xmath18d@xmath18 ( absolute value ) for models ddc and @xmath20kms@xmath18d@xmath18 for models pddel .    in the context of delayed - detonation and pulsational - delayed - detonation models ,",
    "the hvg and lvg classes of sne ia no longer require strong ejecta asphericity , as proposed by @xcite or discussed by @xcite .",
    "they may instead arise from distinct but quasi - spherical mass distributions in velocity space , some sne ia having a larger mass at large velocity ( e.g. , sn2009ig ) than others ( e.g. , sne 2011fe or 2005cf ) .",
    "in this work , we have investigated the early - time behavior of delayed - detonation models .",
    "although we obtain good agreement around bolometric maximum for these models , we find that the models tend to be very faint and red during the first week after explosion compared to the observations of sn2011fe .    assuming that decay heating is the key mechanism for powering sn ia radiation",
    ", we investigate the effect of treating decay chains other than that of . while  is primarily produced at high density , a number of unstable isotopes , especially associated with imes ,",
    "are produced in the outer ejecta .",
    "we find that these additional decays enhance the early - time luminosity , but at a level that is much too small to reconcile our ddc model with observations of sn 2011fe .",
    "secondly , we examined the role of chemical mixing in our reference model ddc10 ( d13 ) . as expected , we find that radial microscopic mixing , in particular of , influences the early time properties of these models , leading to a luminosity increase of a factor of 2 - 3 for the model with the strongest mixing .",
    "this also produces bluer colors and partially reconciles the model photometry with the observations of sn2011fe .",
    "however , mixing tends to enhance line - optical depths at early times due to larger metal mass fractions and excess heating at large velocities .",
    "this enhances line broadening and exacerbates the discrepancy with sn2011fe , which shows relatively narrow and weak lines .    as an alternative to the ddc models ,",
    "we have presented results from explosion models named pulsational - delayed detonations .",
    "although our setup for the explosion is artificial , it captures approximately what may occur if sne ia arise from the explosion of a white dwarf in a pulsation cycle , or from the explosion following the merger of two white dwarfs , i.e. , a white dwarf remnant surrounded by a buffer of mass . in this context ,",
    "pulsational - delayed detonations differ from standard delayed detonation models by the different chemical stratification of their ejecta in velocity space , the greater survival of unburnt carbon ( @xmath20.02  in all our pddel models , irrespective of  mass ) , the presence of a density cliff at the outer edge of the ime - rich layers , and the much higher initial temperature above ( at higher velocities than ) the density cliff .",
    "consequently , the radiation properties of pulsational - delayed detonations have several striking features absent in standard delayed - detonation models in which the same chemical mixing is applied .",
    "the early time model luminosity can be increased by up to a factor of 10 , and the color is significantly bluer at early times , in much closer agreement with sn2011fe than obtained with weakly mixed ddc models .",
    "these differences do not stem from the influence of , but instead from the different temperature of the outer - ejecta that was shock - heated to very high temperatures in the initial phases of the explosion . other interesting features of the pulsational - delayed detonations , which are seen in numerous sne ia , are    1 .   the weakness of line profiles at early times , making the spectra more featureless ; 2 .   the presence of c  lines for up to a week , with stronger features for sne ia having a larger  mass ( an ionization rather than an abundance effect ) ; 3 .   the markedly different morphology of line profiles . the si6355  profile exhibits narrower p  cygni absorption whose velocity at maximum absorption varies only weakly ( as compared to the ddc models ) over time .    while some of these features are reminiscent of 91t - like objects ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) , the presence at early times of lines from c / o and imes suggests pulsational - delayed detonations are not the explanation for these",
    "91t - like events .",
    "however , we find that our pulsational - delayed detonation model pddel4 matches satisfactorily the multi - epoch spectra and muti - band light curves of sn2011fe , including line features , line profile morphology , trajectory in velocity space of absorption minima .",
    "our pddel models are close to matching the @xmath19 increase in brightness of sn2011fe , as well as the relatively modest evolution in color on the way to bolometric maximum .",
    "although standard delayed detonation models with strong mixing also provide a fair agreement to the early time photometry , they produce broader lines than observed in sn2011fe .",
    "such pulsational - delayed detonation models break a number of intuitive but potentially wrong notions .",
    "first , the sn ia radiation does not necessarily stem exclusively from decay heating , compromising `` diffusion '' models that attempt to explain the origin of the early light curve of sne ia .",
    "second , the variations in line - profile width are not exclusively sensitive to variations in explosion energy , since some kinetic energy may be channeled into internal / radiation energy .",
    "if so , and in the present context , broad and narrow line sne ia should have different colors at early time . in this context",
    "we highlight sn2011fe and sn2002bo , which have similar light curves but very different spectral line profiles .",
    "more generally , pulsational - delayed detonations and delayed detonations produce two distinct sn ia populations reminiscent of the hvg and lvg sne ia @xcite .",
    "interestingly , this spectral diversity is not the result of ejecta asphericity @xcite .",
    "it may be that in some circumstances , these asphericities are modest and it is instead the global , quasi - spherical , ejecta mass distribution that is fundamentally altered in certain explosion configurations .",
    "thus spectral diversity may not result from a randomization of viewing angles on a 3-d structure but from the random sampling of intrinsically diverse quasi - spherical sn ia ejecta .",
    "truth is likely to lie in between these two standpoints , with both multi - d effects present together with sne ia having fundamentally distinct angle - averaged structures .",
    "c  lines are present in our early - time spectra of pddel models ( yielding an interesting agreement with the observations of sn2013dy ; @xcite ) , primarily because of the enhanced ejecta temperature from the hydrodynamic interaction , but they are systematically absent in the corresponding spectra of ddc models .",
    "this suggests a natural association of c  detection and lvg sne ia .",
    "this correlation has been observed by @xcite .",
    "a weak interaction / pulsation or the presence of a low mass buffer around the exploding white dwarf can dramatically alter the outer ejecta layers of the sn ia explosion .",
    "however , such modulations do not impact the bulk of the ejecta mass ( for a given  mass , our ddc / pddel models have essentially the same structure inside @xmath212000 ) , and so this  pulsation \" configuration can bring diversity to the early - time evolution of sne ia without impacting much the maximum and post - maximum evolution ( fig .",
    "[ fig_lc ] ) , which is primarily influenced in our set of ddc and pddel models by the total  mass .",
    "a specific discussion on the decline rate of all our ddc and pddel models , in connection with the width - luminosity relation , is left to a future study .",
