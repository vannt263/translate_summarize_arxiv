    "monte carlo ( mc ) event generators have the double purpose to compensate for detector inefficiencies and to provide theoretical predictions for distributions and integrated cross sections . the second task is more important and difficult .",
    "precision predictions of the standard model , with a total error below 0.5% , for the process of production of the fermion pair in electron ",
    "positron scattering ( @xmath20 ) were first obtained for energies close to the @xmath15 resonance with the mc event generator koralz  @xcite ( see also the latest version  @xcite ) .",
    "the prototype of the modern mc event generator for this process was constructed earlier  @xcite , but it could not deliver sub - per cent precision , because it did not include electroweak corrections and second order qed corrections ( it later became a part of the koralz package ) .",
    "koralz was originally developed for a simulation of the @xmath2-pair production and decay , and later on was extended to muon , quark and neutrino pairs , @xmath21 .",
    "the bhabha scattering @xmath22 was never included in koralz and a dedicated precision mc event generator bhlumi  @xcite was developed for this process .",
    "bhlumi , at the expense of specializing to small scattering angles , could deliver at lep1 energies the integrated cross section with the record total precision of 0.06%  @xcite .",
    "it should be stressed , however , that the high - precision level of koralz and bhlumi was achieved thanks to exclusive exponentiation  @xcite ( eex ) based on the classical work of yennie  frautschi  suura ( yfs )  @xcite , in which the multiple soft and hard real photons are treated in a completely realistic way , i.e. four - momenta are generated , and the infrared ( ir ) cancellations between real and virtual soft photons occur exactly to infinite order .    at the end of lep2 operation the total cross section for",
    "the process @xmath23 will have to be calculated with a precision of @xmath24@xmath25 , depending on the event selection  @xcite .",
    "the arbitrary differential distributions also have to be calculated with the corresponding precision . in future linear colliders ( lcs )",
    "the precision requirement can be substantially stronger , especially for the high luminosity option , as in the tesla case .",
    "the above new requirements necessitate the development of a new calculational framework for the qed corrections and the construction of new dedicated mc programs .",
    "the present work is an important step in this direction .",
    "the main limiting factor that prevents us from getting more precise theoretical predictions for the @xmath26 process is higher - order qed radiative corrections ( the qed part of electroweak standard model ) . in order to achieve the 0.2% precision tag , the virtual corrections have to be calculated up to 23 loops and the multiple bremsstrahlung up to 23 hard photons , integrating exactly the multiphoton phase space for the arbitrary event selection ( phase - space limits ) .",
    "the mc event generators koralz and bhlumi , although representing the state of the art of mc evaluation of qed radiative corrections for @xmath26 at the beginning of the lep2 run , are strongly limited in their development towards higher precision .",
    "the main limitation is rooted in the use of the spin - summed differential cross sections in the otherwise so successful yfs / eex  instead of using spin amplitudes directly .",
    "for this reason , certain interferences such as the one between initial - state radiation ( isr ) and final - state radiation ( fsr ) had to be neglected , especially in the calculations beyond first order .",
    "also , in any processes with more feynman diagrams , such as the bhabha process , eex suffers from the proliferation of the interference terms , especially beyond first order .",
    "eex neglects isr  fsr interferences .",
    "however , they were often unimportant  at the z peak much below 1% of the integrated cross section .",
    "the analogous qed interferences among photons emitted from electron and positron in small - angle bhabha were also small , of order @xmath27 , at the small - angle range of the luminosity measurement .",
    "further improvement on the precision for off-@xmath15-peak ( lep2 ) and for large - angle bhabha scattering definitely requires reintroduction of these interferences .",
    "this is achieved in a natural way by reformulating the exponentiation entirely in terms of spin amplitudes .",
    "this turns out to be quite a non - trivial task , and it was done only recently , see refs .",
    "the resulting new `` reincarnation '' of the yfs exponentiation , called the _ coherent exclusive exponentiation _ ( ceex ) , was born .",
    "the ceex scheme is implemented in the present  mc program for the first time .",
    "in fact we have described in ref .",
    "@xcite only the first version , with the pure qed matrix element , while in the present program we have already implemented the bulk of the qed matrix element , and also electroweak ( ew ) corrections . this new , , important development of ceex , together with the wealth of numerical results , will be published separately  @xcite .",
    "having briefly introduced the reader to the history and the main characteristics of the subject of the mc event generators for the @xmath26 process , let us come to the important question : what is the most complete list of requirements that the precision mc event generator for the @xmath26 process should fulfil in order to satisfy the needs of the experiments in the present and future @xmath28 colliders , that is for the entire centre - of - mass energy range from the @xmath2 production threshold up to 1 tev ?",
    "this would cover experiments at lep , slc , @xmath17-factories , @xmath16-factories , @xmath2-factories , future linear colliders such as tesla , jlc and nlc , and also high - luminosity experiments at the @xmath15 resonance , the so - called @xmath15-factories .    in the following we try to answer the above question , and complete the list of the desired features of the ultimate mc event generator for two - fermion final states :    * the total _ precision _ of the integrated cross section has to be at least 0.2% .",
    "from the above , it automatically follows that we need for the qed part and electroweak corrections the entire first - order and the qed second - order , at least in the leading - log ( ll ) approximation with the exponentiation , e.g. with the contributions , especially for isr .",
    "in fact the qed second - order subleading and third - order leading are also mandatory , at least for the discussion of the theoretical error , but preferably present in the actual mc matrix element .",
    "the inclusion of @xmath29 four - fermion final states will often be necessary , especially the production of the additional soft fermion pair of light fermions . the @xmath15-factory option with @xmath30 statistics",
    "would be the most demanding experiment , asking for precision better than @xmath31 !",
    "note that here we do not attempt to define individual precision requirements for all kinds of distributions and averages , such as charge and spin asymmetries .",
    "we assume that their precision should correspond to a precision of @xmath24-@xmath31 for the integrated cross sections . *",
    "the other role of mc event generators is to provide a",
    "_ realistic picture of the process _ for the detector studies .",
    "it means that it is highly _",
    "undesirable _ to integrate out certain final - state topologies .",
    "for instance we know that contributions from collinear real photons and from virtual photons combine in such a way that the net effect in the integrated cross section is zero or negligible .",
    "nevertheless , for experiments it is of vital importance to have all real photons manifestly in the mc event , even very soft and very collinear ones : it helps enormously to understand correctly the operation of a detector , and hence to reduce the experimental systematic errors .",
    "the same is true for the emission of additional light - fermion pairs .",
    "the above _ maximal exclusivity _ requirement leads directly to _ exponentiation _ in the mc event generator , that is to a procedure in which the perturbative expansion is reorganized in such a way that contributions from ir real and virtual singularities cancel to infinite order .",
    "the remaining non - ir corrections are calculated order by order  for example in the present  mc the non - ir corrections are included in . * for the initial beams and outgoing unstable @xmath2 leptons and @xmath18-quarks _ spin polarizations _ , including _ all spin correlations _ , have to be fully taken into account , also in the presence of the real bremsstrahlung photons . for beams",
    "the longitudinal polarization of both beams is the minimum requirement . for decaying final fermions , longitudinal polarizations are often not sufficient  transverse polarizations are necessary , both for @xmath2 leptons and for @xmath18-quarks . in fact",
    "not only polarizations are required , but also the effects of exact spin correlation between spin polarization vectors of two outgoing fermions .",
    "this again makes it mandatory to the use spin amplitudes and/or spin density matrices for the fermion production and decay processes . * non - qed _ electroweak corrections _ to the @xmath26 process",
    "are usually calculated separately and combined later on with qed corrections in an manner that is , beyond , an `` ad hoc '' recipe .",
    "it is not done at the level of the spin amplitudes , but rather in terms of the inclusive distributions , having integrated some photon phase space e.g. transverse momenta beforehand .",
    "typically such an ad hoc procedure is based on the second- or third - order `` structure functions '' for the incoming electron , adding subleading first- and second - order corrections .",
    "it can be questioned whether such an approach is really justified at the precision level of @xmath24 , because it is too far from the solid environment of the lagrangian , feynman diagrams and the exact phase space .",
    "the monte carlo based on the spin amplitudes offers a natural realization of such an environment .",
    "it is therefore the only viable solution for the problem of combining qed and non - qed corrections beyond first order , without any unnecessary ambiguities .",
    "such a monte carlo can then be used to cross - check ( calibrate ) the popular semi - analytical approaches , which employ all kinds of ad hoc recipes .",
    "this important role should not be underestimated , as the semi - analytical programs have many advantages of their own and will always be around .",
    "* effects due to _ beamstrahlung _ will be present at future linear colliders and thus should be implemented in the mc event generator .",
    "the beamstrahlung structure functions should be a `` user function '' , supplied ( or replaced ) easily by the user , without any loss of the efficiency of the mc program .",
    "note that the `` luminosity energy spectrum '' will be known from machine simulation only to a certain extent ; the true distribution will have to be determined from the inspection of the @xmath26 process , most probably for @xmath32 , at small ( @xmath33 ) or intermediate ( @xmath34 ) angles .",
    "in such a case , reliable mc predictions of the standard model ( sm ) integrated cross sections and distributions in the presence of beamstrahlung , with the non - trivial event selection criteria , are of vital importance . in this context , the @xmath15 radiative return , i.e. the @xmath35 subprocess , may also play an important role . * the mc event generator should be maximally _ upgradable to other processes_. although , in this specification , we concentrate on the precision sm prediction for the two - fermion final states , the mc program should be constructed in such a way that inclusion of the other similar standard processes such as @xmath36 or non - standard processes ( supersymmetric ) should be relatively easy .",
    "also the change of electron beam to muon beam should be possible .",
    "this requires in practice that the mc program be constructed right from the beginning in a _",
    "highly modular _ way .",
    "the object - oriented programming ( oop ) approach would help .",
    "* for quark final states , the photon emission should be well combined with the _ quark  gluon parton shower _ , properly taking qed and qcd corrections at the nll level . *",
    "last but not least the program should also have the option to run in a _ maximally inclusive _ mode in which the type of the final state ( fermion ) is chosen randomly , event per event , exactly according to its integrated cross section .",
    "this requirement is not as trivial as it may seem , since the integrated cross section , in the mc , is typically known at the end of the run ( from the average mc weights ) .",
    "let us note that the above specification goes far beyond the very ambitious ( at the time ) specification of the `` ultimate mc '' formulated at the end of the 1989 lep1 workshop .",
    "how far are we with  mc on the road to this ultimate goal ?",
    "( 160,110 ) ( -2 , 00)(0,0)[lb ]      the present specification of the  mc is summarized in table  [ tab : kk - status ] , where we have also given those of koralz and koralb for comparison .    as we see , the present  mc has already all the functionality of koralb .",
    "the  mc fulfils completely our ultimate specification for the spin treatment . up to now , the first and the only mc event generator fulfilling the above specification was koralb@xcite .",
    "however , koralb is limited to @xmath37 gev , because of the lack of the @xmath15-resonance and it does not include more than one photon emission  it is based on the pure first - order qed calculation , without exponentiation . in koralz , longitudinal polarization effects are implemented at the level of the differential distribution for initial beams and for outgoing fermions ( including longitudinal spin correlations ) .",
    "effects due to transverse spin polarizations are omitted . in the present  program",
    "these limitations are removed  the complete longitudinal and transverse polarizations are implemented for beams and outgoing fermions , including all spin correlations exactly , as in koralb , also in the presence of multiple real photons .    as compared to koralb , there is still one improvement to be done in the  mc : the ceex matrix element does not generally rely on the assumption @xmath38 , but certain parts of the actually implemented virtual corrections may still rely on this approximation , notably the spin amplitudes for the @xmath39-@xmath39 box .",
    "this approximation is not really necessary and will be corrected in the future version .",
    "as compared to koralz , the  mc covers all its functionality , except for the presence of the neutrino channels .",
    "we plan to implement the neutrino channel in the next version .",
    "the most important new features in the present  with respect to koralz is the inclusion of isr  fsr interference , which at lep2 modifies the total cross section and charge asymmetry by about 2% , the inclusion of the second - order subleading corrections and the inclusion of the exact matrix element for two hard photons .",
    "the  mc is the first full - scale event generator to include the bulk of second order nll corrections , and it may easily incorporate second - order nnll corrections .",
    "in fact the exact double bremsstrahlung and exact two - loop virtual corrections are already included , but for the moment there is no need to complete the missing nnll corrections since they are @xmath40 .",
    "the present version of  mc includes first - order qed and electroweak corrections and almost complete qed corrections due to the emission of photons from the initial- and final - state fermions .",
    "it does not include the emission of an additional fermion pair .",
    "the qed part of the calculation is based on the new calculation with coherent exclusive exponentiation ( ceex ) at the amplitude level .",
    "the older qed matrix element based on exclusive exponentiation ( eex ) at the differential distribution level ( amplitudes squared and spin summed ) of the bhlumi type is still present and is used as a backup solution , for various tests . in particular the eex matrix element",
    "includes corrections , which are still absent in our ceex ; it therefore provides a useful estimate of these corrections .      defining the lorentz - invariant phase space as @xmath41 we write the ceex total cross section for the process @xmath42 with polarized beams and decays of unstable final fermions sensitive to fermion spin polarizations , following refs .",

    "we start with a brief discussion of some important general issues .",
    "first of all , we would like to stress that we treat the mc technique as a means of integrating _ exactly _ over the phase space , without any approximation .",
    "generally , our approach is that of the textbooks on quantum mechanics : the differential cross section is the phase - space times the scattering amplitudes from feynman diagrams , squared , spin - summed .",
    "the mc technique is basically the numerical method of integration over the phase space .",
    "our mc is in fact more than the phase - space integration , because we require that events ( lists of four - momenta ) be generated with weight equal 1 , i.e. we directly _ simulate _ the scattering process .",
    "it is quite a strong restriction on the mc algorithm , see below , and it means that our mc program is not merely a _ phase - space integrator _ , but the full - scale mc _ event generator _ ( mceg ) .",
    "concerning the monte carlo techniques , let us remind the reader that there are only a handful of elementary techniques such as weighting - rejection , mapping and multibranching  the whole art being to combine them into one bigger algorithm , see ref .",
    "@xcite for more detailed discussion .",
    "we shall also generally follow the notation and terminology of ref .",
    "there also exists a special group of _ self - adapting _",
    "mc techniques / programs , such as the very popular mc integrator vegas  @xcite , which work , in principle , for arbitrary integrand distributions ( just like a standard gaussian integration program integrates any external function ) .",
    "we use in , for this role , the newly developed foam  @xcite self - adapting program and the old vesko1 ( part of yfs2  @xcite ) as building blocks of our mc , along with other elementary techniques .    in general",
    ", we tried to minimize the use of the multibranching technique and rely as much as possible on the method of reweighting , constructing several layers of weights  the total weight being their product .",
    "nevertheless , we have three multibranchings , one for the types of the final fermions @xmath170 , another one for the photon partitions ( for @xmath58 photons there are @xmath62 ways of attributing photons to isr or fsr ) , and finally for helicities of the bremsstrahlung photons ( for @xmath58 photons there are @xmath62 helicity assignments ) . each of these three multibranchings",
    "is well justified and unavoidable see below .    in the development of the present mc algorithm",
    "there are certain _ critical issues _ , in other words , there are some problems that had to be solved , otherwise it would have been practically impossible to realize the entire mc .",
    "typically , we have seen two possible solutions of an important problem , and we have opted for one of them . in the following we list these critical issues , explaining how the solution was found and/or the critical option chosen .",
    "* _ problem of the sum over partitions in the weight due to ifi_. it was realized already in ref .",
    "@xcite that the effect of the quantum - mechanical interference between photon emissions from initial- and final - state charges ( ifi ) can be introduced by means of the weight @xmath171 , where @xmath172 includes ifi and @xmath173 neglects it . in mc events are generated according to @xmath173 in the first place .",
    "both @xmath172 and @xmath173 include the sum over @xmath62 ways of attributing photons to initial and final states , the so - called photon partitions .",
    "the natural way of generating @xmath173 is to use multi - branching and generate an event for a single partition at a time .",
    "generation of @xmath173 involves the introduction of the additional `` kinematical '' weight of its own .",
    "the possible complication to be avoided is the sum over these kinematical weights over all @xmath62 partitions .",
    "fortunately , this can be done : it is sufficient to multiply @xmath174 by the kinematical weight for a single partition , the one that is actually generated",
    ". the formal proof of this can be found in ref .",
    "the acceptance rate for @xmath58 photons due to @xmath174 is @xmath175 .",
    "it is a severe problem and only the partial , brute - force solution is applied at present . a better solution , taking into account that ifi is destructive for backward scattering and constructive for forward scattering , is needed in the future . *",
    "_ photon helicity generation_. the sum over partitions in @xmath174 already costs a lot of cpu time .",
    "another sum over @xmath62 photon helicities would render the project impractical , even with the present cpu processors .",
    "the solution is to introduce multibranching for @xmath62 photon helicities and generate photon helicities event by event .",
    "it is justified , because high - energy experiment detectors are insensitive to photon polarizations ; consequently the various photon helicity configurations ( branches ) contribute equally . invoking the principles of ref .",
    "@xcite , we can calculate weights like @xmath174 for just one helicity configuration , the actual one .",
    "the sum over @xmath62 photon helicities is avoided . *",

    "the approximate cross section involves a numerical integral over the isr total energy , which has to be done before the mc generation starts .",
    "the integral can be done ( i ) for each flavour separately , ( ii ) or just once , for the flavour - summed cross section . in the mc generation",
    "the above corresponds to two options : ( i ) the fermion type is generated first , and the total energy loss due to isr , just for this fermion , is generated next ; ( ii ) the total energy loss due to isr is generated first , for all fermions , and the type of the fermion using the born cross section for the reduced centre - of - mass energy is generated next .",
    "we have chosen the second option . *",
    "_ comoving frame for the generation of fsr photons . _",
    "generating fsr photons is much more difficult than isr photons because momenta of the final fermions `` move '' , i.e. they are themselves variables in the phase - space integral , contrary to beams in isr , which are fixed ( except for beamstrahlung ) .",
    "moreover , fsr emission distributions are also the simplest in the rest frame of the final fermions . for the construction of the fsr algorithm",
    ", it was critical to reparametrize the phase space in such a way that photon integrals are formulated in the reference frame attached to outgoing fermions .",
    "this comoving frame was used for fsr generation in the earliest version of the yfs3 mc which was incorporated in the koralz program since the version distributed at the time of the 1989 lep1 workshop .",
    "the detailed derivation of the above phase space re - parametrization introducing the comoving frame can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite . * _ common ir boundary for isr and fsr .",
    "_ since isr photons are generated in cms , and fsr photons in the rest frame of the final fermions ( qms ) , the easiest is therefore to introduce the ir cut for real photons in terms of minimum energy in these two frames .",
    "this defines the ir boundary , and ir domains inside them , which are different for isr and fsr real photons ( the lorentz - boosted sphere is ellipsoidal ) .",
    "this is not a problem , as long as the ifi is neglected . for the ceex , however , the ifi is present and the ir boundary has to be common ( for the basic mc in which ifi is neglected ) .",
    "the problem may look very difficult ; however , an inspection of the proof of the independence of the total cross section on the ir boundary for the non - ifi case tells us that we may simply take the common ir domain , which contains both isr and fsr domains , and , for each event , we may `` remove from the record '' all photons that are inside the new common ir domain .",
    "the above is true , however , only for events weight 1 , not for the weighted events , that are present internally in the mc .",
    "for weighted events , such a procedure of `` photon - removal '' can still be done , provided it is accompanied by the additional weight , calculable analytically .",
    "the above procedure of the `` photon - removal with the weight '' was already implemented in the earliest version of yfs3 in koralz ( although it was not really necessary for the eex matrix element there ) ; however , it was never documented . * _ small photon mass as ir regulator in the mc .",
    "_ there exists all the time an interesting option in the mc implementation of the yfs exponentiation , which was never exploited  that is to use the photon mass as an ir regulator in the mc .",
    "the back - of - the - envelope estimate shows that its disadvantages are a slightly more complicated algorithm for the generation of the photon momenta and higher photon multiplicity .",
    "a clear advantage is that such a cut - off is lorentz - invariant : this would therefore make it automatically the same for isr and fsr , so that we would not need to do any gymnastics with the ir boundaries , as described in the previous point .",
    "the user who is familiar with our programs koralz and bhlumi may be puzzled by the fact that we often we point out to some parts of the basic mc algorithm for qed bremsstrahlung , which have existed for a decade but are still unpublished or undocumented ; let us comment briefly on this point . on the one hand , the full - scale isr and fsr multiphoton generator yfs3 with the eex matrix element was never published as a stand - alone program , for instance because of the lack of ew corrections , and it was absorbed into koralz .",
    "its isr algorithm was rather well documented in ref .",
    "@xcite , but its fsr algorithm was never in fact documented in detail .",
    "in the following sections we do this for the first time .",
    "another reason for this time - lag is that the role of the mc programs at lep1 for fermion pairs , perhaps with the exceptions of bhabha scattering and @xmath2 pair production , was limited to removing detector acceptance , and was not really a primary source of the sm predictions .",
    "the simple two - particle final state could be described fairly well with simple semi - analytical calculations such as zfitter . in lep2",
    "the role of the mc as a source of sm predictions seems to be more important , mainly because of the rise of the ifi corrections , and because of the very strong phenomenon of the @xmath15 radiative return channel because of the 4-body final - state kinematics . ] .    in the following",
    "we shall describe the algorithm of the monte carlo generation of the events according to ceex and/or eex differential distributions .",
    "the algorithm is built using elementary methods of weighting and multibranching with occasional use of the mapping ( change of integration variables ) wherever it is possible and/or profitable .",
    "the weights are usually products of several component weights ordered in a `` chain '' .",
    "their role is to counter another `` chain '' of simplifications that were introduced in order to turn very difficult original differential distributions into simpler ones , in which we can integrate manually over certain integration variables ( that is to generate them with the help of mapping ) , one by one .",
    "the remaining small subset of variables for which we are not able to perform the manual / analytical integration / mapping is treated with the help of the self - adapting monte carlo tool  in our case it is foam and/or vesko1 ( optionally vegas ) .",
    "the above `` bottom - to - top '' procedure of simplifications countered by weights , multibranchings , and integrations / mappings will be described in the following subsections , starting with removing ifi ( countered by @xmath174 ) , then simplifying the sm / qed matrix element , reorganizing phase space ( mapping ) , integrating simplified isr and fsr emission distributions ( mapping ) , summing over photon multiplicities , etc .",
    ", such that in the end we are left with only the integral over photon energy loss due to isr and optionally due to beamstrahlung , which is fed into vesko1 or foam . in the mc program the order of action is `` top - to - bottom '' , i.e. the photon energy loss due to isr is generated first ( together with beamstrahlung , if present ) , then the type of the fermion , the isr photon multiplicity and momenta , the fsr photon multiplicity and momenta , and the series of weights brings us back to the desired eex or ceex differential distributions .",
    "the order of the multibranching and weighting elementary methods can be interchanged , with some care , and the rules for doing it are given in ref .",
    "we shall exploit this possibility , as already indicated .",
    "let us describe the whole organization of the weights and distributions in our mc .",
    "we have four principal distributions , pure phase space , model , crude and primary .",

    "* _ the model distribution _ is a density distribution corresponding to a _ physical model _ @xmath179 and it is our ultimate aim to generate mc events according to this differential distribution .",

    "_ the crude distribution _ is a density distribution @xmath180 which is rather close to the _ physical model distribution _",
    ", in fact it is close to all model distributions of a certain class , and it should be _ maximally simple_. it should be lorentz - invariant , with no unnecessary traces of the internal technicalities of the mc , just a maximally simple function of dot - products of the four - momenta .",
    "it should have the same pattern of peaks as all model distributions of a certain class . here and later",
    ", @xmath181 will correspond to the momenta of the outgoing fermions , whereas @xmath182 will denote the momenta of the photons .",
    "in such cases we will write the phase - space dimension explicitly as @xmath183 . * _ the primary distribution _ is a density distribution , @xmath184 defined primarily in the space @xmath185 of variables @xmath186 with the following properties : * * the integral @xmath187 is known independently ; in most cases from analytical integration , or an independent numerical integration of the gauss type , or from a special independent mc run . * * a well - defined mapping @xmath188 exists .",
    "the image of this mapping @xmath189 does not necessarily cover the entire @xmath185 .",

    "its integral @xmath197 sets the whole normalization of the mc .",
    "the main rationale for introducing the intermediate _ crude distribution _ , which obviously stands between the primary and model distributions , is a very strong practical need of modularity of the mc program .",
    "for instance we want to use the same low - level mc event generator for both eex and ceex models .",
    "( as the example of bhlumi shows , on top of the low - level with exponentiation one may even impose a model distribution without exponentiation . )",
    "we definitely want the mc event generator to have a well defined low - level mc part , which generates weighted events according to the _ crude distribution _ , that is with the weight @xmath198 with the importance sampling corresponding to the entire group of physical models .",
    "the above weight is provided by the low - level mc to the outside world _ numerically _ , without any further details on how the event @xmath199 was actually produced  just as a black box .",
    "the _ model weight _ for the @xmath200-th model is the ratio @xmath201 calculated in a separate module , and in this module the crude distribution @xmath202 needs to be known _ functionally _ i.e. , it is calculated locally , using a certain analytical expression in terms of the four - momenta of the event , and without any access to information from the lower - level mc ( we even assume that such an information is already trashed ) .",
    "of course , the total weight is the product of the two : @xmath203 and the total cross section is given by @xmath204 this organization is definitely fully modular .",
    "note also that although we did not require that the crude distribution be analytically integrable , such a property is strongly welcomed for the purpose of the technical tests .",

    "let us finally add a side remark : another valid method of realizing a hypothetical monte carlo with common @xmath77 for isr and fsr is to generate photons using small @xmath100 and to apply a brute - force rejection of all events with one or more photons falling into @xmath99 .",
    "this was used in the early version of bhlumi .",
    "we do not like this method because it may lead to an excessive number of events with zero weight , lowering substantially the efficiency of the mc .",

    "this modification is not necessary for weighted events .",
    "( it can be switched off by adjusting input data ) .",
    "the problem is essentially due to the introduction of the isr - fsr interference , which we have already called ifi . as already known from the case , the weight that introduces ifi is sharply peaked around 1 and has a strict upper bound @xmath465 . the destructive interference with the weights @xmath466 occurs in the backward scattering ( in the fermion scattering angle ) and there is a little constructive interference @xmath467 , mostly in the forward direction .",
    "the maximum weight @xmath468 or a factor of @xmath469 in the _ primary _ primary cross section solves the problem , at the expense of the factor of 2 rejection rate  @xcite .    in the case of @xmath58 photons , however , the same leads to : the maximum weight @xmath470 or equivalently the increase of the _ primary _ cross section by a factor of @xmath62 , and consequently increase of the generated photon multiplicity by a factor of 2 .",
    "of course , almost all of this increase is artificial , and it is compensated by @xmath471 , leaving only some small net effect due to ifi in the mc events . a more sophisticated method would be to increase the _ primary _ primary cross section ( and photon multiplicity ) more selectively , that is in a way dependent on the fermion scattering angle . for the moment we do not do it .",
    "it may be done in the future .",
    "what we do is the following : we increase the _ primary _ cross section by a factor of @xmath472 , where @xmath473 is not equal to 2 , but is adjusted empirically so that the tail of the total mc weight is acceptable .",
    "we have found that the value @xmath474 is the optimal one .",

    ". it can be useful , for example as a cross check , in the situation when one selects output events strongly , that is imposes cuts that eliminate all but say 1 event in a 1000 .",
    "if at the same time it is seen from the output of kk2f_finalize that the cross section corresponding to @xmath586 is at the similar level of @xmath587 , it is then necessary to cross check if the accepted events do not coincide , by bad luck , with the `` overweighted '' events . if it were true , then the cross section and the distribution of the accepted events could be affected by factor of 2 or more . in that sense",
    "the weighted events are `` safer '' .",
    "it should be kept in mind that , although we have set the maximum weights for the rejection rather high , the user may try an untested configuration of the input data for which the cross section corresponding to @xmath586 is too high .",
    "we recommend that the user always check , at the end of the run , the output from kk2f_finalize , the table in which the percentage of the `` spill over '' cross section corresponding to @xmath586 is given .",
    "the other advantage of the weighted events is that in most cases one needs less cpu time to get the same statistical error in the cross sections and in the histogram",

    "* the user should _ record on the tape _ the vector wtset for each event , together with wtcrud and wtmain . * in the subsequent run , to weight events from the tape , each event should be weighted with the ratio and quarks with @xmath588 where , for technical reasons we use wtmain = wtcrud*wtset(74 ) .",
    "this restriction is not important for most of practical purposes . ] wtset(i)/ wtset(203 ) , because in the standard case + wtmain = wtcrud*wtset(203 ) .",
