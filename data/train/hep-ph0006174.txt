    "supersymmetry and its boson - fermion symmetry provide an attractive framework for embedding the standard model of electroweak and strong interactions ( sm ) @xcite .",
    "the electroweak scale is understood in this framework as roughly the scale of supersymmetry breaking in the global theory and is protected , in general , from destabilization at the quantum level .",
    "in particular , softly broken @xmath4 supersymmetry provides a phenomenologically successful extension of the sm @xcite .",
    "the particle content is the minimal one required by the boson - fermion symmetry and , regardless of the exact details of the soft supersymmetry breaking ( ssb ) spectrum parameters , the corresponding @xmath5-functions predict gauge coupling unification at a scale of @xmath6 gev @xcite .",
    "the theory tends to decouple from most electroweak observables ( for sparticles of @xmath7 gev ) @xcite while the absence of flavor changing neutral currents is a source of information about the high - energy origins of the low - energy effective theory . at high energies ,",
    "the rigid supersymmetry can be extended to supergravity @xcite : the first step towards gravity - gauge unification and further embedding of the sm in a theory of quantum gravity of which supergravity is the sub - planckian limit , for example , superstring theory .",
    "however , there exists a tension between a `` bottom - up '' approach , which beginning with the sm motivates its @xmath4 supersymmetry extension , and a `` top - down '' approach , which beginning with a superstring theory often suggests that an extended @xmath1 supersymmetry is broken at some energy directly to @xmath8 @xcite .",
    "if supersymmetry is to stabilize the weak scale and resolve the hierarchy problem associated with its instability in the sm , then the extended supersymmetry can be broken in this case only near that scale . indeed ,",
    "current knowledge of string theory is far from sufficient for understanding its electroweak - scale limit or how the sm would be embedded in such a theory , and therefore it is premature to draw conclusions from string theory regarding the nature of the weak - scale supersymmetry .",
    "nevertheless , it is an intriguing and highly interesting question to ask whether an @xmath1 supersymmetry extension of the sm at weak - scale energies is phenomenologically viable , what constraints the infra - red sm limit imposes on ultra - violet realizations of such a theory , and what would be its signatures . here , as a first step towards addressing these questions",
    ", we will investigate some of their more fundamental aspects , laying the foundation for , and hopefully intriguing , further discussion .",
    "the phenomenology of @xmath2 supersymmetry and its extended spectrum were studied over the years by only a couple of groups @xcite .",
    "its `` ultra - violet '' elegance stemming from its constrained structure ( for example , there is only one coupling in the theory , the gauge coupling , and the theory is not renormalized beyond one loop ) does not translate to an equivalent elegance in the infra - red . on the contrary ,",
    "the @xmath2 intrinsic constraints make it difficult to reconcile the framework with the sm and with observations .",
    "most notably , the theory does not contain chiral yukawa couplings or any other source of chiral mass generation .",
    "once supersymmetry is broken the fermion mass issue can be resolved .",
    "however , one then finds that the @xmath2 theory does not decouple from electroweak observables ( nor does it suggest gauge unification ) .",
    "these issues place strong constraints on the properties of the extended spectrum that @xmath2 supersymmetry predicts .",
    "theories with two supersymmetries contain a rich spectrum : while each sm fermion ( boson ) is accompanied by a boson ( fermion ) superpartner to form a chiral or a vector superfield in the @xmath4 extension , each chiral @xmath4 superfield is further accompanied by an anti - chiral superfield to form a vector - like hypermultiplet in the @xmath1 extension .",
    "an @xmath4 vector superfield is accompanied in the @xmath1 extension by an @xmath9 chiral superfield in the appropriate representation , the _ mirror _ gauge superfield .",
    "for example , a sm quark is partnered , in addition to the squark , also with a _ mirror _ quark and a _ mirror _ squark .",
    "the gauge boson is partnered not only with the gaugino but also with a complex scalar and additional majorana fermion in the adjoint representation ( or singlets in the abelian case ) .",
    "the number of particles is increased four times with respect to the sm ! in describing the extended spectrum we used the @xmath9 superfield language .",
    "indeed , it is possible ( and we will do so ) to formulate the @xmath2 framework in this language . in order to impose the additional @xmath2 constraints one has to specify a set of global @xmath10 symmetries .",
    "it includes a vectorial @xmath11 exchange @xmath10-symmetry which forbids , as mentioned above , any chiral fermion yukawa or mass terms .",
    "once the vectorial symmetry is broken , all chiral and anti - chiral fermion masses are proportional to the higgs vacuum expectation values ( vevs ) which spontaneously break the sm @xmath12 .",
    "one expects that the new particles are entangled with the ordinary sm fields , as the gauge symmetries do not forbid their mixing .",
    "this again provides an important set of constraints on the theory and on the dynamics that breaks it .",
    "it also provides clear tests of the framework .",
    "most importantly , unlike a @xmath0 theory that must be discovered via its somewhat arbitrary predictions for the spectrum of new bosons and majorana fermions , an @xmath1 theory would be readily discovered or excluded in the next generation of hadron collider via its strongly constrained predictions of the mirror ( anti - chiral ) fermion spectrum , which is not expected to be much heavier than the top quark .",
    "henceforth , a study of the @xmath2 framework is timely and well motivated .",
    "the knowledgeable reader may be questioning the validity of any such an extension which contains contributions of three anti - chiral families to the oblique @xmath13 parameter @xcite ( which measures quantum corrections from new physics to @xmath14 mixing ) .",
    "usually , one assumes that mass - dependent terms are negligible , as is appropriate in the decoupling limit @xmath15 . in that case , the mass - independent contribution of each chiral or anti - chiral generation to @xmath13 is positive , contrary to current measurements which imply @xmath16 @xcite .",
    "therefore , one may argue that @xmath13 excludes extra ( anti-)chiral families . however , the @xmath2 spectrum is far too rich and complicated to allow for such arguments .",
    "current data does not exclude ( though it does not suggest ) three anti - chiral families if the spectrum of the @xmath2 mirror fermions breaks the custodial @xmath17 symmetry of the electroweak interactions and is ( at least partially ) `` light '' @xcite .",
    "the situation is even more arbitrary if the majorana fermion spectrum , which also contains custodial @xmath17 breaking mass terms , is considered @xcite .",
    "we therefore proceed and investigate @xmath1 models , further discussing this and other phenomenological issues in a dedicated section .",
    "our main focus , however , is establishing tools for the construction of the chiral fermion spectrum below the @xmath1 breaking scale .",
    "the fermion mass problems in these models has many facets .",
    "first and foremost , the generation of any chiral spectrum must be a result of supersymmetry breaking .",
    "secondly , the two sectors have to be distinguished with sufficiently heavy mirror fermions and ( relatively ) light ordinary fermions , with any mixing between the two sectors suppressed , at least in the case of the first two families . in addition there are the issues of the heavy third family and of the very light neutrinos in the ordinary sector , and subsequently , of flavor symmetries and their relation to supersymmtry breaking . in order to address these issues we choose to formulate a global @xmath18 theory as an @xmath4 theory with a second supersymmetry manifest only through global @xmath10-symmetries which are imposed on the @xmath4 description .",
    "( for example , the @xmath11 mentioned above . )",
    "this is a standard procedure @xcite that allows , in our case , the usage of the @xmath4 spurion formalism @xcite in the construction of the fermion spectrum .",
    "specifically , we assume below that    * the matter content is that of the minimally extended @xmath2 supersymmetric sm ( mn2ssm ) ( and that of a flavor sector , if exists ) given in terms of @xmath9 chiral and vector superfields . *",
    "the @xmath2 imposed global symmetries ( or a subset thereof ) are explicitly broken by non - renormalizable terms in the kahler potential .",
    "these terms are characterized by a scale @xmath19 . in the limit",
    "@xmath20 the full supersymmetry is restored .",
    "* the only vevs are ( @xmath21 breaking ) @xmath22-type vevs which generate all dimensionful and dimensionless couplings in the electroweak theory ( aside from the gauge coupling ) .",
    "electroweak symmetry breaking vevs ( and flavor symmetry breaking vevs ) are then induced in the resulting effective theory .",
    "* to the most part we will also assume that some flavor and `` mirror '' symmetries , which do not commute with the @xmath2 @xmath10-symmetries , are conserved in the resulting effective theory .",
    "we will explore the chiral fermion spectrum within this framework and establish phenomenologically viable low - energy limits of the @xmath2 framework which could be probed , given the fermion spectrum , in the near future .",
    "we briefly review @xmath1 supersymmetry in section  [ sec : theory ] . though we do not focus on the boson spectrum and the dimensionful ssb parameters , they are straightforward to write in the @xmath9 formalism .",
    "this will be done as a warm - up exercise in section  [ sec : soft ] ( and again , using the spurion formalism , in section  [ sec : tree ] ) .",
    "the softly broken @xmath1 model will be compared to its @xmath0 equivalent . in section  [ sec : loop ]",
    "we consider the possibility of breaking the chiral symmetries primarily in the ssb scalar potential , generating the fermion spectrum only radiatively @xcite . while this option is viable in some cases for the sm spectrum , it can not provide a consistent mirror fermion spectrum . in section  [ sec",
    ": hard ] we exploit the @xmath4 spurion formalism to classify the most general supersymmetry breaking framework , and in section  [ sec : tree ] we use it to discuss a general @xmath2 framework and the possible tree - level origins of the chiral fermion spectrum .",
    "we find that certain kahler operators can generate such a spectrum as long as the supersymmtries are broken at relatively low - energies , which we will assume .",
    "( note that large parts of our discussion are applicable to low - energy @xmath4 supersymmetry breaking as well . )",
    "the special issue of the heavy sm third family fermions is addressed in section  [ sec : mixing ] . in section  [ sec : neutrino ] we comment on neutrino physics within the context of @xmath2 supersymmetry .",
    "direct and indirect signatures and other phenomenological issues are discussed in section  [ sec : pheno ] . unlike @xmath9 supersymmetry",
    ", @xmath18 can not escape detection in the next generation of hadron colliders !",
    "we conclude with a summary , an outlook , and a comparison to previous constructions , in section  [ sec : conclusions ] .",
    "the n=2 supersymmetry algebra has two spinorial generators @xmath23 , @xmath24 , satisfying @xmath25 where @xmath26 are , as usual , the pauli matrices and @xmath27 is the momentum .",
    "the supercharges @xmath28 form a doublet of the ( exchange ) @xmath11 @xmath10-symmetry , which must be imposed when using the @xmath9 formulation to describe a @xmath2 theory .",
    "the lowest @xmath18 spin representations , which are the relevant ones for embedding the sm , are the hypermultiplet and vector multiplet . written in the familiar @xmath9 language , the hypermultiplet is composed of two @xmath9 chiral multiplets @xmath29 and @xmath30 , with @xmath31 occupying representations @xmath32 of the gauge groups which are conjugate to that of @xmath33 , @xmath34 .",
    "schematically , the hypermultiplet is described by a `` diamond '' plot    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]",
    "in our discussion so far we distinguished ordinary from mirror matter , but did not distinguish , for example , light and heavy sm ( ordinary ) fermions .",
    "that is , if one of the mechanisms to render ordinary fermions light relative to the mirror fermion is realized , then _ all _ of the ordinary fermions will be light with masses of roughly the same order of magnitude .",
    "however , the sm fermion spectrum contains two special cases : the first case is that of the top quark ( or for that matter , of all of the third family ) whose mass is of the order of the mirror fermion masses .",
    "the second case is that of the nearly massless neutrinos .",
    "we postpone the discussion of the neutrinos to the next section and focus here on the case of heavy sm fermions . while in some cases",
    "internal hierarchy within the sm sector can be put in by hand , it is not always sufficient .",
    "for example , if the sm fermion mass is generated radiatively , vacuum stability constraints make it very unlikely that the top ( @xmath35 ) in the quark ( lepton ) sector receives its mass radiatively ( with a large trilinear parameter put in by hand )",
    ". this would require hard quartic couplings of order @xmath36 .",
    "an alternative tree - level mechanism may exist , particularly in the latter case .",
    "one obvious candidate for such a mechanism is mirror - symmetry breaking in the third family and consequently , mass mixing between ordinary and mirror third family fermions .",
    "as long as such mixing is constrained to only the third family , the implications to flavor changing neutral currents are generically within experimental constraints .",
    "mirror parity breaking in such a scenario is intimately linked to the flavor symmetry structure .",
    "we first discuss the phenomenology of such a mechanism , and then speculate on its possible origin from a spontaneously broken abelian flavor ( gauge ) symmetry . if one allows mpv in the third family , then there could be tree - level mixing between the fermions and their mirrors . for explicitness ,",
    "let us concentrate on the case of the top quark and its mirror with mixing terms : @xmath37 and @xmath38",
    ". for simplicity , let us further assume that the usual quark mass term @xmath39 is small and can be taken to be zero .",
    "the mirror top quark , on the other hand , has a mass term @xmath40 , which is assumed to arise at tree level and @xmath41 .",
    "( @xmath19 here is not the supersymmetry breaking scale but simply the large mass parameter in the fermion mass matrix , @xmath42 . )",
    "a similar structure holds for the bottom sector , with identical @xmath43 ( from the sm @xmath12 symmetry ) for the left - handed bottoms but with independent @xmath44 and @xmath19 parameters . defining @xmath45",
    "the mass matrix can be written as @xmath46 where @xmath47 and we neglected a pure sm top mass .",
    "( the mpv mixing may be ssb or @xmath9 supersymmetric , though here we use the ssb notation . )",
    "the mass eigenstates @xmath48 are readily found , @xmath49 here @xmath50 and @xmath51 are the unitary matrices chosen to diagonalize the mass matrix : @xmath52 the mass eigenvalues @xmath53 are @xmath54 while the mixing angles @xmath55 and @xmath56 can be written as @xmath57 the mass splitting between the ordinary and mirror quarks is a function of @xmath58 , @xmath59 and @xmath19 .",
    "two limits are of particular interest :     _ @xmath60 , @xmath59 and @xmath19 are all of the same order of magnitude : _    assume , as an example , @xmath61 . in this limit , @xmath62",
    "are of the same order of magnitude and there is large mixing between the ordinary sm quarks and their mirror partners : @xmath63 this case is relevant for the top sector .",
    "the top quark can get its large mass while the mirror top is sufficiently heavy to evade current experimental limits that may apply .",
    "_ @xmath64 the mpv mixing between the ordinary quarks and the mirror partners is much smaller than @xmath19 : _    assume , without loss of generality , @xmath65 .",
    "one has , to leading order in @xmath66 , @xmath67 the mixing angles in this limit can be similarly obtained and read @xmath68 as one expects , one of the eigenstates becomes light when one of the mass mixing is small , while the heavy mass eigenvalues is still @xmath69 .",
    "the fraction of the usual right - handed quark in the light eigenstate , @xmath70 , is always large since @xmath71 is much larger than 1 .",
    "however , the fraction of the usual left - handed quark , @xmath72 , depends on the ratio of @xmath73 .",
    "it is large when @xmath58 is much smaller than @xmath19 .",
    "alternatively , one can have large mixing between the ordinary and mirror quarks when @xmath58 and @xmath19 are of the same order .",
    "a similar situation happens when @xmath74 is of the same order of magnitude as @xmath19 while @xmath58 is much smaller .",
    "the latter limit enables one to realize simultaneously a heavy top quark mass and a few gev bottom quark mass .",
    "the parameter @xmath58 is the same for both top and bottom sector and should be of the order of @xmath75 so that the top is sufficiently heavy .",
    "however , @xmath74 and @xmath19 could be different for the two sectors .",
    "as long as @xmath76 is `` small '' , the contribution to the bottom quark mass is `` small '' .",
    "the most attractive choice is to have @xmath77 .",
    "another possibility is to take @xmath78 .",
    "this is , however , more difficult to realize since it is difficult to obtain such a large value for @xmath79 which is proportional to the higgs vev .",
    "we conclude that once mpv mixing is allowed , it is possible to realize heavy and highly mixed ordinary and mirror top quarks simultaneously with a relatively light ( and relatively non - mixed ) sm bottom quark .",
    "the question we would like to consider next is with regard to the possible mechanisms that give rise to such a mixing .",
    "various possibilities exist , for example , a `` flavored spurion '' such that @xmath80 terms are allowed in the kahler potential for @xmath81 .",
    "mirror symmetry could be viewed in this case an accidental symmetry of the first two generations or as a flavor symmetry .",
    "( note that only vector - like mixing terms are allowed by the sm gauge symmetries . ) here , however , we will present a different toy model in which mirror symmetry breaking is a result of a spontaneous breaking of a gauged flavor symmetry .",
    "assume an additional ( horizontal ) @xmath82 gauge factor .",
    "the superpotential contains , for example , the term @xmath83 , assuming that @xmath84 and @xmath85 are charged under the horizontal gauge symmetry with charge @xmath86 , and @xmath87 is the horizontal gauge coupling .",
    "@xmath88 is a gauge singlet contained in the @xmath82 @xmath18 vector multiplet .",
    "if it develops a vev @xmath89 , it would create a mixing parameter @xmath90 . in this example",
    ", the kahler potential can still preserve the mirror symmetry , which is broken spontaneously by @xmath89 .",
    "( note that the flavor symmetry itself is not broken by the @xmath89 vev . )",
    "this proposal provides a simple framework for the generation of the mixing terms employing generation - dependent @xmath91 symmetries .",
    "however , one must overcome certain difficulties before such a proposal can be realized .",
    "we outline those difficulties and the possible cures below .",
    "first , the relative size of the mixing parameter is proportional to the hypermultiplet horizontal charge .",
    "it may not be straightforward to find an anomaly - free combination that naturally produces the desired hierarchy .",
    "certain fields , however , could be singlets ( for example , @xmath92 ) .",
    "also , a combination of different @xmath19 parameters could also contribute to the hierarchy .",
    "secondly , there is the issue of the mixing of the third generation quarks with the two light generation quarks . if the third family quarks are charged under any symmetry while the light quarks and the higgs bosons are neutral , then any inter - family mixing is forbidden .",
    "this can be resolved , for example , by the introduction of a sm singlet hypermultiplet @xmath13 which is also charged under @xmath82 so that an appropriate chiral symmetry breaking term is allowed in kahler potential , e.g. , @xmath93 , which could lead to an @xmath94-term or a yukawa coupling proportional to @xmath95 and @xmath96 , respectively . in the case",
    "that only @xmath94-terms arise then the intergenerational mixing is naturally suppressed as the square of the loop factor .",
    "the @xmath13-vevs are induced by the dynamics below the supersymmetry breaking scale , e.g. , the ssb potential , and are therefore suppressed .",
    "a @xmath13-vev breaks the horizontal symmetry spontaneously and its size is constrained by the usual considerations related to the presence of an extra neutral @xmath97 gauge boson @xcite .",
    "lastly , consider the operators @xmath98 , @xmath99 etc .",
    "while the former operator can be forbidden by the @xmath10-symmetry , the latter is allowed by the symmetries .",
    "if such operators arise they could lead to ordinary - mirror matter mixing in all three generations .",
    "the supersymmetry dynamics must therefore be constrained not to generate such vector - hypermultiplet mixed operators .",
    "the proposed toy model serves to illustrate that the flavor symmetry may be intimately linked to the details of the breaking of supersymmetry and of the global symmetries it induces .",
    "in particular , the heaviness of the third family may stem from the heaviness of the mirror fermions , in which case either mirror symmetry plays the role of a flavor symmetry or the flavor symmetry breaks the mirror symmetry .",
    "recent results from the atmospheric and solar neutrino oscillation experiments indicates non - zero neutrino masses , although extremely small with respect to the charged leptons @xcite .",
    "the mass squared difference between two neutrino mass eigenstates is of the order of @xmath100 from atmospheric neutrino oscillation data ( and @xmath101 for solar neutrinos ) .",
    "the smallness of neutrino masses can be explained most simply by the see - saw mechanism@xcite , where a right - handed sterile neutrino @xmath102 with a majorana mass @xmath19 is introduced .",
    "( again , @xmath19 here is the large mass parameter in the fermion mass matrix , @xmath103 . ) assuming a dirac mass @xmath104 , and that there is no majorana mass for the left - handed neutrinos , the light mass eigenvalue is @xmath105 . for @xmath106 of the order of the electroweak scale ,",
    "the tiny neutrino masses can be obtained if @xmath107 gev is of the order of the unification scale .    the extended neutrino sector in the mn2ssm is strongly constrained by experiment .",
    "there are six active neutrinos , the three ordinary neutrinos @xmath108 and their mirror partners @xmath109 , all of which couple to the electroweak gauge bosons .",
    "given the constraints from the invisible @xmath110-boson width on the number of active neutrinos in @xmath110 decays , @xmath111 @xcite , the mirror neutrinos can not be light : any additional active neutrinos such as @xmath109 must be heavier than @xmath112 .",
    "( if there are additional sterile neutrinos , there could be more than three light active neutrinos as the coupling @xmath113 , @xmath114 being the mass eigenstate , is suppressed by mixing angles .",
    "nevertheless , we assume only three light active neutrinos . ) as an obvious consequence from the last statement , the observed neutrino oscillations can not be explained by @xmath115 and must occur among the ordinary neutrinos . in the following",
    ", we will only address the question of obtaining the small ordinary neutrino masses while keeping the mirror neutrinos heavy .",
    "the mixing between the light neutrino mass eigenstates and an explanation of the oscillation data require a more careful model building ( for example , the generational structure of the matrices discussed below needs to be addressed ) , which is left to future studies .",
    "we therefore discuss only one generation of neutrinos .",
    "clearly , the see - saw mechanism described above does not generalize to @xmath2 supersymmetry : if the small neutrino mass is generated by the usual seesaw mechanism , the sterile neutrino must be heavy , with its mass above the @xmath2 breaking scale . the mirror sterile neutrino must have the same mass because the exchange symmetry is a good symmetry above the @xmath2 breaking scale .",
    "the mirror neutrino masses are then also suppressed by the see - saw mechanism , @xmath116 , which is below experimental bounds .",
    "therefore , the majorana mass for the sterile neutrino can not be much larger than the @xmath2 breaking scale , which in the framework of @xmath117 see - saw leads to heavy neutrinos ( unless the yukawa couplings are fine - tuned ) .",
    "( we note in passing , that if the three right - handed neutrinos remain as light as the the left - handed neutrinos , one can explore an explanation of the oscillation data involving also @xmath118 transitions . )",
    "if mirror parity is conserved , there is no mixing between the usual and mirror neutrinos .",
    "the mass matrix is reduced to two diagonal blocks for the usual and mirror sectors .",
    "once sterile neutrinos are introduced the mirror neutrino mass can be generated via effective tree level yukawa coupling as for the other mirror fermions .",
    "the ordinary neutrino mass , on the other hand , can not be generated radiatively since the right - handed neutrino is a gauge singlet .",
    "common techniques like the radiative generation of neutrino masses via the introduction of a charged @xmath17-singlet and a second higgs doublet , or tree - level neutrino mass by a higgs triplet@xcite may be exploited to give the small neutrino masses , particularly since such fields are available in the spectrum .",
    "( one could also introduce by hand tiny tree - level effective yukawa couplings for the neutrinos or extend the sm group as discussed in section [ sec : loop ] . ) here , we will explore a different source of neutrino masses in @xmath2 scenarios , a @xmath119 see - saw mechanism which is induced by a small breaking of the mirror parity . with only the minimal spectrum ( no sterile neutrinos ) but with mpv mixing between the usual and mirror neutrinos @xmath120 ,",
    "the neutrino mass matrix is given by @xmath121 in the basis of @xmath122 .",
    "in this simplest framework one has two degenerate mass eigenstates and no mass hierarchy between the mass eigenstates can be generated .",
    "let us then consider a more general @xmath2 neutrino sector .",
    "( for simplicity , we only consider one generation . )",
    "consider    * two sterile neutrino superfields , @xmath123 and its mirror partner @xmath124 , with masses @xmath125 and @xmath126 , respectively .",
    "( we omit hereafter the @xmath10 index . )",

    "* dirac - type mixing @xmath131 , @xmath132 .    under these assumptions",
    "the @xmath133 neutrino mass matrix reads @xmath134 however , it is simplified under a well - motivated set of assumptions which we consider for the purpose of illustration :    * there is no dirac mass in the usual neutrino sector , @xmath135 .",
    "this is true , for example , if the ordinary sector fermion masses originate from radiative corrections .",
    "* there is no mixing between the sterile neutrinos @xmath123 and @xmath124 , @xmath136 .",
    "this is the case if the mixing arises from the vev of some mirror @xmath91 gauge boson singlet @xmath137 , while @xmath123 and @xmath124 are singlets under @xmath138 .",
    "* there is no dirac - type mixing , @xmath139 . assuming that higgs couplings preserve mirror parity",
    ", those terms could only arise from yukawa terms in the kahler potential involving the superfield combinations @xmath140 , @xmath141 and @xmath142 , @xmath143 , once the mirror higgs bosons acquire vevs .",
    "however , we assume that ewsb is induced only by the ordinary mssm higgs doublets , so @xmath144 and such yukawa terms do not generate mixing .",
    "the usual sterile neutrino now decouples , and one is left with a @xmath119 mass matrix with only three parameters : @xmath145    in the relevant limit one has @xmath146",
    ", i.e. , the mpv parameter @xmath147 is small and the dirac mass for the mirror neutrinos , @xmath148 , is small with respect to sterile neutrino mass @xmath126 which is of the order of the @xmath2 breaking scale .",
    "the mass eigenvalues in this limit are approximately @xmath149 the smallness of the lightest neutrino masses can be controlled by the small mpv parameter @xmath150 , while the second lightest neutrino remains heavy as long as @xmath151 is not too small .",
    "it is , however , in the mass range implied by electroweak data ( see the next section ) and a candidate for the lmp .",
    "notice that @xmath126 can not be too large or the mirror neutrino mass would be suppressed below the experimental lower limit . as an example , taking @xmath152 gev , @xmath153 gev and @xmath154 gev , the neutrino masses read : @xmath155 this model is a variation of the see - saw mechanism where the small mirror parity violating parameter @xmath150 plays the role of the usual dirac masses . in conclusion , the neutrino sector in @xmath2 supersymmetry is strongly constrained as one needs to not only generate the small neutrino masses to fit the neutrino oscillation data , but also to maintain a large mass hierarchy between the ordinary and mirror sectors . here",
    ", we presented a simple model for the @xmath2 neutrino sector which relies on small mpv .",
    "the model is successful though it is far from unique and other possibilities need to be explored .",
    "given its extended spectrum , the phenomenology of the mn2ssm is particularly rich .",
    "its effects are both indirect ( electroweak physics ) and direct ( collider phenomenology and new particle searches ) .",
    "although many predictions depend on the details of the model , important conclusions can be drawn based only on the general structure of the @xmath2 framework .",
    "while some of the mn2ssm characteristics only provide a variation on the phenomenology of the @xmath9 mssm , many other features are unique to @xmath2 , and provide the smoking gun signals for the discovery of @xmath2 supersymmetry . in this section we review some of the more interesting aspects , both indirect and direct , of @xmath2 supersymmetry .      as mentioned in the introduction , additional chiral quarks and leptons can lead to large positive contribution to the oblique parameter @xmath13 @xcite , which is phenomenologically unfavorable , if not excluded @xcite .",
    "however , the well known result that each new fermion generation leads to @xmath156 contribution to @xmath13 @xcite holds only if the extra generation is degenerate in mass with @xmath157 . in the case of @xmath2 and the mn2ssm ,",
    "the masses of the mirror matter fermions are related to the ewsb higgs vevs , and so @xmath158 .",
    "furthermore , the origin of its mass is similar to that of the ordinary fermions ( supersymmetry breaking operators in the kahler potential ) and there is no reason to assume degeneracy . as shown in ref .",
    "@xcite , electroweak precision data can accommodate extra generations if there exist heavy ( active ) neutrinos with masses close to 50 gev ( while their charged @xmath12 partners are with masses slightly above @xmath159 gev ) .",
    "this is because mass dependent terms become important once the fermions are relatively light and their non - degenerate spectrum breaks the custodial @xmath17 symmetry of the electroweak interactions .",
    "this scenario can be naturally fulfilled in the mn2ssm : an example of a mirror neutrino in this mass range was given in the previous section .",
    "in addition , ref .",
    "@xcite has also found that extra generations may be accommodated if charginos and neutralinos have masses close to 60 gev .",
    "this is an example of negative contributions to @xmath13 from custodial @xmath17 breaking majorana masses @xcite . in @xmath2",
    "such majorana masses arise naturally , for example , there are mixing terms between the mirror higgsino doublets and @xmath160 .",
    "this again can lead to a negative or vanishing value of @xmath13 .",
    ", as suggested in section  [ sec : mixing ] , can also contribute negatively to @xmath13 , depending on the mixing between the extra gauge boson @xmath161 and the ordinary @xmath110 @xcite . ]",
    "we conclude that while consistent , the @xmath13 parameter places probably the strongest constraints on the mn2ssm .",
    "it requires some relatively light mirror particles , for example , some combination of relatively light mirror neutrinos and mirror higgsinos .",
    "a dedicated electroweak analysis including all mirror particles is well motivated .",
    "another issue of importance to electroweak physics is the mass of the higgs boson . the mn2ssm higgs sector is not as constrained as in the mssm or other @xmath9 frameworks .",
    "the number of higgs doublets participating in ewsb could vary , in principle , between one to four .",
    "anomaly cancellation requirement of an even number of higgs superfields is automatically satisfied in @xmath2 for any number of higgs hypermultiplets .",
    "the @xmath9 requirement of at least two higgs superfields with opposite hypercharge acquiring vevs ( from fermion mass generation ) is relaxed in the framework of low - energy supersymmetry breaking and the mn2ssm due to the appearance of non - holomorphic yukawa terms .",
    "therefore , there could be , in principle , only one higgs hypermultiplet with only the higgs , not its mirror , acquiring a vev . ] here we assume two , @xmath162 and @xmath163 , as in the mssm . even within this mssm - like framework of two higgs doublets participating in ewsb",
    ", there is no upper bound on the mass of lightest higgs boson .",
    "this is because tree - level higgs quartic couplings @xmath164 arise not only from supersymmetric terms @xmath165 as in @xmath9 , but also from hard supersymmetry breaking operators in the kahler potential @xmath166 .",
    "( see section  [ sec : hard ] . ) consequently , the minimization of the higgs potential leads to a modified formula for relating @xmath167 , @xmath168 , @xmath169 , and @xmath170 , as in eq .",
    "( [ minimization ] ) .",
    "more importantly , because of its dependence on the arbitrary hard couplings @xmath171 , the tree - level light higgs mass @xmath172 is not bound from above by @xmath173 ( or by @xmath174 gev at loop order ) as in the mssm .",
    "this observation is not unique to @xmath2 but rather to theories with low - energy supersymmetry breaking where @xmath175 is possible .",
    "it carries important implications for defining theoretically motivated mass range for future higgs searches .",
    "another indirect implications arise from the fact that the ordinary quark and lepton masses ( except the third generation ) may arise radiatively , which by itself has interesting consequences @xcite .",
    "a general feature in theories with radiative fermion masses is that the anomalous magnetic moments are not suppressed by a loop factor relative to the respective fermion mass : @xmath176 , where @xmath177 is the mass of the heavy particles running in the loop .",
    "this has particular relevance in the case of the muon whose magnetic moment is well measured and further improvement in its measurement is expected in the near future @xcite , allowing for such effects to be observed @xcite .",
    "the light mirror fermions , the possibility of hard yukawa and quartic couplings as well as of radiative yukawa couplings , and the large number of new degrees of freedom , all imply that the mn2ssm interacts with the sm and electroweak physics more strongly than the mssm and leads to quite different predictions for various observables .",
    "the experimental limits on the extra heavy quarks and leptons are based on searches for the fourth generation at @xmath178 and @xmath179 colliders : @xmath180 gev , @xmath181 gev , and @xmath182 gev @xcite .",
    "these lower mass bounds may or may not apply to the @xmath2 mirror quarks and leptons , as they depend on the decay modes of the heavy fermions",
    ". nevertheless , such limits are easily satisfied for @xmath183 , corresponding to effective tree level yukawa couplings for the mirror fermions of the order of unity . on the other hand ,",
    "the mirror fermion masses are proportional to the ewsb higgs vev and therefore can not be much larger than the electroweak scale @xmath184 gev .",
    "( in addition , the oblique @xmath13 parameter also constraints some of the masses from above . )",
    "this upper bound ensures that mirror fermions can be copiously produced at any machine that produces a large number of top pairs : the tevatron , cern s large hadron collider ( lhc ) and future lepton colliders .",
    "the mn2ssm and the @xmath2 framework can be confirmed or excluded shortly after the next energy frontier is reached .",
    "the experimental signals largely depend on whether the mirror parity @xmath185 and/or the usual @xmath10-parity @xmath186 are broken below the @xmath2 breaking scale . given both parities",
    ", there are three special particles that play an important role in determining the phenomenology : the lightest @xmath186-odd ( supersymmetric ) particle ( lsp ) , the lightest @xmath185-odd ( mirror ) particle ( lmp ) , and the lightest mirror supersymmetric particle ( lmsp ) , which is odd under both parities .",
    "the lmsp could be the lsp , the lmp , both or neither one .",
    "if both parities are preserved , the lsp and lmp are stable . in addition",
    ", there could also be a third stable particle whose decay into the lsp and lmp is kinematically forbidden .",
    "( for example , this could be the lmsp if it is not the lmp or the lsp and it is not heavy enough to decay into them . )",
    "a stable charged ( electromagnetic or color ) particle is excluded up to @xmath187 cosmologically from failure of terrestrial searches for anomalously - heavy isotopes of various elements @xcite .",
    "the only possible massive stable particles are therefore the mirror neutrinos ; sneutrinos and mirror sneutrinos ; the higgsinos , mirror higgsinos and mirror higgs ; @xmath188 and @xmath189 ; and @xmath190 and @xmath191 ( where we rotated the electroweak group to its sm basis ) .",
    "note that even if the lsp is not stable due to the broken @xmath186 ( rpv ) , there could still exist a stable neutral lmp , which could be the candidate for dark matter .",
    "particle decays in the mn2ssm can be classified as follows .",

    "a possible decay chain of stop is : @xmath216 , if it is kinematically allowed .",
    "( intermediate steps could be on- or off - shell . )",
    "the final state contains in this case a @xmath217-jet , a charged lepton , and missing energy .",
    "alternatively , it could decay via a trilinear coupling : @xmath218 leading to a similar final state @xmath219 .",
    "the neutrinos and the neutral lmps and lsps all lead in this case to a missing energy signal , as in the usual @xmath9 mssm case .",
    "since the masses of the mirror ( matter ) fermions are related to the electroweak symmetry breaking scale and would be at most a couple hundred gev , they are most likely to be the first mirror particles to be produced at the colliders and are candidates for the lmp .",
    "the mirror quarks particularly deserve attention .",
    "they can be copiously pair produced at the lhc and the tevatron via gluon fusion .",
    "if a mirror neutrino is the lmp and all the superparticles are heavier , each mirror quark can either decay through an on - shell electroweak mirror gauge boson : @xmath220 , where @xmath221 if kinematically allowed ; or it directly decays into @xmath222 through an off - shell process .",
    "a typical event has to two energetic jets ( two charged leptons , in some cases ) and a missing energy .",

    "if the lmp decays outside the detector , it appears in the detector as a stable particle .",
    "consider a mirror fermion as the ( meta - stable ) lmp .",
    "a neutrino ( or any other neutral ) lmp leads in this case as well to a missing energy signal .",
    "mirror charged lepton lmps leave a track in the central tracking chamber and hit the muon chamber , with less activity in the calorimeters .",
    "a muon and a mirror charged lepton can be distinguished by the ionization rate @xmath223 since the mirror particle is much heavier .",
    "if a mirror quark is the lmp and stable inside the detector , it will form a quarkonium or combine with the ordinary quarks to form a mirror hadron .",
    "such states will lead to hadron showers in the hadron calorimeters , and can be distinguish from a regular hadron shower by the wider shower opening angle @xcite . if a mirror gauge boson is the lmp ( and stable in the detector ) the signals will be similar to those mentioned above , depending on whether it is neutral , charged and/or carrying color .",
    "if the lmp decays inside the detector , the heavy mirror particle can decay into jets , leptons , or lighter supersymmetric particles .",
    "a missing energy signal is still possible if the usual @xmath10-parity is exact .",
    "otherwise , the signal mimics those of the sm heavy fourth family quarks and leptons and of the rpv mssm .",
    "we conclude that once the center of mass energy of the future colliders is sufficient to produce the mirror fermions , they can hardly escape detection .",
    "since future colliders will effectively provide top factories , sufficient energies will be reached , providing an ideal environment for searching for the @xmath2 mirror quarks ( which can not be much heavier than the top quark ) .",
    "higgs production is also affected by the mn2ssm spectrum .",
    "the existence of extra heavy mirror quarks can greatly enhance the single - higgs production rate in hadron colliders through gluon and quark fusions , since the effective yukawa coupling is of the order of unity .",

    "@xcite argued that one generation of mirror heavy quarks can increase the higgs production cross section for @xmath224 by a factor of six to nine . in ref .",
    "@xcite the contributions of large yukawa couplings to associate higgs production was shown for the case of large @xmath169 and of rpv .",
    "in addition , decay channels of ( a sufficiently heavy ) higgs to mirror fermions are also expected to be important .",
    "lastly , if there are radiative yukawa couplings , they also affect higgs phenomenology and create misalignment between on - shell and mass ( @xmath229 ) yukawa couplings of the higgs @xcite .",
    "the sparticle phenomenology is also richer than in the mssm .",
    "for example , consider the ( eight majorana ) neutralinos and ( four dirac ) charginos .",
    "if the mirror parity is unbroken , there are two diagonal blocks in the neutralino / chargino mass matrices , each of which is an analogue of the usual @xmath9 case .",
    "the @xmath185-even neutralino block could provide the lsp while that odd block could provide the lmsp ( that may or may not be the lmp and/or lsp ) .",
    "each sector could decay , however , to particles in the other sector via @xmath185 conserving couplings such as @xmath230 .",
    "if mirror parity is violated then there are off - diagonal mixing terms between the ordinary and the mirror higgsinos and gauginos , which lead to complicated mixing patterns .",
    "similarly , the mixing patterns of squarks and sleptons are also complicated in the presence of mpv terms , while new production and decay channels ( and complicated cascades ) are open whether @xmath185 is conserved or violated .",
    "in this paper we have formulated a low - energy @xmath2 supersymmetric framework in which @xmath2 supersymmetry is preserved down to tev energies .",
    "the minimal @xmath2 realization of the sm , the mn2ssm , was presented and its properties studied .",
    "while from the low - energy point of view the models do not have a clear added benefit in comparison to the @xmath9 mssm to justify the extended spectrum , it is ultra - violet constructions that suggest the possibility of @xmath231 supersymmetry breaking @xcite . therefore , it is important to examine the viability of such a scenario , address the issues it raises ( particularly its non - chiral nature ) , and investigate its signatures . the next generation of hadron collider , in which top pairs will be produced in abundance , is ideal to test the @xmath2 framework via its mirror quark sector , adding urgency to such an investigation . to conclude , we review the main issues studied in this paper , comment on some other issues such as unification and cosmology , compare our framework to previous proposals , and propose further avenues for investigation of the @xmath2 framework .",
    "@xmath2 supersymmetry was assumed in this work to break to @xmath232 at low - energies .",
    "we chose , however , to formulate it as an @xmath9 theory , constrained by a set of global @xmath10 symmetries which preserve the @xmath2 structure .",
    "the spectrum is that given by embedding the sm in @xmath2 hyper and vector multiplets , but it was written in terms of their @xmath9 superfield components .",
    "the minimal embedding corresponds to the mn2ssm : each mssm superfield is accompanied by a _ mirror _",
    "superfield in the conjugate gauge representation .",
    "the @xmath2 symmetries , in turn , constrain the superpotential describing these superfield component interactions .",
    "in particular , an exchange symmetry between a particle and its mirror and an abelian @xmath10 symmetry imply that the superpotential does not contain chiral yukawa terms and mass terms , respectively .",
    "( note that theory considered is a global @xmath2 described in the @xmath9 language , i.e. , gravity was not introduced . )",
    "the @xmath9 language allows one to use the spurion formalism and supersymmetry breaking is parameterized by two independent parameters , the spurion auxiliary @xmath22-vev and a mass parameter @xmath19 which suppresses explicit breaking of the global symmetries in the kahler potential , with @xmath233 . if supersymmetry is to play a role in resolution of the sm hierarchy problem then @xmath234 .",
    "hence , supersymmetry is broken at low energy and one has to consider all operators to order @xmath235 in the kahler potential . the effective theory below the supersymmetry breaking scale contains various quartic and yukawa terms and the @xmath2 and @xmath9 relations between couplings",
    "are broken . even though such breaking is hard",
    ", it does not destabilize the theory but only affects the calculability of dimensionful parameters . below the supersymmetry breaking scale ,",
    "some of the @xmath2 global symmetries may be preserved and could distinguish the sm matter from its mirror .",
    "in addition , parity symmetries , which do not commute with supersymmetry , may be admitted by the supersymmetry breaking mechanism .",
    "@xmath10-parity and mirror parity were used to define sparticles ( as in the mssm ) and mirror particles , respectively .",
    "if preserved , each parity corresponds to a stable neutral particle , the lsp and lmp , respectively .",
    "the explicit supersymmetry breaking terms in the kahler potential must also break the vectorial symmetries imposed by the @xmath2 global @xmath10-symmetries so that chiral yukawa couplings can be generated .",
    "this can be done by @xmath9 preserving , softly breaking , or hard breaking tree - level operators @xmath236 , @xmath237 it can also be achieved by first breaking the symmetries by trilinear terms in the scalar potential and generating the yukawa terms at one loop .",
    "the latter leads to @xmath238(gev ) quark masses while the former , in principle , could lead to dangerous mixing between the sm fermions and their mirrors .",
    "however , by invoking the global ( @xmath10 ) symmetries , one can distinguish between operators which generate the sm fermion masses from those generating the mirror spectrum so that the former is proportional to suppressed yukawa couplings or given by loop corrections while the latter is given by @xmath239 yukawa couplings .",
    "in particular , a large mass hierarchy between the sm fermions and the mirror fermions can be achieved and the mixing between the sectors can be suppressed or ( if mirror parity is exact ) even forbidden .",
    "the sm fermion spectrum is controlled , as usual , by small yukawa couplings while the mirror fermion spectrum is constrained from above by the electroweak scale @xmath240 .",
    "the heavy sm third family ( especially the top quark ) is an exception as its mass range is closer to that of the mirror fermions than to that of the lighter sm generations .",
    "though such an hierarchy can be imposed by hand , here we considered the possibility that a mirror symmetry also plays the role of a sm flavor symmetry , allowing for mirror parity violating mixing in the third family .",
    "the heavy top quark is then explained by the heaviness of the third generation mirror top . a toy model with an abelian flavor symmetry",
    "was given along these lines .",
    "a very small violation of mirror parity may also play a role in the smallness of neutrino masses .",
    "we suggested that the small neutrino masses can arise from a variation on the see - saw mechanism where the sm neutrino mass which is controlled by the small mixing parameter between the ordinary and mirror neutrinos .",
    "the mirror neutrinos must be heavier than @xmath112 , as required by the invisible @xmath110-width , but could explain the smallness of the oblique parameter @xmath13 if they are not much heavier than that .",
    "this in fact occurs in the same framework as the second eigenvalue is given by @xmath241 .",
    "the contributions to the oblique @xmath13-parameter from the extra three chiral generations provides a strong constraint on the mn2ssm .",
    "in particular , it implies that the mirror fermions can not be degenerate in mass and can not ( all ) be too heavy , for example , the mirror neutrino may be relatively light .",
    "in addition , it also suggests light neutralinos and mirror neutralinos ( with significant custodial symmetry breaking mixing )",
    ". a dedicated fit to electroweak data in the mn2ssm framework is necessary , but is beyond the scope of this work . on the other hand , due to the low - energy supersymmetry",
    "breaking , the higgs mass is not constrained from above as in the mssm since its mass could be proportional to an arbitrary quartic couplings .",
    "the higgs sector could contain two or four doublets , any number of which could participate in supersymmetry breaking . choosing the mssm limit of two ordinary higgs doublets acquiring vevs , we find a higgs potential which is more similar to that of a generic two - higgs doublet model than to the mssm .",
    "the spectrum of new particles is very rich , and contain three new sectors ( sparticles , mirror matter , mirror sparticles ) which do not mix with each other , and two ( in some cases even three ) stable particles . if either @xmath10 or mirror parity is broken , mixing is introduced and the number of stable neutral particles is reduced respectively .",
    "the most obvious candidates for discovery are the relatively light @xmath242 gev mirror quarks , while any stable particles are likely to correspond to missing energy .",
    "the extra generations of mirror quarks and leptons at the electroweak scale provide the smoking gun for testing the @xmath2 framework at the lhc and the tevatron .",
    "typical events consist of jets @xmath243 leptons @xmath243 missing ( transverse ) energy .",
    "the missing energy is generally greater than in the @xmath9 supersymmetry `` events '' , as the final states could includes two or more neutral heavy stable particles .",
    "( if mirror parity is slightly violated , there still is a stable particle as in the usual @xmath9 case , as long as @xmath10-parity is preserved , and vice versa . ) detail studies of the collider phenomenology of low energy @xmath2 theories is also called upon , but clearly , it would be difficult for @xmath2 to escape discovery if realized at tev energies .",
    "we note that aside from direct searches for mirror particles , extra generations of heavy quarks could greatly increase the higgs production at hadron colliders via gluon fusion , both single production and production in association with quarks are , in principle , enhanced .",
    "therefore , an enhanced higgs production cross section in hadron colliders could be a hint for the existence of extra mirror matters .",
    "in addition , if the sm yukawa couplings are radiative , it carries strong implications to higgs physics , such as misalignment of mass and on - shell yukawa couplings , as well as to low - energy observables such as an enhancement by an inverse loop factor of the anomalous muon magnetic moment .",
    "the phenomenological implications of @xmath2 supersymmetry are rich . here",
    "we focused on those which could be studied in a relatively model - independent fashion .",
    "however , the details of the model , for example , the extent of mirror parity violation ( if any ) and the flavor theory , can determine many aspects of the model phenomenology such as the stable particles , the cascade chains , and indirect effects in low - energy and electroweak sm observables .",
    "the high precision in which the sm gauge couplings are currently measured strengthens the successful gauge coupling unification picture in @xmath9 theories .",
    "( see , for example , ref .",
    "unfortunately , mssm - like planckian unification of the gauge couplings seems inconsistent with the framework of low - energy @xmath2 .",
    "since there are no higher - loop corrections in @xmath2 it is sufficient to examine unification at one - loop order .",

    "this is inconsistent with the assumption that the @xmath2 breaking scale is near the electroweak scale .",
    "( the situation does not improve if there is only one higgs doublet hypermultiplet . ) alternatively , the mn2ssm implies unification @xmath247 orders of magnitude above its scale @xmath19 , i.e. , at intermediate energies .",

    "new physics may manifest itself as an extended gauge group , new thresholds , or even an extended @xmath249 supersymmetry ( which is finite ) , and could play a role in resolving the unification issue .",
    "note that the embedding in @xmath249 must involve also extending the gauge group as all of the sm representations must be embedded in that case in the adjoint representation ( of an extended gauge group ) , which is an interesting possibility .",
    "another issue of interest that we did not pursue here is the cosmological and astrophysical implications of such scenarios .",
    "it is interesting to revisit issues such as electroweak scale inflation @xcite and electroweak scale baryogenesis @xcite which can be sensitive to the new rich electroweak structure . in particular",

    "we also note in passing that the cosmological constant is zero in the @xmath2 limit .",
    "if the leading contribution from supersymmetry breaking is then of the order of @xmath250 ( in particular , the @xmath251 terms is canceled ) , where gravitational corrections assumed to be suppressed by inverse powers of @xmath252 , it leads to values of the cosmological constant consistent to the currently preferred value of @xmath253 @xcite .",

    ", flavor symmetries may be entangled with the mirror symmetries , rendering the heavy sm fermions `` more similar to '' the mirror fermions .",
    "this is a new paradigm for flavor symmetries which offers new avenues for construction of theories of flavor which were not yet explored .",
    "here we subscribed to an effective approach , allowing the most general kahler potential , which is constrained only by the symmetries .",
    "ultimately , one would like to derive a suitable kahler potential ( and find the necessary terms ) from a spontaneously broken @xmath2 supergravity theory , and perhaps from a more fundamental theory .",
    "( this was done in ref .",
    "@xcite for the 3 - 4 - 1 framework of ref .",
    "the scale of the more fundamental theory need also to be explored and it is suggestive that some new physics exists only a few orders of magnitude above the supersymmetry breaking scale .",
    "the embedding of @xmath2 extensions of the sm in theories with extra large spatial dimensions ( where @xmath2 naturally appears ) and/or strongly interacting string theories is also worth exploring . all in all",
    ", the viability and richness of @xmath2 extensions of the sm introduce many questions worth pursuing , from mirror quark searches to kahler potential construction in the case of low - energy supersymmetry breaking .",
    "these are integral parts of the mn2ssm construction , but their implications extend beyond it : search algorithms in models with two stable particles and limits on the higgs mass in @xmath9 models with low - energy supersymmetry breaking are examples of issues that are both central to the mn2ssm phenomenology and extend beyond the @xmath2 framework and should be explored both within and independently of the mn2ssm .",
    "we thank jon bagger , francesca borzumati , paul langacker , erich poppitz , and lisa randall for discussions and comments .",
