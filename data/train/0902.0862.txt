    "galaxies with blue central surface brightness significantly fainter than the classical freeman value of = 21.65are commonly referred to as low surface brightness galaxies ( lsbgs ) . the exact defining criterion of , which is the central surface brightness of a galactic disk by convention , varies in the literature , though it falls mostly within = 22.0 23.0@xcite .",
    "it has been suggested that lsbgs could account for a significant fraction of all galaxies in the universe @xcite , and thus are an important constituent of galaxies .",
    "lsbgs show some extremely different properties from high surface brightness galaxies ( hsbgs ) .",
    "the typical value of metallicity in lsbgs is one third of the solar metallicity @xcite .",
    "observationally , like malin 1 @xcite , a significant number of lsbgs possess diffuse faint disks with little stellar content but substantial amounts of neutral hydrogen gas .",
    "the low surface brightnesses indicates low star formation rates ( sfrs ) in these systems .",
    "indeed , it has been found that the hi surface mass densities in lsbgs are near or below the critical gas surface density for star formation threshold @xcite .",
    "these extreme properties imply that lsbgs are less evolved compared to hsbgs .",
    "bulge - dominated lsbgs are redder than disk - dominated lsbgs and both can be well described as exponential surface brightness distribution @xcite .",
    "bulges of lsbgs were found to be metal - poor compared to those hosted by hsbgs @xcite .",
    "@xcite found that there is no evidence for heavy dust obscuration in lsbgs .",
    "however , a recent study of infrared properties of lsbgs using spitzer data indicated that modest amounts of dust exist in a fraction of lsbgs , although their metallicity and apparent transparency are low @xcite .",
    "the low surface brightness , comparable to or fainter than the night sky background ( 22.5 @xmath1 23.0 mag arcsec@xmath2 in the b band ) , makes the detection of lsbgs difficult . as such ,",
    "much less optically selected lsbgs samples than normal hsbgs have been cataloged from surveys by ground - based telescopes ( e.g. , impey et al .",
    "1996 ; monnier ragaigne et al .",
    "@xcite published a lsbg catalog of 693 lsbgs derived from the automated plate measuring ( apm ) machine scans of the uk schmidt telescope survey plates . a catalog containing 2469 southern - sky lsbgs also from the apm scans of the uk schmidt photographic plates",
    "was given by @xcite .",
    "unlike hsbgs , which have been the focus of extensive studies in extragalactic astrophysics over many years , nuclear activity in lsbgs has drawn little attention .",
    "this may be due partly to lack of large samples of lsbgs .",
    "so far , few secured agns with reliable detections have been reported in the literature , not mentioning their properties .",
    "potentially , a study of agns in lsbgs is as important as in hsbgs for the following reasons .",
    "first , it may provide important and complementary clues to uncover the formation and growth of super - massive black holes ( smbh ) , since lsbgs may have experienced a different route from hsbgs in their formation and evolution .",
    "second , in light of agn feedback , the evolution and ecology of lsbgs may be affected by the presence of powerful agns .",
    "third , a comparison of different host galaxies environments where agns reside in , hsbgs and lsbgs , may shed light on the triggering of agn activity and the dependence of agn properties on host galaxies .",
    "however , few yet contradicting results have been given in the literature as to the fraction of lsbgs harboring agns .",
    "when agn activity was first searched for via optical spectroscopy in small samples of lsbgs , a surprising result was suggested that lsbgs seem to have a higher fraction of agns . among 10 giant lsbgs ,",
    "sprayberry et al . (",
    "1995 ) found 4 seyfert1 and 1 seyfert2 nuclei , indicating a significantly high agn fraction . in a sample of 34 giant ,",
    "hi - rich lsbgs , schombert ( 1998 ) found a high fraction ( @xmath3% ) of low luminosity agns , similar to that in the magnitude - limited local galaxy sample studied by @xcite , which are mostly hsbgs .",
    "however , such a high agn fraction could not be confirmed by @xcite in a spectroscopic study of 250 lsbgs drawn from the impey et al .",
    "( 1996 ) lsbg sample ; in contrast , they found an agn fraction as low as less than 5@xmath4 .",
    "it should be noted that in essentially all those previous studies , the identification of agns was subjected to large uncertainties , due to the following limitations .",
    "firstly , the optical spectra taken were mostly of low spectral resolution ( a resolution @xmath5 used in impey01 ) and low signal to noise ratio ( s / n ) , and some of narrow wavelength coverage .",
    "as such , the line flux measurements were uncertain , especially those close lines suffering from blending . in most studies above ,",
    "agns were identified as having strong low - ionization features ( [ nii ] and [ sii ] ) combined with [ oi ] , unless a broad balmer line was present , rather than based on the rigorous line flux ratio diagnostic diagrams .",
    "the only case where an emission line ratio diagnostic diagram ( [ oiii]/ [ sii]/ ) was invoked to separate agns and hii regions was in impey01 .",
    "however , there are considerable uncertainties in the line ratios , especially for , which is heavily blended with [ nii]@xmath66548,6583 .",
    "secondly , no subtraction of starlight spectrum of the host galaxy was performed in those studies , which is important for search of agn signatures , especially for low luminosity agns , as discussed in detail in @xcite .",
    "the spectra of host galaxy starlight could affect severely the detection and measurement of emission lines , by making some weak emission line invisible ( such as ) , or distort the line fluxes , or even spuriously mimic weak broad emission lines .",
    "the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss , @xcite ) has acquired high quality optical spectra of a million galaxies over a large portion of the sky @xcite , some of which could be lsbgs . on the other hand",
    ", we have developed an algorithm for successful removal of host galaxy starlight and for accurate emission line spectral fit ( see zhou et al .",
    "2006 for details ) .",
    "these two provide us with an opportunity to revisit the above unsolved question of agns in lsbgs , with much better spectral s / n and resolution ( @xmath7 ) , wavelength coverage , and data homogeneity .",
    "the high spectral quality of large lsbg samples provided by the sdss allows us to study not only the agn demographics , but also , for the first time , the properties of agns in lsbgs .",
    "this paper presents such a study of nuclear activity in a lsbg sample .",
    "we introduce the sample and the data analysis in section 2 .",
    "the demographics of nuclear activity in lsbgs are presented in section3 , followed by a preliminary study of the properties of lsbg agns in section4 .",
    "discussion and a summary of conclusions are given in the last two sections , respectively .",
    "a cosmology with h@xmath8 = 70 km s@xmath9 mpc@xmath9 , @xmath10 = 0.3 , and @xmath11 = 0.7 is adopted .",
    "in the northern sky , the largest , well - defined optically selected lsbg sample is the catalog compiled by impey et al .",
    "( 1996 ) , which was constructed from the automated plate measuring ( apm ) machine scans of the uk schmidt telescope survey plates .",
    "it is the most extensive catalog of lsbgs in the northern sky to date , comprising 693 galaxies in the local universe with redshifts @xmath12 selected from a sky region of 786 square degrees centered on the equator . among them , 513 galaxies have large angular sizes ( the major - axis diameter d @xmath13 @xmath14 at the limiting isophote of the apm scans of 26mag arcsec@xmath2 ) and 180 have small angular sizes ( d @xmath15 @xmath14 ) .",
    "most lsbgs in this catalog have central surface brightness ranging from @xmath1621.5mag arcsec@xmath2 to 26.5mag arcsec@xmath2 in the b band .",
    "it should be noted that some of the galaxies with at the bright end may not qualify as lsbg when the = 22.0cutoff is applied .",
    "however , a significant fraction of these galaxies is still expected to be lsbgs , since the presence of a galactic bulge residing in a low surface brightness ( lsb ) disk may apparently result in a bright  @xcite .",
    "we searched for spectral data from the sdss data release 5 ( dr5 ) for the lsbgs in the impey et al .",
    "we found that , out of the 693 lsbgs , 194 have sdss spectra and were classified as galaxies by the sdss pipeline .",
    "they form our sample of study in this paper . among them , 95 are also in the spectroscopically observed subsample presented by impey01 .",
    "figure[lsbg_bt_mu0 ] shows the distributions of total @xmath17-magnitude and for the whole apm sample and the apm - sdss subsample .",
    "it can be seen that the apm - sdss subsample spans almost the entire ranges of the total magnitude and , though it drops more quickly at the faint end than the parent sample , due to the magnitude limit of the sdss spectroscopic survey .",
    "it also shows that a large fraction of the apm - sdss subsample has fainter than @xmath18 , the minimum of the nominal threshold for lsbgs . for the other objects with @xmath19 , some are likely lsbgs with a ( dominating ) bulge .",
    "therefore the apm - sdss subsample can be regarded as being composed of mostly lsbgs , with possible inclusion of some intermediate galaxies in between the typical lsbg and hsbg types . for simplicity",
    ", we refer to all the sample objects as lsbgs nominally .",
    "the sdss spectra have a wavelength coverage from 3800 to 9200 with a resolution of r@xmath2018002200 .",
    "as was demonstrated by @xcite , the vast majority of the agn population in the local universe is low luminosity agn ( llagn ) . for llagns , the optical spectra taken through either slits or fibers",
    "are dominated by host galaxy starlight .",
    "the sdss spectra were taken through a fiber aperture of 3  in diameter ( corresponding to 2.9 kpc at a redshift of 0.05 ) , and thus include large amounts of starlight from the host galaxies for the apm - sdss sample objects .",
    "careful removal of starlight , especially stellar absorption features , is essential for the detection and measurement of possible nuclear emission lines . for proper modelling of host galaxy starlight spectra",
    ", we use the algorithm developed at center for astrophysics , university of science and technology of china , which is described in detail in zhou et al .",
    "( 2006 , see also lu et al .",
    "2006 ) and is summarized in appendixa in this paper .    after subtracting modeled stellar spectra and a power - law continuum , the leftover emission line spectra , if any , are fitted using an updated version of the code described in @xcite , with improvement made for better recovery of weak emission lines .",
    "the broad  and  lines , if present , are hard to separate from nearby narrow lines .",
    "as the narrow balmer lines and the [ nii]@xmath66548 , 6583 doublet have similar profiles to the [ sii]@xmath66716 , 6731 doublet @xcite , we use the [ sii]@xmath66716 , 6731 doublet lines as a template to fit narrow lines . if [ sii ]  is weak , @xmath215007 is then used as the template .",
    "the [ sii ]  doublet are assumed to have the same profiles and redshifts ; and each is fitted with as many gaussians as is statistically justified , generally with 12 gaussians .",
    "likewise , the @xmath64959 , 5007 doublet are fitted in a similar way .",
    "furthermore , the flux ratio of @xmath215007/@xmath214959 is fixed to the theoretical value of 3 .",
    "when a good model of the narrow - line template is achieved , we scale it to fit the narrow balmer lines and the [ nii]@xmath66548 , 6583 doublet .",
    "the flux ratio of the [ nii ]  doublet @xmath216583/@xmath216548 is fixed to the theoretical value of 2.96 . for the possible broad  and  lines , we use multiple gaussians to fit them , as many as is statistically justified . if a broad emission line is detected at @xmath22 confidence level , we regard it as genuine .",
    "if the broad  line is too weak to achieve a reliable fit , we then re - fit it assuming that it has the same profile and redshift as the broad  line .",
    "our analysis results in detections of 131 emission line galaxies out of the total 194 lsbgs .",
    "this gives a fraction of 68% of emission line galaxies in lsbgs .",
    "the objects are list in table[131_lsbgs ] , along with the fitted parameters of the important lines .",
    "also listed are the stellar velocity dispersions in the central region of the host galaxies , @xmath23 , which are obtained in the above procedure of modeling the host galaxy starlight spectra .",
    "three out of the 131 galaxies are found to show broad balmer emission lines and should be broad line agns .",
    "their spectra are shown in figure[fit_broad_lsbg ] and the parameters of the broad lines are given in table[3_broad_lsbgs ] .",
    "it should be noted that the widths of emission line are corrected for the instrumental broadening , which is 55 - 80 km s@xmath9 for sdss spectra .    to demonstrate the reliability of our spectral analysis , as well as the spectral quality of the sdss",
    ", we compare our detections of broad line agns with those in impey01 . among the 95 overlapping objects in both the impey01 spectroscopic subsample and our apm - sdss subsample , two",
    "were claimed to have broad emission lines by the authors .",
    "1226@xmath240105 ( sdssj122912.9@xmath24004903.7 ) is also found in our work with the full width at half maximum ( fwhm ) of 4750kms@xmath9 , which is slightly broader than the previous value ( 4570kms@xmath9 , impey01 ) .",
    "the narrower fwhm value in impey01 is likely due to the fact that broad and narrow component deblending could not be performed given the low spectral resolution ( 20@xmath25 ) . for the second object , 1436@xmath240119 ( sdss j143846.3@xmath24010657.7 )",
    ", however , we can not confirm the presence of a broad line with the starlight subtracted sdss spectrum ( figure[impey_broad ] ) .",
    "an inspection of the original spectrum in impey01 seems to suggest that the previously claimed broad line is likely spurious and just a feature in the stellar spectrum ( no starlight subtraction was performed in impey01 ) when the resolution and s / n is low .",
    "furthermore , the one with the weakest broad line among the above 3 broad line agns in our work ( see figure[fit_broad_lsbg ] ) , sdss j231815.7@xmath24001540.2 ( ngc7589 ) , was missed in impey01 .",
    "this object is likely a seyfert1.9 , which was previously found to show strong , highly variable hard x - ray emission @xcite .",
    "we thus conclude that our spectral analysis results are much more accurate and reliable .",
    "it is worth noting that the three lsbgs , j005342.7@xmath1010506.6 , j111549.4@xmath24005137.5 and j133032.0@xmath1003613.5 that were classified as type 1 agns by @xcite , do not show evident broad emission lines in this work .",
    "this is likely due to the difference in subtraction of narrow lines .",
    "@xcite modeled every narrow line with one single gaussian .",
    "yet we noticed that the profiles of narrow lines are asymmetric and thus we used 2 gaussians to model each of the [ sii ] doublet ; the fit is used as a model to subtract the narrow component of h@xmath26 and [ nii ] , as described in section 2.2 .",
    "the asymmetric profiles of the narrow h@xmath26 and [ nii ] components can mimic a broad h@xmath26 component ( see also ho et al . 1997b ; greene & ho 2007 ) . to be conservative",
    ", we do not consider these 3 lsbgs as broad line agns in this paper .",
    "generally , there are three types of emission line spectra in galactic nuclei : star - forming ( hii ) nuclei in which line emitting gas is photoionized by radiation from hot stars , seyfert nuclei characteristic of photoionization by a power - law continuum powered by black hole accretion , and low - ionization nuclear emission regions ( liners , heckman 1980 ) with relatively strong low ionization lines ( such as [ oi ] @xmath216300 and [ nii ] @xmath66548,6583 ) and generally lower nuclear luminosities compared to seyfert galaxies .",
    "the nature of liner is still controversial , though an accretion - powered agn appears to be preferred in recent studies ( see , e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "following ho et al . , we regard liners as a subclass of agn in this paper .",
    "classification of galactic nuclei based on optical emission lines has been extensively investigated by various authors .",
    "one common and effective method is to compare the flux ratios of close lines with predictions of different photoionization models .",
    "it was first shown by @xcite that agns could be separated from hii nucleus on the diagrams of the line flux ratios [ nii]@xmath216583 / h@xmath26 vs. [ oiii]@xmath215007 / h@xmath27 , [ oii]@xmath213727 / [ oiii]@xmath215007 vs. [ oiii]@xmath215007 / h@xmath27 , and [ oi]@xmath216300 / h@xmath26 vs.  [ oiii]@xmath215007 / h@xmath27 ( the bpt diagrams ) . @xcite",
    "revised this method by including the line ratio [ sii]@xmath66717,6731/h@xmath26 and excluding the [ oii]@xmath213727/[oiii ] @xmath215007 because it is sensitive to reddening .",
    "a similar scheme was also used by @xcite . using a large sample of sdss emission line galaxies",
    ", @xcite found a clear , empirical separation between star - forming galaxies and agns on the bpt diagram of [ nii]@xmath216583/h@xmath26 versus [ oiii]@xmath215007/h@xmath27 .",
    "this classification scheme was refined recently by @xcite , by including new criteria to separate seyferts from liners using the [ sii]@xmath66717,6731/h@xmath26 and [ oi]@xmath216300/h@xmath26 line ratios . in this scheme , galaxies falling in between the empirical star - forming and agn dividing line of ka03 and the theoretical limit ( maximum star - formation ) of @xcite are regarded as composite objects ( also referred to as transition objects ) , which likely contain a metal - rich stellar population plus an agn , either a seyfert or a liner ( ho et al . 1997a ; ke06 ) in this paper , we adopt the classification scheme of ke06 , since it is the most recent updates and also easy to use .",
    "our careful deblending of the [ nii ] and [ sii ] doublets ensure that our spectral classification based on these criteria should be reliable .",

    "in fact , 79 ( 40@xmath4 ) of the 194 lsbgs have   from @xcite brighter than 22.0 mag arcsec@xmath2 , which are either lsbgs with ( dominating ) galactic bulges or simply hsbgs . among them , there are 25 agns , yielding an agn fraction of @xmath37 . considering possible contamination of hsbgs in this bright subsample ,",
    "this fraction is likely overestimated and the actual fraction for genuine lsbgs is likely even lower . the remaining 115 galaxies with @xmath38should be mostly bona fide lsbgs ( impey01 ) . among them , there are only 5 agns , making a fraction as low as 4@xmath39 .",

    "since a lsbg sample has a very different hubble type distribution from hsbgs ( the former tends to consist of more late type than the latter ) , the above result may be a reflection of the incidence of agns on galaxy morphology . to investigate this possibility",
    ", we calculate the fraction of both agns and star - forming galaxies in each morphological type , using the hubble type information provided in @xcite .",

    "the detection rate of agns is no more than 20% in lsbs of type sa , sb , and sc , and starts to drop to less than 10% in types later than sc .",
    "this result indicates that the overall low agn fraction of lsbgs than that of hsbgs is real , rather than a consequence that lsbgs tend to have more of later hubble types , which have in general low agn fractions , as known previously .",

    "when galaxies with @xmath38are considered only , the detection rates are even lower , though the sample is small .",

    "interestingly , as inferred from figure.[ha_oiii_lum ] , the agn detection rate becomes higher with higher l[oiii ] , i.e. increasing gradually from @xmath207% at 10@xmath49 ergs s@xmath9 up to @xmath2078% at 10@xmath50 ergs s@xmath9 .        in agns of normal hsbgs",

    "the value of @xmath0 can be obtained in our modeling of the stellar spectra of the host galaxy starlight ( section2 ) . for 34 lsbgs ( 19 agns and 15 star - forming galaxies ) with both @xmath0 and the [ nii ] doublet detected at the @xmath51 level",

    "we examine optical extinction in the emission line nuclei of the lsbgs by assuming that the balmer decrements in excess of the intrinsic value 2.85 for hii region and 3.1 for agns @xcite , are caused by dust extinction .",
    "the narrow lines balmer decrements are calculated for star - forming galaxies and agns for both the lsbgs and the hsbgs . for the lsbgs ,",

    "we calculate the radio loudness r , defined as the flux ratio between 1.4 ghz and the optical b - band .",
    "six objects have @xmath64 and can be classified as radio - loud .",
    "most of the radio - loud objects of our lsbg agns are actually radio - intermediate ( @xmath65 ) , and there is no very radio loud ( r @xmath13 100 ) agns .",
    "they are all weak radio sources , with 1.4ghz fluxes less than 10 mjy . for the remaining 22 agns ,",
    "20 were in the first survey field .",
    "assuming an upper flux limit of 1mjy for the first survey , we found that at least 13 are `` radio - quiet '' ( r @xmath66 10 ) .",
    "this makes the fraction of radio - loud fraction as 20%35% ,",
    "we have shown that lsbgs have a lower agn detection rate compared to hsbgs in the local universe .",
    "the overall fraction of agns in the apm - sdss lsbg sample is @xmath67 . considering that the apm lsbg sample have possible contamination of some hsbgs",
    ", the agn fraction in genuine lsbgs can be even lower .",
    "this result holds true within each of the hubble types from sa to sc .",
    "we argue that this result is not caused by any selection effects or detecting biases in observations , since it is confirmed by comparisons with the carefully chosen hsbg comparing sample .",
    "in fact , agns in lsbgs should be more easy to detect spectroscopically compared to those in hsbgs , since the dilution of agn spectral features by host galaxy starlight spectra is less severe in lsbgs than in hsbgs . to check whether we have missed a substantial amount of agns at larger distances ,",
    "we examine how the agn detection rate varies with increasing distances .",
    "we find that the agn detection rate keeps nearly a constant at all distances within the largest redshift of th sample ( @xmath68 ) , and thus there is no significant number of faint agns missing at large distances",
    ".    in general , a low agn occurrence rate may be possibly due to the inefficiency of fueling gas into the central black holes in galaxies .",
    "however , the underlying physical processes responsible for the fueling efficiency is unknown , which is one of the fundamental questions in agn research .",
    "one speculation is that gas in lsbgs may have relative large angular momentum @xcite , even in the inner disk . alternatively",
    ", it may well be possible that this result is just a manifestation of the more fundamental differences between hsbgs and lsbgs in some of the physical properties in the central region of galaxies ( such as bulges ) , which are more directly linked to the onset of nuclear activity .",
    "motivated by this hypothesis , we search for other potential dependence of the agn occurrence rate in the lsbg sample .",
    "one such dependence is on the physical size of galaxies .",
    "figure[agn_frac_diam ] shows the distribution of the size of galaxies in the apm - sdss lsbg sample and the dependence of the agn fraction on the galaxy scale .",
    "the physical scales of the lsbgs are estimated using the angular sizes measured in the sdss imaging survey by the sdss pipeline . as can be seen",
    ", there exists a clear trend that larger galaxies tend to have a higher fraction of agns .",
    "this implies that the overall agn fraction for a sample of lsbgs depends on the distribution of the physical scales of galaxies in the sample .",
    "for the current apm - sdss lsbg sample , the vast majority of the member galaxies are smaller than 50kpc , which have very low fractions of agns .",
    "this finding also implies that , when agn fractions are compared between two lsbg samples , the distributions of the physical scales have to be taken into account .",
    "@xcite reported a high occurrence of agns ( @xmath69 ) in his lsbg sample , which are mostly late - type , hi - massive , and large - size galaxies .",
    "in fact , using the data presented in @xcite , we also find a similar strong dependence of the agn fraction on galaxy size .",
    "we compare the distributions of galactic sizes between the @xcite sample and the apm - sdss sample ; however , no significant difference is found ( the k - s test gives a probability of 68@xmath4 ) .",
    "thus , we anticipate that the higher agn fraction found in @xcite than ours is perhaps due to the small sample size , as well as possibly to the relatively coarse spectral quality , and less rigorous spectral analysis and classification method employed .",
    "a similar trend of increasing agn fraction with the increase of the size of a galaxy is also found for hsbgs in the comparing sample .",
    "meanwhile , we also find that the hsbg sample has relatively systematically larger galaxies in size ( with a median of 42.1kpc ) than the lsbg sample ( with a median of 37.4kpc for @xmath43 ) ; the k - s test shows that the two distributions are significantly different ( a probability level 10@xmath70 ) . as such ,",
    "the observed lower agn fraction in lsbgs than that in hsbgs in our study is likely a manifestation of the postulation that lsbgs are systematically smaller in size compared to hsbgs , if the proposed agn dependence on the physical scale of galaxies is the case . however , these postulations need further confirmation in future studies .",
    "we also test the possible dependence of agn fraction on galactic bulge properties .",
    "it has been found that stellar velocity dispersion @xmath23 is well correlated with the bulge mass and luminosity , and is thus a tracer of the gravitational potential of the bulge .",
    "given the spectral resolution of sdss data , the minimum values of @xmath23 can be measured are around 70 .",
    "for those objects without measurable @xmath23 , we assume their @xmath23 to be less than 70 .",
    "figure[agn_frac_vdisp ] shows the distribution of @xmath23 for the apm - sdss lsbg sample and for their agns , as well as the agn fraction .",
    "it can be seen clearly that the agn fraction increases in higher @xmath23 bins .",
    "similar trend is also found in the hsbg comparing sample , which is a known property that agns tend to be found in early type galaxies , where bulges are dominant .",
    "our result in section3 shows that even for the same hubble type ( sa  sc ) , lsbgs have a lower agn fraction than hsbgs . in the context of the agn fraction dependence on bulge properties",
    ", this may imply that within a given morphological type , lsbgs have either relatively smaller bulge mass or lower fraction of galaxies with bulges , compared to hsbgs .",
    "again , this postulation needs confirmation by future studies .",
    "the dependence of agn fraction on both the size of galaxies and galactic bulge property is not surprising , since galaxy sizes and @xmath23 are strongly coupled in the samples studied here .",
    "however , we consider the latter relation is perhaps more fundamental , since it has becoming known that the growth of galactic bulges and the growth of central black hole are somehow related @xcite .",
    "the broad h@xmath26 emission lines are well detected in 3 lsbgs .",
    "we estimate the masses of central black holes using the linewidth - luminosity mass scaling relation given in @xcite .",
    "the values are 2.8 @xmath45 10@xmath71 m@xmath72 for sdss j011448.7@xmath1002946.1 , 2.0 @xmath45 10@xmath73 m@xmath72 for sdss j122912.9@xmath24004903.7 and 3.4 @xmath45 10@xmath71 m@xmath72 for sdss j231815.7@xmath24001540.2 respectively .",
    "for the two agns , sdss j011448.7@xmath1002946.1 and sdss j122912.9@xmath24004903.7 , broad components of h@xmath27 are also detected with reliable confidence .",
    "it is claimed by @xcite that the absolute uncertainties in masses estimated by these mass scaling relationships are about a factor of 4 . according to the scaling relationships calibrated by @xcite based upon the broad h@xmath27 luminosity ,",
    "black hole masses are estimated to be 3.6 @xmath45 10@xmath71 m@xmath72 for sdss j011448.7@xmath1002946.1 and 4.4 @xmath45 10@xmath73 m@xmath72 for sdss j122912.9@xmath24004903.7 are found , respectively .    for these 3 agn with central black hole mass estimates , the stellar velocity dispersion @xmath23 can also be measured in our spectral analysis .",
    "we are therefore able to , for the first time , test the relationship between black hole mass and stellar velocity dispersion ( m@xmath74 ) relation for lsbgs , though the number of objects is very small .",
    "the result is shown in figure[mbh_sigma_star ] .",
    "it can be seen that , for lsbg , the observed data are broadly consistent within errors with the known m@xmath74 established based on local normal galaxies and agns ( tremaine et al .",

    ", a statistically meaningful result has to await the availability of a larger sample with both black hole mass and @xmath23 measurements .",
    "we have performed detailed spectral analysis of 194 lsbgs from the impey et al .",
    "( 1996 ) apm lsbg sample which have been observed spectroscopically by the sdss dr5 .",
    "our work improves upon previous spectroscopic studies on lsbgs with high and homogeneous quality sdss spectra and elaborate spectral analysis , which includes subtraction of host galaxy starlight spectra , and deblending narrow and broad components of the balmer lines and doublets .",
    "these improvements allow us to carry out , for the first time , reliable spectral classification of nuclear activities of lsbgs based on the bpt classification schemes in a rigorous way .",
    "we also identified three secured broad line agns in lsbgs , and clarified a few spurious ones claimed in previous work .",
    "we found that , the majority ( 68% ) of the lsbgs are emission line galaxies .",
    "the most abundant class is star - forming galaxies ( 52% ) characteristic of hii emission line spectra . within the apm - sdss sample , about 15% lsbgs show emission line spectra characteristic of agns , including seyfert galaxies , liners , and galactic nuclei composed of an agn and central star - forming region .",
    "such a fraction of agns is significantly lower than that found in local normal galaxies .",
    "this result holds true even within each morphological type from sa to sc .",
    "our results do not support the high agn fractions in lsbgs suggested in some of the previous studies @xcite , but is qualitatively consistent with that found by impey01 .",
    "we found that the fraction of agns depends strongly both on the stellar velocity dispersion of the bulges and on the physical size of the galaxies , the two of which are coupled with each other .",
