    "a special place among few - body systems is reserved for the three - nucleon ( 3n ) system , for which a mathematically sound theoretical formulation in the form of faddeev equations exists , both for bound and scattering states . over the past few decades algorithms",
    "have been developed to solve numerically three - nucleon faddeev equations for any dynamical input which , in addition to nucleon - nucleon ( nn ) interactions , also involves three - nucleon forces ( 3nfs ) @xcite . using these algorithms and standard ,",
    "( semi)phenomenological nucleon - nucleon interactions alone or supplemented by three - nucleon force model , numerous investigations of 3n bound states and reactions in the 3n continuum have been carried out .",
    "high precision nucleon - nucleon potentials such as the av18  @xcite , cd  bonn  @xcite , nijm i and ii  @xcite nn forces , which provide a very good description of the nucleon - nucleon data up to about 350 mev , have been used .",
    "they have also been combined with model 3n forces such as the @xmath3-exchange tucson - melbourne ( tm99 ) 3nf @xcite or the urbana ix model @xcite .    when realistic nn forces are used to predict binding energies of three - nucleon systems they typically underestimate the experimental bindings of @xmath4h and @xmath4he by about 0.5 - 1 mev  @xcite .",
    "this missing binding energy can be corrected for by introducing a three - nucleon force into the nuclear hamiltonian  @xcite .",
    "also the study of elastic nucleon - deuteron ( nd ) scattering and nucleon induced deuteron breakup revealed a number of cases where the nonrelativistic description using only pairwise forces is insufficient to explain the data .",
    "the best studied case at low energies is the vector analyzing power in elastic nd scattering for which a large discrepancy exists in the region of its maximum around c.m .",
    "angles @xmath5 and for incoming nucleon energies below @xmath6  mev @xcite . for the elastic scattering angular distribution at such energies ,",
    "negligible effects of 3nf s have been found and theory based on realistic nn forces agrees well with the data @xcite .    that picture changes with increasing energy of the nd system .",
    "generally , the studied discrepancies between experiment and theory using only nn potentials become larger and adding a three - nucleon force to the pairwise interactions leads in some cases to a better description of the data .",
    "the elastic nd angular distribution in the region of its minimum and at backward angles is the best known example  @xcite . the clear discrepancy in these angular regions at energies up to @xmath7  mev between a theory using only nn potentials and the cross section data can be removed by adding standard models of three - nucleon forces to the nuclear hamiltonian .",
    "such 3nfs are adjusted for a given nn potential to reproduce the experimentally observed binding energy of @xmath4h and @xmath4he  @xcite . at energies higher than @xmath8",
    "mev current 3nfs only partially improve the description of cross section data and the remaining discrepancies , which increase with energy , indicate the possibility of relativistic effects .",
    "the need for a relativistic description of three - nucleon scattering was realized when precise measurements of the total cross section for neutron - deuteron ( nd ) scattering  @xcite were analyzed within the framework of nonrelativistic faddeev calculations  @xcite .",
    "nn forces alone were insufficient to describe the data above @xmath8  mev .",
    "the effects due to the relativistic kinematics considered in @xcite at higher energies were comparable in magnitude to the effects due to 3nfs .",
    "these results provided further motivation to study relativistic effects in the three nucleon continuum in a systematic way .",
    "subsequent studies of relativistic effects in the three - nucleon continuum @xcite revealed , that when the non - relativistic form of the kinetic energy is replaced by the relativistic form and a proper treatment of the relativistic dynamics is introduced , the elastic scattering cross section is only slightly increased at backward angles and higher energies while spin observables are practically unchanged .",
    "these results led to the conclusion that discrepancies between data and theory at higher energies must reflect the action of 3nf s which have to be included in the nuclear hamiltonian .",
    "the main drawback of all those studies was inconsistency between applied nn interactions and 3nfs . with the advent of effective field theoretical methods in the form of chiral perturbation theory , it became possible to construct consistent two- and many - nucleon forces . in this way an exciting possibility to study few - nucleon systems and their reactions with consistent two- and many - nucleon interactions has emerged .    in @xcite ,",
    "the above mentioned inconsistency was removed and low - energy 3n continuum were investigated with chiral next - to - next - to - leading order ( n@xmath9lo ) nn and 3n forces . the nn interaction in that order , however , does not describe the nn experimental phase - shifts in a sufficiently wide energy range to allow application of those forces at higher energies .    in @xcite and @xcite ,",
    "precise two - nucleon potentials have been developed at next - to - next - to - next - to - leading order ( n@xmath4lo ) of the chiral expansion .",
    "they reproduce experimental nn phase - shifts @xcite in a wide energy range and practically with the same high precision as realistic ( semi)phenomenological nn potentials .",
    "the necessary work to derive the consistent chiral 3nf s at n@xmath4lo has been accomplished in @xcite and @xcite . at that order ,",
    "six different topologies contribute to the 3nf .",
    "three of them are of a long- and intermediate - range @xcite and are given by two - pion ( 2@xmath10 ) exchange , two - pion - one - pion ( 2@xmath10 - 1@xmath10 ) exchange and the so - called ring diagrams .",
    "they are supplemented by the shorter - range @xmath11-contact and three - nucleon - contact components , which appear first at n@xmath9lo , by the two - pion - exchange - contact ( 2@xmath10-contact ) term as well as by the leading relativistic corrections to the three - nucleon force @xcite .",
    "the results of refs .",
    "@xcite enable one to perform , for the first time , consistent calculations of three - nucleon reactions at n@xmath4lo order of chiral expansion .",
    "the 3nf at this order does not involve any new unknown low - energy constants ( lecs ) and depends only on two free parameters , @xmath12 and @xmath13 , which parametrize the strengths of the leading @xmath11-contact and the three - nucleon - contact terms .",
    "their values need to be fixed ( at given order ) from a fit to a few - nucleon data . among the few possible observables that have been used in this connection one can mention the triton binding energy , the nd doublet scattering length @xmath14 @xcite , the @xmath15he binding energy @xcite along with the point proton rms radius @xcite , the properties of light nuclei , or the triton @xmath16 decay rate  @xcite .",
    "notice that the first three observables are known to be strongly correlated and therefore might not be the best choice for the determination of @xmath12 and @xmath13 .",
    "application of n@xmath4lo 3nf in few - body calculations is challenging due to its very rich and complicated operator structure .",
    "the large number of terms in the 3nf at n@xmath4lo @xcite requires an efficient method of performing partial - wave decomposition .",
    "recently such a method , which runs under the name of automatized partial - wave decomposition ( apwd ) , was proposed in @xcite . in that approach ,",
    "the matrix elements in the 3n momentum - space partial wave basis for different terms contributing to n@xmath4lo 3nf are obtained in two consecutive steps .",
    "first , the spin - momentum and isospin parts of three - nucleon interactions are computed using symbolic algebra systems .",
    "the resulting momentum - dependent functions are then integrated numerically in five dimensions over angular variables . the major advantage of this method is its generality since it can be applied to any momentum - spin - isospin operator .",
    "application of that method for higher angular momenta requires large computer resources .",
    "therefore , in this first study of the 3n continuum with full n@xmath4lo chiral force , we restrict ourselves to low energies only . in that region of incoming neutron laboratory ( lab . )",
    "energies below @xmath17  mev , the most challenging observables are the nd elastic scattering analyzing power and cross sections in symmetric space star and neutron - neutron quasi - free - scattering configurations of the nd breakup reaction . the discrepancies between data and",

    "large discrepancies with the data remain in these configurations .    for the sst geometry at @xmath70  mev",
    ", there is a serious discrepancy between theory and two independent nd data sets of refs .",
    "@xcite as well as between theory and proton - deuteron ( pd ) data of ref .",
    "while the nd data lie @xmath78 above the theory , the pd data lie @xmath79 below theory and @xmath58 below nd data .",
    "recent pd calculations with coulomb force included show practically negligible effects of the proton - proton coulomb force for this configuration @xcite .",
    "the observed large splitting between the nd and pd data indicates either that there are large isospin - breaking effects or that the data are not consistent .",
    "higher - energy nd reactions , in which clear evidence of large 3nf effects was found , call for applications of the full n@xmath4lo force . studies of the cut - off dependence of n@xmath4lo nn chiral interaction in higher - energy nd elastic scattering revealed preference for larger cut - off values @xcite .",
    "the use of lower cut - offs would preclude applications of n@xmath4lo chiral dynamics in that interesting region of energies .",
    "it is important to address the issue of reducing finite - cutoff artifacts and increasing the accuracy of chiral nuclear forces prior to applying the chiral n@xmath4lo hamiltonian at higher energies .",
    "in addition , one needs to explore different possibilities to determine the lecs entering the 3nf in view of the known strong correlations between e.g. the @xmath4h and @xmath15he binding energies and the nd doublet scattering lengths , see @xcite for a related discussion .",
    "last but not least , more effort should be invested into providing a reliable estimation of the theoretical uncertainty at a given order in the chiral expansion .",
    "work along these lines is in progress .",
