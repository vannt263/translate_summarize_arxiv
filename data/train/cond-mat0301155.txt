    "diffusion - limited reactions have attracted much interest in recent years  @xcite .",
    "the kinetics of such systems is dominated by local fluctuations in the concentration of the reactants , thus posing a formidable problem which has not yet been solved : there exists no comprehensive theoretical approach for the analysis of diffusion - limited processes .",
    "few select models are amenable to exact analysis .",
    "these include one - species annihilation , @xmath9 , and two - species annihilation @xmath10 ( see  @xcite and references therein ) . in one dimension",
    ", the particle density for one - species annihilation decays as @xmath11 , while for two - species annihilation ( with equal initial concentrations and same diffusion constants for the two species ) @xmath12 . in either case",
    "the result is strikingly different from the mean - field kinetics of the corresponding reaction - limited process , @xmath13 . to bridge the gap between these disparate behaviors , ben - avraham and redner  @xcite proposed the n-_species annihilation _ model , where particles belonging to the @xmath0 species @xmath14 diffuse on the line and react immediately uppon encounter , according to the scheme : @xmath15 for @xmath16 we recover two - species annihilation , while in the limit @xmath17 encounters between like - particles are improbable and",
    "the model is equivalent to one - species annihilation . for intermediate values of @xmath0",
    ", one expects @xmath18 .    in  @xcite it was proposed , following a heuristic scaling argument and treating fluctuations via the van kampen @xmath19-expansion  @xcite , that @xmath20 .",
    "this was supported by numerical simulations of lattices of typically @xmath21 sites , and up to @xmath21 time steps .",
    "( in one time step , all of the particles in the system move one lattice spacing each , on average . )",
    "recently , we have conducted extensive numerical simulations  @xcite , following the method of renormalized reaction - cells ( rrc )  @xcite .",
    "the systems involved are up to @xmath22 sites long , and the processes were simulated to completion ( until no further reactions are possible ) , for up to @xmath4 time steps .",
    "the new data leads us to the conjecture that @xmath5  @xcite .",
    "we also find a correction to the main decay mode , of the form @xmath23 , @xmath24 . the same results were found , independently ( and unbeknownst to us ) , by deloubrire et al . ,  @xcite . in their theoretical derivation , they consider a simplified version of @xmath0-species annihilation , where domains of alternating species loose particles to reactions at one and the same rate , in a synchronous fashion .",
    "the approximation is more than reasonable , yet it does not rigorously apply to the original model , and analysis of corrections is certainly beyond its scope .",
    "moreover , the simulations in  @xcite are comparable in size to those in  @xcite . in what follows ,",
    "we report the results of our large - scale simulations , which strongly support the conclusions of  @xcite .",
    "we also propose a scaling relation for the correction exponent @xmath7 for @xmath0-species annihilation , and possibly for other reaction models where particles segregate into distinct domains .",
    "as is well known , local fluctuations in the concentrations of the different species drive the kinetics of @xmath0-species annihilation  @xcite . an initially random homogeneous distribution of the particles evolves into a continuously growing mosaic of domains of alternating surviving species .",
    "two lengthscales characterize the emerging distribution and dominate the system : the inter - domain distance  the distance between the last particle in a domain and the first particle in the domain next to it  @xmath25 , and the domain length , @xmath26  @xcite .",
    "these quantities grow with time as @xmath27 once domains form , reactions might take place only at the domain boundaries , and particles have to diffuse across the domain gap @xmath28 to react with other species .",
    "this takes a typical time of @xmath29 , where @xmath30 is the diffusion constant .",
    "the change in particle concentration during time @xmath31 equals the total number of domain boundaries divided by the lattice size @xmath32 ; @xmath33 .",
    "thus , @xmath34 on substituting the relations  ( [ expsbg ] ) and @xmath35 , we derive the scaling rule @xmath36 due to the underlying transport mechanism , we expect that domains grow diffusively , as @xmath37 , so @xmath38 , and in effect there is only one independent exponent : @xmath39 .",
    "the general scaling form holds also for two - species annihilation in the presence of drift ( and with ard - core repulsion between like species ) , where @xmath40 , @xmath41 , and @xmath42  @xcite .",
    "the @xmath0-species annihilation process is simulated as follows .",
    "the sites of a one - dimensional lattice are either empty or occupied by a particle ( of one of the @xmath0 species ) .",
    "periodic boundary conditions are imposed , so the lattice is effectively a ring . at each monte carlo",
    "step a particle is chosen randomly and is moved to the nearest site to its right or left , with equal probabilities .",
    "if the target site is occupied by a particle of a different species , then both particles are removed from the system , mimicking the reaction  ( [ react ] ) .",
    "if the target site is occupied by a particle of the same species , then the move is disallowed and it does not take place . regardless of the outcome",
    ", time is incremented by @xmath43 , where @xmath44 is the total number of extant particles .    as the simulation proceeds , the particle concentration declines and the typical distance between particles increases .",
    "the time spent on simulating the diffusive motion of the particles until they interact grows even faster , as the square of the distance between them .",
    "because of that , computer simulations are limited to relatively short times .",
    "this problem is overcome by the rrc method  @xcite .    in the rrc method",
    "the particles occupy cells , rather than sites . each time",
    "the concentration halves , the cells are renormalized : every two cells are merged into one , and time is renormalized accordingly .",
    "the typical time required to diffuse out of a renormalized cell twice as large as that of the previous generation is four times longer .",
    "thus , physical time is simulated faster with each renormalization step and the process can be simulated to completion .",
    "other details for the implementation of the rrc method are discussed in  @xcite .",
    "simulations were performed on dec alpha processors running linux . since each lattice site requires 6 bytes",
    "( for species , number of particles , and a pointer to a list of populated sites that is used for fast selection at each monte carlo step ) , with 2 gigabytes ( @xmath45 bytes ) memory we were able to simulate lattices of up to @xmath3 sites .",
    "the compiler was given special @xmath46pragma pack(1 ) instructions to circumvent word alignment ( which would allocate @xmath47 bytes for our @xmath48-byte site ) .    to test the technique , we have simulated the cases of @xmath16 and @xmath49 on lattices of @xmath50 sites , in both the rrc and the traditional simulation method .",
    "these lattices are small enough to enable the simulation of the process by the traditional method to completion . on the other hand ,",
    "the system is large enough to let us examine the effect of the renormalizations : with @xmath51 sites and @xmath52 the rrc method requires @xmath53 renormalizations . in fig .",
    "[ test]a we compare the particle concentration as obtained by the two methods . in fig .",
    "[ test]b we plot the local slope of the curves , the exponent @xmath54 .",
    "the renormalizations are discernable only in this second , more stringent test , but the overall agreement is excellent .",

    "we look for corrections of the form @xmath76 where @xmath77 and @xmath78 are constants .",
    "our strategy consists of performing a least squares linear fit of @xmath79 to @xmath63 , for different powers @xmath7 , and searching for the value of @xmath7 which minimizes the error .",
    "the scaling form  ( [ corrections ] ) is expected to work only after the asymptotic regime sets in , and before finite - size effects begin , and the sticky part of our procedure is deciding which times demarcate this region . experimenting with different choices gives us a feel for the errors involved . in fig .",

    "@xmath81 , for @xmath49 on a @xmath82 lattice , where our data is most reliable .",
    "the results are most compatible with @xmath83 ( for @xmath49 ) . similar tests for other values of @xmath0 lead us to the conjecture that @xmath24 .    the correction exponent can be understood by a simple - minded argument . in deriving  ( [ dc / dt ] )",
    "we have assumed that the typical distance between reacting particles , at the edges of adjacent domains , is @xmath28 .",
    "while this is correct , we note that , had the distribution of particles been homogeneous , the distance between reacting pairs would be typically @xmath84 , quite different from the assumed @xmath85 . using @xmath86 in  ( [ dc / dt ] ) , instead of @xmath87 , yields a faster decay ; @xmath88 . diffusion provides a natural drive toward a homogeneous distribution , and so it is conceivable that this faster mode of decay is manifested as a correction to the main behavior , @xmath89 .",
    "it follows from  ( [ corrections ] ) that the correction exponent is @xmath90 where the last equality applies to @xmath0-species annihilation , provided that the conjecture  ( [ conj ] ) holds .",

    "we have also provided a new scaling relation for the correction - to - scaling exponent @xmath7 , valid for diffusion - limited reactions in one dimension , where the particles segregate into alternating domains .",
    "the corrections to the main decay mode are large , and explain the failure of  @xcite to obtain the correct asymptotic behavior with the size of simulations employed at that time .",
