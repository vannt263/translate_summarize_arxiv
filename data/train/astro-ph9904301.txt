    "iso_.    ir line ratios such as [ ] 25.9@xmath4 m / [ ] 12.8@xmath4 m and [ ] 25.9@xmath4 m / [ ] 15.6@xmath4 m were used previously @xcite to establish the dominant source ( starburst or agn ) of ionizing radiations in ultraluminous infrared galaxies . actually , rather than normalizing just to [ ] or [ ] , lutz et al .",
    "@xcite use [ ] / ( [ ] + 0.44 [ ] ) as a critical line ratio to reveal different excitation conditions in starburst galaxies .",
    "results from pure photoionization models or from pure shock models are used by these authors in order to explain the observed line ratios . however , these models were not successful in reproducing the ir line ratios of several starburst galaxies .",
    "in fact , models with a power - law radiation producing enough [ ] line give too high values for the [ ] / [ ] line ratio .",
    "those with two - temperature ( 39000 k + 80000 k ) black body radiation fail in explaining the low - excitation starbursts .",
    "finally , pure shock models could provide [ ] line intensities similar to observations but not enough [ ] and [ ] which should come from the  region .",
    "these results indicate that a composite model , which accounts for the coupled effects of shocks and photoionization , must be used .",
    "indeed , in a disturbed region such as that containing starbursts , it is expected that shocked gas is embedded in stellar radiation .",
    "this kind of composite model has successfully explained the agn spectral features ( viegas & contini 1997 and references therein ) as well as those of single galaxies where the agn and starburst activities are of comparable importance ( e.g. the circinus galaxy , contini et al .",
    "these models were provided by the suma code ( see viegas & contini 1994 and references therein ) .    in the present study",
    "we suggest that shocks result from supernova explosions in the nuclear starburst region of the galaxy , which provide enough kinetic energy to create high velocity superwinds",
    ". these in turn will accelerate gas clouds on large scales .",
    "the physical conditions in the ionized interstellar clouds are determined by shocks coupled to photoionization by massive hot stars ( o and wolf - rayet ) .",
    "this paper , rather than being an answer to lutz et al .",
    "@xcite , is aimed at carrying on their investigation .",
    "the distinction between agn and starburst activity in galaxies being already established @xcite , our aim is to find out which models ( provided by the suma code ) , better fit the observed trend between ir line ratios in starburst galaxies .",
    "we will not discuss in detail the single galaxy structures , but will use the fit of calculated to observed line ratios to define the critical parameters ( and their ranges of values ) which prevail in the emitting gas . in other words , we will treat the emission - line regions of the observed galaxies as schematic systems of gaseous clouds moving radially outward from star - forming regions ionized by hot stars and shocks , avoiding a deep investigation on the internal structure of single objects .",

    "as commented above , lutz et al .",
    "@xcite concluded that shocks are the most plausible ionizing mechanism for explaining the [ ] line , while the [ ] and [ ] come from the photoionized region .",
    "however , shock results should be obtained by consistent models concomitantly with photoionization from hot stars .",
    "the suma code consistently accounts for both the shock effect accompanying cloud expansion and photoionization by hot stars , in a plane - parallel symmetry .",
    "the geometrical thickness of the clouds range from 0.01 to 2.70 pc ( see table  [ table1 ] ) , which is small compared with the radius of the starburst regions in galaxies . in our model , we assume that the gas clouds move radially outward from the starburst region , i.e. the hot star population is facing the inner edges of the clouds while a shock develops on the opposite side .    for all models an average @xmath5 , = @xmath6 k , for the hot star population , and a preshock magnetic field , 0 = @xmath7 gauss , are adopted , as well as cosmic abundances .",
    "lower abundances should lead to a lower cooling rate of the gas downstream which could be reajusted by adopting higher preshock densities .",
    "the other input parameters for suma : the shock velocity , , the preshock density , 0 , the ionization parameter , @xmath8 , and the geometrical thickness of the clouds , @xmath9 , are chosen to vary within the ranges consistent with observations .    [ table2 ]      first we perform calculations by single - cloud models , which are compared with the observations of each galaxy in fig .  [ fig1 ] .",

    "the fit is very good for almost all galaxies .",
    "a perfect fit for individual data is senseless because many different conditions coexist in single objects .",
    "notice indeed that ngc 4945 is a composite object with starburst / seyfert 2 nuclear activity .",
    "this could explain its higher intensity of [ ] 25.9@xmath4 m relative to model predictions for starburst only .",
    "a possible hidden agn has also been reported in the merger galaxy ngc 3256 @xcite .",
    "the parameters listed in table  [ table1 ] indicate that the shock velocity and the preshock density are the critical parameters to reproduce the observed trend of the ir line ratios in fig .",

    "therefore , we performed multi - cloud model calculations to reproduce all the observed ir line ratios available in the literature for the starburst galaxies ngc 253 , ngc 3256 , and m 82 . in these models , we assume that both _ low _ and _ high _ density - velocity ( d - v ) clouds are present in single objects .    in table",
    "[ table2 ] , the calculated ir line fluxes are given for single - cloud models and for the weighted sums of the multi - cloud models .",
    "notice that the line fluxes are calculated at the emitting nebula while the observations are given at earth .",
    "the input parameters of single - cloud models are also listed .",
    "line fluxes are proportional to the square of the gas emitting density , and compression downstream increases with the shock velocity .",
    "thus , the line fluxes computed from high d - v models ( i.e. a1 , b1 , and c1 ) are higher than those calculated from low d - v models ( a2 , a3 , a4 , b2 , b3 , c2 , and c3 ) by some orders of magnitude , except for lines  and .",
    "the gas in high d - v models is ionized to very high temperatures ( fig .",
    "[ fig2]b ) , and so low - level lines like  and  are weak .",
    "recall that the first ionization potential of c is lower than that of h ( and ne ) .",
    "consequently ,  lines , as well as  lines , are emitted by relatively cold gas and can be weak in models which show strong  lines .    in order to fit the observations",
    ", a balance must be achieved between high and low d - v models in the multi - cloud spectra , and the final result is a weighted sum ( a@xmath14 in table 2 ) with the weights chosen adequately . for each model , the weight @xmath15 represents the relative number of clouds ( in % ) characterized by that model .",
    "the weights of low d - v models must be by a factor of @xmath16 higher than for high d - v models .",
    "in other words , the number of high d - v clouds must be very low compared with the number of low d - v clouds . in table  [ table2 ] , for each emission line , the second entry corresponds to the percentage contribution of the single - cloud model to the line flux , taking into account the corresponding weight .",
    "the high d - v clouds contribute up to 90% to the  and  emission lines , whereas the  line is produced at a same level both by low and high d - v clouds for m 82 and ngc 3256 .",
    "the others ir lines are mainly emitted by the low d - v clouds except the  52 line .",
    "the results of multi - cloud model calculations are compared to the observed ir line ratios in table  [ table3 ] and plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ( open triangles ) .",
    "the fit is good for all line ratios ( especially for the density critical ones , see sect .",
    "[ scm ] ) , except for the [ ] line which is overpredicted by a factor of about 5 .",
    "this might indicate that silicium is depleted and locked in dust grains . adopting a relative abundance si / h lower by a factor of @xmath0 5 than cosmic will not affect the predictions for the other line ratios listed in table  [ table3 ] .",
    "most of the ir lines reported in table  [ table2 ] ( e.g. [ ] , [ ] , etc ) are mainly produced by the low d - v clouds .",
    "thus , in the weighted sum , the ir lines ratios [ ] 33@xmath4m/18@xmath4 m and [ ] 88@xmath4m/52@xmath4 m are determined by low d - v models , while the [ ] /([]+0.44 [ ] ) and [ ] / [ ] line ratios are mainly determined by the high d - v cloud component .",
    "once fitted the line ratios , it is now possible to examine the fwhm of the line profiles , because the weights adopted in table  [ table2 ] for high d - v models are very low and could lead to hardly observable broad components in the line profiles .",
    "the calculated line profiles for m 82 and ngc 253 are shown in fig  [ lineprof ] .",
    "the effect of galaxy rotation is included in the calculation .",
    "rotation velocities are about 76  and 189  for m 82 and ngc 253 respectively .",
    "two significant lines are chosen for each galaxy :  and  for m 82 , and  and  88 for ngc 253 .",
    "the  88 line is chosen because it represents the case of a low contribution of the high d - v model ( c1 ) relatively to a strong contribution of the low d - v model ( c3 ) .",
    "single - cloud model profiles are also plotted in the figures using their percentage contribution reported in table  [ table2 ] .",
    "the broad component from the high d - v clouds dominates the weighted averaged profile of , while in the  88 and  profiles the broad component is faint and hardly observable , due to the low contribution from high d - v clouds . for m 82 ,",
    "the predicted fwhm of the  profile is @xmath0 300 , in good agreement with the observed value ( fwhm @xmath0 360 ) reported by lutz et al .",
    "@xcite .",
    "to better understand the role of the input parameters in determining the physical conditions of the emitting gas , the distribution of some important physical quantities across the cloud is given in figures  [ fig2]a and [ fig2]b respectively for two significant models listed in table  [ table1 ] : ngc 5253 , which represents the low density - velocity cloud component , and the high density - velocity component of ngc 253 .",

    "the ionization rates for @xmath18 due to the primary radiation ( p ) , to the diffuse radiation ( d ) , and to electronic collisions ( c ) are given in the bottom panel .",
    "the [ ] line is always emitted from the shock dominated region where the temperatures are high , with no contribution from the photoionized zone .",
    "in particular , fig .",
    "[ fig2]a shows that the critical temperatures are about @xmath20 k. for ngc 5253 the shock effect becomes negligible at a distance of about @xmath21 cm from the shock front , and most of the physical conditions in the cloud are then dominated by the effect of stellar radiation which leads to [ ] / [ ] @xmath22 1 . on the other hand , due to strong compression in the ngc 253 gas clouds ( fig .",
    "[ fig2]b ) , the temperature rapidly drops to  @xmath23 k. this can be explained by the high density ( @xmath24 3 ) of the gas in the innermost region of the cloud which strengthens the cooling rate .",
    "the role of the primary radiation is to keep the gas at a temperature slightly below @xmath25 k corresponding to a relatively high @xmath19/ne compared to @xmath26/ne and @xmath18/ne .",
    "therefore , for this galaxy , [ ] / [ ] is @xmath11 1 .",
    "owing to the high optical thickness of the gas , the stellar radiation flux reaching the inner edge of the cloud rapidly decreases , the size of the @xmath18 photoionized zone is reduced , and the diffuse radiation effect prevails accross the cloud .    for ngc 253 , temperatures as high as @xmath27 k deduced from the rosat pspc data ( heckman 1996 and references therein ) are in agreement with @xmath28 k obtained by the model in the postshock region ( fig .",
    "[ fig2]b ) .",
    "precursor soft x - rays radiation from the hot gas could affect the ionization conditions in the upstream gas clouds .",
    "however , due to the adiabatic jump and compression , the densities @xmath29 upstream are lower than in the downstream gas by at least a factor of 4 . considering that line intensities depend on @xmath30 , the contribution of the line emission from upstream gas to the final spectrum will be small .",
    "one might interpret the observed trend in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] as a continuous sequence between two extreme cases : starburst regions where shocks in high - velocity clouds are _ necessary _ to reproduce the observed critical ir line ratios ( bottom left part of the diagram ) and the `` radiation - dominated '' ones ( upper right part of the diagram ) , where the shock contribution is relatively less important , because formed only in low - velocity clouds .",
    "let us now check wether the critical parameters derived from the models along this sequence are in agreement with the observed properties of the starburst galaxies .",

    "evidence for powerful large - scale starburst - driven superwinds in the nuclear region of sbngs ( like m 82 , ngc 253 , ngc 4945 and ngc 3690 in the present sample ) has been reported by heckman et al .",
    "moreover , the strong x - ray emission ( @xmath36 , see table  [ table4 ] ) in sbngs provides strong evidence for the formation of hot superbubbles due to the combined action of stellar winds from massive stars and supernova explosions in the central starburst cluster .",

    "the archetypes of this class of galaxies are ii zw 40 and ngc 5253 .",
    "their starbursts are very young ( @xmath38 4 myr ) , as proved by the numerous wolf - rayet stars still present in ii zw 40 @xcite and ngc 5253 @xcite , and only contain a few supernova remnants ( vanzi et al .",

    "1998 ) , and the most massive stars had the time to evolve through supernovae . as shown by the models of leitherer & heckman @xcite , the ratio between the mechanical energy and the ionizing lyman continuum , both injected in the ism by the massive star population , rapidly increases by a factor of @xmath0 100 between @xmath0 5 and 20 myr .",
