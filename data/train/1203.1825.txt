    "the cmb temperature was measured to be @xmath4k by the far infrared absolute spectrometer ( firas ) of the cosmic background explorer ( cobe ) satellite ( mather et al 1999 ) .",
    "the adiabatic expansion of the universe and photon number conservation imply that the cmb temperature evolves with redshift as @xmath5 . establishing observationally",
    "this relation would test our current understanding of the universe since models like decaying vacuum energy density and gravitational ` adiabatic ' photon creation predict different scaling relations ( overduin & cooperstock , 1998 ; matyjasek 1995 ; lima et al 2000 ; puy 2004 ; jetzer et al 2011 , jetzer & tortora 2012 ) . in these models ,",
    "energy is slowly injected without producing distortions on the blackbody spectrum , evading the tight firas constraints .",
    "nevertheless , in these models the blackbody temperature scales nonlinearly as @xmath1 .",
    "therefore , measuring the redshift dependence of the cmb black body temperature at various cosmological epochs can provide strong constraints on physical theories at the fundamental level .",
    "there are currently two methods to determine @xmath6 at redshifts @xmath7 : ( a ) using fine structure lines from interstellar atoms or molecules , present in quasar spectra , whose transition energies are excited by the cmb photon bath ( bahcall & wolfe , 1968 ) and ( b ) from the thermal sunyaev - zeldovich anisotropies ( hereafter tsz , sunyaev & zeldovich , 1972 , 1980 ) due to the inverse compton scattering of photons by the free electrons within the potential wells of clusters of galaxies .",
    "early observations of fine - structure levels of atomic species like carbon only led to upper limits on @xmath6 because the cmb is not the only radiation field populating the energy levels and collisional excitation is an important contribution . assuming the cmb is the only source of excitation , songaila et al .",
    "( 1994 ) measured @xmath8k ; but collisional excitation was not negligible and it had to be corrected .",
    "the first unambiguous measurement was only achieved six years later , with a considerably larger error bar ( srianand et al .",
    "2000 ) . lately ,",
    "noterdaeme et al ( 2010 ) succeeded in obtaining a direct and precise measurements from the rotational excitation of co molecules .",

    "no significant deviations from the redshift dependence of the cmb temperature predicted in the standard model has been found .    while there is interest in doing such observations as far back as possible ( which one can do with spectroscopic methods ) ,",
    "low - redshift measurements play an important role too . first , the two techniques are complementary with each other since they have different systematics and probe the adiabatic evolution of the universe at different redshifts .",
    "spectroscopic observations probe the matter era , roughly between redshifts @xmath15 , while tsz probes the epoch of dark energy domination , @xmath16 .",
    "in particular , these measurements can shed light on the onset of dark energy domination ; in many models this is associated with as a phase transition ( mortonson et al .",
    "2009 , nunes et al .",
    "2009 ) which could leave imprints in the @xmath6 relation .",
    "second , in models where photon number is not conserved , not only does the temperature - redshift relation change , but so does the distance duality relation ( etherington 1933 ) , and these departures from the standard behavior are not independent . this link between the two relations requires information at all redshifts and will , when better datasets become available , be a powerful consistency test for the standard cosmological paradigm ( avgoustidis et al 2012 ) .",

    "its amplitude is independent on the cluster distance , making it a useful tool to detect clusters at high redshifts .",
    "all known astrophysical foregrounds have a different dependence with frequency so clusters can be clearly detected in cmb maps with enough frequency coverage . in the non - relativistic limit , @xmath36 .",

    "if the universe evolves adiabatically , @xmath5 .",
    "due to the expansion , the frequency of a photon scattered by the ic plasma at redshift @xmath40 is doppler shifted as : @xmath41 and the ratio @xmath42 is independent of redshift .",
    "if the evolution of the universe is non - adiabatic , the temperature - redshift relation would not be constant .",
    "two functional forms have been considered in the literature : @xmath1 ( lima et al 2000 ) and @xmath43 ( losecco et al 2001 ) . in both cases ,",
    "the photon frequency is assumed to be redshifted as in the standard model : @xmath41 .",
    "since the largest fraction of known clusters of galaxies are at redshifts below @xmath44 , the differences between both redshift dependences are small so we will only analyze the first model .",
    "the reduced frequency varies as @xmath45 and the spectral frequency dependence of the tsz effect , @xmath35 now depends on @xmath0 : @xmath46 . using the tsz effect ,",
    "two methods have been proposed to constraint @xmath0 .",
    "fabbri et al . (",
    "1978 ) proposed to measure the zero cross frequency of clusters at different redshifts that , for adiabatic evolution , occurs at @xmath47 .",
    "rephaeli ( 1980 ) suggested to use the ratio of the tsz anisotropy at different scales , @xmath48 .",
    "both methods have different systematics . by taking ratios ,",
    "the dependence on the comptonization parameter is removed and the need to account for model uncertainties on the gas density and temperature profile is avoided . at the same time , the analysis is more complicated since the distribution of temperature anisotropy ratios is highly non - gaussian ( luzzi et al . 2009 ) .",
    "the measurement of the cross over frequency is also problematic since the tsz is inherently weak and could be dominated by uncertain systematics .",
    "for this reason , the measurements carried out thus far ( battistelli et al 2002 , luzzi et al 2009 ) , based in a small number of clusters , have concentrated in the ratio method . as an alternative to the zero frequency method , we will fit the tsz signal at different frequencies and we will measure the function @xmath49 . we shall denote this procedure the _",
    "fit method_.    the function @xmath49 characterizes uniquely the tsz contribution . at each frequency , planck low frequency instrument ( lfi ) receivers and high frequency instrument ( hfi ) bolometers are sensitive to a wide range of frequencies and the spectral dependence is not @xmath35 but @xmath50 hereafter , we will remove the upper bar and @xmath49 will refer to the averaged frequency dependence of eq  ( [ eq : freq ] ) . in fig  [ fig1 ]",
    "we plot the temperature ratio ( fig  [ fig1]a ) and frequency dependence ( fig  [ fig1]b ) for different values of @xmath0 . in fig",
    "[ fig1]a , the solid line represents the adiabatic evolution model @xmath51 that is independent of redshift ; the dot - dashed lines bound the region where @xmath52 . from top to bottom , the ratios are @xmath53 with @xmath54ghz . in fig",

    "the null tsz signal , represented by the dotted line , shows that the zero cross frequency varies in the range @xmath57ghz .    to construct a pipeline that implements the ratio or zero cross frequency tests we need to consider the specifics of the planck data .",
    "the cosmological cmb signal is the dominant contribution except at the most massive clusters .",
    "foreground residuals or astrophysical contaminants , while smaller in amplitude , would induce systematic shifts in the comptonization parameter ( aghanim , hansen & lagache , 2005 ) varying with frequency and biasing the redshift dependence of the tsz effect . to characterize the noise and foreground emission ,",
    "the hfi and lfi core teams have constructed maps with the cmb cosmological contribution subtracted off the time ordered information ( toi ) .",
    "they have used six different component separation algorithms to remove the primordial cmb signal .",
    "the difference between the six methods provides an estimate the cmb residual ( planck hfi core team 2011b , zacchei et al 2011 ) .",
    "the resulting maps are dominated by noise and foreground residuals . due to the scanning strategy",
    ", the noise is rather inhomogeneous , largely dominated by a white noise component plus a @xmath58 contribution . in the lfi instrument , the @xmath58 noise is largest at 30ghz .",
    "for the hfi , the noise is largest at 545 and 857ghz .",
    "also , those channels have the smallest resolution and we will not be considered in this work .",
    "later we shall show that this is not a limitation since the channels with the highest resolution are the ones with the largest statistical power to determine @xmath0 .",
    "the technical details of the maps considered in this study are listed in table 1 : central frequency and fwhm of the antenna spectral response function , approximated by a gaussian with fwhm @xmath59 , angular resolution and noise per pixel .",

    "wmap used the k , ka differencing assemblies and the extinction corrected h@xmath0 maps ( finkbeiner 2003 ) to subtract the synchrotron and free - free emissions and the finkbeiner et al ( 1999 ) map to subtract the dust contribution ( see gold et al 2009 for details ) .",
    "a similar analysis using the 30 , 545 and 857 ghz channels , and foreground templates could be used to remove the foreground contribution .",
    "ideally , one would obtain maps without cosmological signal and with a low level of foreground residuals .",
    "maps free of the intrinsic cmb signal and/or foreground residuals are the most convenient to test the adiabatic evolution of the universe .",
    "removing the cosmological cmb signal on the toi data leaves an unknown level of cmb residuals , whose distribution and power spectrum are difficult to model and the final results could be biased in an unmeasurable way . alternatively , the intrinsic cmb can be removed by subtracting the highest resolution map , conveniently degraded , from the other maps .",
    "both techniques have different systematics and the consistency of the results would be a test of their validity .",
    "therefore , we shall carry out two type of simulations , depending on what data sets become available : ( a ) cmb subtraction in the toi plus foreground removal using templates would produce maps with only instrumental noise , ksz and tsz with some unknown levels of primordial cmb and foreground residuals .",
    "deviations from adiabatic evolution can be measured by taking ratios of temperature anisotropies at different frequencies ( fig  [ fig1]a ) or by fitting the spectral dependence @xmath60 ( fig  [ fig1]b ) to the data .",
    "( b ) the component separation takes place on the final maps .",
    "the primordial cmb is removed using the foreground clean 217ghz map .",
    "we degrade the angular resolution of the 217ghz channel to that of the other 5 channels before subtracting it from the corresponding map .",
    "we checked that the intrinsic cmb and ksz anisotropies are removed exactly but the frequency dependence of the tsz effect is modified . in fig",

    "with respect to the fit method , we do not measure @xmath49 directly but @xmath64 . to measure the spectral shape from the data we need an independent determination of @xmath65 using x - ray data .",

    "our cluster sample contains 623 clusters outside wmap kp0 mask .",
    "it was created combining the rosat - eso flux limited x - ray catalog ( reflex , bhringer et al 2004 ) in the southern hemisphere , the extended brightest cluster sample ( ebcs , ebeling et al 1998 , ebeling et al 2000 ) in the north , and the clusters in the zone of avoidance ( ciza , ebeling , mullis & tully 2002 , kocevski et al 2007 ) sample along the galactic plane .",

    "these data allows to compute the comptonization parameter at the center of the cluster .",
    "atrio - barandela et al ( 2008 ) compared the tsz predicted from the x - ray data with the signal present in wmap 3yr data and found it to be in good agreement within the x - ray emitting region , where the @xmath68 model is a good description of the electron distribution . in the cluster outskirts , the tsz signal was systematically higher than the measured value .",
    "the latter was consistent with the komatsu & seljak ( 2002 ) profile , where baryons are in hydrostatic equilibrium within a dark matter halo well described by a navarro - frenk - white profile ( hereafter nfw , navarro , frenk & white 1997 ) , as expected in the concordance @xmath70cdm model .",

    "[ fig7]c the dashed line corresponds to simulation type b. the value of @xmath0 averaged over all simulations is @xmath146 . in this case , the larger uncertainty reflects the weak dependence of the ratio method with @xmath0 , as shown in fig  [ fig2]a .",
    "finally , we also checked that ratios using lower resolution maps have less statistical power to constrain @xmath0 .",
    "in retrospect , this justifies neglecting the 30 , 545 and 857ghz channels , with large noise levels or ( 1/f ) contributions , that would complicate the analysis without adding more information .",

    "in ( a ) we plot the likelihood function for three different frequencies : 44ghz ( dashed ) , 100 ghz ( solid ) and 343ghz ( dot - dashed line ) .",
    "the figure shows that the 100ghz channel is the most restrictive of the three . like for the ratio method ,",
    "the final likelihood is dominated by the channels that have high resolution and low noise , in this case the 100 and 143ghz channels . in fig .",
    "[ fig8]b we represent the likelihood for the three mass bins given above and marginalized over frequencies ; dashed , dot - dashed and solid lines correspond to the low , intermediate and high mass intervals .",
    "the signal is dominated by the most massive clusters that , on a flux limited sample , are on average at high redshift than the lower and intermediate mass samples . for this particular realization ,",
    "the estimated value is @xmath147 , compatible with adiabatic evolution at the @xmath148 level .    in fig .",
    "[ fig8]c we represent the histograms of 1,000 simulations together with their linear fits for cluster templates constructed using the universal pressure profile ( dot - dashed line ) and the @xmath80 ( solid line ) . the mean and rms dispersion of the estimated values are @xmath149 for the universal profile and @xmath150 for the @xmath68-model profile . when all cluster properties are identical , the tsz integrated over the cluster extent will be larger for the @xmath68-model than for the universal profile ( see fig  [ fig3]a ) so it must constrain @xmath0 better , as shown .",
    "we also carried out 1,000 simulations using method a , that does not include the intrinsic cmb signal , with the hydrodynamical template , that contains the ksz component .",
    "the result was @xmath151 , identical to the result with the method b above .",
    "therefore , in the fit method is not so important to have maps with the cosmological signal removed as , for example , in the ratio method . using the 217ghz map to remove the intrinsic cmb signal alters the tsz frequency dependence , but the tsz signal is still strongly dependent with redshift ( see figs .",
    "[ fig1]b and [ fig2]b ) what is not the case in the ratio method ( compare figs .",
    "[ fig1]a and [ fig2]a ) .",
    "let us remark that the rms dispersion of @xmath0 on 1,000 simulations , @xmath152 , is very similar to the error on @xmath0 in one single realization , both in the ratio and in the fit method , indicating that our pipelines are efficient .",
    "the results obtained using y - maps constructed with clusters drawn from a hydrodynamical simulation or from a catalog of x - ray selected clusters show no significant differences . in the hydro - simulation ,",
    "the y - map integrates the sz signal up to @xmath86 and contains all the projection effects up to that redshift , not included in the x - ray selected clusters template , we can conclude that projection effects play no significant role .",
    "this can be understood in the light of the results presented in fig  [ fig8]b ; the full likelihood is dominated by the most massive clusters for which projection effects are not significant ( valente et al 2012 ) .",
    "planck offers an excellent opportunity to constrain the evolution history of the cmb blackbody temperature with better precision than quasar excitation lines using currently available x - ray cluster catalogs .",
    "we have found that taking the ratio of temperature anisotropies at different frequencies is strongly biased but this bias can be corrected by rejecting all ratios where the denominator is much smaller than the noise . fitting the frequency dependence provides an equally reliable estimator with different systematics but requires both an independent determination of the comptonization parameter and deconvolution of the antenna beam .",
    "the latter can not be done exactly if the cluster pressure profile is not known precisely .",
    "we have shown that deconvolution using linear fits introduces an error that can be easily incorporated into the analysis .",
    "we have considered two possible methods to remove foregrounds and the cosmological cmb signal and the ksz contribution : the cosmological signal is removed in the toi and the 217ghz map is used to remove the cosmological and ksz signal exactly .",
    "we have carried out simulations of both methods to investigate the differences on the final results .",
    "we have shown that the ratio method performs rather well if the cosmological cmb signal is clean in the toi but very badly otherwise .",
    "the fit method performs equally well in both data sets , giving results that are only marginally biased . with both methods , massive clusters and the high resolution / low noise channels have the largest statistical power to constrain @xmath0",
    "we have used a proprietary cluster catalog that contains spectroscopic redshifts and all the required x - ray information to estimate the accuracy that would be achieved with planck data .",
    "we forecast that the final uncertainty will be about @xmath153 a factor 2 - 3 better than those obtained from quasar spectra by noterdaeme et al ( 2010 ) , depending on what type of planck data becomes publicly available .",
    "since our catalog is restricted to clusters with @xmath154 , we have not extended our analysis beyond that redshift .",
    "planck has already detected around 200 clusters with a @xmath155 , one at @xmath156 with @xmath157 .",
    "adding more clusters with current or future experiments will help to detect possible deviations from adiabatic evolution , specially if clusters are of higher mass and are at a higher redshift like the one recently reported in planck collaboration 2011c .",
