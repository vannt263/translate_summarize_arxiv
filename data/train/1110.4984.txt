    "the problem of computing integrals with respect to gibbs measures occurs in chemistry , physics , statistics , engineering and elsewhere . in many situations ,",
    "there are no viable alternatives to methods based on monte carlo . given an energy potential ,",
    "there are standard methods to construct a markov process whose unique invariant distribution is the associated gibbs measure , and an approximation is given by the occupation or empirical measure of the process over some finite time interval @xcite",
    ". however , a weakness of these methods is that they may be slow to converge .",
    "this happens when the dynamics of the process do not allow all important parts of the state space to communicate easily with each other . in large scale applications",
    "this occurs frequently , since the potential function often has complex structures involving multiple deep local minima .",
    "an interesting method called parallel tempering  has been designed to overcome some of the difficulties associated with rare transitions @xcite . in this technique ,",
    "simulations are conducted in parallel at a series of temperatures .",
    "this method does not require detailed knowledge of or intricate constructions related to the energy surface and is a standard method for simulating complex systems . to illustrate the main idea",
    ", we first discuss the diffusion case with two temperatures .",
    "discrete time models will be considered later in the paper , and there are obvious analogues for discrete state systems .",
    "suppose that the probability measure of interest is @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is the temperature and @xmath2 is the potential function .",
    "the normalization constant of this distribution is typically unknown . under suitable conditions on @xmath3",
    ", @xmath4 is the unique invariant distribution of the solution to the stochastic differential equation @xmath5 where @xmath6 is a @xmath7-dimensional standard wiener process .",
    "a straightforward monte carlo approximation to @xmath4 is the empirical measure over a large time interval of length @xmath8 , namely , @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the dirac measure at @xmath11 and @xmath12 denotes a burn - in  period .",
    "when @xmath3 has multiple deep local minima and the temperature @xmath1 is small , the diffusion @xmath13 can be trapped within these deep local minima for a long time before moving out to other parts of the state space . this is the main cause for the inefficiency .",
    "now consider a second , larger temperature @xmath14 .",
    "if @xmath15 and @xmath16 are independent wiener processes , then of course the empirical measure of the pair @xmath17 gives an approximation to the gibbs measure with density@xmath18 the idea of parallel tempering is to allow swaps  between the components @xmath19 and @xmath20 . in other words , at random times the @xmath19 component is moved to the current location of the @xmath20 component , and vice versa .",
    "swapping is done according to a state dependent intensity , and so the resulting process is actually a markov jump diffusion .",
    "the form of the jump intensity can be selected so that the invariant distribution remains the same , and thus the empirical measure of @xmath19 can still be used to approximate @xmath4 .",
    "specifically , the jump intensity or swapping intensity is of the metropolis form @xmath21 , where@xmath22 and @xmath23 is a constant .",
    "note that the calculation of @xmath24 does not require the knowledge of the normalization constant .",
    "a straightforward calculation shows that @xmath25 is the stationary density for the resulting process for all values of @xmath26 [ see ( [ eqn : echeverria ] ) ] .",
    "we refer to @xmath26 as the swap rate ,  and note that as @xmath26 increases , the swaps become more frequent .",
    "the intuition behind parallel tempering is that the higher temperature component , being driven by a wiener process with greater volatility , will move more easily between the different parts of the state space .",
    "this ease - of - movement  is transferred to the lower temperature component via the swapping mechanism so that it is less likely to be trapped in the deep local minima of the energy potential .",
    "this , in turn , is expected to lead to more rapid convergence of the empirical measure to the invariant distribution of the low temperature component .",
    "there is an obvious extension to more than two temperatures .",
    "although this procedure is remarkably simple and needs little detailed information for implementation , relatively little is known regarding theoretical properties .",
    "a number of papers discuss the efficiency and optimal design of parallel tempering @xcite .",
    "however , most of these discussions are based on heuristics and empirical evidence . in general ,",
    "some care is required to construct schemes that are effective .",
    "for example , it can happen that for a given energy potential function and swapping rate , the probability for swapping may be so low that it does not significantly improve performance .",
    "there are two aims to the current paper .",
    "the first is to introduce a performance criteria for monte carlo schemes of this general kind that differs in some interesting ways from traditional criteria , such as the magnitude of the sub - dominant eigenvalue of a related operator @xcite .",
    "more precisely , we use the theory of large deviations to define a rate of convergence  for the empirical measure .",
    "the key observation here is that this rate , and hence the performance of parallel tempering , is monotonically increasing with respect to the swap rate @xmath26 .",
    "traditional wisdom in the application of parallel tempering has been that one should not attempt to swap too frequently .",
    "while an obvious reason is that the computational cost for swapping attempts might become a burden , it was also argued that frequent swapping would result in poor sampling . for a discussion on prior approaches to the question of how to set the swapping rate and an argument in favor of frequent swapping , see @xcite .",
    "the use of this large deviation criteria and the resulting monotonicity with respect to @xmath26 directly suggest the second aim , which is to study parallel tempering in the limit as @xmath27 .",
    "note that the computational cost due just to the swapping will increase without bound , even on bounded time intervals , when @xmath27 .",
    "however , we will construct an alternative scheme , which uses different process dynamics and a weighted empirical measure . because this process no longer swaps particle positions",
    ", it and the weighted empirical measure have a well - defined limit as @xmath28 which we call infinite swapping . in effect",
    ", the swapping is achieved through the proper choice of weights and state dependent diffusion coefficients .",
    "this is done for the case of both continuous and discrete time processes with multiple temperatures .",
    "an outline of the paper is as follows . in the next section the swapping model in continuous time",
    "is introduced and the rate of convergence , as measured by a large deviations rate function , is defined . the alternative scheme which is equivalent to swapping but which has a well defined limit is introduced , and its limit as @xmath27 is identified .",
    "the following section considers the analogous limit model for more than two temperatures , and discusses certain practical difficulties associated with direct implementation when the number of temperatures is not small .",
    "the continuous time model is used for illustration because both the large deviation rate and the weak limit of the appropriately redefined swapping model take a simpler form than those of discrete time models . however , the discrete time model is what is actually implemented in practice . to bridge the gap between continuous time diffusion models and discrete time models , in section 4 we discuss the idea of infinite swapping for continuous time markov jump processes and prove that the key properties demonstrated for diffusion models hold here as well .",
    "we also state a uniform ( in the swapping parameter ) large deviation principle .",
    "the discrete time form actually used in numerical implementation is presented in section 5 .",
    "section 6 returns to the issue of implementation when the number of temperatures is not small .",
    "in particular , we resolve the difficulty of direct implementation of the infinite swapping models via approximation by what we call partial infinite swapping models .",
    "section 7 gives numerical examples , and an appendix gives the proof of the uniform large deviation principle .",
    "although the implementation of parallel tempering uses a discrete time model , the motivation for the infinite swapping limit is best illustrated in the setting where the state process is a continuous time diffusion process .",
    "it is in this case that the large deviation rate function , as well as the construction of a process that is distributionally equivalent to the infinite swapping limit , is simplest . in order to minimize the notational overhead",
    ", we discuss in detail the two temperature case .",
    "the extension to models with multiple temperatures is obvious and will be stated in the next section .",
    "let @xmath29 denote the markov jump diffusion process of parallel tempering with swap rate @xmath26 .",
    "that is , between swaps ( or jumps ) , the process follows the diffusion dynamics ( [ eq : two_temp_diff ] ) .",
    "jumps occur according to the state dependent intensity function @xmath30 . at a jump time",
    "@xmath31 , the particles swap locations , that is , @xmath32 . hence for a smooth functions @xmath33 the infinitesimal generator of the process is given by@xmath34",

    "we also assume the growth condition @xmath38 this condition not only ensures the existence and uniqueness of the invariant distribution , but also enforces the exponential tightness needed for the large deviation principle for the empirical measures .",
    "recall the definition of @xmath25 in ( [ eq : two_temp_dens ] ) and let @xmath4 be the corresponding gibbs probability distribution , that is , @xmath39 straightforward calculations show that for any smooth function @xmath40 which vanishes at infinity@xmath41 since the condition ( [ eq : growth_rate ] ) implies that @xmath42 as @xmath43 , by the echeverria s theorem ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 4.9.17 ) , @xmath4 is the unique invariant probability distribution of the process @xmath29 .",
    "it follows from the previous discussion and the ergodic theorem @xcite that , for a fixed burn - in time @xmath44 , with probability one@xmath45 as @xmath46 . for notational simplicity",
    "we assume without loss of generality that @xmath47 from now on .",
    "a basic question of interest is how rapid is this convergence , and how does it depend on the swap rate @xmath26 ?",
    "in particular , what is the rate of convergence of the lower temperature marginal ?",
    "we note that standard measures one might use for the rate of convergence , such as the second eigenvalue of the associated operator , are not necessarily appropriate here .",
    "they only provide indirect information on the convergence properties of the empirical measure , which is the quantity of interest in the monte carlo approximation .",
    "such measures properly characterize the convergence rate of the transition probability @xmath48 as @xmath49 .",
    "however , they neglect the time averaging effect of the empirical measure , an effect that is not present with the transition probability .",
    "in fact , it is easy to construct examples such as nearly periodic markov chains for which the second eigenvalue suggests a slow convergence when in fact the empirical measure converges quickly @xcite .",
    "another commonly used criterion for algorithm performance is the notion of asymptotic variance @xcite . for a given functional @xmath33",
    ", one can establish a central limit theorem which asserts that as @xmath46 @xmath50   \\rightarrow\\sigma^{2}.\\ ] ] the magnitude of @xmath51 is used to measure the statistical efficiency of the algorithm . the asymptotic variance is closely related to the spectral properties of the underlying probability transition kernel @xcite .",
    "however , as with the second eigenvalue the usefulness of this criterion for evaluating performance of the empirical measure @xmath52 is not clear .    in this paper",
    ", we use the large deviation rate function to characterize the rate of convergence of a sequence of random probability measures . to be more precise , let @xmath53 be a polish space , that is , a complete and separable metric space",
    ". denote by @xmath54 the space of all probability measures on @xmath55 .",
    "we equip @xmath54 with the topology of weak convergence , though one can often use the stronger @xmath56-topology @xcite . under the weak topology ,",
    "@xmath54 is metrizable and itself a polish space .",
    "note that the empirical measure @xmath52 is a random probability measure , that is , a random variable taking values in the space @xmath54 .",
    "a sequence of random probability measures @xmath57 is said to satisfy a large deviation principle ( ldp ) with rate function @xmath58 $ ] , if for all open sets @xmath59 @xmath60 for all closed sets @xmath61@xmath62 and if @xmath63 is compact in @xmath54 for all @xmath64 .    for our problem",
    "all rate functions encountered will vanish only at the unique invariant distribution @xmath4 , and hence give information on the rate of convergence of @xmath52 .",
    "a larger rate function will indicate faster convergence , though this is only an asymptotic statement valid for sufficiently large @xmath8 .",
    "the large deviation theory for the empirical measure of a markov process was first studied in @xcite .",
    "besides the feller property , which will hold for all processes we consider , the validity of the ldp depends on two types of conditions .",
    "one is a so - called transitivity condition , which requires that there are times @xmath65 and @xmath66 such that for any @xmath67,@xmath68 where @xmath69 indicates that the measure in @xmath70 on the left is absolutely continuous with respect to the measure on the right . for the jump diffusion process",
    "we consider here , this condition holds automatically since @xmath71 is bounded on bounded sets , @xmath24 is bounded , and the diffusion coefficients are uniformly non - degenerate .",
    "the second type of condition is one that enforces a strong form of tightness , such as ( [ eq : growth_rate ] ) .    under condition ( [ eq :",
    "growth_rate ] ) , the ldp holds for @xmath72 and the rate function , denoted by @xmath73 , takes a fairly explicit form because the process is in continuous time and reversible @xcite .",
    "we will state the following result and omit the largely straightforward calculation since its role here is motivational .",
    "[ a uniform ldp for the analogous jump markov process will be stated in section 4 , and its proof is given in the appendix . ]",
    "let @xmath74 be a probability measure on @xmath75 with smooth density .",
    "define @xmath76(x_{1},x_{2})$ ] .",
    "then @xmath77 can be expressed as@xmath78 where @xmath79   \\nu(dx_{1}dx_{2})\\\\ j_{1}(\\nu )   &   = \\int_{\\mathbb{r}^{d}\\times\\mathbb{r}^{d}}g(x_{1},x_{2})\\ell\\left (   \\sqrt{\\frac{\\theta(x_{2},x_{1})}{\\theta(x_{1},x_{2})}}\\right ) \\nu(dx_{1}dx_{2}),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and where @xmath80 for @xmath81 is familiar from the large deviation theory for jump processes .",
    "the key observation is that the rate function @xmath77 is affine in the swapping rate @xmath26 , with @xmath82 the rate function in the case of no swapping .",
    "furthermore , @xmath83 with equality if and only if @xmath84 for @xmath74-a.e .",
    "this form of the rate function , and in particular its monotonicity in @xmath26 , motivates the study of the _ infinite swapping limit _ as @xmath27 .    [",

    "_      from a practical perspective , it may appear that there are limitations on how much benefit one obtains by letting @xmath27 . when implemented in discrete time",
    ", the overall jump intensity corresponds to the generation of roughly @xmath26 independent random variables that are uniform on @xmath90 $ ] for each corresponding unit of continuous time , and based on each uniform variable a comparison is made to decide whether or not to make the swap . hence even for fixed and finite @xmath8 , the computations required to simulate a single trajectory scale like @xmath26 as @xmath27 .",
    "thus it is of interest if one can gain the benefit of the higher swapping rate without all the computational burden .",
    "this turns out to be possible , but requires that we view the prelimit processes in a different way .",
    "it is clear that the processes @xmath29 are not tight as @xmath27 , since the number of discontinuities of size @xmath91 will grow without bound in any time interval of positive length . in order to obtain a limit , we consider alternative processes defined by@xmath92 where @xmath93 is a jump process that switches from state @xmath94 to state @xmath95 with intensity @xmath96 and from state @xmath95 to state @xmath94 with intensity @xmath97 . compared to conventional parallel tempering , the processes @xmath98 swap the diffusion coefficients at the jump times rather than the physical locations of two particles with constant diffusion coefficients .",
    "for this reason , we refer to the solution to ( [ eq : prelimit_swap ] ) as the _ temperature swapped process , _ in order to distinguish it from the _ particle swapped process _",
    "we illustrate these processes in figure [ fig:2_temp ] .",
    "note that the solid line and the dotted line represent @xmath99 and @xmath100 , respectively .",
    "these processes have more and more frequent jumps of size @xmath91 as @xmath27 . in contrast , the process @xmath98 have varying diffusion coefficient .",
    "the figure attempts to also suggest features of the discrete time setting , with both successful and failed swap attempts .",
    "swapfig1.eps    clearly the empirical measure of @xmath98 does not provide an approximation to @xmath4 . instead , we should shift attention between @xmath98 and @xmath101 depending on the value of @xmath93 .",
    "indeed , the random probability measures@xmath102   dt \\label{eq : pre_emp}\\ ] ] have the same distribution as @xmath103 and hence converge to @xmath4 at the same rate .",
    "however , these processes and measures have well defined limits in distribution as @xmath27 . more precisely , we have the following result . for the proof see @xcite .",

    "consider the prelimit processes ( [ eq : prelimit_swap ] ) .",
    "suppose that on a small time interval , the value of the slow process @xmath110 does not vary much , say @xmath111 .",
    "given the dynamics of the binary process @xmath112 , it is easy to verify that as @xmath26 tends to infinity the fractions of time that @xmath113 and @xmath114 are @xmath115 and @xmath116 , respectively .",
    "this leads to the limit dynamics ( [ eq : limit_swap ] ) .",
    "when mapped back to the particle swapped process , @xmath115 and @xmath116 account for the fraction of time that @xmath117 and @xmath118 , respectively , which naturally leads to the limit weighted empirical measure ( [ eq : weighted_emp ] ) .",
    "the weights @xmath119 and @xmath120 do not depend on the unknown normalization constant , and in fact @xmath121 and @xmath122 the following properties of the limit system are worth noting .    1",
    ".   instantaneous equilibration of multiple locations .",
    "observe that the lower temperature component of this modified empirical measure ,  i.e. , the first marginal , uses contributions from both components at all times , corrected according to the weights .",

    "this is hardly surprising , since @xmath4 is the invariant distribution for the prelimit processes @xmath29 .",
    "3 .   escape from local minima .",
    "finally it is worth commenting on the behavior of the diffusion coefficients as a function of the relative positions of @xmath126 and @xmath127 on an energy landscape .",
    "recall that @xmath131 .",
    "suppose that @xmath132 is near the bottom of a local minimum ( which for simplicity we set to be zero ) , while @xmath133 is at a higher energy level , perhaps within the same local minimum .",
    "then @xmath134 thus to some degree the dynamics look like@xmath135 i.e. , the particle higher up on the energy landscape is given the greater diffusion coefficient , while the one near the bottom of the well is automatically given the lower coefficient . hence the particle which is already closer to escaping from the well",
    "is automatically given the greater noise ( within the confines of @xmath136 ) .",
    "recalling the role of the higher temperature particle is to more assiduously explore the landscape in parallel tempering , this is an interesting property .",
    "one can apply results from @xcite to show that the empirical measure of the infinite swapping limit @xmath137 satisfies a large deviation principle with rate function @xmath89 as defined in remark [ remark : limit - rate ] .",
    "however , to justify the claim that the infinite swapping model is truly superior to the finite swapping variant ( note that @xmath138 for any finite @xmath26 ) , one should establish a _ uniform _ large deviation principle , which would show that @xmath89 is the correct rate function for any sequence @xmath139 $ ] such that @xmath140 as @xmath46 .",
    "we omit the proof here , since in theorem [ thm : ldp_mp ] the analogous result will be proved in the setting of continuous time jump markov processes .",
    "in practice parallel tempering uses swaps between more than two temperatures .",
    "a key reason is that if the gap between the temperatures is too large then the probability of a successful swap under the [ discrete time version of the ] metropolis rule ( [ eq : swap_rate ] ) is far too low for the exchange of information to be effective .",
    "a natural generalization is to introduce , to the degree that computational feasibility is maintained , a ladder of higher temperatures , and then attempt pairwise swaps between particles .",
    "there are a variety of schemes used to select which pair to attempt the swap , including deterministic and randomized rules for selecting only adjacent temperatures or arbitrary pair of temperatures .",
    "however , if one were to replace any of these particle swapped processes with its equivalent temperature swapped analogue and consider the infinite swapping limit , one would get the same system of process dynamics and weighted empirical measures which we now describe .",
    "suppose that besides the lowest temperature @xmath1 ( in many cases the temperature of principal interest ) , we introduce the collection of higher temperatures @xmath141 let @xmath142 be a generic point in the state space of the process and define a product gibbs distribution with the density@xmath143 the limit of the temperature swapped processes with @xmath144 temperatures takes the form @xmath145 to define these weights @xmath146 it is convenient to introduce some new notation .",

    ", this corresponds to the event that particles initially assigned temperatures in the order @xmath158 have now been assigned the temperatures @xmath159 .",
    "the identification of the infinite swapping limit of the temperature swapped processes is very similar to that of the two temperature model in the previous section . by exploiting the time - scale separation",
    ", one can assume that in a small time interval the only motion is due to temperature swapping and the motion due to diffusion is negligible .",
    "hence the fraction of time that the permutation @xmath51 is in effect should again be proportional to the relative weight assigned by the invariant distribution to @xmath160 , that is , @xmath161 thus if @xmath162 then the fraction of time that the permutation @xmath51 is in effect is @xmath163 .",
