    "the study of low - metallicity galaxies is of considerable interest for the clues that it can provide about the first stages of galaxy formation and chemical enrichment .",
    "we would also like to know if there are any genuinely young galaxies undergoing their first episodes of star formation at low redshifts .",
    "to date , the most metal - poor systems studied have been the blue compact emission - line galaxies found in the local universe , with systems such as i zw 18 and sbs 0335 - 052w defining the low metallicity boundary with measured 12+log ( o / h ) of @xmath10 ( @xcite ) .",
    "more recently , the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) has yielded additional extremely metal - poor galaxies ( xmpgs ) ( 12+log ( o / h ) @xmath11 or @xmath12 ; @xcite ) . despite enormous efforts ,",
    "only a few dozen such xmpgs are known , all at redshift @xmath13 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "historically , objective prism surveys have been used to select emission - line galaxies for low - metallicity studies .",
    "( e.g. the hamburg qso survey @xcite and its hss sequel @xcite that discovered hs 2134 + 0400 @xcite and the kitt peak international spectroscopy survey ( kiss ; @xcite ) ) .",
    "the advantage of using the objective prism technique rather than the continuum selection , employed with the sdss @xcite or deep2 surveys @xcite , is that they have a higher efficiency and provide a more uniform selection . by comparison ,",
    "continuum / broad - band surveys have a very low yield rate ( 8 new xmpgs and 4 recovered xmpgs from an analysis of 250,000 spectra over @xmath143000 deg@xmath15 for the sdss @xcite , since low - metallicity populations in their first outburst have weak continuua and strong emission lines .",
    "an alternative method of discovering strong emission - line , low - metallicity galaxies is to use narrowband surveys .",
    "strong emission - line galaxies have historically been picked up in high-@xmath16 lyman alpha searches ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) where they have been considered contaminants .",
    "however , the low redshift emission line galaxies seen in these surveys are of great interest in their own right as we shall show in the present paper . while some spectroscopic studies have been carried out for low - redshift galaxies selected from narrowband surveys ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the small sample sizes have precluded any detailed investigation of metallicity and identification of a low - metallicity population .",
    "the narrowband method probes to much deeper limits than the objective prism surveys .",
    "this enables probing star - forming populations out to near redshift @xmath17 where the cosmic star formation rates are considerably higher .",
    "furthermore the narrow - band emission - line selection can allow us to assemble very large samples of strong - emission line objects , with a clean selection of different line types for the construction of luminosity functions .",
    "such a sample allows us to address such questions as whether there are substantial populations of strong star - forming galaxies with low metallicities among more massive galaxies .",
    "there has been considerable controversy about the interpretation of the low metallicity measurements in the blue compact galaxy samples where the ease with which gas may be ejected in these dwarf galaxies has complicated the picture ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) or , at least , resulted in identifying low metallicity systems which are not forming their first generation of stars .",
    "the identification of low metallicity galaxies  at the level of the xmpgs  among massive galaxies can provides less ambiguous examples of galaxies that are genuinely ` young ' and caught in the initial stages of star formation .",
    "current efforts to identify low metallicity galaxies from continuum selected surveys ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) have low - metallicity thresholds that are higher than this  about one - third solar ( in o / h ) . with a narrow - band selection criterion much larger emission - line samples including such low metallicity galaxies can be identified . with these large samples",
    "it is also possible to determine whether there is an observed lower metallicity threshold for such galaxies , and to estimate what the contribution of such strong star - formers might be at these epochs .    in the present work we use a number of deep , narrow - band images obtained with the suprimecam mosaic ccd camera @xcite on the subaru 8.2-m telescope to find a large sample of extreme emission - line galaxies .",
    "we first ( @xmath18 ) outline the selection criteria ( magnitude and flux thresholds ) for the target fields resulting in a sample of 542 galaxies , which we call usels ( ultra - strong emission liners ) .",
    "we then describe ( @xmath19 ) the spectroscopic followups for 161 of these galaxies using multi - object masks with the deimos spectrograph @xcite on the 10-m keck ii telescope .",
    "sample spectra for each class of object are shown .",
    "flux calibration and equivalent width distributions are presented in @xmath20 , and the resulting measured line ratios are discussed . in @xmath21 luminosity functions are constructed and star formation rates are estimated for the sample .",
    "these galaxies are estimated to contribute roughly 10% to the measured star - formation rate ( without extinction corrections ) at this epoch .",
    "analysis of the metallicities is given in @xmath22 .",
    "their morphologies and dynamical masses are discussed in @xmath23 and a final summary discussion is given in @xmath24 .",

    "the emission line sample was chosen from a set of narrow band images obtained with the suprimecam camera on the subaru 8.2-m telescope .",
    "the data were obtained in a number of runs between 2001 and 2005 under photometric or near photometric conditions .",
    "we used two @xmath14120   ( fwhm ) filters centered at nominal wavelengths of 8150     and 9140    in regions of low sky background between the oh bands .",

    "we thus employed three independent methods for the flux calibration . in ",

    "relative line fluxes can be measured from the spectra without flux calibration as long as we restrict the line measurments to over short wavelength range where the deimos response is essentially constant .",
    "for example , one can assume the response of neighboring lines ( e.g. [ o]@xmath24949 and [ o]@xmath25007 ) are the same and therefore one can measure the flux ratio without calibration . for bright galaxies , we can absolutely calibrate the fluxes by integrating spectra and equating them to subaru broadband fluxes .",
    "these line fluxes derived from the spectra are used as a check of the primary fluxes .",
    "we show that the ratio of [ o]@xmath25007/[o]@xmath24959 is indeed close to 1/3 , and that the fluxes computed from the spectra are highly consistent with the primary fluxes measured in  4.1 . in  4.3 , we show balmer flux ratios f(h@xmath6)/f(h@xmath3 ) of bright h@xmath3 emitters are close to the case b conditions , suggesting very little reddening .",
    "metallicity measurements by the direct method require four emission lines that are widely displaced over the spectral wavelength range ( [ o]@xmath2@xmath24959 , 5007 , [ o]@xmath24363 , and [ o]@xmath23727 ) . to calibrate these lines , we used neighboring balmer lines with the assumption of case b conditions , and this is described in  4.4 .      for the emission lines used to select each galaxy we may compute the equivalent widths and absolute fluxes directly from the narrow band magnitudes ( n ) and the corresponding continuum magnitudes ( c ) from our suprimecam imaging data . for example",
