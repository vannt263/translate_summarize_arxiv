    "density functional theory ( dft)@xcite with the single - particle kohn - sham ( ks ) scheme@xcite is today the most widely used approach to the electronic structure problem of real materials in both solid state physics and quantum chemistry .",
    "while properties derived from total energies ( or rather total energy differences ) are accurately predicted by dft , it is well known that dft suffers from a band gap problem implying that the single - particle ks eigenvalues can not in general be interpreted as real quasiparticle ( qp ) excitation energies . in particular , semilocal",
    "exchange - correlation functionals severely underestimate the fundamental gap of both insulators , semi - conductors , and molecules.@xcite    the hybrid@xcite and screened hybrid@xcite functionals , which admix around 25@xmath1 of the ( screened ) fock exchange with the local dft exchange , generally improve the description of band gaps in bulk semi - conductors and insulators@xcite .",
    "however , the orbital energies obtained for finite systems using such functionals still underestimate the fundamental gap , @xmath2 , ( the difference between ionization potential and electron affinity ) by up to several electron volts .",
    "in fact , for molecules the pure hartree - fock ( hf ) eigenvalues are usually closer to the true electron addition / removal energies than are the hybrid dft eigenvalues .",
    "this is because hf is self - interaction free and because screening of the exchange interaction is a relatively weak effect in molecular systems.@xcite . on the other hand , in extended systems",
    "the effect of self - interaction is less important and the long range coulomb interaction becomes short ranged due to dynamical screening . as a consequence hf breaks down in extended systems leading to dramatically overestimated band gaps and a qualitatively incorret description of metals.@xcite    the many - body gw approximation of hedin@xcite has been widely and succesfully used to calculate qp band structures in metals , semi - conductors , and insulators.@xcite the gw approximation can be viewed as hf with a dynamically screened coulomb interaction .",
    "the fact that the screening is determined by the system itself instead of being fixed a priori as in the screened hybrid schemes , suggests that the gw method should be applicable to a broad class of systems ranging from metals with strong screening to molecules with weak screening . with the entry of nanoscience",
    "the use of gw has been extended to low - dimensional systems and nanostructures@xcite and more recently even nonequilibrium phenomena like quantum transport@xcite . in view of this trend",
    "it is important to establish the performance of the gw approximation for other systems than the crystalline solids . in this work we present first - principles benchmark gw calculations for a series of small molecules . in a closely related study we compared gw and hartree - fock to exact diagonalization results for semi - empirical ppp models of conjugated molecules@xcite .",
    "the main conclusions from the two studies regarding the qualities of the gw approximation in molecular systems , are very consistent .",
    "most gw calculations to date rely on one or several approximations of more technical character .",
    "these include the plasmon pole approximation , the linearized qp equation , neglect of off - diagonal matrix elements in the gw self - energy , analytic continuations from the imaginary to the real frequency axis , neglect of core states contributions to the self - energy , neglect of self - consistency .",
    "the range of validity of these approximations has been explored for solid state systems by a number of authors@xcite , however , much less is known about their applicability to molecular systems@xcite .",
    "our implementation of the gw method avoids all of these technical approximations allowing for a direct and unbiased assessment of the gw approximation itself .",
    "here we report on single - shot g@xmath0w@xmath0 and fully self - consistent gw calculations of qp energies for a set of 33 molecules .",
    "the calculated ips are compared with experimental values as well as single - particle eigenvalues obtained from hartree - fock and dft - pbe / pbe0 theories . as additional benchmarks we compare to second - order mller - plesset ( mp2 ) and dft - pbe total energy differences between the neutral and cation species .",
    "special attention is paid to the effect of selfconsistency in the gw self - energy and the role of the initial green function , @xmath3 , used in one - shot g@xmath0w@xmath0 calculations .",
    "the use of paw rather than pseudopotentials facilitate the inclusion of core - valence exchange , which we find can contribute significantly to the hf and gw energies .",
    "our results show that the gw approximation yields accurate single - particle excitation energies for small molecules improving both hybrid dft and full hartree - fock results .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec.method ] we describe the theoretical and numerical details behind the gw calculations , including the augmented wannier function basis set , the self - consistent solution of the dyson equation , and the evaluation of valence - core exchange within paw . in sec . [ sec.results ] we discuss and compare the results of g@xmath0w@xmath0 , gw , hf , pbe0 , and pbe calculations .",
    "we analyze the role of dynamical screening , and discuss the effect of self - consistency in the gw self - energy .",
    "we conclude in sec .",
    "[ sec.conclusions ] .",
    "for the gw calculations we apply a basis set consisting of projected wannier functions ( pwf ) augmented by numerical atomic orbitals ( nao ) .",
    "the pwfs , @xmath4 , are obtained by maximizing their projections onto a set of target naos , @xmath5 , subject to the condition that they span the set of occupied eigenstates , @xmath6 .",
    "thus we maximize the functional @xmath7 subject to the condition @xmath8 as described in ref .  .",
    "the target naos are given by @xmath9 where @xmath10 is a modified gaussian which vanish outside a specified cut - off radius , and @xmath11 are the spherical harmonics corresponding to the valence of atom @xmath12 .",
    "the number of pwfs equals the number of target naos .",
    "for example we obtain one pwf for h ( @xmath13 ) , and four pwfs for c ( @xmath14 ) .",
    "the pwfs mimick the target atomic orbitals but in addition they allow for an _ exact _ representation of all the occupied molecular eigenstates .",
    "the latter are obtained from an accurate real - space paw - pbe calculation@xcite .",
    "the pwfs obtained in this way provide an exact representation of the occupied pbe eigenstates .",
    "however , this does not suffice for gw calculations because the polarizability , @xmath15 , and the screened interaction , @xmath16 , do not live in this subspace .",
    "hence we augment the pwfs by additional naos including so - called polarization functions which have @xmath17 and/or extra radial functions ( zeta functions ) for the valence atomic orbitals . for more details on the definition of polarization- and higher zeta functions we refer to ref . .",
    "to give an example , a double - zeta - polarized ( dzp ) basis consists of the pwfs augmented by one set of naos corresponding to @xmath18 and one set of polarization orbitals .",
    "note that the notation , sz , szp , dz , dzp , etc .",
    ", is normally used for pure nao basis sets , but here we use it to denote our augmented wannier basis set .",
    "we find that the augmented wannier basis is significantly better for hf and gw calculations than the corresponding pure nao basis .",
    "the gw and hf calculations presented in sec . [ sec.results ] were performed using a dzp augmented wannier basis .",
    "this gives a total of 5 basis functions per h , li , and na , and 13 basis functions for all other chemical elements considered . in sec .",
    "[ sec.conv ] we discuss convergence of the gw calculations with respect to the size of the augmented wannier basis .      the hf and gw calculations for isolated molecules are performed using a green function code developed for quantum transport.@xcite in principle , this scheme is designed for a molecule connected to two electrodes with different chemical potentials @xmath19 and @xmath20 .",
    "however , the case of an isolated molecule can be treated as a special case by setting @xmath21 and modelling the coupling to electrodes by a constant imaginary self - energy , @xmath22 .",
    "the chemical potential @xmath23 is chosen to lie in the homo - lumo gap of the molecule and the size of @xmath24 , which provides an artifical broadening of the discrete levels , is reduced until the results have converged . in this limit of small @xmath24",
    "the result of the gw calculation becomes independent of the precise position of @xmath23 inside the gap .    in ref .",
    "the gw - transport scheme was described for the case of an orthogonal basis set and for a truncated , two - index coulomb interaction .",
    "below we generalize the relevant equations to the case of a non - orthogonal basis and a full four - index coulomb interaction",
    ". some central results of many - body perturbation theory in a non - orthogonal basis can be found in ref . .",

    "the latter depends on the green function and therefore eq . ( [ eq.gr ] ) must in principle be solved self - consistently in conjuction with the self - energy .    in the present study @xmath33",
    "is either the bare exchange potential or the gw self - energy . to be consistent with",
    "the code used for the calculations , we present the equations for the gw self - energy on the so - called keldysh contour . however , under the equilibrium conditions considered here the keldysh formalism is equivalent to the ordinary time - ordered formalism .",
    "the gw self - energy is defined by @xmath34 where @xmath35 and @xmath36 are times on the keldysh contour , @xmath37 .",
    "the dynamically screened coulomb interaction obeys the dyson - like equation @xmath38 and the polarization bubble is given by @xmath39 in the limit of vanishing polarization , @xmath40 , @xmath16 reduces to the bare coulomb interaction @xmath41 and the gw self - energy reduces to the exchange potential of hf theory .    from the above equations for the contour - ordered quantities ,",
    "the corresponding real time components , i.e. the retarded , advanced , lesser , and greater components , can be obtained from standard conversion rules@xcite . for completeness",
    "we give the expressions for the real time components of the gw equations in appendix [ sec : gwselfenergy ] .",
    "the time / energy dependence of the dynamical quantities @xmath42 , @xmath16 , @xmath15 , and @xmath43 , is represented on a uniform grid .",
    "we switch between time and energy domains using the fast fourier transform in order to avoid time consuming convolutions . a typical energy grid used for the gw calculations in this work ranges from -150 to 150 ev with a grid spacing of 0.02 ev .",
    "the code is parallelized over basis functions and energy grid points .",
    "we use a pulay mixing scheme for updating the green function @xmath25 when iterating eq . to self - consistency as described in ref . .",
    "we stress that no approximation apart from the finite basis set is made in our implementation of the gw approximation .",
    "in particular the frequency dependence is treated exactly and analytic continuations from the imaginary axis are avoided since we work directly on the real frequency / time axis .",
    "the price we pay for this is the large size of the energy grid .",

    "fortunately the matrix is to a large degree dominated by negligible elements . to systematically define the most significant coulomb elements",
    ", we use the product basis technique of aryasetiawan and gunnarsson @xcite . in this approach , the pair orbital overlap matrix @xmath54 where @xmath55 is used to screen for the significant elements of @xmath56 .",
    "the eigenvectors of the overlap matrix eq . represents a set of `` optimized pair orbitals '' and the eigenvalues their norm .",
    "optimized pair orbitals with insignificant norm must also yield a reduced contribution to the coulomb matrix , and are omitted in the calculation of @xmath56 .",
    "we limit the basis for @xmath56 to optimized pair orbitals with a norm larger than @xmath57 .",
    "this gives a significant reduction in the number of coulomb elements that needs to be evaluated , and it reduces the matrix size of @xmath58 and @xmath59 correspondingly , see appendix [ sec : gwselfenergy ] .",
    "the evaluation of the double integral in eq . is efficiently performed in real space by solving a poisson equation using multigrid techniques@xcite .",
    "all inputs to the gw / hf calculations , i.e. the selfconsistent kohn - sham hamiltonian , @xmath30 , the xc potential @xmath60 , the coulomb matrix elements , @xmath53 , are calculated using the real - space paw@xcite code gpaw@xcite .    in gpaw , the core electrons ( which are treated scalar - relativistically ) are frozen into the orbitals of the free atoms , and the kohn - sham equations are solved for the valence states only .",
    "unlike pseudo potential schemes , these valence states are subject to the full potential of the nuclei and core electrons .",
    "this is achieved by a partitioning scheme , where quantities are divided into pseudo components augmented by atomic corrections .",
    "the operators obtained from gpaw are thus full - potential quantities , and the wave functions from which the wannier basis functions are constructed correspond to the all - electron valence states . ref . describes how the all - electron coulomb elements can be determined within the paw formalism .",
    "since both core and all - electron valence states are available in the paw method , we can evaluate the contribution to the valence exchange self - energy coming from the core electrons .",
    "as the density matrix is simply the identity matrix in the subspace of atomic core states , this valence - core exchange reads @xmath61 where @xmath62 represent valence basis functions .",
    "we limit the inclusion of valence - core interactions to the exchange potential , neglecting it in the correlation .",
    "this is reasonable , because the polarization bubble , @xmath15 , involving core and valence states will be small due to the large energy difference and small spatial overlap of the valence and core states .",
    "this procedure was used and validated for solids in ref . .",
    "we find that the elements of @xmath63 can be significant  on average 1.2 ev for the homo  and are larger ( more negative ) for the more bound orbitals which have larger overlap with the core states .",
    "in general , the effect on the homo - lumo gap is to enlarge it , on average by 0.4 ev because the more bound homo level is pushed further down than the less bound lumo state . in the case of solids ,",
    "the role of valence - core interaction has been investigated by a number of authors@xcite . here the effect on the qp band gap seems to be smaller than what we find for the molecular gaps .",
    "we note that most gw calculations rely on pseudopotential schemes where these valence - core interactions are not accessible . in such codes , the xc contribution from the core electrons are sometimes estimated by @xmath64 - v_\\text{xc}[n_\\text{val}]$ ] where @xmath65 is the valence electron density , but as the local xc potential is a non - linear functional of the density , this procedure is not well justified .",
    "instead we subtract the xc potential of the full electon density @xmath49 , and add explicitly the exact exchange core contribution .",
    "in fig . [ fig.ip ] we compare the calculated homo energies with experimental ionization potentials for the 33 molecules listed in table [ tab.num ] .",
    "the geometries of the molecules , which all belong to the g2 test set , are taken from ref .  .",
    "the different homo energies correspond to : dft - pbe@xcite and dft - pbe0@xcite eigenvalues , hartree - fock eigenvalues , and fully selfconsistent gw .",
    "the gw energies are obtained from the peaks in the corresponding density of states eq .",
    "( [ eq.dos ] ) extrapolated to @xmath66 ( @xmath24 gives an artificial broadening of the delta peaks ) .",
    "( color online ) calculated negative homo energy versus experimental ionization potential .",
    "both pbe and pbe0 systematically understimates the ionization energy due to self - interaction errors while hf overestimates it slightly .",
    "the dynamical screening from the gw correlation lowers the hf energies bringing them closer to the experimental values .",
    "numerical values are listed in table [ tab.num ] . ]",
    "we stress the different meaning of fully selfconsistent gw and the recently introduced method of quasiparticle selfconsistent gw@xcite : in fully selfconsistent gw the green function obtained from dyson s equation eq .",
    "( [ eq.gr ] ) with @xmath67=\\sigma_{\\text{gw}}[g]$ ] is used to calculate the @xmath68 of the next iteration . in qp - selfconsistent",
    "gw , @xmath68 is always evaluated using a non - interacting green function and the self - consistency is obtained when the difference between the non - interacting gf and the interacting gf , is minimal .",
    "[ fig.ip ] clearly shows that both the pbe and pbe0 eigenvalues of the homo severely underestimates the ionization potential .",
    "the average deviation from the experimental values are 4.35 ev and 2.55 ev , respectively .",
    "the overestimation of the single - particle eigenvalues of occupied states is a well known problem of dft and can be ascribed to the insufficient cancellation of the self - interaction in the hartree potential.@xcite part of this self - interaction is removed in pbe0 .",
    "however , the fact that the hf results are significantly closer to experiments indicates that the 25% fock exchange included in the pbe0 is not sufficient to cure the erroneous description of ( occupied ) molecular orbitals . on the other hand pbe0 gives good results for band gaps in semi - conductors and insulators where in contrast full hartree - fock does not perform well.@xcite we conclude that the amount of fock exchange to be used in the hybrid functionals to achieve good quasiparticle energies is highly system dependent .",
    "a similar problem is encountered with self - interaction corrected exchange - correlation functionals.@xcite     the deviation of the calculated homo energy from the experimental ionization potential in gw and hf , respectively .",
    "the vertical displacement of points from the line @xmath69 gives the difference between the gw and hf energies and represents the effect of screening .",
    "notice that the gw correction is always negative ( corresponding to higher homo energy ) and that it generally overcorrects the hf energies . also notice that the gw correction is larger for molecules where hf presents the largest overestimation of the ionization potential . ]    as can be seen from fig .",
    "[ fig.ip ] , gw performs better than hartree - fock for the homo energy yielding a mean absolute error with respect to experiments of 0.5 ev compared to 0.81 ev with hartree - fock . as expected the difference between hf and gw is not large on an absolute scale ( around 1 ev on average , see table [ tab2.num ] ) illustrating the fact that screening is weak in small molecules . on a relative scale selfconsistent gw improves the agreement with experiments by almost 30% as compared to hf .    to gain more insight into the influence of screening on the orbital energies , we compare in fig .",
    "[ fig.hf_vs_gw ] the deviation of the hf and gw energies from @xmath70 .",
    "the gw self - energy can be split into the bare exchange potential and an energy - dependent correlation part @xmath71 accordingly the quasiparticle energy can be written as the bare hf energy and a correction due to the energy - dependent part of the gw self - energy ( the dynamical screening term ) @xmath72 in fig .",
    "[ fig.hf_vs_gw ] the line @xmath73 corresponds to @xmath74 , and the vertical displacement from the line thus represents the effect of screening on the calculated homo energy .",
    "we first notice that the effect of screening is to shift the homo level upwards in energy , i.e. to reduce the ionization potential .",
    "this can be understood by recalling that the hartree - fock eigenvalue represents the energy cost of removing an electron from the homo when orbital relaxations in the final state are neglected ( koopmans theorem@xcite ) . in ref .",
    "we showed , on the basis of gw and exact calculations for semi - empirical models of conjugated molecules , that @xmath75 mainly describes the orbital relaxations in the final state and to a lesser extent accounts for the correlation energy of the initial and final states .",
    "this explains the negative sign of @xmath75 because the inclusion of orbital relaxation in the final state lowers the energy cost of removing an electron .",
    "we note that this is different from the situation in extended , periodic systems where orbital relaxations vanish and the main effect of the gw self - energy is to account for correlations in the initial and final states .",

    "the quasiparticle equation ( [ eq.qpeq ] ) relies on the assumption that off - diagonal matrix elements , @xmath95 , can be neglected , and that the frequency dependence of @xmath68 can be approximated by its first order taylor expansion in a sufficiently large neighborhood of @xmath91 .",

    "as stated in the previous section the gw and g@xmath0w@xmath0(hf ) energies can be obtained either from the full spectral function or from the qp equation . in this case , returning to table [ tab.num ] , we see that g@xmath0w@xmath0(hf ) yields systematically larger ips than gw .",
    "this is easy to understand since @xmath97 describes a larger homo - lumo gap than @xmath98 , and therefore produces less screening . when the pbe rather than the hf green function is used to evaluate the gw self - energy , we find that the spectral function obtained from eq .",

    "in fact the peaks are significantly broadened by the imaginary part of @xmath68 and it becomes difficult to assign precise values to the qp energies .",
    "apart from the spectral broadening , the molecular gap is significantly reduced with respect to its value in the gw and g@xmath0w@xmath0(hf ) calculations .",

    "the problems encountered when attempting to solve the dyson equation ( [ eq.gr ] ) using the g@xmath0w@xmath0(pbe ) self - energy occur due to the large mismatch between @xmath100 and @xmath101 . on the other hand , in the qp equation , the gw self - energy is evaluated at @xmath102 rather than @xmath101 . as a consequence the unphysical broadening and overscreening is avoided and a well defined qp",

    "as the range of systems to which the gw method is being applied continues to expand it becomes important to establish its performance for other systems than the solids . in this work",
    "we have discussed benchmark gw calculations for molecular systems .",
    "the gw calculations were performed using a novel scheme based on the paw method and a basis set consisting of wannier functions augmented by numerical atomic orbitals .",
