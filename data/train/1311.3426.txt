    "versus baryon chemical potential @xmath1 .",
    ", scaledwidth=55.0% ]    the main goals of high - energy heavy - ion collision experiments are to search and study the hot and dense matter called quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) formed in these collisions  @xcite .",
    "moreover , there is a great interest in understanding the qcd phase diagram , a phase diagram for strong interactions , to the level of that for electromagnetic interactions such as water .",
    "the results from top rhic energies suggest the formation of qgp  @xcite . the focus has now shifted to study the qgp properties  @xcite and establish the qcd phase diagram . in this review",
    ", we will concentrate on the latter part which is establishing the qcd phase diagram through a dedicated program at rhic called beam energy scan program  @xcite .",
    "figure  [ fig_bes ] shows the schematic qcd phase diagram plotted as temperature @xmath2 vs. baryonic chemical potential @xmath3  @xcite .",
    "there are two main phases predicted in the qcd phase diagram : qgp and hadronic gas phase .",
    "lattice qcd calculations predict that the transition between qgp and the hadronic gas at baryonic chemical potential @xmath4 0 is a crossover  @xcite . at large @xmath1",
    ", the transition between qgp and hadron gas is expected to be a first order phase transition  @xcite .",
    "subsequently , the end - point of this first - order phase transition line ( while going towards the crossover ) would be the position of a critical point  @xcite . while there is a little guidance from the theory side about the qcd phase diagram , efforts are ongoing from the experimental side to establish some of its distinct structures such as phase boundary between de - confined phase of quarks and gluons and hadron gas phase , first - order phase transition line , and the critical point .",
    "experimentally , the two axes : @xmath2 and @xmath3 of the qcd phase diagram can be obtained from the momentum distributions and the ratios of the produced particles in heavy - ion collisions .",
    "each collision energy corresponds to one @xmath2-@xmath3 point in the phase diagram .",
    "so , idea is to collect data at different center - of - mass energies by colliding heavy - ions .",
    "once , the @xmath2-@xmath3 point is obtained , one can look at the various signatures for the phase boundary , first - order phase transition , and the critical point .",
    "one of the interesting aspect is to locate the energy where the established signatures of the qgp ( at top rhic energy ) disappear or `` turn - off '' .",
    "this is how the rhic beam energy scan program was planned  @xcite .",
    "the proposal for the bes program was made in the year 2008 .",
    "this was followed by a successful data taking and physics analysis of a test run of au+au collisions below injection energies at @xmath0 = 9.2 gev  @xcite .",
    "the first phase of the bes program was started in the year 2010 with data taking in au+au collisions at three low energies of 7.7 , 11.5 , and 39 gev . in 2011 , two more energies at @xmath5 19.6 and 27 gev were included .",
    "table  [ ta1 ] lists various energies and corresponding number of events collected by the star detector in 20102011 for phase - i of the bes program .    [",
    "cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ ta2 ]    in addition , energy dependence of some observables suggest to have a need of one more energy point around 15 gev .",
    "for example , proton and net - proton @xmath6 slopes suggest a minimum around 11.519.6 gev as a function of energy which could be related to the softest point in equation of state .",
    "r0.6     having one more energy point in between would indicate the exact location of the minimum .",
    "similar reason ( although there is a monotonic variation as a function of beam energy at the moment ) might be argued for the freeze - out eccentricity . for net - proton higher moments , adding 15 gev along with high - statistics data at lower energies might provide the clear energy dependence trend with high significance .",
    "one more energy point at 15 gev is also important in view of the fact that the gap between 11.5 and 19.6 gev in terms of @xmath3 is more than 100 mev .    for the reasons mentioned above",
    ", rhic has decided to continue the exploration of qcd phase diagram and hence proposed a second phase of the bes program .",
    "the proposal for bes phase - ii includes high statistics data below 20 gev as listed in the table  [ ta2 ] . to achieve the high statistics data at lower energies , an electron cooling device is requested to be installed at rhic for increasing the beam luminosity  @xcite .",
    "simulation results ( see fig .  [ fig_ecool ] ) indicate that with electron cooling , a significant improvement can be made to increase luminosity ( as shown by red solid curve in the figure ) .",
    "an additional improvement in luminosity ( as shown by blue dashed curve ) may be possible by operating with longer bunches at the space - charge limit in the collider  @xcite .",
    "electron cooling may increase the luminosity by a factor of 310 and with longer bunches the luminosity may be increased by another factor of 2 - 5 .",
    "the high statistics data from bes phase - ii will not only allow the precision measurements of the important observables discussed here but will also be helpful in the measurements of rare probes such as dilepton production and hypertriton measurements at lower energies  @xcite .    to maximize the use of collisions provided at star",
    ", a fixed target proposal is made along with bes phase - ii .",
    "the idea is to install a fixed au target inside the star beam pipe to perform the au(beam)-au(target ) collisions .",
    "such collisions will provide lower reach for the center of mass energies and higher reach for the @xmath3 values for a given bes phase - ii energy .",
    "the beam energies and the @xmath3 values for the fixed target collisions are listed in the table  [ ta2 ] corresponding to the proposed bes phase - ii energies .",
    "the @xmath3 values are obtained from the parameterizations in ref .",
    "clearly , it provides an opportunity to reach the large values of @xmath3 and hence to explore the larger portion of the qcd phase diagram .",
    "one of the advantages for such a proposal is that the data taking for these fixed target collisions can be done concurrently during the normal rhic running and hence it will not affect the normal rhic operations .    these programs will also benefit from the proposed inner sector upgrade of star tpc called the itpc upgrade  @xcite . at the moment ,",
    "inner sector of the tpc has the following issues : the inner sector wires are showing the signs of ageing and unlike the outer tpc sectors , it does not have the hermetic coverage at all radii .",
    "the spacing between the rows is greater than 5 cm which results in missing rows . to overcome these issues",
    ", it has been proposed to increase the segmentation on the inner pad plane and renew the inner sector wires .",
    "simulation studies suggest that with itpc upgrade it is possible obtain better momentum resolution , better @xmath7 resolution for particle identification , and improved acceptance at higher pseudorapidity @xmath8 and low @xmath9 . at the moment ,",
    "tpc @xmath8 coverage is about @xmath10 1.0 , however , with itpc upgrade , it might reach @xmath10 1.7 .",
    "similarly , lowest @xmath9 achieved can be as low as 60 mev/@xmath11 compared to the present value of 125 mev/@xmath11 .",
    "the above listed improvements will definitely strengthen the technical aspects in the physics analyses proposed for the bes phase - ii .",
    "the bes phase - ii is expected to start around 2018 - 2019 .",
    "the bes phase - i enables rhic to cover large range of @xmath3 ( 20400 mev ) in the phase diagram . at lower energies , a centrality dependence of freeze - out parameters",
    "is observed .",
    "the observables such elliptic flow @xmath12 , nuclear modification factor @xmath13 , baryon to meson ratio @xmath14 , dynamical charge correlations , suggest that hadronic interactions dominate for @xmath15 11.5 gev or that the system did not undergo qgp phase transition at these lower energies .",
    "the ( net)-proton directed flow @xmath6 slope show interesting behavior for the energy range @xmath16 20 gev .",
    "the proton @xmath6 slope changes sign between 7.7 and 11.5 gev .",
    "the net - proton @xmath6 slope changes sign twice as a function of beam energy .",
    "both proton and net- proton @xmath6 slopes show a minimum around 11.519.6 gev .",
    "the @xmath17 and @xmath18 for net - protons show most significant deviations from skellam expectations at @xmath19 19.6 and 27 gev .",
    "bes phase - ii along with electron cooling , fixed target proposal , and itpc upgrade provides optimistic future for the exploration of the qcd phase diagram , and hence for critical point and phase boundary search .",
