    "the physics of a strongly correlated , highly anisotropic electron system represents a subtle problem in many - body physics . in previous work",
    "@xcite we have considered the problem of one - dimensional ( 1d ) electron liquids coupled by weak interliquid hopping .",
    "implicit in our approach is the recognition that if one begins with a collection of truly 1d metals and then turns on weak interliquid hopping , it is not _ a priori _ appropriate to consider the electron - electron interaction as a perturbation on an anisotropic ( 2d ) free fermi gas .",
    "rather , one should consider the _",
    "interliquid hopping _ as a perturbation on the ( otherwise decoupled ) 1d liquids .",
    "the problem is nontrivial but tractable to some degree because the low energy physics of a 1d metal is described by luttinger liquid theory . unlike in a fermi liquid , where the electron spectral function , @xmath4 is dominated by a quasiparticle part , which sharpens up to a @xmath5-function as @xmath6 , in a luttinger liquid there are no landau quasiparticles , rather , @xmath4 exhibits only power law singularities .",
    "for this reason , and others we have previously discussed @xcite , the problem of weakly coupled luttinger liquids is closely analogous to that of weak tunneling in a two level system ( tls ) coupled to an ohmic dissipative bath @xcite .",
    "exploiting this analogy led us to propose @xcite that interliquid hopping between non - fermi liquids may have three qualitatively distinct regimes : it may be irrelevant , relevant and coherent , or relevant but entirely incoherent .",
    "the incoherent interliquid hopping phase would represent a new state of matter with intrinsically incoherent transport in at least one direction .",
    "there is substantial experimental support for this proposal based on its ability to explain certain anomalous properties of the low dimensional organic conductor ( tmtsf)@xmath7pf@xmath8 , as has been discussed elsewhere @xcite . in this paper",
    "we briefly report new results which address this question based upon the use of exact luttinger liquid spectral functions , careful consideration of the analytic properties of luttinger liquid green s functions , and a reinterpretation of a calculation made by others @xcite .",
    "we are interested in the problem of @xmath9 coupled luttinger liquids , @xmath10 . at @xmath11 , however , our results are equivalent to those for @xmath12 , and we therefore consider the problem of two luttinger liquids coupled by a spatially uniform , single particle hopping ( as in @xcite ) . our calculation is dynamical and involves taking a @xmath13 state with @xmath14 more ( right moving ) particles in liquid 2 than liquid 1 and no tomonaga bosons excited in either , then turning on @xmath15 and examining the time dependence of @xmath14 ( for motivation see @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "the particle number difference @xmath14 entails a fermi momentum difference @xmath16 and a chemical potential difference @xmath17 .",
    "unlike our earlier work @xcite based upon space - time green s functions , we use spectral function methods here , which is both physically more illuminating and permits the calculation of key correlation functions _",
    "exactly_.    at @xmath11 the _ interliquid hopping rate _",
    "@xmath18 can be written in a spectral function form as @xmath19 where @xmath20 and the spectral functions @xmath21 are the fourier transforms of @xmath22 and @xmath23 . in this paper",
    "we consider only the zero temperature limit , in which case @xmath24 where @xmath4 is the electron spectral function as conventionally defined .",
    "we remark that eqs .",
    "( [ eq : gamma(t ) ] ) and ( [ eq : a s ] ) are not specific to coupled 1d liquids : they may be extended to the case of coupled 2d liquids by replacing @xmath25 by @xmath26 in the @xmath25-integrals and in the definitions of @xmath27 and @xmath28 .",
    "physically , @xmath29 is the effective interliquid hopping spectral function for an electron hopping _ to _ liquid 1 , _ from _ liquid 2 , and @xmath30 the opposite .",
    "as @xmath30 never has a coherent component , it suffices , for the purposes of studying the question of coherence , to consider only @xmath29 .    before presenting the calculation of @xmath18 for coupled luttinger liquids ,",
    "we first show how the coherence of interliquid hopping manifests itself in the case of coupled ( landau ) fermi liquids .",
    "_ free fermi gasses , and fermi liquids : _ for free fermi gasses , @xmath31 and @xmath32 .",
    "thus @xmath33 , a clear signal of coherent hopping and hence of a fundamental rearrangement of the ground state .    in a fermi liquid",
    "the ( retarded ) green s function is @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the quasiparticle renormalization factor , and @xmath36 is a ( positive ) parameter characterizing the strength of the electron - electron interactions .",
    "the spectral function is then given by @xmath37 from which we obtain @xmath38 we find that @xmath39 is a sum of a term @xmath40 representing fundamentally coherent processes , and a term @xmath41 which is marginal . by choosing a sufficiently small @xmath15 one can find a time @xmath42 such that , while remaining in the perturbative regime , @xmath43 , the ratio of the coherent contribution to the marginal contribution is arbitrarily large .",
    "this is true _ regardless of how small @xmath35 is_. thus , a perturbative calculation in @xmath15 does not reveal any likelihood of a loss of coherence of interliquid tunneling , and there is no impediment to the formation of an interliquid band of width @xmath44 .",
    "this is consistent with what we would expect from a calculation based upon ( landau ) quasiparticles .",
    "formally , the coherence is reflected in the fact that the spectral function @xmath29 is dominated by the @xmath5-function at @xmath45 , indicating that hopping is almost entirely energy degenerate .",
    "_ luttinger liquids : _ we now turn to the problem of coupled luttinger liquids , considering the case of spin - independent electronic interactions , characterized by the anomalous exponent , @xmath46 , of the single particle green s function , and charge- and spin - velocities @xmath47 and @xmath48 .",

    "@xmath29 is generically `` flat '' suggesting that much , if not most , of the hopping occurs via non - degenerate ( _ i.e. _ `` inelastic '' ) processes .",

    "there are , however , additional factors enhancing incoherence over and above the time exponent of the @xmath83 term .",
    "first , there is the `` dephasing '' prefactor @xmath75 $ ] , analogous to a bias term in a tls .",
    "based on the results from that problem @xcite , this should enhance incoherence .",
    "further , there are the incoherent processes contributing to the @xmath16-independent term . for @xmath84",
    "the interliquid hopping rate and the integrated transition probability , @xmath85 , are essentially sums of incoherent and coherent parts , defined by their respective time behaviors . due to the presence of the dephasing term ,",

    "as such , @xmath87 is bounded above in magnitude by @xmath88 so that , @xmath89 this is _ independent _ of @xmath15 and the purely incoherent channel can not be eliminated in the @xmath90 limit , as it can in a fermi liquid . as a result , we are forced to consider the influence of interliquid hops upon one another via correlations not automatically included in our @xmath11 calculation . to begin with",
    ", interliquid hops through the coherent channel will be interrupted by the finite probability of a hop through the incoherent channel .",
    "secondly , intraliquid interactions will lead to scattering of coherent hops by incoherent hops . in the limit @xmath90 ,",
    "the incoherent hops have an arbitrarily long time to scatter the coherent hops ( although their density also vanishes in this limit ) and we find that the effect of a given incoherent hop on the coherent hops grows at least linearly in time .",
    "if it grows faster than linearly , the scattering will be divergent and hopping should be incoherent as @xmath90 _ for any _ @xmath0 .    combining all of these effects , we expect that as we decrease @xmath0 from @xmath3 , incoherence will be stabilized down to some critical value @xmath91 by a combination of the purely incoherent term , the dephasing prefactor which kills coherence if @xmath92 is too large , and , in the case of fermions with spin , spin - charge separation , which further suppresses coherence for finite @xmath92 @xcite .",
    "we again emphasize the utility of the spectral function @xmath29 in indicating the coherent or incoherent nature of the interliquid hopping .",
    "we now consider how these same effects might appear in the more conventional calculation of the green s function for @xmath10 coupled luttinger liquids of spinless fermions .",
    "we will neglect vertex corrections associated with @xmath15 and incorporate @xmath93 as an energy independent self - energy .",
    "we are motivated by similar calculations by others @xcite , however we focus on analytic properties of the green s function not previously treated . using @xmath94 , @xmath95 ,",
    "gives @xmath96 where we have set the dimensionful high energy cut - off to @xmath97 and @xmath25 is momentum along the chains measured from the fermi surface .",
    ". [ eq : g ] must be supplemented by a discussion of the analytic properties of @xmath98 and @xmath99 , for whose discussion we consider only positive @xmath25 since negative @xmath25 is essentially identical for @xmath100",
    ".    first , recall that the singularities of the green s function , particularly poles , only have sensible physical interpretations in the second and fourth quadrants of the complex @xmath101 plane . for @xmath102",
    ", @xmath99 has two branch cut singularities , one for each sign of @xmath101 , which must originate in the second and fourth quadrants .",
    "also , @xmath99 must be real for @xmath103 since in that region no on - shell decay of an injected fermion is possible .",
    "this implies that the phase of @xmath99 for @xmath104 should be given by @xmath105 , and by @xmath106 for @xmath107 .",
    "now consider the pole equation , @xmath108 , for @xmath109 and @xmath110 .",
    "for @xmath111 , the pole in the complex @xmath101 plane is at @xmath93 and , as we turn on @xmath0 , it shifts into the fourth quadrant . moving off the axis into the fourth quadrant an angle @xmath112 changes the phase of @xmath113 to @xmath114 and it is again possible to have a pole if @xmath115 for small @xmath0 , this pole could be sensibly interpreted as a weakly damped quasiparticle pole , as in a usual fermi liquid .",
    "however , for @xmath71 , @xmath116 , the pole enters the fourth quadrant and the solution has no sensible interpretation as a quasiparticle pole ( it would imply an unoccupied , negative energy quasiparticle state ) .",
    "the last physical solution , which occurred for @xmath117 , corresponds to a purely imaginary frequency , entirely in keeping with the idea that @xmath15 is acting incoherently at this value of @xmath0 . for a negative @xmath15 , an exactly parallel scenario involving the second , instead of the fourth quadrant , results . in both cases , for @xmath71",
    ", there is no physically sensible pole resulting from incorporation of @xmath15 as a self - energy , and the results are extremely suggestive of incoherence .",
    "the effect is very closely analogous to the behavior of the laplace transform of @xmath118 found in @xcite at the onset of incoherence .",
    "a similar analogy between the locations of the poles of the single particle green s function approximated in this way and the laplace transform of @xmath118 in the tls problem was noted in @xcite .",
    "we now consider @xmath102 .",
    "consider first the case @xmath119 .",
    "as we move some distance away from the fermi surface , the singularity at @xmath120 becomes more distant and its effect on the phase less important .",
    "for @xmath121 , it becomes possible to circle the singularity at @xmath122 without moving appreciably with respect to the singularity at @xmath123 , and the phase of @xmath124 close to @xmath125 varies as @xmath126 where @xmath112 is measured downward from the real @xmath127 half - line .",
    "as before , at small @xmath0 the pole has a small imaginary part to its frequency and it can be sensibly interpreted as a weakly dampled quasiparticle pole . however , now @xmath0 can be as large as @xmath128 before the pole is forced into an unphysical region .",
    "note , however , that for @xmath129 , @xmath116 , so that the addition of a positive , real self energy ( @xmath15 ) shifts the singularity at @xmath122 to a complex energy with a real part _ less than _ @xmath122 . including spin - charge separation is more complicated and we state only two of our results for @xmath130 : ( 1 ) for @xmath131 , the pole lies at an energy whose real part is shifted lower than @xmath132 , and ( 2 ) for @xmath71 , and large @xmath25 the pole equation is again not satisfiable for a physically sensible @xmath101 . returning to the spinless case ,",
    "let us follow the pole for @xmath133 as we increase @xmath25 . for @xmath134",
    "this pole lies in the second quadrant and increasing @xmath25 eventually pushes it to the imaginary axis . when @xmath135 , the pole reaches @xmath136 .",
    "again , the last frequency with a possible physical interpretation is purely imaginary , paralleling what occurred for @xmath109 and @xmath117 .",
    "in addition to this pole , a new pole appears , for negative @xmath93 and @xmath137 , at @xmath138 given by the real solution of @xmath139 .",
    "this undamped pole is unphysical , however , in a number of ways .",
    "firstly , @xmath98 is purely real at the position of the pole only because there is nothing for a fermion at this momentum and energy to decay into in the unperturbed model .",
    "it is easy to see , however , that if the pole existed for @xmath25 close to @xmath140 , then there would be accessible decay channels .",
    "these are neglected by the omission of vertex corrections .",
    "secondly , for @xmath141 , this pole approaches not @xmath142 but @xmath123 ( with rapidly vanishing weight ) as @xmath54 .",
    "finally , in a spin - charge separated luttinger liquid , and at sufficiently large @xmath25 , this pole ceases to exist if @xmath143 , while for @xmath134 the pole lies just below @xmath144 . in a model with @xmath134 and vanishing spin velocity ,",
    "e.g. the large @xmath145 hubbard model , the pole is completely dispersionless along the chains .",
    "the `` quasiparticles '' defined by it have the strange property of a vanishing bandwidth in the direction of large hopping , but a finite bandwidth in the direction of small hopping !",
    "we therefore see that , for @xmath146 and when analytic properties are treated carefully , this approximate calculation of @xmath98 gives no indication of the existence of a transversely dispersing quasiparticle .",
    "this is in contrast to what has been suggested elsewhere @xcite .",
    "in fact , if the poles found off the real axis are interpreted as quasiparticle poles and the fermi surface is identified with the momenta at which the real part of their frequencies cross zero energy , then the conclusion within this approximation is that the fermi surface warping vanishes completely for @xmath117 .",
    "finally , we briefly discuss another diagrammatic calculation addressing coupled luttinger liquids . for the case of infinitely many coupled chains the behavior of @xmath147 has been studied in lowest order perturbation theory in @xmath15 by castellani _",
    "they find a shift of @xmath147 proportional to @xmath148 and interpret this as signaling the instability of the luttinger liquid .",
    "the @xmath25 behavior arises from an integral given in our language by : @xmath149 which is _ infrared convergent everywhere _ for @xmath71 .",
    "we have previously argued @xcite that the magnitude of the warping of the fermi surface should be identified with the oscillation frequency of our dynamical calculation and provides the order parameter for the transition between the phase with `` confined coherence '' and the usual phase with coherent transport in all directions . when interpreted in this context ,",
    "the finding of castellani _ et al . _",
    "@xcite , that a perturbation theory for the shifts in the fermi occupation function has a qualitative change to convergent behavior when the hopping is still relevant , supports the notion of incoherence directly .",
    "we have calculated exactly the inter - luttinger liquid hopping rate to @xmath11 . of great physical relevance",
    "is the effective spectral function for interliquid hopping , @xmath29 .",
    "we have shown that in a large region of luttinger liquid parameter space below @xmath150 ( the point where @xmath15 becomes a marginal operator ) , @xmath29 is too broad a function to sustain coherent interliquid transport .",
    "single particle coherence is confined to the one - dimensional chains , in the sense that it is impossible to observe any interference effects ( beyond those observable for completely decoupled chains ) between histories which involve interliquid hopping .",
    "again , we emphasize that this is _ not _ the result of an irrelevant @xmath15 : the _ coherence _ is confined , but the _ electrons _ are not .",
    "our proposal is supported by a careful consideration of the analytic properties of approximate single particle green s functions . even though such approximations are uncontrolled , we find no evidence in these calculations to suggest anything other than that there",
    "can exist a phase of relevant , but incoherent , interliquid transport .",
    "in fact , all of the results presented here indicate that motion of fermions transverse to the chains can be very different for different @xmath0 ( while still in the region of relevant @xmath15 ) and support the idea that the nature of the renormalization group instability of the @xmath151 fixed point can also change .",
    "this gives further evidence for the existence of a novel fixed point ( one of `` confined coherence '' ) in which transport in one or more ( but not all ) directions is _ intrinsically _ ( _ i.e. , in a pure system at zero temperature _ ) incoherent ."
