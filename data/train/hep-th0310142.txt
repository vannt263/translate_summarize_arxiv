    "this shows that the motion is confined to the plane which is spanned by the initial position and momentum vectors .",

    "from the induced metric on the brane eq .",

    "( [ eq : useful ] ) and ( [ eq : energy ] ) in the second equation and eq .",
    "( [ eq : r - dot ] ) in the last equation .",
    "thus , from eq .",
    "( [ eq : scale - factor ] ) and ( [ eq : tau ] ) , the scale factor @xmath90 can be obtained as a function of @xmath92 .    here",
    "we define two characteristic radii : gravitational radius @xmath94 and gauge - field radius @xmath95 .",
    "the former corresponds to the schwarzshild radius , @xmath96 it should be noted that , @xmath97 the latter represents the radius , below which the approximation of the lagrangian ( [ eq : lagrangian ] ) breaks down ( @xmath98 ) : @xmath99 hereafter we consider the case @xmath100 because otherwise the scale factor does not change so much in the region where the background solution is reliable ( @xmath24 ) .",
    "then let us consider a situation that the probe brane goes away from the neighborhood of the source branes ( but @xmath101 , of cource ) to infinity . when @xmath102 , the relation between the scale factor and the cosmological time is simple . in this case",
    "( [ eq : tau ] ) becomes , noting that @xmath103 and @xmath104 , @xmath105 note that this is independent on @xmath35 in this limit .",
    "first we consider the case @xmath106 .",
    "then , @xmath107 at late time ( @xmath108 ) , we obtain , @xmath109 from which the evolution of the scale factor is obtained as , @xmath110 here @xmath111 for @xmath112 .",
    "although the expansion becomes faster with smaller @xmath1 , acceleration phase can not be realized .",
    "if @xmath113 , a correction term is added , @xmath114 where @xmath115 is a constant which depends on @xmath116 and @xmath117 is , to leading term , @xmath118 where @xmath119 is also a constant which depends on @xmath116 . it should be noted that the effect of the gauge field decrease as the brane expands since its energy density decreases as @xmath120 .    when @xmath43 becomes much larger than @xmath94 , the scale factor stops to evolve and becomes almost unity .",
    "the behavior of the scale factor in the case of no gauge field is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : scale_no - gauge ] .",
    "as is expected , the scale factor evolves by power - law and then decelerate quickly to become unity .",
    "[ fig : scale_gauge ] shows the effect of the gauge field on the brane .",
    "as can be seen , the effect is very small even if @xmath77 is as large as possible and the late - time behavior is independent on the existence of the gauge field .",
    "we can also see the evolution of the scale factor by the effective friedmann equation which can be derived from eq .",
    "( [ eq : r - dot ] ) : @xmath121,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which agrees with @xcite in the limit of @xmath81 .      here",
    "we consider the probe brane to be a nambu - goto brane with gauge field and the same r - r charge as a d - brane , for which the lagrangian ( [ eq : lagrangian ] ) is exact . in this case",
    ", we can take a high - energy limit ( @xmath122 ) .",
    "although , for a d - brane , this limit is in contradiction to the approximation which we used to derive ( [ eq : lagrangian ] ) , we could still obtain tendency of high - energy effect , as is often done in higher derivative theory .",
    "in this regime , eq . ( [ eq : tau ] ) for @xmath102 becomes , @xmath123 for @xmath124 , @xmath125 then , @xmath126 where @xmath127 for @xmath128 .",
    "thus accelerating expansion is realized for @xmath129 .",
    "next , for @xmath130 , @xmath131 then , @xmath132 thus the scale factor increase exponentially . finally for @xmath133 , @xmath134 then , @xmath135 it can be easily shown that the expansion is accelerating in this case .",
    "these analyses are confirmed in fig .",
    "[ fig : scale_high - gauge ] .    as stated in the previous subsection , the energy density of the gauge field decrease as the brane expands . with the parametrization in fig .",
    "[ fig : scale_high - gauge ] , the gauge field is dominant for all over the evolution since @xmath77 is sufficiently large so that @xmath136 at infinity is still large ( @xmath137 ) . if @xmath77 is smaller than unity , late phase will behave like that of the case discussed in the previous subsection , even if accelerating expansion occurs in early phase . in fig .",
    "[ fig : scale_high - gauge_c ] , we show the cases with intermediate @xmath77 .",
    "we can see the transition from accelerating phase to decelerating phase .",
    "of course , the transition occurs earlier with smaller @xmath77 .      finally , we give the evolution of the scale factor in the einstein frame .",
    "the procedure is almost the same as in the string frame .",
    "the induced metric in the einstein frame is , @xmath138 then the cosmological time is , @xmath139 with @xmath106 , the scale factor evolves as , for @xmath140 , @xmath141 where the index is @xmath142 for @xmath112 . in high - energy limit ( @xmath122 ) , for @xmath143 , @xmath144 where @xmath145 for @xmath146 . for @xmath130 , @xmath147",
    "thus , the condition that accelerating expansion occurs is the same as in the string frame .",
    "it should be noted that the induced metric in the string frame and the einstein frame coincide with each other for @xmath130 because the dilaton ( [ eq : dilaton ] ) is constant in this case .",
    "in the previous section , we dealt with a simple situation that a probe brane goes away from the neighborhood of the source branes to infinity .",
    "if the probe brane approach the source branes , the scale factor decreases as the inverse of that in the previous section .",
    "then the other situations , for example , scattering and bound state of branes , are easy to imagine . in the former case ,",
    "the brane contracts first , then bounces and finally expands . in the latter case",
    ", the brane continues to expand and contract periodically .    in this paper , we followed the dynamics of a probe brane , that is , we neglected the back - reaction .",
    "this is justified if the probe brane is light compared to the source branes .",
    "this means @xmath148 , which we assumed in the analyses in section [ section : cosmology ] .",
    "if @xmath149 , we have to treat both branes equally and the self - gravity of the branes must be taken into account @xcite .",
    "our analysis assumes a stability of the probe brane .",
    "there are possible instabilities due to brane bending and radiation from the brane @xcite .",
    "@xcite has given a preliminary analysis on such instabilities .",
    "they have found , for @xmath68 , that the brane is stable classically against bending and that the radiation is dominated by the one into the bulk dilation field , which can be made sufficiently small by appropriate choice of the string coupling constant .",
    "one of the key assumptions they made is to treat the brane motion as non - relativistic one . in other words ,",
    "their results have been obtained in the large - separation limit : @xmath150 ( or @xmath151 in our notation ) .",
    "we obtain some of the expressions for the scale factor for @xmath152 where the relativistic treatment is necessary in strict sence but we expect that the relativistic corrections do not change the stability discussed in @xcite .",
    "recently it was shown in @xcite that time - variations in the background moduli fields generally preclude the existence of stable elliptical orbits .    finally ,",
    "although our study is based on the approximated lagrangian [ eq : lagrangian ] , it would be quite interesting and important to study the exact lagrangian",
    ". this will be our future work .",
    "in this paper , we investigated the evolution of the scale factor of a probe dp - brane which move in the background of source dp - branes .",
    "when the probe brane move away from the source branes , it expands by power law , whose index depends on the dimension of the brane . if the energy density of the gauge field on the brane is subdominant , the expansion is decelerating irrespective of the dimension of the brane . on the other hand ,",
    "when the probe brane is a nambu - goto brane , the energy density of the gauge field can be dominant , in which case accelerating expansion occurs for @xmath0 .",
    "the accelerating expansion stops when the brane has expanded sufficiently so that the energy density of the gauge field become subdominant .",
    "although this is not the case with a probe d - brane , we could still obtain tendency of high - energy effect of the born - infeld action .",
    "the system which is investigated in this paper is too simple to be our universe .",
    "however , further investigation will give understanding for the relation between superstring theory and our universe .",
