    "these equations always possess an associated linear zero curvature representation , albeit without the spectral parameter .",
    "since their introduction by weingarten  @xcite , immersed surfaces in @xmath2 that satisfy a functional relation between the principal curvatures have been of continuing interest in differential geometry , see , e.g. ,  @xcite .",
    "it is therefore not surprising that attempts have been made to identify classes of weingarten surfaces such that the corresponding gauss equation is integrable in the sense of soliton theory .",
    "the work of wu  @xcite and finkel  @xcite indicated that all integrable cases are classical , characterized by a linear relation between the gauss and the mean curvatures ( linear weingarten surfaces  @xcite ; see also  @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "in other words , the integrable weingarten surfaces were conjectured to be either minimal or parallel to surfaces of constant gaussian curvature .",
    "this conjecture was , however , disproved by the present authors in  @xcite , henceforth referred to as part  i. in part i we found another integrable class , consisting of surfaces with a constant difference between the principal radii of curvature , which we called surfaces of constant astigmatism .",

    "however , parallel surfaces can be alternatively described as normal surfaces to the same line congruence .",

    "normal congruences of weingarten surfaces , also known as @xmath276-congruences , are rather special with regard to properties of their focal surfaces .",
    "it is therefore natural to look for characterization of the former in terms of the latter .",
    "naturally , we expect the focal surfaces of integrable @xmath276-congruences to be integrable as well .",
    "recall that a generic surface has two focal surfaces ( often considered as two sheets of a single surface ) , @xmath277 each of which is formed by the evolutes of one family of the curvature lines .",
    "focal surfaces can degenerate into a line or even a point . in the case of a weingarten surface @xmath92 with fundamental forms  ,",
    "one of the focal surfaces degenerates into a line if @xmath278 or @xmath279 ; both degenerate into a point if the surface is a sphere ( already excluded from consideration ) ; otherwise they are regular surfaces . therefore",

    "these are among the classical results by weingarten  @xcite . omitting details ,",
    "we further compute the second fundamental forms @xmath291 and note that they are conformally related , which is another way to express ribaucour s classical result  @xcite that asymptotic coordinates on @xmath292 and @xmath293 correspond .",
    "the gaussian curvatures are @xmath294 consequently , the focal surfaces have one and the same sign of the gaussian curvature , which we denote as @xmath295 . we have @xmath296 ( both focal surfaces are hyperbolic ) if and only if @xmath297 ( if @xmath13 increases as @xmath14 increases ) , and @xmath298 if @xmath299 .",
    "the relation @xmath300 away of umbilic points is known as the halphen theorem ( see  @xcite ) .",
    "as we have already explained , to every particular relation @xmath44 of curvatures there corresponds an isometry class of focal surfaces , which contains a unique rotational representative ( which is the way the classes have been characterized in the classical literature ) .",
    "however , we believe that a description in terms of metric invariants is more appropriate . it is convenient to choose @xmath301 where @xmath302 is the absolute value of the gaussian curvature of the @xmath303th focal surface .",
    "further , let @xmath304 be defined by @xmath305 one can directly check that @xmath306 equals the norm of the gradient of @xmath307 with respect to  @xmath281 , @xmath308 hence , @xmath304 is a metric invariant of the respective focal surface .",

    "our nearest aim is to establish the dependence between @xmath307 and @xmath311 in terms of the dependence between @xmath13 and @xmath14 .",
    "[ prop : focal ] let the principal radii of curvature @xmath5 of an integrable surface satisfy the generic relation  .",
    "then the metric invariants @xmath311 and @xmath307 satisfy the relations @xmath312 furthermore , @xmath313 is constant ( hence , so is the product @xmath314 ) .",
    "table  [ t4 ] lists the product @xmath315 and the algebraic relations between @xmath311 and @xmath307 in the special cases .    for simplicity , we start assuming a fixed scaling , i.e. , we depart from formula  .",
    "we routinely compute @xmath316 consequently , @xmath317 , and @xmath318 furthermore , @xmath319 under the scaling by factor of @xmath183 , the metric invariants @xmath320 and @xmath307 become @xmath321 and @xmath322 , respectively , while @xmath311 remains invariant .",
    "formulas   are then easily checked .",
    "moreover , all three metric invariants are invariant under the offsetting  .    formulas for @xmath311 and @xmath307 in the special cases are given in table  [ t3 ] along with the sign @xmath295 of the gaussian curvatures .",
    "@xmath323    @xmath324    summarizing , focal surfaces of integrable weingarten surfaces belong to the isometry classes specified in proposition  [ prop : focal ] .",
    "a natural question is whether the condition @xmath325 or , equivalently , @xmath326 , is not only necessary , but also sufficient for the condition   to hold .",
    "[ prop : gg ] under the condition @xmath327 , a surface satisfies the governing equation   if and only if the product @xmath328 is constant .    assuming the @xmath44 dependence",
    ", @xmath329 simplifies to @xmath330 and the product in question to @xmath331 factorizing the @xmath14-derivative of this expression as @xmath332 and comparing to the governing equation   proves the proposition .",
    "it follows from the proof that condition   also holds when @xmath110 , i.e. , if there is a linear relation between the radii of curvature . as of now",
    ", there seems to be no indication towards integrability of the latter class ( except when @xmath333 , which satisfies   as well ) .",
    "in this work we singled out a class of weingarten surfaces on the basis of its solitonic integrability .",
    "although special cases were not unknown to nineteenth century geometers , the overall result appears to be new .",
    "we also characterized integrability in terms of metric invariants of the focal surfaces .    for time reasons ,",
    "many questions had to be left for further research .",
    "we do not know the bcklund transformation , recursion operator , bi - hamiltonian structure and other attributes of integrability .",
    "we did not provide any solutions to the gauss equation  .",
    "we do not know what is the true geometric meaning of the spectral parameter .",
    "even the task of computing third order symmetries of the gauss equation proved to be too complex .",
    "we have seen in part  i that integrability of surfaces of constant astigmatism is attributable to the fact that their focal surfaces are pseudospherical . in the general case ,",
    "the existence of an integrability - preserving relation to previously known integrable surfaces is an open problem .",
    "our nearest goals include exploring the induced bianchi type transformation between surfaces satisfying relations   as well as investigating the extended symmetries of the class in the sense of cieliski  @xcite .",
