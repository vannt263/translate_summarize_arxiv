    "our main result in this paper is that the total length @xmath6 of all external branches in kingman s coalescent with @xmath0 external branches is asymptotically normal for @xmath7 .",
    "kingman s coalescent ( 1982 ) consists of two components .",
    "first there are the coalescent times @xmath8 .",
    "they are such that @xmath9 are independent , exponential random variables with expectation 1 .",
    "second there are partitions @xmath10 of the set @xmath11 , where the set @xmath12 containes @xmath3 disjoint subsets of @xmath11 and @xmath13 evolves from @xmath12 by merging two randomly chosen elements of @xmath12 . moreover , @xmath14 and @xmath15 are independent .",
    "for convenience we put @xmath16 .    as is customary the coalescent can be represented by a tree with @xmath0 leaves labelled from 1 to @xmath0 .",
    "each of these leaves corresponds to an external branch of the tree .",
    "the other node of the branch with label @xmath17 is located at level @xmath18 within the coalescent .",
    "the length of this branch is @xmath19 , the total external length of the coalescent is given by @xmath20    this quantity is of a certain statistical interest .",
    "coalescent trees have been introduced by kingman as a model for the genealogic relationship of @xmath0 individuals , down to their most recent common ancestor .",
    "mutations can be located everywhere on the branches .",
    "then mutations on external branches affect only single individuals .",
    "this fact was used by fu and li ( 1993 ) in designing their @xmath21-statistic and providing a test whether or not data fit to kingman s coalescent .",
    "otherwise single external branches have mainly been studied in the literature .",
    "the asymptotic distribution of @xmath19 has been obtained by caliebe et al ( 2007 ) , using a representation of its laplace transform due to blum and franois ( 2005 ) .",
    "we address this issue in section [ s6 ] below .",
    "freund and mhle ( 2009 ) investigated the external branch length of the bolthausen - snitman coalescent , and gnedin et al ( 2008 ) the @xmath22-coalescent .",
    "here is our main result .",
    "[ t1 ] as @xmath7 , @xmath23    the proof will show that the limiting normal distribution originates from the random partitions and not from the exponential waiting times .",
    "a second glance on this result reveals a peculiarity : the normalization of @xmath6 is carried out using its expectation , but only half of its variance .",
    "these two terms have been determined by fu and li ( 1993 ) ( with a correction given by durrett ( 2002 ) ) .",
    "they obtained @xmath24 with @xmath25 , the @xmath0-th harmonic number .",
    "below we derive a more general result .    to uncover this peculiarity",
    "we shall study the external lengths in more detail .",
    "first we look at the point processes @xmath26 on @xmath27 , given by @xmath28 , i.e. @xmath29 for borel sets @xmath30 .",
    "[ t2 ] as @xmath31 the point process @xmath26 converges in distribution , as point processes on @xmath32 $ ] , to a poisson point process @xmath33 on @xmath27 with intensity measure @xmath34 .",
    "we use @xmath32 $ ] in the statement of theorem [ t2 ] instead of @xmath27 since it is stronger , including for example @xmath35 for every @xmath36 .",
    "the significance is that , as @xmath37 , there will be points clustering at 0 but not at @xmath38 .",
    "( below in the proof we recall the definition of convergence in distribution of point processes . )",
    "theorem [ t2 ] permits a first orientation . since @xmath39",
    ", one is tempted to resort to infinitely divisible distributions .",
    "however , the intensity measure @xmath40 is slightly outside the range of the lvy - chintchin formula . shortly speaking this means that small points of @xmath26 have a dominant influence on the distribution of @xmath6 and we are within the domain of the normal distribution .",
    "thus let us look in more detail on the external lengths and focus on @xmath41 which is the total length of those external branches having their internal nodes between level @xmath42 and @xmath43 within the coalescent .",
    "obviously @xmath44 .",
    "[ p3 ] for @xmath45 @xmath46 and @xmath47 as @xmath7 .",
    "in particular @xmath48 , whereas @xmath49 .",
    "thus the proposition indicates that the systematic part of @xmath6 and its fluctuations arise in different regions of the coalescent tree , the former close to the leaves and the latter closer to the root .",
    "still this proposition gives an inadequate impression .",
    "[ t4 ] for @xmath50 @xmath51 as @xmath7 .",
    "moreover @xmath52 and for @xmath53 @xmath54 in addition @xmath55 and @xmath56 are asymptotically independent for @xmath57 .",
    "this result implies theorem [ t1 ] : in @xmath58 the summands are of order @xmath59 and @xmath60 , such that in the limit the second , asymptotically normal component dominates . to this end",
    ", however , @xmath0 has to become exponentially large , otherwise the few long branches , which make up @xmath61 , can not be neglected and may produce extraordinary large values of @xmath6 .",
    "thus the normal approximation for the distribution of @xmath6 seems little useful for practical purposes .",
    "one expects a fat right tail compared to the normal distribution .",
    "indeed @xmath62 has finite mean but infinite variance .",
    "this is illustrated by the following two histograms from 10000 values of @xmath6 , where the length of the horizontal axis to the right indicates the range of the values .",
    "the heavy tails to the right are clearly visible . also very large outliers appear : for @xmath63 the simulated values of @xmath6 range from 0.685 to 8.38 , and for @xmath64 from 1.57 to 7.87 .",
    "also it turns out that the approximation of the variance in proposition [ p3 ] is good only for very large @xmath0 .",
    "this can be seen already from the formula of fu and li .",
    "to get an exact formula for the variance we look at a somewhat different quantity , namely @xmath65 with @xmath45 , which is the portion of the external length between level @xmath66 and @xmath67 within the coalescent .",
    "[ p5 ] for @xmath68 with @xmath69 @xmath70 and @xmath71    for @xmath72 we recover the formula of fu and li .",
    "a similar expression holds for @xmath73 .",
    "proposition [ p3 ] and theorem [ t4 ] carry over to @xmath73 , up to a change in expectation and with the limit @xmath74 .",
    "the following histogram from a random sample of length 10000 shows that already for @xmath63 the distribution of @xmath75 fits well to the normal distribution when using the values for expectation and variance , given in proposition [ p5 ] .",
    "our main tool for the proofs is a representation of @xmath6 by means of an imbedded markov chain @xmath76 , which is of interest of its own .",
    "we shall introduce it as an urn model .",
    "the relevant fact is that this model possesses an unexpected hidden symmetry , namely it is reversible in time .",
    "this is our second main result . for the proof we use another urn model , which allows reversal of time in a simple manner .",
    "the urn models are introduced and studied in section [ s2 ] .",
    "proposition [ p3 ] is proven in section [ s3 ] , theorems [ t2 ] and [ t4 ] are derived in section [ s4 ] and proposition [ p5 ] in section [ s5 ] . in section [ s6 ]",
    "we complete the paper by considering the length of an external branch chosen at random .",
    "take an urn with @xmath0 _ black _ balls .",
    "empty it in @xmath0 steps according to the rule : in each step remove a randomly chosen pair of balls and replace it by one _ red _ ball . in the last step",
    "remove the last remaining ball .",
    "let @xmath77 obviously @xmath78 , @xmath79 and @xmath80 for @xmath81 .",
    "@xmath82 is a markov chain with transition probabilities @xmath83 we begin our study of the model by calculating expectations and covariances .",
    "@xmath84 @xmath85    imagine that the black balls are numbered from 1 to @xmath0 .",
    "let @xmath86 be the indicator variable of the event that the black ball with number @xmath17 is not yet removed after @xmath3 steps .",
    "then @xmath87 and consequently @xmath88 and for @xmath89 in view of @xmath90 @xmath91 also @xmath92 and for @xmath89 @xmath93 our claim now follows by careful calculation .",
    "note that these expressions for expectations and covariances are invariant under the transformation @xmath94 , @xmath95 .",
    "this is not by coincidence :    [ t7 ] @xmath96 and @xmath97 are equal in distribution .    leaving aside @xmath78 we have @xmath98 @xmath99 for the other values of @xmath3 .",
    "instead we shall look at @xmath100 for @xmath101 .",
    "it turns out that for this process one can specify a different dynamics , which is more lucid and amenable to reversing time .",
    "consider the following alternative box scheme : there are two boxes @xmath102 and @xmath103 . at the beginning @xmath102",
    "contains @xmath104 black balls whereas @xmath103 is empty .",
    "the balls are converted in @xmath105 steps into @xmath104 red balls lying in @xmath103 .",
    "namely , in the steps number @xmath106 a randomly drawn ball from @xmath102 is shifted to @xmath103 and in the steps number @xmath107 a randomly chosen black ball ( whether from @xmath102 or @xmath103 ) is recolored to a red ball .",
    "these @xmath105 operations are carried out independently .",
    "for @xmath101 let @xmath108 that is at the moment after the @xmath3th move and before the @xmath3th recoloring .",
    "obviously the sequence is a markov chain , also @xmath109",
    ".    as to the transition probabilities note that after @xmath110 steps there are @xmath111 black balls in all and @xmath112 balls in @xmath102 .",
    "thus given @xmath113 there are @xmath114 red and @xmath115 black balls in @xmath102 , and the remaining @xmath116 black balls belong to @xmath103 . then @xmath117 occurs only , if in the next step the ball recolored from black to red belongs to @xmath102 and subsequently the ball shifted from @xmath102 to @xmath103 is black .",
    "thus @xmath118 similarly @xmath119 occurs , if the recolored ball belongs to @xmath103 and next the ball shifted from @xmath102 to @xmath103 is red .",
    "the corresponding probability is @xmath120 since @xmath121 and in view of the transition probabilities of @xmath122 and @xmath123 we see that @xmath124 and @xmath125 indeed coincide in distribution .    next note that @xmath126 .",
    "therefore @xmath127 can be considered as a function not only of the first @xmath110 but also of the last @xmath128 shifting and recoloring steps .",
    "since the steps are independent , the process backwards is equally easy to handle .",
    "taking into account that backwards the order of moving and recoloring balls is interchanged , one may just repeat the calculations above to obtain reversibility .    but this repetition can be avoided as well .",
    "let us put our model more formally : label the balls from @xmath129 to @xmath104 and write the state space as @xmath130 where @xmath131 is the location of ball @xmath17 and @xmath132 its color . then in our model the first and second coordinate",
    "are changed in turn from @xmath102 to @xmath103 and from @xmath133 to @xmath114 .",
    "this is done completely at random , starting within the first coordinates .",
    "clearly we may interchange the role of the first and second coordinate .",
    "thus our box model is equivalent to the following version :    again initially @xmath102 contains @xmath104 black balls whereas @xmath103 is empty . now in the steps number @xmath106 a randomly chosen black ball is recolored to a red ball and in the steps number @xmath107 a randomly drawn ball from @xmath102 is shifted to @xmath103 . again",
    "these @xmath105 operations are carried out independently .",
    "here we consider @xmath134 then from the observed symmetry it is clear that @xmath135 and @xmath136 are equal in distribution .",
    "if we finally interchange both colors and boxes as well , then we arrive at the dynamics of the backward process .",
    "this finishes the proof .",
    "there is a variant of our proof , which makes the reversibility of @xmath123 manifest in a different manner .",
    "let again the balls be labelled from @xmath129 to @xmath104 .",
    "denote @xmath137 then from our construction it is clear that @xmath138 and @xmath139 are two independent random permutations of the numbers @xmath140 .",
    "moreover , at instance @xmath3 ( i.e. after @xmath110 steps ) ball number @xmath141 is red and belongs to box @xmath102 , if it was colored before and shifted afterwards , i.e. @xmath142 . thus we obtain the formula @xmath143 and we may conclude the following result .",
    "[ c8 ] let @xmath144 and @xmath145 be two independent random permutations of @xmath140 .",
    "then @xmath146 is equal in distribution to the process @xmath147    certainly this representation implies theorem [ t7 ] again .",
    "also it contains additional information .",
    "for example , it is immediate that @xmath148 has a hypergeometric distribution with parameters @xmath149 .",
    "the next example contains a first application of theorem [ t7 ] to our original urn model .",
    "let us consider @xmath150 , the number of red balls in the urn , after the last black ball has been removed . from reversibility",
    "@xmath151 has the same distribution as the moment @xmath152 , before the first red ball is taken away from the urn .",
    "thus @xmath153 it follows for @xmath154 @xmath155 as @xmath7 .",
    "more generally the dynamics of our urn looks as follows : clearly , if @xmath0 is large , then in the beginning always two black balls are removed from the urn .",
    "the rare moments , when red balls are taken away , appear with increasing rate .",
    "indeed it is not difficult to see that in the limit @xmath7 and after a @xmath156-scaling of time these instances build up a poisson process with linearly increasing rate .",
    "as we have seen the picture remains the same after reversal of time .",
    "this will be made more precise in section [ s4 ] .",
    "+   + we conclude this section by imbedding our urn model into the coalescent .",
    "let @xmath157 and @xmath158 , @xmath2 .",
    "thus @xmath159 is the number of internal branches among the @xmath3 branches after the @xmath160-th coalescing event and @xmath1 is the number of internal branches among the @xmath111 branches after the @xmath3-th coalescing event .",
    "the coalescing mechanism takes two random branches and combines them into one internal branch .",
    "if we code the external branches by black balls and the internal branches by red , this completely conforms to our urn model ; thus @xmath161 is as above . by theorem [ t7 ]",
    ", @xmath162 has the same distribution as @xmath161 . in the next sections we make use of the markov chain @xmath163 and its properties .",
    "for a different interpretation of the process @xmath122 , suppose that we have @xmath104 pairs of ( different ) shoes , and that all left shoes are mixed in one pile and all right shoes in another .",
    "we sort the shoes by taking first a left shoe ( at random ) , then a right shoe ( also at random ) , then another left shoe , and so on .",
    "as soon as we take a shoe that matches one that we already have picked , we put away the pair ; otherwise we put the shoe on the table in front of us .",
    "if the pairs are numbered and @xmath164 is the time right shoe @xmath141 is picked , and @xmath165 the time left shoe @xmath141 is picked , then right shoe @xmath141 is on the table when the @xmath3-th left shoe has been picked if and only if @xmath166 , so by , the number of right shoes remaining on the table when the @xmath3-th left shoe has been picked is @xmath127 , @xmath167 .",
    "the number of left shoes remaining on the table at the same time is @xmath168 , so the total number of shoes on the table is @xmath169 .",
    "this is a variation of the sock - sorting process studied in steinsaltz ( 1999 ) and janson ( 2009 ) , section 8 , which is similar except that there is no difference between left and right ; we obtain it if we mix all shoes in one pile and pick from it at random .",
    "( see janson ( 2009 ) for other interpretations , including _ priority queues _ , and further references . )",
    "it is not surprising that we have the same asymptotical behaviour of @xmath1 and @xmath170 as for the sock - sorting problem . in particular , we mention the following gaussian process limit result , cf .  theorem 8.2 in janson ( 2009 ) .",
    "( this result is not used in the sequel . )    as @xmath37 , the stochastic process @xmath171 converges in @xmath172 $ ] to a continuous gaussian process @xmath173 with mean @xmath174 and covariance function @xmath175    note first that @xmath176 by proposition [ p6 ] .",
    "it is easily seen that @xmath177 and it follows that @xmath178 @xmath179 , is a martingale .",
    "consider in the sequel only @xmath180 for some fixed @xmath181 .",
    "then @xmath182 , and it follows from doob s inequality that @xmath183 ( using theorem [ t7 ] we see that this extends to @xmath184 . ) a straightforward computation of the conditional quadratic variation @xmath185 shows that , uniformly in @xmath186 , @xmath187 which implies , see theorem viii.3.11 in jacod and shiryaev ( 1987 ) , that @xmath188 in @xmath189 $ ] , where @xmath190 is a gaussian martingale given by @xmath191 for a standard brownian motion @xmath192 .",
    "the result follows , for @xmath193 $ ] , with @xmath194 .",
    "since @xmath181 is arbitrary , this yields convergence in @xmath195 . by time - reversal and theorem [ t7 ] , we also have convergence in @xmath196 $ ] , and together these imply convergence in @xmath172 $ ] , see e.g.the proof in janson ( 2009 ) .",
    "we use the representation @xmath197 where @xmath198 @xmath199 . in view of the coalescing procedure @xmath200",
    "takes only the values @xmath201 , and from the definition of @xmath159 @xmath202 from , @xmath203 and proposition [ p6 ] we obtain after simple calculations @xmath204 and for @xmath205 @xmath206 also from @xmath207 we have @xmath208 and @xmath209 ; thus @xmath210 for a suitable @xmath211 , independent of @xmath0 .",
    "thus from independence @xmath212 now the first claim follows by simple computation .    further from independence @xmath213 using  we have for @xmath205 , @xmath214 and it follows that @xmath215 consequently , yields , using again  , @xmath216    it remains to show that @xmath217 now @xmath218 and consequently @xmath219 this gives our claim .",
    "let @xmath297 and @xmath298 .",
    "since @xmath299 is the number of external branches , which are found between level @xmath300 and @xmath3 , @xmath301 from independence @xmath302 this gives the first claim .",
    "next , letting @xmath303 we have @xmath304 now , using proposition  [ p6 ] , @xmath305 and @xmath306 thus @xmath307 now @xmath308 thus @xmath309 combining our formulas the result follows .",
    "in this section we use theorem [ t7 ] .",
    "namely , @xmath220 is a markov chain with transition probabilities , which can be expressed by means of @xmath221 as follows : @xmath222 we like to couple these random variables with suitable independent random variables taking values 0 or 1 .",
    "note that @xmath159 takes only values @xmath223 , thus for @xmath224 @xmath225 therefore we may enlarge our model by means of random variables @xmath226 , @xmath224 , such that @xmath227 for @xmath228 this gives the above formula , whereas @xmath229 this means that the 0/1-valued random variables @xmath226 , @xmath224 , are independent .",
    "for convenience we put @xmath230 for @xmath231 .",
    "a straightforward computation gives @xmath232 for @xmath233 .",
    "since @xmath234 from proposition [ p6 ] , it follows @xmath235    recall that , by and , @xmath236    recall also that @xmath237 as point processes on the interval @xmath32 $ ] means that @xmath238 for every continuous @xmath239 with compact support in @xmath32 $ ] , or equivalently @xmath240 for every relatively compact borel subset @xmath103 of @xmath32 $ ] such that @xmath241 a.s .",

    "thus the proof of theorem [ t2 ] is complete .    as to the first claim of theorem [ t4 ]",
    "observe that the events @xmath263 and @xmath264 are equal .",

    "altogether we obtain , letting @xmath275 , @xmath276 which is our second claim .    as to the last claim of theorem [ t4 ] we note that from @xmath277 in probability , and also in @xmath278 .",
    "in this representation we like to replace @xmath200 by @xmath226 .",
    "we assume first @xmath279 . note that for @xmath280 in view of and @xmath281 and from , and proposition [ p6 ] @xmath282 thus @xmath283 and yields @xmath284 also @xmath285 , and",

    "finally we look at the distribution of the length of an external branch chosen at random .",
    "equivalently , letting @xmath310 , we may consider @xmath311 the length of the branch ending in the leaf with label 1 .",
    "its asymptotic distribution can be obtained in an elementary manner and without recourse to the results of the preceding sections .",
