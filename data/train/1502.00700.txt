    "in recent years remarkable progress in _ ab initio _ microscopic nuclear structure studies has been made in calculating nuclear properties , e.g. , low - lying spectra , transition strengths , etc . , in light nuclei .",
    "large - basis _ ab initio _ no - core shell - model ( ncsm ) calculations , which provide the foundation for this investigation , have been successful in reproducing the low - lying spectra and other properties of nuclei with @xmath8 @xcite .    in ncsm calculations all nucleons in the nucleus are active and treated equivalently in the chosen model space .",
    "when we increase the model space to obtain more precise results , we encounter the problem that the size of the calculations can easily exceed currently available computational resources .",
    "this is especially true as one proceeds towards the upper end of @xmath9-shell nuclei and beyond .",
    "the problem may be cast as a challenge to reproduce the many - body correlations present in the large space in a tractable , smaller model space .",
    "success in this endeavor will open up the prospects for _ ab initio _",
    "solutions for a wider range of nuclei than are currently accessible .",
    "the ncsm has proven to be an _ ab initio _ microscopic nuclear structure approach that has been able to reproduce experimental results and to make reliable predictions for nuclei with @xmath10 .",
    "these successes motivate us to develop approaches for heavier - mass nuclei . in one approach ,",
    "a small model space effective interaction has been constructed by modifying the one - body piece of the effective two - body hamiltonian and employing a unitary transformation in order to account for many - body correlations for the @xmath5-body system in a large space @xcite . in another approach  @xcite ,",
    "the effective two- and three - body hamiltonians for @xmath9-shell nuclei have been constructed by performing @xmath11 _ ab initio _",
    "[ i.e. , @xmath12 harmonic oscillator ( ho ) quanta above the minimum required ] ncsm calculations for @xmath13 and @xmath14 systems and explicitly projecting the many - body hamiltonians onto the @xmath4 space .",
    "these @xmath5-dependent effective hamiltonians can be separated into core , one - body , and two - body ( and three - body ) components , all of which are also @xmath5-dependent  @xcite .",
    "recently , two more _ ab initio _",
    "methods for valence nucleon effective interactions have been introduced with the same goals ; one is based on the in - medium similarity renormalization group approach @xcite and the other is based on the coupled - cluster method @xcite .    in this work , following the original idea of refs .",
    "@xcite , we derive two - body effective interactions for the @xmath6 shell by using @xmath2 ncsm wave functions at the two - body cluster level , which contain all the many - body correlations of the @xmath2 no - core model space .",
    "the goal of this work is to demonstrate feasibility of this approach in the @xmath6 shell , where we do not require calculations at the limit of currently accessible computers .",
    "such a major extension will be addressed in a future effort .    at the first step ,",
    "we construct a `` primary '' effective hamiltonian following the okubo - lee - suzuki ( ols ) unitary transformation method @xcite .",
    "we indicate this first step schematically by the progression shown with the two large squares in the lower section of fig .",
    "[ figure_double_ols ] .",
    "we elect to perform this first step at the two - body cluster level for @xmath15f in the @xmath2 model space ( the `` @xmath16-space '' ) following the ncsm prescription @xcite . for our initial interactions we select the jisp16 @xcite and chiral n3lo @xcite potentials .",
    "our formalism may be directly adapted to include the three - nucleon force ( 3nf ) but the computational effort increases dramatically .",
    "thus , we do not include the 3nf in this initial work .",
    "for the second step , we begin by performing a ncsm calculation for @xmath15f with the primary effective hamiltonian in the @xmath2 model space to generate the low - lying eigenvalues and eigenvectors needed for a second ols transformation as indicated by the flow to the upper right in fig .",
    "[ figure_double_ols ] .",
    "these @xmath15f eigenvectors are dominated by configurations with an @xmath17o system in the lowest available ho orbits and two nucleons in the @xmath6 shell .",
    "all additional many - body correlations are also present . with these @xmath15f eigenvectors and eigenvalues",
    "we then solve for the `` secondary '' effective hamiltonian , again using an ols transformation , that acts only in the @xmath18 space of @xmath15f but produces the same low - lying eigenvalues .",
    "here we are following the scheme initially introduced in ref .",
    "the matrix elements of this secondary effective hamiltonian have the property that all configurations are defined with two nucleons in the @xmath6-space and an @xmath17o subsystem restricted to the lowest available ho single - particle states .",
    "this second step therefore produces a secondary effective hamiltonian that is equivalent to what we would call the 18-body cluster hamiltonian in the ncsm acting in the @xmath18 space .    at the third step , we carry out ncsm calculations for the @xmath17o , @xmath19o , and @xmath19f systems with the primary effective interaction in the @xmath2 basis space . the results of these calculations produce , respectively , the core and one - body components included in the secondary effective hamitonian .    at the fourth step ,",
    "we subtract the core and one - body terms from the secondary effective hamiltonians of step 2 to obtain the effective valence interaction two - body matrix elements ( tbmes ) in the @xmath6-shell space .    following the completion of these four steps",
    ", we then use the effective valence interaction matrix elements along with the extracted single - particle energies ( for both the proton and the neutron ) for standard shell - model ( ssm ) calculations in the @xmath6-shell space .    for any system with @xmath20",
    ", we can obtain its 18-body cluster hamiltonian by repeating the entire procedure utilizing the primary effective hamiltonian for that value of @xmath5 .",
    "the second and subsequent steps remain the same .",
    "that is , we perform ncsm calculations with the primary ( @xmath5-dependent ) effective @xmath21 potential for @xmath17o , @xmath19o , @xmath19f , and @xmath15f in order to obtain the ( @xmath5-dependent ) core energy , single - particle energies , and tbmes , which can then be used in a ssm calculation for that value of @xmath5 .",
    "we provide details for applications to @xmath20 systems below using @xmath22f as an example .",
    "we employ the coulomb interaction between the protons in the ncsm calculations which gives rise to the major shift between the derived neutron and proton single - particle energies .",
    "exploration of full charge - dependence in the derived two - body valence interactions will be addressed in a future effort . in particular",
    ", our current @xmath0 and @xmath1 applications will have at most one valence proton so we do not require a residual coulomb interaction between valence protons in this work .",
    "for the chiral n3lo we retain full charge dependence in the first step that is , when deriving the primary effective hamiltonian .",
    "thus , the @xmath5-body , core , and valence system calculations are performed with full charge dependence retained . since we currently solve only for @xmath15f in step 2 , we derive only the isospin - dependent but charge - independent secondary effective hamiltonian . to retain full charge dependence in the secondary effective hamiltonian , which would constitute predictions beyond conventional phenomenological interactions , would require additional @xmath15o and @xmath15ne calculations that are intended in future efforts .",
    "one may straightforwardly generalize these steps outlined above to solve for effective three - body valence interactions suitable for ssm calculations .",
    "earlier efforts using an alternative implementation of step 3  @xcite showed that effective three - body valence interactions lead to significant improvements over effective two - body valence interactions .",
    "the ncsm calculations start with the intrinsic hamiltonian of the @xmath5-nucleon system , omitting any 3nf in the present effort : @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the nucleon mass , @xmath25 is the bare @xmath21 interaction , @xmath26 is the relative kinetic energy and @xmath27 is the total two - body interaction",
    ". we will add the coulomb interaction between the protons at a later stage since we treat it as a perturbative correction to the derived primary effective hamiltonian . in order to facilitate convergence ,",
