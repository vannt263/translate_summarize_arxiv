    "metallicity , age and mass are fundamental characteristics of a stellar population .",
    "metallicity distributions , in conjunction with chemical evolution models , provide evolutionary information about both enrichment and gas inflow and outflow in the form of galactic winds . while in recent years measuring large numbers of spectroscopic metallicities has become more feasible with multiobject spectrographs @xcite , it is still challenging to observe samples large enough to find rare objects or substructure in metallicity distribution functions , or to observe faint enough to build up large samples in nearby galaxies .",
    "photometric metallicities , though not as accurate as spectra , provide measurements for every star in the field , including those with fainter magnitudes than can be reached spectroscopically .",
    "the general technique to assign photometric metallicities relates color to metallicity .",
    "for instance , in a color magnitude diagram ( cmd ) fiducial ridgelines from several clusters with similar age , and a range of known metallicities can be interpolated to estimate the metallicity of an unmeasured cluster based upon the location of its ridgeline , provided that the cluster is also of similar age ( e.g. , saviane et al .",
    "2000 ; da costa et al .",
    "2000,2002 ) .",
    "fiducial ridgelines have been used to derive empirical relations between color and metallicity at a given absolute magnitude @xcite .",
    "alternatively , one can use theoretical isochrones , however , the isochrones need to be empirically calibrated to match observed sequences ( e.g. , brown et al . 2005 ; lianou et al .",
    "2011 ) .",
    "an issue with deriving metallicities from color arises because a giant can be redder either because it is older , or because it is more metal rich .",
    "one method to break the age - metallicity degeneracy uses a color - color diagram , where one color is constructed using a metallicity sensitive filter , and the other color is constructed from a pair of filters that provide a temperature estimate with minimal dependence on metallicity .",
    "there is a long history in astronomy of using specifically designed filters to isolate stellar characteristics such as metallicity .",
    "proposed photometric indices as a means of stellar classification .",
    "the @xmath4 index estimates the stellar metallicity of horizontal branch , red giant branch and main sequence stars when used in conjunction with a temperature - sensitive index such as @xmath5 .",
    "the washington system was developed to measure photometric metallicities , temperatures and the amount of cn line blanketing for giant g and k stars @xcite .",
    "another consideration with photometric metallicities is that medium and broad band colors lose nearly all sensitivity at low metallicity .",
    "the caby system , developed in the 1990 s , modified the strmgren system , replacing the v filter with a filter centered on the ca h @xmath6 k lines .",
    "the caby system measures stellar metallicities 3 times more accurately , especially at low metallicity where the m@xmath7 index loses sensitivity @xcite .",
    "several filters on the hst / wfc3 were designed to provide information on the metallicities of resolved populations . our wfc3 calibration program ( 11729 , pi holtzman )",
    "was designed to collect images of clusters with well established spectroscopic metallicities in order to map wfc3 colors to metallicity .",
    "another program designed to study the galactic bulge ( 11664 , pi brown ) imaged the same clusters with different filters , also as a calibration .",
    "this paper utilizes observations from both programs to present a broad range of calibrating filters and their metallicity sensitivities .",
    "observations were obtained of m92 , ngc 6752 , ngc 104 , ngc 5927 , and ngc 6791 .",
    "the five calibration clusters are well studied spectroscopically , and span a wide range of metallicity : @xmath8 @xmath1 .",
    "individual stars can be observed throughout the local group , opening up possibilities for studying populations within the milky way , as well as local group galaxies .",
    "our primary interest is in using these calibrations to measure metallicity distribution functions in several local group dwarf galaxies @xcite where we only have sufficient accuracy to measure giants , but the calibrations presented here may have broader applicability . as will be shown , photometric indices that measure metallicity also have a sensitivity to surface gravity , but for objects outside the milky way , it is trivial to separate giants from dwarfs based on their observed brightness .",
    "we structure the paper as follows : in section 2 we use model atmospheres and isochrones to explore the capacity of various filter combinations to measure metallicity ; in section 3 we present the observations of the stellar clusters .",
    "section 4 describes how we calibrate a set of isochrones to the observed sequences , and demonstrate how well these can be used to recover metallicities . in section 5",
    "we summarize our conclusions .",

    "these sensitivities were computed for stars at m@xmath20 ; for more luminous giants , the sensitivity is better , while for fainter ones , it is worse . sensitivities are reported for several different ranges in metallicity , demonstrating the smaller color sensitivity at lower metallicity .    generally , sensitivity increases as the wavelength separation of the filters increases .",
    "however , each filter has different photometric precision for a fixed exposure time .",

    "the implication is that ideal filter choices rely on both the color sensitivity to metallicity and the precision to which the color can be measured .",
    "the most metallicity sensitive colors will not be the optimum choice when observing time and errors are considered .",
    "however , if you use a color that only changes minimally with metallicity , no amount of increased photometric accuracy will improve the metallicity determination .",
    "the last column of table [ cmdsens ] suggests that f475w ",
    "f814w is the optimal color for maximum metallicity sensitivity , and this has been adopted by many studies ( e.g. , gallart 2008 ) ; although this choice does depend to some extent on the color of the target stars .",
    "other commonly used metallicity sensitive colors are f390w  f814w and f555w  f814w .",
    "as pointed out in the last paragraph there is a trade off between metallicity sensitivity and photometric accuracy ( from a reasonable amount of integration time ) .",
    "the sensitivities in table [ cmdsens ] show that these wide band colors have simultaneously greater throughput and less metallicity sensitivity than the medium and narrow band filters listed in table [ cmdsens ] .",
    "additionaly , at very - low metallicity , these broad - band colors have little sensitivity ( @xmath24 and @xmath25 dex , respectively , per 0.01 mag of color change ) , and since it is challenging to reduce photometric errors below 0.01 mag , this leads to a fundamental limit on the accuracy of derived metallicities .",
    "for some colors , at low metallicity the color change from metallicity becomes smaller than the typical photometric accuracy of 0.01 mag . in table",
