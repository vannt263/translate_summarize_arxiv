    "assuming the standard hierarchical model of the structure formation from gaussian fluctuations due to gravitational instability , we study the effect of primordial gravitational potential fluctuations on massive objects such as galaxy clusters and perhaps superclusters , i.e. , clusters of clusters ( @xcite ) .",
    "we employ the ps formalism as a tool and modify it for this study .    some effect of the primordial gravitational potential upon the structure formation has been already noted .",
    "@xcite have noticed that the adhesion approximation predicts that the formation of voids is associated with positive peaks of the primordial gravitational potential .",
    "sahni , sathyaprakash , & shandarin ( 1994 ) studied the effect and measured a significant correlation between the sizes of voids and the value of primordial gravitational potential in numerical simulations of the adhesion model . by investigating the evolution of correlation between the potential and the density perturbations , buryak , demianski , @xmath12 doroshkevich ( 1992 ) showed that the formation of super large scale structures is mainly determined by the spatial distribution of the gravitational potential .",
    "recently , madsen et al . (",
    "1997 ) have demonstrated by n - body simulations that the under dense and the over dense regions are closely linked to the regions with the positive and the negative gravitational potential respectively .",
    "thus , given all these results showing the important role of the primordial gravitational potential in the structure formation , it would be interesting to calculate the effect of the primordial potential upon the mass distribution function .",
    "the mass distribution function @xmath13 is defined such that @xmath14 is the comoving number density of gravitationally bound objects in the mass range @xmath15 .",
    "the standard press - schechter ( hereafter , ps ) formalism provides an effective tool to evaluate @xmath13 in spite of various criticism on it ( see @xcite ) , and is widely used in cosmology ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) . also , @xcite have shown by applying the dynamics based on the zeldovich approximation to the ps formalism that it is very robust with respect to the underlying dynamics .",
    "the following two equations represent the essence of the ps formalism ( @xcite ) : @xmath16 @xmath17 here @xmath18 is the probability density distribution of the linearly extrapolated density contrast @xmath19 smoothed on a comoving filtering scale @xmath20 which is related to the mass by @xmath21 .",
    "the proportionality constant @xmath22 is either determined by the shape of the smoothing window function or sometimes is used as a free parameter in order to provide a better agreement with numerical results . in the case of a sharp k - space filter",
    "which is actually consistent with the ps formalism ( see @xcite ) , the filtering scale @xmath23 in k - space and mass are related as @xmath24 .",
    "the density threshold value @xmath25 for collapse was originally given as @xmath26 according to the top hat spherical model .",
    "however , it has been shown that the lowered value of @xmath25 in the range from @xmath27 gives a better fit in n - body simulations , which depends on the the initial spectrum and the type of the filter ( e.g. , @xcite ) .    in this letter",
    "we investigate and show how much the primordial gravitational potential @xmath1 affects the mass distribution function of galaxy cluster . modifying the ps formalism , we derive a constrained mass distribution function @xmath28 ) defined as the comoving number densities of clumps of mass @xmath29 in the regions where the primordial gravitational potential fluctuation satisfies some specified conditions . the cold dark matter model ( cdm ) with @xmath30 and @xmath31 is used to demonstrate the significance of the effect .",
    "in order to incorporate the primordial gravitational potential fluctuations term into the above equations , we first derive the conditional probability density distribution @xmath32 ( @xmath33 ) : @xmath34}^{-1 } \\times \\nonumber \\\\   & & \\bigg{[}1+{\\rm erf}\\bigg{(}\\frac{\\kappa \\frac{\\delta}{\\sigma_{\\delta}}- \\frac{\\varphi_c}{\\sigma_{\\varphi } } } { \\sqrt{2(1-\\kappa^2 ) } } \\bigg{)}\\bigg{]}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here @xmath35 , @xmath36 , and @xmath37 are the density , velocity and the potential variances respectively ; @xmath38 is the crosscorrelation coefficient of the the density contrast @xmath19 smoothed on the scale @xmath39 and the primordial ( _ unsmoothed _ ) potential fluctuations @xmath1 .",
    "the probability density distribution function for @xmath40 has the same form as equation ( 3 ) except for the opposite sign in front of the second error function term .    in the case of a sharp k - space filter assumed throughout this letter , @xmath35 , @xmath36 and @xmath37",
    "are given as @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the density power spectrum .",
    "it is worth stressing that the variances @xmath43 and @xmath44 depend on @xmath39 , but the variance of the primordial potential , @xmath37 does not .",
    "we are interested in evaluating the effect of the _ primordial _ potential fluctuations and thus take @xmath45 with no filtering .",
    "the long wave cutoff @xmath46 ( eq .",
    "6 ) corresponds to the assumption that the waves longer than the cosmological horizon are irrelevant to the processes on scales of the structures in the universe ( i.e. smaller than a few hundred of @xmath47 ) .",
    "a particular choice of @xmath48 is unimportant since for the harrison - zeldovich spectrum ( assumed here ) @xmath49 depends on @xmath50 only logarithmically .    as a result of the incorporation of the potential into the probability density distribution",
    ", the volume fraction @xmath51 is now a function of both @xmath52 and @xmath53 each of which in turn is a function of mass m : @xmath54    = \\int^{\\infty}_{\\delta_{c}}\\ !   d\\delta",
    "~p(\\delta|\\varphi < -\\varphi_{c}).\\ ] ] thus , equation ( 1 ) for the conditional mass function @xmath55 becomes @xmath56    for the initial power spectrum @xmath42 , we use the fit given by @xcite with @xmath2 and @xmath57 normalization .",
    "this choice of the parameters is in general agreement with both the cobe measurements and the galaxy two - point correlation function ( @xcite ) . calculating @xmath58 numerically , we evaluate @xmath55 through equations ( 4 ) to ( 8) .",
    "we reserve the detailed description of the calculation for a companion paper in preparation .",
    "1 shows the magnitude of the effect in terms of the cumulative mass functions .",
    "the upper panel shows the cumulative conditional mass functions @xmath59 and @xmath60 ( for each case of @xmath61 ) along with the unconditional ps mass function , @xmath62 .",
    "the cumulative mass functions were obtained by integrating the mass functions @xmath55 numerically .",
    "the shaded area shows the fit to the observational mass function of rich clusters given by @xcite .",
    "the ratios of the conditional mass functions to the unconditional one are plotted in the lower panel of fig . 1",
    ".    we also calculate the probability that a clump with mass m is located in the potential regions satisfying the chosen condition , for instance , @xmath63 @xmath64 where @xmath65 is the fraction of space satisfying the given condition ( see fig .",
    "the other probabilities @xmath66 , @xmath67 , and @xmath68 can be obtained in a similar manner .",
    "the ps formalism has been proved to be a simple but very effective tool widely used for constraining cosmological models .",
    "we have modified it by considering the dependence of mass function on the initial perturbation of gravitational potential .",
    "the resulting modified ps theory predicts that the clumps with masses greater than roughly @xmath69 have a noticeable tendency to form in the troughs of the primordial gravitational potential ( the regions where the primordial potential fluctuations were negative ) .",
    "this quantitative prediction can be tested in large n - body simulations .",
    "regardless of the outcome it will shed light on the ps formalism ; if our prediction is confirmed , it will show a new potency of the ps technique .",
    "otherwise a new limitation to the formalism will be established .",
    "assuming that the prediction is correct at least qualitatively , we would like to discuss some of its obvious consequences .",
    "the scale of the initial potential @xmath70 does not depend on any ad hoc scale ; the dependence on @xmath71 is exremely weak ( @xmath72 for the harrison - zeldovich spectra assumed here ) .",
    "it is , perhaps , worth mentioning that the scale of the potential is also practically independent of the smoothing scale unless it exceeds the value of a few tens of @xmath73 .",
    "the density scale @xmath74 is determined by the scale of the smoothing window function @xmath39 that has only one `` natural '' scale corresponding nonlinearity @xmath75 .",
    "for the model in question the scale of the primordial potential is found to be @xmath76 .",
    "the scale of the density contrast field reaches this value @xmath77 only after it is smoothed on @xmath78 . the corresponding density variance on",
    "this scale is @xmath79 . on the other hand ,",
    "the number of clumps with masses @xmath80 can easily be 30% greater in the troughs of the potential than the mean density @xmath81 $ ] ( see fig .",
    "1 ) . thus , the bias factor @xmath10 ( defined by the relation @xmath82 ) reaches at least @xmath83 on the scale about @xmath84 .",
    "qualitatively the bias phenomenon can be explained as follows .",
    "the initial density contrast is proportional to the laplacian of the initial potential ( @xmath85 ) .",
    "therefore the two fields are cross - correlated : the positive peaks of @xmath19 are more likely to be found in the troughs of the potential where it is negative .",
    "the correlation is not very strong ( for @xmath86 corresponding to @xmath87 the crosscorrelation coefficient @xmath88 ) .",
    "but the clusters are extreme objects corresponding to the tail of the mass function , and thus very sensitive to the environment .",
    "that is why the clusters put one of the strongest constraints on cosmological models ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "incorporating the motion of mass into dynamics can only increase the bias effect due to the nonlinear effects although they are quite small on the scale in question . but , the point is not in the magnitude of the nonlinear effects but rather in their sign . on the scale of the potential the mass moves from the peaks of the potential to the troughs .",
    "using the zeldovich approximation one can easily estimate the rms displacement of the mass on the scale of the potential ( @xcite ) : @xmath89 it is relatively small compared to the scale of the potential but coherent on the scale of the potential field , and therefore it can only enhance the bias effect .",
    "another nonlinear effect is related to the rate of growth of perturbations . for the perturbations on the scale of a few mpc the potential troughs / peaks",
    "may be viewed as patches with slower / faster expansion rate that corresponds to the increase / decrease of the rate of growth of small - scale perturbations .",
    "similarly , the bias is enhanced in the redshift space because the velocity field is directed toward the troughs and away from peaks of the potential .",
    "both effects can increase the bias by about 5% depending on the initial spectrum .",
    "another way of calculating the constrained mass function would be using the peak - background split technique suggested by @xcite to explain the enhanced correlation function of reach clusters .",
    "obviously , the initial potential resembles the smoothed initial density field if the filter has a sufficiently large scale , but the former is never identical to the latter .",
    "the potential itself can be viewed as a smoothed density field with a very soft scale - free filter @xmath90 . typically the density field is filtered with much harder filters ( e.g. top - hat , gaussian , or sharp @xmath91-space filters ) , that impose the scale which is an ad hoc parameter .",
    "the magnitude of the bias in our approach is determined by the crosscorrelation of the density contrast smoothed at the scale ( @xmath39 ) of nonlinearity ( @xmath92 ) with the initial potential that does not have any ad hoc parameters .",
    "probably , the value of the crosscorrelation coefficient determines the bias in the peak - split approach as well .",
    "the crosscorrelation of the density field @xmath93 smoothed on the scale of nonlinearity ( @xmath86 ) with the field @xmath94 smoothed on the scale of the potential ( @xmath95 ) is about @xmath96 times weaker than the correlation of @xmath93 with the initial potential @xmath1 .",
    "thus , we expect that the bias of galaxy clusters on such large scales as the scale of the initial potential ( @xmath97 ) is stronger toward the troughs of the potential fluctuations rather than to the peaks of the density fluctuations @xmath93 smoothed with the corresponding filter .",
    "we have not applied the split peak - background approach because it is not clear how to avoid arbitrarines in choosing the scale that splits the density into small - scale peaks and large - scale background field .",
    "this question requires a separate study .    applying this effect to observations one has to take into account the following issues .",
    "the gravitational potential does not evolve much on large scales especially in the einstein - de sitter universe ( kofman & shandarin 1988 ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "therefore , the potential at present is very similar to the primordial one on scales much greater than the scale of nonlinearity .",
    "a simple explanation to this in the frame of the standard scenario of the structure formation is due to the fact that the mass has been displaced by the distance about @xmath98 ( @xcite ) .",
    "therefore , the potential on scales greater than , say , @xmath99 has been changed very little .",
    "clusters can be used as _ statistical _ tracers of the potential . in addressing this question",
    "it is worth noting that the shot noise is an important factor since clusters are rare objects . using the observational mass function ( bahcall & cen 1993 ) one can estimate that an average spherical patch of the radius @xmath100 contains about @xmath101 clusters with the masses greater than @xmath102 .",
    "thus , the shot noise is about 18% on this scale which is comparable with the bias itself ( see fig .",
    "1 , the bottom panel ) .",
    "however , fig .",
    "2 suggests that the most massive clusters [ @xmath103 are very likely to reside in the regions of negative potential ( @xmath104 ) and very unlikely in the regions of high potential ( @xmath105 if @xmath106 ) .",
    "more detailed analysis will be present elsewhere .",
    "probably , the best candidates for the markers of the troughs in the field of the primordial potential fluctuations are superclusters ( defined as clusters of clusters ) ( @xcite ) especially with highest density enhancements ( shapley supercluster ) and the giant geometrical patterns in the cluster distribution ( @xcite ) .",
