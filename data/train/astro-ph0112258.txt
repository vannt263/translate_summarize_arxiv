    "in paper i of this series ( majewski 1992 ) , proper motions were determined for nearly a thousand stellar objects in selected area 57 ( sa57 ) at the north galactic pole to photographic @xmath9 and @xmath10 .",
    "is the passband produced by the combination of iiia - j emulsion and gg385 filter , whereas @xmath11 is the combination of iiiaf + gg495 . ]",
    "photometric parallaxes were determined for a subsample of 250 stars with @xmath12 and @xmath13 based on photographic ultraviolet excess measurements . since , in general , no direct measurement of the surface gravity of each star was readily available , a basic premise of the adopted analysis in paper i was that the survey stars are on the main sequence .",
    "however , it is possible to exploit proper motions to discriminate luminosity classes of some stars through use of the reduced proper motion diagram ( rpmd ; see also luyten 1922 , jones 1972a , b , chiu 1980b , evans 1992 , knox et al .",

    "white dwarfs , on account of their very high reduced proper motions , should be readily identifiable in the rpmd .",
    "this technique confers certain advantages over color searches for white dwarfs ; e.g. , it is possible to identify cool white dwarfs that are not distinguishable from the more numerous late type field stars using colors alone .",
    "deep searches for faint , cool white dwarfs are important for testing white dwarf cooling models into the regime of debye crystallization , and , by applying cooling theory in conjunction with the white dwarf luminosity function , to set limits on the star formation history and age of galactic stellar populations .",
    "white dwarfs can also be used as tracers of the density laws of old populations , and white dwarfs are proposed as potentially significant contributors to the dark matter component represented by gravitational microlensing events .",
    "numerous studies have attempted to establish the local density and/or luminosity function of population i white dwarfs , and especially , recently , at the red end of the white dwarf sequence , due to the interest in cool white dwarfs for both age dating the galaxy and as a primary source for microlensing candidates .",
    "results for the derived local white dwarf density found among the different surveys still range by a factor of two ( fleming et al .",
    "1986 ; jahrei 1987 ; liebert , dahn & monet 1988 , hereafter ldm ; boyle 1989 ; ruiz & takamiya 1995 ; oswalt et al .",
    "1996 ; festin 1998 ; k99 ; reid et al . 2001 ; ruiz & bergeron 2001 ) .",
    "the question of completeness lingers when considering the results of these various surveys .",
    "so too does a proper understanding of the density laws appropriate to the samples garnered , since the conversion from a survey list to a local density requires an understanding of the _ effective _ volume surveyed , i.e. , the volume foreshortened by the drop - off in density with distance from the galactic midplane .",
    "typically , white dwarf studies have _ adopted _ a standard value for an exponential scaleheight of the disk in such calculations , rather than attempted to _ solve _ for the density law from their white dwarf samples .",
    "this understandable reluctance derives from the relatively limited range of distances probed by complete samples ( typically one third to one half of the traditional old disk scaleheight ) , which limits sensitivity to the form of the density law .",
    "survey incompleteness at distances comparable to a disk scaleheight derives both from photometric _ and _ astrometric limitations , since proper motions provide the most commonly used means by which to identify white dwarfs ( especially those redward of the field star main sequence turn off ( msto ) ) .",
    "table 1 summarizes the major _ astrometric _ white dwarf surveys to date ( not including studies made from archival survey data , such as the lowell proper motion or luyten half - second catalogues , which we represent by the work of ldm ) . with the exception of the deep , small area study by chiu ( 1980b ) , these surveys are focused on stars with fairly large proper motions ( @xmath14 mas yr@xmath2 ) .",
    "such a limitation progressively excludes white dwarf populations with ever larger ranges of transverse velocity as a function of distance .",
    "figure 1 shows the limiting distances that are imposed on the detection of white dwarfs as a function of various apparent magnitude and proper motion limits .",
    "figure 2 plots the sky density of detected white dwarfs against both photometric and astrometric limits for the surveys listed in table 1 .",
    "table 1 and figure 2 demonstrate that the detected white dwarf sky density appears to be more directly correlated with proper motion limits than survey depth .",
    "this is an important point , one worth considering given the new emphasis on properly accounting for the total white dwarf density in the foreground of lensed sources . the impressive k99 study , as the deepest , large area survey with the best proper motions to date , provides a benchmark for the present discussion",
    ". k99 claim to find no evidence of incompleteness in their survey sample , and that this survey represents the most complete large area sample to date is evidenced by their finding the largest sky surface density of white dwarfs for such a survey to date , 2.07 deg@xmath15 . through a variety of arguments ,",
    "k99 suggest that their proper motion limit of 50 - 60 mas yr@xmath2 provides a reasonable compromise between minimizing spurious detections and maintaining completeness .",
    "for example , for bright ( @xmath16 ) white dwarfs , k99 argue that such a limit is more than enough to detect stars  having a ( _ conservative _ ) tangential velocity of 40 km s@xmath2 , [ which ] would have a proper motion of @xmath17 mas yr@xmath2 \" ( emphasis added ) ; clearly for fainter , more distant ( @xmath18 pc ) examples of stars with similar transverse velocities , however their survey quickly becomes incomplete ( figure 1 ) .",
    "it is worth noting at this point that the results of the present analysis will focus on the discovery of white dwarf candidates that are primarily _ slower _ than k99 s  conservative \" estimate .",
    "an important means by which k99 attempt to build their case for completeness is by establishing that their sample mean @xmath19 statistic is nearly 0.5 ( see  4 ) , where here the @xmath20 s represent effective volumes _ under the assumption of a 300 pc scaleheight_. while k99 s investigation of variations in the assumed scaleheight show no significant alteration in their derived luminosity function , the authors do not state how varying the scaleheight affects their assumption of completeness .",
    "@xmath7 is primarily a test of uniformity that k99 and others have adapted to a test of completeness .",
    "even k99 admit that obtaining @xmath21 can not be regarded as proof of completeness , since an incomplete sample can yield a similar result .",
    "while this caveat might be considered all the more prescient if it can be shown that 300 pc is not a proper scaleheight to assume in the effective volume calculations in the first place , in the end , it should be noted that incompleteness in typical magnitude- and proper motion - limited samples may not significantly bias the derivation of the local luminosity function according to the monte carlo simulations of wood & oswalt ( 1998 ) and mendez & ruiz ( 2001 ) .    in this article",
    ", we explore the question of the disk white dwarf population density distribution using a low limit proper motion selected sample .",
    "we employ reduced proper motions to separate degenerate star candidates from subdwarfs and population i main sequence stars within the deep proper motion sample of paper i. of course , these proper motion techniques have been used in many previous studies , some that explore to similar depth and/or much larger areas of sky than the paper i sample ( table 1 ) ; given our small survey area ( 0.3 deg@xmath3 ) , the volume we probe is much smaller than that explored by most previous surveys , even considering our @xmath22 magnitude limit . within the last few years , several new surveys have also reached @xmath23 , and the k99 survey in particular has the potential , _ based on photometric considerations _ , to probe much larger volumes than our survey . in practice , however , differences in _ astrometric quality _ puts the present analysis in a unique niche in parameter space compared to all previous studies : no study in the literature has an astrometric precision comparable to that afforded by the 16 year baseline study using deep photographic exposures on fine - grained emulsions with good plate scale discussed in paper i. the resultant precision ( @xmath24 mas yr@xmath2 at @xmath25 and @xmath26 mas yr@xmath2 at @xmath22 ) allows for ( 1 ) an rpmd that is relatively  clean \" of astrometric error - induced scatter at the white dwarf locus , minimizing contamination problems , and ( 2 ) orders of magnitude smaller proper motion limits .",
    "thus , we can find low proper motion white dwarf candidates that would be missed by all previous surveys , look for white dwarfs at larger distances , and ensure a much higher level of completeness than could be claimed before .",
    "the transverse velocity limits of a 1 mas yr@xmath2 survey to @xmath22 as a function of distance are shown in figure 1 ; our astrometric advantage for probing to much larger distances than other surveys is clear .",
    "as we shall show , this advantage allows us to find a white dwarf sky density at @xmath22 that is likely an order of magnitude larger than that found by k99 , which itself had a density that was larger than found by most previous surveys ( see table 1 ) .    the primary contribution to",
    "our sky density seems to be from an extended distribution of distant white dwarfs with cold kinematics typical of the thin disk . that the majority of the white dwarfs have projected distances larger than 300 pc , and a third of them beyond 900 pc , suggests the need for a revision of the normally assumed 250 - 350 pc scaleheight for the thin disk white dwarf population .",
    "thus , a principal endeavor in this contribution is to use this admittedly small , but much less kinematically biased , sample of white dwarfs to define better the vertical distribution of the old disk , a task to which our unusually distant sample has particular leverage .",
    "we define the @xmath27 passband reduced proper motion of a star , @xmath28 , as    @xmath29    where @xmath27 is the calibrated photographic flux on iiia - f emulsions with a gg495 filter , @xmath30 is the absolute magnitude of a star , @xmath31 is the proper motion in arc - seconds per year and @xmath32 is the transverse velocity in km s@xmath2 . because the properties of the stars in a given population should cluster around certain values , stars can be classified based on their location in the rpmd . however , as demonstrated by chiu ( 1980b ) , many stars may not be assignable to a unique population / luminosity class on the basis of the rpmd . the ridge lines of different populations intersect because the combined properties of populations according to equation ( 1 ) overlap .",
    "fortunately , we explore here a comparatively simple region of the rpmd , the extreme domain typically inhabited by white dwarfs .    the sample of sa57 objects for which proper motions and new photographic photometry were calculated in paper i were those having @xmath33 or @xmath34 in the catalogue of kron ( 1980 ) ( where the stated magnitude limits are based on kron s photometry from the same first epoch plates and @xmath35 refers to the iiia - j emulsion with gg 385 filter , and @xmath36 ) .",
    "figure 3 shows the ( @xmath37 ) rpmd for this sample , excluding confirmed qsos and galaxies ( see m91 ; travese et al .",
    "1994 , hereafter t94 ) .",
    "the photometry in this diagram is taken from an analysis using more photographic plates as well as a more extended list of photometric standards than is described in paper i. typical random errors in @xmath38 for these data are @xmath39 magnitudes but reach 0.10 magnitudes at the magnitude limit ( see figure 3 of paper i ) .",
    "random errors in @xmath28 are typically 0.2 magnitudes but in some cases exceed 1.5 at the magnitude ( _ not _",
    "@xmath28 ) limit ( see figures 2 and 10 in paper i ) .",
    "these stars with large error are almost entirely stars with low @xmath28 and do not affect our analysis of high @xmath28 objects ( see figure 3 ) since none are near the wd1 locus .    except for that marked  wd1 \" , the ridge lines shown in figure 3 are those from chiu ( 1980b ) , converted to the photographic ( @xmath37 ) system using the transformation equations given in table 5 of paper i. the six populations shown are the population i main sequence ( ms1 ) , red giants ( rg1 ) and white dwarfs ( wd1 ) and the population ii subdwarfs ( sd2 ) , red giants ( rg2 ) and horizontal branch ( hb2 ) .",
    "chiu made no provision for an intermediate population ii ( i.e. , a  thick disk \" ) , but the ridge lines for such a population would presumably lie somewhere between the population i and population ii ridge lines .",
    "we refer the reader to chiu ( 1980b ) for details of the derivation of the ridge lines , but review and revise here his formulation of the wd1 ridge line since it is particularly germane to the present discussion .",
    "wd1 color - magnitude sequence combines the calibration for da dwarfs by sion & liebert ( 1977 ) for stars blueward of @xmath40 and by greenstein ( 1976 ) for stars redward of @xmath40 . in order to compute the rpmd ridge line for the wd1",
    ", the kinematics adopted were for a standard solar motion of 19.5 km s@xmath2 and a velocity ellipsoid ( @xmath41 ) = ( 35 , 25 , 20 ) km s@xmath2 .",
    "this yields a peak in the @xmath32 distribution at 44 km s@xmath2 .",
    "we have updated chiu s wd1 locus using an empirical color - absolute magnitude relation derived from the recent catalogue of white dwarf parallaxes published by bergeron , legget & ruiz ( 2001 ) . corrected for lutz - kelker ( 1975 ) bias and cleaned of white dwarfs with poor photometry or @xmath42",
    ", this produces the relations :    @xmath43    this color - magnitude relationship is very similar to the greenstein relation for cool white dwarfs and while bergeron et al .",
    "do not have any hot white dwarfs , the blue extrapolation of this curve is similar to the sion & liebert derivation .",
    "this relation is an empirical one derived from the entire bergeron et al .",
    "sample and does not distinguish between da and non - da stars .",
    "however , subsampling by white dwarf type does not significantly alter the color - magnitude relationship , nor does it reduce the dispersion about the best fit relationship . given the lack of spectra with which to classify the white dwarf candidates we identify here as either da or non - da , we believe that the safest method of analysis is to use this empirical relationship for both photometric parallaxes and the derivation of the rpmd ridge line . the dispersion in the fit ( @xmath44=0.5 ) to the color - magnitude relationship",
    "is about twice as large as the dispersion in the color - magnitude relationships used for main sequence stars by siegel et al .",
    "( 2001 ) , resulting in less reliable photometric parallaxes in the white dwarf case . however , the dispersion is smaller than the 0.8 magnitude dispersion in the wd1 color - magnitude relationship used by chiu and therefore represents an improvement over the latter .",
    "the corresponding wd1 ridges lines , adopting chiu s wd1 kinematics , are :    @xmath45    from figure 3 it can be seen that the majority of very red stars lie along the population i main sequence whereas the majority of the bluer stars tend to clump along the sd2 and lower rg2 ridge lines .",
    "this is to be expected since redder stars are mainly nearby , late type dwarfs from the old disk while the bluer stars tend to be several kpc above the galactic plane and are therefore members of the intermediate population ii or halo .",
    "figure 3 also shows a smattering of stars along the upper red giant loci as well as along the wd1 sequence . the main population overlap in the lower part of the rpmd is due to scatter between the wd1 and sd2 populations .",
    "figure 4 highlights the sd2/wd1 region of the rpmd . on the basis of a much larger sample of stars , jones ( 1972b ) suggested that a good dividing line between the wd1 and sd2 populations is @xmath46 , which can be translated to the photographic system with the relations in table 5 of paper i as @xmath47 . using this division ( dotted line in figure 4 ) leaves eleven white dwarf candidates : seven near the chiu wd1 locus and four strung along and just below the jones division line near @xmath48 .",
    "we have also added object ( 17424 ) , located at @xmath49 , the nature of which we will discuss in  3 .",
    "we assemble all available observational data for these twelve objects in tables 2 and 3 .",
    "table 2 gives photometric data : column 1 gives the kron ( 1980 ) catalogue identification , columns 2 and 3 give the @xmath27 magnitude and its error , columns 4 and 5 give the @xmath38 color and its error , columns 6 and 7 give the @xmath50 color and its error , and column 8 gives the variability index , v.i .",
    ", as defined in m91 , and where variability may be taken as v.i .",
    "@xmath51 1.75 .",
    "table 3 gives the astrometric data for the objects : columns 2 and 3 give the right ascension and declination of each object for equinox j2000.0 in epoch 1989.97 , columns 4 and 5 give the proper motion in the direction of the galactic anticenter ( @xmath52 ) and its error , column 6 and 7 give the proper motion in the direction of galactic rotation ( @xmath53 ) and @xmath54 are not defined , we adopt the ngp descriptions @xmath55 and @xmath56 . ] , columns 8 and 9 give the reduced proper motion , @xmath28 , and error , and column 10 gives the proper motion index ( defined as the total proper motion divided by the total proper motion error ) .    while the seven stars near the wd1 locus would seem securely identified as white dwarfs on the basis of both the updated chiu ridge line and the jones criterion , as well as their predominantly blue colors ( at least five and perhaps six are blueward of the sd2 msto ) , the classification of the latter four objects is more ambiguous . because the jones division is based on a much brighter sample of stars , its appropriateness might be questioned in the context of our very deep sample , which likely contains subdwarfs with more extreme kinematics than represented either by chiu s sd2 ridge line or jones subdwarf sample ( which is derived from the yale bright star catalogue ) . for example , among our subdwarfs are members of the  moving group \" discussed in majewski , munn & hawley ( 1994 , 1996 ) , the rpmd of which is shown in majewski ( 1999 ) , where a @xmath57 km s@xmath2 ridge line is found to give a good fit .",
    "it is therefore worthwhile to demarcate from general principles the limit of the domain accessible to the sd2 population .",
    "first , we note that the chiu color - magnitude relation for the sd2 population is identical to that of the ms1 population , but reduced in magnitude by 0.85 magnitudes .",
    "based on the results of the u.s . naval observatory parallax program ( monet et al .",
    "1992 ) , it is known that metal poor stars may be subluminous by as much as 2.5 magnitudes compared to their solar metallicity counterparts .",
    "the dot - dashed line in figure 4 is the sd2 sequence increased first by 1.65 magnitudes , and then by an additional 1.75 magnitudes to account for the increase in 5 log @xmath32 as a result of increasing @xmath32 to the maximum transverse velocity accessible to any star ( from the modal @xmath32 value of 315 km s@xmath2 used by chiu ) .",
    "a reasonable limit to the maximum velocity of an sd2 star is taken to be the galactic escape velocity in the solar neighborhood , 475 km s@xmath2 ( cudworth 1990 ) , with the addition of the up to 231 km s@xmath2 motion of the sun in the galactic rest frame is not taken into account in chiu s formulation of the 5 log @xmath32 distribution as shown in his figure 2b . ]",
    "that can be added as a reflex motion , so that @xmath32=475 + 231=706 km s@xmath2 represents the maximum heliocentric velocity for a star bound to the milky way in the solar neighborhood .",
    "the dot - dashed line in figure 4 marks this absolute limit of main sequence stars in the rpmd .",
    "in addition , the msto for population ii , which is somewhere near @xmath58 , places an additional constraint on the domain of the sd2 population . from these arguments , we conclude that the four points along and just below the jones ( 1972b ) division in figure 4 are not members of the galactic sd2 population .",
    "it is also possible to establish reasonable limits on the vertical extent of the white dwarf population in the rpmd .",
    "no hard _ minimum _ limit to @xmath28 may be established for any stellar population since any star may have arbitrarily small @xmath32 . however , based on the 5 log @xmath32 distribution for population i stars as calculated by chiu ( see his figure 2a ) , a 90% limit for 5 log @xmath32 is @xmath59 and a 75% limit is @xmath60 .",
    "these kinematical limits are indicated by the dashed lines in figure 4 .",
    "it can be seen that the sequence of four points at @xmath61 fall between the 75% and 90% limits of the wd1 sequence .",
    "as there are only seven highly likely white dwarfs ( those nearer the wd1 ridge line ) , it is improbable that more than a couple of white dwarfs would occupy the extreme low velocity ( @xmath62 km s@xmath2 ) wing of the velocity dispersion and the extreme low @xmath28 white dwarf limit .",
    "thus , it may be concluded that most of the four objects along and just below the jones ( 1972b ) division line are neither white dwarfs nor subdwarf stars .",
    "based on the 475 + 231 km s@xmath2 limit on the tangential velocity , the possibility that these objects could be either in the hb2 or the ms1 populations is also excluded .",
    "we will now argue that these four objects are , in fact , most likely to be qso s .",
    "an additional application to which the deep photographic plates discussed in paper i have been applied is the search for faint qsos ( koo , kron & cudworth 1986 , hereafter kkc ; koo & kron 1988 , hereafter kk88 ; t94 ) using a variety of techniques .",
    "the high precision astrometry from paper i , as well as the multi - epoch photometric data produced therein , allow a new search for qsos using the criteria of lack of proper motions and photometric variability ( majewski et al . 1991 , hereafter m91 ; t94 ) .",
    "proper motion data are particularly effective at identifying a major contaminant in color - based qso searches  white dwarfs  and it was the decontamination of the qso sample that partially motivated the present study ( m91 ) . however , the contamination of deep , low proper motion white dwarf samples , such as that discussed here , _ by qsos _ is a potentially more insidious problem given that qsos outnumber white dwarfs by 5:1 to @xmath5 .",
    "we include in figure 4b the location of spectroscopically confirmed qso s in the survey conducted in this field by kron et al .",
    "( 1991 ) and t94 .",
    "as can be seen , several spectroscopically confirmed qsos inhabit the same location in the rpmd as the four questionable objects .",
    "in addition , unlike the seven more likely white dwarfs that fall along the wd1 locus , all of which have very definitely measured proper motions ( i.e. greater than @xmath63 ) , the four objects in question all have measured proper motions less than three times their error ( table 3 ) .    a more complete analysis of the combined proper motion and variability characteristics of stellar objects in this sa57 sample is discussed in m91 and revisited in t94 . in both papers , which have independent photometric analyses ,",

    "using the definition of  variability index ( v.i . ) \" and  proper motion index ( p.m.i . ) \" ( essentially total proper motion divided by its uncertainty ) defined in m91 , where it is found that qso s almost entirely have both p.m.i .",

    "is not variable , but does have p.m.i .",
    "@xmath64 3.0 .",
    "these properties are characteristic of a compact narrow emission line galaxy ( see m91 ) .",
    "finally , the positions of these four questionable objects in the rpmd is so similar to the location of known qsos , we consider it highly probable that all four are qsos ( or compact galaxies ) and consider them as such for the remainder of the paper .",
    "the above discussion should raise a note of caution for those using the rpmd to find white dwarfs at faint magnitudes .",
    "qso s appear to be the an important contaminant of the white dwarf region in the rpmd , especially when the jones criterion is used .",
    "this problem can be avoided by only selecting targets with a certain minimum p.m.i .",
    "( @xmath65 )  assuming that no uncorrected , systematic astrometric effects cause qso s to have a spurious motion ( for example , color errors are a common problem in qso proper motion measurements because qsos have very different spectral energy distributions from stars , see , e.g. , paper i ) . such a proper motion selection , of course , induces a kinematical bias in any analysis of the density distribution or dynamics of white dwarfs . as can be seen from figure 1 , however , a p.m.i .",

    "we call attention to one final object in figures 3 and 4 , located at @xmath49 .",
    "this object ( 17424 ) falls midway between the wd1 and sd2 ridge lines but well below the 75% wd1 line .",
    "jones would not have selected this object as a white dwarf but , again , his sample was biased against finding stars in this part of the rpmd and his selection criterion is a reflection of that fact .",
    "spectroscopy of this object would be useful since the number of intrinsically faint white dwarfs , which determine the faint end of the luminosity function , is small and it is these few white dwarfs that are critical to constraining the age of the galaxy ( see , e.g. wood 1992 ; oswalt et al .",
    "1996 ; k99 and references therein ) through white dwarf cooling theory .",
    "such cool white dwarfs may also be the paradigm macho ( massive compact halo ) objects .",
    "redder white dwarfs have been found as members of common proper motion pairs in proper motion selected surveys ( see , e.g. , hintzen et al 1989 ; silvestri et al .",
    "2001 ) and , recently , in large area surveys such as o01 and k99 .",
    "if 17424 is a true white dwarf , it will have been found without the usual degree of selection bias and it lies nearly twice as far away as the most distant cool white dwarfs in o01 . even if it is not a white dwarf ,",

    "either very subluminous or very high velocity , or both .",
    "we note that it is definitely a star , as it has a 13.5 @xmath4 proper motion measurement .",
    "this leaves us with seven high probability white dwarf candidates , plus one possible red candidate which , however , would have been excluded by the jones ( 1972 ) criterion . in comparison , at least 35 qsos have been confirmed in this field ( kk88 ; m91 ; majewski et al .",
    "1993 ; t94 ) and more are expected to be confirmed ( even excluding the four possible qsos discussed above ",
    "see m91 ) , so that qsos outnumber white dwarfs by at least a factor of five to the magnitude limit of this survey .",
    "in contrast , the ratio of qso s to white dwarfs in the much brighter palomar green survey is 1:5 .    in the course of their qso search using a subset of the plate material used here , kkc , kk88 and t94 identified white dwarfs in the sa57 field based on the combination of color , proper motion , and variability criteria .",
    "the present analysis represents an improvement in the candidate selection in kkc by ( 1 ) significantly more reliable astrometry ( see the comparison of the paper i astrometry to the kkc astrometry in paper i ) , ( 2 ) an improved variability analysis using more plates covering more epochs , and ( 3 ) an improved photometric analysis ( again , even over t94 ) using more standard calibrators as well as more plate measures .",
    "kkc identify eight white dwarf candidates in sa57 , among them the stars 5003 , 10347 , 13612 and 13786 also identified as white dwarfs here ( kkc numbers 71 , 65 , 76 and 69 respectively ) . of the remaining white dwarf candidates kkc identify , subsequent spectroscopy ( kk88 ) has revealed object 10028 ( number 1 in kkc ) to be a qso , object 19387 ( number 51 in kkc ) to be a likely qso , and object 11334 ( number 12 in kkc ) to be a possible main sequence star .",

    "the following analysis of the density law , however , utilizes malmquist - corrected distances .    in order to explore the white dwarf density law ,",
    "we have utilized two statistical tools .",
    "the first is the @xmath83 technique of schmidt ( 1968 , 1975 ) . a good description of the technique may be found in chiu ( 1980a ) .",

    "it is an important but sometimes ignored point that this limit can be photometric _ or astrometric _ , and the latter is often the more stringent . in the case where @xmath89 is imposed by the photometry limit",
    ", we assign @xmath89 for each star as the distance that it would have with the same absolute magnitude , but an apparent magnitude at the limit of the survey , given by @xmath90 or @xmath91 , whichever yields the most distant photometric parallax . for the astrometric limits , rather than assuming a model velocity distribution , we take @xmath89 for each star as the distance at which the proper motion would fall below 3@xmath4 given its transverse velocity .",
    "@xmath89 is therefore defined as :    @xmath92\\ ] ]    column 8 in table 2 gives @xmath89 for each white dwarf .",
    "the assumed disk density law is @xmath93 where @xmath94 is the scaleheight , @xmath95 is the scale length , @xmath96 and @xmath97 are the solar height and radius , respectively and @xmath98 is the local density normalization .",
    "the parameters of @xmath95 , @xmath97 and @xmath96 are taken from siegel et al .",
    "( 2001 ) .",
    "the values of @xmath99 as a function of scaleheight have been calculated for a variety of subsamples , as summarized in table 5 and figure 5 .",
    "the mean value of @xmath83 should be 0.5 when the correct density law is adopted .",
    "it should be noted that the cool white dwarf candidate 17424 , which may actually be an extremely metal - poor , high velocity subdwarf , is near the magnitude limit of the survey .",
    "it therefore has a high @xmath83 and has a large influence on the calculation of @xmath99 for our small sample .",
    "therefore , families of curves are shown in figure 5 both including this object as a white dwarf ( solid lines ) and excluding it ( dotted lines ) .    an important assumption implicit in adopting",
    "the above density law is that a _ single _ such density law applies .",
    "however , when probing to deep magnitudes , it is possible that a non - negligible fraction of the white dwarf sample may be from population ii .",
    "as discussed above , two of the white dwarf candidates in table 2 have somewhat more extreme kinematics , which may identify them as thick disk or halo members .",
    "in addition , star 17424 , which dominates the @xmath100 density calculation , is redder , cooler and thus possibly older than the bulk of our stars and is the most likely , based on color , to be part of an old population ( although it is kinematically cold in @xmath77 and @xmath101 velocities ) .",
    "thus , we have tested subsamples with various of the white dwarfs ( table 5 ) excluded under the assumption that they are not members of the thin disk ( either on the basis of distance or kinematics ) or not white dwarfs at all ( i.e. 17424 ) and we have sought the best fit @xmath99 .    the largest error in the calculation of @xmath99 is the sampling error , given by @xmath102 ( chiu 1980a ) , where @xmath103 is the number of stars in the calculation , and is 0.12 - 0.10 for @xmath103 = 6 - 8 .",
    "thus , a reasonable range of @xmath99 that might be expected when the correct density law has been adopted is 0.38 - 0.62 . from figure 5 and table 5",
    "it can be seen that with object 17424 excluded , the various subsamples give @xmath99 = 0.5 at @xmath104 550 pc , but a large range of scaleheights  300 pc to greater than 1000 pc  is acceptable .",
    "when star 17424 is included , @xmath99 = 0.5 occurs at @xmath104 700 pc , and the minimum  reasonable \" scaleheight ( when @xmath99 = 0.62 ) is about 350 pc .",
    "these exceptionally large scaleheights are in conflict with the more modest white dwarf scaleheights typically derived  for example , boyle s ( 1989 ) scaleheight of @xmath105 pc  although chiu ( 1980a ) obtained similarly high ( 400 - 500 pc ) scaleheights for his relatively deep ( @xmath106 ) sample of white dwarfs .",
    "recent results from starcount analyses of non - degenerate stars include thin disk scale heights of 280 pc ( siegel et al .",

    "the method of maximum likelihood provides a different likelihood estimation than the @xmath99 method .",
    "the method of maximum likelihood is generally favored in any analysis of a small sample of data points because of it s unique sensitivity ( bevington & robinson 1992 ) . the likelihood function in this particular application would defined by :    @xmath107    although this function gives the appearance of having units of pc@xmath2 , the numerator is intrinsically integrated over a delta function for the distance of each white dwarf ( uncertainty having already been corrected from malmquist bias ) .",
    "this unseen delta function produces a dimensionless likelihood .",
    "the maximum likelihood is then normalized to the posterior probability by integrating the probability distribution over a uniform prior probability distribution with scaleheights of @xmath108 ( a reasonable range of possible values ) .",
    "the most likely scaleheight values obtained are shown in the last column of table 5 and illustrated in figure 6 . in this method , stars are not assigned to a particular population but are given a probability distribution based on their spatial position and the distribution of the relevant populations .",
    "thus , a full model including a thick disk and halo populations , as well as radial density variations as defined in siegel et al . ( 2001 ) is appropriate . only the thin disk scale height was varied since the likelihood proved very insensitive to thick disk parameters and completely insensitive to halo parameters .",
    "the method of maximum likelihood should be less sensitive to small number statistics than is @xmath99 .",
    "as may be seen , the parameters derived from various subsamples of the white dwarf candidates yield smaller scaleheights , a smaller overall range of results , and the star 17424 has a far smaller impact upon the derivation of the scaleheight ( although it significantly alters the local normalization ) .",
    "nevertheless , as may be seen , large scaleheights ( @xmath109 pc ) are still found with this method and the range of acceptable scaleheights is still quite large .",
    "if we take the 2@xmath4 uncertainty in the scaleheight to be the point at which the likelihood is half its peak value , possible maximum likelihood scaleheights range from 220 to 890 pc .",
    "if our candidates are actual white dwarfs ( and the data for all but 17424 strongly suggest that they are ) , they increase the sky density of white dwarfs to @xmath5 to more than 20 deg@xmath15 ( as high as 27 deg @xmath15 if all eight candidates are real white dwarfs ) , an order of magnitude larger than that found by k99 , the previously most complete white dwarf survey to date .",
    "given the increased sky density provided by this population , one might expect a significant impact on the derived local white dwarf density and luminosity function .",
    "however , as wood & oswalt ( 1998 ) and mendez & ruiz ( 2001 ) have argued , incompleteness in white dwarf surveys does not impact estimates of the local luminosity function or density . we have shown that their analysis , based on monte carlo simulations , is correct , at least as it pertains to the present study .",
    "our sample represents almost exclusively a _ distant _ ( @xmath110 ) population .",
    "table 5 summarizes the local white dwarf density associated with each curve in figure 5 on the basis of the @xmath111 technique for each scaleheight derivation .",
    "as can be seen , extrapolation of our density laws to @xmath112 provides local densities in the range of values obtained by other groups ( see below ) . here",
    ", however , our results succumb to the vagaries of small number statistics .",
    "fleming , liebert & green ( 1986 ) derived a local white dwarf density of 0.49 @xmath113 0.05 per 1000 pc@xmath114 for white dwarfs with @xmath115 12.75 , while boyle ( 1989 ) derived 0.60 @xmath113 0.09 per 1000 pc@xmath114 for @xmath115 12.75 .",
    "we provide data for our five stars with @xmath115 12.75 in table 5 and figure 5 ( dashed curve ) . for these intrinsically brighter white dwarfs we do obtain a lower scaleheight , 450 pc , but this value is still higher than boyle s .",
    "our derived local density for @xmath115 12.75 white dwarfs is consistent with both previously named studies , but only when the higher scaleheight is used ; adopting boyle s lower scaleheight results in a significantly higher local density , inconsistent with other surveys . for the entire sample ,",

    "2000 ) and possibly fainter ( fuchs & jahrei 1998 ) .",
    "the history of direct searches for a population ii white dwarf microlensing population includes several contentious studies .",

    "hdf white dwarf density is inconsistent with the lhs .",
    "the most recent stirring of this debate is the claim by o01 to have detected 38 cool , halo white dwarfs .",
    "reid et al . ( 2001 ) and reyle et al . (",
    "2001 ) have argued that the kinematical properties of these dwarfs are consistent with stars of the galactic thick disk according to the most recent models . on the other hand , hansen ( 2001 ) and",
    "koopmans & blandford ( 2001 ) argue for , respectively , thin disk and halo membership of the o01 white dwarfs .",
    "however , both of the latter studies assume a thick disk contribution similar to those favored by earlier galactic structure studies ( e.g. , gilmore & reid 1983 , reid & majewski 1993 ) in which the thick disk contributes 2% of the local stars .",
    "more recent studies favor a larger local thick disk contribution ( coupled with smaller scale heights ) in the range of 5 - 10% ( robin et al .",
    "1996 ; siegel et al . 2001",
    "; chen et al . 2001 ) . a large local thick disk density could account for the majority of the o01 white dwarfs since they are an entirely local sample .",
    "our contribution to the debate over the o01 claim is that our study is complete enough to show that within a few thin disk scaleheights , the dominant white dwarf population has @xmath71 and @xmath20 velocity distributions similar to thin disk m dwarfs ( reid et al . 1995 ) .",
    "this does not support the hypothesis of hansen ( 2001 ) that the o01 white dwarfs could be the result of an inflated velocity dispersion among the thin disk white dwarfs ; our results indicate no inflation of the pop i white dwarf velocity dispersion beyond the dispersion seen in other pop i stars with a large fraction of old members velocity dispersion , this inflation is slight and would not be significant enough to account for the velocity dispersion of the o01 white dwarfs . ] .",
    "hansen s argument was motivated by the fact that the age distribution of the o01 white dwarfs is too young for thick disk membership .",
    "the _ a priori _ assumption in this argument is that the thick disk should be uniformly old and distinct from the thin disk .",
    "the fact that our more astrometrically complete sample shows a normal velocity dispersion of thin disk - like white dwarfs implies that the origin of the o01 sample is more likely to be a thick disk that is _ not _ uniformly old , as opposed to an inflated thin disk .",
    "if that is the case , o01 would be a significant discovery against models that favor any early formation of the thick disk .",
    "more astrometrically complete large - area follow - up surveys would allow one to see the transition from an o01-like velocity dispersion sample to an old thin disk - like sample as we have here .",
    "they would show if the transition is smooth ( as expected for top - down disk formation models ) or discontinuous ( as a result of sudden heating of the thin disk ) .",
    "unfortunately , our own survey can not test the halo white dwarf density very well in a direct way .",
    "we do not find any candidate halo white dwarfs .",
    "although stars 5003 and 10347 have relatively high velocities , their magnitude is more like that expected of the thick disk than halo , and in any case these two stars are not the ultracool white dwarfs that have traditionally been sought for microlensing candidates . on the other hand",
    ", we probe a very small volume . for white dwarfs at @xmath122 ( the average absolute magnitude of stars in the o01 survey )",
    "we probe a volume of 500 cubic parsecs , which should net only 0.1 halo white dwarfs based on density normalizations from starcounts surveys ( reid et al .",
    "if , as the microlensing results suggest , white dwarfs account for 20% of the dark halo , then we would expect two halo white dwarfs in our sample .",
    "our failure to detect any ( ignoring the possibility of an extreme radial velocity for one of our dwarf candidates that would result in a peculiar velocity totaling that of a halo star ) suggests that any theoretical white dwarf microlenses would have to be fainter than @xmath122 or that the 20% fractional contribution of white dwarfs to the halo dark mass is too high ( or that we are just  unlucky \" ) .",
    "we note , however , that for very faint dwarfs ( @xmath123 ) , our volume shrinks to a piddling 60 cubic parsecs , so we are not very sensitive to such dim objects .",
    "this emphasizes the point that for faint halo white dwarf searches , even precise astrometry and deep photometry are no substitute for surveying expansive areas of sky .",

    "this permits an enormous amount of freedom in interpreting the results of these studies because one must define the velocity distribution function for _ each _ galactic population based on _ a priori _ assumptions rather than observational constraint .",
    "our study illustrates the usefulness of more astrometrically complete data sets that can define the complete velocity distribution of thin disk , thick disk and halo white dwarfs . such definition will allow clearer context of the nature of the high velocity white dwarfs normally studied .    while we do not detect any halo macho candidates , our results still bear on the interpretation of the microlensing results .",
    "alcock et al . ( 2000 ) derived the fractional contribution to the dark matter and average mass of macho s based on a variety of galactic models to account for the microlensing of known stellar populations .",
    "their standard model assumed a thin disk scaleheight of 300 pc based on previous analyses of main - sequence stars .",
    "however , if the scaleheight of the microlensing material in the thin disk is _ not _ equivalent to the apparent scaleheight of brighter main sequence stars ",
    "i.e. , if it is closer to 450 pc , as we have derived here for the white dwarfs  this potentially increases the column density of foreground lenses by 50% , resulting in a similar line - of - sight depth to the  maximal disk \" model explored in alcock et al .",

    "a macho halo with these properties would be less likely to be comprised of white dwarfs .",
    "if the white dwarf thin disk scaleheight is 450 pc , then white dwarfs can not be the macho population .",

    "under the assumption that all proposed candidates are _ bona fide _ white dwarfs , the results of the present rpmd analysis of the paper i survey has yielded a sky density of likely white dwarfs higher by an order of magnitude over the previous most complete samples .",
    "our candidates represent the ( expected ) low velocity component of the disk white dwarf population excluded by previous proper motion searches .",
    "several of our candidate white dwarfs are fainter and redder than the disk and halo msto , so that previous photometric ( e.g. , uv excess ) surveys would not easily have found them .",

    "although wood & oswalt ( 1998 ) and mendez & ruiz ( 2001 ) have shown that incompleteness does not significantly bias derivation of the luminosity function or local density ( and we concur that the incompleteness we describe here does not likely bias derivation of the local density ) , they do note that deriving star formation histories from biased samples is highly susceptible to error when the proper motion errors are large ( @xmath51 100 mas yr@xmath2 ) .",
    "the tenfold gain in completeness in a large area survey with the photometric depth and astrometric precision of ours would improve the resolution with which star formation histories could be delineated from the white dwarf luminosity function .",

    "our distant white dwarf candidates , while a small sample , provide leverage on the density law well above the galactic midplane and suggest a higher white dwarf scaleheight than typically assumed , where the  old disk scaleheight \" of 250 - 350 pc falls at the very low end of the  reasonable \" range of scaleheights derived from the entire candidate white dwarf sample .",
    "it is noted that the lowest luminosity white dwarf candidates contribute the highest @xmath83 on average , and when they are excluded the derived scaleheight is lowered , though it remains high compared to white dwarf studies at brighter magnitudes . that we should find white dwarfs to have higher scaleheights than non - degenerate stars seems , at first blush , consistent with white dwarf cooling theory",
    ": one might expect the proportion of old stars among white dwarfs to be higher than among unevolved late - type stars and we might expect the highest vertical velocity dispersions for the oldest stars due to secular dynamical heating processes that progressively increase vertical velocity dispersions of stars with time . yet , the notion of a relatively more heated white dwarf population appears to be at odds with the actual kinematics we measure for our sample of candidate white dwarfs .",
    "one might ask what such a dynamically cold population is doing at such large @xmath127 .",
    "we note that our velocity data do not fall along the strmberg asymmetric drift relation ( binney & merrifield 1998 ) expected for secularly heated disk stars .",

    "<S> the reduced proper motion diagram ( rpmd ) for a complete sample of 819 faint ( @xmath0 ) stars with high accuracy proper motions ( @xmath1 mas yr@xmath2 ) in an area of 0.3 deg@xmath3 in the north galactic pole field sa57 is investigated . </S>",
    "<S> eight stars with very large reduced proper motions are identified as faint white dwarf candidates . on the basis of larger than 6@xmath4 measured proper motions and the lack of photometric variability over a twenty year baseline , we discriminate these white dwarf candidates from the several times more numerous qsos , which can potentially occupy a similar location in the rpmd . for comparison , </S>",
    "<S> less than 4@xmath4 proper motions and photometric variability are found in all but one of 35 spectroscopically confirmed qsos in the same field .    </S>",
    "<S> while spectroscopic confirmation of their status as white dwarfs is a necessary , but difficult , outstanding task , we discuss the implausibility that these stars could be any kind of survey contaminant . </S>",
    "<S> high quality proper motions lend confidence in our ability to separate white dwarfs from subdwarfs in the rpmd . if _ bona fide _ </S>",
    "<S> white dwarfs , the eight candidates found here represent a portion of the white dwarf population that hitherto has remained uninvestigated by previous surveys by virtue of the faint magnitudes and low proper motions of the stars . </S>",
    "<S> this faint , low velocity sample represents an increase in the white dwarf sky surface density to @xmath5 by an order of magnitude over that found in the previously most complete surveys to this depth . </S>",
    "<S> however , because the majority of the stars discovered here are at projected distances of more than a disk scaleheight above the galactic midplane , their existence does not affect significantly the typical estimates of the local white dwarf density . on the other hand , as distant white dwarf candidates with low , typically thin disk - like transverse velocities ( @xmath6 km s@xmath2 ) , the newly discovered stars suggest a disk white dwarf scaleheight larger than the values of 250 - 350 pc typically assumed in assessments of the local white dwarf density ( and thought to characterize the galactic old thin disk in stellar population models ) . </S>",
    "<S> both a @xmath7 and a more complex maximum likelihood analysis of the spatial distribution of our likely thin disk white dwarfs yield scaleheights of 400 - 600 pc while at the same time give a reasonable match to the _ local _ white dwarf volume density found in other surveys ( although this good match is a result of the dominance of the one relatively nearby white dwarf in the @xmath8 density calculation ) . </S>",
    "<S> a high scaleheight persists even if the relatively small sample is pruned of any potential thick disk or halo white dwarfs .    while our work is not optimized toward the study of halo white dwarfs as potential macho objects , our results do have interesting implications for this hypothesis . </S>",
    "<S> we can place some direct constraints ( albeit weak ones ) on the contribution of halo white dwarfs to the dark matter of the galaxy . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , the elevated scale height that we measure for the thin disk could alter the interpretation of microlensing results to the extent of making white dwarfs untenable as the dominant macho contributor . </S>"
