    "the modulation frequency at the center of each peak ( or dip ) is equal to a multiple of the cavity fsr , while the full width at half maximum of the on - resonance data gives the linewidth .",

    "<S> precise knowledge of an optical device s frequency response is crucial for it to be useful in most applications . </S>",
    "<S> traditional methods for determining the frequency response of an optical system ( e.g. optical cavity or waveguide modulator ) usually rely on calibrated broadband photo - detectors or complicated rf mixdown operations . as the bandwidths of these devices continue to increase , there is a growing need for a characterization method that does not have bandwidth limitations , or require a previously calibrated device . we demonstrate a new calibration technique on an optical system ( consisting of an optical cavity and a high - speed waveguide modulator ) that is free from limitations imposed by detector bandwidth , and does not require a calibrated photo - detector or modulator . </S>",
    "<S> we use a low - frequency ( dc ) photo - detector to monitor the cavity s optical response as a function of modulation frequency , which is also used to determine the modulator s frequency response . </S>",
    "<S> knowledge of the frequency - dependent modulation depth allows us to more precisely determine the cavity s characteristics ( free spectral range and linewidth ) . </S>",
    "<S> the precision and repeatability of our technique is demonstrated by measuring the different resonant frequencies of orthogonal polarization cavity modes caused by the presence of a non - linear crystal . once the modulator has been characterized using this simple method , the frequency response of any passive optical element can be determined . </S>"
