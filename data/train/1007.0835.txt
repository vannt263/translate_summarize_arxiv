    "physics of unstable nuclei have attracted much attention both experimentally and theoretically @xcite .",

    "these include i ) a large extension of density distribution , referred to as halo or skin structure@xcite , ii ) a narrow momentum distribution@xcite , and iii ) a large concentration of the dipole strength distribution at low energies@xcite . for @xmath6li and @xmath7he nuclei ,",
    "the so called borromean structure has also been discussed extensively @xcite .",

    "the pairing interaction between the valence neutrons plays an essential role in stabilizing these nuclei @xcite .",
    "one of the topics of current interest in physics of unstable nuclei is dineutron correlations in neutron - rich nuclei .",

    "this feature is enhanced significantly when the binding is weak as in @xmath6li and @xmath7he nuclei .",
    "the recent experimental observation of the strong low - lying dipole strength distribution in the @xmath6li nucleus @xcite has provided an experimental signature of the existence of strong dineutron correlation in this nucleus .    in this paper , we discuss whether there exists a similar correlation in proton - rich nuclei .",

    "the two - proton emission decay has been observed from the first excited state of @xmath0ne nucleus@xcite , which suggests that the structure of @xmath0ne can be understood as a three - body system of @xmath1o+@xmath8 .",
