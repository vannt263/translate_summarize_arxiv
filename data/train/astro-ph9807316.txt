    "are solved numerically ( baumgarte et al . , 1995 , 1996 ) .",
    "in order to simplify the problem for obtaining a rapid approximate answer for such a questions , like collapse behaviour of different stellar masses , comparative neutrino light curves and their spectra , a simplified method is suggested .",
    "it is based on the classical galerkin method , widely used in different mechanical and physical problems , connected with numerical computations ( fletcher , 1984 ) . for the problem of stellar collapse this method",
    "may be considered as a generalization of the well known energetic method , which was applied for calculations of stellar stability ( zeldovich and novikov , 1965 , 1967 ) and initial stages of stellar collapse ( bisnovatyi - kogan , 1968 ) in post - newtonian approximation ( pn ) . here",
    "we formulate the galerkin method for the problems of relativistic collapse in gr .",
    "consider first the formulation of the energetic method in pn .",
    "the main idea of this method is an averaging of the static or dynamic equations over the volume , using a given prescribed density distribution inside the star .",
    "we consider here only spherically symmetric stars , where the density is prescribed by polytropic distribution with a central density , obtained from algebraic ( static ) or ordinary differential ( dynamics ) equation .",
    "consider polytropic equation of state @xmath3 .",
    "combining the equilibrium and continuity equations , we get the equation for @xmath4 @xmath5    = -4\\pi g\\rho r^2.\\ ] ] where @xmath6 is the euler radial coordinate , @xmath7 is the density . transforming to dimensionless quantities ( chandrasekhar , 1939 ) @xmath8 and @xmath9 , defined as @xmath10^{1/2 }    \\gamma=1+{1\\over n}\\mbox{,}\\ ] ] where @xmath11 is an polytrope index , @xmath12 is the central density , gives the equilibrium lane - emden equation @xmath13 with the boundary conditions @xmath14 .",
    "the stellar boundary corresponds to @xmath15 so that @xmath16 .",
    "the stellar mass @xmath17 expressed in terms of variables ( [ ref34.2 ] ) becomes @xmath18 @xmath19^{3/2 }    \\rho_c^{{3\\over 2n}-{1\\over 2}}\\int_0^{{\\xi_1 } } \\theta^n\\xi^2 d\\xi.\\ ] ] and hence from ( [ ref34.3 ] ) , @xmath20 obviously , at @xmath21 , @xmath22 the stellar mass is independent of @xmath12 and is exactly determined by the constant @xmath23 in the equation of state .",
    "the stellar mass increases at @xmath24 with increasing @xmath12 , and at @xmath25 decreases .",
    "if the polytropic power coincides with the adiabatic power , @xmath26 , then the star is stable at @xmath24 and unstable at @xmath25 , and @xmath22 corresponds to the boundary case and represents the indifferent equilibrium .",
    "real stars are not polytropes , but the condition @xmath22 is approximately valid at the boundary of stability if @xmath27 is treated as an adiabatic power properly averaged over the star . a strict derivation of stability conditions , including gr , is made by use of the variational method ( harrison et al . , 1965 ) . equating the first variation to zero yields the equilibrium equation , while the stability condition requires the second variation to be positive . for an isentropic polytrope with @xmath22 ,",
    "@xmath12 is arbitrary , whereas the density distribution @xmath28 is invariant against homologous contraction or expansion .",
    "let us treat these properties as valid also for the case where is @xmath22 only in average .",
    "we then derive the equilibrium and stability conditions , using the simplified variational method based on the assumption of homology and conservation of stellar structure at density variations ( zeldovich and novikov , 1967 ) , usually called energetic method .",
    "write down the total energy of an instantaneously static star analogous to the potential energy of consevative mechanical system : @xmath29 the first term here represents the internal energy @xmath30 , the second the newtonian gravitational energy @xmath31 , and the third , @xmath32 , a small gr correction @xmath33 evaluated by zeldovich and novikov ( 1967 ) for the matter distribution over a @xmath21 polytrope .",

    "for @xmath53 the main reason of instability are gr effects .",
    "the entropy of such supermassive stars in critical state is so large that the pressure is determined mainly by the radiation with a small admixture of plasma , important for stability , but giving a very short time until the onset of instability . a common way to overcome",

    ". a necessity of a presence of a dark matter in modern cosmological models makes it important to include it into stability analysis of supermassive stars .",

    "the influence of a hot dark matter , which density does not change during perturbations , should be taken by account of a newtonian gravitational energy of the star in the dark matter potential , because gr effects of a dark matter are of a higher order of magnitude ( mclaughlin , fuller , 1996 ) .",

    "consider a rigid rotation , when its energy is a small correction to the energy of radiation and the energetic method is a good approach . when losses of an angular momentum during evolution are negligible we distinguish between rapidly rotating ( rr ) and slowly rotating ( sr ) superstars .",
    "in rr case a superstar reaches the state of rotational equatorial breaking before loosing its dynamical instability , and in sr case instability comes first .",
    "if a superstar has an angular momentum @xmath83 , then its rotational energy @xmath84 , and a ratio @xmath85 remains constant during evolution ( bisnovatyi - kogan , zeldovich , novikov , 1967 ) . in presence of rotation and dark matter the critical value of the adiabatic index @xmath86",
    "is written as    @xmath87    and the relations for determination of a critical central density , instead of ( [ ref9 ] ) , is written as    @xmath88    as follows from ( [ ref11 ] ) , a superstar does dot loose its stability when @xmath89 .",
    "this qualitative result , obtained in the post - newtonian approximation , remains to be valid in a strong gravitational field and reflects a presence of a limiting specific angular momentum @xmath90 , so that a black holes with a kerr metric may exist only at @xmath91 ( misner , thorne , wheeler , 1973 ) .",
    "a rr superstar in a course of the evolution reaches instead a limit of a rotational instability , and equatorial mass shedding begins , leading to a loss of an angular momentum .",

    "as may be seen from fig.1 , the stabilizing effect of rotation on the mass - shedding curve at @xmath102 is more important , then stabilization by a hot dark matter , which influence decreases at increasing of a central density . with account of a longer state of the evolution with mass loss until reaching the point of the loss of stability at larger @xmath83 , this conclusion becomes even stronger .",
    "to study dynamical processes by the energetic method we use , instead of the energy variation , the energy conservation law in the form    @xmath103    here @xmath104 is the kinetic energy of the superstar . using thermodynamic relation we get    @xmath105 @xmath106 from the mass conservation law , in presence of homologycal motion with the fixed density distribution in space ( [ ref34.17 ] ) ,",
