    "the study of high redshift damped  absorption systems ( hereafter dlas ) detected in the optical spectra of qsos is now recognized as a powerful means to investigate the properties of distant galaxies or protogalaxies .",
    "many characteristics of the associated intervening objects can be determined from absorption line data :  column density , metallicity , ionization state and velocity distribution of the gas . for radio - loud quasars ,",
    "even more physical parameters are accessible such as the temperature of the  gas ( if 21  cm absorption has been searched for ) or faraday rotation measures induced by the intervening plasma .",
    "the large @xmath1 values together with the low ionization degree and small velocity dispersion inferred from ground - based observations for the @xmath17 absorbers bear much resemblance to the properties observed in local galactic disks ( wolfe et al .",
    "further , in average , metals are observed to be underabundant with respect to solar values but by a factor of typically 10 ( pettini et al . 1997a ) which is naturally accounted for by cosmic evolution ( pei & fall 1995 ) .",
    "dlas are therefore believed to trace the internal regions of distant `` normal '' galaxies or their progenitors up to the redshifts of the most distant qsos known to date ( @xmath18 ) .",

    "indeed , because of their anticipated faintness and low angular separation to the qso , it is very difficult to detect and characterize the associated intervening objects using images obtained from the ground ( see e.g. boiss & boulade 1990 ; steidel et al .",
    "1994a ) . in the latter",
    ", the presence of normal galaxies can be detected at low impact parameters but their morphological type , magnitude or extent can hardly be determined due to blending with the bright qso image .",
    "fainter objects or galaxies at angular separations smaller than about 0.5  can not be reliably detected .    in a previous paper ( le brun et al .",
    "1997 , hereafter paper i ) , we used high angular resolution hst images to search for galaxies close to the line of sight of qsos with @xmath24 damped ( or candidate damped )  systems .",
    "thanks to a careful subtraction of the qso image , we could show that galaxy - like objects are always present at small impact parameters and that , contrary to  absorbers , damped  lines are associated with objects displaying a broad range of morphologies and surface brightness .",
    "the present paper is devoted to a spectroscopic study of the same qso sample .",
    "our primary aim is to complement data already obtained on a few intermediate redshift systems ( steidel et al .",
    "1993 ; cohen et al .",
    "1994 ; cohen et al .",
    "1996 ) and investigate several other cases that have not yet been studied .",
    "more specifically we wish i ) to determine the  column density and confirm the damped nature of each system , ii ) to detect metal lines suitable for measuring the relative abundance of heavy elements and iii ) to investigate other properties such as the amount of dust and molecules .",
    "since we now have some information on the morphological type , luminosity and extent of the intervening galaxies and know which part of them is probed by the qso sightline , qso spectra can give important clues to connect the absorption line data to our knowledge of nearby galaxies .",
    "more generally , such a global study of systems at intermediate redshift ( i.e. intermediate look - back time ) is essential to better understand the cosmic evolution of the damped  absorbers from @xmath25 up to @xmath26 ( pettini et al .",
    "1997a ) .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in sect .",
    "2 , we present the observations and data analysis . the main new results emerging from the spectra are summarized for each target in sect . 3 while in sect .",
    "4 , we discuss the properties of the dlas that can be inferred from the new fos data . some other metal - rich systems of interest are presented in sect .",
    "finally , we discuss the implications of these observations on the cosmic evolution of damped  absorbers and the bias induced by dust extinction on the apparent properties of the large @xmath1 systems .",
    "since no confirmed dlas had been discovered by the hst at the time when our study was undertaken , we had to rely on the presence of 21  cm absorption or a high @xmath27 ratio to select our targets ( see paper i for details ) .",
    "three quasars in our sample satisfy the first criterion : 3c  196 , pks  1229@xmath3021 and 3c  286 .",
    "it is to be noted that the presence of 21  cm absorption does not necessarily guarantee that the  line is damped because part of the radio flux originates from extended components such as jets or lobes ( 3c  196 and pks  1229@xmath3021 ) and the  distribution in the absorber may exhibit spatial structure at scales comparable to the extent of these features .",
    "the other three objects , ex  0302@xmath3223 , pks  0454 + 039 and q  1209 + 107 , have a system with a high @xmath28 ratio .    we have retrieved from the hst database the g270h spectrum of ex  0302@xmath3223 which has been observed by another team ( program 6224 , dataset y2sh0103 t ) .",
    "the main characteristics of the qsos and absorption systems of interest , as well as the log of the hst observations , are given in table  [ obslog ] ( the absolute magnitudes of the candidate absorbers listed in paper i are affected by an error ; corrected values are given in table  [ obslog ] ) .",
    "the only modifications introduced to the hst pipe - line reduced data involves the wavelength scale and zero point of the intensity scale .",
    "when two distinct exposures were obtained for a given object and grism , the two spectra were averaged ( with weights according to the exposure time ) . to define the absolute wavelength scale ,",
    "we apply uniform shifts determined using strong galactic lines from singly ionized species , the latter being assumed at rest . in some spectra , no such line is seen with a good enough signal - to - noise ratio ; we then rely on strong unblended lines from already known absorption systems with well determined optical redshifts .",
    "further , when a common transition is detected both in the g190h and g270h spectra , this feature is used to constrain the relative shift of these two spectra .",
    "the shifts applied to the original wavelengths for pks  0454 + 039 , pks  1229@xmath3021 and 3c  286 are 1.4 , 2.3 and 1.2    respectively for the g190h spectra and 1.5 , 2.3 and 1.8    for the g270h data ( the g270h spectrum of ex  0302@xmath3223 has been shifted by @xmath29    ) . for the g160l data , only the strongest absorption features from known systems",
    "are useful ;",
    "@xmath30    and 6    have been added to the original wavelengths for q  1209 + 107 and 3c  196 respectively .    regarding the intensity scale",
    ", we used the profiles of damped  lines or of lyman edges to determine the true zero level . generally , damped  lines seen in the high resolution data do not go exactly to zero , even when they are clearly saturated at the line core .",
    "although the observed offsets are quite small , they would have a significant effect on the fitting procedures , so we subtracted them .",
    "these offsets are generally positive and are presumably due to scattered light in the instrument",
    ". their effect on @xmath31 measurements is however always negligible as compared to @xmath32 .",
    "figures [ spec0302 ] to [ spec3c286 ] present the spectra obtained for ex  0302@xmath3223 ( g270h ) , pks  0454 + 039 ( g190h and g270h ) , 3c  196 and q  1209 + 107 ( g160l ) , pks  1229@xmath3021 and 3c  286 ( g190h and g270h ) .",
    "the full width at half - maximum ( fwhm ) of an unresolved line is 1.5 , 2.0 and 6.3    in the g190h , g270h and g160l data respectively .",
    "all spectra are given in flux units of @xmath33 erg 2  s@xmath34 @xmath34 .",
    "the detection , measurement and identification of all absorption lines have been performed interactively . the uncertainty on observed equivalent widths",
    "is derived ( in the same manner as young et al .",
    "1979 ) from the noise level measured in selected portions of the spectra which look free from any absorption line . for weak unresolved features",
    ", @xmath32 lies in the range 0.06  0.10    over most of all the g190h and g270h ranges ( 0.07  0.08    being by far the most common values ) .",
    "locally , @xmath32 can be smaller ( e.g. on emission lines where values as low as @xmath35    are reached ) or larger ( e.g. when blending occurs ) .",
    "the central wavelengths of the absorption lines are obtained by fitting a gaussian to the observed profile ( after normalizing the adjacent continuum if necessary , e.g. for absorption lines located on an emission line ) . for the identification of features significant at the @xmath36 level , we first search for absorption from already known metal systems using the list of strong lines given by bahcall et al .",
    "( 1993 ; their table 1 ) .",
    "the presence of weaker transitions that might be expected on the basis of the results obtained in this first step is then examined , especially from the dlas , for which we accept lines at a lower significance level .",
    "to this aim , we consider the extensive line list given by verner et al . ( 1994 ) . the identification is performed on the basis of criteria involving redshift agreement , line width as compared to the instrumental profile and relative strength , when several transitions from the same species are detected .",
    "when two or more lines strongly overlap , wavelengths and equivalent widths are measured after deblending .",
    "this was performed using the context fit / lyman developed by a. fontana within midas , the eso data analysis software package ; this routine was also used to fit line profiles and extract gaseous column densities for damped  lines or lyman edges . among the lines left unidentified , we have searched for the presence of metal doublets and , in the  forest , for lines from the lyman series possibly associated with the strongest candidate  features .",
    "this results in the line lists given in tables  [ q0302list ] to [ q3c286list ] . for ex  0302@xmath3223 , only lines from metal systems are given in table  [ q0302list ] .",
    "although the s / n ratio is quite good , some ambiguities remain due to 1 ) the large number of absorption features expected from the dlas and 2 ) the presence in ex  0302@xmath3223 , pks  0454 + 039 and pks  1229@xmath3021 of several other metal systems .",
    "when two or more transitions might contribute to a given feature , they are indicated in the tables .",
    "le brun & bergeron ( 1997 ) have performed an identification of  absorbers in the field of 3c  286 and give for this object a more extensive list of candidate  lines ( down to the @xmath37 significance level ) .",
    "here , we briefly summarize spectroscopic data previously obtained on our targets and indicate the main results provided by the new spectra .",
    "metal - rich absorption systems have been mentioned for this object at @xmath38 (: bergeron , unpublished ) and @xmath39 (   and : petitjean & bergeron 1990 ) .",

    "no less than four new metal systems are detected . in agreement with the prediction made in paper i , relatively strong lines from  and",

    "the hst data do not confirm the @xmath46 and 0.9874 candidate damped  lines proposed by lanzetta et al .",
    "( 1995 ) ( the former turns out to be  at 1.3284 ) .      before this study ,",

    "one additional motivation for observing this qso is the presence of two intervening galaxies detected by steidel et al .",

    "an additional system is present at @xmath54 .",
    "the g160l hst data presented by cohen et al .",
    "( 1996 ) show that , unfortunately , the latter produces a lyman edge nearly coincident with the  line at @xmath55 , which renders the determination of @xmath1 very difficult .",
    "an additional source of uncertainty in the analysis is related to the possible contribution of scattered light which makes the zero of the intensity scale ill defined . our new ( post - costar ) spectrum ,",
    "although of lower integration time , is of interest in this regard . in order to perform a quantitative comparison",

    "once corrected , the two spectra appear in quite good agreement but a systematic difference is seen in the blue wing of the  emission line ( fig .",
    "[ spec3c196 ] ) .",
    "if not instrumental , such an effect could be due to variable  absorption from gas ejected by the qso ; the time elapsed between the two observations is 2.05 yr and during that interval the amount or ionization degree of the gas may have changed ( see e.g. schartel et al .",
    "1997 for another example of variable absorption ) .",
    "an alternative possibility is intrinsic emission line variability .",
    "variable bal - type absorption is supported by two facts : i ) the gas responsible for the @xmath57 narrow absorption ( to which the higher velocity gas is probably associated ) is known to cover only partially the broad line region ( cohen et al .",
    "1996 ) and ii ) only a small variation of @xmath58 of about @xmath592   is needed to account for the strength of the effect ( assuming optical thinness ) .",

    "the high resolution data published by lanzetta & bowen ( 1992 ) suggest a high metallicity for the intervening gas since strong   lines are detected .",

    ", one of us observed this object with the iue in order to detect the damped  line and determine the  column density ; surprisingly , near the expected wavelength of this feature , a cut - off was seen ( this iue spectrum is shown in the catalog of lanzetta et al .",

    "( 1994a ) suggested the presence of weak associated  lines near 5120   .",
    "measurements performed on the spectrum that c. steidel kindly communicated to us confirm that shallow absorption is indeed present ( the 2796    line is seen at @xmath63    and with @xmath64   ) . on the basis of our higher resolution and better s / n ratio uv data , we find that the partial cut - off near 1670    is in fact due to this @xmath62 system .",
    "fortunately , the damped  line at @xmath5 can nevertheless be seen , superimposed onto the attenuated continuum ( fig .  [ spec1229 ] ) .",
    "we do not detect any additional narrow metal system in the new fos spectrum ( fig .",

    "in particular , two sharp edges are seen near 1925 and 2310    which , when attributed to the  and  doublets , correspond to about the same redshift , @xmath66 , that is an infall velocity of 2700  relative to the qso .",
    "from the dlas , we detect several new ( mostly low - ionization ) species in addition to those - , , , ,  and  - already seen by meyer & york ( 1992 ) and cohen et al .",
    "given the strength of the  line , the  doublet is remarkably weak ; the second ( 1551   ) doublet line can barely be seen .",
    "1335 lies just at the red end of the  emission line and its equivalent width strongly depends on the adopted shape for the adjacent continuum ( @xmath67in the normalized spectrum presented in fig .",

    "it turns out that in the fos spectra presented in this paper , the resolution and s / n achieved are such that these lines are occasionally seen individually but at a marginal significance level .",

    "all the quoted upper limits are @xmath37 values .",
    "the estimate of @xmath1 in this dlas is complicated by the presence of the qso /  emission line , just redward of the damped  line at @xmath77 .",
    "thus , before fitting the latter , the continuum has been defined in a way that leaves a reasonably symmetrical  absorption line profile .",
    "we get @xmath78 , where the quoted @xmath79 error is dominated by the uncertainty in the definition of the continuum level and by the possible presence of blended  forest lines ( see fig .  [ q0302dlas ] ) .",
    "our result is compatible with an independent estimate based on the same spectrum performed by pettini & bowen ( 1997 ) ; these authors have measured the  and  column densities and derived [ zn / h ] @xmath4 and [ cr / h ] @xmath80 .    in their high resolution spectra , petitjean & bergeron ( 1990 )",

    "we adopt the latter value in the following although it is larger than that given by petitjean & bergeron ( 1990 ) : their results are based on the saturated 2586 and 2600    lines and are therefore subject to large uncertainties ( e.g. related to the unknown exact zero intensity level ) .",

    ", the situation is more favorable since a significant fraction of the flux at about 1 ghz ( the frequency of the redshifted 21  cm line is 1018 mhz ) originates from a compact component coincident with the optical quasar ( see radio maps published by kronberg et al .",

    "the absence of such systems which would be quite easily recognized in the numerous low resolution optical spectra obtained so far , further supports the reality of a cut - off caused by extinction .",

    ", significant effects are indeed expected to occur since in the rest frame of the absorber , it is the uv part of the extinction curve that is involved .",
    "it is often argued that , given the low dust - to - gas ratio inferred from the observed systems ( pei et al .",
    "1991 ) , the effects of extinction are necessarily small .",
    "indeed , if extinction effects were estimated assuming the _ average _ dust - to - gas ratio inferred from the reddening of qsos with dlas , one would predict negligible effects in fig .",
    "[ zn_h - nhi ] .",
    "however , this reasoning does not take into account the properties of the systems that are missed and which are very likely to be those with the largest dust - to - gas ratio .",
    "fall & pei ( 1993 ) precisely pointed out that the ( unknown ) dispersion in the dust - to - gas ratio is an important limitation in our ability to correct for the effects of this bias .",
    "metal abundances in dlas ( as in nearby galaxies ) show a large scatter at any redshift , and similarly large variations can be expected for the dust - to - gas ratio itself , including the possibility that galaxies with dust - to - gas ratio and metallicities even larger than galactic exist , since we have no reason to believe that the milky way is particularly dust and metal rich .",
    "[ zn_h - nhi ] confirms that in the available samples , a selection with respect to absorbing gas properties is present .",
    "a direct consequence of the bias induced by dust extinction is that estimates of @xmath12 , the total amount of gas ( see e.g. wolfe et al . 1995 ; storrie - lombardi et al .",
    "1996 ) , are necessarily highly uncertain .",
    "first , the relative contribution to @xmath12 of large @xmath1 systems is important and these are precisely the most heavily biased .",
    "second , h@xmath8 , which is not taken into account , may represent a non - negligible fraction of the total gas mass . in the local universe , this fraction is estimated to be in the range 30 - 50 % ( casoli et al . 1997 ) .",
    "the evolution in redshift of this quantity is unknown but we already observe that by @xmath277 1 - 2 , galaxies form stars at a high rate which strongly suggests the presence of a large h@xmath8 mass .",
    "this is also indicated by co observations of distant galaxies ( solomon et al .",
    "1992 ; omont et al . 1996 ; alloin et al .",
    "1997 ) which probably give a lower limit to the true amount of h@xmath8 because the co to h@xmath8 conversion factor is likely to be higher due to a lower metallicity .",
    "note however that , to first order , the uncertainty on the h@xmath8 amount does not affect the method developed by fall & pei ( 1993 ) since their estimate of extinctions is based primarily on the column density of metals , which is an observed quantity .    as noted above",
    ", the extinction bias is expected to have large effects at @xmath278 .",
    "this is also true at @xmath279 because the uv spectroscopic observations required to study these systems are very demanding in terms of qso brightness .",
    "this tends to reduce the evolution of [ zn / h ] ( which further helps to understand the discrepancy discussed by pettini et al .",
    "1997a between the observed low @xmath13 bin and model predictions ) and might also mimic an evolution of the shape of the @xmath1 distribution , such as that observed by wolfe et al .",
    "( 1995 ) .",
    "since molecules and dust are closely related , the extinction bias is likely to affect the apparent h@xmath8 content as well .",
    "one point that has been overlooked when discussing absorption line studies is that such methods yield very little information on the densest phases of the interstellar medium where stars form .",
    "this is for two reasons .",
    "first , the surface coverage factor of the latter is quite small and therefore the probability to intersect intervening material of this type is very low .",
    "second , any background qso will be strongly dimmed by the associated extinction and will remain undetected or appear too faint for spectroscopic studies ; this effect is reinforced by the marked tendency of molecules to assemble in dense opaque clouds , due to self - shielding .",
    "for galaxies at @xmath280 1 , we have ample evidence for the presence of dense and dusty molecular clouds like those in our own galaxy ( wiklind & combes 1996 ; casoli et al .",
    "nevertheless , when searching for dust and molecules from low @xmath13 systems in qso spectra , we get essentially the same null result as at higher redshift !    therefore , one must not draw any definite conclusion from the observed low amount of molecules and lack of clear signatures from dust grains in dlas .",
    "only the observation of fainter qsos would lead to a more representative view of the interstellar medium in these distant galaxies ( boiss 1994 , 1995 ) .",
    "even if h@xmath8 molecules have not been detected in our qso sample , the likely detection of  in two systems suggests that physical conditions ( radiation field , density , ... ) are not very different from those in the solar neighborhood , at least in some absorbers .",

    "furthermore , its color is consistent with a spiral galaxy at @xmath283 , + - pks  1229@xmath3021 : although we could reject objects # 2 , # 4 and # 6 as potential absorbers since they are associated with knots in the qso radio jet , two objects ( a compact galaxy , # 3 , and a low surface brightness galaxy , # 5 ) could be at 0.3950 .",
    "galaxy # 3 is favored because of its lower impact parameter , + - 3c  286 : three fairly bright objects ( # 2a , # 2b and # 2c ) have been detected at less than 1 arcsec from the qso line of sight .",
    "al three could contribute to the dlas .",
    "alternatively , since # 2a and # 2b are located roughly symmetrically to the qso , they could be part of the qso s host galaxy , # 2c being then the absorber",
    ".    some of these identifications could be erroneous if , as in the case of 3c336 ( steidel et al .",
    "1997 ) , none of the galaxies close to the qso line of sight turned out to be at the dlas redshift",
    ". however , from a statistical point of view , the presence of galaxies at low impact parameter in all the studied cases can not be due to chance and very likely , most of the proposed identifications are correct .    among the gas properties that may be connected to absorber morphology",
    "let us consider metallicity and kinematics .",
    "we already noted that the two cases with intervening spiral galaxies correspond to relatively high metallicities .",
    "the low [ zn / h ] value measured in 3c 286 in spite of the small impact parameter is consistent with the proposed absorber of fairly low surface brightness .",
    "this case may then be similar to the dlas studied by steidel et al .",
    "( 1997 ) : no galaxy could be detected despite an intensive search which suggests a faint object centered on the qso .",
    "the two compact absorbers display intermediate metallicities ; these galaxies are reminiscent of the blue nucleated galaxies that appear at @xmath277 0.5 in galaxy surveys ( schade et al .",
    "the most intriguing case is the dlas in pks  1229@xmath3021 : although the amorphous aspect suggests an unevolved object , the zn and mn abundances are clearly higher than in the two previous cases , with a possibly unusual abundance pattern .",
    "the absorber in pks  1229@xmath3021 is also remarkable for the kinematics of the absorbing gas .",
    "the asymmetrical velocity distribution revealed by the data obtained by lanzetta & bowen ( 1992 ) is the prototype of what prochaska & wolfe ( 1997 ) consider to be the signature of a massive disk .",
    "however , at first sight , such an interpretation of absorption profiles is not supported by the appearance of the damped absorber in hst images as discussed by pettini et al .",
    "( 1997a ) .",
    "recent numerical simulations also confirm ( at least for the high @xmath13 dlas ) that the presence of an edge - leading asymmetry is not an unambiguous signature of a rapidly rotating disk ( haehnelt et al .",
    "we also note that in the other case of a proposed low surface brightness galaxy ( in 3c 286 ) , the kinematics seems to be very different since all or most of the absorption arises from the single narrow component which induces the 21 cm absorption line ( meyer & york , 1992 ) .",
    "detailed information on the kinematics is also available for the damped  system in pks  0454 + 039 ( lu et al .",
    "absorption is spread more or less continuously over 140  with four maxima and no characteristic asymmetry .",
    "no simple picture emerges from the yet very scarce systems for which the required data are available .",
    "a larger sample is necessary to check if the absorption profiles are related to the large - scale kinematics of the intervening galaxy itself ( as proposed by prochaska & wolfe 1997 ) or rather are governed by e.g. the recent star formation activity ( through supernovae explosions ) . in the present context , the two systems induced by bright spiral galaxies ( in 3c 196 and q  1209 + 107 ) are of much interest and would clearly deserve high resolution spectroscopic observations .      the results obtained in our study and the above discussion clearly show the need for complementary observations .",
    "obviously , it is very desirable to confirm spectroscopically the candidate absorbers proposed in paper i , especially when several galaxies are present at low impact parameter .",
    "then , it is important to improve the accuracy of some measurements presented in this paper and extend the set of metal elements considered in order to compare in more details the abundance patterns seen at low and high z. in particular , it is important to confirm the high metallicity suggested for the systems caused by intervening spiral galaxies in the spectra of 3c 196 and q  1209 + 107 .",
    "for the two latter cases , the absorber properties are very well characterized by hst images ; high resolution optical spectra would provide the velocity distribution of the gas and thus help to establish the phenomena governing the kinematics of the absorbing material .",
    "moreover , the observed broad range of absorber morphologies and absorbing gas properties indicate that a larger sample is needed to get a correct overall view of the origin of low @xmath13 damped  systems .",
    "possibly , some types of absorbers have not yet been detected ; the recent study by lanzetta et al . ( 1997 ) shows that early - type galaxies do also contribute to the damped absorber population .",
    "presently , only two or three absorbers of each type have been found and it is not possible to assess the relative contribution of the various classes of galaxies .",
    "observations of several absorbers from the same class , but probed at different impact parameters and inclinations , would be crucial to understand the relation between the absorbing gas and the parent galaxy properties .    finally , as discussed in sect .",
    "6.2 , we strongly suspect that surveys of damped  samples drawn from the observation of fainter qsos would reveal more systems with large   and high metallicity , whatever the redshift",
    ". however , the most reddened qsos would not be observable in their uv rest - frame and the intervening gas properties should then be derived from observations at longer wavelengths .",
    "nevertheless , searches for damped  absorption in qsos fainter by two or three magnitudes could reveal absorption systems in which the presence of dust grains and molecules is much more conspicuous than in the systems investigated so far , and thus would allow a more comprehensive study of the evolution of the interstellar medium in galaxies .",
    "spectroscopic surveys of fainter qsos should then not only enlarge the present samples but also lead to a more representative view of the whole diversity of the damped  absorber population .",
