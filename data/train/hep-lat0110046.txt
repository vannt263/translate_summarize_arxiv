    "the spectrum of the qcd dirac operator @xmath1 is related to universality classes of random matrix theory ( rmt ) , i.e. determined by the global symmetries of the qcd partition function , for a review see  @xcite . in rmt",
    "the matrix @xmath2 in eq .",
    "( [ dirac_op ] ) is replaced by a random matrix with appropriate symmetries , generating the chiral orthogonal ( choe ) , unitary ( chue ) , and symplectic ( chse ) ensemble , respectively . for su(2 ) and su(3 ) gauge groups numerous results exist confirming the expected relations .",
    "we have investigated @xmath0 u(1 ) gauge theory described by the action @xmath3 with @xmath4 and @xmath5 at @xmath6 u(1 ) gauge theory undergoes a phase transition between a confinement phase with mass gap and monopole excitations for @xmath7 and the coulomb phase for @xmath8 . in the whole coulomb phase the photon is massless and thus there ought to exist a continuum theory , as @xmath9 , everywhere .",
    "we were interested in the relationship between u(1 ) gauge theory and rmt across this phase transition .",
    "the bohigas - giannoni - schmit conjecture  @xcite states that quantum systems whose classical counterparts are chaotic have spectral fluctuation properties , measured , e.g. by the nearest - neighbor spacing distribution @xmath10 of unfolded eigenvalues , given by rmt , whereas systems whose classical counterparts are integrable obey a poisson distribution , @xmath11 . with staggered fermions it was shown in ref .",
    "@xcite that the bohigas - giannoni - schmit conjecture holds for lattice qed both in the confined phase ( as for the su(2 ) and su(3 ) gauge groups ) and also in the coulomb phase , whereas free fermions yield the poisson distribution . in ref .",
    "@xcite this investigation was continued with a study of the distribution of small eigenvalues in the confined phase .",
    "excellent agreement was found for the conjecture that the microscopic spectral density @xmath12 is given by the result for the chue of rmt , which also generates the leutwyler - smilga sum rules  @xcite .",
    "here @xmath13 is the modulus of the chiral condensate , which follows from the smallest non - zero eigenvalue via the banks - casher formula .",
    "@xmath14@xmath14    @xmath15@xmath15    the quasi zero - modes which are responsible for the chiral condensate build up when we cross from the coulomb into the confined phase . for an @xmath16 lattice  @xcite ,",
    "[ f12 ] compares on identical scales densities of the small eigenvalues at @xmath17 ( left plot ) and at @xmath18 ( right plot ) , averaged over 20 configurations .",
    "the quasi zero - modes in the left plot are responsible for the non - zero chiral condensate @xmath19 via the banks - casher formula , whereas no such quasi zero - modes are found in the coulomb phase . for @xmath0 su(2 ) and su(3 ) gauge theories a general interpretation is to link zero - modes to the existence of instantons .",
    "as there are no conventional instantons in @xmath0 u(1 ) gauge theory ( an analogous case exists in @xmath20 qcd @xcite ) , we  @xcite decided to study the physical origin of the u(1 ) quasi zero modes in more detail .",
    "via the atiyah - singer index theorem the topological charge is mapped on the number of fermionic zero - modes of the dirac operator .",
    "it is thus desirable to use a dirac operator which retains chiral symmetry and exhibits exact zero - modes .",
    "therefore , we employed in ref .  @xcite the neuberger overlap - dirac operator  @xcite @xmath21\\ .\\ ] ] here @xmath22 is the usual wilson - dirac operator on the lattice and @xmath23 the sign function",
    ". the mass @xmath24 has to be chosen to be positive and well above the critical mass for wilson fermions but below the mass where the doublers become light on the lattice .",
    "our first question was whether the qed overlap - dirac operator will exhibit exact zero - modes at all . to answer it",
    ", we have analyzed configurations on @xmath25 lattices at @xmath26 in the confined phase and at @xmath27 in the coulomb phase . with an overrelaxation / heatbath algorithm we generated 500 configurations per lattice of linear size @xmath28 , @xmath29 and @xmath30 .",
    "after thermalization , the configurations were separated by 100 sweeps , with each sweep consisting of three overrelaxation updates of each link , followed by one heatbath update . on each configuration the lowest 12 eigenvalues of the overlap - dirac operator  ( [ neuberger_dirac ] ) were calculated using the ritz functional algorithm with the optimal rational approximation of ref .",
    "@xcite to @xmath31 and @xmath24 set to 2.3 .    in the confined phase exact zero - modes of the operator  ( [ neuberger_dirac ] ) were indeed found .",
    "the highest degeneracy observed was @xmath32 .",
    "no zero - modes were found in the coulomb phase .",
    "for each degeneracy @xmath33 , chiral rmt predicts the distribution of the lowest non - zero eigenvalue @xmath34 in terms of the rescaled variable @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the volume of the system and @xmath13 the infinite volume value of the chiral condensate @xmath37 determined up to an overall wave function renormalization . for the u(1 )",
    "gauge group the unitary ensemble applies and the rmt predictions for the @xmath38 probability densities @xmath39 are  @xcite @xmath40\\,e^{-{z^2\\over4}}(\\nu=2).}\\ ] ] the chiral condensate is related to the expectation value of the smallest eigenvalue . for degeneracy",
    "@xmath33 we have @xmath41 where the result is supposed to be independent of @xmath33 and @xmath42 using analytical and numerical integration the expectation values @xmath43 are easily calculated .",
    "the values @xmath44 follow then from eq .",
    "( [ sigma ] ) and , for the various lattice sizes and @xmath33 s , the results which we obtain from our data are consistent with one another",
    ".    figure  [ fig_pd ] displays the exact rmt probability densities @xmath45 of eq .",
    "( [ rho_nu ] ) and the corresponding histograms from our data .",
    "it shows that the histograms follow the shift of the rmt probability densities and their general shape .",
    "the high peak of the @xmath46 histogram is interpreted as a statistical fluctuation due to the low statistics we have for this case .",
    "the topological structure of the u(1 ) gauge theory is not as extensively studied as the non - abelian case .",
    "nevertheless , with torons  @xcite , monopole solutions  @xcite and dirac sheets  @xcite a number of topological objects are known for the u(1 ) gauge theory .",
    "all these topological configurations have in common with the zero - mode degeneracy that they are turned on at the phase transition from order ( coulomb ) to disorder ( confinement ) . however , in the confined phase we found no detailed correlation between any of the topological phenomena and the zero - mode degeneracy of the overlap - dirac operator .",
    "related to this may be that we found the zero - mode susceptibility to decrease , possibly approaching zero for @xmath47  @xcite .",
    "in contrast to these findings there is an interesting observation that ordered dirac sheet configurations give rise to zero - modes of the overlap - dirac operator , with the number of zero - modes being equal to the number of dirac sheets  @xcite .",
    "one might understand this from the fact that a dirac sheet is a @xmath48 gauge configuration that contains unit topological charge in the @xmath48 sense , kept constant in the two orthogonal directions .    to investigate possible correlations between the existence of zero - modes and topological objects further we have , following refs .",
    "@xcite , factorized our gauge configurations into monopole and photon fields .",
    "the u(1 ) plaquette angles @xmath49 are decomposed into the `` physical '' electromagnetic flux through the plaquette @xmath50 and a number @xmath51 of dirac strings passing through the plaquette @xmath52 where @xmath53 $ ] and @xmath54 is called a dirac plaquette .",
    "monopole and photon fields are then defined in the following way @xmath55 @xmath56 here @xmath57 acts on @xmath58 , the quantities @xmath51 and @xmath59 are defined in eq .",
    "( [ dirac_string_def ] ) and @xmath60 is the lattice coulomb propagator . one can show that @xmath61 is up to a gauge transformation identical with the original @xmath62 defined by @xmath63 .",
    "we found that both zero - modes and near zero - modes lie solely in the monopole part of the gauge field and are completely absent in the photonic field .",
    "using periodic boundary conditions in space and anti - periodic boundary conditions in time  @xcite , this was seen both for the overlap - dirac operator and for the quasi zero - modes of the staggered dirac operator . as an example",
    "we show in fig .",
    "[ staggered ] the entire spectral density of the staggered dirac operator in the original ( full ) gauge fields and in their monopole and photon part , respectively .",
    "at the moment we are accumulating statistics to perform a decomposition into different topological sectors and to obtain an analogous analysis concerning topological objects as we did with the original u(1 ) field above  @xcite .",
    "it is of further interest to study space - time correlations between different topological objects .",
    "we pose the question of the existence of local correlations between the topological charge density and the monopole density .",
    "it is also desirable to calculate spatial correlations between the topological objects and the density @xmath64 of the exact zero - modes of the overlap - dirac operator .",
    "in non - abelian theories it turned out that some cooling or smoothing procedure is unavoidable to gain integer - valued topological charges . for our abelian case",
    "we studied the value @xmath65 obtained by integration of the topological density @xmath66 using the hypercube definition and plaquette definition on the lattice  @xcite . in @xmath0",
    "u(1 ) theory with periodic boundary conditions one can construct an artificial configuration with integer topological charge @xmath65  @xcite @xmath67 where @xmath68 is the linear lattice extent , @xmath69 , @xmath70 , and @xmath71 .",
    "these gauge fields consist of @xmath72 dirac sheets in the 1 - 2 planes and @xmath73 dirac sheets in the 3 - 4 planes .",
    "such configurations possess nearly integer - valued @xmath65 s on a finite lattice , as seen from fig .",
    "[ artificial ] , and the overlap - dirac operator has @xmath65 exact zero - modes .",
    "we have first heated and then cooled those smooth configurations in order to inspect whether they return to their original value of @xmath65 . in fig .",
    "[ heatcool ] we demonstrate the effect for the @xmath74 configuration which was updated several times with the monte carlo code at @xmath75 before 400 cooling steps were applied .",
    "we employed a systematic cooling procedure by @xmath76 , with @xmath77 and @xmath78 .",
    "it turned out that the artificial configuration has a memory of @xmath74 for up to 10 monte carlo hits . when cooling equilibrium configurations from the @xmath75 ensemble it never happened that they obtained an integer - valued topological charge , as depicted in fig .",
