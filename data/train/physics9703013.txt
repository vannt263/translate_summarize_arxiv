    "the four - electron li@xmath0 ion is interesting because of the significant role played by electron correlation in the binding of the outermost electron in this weakly bound system .",
    "the major contribution to the correlation energy arises from the interaction of the two valence electrons . beyond the three - body h@xmath0 system ,",
    "the li@xmath0 ion is most tractable to theory . in the frozen core approximation , for example",
    ", the li@xmath0 ion becomes an effective three - body system consisting of a pair of highly correlated electrons interacting weakly with an inert core .",
    "such a model lends itself well to semi - empirical model potential calculations in which the potential experienced by the valence electrons is obtained via spectral information on the eigenvalue spectrum of the li atom .",
    "most calculations of the electron affinity of li to date are of this type , e.g.  moccia et al .  @xcite or graham et al .",
    "@xcite ( and references therein ) .",
    "recently , however , accurate measurements of this quantity have stimulated ab initio calculations @xcite of comparable accuracy .",
    "the most direct , and potentially the most accurate , method of measuring electron affinities is to use the laser threshold photodetachment ( ltp ) method @xcite . here",
    "one records , as a function of the wavelength of a tunable laser , the onset of production of either photoelectrons or residual atoms in the vicinity of a detachment threshold .",
    "to date , three ltp measurements of the electron affinity of li have been reported .",
    "the earliest such experiment was a crossed laser and ion beam experiment by feldman @xcite .",
    "he utilized an infrared laser to study the li@xmath4 photodetachment threshold .",
    "an accurate threshold energy for a @xmath5-wave detachment was difficult to determine because the cross section rises , according to the wigner law @xcite , only slowly from zero .",
    "bae and peterson @xcite used collinear laser and ion beams to investigate the total photodetachment cross section around the li(@xmath6 ) cusp situated at the opening of the li@xmath7 channel . from a careful analysis of this sharp structure they obtained , as one result , an electron affinity value of about the same accuracy as feldman .",
    "the measurement of dellwo et al .",
    "@xcite was a direct investigation of the resolved li@xmath7 channel threshold using photoelectron spectroscopy . in this experiment , however , doppler broadening associated with the use of crossed laser and ion beams limited the attainable energy resolution .",
    "the electron affinity of li determined in the present measurement is an order of magnitude more accurate than previous lpt measurements .",
    "we utilized resonance ionization @xcite combined with a collinear laser - ion beam geometry to measure the threshold of the li@xmath7 partial photodetachment cross section .",
    "the state selectivity of the resonance ionization method leads to an excellent signal - to - background ratio .",
    "this in turn enabled us to attain a resolution limited only by the laser bandwidth of about 0.2  @xmath8 .",
    "the present threshold energy measurement clearly demonstrates the potential of the method .",
    "the concept of combining collinear laser - ion beam spectroscopy with resonance ionization detection was first proposed by kudriatsev and letokhov @xcite and later applied to isotope detection measurements by the same authors @xcite .",
    "balling et al .",
    "@xcite and petrunin et al .",
    "@xcite have recently used the same technique in photodetachment measurements .",
    "the two - color state selective photodetachment experiment described in the present paper is simple in concept .",
    "one laser of frequency @xmath9 is used to photodetach li@xmath0 ions producing an excited li atom and a free electron ( fig .  1 ) .",
    "a second laser of frequency @xmath10 resonantely photoexcites li atoms left in the @xmath6 state to a rydberg state which subsequently is field ionized .",
    "hence , the entire process can be represented by the following steps :    @xmath11    where @xmath12 denoted field ionization and li(@xmath13 ) corresponds to a highly excited rydberg atom in either a @xmath14 or @xmath15 state .",
    "state selectivity is accomplished in the resonant ionization step since only li(@xmath6 ) atoms can be ionized via the intermediate rydberg state . in this manner",
    "we were able to isolate a particular photodetachment channel , in this case the li(@xmath6 ) channel , and investigate the partial photodetachment cross section by measuring the yield of li@xmath2 ions .",
    "the @xmath16li@xmath0 ion beam was produced by charge exchange in a cesium vapor cell of a mass selected li@xmath2 beam from a plasma ion source .",
    "an ion current of typically a few na was obtained in the interaction region .",
    "the beam energy was approximately 4  kev .    in the interaction chamber ( fig .",
    "2 ) the negative ions interacted with laser light in a region defined by two apertures with a diameter of 3  mm placed 0.5  m apart . the ions were deflected in and out of the laser beam by means of two electrostatic quadrupole deflectors whose symmetry axes were perpendicular to the laser and ion beams .",
    "the ion current in the interaction region was monitored with a faraday cup placed after the second quadrupole deflector .",
    "rydberg atoms formed in the interaction region travel to the second quadrupole where they are ionized by the same electric field that deflects the negative ion beam into the faraday cup .",
    "positive ions formed in this process were deflected in the opposite direction into a positive ion detector . in this detector",
    "the fast positive ions impinged on a conducting glass plate producing secondary electrons that were detected with a channel electron multiplier ( cem ) . a metal grid connected to a voltage supply",
    "was placed between the glass plate and the cem .",
    "this made it possible to either allow or prevent the secondary electrons from reaching the cem .",
    "the detection efficiency of the positive ion detector was close to unity .",
    "light of frequency @xmath9 was generated by a dye laser operated with coumarine 307 and light of frequency @xmath10 was produced by a dye laser operated with bmq .",
    "both dye lasers were pumped by a common xecl excimer laser .",
    "the pulse duration of both lasers was about 15  ns .",
    "the maximum energy in a laser pulse delivered into the interaction region was 1.5  mj for the radiation of frequency @xmath9 and 200  @xmath17j for the radiation of frequency @xmath10 . during the experiment both lasers were attenuated , as will be discussed below .",
    "the two laser pulses counter propagated in the interaction region and arrived simultaneously in the interaction region .",
    "a shift of a few ns between the pulses , occurring at both ends of the interaction region , is negligible since the li(@xmath1 ) radiative lifetime is 26.99(16 )  ns @xcite .",
    "the frequency @xmath9 was determined by combining fabry - prot fringes with optogalvanic spectroscopy .",
    "the fabry - prot fringes served as frequency markers whereas transitions of ne or ar in a hollow cathode lamp provided an absolute calibration of the energy scale .",
    "first we had to find an appropriate resonance transition for the laser of frequency @xmath10 . a scan of @xmath10 , during which @xmath9 is set to a frequency far above the li@xmath18 threshold , is shown in fig .  [ uv2 ] .",
    "below the ionization limit we found a wealth of lines . due to strong saturation ,",
    "the intensities of the lines are not    proportional to the corresponding transition probabilities ; close to the ionization limit the detection system became overloaded such that it only recorded one count per laser shot thus attenuating the strongest lines . for most of the lines we also expect the transition itself to be saturated .",
    "the rydberg series in fig .",
    "[ uv2 ] exhibits a cut off at 28270  @xmath8 indicating that the rydberg atoms were mainly field ionized in an electric field of about 200  kv / m in the second quadrupole deflector .",
    "we interpret the lines below the cut off as being due to photoionization .",
    "a detailed scan of the transition used for the photodetachment threshold measurements is shown in fig .",
    "we identified the two lines as corresponding to transitions from the two fine structure levels @xmath19 to the same rydberg state .",
    "the measured separation of 0.33(4 )  @xmath8 between the two lines in fig .",
    "[ fein ] corresponds very well to the fine structure splitting of 0.337  @xmath8 of the @xmath1 term @xcite .",
    "the resolved fine structure shown in fig .  [ fein ] demonstrates that the energy resolution of the present collinear beam apparatus is approximately 0.2  @xmath8 , which is of the same order as the laser bandwidth .      a typical measurement of the li(2@xmath5 ) photodetachment threshold with anti - parallel laser and ion beams",
    "is shown in fig .",
    "the laser frequency @xmath10 was held constant and the intensity was set to saturate the transition to the rydberg state .",
    "the frequency @xmath9 was then scanned over the li(@xmath6 ) threshold .",
    "it was established that two processes contributed to the background , namely ( a ) : @xmath20 and ( b ) two - electron collisional ionization .",
    "process ( a ) produced nearly 80% of the background , even though the intensity of the laser light with frequency @xmath10 was attenuated .",
    "process ( b ) , two - electron collisional ionization , contributed the remaining background at the operating pressure of @xmath21  mbar ( @xmath22  pa ) .",
    "this contribution was found to be proportional to the pressure and is thus dominated by single collision double detachment , as has been discussed previously by bae and peterson @xcite .",
    "the laser intensities were too low for other processes , such as direct two - electron multiphoton detachment , to influence the experiment .",
    "close to the photodetachment threshold the cross section @xmath23 is well represented by the wigner law @xcite ( eq .  [ eqwig ] ) .",
    "if @xmath24 is the threshold energy and @xmath25 the photon energy , the wigner law for electrons detached with different angular momenta @xmath26 can be written as @xmath27 for the desired first step process in eq .",
    "[ stepone ] , both @xmath28- and @xmath29-wave final states for the detached electron are allowed by parity and total angular momentum conservation . at the threshold",
    ", however , the @xmath28-wave cross section , starting with an infinite slope , completely dominates over the @xmath29-wave cross section .",
    "we fitted the wigner law ( eq .",
    "[ eqwig ] ) for @xmath28-wave detachment ( @xmath30 ) to the recorded positive ion signal .",
    "the data shown in fig .  [ wig ] was recorded with the laser ( @xmath9 ) anti - parallel to the ion beam .",
    "the fit window is the range of the plotted line .",
    "the fit yields a value for the red - shifted threshold energy , @xmath31 . in order to eliminate the doppler shift we repeated the measurements using parallel laser and ion beams to determine the blue - shifted threshold energy , @xmath32 the threshold energy corrected for the doppler to all orders , @xmath24 , is given by the geometric mean of the two measurements : @xmath33    the interaction of the induced dipole moment of the atom with the electron will limit the range of validity of the wigner law . omalley",
    "@xcite obtained an expression which accounts for the residual induced - dipole point - charge interaction , @xmath34\\quad , \\ ] ] where @xmath35 and @xmath36 is in atomic units .",
    "this equation can be used to estimate an approximate range of validity for the wigner law by determining the conditions under which the second term , and therefore higher terms , become negligible . with a dipole polarizibility of @xmath37 for the li @xmath1 state @xcite ,",
    "the second term is much less than unity up to 1  @xmath8 above the threshold , and consequently the wigner law should be applicable over this range .",
    "this , of course , assumes that there are no resonances in this region , a condition which has been previously established by dellwo et al.@xcite .",
    "saturation of the signal can originate in the photodetachment process or the detection system . in the data shown in fig .",
    "[ wig ] the detection system starts to saturate at about 250 counts ( for 100 laser pulses ) .",
    "we attenuated the intensity of the laser of frequency @xmath9 sufficiently to avoid any saturation of the signal within the first 1.0  @xmath8 above the threshold .    to determine the electron affinity of li we had to subtract the well known @xmath38 transition energy of 14903.648130(14 )  @xmath8 @xcite from the measured doppler-    .comparison of different measurements and calculations of the li electron affinity .",
    "[ cols=\"<,^ \" , ]     corrected threshold energy @xmath24 ( eq .  [ schwelle ] ) .",
    "we determined the li electron affinity to be 4984.90(17 )  @xmath8 . to the error",
    "there are two major contributions : 0.13  @xmath8 is due to a calibration uncertainty of the hollow cathode lamps , and the rest is due to statistical scattering of the fitted threshold values .    in order to convert our electron affinity in @xmath8",
    "to ev we used the recommended factor of ( 1/8065.5410 ) @xmath39 $ ] @xcite and obtained 0.618049(20 )  ev . in fig .",
    "[ ealithium ] this value is compared with previous experiments .",
    "these values are also compiled in tab .",
    "[ tab1 ] together with some recently calculated li electron affinities .",
    "we have demonstrated that photodetachment spectroscopy combined with resonance ionization is a powerful method for studying partial photodetachment cross sections of negative ions .",
    "the collinear beam geometry simultaneously provides high sensitivity , due to the large interaction volume , and excellent resolution , due to velocity compression .",
    "i addition , removal of the doppler shift to all orders can be achieved by use of two separate measurements involving parallel and anti - parallel laser and ion beams .",
    "both merits can be fully retained for channel specific photodetachment investigations with the excitation scheme used in this experiment .",
    "our improved li electron affinity of 0.618049(20 )  ev reveals the potential of this method , and this method can , in principle , be extended to essentially all elements .",
    "we are currently developing this type of state - selective detection scheme in connection with on - going studies of high lying doubly excited states of the li@xmath0 ion @xcite .",
