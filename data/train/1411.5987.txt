    "precise measurements of the beta decay between nuclear analog states of spin , @xmath9 , and isospin , @xmath10 , provide demanding and fundamental tests of the properties of the electroweak interaction .",
    "collectively , these transitions sensitively probe the conservation of the vector weak current , set tight limits on the presence of scalar currents and provide the most precise value for @xmath11 , the up - down quark - mixing element of the cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa ( ckm ) matrix .",
    "this latter result has become a linchpin in the most demanding available test of the unitarity of the ckm matrix , a property which is fundamental to the electroweak standard model .",
    "we have published six previous surveys of @xmath0@xmath1 superallowed transitions @xcite , the first having appeared over 40 years ago and the most recent , six years ago . in each",
    ", we published a complete survey of all relevant nuclear data that pertained to these superallowed transitions and used the results to set limits on the weak - interaction parameters that were important at the time .",
    "notably , since @xmath11 became the quantity of greatest interest 25 years ago , its value as obtained from our surveys of superallowed decays has improved by a factor of five in precision but has never strayed outside of the uncertainties quoted in preceding surveys .",
    "this consistency is testimony to the robustness of what is by now a very large body of nuclear data .",
    "since our last survey closed in september 2008 , there has continued to be a great deal of activity in this field , both in experiment and in theory . and this activity in honing @xmath11 has been matched by efforts to make similar improvements in the value of @xmath7 , the second important element in the top - row unitarity sum .",
    "( the third element , @xmath12 , is too small to play a significant role . )",
    "since the value of @xmath7 has undergone some unexpected changes in the past decade and has not yet settled at a reliably stable result , interest in the ckm unitarity test continues to stimulate work in the field .",
    "since 2008 , new measurements relating to @xmath0@xmath1 superallowed transitions have appeared in 24 publications , and the new more - precise results they contain have made 9 of the references accumulated in 2008 entirely obsolete and left 11 more with some results replaced , in all cases because new values had uncertainties a factor of ten or more smaller .",
    "altogether this means that , of the references in this 2014 survey , about 15% are new and , being among the most precise , their influence is disproportionately greater than that .",
    "in addition to new measurements , there have also been important theoretical contributions to the small isospin - symmetry - breaking corrections that must be applied to the data in order to extract @xmath11 and the values of other weak - interaction parameters . in the past six years",
    ", a number of different groups have published their results for these terms , with calculations based upon a variety of different models .",
    "the diversity of results has prompted development of a test that allows each set of correction terms to be judged by its ability to produce @xmath4 values that are consistent with conservation of the vector current ( cvc ) .",
    "as part of our survey , we apply this test to all sets that cover at least half the number of well - measured superallowed transitions . as a result",
    ", we have identified the only set that yields self - consistent @xmath4 values and it is this set that we use in our ultimate analysis of the experimental data .",
    "overall , recent improvements have been numerous enough that we consider this to be an opportune time to produce a new and updated survey of the nuclear data used to establish @xmath11 .",
    "we incorporate data on a total of 20 superallowed transitions and have continued the practice we began in 1984 @xcite of updating all original data to take account of the most modern calibration standards .",
    "however many of the measurements that required updating have been superseded by more precise modern measurements so there are fewer updated old results in our new survey than there have been in the past .    superallowed @xmath0@xmath1 @xmath2 decay between",
    "@xmath13 analog states depends uniquely on the vector part of the weak interaction and , according to the conserved vector current ( cvc ) hypothesis , its experimental @xmath3 value should be directly related to the vector coupling constant , a fundamental constant which is the same for all such transitions . in practice ,",
    "the expression for @xmath3 includes several small ( @xmath141% ) correction terms .",
    "it is convenient to combine some of these terms with the @xmath3 value and define a  corrected \" @xmath4 value .",
    "thus , we write @xcite t ft(1+_r^ ) ( 1 + _ ns - _ c ) = [ ftdef ] where @xmath15 gev@xmath16s , @xmath17 is the vector coupling constant for semi - leptonic weak interactions , @xmath18 is the isospin - symmetry - breaking correction and @xmath19 is the transition - independent part of the radiative correction .",
    "the terms @xmath20 and @xmath21 comprise the transition - dependent part of the radiative correction , the former being a function only of the electron s energy and the @xmath22 of the daughter nucleus , while the latter , like @xmath18 , depends in its evaluation on the details of nuclear structure . from this equation , it can be seen that each measured transition establishes an individual value for @xmath23 and , if the cvc assertion is correct that @xmath23 is not renormalized in the nuclear medium , all such values  and all the @xmath4 values themselves",
    " should be identical within uncertainties , regardless of the specific nuclei involved .",
    "our procedure in this paper is to examine all experimental data related to 20 superallowed transitions , comprising all those that have been well studied , together with other cases that are now coming under scrutiny after becoming accessible to precision measurement in relatively recent years .",
    "the methods used in data evaluation are presented in sec .",
    "[ s : data ] , with the calculations and corrections required to extract @xmath4 values from these data being described and applied in sec .",
    "[ s : ftvalu ] . then in sec .",
    "[ s : dcgeneral ] we take a careful look at the various sets of isospin - symmetry - breaking correction terms and explain our choice of the set we use for the survey results . finally , in sec .",
    "[ s : impact ] we explore the impact of these results on two weak - interaction issues : ckm unitarity and the possible existence of scalar interactions .",
    "this is much the same pattern as we followed in our last two reviews @xcite so we will not describe the formalism again in detail , referring the reader instead to those earlier works .",
    "the @xmath3-value that characterizes any @xmath2 transition depends on three measured quantities : the total transition energy @xmath24 , the half - life @xmath25 of the parent state , and the branching ratio @xmath26 for the particular transition of interest .",
    "the @xmath24-value is required to determine the statistical rate function , @xmath27 , while the half - life and branching ratio combine to yield the partial half - life , @xmath28 . in tables",
    "[ qec]-[reject ] we present the measured values of these three quantities and supporting information for a total of twenty superallowed transitions . in all , there are 222 independent measurements from 177 references .",
    "thus , on average each quantity has been measured with comparable precision three or more times by different groups .",
    "such redundancy virtually eliminates the possibility of individual experimental anomalies having a significant impact on the overall results .      in our treatment of the data , we considered all measurements formally published before september 2014 .",
    "we scrutinized all the original experimental reports in detail . where necessary and possible",
    ", we used the information provided there to correct the results for calibration data that have improved since the measurement was made .",
    "if corrections were evidently required but insufficient information was provided to make them , the results were rejected . of the surviving results , only those with ( updated ) uncertainties that are within a factor of ten of the most precise measurement for each quantity",
    "were retained for averaging in the tables .",
    "each datum appearing in the tables is attributed to its original journal reference _ via _ an alphanumeric code comprising the initial two letters of the first author s name and the two last digits of the publication date .",
    "these codes are correlated with the actual reference numbers , @xcite-@xcite , in table  [ ref ] .",
    "the statistical procedures we have followed in analyzing the tabulated data are based on those used by the particle data group in their periodic reviews of particle properties ( e.g. ref .",
    "@xcite ) and adopted by us in our previous surveys .",
    "we gave a detailed description of those procedures in our 2004 survey @xcite so will not repeat it here .",
    "our evaluation principles and associated statistical procedures constitute a very conservative approach to the data . unless there is a clearly identifiable reason to reject a result ,",
    "we include it in our data base even if it deviates significantly from other measurements of the same quantity , the consequent non - statistical spread in results being reflected in an increased uncertainty assigned to the average .",
    "wherever this occurs , the factor by which the uncertainty has been increased , which is the square - root of the normalized @xmath29 , is listed in the  scale \" column of a table .",
    "occasionally a measurement with an acceptable uncertainty is nevertheless excluded from our data base , in which case the reason for its exclusion is always listed in table [ reject ] .",
    "for example , there are a few publications that include a number of measurements  a set of half - lives or @xmath24 values  most or all of which deviate substantially from other accepted measurements of the same quantities . in those cases , we consider that some systematic problem has been revealed , and exclude all the results from that publication .",

    "in contrast with our previous surveys , we list no uncertainties on the individual @xmath20 values . in the past , we have taken the uncertainty on each transition s @xmath20 value to be equal to the entire @xmath170 contribution .",
    "we have then treated the uncertainty as being statistical , adding it in quadrature to the experimental uncertainty to obtain the total uncertainty on the @xmath4 value for that transition .",
    "the latter was in turn handled statistically in the derivation of an average @xmath68 for all the transitions .",
    "we have now revised this prescription in two ways .",
    "first , we reduce the magnitude of the uncertainty on @xmath20 to one - third of the @xmath170 term , and secondly we treat it as a systematic , rather than a statistical effect .",
    "our previous choice for the magnitude originated 25 years ago with sirlin @xcite , who at the time did not include the @xmath170 term in the radiative correction itself but used it only as an estimate of its uncertainty .",
    "one year later , though , he chose instead to include it in the correction itself @xcite , while apparently neglecting any contribution to the uncertainty .",
    "we now believe that our choice to combine both these approaches by including the @xmath170 term in @xmath20 and also assigning it to be the latter s uncertainty was being overly cautious . furthermore , because the uncertainty is associated with the @xmath170 term , it is expected to be a smooth function of @xmath171 and thus to behave systematically since any shift in the value of @xmath20 must affect all @xmath4 values in the same direction .",
    "we then proceed as follows : we evaluate the individual transition @xmath4 values without including any uncertainties associated with @xmath20 , and obtain an average @xmath68 .",
    "then we shift all the individual @xmath20 terms up and down by one - third of the @xmath170 contribution , recalculate the @xmath4 values and determine @xmath68 for both .",
    "the shifts in the value of the latter ",
    "@xmath172 for the data in table  [ ft ]  becomes the systematic uncertainty assigned to @xmath68 to account for the uncertainty in @xmath20 .",
    "note that our choice to take one - third of the @xmath170 term is rather arbitrary , but has the benefit that it is still conservative and at the same time results in the uncertainty in @xmath20 having an impact on the overall result that is comparable to its impact in our previous survey @xcite .",
    "we turn now to the third radiative term @xmath21 , which arises from an evaluation of the low - energy part of the @xmath165-box graph for an axial - vector weak interaction . if it is assumed that the @xmath173 and @xmath174-vertices are both with the same nucleon , @xmath175 , then the evaluated box graph becomes proportional to the fermi @xmath2-decay operator yielding a universal correction already included in @xmath19 .",
    "if instead the @xmath176- and @xmath177-interactions in the @xmath165-box graph for an axial - vector current are with different nucleons in the nucleus , then the evaluation involves two - nucleon operators , which necessitates a nuclear - structure calculation .",
    "this component of the radiative correction we denote by @xmath21 and list its values in column 3 of table  [ t : theocorr ] .",
    "the values and their uncertainties have been taken from table vi in ref .",
    "@xcite . for this correction term ,",
    "a number of model calculations were carried out for each nucleus @xcite and the uncertainties listed were chosen to encompass the spread in the results from these calculations .",
    "therefore the uncertainty is nucleus - specific and , as such , can be treated as statistical and not systematic .",
    "we thus combine it in quadrature with the experimental errors in determining the @xmath4-value uncertainties .      in this section",
    "we describe only the set of isospin - symmetry - breaking corrections , @xmath18 , that we have used in deriving the corrected @xmath4 values given in table  [ ft ] .",
    "a discussion of other alternative calculations of @xmath18  and our reasons for rejecting them  is postponed to sect .",
    "[ s : dcgeneral ] .",
    "the set we have selected follows from a semi - phenomenological approach based on the shell - model combined with woods - saxon radial - functions .",
    "this model , which we designate as sm - ws , has been described in detail by us in @xcite , where also the results for @xmath18 are tabulated .",
    "we describe the model only briefly here , while making two minor updates to our previous results .",
    "the calculation is done in two parts , which is made possible by our dividing @xmath18 into two terms : _",
    "c1 + _ c2 .",
    "[ c1c2 ] the idea is that @xmath178 follows from a tractable shell - model calculation that does not include significant nodal mixing , while @xmath179 corrects for the nodal mixing that would be present if the shell - model space were much larger .    for @xmath178 , a modest shell - model space ( usually one major oscillator shell )",
    "is employed , in which coulomb and other charge - dependent terms are added to the charge - independent effective hamiltonian customarily used for the shell model .",
    "these charge - dependent additional terms are separately adjusted for each superallowed @xmath2 transition in order to reproduce the @xmath180- and @xmath181-coefficients of the isobaric multiplet mass equation ( imme ) for the triplet of @xmath13 , @xmath0 states that includes the parent and daughter states of the transition .",
    "since the coulomb force is long range , its influence in configuration space extends much further than the single major oscillator shell included in the calculation of @xmath178 . to incorporate the effects of multi - shell mixing ,",
    "we note first that its principal impact is to change the structure of the radial wave function by introducing mixing with radial functions that have more nodes .",
    "since this mixing primarily affects protons , it results in proton radial functions that differ from the neutron ones so , when the overlap is computed , its departure from unity determines the value of @xmath179 .",
    "the radial functions themselves are derived from a woods - saxon potential .",
    "again there is a case - by - case adjustment in the woods - saxon potentials to ensure that the different measured proton and neutron separation energies in the @xmath2-decay parents and daughters are correctly reproduced .",

    "unfortunately , though , the reduction in the error on the rms charge radius did not significantly lower the overall uncertainty assigned to @xmath179 because in all three cases the uncertainty is dominated by the spread in the results obtained from the three different methodologies . for the heaviest case , @xmath62rb , the revision in the rms radius was small , so it made no change in the value of @xmath179 but did reduce its uncertainty .",
    "however , even though the uncertainty in the radius was reduced by a factor of ten , it only led to a 20% reduction in the uncertainty for @xmath179 .",

    "<S> a new critical survey is presented of all half - life , decay - energy and branching - ratio measurements related to 20 superallowed @xmath0@xmath1 @xmath2 decays . included are 222 individual measurements of comparable precision obtained from 177 published references . compared with our last review in 2008 </S>",
    "<S> , we have added results from 24 new publications and eliminated 9 references , the results from which having been superceded by much more precise modern data . </S>",
    "<S> we obtain world - average @xmath3-values for each of the eighteen transitions that have a complete set of data , then apply radiative and isospin - symmetry - breaking corrections to extract  corrected \" @xmath4 values . </S>",
    "<S> fourteen of these @xmath4 values now have a precision of order 0.1% or better . in the process of obtaining these results </S>",
    "<S> we carefully evaluate the available calculations of the isospin - symmetry - breaking corrections by testing the extent to which they lead to @xmath4 values consistent with conservation of the vector current ( cvc ) . </S>",
    "<S> only one set of calculations satisfactorily meets this condition . </S>",
    "<S> the resultant average @xmath4 value , when combined with the muon liftime , yields the up - down quark - mixing element of the cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa ( ckm ) matrix , @xmath5 . the unitarity test on the top row of the matrix becomes @xmath6 if the particle data group recommended value for @xmath7 is used . </S>",
    "<S> however , recent lattice qcd calculations , not included yet in the pdg evaluation , have introduced some inconsistency into kaon - decay measurements of @xmath7 and @xmath8 . </S>",
    "<S> we examine the impact of these new results on the unitarity test and conclude that there is no evidence of any statistically significant violation of unitarity . finally , from the @xmath4-value data we also set limits on the possible existence of scalar interactions . </S>"
