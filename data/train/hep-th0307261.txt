    "different types of topological defects @xcite may have been formed during the phase transitions in the early universe . depending on the topology of the vacuum manifold @xmath0 these are domain walls , strings , monopoles and textures corresponding to the homotopy groups @xmath1 , @xmath2 , @xmath3 and @xmath4 , respectively .",
    "physically these topological defects appear as a consequence of spontaneous breakdown of local or global gauge symmetries of the system composed by self - coupling scalar higgs or goldstone fields , respectively .",
    "global monopoles are spherically symmetric topological defects created due to phase transition when a global symmetry is spontaneously broken and they have important role in the cosmology and astrophysics .",
    "the simplest theoretical model which provides global monopoles has been proposed a few years ago by barriola and vilenkin @xcite .",
    "this model is composed by a self - coupling iso - scalar goldstone field triplet @xmath5 , whose original global @xmath6 symmetry is spontaneously broken to @xmath7 .",
    "the matter field plays the role of an order parameter which outside the monopole s core acquires a non - vanishing value . the main part of the monopole s energy is concentrated into its small core .",
    "coupling this system with the einstein equations , a spherically symmetric metric tensor is found . neglecting the small size of the monopole s core",
    ", this tensor can be approximately given by the line element @xmath8 where the parameter @xmath9 , smaller than unity , depends on the symmetry breaking energy scale and codifies the presence of the global monopole , being @xmath10 the energy scale where the global symmetry is spontaneously broken . ] .",
    "this spacetime corresponds to an idealized point - like global monopole .",
    "it is not flat : the scalar curvature @xmath11 , and the solid angle of a sphere of unit radius is @xmath12 , so smaller than the ordinary one .",
    "the energy - momentum tensor associated with this object has a diagonal form and its non - vanishing components read @xmath13 .    the quantum effects due to the point - like global monopole spacetime on the matter fields have been considered in refs . @xcite and @xcite to massless scalar and fermionic fields , respectively . in order to do that , the scalar and spinor green functions in this background have been obtained .",

    "here we shall calculate the casimir densities for fermionic fields obeying mit bag boundary condition on the spherical shell in the point - like global monopole spacetime .",
    "specifically we shall calculate the renormalized vacuum expectation values of the energy - momentum tensor and the fermionic condensate in the regions inside and outside the spherical shell .",
    "as we shall see using the generalized abel - plana summation formula , all the components of the vacuum average of the energy - momentum tensor can be separated in two contributions : boundary dependent and independent ones .",
    "the boundary independent contribution is similar to previous result obtained in @xcite using different approach .",
    "it is divergent and consequently in order to obtain a finite and well defined expression we must apply some regularization procedure .",
    "the boundary dependent contribution is finite at any strictly interior or exterior point and does not contain anomalies .",

    "because the analysis of boundary independent term has been performed before , in this present analysis we shall concentrate on the boundary dependent part . taking @xmath14 , from our results in this paper as a special case",
    "we obtain the fermionic casimir densities for a spherical shell on background of the minkowski spacetime .",
    "motivated by the mit bag model in qcd , the corresponding casimir effect was considered in a number of papers @xcite ( for reviews and additional references see @xcite ) . to our knowledge , the most of the previous studies were focused on global quantities , such as the total vacuum energy and stress on the surface .",
    "the density of the fermionic vacuum condensate for a massless spinor field inside the bag was investigated in ref .",

    "in addition to describing the physical structure of the quantum field at a given point , the energy - momentum tensor acts as the source of gravity in the einstein equations .",
    "it therefore plays an important role in modelling a self - consistent dynamics involving the gravitational field @xcite . for the case of the minkowski bulk ,",
    "our calculation is a local extension of the previous contributions on the fermionic casimir effect for a spherical shell .",
