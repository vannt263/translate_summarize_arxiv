    "the study of extreme and rare events is a highly active and interdisciplinary research field @xcite .",
    "extreme events can have catastrophic consequences in fields such as climatology , population dynamics or economy @xcite . in lasers , for example , extreme and rare pulses have been observed in mode - locked lasers @xcite and in semiconductor lasers with continuous - wave optical injection @xcite or with phase conjugated feedback @xcite .",
    "we present a numerical study of the intensity pulses displayed by a semiconductor laser with optical feedback in the short cavity regime @xcite , such that the external cavity round trip time is smaller than the laser relaxation oscillation period .",
    "we use as a framework the well - known lang - kobayashi ( lk ) model  @xcite .",
    "previous numerical work based on the lk model has found high intensity pulses in the laser chaotic output , that correspond to transitions between external cavity modes ( ecms )  @xcite .",
    "we characterize these pulses and show that in specific parameter regions they are high enough to be considered extreme events",
    ".    in extreme value analysis the definition of an extreme event is arbitrary as is associated to an event that is rare and that has an extreme deviation from the average .",
    "qualitatively , extreme values are those in the tail of a long - tailed distribution ; quantitatively , there are two main approaches to define extreme values : 1 ) values that exceed ( or fall below ) a certain threshold are considered extreme @xcite , and 2 ) maxima ( or minima ) in `` blocks '' of the time series are considered extreme @xcite . in this work",
    "we use the first criterion and define extreme intensity pulses as those above a certain threshold .",
    "one should notice that both approaches involve a certain degree of arbitrariness , either in the selection of the threshold or in the selection of the length of the block .",
    "an example of the use of the first criterium is in oceanography , where extreme waves ( referred to as freak or rogue waves ) are those whose height is larger than the mean value plus four to eight times the standard deviation of the height distribution , or as waves with abnormality index larger than 2 @xcite .",
    "an example of the use of the second criterium is in climate data analysis , where extreme values can be annual , biannual , etc .    using the point - over - threshold criterium to define extreme intensity pulses , we study how they develop and how they are affected by noise .",
    "we demonstrate that an abrupt expansion in phase space of an attractor developed from an ecm creates an expanded attractor that sustains extreme pulses . for certain parameters",
    "this attractor coexists with a smaller attractor that develops from a different ecm .",
    "we identify two phenomena involved in the appearance and in the destruction of the attractor that sustains extreme pulses : deterministic intermittency when the attractor abruptly expands , and hysteresis when the attractor is destroyed .",
    "we also show that this scenario is robust under the inclusion of noise .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "section ii briefly describes the model employed , which is the well - known delay - differential lang - kobayashi model  @xcite .",
    "section iii presents the numerical results ; we first focus on deterministic simulations and then discuss the influence of noise .",
    "section iv presents a summary of the results and the conclusions .",
    "the rate equations for the complex optical field , @xmath0 , and the excess carrier number , @xmath1 , are  @xcite @xmath2    in these equations the dimensionless time , @xmath3 , and the delay time , @xmath4 , are in units of photon lifetime @xmath5 : @xmath6 , @xmath7 .",
    "the parameters are : @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the carrier lifetime , the feedback rate is @xmath10 , the feedback phase is @xmath11 , the pump current parameter is @xmath12 and the line width enhancement factor is @xmath13 .",
    "spontaneous emission noise is taken into account by a complex additive gaussian white noise , @xmath14 , and the noise strength is @xmath15 .",
    "the time - delayed feedback renders the system multistable and the model has several fixed - point solutions , usually referred to as _ external cavity modes _",
    "( ecms ) , that can be calculated from @xmath16    where @xmath17 , @xmath18 and @xmath19 are the steady state values of the phase difference , field amplitude and carrier number .",
    "the number of ecms increases with the feedback strength and their stability depends on the model parameters .    as @xmath10 increases new",
    "ecms appear in pairs after saddle - node bifurcations .",
    "the initially stable ecms leads a chaotic attractor after a series of bifurcations . with further increase of the feedback the chaotic attractors",
    "expand and eventually merge with previously existing attactors forming either an attractor ruin or a stable attractor @xcite .",
    "in the first case the chaotic dynamics is a transient after which the trajectory finds a stable ecm ; in the second case the attractor merging process results in a single stable attractor that can either coexist with a stable ecm , or it can be the only stable attractor ( this occurs when there are no stable ecms ) . when the chaotic dynamics is transient , it has been shown that the average duration of the transient increases several orders of magnitude for each unit we increase the value of the @xmath13 parameter @xcite . here",
    "we use the same parameters as in ref .",
    "@xcite , and the value of @xmath13 is high enough to guarantee that the duration of the chaotic transient ( if any ) is in practice infinite .",
    "we chose parameters similar to those in ref .",
    "@xcite , where the bifurcations of the ecms were studied in detail : @xmath20 , @xmath21 , @xmath22 and @xmath23 . in the simulations the feedback strength , the feedback phase and the noise strength are taken as control parameters .",
    "the equations are integrated with a second - order runge - kutta method with integration step @xmath24 .",

    "when the feedback increases , if @xmath30 the intensity pulses are relatively small ( below 4 ) ; however , slightly above this feedback level a sudden abrupt expansion of the pulse amplitude occurs reaching amplitudes higher than @xmath31 , without a clear maximum .",

    "there is a more densely visited range at low amplitudes that is similar before and after the expansion while large amplitude pulses occur only sporadically .    the distribution of pulse amplitudes , presented in fig .",

    "transition 1 _ was reported in a semiconductor laser with cw optical injection  @xcite . in  @xcite the attractor expansion",
    "was interpreted as due to the crossing of the attractor with a stable 2d manifold of a saddle point and the subsequent convergence towards a small region of the phase space ( that the authors called a `` narrow door '' ) that triggers the extreme intensity pulses . here , figs .",
    "[ fig:4](a ) and  [ fig:4b](a ) show that there is a similar convergence of the trajectories towards a `` narrow door '' before extreme intensity pulses occur .",
    "figure  [ fig:4](a ) was done by performing one long simulation of the noise - less rate equations , selecting the pulses that are above a certain amplitude threshold ( in this case equal to 10 ) and superposing sections of the intensity time - trace that contain the extreme pulse .",
    "each section covers a time interval of 60 ns and the superposition is done by centering each section at the peak of the extreme pulse .",
    "one can observe that the superposition generates a narrow curve well before and after the extreme pulse occurs .",

    "[ fig:4b](b ) ] is considerable more disperse and does not generate a narrow curve .",
    "these plots support a qualitative comparison of the behavior with feedback and with injection and , despite the differences in both systems , suggests that extreme intensity pulses in the optical feedback case could occur through a similar mechanism as in the optical injection case .",
    "however , the feedback time delay renders the phase space infinite dimensional and thus , the topological analysis of the trajectories in phase space is difficult .    , and other parameters are as indicated in the text .",

    "[ fig:1 ] ( a ) ) and the intensity becomes oscillatory with constant small amplitude .",
    "we will refer to this second abrupt change as _",
    "transition 2_. at this transition no sign of intermittency was observed . as shown in fig .",

    "the horizontal line indicates the threshold for extreme pulses.[fig : rpps],width=226 ]    the new attractor is now followed by decreasing the feedback strength , and its bifurcations are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] ( b ) .",
    "the attractor described previously ( referred to as attractor 1 ) coexists with this new attractor ( referred to as attractor 2 ) in a wide range of feedback strengths , as could be expected for a dissipative system .",
    "the periodic intensity undergoes a hopf bifurcation after which the cw regime is reached .",
    "then , the trajectory remains in this steady state ( corresponding to a stable ecm ) until the ecm disappears after a saddle - node bifurcation occurring at @xmath42 . at this point ,",
    "in the following referred to as _ transition 3 _ , the trajectory evolves back to attractor 1 , that sustains occasional extreme pulses , thus closing a hysteresis cycle .",
    "it seems that attractor 1 is not affected by the appearance / dissapearance ( for increasing / decreasing @xmath10 ) of the ecm .",
    "this can be due the fact that attractor 1 and the ecm are well separated in the phase space , because attractor 1 originates from a different ecm .",
    "once the trajectory is back in attractor 1 , if we continue decreasing the feedback strength the bifurcation scenario is the same as that observed when we increased the feedback [ compare fig .",

    "[ fig:1 ] .",
    "[ fig : feedback_phase],width=226 ]           one could expect that random fluctuations , unavoidable in lasers , could induce switchings between the coexisting attractors previously discussed . in order to explore the effect of noise we did the bifurcation diagrams shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] sweeping the feedback strength upwards and downwards , but now including additive noise in the simulations . in fig .",
    "[ fig : noise ] we show in detail the three transitions with and without noise . before _",
    "transition 1 _ noise leads to occasional extreme intensity pulses ( fig .",
    "[ fig : noise ] ( a)-(c ) ) .",
    "these noise - induced pulses are due to large excursions in the phase space , after which the trajectory relaxes back to the attractor .    the effect of noise observed at _ transitions 2 _ and _ 3 _ is the one expected when two attractors coexist : in fig .",
    "[ fig : noise ] ( d)-(f ) ( the feedback increases ) one can notice that noise anticipates the transition to attractor 2 , because _ transition 2 _ occurs at a smaller value of @xmath10 . in fig .",
    "[ fig : noise ] ( g)-(i ) , we see that _ transition 3 _ ( the feedback decreases ) is also anticipated , i.e. , occurs at a higher @xmath10 value .",
    "to summarize , we studied numerically the dynamics of a semiconductor laser with optical feedback from a short external cavity and demonstrated the existence of parameter regions where the laser intensity displays extreme pulses .",
    "we identified three relevant transitions involved in the appearance of the extreme pulses . _",
    "transition 1 _ and _ transition 2 _ are related to the appearance and destruction of the attractor that sustains extreme pulses .",
    "this attractor coexist with another smaller one in a broad range of feedback strengths ( from _ transition 2 _ to _ transition 3 _ ) which defines a hysteresis cycle .",
    "we also demonstrated that noise does not modify this scenario but only anticipates the different transitions .    while our results are fully consistent with the findings of ref .",
    "@xcite , where the sequence of bifurcations leading to regular pulses packages ( rpps ) was studied in detail , our simulations suggest that rpps and extreme pulses are different dynamical behaviors and occurs in different parameter ranges .",
    "this is because the rpps have a well defined periodicity and pulse amplitudes that are not extreme [ fig .",
    "[ fig : rpps ] ] , and also , because even when strong noise is included in the simulations , rpps are robust and no extreme pulses are observed for parameters corresponding to rpp dynamics [ fig .",
    "[ fig : noise](f ) ] . on the contrary",

    "transition 1 _ ( at _ transition 1 _",
    "extreme pulses appear in the noiseless simulations ) [ fig .",
    "[ fig : noise](c ) ] .",
    "since diode lasers with integrated short external cavities are nowadays widely used in many applications that require single - frequency , compact and efficient light sources , our results can help avoiding extreme intensity pulses in these devices , that might originate due to un- controlled small variations of the feedback parameters .",
