    "also , as pointed out in [ sowhatagain ] , the sign of the degree of 1-cuspidal characters ( and consequently of the corresponding 1-harish - chandra series ) is arbitrary , though we fixed it such that the leading term is positive when it is real . for the imprimitive groups we give the correspondence between our labels and symbols as in @xcite .    for primitive groups ,",
