    "a single wall cylindrical nanotube is a graphene sheet rolled into a cylindrical shape . for this case",
    "we have spatial topology @xmath2 with the compactified dimension of the length @xmath3 .",
    "the carbon nanotube is characterized by its chiral vector @xmath4 , with @xmath5 , @xmath6 being integers , and @xmath7 , @xmath8 .",
    "a zigzag nanotube corresponds to the special case @xmath9 , and a armchair nanotube corresponds to the case @xmath10 .",
    "all other cases correspond to chiral nanotubes . in the case",
    "@xmath11 , @xmath12 , the nanotube will be metallic and in the case @xmath13 the nanotube will be semiconductor with an energy gap inversely proportional to the diameter .",
    "the electronic band structure of a graphene sheet close to the dirac points shows a conical dispersion @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is the momentum measured relatively to the dirac points and @xmath16 represents the fermi velocity .",
    "the corresponding low - energy excitations can be described by a pair of two - component weyl spinors . by taking into account that in the presence of an external magnetic field an effective mass term is generated for the fermionic excitations , we consider the general case of massive spinor field @xmath17 on background of @xmath18-dimensional flat spacetime with spatial topology @xmath2 .",
    "the corresponding line element has the form @xmath19 , where @xmath20 and @xmath21 .",
    "we assume that the field obeys the boundary condition @xmath22with a constant phase @xmath23 .",
    "for metallic nanotubes @xmath24 and for semiconductor nanotubes , depending on the chiral vector , we have two classes of inequivalent boundary conditions corresponding to @xmath25 . in the expression for",
    "the casimir densities the phase @xmath23 appears in the form @xmath26 and , hence , the casimir energy density and stresses are the same for these two cases .",
    "the vev of the energy - momentum tensor for a cylindrical nanotube has the form ( no summation over @xmath27 ) @xmath28with the notations @xmath29 , @xmath30 .",
    "in particular , the casimir energy density is positive for metallic nanotubes and negative for semiconducting ones .",
    "in the massless case we have @xmath31 , with the notation @xmath32 .",
    "in particular , @xmath33 and @xmath34 . in carbon nanotubes",
    "we have two sublattices and each of them gives the contribution to the casimir densities given by ( [ emtnano ] ) .",

    "for the geometry of a toroidal nanotube we have the spatial topology @xmath36 .",
    "the boundary conditions have the form@xmath37the corresponding energy density and the vacuum stresses are given by the expressions ( no summation over @xmath27)@xmath38with @xmath39 , @xmath40 , and @xmath41 . the corresponding formulae for the casimir densities in toroidal nanotubes are obtained with an additional factor 2 . in standard units",
    "the factor @xmath42 appears as well . from the formulae given above",
    "it follows that the toroidal compactification of a cylindrical nanotube along its axis increases the casimir energy for periodic conditions ( @xmath43 ) and decreases the casimir energy for the semiconducting - type compactifications .",
    "in this section we will assume that the nanotube has finite length @xmath44 .",
    "we assume the periodicity condition ( [ bccyl ] ) along the compact dimension .",

    "the last term in eq .",
    "( [ edecomp ] ) is the interaction part .",
    "the single edge part of the casimir energy does not depend on the length of the tube and will not contribute to the casimir force .    for the casimir force acting on the edges of the tube we have@xmath52 the corresponding expressions for the casimir energy and force in finite length cylindrical nanotubes",
    "are obtained with an additional factor 2 .",
    "so , for the casimir force acting per unit length of the edge of a carbon nanotube one has : @xmath53 . for long tubes , @xmath54 ,",
    "the first term on the right of ( [ pcn ] ) is dominant and we have @xmath55 for metallic nanotubes and @xmath56 for semiconducting ones . in the limit @xmath57 the casimir force",

    "we have investigated the casimir effect for cylindrical and toroidal nanotubes within the framework of the dirac - like model for electrons .",
    "the vev of the energy - momentum tensor is given by formula ( [ emtnano ] ) for cylindrical nanotubes and by ( [ t00d2tor ] ) and ( [ tlld2tor ] ) ( with an additional factor 2 which takes into account the presence of two sublattices ) for toroidal nanotubes .",
