    "gravity sometimes appears in condensed - matter physics .",
    "fifty years ago , luttinger introduced a gravitational potential to calculate heat transport coefficients  @xcite .",
    "recently , it was shown that the spin current can be generated by mechanical rotation  @xcite .",
    "viscosity is a response to torsion , which is neglected in general relativity  @xcite .",
    "now gravity is not only a research interest in the fields of high - energy physics and cosmology but is a powerful tool to describe many kinds of external fields in condensed - matter physics .",
    "a unified description from the viewpoint of gravity brings about a deeper understanding of such gravitational responses .    among these gravitational responses ,",
    "heat transport is one of the most important phenomena .",
    "traditionally , charge and heat transport phenomena have been investigated within the semiclassical boltzmann theory  @xcite .",
    "one exception is the anomalous hall effect in ferromagnetic metals  @xcite . since it is a complicated phenomenon involving the intrinsic mechanism due to the multiband berry - phase effect and extrinsic mechanisms due to disorder , a systematic perturbation theory with respect to disorder strength , e.g. , the keldysh formalism , is necessary  @xcite . experimentally ,",
    "the anomalous thermal hall effect ( the ) is useful for investigating effects of inelastic scattering on the anomalous hall effect at finite temperature  @xcite .",
    "the the was also used to detect the magnon hall effect in ferromagnetic insulators  @xcite . to understand these phenomena , a systematic quantum - mechanical formula for the thermal hall conductivity ( thc ) is highly desired .",
    "one important point is that the kubo formula alone is not sufficient and should be augmented with the heat magnetization ( hm ) to avoid the unphysical divergence at zero temperature  @xcite .",
    "these previous theories are unsatisfactory because the scaling relations on the charge and heat currents are assumed without any microscopic explanations and , furthermore , it remains unclear how to apply them to disordered or interacting systems .",
    "the hm also appears in the context of topological superconductors ( tscs )  @xcite .",
    "electromagnetic responses are not effective because the u(@xmath1 ) gauge symmetry is broken . instead",
    ", the thc is known to be quantized in @xmath0-d tscs  @xcite . in @xmath2-d tscs",
    ", it was theoretically proposed that the hm is induced by a temperature gradient and the heat polarization by an angular velocity of rotation  @xcite .",
    "a possible question is what actions describe these topological phenomena .",
    "note that the spin - connection analogs of the chern - simons term and axion electrodynamics  @xcite can not do because these actions do not vanish at zero temperature .",
    "our main purposes are twofold .",
    "one is to revisit the basics of heat transport from the gauge - theoretical viewpoint .",
    "compared to charge transport where the u(@xmath1 ) gauge symmetry plays an important role , heat transport has been less discussed regarding a symmetry and its gauge field . as a result",
    ", the definition of the heat current has been controversial : the product of the hamiltonian and the velocity or that of the time derivative and the velocity .",
    "here we propose that the latter has a corresponding gauge field and is the proper definition .",
    "we also find that a torsional magnetic field induced by this gauge field is conjugate to the hm .",
    "in other words , the hm can be obtained by using a perturbation theory with respect to a torsional magnetic field .",
    "we emphasize that this torsional magnetic field is totally different from a gravito - magnetic field or an angular velocity discussed previously  @xcite .",
    "the other is to establish a unified framework for calculating gravitational responses .",
    "the gauge - covariant keldysh formalism is one of the most sophisticated perturbation theories with respect to electromagnetic fields  @xcite and can be applied to insulators or metals with disorder or interactions at finite temperature . by combining it with a gauge theory of gravity , the so - called cartan formalism",
    ", we develop the keldysh@xmath3cartan formalism especially to calculate the hm and thc .",
    "although we can apply this formalism to disordered or interacting systems , here we focus on the clean and non - interacting limit to reproduce the wiedemann - franz law .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sect .",
    "[ sec : grav ] , we explain luttinger s idea and revisit it from the gauge - theoretical viewpoint . based on this discussion , in sect .",
    "[ sec : gauge ] , the hm and the thermal conductivity are defined as torsional responses , which is the first part of our results . in sects .",
    "[ sec : keldysh ] and [ sec : torsion ] , we show the second part of our results , i.e. , the keldysh@xmath3cartan formalism and the first - order perturbation theory with respect to torsion .",
    "we explicitly calculate the hm and the kubo - formula contribution to the thc in sects .",
    "[ sec : hm ] and [ sec : kappa ] , respectively . as a corollary",
    ", we discuss an effective action for the quantized the in @xmath0-d tscs in sect .",
    "[ sec : topo ] .",
    "section  [ sec : summary ] is devoted to the summary .",
    "let us summarize our notations .",
    "we assign the latin ( @xmath4 ) and greek ( @xmath5 ) alphabets to locally flat coordinates and global coordinates , respectively .",
    "we follow the einstein convention , which implies summation over the spacetime dimension @xmath6 when an index appears twice in a single term .",
    "the minkowski metric in a flat spacetime is taken as @xmath7 .",
    "the planck constant and the electric charge are written as @xmath8 and @xmath9 , respectively .",
    "we use @xmath10 .",
    "upper or lower signs in equations correspond to bosons or fermions .",
    "first , we intuitively review luttinger s idea that relates a gravitational potential to non - uniform temperature  @xcite .",
    "we begin with an unperturbed system with a non - uniform chemical potential @xmath11 and temperature @xmath12 .",
    "the partition function in the local equilibrium is given by @xmath13 .",
    "\\label{eq : part1}\\ ] ] the chemical potential and temperature are statistical forces and hence can not be treated as perturbations .",
    "instead , we introduce mechanical forces @xmath14 and @xmath15 by    @xmath16    [ eq : mech ]    now the system is equivalent to the perturbed system in the uniform chemical potential @xmath17 and temperature @xmath18 , whose partition function is given by @xmath19 .",
    "\\label{eq : part2}\\ ] ] as a scalar potential @xmath14 is a mechanical force equivalent to the non - uniform chemical potential , a gravitational potential @xmath15 , or @xmath20 , is equivalent to the non - uniform temperature .",
    "however , it is still unclear why @xmath15 is called a gravitational potential .    to answer this question , we revisit the fundamentals of heat transport , as well as charge transport , in terms of symmetries and gauge fields .",
    "the noether theorem tells us that a global continuous symmetry gives rise to a conservation law  @xcite .",
    "the u(@xmath1 ) gauge symmetry leads to the charge conservation law .",
    "we can explicitly construct the charge current conserved when the on - shell condition is satisfied .",
    "then , according to the gauge principle , we require the local gauge symmetry .",
    "although a matter field alone does not possess it , the total system consisting of a matter field and a vector potential does .",
    "this vector potential @xmath21 , which is introduced by replacing the partial derivative @xmath22 with the covariant one @xmath23 , is coupled to the charge current .",
    "such a discussion holds for heat transport .",
    "the time translation symmetry gives rise to the energy conservation law .",
    "similarly , the space translation symmetry , which is usually absent in condensed - matter physics , leads to the momentum conservation law .",
    "if we require the local spacetime translation symmetry , a corresponding gauge field is naturally introduced .",
    "since local spacetime translations are general coordinate transformations @xmath24 , the partial derivative transforms as a covariant vector , and the covariant derivative should be given by @xmath25 .",
    "this gauge field @xmath26 , called a vielbein , is coupled to the energy - momentum tensor . in particular",
    ", @xmath27 is coupled to the hamiltonian density and hence is a gravitational potential that luttinger introduced  @xcite , while @xmath28 is coupled to the energy current defined by the product of the time derivative and the velocity . note that the other energy current defined by the product of the hamiltonian density and the velocity is obtained by imposing the on - shell condition but has no corresponding gauge field .",
    "now we can relate a theory of heat transport to gravity .",
    "the local spacetime translation symmetry is required by the general covariance principle , and a vielbein can be found in a gauge theory of gravity , i.e. , the cartan formalism  @xcite .",
    "this formalism consists of two gauge fields ; a vielbein @xmath26 and a spin connection @xmath29 .",
    "the latter is associated with the local lorentz symmetry and hence appears together with the generator of lorentz transformations @xmath30 . in these gauge fields , we have to replace the partial derivative @xmath31 with the covariant one , @xmath32    more concretely , let us concentrate on a dirac fermion .",
    "the dirac lagrangian density in a curved spacetime is given by @xmath33 in which @xmath34 is the determinant of a vielbein , @xmath35 is the dirac conjugate , and the @xmath36 matrices satisfy the clifford algebra @xmath37 .",
    "first , we put @xmath38 to obtain @xmath39 \\psi .",
    "\\label{eq : dirac1}\\ ] ] here @xmath40 and @xmath41 are the dirac matrices , and @xmath42 is not the covariant derivative in general relativity but the nabla in vector analysis .",
    "thus @xmath43 is a gravitational potential coupled to the hamiltonian density . on the other hand ,",
    "let us introduce an off - diagonal component @xmath44 . since the inverse has @xmath45 , eq",
    ".   becomes @xmath46 \\psi .",
    "\\label{eq : dirac2}\\ ] ] as expected , @xmath44 is a `` vector potential '' coupled to the energy current defined by the product of the time derivative and the velocity @xmath40 .",
    "next , we define the thermal conductivity and the hm based on the above discussion . since a vielbein and a spin connection are gauge fields , they induce field strengths called torsion and riemann tensors :    @xmath47    [ eq : field2 ]    if we choose @xmath48 , a torsional electric field @xmath49 is the mechanical force equivalent to a temperature gradient , while a torsional magnetic field is the field strength coupled to the hm .",
    "thus the kubo - formula contribution to the thermal conductivity and the hm are naturally defined by    @xmath50    [ eq : def ]    where @xmath51 is the heat current defined by the product of the time derivative and the velocity as discussed above , and @xmath52 is the free energy .",
    "this is the first part of our results and is justified below by explicitly deriving the wiedemann - franz law for the thc in the clean and non - interacting case .",
    "those in the fields of high - energy physics or cosmology may not be familiar with picking up a particular spacetime by hand . in general relativity , we impose the torsion - free condition to determine the spin connection uniquely . in this case , a temperature gradient is equivalent to the torsion - free spin connection @xmath53 .",
    "however , as the electric conductivity is a current response to an electric field , the thermal conductivity should be that to a field strength but not a gauge field .",
    "moreover , in condensed - matter physics where the lorentz symmetry is usually absent , we can not rely on a spin connection .",
    "therefore a torsional electric field is the best choice for a mechanical force equivalent to a temperature gradient .",
    "once a torsional electric field is fixed , it is not important to choose @xmath27 or @xmath28 .",
    "indeed , these two are connected by local time translations @xmath54 .",
    "remember that a vielbein is a covariant vector and transforms as @xmath55 .",
    "even if we start from one spacetime with @xmath56 , we can move to another spacetime with    @xmath57    [ eq : timetr ]    in particular , we can choose @xmath58 and @xmath59 . of course , both spacetimes give the same torsional electric field @xmath60 .    on the other hand , we emphasize that a torsional magnetic field is essentially different from an angular velocity of rotation .",
    "the former is induced by a vielbein @xmath44 , leading to the non - trivial metric , @xmath61 while the latter is represented by @xmath62 with @xmath63 . here",
    "@xmath64 is an angular velocity .",
    "this metric is represented by a vielbein @xmath65 .",
    "these two vielbeins can not be connected by local time translations but by local lorentz transformations .",
    "nonetheless , these two metrics coincide in the gravito - electromagnetism , namely , when the second - order perturbations to the minkowski metric are neglected .",
    "it is a natural question whether these second - order perturbations are important even if linear responses are concerned .",
    "from the gauge - theoretical viewpoint , a vielbein is primary , and a metric is secondary .",
    "since the latter is given by the square of the former , i.e. , @xmath66 , we can not drop these second - order perturbations in the metric formalism .",
    "in other words , the gravito - electromagnetism is not even an approximation for either eq .   or eq .  .",
    "this point was not correctly understood in the previous works  @xcite .",
    "now an important problem is the experimental feasibility of a torsional magnetic field in condensed - matter physics . in the context of high - energy physics and cosmology ,",
    "this is closely related to the fundamental problem of ` which action describes the correct gravity ? ' .",
    "remember that we use an electromagnet to generate a magnetic field in condensed - matter physics .",
    "this is based on the amp ` ere - maxwell law , and , more fundamentally , on the maxwell action in addition to the coupling between the charge current and a vector potential .",
    "if there is the torsional analog of the maxwell action , a torsional magnetic field is more or less feasible .",
    "however , we can not answer this problem because we only use torsion as external fields .",
    "in this section , we present a general framework for calculating gravitational responses based on the keldysh formalism . we begin with the keldysh formalism in a flat spacetime  @xcite to construct that in a curved spacetime . the dyson equation in a flat spacetime",
    "is well known , @xmath67 where @xmath68 is the lagrangian density , and @xmath69 is convolution .",
    "the keldysh green function @xmath70 and the self - energy @xmath71 contain three independent real - time green functions and self - energies , respectively .",
    "we write them in the matrix form , @xmath72 where @xmath73 , @xmath74 , and @xmath75 indicate the retarded , advanced , and lesser components defined by    @xmath76_{\\mp } \\right\\rangle , \\label{eq : gr } \\\\",

    "\\label{eq : g<}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    [ eq : green1 ]    the lesser green function acts as the density matrix and is useful for calculating thermal expectation values .",
    "there are two effects of gravity .",
    "one is to replace the volume element @xmath77 with the covariant one @xmath78 .",
    "therefore the dyson equation   is modified by @xmath79 where convolution and the @xmath80-function in a curved spacetime are defined by  @xcite    @xmath81    [ eq : det ]    however , by introducing a tensor density , @xmath82 the dyson equation can be written in the same form as that in a flat spacetime symbolically , @xmath83    in a flat spacetime , just symbolically , we can use the wigner representation  @xcite .",
    "this is a kind of fourier transformation and makes it easy to deal with convolution .",
    "we introduce the center - of - mass coordinate @xmath84 and the relative coordinate @xmath85 and then perform the fourier transformation on the latter : @xmath86 the wigner representation of convolution is given by the non - commutative moyal product , @xmath87    [ e^{i p_{2 a } ( x_1^a - i \\hbar \\partial_{p_a})/\\hbar } e^{x_2^a \\partial_{x^a}/2 } { \\hat b}(x , p ) ] \\notag \\\\    = & { \\hat a}(x , p ) e^{i \\hbar { \\cal f}_0/2 } { \\hat b}(x , p ) .",
    "\\label{eq : moyal}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] we employ the inverse fourier transformation in the second line and change variables @xmath88 , @xmath89 , @xmath90 , and @xmath91 in the third line .",
    "the poisson bracket in this phase space is defined by @xmath92 where a partial derivative on the left of @xmath93 acts on the wigner representation on the left - hand side , and vice versa .",
    "we can expand the moyal product with respect to @xmath8 as @xmath94 , while we can construct the moyal product from the poisson bracket by using the deformation quantization  @xcite .",
    "the commutation relation , which is assumed in the canonical quantization , can be derived by acting the moyal product on @xmath95 and @xmath96 . in the wigner representation ,",
    "the dyson equation   becomes @xmath97    here we take into account the generator of lorentz transformation @xmath98 , which satisfies the poincar ' e algebra , i.e. , the commutation relations regarding @xmath99 and @xmath98 . for those with a condensed - matter background , it might be better to call @xmath98 spin . to do that",
    ", we assume the extended poisson bracket : @xmath100 the second and third terms describe the poincar ' e algebra .",
    "such an extension was already done in the context of the twisted spin  @xcite .",
    "although the corresponding moyal product @xmath69 may not be represented by such a simple form as @xmath101 , it is expanded with respect to @xmath8 as @xmath102 . by using the moyal product ,",
    "if obtained , the dyson equation   is also extended to @xmath103    the other effect of gravity is to replace the partial derivative @xmath31 with the covariant one in eq .",
    "this is realized by replacing the momentum @xmath99 with the mechanical momentum corresponding to the covariant derivative : @xmath104 therefore the dyson equation in gauge fields is represented by @xmath105 however , since @xmath106 is a complicated function of @xmath107 , it is convenient to change variables from @xmath107 to @xmath108 .",
    "this is a natural extension of the so - called peierls substitution in the presence of a vector potential  @xcite .",
    "correspondingly , owing to the chain rule for partial derivatives , we obtain    @xmath109    [ eq : chain1 ]    and then    @xmath110    [ eq : chain2 ]    as a result , the poisson bracket , eq .  , is perturbed as @xmath111 the fourth term describes the emergent commutation relation between the mechanical momenta in the presence of gauge fields .",
    "the corresponding moyal product @xmath112 , which now we call the star product , is expanded with respect to @xmath8 as @xmath113 .",
    "it is an important future problem to construct this star product from the poisson bracket by using the deformation quantization  @xcite , which helps us go beyond the first - order perturbation theory with respect to field strengths .",
    "note that the star product was already constructed in the presence of electromagnetic fields alone  @xcite . by using the star product ,",
    "the dyson equation   attains the following simple form : @xmath114 the set of eqs .   and is the second part of our results .",
    "it is a natural extension of a general framework for calculating electromagnetic responses previously established  @xcite and enables us to calculate gravitational responses , as shown below .",
    "let us derive the first - order perturbation theory with respect to the static and uniform torsion .",
    "we drop the @xmath115-dependence in the green function and the self - energy and impose the @xmath116-dependence on the band indexes .",
    "we expand the star product , the green function , and the self - energy as    @xmath117    [ eq : perturbtem ]    the green function and the self - energy with the subscript @xmath118 indicate those in equilibrium , and the green function with the capital letter @xmath119 indicates that disorder and/or interactions are taken into account .",
    "note that eq .",
    "is not semiclassical but exact and fully quantum - mechanical up to the first order with respect to the static and uniform torsion .",
    "according to the deformation quantization , the exact form of the star product is defined by the infinite - order expansion with respect to @xmath8 and may be represented by a couple of exponentials of the poisson bracket  @xcite . in general , even if we restrict ourselves to the first order with respect to torsion , infinite terms containing the spacetime derivatives of torsion arise from a combination of the first and fourth terms in eq .  .",
    "however , if torsion is static and uniform , we do not suffer from this infinite - order problem with respect to @xmath8 .",
    "below we calculate the first - order green function with respect to torsion , i.e. , @xmath120 .",
    "this is totally in parallel with the previous calculation for that with respect to electromagnetic fields  @xcite because the only difference is that torsion is coupled to @xmath121 while electromagnetic fields are coupled to @xmath9 as seen in eq .  .",
