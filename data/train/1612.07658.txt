    "two level systems , quantum dots ( qd ) and electric dipole antennas located close to a metal nanostructure are basic components for quantum plasmonics @xcite .",
    "moreover , nanoplasmonics is a very active field of study that have attracted a great deal of attention in recent years @xcite .    in a previous paper , we analysed a planar perfect surface as an important limiting case of a perfect conductor wedge @xcite . we know that plasmonic excitation is not possible for the perfect conductors",
    "the results for a real metal differ significantly from that of a perfect electric conductor since for an ideal metal surface the only available enhancement mechanism is scattering . having this motivation ,",
    "we have considered a real metal surface to demonstrate strong enhancement of light near a plasmonic surface .    in the present work",
    "we discuss the emission of radiation by localized systems of oscillating charge and current densities .",
    "we have considered the radiation from a dipole antenna or a sinusoidally oscillating charge positioned sufficiently near a real metal surface .",
    "the plasmonic nanofocusing structures produce a strong enhancement and confinement of a local field . we have also obtained and plotted the plasmonic electric field enhancements of the dipole antenna system as a function of its distance to a metal surface @xcite .",
    "our theoretical results may lead to new optical manipulation methods for nanoscale optical communication , biophotonics , nanoscale lithography and medical testing @xcite .",
    "also it is expected that many new applications will be developed for such physical systems in the years to come .",
    "the response of a dipole placed in front of a complex structure can be characterized using the green s function approach @xcite .",
    "so , we will present a useful and applicable expression for green s tensor of a metal - dielectric interface structure , where the plasmonic contribution @xmath0 will be obtained by extracting the contribution of the pole of the reflection coefficient for p - polarized waves incident on the metal interface @xcite .",
    "since the normal orientation is the optimal direction to couple with the metal surface , a majority of works have considered only perpendicular polarization , here we have considered both orientations .",
    "we shown that for the case of a dipole pointing perpendicular to the metal surface , the strong electric field enhancement can be resulted in contrast to the case of parallel orientation of the dipole that is in agreement with the results reported in @xcite .    also , for developing nanophotonic single photon devices , a study on the second - order correlation property of the fluorescence is necessary and important @xcite .",
    "second - order correlation function is a typical nonclassical property of light , which demonstrates the single photon emission @xcite .",
    "single - photon sources play a central role in light - based quantum - information systems and in modern quantum optical applications .",
    "the demonstration of efficient , scalable , on - chip single photon sources is one of the most important challenges @xcite . in the final section ,",
    "we have investigated the second - order correlation property of the the light emission from a qd placed near a planar metal .",

    "also we will obtain the term @xmath0 from the total green s tensor by extracting the contribution to the pole of the reflection coefficient for p - polarized waves incident on the metal interface .    from appendix",
    "a , it is seen that the components of matrix @xmath33 has poles given by the denominator of the fresnel factors for p - polarized field . for a dielectric / metal interface , they correspond to the surface plasmon as discussed previously .",
    "we evaluate the pole contribution to the green s tensor by integrating in the complex @xmath34-plane and denote @xmath35 as a root of the denominator . in some works emphasis is placed on the fields in the metal or dielectric @xcite . here , the dipole as a source , is placed at a distance @xmath36 above a metal surface and we will show the enhancement of the field in the vicinity ( above ) of metallic surface .",
    "thus , we just need the green s function in the upper half - space ( @xmath37 ) . we consider both orientations of the dipole , normal and parallel",

    "again we see that for a dipole in free space the electric field is significant only in the region around the dipole ( fig.5(a ) ) , while for a dipole near the surface , the plasmonic field is enhanced near the surface and this field becomes weaker as the distance from the surface is increased as expected ( fig.5(b ) ) .    in fig .",
