    "the dynamics that can be triggered in a quantum many - body system is in general very rich and complex .",
    "many - body hamiltonians , especially those related to strongly correlated systems , usually generate entanglement within the components of the many - body system which results in populating the exponentially large amount of orthogonal states available in the hilbert space  @xcite .",
    "such dynamics is not only interesting from the fundamental point of view but also from its potential applications .",
    "some examples of the rich potentiality of quantum many - body systems are , among others , measurement - based quantum computation  @xcite , where ground states of many - body hamiltonians are used as the basic resource for the computation , adiabatic quantum computation  @xcite , which exploits the many - body dynamics of fine - tuned engineered interactions , and topological quantum computation  @xcite , which hinges on the nonlocal properties of some many - body systems .    in this work",
    "we aim at employing many - body dynamics for quantum information and computation purposes ; by encoding qubits in the many - body system , the dynamics may be rendered on demand to move , transform , and entangle quantum information , hence , providing a powerful means to perform universal quantum computation .",
    "however , this implementation often requires a great amount of control of the dynamics .",
    "such a control could be achieved , of course , if one would have the possibility to modify the interactions on demand . in this case",
    ", the engineering protocol would consist in a sequence of interaction tunings yielding a complex time dependent hamiltonian .    in this article",
    ", we show that this kind of control can also be achieved using an _ always - on _ many - body hamiltonian .",

    "the key ingredient in order to control the dynamics will be the quantum zeno effect  @xcite .",

    "this hamiltonian is a particular case , called _ uimin - lai - sutherland _ model  @xcite , of a spin-@xmath13 chain governed by the most general isotropic hamiltonian with nearest neighbor interactions @xmath14 where @xmath15 are the usual spin-@xmath13 operators at site @xmath11 . for @xmath16 eq .",
    "( [ eq : hamiltonian ] ) is recovered , up to irrelevant constant terms , where @xmath17 .",
    "this hamiltonian , as will be shown , preserves the quantum information and naturally generates a quantum walk which can be driven using measurements .",
    "spin levels will be denoted by @xmath18 .",
    "a qubit can be encoded using the levels @xmath19 .",
    "the absence of qubit will be encoded with the state @xmath0 , called _",
    "vacuum_. note that this choice of states is completely arbitrary and for the main part of the paper , they can be regarded simply as _",
    "labels_. only in section  [ sec : extensions ] it will matter what physical state is chosen to represent the vacuum .",
    "we can introduce the number operator in each one of the levels , @xmath20 , where @xmath21 is the projector onto state @xmath22 in site @xmath11 ( @xmath23 ) .",
    "the number operators @xmath24 are conserved quantities , @xmath25=0 $ ] . the number operator @xmath26 counts the _ number of qubits _ encoded in the chain . from now on we will specialize to the 1-qubit subspace ( @xmath27 ) , namely , states with quantum number @xmath28 .",
    "separable one - qubit states can be written as @xmath29 , meaning that the qubit @xmath30 is encoded in site @xmath31 , namely @xmath32 these states span the 1-qubit subspace @xmath27 , which can be naturally factorized as @xmath33 , where @xmath34 represents the qubit hilbert space and @xmath35 is the hilbert space for the position degree of freedom . with this factorization",
    "the hamiltonian acts trivially on @xmath36 , _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath37 , and separable one - particle states naturally factor into @xmath38 .",
    "thus , hereafter @xmath39 indicates that the qubit is at site @xmath31 .",
    "we will use the hat to denote operators acting _ only _ on the position space @xmath40 .",
    "let us now discuss the effect of continuous measurements on some sites .",
    "the dynamics under continuous measurement ( represented by projectors @xmath41 ) can be described by the effective hamiltonian @xmath42 where @xmath43 is the outcome of the measurement .",
    "this is usually called _",
    "quantum zeno dynamics _  @xcite .",
    "the qze will allow to tailor the evolution of our system on demand .",
    "the measurement that allows to perform the desired tasks is @xmath44 which corresponds to determining whether site @xmath31 contains a qubit ( @xmath45 ) or not ( @xmath46 ) .",
    "it is understood that these act trivially ( @xmath47 ) on the remaining sites .",
    "the representation of the @xmath48 operators in @xmath27 can be obtained from @xmath49 where @xmath50 and @xmath31 takes values on all sites .",
    "these matrix elements impliy that @xmath51 here we have used @xmath52 and @xmath53 . from this , one obtains the representation of @xmath54 since @xmath55 from now on we ommit the subscripts @xmath36 and @xmath40 when no confusion arises .",
    "since both measurement projectors act trivially on the qubit space @xmath36 it is convenient to introduce the position projectors by observing that @xmath56 ( @xmath57 ) , where @xmath58 acts on @xmath40 and is given by @xmath59 ( @xmath60 ) .",
    "thus , the action of this measurement is effectively questioning whether the qubit is located at position @xmath31 or not , without revealing the actual state of the qubit .",
    "the effect of measuring more than one site at a time ( sites @xmath61 ) can be described by the projectors @xmath62 with this notation , measurement of the @xmath63 observable on all sites of the block implements the observable @xmath64 on space @xmath40 .",
    "we now analyze the dynamics of the spin chain in the 1-qubit subspace , and the effect of the continuous measurements . we will show how different parts of the chain can be decoupled , giving rise to the notion of _ blocks _ , which can encode one qubit each , turning the spin chain into a quantum register .",
    "we begin by showing the effect a continuous measurement @xmath65 with outcome `` @xmath66 '' has on the effective hamiltonian .",
    "the effective dynamics will be given by the operators @xmath67 , because the measured site is encountered in the @xmath0 state .",
    "these operators read @xmath68 where the identity is assumed in all the other sites .",
    "this is easily proven by writing @xmath69 , where @xmath70 run over all spin-1 states .",
    "whenever @xmath31 equals @xmath11 or @xmath12 , the sum @xmath71 immediately collapses into @xmath72 . if @xmath73 no further simplification is possible .",
    "a key observation is that if an @xmath74 continuous measurement is performed on a site , say @xmath31 , ( or set of neighbouring sites ) and the outcome `` @xmath66 '' is obtained , the two sides of this site are decoupled .",
    "this can be seen by realizing that the only terms in the hamiltonian ( [ eq : hamiltonian ] ) that couple site @xmath31 to its left and right neighbours are @xmath75 .",
    "taking into account expression ( [ eq : effectivew ] ) , these terms effectively become @xmath76 where subindices refer to chain sites . adding all the remaining terms in eq .",
    "( [ eq : hamiltonian ] ) the effective hamiltonian can be written as @xmath77 where @xmath78 , and @xmath79 .",
    "since these operators commute , the time evolution factors into @xmath80 hence , the chain is effectively divided into two parts @xmath81 and @xmath82 which evolve independently , separated by a site in the @xmath0 state .",
    "more generally , the chain can be split into _ blocks _ by performing continuous measurements in various points along the chain [ see fig .",
    "[ fig : sketch]_a _ ] .",
    "each block can be thought of as an individual chain with its own dynamics , given by the hamiltonian @xmath83 where the @xmath84 and @xmath85 subscripts represent the outermost _ left _ and _ right _ sites of the block , respectively , and the @xmath86 terms arise from the boundary interaction under zeno dynamics . for simplicity",
    "we have considered one site to split the chain , but the argument is also valid if several contiguous sites are measured .",
    "note that a similar approach has been taken in a three - site system to perform two qubit gates @xcite .    in the following",
    "we will focus on a single block of size @xmath5 , with sites labelled from @xmath13 to @xmath5 .",
    "the effective hamiltonian reads @xmath87 , with @xmath88 acting on @xmath40 , given by ( in the basis @xmath89 ) @xmath90 plus an irrelevant constant term .",
    "assume the block is initially prepared in the state @xmath91 and let @xmath92 represent its corresponding density operator , @xmath93 .",
    "the natural evolution under the hamiltonian @xmath94 corresponds to a delocalization of the qubit , by a continuous time quantum walk  @xcite with dirichlet boundary conditions @xmath95 , while preserving its internal state .",
    "the position of the qubit can be localized on - demand by simply measuring @xmath96 .",
    "moreover , if @xmath96 is performed continuously , the time evolution is frozen and delocalization is prevented [ see fig  [ fig : sketch]_b _ ] .",
    "in fact , when this is the case , the block is reduced to a single site , e.g. , that encoding the qubit . finding the qubit in site @xmath31 corresponds to the projector @xmath97 ,",
    "thus the density operator reads @xmath98 , where @xmath99 is the qubit state and trivially @xmath100=0 $ ] , thus @xmath101=0 $ ] .",
    "the quantum zeno dynamics generated by the continuous measurement of @xmath96 prevents @xmath92 from evolving outside the space generated by @xmath102 .    in summary ,",
    "the spin chain can be split into blocks , each one containing a delocalized qubit , that can be instantly and continuously localized by measuring all sites of the block in which it is encoded .",
    "the notion of blocks will be central throughout the remaining of the paper . in this section",
    "we show that shifting and resizing blocks provides a simple way to perform perfect state transfer with a large degree of versatility .",
    "shifting a block ( or its boundary ) corresponds to changing the set of sites being measured [ fig .",
    "[ fig : blocks ] ] .",
    "for example , suppose a block from site 9 to site @xmath103 is defined by measuring sites @xmath104 and one wants to shift the left boundary ( @xmath105 ) by one site to the right [ fig .",
    "[ fig : blocks]_a _ ] .",
    "this is accomplished by , at any given time , starting to measure also site @xmath106 , so that @xmath107 becomes @xmath108 [ fig .",
    "[ fig : blocks]_b _ ] .",
    "it is necessary to keep measuring site @xmath105 for a small amount of time , in case the qubit would be encountered in site @xmath106 , to prevent it from interacting with the block to the left ( which may contain another qubit ) . in the event that the qubit is found in site @xmath106",
    "[ fig : blocks]_c _ ] , one would go back to the initial configuration of measurements [ fig .  [",
    "fig : blocks]_a _ ] , and after a given time ( comparable to the timescale @xmath109 ) the shifting is attempted anew .",

    "a natural question is whether two - qubit gates can be implemented within this scheme . in this section we answer this question in the positive .",

    "if two qubits could be placed in confined neighbouring sites ( a size - two block containing two qubits ) and separated without further difficulty , implementation of @xmath179 for arbitrary @xmath180 would be trivial .",
    "one would just let the system evolve for a time @xmath181 , and the quantum gate @xmath179 would be implemented .",
    "however , placing the two qubits in neighbouring sites and separating them without affecting the two - qubit state is not possible . despite this difficulty we show in the following a procedure to implement any two - qubit gate of the form @xmath179 , with arbitrary @xmath180 .",
    "let us consider the starting configuration as depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig:2qbgate]_a_. this is a static configuration that can be easily reached with the state transfer procedures explained above .",
    "the two - qubit gate will be implemented through three stages ; @xmath182 _ interaction switch on _",
    ", @xmath183 _ interacting _ , and @xmath184 _ interaction switch off_. the _ switch on / off _ stages use a repeat - until - success method , while the _ interacting _ stage is deterministic and is used to accommodate arbitrary @xmath180 phases and correct the phases introduced by the _ switch on / off _ stages .",
    "even the phases introduced in the unsuccessful switch - off attempts can be corrected by remaining in the interacting stage a given time after each failed attempt .    the switch on / off stages consist on letting the free qubit propagate and performing a position measurement at specific times .",
    "it is clear that in order to preserve coherence in the switch on / off stages one must ensure that for every possible outcome @xmath85 of the position measurement , the transformation on the two - qubit state be unitary , _",
    "i.e. , _ @xmath185^\\dagger=\\left[\\frac{f^+_{rk}(t)}{\\sqrt{p({\\bf",

    "[ fig : gplot ] ] .",
    "this means that @xmath188 must be independent of the parity of the two - qubit state .",
    "moreover , limiting the size of the block to two sites guarantees that @xmath189 , as follows from @xmath190 let @xmath191 be such that @xmath192 . performing a position measurement on the free qubit at time",
    "@xmath191 does not provide any information about the two - qubit state .",
    "however , the state is transformed according to @xmath193 , where @xmath31 is the initial position of the free qubit and @xmath85 is the outcome of the measurement .    at this point , it is clear that the switch on stage introduces a relative phase @xmath194 , where @xmath195 is the number of failed attempts .",
    "this phase can easily be corrected during the interacting stage , when also the target phase @xmath180 is applied .",
    "the switch off stage will introduce , when successful , a phase @xmath196 , that can be also accounted for during the interacting stage .",
    "therefore , in the interacting stage the total phase that needs to be applied is @xmath197 .",
    "when the switch off stage is unsuccessful , the introduced phase is @xmath198 and the qubits remain coupled .",
    "hence , the phase can be corrected immediately after each unsuccessful switch off stage .",
    "the resulting two - qubit state after successful switch off is @xmath199 see a sketch of the algorithm in fig .",
    "[ fig:2qbg_alg ] .",
    "notice that this scheme is deterministic , _",
    "i.e. , _ it can be implemented with a finite number of trials with exponentially close to 1 probability .",
    "furthermore , the results developed so far hold with full generality with arbitrary setups where size-2 blocks can be constructed .",
    "this means that other geometries such as 2d lattices , ladders or zigzag chains can also be approached with the same analysis . for the particular case at hand",
    "we have @xmath200 and latexmath:[\\[\\begin{aligned }        moreover , when computing the time @xmath191 for the target phase , there are several solutions .",
    "thus , one can choose several times at which the target phase is acquired , while optimizing for success probability , number of trials or other considerations .",
    "let us remark that by implementing @xmath202 gates , one can interchange the positions of two qubits , thus allowing for arbitrary two - qubit crossings .",
    "this allows us to perform perfect state transfer not only inside a block but in the whole register .",
    "just like in the previous section we have shown how position measurements can induce unitary transformations on the two - qubit state by choosing to perform the measurements at appropriate times , projections on the symmetric and antisymmetric two - qubit subspaces ( triplet and singlet , respectively ) can equally be implemented by measuring at times @xmath191 when the effect of the measurement is an @xmath155 or @xmath81 projection . in particular",
    "we show that choosing @xmath191 appropriately one can implement a generalized measurement with one conclusive outcome ( @xmath155 or @xmath81 ) and one inconclusive outcome . by alternating these two kinds of measurement ,",
    "one obtains , with exponentially close to 1 probability in the number of trials , a conclusive outcome corresponding to @xmath155 or @xmath81 .",

    "[ fig:2qbgate]_a_. choose @xmath203 such that @xmath204 . by performing a position measurement at time @xmath203",

    "an outcome in site 1 corresponds to a projection onto the symmetric subspace @xmath155 , while if the qubit is encountered in site @xmath208 , no conclusive outcome can be inferred .",
    "however , one can perform another measurement after time @xmath209 such that @xmath210 , with corresponding kraus operators @xmath211 with this , the overall final effect on the two - qubit state can be summarized as @xmath212 where @xmath213 is used to denote an inconclusive outcome , and @xmath214 and @xmath215 , which are guaranteed to be pure phases due to the choice of @xmath203 and @xmath209 and unitarity of @xmath216 .",
    "the corresponding povm operators are @xmath217 , fulfilling @xmath218 and yielding the probabilities @xmath219 , @xmath220 the free qubit remains in site @xmath208 after every inconclusive outcome , while hopping to site 1 indicates a conclusive outcome depending on the stage of the protocol in which the hopping occurs ( @xmath155 or @xmath81 for hopping in the first or second measurement , respectively ) .",
    "this measurement scheme can be iterated until a conclusive outcome is obtained . after a conclusive outcome",
    "it is trivial to separate the two qubits by just enlarging the block size and letting the free qubit propagate for some time .",
    "it is important to notice that after every inconclusive outcome the two - qubit state is altered as @xmath221 .",
    "the kraus operators corresponding to outcome @xmath155 or @xmath81 after @xmath5 inconclusive outcomes are given by @xmath222 which , as required , fulfill @xmath223 .",
    "it is relevant to consider the probability for a given number of consecutive inconclusive outcomes .",
    "the probability for @xmath5 successive inconclusive outcomes is given by @xmath224 which decreases exponentially in @xmath5 .",
    "more importantly , the probability of obtaining @xmath5 inconclusive outcomes followed by a conclusive one is @xmath225 summing over all possible number of inconclusive outcomes yields @xmath226 and analogously @xmath227 , as expected from a quantum mechanical parity measurement .",
    "more formally , it can be seen that the superoperator associated with outcome @xmath228 ( @xmath229 or @xmath81 ) , given by @xmath230 is @xmath231 which is nothing but a parity measurement . moreover , since parity is a conserved quantity in the effective dynamics , this sequence of measurements implements a qnd parity measurement  @xcite .",
    "therefore , a projective parity measurement that distinguishes the singlet state from the triplet can be implemented by a trial and error generalized measurement implemented through local measurements of the form of  eq .",

    "also , the choice for timings corresponds to arbitrary choices of assigning position outcomes to symmetric or antisymmetric outcomes .",
    "different choices could be made which take into account other considerations such as expected number of trials before a conclusive outcome , average time before a conclusive outcome occurs , robustness against fluctuations in some parameter , etc .",
    "the aim of this section is not to engineer a specific protocol but rather to show that , in principle , the parity measurement is possible within a finite time given the assumed hamiltonian dynamics and the projective measurements of  eq .",
    "( [ eq : kmeasurement ] ) .",
    "in previous sections we have seen that , in principle , perfect state transfer , two - qubit gates and projective parity measurements can be implemented only by making use of assumptions _",

    "the term @xmath244 trivially vanishes in the one - qubit subspace .",
    "however , for empty two - site blocks , the dynamics becomes nontrivial , as the term @xmath244 couples the states @xmath245 to the state @xmath246 .",
    "more precisely , the transition probability from an empty block to an occupied block is@xmath247 where @xmath248 .",
    "hence , measuring the number of particles after a time @xmath249 one will obtain two qubits in the entangled state @xmath246 with probability @xmath250 .",
    "this shows that , given an initialization of the spin chain to @xmath251 , tweaking the parameter @xmath232 in the hamiltonian , combined with continuous projective measurements of the form of eq .",
    "( [ eq : kmeasurement ] ) provide a means to create pairs of qubits from the initially _ empty _ chain .",
    "notice that this is a global modification of the total hamiltonian , which does not imply a site - wise modification of the interaction .",
    "moreover , this modification only needs to be made at a beginning stage of the protocol , when qubits are created for later information storage / transfer / processing .",
    "moreover , the procedure directly creates entangled pairs that can be deterministically separated using the methods established in section  [ sec:2qbdynamics ] , and distributed by means of the state transfer techniques and therefore used as resources for teleportation .",
    "single qubit gates are , in principle , an easy task , since they do not require many - body interactions .",
    "if one can assume local addressability , it is straightforward to devise schemes in which the qubit is localized by the @xmath96 measurement and the corresponding external field is applied .",
    "this assumes that the two qubit states @xmath1 can be selected .",
    "however , assuming local measurements of the form of eq .",
    "( [ eq : kmeasurement ] ) does not imply that all sorts of local addressability are granted .",
    "for this reason , we would like to address the situation in which the only local addressing is done via the measurements of eq .",
    "( [ eq : kmeasurement ] ) and any other perturbation is as general as possible .    with full generality , any external perturbation that locally transforms the states in an @xmath5 site block",
    "can be expressed as an additional term in the hamiltonian of the form @xmath252 where @xmath253 is the @xmath254th gell - mann matrix acting on site @xmath31 .",
    "for simplicity , let us assume that the generators are expressed in the basis @xmath255 ( in this order ) . assuming that the block contains a single qubit , upon continuous measurement of the @xmath96 observable with outcome @xmath31 , the effective hamiltonian becomes @xmath256 where @xmath31 is the outcome of the @xmath96 measurement .",
    "this reduction is easily seen by observing that @xmath257 is trivial for all sites @xmath258 ( @xmath259 for @xmath260 and @xmath261 ) , whereas the terms corresponding to the outcome of @xmath96 , @xmath262 are @xmath263 this means that only the coefficients @xmath264 for @xmath31 being the outcome of the @xmath96 measurement and @xmath265 are relevant for the evolution of the qubit , which is generated by the effective hamiltonian @xmath266 in the @xmath243 representation .",
    "the initial hamiltonian assumed here is relatively general and will accommodate several practical situations . in particular , it is remarkable that local access to single sites is only required for the measurements , whereas the external hamiltonian does not require to be of single - site or local nature . although it is not our aim here to suggest a physical implementation for our scheme , it is worth stressing that this level of generality accommodates the reality of several physical implementations .",
    "moreover , the scheme naturally prevents transitions between the @xmath267 , @xmath268 states and the @xmath0 state .    as an illustrative example we can show how to describe a site - dependent magnetic field @xmath269 coupled to the spin-1 chain .",
    "the interaction hamiltonian reads @xmath270 the spin-1 matrices can be written as @xmath271 notice that the spin matrices need to be properly rearranged to meet the basis ordering that we have picked @xmath255 .",
    "once we have this , we can cast the magnetic interaction into the form of eq .",
    "( [ eq : extinteraction ] ) by defining @xmath272 which yields an effective hamiltonian @xmath273 this also shows that a homogeneous magnetic field introduces a constant relative phase between the @xmath267 and @xmath268 states , which can be accounted for by going to the interaction picture .",
    "note that the particular form of the interaction depends on the choice of the _ vacuum _ state @xmath0 .",
    "a completely analogous derivation shows that , if the _ vacuum _",
    "representative had been chosen to be @xmath268 instead of @xmath0 , the effective hamiltonian would be @xmath274 this choice , however , would also affect the results of the previous subsection , and entangled qubit pairs would no longer be easily created .",
    "nevertheless , the results on state transfer and two - qubit gates do remain unchanged .",
    "we have shown how one can implement , in a one - dimensional quantum many - body system , a quantum register in which quantum state transfer , universal two - qubit gates , and two - qubit parity measurements can be achieved by an always - on , and time - independent , many - body hamiltonian with nearest - neighbour interactions . the control required for performing these tasks , which are the crucial ingredients for universal quantum computation ,",
    "is provided by frequent projective measurements ( yielding the quantum zeno effect ) at the appropriate times and sites of the chain .",
    "moreover , measurements are always in the same basis .",
    "we have also shown some possible modifications of the initially assumed dynamics in order to create maximally entangled qubit pairs , which can be used to initialize the quantum register , and single qubit gates .",
    "the ideas presented here can be easily generalized to 2 and 3-dimensional lattices .",
    "although 3d lattices would provide the best scalability , we believe 2d would provide the optimal trade - off between scalability and difficulty to implement the measurements .",
    "moreover , 2d lattices have the advantage over 1d that the qubits can be freely moved without the need to perform a @xmath152 gate at every qubit crossing .",
    "also , different configurations such as ladders or zigzag chains may provide interesting geometries .",
    "the natural and interesting extension of this work is to present an experimental proposal of the theoretical scheme presented here .",
    "this would open up many interesting questions such as the robustness of the scheme and the effect of imperfect measurements . to this purpose ,",
    "we envisage two suitable physical systems : 1 ) coupled arrays of quantum dots  @xcite , which naturally implement the @xmath167-@xmath7 model , of which our hamiltonian is a particular case ( @xmath275 ) .",
    "the charge electrons would play the role of the qubit , each site having three possible states , one in which the dot is empty and two for the occupied dot with spin - up and spin - down electron .",
    "the on - site measurements would be performed by charge - sensing techniques such as quantum point contacts . on the other hand the exchange coupling and the hopping rates could be tuned independently , giving extra freedom to implement two - qubit gates without the need to resort to repeat - until - success methods .",
    "2 ) trapped ions , where the hamiltonian could be implemented by effective methods  @xcite and the on - site measurements by resonance fluorescence measurements . in this case",
    ", one should investigate how to avoid the heating of the ions by photon scattering in the measurement process .    in a general framework",
    ", we would like to briefly discuss some error sources hindering the effectivity of our scheme , in particular for the implementation of two - qubit operations .",
    "it is difficult to establish a specific error model without specializing to a particular physical implementation .",
    "however , three kinds of errors related to imperfect local measurements may be anticipated :    1 .",
    "_ measurements projecting on a basis different than expected_. since the hamiltonian is basis - independent this error is prevented , as one may choose the vacuum state as the one distinguishable by the measurement .",
    "2 .   _ false negatives _ , where a measurement fails to yield outcome `` @xmath66 '' with small probability .",
    "this error can be reduced by concatenating several measurements , exponentially reducing the probability of a false negative at the expense of increasing the time it takes for a measurement to be performed .",
    "uncertainties on the time @xmath167 at which the measurements are performed _ , as a result of technical difficulties or of fundamental limitations imposed by the time - energy uncertainty relations .",
    "this source of error is intimately related to the previous one and has the potential effect of removing us from the zeno regime .",
    "a direct way of coping with this error is to reduce the coupling strength @xmath7 in such a way as to ensure that the zeno dynamics remain a good approximation .",
    "most measurements are however , continuous in nature ( _ i.e. _ , resonance fluorescence in ions or cold atoms , charge measurements on quantum dots , etc . ) . despite the departure from the theoretical framework in which standard von neuman measurements",
    "are often thought of , a continuous time analysis of the quantum zeno effect can be made , leading to essentially the same conclusions  @xcite .",
    "the question is then , whether or not one can turn on and off the measurement at a timescale smaller than that of the hamiltonian dynamics .",
    "if that is not the case , a more detailed analysis should be made , which involves the optimization of the _ average _ times @xmath191 , @xmath203 and @xmath209 at which the measurements are performed . expressing the average gate fidelities as a function of these times",
    "[ averaged over all possible two - qubit states , number of trials and time fluctuations @xmath123 ] , and assuming that fluctuations are small , one can see that the essential quantities contributing to a non - perfect fidelity are the derivatives of the functions @xmath277 and @xmath278 .",
    "one may exploit the freedom available in choosing the times @xmath191 , @xmath203 and @xmath209 , in order to reduce the noise in the gates , by finding a compromise between the average or expected number of trials ( each trial introduces some error ) before the gate is completed , the time derivatives of the relevant functions ( quickly varying functions lead to larger errors ) , and the kinds of errors that one may be able to tolerate ( _ i.e. _ , phase errors , singlet - triplet collapse for controlled phase gates , etc . ) .    finally , there are some kinds of errors that can not be corrected within the proposed setup .",
    "the most prominent of them is revealing information regarding the actual state of the qubit ( _ i.e. _ , revealing whether a site is in state @xmath267 or @xmath268 ) .",
    "such errors can not be addressed by methods specific to our scheme , and error - correction schemes would then be necessary . also , non - projective measurements different from the _ false negative _ or _ false positive _ have no clear solution within this scheme",
    ". however , these seem to be highly unlikely for the kinds of implementations that we have mentioned . in conclusion ,",
    "the difficulties and possibilities for correcting and tolerating errors should not lead to resignation . instead , they must serve as a guide to choose the most appropriate physical implementation .",
