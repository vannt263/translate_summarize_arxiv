    "vortices in turbulence are often envisaged as rotating bodies of fluid , traveling as coherent islands in an otherwise incoherent ambient flow @xcite .",
    "this lagrangian view is appealingly simple , yet challenging to apply in actual vortex detection .",
    "the main difficulty is to classify fluid particle paths systematically as coherent or incoherent .    as a result",
    ", coherent features of turbulence are mostly described through instantaneous eulerian quantities , such as velocity , pressure and their derivatives ( * ? ? ?",

    "* for reviews ) . in this approach",
    ", vortices are typically defined as regions of closed contours of an eulerian scalar field , often with some added thresholding requirement .",
    "such criteria can be highly effective in framing short - term features of the flow , even if the extracted coherent structures tend to be frame - dependent .    in unsteady flow ,",
    "however , eulerian vortex boundaries are not material barriers .",
    "a fluid mass initialized in an eulerian vortex will generally lose coherence , showing stretching and filamentation along the vortex path .",
    "the end - result for the fluid mass is widespread dispersion with little or no directionality @xcite .",
    "yet identifying coherent material vortices is becoming increasingly important in a number of areas .",
    "for instance , mesoscale oceanic eddies are broadly thought to carry water without substantial leakage or deformation .",
    "if their boundaries indeed resist filamentation , such eddies can create moving oases for the marine food chain @xcite , or even impact climate change through their long - range transport of salinity and temperature @xcite .",
    "lagrangian diagnostic tools show that some eulerian vortices can carry fluid , but their leakage tends to be substantial @xcite . a rigorous approach to finding non - leaking material boundaries",
    "has recently emerged , but focuses only on relatively rare boundaries that maximize lagrangian shear @xcite .",
    "parallel to these developments , coherent vortices are sometimes described as whirlpools , or maelstroms , in popular fiction .",
    "an early example can be found in edgar allan poe s short story entitled _ a descent into a maelstrm _",

    "the advected curve remains coherent if an initially uniform material belt ( green ) around it shows no leading - order variations in stretching after advection .",
    "[ fig : deffigure ] ]    as we show below , this view turns out to have some merit .",
    "when appropriately modeled , poe s coherent belt becomes mathematically equivalent to a photon sphere , , a surface on which light encircles a black hole without entering it .",
    "this analogy yields computational advantages , which we exploit in locating material eddy boundaries in the south atlantic ocean . using satellite altimetry - based velocities from this region , we uncover super - coherent lagrangian vortices , and derive estimates for coherent material transport induced by the agulhas leakage .",
    "we start with a two - dimensional velocity field of the form @xmath3 with @xmath4 labeling the location within an open region @xmath5 of interest and with @xmath2 referring to time .",
    "fluid trajectories generated by @xmath6 obey the differential equation @xmath7 whose solutions are denoted @xmath8 ) , with @xmath9 referring to the initial position of the trajectory at time @xmath10 .",
    "the evolution of fluid elements is described by the flow map @xmath11 which takes any initial position @xmath9 to a later position at time @xmath2 .",

    "however , we seek exceptional @xmath19 curves around which @xmath18-thick coherent belts show no observable variability in their average straining ( figure [ fig : deffigure ] ) .",
    "such coherence in the strain field precludes nearby fluid elements from breaking away from @xmath19 .",
    "again , by smooth dependence of finite - time strain on distance , the actual strain variability in such coherent , @xmath18-thick belts can not be more than @xmath20 .    to express this coherence principle mathematically",

    "we also let @xmath25 denote the length of the corresponding tangent vector @xmath26 along the advected curve @xmath27 .",
    "these two tangent lengths can be calculated as @xmath28 where @xmath29 denotes the euclidean inner product @xcite .",
    "the averaged tangential strain along @xmath19 is then given by @xmath30 as argued above , if an observable coherent material belt exists around @xmath19 , then on @xmath31-close material loops we must have @xmath32 , where @xmath33 denotes small , periodic perturbations to @xmath19 .",
    "this is only possible if the first variation of @xmath34 vanishes on @xmath19 : @xmath35    the calculus of variations applied to leads to complicated differential equations that do not immediately provide insight ( appendix a ) .",

    "all stationary curves of @xmath41 that coincide with those of @xmath34 are found to have zero energy density ( appendix b ) , satisfying the implicit differential equation @xmath42 these material curves @xmath21 are therefore uniformly stretched by the same factor @xmath43 when advected by the flow from time @xmath10 to time @xmath2 .",
    "such @xmath43__-lines _ _ serve as perfectly coherent cores for observably coherent material belts around them",
    ".    equation only admits nondegenerate @xmath21 solutions on the flow domain @xmath44 where the two - dimensional tensor @xmath45 has nonzero eigenvalues of opposite sign . in this domain",
    "the curves @xmath21 are obtained as closed trajectories of one of the two explicit differential equations ( appendix c ) @xmath46    such closed trajectories will occur in families of limit cycles parametrized by the stretching parameter @xmath43 .",
    "one can show that no two members of any such family can intersect ( appendix e ) .",
    "thus a limit cycle of the vector field @xmath47 will either grow or shrink under changes in @xmath43 , forming smooth annular regions of nonintersecting loops .",
    "the outermost member of such a band of coherent material loops will be observed physically as the lagrangian vortex boundary .",
    "indeed , immediately outside this boundary , no coherent material belts may exist in the flow .",
    "the trajectories of , as stationary curves of the stretch energy @xmath37 , admit an appealing geometric interpretation .",
    "first , note that on the domain @xmath44 , the quadratic function @xmath48 defines a lorentzian metric , with signature @xmath49 inherited from the eigenvalue configuration of @xmath45 @xcite .",
    "a lorentzian metric extends the classic notion of distance to hyperbolic spaces . as such",
    ", it can also return zero or a negative value for the distance between two points that have a positive euclidean distance .",
    "thus , @xmath50 can be viewed as a two - dimensional lorentzian manifold @xcite , or in the language of general relativity , a two - dimensional spacetime .",
    "in such a spacetime , light travels along null - geodesics of the lorentzian metric , which are curves on which the lorentzian metric vanishes identically . in our fluidic spacetime @xmath50 , null - geodesics satisfy @xmath51 and hence coincide with the @xmath43-lines described in .",
    "the closed @xmath43-lines we have been seeking are therefore closed null - geodesics of @xmath52 . in cosmology , such null - geodesics occur around black holes , representing loops that trap light forever . often called _ photon spheres _",
    "@xcite , these closed curves are tangent to the _ light cones _ , which in our case are defined by the two vectors @xmath53 ( figure [ fig : analogy ] ) .    ]    due to its special nonstretching nature , we refer to a photon sphere of @xmath54 as a",
    "_ primary photon sphere_. photon spheres of @xmath45 with @xmath55 will be referred to as _ secondary photon spheres_. a primary photon sphere in our context resists the universally observed material stretching in turbulence : it reassumes its initial arclength at time @xmath2 .",
    "this conservation of arclength , along with the conservation of the enclosed area in the incompressible case , creates extraordinary coherence .    even if a primary photon sphere does not exist in a region , secondary photon spheres with either @xmath56 or @xmath57",
    "may well be present .",
    "the largest of these photon spheres marks the end of the family of coherent belts .",
    "it will signal either weak stretching ( @xmath58 ) or weak contraction ( @xmath59 ) for the vortex it bounds . weakly compressing lagrangian vortices",
    "are evolving towards even fuller coherence , preserving their enclosed area while smoothing out mild bumps in their boundaries .",
    "by contrast , weakly stretching lagrangian vortices can be viewed as domains of slowly eroding coherence , where a perfect , nonstretching core can no longer be found .",
    "motivated by these observations , we introduce the following terminology . a _ black - hole _ _",
    "vortex _ is a region surrounded by an outermost ( i.e. , locally the largest ) photon sphere ( or _ ring _ ) of the tensor family @xmath45 .",
    "a _ primary black - hole vortex _ is one that contains at least one primary photon sphere , such as the one shown in figure [ fig : analogy ] .",
    "secondary black - hole vortex _ is one that only contains secondary photon spheres .",
    "such a vortex is either _ strengthening _ ( @xmath60 or _ weakening _",
    "( @xmath61 .",
    "the above analogy with black holes has practical implications for locating lagrangian vortices in a complex flow . to see this , note that the strain eigenvectors @xmath62 and @xmath63 in become ill - defined at points where @xmath64 .",
    "null - geodesics , such as those forming photon spheres , can not be extended to such points , because the green  lagrange metric @xmath65 is singular there [ @xmath66 .",
    "these degenerate points are analogs of penrose  hawking singularities in cosmology @xcite .",
    "intuitively , one expects that any coherent lagrangian vortex in the fluid must contain such a singularity in its interior , just as all black holes are expected to contain penrose  hawking singularities .",
    "this expectation turns out to be correct , leading to the following result ( appendix d ) : at time @xmath10 , the interior of a lagrangian vortex must contain a point @xmath67 satisfying @xmath68 . specifically , only regions containing such points may fully incorporate lagrangian vortices .",
    "based on these findings , admissible regions for coherent lagrangian vortices are those with at least one metric singularity [ @xmath69 . in practice , metric singularities tend to cluster , and we only consider clusters surrounded by an annular region with no singularities . in these admissible regions ,",
    "lagrangian vortex boundaries are sought as outermost green  lagrange photon spheres , , outermost limit cycles of the differential equations .",
    "this process involves conceptually simple numerical steps , but its implementation requires care for noisy observational data ( appendix f ) .",
    "we apply our results to the agulhas leakage , a byproduct of the agulhas current of the southwest indian ocean . at the end of its southward flow ,",
    "this boundary current turns back on itself , creating a loop that occasionally pinches off and releases eddies ( agulhas rings ) into the south atlantic .",
    "lagrangian transport by coherent agulhas rings has implications for global circulation and climate change @xcite .",
    "as shown by @xcite , eddy tracking from instantaneous altimetric sea - surface - height ( ssh ) measurements @xcite would substantially overestimate the coherent part of this transport . here",
    "we reconsider the region studied by @xcite and show how the coherent lagrangian vortex principle developed here uncovers previously unknown material eddies , sharpening available coherent transport estimates .",
    "the south atlantic ocean region in question is bounded by longitudes [ 14@xmath70w , 9@xmath70e ] and latitudes [ 39@xmath70s , 21@xmath70s ] . using satellite altimetry data , we seek coherent lagrangian vortices ( black - hole eddies , for short ) over a 90-day time period , ranging from @xmath10 = 24 november 2006 to @xmath71 22 february 2007 .",
    "appendix g provides more information on the data and the numerical methods employed .",
    "the computational steps reviewed in the appendix f yield eight admissible regions for lagrangian vortices ( figure [ fig : bh - candidates ] , top panel ) . out of these eight regions ,",
    "only seven turn out to contain black - hole eddies , bounded by outermost green  lagrange photon spheres ( figure [ fig : bh - candidates ] , bottom - left panel ) .",
    "two of these are primary black - hole eddies , containing primary photon spheres .",
    "the latter curves were previously identified by @xcite as locally most shearing lines from other methods .     and admissible lagrangian vortex regions ( yellow ) .",
    "the dark green singularity clusters are surrounded by singularity - free belts of at least 50-km in diameter .",
    "( bottom - left panel ) black - hole eddy boundaries ( light green , with @xmath43 values in light green ) and primary photon spheres ( red ) .",
    "the @xmath72 signs shown are those of @xmath47 .",
    "( bottom - right panel ) advected lagrangian vortex boundaries @xmath73 months later .",
    "[ fig : bh - candidates ] ]    out of the two primary black - hole eddies , eddy 2 has a slightly weakening external boundary with @xmath74 , while eddy 3 has a slightly strengthening boundary with @xmath75 .",
    "the boundaries of the secondary black - hole eddies 4 and 5 are also slightly gaining coherence ( @xmath75 ) , whereas the secondary eddies 6 , 7 and 8 are losing coherence ( @xmath76 , 1.04 and 1.13 , respectively ) .",
    "accordingly , the boundary of eddy 6 is expected to exhibit the largest degree of stretching .",
    "this stretching is still uniform , leaving room for a coherent material belt for the 90-day study period .",
    "these conclusions are confirmed by the bottom - right panel of figure [ fig : bh - candidates ] , showing the seven advected black - hole eddy boundaries three months later .",
    "we verified the theoretically predicted @xmath43 stretching values for black - hole eddy boundaries by their direct numerical advection . in this test",
    ", we found the @xmath43 values obtained from advection to be accurate up to two decimal digits , as listed in the left - bottom panel of figure [ fig : bh - candidates ] .",
    "since these eddy boundaries are constructed as limit cycles , they are structurally stable , i.e. , smoothly persist under small errors and uncertainties in the observational data set .",
    "the detailed knowledge of black - hole eddies yields specific estimates for their lagrangian transport rates . as in @xcite ,",
    "we assume that the eddies are bounded from below by the isotherm of 10@xmath70c , located roughly at 400 m in the area of study . under this assumption",
    ", we obtain the eddy transport rates shown in table [ tab : sv ] . on average , a black - hole eddy moves water northwestward at a rate of about 1.3 sv ( 1 sv @xmath77 m@xmath78s@xmath79 ) .",
    "this represents a 30upward refinement to the 1-sv estimate of @xcite for average transport by ssh eddies in the agulhas leakage .",
    "more significant is the difference between the total eddy transport calculated from black - hole eddies and the total eddy transport calculated from ssh eddies using the estimate of @xcite . as seen from table [ tab : sv ] , ssh snapshots significantly overestimate coherent eddy transport .",
    ".transport rates in sv for black - hole ( bh ) eddies and ssh eddies on 24 november 2006 . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     we note that in situ measurements analyzed by @xcite reveal some mesoscale eddies reaching depths as large as 2000 m or more , as opposed to the generic 500-m depth assumed by @xcite and in the present work .",
    "the difference in the previous eulerian and the present lagrangian transport estimates increases linearly with the assumed depth for the eddy .",
    "finally , the top panel of figure [ fig : bh - tracks ] shows a longer computation of the paths of the seven black - hole eddies .",
    "most preserve their coherence way beyond their 3-month extraction period .",
    "also shown the evolution of fluid starting from a nonlinear ssh eddy obtained from the analysis of @xcite ( figure [ fig : bh - tracks ] , bottom panel ) .",
    "this illustrates the rapid loss of coherence that fluid initialized in an eulerian vortex will generically experience in turbulence .",
    "common lagrangian diagnostics of material coherence do not fare well either .",
    "for instance , the finite - time lyapunov exponent ( ftle ) field displays ridges spiraling into black - hole eddies in the ocean region studied here .",
    "this incorrectly signals a lack of coherent material boundaries for agulhas rings , as noted by @xcite .",
    "we have given a variational description of coherent lagrangian vortex boundaries as closed belts of fluid showing no leading - order variability in their averaged material straining .",
    "such material belts are filled with closed null - geodesics of a generalized green  lagrange strain metric , which can be computed as limit cycles of a lagrangian vector field .",
    "outermost members of such limit cycle families mark observed boundaries of material coherence . using this approach ,",
    "we have found exceptionally coherent material belts in the south atlantic , filled with analogs of photon spheres around black holes .",
    "our results apply to any two - dimensional velocity field , providing a frame - independent way to detect coherent lagrangian vortices .",
    "in addition to the transport of diffusive water attributes , the transport of other materials ( , garbage or oil contamination ) is also expedited by the coherent lagrangian vortices identified here . related results on elliptic regions in steady inertial particle motion @xcite suggest that these vortices will capture and swallow nearby passively floating debris .",
    "thus , beyond the mathematical equivalence , there are also observational reasons for viewing coherent lagrangian eddies as black holes .    continually available",
    "observational data for the ocean are limited to two spatial dimensions .",
    "however , the existence of a coherent material belt outside down- or upwellings should already be well - captured by two - dimensional altimetry data .",
    "we therefore also expect black - hole - type vortices to be present in two - dimensional atmospheric wind data , framing the lagrangian footprints of hurricanes on earth and of the great red spot on jupiter .",
    "the altimetry data used here are available from aviso ( http://aviso.oceanobs.com ) .",
