    "more than two decades ago zuckerman & becklin ( 1987 ) announced the discovery of an ir excess around the daz white dwarf g29@xmath638 .",
    "the white dwarf itself is enriched in metals .",
    "considering the short sedimentation timescales in the photosphere this implies that the star is accreting matter at a relatively high rate ( koester 1997 ) .",
    "since no cool companion has been found at g29@xmath638 , the hypothesis was put forward that a dust cloud around the white dwarf causes the ir excess .",
    "in fact , the presence of dust has been confirmed by _ spitzer",
    "_ observations ( reach 2005 ) . graham ( 1990 ) concluded that the dust is located in the equatorial plane .",
    "subsequently , further daz white dwarfs with potential dust disks were found ( becklin 2005 , kilic 2005 , 2006 ) .",
    "as a possible origin of these disks tidally disrupted comets were discussed ( debes & sigurdsson 2002 ) and , more likely because of the absence of h and he , disrupted asteroids ( jura 2003 ) .",
    "recently , signatures of a gas disk were discovered in sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) spectra of two daz white dwarfs ( gnsicke 2006 , 2007 ) .",
    "the spectra display double - peaked emission lines of the infrared triplet @xmath78498 , 8542 , 8662 .    in the present paper ,",
    "we concentrate on one of these two white dwarfs , namely , because its emission line profiles are more prominent . the white dwarf s atmospheric parameters are = 22020k and = 8.24 . the derived stellar mass @xmath8=0.77@xmath9  and radius @xmath10=0.011@xmath11  are quantities that enter our disk model .",
    "the photospheric magnesium abundance is 0.8 times solar .",
    "the spectrum neither exhibits radial velocity variations nor photometric variability . besides the calcium emission lines",
    "only two other weaker emission features are seen ( @xmath75018 , 5169 ) . in particular , hydrogen and helium emissions are not discovered .",
    "it is concluded that the ca and fe emission lines stem from a metal - rich keplerian disk around a single white dwarf .",
    "the line profiles are double peaked emission lines with a peak - to - peak separation of 630km / s , i.e. , the keplerian rotation velocity is @xmath12=315km / s .",
    "there is a clear violet / red asymmetry in the double - peaked profiles , well known from a similar phenomenon in be star disks that is ascribed to one - armed spiral waves .    from a spectral analysis with a kinematical lte emission model gnsicke ( 2006 )",
    "conclude that we see a geometrically thin , optically thick disk at high inclination ( @xmath13=70@xmath14 ) .",
    "the inner and outer disk radii are @xmath15=0.64@xmath11  and @xmath16=1.2@xmath11 , respectively .",
    "while the outer disk radius is quite sharply confined because of the steep line wings , the value derived for the inner disk radius possibly just marks the inner edge of the line emission region and not the physical inner disk edge , i.e. , @xmath15 could reach down to the white dwarf s surface .",
    "they also conclude that the gas temperature in the disk is around 45005500k .",
    "since the tidal disruption radius for a rocky asteroid at the white dwarf is @xmath0@xmath21.5@xmath11 , it is possible that the material in the gas disk may be a disrupted asteroid whose dust was sublimated by the white dwarf s radiation field .",
    "it seems that  could be the hot counterpart to g29@xmath638 and other cool daz stars harboring dust disks , but in the meantime daz white dwarfs with a dust disk and as hot as  were discovered ( e.g. , jura 2007 ) .",
    "it is our aim to compute a more realistic model for the gas disk around  and we are reporting here very first provisional results .",
    "basically we assume a shakura & sunyaev ( 1973 ) @xmath17-disk model , i.e. , a geometrically thin keplerian disk heated by viscosity . for numerical calculations we employ acdc , our ac__cretion _",
    "_ d__isk _ _ c__ode _ _ that we developed for modeling disks in cataclysmic variables and low - mass x - ray binaries ( nagel 2004 ) .",
    "the code computes a detailed vertical structure and the spectrum of a disk which is being built from radial - symmetric annuli . for any disk annulus",
    "we assume that it radiates like a plane - parallel slab in non - lte , and in radiative and hydrostatic equilibrium .",
    "we are presenting here the results of a single disk ring using different values for the input parameters  ( as a measure for the viscously dissipated energy ) and surface mass density @xmath18 ( the vertical mass column from the disk midplane to the surface ) .",
    "further input parameters , which are kept fixed , are white dwarf s mass and radius as given above , and @xmath15=91r@xmath19 and @xmath20=109r@xmath19 for the inner and outer disk radii , respectively .",
    "the chemical composition is calcium dominated with an admixture of hydrogen with varying h / ca abundance ratios in order to determine the extent of h - deficiency .    the principal problem for any modeling attempt is posed by the question : what heats the emission line region ?",
    "although being hot , it can not be the white dwarf because it is too distant . also , it can not be gravitational energy released through viscosity because the required mass - accretion rate would be @xmath210@xmath21@xmath9/yr which is by many orders of magnitude larger than the accretion rate invoked for the presence of settling metals in daz photospheres ( @xmath210@xmath22@xmath9/yr , koester & wilken 2006 ) .",
    "a speculation by jura ( 2008 ) is additional heating by energy dissipation through disk asymmetries , being driven by some external unseen planet . as mentioned above",
    ", such an asymmetry is obvious from the line profiles .",
    "whatever , at the moment we do not know the heating mechanism .",
    "therefore we need to use  as a free parameter for the disk ring . _ in praxi",
    "_ this means that we set the accretion rate @xmath23 , which is related to  through @xmath24\\,3gm_{\\rm wd}\\dot{m}/8\\sigma\\pi r^3,\\ ] ] to an artificially high value .",

    "_ right : _ a similar effect is seen when the surface mass density @xmath18 decreases .",
    "values for the ring parameters  and @xmath18 are given in the panels .",
    "all profiles are convolved with a 2  fwhm gaussian . ]",
    "the calcium model atom used for the non - lte calculations comprises three ionisation stages , with 7 , 12 , 1 non - lte levels and 3 , 26 , 0 radiative line transitions , respectively . for the disk model calculations we do not account for level fine structure splitting . for the ir triplet",
    "this is done in the final formal solution of the transfer equation by distributing the level populations over the fine structure levels according to their statistical weight .",
    "fig.[grotrian ] is a grotrian diagram of our model ion with all implemented levels and lines , indicating the transition responsible for the observed ir triplet .",
    "energy levels were taken from nist , and oscillator strengths and photoionisation cross - sections from the opacity and iron projects .",
    "electron collisional rates are computed from usual approximation formulae .",
    "rates for collisions with h are currently neglected , probably without consequences .",
    "that is because , first , mashonkina ( 2007 ) have shown that these collisions are unimportant in f / g type stars ( having similar physical conditions in their photospheres ) and , second , we are faced here with a h - deficient environment .",
    "collisions of ca with heavy ions are neglected , too .",
    "their rates are unknown but probably unimportant because of the low thermal velocities of the perturbers . for the spectral lines we assume voigt profiles with radiation damping parameters .",
    "future improvement should include van der waals damping , although we do nt expect it to be important in the disk environment .",
    "the hydrogen model atom is a standard configuration with ten non - lte levels that we use routinely for stellar spectral modeling .",
    "we present first results from disk ring models for , discussing :     the influence of , @xmath18 , and inclination @xmath13 on emergent line profiles of the ir triplet ;     an upper limit for hydrogen content from h@xmath17 ;     the characteristics of one representative model , in particular its vertical structure ;     a comparison of the computed spectrum with observation .      in fig.[fig_teff_sigma ]",

    "the presence of this emission line is clearly confirmed .",
    "it seems , however , that the observed strength is strongly overestimated by our models , a result that also holds for the lte emission models presented by gnsicke .",
    "another remarkable feature of the overall model flux spectrum in fig.[overall_flux ] is the occurrence of two prominent _ emission edges _ at 1219  and 1420 , created by recombination processes into the first and second excited states , respectively .",

    "our models promise that the proposed ( and approved ) hst / cos spectroscopic observation of  by gnsicke and collaborators will deliver an exciting dataset that will allow important conclusions on the chemical composition of the gas disk .      in fig.[fit ] we show a direct comparison of the normalised spectrum of  to three models with different effective temperatures .",
    "this comparison is , however , complicated by the fact that gnsicke ( 2006 ) suggest that the continuous radiation in the vicinity of the triplet stems from the white dwarf alone , while in contrast our models predict a non - negligible contribution by the disk . what we compare in fig.[fit ]",
    "is the observed spectrum normalized to the wd ( + disk ) continuum and the computed disk spectrum alone , normalized to its emission continuum . in any case",
    ", it can be seen that the effective temperature of the disk at  is well constrained by the three models , being @xmath25800k .",
    "the cooler model ( = 5000k ) is perhaps more favorable because of the larger line - to - continuum emission ratio , while the hotter model ( = 6500k ) has the advantage that the relative strengths of the three line components are matched better .",
    "the infrared emission triplet in the spectrum of the daz white dwarf  can be modeled with a geometrically and optically thin , keplerian viscous gas disk ring at a distance of 1.2  @xmath33 from the wd , with @xmath26000k and a low surface mass density @xmath18@xmath20.3g/@xmath3 .",
    "one serious open problem is the unknown disk - heating mechanism .",
    "the disk is hydrogen - deficient ( h@xmath341% by mass ) and it is located within the tidal disruption radius ( @xmath35=1.5@xmath11 ) . if one assumes that the disk reaches down to the wd and that it has uniformly this surface density , then its total mass would be 7@xmath36 g .",
    "a rocky asteroid ( @xmath37=3g/@xmath38 ) with this mass would have a diameter of about 160 km .",
    "an asteroid of this size in our solar system is , e.g. , 22  kalliope .",
    "future work will include other abundant metal species , with a composition appropriate for asteroids .",
    "however , at the moment there are only two lines detected .",
    "real progress for an abundance analysis of the gas disk around  is only possible with future uv spectroscopy .    while the determination of the composition of accreted material from abundance analyses in daz atmospheres is an indirect method that depends on our theoretical knowledge about metal settling timescales , the analysis of the gas disks has the obvious advantage that is a direct composition measurement .",
