    "these observations provide evidence for a first epoch of star formation which is common to the majority of local group dwarf galaxies , both star forming and presently quiescent .",
    "the presence of an old stellar population is still an open question in ngc6822 , the nearest dwarf irregular ( di ) galaxy ( and the closest star - forming galaxy beyond the magellanic clouds ) . based on its luminosity , gas fraction , metallicity , and star formation rate , ngc6822  appears to be a typical , relatively gently star - forming digalaxy .",
    "several studies addressed its star formation history by modeling its color - magnitude diagram ( cmd ) ( see , e.g. , marconi et al .",
    "@xcite ; gallart et al .",
    "@xcite ; wyder @xcite ; and references therein ) .",
    "these studies suggested that ngc6822  most likely began forming stars 12 - 15 gyr ago from low - metallicity gas .",
    "however , the data are not inconsistent with star formation starting 6 - 9 gyr ago from a relatively metal enriched interstellar medium .",
    "the discovery of rr  lyrae  variable stars in ngc6822  presented in this _ letter _ , breaks the uncertainty between these two scenarios by demonstrating the presence of an old ( @xmath2 gyr ) , metal - poor stellar population .",
    "the average magnitude of the newly discovered rr  lyraevariable stars is also used to derive a new estimate of the distance to this galaxy based on a pop .",
    "ii indicator .",
    "time - series imaging of ngc6822  was obtained on 3 half nights on aug .",
    "15 , 16 , and 20 , 2001 using the focal reducer fors2 on the eso vlt / ut3 telescope at cerro paranal , chile .",
    "the standard resolution collimator was used , yielding a @xmath3 arcmin field - of - view with a 2048@xmath4 pixel textronix ccd ( eso # 160 ) , read in 4-port mode with no binning .",
    "the scheduling was devised so as to provide good coverage of the light curves for variable stars with periods between 0.2 and 0.7 days , with optimal efficiency for periods around 0.53 and 0.59 - 0.60 d. the observations consisted of @xmath5  s @xmath6 exposures of a galaxy field located at @xmath7 , @xmath8 ( offset from the center of ngc6822  to avoid regions of active star formation ) .",
    "these data were complemented by 11 @xmath9 and 1 @xmath10 exposures of the same duration .",
    "the nights were all photometric and the seeing varied from 0.5 to 1.0 arcsec , with a median value around 0.7 arcsec .",
    "the fors2 images were reduced in a standard way using the xccdrediraf package .",
    "photometry of all bias - subtracted , flat - fielded images was obtained using allframe(stetson @xcite ) . since",
    "our standard stars were mostly saturated even with the shortest exposure times allowed by the instrument software , the instrumental @xmath11,@xmath12 , and @xmath13 magnitudes were calibrated using the color equations available from the fors web page .",
    "the photometric zero points were then set by comparison with secondary standard stars established in the field using wide field imager observations at the 2.2 m eso / mpi telescope , accurately calibrated onto the landolt ( @xcite ) system ( l. rizzi et al .",
    "2003 , in prep . ) .",
    "the estimated uncertainty of the zero point calibration is 0.04 mag in both @xmath9 and @xmath6 .",
    "candidate variable stars were identified using isis2.1 ( alard @xcite ) , a package specifically designed for the detection of variable stars in crowded fields .",
    "isis is based on an optimal image subtraction technique .",
    "the variable star detection procedure consists of the following steps : ( i ) geometric alignment of the image series and re - mapping of each image to the same grid ; ( ii ) construction of a reference image obtained by stacking a subset of images ; ( iii ) subtraction of each individual frame from the reference image convolved with a suitable kernel to match seeing variations and geometrical distortions on the individual images ; ( iv ) photometry of the variable objects on the difference images , in terms of differential fluxes .",
    "the search performed by isis on this image yielded a master list of 448 candidate variable stars .",
    "candidate variable stars were then counter - identified on the allframe  @xmath9,@xmath6 master catalogue , where about 2/3 of the objects flagged by isis as variable sources were found .",
    "all stars in the candidate master list were then analyzed to confirm their variable star nature and derive light curves .",
    "for the analysis , we combined the time series obtained from allframe  photometry ( whenever available ) and from isis differential flux measurements . in this _ letter _",
    ", given our primary interest in rr  lyrae  variable stars , only stars with mean magnitude fainter than @xmath14 are discussed .",
    "a full census of the variable stars identified in ngc6822  will be given in a forthcoming paper ( e. v. held et al .",
    "2003 , in prep . ) .    for the period search we used the program gratis  ( graphical analyzer of time series : see clementini et al .",
    "@xcite for details ) , which was run on the isis differential flux data converted to magnitude scale . whenever multiple periods appeared equally compatible with the data ,",
    "the star was omitted from the present `` best sample '' .",
    "the light curves were finally calibrated to the standard photometric system by modeling the color variation along the cycle .",
    "the sampling of the @xmath9 data points , although sparser than that of the @xmath6 observations , is sufficient to constrain the model color curves quite well .",
    "among the 84  candidates in the faint sample considered in this _ letter _ , 43have well sampled light curves in both @xmath6 and @xmath9 , and a scatter about the light curve model not larger than 0.1 mag .",
    "this restricted sample was found to includes 17 rr  lyrae , 20 brighter short - period variable stars with very similar period distributions , and 6 further variables among which some binary systems and some possible @xmath15 cephei stars .    for the classification of the faint sample of variable stars we took into account the mean luminosity and color of the stars , and the period , amplitude , and shape of the light curve .",
    "based on these characteristics our sample was found to include rr  lyrae  stars and brighter stars pulsating both in the fundamental mode ( the vast majority ) and in the first overtone .",
    "the mean period of the 15  @xmath16-type rr  lyrae  variable stars with the best defined light curves is @xmath17  @xmath18 , where the uncertainty is the stardard error on the mean .",
    "figure  [ f_lcurves ] shows some examples of the @xmath6 and @xmath9 light curves of variable stars discovered in ngc6822 .",
    "labels in each panel give the identifier , period , amplitude and intensity - averaged magnitude ( @xmath6 and @xmath9 ) of each variable star .",
    "the left panels show typical light curves of rr  lyrae  variable stars , both fundamental mode ( top and middle ) and first overtone pulsators ( @xmath19-type rr  lyrae , bottom panel ) .",
    "the light curves on the right panels refer to some of the numerous pulsating stars that have been discovered in ngc6822 .",
    "these variables are brighter than the rr  lyrae  stars and have on average smaller amplitudes at a given period . because of their characteristics these stars appear related to both the short - period population i cepheids found in dwarf irregular galaxies ( dolphin et al .",
    "@xcite , @xcite , @xcite ; sharpee et al .",
    "@xcite ) and the anomalous cepheidspopulation in dwarf spheroidal galaxies ( e.g. , nemec , nemec , & lutz @xcite ; bersier & wood @xcite ) .",
    "the first two light curves ( top and middle right panels ) have asymmetric shape similar to @xmath16-type rr  lyrae  stars , however they have lower amplitudes by about a factor of two , and the mean magnitudes , calculated from the average of the light curves , are about 0.4 to 1 mag brighter .",
    "the curve on the last right panel , has a sinusoidal shape similar to @xmath19-type pulsators , yet its mean magnitude , about 1.4 mag brighter than the rr  lyrae  stars , clearly qualifies this star as a cepheid .",
    "the location of the faint variable star sample in the color - magnitude diagram of ngc6822  is shown in fig .",

    "variable stars with complete light curves and good photometry have been plotted , using their intensity - averaged magnitudes and colors .",
    "different symbols have been used for rr  lyraestars and more luminous short - period variable stars .",
    "since no hb could be identified even from hst data ( wyder @xcite ) , our detection of rr  lyrae  stars provides _ the first indisputable evidence for the presence of an old population in ngc6822_. in fact , while the hb itself is completely hidden by the overwhelming number of young and intermediate - age stars that populate the same region of the diagram , the position of the rr  lyrae  variable stars agrees well with the hb level and the instability strip in the galactic cluster m3 ( corwin & carney @xcite ) , shifted to the distance and reddening of ngc6822 .",
    "we adopted the foreground reddening @xmath20  0.25  from the maps of schlegel , finkbeiner , & davis ( @xcite ) , with no account for internal reddening .",
    "the scatter of the data on the red side of the instability strip is probably due to incomplete phase coverage of the light curves .",
    "in addition to rr  lyrae  stars , a continuous distribution of short - period variable stars is shown in fig .",

    "figure  [ f_pav ] shows the period - amplitude relation for the faint variable stars detected in ngc6822   ( namely rr  lyrae  and short - period variables fainter than @xmath6=23 ) for which complete light curves have been obtained .    in several dwarf spheroidal galaxies of the local group ( leo  ii , leo  i , draco )",
    ", rr  lyrae  stars span a wide range in pulsational properties , suggesting a classification intemediate between the oosterhoff  i and ii groups ( oosterhoff @xcite ) of galactic globular clusters ( siegel & majewski @xcite ; held et al .",
    "@xcite ; kinemuchi et al .",
    "@xcite ) . in ngc6822 ,",
    "the period and amplitude distributions seem more biased towards an oosterhoff  i type , similarly to rr  lyrae  stars in sculptor ( kaluzny et al .",

    "@xcite ) and and  vi ( pritzl et al .",
    "@xcite ) , although a composite distribution is not ruled out by our data . indeed , the rr  lyrae  sample in fig .",
    "[ f_pav ] is subject to several biases both because rr  lyrae  stars are found close to limiting magnitude of our photometry , and because of the short baseline of our observations .    what is the nature of the small - amplitude , short - period variable stars found in ngc6822   at luminosities only a few tenths of a magnitude brighter than the rr  lyrae  stars ? to the best of our knowledge , cepheids with such low luminosities ( llc ) , small amplitudes , and short periods ( see fig .",
    "[ f_pav ] ) have not been found before in any dwarf irregular galaxy , although they are consistent with the predictions of theoretical pulsational models ( fiorentino et al .",
    "@xcite ; f. caputo et al .",

    "given the extended star - formation history of ngc6822 , these llc are likely to originate from a population of intermediate - age , metal - poor he - burning stars younger and more massive than the rr  lyrae  stars .",
    "the brighter variable stars appear more similar to the short - period cepheids found in other dwarf irregular galaxies ( e.g. , dolphin et al .",
    "a full discussion of the characteristics of this population of short - period variable stars , in particular the llc , is postponed to a forthcoming paper ( e.  v.  held et al .",
    "2003 , in prep . ) .",
    "the mean metallicity of rr  lyrae  stars in ngc6822can be estimated using the relation between the mean period and metallicity of @xmath16-type rr  lyrae  stars derived by sandage ( @xcite ) for variable stars in galactic globular clusters ( ggcs ) , @xmath22 } -0.389 $ ] . from the average period of the @xmath16-type rr  lyrae  stars with well - defined light curves , we derived [ fe / h]@xmath23@xmath24 , where the error includes the standard deviation of the measurements , obtained by error propagation from the scatter of the period distribution , and uncertainties due to detection efficiency and possible systematics if rr  lyrae  in ngc6822  are younger than those in ggcs .",
    "this value is in remarkable agreement with the low metal abundance measured for an old globular cluster in ngc6822  ( cohen & blakeslee @xcite ; chandar , bianchi , & ford @xcite ) , and represents the first estimate of the metallicity of the old `` field '' stellar population in ngc6822 .",
    "this value is only slightly more metal - poor than the metal abundance inferred for rgb stars ( [ fe / h]@xmath25 : gallart , aparicio , & vilchez @xcite ; @xmath26 } < -0.5 $ ] : tolstoy et al .",

    "these assumptions yield @xmath34  0.50  for ngc6822  and a distance modulus @xmath0  @xmath1 .",
    "the error includes both the systematic error on the photometry zero point and the uncertainty of the mean apparent and absolute magnitude of ngc6822  rr  lyrae  stars , but does not take into account the contribution of possible internal differential reddening .",
