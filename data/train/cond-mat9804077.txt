    "in order to lead to an effective attraction between electrons , the electron - phonon interaction has to overcome the strong electron - electron repulsion . for conventional superconductors retardation effects",
    "strongly reduce the coulomb repulsion @xcite .",
    "the resulting effective interaction is described by the dimensionless coulomb pseudopotential @xmath0 . in the above sense",
    ", the alkali - doped fullerides are non - conventional superconductors , since for them retardation effects are very inefficient in reducing the coulomb repulsion @xcite .",
    "one can , however , conceive an alternative mechanism for reducing @xmath0 : within the random phase approximation ( rpa ) the coulomb interaction is strongly reduced by the very efficient dielectric screening @xcite .",
    "it is not clear , however , how well the random phase approximation describes the screening in the alkali - doped fullerides .",
    "rpa works well in the limit of weak interaction , while in the opposite limit it is qualitatively wrong .",
    "very little is known about the screening in the intermediate region , where interaction and kinetic energy are comparable .",
    "this is the region where the superconducting fullerides , being close to a mott transition , lie .    to find out how well rpa works for the alkali - doped fullerides , we have studied the static screening of a test charge in a hubbard - like model using quantum monte carlo methods .",
    "our results indicate that rpa gives a surprisingly accurate description of the static screening on the metallic side of a mott transition .",
    "to describe the conduction electrons in a@xmath1c@xmath2 we use the multi - band hubbard - like hamiltonian @xmath3 the indices @xmath4 , @xmath5 label the sites of the fcc lattice , @xmath6 denoting nearest neighbors .",
    "each c@xmath2-molecule randomly takes one of two orientations @xcite .",
    "the hopping matrix elements @xmath7 between the three - fold degenerate @xmath8 orbitals on neighboring sites are obtained from a tight - binding parameterization @xcite .",
    "the hubbard interaction @xmath9 is varied to study the effect of correlations .",
    "experimental estimates give @xmath10 @xcite .    to study the static screening , we introduce a test charge @xmath11 on a site @xmath12 .",
    "the corresponding term in the hamiltonian is @xmath13 we can then find the response of the system upon introduction of the test charge by comparing the electron density @xmath14 on site @xmath12 for the system with the test charge , to the electron density @xmath15 for the unperturbed system : @xmath16 .",
    "we determine the ground state properties of the hamiltonians @xmath17 and @xmath18 ( for finite fcc clusters ) using diffusion monte carlo with the fixed - node approximation @xcite . in this method",
    "we construct a trial wave function @xmath19 and allow it to diffuse towards the exact ( within the fixed node approximation ) solution @xmath20 .",
    "for the trial function , we make a generalized gutzwiller ansatz : @xmath21 .",
    "@xmath22 is the slater determinant calculated using the random phase approximation .",
    "the gutzwiller factors reflect the two interaction terms , where for a given configuration @xmath23 of the electrons @xmath24 and @xmath25 .",
    "we optimize the free parameters @xmath26 and @xmath27 using a correlated sampling technique .",
    "diffusion monte carlo only provides us with the mixed estimator @xmath28 of an observable @xmath29 .",
    "if , however , the trial function @xmath19 is close to the ground state , we can estimate the ground state expectation value using the extrapolated estimator @xmath30 the last term , the expectation value of the observable for the trial function , is easily calculated using variational monte carlo . to make sure that the extrapolated estimator gives reliable results ,",
    "we have compared our monte carlo calculations with the results from the exact diagonalization for small systems . for larger systems , where exact diagonalization is not possible ,",
    "we have checked that the trial function is close to the ground state wave function .",
    "we have calculated the screening charge @xmath31 for finite clusters of different size . for a given test charge ,",
    "all calculations give similar results . as an example , fig .",
    "[ screen ] shows the screening of a test charge @xmath32 as a function of the hubbard interaction @xmath9 for a cluster of 32 molecules .",
    "looking at the results from the quantum monte carlo calculations , we can distinguish two qualitatively different regions . for weakly interacting systems ( @xmath33 small )",
    "the screening is very good , while it breaks down completely for large @xmath33 , where the system is a mott insulator .",
    "rpa somewhat underestimates the screening for @xmath34 @xcite . for intermediate values of @xmath33",
    "it works surprisingly well and actually remains rather accurate almost all the way up to the mott transition",
    ". beyond this point rpa becomes qualitatively wrong .",
    "the failure of the rpa in the strongly interaction regime can be easily understood . in rpa",
    "it only costs kinetic energy to screen the test charge . since in the strongly interacting region @xmath35",
    "is small , the cost in kinetic energy is small compared to the interaction with the test charge .",
    "therefore , when a test charge is put on some site , rpa predicts that almost the same amount of electronic charge leaves that site in order to minimize the interaction with the test charge .",
    "such a calculation neglects , however , the fact that in a strongly correlated system the electrons that leave the site with the test charge have to pay a large correlation energy . in the qmc calculations",
    "this is taken into account properly , leading to the observed breakdown in the screening for large @xmath33 .",
    "the gradual decrease in the efficiency of the screening just before the mott transition that can be seen in fig .  [ screen ] suggests a mechanism for understanding the anomalous behavior of nh@xmath1k@xmath1c@xmath2 . at normal pressure",
    "this system is an insulator . under pressure",
    "it becomes superconducting , with @xmath36 increasing with pressure @xcite .",
    "this is in contrast to the other alkali - doped fullerides , where @xmath36 drops with pressure . as pressure",
    "is applied to the mott insulator , @xmath33 decreases and the screening becomes more and more efficient , reducing the effective coulomb interaction @xmath0 , i.e. increasing @xmath36 . as @xmath33 further decreases , the screening saturates .",
    "now the reduction of the electron - phonon interaction ( because of the decreasing density of states ) dominates , and the standard behavior of the alkali - doped fullerides is recovered .    to summarize , our results indicate that rpa is surprisingly accurate almost all the way up to the mott transition . since retardation effects are inefficient , this has important implications for the superconductivity in the alkali - doped fullerides .",
