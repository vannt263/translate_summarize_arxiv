    "this is the second part of a two - part article , aimed at the investigation of a very general class of measurements , relevant to experiments performed both in cognitive science and physics . although the present article is written in a self - consistent way , and",
    "therefore can be read independently of the content of its first part @xcite , the lecture of the latter is recommended .",
    "we also refer the reader to the first article for a general discussion of the relevance of quantum structures in the macro world , and in particular in the field of psychology and cognitive science , referred to meanwhile commonly as ` quantum cognition ' @xcite .    in @xcite ,",
    "we have initially introduced and analyzed a model , that we have called the _ uniform tension - reduction _ ( utr ) model , allowing to represent probabilities associated with all possible one - measurement situations , and we have used it to explain the emergence of quantum probabilities ( the born rule ) as _ uniform _ fluctuations on the measurement situation .",
    "the particularity of the utr - model is to exploit the geometry of simplexes to represent the states both of the measured and measuring entities , in a way that the outcome probabilities can be derived as the ( uniform ) lebesgue measure of suitably defined convex subregions of the simplex under consideration .    in @xcite , we have also shown that , although the utr - model is an abstract construct , it admits physical realizations , and we have proposed a very simple and evocative one , using a material point particle which is acted upon by special elastic membranes , which by breaking and collapsing are able to produce the different possible outcomes .",
    "this easy to visualize mechanical realization allowed us to gain considerable insight into the hidden structure of a measurement process , be it that associated with a cognitive measurement , on a conceptual entity ( or in the ambit of a decision process ) , or a physics measurement , on a microscopic entity .",
    "for instance , thanks to it , it becomes possible to visualize the structural difference between measurements performed on entangled entities ( combinations of concepts , of elementary `` particles , '' etc . ) , as opposed to measurements performed on separate entities , in terms of a dimensional change in the measurement context , whose increased level of potentiality requires higher dimensional membranes to be described .    always in the first part of this two - part article , we have considered a further generalization of the utr - model , by considering conditions of lack of knowledge which can be associated with _ non - uniform _ fluctuations , in what we have called the _ general tension - reduction _ ( gtr ) model . in this more general theoretical framework , we have introduced and motivated a notion of _ universal measurement _ , which describes the most general possible condition of lack of knowledge in a measurement , and we have pointed out that the uniform fluctuations characterizing quantum measurements can also be understood as an average over all possible forms of non - uniform fluctuations , which can in principle be actualized in a measurement context .    the main purpose of this second part of the article is to present the formal proof of the theorem establishing the correspondence between universal measurements and uniform measurements .",
    "since the quantum mechanical born rule can be described in terms of uniform fluctuations , it follows from this result that quantum measurements can be interpreted as universal measurements , i.e. , as measurements describing situations which are uniform mixtures of different possible measurement situations , thus defining a condition of lack of knowledge not only about the interaction which is each time actualized , between the measured entity and the measured system , but also about the way such interaction is chosen , among all the possible ways of choosing it .",
    "of course , this does nt mean that quantum measurements , performed on microscopic entities like electrons , neutrons , protons , etc .",
    ", would necessarily be universal measurements . for the time being , this remains an open question . what we know , however , is that the huge average involved in a universal measurement is perfectly compatible with this interpretation .",
    "hence , we have proven that the hypothesis that a quantum measurement is a universal measurement can be true , and hence , since the way in which probability arises and is intrinsic in a universal measurement can be understood intuitively and completely , in case this hypothesis is true , it entails a deep explanation of the nature of a quantum measurement .    for cognitive measurements",
    "the situation is different .",
    "indeed , a typical experiment in cognitive science usually involves different human subjects who , because of the specificities and uniqueness of their mind structures , will necessarily have different ways of choosing the possible answers to the questions that are addressed to them , or will have different ways of deciding when facing situations requiring a decision process .",
    "therefore , their actions will be in principle characterized by different sets of probabilities for the different outcomes . in other terms , if we consider the ensemble of the participants in a given experiment , we can say that the overall statistics of outcomes they deliver is the result of an average over different kinds of measurements .",
    "this not only because each subject would choose / decide according to different criteria , but also because even a same subject can choose according to different criteria in two different moments .",
    "this means that a model where the probabilities associated with the different possible outcomes , obtained from the answers collected from the different subjects , are considered as averages over the different probabilities associated with the different measurements performed by each of them , is a model that corresponds well to the situation we imagine to occur .",
    "so , in cognitive science , if we want to be adherent to what can readily be supposed to actually happen during an experiment , modelizing a measurement situation in the form of a meta - measurement , i.e. , in a way that the statistics of outcomes results from a process of randomization over different individual measurements , is a plausible approach .",
    "this is precisely what the gtr - model allows to do , describing the different possible measurements by means of different probability densities @xmath0 , which are subsequently averaged out in what we have called a universal measurement .",
    "considering the above , it is clear that the result of the equivalence between universal measurements and uniform measurements acquires a different meaning in quantum physics and cognitive science . in quantum physics",
    "it has more the value of an explanation of the nature of quantum probabilities .",
    "it suggests that the level of potentiality inherent in a microphysical quantum process is possibly much deeper than it was initially hypothesized in the so - called _ hidden measurement approach _",
    "@xcite , as it would concern not only the process of actualization of single measurement interactions , but of entire ways of choosing these interactions .    for the cognitive ambit",
    ", it predicts the existence of a ` first order theory , ' which may be equal to the orthodox quantum theory , but can also be different from it , but can in any case be formulated using a uniform probability density @xmath1 , in what we have called the utr - model .",
    "this possible difference between orthodox quantum mechanics and the ` first order theory ' describing cognitive measurements , would manifest at the level of the structure of the set of states of the conceptual entities , which is not necessarily hilbertian .",
    "if it will turn out to be hilbertian , as apparently is the case for the microphysical entities , then cognitive measurements , understood as universal measurements , will also turn out to be equivalent to quantum measurements , in the sense that not only the probabilities of single measurements , but also of sequential and conditional measurements , will produce the same values as those predicted by the born rule . on the other hand ,",
    "if it will turn out not to be hilbertian , considering however the effectiveness of so many quantum models of cognition and decision ( and the proof of the equivalence between universal and uniform measurements presented in this article ) , we might nevertheless expect the theory behind such models of cognition and decision to be quite close to quantum theory . also because we already know that cognitive measurements do reveal the presence of typical quantum effects of interference , contextuality , entanglement and emergence @xcite , when concepts in different possible states are combined and data of experiments with human subjects on such combinations of concepts are modeled . but this of course does not mean that all these effects necessarily originate from a strict hilbertian structure for the set of states .",
    "for instance , as emphasized in @xcite , one does nt need linearity to model entanglement .",
    "it is worth emphasizing that to be able to identify what is the probability model which is behind cognitive measurements ( assuming that a single explanatory model can consistently describe all possible data ) , one needs a sufficiently general theoretical framework to integrate and analyze not only the existing data , but also , and more importantly , the data that will become available in the future .",
    "here it is important to distinguish ` ad hoc mathematical models , ' constructed only with the purpose of fitting data , from more ` fundamental models , ' which try to identify , in a more stringent way , the basic structure which is really behind the collected data , as well as its possible significance . in physics , for instance ,",
    "one usually speaks of ` phenomenological models , ' which just organize mathematically the results of the observed phenomena without paying too much attention to their possible significance , as opposed to more deep ` explanatory models , ' which instead try to understand the observed phenomena at a more fundamental level , possibly deriving them from first principles .    the gtr - model , and the proposed notion of _ universal measurement _",
    ", is precisely a first step towards the construction of a more fundamental and explanatory model , able not only to phenomenologically account for the different data , but also to possibly explain their origin .",
    "the theorem that we prove in the present article , can be considered as an attempt of constructing cognitive models starting also from first principles . here",
    "the first principle we advocate is that a cognitive measurement is essentially an averaged measurement ( described in the gtr - model by the different @xmath0 characterizing the different ways of choosing the outcomes ) , and that if the average involves a sufficiently large set of data , then a ` first order theory ' will emerge , which is described by a simpler structure in which probabilities are obtained in terms of the uniform lebesgue measure ( the utr - model ) .",
    "it is worth mentioning that the gtr - model , contrary to the classical kolmogorovian model , has the advantage of also allowing for a representation of the states of the entity under consideration ( be it conceptual , or physical ) , as points in a simplex .",
    "also the hilbert - model , of course , allows for a representation of the states , but it imposes them , from the start , a very specific ( hilbertian ) structure . in cognitive science , however , as we previously mentioned , we havent yet determined what is the structure of the set of states . to determine that structure",
    ", one needs to go beyond the analysis of single - measurement situations , and collect data from which also conditional and/or sequential probabilities can be deduced .",
    "however , these data will not be analyzable within the too limited structure of the hilbert - model , but will require the more ample framework of the utr - model ( which is not necessarily linear ) or of the gtr - model ( which is not necessarily uniform ) .",
    "let us also mention another advantage of the gtr - model : the fact that , similarly to the hilbert - model , it contains a procedure for forming joint ( possibly entangled ) entities , by simply multiplying the dimension of the real spaces describing the single entities @xcite , but , different from the hilbert - model , it does so without the hypothesis of linearity .",
    "this possibility is of course absent in classical kolmogorovian models , which by the way are also incapable of describing measurement processes which change the state of the measured entity ( which is the typical situation both in microphysics and cognitive sciences ) .",
    "all the above advantages will certainly prove to be instrumental in future works , aimed at clarifying the ( possibly non - hilbertian ) structure of the set of states of human conceptual entities .",
    "in addition to the description of the gtr - model , and the proof of the equivalence between universal and uniform measurements , we shall also discuss in this second part of the article the important notion of ` _ _ robustness _ _ of a measurement , ' showing that universal measurements correspond to maximally _ robust _ indeterministic reproducible experiments .",
    "this characteristic being also shared by quantum measurements , as evidenced in the recent analysis of @xcite , the result not only increases the plausibility that quantum measurements are also universal measurements , but provides a further explanation of their success in describing different fields of investigations .",
    "the work is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ quantum probabilities for a single observable ] , we present some basic elements of the quantum formalism , to define notations and to allow to easily establish , in the subsequent sections , the correspondence between quantum measurements and the measurement described in the gtr - model , when the probability density @xmath0 is uniform . in sec .  [ therhomodel ] , we introduce the gtr - model and recall that in the uniform case it becomes isomorphic to the hilbert - model of quantum mechanics , when the states describing the entity under investigation come from a hilbert space .",
    "then , in sec",
    ".  [ theorem ] , we define the fundamental notion of _ universal measurement _ and enunciate the theorem establishing the equivalence between universal and uniform measurements .    to prove the theorem , we proceed with the following steps . in sec .",
    "[ limit of cellular structures ] , we discretize the gtr - model and show that one can always consider limits of cellular probability densities to approximate , with arbitrary precision , the probabilities obtained from arbitrary , non - cellular , probability densities .",
    "this will allow us to consider , in sec .  [ averaging over finite cellular structures ] , the average over all possible kinds of measurements , focusing our analysis on discretized structures , proving in this way the theorem .    finally , in sec .",
    "[ robustness ] , we study the notion of _ robustness _ , and show that universal measurements are maximally robust , and in sec .",
    "[ conclusion ] we offer some conclusive remarks .",
    "in this section we present the basic formalism of quantum mechanics , in relation to the measurement of a finite dimensional observable . not to unnecessarily complicate the discussion , we shall limit ourselves , throughout the article , to the situation of a non - degenerate measurement , associated with a non - degenerate observable .",
    "all the results we shall obtain can be easily generalized to the degenerate case , proceeding as shown in @xcite .    in orthodox quantum theory ,",
    "the state of an entity ( for a physicist it can be a microscopic entity , like an neutron , for a cognitive scientist , a concept , or a situation apt for a decision process ) is described by a unit vector of a vector space over the field @xmath2 of complex numbers  the so - called hilbert space @xmath3  equipped with a ( sesquilinear ) inner product @xmath4 , which maps two vectors @xmath5 , @xmath6 to a complex number @xmath7 , and consequently with a norm @xmath8 , which assigns a positive length to each vector . in this paper",
    "we only consider hilbert spaces having a finite number of dimensions , and we denote @xmath9 a hilbert space whose vectors are @xmath10-dimensional .    an observable is a measurable quantity of the entity under consideration , and in quantum theory is represented by a self - adjoint operator @xmath11 , acting on vectors of the hilbert space , i.e. , @xmath12 . in our case , being the hilbert space @xmath10-dimensional , @xmath11 can be entirely described by means of its @xmath10 eigenvectors @xmath13 and the associated ( real ) eigenvalues @xmath14 , obeying the eigenvalue relations @xmath15 , for all @xmath16 .",
    "if the eigenvectors have been duly normalized , so that in addition to the orthogonality relation @xmath17 , @xmath18 , they also obey the completeness relation @xmath19 , where @xmath20 denotes the unit operator , they can be used to construct the orthogonal projections @xmath21 , @xmath22 , obeying @xmath23 , @xmath24 , @xmath18 , which in turn can be used to write the observable @xmath11 as the ( spectral ) sum : @xmath25a=\\sum_{i\\in i_{n } } a_i p_i.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    similarly , if @xmath26 , @xmath27 , is a normalized vector describing the state of the entity , it can be written as the sum : @xmath28 in the polar form @xmath29 . clearly , being @xmath6 normalized to @xmath30 , the positive real numbers @xmath31 must obey : @xmath32    when we measure an observable @xmath11 in a practical experiment ( a physicist does so by letting the microscopic entity interact with a macroscopic measuring apparatus , a psychologist by letting a human concept interact with a human mind , according to a certain protocol , if concepts are studied , or by collecting the decision results , if situations lending themselves to human decisions are studied ) , we can obtain one of the @xmath10 eigenvalues @xmath14 , @xmath22 , and if these @xmath10 eigenvalues are all different , we say that the spectrum of @xmath11 is _ non - degenerate_. consequently , the measurement has @xmath10 distinguishable possible outcomes .    in general terms",
    ", the measurement of an observable @xmath11 is a process during which the state of the entity undergoes an abrupt transition  called `` collapse '' in the quantum jargon  passing from the initial state @xmath6 to a final state which is one of the eigenvectors @xmath13 of @xmath11 , associated with the eigenvalue @xmath14 , @xmath22 .",
    "the process is non - deterministic , and we can only describe it in probabilistic terms , by means of a `` golden rule '' called the _ born rule _ , which states the following : the probability @xmath33 for the transition @xmath34 , is given by the square of the length of the vector @xmath35 , i.e. , the square of the length of the initial vector , once it has been projected onto the eigenspace of @xmath11 corresponding to the eigenvalue @xmath14 .",
    "more explicitly : @xmath36 for all @xmath22 .",
    "and of course , following ( [ sumofthexi ] ) , we have @xmath37",
    "in this section we present the gtr - model , which is able to describe very general situations of measurement , characterized by an arbitrary ( finite ) number of outcomes . to facilitate the understanding of its logic , we present the model as an idealized mechanical model .",
    "this , however , must not mislead us : the gtr - model is an abstract construct , totally independent of its possible physical realizations .",
    "these very general measurement situations include those associated with classical , almost deterministic measurements , when the outcomes are fully predictable ( if the state of the entity is known ) , but also , more generally , those associated with quantum - like measurements , when the outcomes are most of the times genuinely unpredictable , but nevertheless characterizable in probabilistic terms .",
    "the construction of the model draws its inspiration from a previous two - outcome model , called the _ sphere - model _ ( see sec .  [ averaging over finite cellular structures ] ) , which in turn is a generalization of the so - called @xmath38__-model _ _ , originally designed to study two - state systems , like spin-@xmath39 quantum entities , and their generalizations @xcite .",
    "the gtr - model has many interesting features .",
    "it generalizes the sphere - model , allowing for the description of measurements having an arbitrary number of outcomes , and it offers a considerable insight into the internal working of quantum and quantum - like systems , as it allows for a full visualization of what goes on during a measurement .",
    "the paradigm at the basis of its operation is that of the _ hidden - measurement approach _",
    "@xcite , where the emergence of quantum structures is explained as the consequence of the presence of fluctuations in the measurement context . in this approach , the indeterminism inherent in quantum and quantum - like systems is due to the fact that a measurement is made of different possible _ pure measurements _ ( almost deterministic interactions ) , which can be actualized in an unpredictable way during the execution of the experiment .",
    "these pure measurements are hidden in the sense that a physicist , when experimenting with microscopic entities , can not distinguish them at the macroscopic level .",
    "similarly , in cognitive experiments , they are hidden because they are actualized at the subconscious level , via `` non - logical '' intrapsychic processes , which can not be discriminated at the conscious level .",
    "the great explanatory power of the gtr - model resides precisely in the fact that these hidden aspects of a measurement process are made fully manifest , so that one can really `` see '' what is going on , during its execution .",
    "another interesting aspect of the gtr - model is that it can describe all sorts of probabilistic models , generally non - kolmogorovian and non - hilbertian @xcite , and thanks to the very general theoretical framework it provides , it can be exploited to reveal an even more hidden aspect which is possibly at the basis of quantum probability , and which can explain its `` unreasonable '' success in the description of so many kinds of measurement situations , in different layers of reality .",
    "this hidden aspect is the fact that quantum measurements turn out to be interpretable as processes of randomization not only over deterministic ",
    "pure measurement ",
    "interactions , but also , and more generally , over all possible kinds of measurements . in other terms , as we will demonstrate in the next sections , the gtr - model allows to explain quantum measurements as _ universal measurements _",
    ", i.e. , as measurements expressing a much deeper level of actualization of potential elements of reality .",
    "to explain the functioning of the model , we proceed step by step , describing first the two - outcome situation ( @xmath40 ) , then the three - outcomes situation ( @xmath41 ) , and finally the general situation , with an arbitrary number of outcomes . as we said in the previous section , we shall limit our discussion to non - degenerate measurements , and refer to @xcite for the description of the degenerate situation .",
    "is uniform .",
    "however , the same description holds , mutatis mutandis , for the non - uniform case . ] +   + _ the @xmath40 case , with two outcomes _ + we consider a material point particle living in a euclidean space @xmath42 , @xmath43 .",
    "measurements , which will be denoted @xmath44 , can only have two outcomes .",
    "the procedure to follow to perform @xmath44 is the following .",
    "the experimenter takes a sticky breakable elastic band of the @xmath0-kind ( what this means will be explained shortly ) , and stretches it over a @xmath30-dimensional simplex @xmath45 , generated by two orthonormal vectors @xmath46 and @xmath47 .",
    "once the @xmath0-elastic band is in place , the particle , by moving deterministically towards it ( along a trajectory that is not important here to specify ) , sticks to it at a particular point @xmath48 , @xmath49 , defining the state of the particle on the elastic ( we represent euclidean vectors in bold ) .",
    "when this happens , two disjoint regions @xmath50 and @xmath51 can be distinguished , which are respectively the region bounded by vectors @xmath52 and @xmath53 , and the region bounded by vectors @xmath53 and @xmath46 ( see fig .  [ 1-dimensions ] ) .",
    "then , after some time , as it is made of a breakable material , the @xmath0-elastic inevitably breaks , at some a priori unpredictable point . if @xmath54 , the band , by contracting , draws the particle to point @xmath46 ( the `` collapse process '' depicted in fig .",
    "[ 1-dimensionsbreaking ] ) , whereas if @xmath55 , it draws the particle to point @xmath52 .",
    "we can observe that to each breaking point , it corresponds a specific interaction between the particle and the elastic band , which deterministically draws the former to its final state @xmath46 , or @xmath52 . in other terms , the measurement @xmath44 is formed by a collection of hidden _ pure measurements _",
    ", i.e. , potential , almost deterministic measurement interactions , only one of which is each time selected ( actualized ) , when the elastic breaks .",
    "these pure measurements are _ almost _ deterministic because if @xmath56 , then the interaction remains indeterminate , in the classical sense of a system in a condition of unstable equilibrium .",
    "to calculate the probabilities of the two possible outcomes , one needs to know what is the physical mechanism governing the breaking of the elastic structure .",
    "it is possible to imagine elastics that break in an infinite number of different ways , depending on their nature and the manner in which they were manufactured . in general terms",
    ", we can assume that each different elastic band can be characterized by a probability density @xmath57 , describing the probabilities for the elastic of breaking in the different regions of @xmath45 .",
    "accordingly , the probability @xmath58 for a @xmath0-elastic ( i.e. , an elastic characterized by the probability density @xmath0 ) to break in the region @xmath59 , @xmath60 , is given by the integral : @xmath61 and of course : @xmath62    now , since the particle is drawn to @xmath63 when the elastic breaks in @xmath59 , the probability @xmath64 for the transition @xmath65 , is precisely the probability @xmath58 for the elastic to break in @xmath59 , so that we can write : @xmath66 to obtain more explicit expressions , we observe that @xmath67 , so that the first integral in ( [ probability-2-outcomes ] ) can be written as the double integral : @xmath68 and since @xmath69 , we can introduce the new variables : @xmath70 so that the double integral ( [ x1integralbis ] ) transforms into the single integral : @xmath71 where we have defined the one - dimensional probability density : @xmath72 .",
    "an important special case is that of a uniform probability density @xmath1 , describing an elastic band made of a perfectly uniform material ( so that all its segments have the same chance of breaking ) .",
    "since @xmath45 has length @xmath73 , @xmath74 , and ( [ x1integral - z ] ) becomes : @xmath75 in other terms , in accordance with the analysis of the utr - model presented in @xcite , we obtain a result in agreement with the born rule ( [ born ] ) , i.e. , the uniform measurement @xmath76 is isomorphic to the measurement of an observable @xmath11 in a two - dimensional complex hilbert space @xmath77 , if we represent the quantum state vector @xmath78 , whose components give the probabilities for the transitions @xmath79 and @xmath80 ( once their square modulus is taken ) , and to that quantum state vector we associate a real vector @xmath81 , in the 1-simplex @xmath45 , whose components give these same probabilities for the corresponding transitions @xmath82 and @xmath83 ( see sec .",

    "more precisely , we can distinguish four different typologies of measurements : @xmath85 , @xmath86 , @xmath87 and @xmath88 .",
    "we shall only consider the first one , which corresponds to the situation where all three outcomes can be distinguished by the experimenter ( non - degenerate measurement ) , and refer the reader to @xcite , for the description of the other degenerate situations , where not all outcomes can be distinguished .    the procedure to follow to perform @xmath85 is the following .",

    "once the membrane is detached from the two above mentioned anchor points , being elastic , it contracts toward the remaining anchor point @xmath52 , drawing in this way the point particle , which is attached to it , to the same final position ( see fig .",
    "[ breakingprocess ] ) .",
    "similarly , if @xmath54 , the final state of the particle is @xmath46 , and if @xmath97 , the final state of the particle is @xmath96 .    as for the previous description of the one - dimensional elastic band , we can observe that to each breaking point @xmath98 , it corresponds a specific interaction between the particle and the elastic membrane , almost deterministically drawing the former to its final state . in other terms , the measurement @xmath85 is formed by a collection of _ pure measurements _",

    "the probability of such process is : @xmath136 and exploiting the fact that @xmath137 , we can perform a suitable change of variables ( i.e. , of basis in @xmath138 ) to transform the above @xmath10-variables integral into a @xmath121-variables integral : @xmath139 where the constant variable is @xmath140 .",

    "the gtr - model immediately suggests the possibility of considering a much more general typology of measurement , expressing a deeper level of potentiality .",
    "indeed , a measurement @xmath120 is a conditional measurement , i.e. , a measurements whose outcomes are conditional to the specific choice made for the probability density @xmath0 .",
    "however , it is natural to assume that in many measurement situations the probability density @xmath0 is not given a priori , but randomly selected within the infinite ensemble of all possible @xmath0 .",

    "we thus need to modelize a measurement situation which consists in a meta - measurement , such that the statistics of outcomes are also the result of a process of randomization over different probability densities @xmath0 .",

    "therefore , we have : @xmath313 where @xmath314 is the characteristic function of @xmath315 .    to study the robustness of the @xmath38-universal measurement , we consider a state @xmath316 , very close to @xmath125 , and want to compare the transition probabilities of these two states : @xmath317 where @xmath318 is the convex region associated with state @xmath319 . as we said , we assume that the experimenter is able to vary its level of control over the measurement , by varying the parameter @xmath38 , i.e. , by varying the size of the unbreakable region @xmath303 .",
    "we also assume that , by adjusting the control parameter @xmath38 , the experimenter tries to maximize the robustness of the measurement , that is , to minimize the variation of the probabilities with respect to a small variation @xmath320 of the state .    a way to do this is to let @xmath321 .",
    "depending on how @xmath322 , this will give rise to either classical ( almost ) deterministic processes , or to solipsistic - like processes .",
    "for instance , if @xmath323 , with @xmath324 a @xmath121-ball of volume @xmath325 contained in @xmath122 , centered in , then @xmath326 , as @xmath321 , which corresponds to a purely deterministic process .",
    "probabilities will then either be @xmath196 or @xmath30 , and will typically remain constant when the state @xmath125 is slightly varied ( the only possible variations being of course when @xmath125 crosses the boundaries of the region @xmath327 containing , causing the probabilities to abruptly shift from @xmath196 to @xmath30 , or vice versa , passing through a point of unstable equilibrium ) .    similarly , considering a more general situation where , say , @xmath328 , with the @xmath329 that are now balls of volume @xmath330 , we have in this case @xmath331 , as @xmath321 , which corresponds to a mixed condition describing , for certain states , a deterministic process , and for others a solipsistic one . but also in this case probabilities will remain constant , for small variations of almost all states @xmath125 .",
    "so , we can say that the regime @xmath321 exhibits robustness in a trivial way , considering that probabilities become constant in this limit .",
    "there is however a more interesting regime , exhibiting robustness in a non trivial way . indeed , observing that the parameter @xmath38 is at the denominator of the fraction in ( [ difference ] ) , it is clear that if we increase @xmath38 , the ratio will decrease . regarding the second factor in ( [ difference ] ) , considering that the lebesgue measure of @xmath303 tends to 0",
    "as @xmath38 tends to 1 , it is natural to assume that there exist a @xmath332 such that , for @xmath333 , a same portion of @xmath303 will be contained in @xmath334 and @xmath327 .",
    "accordingly , the difference of the two integrals in ( [ difference ] ) will become independent of @xmath38 , for @xmath333 , and be equal to @xmath335 , so that for @xmath333 , we obtain : @xmath336 and clearly the most robust condition ( i.e. , the smoothest possible variation of the probabilities ) is obtained by letting @xmath337 .",
    "in other terms , in accordance with the recent analysis of @xcite , we find that universal measurements , like quantum measurements , correspond to measurements for which the frequencies of the observed outcomes are maximally robust with respect to small variations of the state of the system , i.e. , with respect to small variations in the conditions under which the measurements are carried out .",
    "this allows us to further characterize universal measurements as measurements in which the experimenter exerts the least possible control , letting all the randomness naturally present in the experimental context freely manifest ; or , to put it in an equivalent way , they correspond to measurements dealing with that `` immanent '' randomness which remains after all forms of control have been subtracted , i.e. , all attempts to decrease randomness have been subtracted , by whatever means .",
    "this is typically what happens when dealing with microscopic entities , since we are not usually in a position to control what happens at the level of the hidden interactions , when performing measurements on these entities , and therefore reduce the randomness contained in them .",
    "of course , this does nt mean that such randomness will necessarily always be an unavoidable ingredient of every quantum measurement .",
    "indeed , one can think that , by means of more sophisticated experimental protocols , it may become possible in the future to push away at least part of it .",
    "just to give an example , so - called minimally - disturbing implementations of von - neumann measurements , using the formalism of positive operator valued measures @xcite , could constitute a possibility in that direction .",
    "of course , the same holds true in measurements with human subjects .",
    "indeed , it is in principle always possible to exploit a deeper understanding of the working of the human mind to design protocols where the questions addressed to the subjects become less interrogative , and more determinative .",
    "mind control techniques used to favor certain reactions from a person , for instance in the ambit of selling , precisely do that .",
    "think how an experienced seller can monitor the customer s face and manner , in real time , so as to find the exact moment to place a certain suggestion , to have a higher probability of producing a certain response .",
    "it is important however to emphasize that when an experimenter increases her / his level of control in a certain experiment , be it a psychological experiment or a physical one , in a way or another s / he will have to alter the experimental protocol . and by doing so , s / he may end up affecting the nature of the observed properties , as properties are operational quantities , that is , quantities defined by means of specific operations specifying how they have to be tested ( i.e. , observed ) , and if we change these operations ( for instance to reduce randomness ) we may end up changing the very ( operational ) definition of the properties under observation ( for a discussion of this point , see @xcite ) .",
    "in addition to that , when we try to acquire more control , the risk is to also obtain measurements containing lesser information about the state of the measured entity in comparison to that of the state of the measuring system . indeed ,",
    "as shown in the bayesian - like analysis of @xcite , pure quantum measurements can also be characterized as experiments in which the observer ( i.e. , the measuring system ) actively attempts to minimize her / his influence on the produced outcomes .",
    "this of course is fully compatible with our characterization of quantum measurements as universal measurements , in which the observer is precisely in a condition of maximal lack of knowledge about the measurement taking place . indeed ,",
    "maximal lack of knowledge also means maximal lack of control , and maximal lack of control means minimal influence over the observed entity .",
    "to conclude , in this second part of the article we have continued our analysis of the gtr - model , emphasizing its broad structural versatility in the description of measurements which are not necessarily characterized by a hilbertian probability model .",
    "we have then used the model to rigorously prove the equivalence between universal measurements and measurements characterized by uniform probability densities @xmath1 ( the utr - model ) , which in turn are compatible with the predictions of the born rule , whenever the states of the entity under investigation comes from a hilbert space .    to define the universal average characterizing universal measurements ,",
    "we have followed the traditional way of dealing with high levels of randomness present in nature , like in the analysis of brownian motions , considering first a discretization of the problem .",
    "more precisely , by approximating general @xmath0-hypermembranes as limit of finite cellular structures , we have succeeded in defining in a mathematically precise and physically transparent way the fundamental notion of _ universal measurement _ , describing situations where the lack of knowledge is double , i.e. , not only about the specific ( almost deterministic ) hidden interactions which are actualized during an experiment , but also about how such interactions are each time selected .    as an additional element of characterization of universal measurements",
    ", we have also modelized the situation in which an experimenter decides to take some active control over the randomness present in a given measurement context , by making certain hidden interactions unavailable .",
    "this active control ( which corresponds to an acquisition of knowledge ) produces experiments whose statistics are less robust with respect to small variations of the initial conditions , which explains why experimenters will have the tendency to increase the universality of their measurements , i.e. , to increase the reach of the averages that are possibly subtended by their measurements .",
    "this means that a condition of lowest possible control , i.e. , lowest possible knowledge regarding the nature of the measurement which is each time conducted , is the most favorable one in terms of the reproducibility of the obtained statistics of outcomes .",
    "we conclude by observing that the notion of universal measurement opens to different possibilities regarding the way we should interpret and collect data in future cognitive studies , and it is the plan of the present authors to elaborate further this notion , both theoretically and experimentally , with the aim of increasing further our understanding of the fundamental probabilistic structure underlying human cognition and decision",
