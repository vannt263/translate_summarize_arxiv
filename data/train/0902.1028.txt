    "the study of glueballs is an active domain of hadronic physics , both experimentally and theoretically .",
    "much experimental effort has been devoted to the identification of a clear glueball signal , but no unambiguous candidate has been found up to now  @xcite .",
    "it is nevertheless generally accepted that a state with a dominant glueball component should be present among the many known @xmath1 resonances  @xcite . from a theoretical point of view , a remarkable achievement has been the computation of the glueball spectrum thanks to lattice qcd calculations  @xcite .",
    "many works have since been devoted to the understanding of this spectrum within different frameworks : coulomb gauge qcd  @xcite , ads / qcd duality  @xcite , potential models  @xcite , _ etc _  see also ref .",
    "@xcite for a review .    in potential models ,",
    "there are two basic ingredients .",
    "first , one assumes that glueballs are bound states of constituent gluons .",
    "second , one introduces an interaction potential that aims to describe at best the qcd interactions .",
    "let us discuss these two points .    as it is shown in ref .",
    "@xcite , the structure of the whole lattice qcd glueball spectrum can be understood by assuming that a particular @xmath2 glueball can be labeled by a given number of _ transverse _ ( helicity-1 ) constituent gluons .",
    "the low - lying @xmath3 ( @xmath4 ) states are then seen as mainly two- ( three- ) gluon states .",
    "the problem of using longitudinal ( spin-1 ) constituent gluons is that light @xmath5states are then present in the spectrum , in disagreement with lattice qcd  @xcite . however , if transverse constituent gluons are used , the spurious states disappear  @xcite , and a simple potential model ( two - body spinless salpeter hamiltonian with funnel potential @xmath6 ) becomes able to reproduce with accuracy the results of lattice qcd in the @xmath3 sector  @xcite . even if the transversality is assumed , the value of the gluon mass is still a matter of discussion .",
    "there are works in the spirit of refs .",
    "@xcite arguing that a constituent gluon is massless at the level of the confining hamiltonian ( zero bare mass ) but then gains a constituent mass because of its confinement into a glueball . in this picture , the constituent gluon is _ a posteriori _ massive and its constituent mass is typically given by @xmath7 ",
    "notice that the same argument would apply for @xmath8 and @xmath9 quarks . in ref .",
    "@xcite for example , the constituent gluon mass is computed to be around 300  mev .",
    "other studies  @xcite rather state that a constituent gluon is _ a priori _ massive , that is with a nonzero bare mass .",
    "the underlying idea is roughly that the nonperturbative effects of qcd cause a mass term to appear in the gluon propagator . in the present work , motivated by the results of refs .",
    "@xcite , we will only focus on the case where the constituent gluons have a vanishing bare mass .",
    "the potential term remains to be chosen .",
    "the potential energy between a heavy quark - antiquark pair has been accurately computed in lattice qcd and exhibits a clear funnel shape at the dominant order  @xcite , supplemented with the usual fermi - breit relativistic corrections  @xcite .",
    "the potential energy between two static sources in color octet ( static gluons ) has also been computed in lattice qcd ; it is still compatible with a funnel form , for different values of the parameters because static gluons are color - octet sources rather than triplet ones  @xcite .",
    "but , constituent gluons should be seen as relativistic particles and one can wonder if such a static potential is relevant to describe glueballs . we have recently proposed in ref .  @xcite a new method to extract the effective potential between two  physical \" gluons ( in opposition with static ones ) from lattice qcd .",
    "the starting point is that not only glueball masses can be computed on the lattice , but also glueball wave functions , especially in the scalar channel  @xcite . assuming that the scalar glueball is a bound state of two constituent gluons , the inverse problem can be solved , _",
    "i.e. _ to compute the effective potential corresponding to the lattice qcd glueball mass and wave function from a spinless salpeter - type hamiltonian .",
    "we have given a detailed resolution of this problem in ref .",
    "@xcite , but longitudinal constituent gluons were used .",
    "motivated by the results of refs .",
    "@xcite favoring transverse constituent gluons , we propose in the present work to reconsider the calculations of ref .",
    "@xcite and see whether the effective potential that emerges is compatible with a funnel one or not in the case of transverse constituent gluons .",
    "our paper is organized as follows .",
    "we first recall the lattice qcd data that we have at our disposal in sec .",
    ". then we discuss the expected form of a hamiltonian describing a bound state of two transverse gluons in sec .",
    "[ hami ] and we focus on the scalar channel , for which reliable lattice data are currently available . in sec .",
    "[ numres ] we numerically compute the effective gluon - gluon potential and comment its compatibility with a standard funnel form and with the set of parameters used in ref .",
    "@xcite . finally , we draw some conclusions in sec .",
    "[ conclu ] .",
    "general field - theoretical arguments have been invoked to prove that the lightest glueball is a scalar one , _",
    "i.e. _ with quantum numbers @xmath10  @xcite",
    ". this feature has been confirmed by several lattice qcd studies , where the most recent determination of the @xmath10 glueball mass is around @xmath11  gev  @xcite .",
    "glueball masses are not the only observables that can be obtained within the framework of lattice qcd : wave functions can also be computed .",
    "a first determination of glueball radial wave functions in the scalar and tensor channels has been made in ref .",
    "@xcite within su(2 ) lattice qcd simulations , while an su(3 ) generalization of these results has been given in ref .",
    "@xcite . in this last reference",
    ", it is found that @xmath12 in agreement with ref .",
    "it can be checked in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] that the lattice radial glueball wave function in the scalar channel is well fitted by the following expression  @xcite @xmath13,\\ ] ] @xmath14 these results have been confirmed in the more recent work  @xcite .",
    "notice that @xmath15 has been here normalized in such a way that @xmath16 so that the plot is clearer in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , but the particular normalization of the wave function is irrelevant for the computations that we make in the following .    as it is argued in ref .",
    "@xcite , the lattice wave function  ( [ fit ] ) can be seen as the bethe - salpeter wave function of a stationary scalar state made of two constituent gluons , in the rest frame of the system .",
    "it is thus relevant to identify the lattice wave functions of refs .",
    "@xcite with the schrdinger - like wave functions of two - gluon bound states .",
    "we refer the reader to ref .",
    "@xcite for a detailed discussion of that point .",
    "the problem we want to solve in this work is to find a hamiltonian @xmath17 such that @xmath18 where @xmath15 and @xmath19 come from lattice qcd , as recalled in the previous section .",
    "since there are strong evidences supporting the identification of the lowest - lying scalar gluleball as a mainly two - gluon bound state  @xcite , we choose for @xmath17 a standard two - body spinless salpeter form , i.e. @xmath20 we assume the constituent gluons to be transverse and massless as in ref .",
    "@xcite and the potential @xmath21 to be local and radial .",
    "note also that @xmath22 .    once the radial quantum number @xmath23 and the matrix element of the square orbital angular momentum @xmath24 are specified ( @xmath25 here since we deal with the ground state ) , the only unknown quantity in eq .",
    "( [ eigen ] ) is the local central potential @xmath21 .",
    "as we will show in the next section , such a particular inverse problem can be numerically solved with accuracy .",
    "but , before making explicit calculations , one has to wonder about the value of @xmath24 . in our previous work",
    "@xcite , we considered , as it is the case in most of the potential models , that the constituent gluons were longitudinal . in this case , the lowest - lying scalar glueball is a @xmath26 state in spectroscopic notation , thus with @xmath27 and @xmath28 .",
    "however , this assumption neglects the fact that constituent gluons should actually be transverse .",
    "we showed in ref .",
    "@xcite that a proper inclusion of the gluon s helicity can be performed within the helicity formalism , first presented in ref .",
    "the results are then considerably improved : the spectrum that is found is in better agreement with lattice qcd , and spurious states due to longitudinal degrees of freedom disappear . following the helicity formalism , the unique scalar glueball state corresponds to the quantum state  @xcite @xmath29 for which it is readily found that @xmath30 .",
    "notice that the unique pseudoscalar state is simply @xmath31  @xcite , with also @xmath32 .",
    "it is worth pointing out that the particular form of  ( [ scala ] ) is model - independent : only the requirement that the total spin @xmath33 and @xmath34 are good quantum numbers and that the gluons are transverse is needed to build the spin - angular part of the various two - gluon helicity states from the general formalism of ref .",
    "@xcite .    in summary ,",
    "once transverse constituent gluons are assumed , the problem that remains to be solved is the inverse problem corresponding to hamiltonian  ( [ hamdef ] ) in the scalar channel , that is @xmath35 one could have thought that , since explicitly spin - dependent terms are only present at the level of the relativistic corrections , the transversality of the constituent gluons would not strongly affect the features of the system .",
    "however , the difference between spin-1 and helicity-1 gluons dramatically affects the hamiltonian of the system even at the dominant order , because @xmath24 is equal to 2 instead of 0 .",
    "several numerical methods exist to compute the equivalent local potential from a given wave function and its corresponding energy but , to our knowledge , only the lagrange mesh method is able to make accurately such computations with a semirelativistic kinematics of the form @xmath36  @xcite .",
    "we refer the reader to refs .",
    "@xcite for further elements about this numerical technique , but nevertheless recall the main points for self - completeness .    in the case of radial equations ,",
    "a lagrange mesh is formed of @xmath37 mesh points @xmath38 which are the zeros of the laguerre polynomial @xmath39 of degree @xmath37 ( here @xmath40 ) . the lagrange basis is then given by a set of @xmath37 regularized orthonormalized lagrange functions satisfying the condition @xmath41 .",
    "these functions can be expressed in terms of @xmath39 .",
    "the matrix elements @xmath42 of the operator @xmath36 , depending on @xmath24 , can be accurately computed in this basis . moreover , for a local radial potential , one has @xmath43 in the lagrange basis , with @xmath44 an appropriate scale parameter .",
    "it is readily checked that this nice feature allows to rewrite eq .",
    "( [ eigen ] ) as @xmath45 $ ] , thus to solve the inverse problem by computing the potential at the mesh points  @xcite . in our case , both @xmath19 and @xmath46 are known thanks to the lattice results  ( [ p1 ] ) and ( [ fit ] ) .    formally , the numerical determination of @xmath21 in eq .",
    "( [ eigen ] ) is identical to the one performed in ref .",
    "the crucial difference however is that @xmath32 this time and not zero as in ref .",
    "@xcite . the potential obtained by using the optimal values of @xmath19 , @xmath47 , and @xmath48",
    "is plotted in fig .",
    "it exhibits a confining long - range part , and a quickly decreasing short - range part .",
    "the errors on these three parameters [ see eqs .",
    "( [ p1 ] ) and ( [ p2 ] ) ] allow the  true \" potential to be located between two extremal curves , within the shaded area of fig .",
    "it can clearly be observed that the optimal potential obtained in ref .",
    "@xcite , that is with longitudinal gluons , is different from the new one even if the error bars are included .",
    "again , it should be stressed that the use of transverse gluons considerably affects the physical features of the two - gluon system .",
    "these numerical results are qualitatively compatible with a funnel potential of the form @xmath49 in this expression , @xmath50 is the strong coupling constant , @xmath51 is the fundamental quark - antiquark flux tube energy density , and @xmath52 indicates the scaling of the energy density , which is different for a gluon - gluon system or a quark - antiquark pair .",
    "several approaches support the casimir scaling hypothesis , _ i.e. _",
    "@xmath53  @xcite .",
    "the constant @xmath54 can be used to fit the height of potential  ( [ corn ] ) on the numerically computed optimal potential .",
    "instead of fitting the parameters of potential  ( [ corn ] ) on our numerical results , we find more interesting to check if they are in agreement with the potential of ref .",
    "@xcite , that leads to a nice agreement with lattice qcd in the @xmath3 sector .",
    "this last potential is such that @xmath55 we argued in ref .",
    "@xcite that this particular value of @xmath54 actually comes from instanton - induced forces in glueballs , that roughly contribute to the mass as @xmath56  @xcite .",
    "a look at fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] shows that the funnel potential  ( [ corn ] ) with the parameters  ( [ params ] ) is compatible with the numerically computed potential .",
    "we notice that the @xmath10 mass we find by solving hamiltonian  ( [ hamdef ] ) with @xmath57 and with the parameters  ( [ params ] ) is @xmath58  gev , in agreement with the glueball mass  ( [ p1 ] ) .",
    "in this work , we have computed the effective potential between two transverse , massless , constituent gluons from the mass and wave function of the @xmath10 glueball obtained in lattice qcd .",
    "we followed the method described in ref .",
    "@xcite , but this time the helicity of the constituent gluons has been taken into account . the numerically computed potential is compatible with a funnel form with the values of the parameters that we used in ref .",
    "@xcite to reproduce at best all the low - lying @xmath3 glueballs ( not only the scalar one ) .",
    "the present results thus draw a bridge between lattice qcd and potential models , and show how physical informations about the relevant effective potential to use can be derived from lattice qcd , especially in the light hadron sector .",
    "a negative constant is needed to lower the funnel potential to the value that is numerically computed .",
    "such a negative constant has been argued to come from instanton - induced interactions in glueballs in ref .",
    "it would be very interesting to have at our disposal the glueball wave function in the @xmath59 channel since in this case the instanton - induced mass term is expected to be positive .",
    "thus we should have @xmath60  gev in the pseudoscalar case , the other parameters being unchanged .",
    "moreover , in the other channels ( the tensor one in particular ) , one would expect @xmath61 .",
    "new accurate lattice qcd simulations could be very useful to check this point .",
    "finally , let us make some comments about the tensor glueball , for which a wave function has also been computed in refs .  @xcite .",
    "if constituent gluons were spin-1 particles , the lowest - lying @xmath62 state would be a @xmath63 one , and its wave function should be qualitatively similar to the one of the @xmath10 glueball , since both states would have @xmath27 .",
    "with helicity-1 gluons however , @xmath64 in the tensor channel  @xcite , and the wave function should thus be qualitatively different from the one of the scalar glueball .",
    "the data of ref .",
    "@xcite are unfortunately not accurate enough to make a definitive comparison between the scalar and tensor glueball wave functions , although their behavior seems to be rather different .",
    "we hope that new data will be available in the future , in order to further check the relevance of the transverse gluon picture .",
