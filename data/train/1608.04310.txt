    "in rare earth compounds , the interplay between strong magnetic anisotropy and exchange interaction can often result in complex phase diagrams .",

    "similar 2-fold modulation was observed for other systems when this rotating sample stage was utilized@xcite .    given that our experience has been that when a system has enough cef splitting to manifest extreme planar anisotropy , it also manifests clear in - plane anisotropy in magnetic field@xcite , these results require additional study .",
    "one possible , extrinsic cause of the coexistent of a strong planar and a weak in - plane magnetic anisotropy is a random twinning or crystalline domain formation such that the in - plane crystalline orientation is close to polycrystalline .",
    "this scenario was ruled out by conducting laue measurements on different locations of the same crystal of sample at different depths ( achieved by polishing ) .",

    "( b ) shows expanded views on the two lowest lying cef levels with applied field in different directions . ]    in searching for an in - plane state - clock model system , one needs a mixture of low - lying cef states , which are well separated from higher - lying cef states .",
    "in addition , in - plane magnetic anisotropy requires a very subtle balance between cef effect , internal magnetic field and applied magnetic field .",
    "for example , decreasing the energy difference between low - lying states will increase the relative strength of a given applied magnetic field . in the case of dymg@xmath10cu@xmath11 , by reducing the splitting between of the three lower - lying doublets ( @xmath56 , @xmath60 , @xmath73 ) from 40 k to 10 k , a nearly ideal 6-state - clock state like that shown by green solid line in fig .",

    ", the 3 lowest - lying cef levels in fact only have a span of @xmath14 10 k and nearly 90 k away from higher cef levels .",
    "this condition favors a clock - state - model at a moderate , reachable applied magnetic field as observed@xcite .",
    "however , angular - dependent magnetization data at different magnetic fields have not been measured on honi@xmath10b@xmath10c , nor on other 4-state - clock model systems@xcite , which would be helpful to investigate the effect of this interplay between cef and magnetic field on in - plane magnetic anisotropy .",
    "single crystals of @xmath0mg@xmath10cu@xmath11 ( @xmath0= y , ce - nd , gd - dy , yb ) have been synthesized using a high - temperature solution growth technique and characterized by magnetization , resistivity and specific heat measurements .",
    "ymg@xmath10cu@xmath11 is non - magnetic .",
    "ce is trivalent in cemg@xmath10cu@xmath11 .",
    "it undergoes two magnetic transitions at 2.1 and 1.5 k respectively .",
    "prmg@xmath10cu@xmath11 does not order down to 0.5 k and appears to have a non - magnetic singlet ground state based on temperature - dependent magnetization and specific heat data .",
    "yb is divalent , and therefore non - moment - bearing , in ybmg@xmath10cu@xmath11 .",
    "all the other local - moment - bearing members order antiferromagnetically at low - temperature .",
    "the ordering temperature of tbmg@xmath10cu@xmath11 ( 11.9 k ) is higher than that found in gdmg@xmath10cu@xmath11 ( 9.7 k ) , indicating a deviation from de gennes scaling .",
    "magnetic anisotropies were observed for @xmath0mg@xmath10cu@xmath11 ( @xmath0 = ce - nd , tb , dy ) with all of them showing a @xmath74 in their paramagnetic states .",
    "angular - dependent magnetization was studied in more detail for tbmg@xmath10cu@xmath11 and dymg@xmath10cu@xmath11 .",
    "even though they have a strong planar magnetization , their in - plane magnetic anisotropy is small and field - dependent .",
    "this phenomena can be explained by single ion cef effect where the laboratory magnetic field is not large enough to observe a clear clock - state given the cef splitting . to observe an in - plane state - clock - model at low applied magnetic fields ,",
    "the lower - lying cef levels that can give rise to a large in - plane magnetization , as compared to out - of - plane magnetization , need to be relatively closely spaced in temperature and well separated from the higher - lying levels .",
    "such a condition was met in the case of honi@xmath10b@xmath10c .",
