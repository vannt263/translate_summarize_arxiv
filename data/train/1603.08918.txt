    "a thorough analysis of solar energetic particle ( sep ) events provides crucial information on particle scattering and transport in the interplanetary medium as well as understanding of their acceleration mechanisms @xcite . some solar flares and eruptive events , such as coronal mass ejections ( cmes ) ,",

    "high - energy particles , mostly protons and @xmath0-particles , of extra - solar origin known as galactic cosmic rays ( gcr ) constantly hit the earth atmosphere .",
    "they induce a complicated atmospheric nuclear ",
    "muon cascade ( see @xcite and references therein ) . occasionally the energy of seps is large enough ( @xmath1 1 gev / nucleon ) to initiate a similar atmospheric cascade leading to an enhancement of count rate of ground - based detectors , specifically neutron monitors ( nms ) .",
    "this special class of sep events is called ground - level enhancements ( gles ) .",
    "the worldwide network of nms ( _ e.g_. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) represents a multi - instrumental tool for continuous monitoring of the intensity of cr particles as well as the registration of gles @xcite .",
    "the nm stations are spread over the globe at multiple geographic locations in order to obtain a complete picture of cosmic rays in space , since their intensity is not uniform around the earth @xcite .",
    "this is particularly important for gles , which possess an essential anisotropic part , specifically during the event s onset @xcite .",
    "therefore , measurements performed by the worldwide network of nms form the basis to assess the spectral and angular characteristics of seps near earth . in addition , it was recently shown that spectral and angular characteristics of seps derived using nm data are model dependent @xcite , mainly due to assumed nm yield function(s ) , magnetospheric model(s ) ( for details see @xcite ) . in this study",
    "we use an established method for the analysis of gles based on nm data but applying a newly computed neutron monitor yield function @xcite .",
    "we study two major events , namely gle 59 on 14 july 2000 and gle 70 on 13 december 2006 .",
    "in order to derive the seps characteristics , it is necessary to establish a relationship between nm count rates and the primary particle flux , considering the full complexity of particle transport in the geomagnetosphere and in the earth atmosphere @xcite .",
    "a convenient formalism for relation between nm count rate and primary particle flux is based on yield function ( for details see _ e.g. _ * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) . in this study",
    ", we use a recently computed nm yield function , which considers the finite lateral extent of cosmic ray induced atmospheric cascade and provides good agreement with experimental latitude surveys @xcite .",
    "an analysis of gles based on nm data consists of several consecutive steps : determination of asymptotic viewing cones of the nms by computation of particle trajectories in a model magnetosphere ; assumption of an initial guess of the inverse problem ; application of an optimization procedure ( inverse method ) for derivation of the primary seps energy spectrum , anisotropy axis direction and pitch angle distribution .",
    "a detailed description of the method is given elsewhere @xcite .",
    "the method is similar to that used by @xcite .",
    "the relative count rate increase of a given nm can be expressed as :    @xmath2    where @xmath3 is the rigidity spectrum of the primary solar particles in the direction of the maximal flux , @xmath4 is the rigidity spectrum of gcr at given time @xmath5 with the corresponding modulation , y(p ) is the nm yield function , @xmath6 is the pitch angle distribution of seps , @xmath7 is the count rate due to gcr , @xmath8 is the count rate increase due to solar particles , @xmath9 is the minimum rigidity cut - off of the station , accordingly @xmath10 is the maximum rigidity of seps considered in the model , assumed to be 20 gv , which is sufficiently high for seps .",
    "the fractional increase of the count rate of a nm station represents the ratio between the nm count rates due to seps and gcr averaged over 2 hours before the event s onset . in our model",
    "we assume a modified power law rigidity spectrum of sep similarly to @xcite :    @xmath11    where @xmath12 is particle flux arriving from the sun along the axis of symmetry whose direction is defined by geographic coordinate angles @xmath13 and @xmath14 , @xmath15 is the power - law spectral exponent at rigidity p = 1 gv , @xmath16 is the rate of the spectrum steepening .",
    "the pitch angle distribution is assumed to be a gaussian :    @xmath17    where @xmath0 is the pitch angle , @xmath18 is parameter corresponding to the width of the pitch angle distribution .",
    "the pitch angle is defined as the angle between the asymptotic direction and the axis of anisotropy . therefore according to equations ( 1 ) to ( 3 )",
    "six parameters have to be determined : @xmath19 , @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath13 and @xmath14 , @xmath18 .    in our study , for the computation of rigidity cut - offs and asymptotic directions of the allowed trajectories",
    "@xcite we use the combination of international geomagnetic reference field ( igrf ) geomagnetic model ( epoch 2010 ) as the internal field model @xcite and the tsyganenko 89 model as external field @xcite .",
    "this combination provides the most efficient computation of asymptotic directions as well as a balance between simplicity and realism @xcite .",
    "all computations of particle s transport in the geomagnetic field are performed with the magnetocosmics code @xcite .    for the gcr spectrum",
    "we apply a parametrisation based on the force - field model @xcite .",
    "full details of the application of the model are given elsewhere @xcite .",
    "the solar modulation parameter is taken from @xcite .",
    "for the solution of the inverse problem we use the levenberg - marquardt algorithm ( lma ) @xcite with the minpack code @xcite .",
    "the optimization is performed by minimization of the difference between the modelled nm responses and the measured nm responses _ i.e. _ optimization of the functional @xmath20 over the vector of unknowns and @xmath21 nm stations :    @xmath22^{2 } , \\label{simp_eqn4}\\ ] ]",
    "in total 16 gles were observed during the solar cycle 23 @xcite .",
    "the strongest event , namely gle 69 on 20 january 2005 was analysed elsewhere @xcite . here",
    "we focus on two major events : gle 59 on 14 july 2000 also known as the bastille day event and gle 70 on 13 december 2006 .",
    "the second decade of july 2000 was characterized by intense solar activity extending from 10 to 15 of july . during this period three x - class flares ( including the bastille day flare ) and two halo cmes were produced @xcite .",
    "the gle 59 event was related to the bastille day x5.8/3b solar flare and the associated full halo cme .",
    "it started at 10:03 ut , reached peak at 10:24 ut and ended at 10:43 ut @xcite .",
    "accordingly , the gle onset began between 10:30 and 10:35 ut at several stations ( figure 1 ) .",
    "the strongest nm increases were observed at the south pole ( 58.3 @xmath23 ) and sanae ( 54.4 @xmath23 ) compared to pre - increase levels . in general the event was characterized by a large anisotropy in its initial phase @xcite .",
    "an illustration of several computed asymptotic cones used for our analysis is shown in figure 2 .",
    "the full list of nms used in this analysis is given below ( table 3 ) .",
    "the computations were carried out with the magnetocosmics code using tsyganenko 1989 ( external field model ) and international geomagnetic reference field ( igrf ) ( internal field model ) geomagnetic models , adjusted to the measured @xmath24 index and 2000 epoch . here",

    "the asymptotic directions of polar nms are plotted with solid lines , while mid - latitude nms are plotted with dashed lines . ]    for the analysis we considered 5-min nm data retrieved from gle database @xcite .",
    "the derived rigidity spectra with the anisotropy characteristics of the high - energy sep are presented in figure 3 . during the event s onset , seps had a hard rigidity spectrum and strong anisotropy as it was observed by nm stations with small pitch - angles .",
    "the left - hand panel of figure 3 demonstrates the obtained rigidity spectrum during various stages of the event .",
    "the corresponding pitch angle distributions are presented in the right - hand panel of figure 3 .",
    "one can see that the rigidity spectrum was gradually softening throughout the event .",
    "the steepening @xmath16 varied throughout the event .",
    "it resulted in a moderate steepening of the spectrum during the early phase and only a slight steepening during the late phase of the event .",
    "moreover , @xmath16 vanished after 13:00 ut so that the derived rigidity spectra can be described by a pure power law .",
    "the derived anisotropy was high during the event s onset .",
    "it rapidly dropped to a low , relatively steady level so that the seps angular distribution considerably broadened out after the initial phase of the event .",
    "we can conclude that the event was isotropised very fast , leading to a nearly isotropic sep flux after 11:00 ut .",
    "the derived spectral and anisotropy characteristics are summarized in table 1 .    the quality of the modelling is demonstrated by comparison between the modelled and observed responses of nms during the gle 59 . here we present a comparison for several nm stations ( figure 4 ) , but the quality of the fit is similar for the other nm stations . since there is no dramatic change of the derived sep characteristics after 11:00 ut ( gradual softening of the rigidity spectrum and isotropic phase ) , in order to present detailed information throughout the whole event , the x axis ( time ) in figure 4 is not uniform .",
    "a detailed analysis of confidence limits of the derived model parameters is rather difficult , because of strong non - linearity and complexity of the model as well as a significant correlation between the fit parameters @xcite .",
    "we examine the squared difference between the observed and calculated increases .",
    "we achieve less than 5 @xmath23 relative difference between modelled and observed nm relative increases .",
    "note that in the analysis we employed a natural initial guess similarly to @xcite , _",
    "i.e. _ that the apparent source position is located along the interplanetary magnetic field ( imf ) line derived from the ace satellite measurements ( otherwise the initial guess is similar to that of @xcite ) .",
    "according to our analysis a small variation of the input ( initial guess ) does not alter the solution . in case when the initial guess is far from the local minimum ( the lma converges to the global minimum only if the initial guess is close to the final solution @xcite ) , the derived solution of the inverse problem possess greater residual compared to that with a natural initial guess or it is not physical .     is according to equation ( 2 ) _",
    "i.e. _ flux arriving from the sun along the axis of symmetry .",
    "time ( ut ) refers to the end of the corresponding five minute interval .",
    "the solid line in the left panel denote gcr flux . ]    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "the two major events gle 59 and gle 70 considered for study in this work occurred at different solar activity conditions .",
    "they were also quite different in increase profiles .",
    "the gle 70 depicted a very sharp impulsive - type increase , while gle 59 had a wider time profile typical for gradual events .",
    "this feature may be explained by the position of the flare at the solar disk @xcite .",
    "the events were characterized by relatively strong anisotropy during the initial phase , which decreased rapidly over the following 30 minutes for gle 59 , accordingly 50 - 60 minutes for gle 70 .",
    "the strong anisotropy of seps during both event onsets indicates focused transport conditions in the interplanetary medium .",
    "in addition , we studied the likelihood of bidirectional arrival of seps , namely by modelling the nm response assuming a two flux event and a complicated shape of pitch angle distribution ( see @xcite ) similarly to @xcite who found a clear signature of bidirectional flux for the gle 69 on 20 january 2005 . in this case analysis",
    "we found no evidence of particles arriving from other but sunward directions .",
    "the rapid increase of nm response of stations in the antisunward direction such as tixie for gle 59 is most - likely due to scattering processes @xcite .",
    "the particle fluences ( rigidity , time and angle integrated particle flux ) of both events are compared ( figure 9a ) .",
    "the particle fluence during the bastille day event is greater than during the gle 70 event .",
    "this is consistent with recent findings based on both satellite - borne and nms data analysis @xcite .",
    "the fluence during bastille day event is compared with recent estimations ( figure 9b ) @xcite .",
    "the observed discrepancy is most likely due to different reconstruction methods and model assumptions . in @xcite a simplified analysis of nm data is used and different spectral shape , namely band function is employed .",
    "a reasonable agreement is achieved for gle 70 event ( figure 9c ) .",
    "in addition , on figure 9c is compared the particle fluence using the reconstructions by @xcite , where a discrepancy in particle fluence is observed , but not in derived rigidity spectra .        in the work presented here",
    ", we performed a detailed modelling of spectral and angular characteristics of high energy seps in the vicinity of earth during the the bastille day 2000 ( gle 59 ) event and gle 70 on 13 december 2006 .",
    "the cr particles are the main source of ionization in the troposphere and stratosphere resulting form the induced nuclear - electromagnetic - muon cascade and secondary particle energy loss @xcite .",
