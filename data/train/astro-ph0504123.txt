    "after many years of effort , transit searches for extrasolar planets have recently come to fruition , with the detection of six extrasolar planets via the transit method .",
    "most of these planets were discovered in deep galactic field surveys by the ogle collaboration @xcite , and subsequently confirmed via radial velocity follow - up @xcite .",
    "one was discovered in a shallow , wide - angle field survey by the tres collaboration @xcite . along with the transiting planet",
    "hd209458b @xcite , originally discovered via radial velocity surveys @xcite , seven transiting planets are currently known , with many more sure to follow .",
    "the photometric light curve of a star with a transiting planet , when combined with detailed spectroscopic follow - up including precise radial velocities , yields the planet radius @xmath0 , mass @xmath11 , and semimajor axis @xmath12 , along with the mass @xmath13 , radius @xmath14 , and effective temperature of the host star . of the routinely observable properties of transiting extrasolar planets , the radius is the primary diagnostic for testing theoretical models .",
    "currently , the radii of the seven known transiting planets are determined to precisions of @xmath15 .",
    "a number of different sources of uncertainty contribute to the total error , but ultimately the uncertainty in the radius of a transiting planet is limited by the uncertainty in the primary mass , such that @xmath16 .",
    "stellar masses can be inferred with precisions of @xmath17 , and thus , in the future , we can expect to be able to measure planetary radii to @xmath18",
    ".    the steadily increasing number and precision of planet radius measurements , along with improvements in the theoretical models of irradiated giant planets , has led many authors to present detailed comparisons between measured radii and model predictions .",
    "other than the mysterious case of hd209458b , whose anomalously large radius continues to elude a satisfying explanation @xcite , these comparisons have generally resulted in agreement between theory and observations @xcite .",
    "although detailed inferences about the ensemble properties of giant close - in planets are not yet possible , the expected precisions should be sufficient to distinguish between , e.g. , models with and without a large solid core .    before celebrating the agreement between the theoretical predictions and observational constraints on extrasolar planetary radii",
    ", we should be certain that all relevant biases in the observations and/or theoretical predictions have been identified .",
    "@xcite identified one such bias , such that the planet radius as inferred from a transit light curve is @xmath19 larger than the photospheric radius predicted by models , due to the fact that rays from the primary passing perpendicular to the planet radius vector suffer a longer path length through the atmosphere .",
    "the purpose of this _ letter _ is to point out that there exists an additional selection effect on the radii of planets detected in signal - to - noise ratio ( @xmath20 ) limited field transit surveys .",
    "this selection effect is such that the number of detected planets is @xmath21 , with @xmath22 . in the presence of intrinsic scatter in the distribution of planetary radii",
    ", this translates directly into a bias in the mean radius of detected planets relative to the intrinsic population .",
    "this bias can affect comparisons of theoretically - predicted radii with the ensemble distribution of observed planet radii .",
    "it will also affect the interpretations of individual systems if there exist unaccounted - for dependences of the radius on unobservable parameters of the system , such as the migration timescale or an indeterminate amount of internal heating .",
    "note that the bias identified here operates in the _ same _ sense as the @xcite ` transit radius ' effect .",
    "therefore , these two biases can easily combine to yield @xmath23 differences from the usual naive comparisons .",
    "these biases are easy to understand .",
    "however , they must be acknowledged and considered when drawing conclusions about the agreement ( or lack thereof ) between theory and observations .",
    "field surveys for transiting planets are subject to a number of selection effects , which can lead to observed distributions of planetary parameters that are biased with respect to the underlying intrinsic distributions .",
    "these selection effects have been discussed by @xcite and @xcite , although these studies were primarily concerned with biases in the periods of detected extrasolar planets and did not consider the bias with respect to planetary radius in any detail . @xcite and @xcite present simple scaling relations for the number of planets detected in a @xmath20-limited field transit survey , as a function of the parameters of the star and planet .",
    "i review the basic steps here , but refer the reader to these papers for a more detailed derivation of these relations .",
    "the total @xmath20 of the photometric detection of a planetary transit is , @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the total number of points in transit , @xmath26 is the total number of data points in the light curve , @xmath27 is the depth of the transit , and @xmath28 is the single - measurement relative photometric precision . in terms of fundamental parameters of the planet and star ,",
    "the @xmath20 scales as @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the equilibrium temperature of the planet , and i have assumed that @xmath28 is limited by poisson noise , such that @xmath31 , where @xmath32 and @xmath33 are the luminosity and distance of the host star , respectively .",
    "i note that the various factors in are unlikely to be independent .",
    "for example , it may be that planet properties are correlated with host star mass and thus @xmath14 .",
    "in addition , models of irradiated planets predict that their radii will likely depend on the amount of stellar insolation absorbed by the planet .",
    "thus @xmath0 is expected to be correlated with @xmath30 , although precise predictions for this correlation are hampered by an incomplete understanding of the physical processes involved with the absorption and redistribution of the energy from the incident stellar radiation .",
    "there is also observational evidence that the mass of close - in giant planets is correlated with @xmath12 , such that planets closer to their parent star are more massive @xcite .",
    "all else equal , this would lead to a correlation of @xmath0 with @xmath12 .",
    "@xcite argue that such a correlation between @xmath0 and @xmath12 largely explains the apparent discrepancy between the period distributions inferred from radial velocity surveys and transit surveys .",
    "this is unlikely to be correct , first because the evidence for a correlation of @xmath0 with @xmath12 is weak , and second because , even for the strength of the correlation quoted by @xcite , the magnitude of resulting selection effect would be less than half that due to the inevitable selection effect arising from the direct dependence on @xmath12 @xcite .",
    "although these correlations are interesting topics for future study , their contribution to the selection effects are unlikely to dominate over the direct @xmath34 term in .",
    "i will therefore ignore the other terms for the remainder of the discussion , and assume @xmath35 .    at a limiting @xmath36 ,",
    "the maximum stellar distance out to which a transiting planet can be detected is therefore @xmath37 .",
    "the number of planets detected is proportional to the total volume over which a planet gives rise to a transit with @xmath38 . assuming a constant volume density @xmath39 of stars and no dust , the number of planets that can be detected is therefore @xmath40 .",
    "if the intrinsic distribution of planetary radii is @xmath41 , the observed distribution of planetary radii @xmath42 will be @xmath43 with @xmath44 .",
    "i leave @xmath45 as a free parameter to allow for departures from the ideal case , as discussed below .",
    "there are a number of assumptions that enter into the derivation of , some of which i have explicitly stated , and others of which are reviewed in @xcite .",
    "the most relevant for the present discussion are the assumptions of a constant volume density of stars , no dust , poisson - noise limited photometry , and a @xmath20-limited survey .",
    "all of these are violated to some extent in the actual field surveys that have detected transiting extrasolar planets .",
    "s.  dorsher , a.  gould , & b.  s.  gaudi ( in preparation ) calculate the expected scaling of the number of detected planets with @xmath0 for the ogle surveys , using a realistic galactic model of the source star and dust distribution , including the joint distribution of host star luminosities and radii , and considering the actual error properties of the ogle photometry .",
    "they find that the number of detected planets is a high power of @xmath0 , but with a somewhat smaller exponent than @xmath46 .",
    "the range is @xmath22 , with lower indices expected for planets with smaller @xmath12 .",
    "the properties of the tres survey have not been described in detail , so i will assume for simplicity that they are similar to the ogle survey .",
    "it is clear from that due to the @xmath47 selection effect in @xmath20-limited transit surveys , the observed distribution of planet radii will be a biased subset of the underlying intrinsic distribution .",
    "for example , the mean of the observed distribution will generally be larger than the mean of the underlying distribution . as a result , if this bias is not taken into account , incorrect inferences about the population of planets as a whole could be drawn from the properties of observed planets .",
    "the magnitude of the bias will clearly depend on the intrinsic distribution of planets . to provide a quantitative estimate of the bias ,",
    "i adopt a gaussian form for the intrinsic distribution @xmath48 of planet radii , with mean @xmath6 and standard deviation @xmath3 .",
    "the mean @xmath49 and standard deviation @xmath50 of the observed planet distribution @xmath51 can then be calculated in the usual way .",
    "although exact analytic expressions for @xmath49 and @xmath50 can be found , they are cumbersome and not particularly illuminating .",
    "the bias , defined here as the fractional difference between the mean of the observed distribution relative to the mean of the intrinsic distribution , @xmath52 , is shown in figure [ fig : one ] .",
    "for @xmath53 , the observed distribution @xmath51 is approximately a gaussian .",
    "therefore , the mean of @xmath51 can be approximated by its maximum , which yields , @xmath54 .",
    "\\label{eqn : rmpoapp}\\ ] ] the resulting bias using this approximation is shown in figure [ fig : one ] ; it agrees well with the exact result . for @xmath55 , @xmath56 thus , if the intrinsic distribution of planet radii has a standard deviation of @xmath57 , the mean of the observed planets will be larger than that of the underlying population by @xmath58 .",
    "i note that the @xmath47 selection effect also tends to result in an observed dispersion that is smaller than the intrinsic dispersion .",
    "however , for @xmath59 , the intrinsic and observed dispersions differ by @xmath60 for @xmath61 .",
    "the magnitude of the bias is relatively insensitive to the form of the intrinsic distribution @xmath62 .",
    "as an example , consider the case where bulk of planets have the form assumed in the above analysis , but there exists an additional population of `` inflated '' planets .",
    "the inflated planets have the same dispersion as the other planets , but their mean radii are larger by @xmath57 , and are ten times less common .",
    "such a population might be indicated by the existence of hd209458b , which appears to have an anomalously large radius . in this case",
    ", the bias is very similar , as shown in figure [ fig : one ] .",
    "i have argued that there exists a bias in the radii of extrasolar planets detected in field transit surveys .",
    "this bias arises from the fact that there exists a strong selection effect in these surveys , such that the number of planets detected is @xmath1 , with @xmath22 .",
    "the magnitude of this bias depends on the form of the intrinsic distribution of planet radii , and is @xmath63 for a gaussian distribution with mean @xmath6 and dispersion @xmath3 .",
    "although the assumption of a gaussian distribution of radii is reasonable , i stress that a bias exists for _ any _ intrinsic distribution with a finite dispersion .",
    "one might be tempted to conclude that this bias only effects inferences about the ensemble distribution of planetary radii , and that point - to - point comparisons between calculations and measurements of the radii of individual systems would be immune to bias .",
    "this is not necessarily the case , however , because there may exist unobservable or poorly constrained parameters that effect the planetary radius , such as the migration timescale , age of the system , or an indeterminate amount of internal heating .",
    "these hidden parameter dependences may give rise to a dispersion in planetary radii at fixed values of the observable parameters .",
    "thus an observed planet is likely to have a larger radius than might be expected based on models incorporating typical values of these hidden parameters .",
    "although the primary purpose of this paper is to simply point out the existence of a radius bias , it is interesting to reconsider the comparison between models and data in light of this previously unaccounted - for effect .",
    "to do so , i use the predictions of models of irradiated giant planets by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "predictions of other models are similar , although there are discrepancies at the @xmath23 level .",
    "i use these models simply because these authors present their predictions in an easily accessible numerical form , specifically as tables of predicted radii as a function of planet mass @xmath11 and @xmath30 @xcite , and as predictions for specific systems @xcite .",
    "these models span planet masses in the range @xmath64 , equilibrium temperatures in the range @xmath65 , and consist of models with and without solid cores of mass @xmath66 for @xmath67 and @xmath68 for @xmath69 .",
    "i increase all model radii by @xmath70 to roughly account for the ` transit radius ' effect discussed by @xcite .",
    "this is somewhat larger than the magnitude expected for more massive planets such as ogle - tr-56b @xcite , and about half that expected for less massive planets like hd209458b @xcite .",
    "i augment the specific predictions of @xcite to include the recently - confirmed planet ogle - tr-10 , using the stellar and planet parameters from @xcite , but accounting for the improved photometry of @xcite .",
    "linearly interpolating from table 1 of @xcite , the predictions for the radius of this planet ( @xmath71 ) are @xmath72 and @xmath73 for models with and without a core , as compared to the ( preliminary ) measured radius of @xmath74 .",
    "figure [ fig : two ] shows the radii of observed extrasolar planets , together with the predictions of @xcite for the range of @xmath30 spanned by these systems , @xmath75 .",
    "as has been noted by numerous authors , the radius of hd209458b is anomalously large .",
    "it is important to emphasize that this object is _ not _ subject to the bias discussed here , as it was originally discovered via radial velocity measurements .",
    "the average _ observed _ radius of the remaining six planets is @xmath76 , with an error in the mean of @xmath77 and an rms of @xmath78 .",
    "the intrinsic dispersion is consistent with zero , however the true dispersion is likely considerably larger . just from the variance in @xmath30 ,",
    "the models of @xcite predict a dispersion of @xmath79 .",
    "any additional variance in the properties of the systems that affect the planet radius ( i.e.  in the age , metallicity , or core mass ) would give rise to a larger dispersion . the 95% c.l",
    ".  upper limit on the intrinsic dispersion is @xmath80 , respectively .",
    "thus the intrinsic dispersion is likely in the range @xmath81 .    without detailed knowledge of the intrinsic scatter in the radii of giant planets ,",
    "it is difficult to assess the effect of the bias on the current dataset with any confidence .",
    "i will therefore proceed rather speculatively . for definiteness",
    ", i will adopt @xmath82 .",
    "although arbitrary , this value seems plausible given expectations about the variance in planet properties and histories . assuming @xmath46 , this gives a bias of @xmath83 .",
    "using this to ` debias ' the mean radius of the observed planets gives an estimate of the mean intrinsic radius of close - in massive extrasolar planets of @xmath84 .",
    "in contrast , the models of @xcite and @xcite predict @xmath85 for coreless planets with the observed masses and effective temperatures . provided that the models of @xcite span the full range of intrinsic planet properties , then this inferred value of the mean intrinsic radius implies that the majority of planets have a massive core .",
    "this also strengthens the case for hd209458b having a anomalously large radius .",
    "although these results are tantalizing , i stress that the comparison between the measured radii and theoretical predictions presented here is only preliminary .",
    "a more detailed study should be performed using a full suite of theoretical predictions , and a more careful consideration of the observational and theoretical biases .",
    "this work was supported by a menzel fellowship from the harvard college observatory .",
