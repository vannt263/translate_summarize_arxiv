    "each white , black , or grey vertex corresponds to a cycle of @xmath52 , @xmath53 , or @xmath54 respectively , and the cycle is encoded by the local _ counter - clockwise _ order of the triangles the vertex belongs to .",
    "the degree of a vertex in a cacti is the number of such triangles , and the degree distribution of the vertices of a given color is the partition of @xmath1 formed by the degrees of all the vertices of this color .",

    "an equivalent statement holds for @xmath50 and @xmath30 . from a topological point of view ,",
    "partitioned cacti can be seen as @xmath15-cacti encoded by the permutations @xmath87 , and @xmath88 whose vertices of each color are partitioned .",
