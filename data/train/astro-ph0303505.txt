    "the gamma - ray bursts ( grb ) which have so far been accurately localized are associated with regions of active star formation , and their progenitors are thought to be massive stars .",

    ", the jets can accelerate protons which undergo a more complex sequence of high energy interactions than previously realized .",
    "these depend not only on the jet and central engine characteristics but also on the location of the shocks and on the outer dimensions of the stellar progenitor , thus providing potentially useful diagnostics for the type of progenitor as well as the jet and shock parameters .",
    "protons accelerated in sub - stellar jet shocks first undergo photomeson interactions with thermalized shock photons , as well as @xmath3 interactions with thermal nucleons in the jet frame .",
    "this modifies the relativistic proton spectrum reaching the end of the jet cavity , where the protons undergo a second set of photomeson interactions with stellar x - ray photons and @xmath3 interactions with cold nucleons in the stellar frame .",
    "the fraction of collapses producing jets which subsequently emerge from the star to produce electromagnetically detectable grbs are expected to be preceded by a precursor neutrino signal at energies @xmath4 tev , which is significantly different from the previously calculated @xmath5 tev neutrino signals coincident with the @xmath0-rays @xcite .",

    ". the number of events can be significantly larger for brighter ( @xmath123 ergs / s ) or nearer ( @xmath124 ) bursts , or also if they are of longer duration ( @xmath125 s ) .",
    "the main feature of the high energy neutrino spectra of massive stellar collapse buried jet models related to grb ( and also of models involving a precursor supernova , refs .",
    "@xcite ) , is that a `` thicker target '' of nucleons and photons is available to give higher fluxes of @xmath2 1 - 100 tev neutrinos , compared to those expected from internal or external shocks which occur outside the stellar progenitor @xcite .    the neutrino flux expected in association with electromagnetically detected grb , shown in fig . [ fig : difflux ] , precedes the @xmath0-rays by about 10 - 100 seconds , approximately the time taken by the jet to emerge from the collapsing core and the stellar envelope .",
    "neutrinos coming from both @xmath49 and @xmath50 interactions in the sub - stellar jet are heavily suppressed by inverse compton scatterings due to large photon density .",
    "the precursor neutrinos in the 1 - 100 tev range from a single @xmath0-ray bright event , coming from @xmath50 interactions in the h envelope ( @xmath63 case ) can be detected with icecube .",
    "the number of events from a single burst at a distance @xmath126 cm ( @xmath117 ) and duration @xmath127 s would be @xmath2 4 in the @xmath63 h - envelope star case , compared to @xmath128 0.04 in the @xmath64 he star case .",
    "( rare single bursts occuring about once per year at @xmath129 cm could yield @xmath130 higher event rates per burst ) . thus , detection of many bursts with 1 - 100 tev neutrino precursors in correlation with a subsequent @xmath0-ray detectable grb would be a strong indication for an h progenitor .",
    "a rare detection of a weaker 100 tev neutrino precursor would favor a he star progenitor .",
    "the number of stars more massive than about 30 solar masses out to @xmath117 undergoing a core collapse that leads to a black hole is about @xmath131/year corresponding to @xmath132 yr@xmath133 galaxy@xmath133 of type ii supernovae rate .",
    "an interesting possibility @xcite is that many or perhaps all of these lead to jets as in grb , in which case most of these jets do not break through the stellar surface , and hence are not observed in @xmath0-rays ( at most @xmath134/year can be observed as grb ) .",

    "the typical angular resolution of planned neutrino telescopes at tev energies @xcite should be @xmath136 . for the @xmath0-ray dark cases , the diffuse flux for a total number of collapses @xmath135/year out to @xmath117 would be sufficiently above the atmospheric neutrino background , especially in the pev range , that detection appears possible even without coincident photon flashes .",
    "( the @xmath0-ray dark collapses could , however , be possibly associated with faint supernova - like optical / ir events , weeks to months later , if the stellar envelope is ejected ) .",
    "the non - detection of a diffuse signal would be significant only if we have direct evidence for neutrino production in grbs .",
    "this may come from a detection of either the grb / afterglow neutrinos , or from a detection of the stellar @xmath50 neutrinos in the h case . in this case ,",
    "an upper limit on the diffuse flux can serve to constrain the rate of  dark \" bursts and the progenitor nature .",
    "if there is no direct evidence for neutrino production , the non - detection of a diffuse signal may imply no protons in the grb jet and/or no proton acceleration .",
    "the flux may exceed the wb bound @xcite if opaque collisions occur where the @xmath50 ( @xmath49 ) optical depth is very high , which implies that the nucleons do not escape . in this case , the proton energy generation rate of these `` hidden sources '' may exceed the energy generation rate inferred from cosmic - ray observations , and hence the neutrino flux may exceed the wb bound .    the neutrino flux level and spectra in detected grbs would serve as a diagnostic of the outer dimensions of the stellar progenitor at the time the explosion occured , providing useful constraints on the identity and evolutionary scenarios of the progenitors , as well as providing clues and a consistency check for possible association with supernova - like objects .",
    "the measurement of such neutrino bursts from @xmath0-ray dark collapses would provide useful constraints on the total rate of massive stellar collapses at high redshifts , a quantity of significant interest for cosmological reionization , structure formation and intergalactic metal enrichment scenarios .",
