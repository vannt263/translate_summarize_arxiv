    "<S> spin-1/2 magnets with kagom geometry , being for years a generic object of theoretical investigations , have few real material realizations . recently , a dft - based microscopic model for two such materials , kapellasite cu@xmath0zn(oh)@xmath1cl@xmath2 and haydeeite cu@xmath0mg(oh)@xmath1cl@xmath2 , was presented @xmath3janson o , richter j and rosner h , arxiv:0806.1592@xmath4 $ ] . here , </S>",
    "<S> we focus on the intrinsic properties of real spin-1/2 kagom materials having influence on the magnetic ground state and the low - temperature excitations . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the values of exchange integrals are strongly dependent on o  </S>",
    "<S> h distance inside the hydroxyl groups , present in most spin-1/2 kagom compounds up to date . </S>",
    "<S> besides the original kagom model , considering only the nearest neighbour exchange , we emphasize the crucial role of the exchange along the diagonals of the kagom lattice .    </S>",
    "<S> two - dimensional ( 2d ) magnets with a kagom lattice arrangement of magnetic ions ( figure  [ str ] ) are geometrically frustrated due to a triangular - like arrangement of nearest neighbours ( nn ) leading to an unusual highly degenerate classical ground state ( gs )  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> strong quantum fluctuations arising from spin-1/2 ions can lift the classical degeneracy and drive the system into a magnetically disordered quantum paramagnetic state , which might be applied for future quantum computational applications  @xcite . nonetheless , in real materials couplings to further neighbours  @xcite and between the kagom layers  @xcite are always present and influence the gs and the thermodynamics .    in a recent paper  @xcite we have performed dft calculations for two new natural isostructural materials with spin-1/2 kagom lattice  kapellasite cu@xmath0zn(oh)@xmath1cl@xmath2  @xcite and haydeeite cu@xmath0mg(oh)@xmath1cl@xmath2  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the local density approximation ( lda ) yields a metallic solution ( left panel in figure  [ dos ] ) in contrast to the experimentally observed insulating behaviour due to underestimation of strong on - site correlations for the cu@xmath5 sites . to account for this deficit </S>",
    "<S> , we carried out an effective one - band tight - binding ( tb ) fit of the lda bands ( figure  [ dos ] , right panel ) and subsequently mapped the resulting transfer integrals @xmath6 to an extended hubbard model and to a heisenberg model with @xmath7 . </S>",
    "<S> this mapping provides an estimate for the antiferromagnetic ( afm ) part of the exchange . to obtain the values for the total exchange , consisting of afm and ferromagnetic contributions </S>",
    "<S> , we have performed supercell calculations for various spin arrangements . </S>",
    "<S> the correlations were treated in the lsda+@xmath8 approximation . we have found that besides the standard kagom model based on nn interactions ( @xmath9 ) , an additional coupling along diagonals of kagom hexagons ( @xmath10 ) is relevant ( figure  [ str ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> since the absolute values of @xmath9 and @xmath10 change only the overall temperature scale , their ratio @xmath11 is crucial for the gs and low - energy excitations .    </S>",

    "<S> there is an antiparallel ( nel ) spin alignment ( e.g. the spins at the light and dark green circles ) . on each triangle formed by nn bonds </S>",
    "<S> @xmath9 ( e.g. spins on sites 21 , 22 , 23 ) there is a @xmath16 spin arrangement . </S>",

    "<S> @xmath20 @xmath20 @xmath20 @xmath20,width=362 ]    one focus of this paper is to emphasize the influence of side groups ( which are commonly neglected in model physics ) on different exchange paths . </S>",
    "<S> a key issue of theoretical investigations of real materials is the construction of a relevant model , which describes experimental data and has predictive power . for cuprates , that are insulators with a @xmath21 cu@xmath5 configuration , </S>",
    "<S> the extension from the initial heisenberg idea to consider only spin degrees of freedom ( heisenberg model ) to a multiband hubbard model with a separate treatment of cu @xmath22 and o @xmath23 orbitals became computationally feasible only recently . </S>",
    "<S> on the other hand , the famous goodenough - kanamori - anderson ( gka ) rules formulated quite early on an empirical basis provide a simple intuitive picture for the exchange interactions based on geometrical quantities . due to the simplicity of the gka rules </S>",
    "<S> , they are violated in many cases . a natural way to search for a possible origin of these phenomena </S>",
    "<S> is to improve the model by including ligand fields effect . in general , </S>",
    "<S> such models are very difficult to evaluate . even in case of simple systems like cugeo@xmath0 the models are quite complicated and contain many parameters  @xcite .    here </S>",
    "<S> , we present the results of a dft - based modeling for cu@xmath0zn@xmath3mg@xmath4$](oh)@xmath1cl@xmath2 . in these compounds , </S>",
    "<S> the leading exchange interactions are strongly dependent on the position of h atoms  the simplest possible side groups .    for haydeeite , the experimentally defined h position yields an unusually short o  </S>",
    "<S> h distance ( @xmath24 ) of 0.78   ( for kapellasite the h position has not been reported ) . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , in lda calculations we relaxed the h position which resulted in an optimized @xmath25   for both systems . in order to elucidate the influence of @xmath24 on the exchange integrals </S>",
    "<S> , we have studied the range @xmath26   which covers the experimental errors ( that are large due to weak x - ray scattering by h atoms ) . </S>",
    "<S> the details of our calculations are described in  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we find that @xmath24 has a strong influence on the nn exchange @xmath9 , while @xmath10 is almost unaffected . </S>",
    "<S> obviously , this modifies their ratio @xmath27 and consequently the physical properties . </S>",
    "<S> the underlying reason is the shift of oxygen states down in energy caused by the shortening of an o  h bond . in consequence , </S>",
    "<S> cu  o hybridization decreases . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , for a fixed cu  o geometry , a decreased @xmath24 reduces the afm contribution to the total exchange . </S>",
    "<S> this is supported by a strongly reduced bandwidth ( which is related via @xmath28 to the afm exchange ) for a reduced @xmath24 ( figure  [ dos ] , right panel ) and fits well the results of supercell calculations . </S>",
    "<S> there , we find a quasi - linear @xmath29 dependence with a positive slope for both compounds . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath9 is 2.5 times larger for @xmath30   than for @xmath31   in kapellasite ( 2.5  mev versus 1  mev ) , while it changes the sign in haydeeite ( @xmath32  mev versus @xmath33  mev ) .    </S>",
    "<S> the next step towards a physically relevant picture of real materials is to evaluate the influence of @xmath27 onto the gs and the low - lying excitations . here </S>",
    "<S> , we use a @xmath9-@xmath10 spin-1/2 heisenberg model on the kagom lattice ( @xmath9-@xmath10 model ) . </S>",
    "<S> the classical gs of the pure kagom system ( @xmath34 ) is known to be highly degenerate . </S>",
    "<S> the additional diagonal bond @xmath10 reduces this degeneracy drastically and selects non - coplanar classical gs s with twelve magnetic sublattices ( see figure  [ 36 ] ) among the huge number of classical gs s existing for @xmath34 . </S>",
    "<S> for the quantum spin-1/2 model we have calculated the gs by exact diagonalization for the finite lattice shown in figure  [ 36 ] .    obviously , the quantum gs spin - spin correlations are drastically affected when including @xmath10 . </S>",
    "<S> while for _ _ </S>",
    "<S> j__@xmath35 all spin correlations except the nn correlation function @xmath36 are close to zero we find a well pronounced short - range order for @xmath37 , that corresponds to the classical magnetic structure . for @xmath38 </S>",
    "<S> the strongest spin correlations are @xmath39 , @xmath40 , @xmath41 , and they belong to the chains formed by @xmath10 bonds . </S>",
    "<S> the nn correlation function @xmath42 monotonously decreases with @xmath10 . </S>",
    "<S> the correlation function @xmath43 belongs to two sites located on sublattices being perpendicular in the classical gs , and it is almost zero for @xmath38 . </S>",
    "<S> this leads to the conclusion that even in the quantum model the gs might have a non - coplanar magnetic structure giving rise to enhanced chiral correlations .    </S>",
    "<S> to summarize , we have shown the relevance of the ligand field for the low - energy physics by example of two spin-1/2 cuprates with a kagom lattice geometry . </S>",
    "<S> we found that there are two relevant exchange integrals in both materials . </S>",
    "<S> the ratio @xmath18 is strongly dependent on the o  </S>",
    "<S> h distance and has a drastic impact on the physical properties : the quantum gs of a corresponding spin-1/2 heisenberg @xmath9-@xmath10 antiferromagnet on the kagom lattice exhibits strong magnetic correlations along @xmath10 bonds for @xmath44 , whereas the other correlations remain weak . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , the low - energy excitations might be @xmath45 spinons causing an effectively one - dimensional low - temperature physics as has been discussed previously for other 2d models such as the crossed - chain model  @xcite as well as for the anisotropic triangular lattice  @xcite . as the physical properties are related to @xmath27 which is strongly dependent on the o  </S>",
    "<S> h distance , the h position should be reinvestigated experimentally with better accuracy . </S>",
    "<S> generally , a precise determination of the position of side group atoms is crucial for an accurate model derivation . </S>",
    "<S> we suggest that the dependence of exchange integrals on side group positions can be used to tune a magnetic ground state under changed conditions like external pressure . </S>"
