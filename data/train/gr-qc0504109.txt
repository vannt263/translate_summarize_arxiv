    "the principle of local lorentz invariance ( lli ) , stating the independence of physical laws from the state of motion of inertial laboratories , is one of the most fundamental facts about our physical world .",
    "the first precision measurement , demonstrating lli for light propagation , was performed by michelson and morley in 1887 and its result was an essential experimental foundation for the advent of relativity .",
    "lli is incorporated as a fundamental symmetry into the accepted theories of the fundamental forces , general relativity @xcite and the standard model .",
    "numerous experiments have tested lli with respect to matter and to the electromagnetic field and have upheld its validity until to date @xcite . for electromagnetic waves the isotropy of space has so far been verified a the level of a few parts in @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "new generations of tests of lli and of other fundamental symmetries ( weak equivalence principle , local position invariance , cpt symmetry ) are seen as one important approach in the quest for a deeper understanding of the forces of nature @xcite .",
    "they might provide useful input for the development of a theory able to describe gravity at the quantum level . in these theories , violations of fundamental symmetries",
    "are being considered .",
    "thus , the theoretical models call for improved experiments to either validate lli at much higher precision levels , or to uncover its limits of validity",
    ".    violations of lli can be interpreted using so - called test theories . a kinematic test theory commonly applied",
    "is that by robertson , mansouri and sexl ( rms ) @xcite . here",
    ", light propagation is described relative to a preferred frame ( `` ether frame '' ) @xmath3 in which there is no preferred direction and thus the speed of light @xmath4 is constant .",
    "usually the frame in which the cosmic microwave background is isotropic is assumed to be this frame .",
    "lorentz transformations between a laboratory frame s and @xmath3 are replaced by general linear transformations which depend on the velocity @xmath5 of the lab frame with respect to @xmath3 and on three phenomenological parameters @xmath6 , @xmath7 , and @xmath8 .",
    "these reduce to @xmath9 , @xmath10 , @xmath11 if lli is valid . in the moving frame s",
    ", the speed of light can be expressed to lowest order in @xmath12 as @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the angle of the direction of light propagation relative to the velocity @xmath5 of the laboratory .",
    "thus , violations of the constancy of the speed of light are described by two nonzero parameter combinations .",
    "recently , a comprehensive dynamical test theory of lli violation has been developed , the standard model extension ( sme ) @xcite .",
    "it is based on the lagrangian of the standard model , extended by terms that violate lli and cpt .",
    "these terms describe possible violations in the behavior of both matter and fields , and contain a large number of unknown parameters , whose values can in principle be determined by an appropriately large set of ( partially independent ) experiments . in particular , the extended lagrangian of the electromagnetic field is given by @xmath15 the dimensionless tensor @xmath16 describes violations of lli and has 19 independent coefficients .",
    "its values are dependent on the frame of reference ; a frame in which the sun is stationary is chosen for practical reasons . of these coefficients ,",
    "10 describe polarization - dependent effects .",
    "these can be restricted to the level of @xmath17 using astronomical observations of the polarization of distant light sources @xcite .",
    "of the remaining 9 coefficients , one ( @xmath18 ) describes an asymmetry of the one - way speed of electromagnetic waves @xcite , while the others describe different aspects of violations of constancy , _",
    "i.e. _ a dependence on propagation direction and on the speed of the laboratory frame of reference .",
    "the corresponding eight coefficients can be arranged in two traceless 3@xmath193 matrices : the antisymmetric @xmath20 that describes violation of boost invariance and therefore enters observable quantities weighted by the ratio @xmath21 of earth s orbital velocity and the speed of light , and the symmetric @xmath22 quantifying anisotropy of @xmath23 .",
    "these eight coefficients can in principle be determined by measuring the time dependence of the resonance frequency of an electromagnetic resonator ( assuming that particles satisfy lli ) .",
    "if the electromagnetic resonator is stationary , seven coefficients can be determined by taking advantage of the rotation and orbital motion of earth .",
    "three experiments , using ultra - stable cryogenic resonators for microwaves and optical waves , have been performed recently along this line .",
    "@xcite took data for @xmath24100 days and could constrain four coefficients of @xmath25 and four linear combinations of three coefficients of @xmath26 .",
    "@xcite performed an experiment where the measurement duration was extended to a sufficient duration ( over 1 year ) that the measurement of the 7 coefficients was achieved .",
    "wolf et al .",
    "@xcite extended the measurement time further and improved significantly on the limits .",
    "the eighth coefficient , @xmath27 , has so far not been determined .",
    "the resonator frequency measurement involved in a test of lli requires a frequency reference with a frequency instability comparable to the desired measurement accuracy @xcite . an alternative approach is the use of two cavities oriented at right angles @xcite .",
    "one then measures the difference between the two cavity frequencies , @xmath28 .",
    "for a two - cavity configuration , the beat frequency modulation can be expressed as @xmath29 where @xmath30 ( @xmath31 hz ) is the average frequency and @xmath32 it the angle between one cavity s axis relative to the south direction .",
    "each amplitude 2@xmath33 and 2@xmath34 is a linear combination of eight sme coefficients weighted by time - harmonic factors .",
    "the amplitude @xmath33 contains frequency components at 0 , @xmath35 , @xmath36 , @xmath37 and @xmath38 , while @xmath34 contains in addition one component at the frequency @xmath39 . here",
    "@xmath35 is earth s sidereal angular frequency and @xmath39 is earth s orbital frequency .",
    "the determination of the individual @xmath26 coefficients requires the ability to resolve the contribution of earth s orbital motion in order to discriminate between frequency coefficients differing by @xmath39 .",
    "thus a measurement extending over of at least 1 year is necessary .",
    "the contribution of @xmath27 to the beat frequency signal is @xmath40 where @xmath41 is the colatitude of the laboratory .",
    "it is evident from eq.([eq2 ] ) that @xmath27 coefficient is only measurable by active rotation .",
    "another advantage is that the apparatus has to be stable only over individual rotation periods , in contrast to stationary experiments , which must be stable over 12h .",
    "slow ( compared to the rotation period ) systematic variations of the beat frequency can be eliminated in the data analysis by fitting individual rotation periods .",
    "furthermore , in a non - rotating experiment four data values can be obtained from a measurement lasting 12h .",
    "in contrast , a rotating experiment offers the possibility to determine two data points @xmath42 and @xmath43 for every rotation ( @xmath44 is the mid - time of the rotation period , and the period is chosen much smaller than 12h ) .",
    "thus , a rotating experiment offers a significant increase in data acquisition rate and thus a reduction of statistical noise .",
    "an overall measurement time of 1 year or longer is still necessary for a precise determination of individual coefficients .",
    "crystalline sapphire optical cavities operated at cryogenic temperature were used .",
    "these cavities have previously been used to test lli with a non - rotating setup @xcite as well as local position invariance @xcite .",
    "fig.[set - up : fig ] shows a schematic of the experiment .",
    "a mechanical rotation stage carries the cryostat ( containing the cavities ) , an associated optical breadboard and most components ( lasers , power supplies , servo systems ) .",
    "the rotation stage itself rests on an optical table that was not floated .",
    "the cavities were cooled to 3.4  k by means of a pulse - tube cooler ( ptc ) @xcite , in which he gas is periodically compressed and expanded .",
    "the use of a mechanical cooler has the advantage of continuous operation without the need to periodically refill cryogens .",
    "furthermore , slow mechanical deformations occurring in conventional cryostats as a consequence of change in cryogen levels are avoided .    inside the cryostat vacuum ,",
    "the two cavities together with various optical components and photodiodes were mounted on a copper base plate which was supported by rods extending from the top flange of the cryostat .",
    "copper braids provided thermal contact to the cold head of the cooler , and offered some compensation from the periodic length modulation occurring in the cooler due to pressure oscillation in the tubes @xcite .    the angular range of the stage was limited to about 90 degrees by the he pressure lines connecting the cooler to the stationary compressor , but this was sufficient for the purpose of the experiment .",
    "a rotation period 10min was chosen for a rotation over @xmath45 $ ] .",
    "faster rotation led to disturbances .",
    "the cavities are high - reflection coated for wavelengths around 1@xmath46 m . in order to avoid rotation - induced variations in the alignment of the laser beams with respect to the cavities that would result in lock errors ,",
    "the laser waves are brought to the cavities through two optical fibers .",
    "two diode - pumped monolithic nd : yag lasers were locked to the two cavities by means of a drever - hall reflection locking scheme @xcite . the respective photodiodes were located in the cryostat , next to the cavities .",
    "the lasers were frequency - modulated using the piezo actuators glued to the laser crystals as modulators , adding the modulation frequencies to the control feedback signals @xcite .",
    "parts of the laser beams were superimposed on a fast photodiode producing a heterodyne signal at the beat frequency @xmath47 between the two lasers ( of the order of 700  mhz ) .",
    "that was measured with a frequency counter .",
    "the periodic pressure modulation ( at 1.1@xmath48hz ) led to a residual modulation of the beat frequency between the two cavity - locked lasers , which amounted to approx.200@xmath48hz amplitude .",
    "however , this modulation was later removed using fourier filtering .",
    "the typical allan standard deviation of the beat frequency ( for nonrotating resonators ) was 2.5  hz for an integration time of 30s , and 5hz ( @xmath49 ) for an integration time of 300s , ( half of the rotation period ) .",
    "the dependence of the cavity resonance frequencies on the beam powers was measured to be @xmath50hz per @xmath51w impinging on the cavities .",
    "the laser powers were actively stabilized using acousto - optical - modulators ( aom ) , also serving as optical isolators . at a typical working power of 50 - 100@xmath46w onto the cavities ,",
    "the influence of residual power changes was thereby reduced to the level of 0.1  hz ( @xmath52 ) for integration times of hundreds of seconds .",
    "the dependence of the beat frequency on the temperature of the baseplate supporting the cavities was on the order of 1.5  hz / mk .",
    "active stabilization resulted in an instability of 45  @xmath51k at 300s integration time , and thus a temperature - induced beat frequency instability on the order of 0.07  hz ( @xmath53 ) .",
    "the sensitivity of the beat frequency to tilt of the table supporting the apparatus was 0.06hz/@xmath51rad ( @xmath54rad ) .",
    "the tilts along two horizontal axes were monitored continuously during the rotations for later decorrelation .",
    "typical tilt modulation during a rotation was 50 @xmath51rad peak - to - peak , corresponding to a inferred beat modulation of several hz .",
    "however , for the data analysis only the beat frequency modulation components at @xmath55 are relevant ; for these the inferred peak - to - peak amplitudes were typically less than 1hz .    -1.5",

    "the data analyzed in this publication was collected during very stable operation from 4 february 2005 to 8 february 2005 for 76 hours .",
    "frequency sampling was at 1 s intervals .",
    "the measured tilts were time - averaged , weighted with the measured beat frequency sensitivities and subtracted from the beat data .",
    "then , the beat modulation at 1.1 hz , caused by the ptc , was removed .",
    "after removal of clearly disturbed rotations , the remaining 432 rotation periods @xmath56 $ ] ( labelled by @xmath57 ) were each least - squares fitted with functions @xmath58 , where the coefficients @xmath59 quantifiy a ( slowly varying ) linear drift .",
    "the obtained amplitude sets @xmath60 , @xmath61 are shown in fig.[2b.fig ] .",
    "the data were analysed in the following ways .",
    "\\(i ) within the rms - framework , for two orthogonal cavities located on earth and considering the preferred frame mentioned above , the beat frequency can be written as in eq.([eq1 ] ) with @xmath62 @xmath63 @xmath64 @xmath65    where @xmath66 , @xmath67 , @xmath68 , @xmath69 , @xmath70 , @xmath71 , @xmath72 , @xmath73 , @xmath74  .",
    "@xmath75 is the time since the beginning of the data plus an offset that accounts for a time difference since the coincidence of the lab s @xmath76 axis with the @xmath77 axis of the sun - centered system @xcite .",
    "the direction of the sun s velocity @xmath78 relative to the cosmic microwave background is given by the right ascension @xmath79 and the declination @xmath80 . in fitting the above expression to our data",
    ", we take into account that the finite average values of @xmath81 and @xmath82 are likely to be due to a ( constant ) systematic error .",
    "we model this by adding a contribution @xmath83 to eq.([eq1 ] ) , and fit @xmath84 .",
    "effectively , this means that only the modulation of the @xmath85 amplitudes by earth s rotation contributes to the fit result for @xmath86 .",
    ".[tab : table1 ] fourier amplitudes determined from the experiment .",
    "all quantities are in units of @xmath87 . [ cols=\"<,<,>,>,>\",options=\"header \" , ]     the fit yields @xmath88 and is shown in fig.[2b.fig ] . due to the experimental error in the determination of the tilt sensitivities",
    "there is an additional ( systematic ) error of @xmath89 .",
    "our result is about factor 10 lower than the previous best results @xmath90 @xcite and @xmath91 @xcite .",
    "\\(ii ) using all our data we can obtain a fit of the 5 fourier amplitudes of @xmath92 at the time @xmath93 @xmath94 6 february 2005 , see table [ tab : table1 ]",
    ". these amplitudes are linear combinations of the @xmath25 and @xmath26 coefficients , where the weights of the latter depend on earth s orbital phase ( see appendix e of @xcite ) . for the fit we make use of the approximate relationship between the functions @xmath33 and @xmath34 @xcite and we include a coefficient @xmath95 in @xmath33 in order to describe a systematic effect .",
    "note that due to the limited extent of the data over time , the frequencies @xmath96 and @xmath97 can not be distinguished and therefore it is not possible to extract the individual coefficients @xmath25 and @xmath26 from the @xmath98 coefficients .",
    "\\(iii ) the results of the microwave cryogenic experiment @xcite found the elements of @xmath99 ( except for @xmath100 and the elements of @xmath101 ( @xmath26 ) to be zero within several parts in @xmath102 .",
    "if we assume these elements to be zero , we can use only the @xmath103-coefficient to determine @xmath27 , _",
    "i.e. _ eq.([eq2 ] ) is truncated at the first term .",
    "the result is @xmath104 .",
    "as this nonzero value is likely due to a systematic effect , we may state that the value of @xmath105 is probably less than @xmath106 .",
    "we believe the nonzero averages of the @xmath81 and @xmath82 amplitudes are due to a systematic effect of thermal origin .",
    "a ( small ) thermal gradient is present in the laboratory , through which the apparatus rotates .",
    "the magnitude of the effect is consistent with our measured temperature sensitivity and the temperature modulation amplitude measured at the top of the apparatus .",
    "overall , our experiment is limited firstly by the slow maximum rotation speed allowed by the system . a faster , variable rotation speed would in principle allow a more detailed study of the systematic effects or a partial suppression thereof .",
    "however , faster rotation could not be used with our setup .",
    "secondly , the laser frequency lock stability is limited by the small signal - to - noise ratio ( low cavity throughput ) , which limits the ability to more precisely characterize the systematic effects .    in conclusion",
    ", we have described a michelson - morley - type experiment that has led to the first determination of a limit for @xmath27 of the standard model extension , @xmath107 .",
    "an analysis of the data in the rms framework yielded an upper limit for a hypothetical direction dependence of @xmath23 an order of magnitude lower than the best previous measurements .",
    "we note that the present results were achieved using a measurement duration one hundred times shorter .",
