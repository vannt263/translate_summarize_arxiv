    "the certification of quantum devices is an important strand in current research in quantum information .",
    "research in this direction is not only of relevance to quantum information but also the foundations of quantum theory : what are the truly quantum phenomena ?",
    "for example , if presented with devices as black boxes that are claimed to contain systems associated with particular quantum states and measurements , we can certify these claims by demonstrating quantum non - locality , i.e. by violating a particular bell inequality @xcite .",
    "the obvious aspect of quantum non - locality that is useful for quantum information is that it can certify quantum entanglement .",
    "while this is relevant for the certification of the presence of quantum entanglement , if we wish to certify a particular state and measurement we need more information .",
    "more specifically , given a particular violation of a bell inequality , can we infer the state and measurements ?",
    "the amount of information necessary to certify a particular state once entanglement is certified has been discussed in ref .",
    "let us consider the specific example of the clauser - horne - shimony - holt ( chsh ) inequality @xcite .",
    "it can be shown that ( up to local operations that will be specified later ) the only state that can maximally violate the chsh inequality is the maximally entangled two - qubit state @xcite .",
    "furthermore , if we are close to the maximal violation , then we are also close to this maximally entangled state ( for appropriate notions of closeness ) @xcite",
    ". results in this direction are referred to as _ robust self - testing _ ( rst ) such that a near - maximal violation of a bell inequality robustly self - tests a state .",
    "we can also robustly self - test measurements performed on a state therefore equipping us with certification techniques for both states and measurements .",
    "to be more concrete , rst is possible if the correlations we observe in a bell test are @xmath0-close to some ideal correlations  such as those maximally violating a bell inequality  then we can infer that the state used in the bell test is @xmath1-close to our ideal state .",
    "the notion of closeness will be expounded upon later but for correlations we often talk about the difference between the maximal bell inequality violation and the violation obtained in the experiment , and for quantum states , we refer to the trace distance .",
    "this quadratic difference in the distance measures can not be improved upon if we only have access to the correlations @xcite .    in this direction ,",
    "a bounty of results have emerged .",
    "there are now analytical methods for robustly self - testing greenberger - horne - zeilinger ( ghz ) states @xcite , graph states @xcite , partially entangled two - qubit states @xcite and the so - called w state @xcite .",
    "in addition to this , numerical robust self - testing methods were developed that allow for using arbitrary bell inequalities @xcite . also , it is worth noting that by simply and directly considering the correlations produced in the experiment , numerical methods developed in refs .",
    "@xcite can also be tailored to these considerations .",
    "it is now well - established that the violation of a bell inequality is not the only method for detecting entanglement in general .",
    "it is the appropriate method if one only has access to measurement statistics , i.e. the devices are treated like black boxes .",
    "clearly , if we have direct access to the quantum state ( e.g. the devices are trusted ) , we can do full state tomography to see if it is an entangled state .",
    "there does exist a third option , if a provider claims to produce a bipartite entangled state and sends one half of the state to a client who wants to use the state .",
    "we can assume that the client trusts all of the apparatus in their laboratory and can thus do state tomography on their share of the system .",
    "this set - up corresponds to the notion of _ epr - steering _ in the study of entanglement @xcite , where epr represents einstein - podolsky - rosen in tribute to their 1935 original paper @xcite .",
    "a natural question is whether one can perform robust self - testing in such a scenario ?",
    "this is obviously true since we can use the violation of a bell inequality between the client and provider .",
    "a better question is whether it is vastly more advantageous to consider self - testing in this scenario ? in this work , we address this question .    before describing the work in this paper ,",
    "we would like to motivate this scenario from the point - of - view of quantum information .",
    "in particular , studying these epr - steering scenarios may be useful when considering _ blind quantum computing _ where a client has restricted quantum operations and wishes to securely delegate a computation to a  server \" that has a full - power quantum computer @xcite . by securely , we mean that the server does not learn the input to the computation nor the particular computation itself . in this framework , the client trusts all of his quantum resources but distrusts the server .",
    "epr - steering has also been utilised for _ one - sided device - independent quantum key distribution _ where the  one - sided \" indicates that one of the parties does not trust their device but the other does @xcite .",
    "there have even been experimental demonstrations of cryptographic schemes in this direction @xcite .",
    "also in this one - sided device - independent approach , the detection loophole is less detrimental to performing cryptographic tasks as compared with full device - independence so it is more amenable to current optical experiments @xcite .",
    "since one party ( the client ) now trusts all systems in their laboratory , they can perform quantum state tomography ; after all , they know the hilbert space dimension of their quantum systems and can choose to make measurements that characterise states of that particular dimension .",
    "this novel aspect of epr - steering as compared to standard non - locality introduces a novel object of study , called the assemblage : the reduced states on a client s share of some larger states conditioned on measurements made on the provider s side @xcite .",
    "an element of an assemblage is then a sub - normalized quantum state and we can now also phrase robust self - testing in terms of these objects , which we call _ robust assemblage - based one - sided self - testing _ ( ast ) with  one - sided \" to indicate there is one untrusted party .",
    "in essence , we show that ast can be achieved and the experimental state is at least @xmath1-close to an ideal state if the observed elements of an assemblage are @xmath0-close to the ideal elements ( where distance in both cases is the trace distance ) .",
    "this is in addition to considering the correlations between the client and provider obtained from performing a measurement on the elements of an assemblage , which we call _ robust correlation - based one - sided self - testing _ ( cst )",
    " the notions of robustness are the same as for rst .",
    "conventional rst based on bell inequality violation implies cst so in the latter scenario we will never do any worse than in the former .",
    "furthermore , cst implies ast so the latter truly captures the novel capabilities in the formalism . in this work , for particular situations",
    "we show both analytically and numerically that one can do better in the framework of cst and ast as compared to current methods in rst .",
    "this is to be expected since by trusting one side , we should have access to more information about our initial state . on the other hand ,",
    "we show that the degree of the improvement is not as dramatic as we would like .",
    "in particular , if the assemblage is , in some sense , @xmath0-close to the ideal assemblage , we can only establish @xmath1-closeness of our operations to the ideal case .",
    "this quadratic difference is also shown to be a general limitation and not just a limitation of our specific methods . in this way , from the point - of - view of self - testing , epr - steering behaves much like quantum non - locality .",
    "we indicate where ast and cst could also prove advantageous over rst and this is in the case of establishing the structure of sub - systems within multi - partite quantum states .",
    "that is , in certain rst proofs a lot of work and resources goes into establishing that untrusted devices have quantum systems that are essentially independent from one another .",
    "in addition to considering the self - testing of a bipartite quantum state , we show that one can get further improvements by establishing a tensor product structure between sub - systems .",
    "this could be where the essential novelties of ast and cst lie .",
    "aside from work in the remit of self - testing there is other work in the direction of entanglement verification between many parties .",
    "for example , pappa _ et al _ show how to verify ghz states among @xmath2 parties if some of them can be trusted while others not @xcite .",
    "their verification proofs boil down to establishing the probability with which the quantum state passes a particular test given the state s distance from the ideal case .",
    "this can be seen as going in the other direction compared to cst , where we ask how close a state is to ideal if we pass a test ( demonstrating some ideal correlations ) with a particular probability .",
    "our work thus nicely complements some of the existing methods in this direction .",
    "another line of research that is related to our own is to characterise ( non - local ) quantum correlations given assumptions made about the dimension of the hilbert space for one of the parties @xcite .",
    "this assumption of limiting the dimension is a relaxation of the assumption that devices in one of the parties laboratories are trusted .",
    "these works are relevant for _ semi - device - independent quantum cryptography _ and _ device - independent dimension witnesses _",
    "@xcite    in sec .",
    "[ sec1 ] we outline the general framework , introduce cst and ast and introduce the methods which will be relevant .",
    "given our framework , in sec .",
    "[ sec2 ] we demonstrate how to self - test the maximally entangled two - qubit state and give analytical and numerical results demonstrating an improvement over conventional rst . in sec .",
    "[ sec3 ] we briefly discuss the self - testing of multi - partite states and give numerical results showing how the ghz state can be self - tested .",
    "we also discuss how one could exploit tensor product structure on the trusted side to aid self - testing .",
    "we conclude with some general discussion in sec .",
    "in this section we introduce the framework in which our results will be cast . for brevity we will restrict ourselves to the case of two parties each with access to some devices . in sec .",
    "[ sec3 ] we will extend the framework to more - than - two parties . in our setting",
    "( see fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1 ] ) , one of the parties is the client and the other is the provider and the two of them share both quantum and classical communication channels and all devices are assumed to be quantum mechanical .",
    "therefore we can associate the parties with the finite - dimensional hilbert spaces @xmath3 and @xmath4 for the client and provider respectively .",
    "the quantum communication channel is used to send a quantum system from the provider to the client and the client will then perform tomography on this part of the state . after the provider has communicated a quantum system , there will be some joint quantum system and the client can now ask the provider ( using the classical communication channel ) to perform measurements on their share of the system ; the outcome is then communicated to the client .     and generate an outcome labelled by @xmath5 all the while treating the provider s measurement device and the source as a black box .",
    "the dotted lines denote classical channels , while full lines represents a quantum channel.[fig : fig1],scaledwidth=33.0% ]    in this work we assume that the provider gives the client arbitrarily many copies of the subsystem such that they can do perfect tomography on their quantum system",
    ". we will not consider complications introduced by only having access to finitely many systems .",
    "this is a standard assumption in many works on self - testing and we will comment on relaxing this assumption in sec .",
    "[ sec4 ] .    after the provider sends a quantum system to the client they share a quantum state @xmath6 , a density matrix acting on the hilbert space @xmath7 .",
    "crucially , in our work , the dimension of the hilbert space @xmath3 is known but the space @xmath4 can have an unrestricted dimension since we do not , in general , trust the provider .",
    "therefore , without loss of generality , the density matrix @xmath8 is associated with a pure state @xmath9 since we can always dilate the space @xmath4 to find an appropriate purification .    after establishing the shared state @xmath10",
    ", the client asks the provider to perform a measurement from a choice of possible measurements .",
    "these measurements are labelled by a symbol @xmath11 if there are @xmath12 possible choices of measurement . for each measurement",
    ", there are @xmath13 possible outcomes labelled by the symbol @xmath14 .",
    "the client then communicates a value of @xmath15 to the provider and then receives a value of @xmath5 from the provider .",
    "again , since the dimension of @xmath4 is unrestricted , we assume that the measurement made by the provider has outcomes that are associated with projectors @xmath16 such that @xmath17 and @xmath18 .",
    "conditioned on each measurement outcome @xmath5 given the choice @xmath15 , the client performs state tomography on their part of the state @xmath10 which can be described in terms of the operators @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the identity operator acting on @xmath3 and @xmath21 is the partial trace over the provider s system . an _",
    "assemblage _ is then the set @xmath22 with elements satisfying @xmath23 , the reduced state of the client s system .",
    "one can extract the probability @xmath24 of the provider s measurement outcome @xmath5 for the choice @xmath15 by taking @xmath25 .    instead of studying the assemblage directly",
    ", we may simplify matters by considering the _ correlations _ between the client and provider where both parties make measurements and look at the conditional probabilities @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the client s choice of measurement and @xmath28 the outcome for that choice .",
    "if the measurement made by the client is described in terms of the generalised measurement elements @xmath29 such that @xmath30 then these correlations can be readily obtained from elements of the assemblage as @xmath31 .    in self - testing",
    ", the provider claims that they are manufacturing a particular state @xmath32 and performing particular ( projective ) measurements @xmath33 on @xmath34 .",
    "we call this combination of state and measurements the _ reference experiment _ to distinguish it from the physical experiment where @xmath10 and @xmath35 are the state and measurements respectively . since we do not have direct access to the hilbert space of the provider it is possible that they are manufacturing something different that has no observable effect on experimental outcomes . for example",
    ", they could prepare the state @xmath36 and retain the system in state @xmath37 but never perform any operation on it .",
    "this will not affect the assemblage so we must allow for operations on the provider s system in @xmath4 that leave assemblages unaffected .",
    "following the discussion by mckague and mosca , some of these changes include @xcite :    1 .   unitary change of basis in @xmath4 2 .",
    "adding ancillae @xmath38 to physical systems ( in tensor product ) upon which measurements do not act , i.e. @xmath39 3 .   altering the measurements @xmath35 outside the support of the state @xmath10 4 .   embedding the state @xmath9 and measurements @xmath35 into a hilbert space @xmath40 where @xmath41 has a different dimension to @xmath4 .    allowing for these possible transformations we need an appropriate notion of equivalence between the physical experiment and the reference experiment .",
    "we say that the physical experiment associated with the state @xmath10 and measurements @xmath35 are equivalent to the reference experiment associated with the state @xmath42 and measurements @xmath33 if there exists an isometry @xmath43 such that @xmath44 for all @xmath5 , @xmath15 and @xmath45 .",
    "a consequence of this notion of equivalence is that if a physical experiment is equivalent to the reference experiment then the former can be constructed from the latter by the operations described above . in the other direction , if the provider does indeed construct the reference experiment and then performs one of the transformations listed above then an isometry can always be constructed to establish equivalence between the physical and reference experiments .",
    "an important issue in self - testing based on probabilities is that experimental probabilities are invariant upon taking the complex conjugate of both the state and measurements .",
    "thus , the best one can hope for in this kind of self - testing is to certify the presence of a probabilistic mixture of the reference experiment and its complex conjugate . due to this deficiency and the fact that complex conjugation is not a physical operation , only purely real reference experiments can be properly self - tested . in the introduction we gave an overview of the known results in self - testing and",
    "indeed all the states and measurements which allow for self - testing have a purely real representation ( @xcite-@xcite,@xcite ) . in ref .",
    "@xcite the authors deal more rigorously with the problem and even show that for some cryptographic purposes self - testing of the reference experiment involving complex measurements does not undermine security .",
    "we note in appendix [ app1 ] that for our work we may not need to restrict to purely real reference experiments : an assemblage is not typically invariant under taking the complex conjugate of both the state and measurements . for simplicity we will study experiments with states and measurements that have real coefficients but note that an advantage of basing self - testing on epr - steering eliminates the restriction to only real coefficients .",
    "however , for an arbitrary physical experiment there may exist operations not included in the list above that leave the assemblage and reduced state unchanged .",
    "the essence of self - testing based on an assemblage and reduced state is to establish that the only operations a provider can perform that leave it unchanged are those described above .      given our formalism , the self - testing of quantum states is rendered extremely easy due to the purification principle : every density matrix @xmath46 on some system @xmath47 can result as the marginal state of some bipartite pure state @xmath48 on the joint system @xmath49 such that @xmath50 , and this pure state is uniquely defined up to an isometry on system @xmath51 .",
    "therefore , in our formalism , we can observe that given a reduced state @xmath52 we can describe the state @xmath10 upto an isometry on provider s system . in particular , due to the schmidt decomposition of the reduced state @xmath53 ( such that @xmath54 and @xmath55 for all @xmath56 ) we have a purification of the form : @xmath57 where @xmath58 ( @xmath59 ) is some set of orthogonal states in @xmath3 ( @xmath4 ) .",
    "the local isometry @xmath43 then maps the set ( @xmath59 ) to another set of orthogonal states ( @xmath60 ) .    as a consequence of our formalism",
    ", we can establish that @xmath42 and @xmath10 are equivalent solely by checking to see if the reduced state @xmath61 is equal to the reduced state @xmath52 . another obvious consequence for entanglement verification between the client and provider",
    "is that they share some entanglement if and only if @xmath62 is mixed .",
    "this is purely a consequence of the assumption that they share a pure state .",
    "indeed , it is cryptographically well - motivated to say that the provider produces a pure state since this gives the provider _ maximal information _ about the devices that are used in a protocol .",
    "even though self - testing of states is rendered easy by our assumptions , the self - testing of measurements does not follow from only looking at the reduced state @xmath63 .",
    "in other words , knowing the global pure @xmath10 from the reduced state @xmath63 , does not immediately imply that the provider is making the required measurements on a useful part of that pure state .",
    "it should be emphasized that in any one - sided device - independent quantum information protocol , measurements will be made on a state in any task to extract classical information from the systems , both trusted and untrusted .",
    "the self - testing of measurements made by an untrusted agent is , as explicitly stated in eq .",
    ", crucial .",
    "we give a simple example to illustrate this point .",
    "this is an example of a physical system that a provider can prepare and a measurement they can perform .    establishing that the client and provider share a state that is equivalent to a reference state is not immediately useful .",
    "consider the situation where the provider prepares the state @xmath64 where the subscripts @xmath65 and @xmath66 label two qubits that the provider retains and sends the qubit with the subscript @xmath67 to the client .",
    "the two qubits labelled by @xmath65 and @xmath66 can be jointly measured or individually measured . in this example",
    "the provider s measurement solely consists of measuring qubit @xmath66 and ignoring qubit @xmath65 such that measurement projectors are of the form @xmath68 .",
    "therefore , the reduced state of the client is @xmath69 which indicates that the client and provider share a maximally entangled state .",
    "however , every element of the assemblage @xmath22 is @xmath70 , and thus unaffected by any measurement performed by the provider .",
    "therefore we can not say anything about the provider s measurements and , furthermore , the entanglement is not being utilised by the provider and will thus not be useful for any quantum information task .",
    "this example just highlights that in our scenario it only makes sense to establish equivalence between a physical experiment and reference experiment taking into account _ both the state and measurements_. the example motivates the need to study the assemblage generated in our scenario and not just the reduced state .",
    "also , as will be shown later , this allows us to construct explicit isometries demonstrating equivalence between a physical and reference experiment instead of just knowing that such an isometry exists . in colloquial terms , being able to explicitly construct an isometry allows one to be able to  locate \" their desired state within the physical state .",
    "so far we have assumed perfect equivalence between the reference and physical experiment as described by eqs . .",
    "[ secrob ] we extend our discussion to the case where equivalence can be established approximately which is known as robust self - testing . instead of using the reduced state of the client and assemblage",
    ", we may wish to study self - testing given the correlations resulting from measurements on the assemblage and we discuss this in sec .",
    "[ seccor ] .      in this section",
    "we formally introduce _ robust assemblage - based one - sided self - testing _ ( ast ) and indicate its advantages and limitations . before this",
    "we need to recall some mathematical notation in order to discuss  robustness \" .",
    "we need an appropriate distance measure between operators acting on a hilbert space . to facilitate this",
    "we will use the schatten @xmath71-norm @xmath72 for @xmath73 being a linear operator acting on @xmath74 .",
    "this norm is directly related to @xmath75 , the _ trace distance _ between quantum states since @xmath76 for @xmath77 , @xmath78 .",
    "equivalently , @xmath79 where @xmath80 is the @xmath56th eigenvalue of the operator @xmath81 .",
    "another property of the trace distance is that when @xmath82 and @xmath83 are pure then @xmath84 @xcite .",
    "the motivation for introducing a distance measure is clear when we consider imperfect experiments .",
    "that is , if our physical experiment deviates from the predictions of our reference experiment by a small amount can we be sure that our physical experiment is ( up to a local isometry on @xmath4 ) close ( in the trace distance ) to our reference experiment ?",
    "now we can utilise the trace distance to describe closeness between the physical state @xmath10 and reference state @xmath42 . to whit , if @xmath85 where @xmath61 and allowing for isometries @xmath86 on the provider s side , then the minimal distance between physical and reference states will be the minimal value of @xmath87 for @xmath88 .",
    "clearly , @xmath89 since the trace distance does not increase when tracing out the provider s sub - system .",
    "this lower bound on the distance in eq .",
    "[ distance ] does not tell us that there is an isometry achieving this bound .",
    "we wish to be able to state that there exists an isometry for which the distance in eq .",
    "furthermore it would be preferable to be able to construct this isometry .",
    "this is , in essence , robust self - testing .",
    "we now formalise this intuition in the following definition :    given a reference experiment consisting of the state @xmath90 with reduced state @xmath63 and measurements @xmath33 such that the assemblage @xmath91 has elements @xmath92 , @xmath93 @xmath5 , @xmath15 .",
    "also given a physical experiment with the state @xmath9 , reduced state @xmath62 and measurements @xmath35 such that the assemblage @xmath22 has elements @xmath94 , @xmath93 @xmath5 , @xmath15 .",

    "note also that , in this definition , we only ask for the existence of an isometry .",
    "later , in sec . [ sec2 ] , we will construct an isometry for robust self - testing which will be more useful for various protocols .",
    "also , for this definition to be useful , a desirable function would be @xmath102 where @xmath103 is upper - bounded by a small positive integer .",
    "if @xmath104 , as mentioned earlier this establishes a lower bound on the distance between physical and reference experiments , and so the ideal case would be @xmath105-ast .",
    "we now give a simple example to show that , in general , this ideal case is not obtainable .",
    "the client has a three - dimensional hilbert space @xmath3 .",
    "the reference experiment consists of the state @xmath106 with measurements @xmath107 and @xmath108 where @xmath34 is a two - dimensional hilbert space .",
    "the assemblage for this reference experiment has the following elements : @xmath109 the physical experiment consists of the state @xmath110 where @xmath111 and the subscript @xmath112 denotes a second qubit that the provider has in their possession .",

    "we introduce the notation @xmath122 for the ancillae that the provider can introduce and @xmath123 as the unitary that they can perform jointly on the ancillae and their share of the physical state @xmath10 .",
    "this then gives us : @xmath124 where @xmath125 where @xmath20 is the identity on the client s system . thus maximizing this quantity for all isometries , we obtain the maximal value @xmath126 and the lower bound @xmath127 .",
    "this example excludes the possibility of having @xmath105-ast given that the client s hilbert space is three - dimensional .",
    "we will later return to this reference experiment in sec .",
    "[ sec2a ] with the modification that the client s hilbert space is two - dimensional .",
    "as outlined earlier , epr - steering can be studied from the point - of - view of the probabilities obtained from measurements performed on elements of an assemblage , i.e. known measurements made by the trusted party .",
    "this point - of - view is native to bell non - locality and is suitable for making further parallels between non - locality and epr - steering . in this regard",
    "one can construct epr - steering inequalities ( the epr - steering analogues of bell inequalities ) which can be written as a linear combination of the measurement probabilities @xcite .",
    "the two figures - of - merit , assemblages and measurement correlations , lead to a certain duality in the theory of epr steering .",
    "the approach that one will use depends on the underlying scenario . in the case",
    "when correlations are obtained by performing a tomographically complete set of measurements ( on the trusted system ) the two approaches become completely equivalent . however , in some cases probabilities obtained by performing a tomographically incomplete set of measurements , or even just the amount of violation of some steering inequality can provide all necessary information .",
    "another possibility is that a trusted party can perform only two measurements and nothing more , i.e. has no resources to perform complete tomography . in this section",
    "we consider the definition and utility of defining robust self - testing with respect to these probabilities for an appropriate notion of robustness .",
    "this approach to self - testing is not immediately equivalent to the notion of ast defined previously ( even if tomographically complete measurements are made ) for reasons that will be become clear .",
    "recall the probabilities @xmath128 for @xmath29 being elements of general measurement associated with the outcome @xmath129 for measurement choice @xmath130 such that @xmath30 .",
    "naturally , we can also obtain the probabilities @xmath131 .",
    "in addition to the  physical probabilities \" @xmath26 , we have the  reference probabilities \" @xmath132 which refer to the probabilities resulting from making the same measurements @xmath133 on a reference assemblage @xmath134 as described above . performing robust self - testing given these probabilities",
    "will be the focus of this section .",
    "a useful definition of the schatten @xmath71-norm is @xmath135 where @xmath136 is the operator norm . since @xmath29 is a positive operator with operator norm upper bounded by @xmath71 and",
    "if @xmath137 and for all elements @xmath138 of an assemblage @xmath97 we can conclude that @xmath139\\vert\\leq\\vert \\tilde{\\sigma}_{a|x}-\\sigma_{a|x}\\vert_{1}\\leq\\epsilon,\\nonumber\\\\ \\vert p(b|y)-\\tilde{p}(b|y)\\vert&=\\vert \\textrm{tr}\\left[f_{b|y}\\left(\\rho_{c}-\\tilde{\\rho}_{c}\\right)\\right]\\vert\\leq2d(\\rho_{c},\\tilde{\\rho}_{c})\\leq 2\\epsilon\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] for all @xmath5 , @xmath129 , @xmath15 , @xmath130 .",

    "this may hint that multi - partite epr - steering behaves quite differently to quantum non - locality .",

    "we now remark that epr - steering offers a useful simplification in achieving the same task of identifying a tensor product structure .",
