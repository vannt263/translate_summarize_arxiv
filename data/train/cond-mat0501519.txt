    "the thermoelectric power , @xmath5 , of intermetallic compounds with cerium and ytterbium ions exhibits some characteristic features which allow the classification of these compounds . into several distinct groups.@xcite in the case of cerium ions ,",
    "the thermopower of the compounds belonging to the first group ( type ( a ) systems ) has a deep negative minimum at low temperatures @xcite and a high - temperature maximum , typically between 100 k and 300 k. at the maximum , @xmath5 could be either positive or negative , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : tepall ] . at very low temperatures , the type ( a ) systems order magnetically or become superconducting .",
    "the compounds of the second group ( type ( b ) systems ) have a negative low - temperature minimum and a positive high - temperature maximum but , in addition , the thermopower shows a smaller positive peak at lowest temperatures.@xcite this second peak is sometimes concealed by a low - temperature phase transition ; for example , in cecu@xmath4si@xmath4 it becomes visible only in an external magnetic field which suppresses the superconducting transition,@xcite and in ceru@xmath3ge@xmath4   it shows up when the external pressure suppresses the magnetic transition.@xcite the experimental evidence is now accumulating that the initial slope of the thermopower @xmath6 is positive for this class of ( heavy fermion ) materials , provided the measurements are performed at low enough temperature and with sufficient accuracy.@xcite in the third group ( type ( c ) systems ) , the low - temperature peak is well pronounced and shifted towards the high - temperature peak .",
    "the main difference with respect to the type ( b ) systems is that the sign - change of @xmath5 does not occur.@xcite finally , in some cases ( type ( d ) systems ) the thermopower grows monotonically towards the high - temperature maximum , and the low - temperature structure appears only as a shoulder on a broad peak , or is not resolved at all .",
    "@xcite    the clue to these various types of behavior comes from the high - pressure@xcite and doping studies , @xcite which show that the thermopower of cerium compounds changes continuously from type ( a ) to type ( d ) .",
    "a typical example is provided by the @xmath5 of ceru@xmath3ge@xmath4 , which is plotted in fig.[fig : tepall ] as a function of temperature , for various pressures.@xcite at ambient pressure , ceru@xmath3ge@xmath4  is a type ( a ) system with a magnetic ground state and negative thermopower below 300 k. an increase of pressure leads to a thermopower with a small positive peak at low temperatures and an enhanced peak at high temperatures .",
    "a further increase of pressure enhances both peaks , shifts the low - temperature peak towards the high - temperature one , and makes the thermopower at intermediate temperatures less negative . for large enough pressure",
    ", the sign - change does not occur at all and for very high pressure the low - temperature peak merges with the high - temperature one , and transforms into a shoulder ( see inset to fig .",
    "[ fig : tepall ] ) .",
    "the high - temperature peak grows continuously but its position remains more or less constant , as @xmath5 changes from type ( a ) to ( c ) . eventually , for pressures above 10 gpa , the @xmath5 assumes the ( d ) shape .",
    "here , the initial slope of @xmath5 decreases and the position of the maximum shifts to higher temperatures , but its magnitude does not change as pressure increases . similar behavior is also seen in the high - pressure data of , cecu@xmath3si@xmath4,@xcite cecu@xmath4ge@xmath4,@xcite or cepd@xmath4si@xmath4.@xcite as regards doping , the substitutions which reduce the volume and make ce ions less magnetic , transform @xmath5 from type ( a ) to type ( b),@xcite from ( b ) to ( c),@xcite or from ( a ) to(c),@xcite while the substitutions which expand the volume and make the ce more magnetic , transform the thermopower from , say , type ( d ) to type ( c ) or from type ( c ) to type ( b).@xcite this variation of shape is an indication that the local environment plays an important role in determining the magnetic character of ce and yb ions . even at high temperatures , where each 4_f _ ion is an independent scatterer ,",
    "the thermopower of a sample with a high concentration of 4_f _ ions can not be obtained by rescaling the low - concentration data .",
    "the ytterbium intermetallics can be classified using the mirror - image analogy with cerium systems .",
    "this holds because the yb ions fluctuate between 4_f_@xmath7 and 4_f_@xmath8 , while the ce ions fluctuate between 4_f_@xmath9 and 4 _ f_@xmath10 configurations , and the dynamics of a single _ f _ hole and a single _ f _ electron is the same .",
    "a well - defined local moment leads in yb systems to the type ( a ) behavior , such that the thermopower has a negative minimum at high temperatures and a positive maximum at low temperatures;@xcite the size of the minimum is about the same as the size of the maximum .",
    "the thermopower of ( b)-type yb systems@xcite mirrors the ( b)-type ce systems . here , one finds two negative minima separated by a small positive maximum .",
    "the type ( c ) yb systems have a nonmonotonic thermopower with a large ( negative ) minimum at high temperatures and a smaller one at low temperatures , but there is no sign - change.@xcite finally , the thermopower with a single negative peak centered around 100 k @xcite mirrors the type ( d ) behavior of ce systems .",
    "the reduction of volume by pressure or doping@xcite stabilizes the magnetic @xmath11 configuration of yb ions , and transforms @xmath5 from , say , type ( b ) to type ( a ) , from ( c ) to ( b ) , or from ( c ) to ( a ) .",
    "the experimental results show that 4_f _ systems with similar thermopowers exhibit similarities in other thermodynamic@xcite and transport@xcite properties , and there is an obvious correlation between the shape of @xmath5 and the magnetic character of the 4_f _ ions .",
    "the thermopower measurements provide a simple and sensitive tool for characterizing the magnetic state of a 4_f _ ion in a given metallic matrix : the shape of @xmath5 changes from the ( a)-type in the case of magnetic ce ( yb ) ions with stable f@xmath12 ( 4_f_@xmath7 ) configuration to the ( d)-type for non - magnetic ce ( yb ) ions which fluctuate between the 4_f_@xmath12 ( 4_f_@xmath7 ) and 4_f_@xmath13 ( 4_f_@xmath8 ) configurations .",
    "we explain the thermoelectric properties of ce and yb ions in terms of a single - impurity anderson model which takes into account the splitting of the 4_f _ states by the crystalline electric field ( cf ) , and assumes an infinitely large _",
    "f  f _ coulomb repulsion , which restricts the number of _ f _ electrons or _",
    "f _ holes to @xmath0 for ce and @xmath1 for yb .",
    "we assume that pressure changes the coupling and the relative occupation of the _ f _ and conduction states , and impose the charge - neutrality constraint on the local scattering problem at each temperature and pressure .",
    "the total charge conservation provides a minimal self - consistency condition for a poor - man s treatment of pressure effects in stoichiometric compounds .",
    "the excitation spectrum of such a model in the vicinity of various fixed points , the crossovers induced by temperature and pressure , and the corresponding effects on @xmath5 , the number of _ f _ particles , @xmath14 , and the electrical resistance , @xmath15 , are calculated by the non - crossing approximation ( nca ) .",
    "the description of the stoichiometric compounds in terms of an impurity model is certainly inadequate at low temperatures where the _ f _ electrons become coherent .",
    "the errors due to such an approximation and the low - temperature errors inherent in the nca calculations are discussed in detail at the end of sec .",
    "[ theoretical description ] .",
    "our paper extends the long - standing theory of coqblin , @xcite which described the high - temperature properties of ce and yb intermetallics by the coqblin - schrieffer ( cs ) model with cf splitting , and its more recent version@xcite which improved the low - temperature calculations by rescaling the coupling constants .",
    "these previous theories explained the main features of the temperature dependence of the thermopower@xcite and the magnetic susceptibility@xcite but could not describe the pressure effects , because the cs model neglects charge fluctuations .",
    "furthermore , the approximations used to solve the effective high- and low - temperature models cease to be valid at temperatures at which @xmath5 changes sign,@xcite such that the shape of @xmath5 between the two maxima ( minima ) in ce ( yb ) systems could only be inferred from an interpolation .    here , we consider both the local _ spin _ and _ charge _ fluctuations , and provide the full description of the impurity problem at various pressures and temperatures , from above the cf temperature to below the kondo temperature , including the intermediate regime where @xmath5 changes sign .",
    "our results explain the shapes ( a ) to ( d ) of the thermopower , which are found in the systems like ceal@xmath16,@xcite ceru@xmath3ge@xmath4 , @xcite cecu@xmath3si@xmath4,@xcite cecu@xmath4ge@xmath4,@xcite or cepd@xmath4si@xmath4 , @xcite and the mirror - image shapes found in systems like ybnisn , yninau@xmath4 , ybsi or ybcu@xmath4si@xmath4.@xcite we also explain the pressure data like on ceru@xmath3ge@xmath4@xcite or cecu@xmath3si@xmath4,@xcite and the chemical pressure data on ce@xmath17la@xmath18pdsn @xcite and ce@xmath17la@xmath18ru@xmath3si@xmath4@xcite or ybcu@xmath4si@xmath4.@xcite    the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ theoretical description ] we introduce the model , discuss its limitations , and describe the method of solution . in sec .",
    "[ results ] we provide the results for the transport coefficients of ce- and yb - based intermetallics . in sec .",
    "[ discussion ] we discuss the effects of temperature and pressure on the spectral function , analyze the fixed - point behavior , and relate the shapes of the thermopower to the properties of elementary excitations .",
    "[ conclusions ] , gives the summary and the conclusions .",
    "we model the intermetallic compounds by taking as many ce or yb ions per unit cell as required by the structure , but assuming that the scattering of conduction electrons on a given 4_f _ ion does not depend on other 4_f _ ions , except through the modification of the chemical potential . in other words",
    ", we consider an effective impurity model which treats the 4_f _ states as scattering resonances rather than bloch states but take into account the charge transfer due to the local scattering and adjust the chemical potential , @xmath19 , so as to maintain the overall charge neutrality of the compound .",
    "such a description of the lattice problem applies at temperatures at which the mean free path of the conduction electrons is short and the scattering is incoherent .",
    "we consider mainly the ce intermetallics and present only a few preliminary results for yb intermetallics .",
    "the cerium ions are allowed to fluctuate between the 4_f_@xmath13 and 4_f_@xmath12 configurations by exchanging electrons with the conduction band ; the ( average ) energy difference between the two configurations is @xmath20 and the hopping is characterized by the matrix element @xmath21 .",
    "the 4_f_@xmath22 configuration is excluded , i.e. , an infinitely strong coulomb repulsion @xmath23 between _ f _ electrons is assumed .",
    "the 4_f_@xmath12 configuration is represented by @xmath24 crystal field levels : there are @xmath25 excited states separated from the cf ground level by energies @xmath26 , where @xmath27 .",
    "the local symmetry is taken into account by specifying the respective degeneracies of these levels , @xmath28 .",
    "thus , the low - energy excitations of ce intermetallics are modeled by an effective single - impurity anderson hamiltonian,@xcite @xmath29 where @xmath30 describes the conduction band , @xmath31 describes the cf states , and @xmath32 describes the transfer of electrons between 4_f _ and conduction states . in the absence of mixing ,",
    "the conduction band is described by a semielliptical density of states , @xmath33 , centered at @xmath34 and of half - width @xmath35 , and the unrenormalized _ f _ states are represented by a set of delta functions at @xmath36 and @xmath37 .",
    "the conduction states and the @xmath38 states have a common chemical potential , which is taken as the origin of the energy axis .",
    "the properties of the model depend in an essential way on the cf splittings and on the coupling constant @xmath39 , where @xmath40 measures the coupling strength between the _ f _ electrons and the conduction band , @xmath41 , and @xmath42 is the total degeneracy .",
    "we assume @xmath43 , @xmath44 , and @xmath45 limit of the anderson model is controlled by several fixed points which are well understood.@xcite in the case of a ce ion with two cf levels split by @xmath46 , the fixed point analysis can be summarized as follows . at small coupling , such that @xmath47 , we find @xmath48 and the model exhibits the kondo effect .",
    "that is , all the physical properties depend only on the kondo temperature , @xmath49 , which is uniquely determined by @xmath50 , @xmath46 , and the degeneracies of the cf states ( for the nca definition of @xmath49 see ref .",
    "@xcite and sec.[discussion ] below ) .",
    "the low - temperature behavior is characterized by the fermi liquid ( fl ) fixed point , which describes a singlet formed by an antiferromagnetically coupled _ f _ electron and conduction electron .",
    "an increase of temperature breaks the singlet and gives rise , at about @xmath49 , to a transition to the local moment ( lm ) fixed point , which describes a cf - split _ f _ state weakly coupled to the conduction band .",
    "the effective degeneracy of this _ f _ state is defined by the lowest cf level . for @xmath51 , there is a further crossover to another lm fixed point , which describes the scattering of conduction electrons on a fully degenerate local moment . at higher coupling , such that @xmath52 , the _ f _ charge is reduced to @xmath53 , and the impurity still behaves as a kondo ion , but the kondo scale is much higher than in the case @xmath54 .",
    "the two lm regimes are now close together and the crossover from the fl to the lm regime occurs at temperatures which are comparable to @xmath46 . at very high coupling ,",
    "such that @xmath55 and @xmath56 , the _ f _ ions appear to be non - magnetic at all accessible temperatures due to the mixing of the 4_f_@xmath13 and 4_f_@xmath12 configurations . in this valence",
    "fluctuating ( vf ) regime , the behavior is non - universal and changes slightly , when the calculations are performed for different sets of parameters .",
    "away from @xmath57 , more than one energy scale is needed to fully characterize the model .",
    "other cf schemes pertinent to ce and yb ions in a different environment are characterized by similar fixed points .",
    "our calculations show that the functional form of the response functions changes at the crossover and that the @xmath58 limit of the anderson model captures all the main features of the experimental results on ce and yb intermetallics .",
    "to explain the pressure effects , which changes the thermopower of ce and yb systems in opposite ways , we assume that the exchange coupling @xmath50 increases in ce and diminishes in yb compounds , as pressure increases . this difference arises because ce fluctuates between 4_f_@xmath10 and 4_f_@xmath9 , while yb fluctuates between 4_f_@xmath8 and 4_f_@xmath7 configurations , so that the pressure - induced reduction of the number of electrons in the _ f_-shell makes ce ions less magnetic and yb ions more magnetic .    in ce intermetallics",
    ", there is a substantial overlap between the _ f _ wave functions of ce and those of the neighboring atoms , and we associate the pressure - induced increase of @xmath59 with an enhancement of the hybridization @xmath60 .",
    "this enhances the kondo temperature , and pushes the system from the kondo to the vf limit . in stoichiometric compounds , the pressure - induced reduction of @xmath61",
    "is accompanied by the increase of @xmath62 , because the total charge of a given compound , @xmath63 , is constant .",
    "the conservation of particles is enforced by adjusting @xmath19 , and since all the energies are measured with respect to @xmath19 , this amounts to shifting @xmath64 and @xmath65 by some amount @xmath66 .",
    "thus , we describe the pressure effects for a given ce compound by changing @xmath60 and keeping @xmath67 constant .",
    "the changes in the band - width and the cf splitting are neglected .    in yb",
    "intermetallics , the _ f _ states are more localized than in ce systems , and we assume that the decrease in the radius of the 4_f _ shell as it loses charge at elevated pressure is sufficient to compensate for the increase in hybridization brought about by the reduction in unit cell volume .",
    "the reduction of @xmath59 in yb compounds is achieved through an enhancement of the hole binding energy @xmath64 as the neighbouring ions get closer to the rare earth , while @xmath60 remains essentially constant .",
    "this reduces the kondo temperature , and drives the system towards the kondo limit . since @xmath60 is treated as a material - specific constant , we model the pressure effects in yb systems by shifting @xmath64 and solving for @xmath65 , so as to preserve @xmath68 .",
    "this procedure shifts @xmath64 and @xmath65 by different amounts and makes the separation @xmath67 pressure dependent .",
    "however , when temperature is changed at constant pressure , the charge neutrality is enforced in the same way as for ce compounds , by shifting the chemical potential without changing the separation @xmath67 .",
    "the changes in the bandwidth and the cf splitting are neglected .",
    "describing the pressure effects in such a way , we can calculate the response functions of the model for any value of the external parameters , and study the transitions between various fixed points .",
    "the electrical resistivity and the thermopower of the single - impurity anderson model are obtained from the usual expressions,@xcite @xmath69 @xmath70 where @xmath71 and @xmath72 are given by the static limits of the current - current and current - heat current correlation functions , respectively . in the absence of nonresonant scattering",

    "f_-electron spectral function , @xmath79 is the green s function , and @xmath80 is the concentration of _ f _ ions .",
    "eqs.([eq : lij_final ] ) and ( [ eq : tau ] ) show clearly that the sign and the magnitude of @xmath5 are determined by the spectral weight within the fermi window ( f window ) , i.e. , by the shape of @xmath81 for @xmath82 .",
    "the sign of @xmath5 is positive if the f window shows more states above than below the chemical potential , and is negative in the opposite case .",
    "the difficult part is to find @xmath83 and , here , we solve this problem by the nca , following closely refs .",
    "@xcite , where all the technical details can be found .",
    "the main difference with respect to these nca calculations is that we take @xmath84 and enforce the overall charge neutrality .",
    "a detailed comparison with the experimental data shows that the transport coefficients obtained from the single - impurity anderson model have all the hallmarks of the experiments , but discrepancies appear at low temperatures .",
    "this indicates the limitations of our approach which should be considered before presenting the nca results .",
    "there are two main causes for the breakdown of the single - impurity model and the nca calculations .",
    "first , at temperatures much below @xmath49 the nca spectral function develops an unphysical spike , such that the resistivity and the thermopower become artificially enhanced .",
    "this error becomes particularly severe at high pressure , because the characteristic scale @xmath49 increases very rapidly with @xmath60 and the non - analytic nca spike appears at rather high temperatures . the unphysical enhancement of the low - frequency part of @xmath81 reduces the integral for @xmath85 , which is strongly underestimated at low - temperature .",
    "the integral @xmath86 is less affected by this pathology , because it has an additional @xmath87 factor which removes the states within the fermi window .",
    "thus , the overall shape of @xmath88 seems to be qualitatively correct , even though the low - temperature part of the curve has an unphysical enhancement .",
    "these difficulties are well known  @xcite and relatively easy to resolve in the kondo limit , where the model has a unique low energy scale , @xmath49",
    ". we can find @xmath49 in the lm regime , where the nca is reliable , and infer the low - temperature behavior from the universal power laws which hold in the fl regime . combining the nca results and fl theory , we can discuss the experimental data at all temperatures at which the single - ion approximation holds .",
    "a more serious problem is that , in stoichiometric compounds , the _ f _ electrons become coherent at low enough temperatures .",
    "this leads to a magnetic transition in ceru@xmath3ge@xmath4 , the formation of a heavy fl in ceru@xmath3si@xmath4 , superconductivity in cecu@xmath3si@xmath4 , or some more complicated ground states . at high pressure ,",
    "the coherence sets in at very high temperatures , as revealed by low values of the electrical resistance .",
    "the onset of coherence ( like the nca pathology ) has its main impact on the low - energy states , giving @xmath89 , so that the impurity result badly overestimates the low - temperature electrical resistance .",
    "however , the considerations for the periodic anderson model@xcite , or other models with on - site correlation@xcite , show that the integral for @xmath86 also contains an additional @xmath87 factor which reduces the contribution of the low - energy coherent states to @xmath86 , like in the single impurity case .",
    "thus , our results for @xmath5 provide a qualitative description of the experimental data at temperatures well below the onset of coherence , but the calculated values of @xmath5 around @xmath49 are overestimated .",
    "we mention also that the analysis of the doping effects in terms of  chemical pressure  is not complete , because doping might give rise to a charge transfer or change the character of the ground state , and that the mirror - image analogy between ce and yb systems holds for the resonant scattering but may be lost in the presence of any additional scattering channel . despite these drawbacks ,",
    "the nca solution of the anderson model provides a surprisingly accurate description for a large body of experimental data above the magnetic or superconducting transition temperature , and at low to moderate pressure .",
    "in this section we present the nca results for the transport coefficients , describe the thermopower and the electrical resistance due to ce ions in some detail , show the results for the _ f _ occupation , present a few preliminary results for the thermopower of yb , and compare our results with the experimental data .",
    "our strategy for ce intermetallics is to illustrate the behavior of one particular compound as a function of temperature at various pressures .",
    "the compound is characterized at ambient pressure and high temperature by an initial parameter set @xmath90 , where @xmath91 and @xmath92 are measured with respect to @xmath19 and the high - temperature limit is defined by temperature @xmath93 . for given values of @xmath60 and @xmath94 , we start the calculations at @xmath95 and find @xmath96 such that the total charge is the same as the one obtained for @xmath97 .",
    "( in the absence of coupling we have @xmath98 and obtain @xmath62 by integrating the unperturbed density of states . ) at high temperatures , the _ f_-state is almost decoupled from the conduction band , the renormalization of the parameters is small , and the numerics converge very fast .",
    "we then reduce the temperature , find the new shift @xmath99 ensuring the charge conservation , and calculate the response functions for the resulting values of @xmath65 and @xmath64 .",
    "this process is continued until the nca equations break down at @xmath100 . to model the same system at different pressure , we change @xmath60 , find again @xmath96 , and repeat the same procedure as at ambient pressure for @xmath101 .",
    "note , @xmath102 and @xmath67 are conserved at all temperatures and pressures .    as a numerical example we consider a semielliptical conduction band of half - width @xmath103 ev , centered at @xmath104 ev , and a _ f _ state split into a doublet and a quartet@xcite by the cf with @xmath105 ev .",
    "we take @xmath63=5.6301 electrons per ion ( 0.9383 electrons for each one of @xmath106 effective spin channels ) .",
    "the transport coefficients are calculated for the hybridization strength changing from 0.06 ev to 0.20 ev , i.e. , for @xmath60 varying from @xmath107 to @xmath108 .",
    "the single - particle excitation spectra corresponding to these parameters are discussed in sec .  [ discussion ] .",

    "exhibit all the shapes ( a ) to ( d ) found in the experimentas and give @xmath5 of the right magnitude , except at low temperatures where the calculated peak is too large with respect to the experimental data . as discussed already , the reason for this discrepancy is that the nca overestimates the fermi - level scattering rate for @xmath100 , and that we neglected the coherent scattering , which sets in at temperatures of the order of @xmath49 .",
