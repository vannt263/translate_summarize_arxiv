    "one of the most persistently made assumptions in the standard theory of ( bio)colloid stability is that of a uniform charge distribution on macromolecular surfaces @xcite .",
    "there are nevertheless many instances where charge patterns on macromolecular surfaces are inhomogeneous , exhibiting even a highly disordered spatial distribution . among most notable examples are surfactant - coated surfaces @xcite and random polyelectrolytes and polyampholytes @xcite .",
    "the macromolecular charge pattern in these systems is often frozen , or quenched , meaning that the charge distribution does not evolve after the assembly or fabrication of the material .",
    "this is the case if the interaction between the surface charge carriers and the surfaces is of a chemical nature involving interactions that far exceed the thermal energy scale @xmath0 .",
    "alternatively charge distributions can exhibit various degrees of annealing when interacting with other macromolecules in aqueous solutions as is , for example , the case for charge regulation of contact surfaces bearing weak acidic groups in aqueous solutions @xcite .",
    "recently it has also been realized that ultrahigh sensitivity experiments on casimir ( zero temperature and ideally polarizable surfaces ) and van der waals ( finite temperature and non - ideally polarizable surfaces ) interactions between surfaces _ in vacuo _",
    "@xcite can be properly understood only if one takes into account the disordered nature of charges on and within the interacting surfaces @xcite .",
    "possible causes of sample- and history - specific charge disorder in this case include the patch effect , where the variation of the local crystallographic axes of the exposed surface of a clean polycrystalline sample can lead to a variation of the local surface potential @xcite .",
    "amorphous films deposited on crystalline substrates can also show a similar type of surface charge disorder , showing a grain structure of dimensions sometimes larger than the thickness of the deposited surface film @xcite . on the other hand , adsorption of various contaminants can influence the nature and type of the surface charge disorder .",
    "since the nature and distribution of the charge disorder in any of the force experiments is in general seldom known , we pursue a strategy of assessing the consequences of different _ a priori _ models of the distribution of charge disorder .",
    "in what follows we will thus assume that the charge disorder stems from randomly distributed _",
    "monopolar charges _ which may be present both in the bulk and/or on the interacting surfaces and can be either annealed or quenched . in the quenched case ,",
    "the disorder charges are frozen , whereas in the annealed case , the disorder charges are subject to thermal fluctuations at ambient temperature and can thus adapt themselves in order to minimize the free energy of the system .",
    "we do not deal with effects due to disorder in the dielectric response of the interacting media @xcite , which presents an additional source of disorder meriting further study .",
    "we have shown in our previous works @xcite that the type and the nature of the charge disorder induces marked changes in the properties of the total interaction between apposed bodies and the force arising from the presence of disordered charges can dominate the underlying casimir ",
    "van der waals ( vdw ) effect at sufficiently large separations .",
    "the analysis of the _ interaction fingerprint _ of the charge disorder can be useful in assessing whether the experimentally observed interactions can be interpreted in terms of disorder effects or are due to pure casimir ",
    "vdw interactions . in this study",
    "we will continue with the assessment of this interaction fingerprint in the case two semi - infinite net - neutral dielectric slabs ( separated by a layer of vacuum or an arbitrary unstructured dielectric material as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : schematic ] ) , by generalizing our formalism to include two different mechanisms :    1 .",
    "the  patchy \" distribution of the charge disorder , which may arise due to finite correlations between the carriers of the charge disorder .",
    "this is a rather realistic assumption in view of the graininess observed in interacting surfaces @xcite .",
    "2 .   the dielectric inhomogeneity effects in highly asymmetric systems , where the two slabs and the intervening medium may in general have different dielectric properties .    for interacting bodies carrying no _ net _ charge , the part of the interaction due to monopolar _ quenched charge _ disorder can be seen from a full quantum field - theoretical formalism @xcite to be coupled directly to the zero - frequency or _ classical _ vdw interaction ( corresponding to the zero - frequency matsubara modes of the electromagnetic field ) .",
    "the situation would be more complicated in the case of annealed disorder if one is to account for the higher - order matsubara frequencies and a general treatment is missing at present . in this work , we shall examine the effects of quenched and annealed charge disorder by focusing specifically on the zero - frequency vdw interaction .",
    "it is well known that the higher frequency matsubara terms in the total vdw interaction free energy become relatively unimportant at sufficiently high temperatures and/or sufficiently large intersurface separations @xcite . in this paper",
    "we will restrict ourselves to this regime which is also most relevant experimentally @xcite and consider the short - distance quantum effects elsewhere @xcite .    as we shall demonstrate , the interplay and competition of the underlying vdw effect between the two semi - infinite slabs and the interaction induced by the charge disorder can give rise to a variety of different interaction profiles , including , most notably , _ non - monotonic _ interactions as a function of the inter - slab distance .",
    "in particular , when the two dielectrics interact across a medium of higher dielectric constant , the disorder force can become strongly repulsive and thus generate a potential barrier when combined with the vdw force , which is attractive in that case . while , in the situation where the intervening medium has a dielectric constant in between that of the two slabs @xcite , the disorder can generate an attractive force , which can balance the repulsive vdw force , leading thus to a stable bound state between the two dielectric slabs .",
    "therefore , the charge disorder , if present , can provide an intrinsic mechanism to stabilize interactions between net - neutral bodies .",
    "these features emerge because the disorder - induced interactions typically decay more weakly with the separation than the vdw interaction and depend strongly on the dielectric inhomogeneities in the system .",
    "the above features vary depending on whether the disorder is assumed to be quenched or annealed .",
    "the effects due to annealed charge disorder can be distinctly different from those of the quenched charge disorder .",
    "in the case of annealed charges , the effective interactions turn out to decay more rapidly and in fact in a similar way as the pure vdw interaction , whereas in the case of quenched charges the net interactions decay more weakly with the separation , i.e. , as @xmath1 where @xmath2 if the disorder is present in the bulk of the slabs and @xmath3 if the disorder is confined to the bounding surfaces of the slabs .",
    "the organization of the paper is as follows : in section [ sec : model ] , we introduce the details of our model and the formalism used in our study .",
    "the general results are derived in sections [ sec : quenched ] and [ sec : annealed ] for the case of quenched and annealed disorder , respectively .",
    "we shall proceed with the analysis of the effective interaction between two identical slabs in section [ sec : symmetric ] , where we shall focus mainly on the effects due to spatial correlation in the distribution of the charge disorder . in section [ sec : asymmetric ] , we study the interaction in dielectrically asymmetric systems by considering two dissimilar dielectric slabs that interact across an arbitrary dielectric medium .",
    "the results and limitations of our study are summarized in section [ sec : discussion ] .",

    "thus , while the vdw contribution depends on the product @xmath69 , the contribution from the quenched charge distribution in slab 1 depends on variance @xmath70 of the charge on the surface or bulk of this slab but on @xmath56 of the slab 2 .",
    "this leads to a rich phenomenology of possible net interactions .",

    "it thus demonstrates the intuitive fact that dielectric slabs with annealed charges tend to behave asymptotically in a way similar to perfect conductors .",
    "this is one of the distinctive features of the annealed disorder as compared with the quenched disorder , whose effects depend significantly on the material properties .",
    "the deviations due to material properties and the disorder variance in the annealed case contribute a repulsive subleading force in the symmetric case , which can be determined from a series expansion at large separations .",

[",
    "fig : fig4]a ) .",
    "the asymptotic behavior of the annealed force is similarly described by the pure vdw result ( [ eq : vdw ] ) and the ideal expression ( [ eq : metal ] ) even if the dielectric constant of the ( identical ) slabs is smaller than that of the intervening medium , @xmath153 . however , in this case , these two limiting results do not constitute the upper and lower bound limits for the total force as the force ratio @xmath154 exhibits a nonmonotonic behavior with a local minimum at some intermediate separation between the slabs ( fig .",
    "[ fig : fig4]b ) .",
    "the special case of a dielectrically homogeneous system , @xmath155 , constitutes another example where annealed and quenched disorder effects differ on a qualitative level and may thus be easily distinguished . in this case , the total force ( [ eq : force_quenched ] ) due to quenched disorder vanishes trivially at all separations , while the total force due to annealed disorder remains finite .",
    "since the vdw contribution vanishes in a dielectrically homogeneous system as well , the total force in this case comes purely from the electrostatic interactions of annealed charges in the two slabs ( fig .",
    "[ fig : fig5 ] ) .",

    ", the resulting fluctuation - induced interactions may exhibit qualitatively different features as compared with the fully symmetric case that we shall explore further in this section .",
    "let us first consider briefly the situation where the two slabs are dielectrically identical , @xmath156 ( @xmath157 ) , but bear different degrees of quenched or annealed monopolar charge disorder .",
    "for the sake of simplicity , let us assume that one slab is _ disorder free _ ( @xmath158 and @xmath159 ) , whereas the other slab contains disorder charges of bulk and surface variance @xmath160 and @xmath161 , and correlation lengths @xmath162 ( recall that in any case the net monopolar charge in each slab is taken to be zero ) .",
    "this case is particularly interesting because it shows the interconnection between the disorder and the dielectric inhomogeneity in the system . in the quenched case",

    "the value obtained in the fully symmetric case ( see eq .",
    "( [ eq : f0_fn ] ) ) in the previous section if we set @xmath163 , @xmath164 and @xmath165 ( the vdw contribution is the same in both cases ) .",
    "this result follows straightforwardly from the general quenched expressions ( [ eq : force_quenched ] ) or ( [ eq : f0_fn_app ] ) and again reflects the fact that the quenched contribution is basically due to the interaction of disorder charges with their image charges ( as these are the only ` charges ' with which they are ` correlated ' across the intervening gap ) .",
    "this is why the disorder forces in the quenched case depend essentially on the dielectric jump across the bounding surfaces as discussed before .",
    "a but for two dissimilar dielectric slabs in vacuum ( @xmath121 ) with one slab being _ disorder free _",
    "( @xmath166 , @xmath167 ) and the other slab containing _ annealed _ charge disorder of variance @xmath168 , @xmath169 .",

    "this lowers the _ magnitude _ of the maximum net force that can be achieved in this system as compared with the case where both slabs bear annealed charges ; the latter case is obviously more favorable thermodynamically as the system can achieve a lower free energy .",
    "the net annealed force in vacuum still falls between two well - defined limits as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig6 ] .",
    "the two bounding limits are given by @xmath174 where @xmath175 , eq . ( [ eq : vdw ] ) , is obtained in the limit of weak disorder or at small separations , and @xmath176 , defined as @xmath177 is obtained in the limit of strong disorder or large separation .",
    "thus , in marked contrast with the fully symmetric case , we find that the large - distance interaction here becomes non - universal and could be either attractive ( @xmath102 ) or repulsive ( @xmath120 ) .",
    "this points to the possibility of _ repulsive _ total forces in the annealed case that will be discussed in the following section .",
    "-1 cm        -1 cm        -1 cm      it is clear that the vdw force ( [ eq : vdw_full ] ) becomes _ repulsive _ when the dielectric constant of the intervening medium is between that of the two semi - infinite slabs , i.e. , @xmath178 ( such a case has been investigated experimentally in ref .",
    "@xcite ) . however ,",
    "in this case , the force stemming from the quenched charge disorder can be _ attractive _ and thus , if present , may compete against the repulsion due to the vdw forces . in order to investigate this situation further , let us first consider the case of an uncorrelated disorder by setting the disorder correlation lengths equal to zero . also without loss of generality , we assume that the slabs contain only quenched bulk disorder with equal variances @xmath179 in the two slabs .",
    "the net quenched force in this case reads @xmath180 where we have defined @xmath181 obviously , the contribution from bulk disorder ( second term in eq .",
    "( [ eq : quenched_1m2 ] ) ) can change sign as the dielectric constant @xmath182 is varied in the range @xmath178 , while the vdw term ( first term ) remains always repulsive .",
    "it is easy to see that for @xmath183 , we have @xmath184 and thus an attractive disorder force , and for @xmath185 , we have @xmath186 and thus a repulsive disorder force . this behavior is shown in fig . [",
    "fig : fig7]a , where @xmath187 , @xmath188 are fixed and @xmath20 varies in the range @xmath189 ( dashed curves from bottom ) . in accordance with our findings in the symmetric case , the large distance behavior is always dominated by the disorder contribution ( as the disorder force decays more weakly with the separation ) , while the repulsive vdw force in this case plays the role of a stabilizing force at small separations .",
    "the resulting effect is that the total force varies _ non - monotonically _ and vanishes at a finite distance , @xmath190 , between the two slabs given in the present case by @xmath191 this represents a stable ` equilibrium ' separation ( bound state ) between the two slabs corresponding to a minimum in the interaction free energy . on the other hand , the maximum attractive force due to the influence of quenched disorder",
    "is reached at a larger separation , @xmath192 these results may be used to optimize the thickness of the intervening medium in order to achieve the maximum or minimum force magnitude between the slabs .    in the presence of a correlated disorder ,",
    "the disorder - induced effects weaken ( section [ sec : symm_quenched ] ) and thus , as the disorder correlation is increased , the attractive tail as well as the stable bound state are gradually washed out as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig7]b .",
    "we find similar features when the disorder charges are annealed as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig7]c",
    ". however , in line with our finding in the symmetric case , the net force falls off more rapidly with the separation when the disorder charges are annealed .",
    "the large distance behavior coincides again with the universal expression ( [ eq : metal ] ) and can be much larger in magnitude than the pure vdw force ( [ eq : vdw_full ] ) when @xmath20 tends to the larger dielectric constant @xmath19 as shown in the inset of fig .",
    "[ fig : fig7]c .      in the case where the intervening medium has a higher dielectric constant than the two slabs , @xmath194",
    ", the vdw effect leads to an _ attractive _ force between the two slabs , eq .",
    "( [ eq : vdw_full ] ) , which again dominates at small separations .",
    "if the disorder is quenched , the force generated by the disorder can become _ repulsive _ and thus lead to a potential barrier and a long repulsive tail at large separations .",
    "this is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig8]a , for the case of two slabs with uncorrelated bulk disorder of equal variances ( @xmath179 ) , where we have fixed @xmath195 , @xmath196 and vary @xmath20 in the range @xmath197 ( dashed curves from bottom ) .",
    "the total force in this case is given again by eq .",
    "( [ eq : quenched_1m2 ] ) .",
    "note that the disorder - induced force ( second term ) is always repulsive in the case with @xmath193 ( i.e. , @xmath186 ) .",
    "thus , the separation distance @xmath190 , eq . ( [ eq : d0 ] ) , corresponds to an unstable ` equilibrium ' distance between the two slabs and @xmath198 gives the distance at which the maximum repulsive force due to the influence of quenched disorder is achieved .",
    "the above features change dramatically if the disorder charges are assumed to be annealed .",
    "in fact , the net annealed force appears to follow a trend similar to what one expects from the pure vdw force , i.e. , in contrast with the quenched case , the net annealed force turns out to be attractive and vary monotonically with the separation ( fig .",
    "[ fig : fig8]b ) .",
    "however , the ratio of the net force to the vdw force ( [ eq : vdw_full ] ) shows that the relative magnitude of the force can vary non - monotonically and deviate significantly from the underlying vdw force ( fig .",
    "[ fig : fig8]b , inset ) .",
    "in particular , one observes that the relative net force may be enhanced here by an order of magnitude at large separations .",
    "this is again due to fluctuations of annealed charges that can redistribute in the slabs in such a way as to minimize the free energy and thus favor a higher attractive force .",
    "this effect appears to be much stronger in an asymmetric system than in a symmetric system ( figs .",
    "[ fig : fig3 ] and [ fig : fig6 ] ) , where the net force remains of the same order as the pure vdw force .    in the preceding discussion",
    ", we assumed that the two slabs have similar annealed disorder variances , which leads to a purely attractive force between the slabs for @xmath199 .",
    "it turns out that the annealed disorder can also lead to a _ repulsive _ force in this case provided that the charge is distributed asymmetrically between the two slabs . in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig8]c , we show the results for the case where one of the slabs is disorder free , but the other slab contains annealed charge disorder of finite variance . as seen , one can achieve an interaction ( potential ) barrier even with the annealed charges .",
    "this effect is stronger when @xmath20 is smallest and disappears when @xmath200 .",
    "in this paper , we have shown that the effective interaction induced by the quenched or annealed monopolar charge disorder can give rise to various novel features in the overall interaction between two net - neutral semi - infinite dielectric slabs depending on the detailed assumptions about the disorder and the dielectric inhomogeneities in the system .",
    "the quenched case and the annealed case of disorder differ in the sense that in the former the disordered charges are frozen and can not fluctuate , while in the latter the disordered charges are subject to thermal fluctuations and adapt themselves to minimize the free energy of the system .",
    "our analysis is based on recent developments which unify the salient features of the zero - frequency vdw interaction and the physics of the charge disorder @xcite .",
    "based on these developments we argue that , in the case of two dissimilar slabs , the charge disorder - induced electrostatic interaction can have an opposite sign to the zero - frequecny vdw interaction and can thus give rise to a _ non - monotonic _ net interaction between the slabs .",
    "the most surprising features of our analysis pertain to the case of disorder - induced interactions across a medium of higher dielectric constant than that of the two slabs . in this case",
    "the net force may become strongly repulsive and can lead to a potential barrier for stiction when combined with the attractive vdw force . in the opposite case , where the intervening medium has a dielectric constant in between that of the two slabs , the disorder may generate a long - range attraction , which opposes the _ repulsive _ vdw force and can thus promote a stable bound state for the two bounding dielectrics .",
    "these salient features of the disorder - induced interactions are due to the slower decay of these interactions and their stronger dependence on the dielectric inhomogeneities in the system as compared to the corresponding vdw interaction .",
    "this comparison between the disorder - induced and the classical zero - frequency vdw interaction is in order since both of them are expected to be valid in the regime of large intersurface separations ( or high temperatures ) as considered in this work and which is also most relevant to recent experiments @xcite . the precise correction presented by the higher - order matsubara frequencies @xcite is highly material specific , but its magnitude ( relative to the zero - frequency term ) is typically small for the most part of the separation range considered here and remains negligible in comparison with the disorder effects .",
    "being disorder induced one should be in principle also able to compute the corresponding statistical moments of the disorder interactions averaged over the disorder .",
