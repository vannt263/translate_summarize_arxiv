    "courant s famous nodal domain theorem for elliptic operators on riemannian manifolds ( see e.g.  @xcite ) states + _ if @xmath0 is an eigenfunction belonging to the @xmath1-th eigenvalue ( written in increasing order and counting multiplicities ) of an elliptic operator , then @xmath0 has at most @xmath1 nodal domains . _    when considering the analogous problem for graphs , m.  fiedler @xcite noticed that the second laplacian eigenvalue is closely related to connectivity properties of the graph , and showed that @xmath2 always has exactly two nodal domains .",
    "it is interesting to note that his approach can be extended to show that @xmath0 has no more than @xmath3 nodal domains , @xmath4 @xcite .",
    "various discrete versions of the nodal domain theorem have been discussed in the literature @xcite , however sometimes with ambiguous statements and incomplete or flawed proofs .",

    "the perron - frobenius theorem implies that the first eigenvalue @xmath17 of @xmath18 is non - degenerate and the corresponding eigenfunction @xmath19 is positive ( or negative ) everywhere .",
    "let @xmath20 be the list of eigenvalues of @xmath18 arranged in non - decreasing order and repeated according to multiplicity .",
    "given @xmath1 let @xmath21 and @xmath22 be the largest and smallest number @xmath23 for which @xmath24 , respectively .",
    "let @xmath0 be _ any _ eigenfunction associated with the eigenvalue @xmath25 . without loss of generality we may assume that @xmath26 is a complete orthonormal set of eigenfunctions satisfying @xmath27 . since @xmath18 is a real operator , we can take all eigenfunctions to be real",
    ".    in the continuous setting one defines the nodal set of a continuous function @xmath28 as the preimage @xmath29 .",
    "the nodal domains are the connected components of the complement of @xmath29 . in the discrete case",

    "we are only interested in nodal domains of eigenfunctions @xmath0 of the schrdinger operator @xmath18 . in the following ,",
    "the term `` nodal domain '' will always refer to this case .",
    "the following properties of weak nodal domains are elementary :    * every point @xmath35 lies in some weak nodal domain @xmath30 . *",
    "if @xmath30 is a weak nodal domain then it contains at least one point @xmath35 with @xmath36 and @xmath0 has the same sign on all non - zero points in @xmath30 .",
    "thus each weak nodal domain can be called either `` positive '' or `` negative '' . *",
    "if two weak nodal domains @xmath30 and @xmath37 have non - empty intersection then @xmath38 and @xmath39 have opposite sign .    note that ( a ) need not hold for strong nodal domains , and ( c ) is replaced by : the intersection of two distinct strong nodal domains is empty .",
    "the main result of this contribution is    the eigenfunction @xmath0 has at most @xmath22 weak nodal domains and at most @xmath21 strong nodal domains .",
    "the proof of the nodal domain theorem is based upon deriving a contradiction from + * hypothesis w : * _ @xmath0 has @xmath40 weak nodal domains _ , and + * hypothesis s : * _ @xmath0 has @xmath41 strong nodal domains _ , + respectively .",
    "we call the domains @xmath42 and define @xmath43 for @xmath44 . none of the functions @xmath45 is identically zero . since they have disjoint supports their linear span has dimension @xmath46 .",
    "it follows that there exist constants @xmath47 such that @xmath48 is non - zero and satisfies @xmath49 for @xmath50 . without loss of generality we can assume @xmath51 , where @xmath52 denotes the standard scalar product on @xmath53 .",
