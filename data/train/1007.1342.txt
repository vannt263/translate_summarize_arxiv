    "hubbard - like models provide a paradigm for a large class of strongly correlated systems .",
    "a general form for the hubbard hamiltonian is @xmath0 and the system is strongly correlated when the repulsive on - site interaction @xmath1 is considerably larger than the hopping parameters @xmath2 . here",
    "@xmath3 destroys an electron in state @xmath4 on lattice site @xmath5 and @xmath6 creates an electron in state @xmath7 on a nearest - neighbour site @xmath8 .",
    "the state indices @xmath9 are summed over two states denoted by @xmath10 and @xmath11 , and the occupation numbers @xmath12 .",
    "in general we consider bipartite lattices in one , two and three dimensions .",
    "the standard hubbard model  @xcite corresponds to the case of a single orbital on each site with states @xmath13 corresponding to spin @xmath14 and with hopping parameter @xmath15 this model with a 2d square lattice is frequently used to describe the copper - oxygen plane of high-@xmath16 systems such as doped @xmath17 , where the orbital corresponds to a cu @xmath18 orbital .",
    "a related model on a 2d square lattice in the xy plane describes a ferromagnetic system in which the on - site states all have the same spin and the states @xmath10 and @xmath11 correspond to @xmath19 and @xmath20 @xmath21 orbitals respectively .",
    "this `` @xmath21 model '' describes ferromagnetic planes in @xmath22 and also in fluorides such as @xmath23 and @xmath24 , where in this case a crystal field converts @xmath25 orbitals into an effective @xmath21 system  @xcite . in the @xmath21 model one",
    "considers only the dominant hopping processes in which hopping between @xmath10  states occurs along the x axis and hopping between @xmath11  states occurs along the y axis .",
    "thus in the @xmath21 model @xmath26 where @xmath27 and @xmath28 are unit vectors along the @xmath29 and @xmath30 directions respectively and @xmath31 is a unit vector in the nearest - neighbour direction @xmath32 .    in the large-@xmath1 limit",
    "we can approximate the hamiltonian @xmath33 by an effective hamiltonian @xmath34 which is defined to act only within a subspace where there is no double occupation of any site .",
    "@xmath34 takes the form @xmath35 where @xmath36 is that part of @xmath37 which has matrix elements linking states of no double occupation with states having a single doubly - occupied site .",

    "@xcite . for the @xmath21 model",
    "the corresponding hamiltonian is @xmath44 where @xmath45 contains the hopping parameters of eq .",
    "@xmath46 is known as the t - j model and if the transverse exchange terms in eq .",
    "are omitted we have the t-@xmath47 model .",
    "this differs from @xmath48 where @xmath10 and @xmath11 spins only hop along the x and y axes respectively . for the case of one electron per site ,",
    "the undoped case for the oxides being modelled , @xmath37 drops out and the system is a mott insulator . in the hubbard case",
    "the insulator is a heisenberg antiferromagnet and in the @xmath21 case it is an ising antiferromagnet with alternating orbital order in the ground state .",
    "the transverse exchange terms in eq .",
    "are not present in eq .   owing to the directional hopping of the orbitals in the @xmath21 case .    when a hole is introduced into the lattice its motion disturbs the spin or orbital order of the ground state",
    "at each hop through the ordered lattice the hole leaves a spin , or orbital , deviation at the site it vacates .",
    "thus as the hole hops through the lattice the energy of the system increases linearly and the hole is bound to its starting - point .",
    "this is known as the string effect and it exists in dimensions higher than one@xcite . in 1d the spin deviation created by a hole at its first hop , from some initial position , increases the energy but subsequent hops in the same direction merely shift the ordered spin configuration by a lattice spacing without further increase in energy .",
    "there is therefore no string effect in the 1d t - j or t-@xmath47 models .",
    "furthermore in the 2d or 3d t - j models the string effect is relaxed by the @xmath49 terms in eq .",
    "which exchange spin directions between lattice sites and can lead to a healing of the spin deviations created by the hole .",
    "thus the hole can move at a speed determined by the healing rate , which leads to a quasiparticle band of width proportional to the exchange parameter @xmath50  @xcite .",
    "this way of relaxing the string effect is not possible in the t-@xmath47 or the @xmath48 model owing to the absence of the @xmath49 terms . in these models",
    "a relaxation mechanism can be introduced by including in the hamiltonian a term of the form @xmath51 so that the spin part of eq .",
    "becomes a transverse - field ising antiferromagnet . in the physical case of the @xmath21 model this transverse field corresponds to an on - site crystal field which mixes the two @xmath21 orbitals just as the transverse magnetic field mixes @xmath10 and @xmath11 spins . in both the t-@xmath47 and the @xmath48 model inclusion of three - site terms mentioned earlier also relaxes the string effect  @xcite but we shall not include them here",
    ". a hole in the 2d t-@xmath47 model can also propagate by means of a trugman path  @xcite which consists of 6 hops around a 4-site square plaquette .",
    "the hole moves to a next - nearest neighbour site and leaves the antiferromagnetic spin arrangement undisturbed .",
    "this can not occur in the @xmath48 model owing to the directional hopping  @xcite .",
    "we shall here concentrate on the t - j model and the t-@xmath47 model in a transverse field although there should be no difficulty in treating the directional hopping of the @xmath48 model .",
    "our reference state has one electron on each site with spins ( or pseudospins ) ordered as in an antiferromagnet .",
    "we follow martinez and horsch  @xcite in introducing a spinless fermion operator @xmath52 which creates a hole in the reference state at site @xmath53 and a boson operator @xmath54 which creates a spin reversal on site @xmath53 .",
    "thus @xmath55 for site @xmath53 on the @xmath10 spin sublattice and @xmath56 for @xmath53 on the @xmath11 sublattice . clearly",
    "each nearest - neighbour hop of the hole through the ordered lattice reverses the spin on the site vacated by the hole .",
    "thus the hopping operator @xmath43 may be written as @xmath57 for the @xmath21 model the corresponding hopping operator @xmath45 is @xmath58 since @xmath59 for @xmath53 on the @xmath13 spin sublattice we may write the ising part of the exchange term , in the presence of a hole , as @xmath60 where @xmath61 and an irrelevant constant term has been dropped . here",
    "we have used @xmath62 since the hole and a spin deviation can not occupy the same site . a spin deviation created on site @xmath63",
    "when the hole vacates that site will in general have one neighbouring site @xmath64 occupied by the hole and another by a spin deviation created when the hole arrived on site @xmath63 .",
    "thus the expression in eq .   may be written as @xmath65 where @xmath66 is the number of nearest neighbours .",
    "@xmath67 in 1d so that the above term is zero , which is consistent with the absence of the string effect in the 1d t-@xmath47 model .",
    "apart from an additive constant the t - j hamiltonian eq .   becomes @xmath68 note that the derivation of this hamiltonian in ref .",
    "@xcite gives additional constraints which we will not discuss here .",
    "the relaxation of the string effect occurs when bosons , created by fermion hopping , are spontaneously destroyed in nearest neighbour pairs by the terms @xmath69 .",
    "edwards  @xcite introduced a simplified model hamiltonian of the form @xmath70 in which boson relaxation terms @xmath69 are replaced by the simpler linear ones @xmath71 .",
    "a unitary transformation @xmath72 , @xmath73 , resulting in @xmath74 , yields @xmath75 thus the second term in @xmath76 is eliminated in favour of the first term in @xmath77 which introduces a coherent hopping channel in addition to the original incoherent one . in the ground state @xmath78 of the hamiltonian @xmath77 , in the absence of fermions , there are no bosons , so that @xmath79 .",
    "thus for the ground state @xmath80 of @xmath76 we have @xmath81 and hence @xmath82 .    from the above discussion",
    "it is clear that in 2d the edwards model corresponds , within a certain range of parameters , to an underlying t-@xmath47 type of model with hamiltonian @xmath83 since @xmath84 this corresponds to a doped antiferromagnetic ising model in a transverse magnetic field , but this correspondence is only valid for low hole density ( low fermion density in the @xmath76 model ) and @xmath85 . in this case , since @xmath86 , the holes move in a background medium which is close to a saturated antiferromagnet . for @xmath87",
    "the transverse - field ising model no longer exhibits antiferromagnetic order  @xcite . in 1d",
    "the correspondence breaks down completely since if @xmath88 and @xmath89 the @xmath76 model exhibits the string effect which is absent in the 1d t-@xmath47 model .",
    "in fact the 1d @xmath76 model has an interesting similarity to the 2d t-@xmath47 model .",
    "even for @xmath88 the string effect is relaxed by an analogue of the trugman path  @xcite .",
    "this is again a 6-step process in which the fermion propagates to a next - nearest neighbour site with the background medium left undisturbed , i.e. no bosons excited . during the process",
    "the fermion excites three bosons which are subsequently destroyed .",
    "unfortunately the model @xmath76 does not represent precisely any physical system that we know of .",
    "the underlying ising exchange is characteristic of the @xmath21 model for vanadates and fluorides but the directional hopping of that model is not included , although this could be remedied in the 2d model .",
    "however if the model is considered over the whole @xmath90 , @xmath91 space it is found , even in the 1d case , to exhibit a surprising number of different physical regimes reminiscent of some found in realistic strongly - correlated electron systems and strongly - coupled electron - phonon systems .",
    "this was first demonstrated for the case of a single fermion ( @xmath92 ) at temperature t=0 by the method of variational lanczos diagonalisation  @xcite .",
    "a great advantage of the model is that the simple treatment of the background medium , in terms of local bosons , makes it possible to obtain essentially exact results in the thermodynamic limit , at least in the 1d case .",
    "more recently the half - filled case , with @xmath93 where @xmath94 is the number of lattice sites , has been investigated  @xcite .",
    "the ground - state phase diagram has been mapped out in the whole @xmath95 plane , using a density matrix renormalisation group ( dmrg ) technique  @xcite . a quantum phase transition between a metallic tomonaga - luttinger liquid and an insulating charge density wave ( cdw )",
    "was shown to exist .",
    "it is desirable to complement these numerical results with some more analytical approaches .",
    "nearly all analytical work on t - j - like or polaronic models is confined to the case of a single fermion .",
    "however very recently the projective renormalisation method  @xcite has been applied to the half - filled 1d @xmath76 model in a study of cdw formation at t=0  @xcite .",
    "our initial analytical work on the @xmath76 model was confined to the one - fermion case in 1d at t=0 with the additional restriction @xmath88  @xcite .",
    "the latter restriction means that the fermion can only propagate as a coherent quasiparticle by the trugman - like process discussed above .",
    "this requires the coexistence of at least three bosons during the particle s motion and in ref .",
    "@xcite the one - fermion green s function was calculated within a 3-boson approximation .",
    "the spectral functions agree well with exact numerical results for @xmath96 . in this paper",
    "we extend the analytical approach for @xmath88 to finite fermion density and to higher dimension , 2d and 3d .",
    "this is achieved within a 2-boson approximation and comparison with exact numerical results in 1d shows that the range of validity is thereby reduced to @xmath97 .",
    "no trugman - like processes exist in the 2-boson approximation but they are unimportant to understand cdw formation at finite density .",
    "relaxation of the string effect does not depend on them because bosons created by one fermion can be destroyed by other fermions .",
    "near half - filling a cdw state is found , in good agreement with 1d numerical results , and the cdw transition temperature can be calculated formally .",
    "however , within the 2-boson approximation , the transition is mean - field - like , with no short - range order in the disordered state .",
    "this is clearly not realistic in 1d but finite - temperature calculations should certainly be relevant in 3d . in this paper",
    "we concentrate on the calculation of spectral functions in 1d at t=0 with various fermion densities and compare with some new dmrg results .    in sec .",
    "[ sec : limitingcases ] we determine the one - fermion green s function for @xmath88 within the 2-boson approximation in the cases of one particle ( @xmath92 ) and one hole ( @xmath98 ) .",
    "the method used is different from that previously employed for @xmath92  @xcite and provides a wave - function as a byproduct . in sec .",
    "[ sec : decoupling ] we study the hierarchy of equations of motion for the green s function at arbitrary density and devise a decoupling which leads to the correct green s function in the 2-boson approximation for @xmath92 and @xmath98 .",
    "this 2-boson green s function is valid for any bipartite lattice in 1d , 2d or 3d and allows for two distinct sublattices so that the cdw state can be investigated . in sec .",

    "[ conclusions ] we draw conclusions and consider the outlook for future work .",
    "we now derive expressions for the one - fermion green s function in the special cases of a single fermion ( @xmath92 ) and a single hole ( @xmath98 ) . for these single - particle cases the green s function may be calculated by direct solution of the schrdinger equation , which also yields the wave - function .",
    "for @xmath88 the hamiltonian eq .  ,",

    "the absence of @xmath119-dependence in this expression shows that the single - fermion eigenstates are localized .",
    "this is due to the string effect which is not relaxed in the 2-boson approximation .",
    "the motion of a single hole in the present model is quite different from that of a single particle . to avoid confusion",
    "it should be stressed that the hole discussed here does not correspond to a hole in a t - j - like model , the latter being represented by a fermion in the present model .",
    "clearly when the hole considered here hops to a neighbouring site a boson is created on the arrival site , not on the departure site as in the motion of a single particle .",
    "this boson can be destroyed immediately when the hole makes a further hop .",

    "the energy eigenvalue of an eigenstate @xmath333 with @xmath334 must therefore be ( at least ) two - fold degenerate , since the state @xmath335 belongs to the same energy but differs from @xmath333 due to the change of @xmath321 .",
