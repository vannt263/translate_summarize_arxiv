    "a long - pursued goal in the study of crystals is to know whether an analogue of the lorentz group exists in discrete space @xcite .",

    "more emergent applications of the dirac equation can be found within the class of hexagonal semiconductors , in particular novel materials such as transition metal dichalcogenides @xcite ; see also @xcite and references therein .",
    "their peculiar structure shows the need of more complex tight - binding arrays that , however , lead to the typical bandgap emerging from inversion symmetry breaking precisely at a dirac point .",
    "the question of whether such a description can be conceived as a unitary transformation of known models shall be addressed .",
    "it is convenient to mention here that in our analysis , non - hermitian hamiltonians shall emerge naturally .",

    "we recall here that a @xmath0-symmetric hamiltonian has the remarkable property of commuting with the combination of parity and time reversal @xmath0 , despite the fact that individually , neither parity nor time reversal commute with the hamiltonian .",

    "the first difficulty we encounter is related to the atomic orbitals .",
    "the monolayer material ( x - m - x with one metallic and two chalcogen layers ) must be a covalent crystal ( as opposed to ionic ) , which dictates the nature of the overlaps that constitute chemical bonds .",

    "the six available orbitals in mo can not be used to form the six chemical bonds , since all orbitals would then be occupied , ruling out any hopping amplitude between s and mo .",

    "the shape of conduction orbitals must be such that their overlap with the hybridized @xmath110 of s ( pointing out of the sheet ) must be the largest coupling in the model .",
    "the overlap of these mo orbitals with their six second neighbours must have opposite sign : the product of adjacent wavefunctions must be negative , as per result ( [ 2.4 ] ) second term of @xmath66 , and there must be six lobes horizontally disposed as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : v.0 ] a ) .",
    "this can be achieved by considering a linear combination of @xmath111 and @xmath112 ( available ) , together with a @xmath108 contribution that couples with s. this is shown in fig .",

    "the full structure is built again by rotating @xmath100 twice , giving rise to six horizontal leaves of alternating signs .",

    "the angle of deformation can be finally determined in terms of atomic overlaps by    & = & - 1 = -1 [ 3.2 ] where @xmath118 are realistic quantities approximated by our model parameters .",

    "we have shown that the stability group of the dirac algebra defined on linear and hexagonal lattices can be applied to obtain new structures with the same propagation properties guaranteed by an invariant dispersion relation .",
    "lorentz transformations have been included in a @xmath0-symmetric case that touches the field of artificial solids .",
    "our efforts have also led to a simplified model of atomic orbitals in mos@xmath1 , producing a deformed tight - binding model with second neighbours and matching the features of observed semiconduction bands . in connection with negative couplings and artificial realizations , e.g. microwaves in dielectric cylinders ,",
    "it has been shown recently @xcite that such opposite signs can be achieved by adding more structure to the arrays , giving rise to an additional berry phase .    as an additional remark",
    ", we would like to point out that an infinite number of tight binding models with the same dispersion relation can be reached through the application of more general unitary transformations .",
    "for instance , in a two - dimensional lattice of @xmath123 sites , the elements of u@xmath124 gather all crystalline structures into the same equivalence class of dimensionality @xmath125 .",
    "however , this suggests myriads of isospectral models which may not appear naturally in solids , nor in artificial constructions with resonators . here , the use of quantum graphs seems more appropriate , but lies beyond the scope of the present paper .",
    "finally , it is worth noting that restricting ourselves to the stability group of dirac matrices has led us to a simple description of gently deformed honeycomb crystals .",
