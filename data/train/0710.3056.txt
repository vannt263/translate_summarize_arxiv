    "it is generally accepted that resonances in scattering are represented by poles in the `` second '' riemann sheet of the complex energy plane @xcite .",
    "let us assume here that in a process of elastic and non - exotic meson - meson scattering one obtains scattering poles at @xmath8 simple poles in @xmath0 may be considered simple zeros in its denominator .",
    "hence , assuming a polynomial expansion , we may @xcite represent the denominator @xmath9 of @xmath0 by @xmath10 unitarity then requires that the @xmath0-matrix be given by ) . ] @xmath11    if we assume that the resonances ( [ polepositions ] ) stem from an underlying confinement spectrum , given by the real quantities @xmath12 then we may represent the differences @xmath13 , for @xmath14 , 1 , 2 , @xmath15 , by @xmath16 .",
    "thus , we obtain for the unitary @xmath0-matrix the expression @xmath17    so we assume here that resonances occur in scattering because the two - meson system couples to confined states , usually of the @xmath18 type , viz .  in non - exotic meson - meson scattering .",
    "let the strength of the coupling be given by @xmath19 .",
    "for vanishing @xmath19 , we presume that the widths and real shifts of the resonances also vanish ( see fig .",
    "[ poleposition ] ) .",
    "consequently , the scattering poles end up at the positions of the confinement spectrum  ( [ confinementpositions ] ) , and so @xmath20 as a result , the scattering matrix tends to unity , as expected in case there is no interaction .",
    "an obvious candidate for an expression of the form ( [ unitairsdeltae ] ) looks like @xmath21 where @xmath22 is a smooth complex function of energy @xmath23 , and where , at least for small values of the coupling constant @xmath19 , one has @xmath24 relation ( [ deltaerse ] ) can be easily understood , if we assume that for small @xmath19 poles show up in the vicinity of the energy values ( [ confinementpositions ] ) of the confinement spectrum . as a consequence , at the zero @xmath25 of the denominator , near the @xmath26-th recurrency of the confinement spectrum @xmath27 , the term @xmath28 dominates the summations in formula ( [ unitairsrse ] ) , i.e. , @xmath29    for larger values of @xmath19 , one can not perform the approximation @xmath30 in eq .",
    "( [ 2ndorderrse ] ) . in such cases , the left - hand part of eq .",
    "( [ 2ndorderrse ] ) must be solved by other methods , usually numerically . however , since it is reasonable to assume that poles move smoothly in the lower half of the complex energy plane as @xmath19 varies , we may suppose that the left - hand part of eq .",
    "( [ 2ndorderrse ] ) has solutions which , when the value of @xmath31 is continuously decreased , each correspond to one of the values out of the confinement spectrum ( [ confinementpositions ] )",
    ".    when all scattering poles in expression  ( [ unitairsdeltae ] ) are known , one can  with unlimited accuracy  determine the function @xmath22 in formula  ( [ unitairsrse ] ) .",
    "once @xmath22 is known , one can search for poles by solving the left - hand part of eq .",
    "( [ 2ndorderrse ] ) .",
    "however , further restrictions can be imposed upon expression  ( [ unitairsrse ] ) .",
    "for a two - meson system , there may exist bound states below the meson - meson scattering threshold .",
    "such states are represented by poles in the analytic continuation of expression  ( [ unitairsrse ] ) to below threshold , on the real axis in the complex energy plane .",
    "consequently , in the case that a confinement state , say @xmath32 , comes out below threshold , its corresponding pole is , at least for small coupling , expected to be found on the real axis in the complex energy plane .",
    "using formula  ( [ deltaerse ] ) , we obtain @xmath33    moreover , in order to ensure that scattering poles come out in the lower - half of the complex energy plane , also using formula  ( [ deltaerse ] ) , we find that above threshold @xmath22 must be complex , with a positive imaginary part .",
    "in different partial waves , resonances come out at different masses . at threshold , where the total invariant mass of the two - meson system equals the sum of the two meson masses ,",
    "one has additional conditions . for @xmath0 waves ,",
    "since cross sections are finite , we must demand that @xmath22 do not vanish at threshold , whereas , for @xmath6 and higher waves , as cross sections do vanish , @xmath22 should vanish as well .    a possible expression that satisfies all imposed conditions reads @xmath34 where @xmath35 represents the linear momentum in the two - meson system and @xmath36 a scale parameter with the dimensions of a distance . the well - known scattering solutions @xmath37 and @xmath38 stand for the spherical bessel function and the hankel function of the first kind , respectively .",
    "thus , we arrive at a good candidate for a scattering amplitude of resonant scattering off a confinement spectrum , reading @xmath39 where we have introduced the two - meson reduced mass @xmath40 and , moreover , relative couplings @xmath41 , which may be different for different recurrencies of the confinement spectrum .",
    "as it is written , formula  ( [ unitairtellrse ] ) seems to allow a lot of freedom , through adjustments of the @xmath41 to experiment . in principle",
    ", it might even be useful to carry out such data fitting , so as to gain more insight into the details of the coupling between a two - meson system and a confined @xmath18 state",
    ". however , experimental results are so far much too incomplete to make a detailed comparison to our expression possible .",
    "the spin structure of quarks , besides being important for the spectrum of a @xmath18 system , is also crucial for the short - distance dynamics , hence for the properties of the coupling between @xmath18 and meson - meson states . in the @xmath42 model @xcite , it is assumed that a two - meson system couples to a @xmath18 state via the creation or annihilation of a new @xmath18 pair , with vacuum quantum numbers @xmath43 . under this assumption",
    ", all relative couplings can be determined from convolution integrals of the wave functions . in refs .",
    "@xcite , such integrals have been calculated for general quantum numbers , including flavour .",
    "the latter results leave no freedom for the coupling constants in formula  ( [ unitairtellrse ] ) , except for an overall strength @xmath19 , which parametrises the probability of @xmath18 creation / annihilation .    this way , the full spin structure of the two - meson system is entirely contained in the relative coupling constants @xmath41 .",
    "yet , direct comparison of the results given in refs .",
    "@xcite to experiment would still be of great interest .",
    "the relevant @xmath44 coupling - constant book - keeping has been developed in refs .",
    "the latter scheme not only eliminates any freedom , but also  by construction  restricts the number of possible @xmath45 channels that couple to a given @xmath18 system .",
    "nonetheless , the number of involved channels rapidly grows for higher radial and angular excitations of the @xmath18 system .",
    "the scattering matrix is not directly observable , but only through quantities like cross sections and production rates .",
    "it is straightforward to determine cross sections @xcite and , after some algebra , production rates @xcite from expression ( [ unitairtellrse ] ) .",
    "however , a complete modelling of strong interactions is more complex .",
    "for example , a @xmath3 vector state couples , via ozi - allowed decay , to @xmath46 , but also to @xmath47 , @xmath48 , @xmath49 ,   @xcite .",
    "consequently , the involved two - meson channels couple to one another as well .",
    "so the first extension necessary for a more proper description of strong interactions is the formulation of a multichannel equivalent of expression  ( [ unitairtellrse ] ) .",
    "this issue has been dealt with in ref .",
    "it involves coupling constants similar to the ones discussed above , but now for each two - meson channel .    a meson - meson channel is characterised by quantum numbers , including flavour and isospin , and the meson masses .",
    "however , many of the needed masses are unknown yet , while most mesons only exist as resonances .    in experiment",
    ", one can concentrate on one specific channel . on the other hand , in a meaningful analysis all channels that couple",
    "must be taken into account .",
    "for example , one may argue that for the description of @xmath7 scattering below the @xmath50 threshold the channels @xmath50 , @xmath51 ,  can be neglected .",
    "but then one ignores virtual two - meson channels , which may have a noticeable influence below the @xmath50 threshold .    furthermore",
    ", @xmath18 states may couple to one another via meson loops .",
    "typical examples are : @xmath3 vector states , which become mixtures of @xmath52 and @xmath53 via loops of charmed mesons , and isoscalar @xmath18 states , where kaon loops mix the @xmath54 and @xmath55 components .",
    "one then obtains different interplaying confinement spectra , which may become visible in production rates .",
    "the extension of expression  ( [ unitairsrse ] ) to more than one @xmath18 channel has been considered in refs .",
    "@xcite , for the description of the @xmath56 and @xmath57(980 ) resonances .",
    "besides the parameters @xmath19 and @xmath36 , formula  ( [ unitairtellrse ] ) contains an infinite number of parameters @xmath58 .",
    "these represent the unknown and even hypothetical spectra of confined @xmath18 systems . from experiment",
    ", we only have data at our disposal for resonances in meson - meson scattering or production .",
    "formulae like expression  ( [ unitairtellrse ] ) are intended to interpolate between the observed resonances and the underlying  largely unknown  confinement spectrum .    in fig .  2 of ref .",
    "@xcite ( see fig .  [ kpiscross ] ) , we showed , for @xmath0-wave isodoublet @xmath1 scattering , how cross sections determined by the use of formula  ( [ unitairtellrse ] ) vary with increasing values of the coupling @xmath19 . for small @xmath19 ,",
