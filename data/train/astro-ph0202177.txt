    "subdwarf  b ( sdb ) stars dominate surveys for extremely blue stars brighter than b@xmath516 ( green , schmidt & liebert 1986 ; downes 1986 ; kilkenny et  al . , 1997 ) . their effective temperatures ( t@xmath6 = 20000k  40000k ) and surface gravities ( @xmath7 = 5.5  6.5 ) place the majority of sdb stars on the extreme horizontal branch ( ehb ) , i.e.",
    ", they appear in the same region of the t@xmath6@xmath7 plane as evolutionary tracks for core helium burning stars with core masses of about 0.5  and extremely thin ( @xmath8 ) hydrogen envelopes ( heber 1986 ; saffer et  al .",
    "the extremely low mass of the hydrogen envelope in sdb stars is thought to be due to extensive mass loss when the star was a red giant near the tip of the red giant branch ( rgb ) , i.e. , just prior to ignition of helium in the degenerate helium core .",
    "if mass loss occurs while the red giant is near the tip of the red giant branch , the core can go on to ignite helium , despite the dramatic mass loss , and may then appear as an ehb star ( dcruz et  al . 1996 ) .",
    "the cause of the extensive mass loss has been a matter of some debate , but a recent survey for short period binary ehb stars by maxted et  al .",
    "( 2001 ) has shown that in at least 2 out of 3 ehb stars , interactions with companion stars are responsible . in this scenario ,",
    "the expanding red giant star comes into contact with its roche lobe and begins to transfer mass to its companion star .",
    "this mass transfer is highly unstable , so a `` common - envelope '' forms around the companion and the core of the red giant .",
    "the drag on the companion orbiting inside the common envelope leads to extensive mass loss and dramatic shrinkage of the orbit ( iben & livio 1993 ) .",
    "the properties of sdb stars , e.g. , their orbital period distribution , are a strong test of population synthesis models for binary stars because the common envelope phase which produced the sdb star must have occurred in a star with a degenerate helium core at the tip of the red giant branch .",
    "this places useful limits on the mass and radius of the star at the onset of the common envelope phase .",
    "another property of these binaries which can , in principle , be compared to population synthesis models is the relative number of degenerate and non - degenerate companions , i.e. , the fraction of sdb stars with main - sequence or sub - giant companions compared to the fraction with white dwarf companions . in this paper",
    "we outline a simple method to determine the nature of the companion in practice and apply the method to four sdb binaries with known orbital periods .",
    "in those cases where the companion to an sdb star is not seen directly in the optical spectrum , some other method must be found to determine the nature of the companion star .",
    "a sensitive method to detect main - sequence or sub - giant companions is to obtain an accurate lightcurve and to look for the effect of the irradiation of one side of the companion star by the hot sdb star .",
    "this produces an easily detectable signal with the same period as the orbital period with an approximately sinusoidal shape because the binary appears brightest when we see the irradiated hemisphere face - on and is fainter half an orbit later when we see more of the non - irradiated hemisphere .",
    "this sinusoidal distortion to the lightcurve is known as the reflection effect .",
    "it is useful to estimate the amplitude of the reflection effect we expect from a cool , faint companion to an sdb star using the following assumptions and approximations .",
    "if the sdb star has an effective temperature @xmath9 and a radius @xmath10 the flux intercepted by a companion star of radius @xmath11 at a distance @xmath12 , is @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is the stefan - boltzmann constant .",
    "if all of the irradiating flux is re - emitted by the heated face , the effective temperature of the heated face is @xmath15 , where we have assumed the intrinsic luminosity of the companion star is negligible .",
    "the amplitude of the reflection effect at a given wavelength depends on the spectrum of the sdb star and the spectrum of the reprocessed light from the heated face of the companion star .",
    "the spectrum of the reprocessed light we observe will change with orbital phase because the temperature varies across the heated face and the light will not be radiated isotropically from the heated face .",
    "the model we describe later takes account of these effects , but for the purposes of estimating the amplitude of the reflection effect we can calculate the maximum flux observed from the heated star using the approximation that it appears as a star of radius @xmath11 and effective temperature of @xmath16 . for observations at most optical and near - infrared wavelengths , the rayleigh - jeans limit of a black body spectrum is a good approximation for the spectrum of the sdb star , i.e , the intensity is proportional to the effective temperature . in the case of strong irradiation , @xmath16 will also be sufficiently high for this approximation to apply to the spectrum of the heated face of the companion .",
    "if we consider a binary which is seen nearly edge - on but is not eclipsing , we find that the difference in magnitudes when we see the irradiated and non - irradiated faces @xmath17 , is @xmath18   \\\\            & \\approx & \\left(\\frac{r_2}{r_1}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{r_1}{a}\\right)^{\\frac{1}{2 } } { \\rm ~~if~\\delta m~is~small}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    although this expression is approximate , it does enable us to estimate the amplitude of the reflection effect we might expect from an sdb star with a main - sequence companion .",
    "more importantly , it shows that @xmath19 , so a typical white dwarf with a radius of 0.01  will produce a reflection effect at least 100 times less than a typical m - dwarf with a radius of 0.1 .",
    "the actual difference will be much larger than this if the white dwarf is not exceptionally cool but has a more typical effective temperature for white dwarfs of 1020000k because the temperature contrast between the heated and unheated hemispheres would then be much less .",
    "for example , an sdb star with @xmath20k and a radius of 0.2with a cool companion 1  distant ( p@xmath21 4h ) will show a reflection effect of about 0.1magnitudes , which is easily detectable with differential ccd photometry . by contrast , a white dwarf with a radius of 0.01  at the same distance gives rise to a reflection effect of no more than 0.001magnitudes .",
    "even if the inclination of the binary reduced the amplitude of the reflection effect by an order of magnitude , it would be straightforward to distinguish the nature of the companions in these two hypothetical binary sdb stars using the presence or absence of a reflection effect in the lightcurve .",
    "we have used a simple model to produce synthetic lightcurves for the sdb binaries we have observed which is based on numerical integration over the visible surface of the heated star .",
    "the visible surface of the irradiated star is defined by a roche potential . the effective temperature at the integration points on the heated face , @xmath22 is calculated from @xmath23 , where @xmath24 is the mean effective temperature of the unheated face and @xmath25 is the irradiating flux over that region of the star allowing for the angle between the normal to the surface and the direction of the sdb star .",
    "the other parameters of our model are the radius of the sdb star in units of the orbital separation , @xmath26 ; the radius of the companion star in units of the distance between its centre and the inner lagrangian point measured along the same axis ( the filling - factor ) , @xmath27 ; the inclination of the orbit , @xmath28 ; the mass ratio , @xmath29 ; the orbital period , @xmath3 , the effective temperature of the sdb star , @xmath9 . the observed flux at a given wavelength and orbital phase can then be estimated by assuming that both stars radiate as black - bodies .",
    "we also include limb darkening and gravity darkening in the calculation of the reflection effect .",
    "the details of the treatment of these effects in our model has a negligible effect on the predicted amplitude of the reflection effect so we do not describe them here .",
    "our model does not include any contribution to the lightcurve due to the distortion of the sdb star by its companion , i.e , the ellipsoidal effect from the sdb star is ignored .",
    "this effect is negligible for ton  245 , feige  11 and pg1432 + 159 but not for pg1017@xmath0086 .",
    "our calculation of the effective temperature over the surface of the companion star is equivalent to assuming that the bolometric albedo of the companion star , @xmath30 , is 1 .",
    "there is good observational evidence for cool companions to hot subdwarf stars having high bolometric albedos , at least for short period binaries .",
    "for example , drechsel et  al .",
    "( 2001 ) have presented b and r lightcurves of the eclipsing sdb star hs0705 + 6700 which has an m - dwarf companion and an orbital period of @xmath31 .",
    "they used the wilson - devinney code ( wilson & devinney 1971 ) to model the lightcurve and found that to achieve satisfactory fits to the lightcurves a value of @xmath32 is required .",
    "the fits were improved by using a value of @xmath33 , which is unrealistic and is a consequence of using a monochromatic lightcurve model based on black body radiation to model a broad band lightcurves of an irradiated star whose spectrum is certainly very different to a black body .",
    "our model is also affected by this problem .",
    "similarly , hilditch , harries & hill ( 1996 ) analysed the lightcurves of hw  vir , kv  vel ( sdo+m , p=@xmath34 ) and aa dor ( sdo+m , @xmath35 ) with the lightcurve model light2 ( hill & rucinski 1993 ) and also found @xmath32 or more is required to reproduce the reflection effect .",
    "wood , zhang & robinson ( 1993 ) confirmed the requirement for a high albedo in hw  vir by using the wilson - devinney code to analyse their ubvr lightcurves of hw  vir .",
    "although our model is quite simple , it is able to predict the amplitude of the reflection effect in sdb binaries with faint companions with an accuracy of about 50 percent . to demonstrate this ,",
    "we have calculated the amplitude of the reflection effect for two sdb stars with faint companions , hw  vir and pg1336@xmath0018 and the sdob binary v477  lyr .",
    "these three stars are eclipsing binaries so the properties of the stars can be determined independently .",
    "this is shown in table  [ othertable ] , where we compare the observed amplitude of the reflection effect in the v and i bands , @xmath36v and @xmath36i , to the value calculated using our model .",
    "we also list the properties of each binary in table  [ othertable ] which have the greatest effect on the values of @xmath36v and @xmath36i predicted by our model . in all three cases",
    "we see that the amplitude in the v band is predicted correctly to within 50 percent . for hw",
    "vir where the amplitude has also been measured in the i - band , the amplitude predicted by our model agrees very well with the observed value .",

    "<S> we present lightcurves of four binary subdwarf  b stars , ton  245 , feige  11 , pg1432 + 159 and pg1017@xmath0086 . </S>",
    "<S> we also present new spectroscopic data for pg1017@xmath0086 from which we derive its orbital period , @xmath1d , and the mass function , @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> this is the shortest period for an sdb binary measured to - date . </S>",
    "<S> the values of @xmath3 and @xmath4 for the other sdb binaries have been published elsewhere . </S>",
    "<S> we are able to exclude the possibility that the unseen companion stars to ton  245 , feige  11 and pg1432 + 159 are main - sequence stars or sub - giant stars from the absence of a sinusoidal signal which would be caused by the irradiation of such a companion star , i.e. , they show no reflection effect . </S>",
    "<S> the unseen companion stars in these binaries are likely to be white dwarf stars . </S>",
    "<S> by contrast , the reflection effect in pg1017@xmath0086 is clearly seen . </S>",
    "<S> the lack of eclipses in this binary combined with other data suggests that the companion is a low mass m - dwarf or , perhaps , a brown dwarf .    </S>",
