    "<S> we present a new formula which models the rate of decline of supernovae ( sn ) as given by the light curve in various bands . </S>",
    "<S> the physical basis is the conversion of the flux of kinetic energy into radiation . </S>",
    "<S> the two main components of the model are a power law dependence for the radius  time relation and a decreasing density with increasing distance from the central point . </S>",
    "<S> the new formula is applied to sn 1993j , sn 2005cf , sn 1999ac , and sn 2001el in different bands .     </S>",
