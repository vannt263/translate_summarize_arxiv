    "since contracting edges can lead to a bipartite minor for a graph that was not bipartite to begin with , it s easy to construct examples of graphs that are not themselves bipartite intrinsically knotted even though they have a minor that is minor minimal bipartite intrinsically knotted .",

    "we remark that cousin 110 was earlier identified as bipartite intrinsically knotted in ( * ? ? ?",

    "it follows from that classification that cousin 110 is the only minor minimal bipartite intrinsically knotted graph of order ten or less .",
    "it would be interesting to know if there are further examples of order between 11 and 14 , which is the order of the heawood graph .",
    "such examples would have at least 23 edges .",
