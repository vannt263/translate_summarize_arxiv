    "<S> we report the development and implementation of hybrid methods that combine quantum mechanics ( qm ) with molecular mechanics ( mm ) to theoretically characterize thiolated gold clusters . </S>",
    "<S> we use , as training systems , structures such as au@xmath0(sch@xmath1-r)@xmath2 and au@xmath3(sch@xmath1-r)@xmath4 , which can be readily compared with recent crystallographic data . </S>",
    "<S> we envision that such an approach will lead to an accurate description of key structural and electronic signatures at a fraction of the cost of a full quantum chemical treatment . as an example </S>",
    "<S> , we demonstrate that calculations of the @xmath5h and @xmath6c nmr shielding constants with our proposed qm / mm model maintain the qualitative features of a full dft calculation , with an order - of - magnitude increase in computational efficiency . </S>"
