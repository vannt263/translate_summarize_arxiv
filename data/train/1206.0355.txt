    "the fact that consistent parity , tr and er operations exist only in the zero - mass limit , and that chiral symmetry is altogether impossible to define , makes this theory highly pathological from a physical point of view .",
    "as it turns out , this unsatisfactory situation can be remedied by introducing an additional flavour degree of freedom for the dirac fermions  @xcite .",

    "it is possible to construct a theory of dirac fermions in ( 2 + 1)d that exhibits the familiar symmetries of parity and tr , even for a finite mass  @xcite .",
    "this theory involves four - spinor wave functions describing two flavours ( 2fs ) of such fermions .",
    "the dirac operator ( [ eq : dirac_ham ] ) is block - diagonal , and a possible choice for the matrix operators @xmath3 and @xmath4 is @xmath145 such a flavour - symmetric representation was adopted , e.g. , in refs .",

    ", we also give the @xmath98 matrices : @xmath147      rotations are again generated by @xmath100 , which is a conserved quantity .",

    "we define parity , tr and er as symmetry transformations that connect the flavour subspaces . for each of the parity transformations",
    "@xmath149 , two inequivalent representation matrices @xmath150 can be realised , @xmath151 which are distinguished by the property @xmath152 .",

    "thus it is possible  @xcite that dirac particles in 2f ( 2 + 1)d behave under tr like spinless particles [ having @xmath157 as an alternative to the expected spin-1/2-behaviour [ where @xmath158 .",
    "the conditions associated with invariance under particle - hole conjugation @xmath159 are satisfied by @xmath160 unlike the tr and chirality operations , particle - hole conjugation preserves the flavour degree of freedom so that we get @xmath161 .    finally , there exist two inequivalent representation matrices for er symmetry @xmath162 they both anticommute with all dirac matrices in the 2f ( 2 + 1)d model , satisfy the relation @xmath163 [ @xmath164 ; cf .  also eq .",
