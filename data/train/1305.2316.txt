    "the study of ultracold atomic gases is one of the most actively developed areas of the physics of quantum many - body systems . initiated by the pioneering experiments with synthetic gauge fields in both bose gases @xcite and fermi gases",
    "@xcite , theoretical physicists took over the research for providing various schemes to synthesize certain extensions to rashba ",
    "dresselhaus @xcite spin - orbit coupling for cold atoms @xcite . as a result ,",
    "one derives a single - particle hamiltonian of the form @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is the laplacian , @xmath3 is the identity operator in @xmath4 ( or @xmath5 ) , and @xmath6 is the atom - light coupling containing the spin - orbit interaction of the rashba or dresselhaus form and the zeeman field . in a one - dimensional atomic center - of - mass motion ,",
    "the simplified hamiltonian of a particle with mass @xmath7 ( in @xmath8 units ) accedes to a formal differential expression in the configuration space @xmath9 ,    @xmath10    ( @xmath11 ) , where @xmath12 labels the spin - orbit - coupling strength , @xmath13 results from the zeeman field and is named by the raman - coupling strength ; @xmath14 , @xmath15 are the pauli matrices . in ( [ eq : hamilt ] ) , @xmath0 obeys the meaning of a short - range disorder localized in the neighborhood of @xmath16 .",
    "it seems to be the first time when the spectral properties  and in particular bound states  of the hamiltonian realized through ( [ eq : hamilt ] ) are considered in detail . for the most part , our attempt to provide the analysis of the spectral characteristics for the spin - orbit hamiltonian is motivated by the work of @xcite , where the authors examined the free hamiltonian @xmath17 in @xmath18 , with @xmath19 in @xmath20 , and calculated , particularly , the dispersion relation . in a recent report of @xcite ( see also @xcite ) such a dispersion was shown to had been measured in @xmath21li .",
    "a straightforward calculation shows that the atom - light coupling @xmath6 is unitarily equivalent to @xmath22 ( @xmath23 , @xmath15 are the pauli matrices ) , and the associated unitary transformation is @xmath24 , where @xmath25 .",
    "the operator @xmath26 , provided @xmath27 , is nothing more than the free one - dimensional dirac operator for the particle with spin one - half and mass @xmath28 ( in @xmath8 units ) ; see @xcite for the analysis of this operator .",
    "it turns out that @xmath29 in ( [ eq : hamilt ] ) can also be interpreted as being equivalent to the ( operator ) sum of the free dirac operator plus a schrdinger operator @xmath30 .",
    "in particular , this means that , as the spin - orbit - coupling strength @xmath12 increases , @xmath31 approaches the one - dimensional massless dirac operator in weyl s form . for arbitrary @xmath27 , however , one can show that @xmath32 , with @xmath33 defined on a suitable domain ( sec .",
    "[ sec : fermi ] ) , is unitarily equivalent to @xmath34 , the one - dimensional dirac operator for the particle moving in fermi pseudopotential ( see ( [ eq : vf ] ) ) .",
    "this particular feature enables us to show that @xmath29 admits both continuous and discontinuous functions at a zero point . throughout , by a ( dis)continuous function @xmath35 , one accounts for the property whether @xmath36 ( continuity ) or not ( discontinuity ) , though @xmath35 is assumed to be defined on any subset of @xmath37 .",
    "originally , one would naturally conjecture that the disorder @xmath0 is prescribed by a potential well with its minimum at @xmath16 .",
    "a good survey of approximations by smooth potentials can be found , for example , in @xcite . also , there are numerous works concerning the generalized point - interactions in one - dimension ; see eg the papers of @xcite , and also the citations therein . in the present paper , we assume that @xmath0 is approximated by the square - well of width @xmath38 and depth @xmath39 for some arbitrarily small @xmath40 ; the coupling strength of interaction is @xmath41 .",
    "evidently , this is a familiar @xmath42-interaction .",
    "the one - dimensional schrdinger and dirac operators with @xmath42-interaction are known to be well - defined via the boundary conditions for everywhere continuous functions . in our case",
    "we have a mixture , to some extent , of schrdinger - like and dirac - like operators . in sec .",
    "[ sec : extra ] we argue that in such a case there is a possibility that discontinuous eigenfunctions would appear .",
    "to avoid the difficulties concerning the uniqueness of self - adjoint extensions of the operators on intervals @xmath43 , @xmath44 $ ] and @xmath45 , we consider two distinct representations of @xmath29 in the hilbert space @xmath46 .",
    "the first one , denoted @xmath47 , is obtained by integrating @xmath29 in the interval @xmath48\\ni 0 $ ] and then taking the limit @xmath49 ; this gives the required boundary condition in defining the domain @xmath50 of @xmath47 .",
    "the second representation of @xmath29 is a distribution @xmath51 on @xmath52 , with @xmath42 the delta - function . here and elsewhere ,",
    "@xmath53 , with @xmath54 , is the closure of @xmath55 in @xmath56 , the sobolev space of functions whose ( weak ) derivatives of order @xmath57 are in @xmath58 ( * ? ? ?",

    "the commutator predetermines a nonempty set of common eigenfunctions of @xmath47 and @xmath65 , provided @xmath66 ( theorem  [ thm : ea ] ) .",
    "the latter inequality shows that extra states in @xmath67 can be observed only for nonzero spin - orbit and raman coupling , and that their appearance in the spectrum is essentially dependent on the location of the dressed spin states @xcite in the dispersion curve .",
    "although @xmath47 and @xmath61 are equivalent representations for providing the spectral characteristics for @xmath29 in @xmath46 , we explore both of them .",
    "the main reason for such a choice is because the interaction is drawn in @xmath61 explicitly , and thus one can easier attach the physical meaning to @xmath61 , rather than @xmath47 ; the same applies to @xmath68 and @xmath65 , respectively . on the other hand , equivalence classes of functions in @xmath69 , with @xmath70 ,",
    "are in a one - to - one correspondence with functions in @xmath71 , with the same @xmath72 , if and only if one imposes certain conditions on the normalization constant and the eigenfunction itself ( sec .",
    "[ sec : spectrum ] ) .",
    "this agrees with ( * ? ? ?",

    "this is done by calculating @xmath84 at @xmath16 for all @xmath91 , where function @xmath35 is in the kernel of the operator that involves @xmath0 as in ( [ eq : v ] ) .",
    "afterward , one needs to verify under what circumstances the infinite series in ( [ eq : v - delta-2 ] ) converges . for the analysis of specific operator classes ,",
    "the reader is referred to @xcite .",
    "the application of ( [ eq : v - delta-2 ] ) to @xmath29 in ( [ eq : hamilt ] ) is examined below .",
    "let @xmath92 in @xmath81 .",
    "the solutions @xmath93 ( @xmath94 ) are found by solving the characteristic equation for @xmath29 : @xmath95=0 $ ] ( @xmath96 ) or explicitly ,    @xmath97    the solutions with respect to @xmath98 read    @xmath99    and so    @xmath100    the upper , @xmath101 , and lower , @xmath102 , components of @xmath35 are then of the form    @xmath103    for some @xmath104 , @xmath105 .",
    "clearly ,    @xmath106    as @xmath49 .",

    "but then @xmath113 as @xmath49 , and the infinite series in ( [ eq : v - delta-2 ] ) vanishes .",
    "this proves that , as a functional , @xmath86 makes sense for functions in certain domains of @xmath29 .    as a result ,",
    "at least two possibilities are valid to construct these domains .",
    "the first one is obtained by integrating @xmath114 in @xmath81 and then taking the limit @xmath49 . in agreement with ( [ eq : v - delta-2 ] ) and the discussion above ,",
    "this gives the operator    @xmath115    ( @xmath116 ) where @xmath117 is of the form in ( [ eq : v - delta-1 ] ) .",
    "it appears from ( [ eq : a ] ) that for zero spin - orbit coupling @xmath118 , or continuous functions at @xmath16 , the boundary condition in @xmath50 is a familiar relation valid for the operators with @xmath42-interaction .",
    "this suggests the second realization of @xmath29 in @xmath119 , namely ,    @xmath120    with @xmath42 the delta - function .",
    "here we recall that although @xmath61 is a distribution , operator @xmath47 can be interpreted in the classical sense due to the fact ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem  3.17 ) that distributional and classical derivatives coincide whenever the latter exist ( and certainly are continuous on @xmath121 ) .",
    "if , however , we start from the pure point - interaction ( that is , @xmath42-interaction ) and integrate @xmath61 in @xmath81 , we derive that the property @xmath107 is only the ( additional , though reasonable ) assumption , as also discussed by @xcite .",
    "moreover , the operator @xmath122 is not self - adjoint , and it has deficiency indices , d.i . , ( 2,2 ) as @xmath49 .",
    "this means that additional boundary conditions at @xmath123 are required , and so again , @xmath124 is not necessarily equal to @xmath125 , in general .",
    "this is our motive to inspect the boundary condition in @xmath50 in its most general form .    to this end , let us comment on the self - adjointness of operator @xmath47 ( @xmath61 ) .",

    "the solutions @xmath128 are of the form ( [ eq : fss ] ) , with @xmath129 in ( [ eq : kss ] ) replaced by    @xmath130    for @xmath131 , one requires @xmath132 in order to make solutions square integrable .",
    "this yields @xmath133 and @xmath134 . for @xmath135 , however , @xmath136 , and possible values are @xmath137 and @xmath138 . evidently , the intersection of possible solutions which are square integrable in the whole @xmath5 is the empty set . in terms of deficiency indices ,",

    "one simply needs to solve @xmath142 ( @xmath143 ) by noting that @xmath144 , in agreement with ( [ eq : b ] ) ; here @xmath145 .",
    "it follows from ( [ eq : fp ] ) that the fourier transform @xmath146 of @xmath128 is proportional to @xmath147 . as a result ,",
    "@xmath148 is not in @xmath119 ( * ? ? ?",

    "similarly to the case for the dirac operator , one can also construct the quadratic form @xmath149 and show that it satisfies the klmn theorem ( * ? ? ? * theorem  x.17 ) with respect to @xmath150 .",

    "the associated eigenfunctions are everywhere continuous but with zero - valued component ( either upper or lower one ) at the origin .",
