    "the emission is clearly dominated by a central extended source , although other clumps of emission can be seen distributed around it .",

    "the radial profiles of both nuclei are shown in figure 2 .",
    "the northern nucleus is clearly extended when compared with a stellar psf .",
    "a best fit to its profile was obtained by using a combination of an exponential and a lorentzian function . in order to reduce contamination from the northern nucleus in the photometry of the southern source",
    ", its profile was derived using photometry obtained from the lower - half of the circular apertures centred on this source . despite the much lower signal - to - noise",
    ", it is clearly seen that the southern nucleus is also well resolved .",
    "furthermore , the same fit that described the profile of the northern nucleus is also found to provide a good representation of the southern source .",
    "in fact the hst - nicmos images show that the southern nucleus is the more extended of the two nuclei at near - ir wavelengths ( lira et al . , 2002 ) .",
    "photometry calculated within an aperture of 3  diameter centred on the northern and southern nuclei , gives fluxes of @xmath23 and @xmath24 jy , respectively ( see table 1 ) . despite our efforts to reduce the contamination from the northern nucleus in the southern aperture",
    ", we must consider the flux from the southern nucleus to be uncertain .",
    "the total emission within an aperture of 9.5  in diameter centred on the northern peak corresponds to 1.8 jy .",
    "however , since the background subtraction of the image was obtained using a chopping throw of only 15 , it is important to quantify the possibility of sky oversubtraction which could affect these measurements .",
    "the total emission measured from the timmi2 image can be compared with the iras 12@xmath10 m ( @xmath25 m ) photometry obtained by sanders et al .",
    "for an iras beam of 0.77  in diameter they measured a marginally resolved source with a total flux of 3.6 jy , which corresponds to a corrected flux of @xmath26 jy in the @xmath27 m timmi2 band , if the northern nucleus best - fit model presented in section 5 is adopted , and this model is representative of the emission from the whole region .",
    "hence , the iras observations provide an estimate of the size of the total emitting region , which is comparable to the iras beam .",
    "if we assume that the differences between the iras and the timmi2 fluxes are due to emission evenly distributed within an annular region of inner and outer diameters 9.5and 0.77 , respectively , then the corresponding surface brightness would be @xmath28 mjy / arcsec@xmath29 .",
    "this would correspond to corrections of @xmath30 , @xmath31 , and @xmath32 respectively to the fluxes for the total , northern and southern regions presented in table 1 ( see 3 last entries ) .",
    "however , it is quite possible that the emission from outside the timmi2 image does not follow a completely even distribution , but instead has a steep profile . to test this scenario we extrapolated the fitted profile shown in figure 2 out to the region used for the sky subtraction ( @xmath8 away ) .",
    "the estimated value is only @xmath33 mjy / arcsec@xmath29 .",
    "again , this result suggests that our measurements do not suffer from a severe background oversubtraction .",
    "integrating the fit to the profile of the northern nucleus out to a diameter of 0.77  underestimates the observed iras flux by @xmath34 , suggesting that the larger scale surface brightness ( i.e. , that lying outside the timmi2 image ) is actually closer to the flat distribution that we proposed earlier .",
    "figure 3 presents the irac images in the 3.6 , 4.5 and 5.8 @xmath10 m bands .",
    "the spatial resolution of irac ( fwhm @xmath35 ) clearly separates the two nuclei .",
    "it can be seen that in the 4.5 @xmath10 m band image the two nuclei have a very similar peak brightness , while the northern nucleus is more prominent at 3.6 and 5.8 @xmath10 m .",

    "( 1999 ) .",
    "the timmi2 , irac and wfpc2 photometry is given in table 1 .",
    "the irac photometry was obtained in apertures that roughly correspond to the same spatial region as measured in the 3.0  timmi2 aperture photometry .",
    "this was achieved by deconvolving the timmi2 image of the northern nucleus ( using a standard star observation ) and then convolving it with the characteristic fwhm for each irac band .",
    "finally , an aperture size was defined so that the same fractional flux as that measured from the timmi2 image would be obtained .",
    "we assumed that the same irac apertures apply for the photometry of the southern nucleus .",
    "given the small fwhm of the wfpc2 camera ( @xmath36 ) a 3.0  aperture was directly applied to obtain the optical photometry for the northern nucleus .",
    "+     the n - band spectra of the northern and southern nuclei in ngc3256 are shown in figure 4 .",
    "both spectra are flanked by the rising pah features at 7.7 @xmath10 m and the narrow [ neii]@xmath37 m emission line which is blended with the 12.7 @xmath10 m pah feature .",
    "unfortunately the [ neii]@xmath37 m line is not completely covered in the spectral range of our data but it can be clearly seen in the data of martn - hernndez et al .",
    "( 2006 ) .",
    "the nuclear region of ngc3256 was observed with the spitzer irs spectrograph . as can be seen in figure 4",
    ", the irs spectrum is a very good match to the trecs observations of the northern nucleus , which clearly dominates the emission in the mid - ir ( see figure 1 ) .",
    "since the flux calibration of the irs spectrum was obtained from a much larger aperture ( 10.5 ) , a scaling factor of 0.18 had to be applied to these data .",
    "this is also similar to the ratio between the 1.3and 9.5  fluxes measured in the apertures applied to the timmi2 images , and presented in table 1 .    following the model proposed by other authors ( e.g. , laurent et al . , 2000",
    "; sturm et al . , 2000 ) , we assume a simple description of the n - band emission , and fitted the spectra of both nuclei as a combination of several components :    @xmath38    where @xmath39 and @xmath40 are empirical templates of an hii region and a pah - dominated pdr region ( peeters , spoon & tielens , 2004 ) .",

[ cols=\"^,^,^,>,>,>\",options=\"header \" , ]     since the spectral range of our data is too narrow to allow us to determine the strength of the continuum , the pah features and the extinction ( which includes the silicate absorption at @xmath47 m ) , we have instead assumed a fixed value for the normalization of the extinction curve , ( @xmath48 ) . since our spectra were obtained using a @xmath49 slit , we have adopted @xmath50 for the northern nucleus and @xmath51 for the southern nucleus , as was determined from the 0.3resolution nicmos images ( lira et al . , 2002 ) .",
    "these values are rather uncertain , since they were determined by assuming an intrinsic @xmath52 color for the starburst region .",
    "the same method gives @xmath53 and @xmath54 magnitudes for the northern and southern nuclei respectively , when the colours are measured from a 3  aperture , while the use of a correlation between the radio 6  cm and [ feii ] fluxes implies @xmath55 and @xmath56 for the northern and southern nuclei respectively ( kotilainen et al .",
    ", 1996 ) .",
    "the outcome from the spectral fitting is summarized in table 2 .",
    "a clear result is that the northern nucleus shows a strong continuum contribution , while the southern nucleus is dominated by pah emission , without the need for a significant continuum component .",
    "we have explored adopting lower values of @xmath48 when fitting the spectrum of the southern source . in particular , in section 5 we derive an extinction of @xmath57 for this nucleus .",
    "however , these changes have very little impact on the best fit results .",
    "our fit suggests that the continuum of the northern nucleus has a stellar origin ( @xmath39 ) , although if only an agn continuum is allowed for the fit , then the result is also acceptable ( @xmath58 ) .",
    "however , the presence of an agn in ngc3256 is not supported by the very considerable body of observational evidence which indicates that an active nucleus is not present in this galaxy , or at least if it exists at all it is not the main component responsible for the powerful ir and x - ray emission ( doyon et al.,1994 , kotilainen etal , 1996 ; moorwood & oliva 1994 , norris & forbes , 1995 ; rigopoulou etal , 2000 ; lpari et al . , 2000 , lira et al . , 2002 , verma et al . , 2003 ) .",
    "we have also measured the flux and equivalent width of the 11.3 @xmath10 m pah feature clearly seen in both our spectra . since it is not possible to easily unblend this emission from the neighbouring 12.7 @xmath10 m pah band and strong [ neii]@xmath37 m line , we have derived these measurements by simply assuming the continuum level to be a straight line from 10.9 @xmath10 m to 11.7 @xmath10 m . we compare our measurements with those from the literature in table 3 .",

    "given the good match between the trecs and irs spectra in the @xmath13 m wavelength range ( see figure 4 ) , we have assumed that the northern nucleus is also responsible for most of the irs flux at wavelengths longer than @xmath64 m . as discussed before ,",
    "all photometric measurements were corrected to correspond to fluxes predicted within a @xmath65 aperture .",
    "kotilainen et al .  (",
    "1996 ) showed that the southern nucleus becomes relatively more prominent at longer wavelengths , and is comparable to the northern nucleus in the l - band .",
    "they interpreted this difference as being due to different amounts of dust obscuration towards the two nuclei .",
    "however our n - band data show a very weak southern nucleus when compared with the northern source , which is not consistent with such an explanation .",
    "in addition the irac observations presented in figure 3 confirm this trend .",
    "the measured fluxes clearly show that their emission is very nearly the same at @xmath66 m , but diverge longwards and shortwards of this wavelength ( see table 1 ) .",

    "( 2000 ) extinction law , ranging from the optical to @xmath67 m , and the draine et al ( 2003 ) extinction curves from @xmath67 m longwards .",
    "the best fit models imply visual band extinctions of @xmath68 and @xmath69 mags for the northern and southern nuclei , respectively .",
    "this is in good agreement with the previous determinations discussed in section 4 within the uncertainties . these are mainly due to the assumption that a screen of foreground dust can account for the extinction towards the nuclei all the way from the optical to the mid - ir , since the geometry of these regions is probably more complex . also , the adoption of a particular extinction curve would have some impact on the final determined extinction , while the templates used in our description of the sectra might not properly describe the intrinsic emission .",
    "the starburst models have two free parameters , the ism pressure ( with @xmath70 and @xmath71 @xmath72 k ) and the characteristic time scale for the clearing of the starforming regions ( i.e. , the time required for the covering factor of the star - forming clouds to decrease from 0.9 to 0.1 ) .",
    "changes in the pressure affect the model seds for fluxes above @xmath73 m and therefore are not well constrained by our sed data . however , rigopoulou et al .",
    "( 1996 ) have determined an electron density @xmath74 @xmath72 for the central region in ngc3256 , and therefore we considered those sed models corresponding to @xmath75 @xmath72 k. the best fit models imply clearing times between @xmath76 myr for both nuclei .",
    "generally the starburst models provide a good match to the seds .",
    "the northern nucleus , however , clearly requires an extra component in its continuum at @xmath77 m , as can be seen by comparing the top and middle panels in figure 5 .",
    "this is in agreement with our findings from the spectral analysis .",
    "the reprocessing of emission absorbed by foreground dust is not expected to contribute significantly at these wavelengths as the characteristic temperature of this emission would be lower than 50 k. instead we have modelled the excess flux as a gray body assuming an emissivity with index @xmath78 .",
    "the best fit temperature for this component is @xmath79 k. the origin of this emission could be explained if the actual distribution of dust grain sizes is different to the one used in dopita s models .",
    "if this interpretation is correct then the excess emission is due to a comparatively larger contribution from very small dust grains , which dominate the dust re - emission in the mid - ir ( dsert , boulanger & puget , 1990 ) .",
    "the normalization of the starburst sed models allow us to infer a star formation rate ( sfr ) of @xmath80 and @xmath81yr for the northern and southern nuclei , respectively .",
    "this estimation does not take into account the gray - body component added to the fit of the northern nucleus since its integrated luminosity corresponds to @xmath82 of the total emission .",
    "these sfrs are in good agreement with the values obtained using the supernova rate of 0.3 yr@xmath2 per nucleus derived from radio observations ( norris & forbes 1995 ) by assuming a conversion @xmath83 as inferred from the starburst99 models using a constant star formation episode ( leitherer et al . , 1999 ) .",
    "one of the interesting results obtained from our new n - band data is establishing the photometric and spectroscopic differences between the northern and southern nuclei , which can not be explained simply by differences in dust obscuration .",
    "since the starburst activity in these nuclei must have been triggered by the merger of two progenitors , the age of the starbursts is likely to be comparable , but other physical parameters could be different in the two separate merging parent galaxies .",
    "x - ray , optical and near - ir observations are indicative of a highly obscured southern nucleus which is completely hidden at visible wavelengths but which becomes increasingly prominent in the near - ir .",
    "the brightness of the two peaks are comparable at @xmath84 m and at radio wavelengths .",
    "hence , it might be anticipated that in the mid - ir , where extinction becomes negligible , the two nuclei would also have similar flux levels . but this is not observed .",
    "instead , we find that the northern nucleus exhibits excess continuum emission at wavelengths @xmath77 m when compared with the southern nucleus and with our model seds .",
    "interestingly a similar behaviour was found by alonso - herrero et al .",
    "( 2006 ) when comparing the @xmath11 m and pa@xmath85 emission from a sample of lirg nuclei , including ngc3256 . while the northern nucleus shows a high @xmath11m / pa@xmath85 ratio , as was also seen in other lirgs , the lower @xmath11m / pa@xmath85 value of the southern nucleus is consistent with the ratios observed in hii regions .",
    "alonso - herrero et al .",
    "( 2006 ) explain this difference by the presence of large scale diffuse emission , which is characterised by strong pah features in the mid - ir . as can be seen in table 3 , for ngc3256 the ew of the 11.3 @xmath10 m pah feature changes at most by a factor 3 between small ( 11.21.3 ) and large ( 10.524 ) apertures , while the line fluxes are greater by a factor @xmath86 .",
    "this suggests that the fractional increase in the continuum flux is also substantial ( factor @xmath87 ) .",
    "in addition , the data presented in figures 4 and 5 suggest that a significant fraction of the excess mid - ir flux is due to continuum emission produced by warm dust , heated in - situ by the starburst itself .    using spitzer irs observations , brandl et al .",
    "( 2006 ) has quantified the continuum fluxes at 6 , 15 and 30 @xmath10 m for a sample of starburst galaxies , including ngc3256 .",
    "brandl s observations show that the flux ratio @xmath88 determined for ngc3256 is significantly lower than the average @xmath89 found for their starburst sample .",
    "as we have shown , the northern nucleus is more luminous that the southern nucleus by a factor of @xmath28 at 5.8 @xmath10 m , while at 15@xmath10 m the flux should be dominated by the northern nucleus . indeed , using the best fit seds we find @xmath90 for the southern nucleus , while for the northern nucleus we adopt the value tabulated from the irs spectrum .",
    "the full range of observed flux ratios in brandl s sample is @xmath91 , which probably reflects the range in starburst conditions , such as age and dust properties .",
    "we find that the nuclei in ngc3256 are representative of the two extremes of this distribution , but are found in the same central region of a single galaxy .",
    "finally we compare the 10.5@xmath10 m and ( unabsorbed , 2 - 10 kev ) x - ray fluxes for both nuclei with the correlation derived by krabbe , bker & maiolino ( 2001 ) using n - band maniac observations .",
    "the x - ray fluxes correspond to @xmath92 and @xmath93 w m@xmath94 ( lira et al . , 2002 ) , while the @xmath95 m fluxes ( @xmath96 m , assuming the best fit seds ) are @xmath97 and @xmath98 mjy , respectively .",
    "it is found that both nuclei are x - ray deficient given their n - band photometry .",
    "in particular , because of its high mid - ir flux , the northern nucleus becomes a clear outlier in this correlation .",
    "but as shown by krabbe s work , this is not the case for ngc3256 when the fluxes are integrated over a large region , implying that the correlation holds for global starburst properties , but individual regions can show a much wider range of properties .",
    "in particular , our work shows that in - situ dust heating in lirgs , whose emission can dominate the mid - ir emission , can be confined to very compact ( few hundred - pc scale ) regions .",
