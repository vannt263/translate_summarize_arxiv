    "recently , it was claimed that analysis of data from the _ fermi _ gamma - ray space telescope has shown a possible excess of @xmath0-ray from the galactic center ( gc )  @xcite , which was also reported in previous studies  @xcite . because galactic center is such a complex region , it is challenging to draw any definite conclusion at the moment .",
    "if we take this possible excess seriously , a cause for the excess is needed .",
    "astrophysical explanation such as millisecond pulsars has been discussed  @xcite .",
    "however , it was claimed that signal from light dark matter annihilation is more favored  @xcite .",
    "if one interprets this excess in terms of dark matter pair annihilation into a pair of standard model(sm ) fermions , the annihilation cross section @xmath5 be at the order of the thermal relic cross section @xmath6/s  @xcite .",
    "both specific models and general frameworks have been investigated for this @xmath0-ray signal  @xcite since then ( see refs .",
    "@xcite for some earlier discussion ) .",
    "dm models for the gc @xmath0-ray excess can be generally divided into two categories . in the first category , dm annihilates directly into sm fermion pairs  @xcite , which is however expected to be inconsistent with current constraints from collider and direct searches ( see ref .",
    "@xcite , for example ) . in the second category , dm annihilates into two or more on - shell particles , which in turn immediately decay into sm fermions  @xcite",
    ". a natural scenario of the second category can be easily realized in dm models with dark / hidden sectors and singlet portals ( higgs portal and kinetic mixing ) , which is the main theme of this paper . in such models",
    ", one can easily evade the collider and direct search bounds , since dm particles interact with sm particles through singlet portals .    in this paper",
    ", we first discuss the gc @xmath0-ray signal in scalar dm model with local @xmath7 symmetry @xcite as a concrete example . in this model",

    "semi - annihilation  @xcite breaks the tight correlation between thermal relic abundance and dm - nucleon scattering cross section , and allows scalar dm lighter than @xmath9gev , in sharp contrast to the global @xmath7 case  @xcite . also underlying local @xmath7 symmetry guarantees the stability of scalar dm even in the presence of non - renormalizable higher dimensional operators .",
    "furthermore , stabilizing dm particles via local gauge symmetries has a number of other virtues , as noticed in a series of recent works  @xcite .",
    "after the detailed discussions of the gc @xmath0-ray signal in the local @xmath7 scalar dm model , we generalize our finding to general hidden sector dm models with local dark gauge symmetries . in this class of models , in addition to dm , there are new particles , namely dark gauge bosons and dark higgs boson , whose interactions are completely determined by local dark gauge symmetry and renormalizability .",
    "higgs portal interaction will be generically present in almost all the cases , and will thermalize dm relic density efficiently even for non - abelian dark gauge symmetries ( see refs .",
    "@xcite for some dm models based on non - abelian groups ) .",
    "higgs portal interaction also plays a very important role in direct and indirect detections of dm as well as in higgs inflation  @xcite .    for abelian dark gauge symmetry",
    ", there can be an additional portal from the @xmath10 gauge kinetic mixing .",
    "very often one just assumes a massive dark photon with this gauge kinetic mixing operator only , and consider various constraints from direct / indirect detections and thermal relic density altogether .",
    "however , couplings between dm and dark photon critically depend on the charge assignments to dm and dark higgs fields ( for example , compare the local @xmath7 model  @xcite and the local @xmath11 model  @xcite ) , which is often overlooked in many works . within local dark gauge theories ,",
    "it is inconsistent to give mass to the dark gauge boson by hand , since it breaks local dark gauge symmetry explicitly .",
    "it is important to introduce either dark higgs field or some nonperturbative dynamical symmetry breaking mechanism to generate the dark gauge boson mass , while respecting local dark gauge symmetry and keeping all the allowed ( renormalizable ) operators .",
    "otherwise , the resulting phenomenology could be misleading and sometimes even wrong , as shown in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "we note that dm models are also constrained by indirect searches .",
    "stringent limits come from anti - proton and positron fluxes and radio signals  @xcite .",
    "however , such constraints vary for different dm annihilation channels and also depend sensitively on various astrophysical factors as well : for example , the propagation parameters for the anti - proton flux , the local dm density for the positron flux , and the dm density - profile at small radii @xmath12pc for radio signals  @xcite , respectively .",
    "currently , conservative limits still allow viable space for dm explanation of @xmath0-ray excess . due to the large astrophysical uncertainties",

    "particularly , dark higgs can play more important role , since the dark gauge boson coupled to the sm fields through the @xmath10 kinetic mixing at tree level  can be realized only in the abelian dark gauge symmetry . in dm models with non - abelian dark gauge symmetries where dark gauge bosons can not have renormalizable couplings to the sm fields",
    ", one can invoke dark higgs and higgs portal interactions for the gc @xmath0-ray excess .",
    "dark higgs couples more strongly to the heavier sm fermions such as @xmath78 or @xmath127 , and thus its couplings are naturally flavor dependent as noticed in ref .",
    "it is amusing to notice that dm models where dm is stabilized by the local dark gauge symmetry have a number of new fields which can be utilized for dm self - interaction @xcite or the @xmath0-ray excess from the gc , depending on the mass spectra of these new particles .",
    "dark higgs boson can also mix with the sm higgs boson and reduce the higgs signal strengths from one in a universal manner , independent of production and decay channels .",
