    "active galactic nuclei are among the broadest emission sources in nature , producing significant flux over a span @xmath10 decades in frequency , from radio to x - rays and beyond  @xcite . the various emission mechanisms involved are presumably ultimately powered by a central supermassive black hole  @xcite .",
    "a substantial fraction of the bolometric luminosity of many agn emerges in the infrared , from synchrotron radiation and dust . which of these is the principal emission mechanism is related to quasar type and is an open question in many cases  @xcite .",
    "non - thermal emission is paramount in core dominated radio - loud quasars and blazars  @xcite , although hot dust contributes in some cases  @xcite .",
    "the non - thermal component is likely related to radio and higher frequency synchrotron radiation , providing information about the relativistic plasma and magnetic fields associated with quasars .",
    "other agn classes show evidence for a predominant dust contribution  @xcite , particularly infrared - luminous radio - quiet quasars  @xcite , or a mix of emission components  @xcite .",
    "much of the dust emission is due to heating by higher energy photons from the active nucleus , and is therefore important for understanding the overall energy balance .",
    "the agn thermal component may be an orientation - independent parameter , useful for examining unification hypotheses .",
    "the nature of the foremost infrared emission source is ambiguous in many agn with sparsely sampled spectral energy distributions ( seds ) .",
    "dust with smooth spatial and temperature distributions can mimic a power law spectrum  @xcite , particularly in the absence of detailed measurements to reveal bumps from temperature and density inhomogeneities .",
    "grain emissivity is characterized by a planck function multiplied by a power law factor @xmath11  @xcite , so spectral slopes in the rayleigh - jeans region of the coldest potential thermal component lie between @xmath124 , depending on the grain properties and optical depth .",
    "known synchrotron emitters have relatively flat sub - mm power - law spectra ( @xmath13 )  @xcite , and radio sources generally have spectra flatter than the canonical @xmath14 for a self - absorbed homogeneous synchrotron source  @xcite .",
    "therefore , @xmath14 is a convenient partition to distinguish thermal emission from standard non - thermal models , and simple two - point spectral slopes and even lower limits to spectral indices may reveal the dominant mechanism . however , synchrotron models with a concave electron energy distribution  @xcite , free - free absorption , or plasma suppression  @xcite can produce slopes steeper than @xmath14 . while @xmath15 is observed in some milliarcsecond radio knots  @xcite ,",
    "thermal models offer the most consistent explanation for steep far - infrared ( fir ) to mm slopes  @xcite . a thermal origin",
    "is considered to be the most likely explanation for sub - mm / fir slopes @xmath16 in the present work .",
    "two large , complementary iso agn observing programs are opening up new wavelength windows in the fir as well as improving the spatial resolution and sampling at shorter wavelengths : the iso european central quasar program  @xcite ; and the nasa / iso key project on agn , discussed herein .",
    "the key project sample consists of 5200@xmath17 chopped and rastered isophot  @xcite observations of 73 agn selected to incorporate a wide range of agn types and redshifts .",
    "the data are reduced using a combination of the ( iso- ) phot interactive analysis ( pia )  @xcite software plus custom scripts .",
    "details of the reduction , difficulties encountered , and early results are discussed in  @xcite .",
    "these observations directly measure the fir spectral slopes in low and moderate redshift agn and provide better constraints on the emission mechanisms throughout the infrared region .",
    "some of the fundamental questions being addressed with the new data include : the range of seds within each quasar type ; differences between one type and another ; the evolution of the seds ; and correlations with fluxes at other wavebands , host galaxy properties , and orientation indicators .",
    "this paper focuses on two subsamples , hard x - ray selected agn , and high - redshift quasars .",
    "infrared and x - ray data complement each other well and are important for understanding the overall agn energy balance .",
    "non - thermal infrared emission is possibly connected with the x - rays , either directly as a portion of a broad synchrotron component , or as part of a radio - infrared seed spectrum which compton scatters to produce the x - rays . infrared data from dust - dominated sources",
    "reveal the level of ultra - violet ( uv ) and soft x - ray radiation which has been reprocessed , and dust masses can be estimated assuming optically thin emission .",

    "these surveys suffer obscuration biases similar to optical selection , due to the gas typically associated with dust .",
    "the absorption cross - section drops steeply with increasing energy  @xcite , so hard x - ray selection is much less affected by intervening material .",
    "surveys in hard x - rays arguably are the most efficient way to distinguish between accreting and stellar sources  @xcite as well as the optimal method for defining a representative sample of agn  @xcite . a comparison between the uv / soft x - ray flux absorbed and the ir emission provides an estimate of the relative importance of accretion and stellar power in agn .",
    "we randomly selected 23 iso targets ( of which 22 are reported in table  [ tb : lums ] ) from a 210 kev agn sample derived from the a2 experiment onboard the heao 1 satellite  @xcite ; 12 of these are also in the earlier piccinotti sample  @xcite from the same experiment",

    "the range of ir continua in the sample overlaps but extends to redder continua than an optical / radio selected sample  @xcite .",
    "this is apparent in the low mean for the near - ir slope , @xmath24 compared with the median sed value of @xmath25 and also the extension to cooler values of the ratio of decade luminosities : l@xmath26/l@xmath27 compared with the radio / optical sample : @xmath28 .",
    "the latter is also illustrated by comparison of the histograms in figure  [ fg : hotnesshist ] .",
    "however a kolmogorov - smirnov test does not indicate a significant difference in the samples ( p=18% ) .",

    "while skewed to low - redshift objects , due in part to lost sensitivity and changes in observing mode , the key project sample contains 8 quasars in the redshift range @xmath29 . in order to cover the intrinsic fir continuum in these sources , we also have an on - going sub - mm observing program at the jcmt .",
    "the spectral energy distributions of these quasars vary widely .",
    "the highest redshift sources : 1202@xmath190727 ( @xmath30 ) ; 1508 + 5714 ( @xmath31 ) ; and 1413 + 1143 ( @xmath32 ) , are factors of 10100 brighter in the near - ir than the low-@xmath33 median sed  @xcite ( figure  [ fg : hizseds ] ) . at lower redshifts , pg1407 + 265 ( @xmath34 ) and phl5200 ( @xmath35 )",

    "the @xmath40 component in 1508@xmath415714 is based on only the observed 850@xmath17 flux ; it is likely to be an upper limit , because the fir slope is flattening at those wavelengths , indicating possible contamination by a high frequency extension of the non - thermal radio emission .",
    "these and other high - redshift agn  @xcite contain large amounts of dust , which implies a substantial star formation rate ( sfr ) .",
    "average sfrs listed in table  [ tb : hiz ] were calculated from the inferred mass assuming a 1% dust production efficiency  @xcite and an onset of star formation at @xmath42 .",
    "estimates of the fir luminosity due solely to this sfr , computed with a conversion of @xmath43  @xcite , are also listed .",
    "these are @xmath44 factor 10 below the observed luminosities , implying that the bulk of the fir emission is driven by the agn , or the sources are undergoing an intense starburst of @xmath45 .",
    "both sources have large excesses over the median sed in a spectral region that corresponds to warm and hot dust emission .",
    "this emission can not yet be conclusively attributed to a thermal source , but that is a strong possibility , since cool dust is clearly present in 1202@xmath190727 and both objects show a sharp cutoff at wavelengths corresponding to the wien region of dust near the sublimation temperature .",
    "the difficulty with a dust interpretation is the energy source to heat the material ; the observed rest - frame optical and near - uv luminosity is clearly too low in both sources .",
    "dust may obscure all but a small fraction @xmath44 1% of the intrinsic blue bump luminosity .",
    "it is unlikely that we are directly viewing the extincted source , as broad emission lines are clearly visible on continua which do not appear heavily reddened  @xcite .",
    "the observed flux may be diminished by reflection off of a scattering surface positioned above a dust torus .",
    "alternatively , if we are seeing the intrinsic output of the central engine in the optical and near - uv , then these agn must be abnormally luminous in the far - uv and x - rays .",
