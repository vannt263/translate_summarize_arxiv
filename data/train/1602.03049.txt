    "ngc 1068 is one of the closest and most famous seyfert 2 galaxies ( khachikian & weedman 1974 ) . since the discovery of its seyfert 1 nucleus in linearly polarized light ( antonucci & miller 1985 )",
    ", it presents the strongest case for a unified model of active galactic nuclei ( agns ) .",
    "ngc 1068 is also a powerful starburst galaxy .",
    "as highlighted by begelman ( 1997 ) , vigorous star formation is observed ` out in the open ' on kiloparsec scales ( e.g. , lester et al .",
    "1987 ; telesco & decher 1988 ; bruhweiler et al .  1991 ; hutchings et al .  1991 ; neff et al .  1994 ) .",
    "this is beautifully illustrated in fig .  1 , a false - colour uv image of ngc 1068 observed by the uit team ( neff et al .  1994 ;",
    "fanelli et al .  1997 ; marcum et al .  2001 ) .",
    "hereafter , we will adopt a distance of 14.4 mpc ( bland - hawthorn et al .",
    "1997 ) , so that 1corresponds to 69.8 pc .",
    "this figure shows that , in addition to the agn , there is a population of luminous starburst knots spread over a bright disc of size @xmath1 , which is surrounded by a fainter halo .",
    "the disc emits four times more uv flux than the agn ( fanelli et al .",
    "1997 ) , and the starburst knots are among the brightest star formation regions known , perhaps the most luminous within a distance of 30 mpc ( neff et al .",
    "1994 ) .",
    "ngc 1068 displays the classic ` bar within bar ' morphology , with a starburst pseudo - ring of radius @xmath2 located at the end of the secondary bar ( see bland - hawthorn et al .",
    "1997 and references therein ) .",
    "schinnerer et al .",
    "( 2000 ) analysed the structures and rotation curve traced by the molecular gas , and estimated that the starburst pseudo - ring ( appearing as tightly wound spiral arms in co ) is close both to the inner lindblad resonance of the primary bar and to the corotation resonance of the secondary bar .",
    "emsellem et al .  ( 2006 ) analysed the gas and stellar dynamics of ngc 1068 in detail , using a variety of data as well as numerical simulations , and found that there is no clear mode coupling ( resonance overlap ) between the two bars .",
    "in particular , the corotation resonance of the secondary bar lies at @xmath3 , i.e.  well beyond the end of the bar ( @xmath2 ) .",
    "they also showed that the secondary bar produces clear signatures in the stellar kinematics , and that this structure could drive a significant amount of gas down to the central 300 pc ( see emsellem et al .",
    "2006 for more details ) .",
    "gravitational instability is expected to play a significant role in this scenario because of its link with star formation ( e.g. , mac low 2013 ; elmegreen 2015 ) , the growth of bars within bars and associated structures ( e.g. , shlosman et al .  1989 ) .",
    "brinks et al .",
    "( 1997 ) and gallimore et al .",
    "( 1999 ) estimated the value of toomre s ( 1964 ) @xmath4 stability parameter in the starburst disc of ngc 1068 , considering both atomic and molecular gas , but found no clear evidence of gravitational instability .",
    "this result is not discouraging .",
    "_ disc instabilities are difficult to detect without more powerful diagnostics _ ( romeo & fathi 2015 ) .    here",
    "we explore this important aspect of the problem using the disc instability diagnostics developed by romeo & wiegert ( 2011 ) and romeo & falstad ( 2013 ) , which have been tested in a variety of applications ( e.g. , hunter et al .",

    "2016 ; khoperskov et al .  2016 ) . to detect gravitational instabilities across the starburst disc of ngc 1068 ,",
    "we consider not only molecular gas but also a component that is still often disregarded when analysing the stability of spiral galaxies : the stars ! the data and method are described in sect .  2 ,",
    "the results are discussed in sect .  3 , and the conclusions are drawn in sect .  4 .",
    "a proper two - component stability analysis requires radial profiles of five basic quantities : the epicyclic frequency , @xmath5 , the surface densities of molecular gas and stars , @xmath6 and @xmath7 , the molecular 1d ( line - of - sight ) velocity dispersion , @xmath8 , and the stellar radial velocity dispersion , @xmath9 .",
    "although for simplicity we use similar notations , the last two quantities reflect an important dynamical difference between molecular gas and stars . to first approximation , molecular gas is collisional so its velocity dispersion is isotropic , while the stellar component is collisionless and has an anisotropic velocity dispersion .",
    "we derive @xmath10 , @xmath11 and @xmath12 in sect .",
    "2.1 , and @xmath13 and @xmath14 in sect .  2.2 .",
    "finally , we present the disc instability diagnostics and compute their radial profiles in sect .  2.3 .",
    "we use co @xmath15 data from the bima survey of nearby galaxies ( bima song ; helfer et al .",
    "2003 ) , which have a spatial resolution of @xmath16 , sampled at 1per pixel , and a velocity resolution of 10 kms@xmath17 . to derive @xmath10 , @xmath11 and @xmath12",
    ", we follow the same procedure as in romeo & fathi ( 2015 ) , which we re - describe below .",
    "we derive spatial maps of @xmath6 and @xmath8 using two methods in parallel , namely calculating the moment maps and applying gaussian fits to the individual spectra .",
    "we find a good agreement between the moment maps and the results of gaussian fitting .",
    "we also find that our amplitude map matches the zeroth - moment map presented by the bima song team .",
    "one advantage of applying gaussian fits is that we can get better covering maps if we use a hanning smoothing algorithm in the spectral direction before fitting the individual gaussian profiles ( e.g. , hernandez et al .",
    "2005 ; daigle et al .",
    "this procedure does not affect the line amplitude or shift .",
    "however , it artificially broadens the individual spectra by @xmath18 , which we then subtract quadratically from the derived velocity dispersion map .",
    "finally , we apply a cleaning procedure by removing all the spectra for which the emission line amplitude is smaller than twice the rms noise , @xmath8 is smaller than half the velocity channel , and the formal error in the derived @xmath8 is greater than 10 kms@xmath17 .",
    "a careful inspection of the individual spectra reveals the presence of multiple components at different locations ( mostly in the central few 100 pc ) . in view of the good agreement between the moment maps and the single - gaussian fits , and in view of the complications involved in multiple - profile fitting schemes ( blasco - herrera et al .",
    "2010 ) , we do not use profile decomposition methods .",
    "all subsequent analysis is thus based on single - gaussian profile fitting .",
    "we derive @xmath10 and @xmath11 using robust statistics , which are especially useful when the data contain a significant fraction of outliers ( see , e.g. , rousseeuw 1991 ; mller 2000 ; huber & ronchetti 2009 ; feigelson & babu 2012 ) .",
    "this is indeed the case for the @xmath6 and @xmath8 maps , where a non - negligible number of pixel values ( e.g.  those associated with hii regions ) deviate strongly from a normal distribution . to derive the radial profiles of @xmath6 and @xmath8 , we divide their maps into tilted rings , which are circular in the plane of the galaxy , and compute the median values of @xmath6 and @xmath8 in each ring .",
    "we then estimate the uncertainty in these median values via the median absolute deviation ( mad ) : @xmath19 @xmath20 where @xmath21 are the individual measurements of @xmath6 or @xmath8 , @xmath22 is their median value , and @xmath23 is the number of resolution elements in each ring ( i.e.  the number of pixels in the ring divided by the number of pixels per resolution element ) .",
    "eqs ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) are the robust counterparts of the formula traditionally used for estimating the uncertainty in the mean : @xmath24 , where sd denotes the standard deviation ( see again mller 2000 ) .",
    "indeed , the median and the median absolute deviation provide robust statistical estimates of the ` central value ' and the ` width ' of a data set , respectively , even when almost 50% of the data are outliers !",
    "our numerous tests with varying ring widths and radii confirm that the high quality of the bima song data allow a derivation of @xmath6 and @xmath8 in rings narrower than the synthesized beam size of the interferometric observations .",
    "this is mainly thanks to the good sampling of the resolution element .",
    "the smallest reliable step is found to be 200 pc .",
    "this is the step size adopted throughout our analysis . as motivated in sect .",
    "1 , the @xmath6 and @xmath8 profiles presented here are derived up to @xmath25 , but we exclude the central @xmath26 because such a region is disturbed by a massive agn - driven outflow ( garca - burillo et al .  2014 ) .",
    "the @xmath27 surface density is converted to physical units by adopting an @xmath28 conversion factor of @xmath29 , consistent with helfer et al .",
    "we also correct for the contribution of helium multiplying by a factor of 1.36 .",
    "we derive @xmath12 from the observed rotation curve . to calculate the rotation curve",
    ", we assume that circular rotation is the dominant kinematic feature , and that our measurements refer to positions on a single inclined disc .",
    "we then use the tilted ring method combined with the harmonic decomposition formalism ( e.g. , schoenmakers et al .",
    "1997 ; wong et al .  2004",
    "; fathi et al .  2005 ) .",
    "given that this procedure involves fitting several parameters at each radius of the observed velocity field ( contrary to simply finding the median values of @xmath6 and @xmath8 ) , we can not use the same initial step size .",
    "hence we apply a larger radial step , and interpolate linearly to obtain the rotation curve at all radii where we have calculated the robust @xmath6 and @xmath8 values .",
    "once the rotation curve @xmath30 is calculated at each radius @xmath31 , we derive the angular frequency @xmath32 and the epicyclic frequency @xmath33 .",
    "we adopt the high - quality @xmath13 derived by bakos & trujillo ( 2012 ) from stripe 82 of the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ; abazajian et al .",
    "we also adopt the high - quality spatial map of stellar line - of - sight velocity dispersion ( @xmath34 ) derived by fathi ( 2004 ) and emsellem et al .",
    "( 2006 ) from observations with the spectrographic areal unit for research on optical nebulae ( sauron ; bacon et al .",
    "2001 ) .",
    "to derive @xmath14 from the sauron @xmath34 map , we use the following method .",
    "we start from a general formula that expresses the line - of - sight velocity dispersion ( @xmath35 ) in terms of the radial ( @xmath36 ) , tangential ( @xmath37 ) and vertical ( @xmath38 ) components : @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the inclination angle of the galaxy , and @xmath41 is the position angle with respect to the major axis in the plane of the disc ( see , e.g. , binney & merrifield 1998 ) .",
    "we introduce the two parameters @xmath42 and @xmath43 , and rewrite eq .",
    "( 3 ) as @xmath44^{-1/2}\\,.\\ ] ] while @xmath45 ( see sect .",
    "2 ) , both @xmath46 and @xmath47 are significantly different from unity .",
    "in fact , from the epicyclic approximation it follows that @xmath48 ( see , e.g. , binney & tremaine 2008 ) . and , for an sb galaxy like ngc 1068 , @xmath49 ( shapiro et al .",
    "2003 ; gerssen & shapiro griffin 2012 ) .",
    "we estimate @xmath46 and @xmath47 as above , and compute the spatial map of @xmath9 from the sauron @xmath34 map via eq .",
    "( 4 ) . finally ,",
    "we derive @xmath14 using the same method as for @xmath11 , but only up to @xmath50 .",
    "our numerous tests with varying ring radii and widths show that this is the outer limit for extracting reliable stellar velocity dispersions from the sauron data .",
    "we use two disc instability diagnostics derived by romeo & falstad ( 2013 ) :    1 .   a simple and accurate approximation for the @xmath4 stability parameter in multi - component and realistically thick discs ; 2 .",
    "a corresponding approximation for the characteristic instability wavelength , i.e.  the scale at which the disc becomes locally unstable as @xmath4 drops below unity .    in our case ( molecular gas plus stars ) the @xmath4 stability parameter , @xmath51 , and the characteristic instability wavelength , @xmath52 ,",
    "are given by @xmath53 @xmath54 where @xmath55 is the toomre parameter of component @xmath40 , @xmath56 denotes the radial velocity dispersion , and @xmath57 and @xmath58 are given by @xmath59 @xmath60 this set of equations tells us that the values of @xmath51 and @xmath52 are controlled by the component with smaller @xmath61 .",
    "_ this is the component that drives disc instabilities _ if @xmath62 .",
    "the contribution of the other component is weakened by the @xmath58 factor .",
    "the radial profiles of @xmath51 and @xmath52 can easily be computed from the radial profiles derived in sects 2.1 and 2.2 , and from the values of @xmath63 and @xmath64 . if molecular gas is collisional , as is generally assumed , then @xmath65 and @xmath66 .",
    "in contrast , the velocity dispersion anisotropy of stars in ngc 1068 is @xmath67 ( shapiro et al .",
    "2003 ) , hence @xmath68 .    to illustrate the predictive power of a proper two - component stability analysis",
    ", we will also consider molecular gas alone . in this simple case ,",
    "the @xmath4 stability parameter and the characteristic instability wavelength are @xmath69 and @xmath70 .",
    "let us first consider molecular gas , i.e.  the component that is generally regarded as the main driver of disc instabilities in the inner regions of spiral galaxies ( e.g. , kennicutt 1989 ; martin & kennicutt 2001 ; romeo & falstad 2013 ) . fig .",
    "2 illustrates that the radial profile of the surface density , @xmath10 , is ` decapitated ' : a sharp break occurs at the radius of the starburst pseudo - ring and secondary bar ( @xmath2 ) .",
    "another remarkable feature is that @xmath10 exhibits an almost perfect exponential fall - off for @xmath71 , i.e.  approximately between the break radius and the corotation resonance of the secondary bar ( @xmath3 ) .",
    "a robust , median - based , fit yields an exponential scale length of about 230 pc and an extrapolated value of @xmath6 at @xmath26 of about @xmath72 , comparable to the stellar value .",
    "a similar exponential scale length characterizes the nuclear molecular disc of another bar - within - bar galaxy , ngc 6946 ( romeo & fathi 2015 ) , whereas the decapitation of @xmath10 in the central kpc has no match and we regard it as a sign of feedback from the agn and intense starburst activity ( e.g. , karouzos et al .  2014 ; storchi - bergmann 2014 ; agertz & kravtsov 2015 ; hopkins et al .",
    "2015 ; melioli & de gouveia dal pino 2015 ; garca - burillo 2016 ) . as can be seen in fig .  2",
    ", @xmath11 also exhibits an almost perfect exponential fall - off for @xmath71 , so we have also robustly fitted @xmath11 in this radial range and extrapolated the fit back into the central kpc .",
    "the resulting exponential scale length is about 3 kpc and the extrapolated value of @xmath8 at @xmath26 is about 35 kms@xmath17 .",
    "note , however , that the rise of @xmath73 towards the centre can be caused by other factors than agn / stellar feedback , e.g.  disc heating ( romeo & fathi 2015 ) and beam smearing .",
    "3 shows that @xmath74 has a deep minimum at @xmath2 , where its value gets close to unity , while the radial profile of @xmath75 extrapolated using @xmath76 ( solid line ) is well below unity for @xmath77 .",
    "thus the primary effect of agn / stellar feedback is to raise the @xmath75 stability parameter in the central kpc ( compare the data points with the solid line ) .",
    "this quenches molecular - gas instabilities from inside out , leaving the molecular disc marginally unstable only within a narrow radial range : the starburst pseudo - ring .",
    "3 also shows that the radial profile of @xmath75 extrapolated using both @xmath76 and @xmath78 ( dashed line ) is lower than the one extrapolated using only @xmath76 ( solid line ) for @xmath77 .",
    "so the rise of @xmath79 towards the centre strengthens the stabilizing effect of agn / stellar feedback . and",
    "it does so by diluting molecular - gas instabilities over larger scales ( see now the bottom panel of fig .  3 , and compare the data points with the dashed line ) .",
    "last but not least , note that @xmath80 has a clear drop at @xmath3 .",
    "this result confirms ( i ) that the radial profile of the characteristic instability wavelength is a powerful diagnostic for predicting the corotation resonances of bars within bars ( romeo & fathi 2015 ) , and ( ii ) that the corotation radius of the secondary bar in ngc 1068 is @xmath3 ( emsellem et al .",
    "2006 ) .",
    "are disc instabilities really so marginally important in the inner region of ngc 1068 ? and does agn / stellar feedback really have such a strong impact on them ? to answer these questions , we _ must _ consider a component that is still often disregarded when analysing the stability of spiral galaxies : the stars .",
    "4 shows the radial profiles of the two - component @xmath81 stability parameter ( top panel ) and characteristic instability wavelength ( bottom panel ) for the disc of molecular gas and stars in ngc 1068 .",
    "this figure illustrates two important results :    1 .",
    "the inner region of ngc 1068 is subject to violent and large - scale disc instabilities ; 2 .   in the current evolutionary phase of ngc 1068 ,",
    "agn / stellar feedback does not have a strong impact on disc instabilities because these are entirely driven by the stars across a radial range of 2 kpc or more .",
    "these results are consistent with the fact that the inner @xmath1 of ngc 1068 host intense and widespread starburst activity , as discussed in sect .  1 ( e.g. , lester et al .  1987 ; telesco & decher 1988 ; bruhweiler et al .  1991 ; hutchings et al .  1991 ; neff et al .  1994 ; begelman 1997 ; fanelli et al .  1997 ; marcum et al .",
    "2001 ) .     and @xmath9 are the radial velocity dispersions of molecular gas and stars , @xmath82 and @xmath83 are their toomre parameters . outside the ` two - phase region ' ,",
    "the responses of the two components to perturbations are coupled .",
    "so star - driven instabilities can also lead to local gravitational collapse / fragmentation in the molecular gas , and hence to star formation . ]",
    "how can star - driven instabilities lead to star formation ? to answer this question , we should understand in more detail how molecular gas and stars contribute to disc instabilities .",
    "this is shown in fig .",
    "5 . inside the ` two - phase region ' , the contributions of molecular gas and stars to the gravitational instability of the disc peak at two different wavelengths ( bertin & romeo 1988 ; romeo & wiegert 2011 ) . in the ` gaseous phase ' ,",
    "the short - wavelength peak is higher than the other one and molecular gas will dominate the onset of gravitational instability .",
    "vice versa , in the ` stellar phase ' , the long - wavelength peak is higher and stars will dominate .",
    "the shape and size of this region are only moderately affected by disc thickness ( romeo & wiegert 2011 ) , gas turbulence ( hoffmann & romeo 2012 ) or the fact that the stellar component is collisionless ( romeo & falstad 2013 ) . in the rest of the parameter plane , the dynamical responses of the two components are strongly coupled and peak at a single wavelength .",
    "this means that any instability driven by one of the components will also perturb and destabilize the other .",
    "in particular , star - driven instabilities will lead to local gravitational collapse / fragmentation in the molecular gas , and thus to star formation .",
    "this is clearly the case for ngc 1068 , as all of the data fall outside the two - phase region .",
    "in this paper , we have explored the role that gravitational instability plays in ngc 1068 , and its link with star formation , using robust statistics as well as reliable and predictive diagnostics .",
    "our major conclusions are pointed out below .    *",
    "ngc 1068 hosts violent and large - scale disc instabilities , driven by the self - gravity of stars , across the inner 2 kpc .",
    "note that this radius does not mark the transition to local stability ; it is the outer limit for extracting reliable stellar velocity dispersions from the sauron data .",
    "such instabilities lead to local gravitational collapse / fragmentation in the molecular gas , and are thus able to power the intense and widespread starburst activity observed in this galaxy . to the best of our knowledge , this is the first ever direct observational evidence of star - driven instabilities leading to bursts of star formation .",
    "* feedback from the agn and starburst activity tends to quench disc instabilities from inside out by flattening down the surface density of molecular gas across the central kpc . in the current evolutionary phase of ngc 1068 , this is nevertheless a second - order effect since disc instabilities are driven by the much higher stellar surface density , as pointed out above . *",
    "our results illustrate that even localized structures such as the starburst pseudo - ring and the secondary bar produce clear signatures in the radial profiles of the romeo - falstad @xmath4 stability parameter , @xmath84 , and characteristic instability wavelength , @xmath85 .",
    "this confirms , once again , that @xmath84 and @xmath85 are state - of - the - art diagnostics for detecting gravitational instabilities in galaxy discs .",
    "and they are easy to use !",

    "<S> the inner @xmath0 are subject to strong disc instabilities , which power the vigorous starburst activity observed in this galaxy . </S>",
    "<S> agn / stellar feedback tries to quench such instabilities from inside out by ` decapitating ' the surface density of molecular gas , but does not succeed . </S>",
    "<S> gravitational instability ` wins ' because it is driven by the stars via their much higher surface density . </S>",
    "<S> this triggers local gravitational collapse / fragmentation in the molecular gas , and thus star formation .    </S>",
