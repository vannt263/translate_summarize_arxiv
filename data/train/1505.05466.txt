    "in this paper we propose a new probability distribution to handle the problem of survival data .",
    "motivated by research developed in recent years , we introduce the kumaraswany inverse weibull distribution that includes several well known distributions used in survival analysis .",
    "recently , many authors have proposed new classes of distributions , which are modifications of distribution functions which provide hazard ratios contemplating various shapes .",
    "we can cite for example the weibull exponential @xcite , which has also the hazard rate function with a unimodal form , ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "@xcite proposed a four - parameter distribution denoted generalized modified weibull ( gmw ) distribution , @xcite introduced and studied the tri - parametric inverse weibull generalized distribution that possesses failure rate with unimodal , increasing and decreasing forms .",
    "@xcite proposed a distribution with four parameters , called beta generalized half normal distribution .",
    "underexplored in the literature and rarely used by statisticians , the kumaraswamy distribution @xcite has a domain in the real interval @xmath1 .",
    "this property turns the kumaraswamy distribution a natural candidate to combine with other distributions to produce a more general one .",
    "its cumulative distribution function ( cdf ) is given by , @xmath2^b,\\ ] ] and its probability density function ( pdf ) is given by , @xmath3^{b-1 } , ~0<x<1,\\ ] ] where @xmath4 and @xmath5 .",
    "this density can be unimodal , increasing , decreasing or constant .",
    "recently , @xcite proposed to use the kumaraswamy to generalize other distributions . considering that a random variable @xmath6 has distribution @xmath7",
    ", they suggest to apply the kumarasawamy distribution to @xmath8 .",
    "note that , since @xmath9 for any distribution function @xmath7 , then evaluating equation ( [ eq_kum - cdf ] ) at @xmath8 we obtain , @xmath10^b.\\ ] ] where @xmath11 is the cdf of the generalized kumaraswamy-@xmath7 distribution .",
    "based on these ideas , we consider the inverse weibull distribution as a candidate for @xmath7 , using equation ( [ eq_kg ] ) .",
    "then , performing some adjustments and mathematical manipulations , we obtain the kumaraswamy inverse weibull ( kum - iw ) distribution .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec_kum - iw ]",
    ", we develop the kum - iw distribution .",
    "section [ sec : properties ] is devoted to describe basic properties of the distribution .",
    "inference procedures via maximum likelihood and bayesian approaches are presented in section [ sec : estimation ] .",
    "section [ application ] is devoted to analyze a real data set and in section [ sec_final ] we present some conclusions of this work .",

    "in this section we describe in detail some properties like expansions , moments , mean deviations , bonferroni and lorenz curves , order statistics and entropies which might be useful in any application of the distribution .",
    "we now give simple expansions for the cdf of the kumaraswamy inverse weibull distribution . if @xmath43 and @xmath44 is a non - integer real number , we have @xmath45    if @xmath46 is a positive integer , the series stops at @xmath47 . using expansion in equation ( [ 01 ] ) it follows that , @xmath48.\\ ] ] and @xmath49.\\ ] ]    because the integrals involved in the computation of moments , bonferroni and lorenz curves , reliability , shannon and rnyi entropies and other inferential results do not have analytical solutions , these expansions are necessary .      we hardly need to emphasize the need and importance of the moments in any statistical analyses , especially in applied work .",
    "some of the most important features and characteristics of a distribution can be studied using their moments ( e.g. tendency , dispersion , skewness and kurtosis ) .",

    "the amount of scattering in a population may be measured by all the absolute values of the deviations from the mean or the median . if x is a random variable with kum - iw distribution with mean @xmath57 $ ] and median @xmath58 , then the average deviation from the average and the average deviation to the median",
    "are defined respectively by , @xmath59 using the density of extended kum - iw and given that , @xmath60 where @xmath61 is the lower incomplete gamma function , it follows that @xmath62 and @xmath63      bonferroni and lorenz curves are widely applied not only in economics to study income and poverty , but also in other fields such as reliability , demography , insurance and medicine .",

    "the asymptotic normality is also useful for testing goodness of fit of the three parameters the kum - iw distribution and for comparing this distribution with some of its special submodels using one of the two well - known asymptotically equivalent test statistics - namely , the likelihood ratio ( lr ) statistic and the wald and rao score statistics .",
    "following the bayesian paradigm , we need to complete the model specification by specifying a prior distribution for the parameters . by bayes",
    "theorem , the posterior distribution is then proportional to the product of the likelihood function by the prior density .",
    "subjetivism is the predominant philosophical foundation in bayesian inference , although in practice noninformative prior densities ( built on some formal rule ) are frequently used ( @xcite ) .",
