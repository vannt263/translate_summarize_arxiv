    "gw150914 event that has been eventually discovered by the two aligo detectors fits well with a binary black hole inspiraling and merger model @xcite .",
    "it is likely that there exists the innermost stable circular orbit ( isco ) for the binary black hole . in gravitational wave astronomy ,",
    "iscos are thought to be the last circular orbit corresponding to the transition point from the inspiraling phase to the merging one . in the post - newtonian approximation",
    ", the dynamical stability of circular orbits of a two - body system has been studied .",
    "@xcite for a comprehensive review on the post - newtonian approximation : the 1pn term gives exactly the isco radius for the schwarzschild case , but for any mass ratio .",
    "the finite mass corrections on the isco radius appear at the 2pn order . at the 3pn order ,",
    "all the circular orbits are stable when the mass ratio is larger than some critical value @xmath0 ( see e.g. section 8.2 in @xcite ) .",
    "however , there is an isco at the 3pn order , when the mass ratio is smaller than the critical value .",
    "moreover , at the 4pn ( and higher pn ) orders , finite mass corrections on the isco radius may appear @xcite .",
    "in black hole perturbation theory , isoyama et al .",
    "have discussed the isco of a small particle around a kerr black hole and have computed the linear - order correction in the mass ratio @xcite .    in high energy astrophysics ,",
    "furthermore , iscos are related to the inner edge of an accretion disk around a black hole @xcite .",
    "therefore , the iscos would help us to test the nonlinear spacetime geometry that is beyond the solar - system experiments .",
    "it is important to study the nature of the iscos around black holes with electric charges and/or scalar fields @xcite and black holes in modified gravity theories @xcite .",
    "ono et al . have recently reexamined , in terms of sturm s theorem @xcite , marginal stable circular orbits ( mscos ) of a test particle in spherically symmetric and static spacetimes @xcite . the wording `` marginal stable circular orbits '' is used , because the wording `` marginally stable '' has a different meaning in the theory of dynamical systems .",
    "it is interesting to extend such previous works @xcite to stationary and axisymmetric cases , because astrophysical black holes are likely to spin @xcite .",
    "indeed , stute and camenzind have found an equation for the msco radius @xcite , where the particle is assumed to move on the equatorial plane . however , their analysis is limited within the radial perturbation .",
    "the main purpose of this paper is to extend such a msco study to stationary and axisymmetric spacetimes , and furthermore , by taking account of not only the radial perturbation but also the nonradial perturbation . in particular ,",
    "a zenithal stability criterion for a test particle in a msco is derived in terms of the metric components , the specific energy and angular momentum of a test particle .",
    "we shall apply the proposed approach to three models : kerr solution , majumdar - papapetrou solution to the einstein equation @xcite , and johannsen and psaltis s model of a rapidly spinning black hole in modified gravity @xcite .    throughout this paper ,",
    "we use the unit of @xmath1 .",
    "we consider a stationary axisymmetric spacetime .",
    "the line element for this spacetime is @xcite @xmath2 where @xmath3 run from @xmath4 to @xmath5 , @xmath6 take @xmath7 and @xmath8 , @xmath9 and @xmath10 coordinates are associated with the killing vectors , and @xmath11 is a two - dimensional symmetric tensor .",
    "it is more convenient to reexpress this metric into a form in which @xmath11 is diagonalized .",
    "the present paper prefers the polar coordinates rather than the cylindrical ones , because we consider the kerr metric and its modified metric by johannsen and psaltis @xcite in the polar coordinates .",
    "then , eq . ( [ ds-0 ] ) becomes @xcite @xmath12    the present paper focuses on a test particle outside the horizon .",
    "then , @xmath13 .",
    "this leads to @xmath14 , @xmath15 and @xmath16 .",
    "we assume also a local reflection symmetry with respect to the equatorial plane as @xcite @xmath17 where we choose @xmath18 as the equatorial plane .",
    "we denote the contravariant metric tensor as @xmath19    let us define the lagrangian of the test particle as @xmath20 where the dot denotes the derivative with respect to the proper time .",
    "there are two constants of motion for the test body , because the spacetime is stationary and axisymmetric .",
    "@xmath21 where @xmath22 and @xmath23 are corresponding to the specific energy and the specific angular momentum , respectively .",
    "let us examine linear perturbations around the equatorial marginal circular orbit ( denoted as @xmath24 ) , in which the perturbed position is denoted as @xmath25 and @xmath26 .",
    "we consider the geodesic equation at the perturbed position and examine the linear parts in @xmath27 and @xmath28 .",
    "straightforward calculations show that @xmath27-parts and @xmath29-ones are decoupled with each other in the geodesic equation .",
    "first , we consider the @xmath30-component of the geodesic equation in the taylor series approximation such as @xmath31 , where we use the local reflection symmetry of the metric with respect to the equatorial plane , and @xmath32 and @xmath33 are rewritten in terms of @xmath22 and @xmath23 by using eqs .",
    "( [ e ] ) and ( [ l ] ) .",
    "hence , we obtain @xmath34 at the zeroth order ( namely , @xmath35 and @xmath36 ) and @xmath37 at the linear order , where @xmath38 denotes the position at @xmath35 and @xmath36 .",
    "next , the @xmath39-component of the geodesic equation gives us a stable condition to the zenithal perturbation as @xmath40 which plays a crucial role in this paper .",
    "the inequality sign changes if the orbit is unstable against the zenithal perturbation . henceforth , we omit the notation @xmath38 for brevity .",
    "see e.g. page 362 in chandrasekhar ( 1998 ) for a description of the @xmath39-motion in a well - known black hole solution such as kerr solution @xcite .",
