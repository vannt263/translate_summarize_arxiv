    "complex dynamics has been a field of intense study over the last thirty years .",
    "the striking computer generated images of the mandelbrot set helped inspire this surge of activity and showed how very complicated behaviour can arise from very simply defined iterative systems . yet",
    "complex dynamics had its first burst of interest at the end of the nineteenth and into the beginning of the twentieth centuries .",
    "koenigs and bttcher classified the behaviour of holomorphic functions near fixed points by conjugating to simpler functions . in a neighbourhood of a fixed point",
    ", a holomorphic function can be conjugated to either @xmath5 or @xmath2 depending on whether or not the holomorphic function is injective in a neighbourhood of the fixed point .",
    "see milnor s book @xcite for an exposition of these ideas .",
    "quasiconformal mappings and quasiregular mappings provide natural higher dimensional analogues for holomorphic functions in the plane . informally speaking ,",
    "quasiregular mappings are mappings which allow a bounded amount of distortion .",
    "they share many value distributional properties with holomorphic functions , for example versions of picard s and montel s theorems hold , but they are more flexible than holomorphic functions .",
    "the only holomorphic functions in @xmath6 for @xmath7 are mbius transformations , and so it is natural to allow distortion to have an interesting function theory . see rickman s",
    "book @xcite for an introduction to the theory of quasiregular mappings .",
    "much more is known about quasiregular mappings in the planar setting : every quasiregular mapping has a _ stoilow decomposition _ , that is , it can be written as a composition of a holomorphic function and a quasiconformal mapping .",
    "the holomorphic part takes care of the branching and the quasiconformal part takes care of the distortion .",
    "the main reason that more is known in the plane is due to the measurable riemann mapping theorem , which states that solutions of the beltrami differential equation @xmath8 for @xmath9 with @xmath10 are quasiconformal mappings which can be assumed to fix @xmath11 and @xmath12 .",
    "conversely , given a quasiconformal mapping @xmath13 , its _ complex dilatation _",
    "@xmath14 is contained in the unit ball of @xmath15 .",
    "the measurable riemann mapping theorem was used by douady and hubbard , and sullivan to great effect in the 1980s in proving fundamental results in complex dynamics .",
    "see branner and fagella s book @xcite for a survey of the use of quasiconformal and quasiregular methods in modern complex dynamics .",
    "more recently , there has been an interest in studying the iteration of quasiregular mappings themselves .",
    "a composition of quasiregular mappings is again quasiregular .",
    "however , the distortion of the iterates of a quasiregular mapping will typically increase .",
    "this means the machinery available from montel s theorem is unavailable to help with the iterative theory .",
    "remarkably , it is still possible to say quite a lot about the dynamics of quasiregular mappings when there is not a uniform bound on the distortion of the iterates .",
    "see for example the recent works of bergweiler @xcite .      in section 2 , we will recall the definition of quasiconformal and quasiregular mappings , with focus on the planar case . taking as an inspiration the work of douady and hubbard in studying the simplest non - trivial polynomials @xmath16 ,",
    "an initial step for studying quasiregular mappings in the plane is to study those which are the simplest : using the stoilow decompostion , these are mappings which can be written as a composition of a power of @xmath17 and a quasiconformal mapping of constant complex dilatation . these were first studied in @xcite and in more detail for the degree two case in @xcite .",
    "we remark that similar quasiregular perturbations of polynomials were studied in @xcite .    by construction ,",
    "every such mapping maps rays emanating from @xmath18 onto rays and so every such mapping induces a degree @xmath19 circle endomorphism .",
    "the major insight here is that such a circle map is strongly related to a particular blaschke product and the dynamics of the blaschke product has strong implications for the dynamics of the original quasiregular mapping .",
    "in particular , every fixed point of the blaschke product corresponds to either a fixed ray of the quasiregular mapping or a pair of opposite rays which switch . here , the cases of even or odd @xmath19 are different .",
    "further , the julia set of a blaschke product is either the whole circle or a cantor subset of it .",
    "we classify the type of the quasiregular mapping in terms of the complex dilatation by relating it to the parameter space of degree @xmath19 unicritical blaschke products .",
    "we next show that for such quasiregular mappings , the plane breaks into three dynamically interesting sets : the basins of attraction of @xmath18 and @xmath12 respectively and the boundary between them .",
    "we show that as long as the distortion is smaller than the degree , the boundary is the julia set of the quasiregular mapping .",
    "otherwise there are cases when the boundary of basins of attraction fails to have the necessary blowing - up property required for the julia set .",
    "an important point in the analysis of these mappings is that they are not uniformly quasiregular .",
    "for otherwise they would just be quasiconformal conjugates of holomorphic mappings and this study would not be of independent interest .",
    "we will show that in fact the distortion of the iterates blows up at every point for such mappings .",
    "finally , we show how to construct a bttcher type coordinate for a fixed point of a quasiregular mapping for which the complex dilatation is constant in a neighbourhood of the fixed point .",
    "this allows the results from the rest of the paper to be applied locally .",
    "see @xcite for the degree @xmath20 case of such a bttcher coordinate .",
