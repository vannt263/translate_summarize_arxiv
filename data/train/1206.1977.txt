    "lattice qcd is the most powerful tool to investigate such non - perturbative aspects of qcd .",
    "indeed , the lattice qcd simulation has been applied to the finite - temperature qcd with zero density , and has produced lots of works to investigate the critical or crossover behavior due to confinement and deconfinement transition ( see for example @xcite ) .",
    "however , the monte - carlo simulation can not be easily applied to qcd with chemical potential because of the notorious sign problem ( see references in @xcite ) .",
    "there have been developed several prescriptions to bypass this problem , including the imaginary chemical potential method , the taylor expansion , the fugacity expansion and the histogram method ( see references in @xcite ) .",
    "apart from the numerical simulation , the analytical lattice study have been also developed .",
    "one of the classical and reliable methods is the strong - coupling expansion @xcite .",
    "this method has been applied to the qcd phase diagram and has produced successful results @xcite . in these works , ( unrooted )",
    "staggered fermions @xcite have been used , thus the corresponding continuum theory is 4-flavor qcd although the physical two or three - flavor qcd are desirable .    in this paper",
    "we propose a new framework of investigating the 2-flavor finite-(@xmath3 ) qcd phase diagram by using the karsten - wilczek ( kw ) lattice fermion discretization @xcite .",
    "this lattice formulation lifts degeneracy of 16 species by introducing a species - dependent ( imaginary ) chemical potential term , instead of introducing a species - dependent mass term in wilson fermion .",
    "the most notable point is that it can reduce the number of species to 2 with keeping @xmath4 chiral symmetry .",
    "it is sometimes called  minimal - doubling fermions \" @xcite or  flavored - chemical - potential(fcp ) fermions \" @xcite .",
    "the phase structure in the parameter plane for them has been recently studied in @xcite . in the present work",

    "the karsten - wilczek ( kw ) fermion discretization decouples 14 among the 16 species in the naive fermion by introducing a species - dependent imaginary chemical potential term without losing all the chiral symmetry and ultra - locality @xcite .",
    "this is a special case of `` flavored - chemical - potential ( fcp ) fermions '' @xcite , which includes a real - potential type and an imaginary - potential type .",
    "the kw fermion is an imaginary - type fcp fermion and can describe two flavors with a proper parameter value , as is called `` minimal - doubling '' @xcite . since the flavored chemical potential term breaks discrete symmetries @xcite , we need to fine - tune the three parameters for one dimension-3 ( @xmath7 ) and two dimension-4 ( @xmath8 , @xmath9 ) counterterms in order to take a correct lorentz - symmetric continuum limit for the zero-(@xmath0,@xmath1 ) qcd simulations @xcite .",
    "however , as we will see later , the discrete symmetries of kw fermions suit the finite - temperature and -density system , and the severe fine - tuning to restore lorentz symmetry would not be required for this case : what we need to care about in this case is the dimension-3 operator which corresponds to an @xmath2 chemical potential term .",
    "this fact inspires us to apply the kw fermion to the in - medium qcd .",
    "we study the karsten - wilczek fermion and its symmetries in comparison with other lattice fermions with chemical potential .",
    "the @xmath10-d kw action with @xmath4 chiral symmetry and ultra - locality is obtained by introducing a wilson - like term proportional to @xmath11 into the naive fermion action as @xmath12 , \\label{smd }   \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the second line with a parameter @xmath13 is a flavored - chemical - potential term , which works to lift the degeneracy of species .",
    "the third line with a relevant parameter @xmath6 is a dimension-3 counterterm , which corresponds to an @xmath2 chemical potential term .",
    "( 2011 ) the authors discussed difficulty of defining hermiticity in the minimal - doubling fermions .",
    "however it is always the case with lattice fermions with ( imaginary ) chemical potential , which lose the pt invariance .",
    "their argument does not mean any problem peculiar to the formulations . ]",
    "if one drops @xmath14 in front of the second and third lines , this becomes a real - type karsten - wilczek fermion without @xmath15 hermiticity while we in this paper focus on the imaginary - type kw fermion basically .",
    "for the free theory , the associated dirac operator in momentum space is given by @xmath16 for @xmath17 and @xmath18 , it has only two zeros at @xmath19 .",
    "the rest 14 species have @xmath2 imaginary chemical potential due to the flavored - chemical - potential term . more precisely , among the original 16 species , two have zero imaginary chemical potential , six have @xmath20 , six have @xmath21 and two have @xmath22 . in the naive continuum limit , the 14 species are decoupled with infinite imaginary chemical potential and there remains only two flavors as shown in fig .",

    "since the cubic symmetry is likely to be enhanced to the 3d rotation symmetry in the continuum , we expect that these symmetries become those of the finite - density qcd in the continuum limit . to convince ourselves , let us look into symmetries of the naive lattice fermion with chemical potential , which is introduced as a 4th - direction abelian gauge field .",
    "the massless naive action with chemical potential is given by @xmath26 \\label{smu}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the chemical potential breaks the hypercubic symmetry into the spatial cubic symmetry .",
    "it also breaks c , p and t symmetries into ct and p. these discrete symmetries are the same as those of karsten - wilczek fermion as shown above . from the viewpoint of the universality class ,",
    "these two theories belong to the same class .",
    "we therefore consider that the kw fermion suits in - medium lattice qcd much better than zero-(@xmath0,@xmath1 ) lattice qcd",
    ".    however , we have to care about the way of introducing chemical potential . in kw fermions the flavored imaginary chemical potential",
    "is introduced naively as @xmath7 while the chemical potential is usually introduced as a 4th - direction abelian gauge field on the lattice as shown in ( [ smu ] ) . as is well - known @xcite",
    ", the naive introduction of chemical potential violates the abelian gauge invariance and requires a counterterm to make the energy density and other thermodynamical quantities finite .",
    "we can discuss the necessity of a counterterm also from the viewpoint of the additive renormalization : we remind ourselves that the wilson fermion breaks chiral symmetry by @xmath2 flavored - mass terms , which leads to the additive mass renormalization and the necessity of the mass parameter tuning in the interacting theory .",
    "now the kw fermion breaks discrete symmetries into those of finite - density systems by @xmath2 flavored - chemical - potential terms .",
    "these facts indicate that we will here encounter large chemical potential renormalization instead of the additive mass renormalization in wilson fermion .",
    "this is why we need to introduce the dimension-3 counterterm as @xmath27 in the action ( [ smd ] ) even for the application to finite - density qcd .",
    "the zero - chemical - potential two flavors for a free case in ( [ smdp ] ) suffer @xmath2 imaginary chemical potential renormalization in the interacting theory .",
    "we thus need to tune @xmath6 to control it even if we apply it to the finite - density qcd .",
    "as the additive mass renormalization in wilson fermion is manifested in the phase diagram in a ( @xmath28@xmath29 ) plane @xcite , the chemical potential renormalization can be manifested in a phase diagram in a ( @xmath6@xmath29 ) plane .",

    "we name them as `` physical '' and `` unphysical '' phases since the physical qcd has ssb of chiral symmetry at least .",

    "( on boundaries between the sectors @xmath36 , fermions have unusual dispersions as @xmath37 , which can not be fixed even by tuning parameters .",
    "we therefore avoid these points . )",
    "there are no fermion flavors outside these four sectors , but only unphysical fermions with @xmath2 chemical potential .    as seen from fig .",
    "[ al ] , the boundaries between physical @xmath38 and unphysical @xmath39 phases start from boundaries between the two - flavor and no - flavor sectors in the weak - coupling limit .",
    "it is reasonable since ssb of chiral symmetry can take place only in theories with fermions .",
    "we especially call the two - flavor range `` minimal - doubling range '' . for @xmath17 the minimal - doubling range is given by @xmath40 and @xmath41 . toward the strong coupling limit , these ranges are expected to change with @xmath29 as fig .",
    "we note that the minimal - doubling range and the 6-flavor range become less distinguishable with the gauge coupling being larger .    from the viewpoints of practical application , the relevant parameter @xmath6 has to be tuned to cancel the @xmath2 imaginary chemical potential renormalization for the two flavors as discussed in the previous subsection . in the weak - coupling limit ,",
    "it is obvious that the two flavors feel no chemical potential as long as we set @xmath6 in the minimal - doubling range as @xmath40 or @xmath41 for @xmath17 .",
    "we consider that it carries over in the interacting theory : for a given gauge coupling , in order to cancel the @xmath2 effective chemical potential for the two flavors , we have to set a value of @xmath6 in the minimal - doubling range . as conjectured in fig .",

    "since the present lattice simulation can be applied only to systems with small @xmath44 or with @xmath47 , the most feasible application of the kw fermion for now could be the imaginary - chemical - potential lattice qcd .",
    "in such a case we can in principle describe two flavors with arbitrary @xmath47 by keeping @xmath6 within the minimal - doubling range and adjusting @xmath47 properly .",

    "the same behavior is observed in staggered fermions  @xcite , and it is found that the region with the positive slope boundary narrows or disappears with finite coupling effects in staggered fermion  @xcite .",
    "we note that in @xmath141 case , we have nonzero @xmath61 condensate as shown in fig .",
    "[ condensate_r075 ] , where we show @xmath52 and @xmath61 as functions of @xmath111 for several fixed @xmath0 .",
    "this @xmath61 condensate also undergoes a phase transition with the chiral transition . since @xmath61 is an auxiliary field for the operator @xmath152 , an absolute value of this vector condensate is deeply related to density .",
    "the point is that this condensate still remains for @xmath116 .",
    "it is quite natural since the @xmath42 renormalized imaginary chemical potential @xmath153 due to quantum effects can survive even if we set @xmath6 in the minimal - doubling range to eliminate the @xmath2 imaginary chemical potential , as we discussed in sec .",
    "thus , the physical imaginary chemical potential is given by the sum of the effective one @xmath153 and a usual @xmath42 parameter @xmath47 as @xmath154 .",
    "it suggests that one possible way to control @xmath155 in lattice qcd is to check the size of @xmath61 condensate .",
    "the existence of @xmath153 also affects the @xmath6 dependence of critical lines : in fig .",
    "[ pb_3d ] we change @xmath6 and depict a three - dimensional chiral phase diagram for @xmath0 , @xmath131 and @xmath6 for @xmath17 .",
    "it shows that the critical line changes with @xmath6 being varied .",
    "as far as we keep @xmath6 in the physical range , the @xmath2 effective chemical potential for the physical flavors is cancelled . as discussed above , however , we still have @xmath42 contribution as @xmath153 .",
    "we can interpret that the dependence of the critical line on @xmath6 comes from the dependence of @xmath153 on @xmath6 as @xmath156 .",
    "in this section we have obtained the finite-(@xmath0,@xmath1 ) qcd phase diagram in the strong - coupling limit . to be precise ,",
    "since the theory effectively contains the renormalized imaginary chemical potential as the kw artifact , it should be called the finite-(@xmath0,@xmath44,@xmath47 ) qcd phase diagram . anyhow",
    ", we have shown that we can apply the kw fermion to in - medium lattice qcd .",
    "we lastly discuss the real - type fcp fermions @xcite . as shown in sec .",
    "[ sec : mdf ] , we can also consider the real - type kw fermion , which loses @xmath15 hermiticity .",
    "we can perform the strong - coupling qcd analysis for this type in a parallel way , and can derive the qcd phase diagram as long as the relevant parameter is set to the physical range . in the practical lattice qcd simulations , however , we should encounter a severe sign problem with the real - type fcp fermion even for zero - density cases .",
    "we need further study to judge its applicability to lattice qcd .    , @xmath131 and @xmath157 for @xmath87 where @xmath6 runs within half of the physical range @xmath158 .",
    "green , red and purple lines show 2nd , 1st order transitions and tricritical point , respectively .",
    "the critical chemical potential at @xmath84 is explicitly given by ( [ zero_temp_crit_chem_pot ] ) . ]",
    "in this paper we propose a new framework for investigating the two - flavor finite-(@xmath0,@xmath1 ) qcd phase diagram .",
    "we show that the discrete symmetries of the karsten - wilczek ( kw ) fermion strongly suggest its applicability to the in - medium lattice qcd .",
    "to support our idea , we study the strong - coupling lattice qcd in the medium and derive the phase diagram of chiral symmetry for finite temperature and chemical potential .",
    "we have obtained the phase diagram with 1st , 2nd - order and crossover critical lines , which is qualitatively in agreement to results from the model study .",
    "we also argue that the additive chemical potential renormalization to the two flavors can be controlled by adjusting the parameter of the dimension-3 counterterm .    in sec .",
    "[ sec : mdf ] we review the karsten - wilczek fermion and its discrete symmetries . by the careful comparison between the kw fermion and naive lattice fermions with chemical potential , we find that both possess the same discrete symmetries , and that kw fermion is a proper formulation for finite-(@xmath0,@xmath1 ) lattice qcd study .",
    "it is natural since the kw fermion decouples 14 doublers by assigning them @xmath2 imaginary chemical potential , which also leads to the additive chemical potential renormalization for the rest 2 flavors in the interacting theory .",
    "we discuss that , in order to control this effective imaginary chemical potential , we need to keep a value of the relevant parameter @xmath6 within the minimal - doubling range in fig .",
    "it is more modest but similar tuning to the mass parameter tuning in wilson fermion .",
    "one possible indicator of the parameter ranges is the pion spectrum : if @xmath6 is in the no - flavor range , there is no ssb of chiral symmetry and no massless pion",
    ". if @xmath6 gets into the six - flavor region , the number of pseudo nambu - goldstone bosons increases . in sec .",
    "[ sec : slq ] we perform the strong - coupling finite-(@xmath0,@xmath1 ) lattice qcd with the kw fermion .",
    "we derive the effective potential of @xmath52 and @xmath48 as a function of temperature @xmath0 , chemical potential @xmath1 , and @xmath6 . as long as keeping @xmath6 within the physical range in fig .",
    "[ al ] , we successfully obtain the qcd chiral phase diagram , which is consistent with the phenomenological predictions : for high temperature or large chemical potential the chiral symmetry restores with chiral condensate s disappearing .",
    "our result strongly suggests that the karsten - wilczek fermion , or more generally flavored - chemical - potential fermions are useful for the 2-flavor lattice qcd with temperature and density .",
    "one potential problem for this formulation is that , even if we can set @xmath6 in the minimal - doubling range , the rest 14 species with infinitely large chemical potential may contribute to the thermodynamical quantities .",
    "in such a case we need to subtract a divergent part properly .",
    "further study is needed to figure out this problem .",
    "finally we comment on the lattice qcd with this formulation in the small chemical potential limit .",
    "the minimal - doubling fermion breaks the spatial symmetry even for a zero chemical potential limit unless we fine - tune two more parameters to restore the hypercubic symmetry @xcite .",
    "we thus expect that this formulation could be less effective to describe the two - flavor qcd for smaller chemical potential although it works for the region near critical lines with sufficiently large chemical potential .",
