    "ab initio _ nuclear structure calculations starting with a realistic nucleon - nucleon ( nn ) interaction have been possible beyond few - nucleon systems . in this kind of study ,",
    "the microscopic derivation of an effective interaction from the realistic nn interaction allows one to perform the structure calculation in a restricted model space .",
    "one of the successful methods of the structure calculation in this direction would be the no - core shell model ( ncsm )  @xcite . in the ncsm , the microscopic effective interaction ( hamiltonian ) that takes account of the short - range correlation of the original nn interaction can be derived through a unitary transformation of the original hamiltonian .",
    "although the shell - model diagonalization is done in a large model space so that the final results do not depend on the model - space size , such a model space is still much smaller than the huge hilbert space of the original hamiltonian .",
    "the microscopic understanding of nuclear structure has been growing through the ncsm as well as the green s function monte carlo ( gfmc )  @xcite in which the original nn interaction and a three - nucleon force can be directly used .",
    "however , although the gfmc and the ncsm are powerful method to describe nuclear structure , the application of these methods to the nuclear structure calculation may be limited to light nuclei up to @xmath3 due to the present computer power .",
    "if one wishes to describe heavier nuclei , one needs to have another method .",
    "one of the promising methods may be the unitary - model - operator approach ( umoa )  @xcite .",
    "the umoa can be regarded as one of the coupled - cluster methods ( ccm )  @xcite of hermitian type . as for recent developments of the ccm in nuclear theory",
    ", one may refer to refs .",
    "@xcite . in the umoa",
    ", an energy independent and hermitian effective interaction is derived through a unitary transformation of the original hamiltonian  @xcite which is essentially the same as the unitary transformation used in the ncsm . by doing the unitary transformation in a two - step procedure",
    ", the structure calculation can be performed beyond @xmath4-shell nuclei .",
    "so far , we have performed structure calculations for not only stable nuclei around @xmath1o  @xcite but also neutron - rich oxygen isotopes  @xcite and @xmath5 hypernuclei  @xcite . in the following sections",
    ", we shall outline the calculation method of the umoa and present recent results for nuclei around @xmath0c , @xmath1o and @xmath2ca .",
    "in the umoa , the hamiltonian @xmath6 to be considered is obtained through a unitary transformation of the original hamiltonian @xmath7 as @xmath8 .",
    "the exponent @xmath9 is an anti - hermitian operator and written as @xmath10  @xcite with a mapping operator @xmath11 under the restrictive conditions @xmath12 , where @xmath13 and @xmath14 are the usual projection operators and have the properties as @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath17 and @xmath18 .",
    "thus , the operator @xmath19 satisfies the relation @xmath20 . we should note here that the unitary - transformation operator @xmath21 is also given by a block form concerning the @xmath13 and @xmath14 spaces as @xmath22 which agrees with the unitary transformation by @xmath23kubo  @xcite . by applying the above unitary transformation to a two - body subsystem of the original hamiltonian , the two - body effective interaction @xmath24 of hermitian type is given by @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the one - body part and @xmath27 is the bare two - body interaction .",
    "the effective interaction in the @xmath13 and , if necessary , @xmath14 spaces is determined by solving the decoupling equation @xmath28 .",
    "the actual method of calculating the matrix elements of @xmath29 and @xmath24 with the harmonic - oscillator ( h.o . ) basis states in the neutron - proton ( @xmath30 ) formalism may be found in ref .",
    "@xcite .      in order to make the structure calculation in an inexpensive way",
    ", we perform the unitary transformation twice as follows .",
    "first , we derive the two - body effective interaction in a large model space to take into account the short - range correlation of the original nn interaction .",
    "the large model space consisting of two - body states is specified by a boundary number @xmath31 which is given with the sets of h.o .",
    "quantum numbers @xmath32 and @xmath33 of the two - body states by @xmath34 .",
    "the value of @xmath31 is taken as large as possible so that the calculated results do not depend on this value . if we diagonalize the transformed hamiltonian with the many - body shell - model basis states using the effective interaction in the large model space , that leads to the ncsm",
    ". however , the calculations for heavier nuclei such as @xmath1o and @xmath2o may not be practical in this manner because the present computer can not diagonalize the huge matrix elements of the hamiltonian which is large enough to obtain the converged results .",
    "if we intend to obtain only the energies of the ground states of closed - shell nuclei and the single - particle ( -hole ) states in its neighboring nuclei , it would be convenient to perform the unitary - transformation again as follows .",
    "we define a small _ model _ space @xmath35 and its _ complement _ @xmath36 by separating the large model space in the previous procedure as shown in fig .",
    "[ mspace2 ] .",
    "the symbols @xmath37 and @xmath38 in fig .",
    "[ mspace2 ] stand for the uppermost occupied states of the neutron and proton , respectively .",
    "we here only show the @xmath30 channel .",
    "it should be noted that the @xmath35 and @xmath36 spaces are considered on an equal footing in this second - step calculation when we solve the decoupling equation for the effective interaction @xmath39 in this step as @xmath40 using the effective interaction determined in the first - step calculation as an input .",
    "namely , we derive the effective interaction again in the large model space . however , by taking the @xmath41 space @xmath35 and its @xmath42 @xmath36 as shown in fig .  [ mspace2 ] , the resultant effective interaction @xmath39 in this second step has no vertices which induce two - particle two - hole ( @xmath43 ) excitation .",
    "this is analogous to the hartree - fock ( hf ) condition which means that an original hamiltonian is transformed so that the matrix elements for @xmath44 excitation reduce to zero .",
    "although the vertices of the one - body non - diagonal matrix elements remain in determining the effective interaction in the umoa , these non - diagonal matrix elements are diagonalized at the end of the structure calculation .",
    "we notice that the two - body effective interaction in the first- and second - step calculations is determined self - consistently with the one - body potential for both the particle and hole states .",
    "although this procedure is not necessarily needed in determining the effective interaction , such an effective interaction may be optimized for a restricted model space so as to obtain a good unperturbed energy .",
    "the spaces consisting of two - body states for the @xmath30 channel considered in the second - step calculation for the effective interaction . ]",
    "we here show an example of the effect of renormalizing @xmath43 excitation in the second - step calculation for the cd - bonn potential  @xcite .",
    "the unperturbed ground - state energies of @xmath1o for @xmath45 and @xmath46 mev using the effective interactions determined in the first- and second - step calculations are @xmath47 and @xmath48 mev , respectively .",
    "this means that a large amount of the @xmath43 effect is renormalized into the effective interaction in the small @xmath41 space in the second - step calculation . in order to obtain the final result including the rest correlation effects , we diagonalize the transformed hamiltonian with the shell - model basis states , taking into account @xmath44 excitation from the unperturbed ground state . as for the closed - shell nucleus plus one - particle ( one - hole ) system , the shell - model basis states are composed of the @xmath49 and @xmath50 states ( @xmath51 and @xmath52 states ) .",
    "these correlation energies are added to the unperturbed ground - state energies , and then we obtain the final results of the ground - state energies of the closed - shell nucleus and the closed - shell nucleus plus one - particle ( one - hole ) system .",
    "we note here that there remain some correction terms to be evaluated , such as the three - body cluster terms .",
    "although the three - body cluster effect is essentially small , that may have a significant effect for some particular cases .",
    "actually , we have found that the evaluation of the three - body cluster effect plays an important role to describe shell structure in neutron - rich oxygen isotopes  @xcite .",
    "however , generally speaking , the magnitude of the three - body cluster effect is much smaller than the two - body cluster effect , and thus the cluster expansion of the transformed hamiltonian is justified from the viewpoint of the perturbative expansion . in the next section ,",
    "we show some of the recent results which do not include the three - body cluster effect . the results including the three - body cluster effect will be reported elsewhere in the near future .",

    "are also shown .",
    "the coulomb force is used commonly .",
    "the results for the nijm  93 and the cd  bonn are the least and most attractive , respectively , of the four potentials . this tendency can also be observed in the faddeev - yakubovsky calculations for @xmath68he by nogga _ et al _",
    "it is seen that the calculated ground - state energies are less bound than the experimental value . in the present results , higher - order correlations such as the three - body cluster terms",
    "have not been evaluated .",
    "if we include the effect of the three - body cluster terms , the calculated results become more attractive by a few mev .",
    "for example , in the case of the cd - bonn potential , the three - body cluster effect is about @xmath69 mev .",
    "however , even if we add this value to the ground - state energy in table  [ tab : o16_gs ] , the result is less attractive than the experimental value . in the present calculation , a genuine three - body force is not included .",
    "the inclusion of the real three - body force and the higher - order many - body correlations would compensate for the discrepancies between the experimental and calculated values . such a study remains as an important task for a deeper understanding of nuclear ground - state properties in the umoa .    in fig .",

    "the values in fig .",
    "[ oxygen ] are the spin - orbit splitting energies for hole states in @xmath67o and particle states in @xmath66o .",
    "we see that the calculated spin - orbit splittings for the hole states in @xmath67o are smaller than the experimental value . as for the spin - orbit splittings for the particle states",
    "@xmath66o , as opposed to the hole - state case , the energies are larger than the experimental value",
    ". this may be due to an insufficient treatment for the @xmath70 unbound state in the present calculation .",
    "we have used only the h.o .",
    "states as the basis states .",
    "however , we may say that the calculated spin - orbit splittings for the hole and particle states in nuclei around @xmath1o are , on the whole , not very different from the experimental values though the results somewhat depend on the interactions employed .",
    "the magnitudes of remaining discrepancies may be reduced if we include the genuine three - body force in the calculation and evaluate the higher - order cluster terms .",

    "we are now trying to do calculations for heavier systems . here",
    "we show some of the preliminary results for @xmath2ca .",
    "figure  [ ca40 ] shows the @xmath31 and @xmath71 dependences of the ground - state energy with the @xmath44 effect for the cd - bonn potential .",
    "it is seen that a fairly convergent result is obtained at @xmath72 and @xmath73 mev . though we are now calculating for @xmath74 , the difference of the results between @xmath72 and @xmath74",
    "would be a few mev at most . in the case of @xmath1o , the convergent result can be obtained at @xmath75 .",
    "since we are now calculating heavier systems , we need a larger model space to obtain the convergent result .    in fig .",
    "[ c15 ] , we show calculated single - particle energies in a neutron - rich nucleus @xmath67c together with the experimental values .",

    "kinetic energy plus the self - consistent one - body potential determined in the second - step calculation . in @xmath67c , the ordering of the experimental single - particle @xmath76 and @xmath77 states are opposite to the case of @xmath66o",
    ". however , our result for  unpt . \" does not reproduce this tendency , and the single - particle levels are rather repulsive to the experimental values . however , if we see the results with the @xmath50 effect by the diagonalization as shown in the middle of fig .",
    "[ c15 ] , the results become more attractive and the two levels are reversed , and then a good agreement with the experimental value is obtained .",
