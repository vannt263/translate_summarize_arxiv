    "a pulsed magnetic field at nanosecond timescale is used to study field - driven domain wall propagation @xcite or to trigger magnetization reversal in magnetic nanoparticles @xcite .",
    "both phenomena are important for magnetic data storage .",
    "pulsed magnetic fields are also useful for optical studies of magnetization or single spin relaxation in quantum semiconductor structures @xcite .",
    "furthermore , a pulsed magnetic field is of a great importance for switching `` on '' and `` off '' resonance processes in quantum systems that exhibit magnetic field - dependent separation of energy levels .",
    "for example , two qubits , when properly tuned by a magnetic field , may exchange a single photon , which leads to a creation of entangled states @xcite .",
    "the same methodology can be also employed for qubit / resonator @xcite or qubit / spin ensemble @xcite systems .",
    "it is relatively easy to deliver a fast rising magnetic field perpendicular to the film plane without losing the ability to observe the sample surface . a few loop coil wound around the structure provides the required field @xcite .",
    "this is a rather efficient method since a maximum of the magnetic field can easily be centered on the studied object without disturbing the access to the film plane . however , if we want to apply the field parallel to the sample surface the situation is quite different .",
    "well , we can wind a coil and insert the sample with its surface parallel to the coil long axis but at the cost of losing the direct access to the surface .",
    "if an open access is required one has to consider another designs ( fig.[fig:1 ] ) : ( i ) the structure of interest is inserted or fabricated right at the top of a stripline @xcite , ( ii ) the sample resides in the gap of the split - pair helmholtz coil or in a horseshoe magnetic circuit or ( iii ) one can use the field licking outside the ordinary air - core coil or ferrite - core coil .    in the next section",
    "we analyze the effectiveness of the above three methods .",
    "we then present our design and its optimization .",
    "this is followed by the description of minicoil assembly , testing and calibration .",
    "next , experimental results on magnetic domain velocity are presented .",
    "subsequently , prior to the summary , an outlook on some possible extensions of our design is presented .",
    "defining the structure under study at the top of a strip line should guarantee the best coupling of the structure to the field since mutual distance can be kept at the level of nanometers ( in case of metallic structure one needs to define a spacer between stripline and the structure ) .",
    "the solution seems to be ultimate for ultra fast magnetic field pulses ( @xmath3 ) @xcite since the inductance @xmath4 can be made sufficiently small and rise times for the current in the stripline scale with @xmath4 .",
    "however , it is not always possible to fabricate such an integrated sample or it may be simply experimentally inefficient .",
    "the second limitation is related to the maximum current which may flow in a stripline due to its small thickness .",
    "one must be also conscious of the skin effects which may make stripline transport current only on the edges at sufficiently high frequencies .",
    "it follows from ampere law that magnetic field created by the infinite plane with current density flowing uniformly in one direction is : @xmath5 this formula gives the upper limit for magnetic field created by a stripline .",
    "the case of stripline is displayed in fig.[fig:1]a .",
    "we take a magnetic core formed in a closed loop with a gap of length @xmath6 on the circumference to accommodate a sample ( fig.[fig:1]b ) .",
    "we wind a few turns of wire @xmath7 somewhere around the core and let the current @xmath8 flow through the loops . in analyzing the described circuit",
    "it is useful to use the hopkinson law constructed in analogy to ohms law @xcite .",
    "it utilizes the concept of magnetic circuit and states that magnetomotive force @xmath9 is a source of magnetic flux @xmath10 with reluctance @xmath11 being a measure of a `` resistance '' which magnetic circuit represents to the flux : @xmath12 .",
    "reluctance is calculated in analogy to electrical resistance : @xmath13 with @xmath14 being a measure of magnetic flux `` conductivity '' , @xmath15  cross - section of the core , @xmath16  length of the magnetic core along magnetic field lines inside the core , @xmath6  gap length .",
    "the flux lines want to stay mostly in a magnetic medium since the magnetic field energy density is @xmath17 and big @xmath18 guarantees lower energy . the magnetic field in the gap",
    "if @xmath19 guarantees that the magnetic field inside the gap is uniform since magnetic field lines stay within the cross - section a. ] reads : @xmath20 and inductance of the horseshoe magnet is : @xmath21 to get a flavor of the formulas we assume current of @xmath22 and @xmath23 ( if we want to place a silicon chip with a structure in the gap @xmath24 seems to be already a small number ) . as a result we obtain @xmath25 . to calculate inductance",
    "we take a plausible assumption @xmath26 and obtain @xmath27 .     as dimension of",

    "the field is parallel to the surface in the middle of the assembly.,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=45.0% ] ( -200,120 ) * * +      now we move on to the seemingly easiest design : the air - core coil ( fig.[fig:1]c ) .",
    "if such a coil is sufficiently long , formulas for the magnetic field inside the coil and the inductance are known ( the ampere law ) : @xmath28 @xmath29     + basically these are the same formulas that we obtained for the horseshoe magnet but here length of the coil @xmath30 replaces the length of the gap .",
    "we can make air - core coil very small .",
    "if it has length @xmath31 still there is no problem to place a few mm long silicon chip over it .",
    "the cross - section can also be easily reduced to a few @xmath32 , say @xmath33 . with these numbers for @xmath34",
    "we obtain a field of @xmath35 inside the coil and an inductance of @xmath36 .",
    "we notice that it is 2 times smaller inductance than in case of horseshoe magnet and at the same time @xmath37 times bigger field .",
    "but it is inside long coil .",
    "even if a field outside the coil is much smaller than inside the coil still it may be advantageous to use air - core coil instead of horseshoe magnet to create the magnetic field confined to a small volume .",
    "the next section presents numerical calculations of the field outside the coil along with influence of the coil geometry on the delivered field .",
    "the concept we will use is presented in fig.[fig:1]c .",
    "it may seem that a field outside coil is too small to be considered ( in fact for long solenoid it is the field that we neglect when using ampere law to calculate inductance and the field inside coil ) .",
    "nevertheless it is possible to optimize geometrical dimensions of the coil in order to get the maximum magnetic field outside the coil in direction parallel to coil main axis .",
    "such an optimization must be done numerically but before showing it up we go on for a while with qualitative considerations .",
    "+ we have already presented the case of infinite current plane in section  [ subsec : stripline ] together with the formula for the magnetic field above the plane .",
    "it reads : @xmath38 .",
    "now we consider a coil with rectangular cross - section like the one presented in fig.[fig:2]a .",
    "it consists of @xmath39 `` walls '' with current .",
    "if we place sample very close to one of the  walls  and the wall is sufficiently large we start to approach the case of infinite plane .",
    "if we assume that other @xmath40 `` walls '' are far away from the sample we can neglect the field they produce .",
    "suppose we wound the coil with @xmath41 copper wire and drive it with @xmath42 current .",
    "the linear current density is @xmath43 .",
    "it follows that the limiting value for the field produced by the coil is @xmath44 .",
    "we expect to approach this number as we increase dimensions of the coil .",
    "+ we analyze influence of the geometry and size of the coil on the field produced outside the coil in the center @xmath45 above it ( fig.[fig:2]a ) for the coil with fixed length of @xmath46 wound with 1 layer of @xmath41 wire ( 20 turns ) , but with different widths and heights .    to find the field we build a coil out of many segments ( i.e. 2000 segments per turn ) with @xmath47 and @xmath48 specifying ends of a segment and use the biot - savart law in the numerical form : @xmath49 with @xmath50 defining position of a point where we want to find the field @xmath51 with respect to the middle of a segment .",
    "the result of the numerical integration of the biot - savart law over entire coil ( i.e. over i ) is displayed in fig.[fig:2]b .",
    "it shows that increasing size of the coil ( its cross - section ) has only logarithmic effect on the produced field , for bigger sizes the effect is even smaller .",
    "it also shows that flat coils ( with height to width ratio of @xmath52 ) represent the best trade - off between strength of the field and coil dimensions ( which we want to minimize to reduce inductance ) .",
    "when cross - section of the coil is fixed such a geometry is the best compromise between fields produced by upper and lower `` walls '' of the coil which are opposite in direction outside the coil : for flatter coils lower `` parasitic '' wall starts to have more influence on the field , for coils with bigger aspect ratio the area of the upper  wall  becomes smaller producing less field .",
    "the coil obviously can not approach the mentioned limit for the infinite plane since its length is fixed and equal to @xmath46 .",
    "however increasing the length of the coil ( see supplementary material , fig.[fig : s3 ] ) reveals the asymptotic behavior .",

    "one should use thin substrates ( e.g. @xmath63 thick si wafer ) if uniformity of the field is an issue .",
    "we notice that our air - core coil generates higher field than horseshoe magnet ( fig.[fig:1]b ) described in section [ subsec : horseshoe_magnet ] if inductances of the two are made the same by choosing proper number of turns in the horseshoe magnet .",
    "we also observe that obtaining the same field for a @xmath64 wide stripline ( wide enough to create the homogeneous field over a few @xmath65 ) would require application of a @xmath66 times larger biasing current than in the case of air - core coil ( a coil allows to circulate `` the same current '' over many loops ) .",
    "following the way of reasoning presented so far we constructed a minicoil assembly ( fig.[fig:4 ] ) .",
    "we wound coils on matchsticks of rectangular cross - sections of @xmath67 with a few tens of turns .",
