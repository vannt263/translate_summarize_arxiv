    "it is natural to expect that the magnetic field induced by the ferromagnet will strongly affect the thermodynamical , magnetic and transport properties of the considered hybrid systems ( for review see refs . @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "the properties of the ferromagnetic superconductors and the s / f hybrids with rather strong exchange interaction between superconductor and ferromagnet were discussed in the reviews @xcite .",
    "hereafter we will focus only on the flux - coupled s / f hybrids .",
    "it is already well known @xcite that the nonuniform magnetic field can modify the conditions for the appearance of superconductivity due to the effect of a local field compensation .",
    "this leads to an exotic non - monotonous dependence of the superconducting critical temperature @xmath1 on an external magnetic field @xmath2 applied perpendicular to the superconducting film .",
    "depending on the topology of the magnetic field , nucleation of superconductivity in the compensated regions ( near the @xmath9 minima , @xmath10 is the perpendicular component of the total magnetic field ) results in either the field - induced superconductivity , or the domain - wall superconductivity ( dws ) and the reverse - domain superconductivity ( rds ) .",
    "the field - induced superconductivity is inherent for the s / f hybris with the arrays of ferromagnetic dots , @xcite whereas dws and rds are typical for the planar s / f hybrids with domain structure in ferromagnetic layer.@xcite the problem of the formation of the localized superconductivity in the presence of one - dimensional domain structure with out - of - plane magnetization was considered theoretically in refs . @xcite it was demonstrated that superconductivity localized near the magnetic domain walls ( dws ) at @xmath11 can be realized under certain restrictions on the main parameters of the s / f hybrid , @xcite namely : ( i ) the magnetization @xmath12 of the ferromagnet , ( ii ) the width of the domains @xmath13 , as well as ( iii ) the thicknesses of the superconducting and ferromagnetic films @xmath8 and @xmath0 . on the contrary",

    "the main focus of the paper is to investigate experimentally the influence of the thickness @xmath0 of the ferromagnetic film on the electrical resistance of the thin - film planar s / f hybrids , composed of superconducting al film and multilayered [ co / pt]@xmath15 ferromagnetic film .",
    "similar [ co / pt]-based hybrid structures , characterized by out - of - plane magnetic anisotropy , were recently used for the studying of the influence of the inhomogeneous field and the width of the domains on the shape of the phase transition line @xmath3 .",
    "@xcite however now we study the variation of the resistance not only at temperatures close to the superconducting critical temperature @xmath1 , but also at low temperatures when the superconducting order parameter is well developed .",
    "we expect that the thickness of ferromagnet as well as the typical width of the magnetic domain is also of importance for the reentrant superconductivity .",
    "indeed , the spatial distribution of the magnetic field induced by the domain structure depends substantially on the ratio between @xmath0 and @xmath13 : the magnetic field is almost uniform inside the domains at @xmath16 and it is highly inhomogeneous in the opposite limit.@xcite thus , one can anticipate that the thicker ferromagnetic films will have a stronger influence of the superconducting properties of the s / f hybrid .",
    "the advantage of the use of the ferromagnetic [ co / pt]@xmath15 multilayers is that we can precisely control the thickness by choosing the number @xmath17 of the bilayers in the preparation process .",
    "we use thin aluminum films as a superconducting material since aluminum has the maximal coherence length ( or the minimal upper critical field ) among other superconducting materials.@xcite therefore thin al films should be very sensitive to the parameters of the built - in magnetic field in the s / f hybrid .",
    "we expect that the presented comparative study might be useful for further investigations of the domain - wall superconductivity in the s / f hybrids by means of local probe techniques ( e.g. , scanning tunnelling microscopy / spectroscopy ) .",
    "since at low temperatures the scan range of the scanning tunnelling microscope ( stm ) is of the order of @xmath18 m , it is necessary to find the s / f system with persistent small - scale domain structure and rather high amplitude of the magnetic field .",
    "ferromagnetic single crystals bafe@xmath19o@xmath20 and pbfe@xmath19o@xmath20 can be hardly used for this purpose since the magnetic domains are rather large ( from 2 to 30 @xmath18 m ) and they are strongly influenced by the external magnetic field.@xcite on the other hand , parallel magnetic domains in permalloy ( feni ) films have sub - micron width , however they generate too weak stray field in order to induce the localized superconductivity at low temperatures .",
    "@xcite in this sense the multilayered [ co / pt ] structures seem to be the most suitable for the direct visualization of the dws and the only question is what are the optimal composition of such class of the s / f hybrids .",

    "_ in order to investigate the effects of nonuniform magnetic field , induced by bubble magnetic domains , on the magnetoresistance of thin superconducting al films , three planar hybrid samples were fabricated by means of molecular beam epitaxy on sio@xmath21 substrates .",

    "all these templates were covered with a 4 nm thick si layer followed by a superconducting al layer of 20 nm thickness . finally , the capping si layer ( 12 nm ) was evaporated in order to prevent oxidation and mechanical damage of the samples .",
    "it is important to notice that all insulating / superconducting materials were evaporated simultaneously in a single run , therefore the only difference in the sample s composition is the thickness @xmath0 of the ferromagnetic films : @xmath22  nm ( @xmath23 ) , @xmath24  nm ( @xmath25 ) , and @xmath26  nm ( @xmath27 ) . for brevity",
    ", we introduced notations n10 , n15 and n20 in order to refer to the hybrid samples containing the ferromagnetic films with 10 , 15 and 20 bilayers , correspondingly . since the al films were electrically insulated from the ferromagnetic substrate , we expect that the interaction between ferromagnetic and superconducting parts in our samples is purely magnetostatic in origin and the proximity effect is negligible .             dependence measured for the sample n15 at @xmath28  k. depending on the returning field @xmath29 , one can get the remanent magnetization @xmath30 at will ( blue squares).,scaledwidth=35.0% ]    _ magnetization loops @xmath31 vs. @xmath2 .",
    "_ the hysteresis @xmath32 loops of the ferromagnetic multilayered co / pt films of the different thickness were measured using a commercial squid magnetometer in a perpendicular applied field @xmath2 at @xmath33  k and @xmath28  k ( above the critical temperature of superconducting transition @xmath34k ) , see fig .",
    "[ fig - mh - new ] .",
    "such ferromagnetic structures are known to possess well - defined out - of - plane magnetization.@xcite we demonstrated that the increase in the thickness of the ferromagnetic film apparently leads to a lowering of the coercive fields : @xmath35  koe ( n10 ) , @xmath36  koe ( n15 ) , and @xmath37  koe ( n20 ) .",
    "we would like to note that the saturated magnetization @xmath38 ( the total magnetic moment divided by the volume ) at low temperatures is practically independent on the thickness of the ferromagnetic film : @xmath39  emu/@xmath40 , @xmath41  emu/@xmath40 , @xmath42  emu/@xmath40 .",
    "it is easy to see that the increase in temperature substantially reduces the width of the hysteresis loops ( the corresponding coercive fields at @xmath33  k are equal to @xmath43  koe , @xmath44  koe and @xmath45  koe ) and decreases the saturated magnetization @xmath38 .",

    "the magnetic domain structure corresponding to the different remanent states in the co / pt multilayers was investigated by mfm technique at room temperature in the presence of the external magnetic field similar to that reported in ref .",
    "@xcite the mfm measurements were carried out using a commercial autoprobe m5 ( veeco instruments ) scanning probe microscope .",
    "the mfm tip was maintained at a fixed  flying \" height ( 1020 nm ) above the sample in order to exclude the tip influence effects which can modify the magnetic domain structure .",
    "the tip oscillation amplitude was about 20 nm .",
    "with indicated scan heights in the flying mode this equates to an average tip - to - sample distances of 3040 nm .",
    "the standard non - contact mode of scanning probe microscopy with ac cantilever amplitude stabilization was used .",
    "the dc deflection response of the mfm cantilever was used to plot the magnetic interactions between the tip and sample as a function of the tip position .",
    "the magnetic force interaction is related to the vertical component of the spatial derivative of the magnetic field from the sample .",
    "therefore , mfm is sensitive to the strength and polarity of near - surface stray fields produced by ferromagnetic samples .",
    "this allows to obtain information about the overall domain topology from an mfm image .",
    "a variable magnetic field module providing uniform fields up to 4 koe in the direction perpendicular to the sample surface was mounted on the mfm sample stage to study the evolution of the domain structure with varying @xmath2 .",

    "we remove all magnetic domains of the opposite direction with respect to the direction of the external magnetic field , and therefore there is no noticeable mfm contrast in the fig .",

    "the gradual increase of the area covered by the magnetized domains at increasing @xmath53 , what corresponds to the observed monotonous decrease of the magnetization , was confirmed by the performed analysis of the domain coverage .",

    "the resistance was measured in the large - area specimens by a standard four - probe technique . the magnetic field produced by a superconducting magnet ( up to @xmath55 oe )",
    "was used for a magnetization / demagnetization of the sample in - situ before the magnetoresistive measurements .",
    "the range of the @xmath2 sweeping ( from -700 oe to 700 oe ) appears to be considerably smaller than the corresponding coercive fields of the ferromagnetic films at low temperatures ( see section ii ) .",
    "therefore we anticipate that the parameters of the domain structure , prepared by incomplete demagnetization , remains almost unaltered .",
    "we begin with the discussion about the transport properties of the sample n10 with the thinnest ferromagnetic [ co / pt]@xmath56 substrate .        for this sample which was preliminary magnetized in the positive direction we found out that the all level curves of the resistance @xmath57 have the maxima positioned almost at @xmath11 , where @xmath58 is the normal state resistance [ panel ( a ) in fig .",

    "currently we have no reliable interpretation of this asymmetry .",
    "a possible explanation is that the negative magnetic field @xmath62  oe induces the negatively magnetized domains , which disappear at the @xmath2 inversion .",
    "however in our room temperature mfm measurements in the presence of the external magnetic field @xmath63  oe and @xmath64  oe we did not observe any change of the magnetic patterns and an appearance of such magnetic domains of the opposite polarity",
    ". we can attribute this to the restricted scan range and insufficient sensitivity of our mfm microscope .    nevertheless , the other level curves corresponding to low resistance criteria ( @xmath65 and 0.5 ) are almost symmetrical , and they practically coincide .",
    "it means that the conditions for a dropping of the resistance to zero are polarity - independent . indeed ,",
    "even if the isolated magnetic domains of opposite polarity appear reversibly at @xmath60 , they can not ensure a vanishing of the electrical resistance .",
    "it is quite natural to attribute this lines to the upper critical field expression @xmath66 , where the maximal critical temperature @xmath67  k and the upper critical field @xmath68  oe at @xmath51 were found from the optimal fitting .",
    "we would like to mention that the fitting gives us the same parameters @xmath69 and @xmath70 for all three hybrid samples as we demonstrate below .",
    "this can be considered as an evidence of that the al films have identical superconducting characteristics . using the @xmath70 value",
    ", we also estimated of the superconducting coherence length = 93  nm at @xmath51 .    during the procedure of the preparation of the magnetic state",
    ", one can irreversibly create negative magnetic domains by applying the external field @xmath49 of the order of the coercive field @xmath71 , as it follows from the mfm measurements at room temperature .",
    "the reduction of the averaged remanent magnetization results in the substantial suppression of the @xmath1 maximum ( up to 50% ) [ panels ( b ) , ( c ) and ( d ) in fig .",
    "[ fig - summary-20 - 10 ] ] .",
    "the similar depletion of the maximal critical temperature was obtained for the same sample in as - grown state ( not presented in this paper ) . at the same time the all maxima in the level curves @xmath57 are shifted to negative @xmath2 values of the order of 5080 oe depending on the @xmath49 values .",
    "this finding can be explained by a field compensation effect above the domains with positive magnetization which are responsible for a percolation of the supercurrents at the initial stage of the magnetization reversal .",
    "even a tiny change of the returning field essentially modifies the magnetoresistance of the hybrid structure : the maxima at the level curves which were initially positioned at @xmath60 , shift toward @xmath61 and vice versa [ panels ( e)(f ) in fig .",
    "[ fig - summary-20 - 10 ] ] . in other words",
    ", we can not observe the reentrant superconductivity for this sample for any @xmath49 parameter . in comparison with the samples n15 and n20 ( see below ) the displacement of the @xmath1 maximum ( @xmath7280  oe ) is too small .",
    "this indicates that both the amplitude and typical length scales of the built - in magnetic field are not large enough for a localizing of the order parameter in the compensated regions .",
    "more interesting results were obtained for the sample with a 15 bilayer ferromagnetic film ( the case of intermediate thickness of ferromagnetic substrate ) .",
    "one might conclude that an increase in the ferromagnetic film thickness will lead to    \\(i ) an increase of the typical width of the magnetic domains , since the equilibrium period of the domain structure with out - of - plane magnetization is proportional to , ref .",
    "@xcite ;    \\(ii ) an increase of the absolute value of the flux produced by the magnetic domains , since the smaller the @xmath0 value , the faster the decay of the magnetic field in the direction , perpendicular to the film plane , is ;    \\(iii ) a decrease of the width of the magnetization curve , as it was revealed in the section [ section - magneticproperties ] .",
    "the first case ( i ) is difficult to verify in our experiments , since the parameters of the prepared domain structure are much more sensitive to the returning field values rather than to the thickness of the substrate .",
    "as far as the second case ( ii ) is concerned , we analyzed the spatial distribution of the @xmath73component of the magnetic field induced by one - dimensional periodic domain structure , characterized by the period @xmath13 and the magnetization @xmath38 ( fig .",
    "[ fig - field ] ) .",
    "it is obvious that the increase in the thickness of ferromagnet raises the averaged field ( or magnetic flux ) emanating from the domains , since the magnetic field decays slower in the transverse direction as @xmath0 increases ( for a given domain s width ) .",
    "the results of the transport measurements are summarized in fig .",
    "[ fig - summary-20 - 15 ] .",
    "analogous results obtained for the similar hybrid structure al(50  nm)/[co / pt]@xmath74 were partly presented in refs .",
    "@xcite , in the form of a single curve of the constant resistance of the sample .",
    "however here we present complete information concerning the variations of magnetoresistance in full @xmath75 plane .",
    "first of all we would like to note that the maximal critical temperature @xmath67  k of the sample n15 in the fully magnetized state is the same as for the samples n10 and n20 .",
    "in addition , all the level curves of the resistance for the uniformly magnetized sample are coincident straight lines ( for the resistance ratios @xmath76 and 0.3 ) with the almost same slope @xmath77 as for the samples n10 and n20 .",
    "it clearly indicates that there are no differences in the superconducting properties of all hybrid samples .",
    "the formation of isolated negative magnetic domains in the ferromagnetic film which is preliminary magnetized in a positive direction leads to a shift of the main @xmath1 maximum toward negative @xmath2 values and to a suppression of its amplitude [ panel ( b ) in fig .",
    "[ fig - summary-20 - 15 ] ] .",
    "this can be easily explained by a compensation of the local magnetic field above rather wide positive magnetic domains .",
    "such compensation leads to a preferred nucleation of superconductivity there @xcite ( the regime of the reverse - domain superconductivity ) . at the same time the nucleation of superconductivity above negative magnetic domains , which have smaller typical width than positive domains ( see fig .",
    "[ fig - mfm ] ) is energetically unfavorable . as a result",
    ", the @xmath1 maximum at @xmath61 has smaller amplitude . indeed , as we argued in refs .",
    "@xcite , the larger the area @xmath78 where the superconducting wave function is confined , the higher the critical temperature @xmath1 of the appearance of such localized superconducting state is : @xmath79 .",
    "this effect can be interpreted as a quantum size effect for the localized superconducting wave function in non - uniform magnetic field , what is analogous to the standard quantum size effect for single electron wave function in a potential well.@xcite in addition , the maxima on all the level curves are also shifted , pointing out that superconductivity above positive domains is responsible for a percolation for supercurrents at lower temperatures .",
    "a further increase of the @xmath49 value leading to a more pronounced decrease of the size of the positively magnetized domains , causes a suppression of the @xmath1 maximum at @xmath60 [ panel ( c ) in fig .",
    "[ fig - summary-20 - 15 ] ] .",
    "this peak is now shifted to even higher negative fields , since the absolute value of the @xmath73component of the stray field , ( which has to be compensated ) , increases as the typical domain width decreases .",
    "simultaneously , the growth of negatively magnetized domains results in a more favorable order parameter nucleation above negative domains and , accordingly , a second peak in the critical temperature at @xmath61 becomes higher .",
    "thus , two peaks corresponding to the reversed - domain superconductivity both above positive and negative domains are easily seen in the @xmath80 diagram .",
    "taking the positions of these @xmath1 maxima , once can estimate the amplitude of the nonuniform magnetic field , which is of the order of 300  oe . in the vicinity of the coercive field",
    "even small @xmath49 variation can induce a evident change in the relative amplitude of the @xmath1 peaks , which should be attributed to the reshuffling or reshaping of the magnetic domains [ compare panels ( c ) and ( d ) in fig .",
    "[ fig - summary-20 - 15 ] ] .",
    "we would like to note that the level curves for high and low resistance ratio ( e.g. @xmath76 and @xmath81 ) may have completely different shapes .",
    "for instance , the nucleation of superconductivity ( i.e. an initial decrease of the resistance ) can occur both at the positive and negative compensation fields almost at the same temperature , however the sample s resistance goes to zero only at @xmath60 [ panel ( d ) in fig .",
    "[ fig - summary-20 - 15 ] ] .",
    "we interpret this finding as a consequence of the effect of current percolation in a irregular labyrinth - type domain pattern .",
    "interestingly , the shape of the level curve for @xmath82 quite well resembles the non - monotonous dependence @xmath3 with positive curvature at small @xmath2 values , predicted theoretically for the regime of the domain - wall superconductivity.@xcite we would like to interpret our result as a fingerprint of the possible crossover between reverse - domain superconductivity and domain - wall superconductivity at sweeping @xmath2 [ panels ( c)(e ) in fig .",
    "[ fig - summary-20 - 15 ] ] .    for higher @xmath49 values",
    "the first peak , located at negative fields , disappears , whereas the peak at positive fields shifts up in temperature and is displaced to a lower field curve [ panels ( e)(f ) in fig .",
    "[ fig - summary-20 - 15 ] ] .",
    "this second peak will eventually evolve into a linear phase boundary when the ferromagnetic film becomes fully magnetized in the negative direction .",
    "finally , we briefly discuss the superconducting properties of the sample n20 with the thickest ferromagnetic substrate .",
    "the general evolution of the magnetoresistance at varying @xmath49 parameter is quite similar to that for the sample n15 ( compare figs .",
    "[ fig - summary-20 - 15 ] and [ fig - summary-20 - 20 ] ) . for the sample in the demagnetized state ( @xmath83 ) the effect of the stray field of the magnetic domains",
    "is so strong that we can observe only the initial stage of the decrease of the electrical resistance at the compensation fields in very narrow range of available temperatures [ panels ( d ) and ( e ) in fig .",
    "[ fig - summary-20 - 20 ] ] .",
    "this displacement of the @xmath1 maxima to the higher @xmath2 values ( 400500 oe ) as well as the lowering of the critical temperature at @xmath11 are in agreement with our explanation concerning the increase of the averaged magnetic field produced by the magnetic domains in thick ferromagnetic films .",
    "currently we can not explain the observed global suppression of the maximal critical temperature near the compensation fields [ panels ( d ) and ( e ) ] .",
    "for instance , this effect can be caused by considerable shrinkage of the domain width down to the length scales comparable with @xmath84 .",
    "however , typical width of magnetic domains for sample n20 does not differ considerably from that for the sample n15 as it follows from the mfm measurements .",
    "therefore we might expect the essential modification of the remanent distribution of magnetization for thick ferromagnetic film , e.g. an increase in the in - plane component of the magnetic moments .",
    "anyway , the clarification of the origin of the global suppression of superconductivity in the s / f hybrids with thick multilayered ferromagnetic films deserves a separate detailed study .",
    "we investigated experimentally the peculiarities of the electrical transport on large - area superconducting aluminum films deposited on top of multilayered ferromagnetic [ co / pt]@xmath15 structure ( @xmath17 is the number of the bilayers ) .",
    "we demonstrated that : ( i ) by changing the @xmath17 value during the fabrication process and ( ii ) by varying the remanent magnetization of the hybrid sample during the demagnetization procedure , one can control a spatial distribution of the magnetic field , induced by magnetic domains , inside the superconducting film .",
    "we showed that the nonuniform magnetic field generated by magnetic bubble domains strongly modifies the dependence of the electrical resistance of the sample on temperature @xmath4 and the external magnetic field @xmath2 .",
    "we found out that the behavior of the planar s / f hybrids at temperatures close to the critical temperature of the superconducting transition and at low temperatures can be completely different : the nucleation of superconductivity is governed mainly by the typical lateral dimensions of the magnetic domains regardless their shapes , while at low temperatures the general topology of the magnetic pattern becomes very important .",
    "we demonstrated that the increase in the ferromagnetic film thickness leads to the more pronounced reentrant superconductivity , characterized by a decrease of the resistance as @xmath2 increases .",
    "however further increase of the @xmath17 number suppresses the critical temperature of the hybrid sample .",
    "thus for the planar al - based hybrid structures we determined an optimal thickness of the ferromagnetic film ( @xmath25 ) , when the non - monotonous dependence of the superconducting critical temperature on @xmath2 can be observed in rather wide @xmath4 and @xmath2 range .",
    "this finding can be of interest , e.g. , for further experimental investigations of the different regimes of the localized superconductivity in the presence of magnetic templates .",
    "indeed , the observed parabolic dependence @xmath85 , @xmath86 are positive constants ) .",
    "nevertheless the problem concerning the direct visualization of the domain - wall superconductivity in the s / f hybrids is still challenging .",
    "the formation of the localized superconductivity ( both the domain - wall superconductivity and the reverse - domain superconductivity ) can be detected by means of the scanning tunnelling microscopy / spectroscopy ( stm / sts ) . however",
    "a matching between the magnetic pattern and the distribution of the local density of states can be performed in a case of domain structure with unalterable small - scale domain structure .",
    "in addition , rather high amplitude of the magnetic field is necessary to guarantee the localization of the superconducting wave function near the domain walls .",
    "thus , the parameters of the domain structure in the multilayered [ co / pt]@xmath15 films meet these requirements .",

    "<S> we study the influence of the thickness @xmath0 of the plain ferromagnetic ( f ) film on the electrical resistance of the flux - coupled hybrids , consisting of superconducting ( s ) al film and multilayer [ co / pt ] f film with out - of - plain magnetization . </S>",
    "<S> the behavior of such hybrids at high and low temperatures is found to be different : the nucleation of superconductivity at high temperatures is governed mainly by the typical lateral dimensions of the magnetic domains , while low temperature properties are determined by topology of the magnetic template . we show that an increase in the @xmath0 value leads to a broadening of the field- and temperature intervals where non - monotonous dependence of the superconducting critical temperature @xmath1 on the applied magnetic field @xmath2 is observed ( for demagnetized f films ) . </S>",
    "<S> further increase in the @xmath0 value results in a global suppression of superconductivity . </S>",
    "<S> thus , we determined an optimal thickness , when the non - monotonous dependence @xmath3 can be observed in rather broad @xmath4 and @xmath2 range , what can be interesting for further studies of the localized superconductivity in planar al - based s / f hybrids and for development of the devices which can exploit the localized superconductivity . </S>"
