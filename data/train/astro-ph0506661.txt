    "= 17.5 cm    although greatly outnumbered by spiral galaxies , elliptical galaxies contain @xmath15% of the stellar mass in the present - day universe ( fukugita , hogan , & peebles 1998 ) and dominate the high mass end of the galaxy mass function ( e.g. , nakamura et  al . 2003 ) .",
    "their status at the top of the food chain is a strong motivation for their study as it provides insight in the processes governing the build - up of galaxies over cosmic time , the nature of the most luminous galaxies at @xmath16 and beyond , the formation of the first stars , and the origins of supermassive black holes .    despite vigorous research efforts",
    "it is still not known how and when elliptical galaxies were formed . separating the time of the formation of their _ stars _ from the time of their _ assembly _",
    ", a partial answer is that most of the stars in the most massive ellipticals were formed at high redshift .",
    "this result is supported by a large number of studies of nearby and distant galaxies , and applies to ellipticals in the general field as well as those in rich clusters ( e.g. , bower , lucey , & ellis 1992 ; ellis et  al .",
    "1997 ; bernardi et  al .",

    "1998a , 1998b ; treu et  al . 1999 , 2002 ; van dokkum et  al .",
    "2001a ; holden et  al .",
    "even when accounting for possible selection effects due to morphological evolution ( `` progenitor bias '' ; van dokkum & franx 2001 ) , it is very difficult to fit the observed evolution of massive ellipticals with formation redshifts substantially lower than @xmath17 .",
    "although there is general agreement that the mean age is high , there are strong indications that not all stars in all elliptical galaxies formed at high redshift : trager et al .",
    "( 2000 ) and others ( e.g. , yi et  al . 2005 ) find evidence for a `` sprinkling '' of recent star formation in otherwise old ellipticals , and recent studies of the evolution of the fundamental plane relation ( djorgovski & davis 1987 ) find evidence that low mass early - type galaxies have lower luminosity - weighted ages than high mass ones ( treu et al .  2005 ; van der wel et al .",
    "2005 ) .",
    "much less is known about the assembly of elliptical galaxies , that is , when and how the galaxies were `` put together '' . in the literature , a distinction is often made between models in which elliptical galaxies form from the collapse of primordial gas clouds ( `` monolithic collapse '' ; e.g. , eggen , lynden - bell , & sandage 1962 ; jimenez et  al .",
    "1999 ) , or in mergers of smaller galaxies ( `` hierarchically '' ; e.g. toomre & toomre 1972 ; white & frenk 1991 ) . within the framework of a merger model the question of assembly can be specified as , first , the typical age of the last major merger ; and second , the nature of the progenitor galaxies . in many individual cases",
    "we can readily answer both questions : abundant evidence leaves little doubt that some ellipticals formed recently through the merger of spiral galaxies , or will do so in the near future ( e.g. , toomre & toomre 1972 ; schweizer 1982 ; hibbard & van gorkom 1996 ) . however , it is not clear whether such mergers are exceptional or responsible for the formation of the majority of ellipticals .    among the observational arguments _ for _ recent mergers are the detection of `` fine - structure '' ( e.g. , shells and ripples ) in a large number of nearby ellipticals ( malin & carter 1983 ; schweizer et al .",
    "1990 ) ; the presence of kinematically - decoupled cores ( franx & illingworth 1988 ; bender 1988 ) ; small - scale dust seen in the majority of ellipticals ( e.g. , van dokkum & franx 1995 ) ; ( some ) studies of the redshift evolution of galaxy morphologies , and of close pairs ( e.g. , le f ` evre et  al . 2000 ; patton et  al . 2002 ; conselice et  al .",
    "2003 ) ; and strong evolution of the mass density of red galaxies to @xmath18 , inferred from the combo-17 survey ( bell et  al .",
    "furthermore , and perhaps most importantly , the hierarchical assembly of galaxies is a central aspect of current models for galaxy formation in @xmath19cdm cosmologies ( e.g. , kauffmann , white , & guiderdoni 1993 ; cole et  al .",
    "2000 ; meza et  al .",
    "2003 ) .    among arguments",
    "_ against _ the merger hypothesis are the low probability of mergers in virialized clusters , which are dominated by ellipticals ( ostriker 1980 ; makino & hut 1997 ) ; the fact that the central densities of ellipticals are too high to be the result of dissipationless mergers of pure disks ( carlberg 1986 ; hernquist 1992 ) ; the low scatter in the color - magnitude relation and fundamental plane , which is inconsistent with the diversity in stellar populations expected from spiral galaxy mergers ( e.g. , bower , kodama , & terlevich 1998 , peebles 2002 ) ; the much higher specific frequency of globular clusters for ellipticals than for spirals ( although some globulars may be formed during mergers ; e.g. , schweizer et  al .",
    "1996 ) ; the observation that known remnants of spiral galaxy mergers have underluminous x - ray halos ( sansom , hibbard , & schweizer 2000 ) ; the existence of the @xmath20 relation ( gebhardt et  al .",
    "2000 ; ferrarese & merritt 2000 ) ; and the presence of massive galaxies at high redshift ( e.g. , franx et  al .",
    "2003 ; daddi et  al .",
    "2004 ; glazebrook et  al .",
    "2004 )    these apparently contradictory lines of evidence may be largely reconciled by postulating that most elliptical galaxies formed through ( nearly ) dissipationless ( or `` dry '' ) mergers of red , bulge - dominated galaxies rather than mergers of spiral disks .",
    "motivated by the comparatively red colors of ellipticals exhibiting fine - structure schweizer & seitzer ( 1992 ) discuss this possibility , but argue that mergers between early - type galaxies are statistically unlikely as the `` median '' field galaxy is an sb spiral ( see also silva & bothun 1998 ) . however",
    ", most mergers likely occur in groups , where the early - type galaxy fraction is much higher than in the general field ( e.g. , zabludoff & mulchaey 1998 ) . furthermore",
    ", semianalyical models of galaxy formation have predicted that the most recent mergers of bright ellipticals were between gas - poor , bulge - dominated galaxies ( kauffmann & haehnelt 2000 ; khochfar & burkert 2003 ) , and several studies have shown that such merging is consistent with the observed fundamental plane relation ( e.g. , gonz ' alez - garca & van albada 2003 ; boylan - kolchin , ma , & quataert 2005 ) .",
    "finally , mergers between red galaxies may be common in young , unvirialized galaxy clusters at @xmath18 ( van dokkum et  al .",
    "1999 , 2001b , tran et al .",
    "2005 ) .",
    "although some early - type / early - type mergers are known to exist in the local universe ( e.g. , davoust & prugniel 1988 ; combes et  al .",
    "1995 ) , little is known about their frequency . here",
    "we investigate the relevance of dry merging by analyzing the frequency and nature of tidal distortions associated with a well - defined sample of bright red galaxies .",
    "this study was motivated by the results of kauffmann & haehnelt ( 2000 ) , khochfar & burkert ( 2003 ) , and bell et  al .",
    "( 2004 ) , the observations of red mergers in @xmath21 clusters , and the advent of very deep photometric surveys over wide areas .",
    "we assume @xmath22 , @xmath23 , and @xmath24mpc@xmath10 ( spergel et al .  2003 ) .",
    "mergers between gas - poor , bulge - dominated galaxies are generally more difficult to recognize than mergers between gas - rich disks .",
    "elliptical - elliptical mergers do not develop prominent tidal tails dotted with star forming regions , but are instead characterized by the ejection of broad `` fans '' of stars , and in certain cases an asymmetric deformation of the inner isophotes ( e.g. , rix & white 1989 ; balcells & quinn 1990 ; combes et  al .",
    "tails may develop if one of the progenitors rotates or has a disk component ( combes et  al .",
    "1995 ) , but as there is no cold , young component these are expected to be more diffuse than those seen in encounters between late - type galaxies .",
    "these effects are illustrated in fig .",
    "[ sim.plot ] , which shows the evolution of an off - axis collision between two hot stellar systems .",
    "the simulation was performed with an implementation of the barnes & hut ( 1986 ) hierarchical tree code , using 65,536 particles .",
    "the galaxies have a 3:1 mass ratio and are represented by plummer models .",
    "the simulation illustrates the rapid merging of the two bodies , the lack of tidal tails , and the development of a large fan of material .",
    "the central parts of the merger remnant quickly settle in a new equilibrium configuration , whereas the material in the outer parts  where dynamical timescales are long  gradually becomes more diffuse .",
    "for a more general analysis of the development of elliptical - elliptical mergers , including the effects of rotation and different mass ratios , we refer to combes et  al .",
    "( 1995 ) and subsequent papers .",
    "the surface brightness of tidal features associated with this type of mergers is comparatively low : the features consist of old , red stellar populations , and have higher @xmath25 ratios than the blue tails associated with mergers of late - type galaxies .",
    "furthermore , they are typically more diffuse , due to the lack of a cold disk in the progenitors .",
    "after the merger , the evidence of the past encounter becomes increasingly difficult to detect as dynamical evolution reduces the surface brightness further ( e.g. , mihos 1995 ) .",
    "no detailed simulations have been done of the expected surface brightness evolution of tidal features resulting from early - type mergers , but a very rough estimate can be obtained from the simulation shown in fig.[sim.plot ] . calibrating the output such that the average surface brightness within the effective radius of the remnant @xmath26magarcsec@xmath27 ( jrgensen , franx , & kjrgaard 1995 ) , we find that the `` fan '' of material to the upper left has @xmath28 at @xmath29 , i.e. , immediately after the merger .",
    "the following timesteps show a continued rapid decrease of the brightness , reaching @xmath30 at @xmath31 , the final time step of the simulation .",
    "it is difficult to reach such low surface brightness levels observationally : extreme enhancements of photographic plates enabled malin & carter ( 1983 ) to detect features to @xmath32 , similar to the limits reached by schweizer & seitzer ( 1992 ) with their deep ccd exposures on the kitt peak 0.9 m telescope .",
    "detecting features with surface brightness @xmath33 requires several hours of integration time on 4 m class telescopes , and to image a sizeable sample of nearby galaxies would require hundreds of hours .",
    "furthermore , flat fielding would have to be accurate to @xmath34% over the entire @xmath35 field .",
    "these practical difficulties can be solved by exploiting the fact that the @xmath36 cosmological surface brightness dimming is a very slow function of redshift for @xmath37 . whereas moving a galaxy from @xmath38 to @xmath39 reduces its total brightness by 5 magnitudes , its surface brightness changes by only 0.35 mag . in practice",
    "it is easier to detect very faint surface brightness features around a galaxy at @xmath39 than at @xmath38 as it occupies a @xmath40 smaller area of the detector .",
    "furthermore , and most importantly , a study of tidal features at @xmath41 does not require a dedicated survey but can be done with existing imaging data .",
    "we use data from two deep extra - galactic surveys : the multiwavelength survey by yale - chile ( musyc ; gawiser et al .  2005 ) , and the noao deep wide - field survey ( ndwfs ; januzzi & dey 1999 , januzzi et al .  2005 ,",
    "dey et al .  2005 ) .",
    "the data products from the optical imaging components of the two survey are quite similar , as they both use the @xmath42 pixel mosaic cameras on the noao 4 m telescopes .",
    "the full dataset covers 10.5 square degrees of sky , reaching @xmath43 surface brightness levels of @xmath44 .",
    "musyc is a deep optical / near - infrared imaging and spectroscopic survey of two southern and two equatorial @xmath45 fields , chosen for their low background and the availability of data at other wavelengths .",
    "the fields are the extended chandra deep field south ( e - cdfs ) , the extended hubble deep field south ( e - hdfs ) , the field centered on the @xmath46 sloan digital sky survey quasar sdss1030 + 05 ( becker et  al . 2001 ) , and the blank low background field cw1255 + 01 . the primary goal of the survey is the study of normal and active galaxies at @xmath47 .",
    "the survey design and data analysis procedures are described in gawiser et al .",
    "briefly , the optical imaging data consist of deep @xmath48 exposures obtained with mosaic - i on the mayall 4 m telescope on kitt peak and mosaic - ii on the blanco 4 m telescope on cerro tololo .",
    "the images have a scale of @xmath49pix@xmath10 , and typical seeing of @xmath50 .",
    "the data reach depths of @xmath51 in @xmath52 , @xmath53 in @xmath54 , @xmath55 , and @xmath4 , @xmath56 in @xmath57 , and @xmath58 in @xmath59 ( ab magnitudes , @xmath60 point source detections ) , with some variation between the fields . the full exposure time is typically realized over an area of @xmath61 , and the total optical survey area is @xmath62deg@xmath0 .    for detection of low surface brightness",

    "the total effective integration time of these frames is typically @xmath63 hours .",
    "the final depth reaches magnitude @xmath64 ( ab ; @xmath60 point source detection ) , with slight variations from field to field .",
    "the ndwfs is a public optical and near - infrared imaging survey over two 9.3deg@xmath0 fields : a @xmath65 field in botes , centered at 14@xmath6632@xmath67 , @xmath68 , and a @xmath69 field in cetus , centered at @xmath7010@xmath67 , @xmath71 ( see januzzi & dey 1999 ; januzzi et al .",
    "the primary goal of the survey is to study large scale structure at @xmath72 .",

    "this release comprises the entire @xmath73deg@xmath0 botes field .",
    "compared to musyc , the ndwfs sacrifices multi - band coverage for area .",
    "only three optical filters are used : @xmath74 , @xmath4 , and @xmath57 . the @xmath74 filter was designed specifically for the ndwfs : it is a very broad blue filter , effectively a combination of the standard @xmath52 and @xmath54 filters .",
    "exposure times vary across the field ; the median values are 8400s in @xmath74 , 6000s in @xmath4 , and @xmath75s in @xmath57 .",
    "details of dr3 can be found on the ndwfs webpages .",
    "the data were not pasted together in a mosaic by noao but released as 27 partially overlapping @xmath76 mosaic pointings .",
    "we obtained all 27 pointings in @xmath74 , @xmath4 , and @xmath57 from the noao archive . in order to increase the signal - to - noise ( s / n ) ratio we created co - added `` bri '' images , in the following way .",
    "first , all images were normalized such that 1 count corresponds to ab@xmath77mag .",
    "next , the summed bri images were created from the @xmath54 , @xmath4 , and @xmath57 frames according to bri@xmath78 .",
    "this procedure optimizes the s / n ratio for objects with the approximate sed of nearby elliptical galaxies .",
    "the detection of diffuse tidal features depends on the limiting surface brightness level of the data , not on the point source detection limit . to assess the ( ab ) surface brightness limits we placed random apertures with an area of @xmath79 in empty regions , and determined the rms fluctuations .",
    "the co - added images were used , i.e. , the `` bvr '' images for musyc and the `` bri '' images for ndwfs .",
    "the musyc images have a typical @xmath43 surface brightness limit of @xmath80  whereas this limit is @xmath81  for the ndwfs images .",
    "these numbers are approximate : the exact limit depends on the field , the local flat fielding accuracy , and on the assumed spectral energy distribution of the source .",
    "the greater depth of musyc was expected , as more exposure time was devoted to the efficient @xmath54 , @xmath55 and @xmath4 filters .",
    "the ability to detect low surface brightness emission is influenced by the extent of the features , confusion with neighboring objects , the contrast with the smooth emission from the galaxy , and other effects ; in practice , we find we can confidently identify features down to @xmath82 .",
    "the initial sample selection is based on color and magnitude only .",
    "no morphological criteria are applied , for three reasons : first , a simple color cut is straightforward to reproduce ; second , as the galaxies are typically at @xmath41 it can be difficult to determine morphologies from ground - based data ( see  [ class.sec ] ) ; and third , the classification process itself might bias the sample toward or against galaxies with tidal features .",
    "the combination of the two surveys comprises 31 multi - band tiles , each covering @xmath83deg@xmath84 .",
    "catalogs were created using the sextractor software ( bertin & arnouts 1996 ) .",
    "sextractor catalogs were available for both surveys but these are optimized for faint point sources , not for large , nearby galaxies .",
    "sextractor was run with its default settings , with the following changes .",
    "the detection threshold was set at @xmath85 , with the added requirement that 10 adjacent pixels are above the threshold , and the mesh size for background subtraction was set at 400 pixels rather than the default 64 to avoid oversubtraction of the background for large galaxies .",
    "matched photometry in each band was obtained by running sextractor in dual image mode , always using the @xmath4-band images for detection .",
    "sextractor s auto magnitudes are used as best estimates for total magnitudes .",
    "colors were initially determined in fixed @xmath86 diameter apertures .",
    "however , we find that colors measured in fixed apertures are not well suited for these large objects as they introduce distance - dependent selection biases . specifically , when selecting on aperture color the sample invariably contains large , presumably very nearby spiral galaxies with blue disks and red bulges . in the following ,",
    "@xmath6 colors refer to @xmath87 , measured in dual image mode .",
    "finally , the measured @xmath88 colors in the ndwfs are converted to the standard johnson system .",
    "the @xmath74 filter was created for the ndwfs and has a bluer central wavelength than the @xmath54 filter . using templates from coleman , wu , & weedman ( 1980 ) we derive @xmath89 this transformation holds to a few percent for @xmath90 and redshifts @xmath91 , and",

    "total magnitudes and colors are given on the vega system to facilitate comparisons to previous studies .",

    "figure [ sel.plot ] shows color - magnitude diagrams for the four musyc fields ( left ) and for the 27 ndwfs fields ( right ) . only objects with a star / galaxy classification @xmath92 are shown ( see bertin & arnouts 1996 ) .",
    "this classification is fairly robust at the magnitudes of interest , and effectively removes both non - saturated and saturated stars from the sample .",
    "visual inspection revealed that the software assigned a star / galaxy classification @xmath93 to four galaxies in our sample ; for these objects the value was manually set to zero .",
    "we note that the cores of some bright galaxies can be saturated , which influences the magnitudes and ( particularly ) the colors in unpredictable ways .",
    "as this effect is difficult to quantify and only influences a handful of objects we did not attempt a correction .",
    "the distribution of points is similar in the two surveys .",
    "the number of objects in the ndwfs is an order of magnitude larger than in musyc , as expected from the difference in area .",

    "the galaxies in the dashed region are the brightest and reddest in @xmath103 square degrees of sky .",
    "after visual inspection of the initial sample of 155 red objects 32 were removed for various reasons .",
    "the discarded objects fall in a wide range of categories : mis - classified stars ( usually blends with other stars or galaxies ) ; objects on the edge of a field ; spurious objects ( always near very bright stars ) ; severely saturated galaxies ( although interesting in their own right , as they are likely very bright active nuclei ) ; and galaxies that have more than one catalog listing .",
    "the latter occurs because the 27 ndwfs tiles have some overlap ; in these cases the data from the overlapping pointings were added , unless the s / n is much higher in one of the two .",
    "we also removed 12 galaxies that are likely members of known galaxy clusters .",
    "eight are located within @xmath104 of nscj142841 + 323859 , a cluster at @xmath105 , and four are located within @xmath106 of the poorer , more compact cluster nscj142701 + 341214 at @xmath107 ( gal et  al .",

    "although both studies find sharp distortions in the form of ripples and shells in a large fraction of ellipticals , their depth and field - of - view are not sufficient to find the large low surface brightness features that we report here .",
    "the exposure time that went into each of the images discussed here is @xmath153s on 4 m class telescopes equipped with modern ccds ( equivalent to 120 hours on a 1 m class telescope ) , and to our knowledge such long exposures have never been obtained of a significant sample of nearby red galaxies .",

    "there is also indirect evidence that the progenitors of the remnants were typically major mergers rather than low mass accretion events .",

    "this difference is consistent with the idea that the events responsible for the tidal features were usually sufficiently strong to disturb any dominant disk component .",
    "finally , the fact that the features are typically broad and red suggests that the progenitors were dynamically hot systems with old stellar populations , consistent with the properties of the galaxies in the ongoing mergers .",
    "we also note that the fraction of light associated with the features ( @xmath161% ) is very similar to the fraction of light associated with the tidal debris in the 1:3 merger simulation shown in fig .  1 .",

    "we infer that the cumulative effects of dry mergers may be the dominant cause of the constant luminosity density of luminous red sequence galaxies in the combo-17 survey .",
    "there are several caveats : both the datapoints in fig .",
    "[ jevo.plot ] and the @xmath39 mass accretion rate have substantial errors , leading to a wide range of allowed models ; although the most recent generation of mergers appears to be ( nearly ) dissipationless , this may no longer hold at @xmath220 ; and the fact that disk - dominated red galaxies probably evolve differently from bulge - dominated ones is ignored .",
    "the lack of evolution in the luminosity density of bright red galaxies , if confirmed , is probably due to a combination of effects with dry merging a significant , but not the only , contributor ( see also mcintosh et al .",
    "from an analysis of tidal features associated with bright red galaxies we find that @xmath221% of bulge - dominated galaxies experienced a merger with median mass ratio 1:4 in the recent past .",
    "expressed in other ways , @xmath7% of bulge - dominated galaxies experienced a major merger involving @xmath222% of its final mass , and the current mass accretion rate of galaxies on the red sequence @xmath223gyr@xmath10 . assuming a constant or increasing mass accretion rate with redshift it is inferred that the stellar mass density in luminous red galaxies has increased by a factor of @xmath11 over the redshift range @xmath12 .",
    "neither of the two standard paradigms for elliptical galaxy formation appears to be consistent with our results : `` monolithic '' assembly at high redshift or late assembly via mergers of gas - rich disk galaxies . instead , elliptical galaxies appear to have been assembled in mergers of bulge - dominated , red galaxies . this `` dry '' form of merging is qualitatively consistent with the high central densities of ellipticals ( gao et al .",
    "2004 ) , their red colors and uniform properties , the existence of the @xmath20 relation ( wyithe & loeb 2005 ) , and their specific frequency of globular clusters .",
    "it remains to be seen whether widespread dry mergers are consistent with the slope and scatter of the color - magnitude relation ( see , e.g. , bower et al .",
    "1998 , ciotti & van albada 2001 ) .",
    "the median merger in our sample makes the brightest galaxy more luminous by @xmath140% and bluer by only @xmath224 mag in @xmath6 , and its remnant will lie within @xmath225 mag of the color - magnitude relation .",
    "however , it is doubtful whether multiple generations of such mergers can be accommodated , unless there is a strong correlation between the masses of the progenitors ( see peebles 2002 )",
    ". it will also be interesting to see whether the evolution is consistent with the number density of massive galaxies at high redshift .",
    "again , the _ observed _ mergers only have a @xmath185% effect on the mass function of red galaxies , and the extrapolation to higher redshifts is obviously still very uncertain .",
    "furthermore , the evolution of the mass function of all galaxies may be different from that of the subset of galaxies on the red sequence .",
    "the high merger rate confirms predictions from hierarchical galaxy formation models in a @xmath19cdm universe ( e.g. , kauffmann et  al .",
    "1993 ; kauffmann 1996 ; cole et  al .",
    "2000 ; somerville , primack , & faber 2001 ; murali et  al .",
    "furthermore , semi - analytical models have predicted that gas - poor mergers between bulge - dominated systems , rather than mergers of disk systems , are responsible for the formation of the most massive ellipticals ( kauffmann & haehnelt 2000 ; and , in particular , khochfar & burkert 2003 ) .",
    "quantitative comparisons of mass growth are difficult as current models do not naturally produce red field galaxies without star formation : the colors of field ellipticals in the simulations are too blue and their @xmath25 ratios too low ( e.g. , kauffmann 1996 ; van dokkum et  al .",
    "additional mechanisms , such as heating by active nuclei , appear to be required to halt gas cooling and star formation in massive galaxies ( e.g. , binney 2004 , somerville 2004 , dekel & birnboim 2005 , keres et al .",
    "our results imply that revised models which address these issues should not only reproduce the `` red and dead '' nature of ellipticals today but also of their immediate progenitors  which may occur naturally if the progenitors have masses greater than some critical mass ( see cooray & milosavljevi 2005 ) .",
    "the main uncertainty in the observed merger fraction is the possibility that the northern ndwfs field , which contains over 90% of the sample , is special in its frequency of tidally disturbed objects .",
    "this seems unlikely given its area of @xmath226mpc@xmath0 at @xmath39 , but the issue of field - to - field variations in the merger fraction will only be settled conclusively when independent fields of similar size are studied in the same way . the main uncertainty in the merger _ rate _ and",
    "mass accretion rate is the timescale of the mergers . although our estimates broadly agree with other studies ( see , e.g. , lin et al .",
    "2004 , and references therein ) , this may simply reflect the fact that similar assumptions lead to similar results .",
    "modeling of red , gas - poor mergers has not been done in a systematic way using modern techniques , and it will be interesting to see what the timescales are for the initial coalescence and the subsequent surface brightness evolution of tidal debris .",
    "specifically , modeling of the 19 merging systems and 44 remnants presented here would provide much better constraints on the merger rate and mass accretion rate , particularly when more complete redshift information is available .",
    "more detailed observational studies of the mergers and their remnants may help answer the question _ why _ the mergers are red , i.e. , what made the progenitors lose their gas ? if active nuclei prevent the cooling of gas above some critical mass at early times they may play the same role during mergers , and it will be interesting to compare the degree of nuclear activity in undisturbed galaxies , ongoing mergers , and remnants . also , sensitive diagnostics of young populations ( e.g. , h@xmath227 line strengths and ultra - violet photometry ) can provide better constraints on the star formation histories of the mergers and remnants .",
    "finally , studies with higher spatial resolution can provide information on the detailed isophotal shapes ( boxy or disky ) of the remnants and their progenitors , and on possible correlations between large scale smooth distortions and the sharp ripples and shells that have been reported in @xmath228 ellipticals ( see hernquist & spergel 1995 ) .",
    "our study focuses on events that we can see today , and it will be very interesting to push the analysis to higher redshifts . although the most recent generation of mergers could be largely `` dry '' , previous generations likely involved blue galaxies and/or were accompanied by strong star formation ( see , e.g. , sanders et  al .",
    "unfortunately it will be difficult to identify the broad red tidal features that we see here at significantly higher redshift due to the @xmath36 cosmological surface brightness dimming .",
    "the limiting depth of the musyc and ndwfs images is @xmath229(@xmath43 , ab ) .",
    "an equivalent survey at @xmath230 should cover an area of @xmath231 square degree and reach levels of @xmath232at @xmath209 and @xmath233at @xmath234 .",
    "even when ( unfavorable ) @xmath235-corrections are ignored these requirements are well beyond the capabilities of current ground- or space - based telescopes .",
    "a more viable technique is to focus on the fraction of red galaxies in pairs .",
    "although pair statistics require large corrections due to the short timescale of the mergers , pairs are easily detectable out to high redshift with the hubble space telescope ( see van dokkum et  al . 1999 ) . based on the work presented here the merger fraction among galaxies on the red sequence should be @xmath236 for separations",
