    "the phenomenon of detonation was discovered in the late ninetheenth century as a supersonic combustion wave that propagates around a thousand times faster than an ordinary flame .",
    "the precise nature of detonation was elucidated in the works of mikhelson , chapman and jouguet at the turn of the twentieth century and of zeldovich , von neumann and dring in the 1940 s ( znd theory , @xcite ) .",
    "it was established that a detonation is a shock wave that compresses and heats the reactive gas to temperatures sufficiently high to ignite chemical reactions within a short distance from the shock .",
    "gas expansion caused by the heat release in these reactions creates pressure waves that , on the one hand , support the propagation of the shock and , on the other , accelerate the flow relative to the shock .",
    "a self - sustained detonation is possible if such flow acceleration is sufficient to make the flow reach sonic conditions relative to the shock .",
    "the presence of a sonic state at some distance from the shock isolates the flow between the shock and the sonic point from the influence of the conditions downstream of the sonic locus , thus making the wave self sustained .",
    "most actual detonations are self sustained and therefore represent an important class of detonations .    in znd theory , a detonation is assumed to be one - dimensional and in a steady - state in a galilean frame moving with the wave .",
    "the theory is successful in explaining the fundamental nature of a detonation as a coupled shock - reaction zone system .",
    "however , in experiments with gaseous detonations , it was observed as early as 1926 that detonations tend to be unsteady and multi - dimensional with rather complex structures and dynamics @xcite .",
    "to explain these dynamics , theoretical efforts focused on analysis of the stability of znd solutions began in the 1960 s in the works of zaidel , pukhnachev , schelkin and , most comprehensively , erpenbeck ( see @xcite for an early literature review ) .",
    "the theory of linear stability of gaseous detonations was found to be rather involved especially with regard to specific numerical computations for real gaseous mixtures .",
    "much later , lee and stewart @xcite revisited the stability problem and solved it for an idealized system by employing a relatively straightforward normal - mode approach .",
    "solving the linear stability problem for real complex gaseous mixtures or for systems with losses remains an open problem .",
    "linear stability theory is successful in predicting , for idealized systems , why and how znd detonations are unstable to linear perturbations .",
    "it is able to predict the neutral stability boundary and the most unstable modes and thus the characteristic length scales of various multi - dimensional structures seen in experiments .",
    "however , the predictive power of linear stability theory is limited by its very nature as a linear theory .",
    "gaseous detonations are known to be highly nonlinear and unsteady .",
    "the lead shock of such a detonation wave propagates with strong oscillations in its velocity and with a highly non - uniform flow behind the shock that involves additional shocks propagating transversely to the lead shock with triple points forming at their intersection .",
    "the triple points in complex detonation waves propagating in tubes with walls covered with soot leave fish - scale traces called detonation cells @xcite , and these detonations are termed cellular .",
    "theoretical prediction of the origin and structure of cellular detonations remains an outstanding and challenging open problem .",
    "however , some progress has been achieved with use of the tools of asymptotic analysis that allow for insight into the nature of the problem under various limiting conditions .",
    "for example , large activation energy @xcite , small heat - release @xcite , slow time evolution and small shock curvature @xcite , weak nonlinearity @xcite , strong overdrive @xcite and other limiting assumptions lead to relatively simple asymptotic models .",
    "these asymptotic theories in general describe idealized systems and are thus also limited in their predictive power .",
    "nevertheless , they provide important information about the mechanisms involved in the existence of particular qualitative traits in the real phenomenon .",
    "two fundamental structural and dynamical properties of gaseous detonations are first that they propagate in a galloping regime in narrow tubes , as characterized by large amplitude pulsations in an essentially one - dimensional wave , and second that the structure of detonation fronts in large channels / tubes or open environments is cellular . from a theoretical point of view",
    ", the basic problem is to describe and explain , at least at a qualitative level , the origin and dynamics of these galloping and cellular detonations .",
    "importantly , such detonations have been reproduced and extensively studied in numerical simulations of the reactive * * navier - stokes / euler equations with simpified descriptions of the chemical reactions and equations of state @xcite .",
    "thus , from a modeling standpoint , the use of these equations is frequently appropriate .",
    "some features of pulsating and cellular detonations have been reproduced theoretically in @xcite .",
    "however , the following questions remain : 1 ) can an asymptotic theory predict the observed period - doubling sequence of bifurcations in one - dimensional detonations and the self - sustained cellular structures in two - dimensional detonations ?",
    "2 ) how quantitatively close are the asymptotic predictions to the numerical results from the reactive navier - stokes / euler equations ?",
    "our aim here is to develop a theory that captures the linear and nonlinear dynamics of self sustained detonations , especially with regard to the bifurcation sequence seen in numerical simulations of one - dimensional detonations and the cellular structures found in two - dimensional detonations .",
    "our theory is asymptotic and relies on a number of approximations , namely small heat release , large activation energy , slow time evolution , weak curvature and the newtonian limit ( @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is the ratio of specific heats ) .",
    "we build on the theory developed in @xcite by employing , as an additional approximation , the newtonian limit ( also used in @xcite in one spatial dimension for euler equations ) for two - dimensional detonations with retained dissipative effects .",
    "the resulting system is a coupled set of three nonlinear partial differential equations .",
    "when the dissipative terms are neglected , it is a hyperbolic system for which we compute the traveling wave solutions analogous to znd waves , their multi - dimensional linear stability properties and full nonlinear dynamics .",
    "we provide a quantitative comparison with the results from the reactive euler equations for all three asymptotic predictions : the steady - state solutions , the linear stability spectrum and the cellular structure .",
    "the analysis of the reduced system with retained dissipative effects is postponed for future work .    as we show in section [ sec : weakly - nonlinear - approximation ] , the two - dimensional reactive navier - stokes equations reduce to a forced version of the unsteady , small disturbance , transonic equations ( utsd ) given by @xmath2 where @xmath3 and @xmath4 represent leading - order corrections to the @xmath5 velocity , @xmath6 velocity and reaction progress variable .",
    "the right - hand side of ( [ eq : asymptotic - model - lambda-1 ] ) is the leading - order contribution of the reaction rate assumed for simplicity to follow a single step arrhenius kinetics .",
    "the parameters @xmath7 and @xmath8 are the rescaled viscosity , pre - exponential factor , activation energy and heat release , respectively .",
    "we find that this reduced asymptotic model captures , at both the qualitative and quantitative levels , not only the znd structure , but also the linear stability spectrum , the pulsating non - linear dynamics of one - dimensional detonations and the cellular dynamics of two - dimensional detonations .",
    "we also mention the attempts at understanding the nonlinear dynamics of detonations via the use of qualitative models such as those introduced by fickett @xcite and majda @xcite .",
    "the idea behind these models is to produce simplified systems that , although not derived from first principles , are capable of reproducing the observed complexity of the solutions of reactive euler equations while considerably simplifying the analysis .",
    "the qualitative models of fickett and majda are closely related to the weakly nonlinear theory of detonations developed in @xcite .",
    "although these models and the asymptotic theory of rosales and majda have enjoyed some success in explaining certain features of different types of traveling wave solutions of reactive euler / navier - stokes equations ( i.e. , weak and strong detonations ) , they were shown to lack the necessary complexity needed to reproduce the dynamical properties of real detonations with the rate functions used in prior work @xcite . however , simple _ ad hoc _ modifications of these models can reproduce much of the complexity of one - dimensional detonations as shown in recent work @xcite and also explained in the present work .",
    "the remainder of this paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "[ sec : governing - equations - of - reactive - flow ] , we state the main governing equations together with the modeling assumptions regarding the medium and the chemical reactions . in section [ sec : weakly - nonlinear - approximation ] , we develop an asymptotic approximation of the governing equations and obtain the weakly nonlinear reduced system .",
    "we then investigate in section [ sec : traveling - wave - solutions - and - stability ] the possible traveling wave solutions of the asymptotic equations and their linear stability properties .",
    "both the traveling wave solutions and stability spectrum of the asymptotic model are compared with their corresponding results in the reactive euler system .",
    "for the case with no dissipative effects , predictions of the asymptotic model are calculated numerically in section [ sec : nonlinear - dynamics ] , and a quantitative comparison with the predictions of the reactive euler equations is presented as well . finally , in section",
    "[ sec : discussion - and - conclusions ] , we discuss the results as well as point out some remaining open problems .",
    "we assume that the medium is described by the following system of equations expressing , respectively , the laws of conservation of mass , momentum and energy , and the chemical heat release : @xmath9 here , @xmath10 is the material derivative , @xmath11 is the specific volume , @xmath12 is the density , @xmath13 is the velocity , @xmath14 is the cauchy stress tensor , @xmath15 is the deformation tensor , @xmath16 is the double contraction of tensors , @xmath17 is the total internal energy per unit mass , @xmath18 is the heat release per unit mass , @xmath19 and @xmath20 represent the flux of energy and species , respectively , @xmath21 is the rate of reaction and @xmath22 is the reaction - progress variable that changes from @xmath23 in the fresh mixture to @xmath24 in the fully burnt products .",
    "we make the following standard modeling assumptions ( e.g. , @xcite ) :    1 .",
    "the fluid is newtonian , with the stokes assumption on the bulk viscosity , so that + @xmath25 , where @xmath26 is the dynamic viscosity , @xmath27 is the pressure and @xmath28 is the identity tensor .",
    "the species flux is given by fick s law , @xmath29 , with @xmath30 denoting the diffusion coefficient .",
    "the energy flux has contributions from both the heat conduction ( given by fourier s law ) and the species diffusion , so that @xmath31 , where @xmath32 is the heat diffusion coefficient .",
    "the medium is a perfect gas described by the ideal - gas equation of state , @xmath33 , with the internal energy given by @xmath34 , where @xmath35 is the universal gas constant divided by the molecular weight and @xmath1 is the ratio of specific heats , assumed to be constant .",
    "5 .   for simplicity , we take the rate of reaction to be @xmath36 , with the added ignition temperature assumption that @xmath37 for @xmath38 for some temperature , @xmath39 . here , @xmath40 is the rate constant and @xmath41 is the activation energy .",
    "more general rate functions can be considered , in principle , as long as appropriate sensitivity to temperature is preserved .    with these assumptions ,",
    "we can then rewrite ( [ eq : continuity]-[eq : reaction ] ) as @xmath42 for the analysis that follows , it is convenient to use @xmath43 to express the energy equation as @xmath44    we shall focus on the two - dimensional case for simplicity . consider a localized wave moving into an equilibrium , quiescent state and let @xmath45 , @xmath46 , @xmath47 and @xmath48 denote , respectively , the density , pressure , temperature and newtonian sound speed in the fresh mixture ahead of the wave .",
    "we rescale the dependent variables with respect to this reference state .",
    "the independent variables are rescaled as follows : @xmath49 where @xmath50 and @xmath51 are the original spatial variables and @xmath52 is a typical wave speed , which is to be determined in the process of deriving the asymptotic model by requiring non - triviality of the leading - order corrections .",
    "the length scales , @xmath53 , @xmath54 and the time scale , @xmath55 , are chosen to reflect the appropriate physics of weakly non - linear waves .",
    "we assume that @xmath56 is small , which means that the spatial scale of interest in the @xmath5-direction , which is * * related to * * the size of the reaction zone , is small compared with the typical distance covered by acoustic waves in time @xmath55 . for the transverse dimension , we assume the scaling @xmath57 .",
    "this follows from the fact that , along a weakly curved front , a distance @xmath58 in the normal direction corresponds to a distance @xmath59 in the transverse direction .",
    "several dimensionless groups appear upon rescaling of the governing equations .",
    "we define the reynolds , pradtl and lewis numbers , respectively , as follows :    @xmath60    where @xmath61 .",

    "we develop an asymptotic simplification of the above general formulation by considering a weakly nonlinear detonation wave , for which we assume that the heat release is small , the activation energy is large and the newtonian limit , @xmath0 , holds . * * to be precise , we start from ( [ eq : ns - continuity - dimensionless]-[eq : ns - reaction - dimensionless ] ) and make the following assumptions :    1 .",
    "@xmath68 , @xmath69 .",
    "this assumption is chosen to ensure that the reaction rate affects the leading order expansion of @xmath22 . since @xmath70",
    ", this assumption implies that the characteristic time scale , @xmath55 , of weakly nonlinear detonations is large compared to the collision time , @xmath71 , i.e. , @xmath72 .",
    "@xmath73 , @xmath74 .",
    "this assumption implies that the heat release does not play a role at the linear level .",
    "it does not mean that the chemistry is unimportant , but that the heat release must have the appropriate size to balance the nonlinear effects .",
    "the extra factor of @xmath75 in front of @xmath76 arises naturally in the governing equations ( see ( [ eq : ns - temperature - dimensionless ] ) ) and is retained in the definition of @xmath8 . with the further assumption below of small @xmath77 , this implies that @xmath76 is @xmath78 .",
    "3 .   @xmath79 @xmath80 .",
    "this ensures that small temperature deviations  which are @xmath81 for weak shocks in the newtonian limit  have an @xmath82 influence on the reaction rate .",
    "@xmath83 , @xmath84 .",
    "this assumption is needed to balance the temperature fluctuations with both the acoustics and chemistry at the same order . without this assumption ,",
    "the leading order corrections for density , velocity and temperature all behave the same way , as in a weakly nonlinear inert shock @xcite . as we show later",
    ", having a temperature profile that is different from density / velocity profiles is crucial , as it allows the model derived here to incorporate the dynamical instabilities of detonation waves .",
    "@xmath85 and @xmath86 are @xmath82 , while @xmath87 is @xmath88 .",
    "other scalings that highlight different transport effects are of course possible , but they are not considered in this work .    to understand some of the intuition behind the asymptotic ordering above , recall the following well - known fact for weak shocks @xcite . if the shock strength is measured by the relative jump in pressure across the shock , @xmath89 ( subscripts @xmath90 and @xmath91 denoting post- and pre - shock states , respectively ) , then the shock mach number is @xmath92\\,\\delta p+o\\left(\\left(\\delta p\\right)^{2}\\right)$ ] and the shock temperature is @xmath93\\,\\delta p+o\\left(\\left(\\delta p\\right)^{2}\\right)$ ] .",
    "therefore , for weak shocks , with @xmath94 , in the newtonian limit , @xmath95 , the leading - order temperature correction is @xmath81 .",
    "that is , all variables have an @xmath78 jump across the shock , but the temperature jump is smaller , only @xmath81 . in the chosen asymptotic approximation",
    ", we therefore expect similar temperature behavior in the reaction zone as well , at least with inviscid detonations .",
    "+ now , we assume the following expansions in the reaction zone : @xmath96 the fractional powers appear here because we aim at capturing weak curvature effects in the detonation front .",
    "these effects induce a flow velocity transverse to the front , which is @xmath59 smaller than the longitudinal velocity .",
    "expansions of this type are standard for waves incorporating the weak - curvature effect ( e.g. , @xcite ) .    expanding @xmath97",

    "using these relations to eliminate pressure perturbations , ( [ eq : ns - continuity - dimensionless]-[eq : ns - reaction - dimensionless ] ) yield @xmath101 because of the weak heat release assumption , we need to expand only the reaction progress variable and the reaction rate to the leading order .",
    "as we shall see later , the leading - order corrections to temperature are of order @xmath102 , i.e. , @xmath103 , and therefore the leading - order reaction rate is given by @xmath104    balancing @xmath105 terms , we find that @xmath106\\left[\\begin{array}{r } \\rho\\\\ u\\\\ v\\\\ t \\end{array}\\right]_{1x}=\\left[\\begin{array}{r } 0\\\\ 0\\\\ 0\\\\ 0 \\end{array}\\right].\\label{eq : o1-system}\\ ] ] this homogeneous system has non - trivial solutions if and only if the coefficient matrix ( denoted by @xmath107 from now on ) is singular .",

    "we integrate the first equation in ( [ eq : o1-system ] ) to obtain @xmath111 for some , so far arbitrary , functions @xmath112 and @xmath113 . * * in order for our asymptotic expansions to hold as we approach the upstream state , which is assumed to be quiescent and uniform at all times , we require @xmath114 as @xmath115 ( upstream of the wave ) . as a consequence",
    ", it follows that @xmath116 .",
    "had we considered the case where the wave moves into a non - uniform background , the functions @xmath117 and @xmath118 would provide the freedom needed to match the asymptotic expansion in the wave zone to the flow ahead ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "a similar reasoning can be used to deduce from the third and fourth equation in ( [ eq : o1-system ] ) that @xmath119 .    at @xmath120 , we obtain @xmath121\\left[\\begin{array}{r } \\rho\\\\ u\\\\ v\\\\ t \\end{array}\\right]_{2x}=\\left[\\begin{array}{r } 0\\\\ 0\\\\ -u_{y}\\\\ 0 \\end{array}\\right],\\label{eq : o - half - system}\\ ] ] with the same matrix of coefficients , * @xmath107 * , as before . since @xmath107 is singular , this system has solutions if and only if the right - hand side is orthogonal to @xmath122 $ ] , which spans the left null - space of @xmath107 .",

    "however , another reason , which is at play even before the apparently chaotic regime sets on , is that the wave dynamics can involve spatial scales that undergo large changes ( by orders of magnitude ) during the wave evolution .",

    "another common technique is to solve for the potential , @xmath192 , that satisfies @xmath193 again , when chemical reactions are present , complications arise because the reaction rate now becomes an exponential function of @xmath194 and the discretization errors in @xmath194 therefore exponentially amplify , requiring very high - order methods for good accuracy .",

    "we have analyzed it in detail and have shown that it captures many of the dynamical features of detonations in reactive euler equations .",

    "our theory considers weakly nonlinear detonations in the distinguished limit of small heat release , large activation energy and small @xmath77 . in this limit",

    "our reduced evolution system builds on the weakly nonlinear theory in @xcite by adding the newtonian approximation to it . in the one - dimensional and non - dissipative special case",
    ", our theory contains the model in @xcite .    as a consequence of the @xmath156 assumption , the temperature expansion in our analysis starts with an @xmath81 correction to the leading - order term , as opposed to @xmath78 correction in @xcite .",
    "this is precisely what allows us to escape the fact that in @xcite there must be leading - order corrections to temperature , velocity and density that behave exactly the same way .",
    "the present scaling highlights an important difference between a reactive and a non - reactive shock , namely , that the temperature in a reactive shock can increase at some distance from the shock front because of heat release .",
    "this increase in the post - shock temperature means that the energy release can possess a maximum inside the reaction zone . as we previously elucidated with a reactive burgers model @xcite",
    ", the presence of such an internal maximum appears to be a key factor for the mechanism that generates resonances and subsequent amplification of the waves in the reaction zone .",
    "note that all one - dimensional weakly nonlinear asymptotic models as well as the _ ad hoc _ models devised to capture detonation dynamics @xcite are extensions of the burgers equation modified by adding a reaction forcing term , with an extra equation for the reaction progress variable .",
    "the reason is that the dynamics of any one - dimensional genuinely nonlinear hyperbolic system reduces to that of an inviscid burgers equation in the weakly nonlinear limit @xcite .    while the reduced weakly nonlinear asymptotic theory has clear predictive power , as demonstrated in this work , recognizing its limitations is important and helps highlight open problems that require further investigation .",
    "for example , at parameter values ( especially of the heat release ) corresponding to strong cellular and pulsating detonations typical in experiments and numerical simulations , the asymptotic predictions are not sufficiently accurate when compared to the reactive euler equations .",
    "while it is not clear how to extend the present approach directly to strongly nonlinear detonations , the ability of the reduced system obtained in this work to capture essential dynamical characteristics of unsteady and multi - dimensional detonations serves as a strong indication that a theory of comparable simplicity may be possible for strongly nonlinear detonations .",
    "recent work @xcite on the role of dissipation in the compressible reactive navier - stokes system in one spatial dimension indicates that dissipation can have non - trivial effects on the stability of detonation waves .",
    "elucidation of the role played by the transport effects in the asymptotic model is therefore of interest and we believe that the model retaining these effects , as in ( [ eq : asymptotic - model - u]-[eq : asymptotic - model - lambda ] ) , should be investigated further .",
    "a problem that merits exploration , in our opinion , is that of the evolution of a small - amplitude , localized initial perturbation to a detonation wave , considered in the same weakly nonlinear asymptotic regime as in the present work .",
    "all of the underlying assumptions in the theory remain valid for this different initial - value problem , which is relevant to the problem of detonation initiation .    from a mathematical point of view , the reduced system obtained in this work and its connection with the issue of the non - existence of triple - point shock structures for the zabolotskaya - khokhlov equation pose some puzzling and challenging problems .    finally , recall that the qualitative models introduced by fickett and majda do not contain instabilities with the rate functions used in prior work with these models ( e.g. , see @xcite ) .",
    "however , using the rate function derived in this paper ( and , for that matter , the two - step rate function used in @xcite ) can be shown to lead to the same complexity of the solutions as occurs in the reactive euler equations .",
    "a modified fickett s analog can be written as @xmath242 with the `` activation energy '' and `` heat release '' parameters , @xmath243 and @xmath244 , respectively .",
    "clearly , one can treat more general right - hand sides for the rate function in ( [ eq : new - fickett - majda-2 ] ) , such as @xmath245 , as long as @xmath246 and @xmath192 retain the same qualitative properties as their corresponding expressions in ( [ eq : new - fickett - majda-2 ] ) .",
    "this modification , even though simple , reflects the physics of the phenomenon responsible for the dynamics of pulsating detonations by allowing a local maximum in the reaction rate to exist behind the precursor shock in the detonation wave .",
