    "broadband flux variability arises from disk and jet based phenomena .",
    "the periodogram ( eg . van der klis 1989 ) of light curves ( lcs ) of active galactic nuclei implicitly reflects this .",
    "parametric models of the binned periodogram approximate the true expected shape , the power spectral density ( psd ) which is ideally normally distributed making it useful to work with . a statistically appropriate model aids in theoretical modeling of variability .",
    "commonly used parametric models include : power law model ( eg . papadakis & lawrence 1993 ) , @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the red - noise slope in the range of -1 and -2.5 ; broken power law model ( eg .",
    "uttley et al .",
    "2002 ) , @xmath2 and @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the break frequency , @xmath5 is the slope of the high frequency region and @xmath6 is the slope of the low frequency region ; bending power law model ( eg .",
    "uttley et al .",
    "2002 ) , @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the knee frequency , @xmath1 is the slope in the high frequency region above the knee frequency ; power law with a lorentzian qpo model ( eg .",
    "nowak 2000 ) , @xmath0+@xmath9 where @xmath1 is red - noise slope and the second term is a lorentzian function with amplitude @xmath10 , central frequency @xmath11 and quality factor @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the frequency spread in the bin hosting the central frequency .",
    "the likelihood and log - likelihood functions are : @xmath14 @xmath15 is the likelihood function , @xmath16 are the parameters of the parametric models , @xmath17 , to be estimated and @xmath18 is the data periodogram . determining @xmath16 which minimize @xmath19 yields the maximum likelihood values .",
    "confidence levels are determined in a similar manner as that described in press et al .",
    "( 2007 ) for the @xmath20 method .",
    "model selection is carried out using the akaike information criteria ( aic ) and the relative likelihood ( rl ) .",
    "the aic measures the information lost when a model is fit to the data . the model with least information loss ( least aic )",
    "is assumed to be the null model .",
    "the likelihood of other models describing the data as well as the null is determined using the the relative likelihood ( eg .",
    "burnham & anderson 2004 ) .",
    "the aic and rl are defined as : @xmath21 where @xmath22 is a penalty term = number of parameters @xmath16 used in the model , @xmath23 : likelihood of model @xmath24 given the data , @xmath25:likelihood ratio of model @xmath24 relative to that of the null .",
    "models with @xmath26 are close to the best fit , those with @xmath27 are considerably less supported and those with @xmath28 and @xmath29 can not be supported ( burnham & anderson 2004 ) in which case the null remains the best fit . on subtraction of the psd from it ,",
    "the periodogram ideally comprises of @xmath30 distributed white noise ( eg .",
    "chatfield 2009 ) .",
    "the residue from the best fit to the data is tested against the @xmath30 distribution using a goodness of fit test .",
    "a 99% significance level ( based on its cumulative distribution function ) then reveals the outlying qpo .",
    "the xmm newton x - ray light curve ( 0.3 kev - 10 kev ) of rej 1034 + 396 which revealed a qpo of @xmath31 3733 s ( gierliski et al .",
    "2008 ) is analyzed using the periodogram ( 296 bins ) with the above fit models ( results in table [ tab1 ] ) .",
    "the power law with qpo model ( fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) is the best fit model with an aic = 149.8 and a significance of the qpo @xmath32 99.94 % .",
    "parameter estimation with mle and model selection with aic is computationally efficient when compared to monte - carlo simulations based procedures ( uttley et al .",
    "any other parametric model can be easily incorporated into this procedure .",
    "if a statistically significant qpo is detected , a lower limit to the black hole mass and constraints on its spin can be placed assuming that the qpo is from an orbital signature .",
    "theoretical models considering general relativistic effects and emission region structure can be used to simulate psds which can then be compared with observations to yield constraints on physical parameters .",
