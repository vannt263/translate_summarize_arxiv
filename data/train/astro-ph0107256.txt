    "in this work we investigated claims that a modified large - distance curvature may offer an alternative explanation for the sn1a data . to check these claims , we studied the sensitivity of cmb spectrum to the whole range of modes , @xmath17 , when short and large distance regimes are modified .    in @xcite",
    "it was noticed that a modified curvature of the universe at large distance ( when traced back at the time of inflation ) gives rise to a dispersed frequency for the cosmic perturbations .",
    "the field is minimally coupled to the curvature thus its propagation feels the modifications in the background geometry .",
    "we adopted the method of ref .",
    "@xcite in order to find out the effects of curvature deviations on the current astrophysical observables .",
    "the role of a modified curvature of the universe at large distances on the inflationary metric perturbations was analytically described by a family of dispersion relations .",
    "the modification modulates the generalized frequencies of the inflationary perturbation modes at small values of the momenta @xmath18 by departing from linearity around some certain small momenta @xmath19 ( @xmath20 ) with a deviation amplitude @xmath5 .",
    "the nonlinear feature of the dispersion relations , at small momenta @xmath4 and in the transplanckian regime , tracks the curvature deviations at large and short distances , from the conventional frw universe of intermediate scales .",
    "one of the parameters ( @xmath21 ) , in this class of dispersion functions was constrained in order to satisfy the starobinsky bound for negligible backreaction @xcite .    the analytical expression for the cmbr spectrum ( sect .",
    "2 ) , as well as the cmbfast plots of this class of models , deviate from the _ black body scale invariant spectrum_. the deviation function @xmath22 , given in sect .",
    "2 and the appendix , which measures departure from the scale - invariant spectrum ( deviation from thermality in the the bogoliubov coefficient ) , depends on two free parameters , the scale @xmath4 and the amplitude of the curvature modifications @xmath5 .",
    "the tilt produced in the spectrum due to @xmath22 is present for all modification scales @xmath20 ( these values of the physical momenta correspond to the time of inflation ) .",
    "the tilt is less pronounced for scale modifications corresponding to length scales less or equal to the horizon of the last scattering surface , and in this case , the main constraint comes from the modifications to the amplitude of the first acoustic peak and the fact that curvature modifications in the intermediate frw universe scales are under direct observation .",
    "it remains interesting to answer why the only curvature modifications that for a small range of @xmath4 and @xmath5 can reconcile with the conventional cmb spectrum are allowed only around the last scattering @xmath8 scales .",
    "the scale and amplitude of the deviations from the conventional spectrum , are severely constrained from the observed cmb spectrum to be within @xmath23 of the scale and amplitude of the first peak .",
    "although it is counterintuitive , since large distance would correspond to low energy theories , our results indicate that any modifications in the large scale curvature of the universe , is tightly constrained from cmb data , to a very small range of deviations from the curvature of the intermediate frw universe .",
    "perhaps , there is a natural way that would explain such a universe with an frw spacetime at intermediate and very large distances but with small curvature deviations around @xmath8 , without the need to appeal to fine - tuning .",
    "but if not , then theoretical cosmological models would have to account for the negative pressure dark energy of the universe .",
    "the analysis of the sensitivity of the cmb spectrum for the whole range of modes in a de sitter background space , with modifications in the short and large distance physics , reveal : the spectrum is insensitive to the details of _ short - distance physics and the cuttoff scale _ @xmath24 ( the transplanckian regime ) only for an _ initial adiabatic vacuum state _ ; the scale - invariance of the spectrum and the amplitude of the first acoustic peak _ are very sensitive to modifications of large distance physics _",
    "( low momentum modes ) ; _ the spectrum is also highly sensitive to the choice of the initial conditions_. in our class of dispersion models , the initial vacuum state is well - defined since the background ( @xmath25 ) goes asymptotically flat at early times ( bunch - davis vacuum @xcite ) .",
    "the cmb spectrum for this class of models is indeed insensitive to short distance modifications , as it can be checked by taking the limit when large scale modification parameters @xmath26 go to zero , in which case the conventional scale - invariant spectrum is recovered . therefore all the features observed in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , are due to large - scale curvature modifications only .",
