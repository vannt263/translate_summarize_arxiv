    "exploring various phases of quark and nuclear matter is one of the primary goals in high - energy heavy - ion collision physics . compared to the qcd phase transition at high @xmath0 ,",
    "less is known for the cold and dense matter , partly because the lattice monte - carlo simulations are difficult at large @xmath1 .",
    "one of the most instructive approaches to compressed baryonic matter is to consider the strong coupling limit ( scl ) of lattice qcd  @xcite .",
    "in fact , effective free energies at finite @xmath0 and @xmath1 have been analytically derived in scl , and it is successfully applied to nuclear many - body problems  @xcite . while baryon effects would be important in dense matter , they have been ignored in finite @xmath0 treatments through the @xmath5 expansion ( @xmath6 is the spatial dimension ) .    in this proceedings",
    ", first we derive an expression of the effective free energy at finite @xmath0 and @xmath1 including baryon effects  @xcite .",
    "we find the second and first order phase transition at high and low @xmath0 , separated by the tricritical point ( tcp ) in the chiral limit . with finite quark masses ,",
    "these second order phase boundary and tcp become the cross over and the critical end point , thus the obtained phase diagram seems to show essential qualitative features of that in the real world .",
    "one of the problems in scl is in the ratio , @xmath7 ; this ratio would be larger than two in the real world , but it is less than one half in all of the works based on scl . in the second part of this proceedings ,",
    "we demonstrate that the ratio increases to @xmath8 at @xmath9 with @xmath3 corrections . with finite bare quark mass and baryon effects , it may be possible to understand the shape of the actual phase diagram .",
    "in scl , we ignore pure gluonic action ( @xmath10 ) , and we obtain the following staggered fermion effective action after integrating spatial links , @xmath11 \\exp\\left[-s_f^{(0 ) }      + \\frac12 ( m , v_m m )      + ( \\bar{b},v_b b ) \\right]\\ , , \\label{eq : actiona}\\ ] ] where @xmath12 , and the mesonic and baryonic composites and their propagators are @xmath13 , @xmath14 , @xmath15 and @xmath16 .",
