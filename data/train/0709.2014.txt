    "it is well known that this approach is not gauge invariant and the results may depend on the gauge of the vector and scalar potentials . physically , gauge invariant response is a manifestation of local charge conservation in the system .",
    "we recall that the usual restricted conductivity sum rule for the normal state ( ns ) @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the intraband optical spectral weight and @xmath6 the so called effective kinetic energy per unit cell ( @xmath7 stands for the spin index , @xmath8 is the dispersion relation , and @xmath9 the occupation factor ) , is a consequence of the gauge invariance @xcite .",
    "for concreteness we have considered the conductivity along the @xmath10-axis .",
    "the ns conductivity calculated using a no - vc approach need thus not satisfy the sum rule . similarly , for the superconducting state ( scs ) , the spectral weight of the condensate @xmath11 , which is given by @xmath12 as obtained within a no - vc calculation , may be rather different from that of the corresponding gauge - invariant approach .",
    "these possible problems call for an assessment of the contribution of the relevant vc to @xmath13 .",
    "another reason for studying the vc has been highlighted by millis and coworkers .",
    "if the vc were negligible , the infrared ( ir ) conductivity would be determined solely by the quasiparticle selfenergy , that can be , at least in principle , extracted from photoemission data .",
    "millis and drew @xcite found out , however , that the effective scattering rate in optimally doped bi@xmath14sr@xmath14cacu@xmath14o@xmath15 obtained using the selfenergy estimated from the photoemission data , is much higher than the value resulting from the ir data .",
    "similarly , millis _",
    "_ @xcite demonstrated that the local selfenergy obtained by fitting ( without vc ) the ir data of thin films of pr@xmath16ce@xmath17cuo@xmath18 leads to much lower ( by a factor of 3 - 4 ) values of the quasiparticle velocity than observed by photoemission .",
    "these discrepancies appear to imply the presence of large vc .",
    "a brief account of the vc to the ns conductivity of cuprate superconductors has been given by monthoux and pines in one of the pioneering papers on the nearly antiferromagnetic fermi liquid ( nafl ) model @xcite .",
    "for this particular model , the vc have been found to cause a slight increase ( about 20% ) of resistivity .",
    "current vertex renormalization within the conserving fluctuation exchange ( flex ) approach @xcite has been systematically investigated by kontani and coworkers ( see , e.g. , refs .   and and references therein ) .",
    "they successfully explained the anomalous temperature dependence of the hall conductivity in cuprates and estimated the contribution of the vc to the normal state conductivity .",
    "et al._@xcite and aristov and zeyher @xcite discuss the role of the vc in the context of optical response of systems possessing the @xmath19-density wave ground state , that might occur in the pseudogap regime of underdoped cuprates .",
    "we are not aware , however , of any work incorporating the vc in computations of the optical response in the superconducting state .",
    "the purpose of the present study is to explore the role played by the vc , both in the ns and in the scs state , within the spin - fermion model , where charged planar quasiparticles are coupled to spin fluctuations ( sf ) .",
    "we discuss the violation , in the absence of vc , of the ns sum rule , the impact of the vc on the dc conductivity , on the spectral weight of the superconducting condensate , and on the shape of @xmath20 .",
    "an important finding is that the incorporation of the vc leads to a spectral - weight shift from far - infrared ( fir ) to mid - infrared ( mir ) .",

    "this description is particularly suitable for situations , where the coupling to the sf is not the only cause of superconductivity and provides an _ additional _ renormalization of the quasiparticles .",
    "the magnitude of the superconducting gap can be tuned by changing the input amplitude @xmath37 of @xmath36 .",
    "an important advantage of the hybrid approach is that it avoids the necessity of numerical continuation from matsubara frequencies to the real axis .    within the framework of the linear response theory ,",

    "the vertex corrections neglected ( nv ) and with the vertex corrections included ( vc ) for three values of the energy of the resonant mode in the spin susceptibility .",
    "the vertical lines are located at the characteristic energies of @xmath148 , @xmath149 , and @xmath150 .",
    ", width=309 ]    figure  [ fig : wfun ] shows the spectra of @xmath112 for three values of the energy of the magnetic mode .",
    "it can be seen that the first maximum and the minimum are located close to @xmath148 and @xmath149 , respectively , in agreement with the above considerations .",
    "the second maximum corresponding to the kink is , in the absence of vc , located somewhat below @xmath150 .",
    "finally , we address the role of the vc .",
    "they lead ( a ) to an increase in the amplitude of the structures of @xmath1 and @xmath112 , which is due to the combined effect of the significant decrease of @xmath91 [ see the inset of fig .  [",
    "fig : spect ] ( a ) ] and a sharpening of the features in @xmath76 , and ( b ) , to a slight shift of the structures towards lower energies .",
    "the shift may be partially caused by a weak attractive interaction between the quasiparticles leading to an excitonic effect .",
    "the changes of the infrared conductivity caused by the vertex corrections ( vc ) are not dramatic , which provides a justification for earlier computations , where these corrections were neglected",
    ". some aspects of the changes , however , appear to be important .",
    "+ ( i ) the normal state conductivity computed without the vc does not satisfy the restricted sum rule .",
    "the calculated spectral weight at finite frequencies ( @xmath13 ) is by a few percent lower than the value dictated by the sum rule .",
    "the incorporation of the vc leads to the increase of @xmath13 , removing this discrepancy .",
    "+ ( ii ) the increase of @xmath13 is associated with a broadening of @xmath76 . the far - infrared conductivity ( including the dc value )",
    "may decrease or increase depending on the magnitude of the change of @xmath13 and the degree of the broadening ; at high frequencies the conductivity increases . for our values of the input parameters ,",
    "@xmath76 decreases ( increases ) below ( above ) ca @xmath151 .",
    "+ ( iii ) the increase of @xmath13 occurs also for the superconducting state .",
    "since the sum of @xmath13 and the spectral weight of the superconducting condensate remains constant , this implies a reduction of the latter . for relevant values of the input parameters , the weight of the condensate decreases by 15 - 20% .",
    "+ ( iv ) the vc lead to an amplification of the characteristic features in the superconducting state spectra of the inverse scattering rate @xmath1 , that have been used to support the spin - fluctuation scenario : the onset of @xmath1 around @xmath136 becomes steeper and the maximum around @xmath80 more pronounced .",
    "in addition to studying the changes brought about by the vc , we have also investigated the role of selfconsistency by comparing the results obtained using the selfconsistent eliashberg equations with those of the nonselfconsistent hybrid approach ( i.e. , approximately , the first iteration of the equations ) .",
    "the main results are ( a ) the hybrid approach considerably overestimates the magnitude of the quasiparticle selfenergy , which leads to lower values of the conductivity in far - infrared , and ( b ) some spectral features , in particular the sharp maximum in the superconducting state spectra centered at ca @xmath80 and the kink at ca @xmath2 appear only at the selfconsistent level . with the aid of the quasiparticle spectral function @xmath86",
    ", we attribute the kink to the onset of transitions involving incoherent satellites of @xmath86 corresponding to states with doubly excited resonance mode .",
    "the computed spectra are in reasonable agreement with experimental data of optimally doped cuprates , including such details as the shape of the maximum in the inverse scattering rate .",
    "in addition , the theory allows one to interpret most of the features of the data in terms of bogoljubov quasiparticles and magnetic excitations . in the superconducting state , a crucial role is played by the resonance mode .",
    "we are not aware of any comparable interpretation in terms of electron - phonon coupling .",
