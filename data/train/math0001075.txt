    "in the present work two problems from the theory of filtration through a horizontal porous stratum are considered .",
    "first we study a short , but intense , flooding followed by natural outflow through the vertical face of an aquifer .",
    "further , we consider the possibility to control the spreading of the water mound by use of forced drainage at the boundary .",
    "an important practical example of such a problem is groundwater mound formation and extension following a flood , after a breakthrough of a dam , when water ( possibly contaminated ) enters and then slowly extends into a river bank .",
    "consider an aquifer that consists of a long porous stratum with an impermeable bed at the bottom and a permeable vertical face on one side ( fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1 ] ) .",
    "the space coordinate @xmath0 is directed along the horizontal axis with @xmath1 at the vertical face .",
    "a water reservoir is located in the region @xmath2 .",
    "we assume that the flow is homogeneous in the y - direction . the height of the resulting mound is denoted by @xmath3 . the initial level of water in the stratum is assumed to be negligible .",
    "the problem is formulated as follows . at some time @xmath4 ,",
    "the water level at the wall begins to rise rapidly , and water enters the porous medium . by time",
    "@xmath5 , the water level at the vertical face returns to the initial one.we assume that the distribution at time @xmath5 is given by @xmath6 and is concentrated over a finite region @xmath7 $ ] ( compactly supported ) .",
    "we also assume that @xmath8 is concave down and @xmath9 is gently sloping .    in problem 1 , water naturally seeps through the boundary back into the reservoir , giving the boundary condition @xmath10 .",
    "inclusion of the effects of capillary retention into the model distinguishes our case from the well know dipole - type problem .",
    "the numerical and asymptotic solutions for the source - type boundary conditions were obtained in  [ 6 ] .",
    "most recently , the dipole - type problem with capillary retention was studied numericaly and analytically , using lie - group techniques , by b. wagner in  [ 7 ] .",
    "analysis and numeric computations show that in the case of natural outflow , the water mound is not extinguished in finite time . the outflow rate can not be further increased by lowering the level at the boundary . in problem 2 , in order to control the spreading of the water mound , forced drainage is introduced .",
    "the problem formulation was proposed in  [ 3 ] , where a complete mathematical derivation and rigorous analysis can be found .",
    "the forced drainage can be implemented , for instance , by drilling a number of holes or horizontal wells near the impermeable bottom . in this way",
    ", an additional discharge rate is created , and the fluid level becomes zero on some interval @xmath11 $ ] .",
    "these are certainly highly idealized problems , but their solutions allow one to extract the qualitative properties and to check the numerical methods in solving more realistic problems .",
    "in the case of seepage and gently sloping profile @xmath12 and in the absence of capillary retention , the model of flow in a porous stratum is described by the boussinesq equation ( [ 4 ] see also  [ 2],[1 ] ) : @xmath13 here @xmath14 , @xmath15 is the permeability of the medium , @xmath16 its porosity ( the fraction of the volume in the stratum which is occupied by the pores ) , @xmath17 the fluid density , @xmath18 its dynamic viscosity , and @xmath19 the acceleration of gravity .",
    "according to the hydrostatic law , water pressure @xmath20 .",
    "then , the total head @xmath21 is constant throughout the height of the mound . under the assumption of seepage and gently sloping profiles @xmath22 ,",
    "darcy law is used to obtain the relation for the total flux @xmath23 .",
    "mathematical properties of the boussinesq equation are well known  [ 5 ] .",
    "an essential feature of this equation is the finite speed of disturbance propagation given a finite ( compactly supported ) initial distribution .",
    "another important feature of this equation is the existence of special self - similar solutions .",
    "the graphs of such a solution for any two times @xmath24 and @xmath25 are related via a similarity transformation  [ 1 ] .",
    "the special solutions , themselves corresponding to certain , sometimes artificial , initial and boundary conditions , are important because they provide intermediate asymptotics for a wide class of initial value problems .",
    "for these problems , the details of the initial distribution affect the solution only in the beginning ; after some time , the solution approaches a self - similar asymptotics .",
    "the boussinesq equation has been studied extensively and a number of self - similar solutions , for different boundary conditions , have been constructed ( [ 2 ] ,  [ 3 ] ) .",
    "following  [ 1 ] ,  [ 6 ] , the boussinesq equation can be modified to incorporate the effects of capillary retention into the model . if we exclude the possibility of water reentering the region that was filled with water at some earlier time and assume that initially the stratum is empty , we have the following situation : when water enters a pore , it occupies the entire volume , allowed by active porosity ; when water leaves the pore , a fraction @xmath26 of the pore volume remains occupied by the trapped water .",
    "we assume that @xmath26 is constant .",
    "let us denote the initial active porosity by @xmath16 . then",
    ", when water is entering previously unfilled pores , the effective porosity is @xmath16 ; when water is leaving previously water - filled pores , the effective porosity becomes @xmath27 .",
    "hence , in the presence of capillary retention , porosity depends on the sign of @xmath28 .",
    "notice , that permeability can be assumed unaffected , as the effect of capillary forces on permeability is significant only for small and/or dead - end pores , whose contribution to the total flux , in the first approximation , can be neglected .    the rate of change in the amount of water @xmath29 inside a volume element ( fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1 ] ) is equal to : @xmath30 on the other hand , the rate of change in the volume of water due to the flux through the faces of a volume element @xmath31 is equal to @xmath32 we denote @xmath33 and @xmath34 .",
    "then , using the continuity of flux ( no sources inside the water mound ) and the balance of mass we obtain : @xmath35 this is a nonlinear parabolic partial differential equation with discontinuous coefficients , also known as the generalized porous medium equation  [ 2 ] ,  [ 6 ] .",
    "continuity of the flux @xmath36 implies that at the mound tip @xmath37 , where mound height is zero , the flux is also zero . for problem 1",
    ", these considerations lead to the following initial and boundary conditions to supplement equation ( [ eq1 ] ) : @xmath38 the second line in  ( [ eq2 ] ) corresponds to the free boundary conditions on the right boundary , @xmath39 , which is unknown a priori .",
    "it should be noted that for the solution of equation  ( [ eq0 ] ) ( but not for  ( [ eq1 ] ) ) with boundary conditions  ( [ eq2 ] ) the dipole moment is constant : @xmath40    we call equation ( [ eq1 ] ) with boundary conditions ( [ eq2 ] ) a dipole - type problem .",
    "a similar problem , for source type initial and boundary conditions was considered in  [ 6 ] , see also  [ 1 ] .    for problem 2 ,",
    "the boundary conditions are changed to include the forced drainage condition .",
    "the discharge rate @xmath41 , which is a quantity that should be specified , determines the boundary condition at the left free boundary @xmath42 . @xmath43",
    "the second and third lines in ( [ eq2_1 ] ) define , respectively , the free boundary condition on the right boundary and the forced drainage condition on the left boundary . equation ( [ eq1 ] ) together with boundary conditions ( [ eq2_1 ] ) define problem  2 .",
    "the parameters in the problem are @xmath44 , @xmath45 - the initial width of the water mound , and @xmath46 - the initial dipole moment .",
    "we can take the dimensions as follows : @xmath47=h$ ] , @xmath48=l$ ] , @xmath49=t$ ] . then from equation ( [ eq1 ] ) we have @xmath50=\\frac{l^2}{th}$ ] . for the remaining parameters @xmath51=l$ ] , @xmath52=h \\cdot l^2 $ ] .",
    "the dimensions for @xmath53 and @xmath0 are set to be independent .",
    "this can be done because the differential equation ( [ eq1 ] ) is invariant with respect to the following group of transformations : @xmath54 the invariance insures that we can scale the units of measurement for @xmath53 , while keeping the units for @xmath0 unchanged .",
    "the following dimensionless quantities can be obtained from these parameters : @xmath55 it follows that @xmath56 .",
    "since for large times , @xmath57 , the parameter @xmath58 , it would seem natural to set @xmath59 , as in the case of @xmath60 , and look for a solution of the form : @xmath61    however , this leads to a contradiction when we consider an ordinary differential equation obtained from ( [ eq1 ] ) : @xmath62 multiplying both sides by @xmath63 we obtain an equation in total differentials , which is readily solved : @xmath64 observe that near @xmath65 , where the height of the mound vanishes , the first equation holds . at @xmath65",
    ", @xmath53 vanishes along with the flux , which is proportional to @xmath66 . from the first equation at @xmath67",
    ", we obtain that @xmath68 .",
    "similarly , evaluating the second expression at @xmath69 , where @xmath70 , we find that @xmath71 .",
    "next , evaluating the two expressions at @xmath72 , we obtain : @xmath73 and using @xmath74 we obtain @xmath75 . for @xmath76",
    ", the solution can be found  [ 2 ] and thus the assumption of complete similarity in @xmath77 is correct .",
    "however , in the case of @xmath78 , we have @xmath79 .",
    "this is a contradiction , because the change in sign of @xmath80 should occur inside the mound , where the height is positive .",
    "hence , the assumption of complete similarity for @xmath78 does not hold .",
    "we next solve the problem numerically and study the asymptotic behavior of the solution .",
    "in order to simplify the numerical solution for equation ( [ eq1 ] ) with free boundary conditions ( [ eq2 ] ) , we use a change of variables : @xmath81 .",
    "we set @xmath82 , and equation ( [ eq1 ] ) is transformed : @xmath83 with boundary conditions @xmath84 .",
    "this effectively fixes the right boundary at @xmath85 .",

    "for each value of @xmath106 , we find a value of @xmath105 such that the boundary conditions are satisfied .",
    "we use a high order , taylor - expansion - based method to start the integration at @xmath116 followed by a 4th order runge - kutta method and an iterative procedue to arrive at the value for @xmath105 such that the third condition @xmath121 is satisfied . for computational convenience , we transform the differential equation by changing variables : @xmath122 , so that @xmath123 does not have a singularity at @xmath115 . in this manner , we obtain the dependence of @xmath105 on @xmath106 ( fig .
