    "[ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^ \" , ]      clumpy torus models ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) and in particular the @xcite models ( also known as clumpy models ) have been shown to fit well the near and mid - ir seds and spectroscopy of seyfert galaxies @xcite .",
    "the clumpy torus models are described by six parameters to account for the torus geometry and the properties of the dusty clouds ( see table  [ tab : torusmodels ] ) .",
    "the geometry of the torus is defined with the torus radial thickness @xmath10 , which is the ratio between the outer and inner radii of the torus @xmath11k , and the agn bolometric luminosity @xmath12 .",
    "then the dust sublimation radius in pc is @xmath13 , where the agn bolometric luminosity is in units of @xmath14 . ] , and the width of the angular distribution of the clouds @xmath15 , that is , the angular size of the torus as measured from its equator .",
    "the clouds have an optical depth @xmath16 and are arranged with a radial distribution expressed as a declining power law with index @xmath17 ( @xmath18 ) , with @xmath19 giving the mean number of clouds along a radial equatorial ray .",
    "the last parameter is the viewing angle to the torus @xmath20 .",
    "we refer the reader to the sketch of the clumpy model geometry in figure  1 of @xcite .",
    "we updated the fit of @xcite with two main differences .",
    "first , we used the higher angular resolution mid - ir unresolved flux densities inferred in section  [ sec : trecs ] and also included the t - recs mid - ir spectrum for the fit .",
    "second , this galaxy is classified as a seyfert 1.5 ( it shows a broad component in h@xmath21 , * ? ? ? * ) and therefore there is an unobscured view to the agn . to account for it , we added an agn component to the resulting torus model ( see below ) and allowed for a small amount of foreground extinction ( @xmath22mag , see * ? ? ? * ) , to redden the fitted models .",
    "we also included in the nuclear sed the hst / nicmos @xmath23 m unresolved flux @xcite .    similarly to our previous work @xcite , we took a bayesian approach to both fit the torus models to the data and derive meaningful confidence levels for the fitted parameters . to this end",
    ", we used the bayesclumpy ( bc ) fitting routine , an interpolated version of the clumpy models @xcite .",
    "the new version of bc allows to fit both photometric points and spectra . for the modelling we used the whole range of parameters probed by the clumpy models .",
    "we list them in table  [ tab : torusmodels ] . unlike in some of our previous work , here we allowed for the torus extent to vary in the range @xmath24 , instead of restricting the models to small tori .",
    "this is because larger tori may be required to reproduce the far - ir emission of agn @xcite .",
    "in addition to the six torus model parameters to be fitted plus the foreground extinction , there is an extra parameter to account for the vertical displacement needed to match the fluxes of a given model to the observations .",
    "this vertical shift , which we allow to vary freely , scales with the agn bolometric luminosity ( see * ? ? ?",
    "we assumed uniform distributions in the ranges given in table  [ tab : torusmodels ] for the prior distributions of the torus model parameters .",
    "the bc fitting routine translates the probability distributions of the fitted torus model parameters into two model spectra .",
    "the first corresponds to the maximum - a - posteriori ( map ) values that represent the best fit to the data , while the second is the model produced with the median value of the probability distribution of each parameter .",
    "[ fig : torusmodel ] shows the best fit to the nuclear near and mid - ir sed and the mid - ir spectrum of the ngc  1365 agn .",
    "we also plot in this figure the range of acceptable torus models at the @xmath25 confidence level .",
    "as can be seen from this figure , the fit to the photometric and spectroscopic data is very good .",
    "specifically , the clumpy models reproduce well the flat silicate feature at around @xmath26 m ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* their figures 16 and 17 ) .",
    "we can now compare the inferred torus model parameters with observations .",
    "we start with the agn bolometric luminosity .",
    "as explained above , we chose to keep the scaling of the torus models to the observations as a free parameter . because the scaling is proportional to the agn bolometric luminosity , when compared with the observations it provides information about the goodness of the fit ( see * ? ? ? * for more details ) .",
    "the derived agn bolometric luminosity from our fit is @xmath27 .",
    "@xcite infered a @xmath28kev luminosity in the range @xmath29 ( corrected for the assumed distance in this work ) .",
    "our derived agn bolometric luminosity is consistent with the values from x - rays after applying a bolometric correction .",
    "we can also compare the torus radius @xmath30pc and torus angular width @xmath31 from the modelling with observations .",
    "the width of the angular distribution of the clouds in the torus is related to the opening angle of the ionization cones , with some dependence with the geometry of the gas ( see discussion in * ? ? ?",
    "the half opening angle of the ngc  1365 ionization cone modeled by @xcite is @xmath32deg ( measured from the pole ) , which is compatible with the derived angular size of the torus .",
    "the size ( diameter ) of the @xmath33 m emitting source inferred from the modelling of the mid - ir interferometric observations of this galaxy is @xmath34pc @xcite .",
    "we note that the size of the @xmath33 m emitting source , which traces the warm dust within the torus , is expected to be smaller than the _ true _ size of the torus .",
    "this is because the @xmath33 m emission is rather insensitive to cooler material further from the nucleus ( see discussion in * ? ? ?",
    "given the good agreement with the observations , we conclude that the fitted torus model provides a good representation of the agn torus emission .      to estimate the agn far - ir flux density in the pacs bands , we extrapolated the fitted torus model beyond @xmath35 m .",
    "as can be seen from fig .",
    "[ fig : torusmodel ] , the torus model flux density peaks at @xmath36 m and falls off rapidly at longer wavelengths .",
    "this is similar to results for other agn ( see e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in table",
    "[ tab : agnfluxes ] we list the extrapolated agn far - ir flux densities together with those in the mid - ir from the t - recs imaging and spectroscopy .",
    "the ranges given in this table for the far - ir fluxes from the bc fit of the ngc  1365 take into account the @xmath37 confidence region of the fitted clumpy torus models .",
    "a quick comparison between the extrapolated agn far - ir fluxes and the aperture photometry of the central regions ( table  [ tab : photometry ] ) clearly shows that the agn contribution at these wavelengths is small and decreases for increasing wavelengths . within the central 5.4kpc ( @xmath38 )",
    "the agn is predicted to contribute @xmath39 ( @xmath40 , @xmath41 ) of the total @xmath3 m emission . at @xmath42",
    "m the agn accounts for at most 2% of the emission in the same region and less than 1% at 100 and @xmath43 m .",
    "using the flux densities measured for @xmath38 and the following equation from @xcite ,    @xmath44    we estimate a @xmath45 m luminosity within the ilr region of @xmath46 .",
    "the ratio between the agn bolometric luminosity and the ir luminosity of this region is then @xmath47 .",
    "this is in good agreement with findings for the majority of local lirgs hosting an agn @xcite .",
    "the central region of ngc  1365 is a bright source of mid- and far - ir emission ( see e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , although its contribution to the integrated emission of the galaxy decreases significantly at longer wavelengths .",
    "the mid - ir morphology , especially in the irac 5.8 and @xmath48 m and in the t - recs images , resembles that of a circumnuclear ring of star formation with a diameter of approximately 1.8kpc ( see figs .",
    "[ fig : ircentralimages ] and [ fig : trecs ] ) .",
    "the agn and the bright mid - ir clusters m4 , m5 , and m6 identified ( see table  [ tab : sources ] ) by @xcite out to @xmath49 m are also clearly identified in the gemini / t - recs image at @xmath1 m ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : trecs ] ) .",
    "the region to the southwest of the agn is more diffuse and similar to the h@xmath50 morphology ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : closeups ] , upper panel ) .",
    "we do not , however , identify any bright compact sources there .",
    "this diffuse emission is reminiscent of the optical morphology of the region containing superstar clusters ssc3 and ssc6 along with a number of less luminous optical clusters @xcite .    in the spitzer / mips @xmath3 m image the emission from the agn",
    "is still differentiated from that of the mid - ir clusters , although the latter are not resolved individually because of the decreased angular resolution .",
    "the herschel observations of ngc  1365 show that the far - ir agn emission becomes faint when compared to that of the clusters .",
    "this is not only because the clusters in the central region of ngc  1365 are still intrinsically bright in the far - ir , but also because in general the agn emission is observed to fall steeply in the far - ir ( see e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "moreover , in general the far - ir emission of agn appears to be dominated by a starburst component @xcite .",
    "it is also apparent from fig .",
    "[ fig : ircentralimages ] that the group of clusters m5 ... m8 are brighter than the group of m2 and m3 in the far - ir , as is also the case in the mid - ir",
    ". this implies , as will be discussed further in section  [ sec : sfr ] , that the obscured star formation rate ( sfr ) is higher in the former group than in the latter .",
    "moreover , the morphology of the sfr tracers ( e.g. , the @xmath51 , @xmath52 , and @xmath42 m emissions ) is similar to that of the molecular gas , especially that of the rare c@xmath53o(j=2 - 1 ) isotope @xcite , where a `` twin - peak '' morphology is observed .",
    "such molecular gas twin peaks are observed in barred galaxies @xcite and are formed where dust lanes intersect nuclear rings of star formation , as is the case of ngc  1365 .",
    "we can also compare the ir morphology , in particular at 8 , 24 , and @xmath42 m , of the ilr region with that of h@xmath50+[nii ] image shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : closeups ] has not been continuum subtracted , and thus we restrict our discussion to the h@xmath50 bright hot spots identified by other works ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "since all these emissions probe the sfr in galaxies @xcite , a good morphological correspondence on scales of hundreds of parsecs is expected .",
    "[ fig : closeups ] indeed shows that the h@xmath50 hot spots in the ilr region ( table  4 , and also * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) are clearly associated with ir emitting regions ( compare with the irac @xmath48 m image as it has the best angular resolution ) .",
    "this seems to be the case out to @xmath54 m . at longer wavelengths the decreased angular resolution of the herschel images",
    "does not allow us to compare the morphologies .",
    "the opposite is not necessary true because the h@xmath50 emission is strongly affected by extinction caused by the prominent dust lane crossing the ilr region .",
    "mid - ir clusters m4 and m5 appear to be detected in the h@xmath50 image , but they are very faint .",
    "this is because they are in one of the regions with the highest extinction , as we shall see in more detail in section  [ sec : silicatefeature ] .",
    "the spitzer / irs map of the [ neii]@xmath4 m emission covering the central 2.2kpc of ngc  1365 is shown in fig.[fig : spectralmaps ] .",
    "this emission line is a good tracer of the current sfr because its luminosity is proportional to the number of ionizing photons @xcite .",
    "the [ neii ] emission appears as a partial ring and it is enhanced in the mid - ir clusters .",
    "its morphology is similar to the pacs @xmath42 m morphology and the co `` twin peaks '' discussed by @xcite .",
    "the agn of ngc  1365 , on the other hand is not a bright [ neii]@xmath4 m source , as found for other active galaxies ( see e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "analogously to other sfr indicators , namely the 24 and @xmath42 m emissions , the region to the northeast of the agn ( clusters m4 , m5 , and m6 ) is brighter in [ neii ] than the region of clusters m2 and m3 .",
    "the regions containing these bright mid - ir clusters account for approximately @xmath55 of the total [ ne ii]@xmath4 m emission in the central 2.2kpc ( see table  [ tab : spectroscopy ] ) .",
    "note , however that the emission from the clusters is unresolved at the spitzer / irs sl angular resolution and we did not apply a correction for unresolved emission .",
    "therefore this contribution from the clusters should be taken as a lower limit .",
    "figure  [ fig : spectralmaps ] also shows the maps of the 6.2 and the @xmath5 m pah features .",
    "both features probe mostly the emission from b stars rather than that from massive on - going star formation ( o stars , see * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "the @xmath56 m pah morphology is very similar to [ neii ] , whereas the @xmath5 m pah map appears to have a deficit of emission in the region to the northeast of the agn .",
    "the map of the ratio between these two features is in fig .",
    "[ fig : silicatespahratio ] .",
    "although several works found variations in the pah ratios of galaxies not explained by changes in the extinction ( see e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , in the case of the central region of ngc  1365 it might be entirely due to extinction .",
    "the 6.2 to @xmath5 m pah ratio is strongly increased in the region enclosing clusters m4 , m5 , m6 , which is also the region suffering the highest extinction ( see section  [ sec : silicatefeature ] and fig .  [ fig : silicatespahratio ] ) . since the relative absorption at @xmath5 m is higher than at @xmath56 m ( see e.g. , table  5 in * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , correcting the @xmath5 m pah map for extinction would produce a morphology similar to that of the @xmath56 m pah map .",
    "the measured ew and pah ratios of the regions not affected by strong extinction are similar to those measured in other starburst galaxies ( see e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "we conclude that the star formation activity inside the ilr region of ngc  1365 has been taking place for at least a few tens of million years , as the pah features trace the emission from b stars @xcite , and is taken place currently because of the bright [ neii]@xmath4 m emission requires the presence of young ionizing stars .",
    "the circumnuclear region of ngc  1365 is crossed by a prominent dust lane entering the ring ( see * ? ? ? * and references therein and also figs .",
    "[ fig : pacs100_large ] and [ fig : closeups ] ) .",
    "this dust lane is still apparent in the shortest wavelength irac bands and can be seen passing between clusters m5 and m6 at @xmath57 m ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : ircentralimages ] ) .",
    "the brightest mid - ir clusters m4 , m5 , and m6 are located at the edge of the dust features where the bar dust lane enters the ilr region to the northeast of the agn ( * ? ? ?",
    "* and also figs .",
    "[ fig : ircentralimages ] and [ fig : closeups ] ) .",
    "mid - ir clusters m2 and m3 to the southwest of the nucleus are in a region less affected by extinction and are likely to be associated with optical super star clusters and optically - detected hii regions @xcite .",
    "the broad feature at @xmath58 m is believed to be produced by amorphous silicate grains and in _ normal _ star - forming galaxies is observed in mild absorption @xcite . in the simplest dust geometry of a purely absorbing foreground screen",
    "the observed apparent depth of this feature is proportional to the optical extinction .",
    "the general variation of the obscuration inside the ilr region of ngc  1365 revealed by the optical imaging can be traced with the spectral map of the silicate feature . as can be seen from fig .",
    "[ fig : silicatespahratio ] , the apparent strength of the silicate feature is high ( in absorption ) in the region encompassing clusters m4 , m5 , and m6 to the northeast of the agn , almost zero at the location of the agn , and intermediate ( also in absorption ) around clusters m2 and m3 .    in table  [ tab : spectroscopy ] we list the strength of the silicate feature measured in the sl 1d spectra of selected regions . assuming a foreground screen of dust and adopting the @xcite extinction law ( @xmath59 ) , the observed apparent depths of the star - forming regions in the circumnuclear region of ngc  1365 imply values of the visual extinction of between @xmath60mag and @xmath61mag for the regions of clusters m2+m3,and m4+m5+m6 , respectively .",
    "the high value of the extinction derived for the latter region is entirely consistent with the values derived by @xcite for the individual clusters using hydrogen recombination lines . our value of the extinction in the region containing m2 and m3 is higher than the optical estimate for the l2 and l3 hii regions from @xcite .    the apparent strength of the silicate feature of the agn measured from the spitzer / irs sl spectrum is @xmath62 ( table  [ tab : spectroscopy ] ) indicating that the feature is present slightly in absorption .",
    "this value , however , is contaminated by extended emission as is apparent from the @xmath48 m image ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : closeups ] ) and the presence of pah features in the irs nuclear spectrum ( fig .",
    "[ fig : slspectra ] ) .",
    "indeed , the gemini / t - recs high angular resolution spectrum of the agn is mostly a featureless continuum with no evidence of pah feature emission ( fig .",
    "[ fig : torusmodel ] ) .",
    "finally , the relatively moderate strength of the silicate feature of the integrated @xmath63kpc central region ( @xmath64 , table  [ tab : spectroscopy ] ) of ngc  1365 m ir luminosity of this galaxy is @xmath65 using the iras flux densities from @xcite . ]",
    "is typical of the observed nuclear silicate strengths measured in other local lirgs @xcite and indicates an average visual extinction in this region of @xmath66mag .",
    "the herschel images can be used to trace the spatial variations of the temperature of the dust inside the ilr region of ngc  1365 .",
    "if we assume that the far - ir emission of a galaxy can be approximated with a modified blackbody , then in the case of optically thin emission the flux density can be expressed as    @xmath67    where @xmath68 is the blackbody function for a dust temperature of @xmath69 and @xmath21 is the dust emissivity . in the simplest approximation",
    "we can calculate the color temperature @xmath70 of the dust using the ratio of the surface brightness at two wavelengths with the following equation expressed in terms of wavelengths    @xmath71    we chose to construct a map of the pacs @xmath72 m to the pacs @xmath42 m ratio as these two wavelengths provide the best angular resolutions with herschel .",
    "we rebinned the pacs @xmath42 m image to the pixel size of the pacs @xmath72 m image .",
    "we matched the psf of the two images by smoothing the @xmath42 m with a gaussian function , although this may introduce some artifacts ( see e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "we then calculated the dust color temperature by solving equation  [ eq : colortemperature ] .",
    "we fixed the value of the dust emissivity @xmath73 , as it is found to fit well the integrated seds of local ir galaxies @xcite .",
    "the map of the pacs @xmath72 m to @xmath42 m ratio of the inner @xmath74 is shown in fig  [ fig : colortemperature ] .",
    "the observed range of @xmath75 in the central region translates into values of the dust color temperature of between @xmath76k and @xmath77k . within the ilr region of ngc  1365",
    "the highest @xmath78 color temperatures correspond to regions actively forming stars , that is , the regions containing the mid - ir star clusters and the l4 h@xmath50 hot spot .",
    "these bright star forming regions have color temperatures similar to , although slightly higher than , those of hii regions in the spiral arms .",
    "the regions with the coldest @xmath78 in the ilr region might be associated with some of the foreground dust features seen in the optical images ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : pacs100_large ] ) .",
    "finally , the region of the agn does not appear different in terms of the color temperature when compared to the bright star forming regions .",
    "this is probably because the agn is faint in the far - ir ( see next section ) coupled with the relatively coarse angular resolution of this map ( i.e. , that of the pacs @xmath72 m ) .      in this section",
    "we study the properties of the dust in the ilr region of ngc  1365 , particularly the dust heated by processes other than the agn .",
    "to do so , we first subtracted the agn emission ( see table  [ tab : agnfluxes ] ) from the observed fluxes in the spitzer / mips @xmath3 m band and all the herschel bands .",
    "we then fitted the observed non - agn mid- and far - ir sed using a combination of two modified blackbody following @xcite and @xcite :    @xmath79    where @xmath80 and @xmath81 are the relative masses of the warm and cold dust components and @xmath82 and @xmath83 are their temperatures .",
    "as done in section  [ sec : colortemperature ] , we fixed the dust emissivity @xmath84 and then used a standard @xmath85 minimization technique to fit the two dust temperatures and the relative masses of the two dust components . for the fit we used the fluxes measured through an @xmath38 aperture , and normalized them to that at @xmath72 m .",
    "for the spitzer / mips @xmath3 m flux density , we added in quadrature the photometric error and the uncertainty associated with subtracting the agn component at this wavelength to a total error budget of @xmath86 .",
    "for the herschel data points because the agn emission in the far - ir is very small compared to the total emission inside the ilr region , the dominant source of error is that associated with the photometric calibration of the data : @xmath87 .",
    "[ fig : sedfit ] shows the best fit to the agn - subtracted sed of the ilr region of ngc  1365 , which was obtained with @xmath88k and @xmath89k , and relative masses of cold to warm dust of @xmath90 .",
    "it is worth noting that the fit using two modified blackbodies is formally better than a fit to the far - ir data ( i.e. , excluding the @xmath3 m data point ) using a single modified blackbody .",
    "this can be explained because there is a non - negligible contribution from the warm dust component to the herschel pacs @xmath42 m flux density , as found for the integrated emission of other nearby galaxies ( see e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "however , the temperature of the warm component is not tightly constrained since varying the warm dust temperature by as much as @xmath91k produces statistically similar good fits ( @xmath92 ) .",
    "this is because the peak of this component at around @xmath93 m is not well sampled with the present data and the mass contribution of the warm component is small .",
    "the temperature of the cold component , on the other hand is well constrained . to get an estimate of the uncertainties on the fitted cold dust temperature , we changed it while fixing the temperature of the warm component . as can be seen from fig .",
    "[ fig : sedfit ] , cold dust temperatures in the range @xmath94k provide acceptable fits to the sed .",
    "previous works showed that the integrated mid - ir and far - ir seds of seyfert galaxies could be fitted with a combination of various dust temperatures probing different heating mechanisms .",
    "these include warm dust associated with the agn torus , cold dust similar to that observed in starburst galaxies , and very cold dust at temperatures characteristic of dust heated by the interstellar medium @xcite . with the superior angular resolution of the herschel observatory",
    "we can now obtain spatially resolved observations of nearby seyfert galaxies and star forming galaxies .",
    "the dust temperature of the ring of star formation in ngc  1365 is similar to that of other nuclear and circumnuclear starbursts with or without an agn with similar ir luminosities and physical sizes , for instance , the ring of ngc  3081 @xcite and the nuclear region of m83 @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the dust of mrk  938 , which is part of our survey of seyfert galaxies , has a considerably higher dust temperature of @xmath95k , probably due to the smaller size of the ir emitting region of this galaxy and higher ir luminosity @xcite .",
    "we calculated the dust mass ( @xmath96 ) within the ilr region of ngc  1365 using the following equation from @xcite ( adapted from * ? ? ?",
    "* ) :    @xmath97    where @xmath98 is the observed flux density , @xmath99 is the luminosity distance , @xmath100 is the blackbody emission for the best fitting dust temperatures , and @xmath101 is the dust absorption coefficient . as done by @xcite , we evaluated this expression at @xmath102 m using an absorption coefficient of @xmath103 , as interpolated from the dust model of @xcite .",
    "we derived a dust mass in the ilr region of @xmath104 , which accounts for approximately 25% of the total dust mass of this galaxy @xmath105 .",
    "the latter estimate is from @xcite but recalculated for the absorption coefficient used in this work .",
    "the ages and masses of the mid - ir clusters ( @xmath106myr and @xmath107 , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and the large amount of molecular gas available in the central regions of this galaxy @xcite indicate that there is intense on - going star formation activity there .",
    "we can use the ir observations of ngc  1365 to estimate the obscured sfr in the ilr region , and compare it with the unobscured sfr . as discussed by @xcite , a combination of the observed ( not corrected for extinction ) h@xmath50 luminosity and a mid - ir monochromatic luminosity ( preferably @xmath3 m ) will provide the best estimate of the total sfr in a moderately obscured environment ( see section  [ sec : silicatefeature ] ) , such as the ilr region of ngc  1365 .",
    "we note that this empirically calibrated recipe includes contributions from dust heating from all stars and not only the youngest ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* for a full discussion ) . using the h@xmath50 flux of @xcite for a 40-diameter aperture and our @xmath3 m flux ( after subtracting the agn component ) we estimated a total sfr within the ilr region ( inner @xmath108kpc , @xmath38 ) of ngc  1365 of sfr@xmath109 for a salpeter initial mass function ( imf ) .",
    "approximately 85% of this sfr is contributed by the @xmath3 m emission , and thus it originates from dust - obscured star forming regions .",
    "most of the ir emission in the ilr region comes from the star formation ring containing the bright mid - ir clusters identified by @xcite .",
    "indeed , we estimate that within the inner @xmath110 the total sfr is @xmath111 .",
    "this has been calculated using the agn - subtracted @xmath3 m flux density ( @xmath112 ) and the 24-diameter aperture h@xmath50 flux from @xcite .",
    "this corresponds to a sfr surface density in the ring of @xmath113 , for a ring radius of 900pc .",
    "this value of the sfr density is similar to those of other circumnuclear starbursts @xcite and is expected to be larger by factors of @xmath114 compared to the disk of the galaxy @xcite .",
    "in this paper we have studied the ir emission associated with the star formation activity in the ilr region of ngc  1365 , as well as the ir emission of the agn . to this end we have analyzed new far - ir ( @xmath0 m ) herschel / pacs and spire imaging , and high angular resolution ( @xmath115 ) gemini / t - recs mid - ir imaging and spectroscopy of this galaxy .",
    "we have also made use of archival spitzer / irac and mips imaging and irs spectral mapping data .",
    "our main findings for the inner @xmath116kpc region of ngc  1365 are :    * the new herschel pacs imaging data at 70 , 100 , and @xmath43 m reveal that the ring of star formation in the ilr region is bright in the far - ir .",
    "the agn is the brightest mid - ir source in the inner 2kpc up to @xmath117 m , but it becomes increasingly fainter in the far - ir when compared with the mid - ir clusters or groups of them in the ring . * the 24 and @xmath42 m emissions as well as the [ ne ii]@xmath4 m line and pah features trace the star - forming ring in the ilr region and have morphologies similar to the co `` twin - peaks '' .",
    "this all indicates that there is intense on - going star formation taking place in the inner few kpc of ngc  1365 . *",
    "the unresolved near and mid - ir nuclear emission and mid - ir spectrum ( i.e. , agn - dominated emission ) of ngc  1365 are well reproduced with a relatively compact torus ( outer radius of @xmath118pc ) with an opening angle of @xmath119deg , and an agn bolometric luminosity @xmath120 using the clumpy torus models .",
    "these parameters are in good agreement with independent estimates in the literature . * using the fitted torus model we quantified the agn emission in the far - ir .",
    "the agn only contributes at most 1% of the @xmath42 m emission within the inner 5.4kpc ( @xmath38 ) , and less than 1% at longer wavelengths . at @xmath3",
    "m the agn accounts for @xmath121 of the emission in the same region .",
    "we estimated that the agn bolometric contribution to the @xmath45 m luminosity in the inner 5.4kpc is approximately 5% .",
    "* the non - agn 24 to @xmath122 m sed of the ilr region ( inner 5.4kpc ) of ngc  1365 is well fitted with a combination of two modified blackbodies with warm and cold temperatures of 54k and 24k , respectively",
    ". however , the cold dust component accounts for most of total dust mass inferred in this region ( @xmath123 ) and has a temperature similar to that of other nuclear and circumnuclear starbursts of similar sizes and ir luminosities . * from the comparison between the sfr from h@xmath50 ( unobscured ) and the sfr from @xmath3 m ( obscured ) we infer that up to @xmath124 of the on - going sfr inside the ilr region of ngc  1365 is taking place in dust - obscured regions in the ring of star formation .",
