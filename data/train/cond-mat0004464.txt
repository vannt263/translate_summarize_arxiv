    "ferroelectric solid solutions with perovskite structure can exhibit properties which are much more interesting for technological applications than those of the related pure compounds .",
    "this is the case for the new class of single crystal relaxor ferroelectrics , exhibiting exceptionally high piezoelectric constants  @xcite .",
    "it is also true for ba@xmath0sr@xmath1tio@xmath2 ( bst ) , which combines a high dielectric constant with other properties making it a good candidate for the construction of dynamic random access memories ( dram )  @xcite .",
    "in contrast to barium titanate ( batio@xmath2 ) which is a prototype ferroelectric ( fe ) , strontium titanate ( srtio@xmath2 ) is an incipient ferroelectric which undergoes an antiferrodistortive ( afd ) phase transition at 105k  @xcite . due to the different behavior of the related pure compounds ,",
    "the structural properties of bst evolve with composition  @xcite .",
    "it exhibits a sequence of ferroelectric transitions similar to that of batio@xmath2 for ba concentrations ranging from 20 to 100% .",
    "close to pure srtio@xmath2 the behavior is complicated by the competition between fe and afd instabilities yielding the phase diagram reported in ref .",
    "@xcite .    in the past few years , first - principles effective hamiltonians sucessfully described the temperature - dependent behavior of various pure perovskite oxides  @xcite .",
    "the generalization of this theoretical approach to solid solutions is a new challenge which includes some additional complications to treat the alloy disorder accurately .",
    "a straightforward procedure is to try to extract the relevant information on the alloy from computation for various ordered supercells .",
    "this idea was applied to the study of pb@xmath0ge@xmath1te solid solutions  @xcite but has the inconvenience of being computationally intensive .",
    "an alternative and promising approach is based on the virtual crystal approximation ( vca ) which allows the retention of a crystal with the primitive periodicity but composed of virtual atomic potentials averaging those of the atoms in the parent compounds .",
    "a careful construction of the vca for pbzr@xmath0ti@xmath3o@xmath2 yielded a stress induced phase transition  @xcite and a compositional phase boundary  @xcite . going further",
    ", the construction of a model hamiltonian based on vca calculations for the same compound recently was used to describe most of its temperature - dependent properties  @xcite . in the latter case ,",
    "the vca calculation provided a reference structure to which corrections had to be added to treat the behavior of the real ions correctly .",
    "if the purpose of the vca is to define an average crystal from which the real solid solution can be described by including a restricted number of small corrections , one can ask if a similarly good estimate of the mixed compound could be obtained directly from the information available for the pure materials by averaging some _ key _ quantities .",
    "this idea is reinforced by the observation that the interatomic force constants seem very similar in the different abo@xmath2 compounds  @xcite .    in what follows",
    "we define an average crystal approximation ( aca ) by averaging the lattice constant ( @xmath4 ) , the born effective charges ( z@xmath5 ) , the optical dielectric tensor ( @xmath6 ) , and the interatomic force constants in real space ( ifc ) of the pure compounds .",
    "we compare our results to those obtained ( i ) within the vca and ( ii ) for a cubic ordered supercell with alternating planes of ba and sr along the ( 111 ) direction .",
    "we show that our aca yields an excellent approximation to the dielectric and dynamical properties of the mixed compound .",
    "it allows the prediction of the lattice dynamics in the full range of composition without requiring any first - principles calculations other than those for the related pure compounds .",
    "our calculations have been performed within the density functional theory  @xcite and the local density approximation , using the abinit package  @xcite .",
    "the ionic potentials screened by the core electrons have been replaced by highly transferable extended norm conserving pseudopotentials as proposed by m. teter  @xcite .",
    "the ba 5s , ba 5p , sr 4s , sr 4p , ti 3s , ti 3p , ti 3d , ti 4s , o 2s and o 2p electrons have been treated as valence states .",
    "the wavefunction has been expanded in plane waves up to a kinetic energy cutoff of 45 ha .",
    "the electronic exchange - correlation energy has been computed using a polynomial parametrization@xcite of ceperley alder data  @xcite .",
    "integrals over the simple cubic brillouin zone have been replaced by sums on a @xmath7 mesh of special @xmath8-points .",
    "a grid providing an equivalent sampling has been used for the supercell calculations .",
    "the born effective charges , the dielectric constants and the dynamical matrices have been computed within a variational formulation of the density functional perturbation theory  @xcite .",
    "the interatomic force constants in real space ( ifc ) and the phonon dispersion curves have been extracted following the scheme described in ref .",
    "@xcite , which deals correctly with the long range character of the dipolar interaction .",
    "the ifc were obtained from the knowledge of the dynamical matrix on a @xmath9 bcc mesh of @xmath10-points .",
    "the virtual crystal approximation is based on the construction of a fictitious `` virtual atom '' potential by averaging the ionic potentials of the atoms alternating at the same site of the structure . as illustrated recently by ramer and rappe  @xcite",
    ", there are different ways of combining non - local atomic pseudopotentials , each of them leading to different physical results .",
    "a careful choice seems necessary to predict accurately the alloy properties at the vca level .",
    "however , this choice could be less stringent if we think about the virtual crystal as a reference structure from which the real crystal can be obtained by including a limited number of relevant corrections .    for bst ,",
    "we choose therefore to stay with the most straightforward combination of the reference atomic pseudopotentials .",
    "the potential at the a - site can be formally defined for a concentration of @xmath11% of barium as : @xmath12= x v_{ba}^{ps } + ( 1-x ) v_{sr}^{ps}\\ ] ] where @xmath13 and @xmath14 are the pseudopotentials of ba and sr atoms .",
    "non - local pseudopotentials , such as those we are using , can be expressed as a sum of a local contribution and short - range non - local corrections : @xmath15 our virtual atom pseudopotential is then defined as follows  @xcite : @xmath16 \\delta(r - r ' ) \\nonumber\\\\ & + & \\sum_{l , m } \\sum_{q } \\frac { x v^{ps}_{ba , l } | \\phi^{ba}_{lm , q } > < \\phi^{ba}_{lm , q } | x v^{ps}_{ba , l } }        { < \\phi^{ba}_{lm , q } | x v^{ps}_{ba , l } | \\phi^{ba}_{lm , q } > }        \\nonumber \\\\ & + &   \\sum_{l , m } \\sum_{q } \\frac { ( 1-x ) v^{ps}_{sr , l } | \\phi^{sr}_{lm , q } > <",
    "\\phi^{sr}_{lm , q } | ( 1-x ) v^{ps}_{sr , l } }        { < \\phi^{sr}_{lm , q } | ( 1-x ) v^{ps}_{sr , l } | \\phi^{sr}_{lm , q } > } \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] for @xmath11 ranging from 0 to 1 , our virtual atom evolves smoothly from sr to ba .",
    "first we focus on the lattice constant of the cubic perovskite structure and look at its evolution with composition . in table  [ table - gs ] , we report the lda lattice constants for batio@xmath17 and srtio@xmath17 , for ba@xmath1sr@xmath18tio@xmath17 within the vca ( for x = 0.25 , 0.50 and 0.75 ) , and for the ( 111 ) ordered supercell .",
    "we compare the computed values with experimental results , which at intermediate compositions are accurately given by vegard s law  @xcite .",
    "while our results show the lattice constant underestimate typical of lda , the vegard s law behavior is well reproduced .",
    ".evolution of the lda optimized lattice constant ( bohr ) with composition .",
    "experimental values on the third line are interpolated from the data in the pure compounds using vegard s law . [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     in table  [ table - w ] , we compare the aca and vca phonon frequencies at @xmath19 and r in the reference perovskite structure to the related frequencies at the @xmath19 point in the ( 111 ) ordered supercell .",
    "the different symmetry of the supercell does not allow a one to one correspondence but the comparison is made between phonons having the highest eigenvector overlap .",
    "we note that the supercell eigenmode associated with the r@xmath20 modes of the perovskite structure , and involving displacement of the a atom , exhibits a small lo - to splitting .",
    "the overall agreement between aca , vca and supercell calculations is very good .",
    "this is particularly true for the @xmath21 and r@xmath22 modes related to the fe instability .",
    "there is a larger discrepancy for the r@xmath23 afd mode .",
    "we note however that projecting the supercell dynamical matrix within the subspace of the vca eigenvector yields a value of 125 @xmath24 ( instead of 86 @xmath24 ) closer to vca and aca results .",
    "this shows that the discrepancy originates in a change of the eigenvector rather than in a modification of the interatomic force constants .",
    "as the aca seems to give accurate results for the lattice dynamics of bst solid solutions , it offers an easy way to make a guess for the evolution of the fe and afd instabilities with composition .",
    "we observe in figure [ fig-2 ] that the square of the frequency of the r@xmath23 afd mode evolves linearly with composition and becomes unstable for ba concentrations smaller than 20 @xmath25 .",
    "this corresponds precisely to the composition for which a change of behavior is observed experimentally in the phase diagram of bst  @xcite .",
    "in contrast , the fe instability exhibits a non - linear behavior and remains unstable for the full range of composition .",
    "in this paper , we have compared different approaches for the study of the lattice dynamics of bst solid solutions and have introduced a new average crystal approximation .",
    "we have shown that the latter yields results equivalent to the vca but with the advantage that it does not require any additional first - principles calculations if the information for the related pure compounds is available .",
    "looking at the actual values of the ifc in the supercell could provide indications of the corrections to be included in the harmonic part of an effective hamiltonian based on the aca for the correct description of bst solid solutions .",
