    "we discuss in the following the dependence of the average fidelity on the dispersive coupling strength @xmath8 , the probe beam amplitude @xmath9 , the feedback strength @xmath10 , and the measurement efficiency @xmath11 .",
    "the black - circle solid line in fig .  [ fig : fine ] is the average fidelity @xmath166 versus the dispersive coupling strength @xmath8 for the probe field @xmath145 , the feedback strength @xmath168 , and the decay rate of the qubits @xmath186 .",
    "the dependence of the fidelity on @xmath8 is similar to the red - dashed curve which represents the separation between the measurement output signal @xmath187 that corresponds to the qubits state being in @xmath6 and the output signal that corresponds to the qubits state of @xmath101 .",
    "this is because larger separation means better state distinguishibility and thus helps the conditional qubits state estimation in the quantum feedback control scheme .",
    "one can observe that @xmath6 and @xmath101 become indistinguishable from the measurement current around the point @xmath188 , and thus the fidelity drops sharply around there as well .",
    "one can also notice from fig .",
    "[ fig : fine ] that the separation reaches maximum values at @xmath136 and @xmath135 , but the fidelity is higher at @xmath136 .",
    "this is because the collective damping rate @xmath133 of the purcell effect of the third term in eq .",
    "( [ eq : ms ] ) increases with the values of @xmath8 .",
    "for example , for @xmath146 , the purcell collective damping rate of @xmath189 at @xmath135 is larger than the individual qubit decay rate , set to be @xmath186 here , while the purcell collective damping rate of @xmath190 at @xmath136 is much smaller than @xmath191 and thus does not play an important role . as a result ,",
    "the average fidelity is lower for the case of a higher @xmath8 value when the corresponding separation of the measurement outcomes is the same .",
    "another observation from fig .",
    "[ fig : fine ] is that the average fidelity does not change with the dispersive coupling strength @xmath8 as sharply as the separation of the measurement outcomes does .",
    "when the separation of the measurement outcomes above a certain value ( about @xmath192 for the parameters chosen here ) , the average fidelity does not vary much [ see the behaviors of the separation of the measurement outcomes and the average fidelity around @xmath136 , where the purcell effect is not significant as compared to the individual qubits decay ] .",
    "this may also explain why the average fidelity at @xmath137 is larger than that at @xmath135 .",
    "the purcell collective damping rate of @xmath193 at @xmath137 , which is smaller than the individual qubit decay rate @xmath186 , is smaller than that of @xmath189 at @xmath135 .",
    "although the separation of the measurement outcomes at @xmath137 is also smaller there , its value is larger than @xmath192 . as a result , the average fidelity at @xmath137 is larger than that at @xmath135 .",
    "we perform most of our simulations choosing @xmath136 and/or @xmath137 .",
    "the dependence of average fidelity on the measurement drive amplitude @xmath9 is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fine ] . since the information gain rates [ c.f .",
    "( [ eq : rate0 ] ) and ( [ eq : rate1 ] ) ] is proportional to @xmath194 , the bigger the value @xmath9 is , the larger the separation between measurement outcomes is and the quicker the conditional state collapse to one of the joint measurement operator eigenstates is . it is thus expected the average fidelity will also become better as @xmath9 increases as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fine ] .",
    "one may be temped to think that the arbitrarily quick readout or arbitrarily high fidelity can be achieved by simply increasing @xmath9 .",
    "but it was pointed out @xcite that the lowest - order dispersive approximation of hamiltonian eq .",
    "( [ eq : effhamiltonian ] ) become accurate when the average photon number in the cavity is much smaller than the critical photon number of @xmath195 .",
    "the number of photon is proportional to @xmath196 .",
    "this puts a limit on how large the external drive @xmath9 could be for eq .",
    "( [ eq : effhamiltonian ] ) to hold valid .",
    "in addition , note that the time - dependent second term @xmath197 in the first commutator of eq .",
    "( [ eq : me ] ) also increases with @xmath9 . this term in the hamiltonian , in addition to qubit decay channel ,",
    "will cause the qubits to flip or change their state during the process when the continuous measurement tries to localize the qubits to one of the joint measurement operator eigenstates .",
    "however , the value of @xmath198 we choose is small and for typical value of @xmath9 , the coefficient @xmath199 of this term is much smaller than the frequency @xmath200 ( as we have set @xmath73 ) of the oscillating factors .",
    "thus the effect of this term to mix different measurement eigenstates is small .",
    "we choose @xmath145 for most of the simulations presented in this paper although increasing @xmath9 further will improve the fidelity a little bit .",
    "figure [ fig : fine ] shows that increasing the feedback control strength improves the average fidelity in general .",
    "suppose a measurement outcome indicating deviation from the desired @xmath6 state happens , the applied feedback control has to overcome the effect of the localization due to the continuous measurement in order to move the qubits back to the target @xmath6 state .",
    "when the feedback control strength is smaller , the procedure to produce and stabilize the @xmath6 state takes a longer time with a lower fidelity .",
    "the qubits decay rates in fig .  [ fig : fine ] are chosen to be @xmath169 .",
    "when the feedback control strength is @xmath168 , the fidelity reaches the value of @xmath177 .",
    "further increase of the feedback control strength , i.e. , @xmath201 , does not improve appreciably the fidelity .",
    "this indicates that if deviation occurs , the correction of the feedback control at @xmath168 is fast enough to kick the qubits back to the @xmath6 state .",
    "we thus choose @xmath168 for most of our numerical simulations .    in practice",
    ", there exists inefficiency in the measurements which arises when the detectors sometimes miss detection or the measurement microwave photons does not go to the detectors due to lost . however , high measurement efficiency is not very essential for our feedback control scheme .",
    "although the fidelity decreases as the value of the measurement efficiency @xmath11 decreases as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fine ] , the fidelity is still above @xmath1 for @xmath11 as low as @xmath202 for the case of @xmath136 and qubits decay rates @xmath169 .",
    "the value of @xmath38 implies appearance of an additional non - unraveling dephasing term in the quantum trajectory ( stochastic master ) equation @xcite .",
    "however , this term causes dephasing only among @xmath143 , @xmath144 , @xmath6 and @xmath101 for the initial qubits states chosen in our simulations . as a result , it affects only the detailed dynamics of the qubits but does not destroy or prevent the controlled evolution toward the target entangled state @xmath6 .",
    "therefore , our feedback control scheme to generate and stabilize the @xmath6 state does not require high measurement efficiency and thus can be implemented experimentally with high fidelity with measurement efficiency available in current circuit qed experiments that use parametric amplification before the homodyne detection with an iq mixer @xcite .",

    "the average fidelity is determined roughly by the average decay rate in each set as the behavior of the fidelity in each set is similar to that when the decay rates of the three qubits were equal to the average decay rate .",
    "the average fidelities of the @xmath6 state generated initially from the ground state @xmath173 with feedback control strength @xmath168 outperform those evolving from an initial @xmath6 state without feedback control ( @xmath204 ) after time @xmath206 .",
    "another commonly used procedure to eliminate the cavity field is the adiabatic elimination method .",

    "( [ eq : coherent ] ) is ignored and the tlr cavity field reaches its steady coherent state rapidly with an amplitude equal to @xmath211 . as a consequence , the coherent state amplitude is assumed to be the same for all the qubits basis states .",

    "[ fig:1 ] is not really valid .    for the adoptive feedback control by state estimation method , it is important to use the correct conditional stochastic master equation to estimate the system state conditioned on the measured current .",

    "although the couplings @xmath233 of the qubits to the cavity field may , in a realistic experiment , not be the same , one is able to tune , due to their great tunability , the qubit transition frequencies to be pretty much the same by external voltages or magnetic fields . in other words ,",
    "experimentally the detuning @xmath234 for all the qubits can be tuned to be equal while the dispersive coupling strengths @xmath235 are left slightly different .",

    "<S> circuit cavity quantum electrodynamics ( qed ) is proving to be a powerful platform to implement quantum feedback control schemes due to the ability to control superconducting qubits and microwaves in a circuit . here </S>",
    "<S> , we present a simple and promising quantum feedback control scheme for deterministic generation and stabilization of a three - qubit @xmath0 state in the superconducting circuit qed system . </S>",
    "<S> the control scheme is based on continuous joint zeno measurements of multiple qubits in a dispersive regime , which enables us not only to infer the state of the qubits for further information processing but also to create and stabilize the target @xmath0 state through adaptive quantum feedback control . </S>",
    "<S> we simulate the dynamics of the proposed quantum feedback control scheme using the quantum trajectory approach with an effective stochastic maser equation obtained by a polaron - type transformation method and demonstrate that in the presence of moderate environmental decoherence , the average state fidelity higher than @xmath1 can be achieved and maintained for a considerable long time ( much longer than the single - qubit decoherence time ) . </S>",
    "<S> this control scheme is also shown to be robust against measurement inefficiency and individual qubit decay rate differences . </S>",
    "<S> finally , the comparison of the polaron - type transformation method to the commonly used adiabatic elimination method to eliminate the cavity mode is presented . </S>"
