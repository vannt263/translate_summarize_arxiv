    "<S> we use the effective lagrangian formalism to describe quark mixing . the new @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 couplings generalizing the ckm matrix and the gim mechanism fulfil relations and inequalities which allow to discriminate among different sm extensions . as a by - product </S>",
    "<S> we give a useful parametrization of the generalized ckm matrix . </S>",
    "<S> we also show that the largest possible departures from the sm predictions result from heavy exotic fermions , which can induce , for example , top fcnc large enough to be observable at future colliders .    ,    quark masses and sm parameters , beyond the standard model . : 12.15.ff , 12.15.-y , 12.60.-i    the mixing of fermions with the same quantum numbers provides a very sensitive window to new physics . </S>",
    "<S> two distinguished examples are the prediction of the existence of the charm quark by glashow , iliopoulos and maiani ( gim )  @xcite from the absence of flavour changing neutral currents ( fcnc ) , and the recent results on neutrino oscillations indicating a non - zero mass for the neutrinos . here </S>",
    "<S> we are interested in the quark sector . </S>",
    "<S> the standard model ( sm ) predicts a definite pattern of quark mixing : fcnc are absent at tree level and suppressed at one loop , the mixing in charged currents is given by the unitary cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa ( ckm ) matrix  @xcite and the source of all cp violation is the unique phase in this matrix . </S>",
    "<S> the fact that some of the ckm matrix elements , especially the ones involving the top , are poorly known at present , implies that the unitarity of the @xmath3 ckm matrix has yet to be tested . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , little is known so far about possible fcnc for the top . </S>",
    "<S> fortunately the situation is expected to improve in the near future . </S>",
    "<S> many ongoing and future experiments ( tevatron , b factories , lhc ) will be able to test the unitarity triangle  @xcite and to measure top couplings to within @xmath4 of the typical size of a weak coupling , thus improving present bounds by more than one order of magnitude  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the usual procedure to analyse these experiments is to assume the sm and determine the corresponding parameters from the measurements . </S>",
    "<S> new physics would then manifest itself as inconsistencies arising from the fact that the experiments overconstrain this parametrisation . </S>",
    "<S> for instance , the non - closure of the unitarity triangle would directly indicate non - standard physics . </S>",
    "<S> obviously , this method is insufficient to learn about the new physics if a new effect is found . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , a nave use of the sm ansatz can be misleading when interpreting results hinting a closed unitarity triangle . in order to analyse and </S>",
    "<S> discuss new physics it seems more convenient to work with a more general parametrisation from the very beginning . </S>",
    "<S> a convenient one should reflect which parameters are small and vanish in the sm limit . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , one would like to know what relations between neutral and charged currents can be imposed and what bounds should be expected on general grounds ( symmetry , dimensional analysis , etc . ) . </S>",
    "<S> all these issues can be best dealt with using effective theory techniques , and this is what we do in this paper . </S>",
    "<S> we also argue that only models with extra vector - like quarks can give large new effects beyond the sm .    </S>",
    "<S> the sm should be understood as the lowest dimension part in the expansion of an effective lagrangian that describes any physics below a certain scale @xmath5 ( see ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite and references there in ) . </S>",
    "<S> this effective lagrangian can describe a large class of sm extensions , including models with extra gauge interactions , new vector bosons , fermions or scalars with or without supersymmetry , and in four or higher dimensions  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath5 is a characteristic scale of the high energy theory , typically given by the lowest thresholds of the non - standard particles . </S>",
    "<S> an effective lagrangian can describe both decoupling and non - decoupling non - standard physics ( in the second case the effective description is mandatory ) . here </S>",
    "<S> we shall assume that the low energy scalar sector is given by an elementary ( not too heavy ) higgs and therefore work in a decoupling scenario . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , it is sufficient to consider only the sm higgs for the following reasons : scalar singlets which can acquire a vacuum expectation value ( vev ) do not transform under the sm and are then flavour blind . </S>",
    "<S> other multiplets like triplets can only get very small vevs @xmath6 ( due to the constraints on the @xmath7 parameter ) and their effects are suppressed by powers of @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is the sm vev . </S>",
    "<S> finally , for any number of higgs doublets we identify the minimal sm one with the combination getting a vev .    </S>",
    "<S> the experimental precision and the scale @xmath5 determine the order to be considered in the expansion @xmath10 @xmath11 is the sm lagrangian and @xmath12 contain operators @xmath13 of dimension 5 , 6,@xmath14 , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> all these operators are invariant under the gauge group @xmath15 . </S>",
    "<S> there is an extensive literature on the operators in @xmath16 and @xmath17 and on their experimental constraints . in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite it is shown that , assuming lepton and baryon number conservation , no dimension 5 operator can be constructed with the sm fields , while there are 81 independent gauge invariant operators of dimension 6 ( up to flavour indices ) included in @xmath18 the coefficients @xmath19 parametrise the new physics beyond the sm . </S>",
    "<S> other operators are allowed , but can be transformed into the ones in  @xcite by using the equations of motion of @xmath11 . </S>",
    "<S> this does not change s matrix elements to order @xmath20  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it should be noted that the lagrangian @xmath21 can be used beyond the classical level . </S>",
    "<S> quantum corrections can be computed systematically as @xmath21 is renormalizable in the modern sense that there is a counterterm available to cancel every infinity  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> a good and consistent approximation is to consider the full one - loop corrections to @xmath11 , but work at tree level whenever an operator in @xmath17 is inserted . </S>",
    "<S> the effect of the sm radiative corrections should be taken into account when applying our results to precision data .    in order to compare with experiment </S>",
    "<S> we have to consider the spontaneous symmetry breaking ( ssb ) of the electroweak gauge symmetry , which introduces a new dimensionful parameter : the electroweak vev @xmath22 . </S>",
    "<S> then @xmath17 gives contributions @xmath23 , @xmath24 and @xmath25 , where @xmath26 contains operators of dimension @xmath27 invariant under the unbroken @xmath28 gauge symmetry . </S>",
    "<S> quark mixing can occur in two - fermion and four - fermion operators . </S>",
    "<S> the latter have dimension 6 and the former ( after ssb ) , dimension 4 , 5 and 6 . </S>",
    "<S> operators with the same fields but with a different dimension after ssb can in principle be distinguished experimentally , since they lead to a different momentum dependence . </S>",
    "<S> four - fermion operators can give non - standard mixing in kaon or b meson experiments , quark - pair production , etc . </S>",
    "<S> they are generated in many extensions of the sm . here , however , we shall concentrate on the trilinear couplings @xmath29 , and @xmath30 , which generalize the ckm matrix and the diagonal couplings in neutral currents . </S>",
    "<S> these vertices can be measured independently and may have a different origin than the four - fermion operators .    </S>",
    "<S> the operators @xmath31 are generated by virtual exchange of the heavy modes in the high - energy theory . </S>",
    "<S> it is useful to distinguish the operators which are generated at tree level from those which are generated only by loop diagrams  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the latter are suppressed by powers of @xmath32 , at least when the heavy theory is weakly interacting . </S>",
    "<S> we can then consider only operators generated at tree level , since we are mainly interested in the largest sm deviations , which might be observed within the precision of future experiments . </S>",
    "<S> this restriction reduces the list of operators relevant to trilinear couplings to the seven operators collected in table  [ operators ] . </S>",
    "<S> these operators give only , after ssb , dimension 4 ( i.e. , @xmath33 ) operators and operators of dimension 5 of the form @xmath34 . </S>",
    "<S> hence , magnetic - moment type operators and other operators with extra momentum dependence are not generated at tree level . </S>",
    "<S> on the other hand , it is important to observe that these seven operators are the only ones contributing to the quark sector of @xmath35  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , even though we are mainly concerned with large effects in the top couplings , all the results in this paper for the couplings @xmath36 , @xmath30 apply to any kind of new physics , independently of whether it contributes at tree level or not . </S>",
    "<S> there are also other operators which would redefine the @xmath1 , @xmath0 and @xmath2 fields in the trilinear quark couplings , but they are flavour blind and need not be taken into account for our purposes . </S>",
    "<S> no flavour change occurs in the dimension 4 couplings to the photon and gluons due to the exact @xmath37 and @xmath38 symmetry .    </S>",
    "<S> [ cols= \" < , < \" , ]     in the following we extend the analysis of ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite to describe quark mixing . </S>",
    "<S> we generalize the ckm matrix and the gim mechanism , and find relations and bounds fulfilled by the trilinear couplings . as an illustration of how the general description can be employed to study particular models , we discuss a simple extension of the sm with an extra exotic up quark isosinglet @xmath39  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this example also shows that a top mixing large enough to be observable at future colliders can actually be produced in explicit models  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we argue that the largest possible departure from the sm is obtained in models with heavy vector - like fermions . </S>",
    "<S> these models are analised in a subsequent paper  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the seven operators in table  [ operators ] , together with eqs . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ lag:456 ] ) and ( [ lag:6 ] ) , describe the large contributions of an arbitrary sm extension to the trilinear quark couplings , and any contribution ( large or small ) to non - derivative trilinear quark couplings . </S>",
    "<S> note that the actual value of the coefficients @xmath19 depends on the specific basis one uses for the quark fields , which is not completely fixed by the requirement of canonical kinetic terms and diagonal gauge terms before ssb . </S>",
    "<S> the physical results are independent of the choice of basis , but for definiteness we shall use here the basis in which the sm yukawa couplings of the down quarks are diagonal , real and positive and the sm yukawa couplings of the up quarks are of the form @xmath40 with @xmath41 real and positive and @xmath42 unitary ( and identical to the ckm matrix in the sm ) . </S>",
    "<S> after ssb , the quark mass matrices to order @xmath43 can be made diagonal , real and positive by biunitary transformations @xmath44 , @xmath45 , where the prime is used for mass eigenstates . </S>",
    "<S> we omit it in the following , for all the subsequent expressions are written in the mass eigenstate basis . up to the freedom to redefine the phases of the quark mass eigenstates , </S>",
