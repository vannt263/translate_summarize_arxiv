    "x - ray flashes ( xrfs ) are generally thought to be a sub - class of gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) . the main difference between xrfs and grbs is the energy of the emission ; the peak energy @xmath0 of xrfs is distributed in the range from a few kev to 10@xmath120 kev while the one of grbs is distributed from @xmath220 kev to @xmath2mev ( barraud et al .",

    "the spectral softness could be explained if xrf 040916 were a high - redshift grb . to check this hypothesis , we first estimated the redshift from the amati relation ( amati et al .",

    "we calculated @xmath24 and @xmath23 from the spectral parameters of the 1st peak assuming various redshifts .",
    "as shown in figure [ fig : amati ] , the smaller the redshift is , the more consistent the computed values are with the amati relation .",
    "this result is also consistent with the subaru redshift constraint of @xmath28 , imposed by its detection of the optical afterglow in the b - band(kosugi et al .",
    "2004 )    we have also computed an upper limit to the pseudo - redshift ( with the method described in plangeon et al . 2006 ) using the wxm spectrum for the most intense 15s long part of the 1st peak . to do this",
    ", we derived the upper limit to @xmath0 using the constrained band model to fit the data .",
    "we find that @xmath0 @xmath29 6.2 kev with 90% confidence , leading to a pseudo - redshift @xmath29 0.7 , consistent with the preceding results .",

    "( 88mm,45mm)amati_1stpeak.eps ( 88mm,45mm)amati_1st+2nd.eps      in the spectral analysis , we could not determine @xmath0 for the 2nd peak , but we found that above 10 kev the best fitting model was a power - law , and that @xmath0 lay in the low energy region ( @xmath294kev ) .",
    "furthermore , the 1st and 2nd peaks are separated by @xmath2 200 s. this suggests that the 2nd peak could be the x - ray afterglow rather than prompt emission .",
    "indeed there are at least five possibilities to explain it .",
    "( 1 ) beginning of the afterglow ( 2 ) ambient density fluctuations of the x - ray afterglow , ( 3 ) patchy shell , ( 4 ) refreshed shock and ( 5 ) long - acting engine model ( ioka et al .",
    "we consider them in the following sections .",
    "+      piro et al .",
    "( 2005 ) said that grb 011121 and grb 011211 showed a late x - ray burst taking place a few hundreds of seconds after the prompt emission .",
    "the spectral and temporal evolution of the afterglow indicated that fireball evolution took place in the interstellar medium for grb 011211 and in the wind for grb 011121 respectively . in both cases ,",
    "the decay time of a late x - ray burst ( i.e. afterglow ) is supposed to be proportional to @xmath30 ( sari et al .",
    "1998 ) .",
    "if we set the zero time ( @xmath31 ) of the emission episode for the 1st peak , then the decay time of the 2nd peak is proportional to @xmath32 in 2@xmath125 kev energy band .",
    "since this result is inconsistent with the above afterglow model , we can reject the possibility of the beginning of the afterglow .",
    "+      this model explains afterglow variabilities by ambient density fluctuations caused by turbulence in the interstellar medium or variable winds from the progenitor star .",
    "if xrf 040916 was in the afterglow stage when the 2nd peak occurred , we can use the following formula for a kinematical upper limit on the variability ( ioka et al . 2005 ) @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the variability timescale , @xmath35 is the observed time since the burst , @xmath36 is the assumed power - law baseline of the afterglow flux , @xmath37 is the bolometric base flux , @xmath38 @xmath2 ( @xmath39/@xmath40)@xmath41 where the cooling frequency is @xmath40 , the characteristic synchrotron frequency is @xmath39 , and the electron power - law distribution index is @xmath42 , @xmath43 @xmath2 ( @xmath44/@xmath40)@xmath41 , and @xmath34 , @xmath45 are the timescale and amplitude deviations above the baseline , respectively .",
    "this formula gives the maximum possible afterglow variability due to ambient density fluctuations .",
    "we can estimate the factor @xmath43 assuming the standard afterglow model for @xmath46 ( the x - ray band at @xmath47 370s ) . since @xmath40 @xmath2 10@xmath48 hz at t @xmath2 370s for @xmath42 @xmath2 2.2 ( sari et al . 1998 )",
    ", we have @xmath43 @xmath2 1 for the x - ray band ( @xmath44 @xmath2 10@xmath49 hz ) .",
    "furthermore , substituting @xmath50 60 s in equation [ eq : ioka ] , the right - hand side becomes @xmath2 0.1 .",
    "but we can clearly see that @xmath51 @xmath52 1 from the flux variabilities in figure [ fig : thx ] , because the flux @xmath53 in the region between the 1st and 2nd peaks ( @xmath29 1.8 @xmath54 10@xmath55 ergs @xmath56 s@xmath57 with 2@xmath58 confidence level , 2@xmath1400 kev ) which is assumed to be the afterglow stage , is less than the flux of the 2nd peak ( 8.3 @xmath54 10@xmath55 ergs @xmath56 s@xmath57 , 2@xmath1400 kev ) by a factor of more than 5 with 2@xmath58 confidence level . since the observed variability exceeds the maximum allowed value , ambient density fluctuations can not explain the nature of the 2nd peak .",
    "+      in the patchy shell model the variability timescale of the afterglow at time @xmath35 must be @xmath34 @xmath59 @xmath35 ( nakar & oren 2004 ) . in this model ,",
    "the grb jet consists of many subjets ( yamazaki et al . 2004 ; ioka & nakamura 2001 ) . since we observe an angular size @xmath60 within a grb jet with lorentz factor @xmath61 , the flux depends on the angular structure for the observer .",
    "the patchy shell model can not make a bump with variability timescale @xmath62 60 s , which is shorter than the observed timescale @xmath63 370 s , so we can marginally reject this model from the point of view of the variability timescale .",
    "in addition , the flux of the 2nd peak is as bright as that of the 1st one .",
    "if this burst is explained by the patchy shell model , we must assume very large shell non - uniformity .",
    "in this case , we have to assume that we first observe the dark part of the shell , and then the bright part of the shell as the lorentz factor drops . as",
    "the assumption of a large non - uniformity shell is unrealistic , we can consequently exclude the patchy model .",
    "+      in this model , multiple shells are ejected at various velocities , and the variability occurs when the slow inner shell catches up with the fast outer shell a long time later , since the velocity of the outer shell decreases through the interaction with the ambient medium ( rees & mszros 1998 ; panaitescu et al .",
    "1998 ; kumar & piran 2000 ; sari & mszros 2000 ; zhang & mszros 2002 ) . the variability timescale at time @xmath35",
    "is given by @xmath64 @xmath35 @xmath59 @xmath35/4 ( ioka et al . 2005 ) .",
    "in the case of xrf 040916 , however , the variability timescale is @xmath64 @xmath35 @xmath65 @xmath35/4 for @xmath35 @xmath2 370 s and @xmath34 @xmath2 60 s , so we can marginally reject the refreshed shock model .",
    "in addition , the flux variability will not be equal to the grb flux .",
    "the relation between the energy increase factor @xmath37 and the flux increase @xmath66 is given by @xmath67 for @xmath68 , and @xmath69 for @xmath70 ( granot et al .",
    "2003 ) . in either case ,",
    "@xmath71 with typical values of @xmath72 2.2 . because @xmath73 from the observation , we must have @xmath74 .",
    "this means that the slow shells have very large energy , which contradicts the refreshed shock model ( refreshed shocks produce changes of less than 1 order of magnitude ) . therefore this model , too , can be rejected .",
    "+      in this model , at the observed time @xmath35 , the central engine is still active and emitting shells ( rees & meszaros 2000 ; zhang & meszaros 2002 ; dai & lu 1998 ) .",
    "this can explain variability timescales down to a millisecond and there is no restriction on the flux variability .",
    "the most likely explanation of the 2nd peak is therefore the long - acting engine model .",
    "only this model can explain both the variability timescale and the flux variability for the 2nd peak .",
    "in this scenario , both the 1st and 2nd peaks have the same mechanism , and both must show the same spectral and temporal features as grbs . as we have shown in section [ sec : temporal ] , the timescale of the 2nd peak in table [ tab : temporal_tot ] is shorter at higher energies , which is a typical feature of grbs .",
    "furthermore , we considered the curvature effect ( kumar & panaitescu 2000 ; liang et al .",
    "this effect is the rapid decay due to the observed receiving the progressively delayed emission from higher latitudes .",
    "the following formula represents the curvature effect , @xmath75 where @xmath76 is the x - ray photon index during the decay , @xmath31 is the time zero point of the emission episode related to decay and @xmath77 is normalization parameter for decay component .",
    "we applied this effect to the 2nd peak .",
    "because of the poor statistics in the 2nd peak , we used the x - ray photon index ( @xmath76 = 1.9 ) during the entire 2nd peak ( rise and decay ) with the background subtracted in the region ( 2 ) . from fitting analysis",
    ", we obtained @xmath31 = -34.8 @xmath78 34.9 s , near the time zero point for the 2nd peak .",
    "this result implies that the zero time for the 1st peak does nt coincide with the 2nd peak one : then the central engine was reactivated .    and",
    "as we showed in section [ sec : spectrum ] , the spectrum of the 2nd peak is probably softer than that of the 1st .",
    "thus @xmath0 appears to decrease with time and flux , in accord with the well known hard - to - soft evolution in grb spectra ( fishman & meegan 1995 ) .",
    "this feature is also consistent with the long - acting engine model , and we consider it to be the most reasonable mechanism to explain the soft 2nd peak of xrf 040916 .",
    "furthermore , we can compare this event with the swift bursts xrf 050406 and grb 050502b .",
    "swift ( gehrels et al . 2004 ) can detect early x - ray afterglows with the x - ray telescope ( xrt ; burrows et al .",
    "2005a ) and it has detected bright x - ray flares 100@xmath11000 seconds after the prompt emission for these bursts .",
    "they have been explained by the long - acting engine model ( burrows et al .",
    "2005b , romano et al .",
    "2006 , falcone et al .",
    "2006 ) . because the xrt is only sensitive to photons in the 0.2@xmath110 kev energy range ,",
    "the spectral features of the x - ray flares are not as well resolved as those of the prompt emission , and their emission mechanism is still under discussion . in grb 011211 ( jakobsson et al .",
    "2004 ; holland et al . 2002 ; piro et al .",
    "2005 ) , grb 011121 ( piro et al .",
    "2005 ) and grb 021004 ( bersier et al .",
    "2003 ; halpern et al .",
    "2002 ) the afterglows included x - ray flares , whose study revealed a wealth of information about the central engine and its surrounding regions . for xrf 050406 ,",
    "the bright flare occurred @xmath2200 s after the prompt emission , and for grb 050502b , it occurred @xmath2700 s later .",
    "the hard to soft count rate ratios for the flares was similar to the spectral evolution of the prompt grb emission .",
    "as the time interval of xrf 040916 is also of the order of @xmath2200 s and the emission of the 1st peak is harder than that of the 2nd according to the @xmath79 $ ] ratio , the timescale and the spectral evolution between the peaks for xrf 040916 is similar to those of xrf 050406 and grb 050502b , and can be explained by the long - acting engine model .",
    "in this paper we have reported the _ hete-2 _",
    "wxm / fregate observations of the xrf 040916 , which consists of two peaks separated by @xmath2200 s. for this burst , only an upper limit to the redshift has been reported based on optical observations ( @xmath80 ) .",
    "taking into account this limit , our estimate from the amati relation is consistent with a small redshift . in terms of the spectral evolution",
    ", it seems that the 2nd peak is softer than the 1st peak .",
    "we have studied the emission mechanism of the 2nd peak and discussed its most probable origin . considering different models",
    "( beginning of the afterglow , ambient density fluctuations , patchy shell , and refreshed shock model ) , we found that the long - acting engine model is the most plausible one to explain both the timescale and flux variabilities . in some grbs or xrfs ( e.g. grb050502b and xrf 050406 ) ( burrows et al .",
    "2005b ) , bright x - ray flares were observed and these bursts are also explained by the long - acting engine model .",
    "consequently , our results indicate that the case of xrf 040916 is similar to those of the x - ray flares detected by swift .",
