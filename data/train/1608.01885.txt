    "international efforts are on going to make it possible to replace the definition of the unit of mass by a new one based on a conventional value of the planck constant , @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "since the ratio between the mass of the @xmath1 isotope and @xmath0 is well known , a way to put into practice such a definition is by counting the number of atoms in a 1 kg silicon sphere highly enriched with @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "the count is carried out by dividing the molar volume , @xmath2 , where the symbols indicate the volume , molar mass , and mass of the sphere , by the volume occupied by one atom , @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is the lattice parameter .",
    "the uncertainty associated to the presently most accurate determination is about @xmath5 @xcite . in order to achieve this accuracy ,",
    "the lattice parameter is measured by combined x - ray and optical interferometry to within a @xmath6 uncertainty .",
    "relaxation , reconstruction , and oxidation cause surface stresses without the application of any external force .",
    "experimental evidences of surface stress effects on silicon nanostructures have been already reported @xcite .",
    "this has a twofold effect on the @xmath7 measurement .",
    "firstly , it makes the measured volume different from the volume of an unstressed sphere .",
    "density - functional theory calculations showed that this effect is an order of magnitude smaller than the present uncertainty of the volume measurements .",
    "therefore , it can be neglected @xcite .",
    "secondly , it makes the lattice parameter of an x - ray interferometer different from that of a sphere .",
    "the lattice parameter measurement assumes that the silicon crystal is strain free ( undeformed configuration ) .",
    "although the surface stress can be ignored on the macroscopic scale , it might be important for this extremely accurate measurement . to estimate the lattice - parameter change caused by the surface stress ,",
    "a finite element analysis was carried out , where an elastic film was used to provide a surface load @xcite .",
    "a 1 n / m stress of the elastic film was postulated , but this nominal value was not supported by evidences .",
    "this paper aims to fill this gap by focusing on density functional theory calculations in order to better quantify the surface stress .",
    "calculations were carried out by using the quantum espresso computer package @xcite .    in section 2",
    "we describe the operation of an x - ray interferometer .",
    "section 3 outlines the way the surface stress was calculated .",
    "next , in section 4 , we give the results of the numerical computations for the oxidised ( 110 ) surfaces of the interferometer crystals .",
    "en passant , this study delivered information about the structure of the sio@xmath8-si interface , that was not considered in our previous investigation @xcite .",
    "the calculated stress is greater than expected and its effect on the lattice parameter measurement should have been noticed , but it seems it is not so .",
    "possible explanations and the implications of this result are discussed in section 5 .",
    "as shown in fig .  [ xroi ] , an x - ray interferometer consists of three crystals  1.2 mm thick , 50 mm long , and 20 mm high ",
    "so cut that the @xmath9 planes are orthogonal to the crystal ( 110 ) surfaces .",
    "17 kev x - rays from a mo k@xmath10 line source are split by the first crystal and recombined , via a transmission crystal , by the third , called analyser .    when the analyser is moved along a direction orthogonal to the @xmath9 diffracting planes , a periodic variation of the transmitted and diffracted x - ray intensities is observed , the period being the diffracting - plane spacing .",
    "the analyser displacement and rotations are measured by optical interferometry ; picometer and nanoradian resolutions are achieved by phase modulation , polarization encoding , and quadrant detection of the fringe phase . to eliminate the adverse influence of the refractive index of air and to ensure millikelvin temperature uniformity and stability ,",
    "the interferometer is hosted in a thermo - vacuum chamber .",
    "the measurement equation is @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is the spacing of the @xmath9 planes and @xmath13 is the number of x - ray fringes in a displacement of @xmath14 optical fringes having period @xmath15 .",
    "the crystal temperature is simultaneously measured with sub - millikelvin sensitivity and accuracy so that the measured value is extrapolated to 20 @xmath16c .",
    "the most accurate determinations , @xmath17 am and @xmath18 am have relative uncertainty of @xmath19 and @xmath20 , respectively @xcite .",
    "the stress of the analyzer ( 110 ) surfaces might strain the crystal , thus making the measured @xmath12 value different from what it was set out to measure .",
    "this problem was investigated by quagliotti _",
    "_ @xcite by using an elastic - film model to provide a surface load in a finite - element analysis .",
    "this study showed that , if the film tensile - stress is 1 n / m , the measured lattice spacing is @xmath21 smaller than the value in an unstrained crystal . since the literature values of the surface stress are available only for reconstructed ( 100 ) surfaces , do not consider oxidation , and show value and sign scatters @xcite , a null stress was assumed and no correction was applied to the measurement result .",
    "all the calculations were carried out by means of first principles density - functional theory ( dft ) which allows the schrdinger s equation for large and complex condensed matter systems to be solved by reducing the many - body problem of interacting electrons to an equivalent one for non - interacting particles .",
    "this is achieved by using the electron density , instead of the electron many - body wave function , as the fundamental quantity .",
    "a short outline for non specialists and the relevant references are given in @xcite .",
    "our calculations were carried out using quantum espresso @xcite , an integrated suite of open - source computer codes for electronic - structure calculations and material modelling based on density - functional theory , plane waves , and pseudopotentials . in @xcite , we reported the calculation parameters giving the highest accuracy as far as concerns the si lattice parameter , the benchmark being its best experimentally determined value .",
    "the same parameter - set was used in this work : the pbesol exchange - correlation functional @xcite , which is specifically designed to calculate the bulk properties of solids , ultrasoft plane augmented wave pseudopotentials ( paw ) @xcite , @xmath22-points mesh of the brillouin zone of the unit cells , and 35 ry cutoff of the kinetic energy of the single electron wave functions .",
    "surface stress.,height=170 ]    as a test case to assess the reliability of our dft calculations , we considered the silicon @xmath23 surface , for which several theoretical and experimental estimates of the surface stress are given in @xcite . in detail , we simulated an infinite slab by using supercells having 8 , 12 , 16 , 20 , or 24 layers of 8 silicon atoms , free boundary conditions for the @xmath24 direction perpendicular to the @xmath25 surfaces , and periodic boundary conditions for the transverse @xmath26 and @xmath27 directions .",
    "the supercell dimensions were @xmath28 @xmath29 , @xmath30 @xmath29 , @xmath31 @xmath29 , @xmath32 @xmath29 , and @xmath33 @xmath29 , respectively .",

    "as regards the @xmath51 sign , if the surface shrinks ( expands ) with respect to the bulk , the surface stress is negative ( positive ) and it is said to be compressive ( tensile ) .",
    "we remark that the above procedure also provides the mean stress @xmath52 where @xmath53 and @xmath53 are the principal stresses .",
    "the calculated mean stress @xmath51 is a crucial quantity entering the constitutive equation of the surface through the expression @xmath54 , which provides the total stress over the surface in terms of its local deformation .",

    "the x - ray interferometer crystals are slabs whose surfaces are parallel to the @xmath65 lattice planes . the damage produced by machining",
    "was removed by a cupric - ion etching .",
    "because of the etching anisotropy , the surfaces , though flat and parallel to the @xmath65 planes on the average , are quite rough : they display a texture with a typical 0.1 mm length scale and a few micrometer peak - to - valley amplitude .",
    "in addition , a native oxide layer grows of the slab surfaces  which is expected from 1 nm to 2 nm thick , but nothing is known about its stoichiometry @xcite .    in order to investigate the intrinsic surface stress of the oxidized @xmath66 surface , we started by considering the pristine @xmath66 surface . in detail , we considered a supercell with 20 silicon layers having dimensions of @xmath67 @xmath29 and a total of 160 atoms .",

    "the generation of such a chemically and structurally complex system is computationally very demanding and required a combination of classical molecular dynamics and first principles dft calculations .    in detail",
    ", we started with a slab of 40 si - layers and placed , at the top and bottom boundaries , two sio@xmath8 layers ( @xmath68-quartz phase , about 1 nm thick ) at a distance of 0.3 nm . in total , the system contained 456 atoms .",
    "next , we considered a sio@xmath69 pseudomorphic growth , where the substrate , the si @xmath66 surface , controls the sio@xmath8 in - plane lattice parameter .",
    "initially , we minimized the total energy of the system by means of a combination of low temperature molecular dynamics and conjugate gradients using the lammps code and the tersoff potential @xcite .",
    "after the minimization , the sio@xmath69 layers approached the @xmath66 surfaces at a distance less than 0.15 nm and created several si - o covalent bonds .",
    "eventually , the total energy was further minimized by means of first principles dft calculations using the same parameters as previously described .",
    "after the minimization , owing to the large mismatch between the sio@xmath8 and si lattices , we observed a partial amorphization of the sio@xmath8 layers , which was already reported in @xcite .",

    "( [ gij-1 ] ) is fully relaxed . to go through the calculation of the mean surface stress",
    "@xmath63 is a convenient way to facilitate the calculation of the equilibrium strain by using a continuous mechanics model .",
    "therefore , the mean surface stress was calculated from eq .",
    "( [ gij-2 ] ) , where @xmath50 and @xmath0 are the stress and the thickness of the whole supercell , including both the si and sio@xmath69 layers .",
    "we obtained a very large compressive stress of about @xmath70 n / m .",
    "with respect to pristine @xmath66 surface , we observed a stress variation by about one order of magnitude , both in sign  from tensile to compressive  and modulus .",
    "this dramatic change is due to a twofold effect : i ) a large distortion of the @xmath66 surface due to the interaction with the sio@xmath69 layer and ii ) the intrinsic stress of the sio@xmath69 layer due to the large mismatch between the sio@xmath69 and si @xmath66 lattice parameters .",
    "the occurrence of such a large stress is consistent with the experimental observation that the deposition of only a single oxygen monolayer on top of a si @xmath71 surface gives rise to a surface stress of -7.2 n / m @xcite .",
    "under isotropy and plane - stress assumptions , the slab strain is @xmath72 where @xmath58 , @xmath57 , @xmath73 , and @xmath74 are the surface and bulk elastic constants ( the lam s first and second parameters ) , respectively .",
    "eq.([strain0 ] ) can be easily proved by minimizing the total energy of the slab composed of the energy of the two surfaces and the energy of the si layer . in the limit",
    "when the slab is `` thick '' , this equation simplifies to @xmath75 where @xmath76 gpa is the bulk modulus and @xmath77 m is the thickness of our interest . as matter of fact , @xmath58 and @xmath57 are negligible with respect to @xmath78 and @xmath79 when @xmath0 @xmath80 50 nm ( it depends on the fact that the sio@xmath69 thickness is about 1 nm ) .",
    "although the effect of a stress value of is @xmath70 n / m is expected to be within the detection capability of combined x - ray and optical interferometry , the relevant large strain was never observed .",
    "preliminary measurements carried out by using a purposely designed two - thickness interferometer might have evidenced some clue , but , in the case , the observed strain is more than an order of magnitude smaller than predicted by eq .",
    "( [ strain ] ) @xcite .",
    "for this reason the density functional computation was carefully assessed ; we are confident that the result obtained is representative of the idealized model used .",
    "an explanation may be the roughness of the interferometer surfaces .",
    "in fact , the surface stress is sensitive to the mismatch between the oxide and silicon lattices and , therefore , might critically depend of the oxide structure and stoichiometry , as well as on the orientation of the underlying si surface . about this , we observe that , owing to roughness , the local orientations of the x - ray interferometer facets are quite different from the average @xmath66 . in addition , roughness might help to relax the stress by smoothing or enhancing ridges and grooves . in other terms , the absence of planarity of the oxidised surfaces may strongly reduce the effect of the intrisic stress on the overall induced strain in the sample .    in any case , the result obtained indicates that the surface stress is a potential problem of the lattice parameter measurement ; it deserves further numerical and experimental investigations to exclude that it is causing a systematic error or to quantify it .",
