    "flavour violation in the lepton sector ( lfv ) has been firmly established in neutrino oscillations . a direct evidence of conversion of electron neutrinos into a combination of muon and tau neutrinos is provided by solar neutrino oscillations . in a three neutrino framework",
    "atmospheric neutrino data can only be explained by the dominant oscillation of muon neutrinos into tau neutrinos .",
    "it is natural to expect that lfv takes place , at least at some level , in other processes such as those involving charged leptons .",
    "flavour violating decays of charged leptons , strictly forbidden in the standard model ( sm ) , are indeed allowed as soon as neutrino mass terms are considered . if neutrino masses are the only source of lfv , the effects are too small to be detected , but in most extensions of the sm in which new particles and new interactions with a characteristic scale @xmath19 are included , the presence of new sources of flavour violation , in particular in the lepton sector , is a generic feature . in a low - energy description",
    ", the corresponding effects can be parametrized by higher - dimensional operators describing flavour - violating rare decays of the charged leptons .",
    "the dominant terms are represented by dimension six operators , suppressed by two powers of @xmath19 .",
    "the present bounds on the branching ratios @xcite of these decays set stringent limits on combinations of the scale @xmath19 and the coefficients of the involved operators .",
    "typically , for coefficients of order one , the existing bounds require a large scale @xmath19 , several orders of magnitude larger than the tev scale .",
    "conversely , to allow for new physics at the tev scale , coefficients much smaller than one are required , which might suggest the presence of a flavour symmetry .",
    "new physics at the tev scale supplemented by a flavour symmetry provides an interesting framework .",
    "flavour symmetries have been invoked to describe the observed pattern of lepton masses and mixing angles @xcite , but quite often this approach is limited to a fit of the existing data , with very few new testable predictions @xcite .",
    "specific relations among lfv processes are usually consequences of flavour symmetries and of their pattern of symmetry breaking .",
    "this allows to get independent information on the flavour symmetry in the charged lepton sector .",
    "moreover , if @xmath19 is sufficiently small , new particles might be produced and detected at the lhc , with features that could additionally confirm or reject the assumed symmetry pattern . in @xcite we have recently analyzed in an effective lagrangian approach lfv processes within a class of models possessing a flavour symmetry @xmath20 .",
    "models of this class @xcite automatically reproduce nearly tri - bimaximal ( tb ) lepton mixing at the leading order ( lo ) via a vacuum alignment mechanism . in this type of models @xcite , corrections to tb mixing are generically proportional to the symmetry breaking parameter @xmath4 , especially the reactor mixing angle @xmath5 is of the order of @xmath4 .",
    "the parameter @xmath4 is expected to vary between a few per mil and a few percent . in particular",
    "we have evaluated the normalized branching ratios @xmath21 for the lfv transitions @xmath22 : r_ij=  . in @xcite",
    "we found that the generic expectation for the ratios @xmath21 is : r_ij = w_ij  u^2 [ lfv ] where @xmath23 is the fine structure constant , @xmath24 is the fermi constant and @xmath25 are dimensionless parameters that can not be predicted within the effective lagrangian approach , but are expected to be of order one .",
    "given the range of @xmath4 , it turns out that the present bound on @xmath0 requires the scale @xmath19 to be larger than about 10 tev .",
    "if the underlying fundamental theory is weakly interacting , this translates into a lower bound of about @xmath26 on the typical mass of the new particles . at variance with this generic estimate ,",
    "it was also observed that , if the flavour symmetry is realized in a supersymmetric ( susy ) model , a cancellation might take place in the amplitudes for lfv transitions .",
    "an argument was given suggesting that in this case the ratios @xmath27 are of the form : r^susy_ij= [ lfvsusy ] where @xmath19 now corresponds to the supersymmetry breaking scale , @xmath28 ( @xmath29 ) are the charged lepton masses and @xmath30 are unknown dimensionless quantities of order one .",
    "therefore in a supersymmetric context the predicted rates are more suppressed , allowing for new physics close to the tev scale , without conflicting with the present bounds .",
    "since the cancellation expected in the supersymmetric case considerably changes the conclusion that can be derived from the existing bound on @xmath0 , it is important to perform a direct computation of the branching ratios within an explicit supersymmetric model incorporating the flavour symmetry @xmath3 .    in the present paper",
    "we consider the @xmath16 realization proposed in @xcite in which susy breaking effects were ignored and we extend it to a more realistic model , by adding a full set of susy breaking terms consistent with the flavour symmetry .",
    "we assume that the breaking of supersymmetry occurs at a scale higher than or comparable to the flavour scale , simulated in our effective lagrangian by a cutoff , so that at energies close to the cutoff scale we have non - universal boundary conditions for the soft susy breaking terms , dictated by the flavour symmetry .",
    "depending on the assumed mechanism of susy breaking we may have boundary conditions different from these , possibly enforced at a smaller energy scale .",
    "for this reason , our approach maximizes the possible effects on lfv processes .    through a detailed calculation of the slepton mass matrices in the physical basis ,",
    "in which kinetic terms are canonical and leptons are in their mass eigenbasis , and evaluation of @xmath21 in the mass insertion ( mi ) approximation we find that the behaviour of @xmath21 , expected from the susy variant of the effective lagrangian approach , given in eq .",
    "( [ lfvsusy ] ) is violated by a single , flavour independent contribution .",
    "the correct scaling of @xmath21 is the one of eq .",
    "( [ lfv ] ) , with a universal constant @xmath25 .",
    "this implies @xmath31 at the lo in @xmath4 .",
    "we identify the source of violation of the expected behaviour in a contribution to the right - left ( rl ) block of the slepton mass matrix , associated to the sector necessary to maintain the correct breaking of the flavour symmetry @xmath16 .",
    "we also enumerate the conditions under which such a contribution is absent and the behavior in eq .",
    "( [ lfvsusy ] ) is recovered , though we could not find a dynamical explanation to justify the realization of these conditions in our model .    as shown in the mi approximation the coefficient @xmath25 of the leading contribution in eq .",
    "( [ lfv ] ) is numerically small in a large region of the parameter space , where the sub - leading contributions play an important role .",
    "we then provide a numerical study of @xmath21 by using full one - loop expressions and explore the parameter space of the model .",
    "thereby , we assume a supergravity ( sugra ) framework with a common mass scale @xmath9 for soft sfermion and higgs masses and a common mass @xmath10 for gauginos at high energies . applying the current mega bound on @xmath32",
    "we find that small values of @xmath4 or @xmath8 are favoured for @xmath9 and @xmath10 below @xmath11 gev .",
    "employing the foreseen bound coming from the meg experiment constrains the model severely allowing only for small @xmath4 and @xmath8 for @xmath33 gev or requires larger @xmath9 and @xmath10 reducing the prospects for detection of sparticles at lhc .",
    "furthermore , it turns out to be rather unnatural to reconcile the values of superparticle masses necessary to account for the measured deviation @xmath34 in @xmath35 , the muon anomalous magnetic moment , from the sm value with the present bound on @xmath32 . in our model values of @xmath36",
    "smaller than @xmath37 are favoured .",
    "the paper is structured as follows : in section 2 we review the basic features of the susy @xmath16 model and calculate kinetic terms and mass matrices of leptons and sleptons in an expansion in the symmetry breaking parameters . in section 3",
    "we compute the slepton mass matrices in the physical basis .",
    "furthermore , we estimate the possible effects on the slepton masses coming from renormalization group ( rg ) running .",
    "section 4 is dedicated to the study of the quantities @xmath21 in the mi approximation , while in section 5 we discuss @xmath32 in a more quantitative way in the sugra context and comment on the size of the measured deviation in the muon anomalous magnetic moment @xmath35 in our model .",
    "finally , we conclude in section 6 .",
    "appendix a contains details about the group theory of @xmath16 , appendix b details of the calculation of the slepton mass matrices in the physical basis and in appendix c conventions and formulae , used in the numerical study of section 5 , are given .",
    "in this section , we first discuss the main features and predictions of the lepton mixing in the class of @xmath16 realizations to which the present susy model belongs",
    ". then we will present the khler and the superpotential of our model from which kinetic and mass terms are derived for leptons and sleptons .",

    "@xmath16 is the group of even permutations of four objects which is isomorphic to the tetrahedral group .",

    "the @xmath45 group is generated by the element @xmath43 and is left intact , if a scalar triplet @xmath49 acquires a vacuum expectation value ( vev ) of the form : ( 1,0,0 ) .",

    "are expected to have masses between @xmath11 and @xmath431 gev so that they also can be detected at lhc . as one can see from figure [ scatterbr](c )",
    "the on - going meg experiment can probe nearly the whole parameter space of the model for @xmath98 , @xmath413 and @xmath410 gev for values of @xmath414 gev .",
    "increasing the parameter @xmath9 to @xmath11 gev shows that applying the existing bound on @xmath416 of @xmath432 can not exclude small values of @xmath10",
    ". the situation changes , if the expected bound from the meg experiment is employed , because then values of @xmath10 smaller than @xmath11 gev become disfavoured .",
    "finally , we show in figure [ scatterbr](e ) and [ scatterbr](f ) the results obtained for @xmath97 . we remind that this value is the largest possible one of @xmath8 in our model . requiring that the @xmath15 yukawa coupling does not become too large entails that @xmath97 fixes the expansion parameter @xmath4 to take a value close to its upper limit , @xmath413 .",
    "the value of @xmath433 is thus enhanced through @xmath8 as well as @xmath4 .",
    "this is clearly shown in figure [ scatterbr](e ) and [ scatterbr](f ) , because for a low value of @xmath410 gev already the mega bound practically excludes almost the whole parameter space of our model for all values of @xmath414 gev .",
    "increasing the mass parameter @xmath9 to @xmath11 gev slightly improves the situation , because now there exists a marginal probability to pass the mega bound .",
    "again , however , the meg experiment can probe all parameter space of our model for @xmath414 gev .",
    "thus , for @xmath434 gev and @xmath414 gev the parameter space of our model is already severely constrained for moderate values of @xmath8 which entail large @xmath435 by the bound coming from the mega collaboration , but surely will be conclusively probed by the meg experiment .",
    "choosing @xmath436 hardly affects the results presented here apart from slightly decreasing the lower bound on @xmath10 coming from the chargino mass bound .",
    "thus , all statements made also apply for @xmath436 .    in summary ,",
    "the current bound on @xmath416 prefers regions in the parameter space of our model with small @xmath4 or small @xmath8 , as long as the sugra mass parameters should be chosen smaller than @xmath11 gev .",
    "the foreseen meg bound strongly favours regions in which @xmath4 is small for @xmath9 and @xmath10 being not too large .",
    "the fact that smaller values of @xmath4 are preferred has consequences also for the expectations of the detection prospects for the reactor mixing angle @xmath5 , because this angle scales with @xmath4 : it might thus not be possible to detect @xmath5 with the reactor and neutrino beam experiments under preparation @xcite .",
    "concerning the radiative @xmath15 decays , @xmath437 and @xmath438 , the result found in the mi approximation that the branching ratios of these decays are of the same order of magnitude as @xmath416 is essentially confirmed in a numerical analysis . due to the random parameters differences up to two orders of magnitude",
    "are expected and found , especially for the case of larger @xmath8 .",
    "however , it is still highly improbable that the decays @xmath437 and @xmath438 could be detected at a superb factory , assuming a prospective limit of @xmath439 @xcite .",
    "as is well known , the value found for the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon @xcite a_^exp=116592080(63)10 ^ -11 shows a 3.4 @xmath440 deviation a_=a_^exp - a_^sm=+302(88)10 ^ -11 [ da ] from the value expected in the sm @xcite a_^sm=116591778(61)10 ^ -11 .",
    "similar discrepancies have been reported in @xcite .",
    "thus , it might be interesting to consider the case in which this deviation is attributed to the presence of susy particles with masses of a few hundred gev .",
    "the one - loop contribution to the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon in supersymmetric extensions of the sm has been studied by several authors @xcite .",
    "we study the compatibility between the requirement that @xmath34 is explained by the exchange of relatively light susy particles and the experimental upper limit on @xmath416 coming from the mega experiment .",
    "we choose again two different values of @xmath4 , @xmath412 and @xmath413 . to better explore the parameter space we vary the @xmath15 yukawa coupling between @xmath409 and @xmath41 and",
    "fix the value of @xmath8 through the relation given in eq .",
    "( [ tanb&u&yt ] ) . as a consequence in the plot for @xmath412 ,",
    "see figure [ scatterbrg2](a ) , @xmath441 holds and for @xmath413 @xmath8 takes values @xmath442 .",
    "similarly , @xmath9 and @xmath10 are chosen to lie in intervals @xmath443 $ ] and @xmath444 $ ] for @xmath412 and @xmath413 , respectively .",
    "the different choice of intervals is due to the fact that values of a few hundred gev for @xmath9 and @xmath10 are disfavoured by the existing limit on @xmath416 when @xmath413 .",
    "as one can clearly see from figure [ scatterbrg2 ] , in almost the whole parameter space of our model it is not natural to reproduce the observed deviation of the muon anomalous magnetic moment and at the same time to respect the existing bound on the branching ratio of @xmath0 .",
    "this kind of incompatibility is well known in supersymmetric theories , because the explanation of the @xmath445 discrepancy necessitates small values of @xmath9 and @xmath10 and larger values of @xmath8 , which in turn enhance the branching ratio of the radiative lfv decays .",
    "thus , we have to conclude that either there exist further sources of contributions to the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon beyond those present in our model , or - as is also discussed in the literature - the theoretical value @xmath446 found in the sm is closer to @xmath447 so that the eventual discrepancy becomes less than @xmath37 , a value which could well be explained in our model .",
    "while awaiting the start of lhc and the first exploration of the tev scale , the solution to the hierarchy problem offered by susy still represents a very appealing option , with several interesting consequences , such as a successful gauge coupling unification , a viable particle candidate for dark matter and a possible explanation of the observed discrepancy in the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon .",
    "nevertheless the existence of new states carrying flavour indices at the tev scale is a serious problem in model building , given the success of the sm in describing all known phenomena involving flavour transitions .",
    "the lepton sector makes no exception . the flavour conversion observed in neutrino oscillations",
    "might be related to potentially large effects in rare decays of the charged leptons .",
    "a naive dimensional estimate of these effects , assuming new physics at the tev scale , requires a large suppression in the relevant amplitudes , to pass the existing bounds .",
    "a possible explanation for such a suppression is the presence of a flavour symmetry , which is independently motivated by the hierarchy in the charged lepton mass spectrum and by the nearly tb mixing pattern of the lepton mixing matrix .",
    "here we have considered a susy model invariant under the flavour symmetry group @xmath3 , originally proposed in order to describe lepton masses and mixing angles .",
    "we have extended the original model by including susy breaking terms consistent with all symmetry requirements .",
    "our model is an effective theory , valid at energy scales below a cutoff @xmath448 , where we have derived the spectrum of susy particles , in the slepton sector , under the assumption that the susy breaking scale is larger than @xmath449 .",
    "it provides an example of a model in which the slepton mass matrices at the scale @xmath449 are not universal .",
    "left - handed sleptons are approximately universal , with a small departure from universality controlled by @xmath4 , the flavour symmetry breaking parameter .",
    "right - handed sleptons have soft masses of the same order , but the relative difference among them is expected to be of order one .",
    "off - diagonal elements in both sectors , as well as in the rl block , are small and have a characteristic pattern in terms of powers of @xmath4 .",
    "this structure is maintained by the effects coming from the rg running from @xmath448 down to the electroweak scale .",
    "the symmetry breaking parameter @xmath4 lies in a restricted range around few per cent and has a size similar to the reactor mixing angle @xmath5 .",
    "we have exploited the knowledge of the slepton mass matrices to compute the normalized branching ratios @xmath21 for the transitions @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 . at variance with other models based on flavour symmetries we found @xmath372 and , given the present limit on @xmath32 , these rare @xmath15 decays are practically unobservable in our model . on a more theoretical side",
    ", the scaling @xmath450 , found in the mi approximation , violates an expectation based on an effective lagrangian approach , which suggested @xmath451 in the limit of massless final charged lepton .",
    "we have identified the source of such a violation in a single , flavour independent , contribution of the rl block of the slepton mass matrix .",
    "such a contribution originates from the vevs of the auxiliary components of the flavon supermultiplets .",
    "we have classified the conditions under which this universal contribution is absent .    in a numerical analysis of @xmath32",
    "we found that already the current bound from the mega experiment requires the parameter @xmath4 to be small or @xmath8 to be small for susy mass parameters @xmath9 and @xmath10 below @xmath11 gev , to guarantee detection of sparticles at lhc . applying",
    "the prospective meg bound tightens the parameter space of our model even more to small @xmath4 and @xmath8 or requires mass parameters @xmath9 and @xmath10 above @xmath11 gev .",
    "furthermore , we showed that the deviation of the experimentally observed value of the magnetic moment of the muon from the sm one can not be naturally explained in our framework , for @xmath416 below the current bound .",
