    "interference stabilization of rydberg atoms , or strong - field suppression of photoionization , is known @xcite , @xcite to be a phenomenon related to the coherent re - population of levels neighboring to the initially populated one .",
    "such a re - population arises owing to raman - type transitions via the continuum and in the case of a single - color field it can be efficient only if the field is strong enough .",
    "specifically , the strong - field criterion for the effect of interference stabilization is formulated qualitatively as the requirement for the ionization width @xmath1 of the initially populated atomic level @xmath2 to be larger than the spacing between neighboring levels , @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the principal quantum number .",
    "the ionization width is determined here as the rate of ionization calculated with the help of the fermi golden rule . however , repopulation of neighboring rydberg levels is provided , actually , by the off - diagonal terms of the tensor of ionization widths @xmath5 . in the approximation of adiabatic elimination of the continuum ( which includes , in particular , the well - know rotating wave approximation , @xcite )",
    "this tensor is determined as a direct generalization of the fermi golden rule expression for @xmath1 @xmath6 where @xmath7 and @xmath8 are the laser field - strength amplitude and frequency , @xmath9 is the projection of the atomic dipole moment upon the direction of light polarization , @xmath10 is the energy of the atomic electron in the continuum , and atomic units are used throughout the paper if not indicated differently .",
    "so , the next crucial assumption in the theory of interference stabilization is that all the components of the tensor ( [ tensor ] ) are approximately equal to each other @xmath11 this assumption is pretty well fulfilled for high atomic rydberg levels , @xmath12 , @xmath13 ( see explanations in @xcite ) .",
    "it should be noted also that for rydberg levels their ac stark shift , as well as the shift of the ionization threshold are equal approximately to the ponderomotive energy @xmath14 and identical to each other , and this common shift does not affect either the dynamics of photoionization from rydberg levels or the effect of interference stabilization .    the simplest model , in which the effect of interference stabilization exists , is the model of two close atomic levels @xmath15 and @xmath16 connected with each other by the raman - type transitions via the continuum , for which the conditions ( [ threshold ] ) and ( [ equal ] ) are fulfilled and the ac stark shift has the same features as described above for rydberg levels and , actually , can be ignored .",
    "both in two - level and multilevel systems there are several different theoretical approaches one can use to solve the problems of strong - field photoionization and stabilization .",
    "one of them is based on the use of quasienergy or `` dressed - state '' analysis .",
    "the total wave function of an atomic electron in a light field can be expanded in a series of the field - free atomic eigenfunctions @xmath17 in the approximation of adiabatic elimination of the continuum equations for the coefficients @xmath18 are stationary , and in the simplest case of the two - level system they have the form @xmath19\\\\",

    "are stationary , they have solutions of the form @xmath20 , where @xmath21 is a complex quasienergy . when this exponential dependence on @xmath22 is substituted into eqs .",
    "( [ 2-lev - eq ] ) , they turn into a set of two algebraic homogeneous equations , which has a nonzero solution if its determinant turns zero .",
    "this is the condition from which the two quasienergies of the field - driven two - level system have to be found , and the result is given by @xmath23 from here we see that , indeed , a drastic change in the form of the solutions occurs when the interaction constant @xmath24 becomes larger than the level spacing @xmath25 .",
    "the point @xmath26 is the branching point , below which ( at @xmath27 ) the root square is real in eq .",
    "( [ 2-lev - qe ] ) , whereas above the branching point ( at @xmath28 ) it becomes imaginary .",
    "the imaginary parts of the quasienergies @xmath29 ( [ 2-lev - qe ] ) are shown in fig . 1 , and they determine the field - dependent widths of the two quasienergy levels @xmath30|$ ] , where @xmath31 ( [ tensor ] ) .",
    "one of the two branches arising at @xmath28 ( @xmath32 ) corresponds to a narrowing quasienergy level whose width @xmath33 falls with a growing field - strength amplitude .",
    "this corresponds to an increasing life - time of this quasienergy level and to stabilization of an atomic population at this level .",
    "though rather attractive by its simplicity , an isolated two - level system obeying the requirement ( [ equal ] ) hardly can be easily found in the usual atomic spectra .",
    "this is the reason why here we consider another scheme , in which two atomic levels with significantly different energies and bound - free dipole matrix are connected with each other by raman - type transitions via the continuum in a two - color field ( fig .",
    "such a scheme has been widely discussed in literature @xcite in connection with the phenomenon of light - induced continuum structure ( lics ) , briefly outlined below .",
    "the process we suggest and investigate , as well as its similarity and differences with lics are discussed in subsection @xmath34 .    in lics , one of the two fields of a two - color light is assumed to be strong [ ( @xmath35 , @xmath36 ) , the pump ] and the other one - weak [ ( @xmath37 , @xmath38 ) , the probe ] , where @xmath39 and @xmath40 are the corresponding frequencies and field - strength amplitudes . in a scheme of fig . 2 @xmath41 is the raman - type resonance detuning .",
    "@xmath42    under the action of the pump the first floquet satellite of the level",
    "@xmath16 takes the form of an autoionizing - like level @xmath43 at the background of the continuum with the width equal to the ionization width of the level @xmath16 , @xmath44 ( [ tensor ] ) with @xmath7 substituted by @xmath36 .",
    "if all the population is concentrated initially at the level @xmath15 , the probe field ionizes the atom and takes the floquet satellite @xmath43 for an almost real autoionizing level , which gives rise to the typical asymmetric fano - profile - like structure of the dispersion curve @xmath45 ( fig .",
    "3 ) .    the fano minimum of the curve @xmath45 arises owing to interference of direct and indirect transitions to the continuum ( @xmath46 and @xmath47 ) .",
    "but this is not yet a stabilization understood as an increasing suppression of ionization with a growing light intensity .",
    "an experiment we suggest and discuss below can demonstrate explicitly such an interference suppression and stabilization of an atom in its bound states .",
    "we will assume that both fields can be equally strong and in this sense the effect we consider can be referred to as a strong - field lics .",
    "it should be noted that the channel of ionization shown in fig . 2 by a dashed line ( taken into account for the first time in ref .",
    "@xcite ) determines a nonzero height of the fano curve in its minimum .",
    "as we will see below , this is just the competition of this non - interfering channel of ionization with interfering ones that is crucially important for optimization of stabilization in its dependence on light intensities .",
    "at last , another well - known analogue of lics is related to single- and double strong - field resonances at real autoionizing atomic levels @xcite .",
    "the physics of this phenomenon and lics are close though there are evident differences concerning mechanisms of level broadening .",
    "these differences make autoionizing resonances not as closely related to the phenomenon under consideration as lics .",
    "the same can be said about dark states and population trapping in a three - level system @xcite .",
    "the physics of all these phenomena is alike though important details are different . in particular , this concerns intensity - dependent mechanisms of level broadening and an important role of the noninterfering ionization channel specific for the scheme under consideration and missing in a three - level scheme . besides , the atomic continuous spectrum is so much wider than any discrete third level that this makes characteristic intensities in the phenomenon to be discussed absolutely different from those in the population trapping effect .",
    "let us assume that the initially populated level in a scheme of fig .",
    "2 is @xmath15 . at the first stage , by considering ionization of an atom by the field @xmath38 alone ( with @xmath48 ) , we select the peak light intensity @xmath49 and pulse duration @xmath50 high and long enough to provide almost complete ionization of an atom by a pulse , @xmath51 . then , by adding the field @xmath36 we expect that under proper conditions , owing to interference effect , the combined action of two fields will result in a significant suppression of ionization . in other words",
    ", we expect that the function @xmath52 in its dependence on @xmath53 at a given selected value of @xmath54 will start from 1 at @xmath55 , then it will have a minimum at some intensity @xmath56 , and then , at higher intensity @xmath53 , @xmath52 will return to one again .",
    "the region around @xmath57 will be interpreted as a stabilization window .",
    "the interference origin of stabilization is evident , because with a growing @xmath53 ( at a given @xmath54 ) , we increase an energy that can be put into an atom .",
    "but , counterintuitively , this additional energy results in a slower rather than faster ionization , and this can be explained only by interference effects .    we will find values of the resonance detuning @xmath41 and the ratio of intensities @xmath58 which optimize the stabilization effect .",
    "compared to a simplified system of two close levels in a single - color field described in the introduction , to characterize appropriately a system of fig . 2 in a two - color arbitrary strong field , in addition to ionization broadening and mixing of levels , we have to take into account also their shifts and mixing arising owing to the ac stark effect .",
    "both these effects can be described in terms of the complex polarizability tensor @xmath59 , @xmath60 , @xmath61 @xmath62 and @xmath63 @xmath64 where integration over @xmath10 includes summation over intermediate discrete states .",

    "normalization by an arbitrary constant @xmath217 reflects the scaling effect described above in section @xmath223 . a possibility to choose any value of @xmath217 indicates a large flexibility of the system under consideration with respect to a choice of of the light intensities and pulse durations .",
    "for example , if @xmath224a.u .",
    "( @xmath225 w/@xmath226 ) , the intensity @xmath227 does not exceed @xmath228 w/@xmath226 in the variation range of @xmath54 at fig .",
    "11 , which is low enough for no ati effects to take place . and , under the best stabilization conditions , the detuning @xmath41 and pulse duration are equal to @xmath229 and @xmath230 .",
    "the curves of fig .",
    "11 are typical for the stabilization picture . with a growing light intensity ,",
    "at first , the probability of ionization grows ( perturbation theory region ) , then falls , and this is the beginning of the stabilization window , and finally grows again , which corresponds to the break of stabilization .",
    "stabilization and its break arise because , owing to the ac stark shift and level mixing , with a growing light intensity the system comes to and , then , goes out of the resonance conditions , optimal for fully - dressed - level narrowing and interference stabilization .",
    "the curve @xmath222 of fig .",
    "11 indicates an appearance of an additional region between the perturbation theory and stabilization zone at a sufficiently long pulse duration @xmath50 .",
    "this is the region of the total ionization of an atom , where @xmath231 .",
    "this means that at some intermediate intensity light pulses provide a complete ionization and at a stronger field , owing to interference , ionization becomes rather small ( @xmath232 ) . in absolute values ,",
    "the minimal achievable probability in the stabilization region is somewhat lower in the case of short pulses ( @xmath233 ) ( the curve @xmath145 of fig .",
    "but the degree of stabilization can be determined alternatively as the ratio of the maximal probability achievable in the region between perturbation - theory and stabilization regions to the minimal value of @xmath137 in the stabilization window . in terms of such a definition , the degree of stabilization is much higher in the case of longer pulses ( @xmath234 ) ( the curve @xmath222 of fig .",
    "of course , a further increase of the pulse duration flattens the curve of fig . 11 in the stabilization region and",
    "decreases the degree of stabilization . in this sense ,",

    "12 characterizes spectral features of the residual probability to find an atom in its bound states at the best stabilization conditions of fig . 11 : @xmath235 , @xmath236 , @xmath237 ( @xmath145 ) and @xmath238 ( @xmath222 ) ( which corresponds to @xmath220 and @xmath221 ) .",
    "the curve @xmath145 of this picture looks similar to the fano curve of fig .",
    "this shows that at @xmath239 , still , the effect of stabilization under discussion can be interpreted as a strong - field lics .",
    "but in the case of longer pulses , @xmath240 ( the curve @xmath222 of fig .",
    "12 ) similarity with lics practically disappears .",
    "the only reminder about a remote connection with the fano curve is a slight asymmetry of the curve @xmath222 of fig .",
    "12 . apart from this",
    ", the curve @xmath222 describes the effect of interference stabilization in its pure form .",
    "all the results described above were derived for pulses with a rectangular envelope .",
    "usually , envelopes of short laser pulses are smooth .",
    "to consider such a more realistic situation , we have solved general equations ( [ 2-lev - eq - gen ] ) with the @xmath151 pulse envelopes ( [ pure - sin^2 ] ) .",
    "the results of such a solution are shown in fig .",
    "13 , which is a direct analog of fig . 9 . again",
    ", a series of resonance - like curves describes the residual probability of finding an atom in its bound states @xmath241 at various given values of the detuning @xmath127 and the intensity ratio @xmath125 considered as the independent variable .",
    "the residual probability maximized with respect to the detuning @xmath127 is the envelope of the peaks of these curves . in fig",
    "13 such a maximized probability is approximated by the functions @xmath242 , where @xmath243 is the empirically found linear function providing the best fitting to the peak envelope : @xmath244    in fig .",
    "14 we plot the maximized residual probability to find @xmath187 atoms in bound states calculated in the cases of rectangular ( the curves 1 and 2 ) and @xmath151 ( the curve    \\3 ) pulse envelopes at @xmath245 ( [ delta - opt - he ] ) ( the curve 1 ) and @xmath246 ( [ delta - opt - smooth - he ] ) ( the curves 2 and 3 ) .",
    "comparison of the curve 1 and 3 shows that a transition to a smooth envelope @xmath247 reduces a little bit the maximal achievable degree of stabilization compared to the rectangular - envelope case , but not too much ( 70 - 75 @xmath0 instead of @xmath248 ) .",
    "moreover , the curve 3 of fig .",
    "14 shows that in the case of a smooth pulse envelope the residual probability remains more or less stable in a rather large variation interval of the intensity ratio @xmath125 , approximately from 0.5 to 5 and more .",
    "this shows that the effect of stabilization is rather robust .",
    "another interesting effect seen rather well from comparison of the curves 2 and 3 of fig .",
    "these two curves are calculated at the coinciding dependencies of the detuning @xmath127 on the intensity ratio parameter @xmath125 , @xmath246 ( [ delta - opt - smooth - he ] ) . as it s seen well from fig .",
    "14 , at @xmath249 the curve 3 goes above the curve 2 .",
    "this means that at the same detunings the residual probability to find an atom in its bound states in the case of smooth envelope pulses exceeds the same probability at a rectangular pulse envelope . in other words , in this range of the intensity ratio parameter @xmath125 smoothing of the pulse envelope increases rather than reduces the degree of stabilization .",
    "this conclusion follows directly from calculations though it looks counterintuitive and , in this sense , rather interesting .",
    "in a hydrogen atom , all the polarizability tensor components are known for the levels @xmath250 and @xmath251 and frequencies @xmath37 = 4.02 ev ( @xmath252 laser ) and @xmath35 = 1.17 ev ( @xmath253 laser ) @xcite . in atomic units",
    "they are given by @xmath254 the data ( [ data - h ] ) show , in particular , that @xmath255 , which means that the assumption ( [ smaller ] ) is pretty well satisfied .",
    "rigorously , in a hydrogen , there are other levels ( @xmath256 and @xmath257 ) of almost the same energy as @xmath251 .",
    "owing to the selection rules , the level @xmath257 is not connected either with @xmath250 or @xmath251 levels by two - photon raman - type transitions and , for this reason , can be ignored . as for the level @xmath256 , in principle ,",
    "it can participate in a scheme of two - photon raman - type transitions under consideration .",
    "however , by ignoring at first this additional level let us consider a two - level 2s-5s scheme , analogous to that of the previous section .    for this system",
    "the coordinates of the @xmath183 point in the @xmath193 plane are given by @xmath258 at @xmath195 , the calculated relative width of the fully dressed quasienergy levels @xmath136 ( [ width - dim - less ] ) in their dependence on @xmath125 are shown in fig .",
    "15 .    compared with fig . 5 , the picture of fig .",
    "15 indicates the first well pronounced difference between helium and hydrogen . in the case of a hydrogen",
    "the curves of widths of quasienergy levels vs. @xmath125 have two avoided - crossing points whereas in the case of helium such a situation never occurs and at @xmath195 there are two real - crossing points ( fig . 5 ) .    another important difference concerns smooth pulse envelopes and the third level effect .",
    "to solve such a problem , we have to generalize eqs .",
    "( [ exp2 ] ) and ( [ 2-lev - eq - gen ] ) . in eq .",
    "( [ exp2 ] ) , in accordance with the more general eq .",
    "( [ expansion ] ) , there appears an additional term @xmath259 .",
    "then , equations for @xmath260 ( @xmath261 ) take the form @xmath262 where @xmath263 is given by the same eq .",
    "( [ dressed - levels ] ) as @xmath264 and @xmath265 with @xmath266 and new off - diagonal elements of the polarizability tensor given by @xcite @xmath267    found from eqs .",
    "( [ 3-lev - eq - gen ] ) and ( [ sin^2 ] ) the residual probability to find an atom in its bound states is shown in fig .",
    "16 for three different values of the pulse envelope smoothing factor @xmath145 .",
    "two rather interesting conclusions can be deduced from this picture .",
    "first , a strong smoothing of pulse envelopes decreases the peak value of the residual probability to find an atom in bound states . at the chosen value of the detuning @xmath268 in the case of pure @xmath151 pulses @xmath269_{max}$ ]",
    "is almost twice smaller then in the case of rectangular envelopes .",
    "the smoothing induced decrease of the residual probability in the case of hydrogen is much more significant than in the case of helium .    the second effect seen in the picture of fig .",
    "16 concerns the influence of the third level .",
    "this influence manifests itself in a shoulder on the curves @xmath270 , but the third level is seen not to affect much the main maximum of the curves .",
    "to summarize , we describe and discuss a scheme of interaction of atoms with radiation of two lasers . intensity and pulse duration of lasers",
    "are assumed to be high and long enough to provide full ionization in the field of each of these two lasers alone if only atoms are prepared initially at levels from which one - photon ionization can take place . we show that owing to interference effects under the conditions close to raman - type resonance between some two selected atomic levels ionization of an atom experiencing a joint action of the field of two lasers can be significantly ( up to 90 @xmath0 ) suppressed .",
    "optimization of such a stabilization effect involves optimization with respect to the raman - type resonance detuning and the ratio of the two laser intensities .",
    "specific calculations are carried out for hydrogen and helium atoms for couples of atomic levels and laser frequencies at which information about the complex polarizability tensors involved is available .",
    "qualitatively , the results of calculations for hydrogen and helium appear to be very similar .",
    "this gives us a reason to think that the effect described is rather universal , and can occur also at other atoms , levels , and frequencies .",
    "the dependence of the effect on laser pulse shapes is investigated .",
    "it is shown that in the case of helium atoms sensitivity of the results to a pulse shape is lower than in the case of hydrogen atoms . in helium , even in the case of smooth pulses , the degree of stabilization remains rather high ( more than 70 @xmath0 ) , and the effect exists at this level in a rather large range of the intensity ratio parameter @xmath125 .",
    "the described scaling effect gives a possibility to select ranges of variation of the laser pulse peak intensities and pulse duration in a ranges most convenient for experimental observation .",
