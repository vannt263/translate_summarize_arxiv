    "tailored random graph ensembles , whose statistical features are sculpted to mimic those observed in a given application domain , provide a rational framework within which we can understand and quantify topological patterns observed in real life networks .",
    "most analytical approaches for studying such networks , or for studying processes for which they provide the interaction infrastructure , assume explicitly or implicitly that they are locally tree - like .",
    "it permits , usually after further mathematical manipulations and in leading orders in the system size , factorisation across nodes and/or links .",
    "this in turn allows for the crucial combinatorial sums over all possible graphs with given constraints to be done analytically in the relevant calculations .",
    "however , real - world networks - for example protein - protein interaction networks ( ppin ) , immune networks , synthetic communication networks , or social networks - tend to have a significant number of short loops .",
    "it is widely accepted that the abundance of short loops in , for example , ppins is intrinsic to the function of these networks .",
    "the authors of @xcite suggested that the stability of a biological network is highly correlated with the relative abundance of motifs ( e.g. triangles ) .",
    "the authors of @xcite and @xcite observed an apparent relationship between short cycles in gene - regulation networks and the system s response to stress and heat - shock .",
    "a highly cited paper @xcite went as far as to propose that motifs ( e.g. triangles ) are the basic building blocks of most networks .",
    "similarly , in many - particle physics we know that lattice models are difficult to solve , mainly because of the many short loops that exist between the interacting variables on the lattice vertices @xcite ; calculating the free energy of statistical mechanical models on tree - like lattices , in contrast , is relatively straightforward .",
    "it is evident that incorporating constraints relating to the statistics of short loops into the specifications of random graph ensembles is important for this branch of research to be able to more closely align with the needs of practitioners in the bioinformatics and network science communities .    in this paper",
    "we review the analytical techniques that are presently available to model and analyse ensembles of random graphs with extensive numbers of short loops , and we discuss possible future research routes and ideas .",
    "we will use the terms ` network ' and ` graph ' without distinction .",
    "we start with a description of tailored random graph ensembles , and argue why graphs with short loops should become the focus of research , to increase their applicability to real - world problems and for mathematical and methodological reasons .",
    "we then discuss the simplest network model with short loops that even after some forty years we still can not solve satisfactorily : the strauss model @xcite , which is the archetypical ensemble of finitely connected random graphs with controlled number of triangles .",
    "we describe some new results on the entropy of this ensemble , continuing the work of e.g. @xcite , as well as an as yet unexplored approach based on combining graph spectral analysis with the replica method .",
    "the next section discusses some recent results on the statistical mechanics of an immune network model @xcite ; in spite of its many short loops , this model could quite unexpectedly be solved analytically with the finite connectivity replica method @xcite , suggesting a possible and welcome new mechanism for analysing more general families of ` loopy ' graphs .",
    "we then show how the model of @xcite can indeed be used in other scenarios where short loops in networks play a functional role , and we work out in more detail its application in the context of factor graph representations of protein - protein interaction networks .",
    "networks are powerful conceptual tools in the modelling of real - world phenomena . in large systems of interacting variables",
    "they specify which pairs can interact , which leads to convenient visualisations and reduces the complexity of the problem .",
    "random graphs serve as proxies for interaction networks that are ( fully or partially ) observed or built in biology , physics , economics , or engineering .",
    "random graphs allow us to analytically solve statistical mechanical models of the processes for which the networks represent the infrastructure , by appropriate averaging of generating functions of observables over all ` typical ' interaction networks . or they can be used as ` null models ' to quantify the statistical relevance of topological measurements which are taken from observed networks . in all cases",
    "it is vital that the random graphs actually resemble the true real - world networks in a quantitatively controllable way .    in this paper",
    "we limit ourselves , for simplicity , to nondirected graphs without self - links .",
    "generalisation of the various models and arguments to directed and/or self - interacting graphs is usually straightforward .",

    "@xmath4 if the nodes @xmath5 are connected by a link , and @xmath6 otherwise .",
    "we always have @xmath7 ( since our graphs are nondirected ) and @xmath8 ( since our graphs are simple ) , for all @xmath9 .",
    "we will denote the set of all such graphs as @xmath10 .",
    "a random graph ensemble is defined by a probability measure @xmath11 on @xmath10 .      if we wish to use random graph ensembles to study real - world phenomena , it is vital that our measure @xmath11 favours graphs that mimic those in our application domain .",
    "for instance , it makes no sense to use erds - rnyi graphs @xcite as null models against which to test occurrence frequencies of motifs in biological networks : almost any measurement will come out as significant , simply because our yardstick is not realistic . tailored random graph ensembles @xcite",
    "involve measures @xmath11 that are constructed such that specified topological features of the generated graphs @xmath12 will systematically resemble those of a given real - world graph @xmath13 .",
    "to construct such measures one first defines the set of @xmath14 observables @xmath15 whose values the random graphs @xmath12 is supposed to inherit from @xmath16 .",
