    "the search for wireless power transfer techniques is as old as the invention of electricity . from tesla , trough the vast technological development during the 20th century till recent days",
    ", many proposals have been made and implemented in this research field .",
    "established techniques for wireless energy transfer are known both in the near- and far - field coupling regimes .",
    "examples for the former can be found in resonant inductive electric transformers @xcite , optical waveguides @xcite and cavity couplers @xcite . in the far field",
    ", one can find the mechanism of transferring electromagnetic power by beaming a light source to a receiver which is converted to usable electrical energy @xcite .",
    "although these techniques enable sufficiently efficient energy transfer , they suffer either from the short - range interaction in the near - field , or from the requirement of line of sight in the far - field approaches .",
    "recently , it was shown that weakly radiative wireless energy transfer between two identical classical resonant coils is possible with sufficiently high efficiency kurs , karalis , hamam .",
    "this breakthrough was made possible by the application of the coupled mode theory into the realm of power transfer . in this experiment , kurs _",
    "@xcite showed that energy can be transferred wirelessly at distances of about 2 meters ( mid - range ) with efficiency of about 40% .",
    "currently , most efficient wireless energy transfer devices rely upon the constraint of exact resonance between the frequencies of the emitter ( the source ) and the receiver ( the device , or the drain ) coils kurs , karalis , hamam . when the frequency of the source is shifted from the frequency of the device , due to lack of similarity between the coils or by random noise ( introduced , for example",
    ", by external objects placed close to either coils ) , a significant reduction of the transfer efficiency would occur .",
    "in such case , one may implement a feedback circuit , as suggested in ref .",
    "@xcite , in order to correct the reduction of the transfer efficiency .    in this paper ,",
    "we suggest a different approach to resolve the issues of the resonant energy transfer process . here , we present a novel technique for robust and efficient mid - range wireless power transfer between two coils , by adapting the process of adiabatic passage ( ap ) for a coherently driven two - state quantum system @xcite , as will be explained in the following sections .",
    "the adiabatic technique promises to be both efficient and robust for variations of the parameters driving the process , such as the resonant frequencies of the coils and the coupling coefficient between them .",
    "( b ) the proposed adiabatic technique , with time - varying coil frequency @xmath0 , can transfer energy to multiple devices even when most of the time @xmath1 . ]",
    "we follow the description of the coupled mode theory in the context of wireless energy transfer as described in detail by kurs _",
    "the interaction between two coils , in the strong - coupling regime , is described by the coupled - mode theory , through the following set of two differential equations @xcite : @xmath2 = \\left[% \\begin{array}{cc } \\omega_{s}(t ) -i\\gamma_{s } & \\kappa ( t ) \\\\ \\kappa ( t ) & \\omega_{d}(t ) -i\\gamma_{d}-i\\gamma_{w}%",

    "@xmath7 and @xmath8  are the intrinsic loss rates ( due to absorption and radiation ) of the source and the drain coils , respectively , and the extraction of work from the device is described by the term @xmath9 .",
    "the intrinsic frequencies of the source and drain coils are @xmath10 and @xmath11 ; these are given explicitly as @xmath12 where @xmath13 and @xmath14 are the inductance and the capacitance , respectively , of the source and the drain coils .",
    "the coupling coefficient between the two coils reads @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the mutual inductance of the two coils .",
    "the source coil is a part of the driving circuit and is periodically recharged , while the energy is transferred wirelessly to the device coil .",
    "the dynamics of such process in the case of static ( time independent ) resonance frequencies , as describe in ref .",

    "[ wireless dynamics ] ( top ) .    the evolution of eq .",
    "( [ wireless equations ] ) is connected to the dynamics of the schrdinger equation for a two - state atom written in the rotating - wave approximation @xcite .",
    "the variables @xmath17 and @xmath18 can be identified as the probability amplitudes for the ground state ( corresponding to the source ) and the excited state ( corresponding to the drain ) , respectively .",
    "the coupling between the coils are analogous to the coupling coefficient of the two - state atom ( also known as the rabi frequency ) , which is proportional to the atomic transition dipole moment @xmath19 and the laser electric field amplitude @xmath20 : @xmath21 @xcite .",
    "the difference between the resonant frequencies of the two coils corresponds to the detuning @xmath22 in the two - state atom : @xmath23 .",
    "the power transfer method was demonstrated for the resonant case of @xmath24 , which is the case of @xmath25 in atomic physics .",
    "however , the power transmitted between the coils drops sharply as the system is detuned from resonance , i.e. for the case of @xmath26 .",
    "also , any time dependent dynamics or change of coupling strengths between the coils can results in lower energy transfer between the coils .",
    "in the following , we develop a systematic framework of the adiabatic criteria in the context of wireless energy transfer .",
    "the technique of adiabatic passage was successfully implemented in other research fields , such as nuclear magnetic resonance ( nmr ) @xcite , interaction of coherent light with two level atoms @xcite , or in sum frequency conversion techniques in nonlinear optics @xcite .",
    "this dynamical solution requires a time - dependent intrinsic frequency change of the source coil @xmath10 .",
    "the variation of the frequency should be adiabatic ( very slow ) compared to the internal dynamics of the system that is determined by the coupling coefficient .",
    "we will first assume that the loss rates @xmath7 , @xmath8 and @xmath27 are zero and write eq .",
    "( [ wireless equations ] ) in the so - called _ adiabatic basis _",
    "@xcite ( for the two - state atom this is the basis of the instantaneous eigenstates of the hamiltonian ) : @xmath28 = \\left [ \\begin{array}{cc } -\\varepsilon ( t ) & i\\dot{\\vartheta}(t ) \\\\",

    "mathematically , adiabatic evolution means that the non - diagonal terms in eq .",
    "are small compared to the diagonal terms and can be neglected .",
    "this restriction amounts to the following _ adiabatic condition _ on the process parameters @xcite :    @xmath36^{3/2}.\\ ] ]    hence adiabatic evolution requires a smooth time dependence of the coupling @xmath37 and the detuning @xmath22 , long interaction time , and large coupling and/or large detuning . in the adiabatic regime @xmath38 , but the energy contained in the source and the drain coil @xmath39 will _ vary _ if the mixing angle @xmath40 varies ; thus adiabatic evolution can produce energy transfer between the two coils .    if the detuning @xmath41 sweeps slowly from some large negative value to some large positive value ( or vice versa ) , then the mixing angle @xmath42 changes from @xmath43 to @xmath44 ( or vice versa ) . with the energy initially in the first coil , the system will stay adiabatically in @xmath45and thus the energy will end up in the second coil .",
    "therefore the detuning sweep ( i.e. the frequency chirp ) will produce complete energy transfer .",
    "furthermore , ap is not restricted to the shape of the coupling @xmath46 and the detuning @xmath22 as far as the condition is fulfilled and the mixing angle @xmath40 changes from @xmath47 to 0 ( or vice versa ) .",
    "the variation of the detuning @xmath48 can be achieved by changing the capacitance ( or the inductance ) of one , or the two coils .",
    "the time variation of the coupling @xmath46 can be achieved , for example , with the rotation of one coil ( or two coils ) , thereby changing the geometry and thus the mutual inductance @xmath16 of the two coils .",

    "when the loss rates are nonzero , the dynamics become more complicated and more realistic .",
    "nevertheless , the essence of ap remains largely intact , if one follow another important constraint , @xmath58which states that the coupling coefficient also should be larger than the loss rates , and that the initial and final detunings are larger than the coupling coefficient @xcite .",
    "the physical reasoning behind it is that the dynamics should be faster then the damping rates that exist in the system ( mainly on the device ) and not only adiabatic . in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] we compare the resonant ( static ) and adiabatic mechanisms , without losses ( left frames ) and with losses ( right frames ) . for the numerics , we used the following coupling and detuning for the resonant case :    [ resonance ] @xmath59    and for the adiabatic mechanism :    [ ap ] @xmath60    where for our simulations we set @xmath61 @xmath62 . as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] the energy in the static case oscillates back and forth between the two coils . in ap ,",
    "once the energy is transferred to the drain coil it stays there .",
    "this feature of ap is used to minimize the energy losses from the source coil .",
    "we see that when following the adiabatic constraints , the ap process outperforms the static resonant method .",
    "to describe the efficiency of the proposed technique we use the efficiency coefficient @xmath63 , which is the ratio between the work extracted from the drain for the time interval @xmath64 divided by the total energy ( absorbed and radiated ) for the same time interval , @xmath65 in the static steady state case , the efficiency reads @xcite @xmath66        as can be seen from eq .",
    ", in order to maximize @xmath67 , one should reduce the time that the energy stays in the source coil .",
    "this can not be obtained in the resonant ( static ) case , because the energy oscillates back and forth between the source and the drain coils .",
    "nevertheless , in the ap mechanism , there is only one transition between the source and the device , so it should be chosen to be as early as possible .",
    "the ap dynamics ( or any other time - dependent dynamics ) should also repeat itself after some repetition time @xmath68 .",
    "this is illustrated in fig .",
    "the time scale is of the order of several `` loss times '' ( equal to @xmath69 ) , in this way we ensure that each cycle of coil charging begins , after the consumption of all the energy from the previous cycle , otherwise interference appears , which will be difficult to be predicted analytically . for the propose ap technique",
    "we assume that energy is instantly loaded into the source coil without loss in the beginning of each cycle .",
    "another important measurement is the amount of energy transferred from the source coil to the device , which is the useful energy consumed as a function of time .",
    "this measurement is in fact equal to the nominator in eq .  .",
    "( right y - axes ) and the useful energy consumed ( left y - axes ) as a function of the static detuning .",

    "in order to compare ap and the static mechanisms for energy transfer , several sets of simulations were performed , measuring both conversion efficiency and total energy consumed by the device :    * comparison between efficiencies as a function of the detuning , for different distances between the coils ( determined by the ratio @xmath78 ) ; * influence of variations in the coupling and the loss coefficients ; * robustness of the adiabatic energy transfer , for time - dependent coupling coefficient .",
    "first , the effect of different resonant frequency between the source coil and the device coil on the total wireless transfer efficiency were examined . for",
    "that we changed only the resonance frequency of the device in each numerical run , for two different distances between the coils : 0.8 meter and 1 meter between the coils ( where we used the same units and notations as reported in ref .",
    "@xcite ) . fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] shows that ap is less sensitive to the static detuning @xmath79 .",
    "as can be shown , the maximal conversion efficiency is achieved for the resonance approach is symmetric about zero detuning , while ap is asymmetric with its maximal efficiency value shifted toward the positive detuning .",
    "the explanation is that then the energy transfer occurs at early stage and therefore the energy stays less time in the source coil .",
    "next , we examine the effect of different coupling and loss coefficients .",
    "[ fig5 ] shows contour plots of the efficiency coefficient @xmath67 as a function of the coupling @xmath80 and the loss rate of the source and the drain coils ( where we assumed @xmath81 ) , where we assume fix values of @xmath9 ( i.e. can not be changed for different value of coupling and loss coefficients ) .",
    "the upper frame presents results for the ap technique , while the lower frame is for the static method .",
    "ap is obviously more robust to the change in the parameter values compared to the static method .",
    "the scheme proposed here , which does not require feedback control , is therefore an alternative to the scheme suggested in @xcite .",
    "we also wanted to check the effect of time - dependent coupling to the dynamics of energy transfer , which is a more realistic modelling to the process . when the detuning is varied between the two coils , the coupling changes as well (",
    "can be inferred from eq .  ) .",
    "the maximal coupling coefficient value is expected to be obtained when the detuning is zero .",
    "for that , we chose the following time dependent detuning and coupling coefficient , respectively :    [ shapes time dependent ] @xmath82 where for our simulations we set @xmath61 @xmath62 .",

    "in conclusion , we have shown that the technique of adiabatic passage , which is well known in quantum optics and nuclear magnetic resonance , has analog in the wireless energy transfer process between two circuites .",
