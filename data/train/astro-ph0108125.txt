    "the scenario described by equation ( [ eq : fq ] ) applies when the neutron star crust and atmosphere resemble that of a cooling neutron star  that is , the temperature decreases with increasing radius . for ns transients with short outbursts , such as aql  x-1 ( @xmath21 ) ,",
    "this is a good approximation , as the increase in crust s temperature from the heating during the outburst is small @xcite .",

    "the duration of its most recent outburst is of the order of ( or longer than ) the thermal diffusion timescale in the crust ( bbr98 ) . in a sense ,  in quiescence resembles a neutron star that accreted steadily at the _ outburst _ accretion rate , except that the core temperature will be at the lower value set by the time - averaged accretion rate ( over the previous @xmath22 ) .",
    "to illustrate how the crust is so dramatically heated during a long outburst , consider the rise in temperature if no heat were conducted away from the crust during the outburst . as we describe in ",

    "the total amount of heat deposited is @xmath25 and so , _ if no heat is conducted away from the heating region _ , the temperature there can rise to @xmath26  k during the 13  year outburst . even when thermal conduction is taken into account , the rise in crust temperature can still be @xmath27 , which is the typical temperature the crust and core would have if  accreted steadily at @xmath28  yr@xmath24 ( for @xmath29 yr ; see ",
    "[ sec : core ] ) .",
    "if the crust , which is composed of the ashes of h / he burning , has a low thermal conductivity , then there is a substantial temperature gradient between crust and core . as discussed by for the case of steadily accreting neutron stars , when there is a substantial thermal gradient in the inner crust , the temperature of the crust reaction layers becomes decoupled from that of the core .    for the ns in ,",
    "this means that , until the crust has thermally relaxed , we can not directly infer its core temperature , as is possible for short - outburst transients such as .",
    "however , this also means that one can directly compute the current quiescent luminosity from  using the fluence during the last outburst , as the thermal state of the crust is only weakly sensitive to the temperature of the core , and , hence , is nearly independent of the uncertainty in the accretion history over the past @xmath30  yrs ( the thermal time of the core ) , unlike in the case of short - outburst transients .",
    "our simulations , presented here , predict a quiescent luminosity which agrees with the observed value to within observational and theoretical uncertainties ( factor of a few ) for the fiducial value of @xmath5 and outburst fluence .",
    "moreover , this dependence of the thermal flux in the crust - dominated regime on @xmath31 , and not on @xmath32 , allows us to predict the evolution of @xmath33 , which can be directly confronted with observations .",
    "the domination of the quiescent luminosity by the cooling crust sets  apart from the other neutron star transients with short duration outbursts and makes it an ideal laboratory for separately measuring the thermal properties of the crust .",

    "we also produced a power - density spectrum to search for a pulsed signal ( number of frequency bins : 12750 , with frequency resolution of 5 hz , and a nyquist frequency of 0.625 hz ; see ) , using barycentered toas ( tool _ axbary _ ) .",
    "no evidence for a pulsed signal is found : the largest leahy - normalized power @xcite was 20.37 ( with a probability of chance occurrence from a poisson - distributed countrate of 0.48 ) .",
    "the absence of a coherent signal is not surprising in light of the detection of pulsations during type - i x - ray bursts @xcite at @xmath1580 hz , well above our nyquist frequency .",

    "the best - fit models were all statistically acceptable ; the parameters are given in table  [ tab : fits ] .    while all models we investigated are statistically acceptable , some can be argued against on physical grounds .",
    "the pure power - law spectrum is unusually steep ( @xmath35=5.20.6 ) , typical more of a thermal spectrum than other processes .",

    "our best - fit blackbody spectrum is consistent with that found by .    as pointed out by bbr98 , for accretion rates 2 @xmath37yr , gravity stratifies metals in the ns atmosphere faster than they can be provided by accretion ( bildsten , salpeter , & wasserman ) , making a pure h atmosphere the appropriate description of the ns photosphere in quiescence . due to the strongly energy - dependent opacity of free - free transitions , these spectra are significantly different from black - bodies @xcite . unlike the results from black - body fits , the inferred ns radii ( = @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the proper radius , and @xmath40 means the value as measured by a distant observer ) of the four observed field transients using h atmosphere spectra are consistent with what are expected theoretically : @xmath112 km ( 4 , ; , ;",
    "1608 - 522 ; and 4u 2129 + 47 ) , thus supporting the notion that much of the emission originates from a neutron star surface .",
    "the quiescent spectrum for qnss is thus interpreted as thermal emission from a pure hydrogen atmosphere ns , possibly with an underlying power - law ( whose origin is not understood ) which dominates the spectrum at high ( @xmath413 kev ) energies ( see rutledge ) .",
    "the spectral fit for a h atmosphere spectrum alone ( no power - law ) gives @xmath42=12030 ev , an emission area radius of = 10 ( d/8 kpc ) km , and an unabsorbed flux of 1.8 ( 0.5 - 10 kev ; the absorbed flux is 3.8 ) , corresponding to a luminosity of @xmath431.4 ( d/ 8)@xmath14 ( 0.5 - 10 kev ) .",

    "when we include an underlying power - law with all parameters free , the s / n of the spectrum does not constrain the model parameters to better than an order of magnitude .",

    "this estimate is similar to the one arrived at independently by , although our estimated mean recurrence time is longer ( 1500 0.5 dex yr vs.  200 yr ) , since our time - averaged outburst flux is a factor of six greater than that assumed by .    strictly speaking ,",
    "this estimate of @xmath13 is the recurrence time to an outburst of comparable fluence .",
    "a month - long outburst would have just 1%  of the fluence of the previous outburst and would not affect the estimate of eq .",
    "( [ eq : rec ] ) .",
    "this estimate also neglects any neutrino emission , which reduces the effective value of @xmath5 and hence @xmath13 .",
    "more seriously , however , this analysis ignores the fact that the crust is strongly perturbed away from the core equilibrium temperature during such a long outburst . as a result",
    ", the quiescent emission currently observed is set by the thermal relaxation of the heated crust , and as we now demonstrate , is mostly decoupled from the thermal state of the core .      during an outburst , the heating from the reactions raises the temperature in the crust around the reaction layers .",
    "after the outburst ends , the crust thermally relaxes and the thermal profile comes to resemble a cooling neutron star , i.e. , the temperature decreases with radius . for neutron star transients with `` typical '' outburst fluences and recurrence times ( that is , @xmath66  month , with an outburst luminosity @xmath67   eddington ) , the variations in the crust temperature and hence @xmath68 are small ( bbr98 ; ur01 ) . for example , ur01 found that @xmath68 varied by @xmath1  few% for @xmath69  yr and by @xmath1  30% for @xmath70",
    "the variation is small because the amount of energy deposited in such short outbursts is not significant compared to the heat content of the crust , and so the crust is not heated substantially compared to its temperature when in thermal equilibrium with the core .      to ascertain the magnitude of the deviation of @xmath33 from the value predicted by eq .",
    "( [ eq : brown ] ) , we performed several simulations of thermal relaxation of the ns crust in a transient with observational properties ( @xmath12 , @xmath13 , @xmath72 ) inferred for  using the methods and microphysics as described in ur01 . in summary , we solve the non - relativistic heat equation in the crust , from @xmath73  g  @xmath74 to @xmath75  g  @xmath74 .",
    "heating due to nuclear reactions in the deep crust is simulated by depositing energy at densities corresponding to the nuclear transitions computed by , with the amount of energy set by the instantaneous accretion rate . at the outer boundary ,",
    "we use the flux - temperature relation for a fully accreted crust from potekhin  @xcite .",
    "the core is taken to be isothermal ( a good assumption for the timescales of interest because of the large thermal conductivity ) , and its temperature evolves according to the mismatch between its neutrino emissivity and the flux from the crust .",
    "we start our simulations with the temperature profile corresponding to persistent accretion at the rate @xmath32 corresponding to the time average of @xmath31 over the recurrence time .",
    "we then evolve the model through several outburst / quiescence cycles , as necessary for the model to `` forget '' the initial conditions and reach a limit cycle .    if the crust resembles that of a neutron star steadily accreting at @xmath31 , then the estimate of the recurrence time ( eq .  [ [ eq : rec ] ] ) is inapplicable ( except as a lower limit ) .",
    "this is because the crust temperature is decoupled from that of the core .",
    "a full survey of parameter space should include simulations over a range of @xmath13 .",
    "this is beyond the scope of this initial paper ; rather , we presume that @xmath13 is given by eq .",

    ", we examine the two main uncertainties in ns microphysics , ( 1 ) the impurity fraction , and , hence , the conductivity of the crust and ( 2 ) the possible presence of `` enhanced '' core neutrino cooling mechanisms , such as direct urca or pion condensation .",
    "first , the composition of accreting ns crusts is set by the nuclear processing of products of burning in the upper atmosphere .",
    "published calculations @xcite presume that burning proceeds to pure iron , and , hence , the crust has no impurities .",
    "however , recent work by schatz and collaborators @xcite shows that burning products are a mix of elements substantially heavier than iron , with the impurity parameter of the elements of the mix from the average charge @xmath76 , @xmath77 , where the average takes into account the relative abundance of the species . ]",
    "@xmath78 comparable to the square of the average nuclear charge @xmath79 .",

    "we refer to these two cases as `` low @xmath81 '' and `` high @xmath81 '' , respectively .",
    "second , the uncertainty in core cooling is covered by simulations with `` standard cooling '' and `` enhanced cooling '' ( modified urca appropriately suppressed by nucleon superfluidity , and neutrino emission as when the core is a pion condensate , respectively ; see ur01 for details ) .    to illustrate the deviation of the crustal temperature from the equilibrium core temperature and the subsequent thermal relaxation of the crust",
    ", we show in fig .",
    "[ fig : tevol ] the time evolution of the crustal temperature in the low @xmath81 , standard cooling case for observational parameters inferred for  ( @xmath82 yr , @xmath83 yr , and @xmath84  yr@xmath24 ) . vertical slices of the surface in the density - temperature plane show the instantaneous temperature distribution in the crust , while slices in the time - temperature plane show the time evolution of the temperature since the beginning of the outburst . clearly , the crust is heated to well above its pre - outburst temperature profile , which tracks the core temperature ( note that , because the crust is heated to well above its temperature in equilibrium with the core , this qualitative result is not very sensitive to the assumed @xmath13 ) .",
    "a steep temperature gradient carries most of the heat from the deep crustal heating region around @xmath85  g  @xmath74 into the core , while a shallower temperature gradient carries a fraction of the heat towards the surface .",
    "the temperature near the top of the crust ( @xmath1 g cm ; and , hence , the x - ray luminosity , @xmath86 ; ) reaches a maximum at the end of the outburst ( time=13  years ) , and then decays back to the pre - outburst value on the thermal timescale of the crust ( @xmath87  yrs for this model ) .",
    "thermal evolution in other cases is similar ( but , of course , is different in the absolute magnitude of the temperature change ) , and the temperature changes are always much bigger than those that occur during short - duration outbursts ( cf.fig .  1 of ur01 ) .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : greg ] , we show the long - term evolution of the quiescent surface luminosity from  after accretion onto the compact object has ceased for the four cases discussed above , namely , low and high crustal conductivity @xmath81 , and standard and enhanced core neutrino emission ( see the legend on the plot ) .",

    "[ fig : greg]a , where we set @xmath88 .",
    "in all four cases , the transition from crust - dominated ( at early times ) to core - dominated cooling ( at late times ) is evident as a drop in the luminosity , ranging from 50% ( high @xmath81 , standard cooling case ) to a factor of @xmath89 ( low @xmath81 , enhanced cooling case ) .",
    "regardless of the core neutrino emissivity , this transition occurs at @xmath87  yrs for low conductivity crusts , and after @xmath90  yr for high conductivity crusts .",
    "these timescales are easy to understand , as they are just the thermal time to the appropriate depth in the crust ( cf . figure 3 of ur01 ) .",
    "since the low @xmath81 crust has a longer thermal time , it stays hot about 30 times longer than the high @xmath81 crust .",
    "after the crust thermally relaxes , @xmath33 is set by the emission from a hot core .",
    "if the only core neutrino emission mechanism is modified urca , suppressed by nucleon superfluidity , then the amount of heat lost by neutrinos from the core is negligible .",

    "( [ eq : brown ] ) , with @xmath91 ( see solid and dashed lines in fig .  [",

    "( [ eq : brown ] ) , in the sense of the energy retained in the star and re - radiated thermally , is @xmath94 .",
    "as shown above , the crust is heated to well above the core temperature during the long outburst .",
    "how does the temperature difference between the crust and the core depend on the crustal conductivity ? as an estimate",
    ", we can assume that , during the outburst , the crust comes to an equilibrium where the heat deposited around @xmath95  g  @xmath74 at a rate @xmath96 is conducted away from this region .",

    "thermal balance then requires @xmath99 , or @xmath100  k  @xmath101 , where @xmath102 is the conductivity in units of @xmath103  erg  cm@xmath24  s@xmath24k . in the low conductivity case , @xmath105 , so @xmath106 .",
    "we see from fig .",
    "[ fig : greg]a that @xmath33 at early times in the low @xmath81 case is the same for standard and enhanced cooling ( solid and dotted lines ) .",

    "this situation is exactly the same as for persistent accreters discussed by brown  @xcite . on the other hand , for high conductivity crusts , @xmath107 , so @xmath108 can not significantly deviate from @xmath109 during the outburst .",

    "[ fig : greg]a , the predicted quiescent luminosity @xmath33 right after the outburst is a factor of 3 higher than the observed @xmath110 ( itself uncertain by a factor of 3 , due to spectral uncertainty ) .",
    "since @xmath33 depends directly on @xmath111 over the outburst duration , this difference could also be due to a systematic overestimate of @xmath31 during the @xmath112  yr outburst , only the last 5  years of which have been covered @xmath1  daily with rxte / asm .",
    "alternatively , this difference could be due to a value of @xmath5 different from the fiducial , since the exact value of @xmath5 is uncertain ( see schatz  1999 , 2001 for a discussion on different crustal compositions than assumed by ) . to provide lightcurves which extrapolate from the currently observed luminosity , in fig .",
    "[ fig : greg]b we adjusted @xmath5 ( or , equivalently , @xmath113 ) by factors of 0.3 to 2 , as noted in the figure caption , to obtain @xmath114  erg  s@xmath24 at the start of quiescence .",
    "we stress that the overall normalization of these lightcurves is uncertain due to uncertainty in @xmath5 and outburst fluence , but the shape is determined by the microphysics of the crust and the temperature of the core .",
    "the time evolution of the luminosity will permit distinction between the four cases , and , hence , directly infer the integrated conductivity of the crust and possibly indicate whether enhanced neutrino emission mechanisms are operating in the core .",
    "in particular , observing the drop in the luminosity will permit the measurement of the thermal timescale of the crust .",
    "in addition , the relative magnitude of the drop will tell us about the presence or absence of enhanced neutrino emission from the core .",
    "such measurements ( accurate to 10% ) are well within the capabilities of present x - ray instrumentation , as the present detection demonstrates .",
    "observations over the next year will be able to exclude the case where the crust is a pure crystal and hence has very high conductivity .",
    "since the initial understanding of type i bursts as thermonuclear flashes , there has been an open question as to how much flux is rising up from deep parts of the star into the burning region ( see ) .",
    "large values of this flux ( @xmath115 mev per accreted nucleon ) can stabilize burning at accretion rates lower than otherwise expected .",
    "first showed that most of the crustal heating in a persistent source went into the ns core and that , at most , 100 kev per accreted nucleon came out into the upper parts of the star .",
    "the quiescent observations of  shortly after outburst strongly support this picture and tell us that deep nuclear heating will not impact the type i x - ray burst behavior .    assuming that the source has been transiently accreting for the past @xmath116 or so , with outburst fluences similar to that of the most recent observed outburst",
    ", we can constrain the core temperature to be less than the maximum crust temperature . to determine the most conservative (",
    "i.e. , largest ) upper bound on this peak crust temperature , we use the following assumptions .",
    "we take the atmosphere to be composed of pure iron ( which has a higher opacity than hydrogen / helium ) and we use low thermal conductivity ( electron - ion scattering ) in the crust .",
    "these assumptions lead to the largest temperature rise between the photosphere and the crust .",
    "taking @xmath117 , we find a peak crust temperature , and hence a maximum core temperature , of @xmath118 .",
    "the large amount of heat deposited during the recent ( and the only observed ) outburst of , and the lengthy duration of the outburst compared to the thermal diffusion time of the ns crust , imply that the quiescent flux recently observed is dominated by emission from the cooling crust and not the core .",
    "the importance of this result is that the quiescent luminosity _ is calculated using the properties of only the most recent outburst _ , rather than by estimating the accretion history over the past yr , as is the case in the core - dominated transients such as  and 4@xcite .",
    "our prediction of the quiescent luminosity from the cooling crust following the outburst agrees , to within observational and theoretical uncertainties ( a factor of a few ) , with the estimate of the observed bolometric luminosity . unlike the case of the short @xmath12 transients where we can directly infer the average core temperature , in the case of  we can not measure the core temperature , and hence the recurrence time , until after the crust has thermally relaxed ( 130  yr after the end of the outburst ) . assuming that the source has been transiently accreting for the past @xmath116 or so , with outburst fluences comparable to that of the most recent outburst",
    ", we can constrain the core temperature to be less than the peak crust temperature , which , using the relation of for an iron crust ( low conductivity ) , gives @xmath119 .",
    "we predict future lightcurves for  on the basis of 4 different scenario for crustal and core microphysics ( high / low conductivity , and enhanced / normal neutrino emissivity ) .",
    "these can be distinguished from each other observationally  one in @xmath561 yr ( excluding or confirming the high @xmath81 crust with enhanced neutrino emissivity core ) , others over longer terms ( 10 - 100 yrs ) .",
    "this offers the unique opportunity to directly constrain the properties of the ns crust  thermal conductivity , heat capacity , and depth to the ns core  through monitoring observations that would measure the predicted decaying lightcurve .",
    "is now the fifth  after 4 , , 4u",
    "1608 - 522 , and 4u 2129 + 47field transient neutron star which displays in quiescence a spectrum consistent with a h atmosphere ns of radius @xmath1 12 km , and ( possibly ) a hard ( @xmath1200.85 ) power - law component which comprises 1040% of the quiescent ( 0.510  kev ) flux .  shows no variability on short ( @xmath56hours ) timescales .",
    "these spectral and variability properties are identical to those of the well - studied  and 4  @xcite , and the spectral properties are similar to those from lower s / n data of 4u  1608 - 522 and 4u  2129 + 47 @xcite .",
    "the derived radius is also comparable to that derived from this object using the independent method of a cooling radius expansion burst @xcite .",
    "it is possible that a persistent source can turn off after long periods of accretion ( here , a persistent source is one accreting for a period @xmath121 yr , the core heating timescale ) . while eq .",
    "1 would seem to be applicable to predict the post turn - off quiescent thermal luminosity from the crust , the equation assumes that all heat deposited in the crust is re - radiated during quiescence",
    ". that will not be the case for sources approaching eddington luminosity , such as , where the effect of neutrino cooling in the crust and core can not be neglected .",
    "in such cases , @xmath122 . here @xmath123 is the energy per accreted baryon emitted through the atmosphere from the crust immediately following the outburst .",
    "a minimum value , @xmath124 ev / nucleon , applies when the source accretes persistently at the eddington limit , in which only 10% of the deposited heat flows towards the surface @xcite . at lower persistent luminosities , however , the crust and core temperatures are lower and neutrino cooling in each becomes less important , so @xmath123 increases . in the case of ( @xmath125 ) , we obtain @xmath126250 ev , if  were a persistent accreter .",
    "however , the quiescent luminosity of  gives instead @xmath127 ev , a factor of 7 below the lower limit , even for a persistent source accreting at the eddington rate .",
    "this demonstrates that  can not be a persistent accreter , because its crust ( and by extension the core ) is too cool to have been accreting for @xmath121 yr .",
    "note , however , that we have neglected the effect of of neutrino emission due to cooper pairing of superfluid particles ( see for a review ) which may reduce the value of @xmath123 .",
    "as discussed by , the study of qnss in globular clusters has yielded a new way to accurately measure ns radii .",
    "the distances to some globular clusters have been determined to 2% post - hipparcos @xcite , and can be measured even more directly with sim @xcite , effectively removing distance as an uncertainty . at present , there is only one globular cluster qns in which the thermal component has been spectroscopically analyzed ( in @xmath128  cen ; ) and there are two more proposed ( in 47 tuc ; ) .",
    "measuring ns radii to an accuracy of 0.5  km  even without knowing the mass  can exclude @xmath150% of the proposed equations of state for the ns core matter @xcite . even though we presently can not make such accurate radius measurements in the field transients due to uncertain distances ( which can be overcome with sim ) , they remain important targets for detailed studies of the observational phenomena of qnss , such as we report here .",
    "the relative luminosity of the ( possible ) power - law component poses a puzzle .",
    "it has been suggested that this component is due to accretion onto the ns magnetosphere @xcite .",
    "however , such accretion would be unrelated to the quiescent luminosity of nss as predicted from deep crustal heating ( which is dominated by outburst accretion ) , and it can only be ascribed to coincidence that in the cases where adequate sensitivity is obtained , the power - law component produces a comparable fraction of the thermal flux in different sources .",
    "this suggests that the power - law component and h atmosphere spectral component are perhaps more closely related than previously thought .",
