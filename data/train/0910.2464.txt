    "we have presented a detailed analysis of the x - ray properties of submm - selected galaxies in the goods - n region . using the 2-ms _ chandra _ exposure , and accurate positions for the smgs from deep radio and _ spitzer _ imaging ,",
    "we have been able to characterise the x - ray emission of these sources and assess their agn content . for directly detected sources",
    ", we have used the x - ray spectra to determine accurate luminosities and absorption properties . for the undetected sources , we have determined the average properties by stacking .",
    "we find that the direct x - ray detection rate of submm - selected galaxies in the 2-ms _ chandra _ data is high , at @xmath10 per cent .",
    "the detected sources cover a wide range of redshifts , luminosities and x - ray - to - optical flux ratios .",
    "the x - ray detected smgs are thus heterogeneous , much like the general scuba population ( e.g.  @xcite ) . comparing their x - ray luminosities with the fir and radio luminosities ( fig .",
    "[ lx ] ) , we find that around half of the x - ray detected smgs are consistent with the x - ray emission arising purely from stellar processes .",
    "using x - ray luminosity as a proxy for sfr ( table  [ fits ] ) , the x - ray derived sfrs for these galaxies reach at least @xmath11  m@xmath12 yr@xmath13 , and possibly @xmath141000  m@xmath12  yr@xmath13 in three extreme cases . gn10",
    "( the highest redshift source in the sample ) is the most extreme example , with an x - ray luminosity of almost @xmath15  erg s@xmath13 and star formation rate close of @xmath16  m@xmath12 yr@xmath13 . while extreme , x - ray derived sfrs are subject to considerable uncertainties , especially at large sfrs ( e.g. @xcite ) , and this is fully consistent with the large sfrs calculated from the fir and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon ( pah ) luminosities ( p06 , @xcite ) .",
    "seven of the smgs show x - ray luminosities well in excess of that expected from star formation , however , and these objects almost certainly host agn .",
    "the number of unambiguous agn in our sample is @xmath17 per cent , rising to @xmath18 per cent if we include the three ambiguous cases which apparently have very high star formation rates .",
    "the agn content of these submm - selected sources is certainly very high , but the data do not indicate that strong accretion activity is universal in smgs .",
    "the very high x - ray detection rate of smgs is likely to be partially due to their very high star formation rates .",
    "furthermore , as we discuss below , at least some smgs are likely to have their fir flux powered by an agn .",
    "it is therefore unclear at this point whether the strong overlap between the smg and x - ray populations points towards a connection between intense star formation and accretion activity in these sources .",
    "our results can be compared with those of a05a , who found an even higher agn fraction than we do , concluding that black holes in smgs are growing near continuously during periods of intense star formation .",
    "the differing conclusions may seem surprising , as we have studied smgs in the same region ( goods / cdf - n ) as analyzed by a05a , and are using essentially the same x - ray data .",
    "indeed 6 ( 8) of the 16 x - ray detected smgs studied here were also in the a05a ( a05b ) samples ( table  [ sample ] ) . for the common sources",
    ", our classifcation of the origin of the x - ray emission agrees with a05a and a05b , and thus the main differences can be attributed to the selection and analysis of the submm samples .",
    "the primary difference is that we are using purely submm - selected sources ( predominantly from @xcite ) , whereas a05a use a mixture of smgs and optically faint radio sources with followup scuba photometry .",
    "the agn fraction of smgs found in this work ( @xmath7 per cent , depending on the origin of the x - ray emission in the three ambiguous sources in table  [ fits ] ) is consistent with the lower limit of the agn fraction quoted by a05a ( @xmath19  per cent ) . a05a",
    "assigned the agn fraction as a lower limit because they were only able to assess the x - ray properties of smgs with radio counterparts and spectroscopic redshifts .",
    "the smgs which were radio - undetected in the a05a sample might have been x - ray sources ( and hence agn ) , but without accurate positions they were unable to tell .",
    "as noted by a05a themselves , the radio selection can cause a potential bias in favour of selecting agn . requiring a spectroscopic identification",
    "can cause a further bias , due to the availability of uv / optical lines in agn spectra . using a deeper radio map , and _",
    "data , we have good identifications and accurate positions for the vast majority of our smgs , and we find that the high agn fraction among spectroscopically identified , radio - detected submm galaxies fails to extend to the general smg population .",
    "an additional difference worthy of note here is the submm significance threshold .",
    "@xcite applied a strict limit of @xmath20 to be considered , whereas many of the a05a smgs have lower significance .",
    "our excellent positions have enabled us , for the first time , to perform a stacking analysis of the x - ray undetected submm population .",
    "we find a very clear soft band detection , and tentative evidence for hard band emission .",
    "the mean x - ray luminosity suggests an average star formation rate of @xmath21  m@xmath12 yr@xmath13 , with the full band delivering a higher star formation rate than the soft x - ray . including the 9 smgs from table  [ fits ] that are not classified as agn dominated then the average x - ray derived sfr for the smgs is @xmath22  m@xmath12 yr@xmath13",
    "this is considerably less than the mean sfr of @xmath23  m@xmath12 yr@xmath13 estimated from the fir luminosity ( p06 ) . with the strong caveats that calibration of x - ray derived sfrs is uncertain ( especially at high sfrs ) , that the stacked signal may be due to emission from obscured agn , and that the sfrs from the fir may be overestimated",
    ", there is thus some suggestion that the smgs may host heavily obscured starbursts , with column densities exceeding @xmath24  @xmath25 .",
    "a05b presented an analysis of the x - ray spectra of the a05a sample , concluding that the majority of x - ray emitting smgs are heavily obscured , supporting the interpretation of the x - ray emission being from an agn . for our ( small ) sample of 7 smgs that we classify as agn",
    "we confirm this , and x - ray absorption appears to be an effective tool in discriminating between agn and star forming smgs .",
    "all but one ( gn01 ) of the objects we identify as an agn shows evidence for obscuration .",
    "the column densities in the others are of order @xmath26 @xmath25 .",
    "three sources are candidate compton thick objects .",
    "gn04 ( northern counterpart ) , gn19 and gn39 ( northern counterpart ) have large column densities ( @xmath27  @xmath25 ) and are well fitted by the compton reflection dominated model but the transmission model provides almost as good a fit . on the other hand ,",
    "overall the x - ray detected sources in our sample show far less evidence for widespread x - ray absorption than was found by a05b . from the distributions of effective photon index ( fig .",
    "[ gamma_hist ] ) it is clear that smgs in our sample have , on average , larger values of @xmath28 than those in a05b . the k - s probability that the two samples are drawn from the same underlying galaxy distribution is 0.02 . excluding the 8 sources common to both samples , which are selected from the same galaxy population ( see table  [ sample ] for details ) , the probability that the two samples are drawn from the same distribution is 0.005 .",
    "we conclude that the majority ( @xmath29 per cent ) of x - ray emitting smgs are unobscured , consistent with the interpretation that the x - ray emission is from stellar processes .",
    "our x - ray spectral analysis can be used to estimate the possible contribution of an agn to the submm emission . for unobscured or compton thin agn",
    "this is relatively straightforward , albeit subject to substantial uncertainty .",
    "in such cases the absorption - corrected x - ray luminosity in , say , the 2@xmath30kev rest frame band , can be converted using a bolometric correction and compared to the fir luminosity .",
    "the bolometric correction from 2@xmath30kev has been discussed extensively in the literature ( e.g.  @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "there is a very wide range of bolometric corrections , and suggestions that it depends on luminosity ( e.g.  @xcite ; @xcite ) and/or eddington ratio @xcite .",
    "the ` canonical ' value of @xcite is @xmath31 , but the range given by @xcite covers approximately one order of magnitude @xmath32150 . adopting the @xcite correction , we find that the bolometric luminosity is dominated ( @xmath14 50  per cent contribution ) by an agn in just one of the smgs , that being gn04 . if the upper end of the possible @xmath33 is used then the bolometric luminosities of gn19 and gn39 might also be agn dominated ( fig .",
    "[ bol_lum ] ) .",
    "apparently , agn make little contribution to the total submm power in the overall population .",
    "on the other hand , one could hypothesise  as has been argued by e.g.  a05b  that many submm sources might harbour very heavily obscured , compton thick agn .",
    "using our reflection model fits , it has been possible to estimate the agn contribution to the luminosity even in sources where we find no evidence for agn activity .",
    "the key point is that a luminous agn should be revealed via a compton scattered x - ray continuum , even when the direct continuum is obscured from view .",
    "such a compton reflection component , with accompanying intense iron k@xmath34 line emission , is a defining characteristic of compton thick agn in the local universe ( e.g.  @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the lack of such a component in the majority of spectra in our sample limits the possible contribution of an agn to the submm typically to between 110  per cent , assuming the @xcite bolometric correction .",
    "the exceptions are the three objects noted above . taking the estimates of the maximum possible contribution allowed by the spectral fits , and the most extreme bolometric correction",
    ", we find that gn25 and gn40 might also have as much as 50  per cent of their submm emission powered by the agn ( fig .",
    "[ bol_lum ] ) . for compton reflection dominated objects ,",
    "such estimates are very uncertain , as the geometry of the reflecting medium ( including the degree of self - obscuration ) is not well known , and this will strongly affect the strength of the reflection signatures .",
    "overall , however , we can conclude reasonably robustly that around 85  per cent of smgs have their fir emission dominated by star formation , whether or not an agn is present .    an alternative way of diagnosing the presence of an agn and its contribution to the fir emission is via mid - ir spectroscopy .",
    "@xcite , @xcite and @xcite have analysed ir spectroscopy of more than 40 smgs , a few of which overlap with the sample analysed here .",
    "these works showed that the bolometric luminosity of most smgs is starburst dominated and that mid - ir dominant agn in smgs are rarely found : only 1517 per cent of smgs are dominated by an agn in the mid - ir @xcite .",
    "for the sources common to this sample , the mid - ir spectral diagnostics generally agree with the x - ray diagnostics .",
    "the exceptions being gn19 and gn39 which are both clear agn from the x - ray but are starburst dominated based on their mid - ir spectral properties @xcite .",
    "kev luminosity for the x - ray detected smgs against fir bolometric luminosity .",
    "the fir bolometric luminosities and the symbols are the same as in fig .",
    "the lower values of the x - ray luminosities are our best estimate of the intrinsic luminosities for each source , calculated for the best - fitting model ( model a , b or c ) , as given in table  [ models ] .",
    "the upper values for the x - ray luminosities are the maximum intrinsic values allowed by the reflection model ( model b , table  [ modelb ] ) and represent the maximum possible agn contribution.the diagonal lines indicate an agn - to - fir bolometric luminosity ratio of 0.5 for 2 - 10 kev bolometric corrections of @xmath35  and @xmath36 . for sources lying in the shaded region above the lines the total bolometric luminosity is agn dominated ( @xmath37 per cent contribution ) .",
    "the five agn where the bolometric luminosity could be agn dominated are identified . ,",
    "we have presented an estimate of the agn fraction and x - ray spectral properties of submm - selected galaxies in the goods - n field , based on the deep ( 2ms ) _ chandra _ observation .",
    "while smgs show a high x - ray detection fraction ( @xmath1  per cent ) , and also agn fraction ( @xmath7  per cent ) , the latter is more modest compared to some previous estimates .",
    "most x - ray detected smgs have low x - ray luminosity and are unobscured , so are probably dominated by stellar emission in the x - ray . on the other hand , the ( minority ) agn smgs are obscured with moderate column densities , and we find three candidate compton thick objects .",
    "we have estimated the agn contribution to the bolometric luminosity and find only three objects in our sample in which accretion is the dominant power source .",
    "the x - ray spectra therefore indicate that star formation dominates the fir emission in at least @xmath3885  per cent of the submm population , in agreement with mid - ir spectral diagnostics .",
    "overall , we conclude that while intense , coeval star formation and intense accretion is undoubtedly present in some smgs , this behaviour is far from universal , with only around 1015  per cent of the population showing clear evidence for this mode of activity .",
