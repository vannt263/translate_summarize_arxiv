    "planets form in circumstellar disks . in the standard scenario ,",
    "formation of earth - size planets or planetary cores occurs through coagulation of small dust particles ( e.g. , weidenschilling & cuzzi 1993 ) .",
    "thus , the total amount , radial density distribution , and size distribution of dust particles in the disks are the important initial conditions of planet formation . in many of the previous studies of planet formation ,",
    "the dust - gas ratio of circumstellar disks is assumed to be similar to the solar value ( @xmath6 ) , and dust particles are considered to be well mixed with gas , i.e. , the dust - gas ratio is constant throughout the disk ( hayashi , nakazawa , & nakagawa 1985 ) .",
    "however , the motion of dust particles is different from that of gas .",
    "dust particles have a radial motion which is induced by the gas drag force .",
    "adachi , hayashi , & nakazawa ( 1976 ) and weidenschilling ( 1977 ) studied the motion of particles in gas disks . due to radially outward pressure gradient force",
    ", the rotation velocity of the gas is generally slower than particles on nearly keplerian circular orbits .",
    "consequently , the gas drag force takes angular momentum from particles , resulting in their inward migration ( whipple 1972 ) . at a few au from the central star , the orbital decay time",
    "is estimated to be @xmath7 for @xmath8 particles and @xmath9 for @xmath10 particles .",
    "these times are much shorter than the life time of gas disks ( @xmath11 ) .",
    "thus , dust component may evolve much faster than the gas in protostellar disks , in which case , the dust - gas ratio would decline .",
    "it appears that the initial conditions of planet formation need not to be protostellar disks in which dust particles are well mixed with the gas and the dust - gas ratio is constant .    in this paper",
    ", we start a series of studies to determine the initial distribution of dust particles in the context of planet formation . here , we study the radial migration of dust particles in gas disks .",
    "we focus our attention on particles smaller than @xmath12 in order to consider evolution of dust disks before the initiation of planetesimal formation .",
    "the migration of these small particles establishes the initial density distribution of the dust component and sets the stage for planetesimal formation . in this phase of disk evolution ,",
    "the gas component is considered to be turbulent and is accreting onto the star . the discussion in the above paragraph is based on the study of particle migration under the assumption that particles have completely sedimented on the midplane of laminar disks .",
    "however , in turbulent disks , the sedimentation of particles is prevented , because particles are stirred up to high altitude from the midplane by turbulent gas motion . in such disks ,",
    "particles are distributed in the vertical direction , and the radial motion of particles depends on the distance from the midplane .",
    "thus , there is a need for studying the radial migration of particles which reside above the midplane .",
    "there are two important factors causing the vertical variation in the migration velocity of particles .",
    "the first is the variation of rotation velocity of the gas in the vertical direction .",
    "as mentioned above , the gas rotation differs from the keplerian rotation because of the gas pressure gradient . as the gas density decreases with the distance from the midplane , the radial pressure gradient varies and under some circumstances even changes its sign . while at the midplane the pressure gradient force is outward",
    ", it is inward near the disk surface because the disk thickness increases with the radius .",
    "the gas drag force on particles also varies with the height , resulting in a variation of particle migration velocities . in  [ sec : vrd ] , we will see that particles at high altitude , where the pressure gradient force is inward , flow outward .",
    "the second factor is the variation in the radial gas flow .",
    "small particles ( @xmath0 ) are well coupled to the gas , so that they migrate with the gas flow , as discussed in ",
    "[ sec : vrd ] below . that is",
    "if the gas is accreted onto the star , the small particles would also be accreted , while if the gas flows outward , particle flow would also be outward .",
    "in accreting protostellar disks , the gas does not always flow radially inward .",
    "radial velocity of the gas varies with the distance from the midplane .",
    "viscous stress can cause gas outflow near the midplane ( urpin 1984 ; kley & lin 1992 ) .",
    "ryczka , bodenheimer , & bell ( 1994 ) showed that the outflow occurs if the radial pressure gradient at the midplane is steep enough .",
    "the density ( or pressure ) gradient at the midplane is steeper than the average spatial ( or surface ) density gradient , e.g. , if the surface density varies as @xmath13 and the disk thickness varies as @xmath14 , the midplane density has a steeper variation corresponding to @xmath15 .",
    "viscous diffusion at the midplane causes the outflow of the gas to reduce the steep density gradient . on the other hand , at high altitude from the midplane , the density gradient is shallow and the viscous torque causes the usual inward flow .",
    "thus , in accretion disks , the outward flow at the midplane is sandwiched by the inflow at the disk surfaces ( see  [ sec : vrg ] for details ) .",
    "because small particles are carried by the gas flow , they are expected to flow outward near the midplane , and inward at higher altitude .",
    "thus , if most of dust particles concentrate in the region where they migrate outward , i.e. , near the disk surface or around the midplane , the dust component of the disk would accumulate in total mass and expand in size .",
    "in reality , the vertical spatial distribution of particles is determined by the degree of sedimentation , and their size distribution is regulated by the coagulation , condensation , and sublimation processes . in this paper , we calculate the vertical distribution of particles in order to identify the mass flux of the dust particles as functions of their size and their distance from the midplane and their host stars . the results of the present calculation will be used to study the long term dynamical evolution of the dust component of the disk . for the present task , we do not consider the effects of gas depletion , particles size evolution or their feedback influence on the flow velocity of the gas .",
    "these effects will be considered in a future investigation .",
    "there are several works on the particle migration in turbulent disks .",
    "stepinski & valageas ( 1997 ) derived the vertically averaged velocity of migration for two limiting cases .",
    "one model is constructed for small particles which are well mixed with the gas and the other is for large particles which are totally sedimented to the midplane .",
    "the velocity for intermediate sized particles is calculated by the interpolation of these limiting cases .",
    "supulver & lin ( 2000 ) investigated the evolution of particle orbits in turbulent disks numerically .",
    "this paper gives analytical expression of the particle velocity for any size of particles , which are estimated from interpolation by stepinski & valageas ( 1997 ) .",
    "several studies showed that vortices or turbulent eddies can trap particles within some size range ( barge & sommeria 1995 ; cuzzi , dobrovolskis , & hogan 1996 ; tanga et al .",
    "1996 ; klahr & henning 1997 ; cuzzi et al .",
    "2001 , see however hodgson & brandenburg 1998 ) .",
    "particle trapping by eddies may be important for local collection of size - sorted particles . in this paper , turbulent eddies",
    "are treated just as a source of the particle diffusion and of the gas viscosity .",
    "the effect of particle trapping on their coagulation is not discussed here .",
    "the plan of the paper is as follows . in  2 , the vertical variation of gas flow is derived . in  3 ,",
    "we describe how the radial velocity of dust particles varies in the vertical direction , and then calculate the net radial migration velocity . in  4 ,",
    "we discuss the steady distribution of particles assuming no particle growth .",
    "we show that the size fractionation of particles occurs as a result of radial migration , and that the distribution of particles differs from that of the gas .",
    "gas disks rotate with a slightly different velocity from the keplerian velocity .",
    "the rotation velocity is determined by the balance between the stellar gravity , the centrifugal force , and the gas pressure gradient . in cylindrical coordinates @xmath16 ,",
    "the balance of the forces described by the momentum equation in the @xmath17-direction is given by @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the angular rotation velocity of the gas , @xmath20 is the gravitational constant , @xmath21 is the stellar mass , @xmath22 is the gas density , and @xmath23 is the gas pressure . the density distribution in the vertical direction is determined by the balance between the @xmath24-components of the stellar gravity and the pressure gradient , which is written as @xmath25 we assume that the disk is isothermal in the vertical direction . neglecting @xmath26 and higher order terms , the vertical density distribution is obtained as @xmath27 the disk scale height @xmath28 is given by @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the isothermal sound speed , and @xmath31 is the keplerian angular velocity at the midplane .",

    "the left hand side is the variation of the angular momentum of the annulus accompanying with the motion .",
    "we assume that the angular velocity is always adjusted to the equilibrium ( eq .",
    "[ [ eq : omegag ] ] ) on a dynamical time scale .",
    "since molecular viscosity is too ineffective , it is customary to assume that angular momentum is primarily transported by the reynolds stress induced by the turbulent motion of the gas .",
    "following conventional practice , we adopt an _ ad hoc _ but simple to use @xmath45 prescription for turbulent viscosity ( shakura & sunyaev 1973 ) , such that @xmath46 the mass conservation of the gas is @xmath47 in accretion disks considered here , the second term is the same order of the third term .",

    "these values correspond to a minimum mass solar nebula whose surface density distribution has a power law form with index @xmath59 and has a gas mass @xmath60 inside 100au .",
    "figure [ fig : vrg ] shows the radial velocity of the gas .",
    "the radial velocity is outward ( positive ) near the midplane , while it is inward ( negative ) above the height @xmath61 . in the standard model ( @xmath57 ) ,",
    "the radial velocity is independent of the distance from the star , as seen from equation ( [ eq : vrg ] ) . at the midplane ,",
    "the radial gradient of the gas density is so steep ( @xmath56 ) that the gas receives more torque from the inner disk than the torque it exerts on the outer disk .",
    "this radial dependence means that viscous stress acts to move the gas outward in such a steep density gradient .",
    "the condition for the outward gas flow at the midplane is @xmath62 which is satisfied in many accretion disk models .",
    "the rotation of the gas is slower at higher altitude as seen in equation ( [ eq : omegag ] ) .",
    "thus , the gas at the midplane loses its angular momentum through the action of viscous stress it has with the gas at higher altitude .",
    "however , in the standard model , this angular momentum loss is smaller than the angular momentum gain through the viscous stress in the @xmath17-direction .",
    "the outflow zone around the midplane shrinks as the radial density gradient is reduced ( @xmath63 ) , and when the condition ( [ eq : condoutflow ] ) is violated , gas at all altitudes flows inward .",
    "the radial density gradient is shallower at higher altitude , because the disk scale height increases with the radius .",
    "thus , at high altitude , the gas loses more angular momentum through exerting torque on the outer disk than it is receiving from the inner disk . for such gas",
    ", the presence of viscous torque induces it to flow towards the star .",
    "the net radial velocity of the gas is given by averaging in the vertical direction : @xmath64 the net accretion of the gas toward the star occurs if @xmath65 we may consider two models in which a steady state is achieved .",
    "one model is the case in which the net radial velocity is zero , i.e. , @xmath66 .",

    "the sedimentation is controlled by coupling of particles to the turbulent motion of the gas .",

    "first , the evolution of the particle size through the coagulation , collisional destruction , condensation , and sublimation is neglected , i.e. , we assume the mass flux @xmath210 for each size range is constant in the radial direction .",
    "second , in turbulent disks , the particles mass flux comes not only from the mean flow with an average velocity @xmath211 but also from the turbulent diffusion of particles , which appears as @xmath136 in equation ( [ eq : dustcont ] ) for example .",
    "we neglect the mass flux from the turbulent diffusion .",
    "third , we assume the structure of the gas component of the disk is entirely determined by the gas itself .",
    "we neglect the feedback drag induced by the particles on the gas . in the limit that the spatial density of the dust component becomes comparable to that of the gas near the midplane , this effect would speed up the azimuthal velocity of the gas to the keplerian value and quench the radial migration of the dust ( cuzzi et al .",
    "such a dust concentration requires substantial sedimentation of relatively large particles .",

    "@xmath3 particles between @xmath204 and @xmath221 au have an inflow velocity which is about half of the gas velocity .",
    "thus , if the mass of the dust disk is dominated by @xmath3 particles ( for example , if the particles have size distribution @xmath222 with maximum size @xmath3 ) , the dust - gas ratio would increase through the gas accretion .",
    "for example , if the initial mass of the gas disk is @xmath223 and it reduces to @xmath224 after viscous accretion , the dust - gas ratio would increase to be 6 times of its initial value .",
    "the increase in the dust - gas ratio speeds up the formation of planetesimals through mutual collisions .",
    "their enhanced abundance may also cause the dust component to become unstable and promote the planetesimal formation through the gravitational instability ( goldreich & ward 1973 ; sekiya 1998 ) .    if the particle growth proceeds to make @xmath203 mm to @xmath203 cm particles during the gas accretion phase , such large particles migrate inward rapidly and accumulate in the inner part of the disk ( see fig [ fig : surden]@xmath150 ) .",
