    "mcnp6 @xcite is used in various applications involving fission reactions at low , but also at intermediate and high energies .",
    "it is critical that it describes such reactions as well as possible , therefore it is often validated and verified against available experimental data and calculations by other models ( see , e.g. , @xcite and refrences therein ) .",
    "however , for nuclear reactions involving fission , generally the transport codes are only tested for how well they describe the fission - fragment yields , and the emission of particles from them ( spectra and multiplicities , both `` prompt '' and `` delayed '' ) .",
    "calculation of fission cross sections , @xmath1 , themselves by the transport codes is usually not tested , as it is assumed that data libraries used at energies below 150 mev must provide reliable @xmath1 , as should the event generators used at higher energies .",
    "our recent work @xcite shows that this assumption is too optimistic , as some event generators have problems describing well some fission cross sections . in such cases , all the characteristics of the corresponding fission reactions calculated by the transport codes , like the yields of fission fragments , spectra and multiplicities of neutrons and other particles , both `` prompt '' and `` delayed '' would also not be reliable . to assess this situation",
    ", we test how mcnp6 calculates @xmath1 using the cascade - exciton model ( cem ) and the los alamos version of the quark - gluon string model ( laqgsm ) as realized in the event generators cem03.03 and laqgsm03.03 , respectively , for reactions induced by nucleons , pions , and photons at incident energies from several tens of mev to @xmath2 tev .",
    "a comprehensive description of the cem03.03 and laqgsm03.03 event generators can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite therefore , we present only a brief summary of how cem03.03 and laqgsm03.03 calculate fission cross sections , needed to better understand our results .",
    "cem03.03 and laqgsm03.03 calculate the fission cross sections ( and the yields of fission products and evaporation of particles from them ) using a modification of the generalized - evaporation - model code gem2 by furihata @xcite .",
    "gem2 , in its turn , is based on a modification of the older ral fission - model code by atchison ( see @xcite and references therein ) . for fissioning nuclei with @xmath3",
    ", gem2 uses the original atchison calculation of the neutron emission width @xmath4 and fission width @xmath5 to estimate the fission probability as @xmath6 atchison uses @xcite the weisskopf and ewing statistical model @xcite .",
    "all details on the ral and gem2 codes and all formulas used by them to calculate @xmath1 can be found in refs .",
    "@xcite . let us mention here only that in the case of subactinide nuclei , the main parameter that determines the fission cross sections calculated by gem2 is the level - density parameter in the fission channel , @xmath7 ( or more exactly , the ratio @xmath8 ) , where @xmath9 is the level - density parameter for neutron evaporation .",
    "gem2 uses for it the follwing approximation : @xmath10 with @xmath11 .",
    "ta ( symbols , see detailed references in @xcite ) compared with our old mcnp6 calculations ( black dashed lines ) using the cem03.03 event generator before we fixed the error , with the corrected cem03.03 results ( green line ) , and with calculations by the updated mcnp6 using the corrected cem03.03 event generator ( red dashed line ) , as indicated . ]",
    "furihata obtained eq .",
    "( 2 ) as the best approximation for the ratio @xmath8 while calculating @xmath1 with gem2 used after the bertini intranuclear cascade ( inc ) model @xcite , without taking into account possible preequilibrium emission of particles after the inc .",
    "the inc s of cem and laqgsm are different from the bertini version @xcite , and both models account for preequilibrium emission of particles .",
    "hence , for any particular reaction , the mean mass , @xmath12 , and charge , @xmath13 , numbers of compound nuclei that may fission , as well as their mean excitation energy , @xmath14 , calculated by cem and laqgsm differ from the ones provided by the bertini inc . as a result , the best approximation provided by eq .",
    "( 2 ) for the bertini inc is not the best for cem and laqgsm . in ref .",
    "@xcite , we performed our own fitting of the ratio @xmath8 which works the best for cem and laqgsm , using as `` experimental '' proton - induced @xmath1 the systematics by prokofiev @xcite .",
    "after this adjustment for proton - induced reactions , cem and laqgsm were tested on reactions induced by neutrons , photons , and pions , and were found to calculate well @xmath1 for these types of reactions ( see details in @xcite ) .",
    "kowing from @xcite that both cem and laqgsm describe well @xmath1 for various reactions , we did not check until very recently how well mcnp6 and its precursor , mcnpx , using cem and laqgsm , calculated fission cross sections . the first attempt to calculate @xmath1 with mcnp6 using cem03.03 for p",
    "+ @xmath0ta found some very bad results at proton energies above @xmath15 mev ( see the black dashed line in fig .",
    "we verified that these mcnp6 results were not a problem of the incorporation of cem03.03 into mcnp6 , but were a result of an error inadvertently introduced into cem03.03 in 2005 during a major upgrade of the code @xcite .    to fix this problem , we have refitted in @xcite the values of @xmath8 in gem2 for @xmath0ta .",
    "our new cem03.03 results for @xmath0ta are shown in fig .  1 with a green line .",
    "we have replaced in mcnp6 the initial defective cem03.03 module with the corrected version with the correct values of @xmath8 in gem2 .",
    "results from the updated mcnp6 are also shown in fig",
    ".  1 by a red dashed line .        having discovered this 2005 error and knowing how it affects the cem results , we can understand now why in a recent work @xcite it was found that cem03.02 ( which has practically the same physics as the version cem03.03 used here ) provided such a poor agreement with the measured yields of the nuclides produced in proton interactions with @xmath0ta and nearby target nuclei for energies above 250 mev .",
    "unfortunately , we also discovered @xcite that @xmath1 printed in the output files of mcnp6 while using the genxs option with laqgsm03.03 were not correct ; we present an example of such erroneous results in fig .  2 , shown in the plot with magenta crosses .",
    "mcnp6 provides correct results for fission - fragment yields and for particle spectra in its output file . however , an unobserved error in counting the number of fissioning nuclei in the genxs portion of mcnp6 when using the laqgsm03.03 event generator was present in the initial beta 1 , version of mcnp6 @xcite .",
    "we have fixed that error .",
    "the current version of mcnp6 is free of that error and provides in its output files correct values for @xmath1 ( see the red dashed line in fig .",
    "2 ) .    after fixing both these problems , we find @xcite that mcnp6 using cem03.03 and laqgsm03.03 calculates @xmath1 in good agreement with available data for reactions induced by @xmath16 , @xmath17 , @xmath18 , and @xmath19 on both subactinide and actinide nuclei , at incident energies from several tens of mev up to @xmath2 tev ( see an example in fig .",

    "an error in the calculation of fission cross sections of @xmath0ta and other nearby target nuclei by the cem03.03 event generator of mcnp6 and a `` bug '' in the calculation of fission cross sections with the genxs option of mcnp6 while using the laqgsm03.03 event generator were detected during our current v&v work . after fixing both these problems , we find that mcnp6 using cem03.03 and laqgsm03.03 event generators calculates @xmath1 in a good agreement with available experimental data for reactions induced by nucleons , pions , and photons on both subactinide and actinide nuclei ( from @xmath20ho to @xmath21pu ) at incident energies from several tens of mev to about 1 tev .",
