    "the description of the scattering of very intense electromagnetic radiation by electrons has become an interesting subject for the theorists after the invention of the laser . when the description within the classical electrodynamics ( ced ) is valid ,",
    "the process is usually named non - linear thomson scattering ; the term non - linear compton scattering is used when the quantum description is required .",
    "the first step in the quantitative description of non - linear thomson effect is the solving of relativistic equations of motions for the electron in the laser field , then the solution is plugged into the well known expression of the lienard - wiechert potentials @xcite .",
    "many of the existing calculations @xcite refer to the case of a monochromatic laser field , where the double differential spectrum @xmath1 of the emitted radiation consists in an infinite series of equidistant lines whose positions depend on the laser intensity , electron momentum and observation direction .",
    "calculations for the case of a finite plane - wave laser pulse were also performed @xcite ; krafft _ et al . _",
    "@xcite gave an analysis of polarization of the emitted radiation for a particular geometry .",
    "results of numerical calculations for more realistic models of a focused laser pulse @xcite or based on the solutions of the dirac - lorentz equation @xcite were also published .    for the quantum description of intense radiation scattering on free electrons and published results based on it , we mention two recent review papers @xcite .",
    "of particular interest , especially for determining the validity limit of the ced formalism , is the relation between the classical and quantum results . for a monochromatic field , goreslavskii _ et al . _",
    "@xcite proved that the differential cross section of the thomson scattering can be obtained as the classical limit @xmath2 of the corresponding quantum expression and they also discussed validity conditions for the classical approach .",
    "more recently , heinzl _ et al . _",
    "@xcite analyzed the relation between the thomson and compton scattering for the terms corresponding to the absorption of a fixed number a photons in the cross sections , an approach possible in the monochromatic case only . in the case of a plane wave pulse",
    ", boca and florescu @xcite derived a new analytic expression for the classical double differential spectrum @xmath1 of the emitted radiation by taking the classical limit of the quantum formula @xcite and confirmed by numerical calculations the existent estimations of the limit of validity of the classical approach .",
    "the interest in the study of the radiation scattering resides in the potential applications of the process for the domain in the continuous development of laser technology",
    ". the possible application of the thomson / compton process as a source of very short pulses , from picosecond to attosecond and even zeptosecond domain , was considered in several papers @xcite .",
    "another application is related to the determination of the relative phase between the carrier and the envelope ( cep ) for the case of a few cycle laser pulses using thomson / compton scattering measurements @xcite .",
    "experimental work devoted to non - linear effects in radiation scattering from free electrons includes the observation of non - linear thomson effect in the case of non - relativistic electrons @xcite and the detection of non - linear compton effect , reported @xcite in an experiment of collision between gev electrons and a laser pulse of intensity of the order of atomic unit @xmath3 .",

    "the process it still within or at the boundary of the ced formalism domain of validity ; new features are expected to appear as a consequence of the balance between the effect of the very intense laser field , on the one hand , and the large energy of the electron , on the other .",
    "theoretical calculations referring to this range of intensities and energies @xcite are focused mainly on the energetic spectrum of the emitted radiation .",

    "we start sect .",
    "[ s - theory ] with the analytical expressions of the trajectory , velocity and acceleration for a charged particle in interaction with an electromagnetic pulse with fixed propagation direction but arbitrary length and shape .",
    "next , we review the main equations of the classical theory of radiation scattering and discuss a high energy approximation of the exact ced formula ; we also give an exact and an approximate expression for the angular distribution corresponding to two particular state of polarization of the emitted radiation .",
    "section [ s - numerical ] contains numerical examples . for a circularly polarized laser pulse with fixed intensity @xmath5 , we present graphs of @xmath0 for two collision geometries and different electron energies , and we illustrate the relation between the angular distribution and the trajectory followed by the velocity of the electron during the interaction with the laser pulse ;",
    "two scaling laws are briefly discussed . for the case of a short pulse",

    "one can see that in the high energy limit @xmath160 , @xmath161 depends only on the ratio @xmath162 ; as a consequence the _ shape _ of the angular distribution @xmath0 presented in our figures for @xmath80 and a given value of the electron energy should be identical to that obtained for other values of the parameter @xmath114 , assuming that the lorentz factor @xmath113 is scaled accordingly .",
    "we have investigated within the framework of classical electrodynamics the radiation emitted by an electron interacting with a very intense laser pulse ( @xmath80 ) , with fixed direction of propagation and finite length .",
    "we have considered initial electron energies in the range @xmath163 and two scattering configurations : head - on geometry and 90 degrees geometry .",
    "we have shown that in all cases the angular distribution @xmath0 , represented as a function of the observation direction angles @xmath38 and @xmath39 , consists in a set of very sharp maxima whose distribution in the plane @xmath104 is identical to the trajectory followed by the unit vector of the particle velocity , @xmath103 . for large energies of the incident electron ( @xmath164 in the case of head - on collision and @xmath165 for 90 degrees collision )",
    "the scattered radiation is emitted within a cone whose opening angle decreases with increasing of @xmath113 .",
    "we have presented the results of the polarization analysis for the two geometries , and in both cases we have compared the results with a high energy approximation , with the conclusion that the approximation reproduces at the qualitative level the exact calculation . finally , for the case of head - on collision we have discussed the effect of the change of the relative phase between the pulse envelope and carrier and we have presented a numerical example .",
    "the two scaling laws mentioned in sect .",
    "[ s - numerical ] , namely the proportionality of the angular distribution with @xmath166 and the dependence of its shape only on the ratio @xmath167 for @xmath168 , allow the use of the results presented in this paper for other values of the laser frequency and intensity .",
