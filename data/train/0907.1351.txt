    "one of the greatest achievements of noncommutative geometry @xcite is the conceptual understanding of the standard model of particle physics .",
    "this was not reached in one step .",
    "it took more than 15 years    * from the first appearance of the higgs potential in noncommutative models @xcite * via the two - sheeted universe of connes - lott @xcite with its bimodule structure @xcite , * the discovery of the real structure @xcite ( which eliminated one redundant @xmath1 group ) , * the understanding of gauge fields as inner fluctuations in an axiomatic setting @xcite and the move from the dixmier trace based action functional to the spectral action principle @xcite , which unifies the standard model with gravity , * the supersession of the unimodularity condition @xcite ( which eliminated the second redundant @xmath1 group ) , * to the spectacular rebirth @xcite with the explanation @xcite of the @xmath2 standard model matrix algebra as the distinguished maximal subalgebra of @xmath3 compatible with a non - trivial first order condition ( i.e.  majorana masses ) and a six - dimensional real structure ( i.e.  charge conjugation ) .",
    "there is one important message of this evolution : one should never be completely satisfied with one s achievements !",
    "the description given in alain connes book @xcite definitely has its beauty .",
    "the little annoyance with the redundant @xmath1 found its solution in the real structure @xcite which soon was realised as a key to unlocking the secrets of spin manifolds @xcite in noncommutative geometry .",
    "this axiomatic setting initiated many examples of noncommutative manifolds and culminated in the recent spectral characterisation of manifolds @xcite .",
    "let me give a wish list for further improvements  not as a criticism of the model , but rather as a possible source of insight .    1 .",
    "the outcome of the spectral action principle is a classical action functional valid at a distinguished ( grand unification ) scale .",
    "it is connected to the scale realised in a particle accelerator by the renormalisation group flow .",
    "this flow can be computed by rules from perturbative quantum field theory .",
    "the input is not directly the spectral action , but a gauge - fixed version of it which involves faddeev - popov ghosts .",
    "it is highly desirable to include these ghosts in the spectral action , because in this way unitary invariance is realised as cohomology of the brs complex .",
    "we may speculate that the brs cohomology of the spectral action is deeply connected to the wealth of noncommutative cohomology theories . as a starting point one might use results of perrot @xcite , who identifies the brs coboundary as the de rham differential in the loop space @xmath4 and connects the chiral anomaly with the local index formula @xcite .",
    "2 .   big desert .",
    "the present form of the spectral action is based on the big desert hypothesis which asserts that , apart from the higgs boson , all particles relevant at the grand unification scale are already discovered .",
    "the minor mismatch between observed and predicted @xmath1 coupling constant ( see figure 1 in @xcite ) might suggest some new physics in the desert .",
    "candidates include supersymmetry and dark matter , but also noncommutativity of space itself could alter the slope of the running @xmath1 coupling .",
    "+ the latter question concerning the renormalisation group flow of field theories on noncommutative geometries was intensely studied in the last decade .",
    "after unexpected difficulties with uv / ir - mixing , we established perturbative renormalisability of scalar field theories on moyal - deformed euclidean space @xcite .",
    "the key is a deformation also of the differential calculus , namely from the laplace operator to the harmonic oscillator schrdinger operator .",
    "it turned out indeed that the combined moyal - harmonic oscillator deformation removes the landau ghost of the commutative scalar model @xcite by altering the slope of the running coupling constant @xcite .",
    "since the @xmath1-part of the standard model has the same landau ghost problem , we might expect that , once the standard model has been grounded in an appropriate noncommutative geometry , the three running couplings of figure 1 in @xcite will eventually intersect in a single point .",
    "+ the first step in this programme is to construct a spectral triple with its canonically associated spectral action for the combined moyal - harmonic oscillator deformation . the present paper achieves an intermediate goal : we construct and investigate a _ commutative _ harmonic oscillator spectral triple .",
    "its moyal isospectral deformation will be treated in @xcite , building on ideas developed in @xcite .",
    "the main obstacle was to identify a dirac operator whose square is the harmonic oscillator hamiltonian of @xcite .",
    "the solution which we give in this paper is deeply connected to supersymmetric quantum mechanics @xcite , in particular to witten s approach to morse theory @xcite .",
    "it would be interesting to reformulate witten s results in noncommutative index theory using the spectral triple we suggest .",
    "the spectral action relies on compact euclidean geometry . for the standard model one",
    "typically chooses the manifold @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is for `` space '' and @xmath7 for `` temperature '' , not `` time '' .",
    "although the universe is filled with thermal background radiation , it is desirable to allow for a genuine time evolution of the spectral geometry .",
    "in fact , noncommutative von neumann algebras carry their own time evolution through the modular automorphism group , and it has been argued @xcite that this is the source of the physical time flow .",
    "so far the modular automorphisms seem disconnected from the spectral action . the most ambitious project to reconcile time development and spectral geometry within generally covariant quantum field theory",
    "was initiated by paschke and verch @xcite .",
    "4 .   compactness .",
    "as mentioned above , the spectral action presumes compactness , namely , compactness of the resolvent of the dirac operator .",
    "the example we study in this paper shows that compactness of the resolvent does not imply spacial compactness .",
    "it is eventually a matter of experiment to determine the type of compactness of the universe .",
    "the paper is organised as follows : we propose in section  [ sec : defst ] a definition of non - unital spectral triples , but with compactness of the resolvent of the dirac operator .",
    "we show in section  [ sec : harmonic ] that the supersymmetric harmonic oscillator is an example of such a spectral triple : in section  [ sec : susy ] we introduce the supercharges in a slightly generalised framework and discuss briefly their cohomology .",
    "the supercharges give rise to two distinct dirac operators . in section",
    "[ sec : oscillator ] we identify for the harmonic oscillator the algebra and the smooth part of the hilbert space . in section",
    "[ sec : dimspec ] and appendix  [ appendix ] we compute the dimension spectrum .",
    "the novel orientability structure is studied in section  [ sec : orientability ] , and section  [ sec : index ] discusses the index formula for the dirac operators .",
    "the spectral action is computed in section  [ sec : spectralaction ] and appendix  [ app - b ] . in the final section  [ sec : eq - motion ]",
    "we study the solution of the equations of motion .",
    "motivated by the spectral characterisation of manifolds @xcite , we propose here a definition of spectral triples which does not require the algebra to be unital .",
    "there are several proposals in the literature for a non - compact generalisation of spectral triples , see @xcite and references therein . to include the @xmath8 with its standard dirac operator ,",
    "these proposals relax the compactness of the resolvent of @xmath9 to the requirement that @xmath10 is compact for all @xmath11 .",
    "however , compactness of the resolvent ( or similar regularisation @xcite ) is essential for a well - defined spectral action .",
    "moreover , the usual dirac operator on @xmath8 is not suited for an index formula @xcite .",
    "we therefore keep compactness of the resolvent ( and thus exclude standard @xmath8 ) , but to achieve this in the non - compact situation we are forced to give up ( at least in our example )    1 .   the universality of dimensions , 2 .   the connection between volume form and @xmath12-grading .",
    "we give some comments after the definition .",
    "to simplify the presentation we require the algebra to be commutative ; the noncommutative generalisation involves the real structure @xmath13 .",

    "the dimension spectrum is the right tool to deal with this case",

    "however , this was only used for uniqueness of the noncommutative integral , which we achieve alternatively from the dimension spectrum . but @xcite makes heavy use of the asymptotics of the eigenvalues of @xmath70 to prove injectivity of the local charts ; we do not know how to achieve this from the dimension spectrum .",
