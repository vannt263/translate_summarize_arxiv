    "mdps have been widely used to model and solve control problems for stochastic systems  @xcite : there , non - determinism represents the freedom of the controller to choose a control action , while the probabilistic component of the behavior describes the system response to control actions .",

    "* one classical problem widely studied for mdps and ssgs is the _ finite - horizon objective_. in a finite - horizon objective , a finite time horizon @xmath5 is given and the goal of the player is to maximize the payoff within the time horizon @xmath5 in mdps ( in ssgs against all strategies of the opponent ) .",

    "the complexity results basically show that iterating the bellman equation for @xmath5 steps yield the desired result  @xcite .",
    "while the computational complexity have been well - studied , perhaps surprisingly the strategy complexity has not received great attention . in this work",

    "the natural class of strategies are counter - based strategies , which has a counter to count the number of time steps .",
    "our first contribution is to establish asymptotically optimal memory bounds for @xmath3-optimal counter - based strategies , for @xmath0 , in finite - horizon mdps and ssgs .",
    "we show that @xmath3-optimal counter - based strategies require at most memory of size @xmath1 and memory of size @xmath2 is required , where @xmath4 is the size of the state space .",
    "thus our bounds are asymptotically optimal .",
    "the upper bound holds for ssgs and the lower bound is for mdps .",
    "we then consider the periodic ( or regularity ) property of optimal strategies .",
    "the period of a strategy is the number @xmath6 such that the strategy repeats within every @xmath6 steps ( i.e. , it is periodic with time step @xmath6 ) .",
    "we show a sub - exponential lower bound on the period of optimal strategies for mdps with finite - horizon objectives , by presenting a family of mdps with @xmath4 states where all optimal strategies are periodic and the period is @xmath7 .",
