    "one of the goals of semiconductor spintronics@xcite is to realize quantum information processing based on electron / hole spins .",
    "coherent oscillations of spin state driven by an ac magnetic / electric field , which is the key of such a goal , have been broadly studied.@xcite experiments have demonstrated successfully the coherent oscillations of electron spin by optical stark effect in quantum wells on femtosecond time scale and by gigahertz - gate - voltage - controlled @xmath0-tensor modulation.@xcite recently , driven coherent oscillations of single spin in quantum dots ( qds ) at hundreds of mhz has also been realized.@xcite theoretically , rashba and efros showed perturbatively that electron spin can be manipulated by a weak in - plane time - dependent electric field via the spin - orbit coupling ( soc ) , such as the rashba@xcite and the dresselhaus@xcite couplings.@xcite they called it the electric - dipole spin resonance ( edsr ) .",
    "similar schemes have also been proposed in qds.@xcite cheng and wu have discussed _",
    "non_-perturbatively the effect of an intense terahertz ( thz ) electric field on two - dimensional electron gas ( 2deg ) with the rashba soc where the spin splitting is of the order of thz.@xcite they showed that a thz electric field can strongly affect the density of states of the electron system and induce a thz spin oscillations .",

    "i.e. _ , spin dephasing / relaxation in the ac - field driven systems , especially from a fully microscopic approach .",
    "recently duckheim and loss have studied the edsr in the presence of disorder in a 2deg , where the dissipation effect is introduced by a relaxation time.@xcite it has been shown in the system without the soc that the dissipation under driving field can be very different from the one without the driving field.@xcite a full microscopic kinetic equation under driving field can be developed with the help of floquet - markov theory.@xcite the floquet - markov theory combines the floquet theory which can solve the time - dependent ( periodic ) schdinger equation _ non - perturbatively _ with the born - markov approximation which is frequently used in deriving the kinetic equation with dissipations .    in the present paper",
    ", we extend the floquet - markov approach to the system with the soc .",
    "the change in density of states by the thz laser field@xcite implies a modification of the spin related scattering and then the spin relaxation time .",
    "we study the spin relaxation in an inas qd by developing a floquet - markov type kinetic equation with the electron - acoustic - phonon scattering . the spin relaxation time is obtained by numerically solving the kinetic equation .",
    "we develop the model and formulism in sec .",
    "ii and present the numerical results in sec .",
    "we conclude in sec .  iv .",
    "we construct our theory in a 1d qd in which electron is strongly confined in the @xmath1-@xmath2 directions and relatively weaker along the @xmath3-axis . this kind of qds",

    "the total hamiltonian is then given by @xmath4 with @xmath5 and @xmath6 representing the phonon and the electron - phonon interaction hamiltonian respectively .",

    "@xmath11 is the confining potential of the qd which is taken to be square well with infinite well depth in each direction.@xcite @xmath12 is the soc term , which consists of the rashba term due to the structure inversion asymmetry@xcite and the dresselhaus term due to the bulk inversion asymmetry.@xcite in inas the rashba soc is the dominant contribution .",
    "@xmath13 represents the zeeman term . when the transverse confinement is strong enough ,",
    "only the lowest subband is considered .",
    "then the hamiltonian of the electron can be reduced to an effective hamiltonian @xmath14 , where @xmath15 and @xmath16 .",

    "this choice will not change the results of the calculation as one can always take a unitary transformation in the spin space to transfer any other configuration into our simplified one .",
    "the effective hamiltonian is then written as @xmath22 with @xmath23\\cos(\\omega t)\\ , \\\\ & & \\hspace{-0.6cm}h_2(t ) = \\frac{e^2e_{1}^2\\cos^2(\\omega t)}{2m^{\\ast}\\omega^2}\\ .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] hence @xmath24 and @xmath25 .",
    "we observe that @xmath26 is only a function of time , and does not contain any other physical variables of electron .",
    "thus it only induces a universal phase and has no contribution to the kinetics of the system .",
    "the corresponding schrdinger equation @xmath27 can be solved via the floquet - fourier approach developed by shirley@xcite and applied lately in systems with the soc by cheng and wu.@xcite the solution is @xmath28 in which @xmath29 is a complete set of the wave functions , chosen here to be the eigen - functions of a infinite - depth - square - well potential @xmath30.@xcite @xmath31 and @xmath32 are the quasi - energies and the eigen - vectors of the following equations:@xcite @xmath33 where @xmath34 , @xmath35 and @xmath36 with @xmath37 representing the @xmath38-th fourier component of the effective hamiltonian . due to the periodicity of @xmath39 ,",

    "the floquet - markov method which combines the floquet solution of the electron hamiltonian and the born - markov approach to solve the equation of motion under strong ac driving field was developed by kohler _",
    "et al . _ in the absence of the soc.@xcite generally this method works well when the ac driven electron system is in the dynamic stable regime and the system interacts weakly with a markovian reservoir with a damping rate much less than any eigen - frequency of the system .",
    "the latter requirement can be satisfied for almost every case in the spin decoherence problem , as spins are generally expected to have a very long coherence time.@xcite in addition , studies have shown that , as well as keeping good quantitative results , the floquet - markov method has the advantage of being easy to handle numerically compared with the rather complicated path - integral approach.@xcite thus this method is very useful in the study of relaxation / dephasing in nano - structures . in the present paper",

    "we find that differing form the ohmic spin - phonon coupling,@xcite the spin relaxation time here can be either prolonged or shortened by the sideband effect , depending on the frequency and strength of both the thz magnetic field and the static magnetic field , with the latter providing the zeeman splitting .",

    "<S> the spin relaxation in a 1d inas quantum dot with the rashba spin - orbit coupling under driving thz magnetic fields is investigated by developing a kinetic equation with the help of the floquet - markov theory , which is generalized to the system with the spin - orbit coupling , to include both the strong driving field and the electron - phonon scattering . </S>",
    "<S> the spin relaxation time can be effectively prolonged or shortened by the terahertz magnetic field depending on the frequency and strength of the terahertz magnetic field . </S>",
    "<S> the effect can be understood as the sideband - modulated spin - phonon interaction . </S>",
    "<S> this offers an additional way to manipulate the spin relaxation time . </S>"
