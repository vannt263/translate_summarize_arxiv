    "quantum spin liquids ( qsl ) are at the center of interest of contemporary condensed matter physics and quantum many body theory ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) for several reasons .",
    "p. w. anderson proposed them as a new kind of insulator : a resonating valence bond ( rvb ) state @xcite .",
    "the interest in these state was clearly stimulated by the fact that they were soon associated with high @xmath0 superconductivity @xcite .",
    "immediately it was realized that rvb spin liquids might exhibit topological order @xcite and are related to fractional quantum hall states @xcite and chiral spin states @xcite .",
    "frustrated anti - ferromagnets ( afm ) provide paradigm playground for rvb states and spin liquids ( for the early reviews see @xcite ) .",
    "the most prominent example is heisenberg spin @xmath1 model in a kagome lattice .",
    "unfortunately , they are notoriously difficult for numerical simulations , since due to the ( in)famous sign problem quantum monte carlo methods can not be applied .",
    "still , a lot of information can be extracted from exact diagonalization studies ( for seminal early studies see ref .",
    "@xcite ) . there was a lot of effort to describe qsls with various approximate analytic approaches , such as large @xmath2 expansion @xcite , or appropriate mean field theory @xcite .",
    "these studies suggested that qsls described by rvb states represent topologically ordered states with finite energy gap , analogous to those of the famous kitaev s toric code model @xcite .    in parallel to afm in kagome lattice , the so called dimer model in triangular lattice",
    "was studied intensively @xcite  it was also found that it is expected to exhibit a gapped rvb phase ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "the first experimental indications of qsls comes from studies of mott insulator in the triangular lattices @xcite , and power law conductivity inside the mott gap in certain materials @xcite .",
    "more recently observations ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) combine various standard and non - conventional detection methods in kagome heisenberg afm , including measurements of fractionalized excitations @xcite .",
    "there are also reports of qsl behavior in the , so called , _ herbertsmithites _ ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "recently great progress was achieved in numerical simulations of the gapped qsls , based on the the use 1d density matrix renormalization group ( dmrg ) codes , `` wired '' on 2d tori / cylinders .",
    "this approach allowed for better insight into the properties of the ground state of the heisenberg afm in the kagome lattice @xcite .",
    "more importantly , it allowed obtaining convincing signature of its topological @xmath3 nature .",
    "this was based on numerical estimate for the , so called , topological entanglement entropy ( tee )  the quantity that unambiguously characterizes topological gapped qsls @xcite",
    ". calculations of tee were earlier applied to the quantum dimer model in the triangular lattice @xcite and to the bose - hubbard spin liquid in the kagome lattice @xcite .",
    "they were extended to critical qsls @xcite , toric code @xcite and lattice",
    "laughlin states @xcite .",
    "since these calculations aim at sub - leading term in entanglement entropy , it is quite challenging to achieve good accuracy ( see for instance @xcite .",
    "recently , studies of afm in kagome lattice were extended to novel proposals for characterizing / detecting topological excitations and dynamical structure factor @xcite .",
    "several papers discuss inclusion of the chiral terms and dzyaloshinsky - moriya interactions , resulting in formation of chiral qsls @xcite .",
    "considerable interest was devoted also to the @xmath4 heisenberg model in the kagome lattice @xcite and in the square lattice @xcite , to the @xmath5 heisenberg model in the kagome lattice @xcite , and to the kitaev - heisenberg model @xcite in triangular lattices @xcite .",
    "systems of ultracold atoms and ions provide a very versatile playground for quantum simulation of various models of theoretical many body physics @xcite  qsl have in this context also quite long history .",
    "the first proposals for quantum simulators of the kitaev model in the hexagonal lattice @xcite , and afm in the kagome lattice @xcite were formulated more than ten years ago ; all of them were based on smart designs and use of super - exchange interactions in optical lattices .",
    "more feasible and perhaps are experimentally less demanding proposals based on ultracold ions @xcite , or ultracold atoms in shaken optical lattice @xcite .",
    "the latter schemes were originally designed to control the value and sign of the tunneling in bose - hubbard models  for original theory proposal see @xcite , and for the first experiments in the square lattice see @xcite . they should be regarded as specific examples of generation of synthetic gauge fields in optical lattices @xcite , or more precisely synthetic gauge fields in periodically - driven quantum systems @xcite .",
    "change of sign of tunneling in the triangular lattice is know to be equivalent of the introduction of the @xmath6-flux synthetic `` magnetic '' field in the bose - hubbard model @xcite . in the hardcore boson limit one",
    "obtains then an xx afm model in the triangular lattice , which for isotropic bonds is known to have a planar nel ground state .",
    "if , however , the bonds are anisotropic and their values @xmath7",
    ", @xmath8 can be controlled , then as anisotropic parameter @xmath9 goes from infinity to zero the model interpolates between an afm in a rhombic lattice ( with the conventional nel ground state ) to an afm in the ideal triangular lattice ( with the planar nel ground state ) , and finally to an afm in an array of weakly coupled 1d chains ( with the conventional nel ground state again ) .",
    "exact diagonalizations and tensor network states simulations ( peps ) indicate that between these three nel phases there exists two quite extended regions of gapped qsl @xcite .",
    "interestingly the presence and the location of the qsl phases can be determined quite accurately using the generalized spin wave theory , which signals instability at the qsl boundaries @xcite .",
    "the spin wave method is impressively powerful and has been generalized and applied to frustrated bosons and heisenberg model with completely asymmetric triangular lattice @xcite .",
    "we should stress that the proposal of ref .",
    "@xcite is in principle very promising , since it requires temperature of order of @xmath10 which is achievable in realistic experimental conditions , here @xmath11 denotes atom - atom on site interaction energy .",
    "in fact , initial experiment demonstrated feasibility of the scheme , but were conducted far from hardcore boson limit . in these experiments a triangular array of cigar shaped bose - einstein condensates was realized , corresponding to a frustrated quasi - classical afm @xcite , described by a classical xx spin model with the @xmath12 symmetry , and gaussian bogoliubov - de gennes quantum , or better to say quasi - classical fluctuations . in the further works , by exploiting control over the temporal shape of the periodic modulation , one could realize arbitrary peierl s phases , i.e. arbitrary fluxes of the synthetic `` magnetic '' field through the elementary plaquette of the lattice ( @xcite , see also @xcite ) .",
    "this allowed for realization of a quasi - classical spin model with competing @xmath12 and ising @xmath3 symmetries @xcite .",
    "the route toward the strongly correlated regime and hardcore limit seem to be obscured , however , by uncontrolled heating mechanisms , most probably intrinsically associated with the periodic modulation scheme @xcite .",
    "even if this difficulty is overcome , another experimental aspect might prevent the observation of qsl in such systems .",
    "indeed the overall harmonic trapping of the atomic ensemble leads to non - constant filling factor over the optical lattice .",
    "we should expect thus formation of wedding cake structure , formed by the different quantum phases ( cf . @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "how does the phase diagram look like or change in the presence of such `` experimental imperfections '' ?",
    "this is the question we want to answer in this paper . to this aim",
    "we apply exact diagonalization on small lattices , and wired dmrg with open boundary conditions . on large lattices",
    "we apply modified spin - wave theory , adopted to the spatially inhomogeneous situation , which turns out to be technically much more demanding than the one pertaining to the spatially homogeneous lattice .",
    "our work provides a starting point for the future applications of tensor network state approaches like projected entangled pair states ( peps ) to a moderate size lattices .",
    "these future calculations will aim at estimations of topological entropy , which so far for the considered model in the triangular lattice has not yet been accomplished even in the spatially homogeneous case with periodic boundary conditions .",
    "studying the influence of the spatial inhomogeneities , induced by the presence of the trap or disorder , on topological entanglement entropy is a fascinating question in itself  it goes , however , beyond the scope of the present paper . while inhomogeneity due to confinement are instrinsict to ultracold atoms , our approach may be also relevant for searching qsls in other quasi-2d condensed matter systems that present residual magnetization or inhomogeneities , for instance , due to the presence of a substrate .",
    "the paper is structured in the following way : after introducing the system and model in section ii , we construct the modified spin wave theory in section iii . from this theory",
    ", we obtain a phase diagram in section iv . in section v , we consider first a small lattice using exact diagonalization .",
    "then , we show that quasi - exact results can be obtained for much larger lattices using dmrg .",
    "the main conclusion drawn from our study , summarized in section vi , regards the co - existence of spin liquid behavior at different filling factors smaller than 1/2 .",
    "thus , the spin liquid phase is expected to be robust against inhomogeneities due to a trapping potential .",
    "our finding should facilitate the experimental observation of spin liquids in optical lattice systems .",
    "ultracold bosons in deep optical lattices are very well described by the bose - hubbard model .",
    "therefore , we will take the bose - hubbard hamiltonian as a starting point for our analysis : = _ i j t_ij ( _ i^_j + ) + _ i _ i ( _ i - 1 ) + _ i v_i _ i . here",
    ", the @xmath13 , @xmath14 are the creation and annihilation operator at the site @xmath15 of the triangular lattice , and @xmath16 is the number operator of the fock space .",
    "the first term is a possibly anisotropic nearest - neighbor hopping , with tunneling amplitudes @xmath17 . in the standard case",
    ", one would have a minus sign in front of the tunneling term .",
    "however , it is possible to control the sign ( or even phase ) of the tunneling , which is a crucial ingredient to generate frustration in the triangular lattice .",
    "as here we will exclusively be interested in such scenario of reversed hopping amplitude , we absorbed the sign in the definition of @xmath17 , such that standard hopping would correspond to @xmath18 , while we will consider @xmath19 .",
    "the second term in @xmath20 describes repulsive on - site interactions of strength @xmath21 .",
    "the last term is the trapping potential @xmath22 .",
    "although it is present in any realistic experiment , it is often neglected in theoretical studies .",
    "the positions of a boson on site @xmath15 is denoted by @xmath23 .",
    "if interactions @xmath11 are strongly repulsive , fluctuations in particle number is suppressed .",
    "it is then justified to restrict the local hilbert space to a subspace formed by the states with occupation number two . these states may change throughout the trap , but within a local density approximation , we may keep them fixed within a circular area in the center of the trap , and ring - shaped areas further outside , as illustrated in figure [ fig : trap ] .",

    "the hight of the plateau is taken to be the one corresponding to half filling .",
    "the smooth terms can be then treated as a perturbation , on the same footing as the hopping term .",
    "the effective model in each plateau is thus equivalent to an anisotropic xx - spin model with an smoothly varying magnetic term . ]",
    "this approach allows to map the bose - hubbard hamiltonian onto a spin model , using a holstein - primakoff transformation @xcite . within each region @xmath24 ,",

    "the vanishing of squared creation or annihilation operators is due to the restriction of the local hilbert space to two states . using the definition of spin operators the tunneling part of the original tight - binding hamiltonian",
    "gets transformed to @xmath29 .",

    "the trap potential gives rise to a term @xmath31 . with @xmath32 , and neglecting the terms which are constant within a given region @xmath24 , the dynamical part of the transformed hamiltonian is an xx model in an inhomogeneous transverse field : _ i = i _ i j t_ij ^+_i ^-_j + + _ i v_i _ i^z .",

    "horizontal hopping amplitudes are given by @xmath7 , while hopping in the other directions have an amplitude @xmath33 , where @xmath9 parametrizes the anisotropy of the lattice . ]    before studying this hamiltonian in the next sections using modified spin wave theory , exact diagonalization , and dmrg , let us briefly discuss the parameter regimes which are of interest experimentally .",
    "as mentioned before , being interested in frustration and spin liquids , the spin - spin interactions in eq .",
    "( [ eq : h1 ] ) should be antiferromagnetic , that is , @xmath19 . to simplify the scenario ,",
    "@xmath17 should only depend on the direction of the hopping , with amplitudes along horizontal links denoted @xmath7 , while the two links with non - zero vertical component shall have an amplitude @xmath34 , see figure [ fig : lattice ] .",
    "the anisotropy of the lattice is then characterized by a single parameter @xmath9 , which we will tune from 0 , corresponding to an effective 1d system , to values greater than @xmath35 , where the lattice geometry is dominated by a rhombic structure .",
    "the energy difference between neighboring spins is of the order @xmath36 , where @xmath37 is the lattice constant , and @xmath38 is a dimensionless parameter . we assume the lattice is loaded with @xmath39rb atoms , which has lattice constant @xmath40 nm and a trap frequency @xmath41hz ; we have @xmath42hz .",
    "this is about an order of magnitude weaker than typical interactions strengths , @xmath43hz . in the modified spin wave approach",
    ", we will therefore take @xmath44 , while the effect of non - zero values will be addressed within the exact diagonalization study .",
    "let us start by analyzing the spin system for constant _ non - zero _ magnetization , which corresponds to fillings different from @xmath45 .",
    "classically , we expect the spin oriented along a cone around the @xmath46-axis , @xmath47 here , @xmath48 is a vector in the @xmath49-plane while @xmath50 is the azimuthal angle related to the magnetization along the @xmath46-axis , i.e. to the filling of the original bosons @xmath51 $ ] , where @xmath52= $ ] integer part of @xmath53 . for @xmath54 , reduces to the ansatz considered by @xcite at half filling .",
    "if we follow the standard spin - wave approach , we should choose the local basis in such a way that the new local @xmath46-axis is parallel to the vector .",
    "in this way , by applying the bosonization of the local spin we would model fluctuations _ along the classical ordering _ represented by . now , such fluctuations would have component also along the @xmath46-axis . in other words , they would renormalize the filling factor .",
    "such behavior is not acceptable from the physical point of view .",
    "indeed , in the original bosonic hubbard model the filling factor is a well defined quantity : the hopping term conserves the particle number , and , thus , the expectation value of the particle density which is the filling .",
    "the same argument holds for the same physical model as described as a spin system . in practice ,",
    "the acceptable fluctuations are restricted to the @xmath49-plane , and , precisely , are along the projection of the ordering vector on the @xmath49-plane .",
    "that is to say that corrected choice for the quantization axis is the same as at half filling .",
    "what is then the difference with respect to the half - filling case ?",
    "the difference resides in the magnitude of the spin projection .",
    "if we do the reasonable assumption that the fluctuations are proportional to such length we can relate @xmath55 , the local density of bosonic excitations , to the filling . as originally proposed by takahashi @xcite , such density at half filling should be taken equal to the total spin , @xmath56 , that to say also the bosonic excitations are at half - filling . here , we propose a generalized takahashi condition , @xmath57 where the angle @xmath50 is related to the filling by the relation @xmath58 which implies @xmath59 .",
    "this choice has further physical justification .",
    "first , it is symmetric around half filling as it should be : reversing the quantization axis @xmath60 in the dyson - maleev transformation @xcite is equivalent to the replacement @xmath61 .",
    "second , fluctuations are maximal at half - filling and are suppressed in the paramagnetic ( mott ) phases , which correspond to filling @xmath62 and @xmath63 .",
    "as derived in previous sections , the filling factor @xmath64 is smoothly changing in the trap and relates to the harmonic potential as @xmath65 $ ] , where @xmath52=$ ] fractional part of @xmath53 ( the hopping term has zero mean ) .",
    "thus , our analysis can be applied in local density approximation to trapped systems .",
    "we define the local spin operators @xmath66 that are related to the global ones @xmath67 through the rotation @xmath68 where @xmath69 is the rotation that sends the vector @xmath70 to @xmath71 , i.e. along the projection of ordering vector on the @xmath49-plane .    by composing with the dyson - maleev transformations @xmath72",
    "we find that in the original spin basis , the bosonization is    @xmath73    where @xmath74 , @xmath75 , and @xmath76 .",

    "it is worth noticing that the terms in @xmath80 and @xmath79 are manifestly symmetric and antisymmetric under the exchange of indices , @xmath81 , respectively . indeed , by construction",
    "the whole expression is invariant under such exchange of summed indices .",

    "@xcite : taking into account all polarization sectors , the level spacings are much more homogeneous around @xmath244 and @xmath245 , than in other regimes where , in each spin sector , one ( or few ) strongly states are separated from higher states by a large gap . while in a finite system",
    "the ground state energy is different in different polarization sectors , one expects that in the thermodynamic limit all ground states collapse to a degenerate manifold which is separated from excited states by a gap .",
    "this manifold is the basis of a `` tower of states '' @xcite , from which , by breaking of the u(1 ) symmetry , nel ordered phases can arise . on the other hand , for the more homogeneous spectra around @xmath244 and @xmath245 , we do not expect this mechanism to work .",
    "therefore , these spectra are rather characteristic of a spin liquid phase than of an ordered phase .    to quantify this different behavior we shall look at the gap averaged over all polarization sectors . since there might be quasi - degenerate levels , it is not always obvious which of the levels shall be taken as ground states , and which as excited states .",
    "for this reason , we associate the largest level spacing @xmath246 within the ten lowest states as the energy gap . for a system with a  tower of states  , that is with a gapped ground state manifold in all polarization sectors , this quantity should remain large when averaged over all polarizations .",
    "this average is shown in figure [ fig : spectra](e ) , for both a trapped and a homogeneous system . in both cases , it exhibits two clear minima near @xmath244 and @xmath245 .",
    "this indicates a breakdown of order around these minima , suggesting the emergence of spin liquid behavior .",
    "we finally present first results from the density - matrix renormalization group ( dmrg )  @xcite method , which allows us to study moderately larger two - dimensional systems than is accessible via exact diagonalization  @xcite .",
    "briefly , dmrg is a variational method that adaptively selects the most relevant subspace of the full hilbert space , relative to a series of bi - partitions .",
    "this proves extremely effective for large one - dimensional systems , where the so - called ` area law ' for entanglement entropy indicates that ground states of gapped systems have bounded entanglement entropy and can be represented faithfully in dmrg calculations . in higher - dimensional systems ,",
    "the method can still be applied to take advantage of the area law , where in 2d systems the cost of an accurate simulation grows exponentially in the system s width , rather than its volume .    starting with the hamiltonian above for the trapped systems",
    ", we begin by investigate finite - size effects introduces by exact - diagonalization on small systems . in fig .",
    "[ fig : dmrg ] , we show results for a trapped system of seven atoms with @xmath247 and @xmath248 . under these conditions , the harmonic trap confines the great majority of the atoms to the central regions studied by exact diagonalization ;",
    "for weaker trapping parameters or greater number of atoms one would expect greater effects from the hard - wall boundary imposed by simulations of smaller systems .",
    "in this paper we have studied the fate of qsl phases in realistic experimental conditions , namely , in presence of an harmonic confinement . the modified spin wave theory , which was previously formulated for bosons in a triangular lattice at half filling , was re - derived for arbitrary filling factors .",
    "with this generalization , it can be used to capture , within a local density approximation , the physics of inhomogeneous systems .",
    "we have shown that the prediction of spin liquid behavior for an anisotropy @xmath249 does not depend much on the filling factor , and should therefore survive in a trapped gas .",
    "this expectation was backed by results from exact diagonalization in lattices of 24 sites .",
    "these results support the existence of another qsl region at lower anisotropy , @xmath250 , which is not detected by msw .",
    "such discrepancy is not surprising .",
    "it is reasonable to expect that the msw is able to detect a qsl phase only between two classical ordered phases the qsl phase at @xmath249 appears between spiral and 2d - nel phases while it is blind to transitions that are purely quantum .",
    "one may wonder that this happens only because the optimization is done starting by the classical solution .",
    "in fact unbiased direct searches of global minima provided the same or more energetic metastable solutions .",
    "apparently , the optimal solution of the msw is always a deformation of the classical one : perhaps , this is not so surprising because the spin wave approach is an expansion in @xmath251 and the terms in @xmath252 included in the msw are corrections to the terms considered in the lsw .",
    "the exact diagonalization approach allowed us also to go beyond the local density approximation , and to study inhomogeneities on small scales . on this level",
    ", we have found no essential effect due to the trap for realistic choices of the trapping frequency .",
    "while the finite - size corrections are certainly expected to affect the exact diagonalization results , they should not exceed the 10 - 20 % .",
    "as the observables computed are global one would argue that the qsl behavior extends at least to entire lattice ( of 24 spins ) considered . while final - size effects are not directly visible in the msw because we used periodic boundary conditions , they enter by determining the quality of local density approximation . until the trap is not steep , and at the center",
    "is never so , the msw suggests that , by taking optimal value of @xmath249 at the center of the qsl region , the qsl phase should be visible even if the filling is changing considerably .",
    "suppose , for instance , that the trap is tuned to have an occupation of around 3.7 atoms per site at the center , that to say 20% above the half - filling condition .",
    "then , we could conclude that if we reach an occupation of 3.3 atoms per site 20% below half filling at 10 lattice sites or more from the center , at the same time , we are within validity of local - density approximation , in the qsl phase as predicted by msw theory , and we limit the corrections due to the finite size as they are expected to go down as the inverse of the diameter of the region considered .",
    "our study therefore provides strong hints for a robust spin liquid phase of bosons in anisotropic triangular lattices with antiferromagnetic tunnelings , which is not affected by weak trapping potentials as used in experiments .    the robustness of the spin - liquid phase in presence of a weak harmonic confinement allow for the experimental investigation of these exotic quantum phases .",
    "the realization of the xx hamiltonian for bosons in the strongly correlated regime relies on the periodic driving of the triangular optical lattice , which allows inverting the sign of the tunneling matrix elements as well as controlling their amplitude .",
    "the ability to tune the tunneling amplitude independently from the on - site interaction allows reaching strongly correlated phases where @xmath253 without increasing the lattice depth . indeed , as the effective tunneling @xmath254 follows a zeroth - order bessel function as the shaking amplitude is increased , the system shall first enter a mott - insulating phase before reaching the anti - ferromagnetic side of the phase diagram and thus the quantum spin liquid phase .",
    "such a trajectory has allowed for a reversible crossing of the superfluid to mott - insulator phase transition in a driven cubic lattice @xcite .",
    "one limiting factor however are multiphoton resonances to higher lying bloch bands , which critically reduce the coherence of the bosonic gas @xcite .",
    "these resonances occur when a multiple of the shaking frequency matches the gap between the renormalized bands .",
    "therefore an optimized scheme for crossing the quantum phase transition while avoiding such resonances has to be developed .",
