    "pulsars with drifting subpulses are considered as an important key for unlocking the mystery of how radio pulsars work . though there has been significant progress both in high quality observations of drifting subpulses and in confronting their observational properties with existing models ( e.g. @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ( hereafter paper 1 ) ) , the detailed nature of radio emission processes of pulsars and the exact location , distribution of the pulse emitting regions are still shrouded with mystery .",
    "knowledge of the viewing geometry is essential to understand the pulsar emission mechanism .",
    "the orientation of the pulsar radiation beam can be determined by two angles , @xmath9 ( the angle between the rotation axis and magnetic axis ) and @xmath10 ( the minimum angle between the magnetic axis and the observer s line of sight ( los ) ) .",
    "possible geometry of a pulsar is determined by the `` rotating vector model ( rvm ) '' ( @xcite ) fit to the polarization angle ( pa ) traverse .",
    "the possible choice of geometry should also satisfy the average profile evolution with frequency and the observed drift pattern .",
    "the phenomenon of subpulse drifting , first reported by @xcite , is manifested as systematic subpulse behaviour : subpulses appear at progressively changing longitude in the pulse window following a particular path ( known as drift band ) which is specific to the individual pulsar concerned .",
    "studies of wide profile drifting pulsars can probe the emission regions in the pulsar magnetosphere ( @xcite , paper 1 , @xcite ) . since our los samples a large region of the polar cap in case of wide profile pulsars , presence of simultaneous multiple drift regions",
    "is quite probable .",
    "phase relation between multiple drift regions are known only in few pulsars @xmath0 psr b0815@xmath1109 @xcite , psr b1839@xmath004 @xcite and psr b0818@xmath041 ( paper 1 ) .",
    "observed phase relationship between the drift regions can probe the distribution and dynamics of the emission regions in the polar cap .",
    "multifrequency observations may offer insights into various aspects of frequency dependence of pulsar radiation ( @xcite and the references therein ) .",
    "psr b0818@xmath041 is a relatively less studied wide profile pulsar . in paper 1",
    ", we reported the discovery of a remarkable drift pattern at 325 mhz , characterized by simultaneous occurrences of three drift regions : an inner region with flatter apparent drift rate flanked on each side by a region of steeper apparent drift rate .",
    "the drift regions have different values for @xmath4 ( the measured longitude separation between two adjacent drift bands ) , but identical values for @xmath3 ( the measured time interval between the recurrence of successive drift bands at a given pulse longitude ) .",
    "the closely spaced inner and outer drift regions always maintain a phase locked relationship ( hereafter plr ) .",
    "the observed drift pattern was interpreted as being created by the intersection of our los with two conal rings on the polar cap of a fairly aligned rotator ( @xmath111 ) , with an inner los geometry ( @xmath25.4 ) .",
    "results from simulations reproduced the observed features ( width of average profile , single pulse drift pattern etc ) .",
    "@xcite have studied the average polarization properties of this pulsar at 660 and 1440 mhz .",
    "their study reports a steep - sided wide profile with modest amount of linear polarization ( 32% at 660 mhz and 31% at 1440 mhz ) . from the wide integrated profile",
    ", @xcite also predicted that this pulsar must be a fairly aligned rotator .",
    "we made multi epoch observations of psr b0818@xmath041 at 157 , 244 , 325 , 610 and 1060 mhz using the gmrt in full polar mode . in sect .",

    "[ sec : summary ] , we present a final summary of different aspects of the analysis results and the interpretations .",
    ".details of the observations at different epochs and corresponding measurements of the values of mean fluxes [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     @xmath12 : combinations producing , @xmath13 are indicated by bold face .      from the gray scale plot of the single pulses ( e.g. fig .",
    "[ sp_325 ] ) it is evident that inner and outer drift regions are locked in phase : inner drift bands start from almost halfway between two drift bands in the leading outer region and always remain connected with the drift bands from the trailing outer region .",
    "this constant phase relation does not get perturbed by nulling or irregular drifting and is maintained even during the sequences of irregular drifting as well as after nulling .",
    "the plr implies that the emission from the inner and the outer rings are always in fixed phase .",
    "furthermore , nulling and changing drift rates are observed to be simultaneous in both the rings .",
    "interestingly , a 180phase shift between the spark locations on the inner and the outer rings is needed in the simulation to match the plr of the observed drift pattern of psr b0818@xmath041 .",
    "such an arrangement of sparks corresponds to a maximally packed structure on the polar cap .",
    "spark discharges occur in every place where the potential drop is high enough to ignite and develop pair production avalanche @xcite , so sparks populate the polar cap as densely as possible . at the same time , such an arrangement of sparks should be quasi rigid , a property which is also suggested by the data .",
    "psr b0826@xmath034 is another wide profile pulsar for which presence of simultaneous multiple drift regions are observed ( @xcite , @xcite and @xcite ) . for this pulsar",
    "the main pulse and the inter pulse emission are interpreted to be coming from two concentric rings of emission ( @xcite and @xcite ) . fig .",
    "9 of @xcite presents the gray scale plot of the single pulses from psr b0826@xmath034 at 610 mhz .",
    "this plot illustrates simultaneous drifting in the main pulse ( @xmath6 5 to 6 drift bands ) and inter pulse ( @xmath6 3 to 4 drift bands ) region .",
    "the drift bands in these regions are locked in phase implying that the emission from the inner and the outer rings are in phase .",
    "@xcite applied the method of phase tracking to the single pulse data and detected in total 13 drift bands in the pulse window .",
    "plr between the inner and outer rings is evident from their results ( fig .",
    "6 of @xcite ) . for psr b0826@xmath034",
    "we observe frequent nulling and changes of drift rates which are simultaneous for both the inner and outer rings .",
    "in addition , @xcite reported significant correlation between total energy of the main pulse and the inter pulse .",
    "they found that with increasing pulse lag this correlation follows similar trend as the autocorrelation of total energy of the main pulse or the inter pulse ( fig .",
    "7 of @xcite ) .",
    "the only other pulsar for which simultaneous occurrence of multiple drift regions and phase relation between the drift regions are observed is psr b0815 + 09 .",
    "but the mirrored drift bands observed for psr b0815@xmath1109 can not be explained within the @xcite model .",
    "some pulsars @xmath0 e.g. psr b1237@xmath1125 , b1857@xmath026 @xmath0 clearly shows multiple components in their profile ( mostly five components , denoted by `` m '' ) . @xcite",
    "have recognised these pulsars as a distinct observational class of objects , where the emission is coming from the core and two concentric conal rings .",
    "no signature of drifting is detected in the inner ring for these pulsars , possibly because of the fact that the inner ring is too weak to detect any single pulse behaviour .",
    "for example , in psr b1237@xmath1125 drifting is observed in the outer ring with fluctuation feature at @xmath14 @xcite . in fig .",
    "6 of @xcite we observe a faint fluctuation feature around @xmath14 corresponding to the inner ring .    to summarise ,",
    "signatures of drifting from more than one ring are observed for only a few pulsars and for all of those pulsars , emission from inner and outer rings are locked in phase .",
    "no counter example is observed .",
    "this requires common drift rate in the outer and inner rings , implying that emission in the two rings are not independent , and that the conditions responsible for drifting are similar in both rings .",
    "this demands that the conditions are similar everywhere in the magnetosphere , which can in turn put constraints on the theoretical models attempting to explain the pulsar emission mechanism .",
    "our finding of plr between the emission from the inner and the outer rings can be explained considering the pulsar emission as a pan magnetospheric phenomenon .",
    "according to @xcite , at any given time , the polar cap is populated as densely as possible .",
    "they consider , characteristic dimension of a spark and typical distance between sparks being equal to polar cap height h. they do not distinguish between the radial and the azimuthal directions , which may favor similar conditions ( electric field and magnetic field ) for both the rings of emission , leading to pan magnetospheric conditions across the polar gap .",
    "@xcite proposed an alternative model for the pulsar magnetosphere which considers the magnetosphere as an integral whole , and suggests that the inner and outer cones found in integrated profiles reflect the two intersections of the null surface with the light cylinder and the co - rotating dead zones respectively .",
    "they consider the pulsar radio emission phenomenon as a global pan magnetospheric phenomenon .",
    "our results are consistent with these kinds of models .",
    "following are the interesting new results from our investigation of subpulse drifting and polarization properties of psr b0818@xmath041 at multiple frequencies : + ( 1 ) we estimate the mean flux of psr b0818@xmath041 at 5 different frequencies and show that the spectrum flattens at frequencies lower than 325 mhz ( at 244 or 157 mhz ) , providing indication of a low frequency turn - over",
    ". + ( 2 ) we present the average profiles at five different frequencies .",
    "the evolution of profile width with frequency follows radius to frequency mapping .",
    "+ ( 3 ) significant linear polarization is observed at 325 , 610 and 1060 mhz .",
    "linear polarization profiles follow similar trend as the total intensity profile and get depolarized at both edges of the profile .",
    "this can be explained by the observed orthogonal polarization mode jump at the edges of the profile .",
    "polarization angle sweep across the pulse profile evolves remarkably with frequency ( at 325 , 610 and 1060 mhz ) , which is not generally observed in other pulsars .",
    "though very less circular polarization without any signature of changing handedness is observed at 325 and 610 mhz , circular polarization changes sign at the middle of the pulse profile at 1060 mhz .",
    "+ ( 4 ) in addition to the remarkable subpulse drift observed at 325 mhz , we report subpulse drifting at 244 , and 610 mhz . at 244 mhz",
    "subpulse drifting is observed only in the leading and trailing outer regions and not in the inner region .",
    "though the drift bands are weaker , subpulse drifting is observed in both inner and outer region at 610 mhz .",
    "frequent changes of drift rates , including transitions of drift rates from negative to stationary and vice verse , are observed for this pulsar .",
    "such transitions of drift rates appear to have some connection with nulling .",
    "@xmath4 , @xmath3 and @xmath15 are determined for the inner and the outer drift regions . though @xmath3 is observed to be the same for the inner and outer drift regions , @xmath4 and @xmath15 are different for different drift regions .",
    "+ ( 5 ) we report that the peaks of the emission from the trailing and leading outer regions , as a function of the pulse number , are offset by a constant interval , @xmath16@xmath69@xmath7 .",
    "we also report a phase locked relation ( plr ) between the inner and outer drift regions for psr b0818@xmath041 .",
    "+ interpretations of the analysis results , aided by the simulations , lead to following new outcomes , + ( 1 ) based on the frequency evolution of the average profile , observed pa swing and results from subpulse drifting , we converged on two possible choices of emission geometry : * g-1 * ( @xmath17and @xmath18 ) and * g-2 * ( @xmath19 and @xmath20 ) . pulsar radiation pattern simulated with both the geometries reproduces the observed features , except for some differences .",
    "rather surprisingly , all other observed properties are found to be satisfied for both these geometries .",
    "+ ( 2 ) we explain the observed subpulse drifting and transitions of apparent drift rates from negative to stationary as being due to aliasing .",
    "the frequent transitions from negative to stationary drift rates observed for psr b0818@xmath041 can be understood by slight changes in polar cap temperature leading to change in the drift rate so that @xmath21 is satisfied and longitude stationary drifting is observed .",
    "+ ( 3 ) the absence of the inner drift region at 244 mhz is interpreted as , the los missing the emission from the inner ring .",
    "this is supported by the results from the simulations .",
    "+ ( 4 ) a new technique is introduced in this paper for resolving aliasing , using the constant offset ( @xmath22 ) between the peak emission from the leading and trailing outer regions . from the result of this technique",
    ", we propose that the subpulse drifting for psr b0818@xmath041 is most likely first order aliased , and the corresponding carousel rotation period @xmath23 s. this implies that psr b0818@xmath041 has the fastest known carousel . + ( 5 ) 180phase shift between the spark locations on the inner and the outer rings is needed in the simulation to match the observed plr of the drift pattern , which implies that the sparks that are maximally packed on the polar cap .",
    "+ ( 6 ) for all pulsars for which we know drifting from more than one ring ( e.g. psr b0826@xmath034 and possibly psr b0815@xmath1109 ) , the drift pattern in the inner and outer rings are always phase locked .",
    "this could be a significant constraint for the theoretical models of pulsar radio emission , and favors an emission model that considers pulsar radio emission as a pan magnetospheric phenomenon .",
    "hence , the results from the observations , simulations and the follow up interpretations , enable fair amount of insight towards the emission properties of the unique drifting pulsar b0818@xmath041 .",
    "this study will also have significant contribution to constrain the theoretical models explaining the possible emission mechanism of pulsars .",
