    "the evolutions of magnetic fields such as generation , amplification ( dynamo ) , and annihilation ( reconnection ) are commonly observed in most celestial phenomena which include the interactions between magnetic fields and conducting fluids .",
    "the kinetic energy in the plasma motion can be transferred into the magnetic energy(dynamo ) , and this energy cascades toward smaller scale eddies and grows ( small scale dynamo ) , or cascades toward larger scale ones and grows ( large scale dynamo ) . in mhd dynamo",
    "the role of helical kinetic motion ( kinetic helicity , @xmath11 , @xmath12 ) is relatively clear : it generates the magnetic energy ( helicity ) and cascades the energy ( helicity ) to the larger scale magnetic eddies .",
    "however , the physical role and meaning of helical magnetic field ( magnetic helicity , @xmath13 , @xmath14 ) are not yet fully understood .",
    "@xmath1 is the topological measure of twist and linkage of magnetic field lines ( @xmath15 , @xmath16 , krause & rdler 1980 , moffatt 1978 ) in the minimum state of energy equilibrium .",
    "helical magnetic field is called ` force free field ' because it makes lorentz force ( @xmath17 ) @xmath18 ( biskamp 2003 ) . on the contrary , magnetic helicity",
    "is also related to the particle resonant scattering in the interplanetary magnetic fields when the handedness of helical magnetic field is the same as that of helical motion of a particle ( brown et al .",
    "1999 ) . and like magnetic energy(@xmath0 )",
    ", @xmath1 is conserved in ideal plasmas .",
    "so the increasing large scale magnetic helicity leads to the generation and cascade of oppositely signed magnetic helicity toward smaller scale .",
    "then , @xmath1 in the small scale ( more exactly current helicity , @xmath19 ) plays the role of constraining the growth of @xmath20 fields ( blackman & field 2002 ) . as an another example",
    ", quickly grown @xmath1 is ejected into the solar wind rather than being quenched ; instead , the equal amount of oppositely signed @xmath1 is generated and stays in the sun . these last two examples and explanations",
    "are based on the conservation and redistribution of @xmath1 , so that they show only partial features of @xmath1 .",
    "+ we are interested in the unique roles of helical & nonhelical magnetic energy and their relation in mhd dynamo .",
    "but , it is not easy to answer to these questions because magnetic helicity assumes the existence of magnetic energy .",

    "1975 ) is satisfied .",
    "so , we look for another indirect way to investigate @xmath0 and @xmath1 in mhd dynamo . + before we go further , we need to make clear the statistical meaning of @xmath1 .",
    "the correlation @xmath23 can be represented by two invariants @xmath0 and @xmath1 like ( lesieur 1987 , park 2013 , yoshizawa 2011 ) @xmath24 in a homogeneous and isotropic ( reflectionally symmetric ) system , only the trace @xmath25 ( @xmath26 ) survives .",
    "off - diagonal term @xmath27 ( @xmath28 ) which is related to @xmath1 does not exist .",
    "this means that the second order correlation independent of translation and rotation ( including reflection symmetry ) can be described by the invariant variable @xmath0 ( robertson 1940 ) .",
    "actually most of the turbulence theories accept this assumption , and @xmath0 is used to describe the correlation @xmath27 .",
    "however , a system with such a strict condition is not common in nature . if there is a rotation , although the system is still isotropic , the reflection symmetry is broken so that @xmath27 can not be ignored .",
    "this off - diagonal term can be described by another invariant quantity , helicity .",
    "this formula implies helical fields are essentially related to the statistical correlations between ` @xmath29 ' and ` @xmath30 ' in an isotropic system .",
    "for example , current helicity @xmath31(@xmath32 ) can not exist without the off - diagonal correlation : @xmath33 but strictly speaking eq.(1 ) is a description of the second correlation tensor rather than a conservation law .",

    "the helical kinetic and magnetic field are related to the inverse cascade of the magnetic energy .",
    "the nonhelical magnetic fields can generate the helical magnetic fields and constrain the plasma motion through lorentz force .",
    "not much about nonhelical magnetic field has been known yet . in this paper , we assumed a homogeneous and isotropic system for simplicity .",
    "however , if there is a mean or large scale magnetic field in the system , the kinetic and magnetic field is not isotropic anymore , which leads to the modification of @xmath249 dynamo model .",
    "we will leave this topic for the future work .",

    "<S> we investigated the influence of small scale magnetic energy ( @xmath0 ) and magnetic helicity ( @xmath1 ) on the growth rate ( @xmath2 ) of large scale magnetic field ( @xmath3 ) . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath1 that plays a key role in mhd dynamo is a topological concept describing the structural properties of magnetic fields . </S>",
    "<S> so , it is not possible to differentiate the intrinsic properties of @xmath1 from the influence of @xmath0 , and vice versa . </S>",
    "<S> however , to understand mhd dynamo the features of helical and nonhelical magnetic field should be made clear . </S>",
    "<S> for this , we made a detour : we gave each simulation set its own initial condition ( @xmath4 , same @xmath0(0 ) and specific @xmath1(0 ) at @xmath5 ) , and then drove the system with positive helical kinetic energy(@xmath5 ) . according to the simulation results , @xmath0(0 ) , whether or not helical , increases the growth rate of @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> the positive @xmath1(0 ) boosts the increased growth rate , but the negative @xmath1(0 ) decreases it . to explain these results two coupled equations of @xmath1 and @xmath0 </S>",
    "<S> were derived and solved using a simple approximate method . </S>",
    "<S> the equations imply that helical magnetic field generates the whole ( helical and nonhelical ) magnetic field but quenches itself . </S>",
    "<S> nonhelical magnetic field also generates the whole magnetic field but quenches itself . </S>",
    "<S> the initially given @xmath0(0 ) modifies the electromotive force ( @xmath6 , @xmath7 ) and generates new terms . </S>",
    "<S> the effects of these terms depend on the magnetic diffusivity @xmath8 , position of initial conditions @xmath9 , and time . </S>",
    "<S> but the influence disappears as time passes ( @xmath10 ) , so the saturated magnetic fields are independent of the initial conditions . </S>"
