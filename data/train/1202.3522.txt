    "the derived analytical formula to calculate intensities of the neutrinos produced by the gzk mechanism in the range between 100  pev and 10  eev is used to constrain the cosmological evolution of the uhecr sources .    the largest uncertainty in the present analytical formula at the lower energy range ( @xmath116 @xmath117 1  eev ) is due to the omission of the ir contribution to the cosmogenic neutrino production .",
    "photo - produced pions from the uhecr interactions with the ir background are major origin of neutrinos with energies below 10  pev , however , they are relatively minor in the higher energies where we mainly discuss in the aspect of the cosmogenic neutrino detection by icecube .",
    "the amount of the ir contribution was studied , for example , in the calculations in refs .",
    "the study in the former reference exhibits much higher contribution of the ir background than in the latter where the effect is suppressed mainly due to the introduction of the minimal energy of extra - galactic uhecr population .",

    "for instance , the difference of their estimate for the scenario of @xmath119 found in table  [ table : fluxes ] arises from their assumption of very steep uhecr spectrum leading to a minimal @xmath89 estimation .",
    "this uncertainty is , however , expected to be reduced in future when the statistical uncertainties in the observations of uhecrs and@xmath120or the systematic uncertainty in the energy estimation are improved .",
    "we would like to also emphasize that the neutrino intensity below 10  eev is not largely affected by the detailed behavior of uhecr proton propagation in extra - galactic space .",
    "this is because these neutrinos are mostly generated at cosmological distances away , which are substantially longer than the uhecr proton energy attenuation length in the cmb field .",
    "it is also suggested by no explicit dependence of @xmath58 in the final formula eq .",
    "[ eq : gzk_final ] .",
    "this is related with the fact that the cosmogenic flux below 10  eev is relatively insensitive to @xmath67 and @xmath121 , the maximal injection energy of uhecr protons from their sources and the spectral index of uhecr spectrum , respectively , while the flux above 10  eev is sensitive to those parameters  @xcite .",
    "a scan of the parameter spaces of the cosmogenic neutrino sources for some known classes of astronomical objects with a numerical monte - carlo method was made in ref .",
    "@xcite and it was also shown that the intensity around 1  eev is stable against @xmath67 variation and the transition models between the galactic and extra - galactic cosmic - ray components .",
    "these observations are consistent with the fact that the neutrino intensities around 1 eev by the relatively old works  @xcite assuming harder uhecr spectrum of @xmath122 and higher @xmath67 , and those by the recent works  @xcite with @xmath123 shows an agreement also within a factor of two .",
    "the difference between the present analytical formula and the full blown simulation above @xmath110  eev in figure  [ fig : gzk_fluxes_comparison ] is attributed to responses to @xmath67 .",
    "the present analytical estimates of neutrino fluxes for 100  pev @xmath106 10  eev , the main energy range by the icecube cosmogenic neutrino search , is robust against these parameters .",
    "we should note however that we use @xmath89 for the normalization constant assuming @xmath92 .",
    "if @xmath67 is comparable or lower than @xmath90 , the neutrino yield strongly depends on @xmath67 and the present simple treatment is not capable of providing reasonable estimates of the cosmogenic neutrino fluxes .",
    "the present analysis indicates that a five - year observation by the icecube observatory will scan the source evolution parameter space of the most interest where many of the proposed uhecr astronomical sources are distributed . a null neutrino observation",
    "then would imply that either uhecr sources are only locally distributed ( @xmath124 ) , very weakly evolved ( @xmath125 ) , or the uhecrs are not proton dominated but heaver nuclei such as irons after all .",
    "the first two possibilities may lead to a speculation about the highest energy particle emission from an entirely different and probably dimmer class of objects than currently suggested .",
    "the last possibility has also been discussed with the measurement of the depth of maximum of air - showers by the auger collaboration  @xcite .",
    "neutrino search in ultra - high energies provides a complementary constraint on the proton fraction of uhecrs in this case  @xcite .",
    "we have derived the analytical formula to estimate the cosmogenic neutrino fluxes for wide range of cosmological evolution parameters of uhecr emission sources .",
    "the analytical formula provides a practical tool for estimating the neutrino intensity at around eev energy region with a limited accuracy within a factor of @xmath1two .",
    "the obtained analytical estimates have indicated that the present icecube neutrino limit in 100  pev  10  eev energies disfavors the scenarios with the strongly - evolved uhecr sources .",
    "the future icecube observation will be able to scan most of the interesting parameter space of uhecr source evolution .",
    "furthermore , while the deep and highly energetic part of universe is inaccessible with photons or cosmic - rays due to the cmb field , the current study implies that the neutrinos can be used as a rare tool to probe the far universe .    with the greater statistics of ultra - high energy neutrino detections by the future neutrino telescopes of @xmath1100  km@xmath126 areas , such as ara  @xcite and arianna  @xcite , the analytical formula allows us to specify the astronomical classes of ultra - high energy cosmic - ray sources .",

    "<S> astrophysical neutrinos are expected to be produced in the interactions of ultra - high energy cosmic - rays with surrounding photons . </S>",
    "<S> the fluxes of the astrophysical neutrinos are highly dependent on the characteristics of the cosmic - ray sources , such as their cosmological distributions . </S>",
    "<S> we study possible constraints on the properties of cosmic - ray sources in a model - independent way using experimentally obtained diffuse neutrino flux above 100  pev . </S>",
    "<S> the semi - analytic formula is derived to estimate the cosmogenic neutrino fluxes as functions of source evolution parameter and source extension in redshift . </S>",
    "<S> the obtained formula converts the upper - limits on the neutrino fluxes into the constraints on the cosmic - ray sources . </S>",
    "<S> it is found that the recently obtained upper - limit on the cosmogenic neutrinos by icecube constrains the scenarios with strongly evolving ultra - high energy cosmic - ray sources , and the future limits from an 1  km@xmath0 scale detector are able to further constrain the ultra - high energy cosmic - rays sources with evolutions comparable to the cosmic star formation rate . </S>"
