    "since for the three - dimensional ( 3d ) ising model it is well known that @xmath0 , quenched , random disorder should be relevant for this model . in three dimensions ( 3d )",

    "we study the spin 1/2 ferromagnetic ising mixed - bond model defined by the following hamiltonian    @xmath3    where the sum extends over all pairs of neighboring sites on a cubic lattice of linear size l with periodic boundary conditions , @xmath4 and the exchange couplings @xmath5 are allowed to take two different values @xmath6 and 0 .",
