    "in the century following the discovery of superconductivity , a large number of studies were devoted to its theoretical explanation . thanks to these studies there has been much progress in understanding superconductivity . however , the physical mechanisms which determine the presence of specific critical parameters for a particular superconductor - its critical temperature and critical magnetic field , is still not able to be fully explained .",
    "there are several theories that describe superconductivity .",
    "the microscopic bcs - theory , created in the 50s , is generally accepted .",
    "it is based on the assumption that superconductivity arises from the union of electrons into cooper pairs , due to their interaction with phonons .",
    "it seems that the phonon mechanism of superconductivity is confirmed by the existence of the isotope effect , i.e. the existence of the superconductor critical temperature dependence from the mass of the isotopes @xcite , @xcite .",
    "however , more recent studies have shown that isotopic substitution causes a change in the lattice parameters of metals and thus directly affects properties of their electronic systems .",
    "dissatisfaction with the bcs theory therefore has lead to a number of other theories , in which the pairing of electrons is explained by alternative mechanisms .",
    "it seems that the association of electron pairs may be due to the magnetic interaction between the electron dipole moments ( see below ) . generally speaking , the nature of the specific mechanism - that would contain a phonon or nonphonon - which is essentially responsible for the pairing of electrons - is not important .",
    "it is important that such a mechanism has worked over the entire all temperature range of all superconductivity existence",
    ". a working mechanism of electron pairing is a necessary yet insufficient condition for the existence of the superconducting state .",
    "the reason for this stems from the fact that the paired electrons can not form the superconducting condensate .",
    "the individual pairs differ from each other because they make disordered zero - point oscillations and there are no forces of attraction between them . only after ordering the zero - point oscillations of the electron pairs and",
    "an attraction force appears , the energy of the system can then be lowered and a superconducting condensate can be formed by particles on the minimum energy level .    with this reason",
    "the ordering of zero - point oscillations must be considered as the cause of the occurrence of superconductivity .",
    "the calculation of the properties of the condensate of the ordered zero - point oscillations allows us to predict the fundamental properties of superconductors .",
    "if the characteristic features of an ordered condensate coincide with the observed properties of superconductors , this builds a case that the phenomenon of superconductivity is due to the zero - point oscillations ordering of the electron gas",
    ".    we will therefore consider this process of ordering oscillations in greater detail so as to observe and note characteristics of the condensate , and then to compare them with the characteristics of superconductors .",
    "the roles of zero - point oscillations in the superconducting state formation have been previously considered in the paper @xcite .",
    "j.bardeen was first who turned his attention toward a possible link between superconductivity and zero - point oscillations @xcite .",
    "the special role of zero - point vibrations exists due to the fact that at low temperatures all movements of electrons in metals have been freezen except these oscillations .",
    "superconducting condensate formation requires two mechanisms : first , the electrons must be united in boson pairs , and then the zero - point fluctuations must be ordered ( see fig.([spe ] ) ) .      the energetically favorable pairing of electrons in the electron gas should occur above the critical temperature .",
    "it seems the pairing of electrons can occur due to the magnetic dipole - dipole interaction .    for the magnetic dipole - dipole interaction to merge two electrons into the singlet pair at the temperature of about 10k",
    ", the distance between these particles must be small enough : @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the bohr radius .",
    "i.e. two collectivized electrons must be localized in a volume of one lattice site .",
    "it is agreed that the superconductivity can occur only in metals with two collectivized electrons per atom , and can not exist in the monovalent alkali and noble metals .",
    "it is easy to see that the presence of magnetic moments on ion sites should interfere with the magnetic combination of electrons .",
    "this is confirmed by the experimental fact : as there are no strong magnetic substances among superconductors , and an adding iron , for example , to traditional superconducting alloys always leads to a lower critical temperature .",
    "on the other hand , this magnetic coupling should not be destroyed at the critical temperature .",
    "the interaction energy between two electrons , with their location near one of the lattice site , can be much greater .",
    "this is confirmed by experiments which show that throughout the period of the magnetic flux quantization there is no change at the transition through the critical temperature of superconductor @xcite , @xcite .",
    "the outcomes of these experiments are evidence that the existence of the mechanism of electron pairing is a necessary but not a sufficient condition for the existence of superconductivity .",
    "the above proposed the dipole - dipole mechanism of electron pairing can be seen as an assumption which is consistent with the measurement data and therefore needs a more detailed theoretic consideration and further refinement .    on the other hand , this issue is not very important in the grander scheme , because the nature of the mechanism that causes electron pairing does not paramount importance .",
    "instead , it is important that there is any mechanism in place that converts the electron gas in an ensemble of charged bosons with zero spin in the considered temperature range ( as well as in a some range of temperatures above @xmath2 ) .",
    "if the temperature is not sufficiently low , the electron pairs still exist but their zero - point oscillations are disordered . upon reaching the @xmath2 ,",
    "the interaction between zero - point oscillations should cause their ordering and therefore a superconducting state is created .",
    "the principal condition for the superconducting state formation - the ordering of zero - point oscillations - is realized due to the fact that the paired electrons , which obey bose - einstein statistics , interact with each other .    at",
    "they interact , their amplitudes , frequencies and phases of zero - point oscillations become ordered .",
    "let an electron gas have density @xmath3 and its fermi - energy is @xmath4 .",
    "each electron of this gas can be considered as fixed inside a cell with linear dimension @xmath5 : @xmath6    if the interactions of the electron gas are ignored , then its fermi - energy can be written as @xcite : @xmath7    however , a conduction electron interacts with the ion at its zero - point oscillations . if we consider the ions system as a positive background uniformly spread over the cells , the electron inside one cell has the potential energy : @xmath8 an electron will perform zero - point oscillations inside a cell .",
    "if the amplitude of these oscillations is equal @xmath9 , their energy is : @xmath10 in accordance with the virial theorem @xcite , if a particle executes a finite motion , its potential energy @xmath11 should be associated with its kinetic energy @xmath12 through the simple relation @xmath13 . in this regard , we find that the amplitude of the zero - point oscillations of an electron in a cell is : @xmath14    coming from the quantization condition of zero - point oscillations @xmath15 one can determinate the frequency of zero - point oscillations @xmath16 and their wavelength @xmath17 .",
    "these zero - point oscillations form an oscillating electric dipole moment of the electron with the amplitude value : @xmath18 the interaction of dipole moments at low enough temperatures should lead to a coherent condensate in the zero - point oscillations of the electron gas . as a result of this interaction ,",
    "the energy of the interacting particles will decrease in value : @xmath19 where @xmath20 is a distance between particles of condensate , and @xmath21 is its density .",
    "let us consider an electrically charged quantum oscillator at zero - point fluctuations , and estimate the variation of the energy that it gets during an interaction with another similar oscillator .",
    "we will consider two particles with mass @xmath22 and charge @xmath23 , spaced at a distance of @xmath24 and oscillating with frequency @xmath16 .",
    "their movement will be assumed to be very slow , and we can neglect a retardation of their fields .",
    "let @xmath25 be the displacement of the considered particle at the oscillations .",
    "the schrodinger equation can be written as : @xmath26\\psi(x)=\\mathcal{e}\\psi(x),%\\label{tctf}\\ ] ] where @xmath27 is the energy of the interaction between two particles which are placed at a distance @xmath24 .",
    "this energy is the sum of the interaction energy of a divalent fixed ion ( @xmath28 and with an oscillating electron pair ( at oscillation with the same amplitude in the opposite phase @xmath29 ) . under these conditions , and at @xmath30",
    "the interaction energy can be written as : @xmath31 and the schrodinger equation : @xmath32 the replacing of the variable @xmath33 leads to changing of the schrodinger equation : @xmath34\\psi(\\xi)=0.%\\label{tctf}\\ ] ] if to note @xmath35 , as result we obtain : @xmath36\\psi(\\xi)=0.%\\label{tctf}\\ ] ] this equation describes the oscillations of a simple harmonic oscillator with a zero - point energy @xmath37 thus , the changing of energy at its interaction with the similar oscillator : @xmath38    within the oscillations of the electron clouds there is the antiphase , where the distance between them must be equal to the half of the length of the electromagnetic wave : @xmath39 or at taking into account the quantization condition ( [ qu ] ) : @xmath40 at the known amplitude of oscillations ( [ a0 ] ) , we can obtain the condition of the antiphase oscillations : @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the fine structure constant . with using of the fermi energy determination ( [ ef ] ) , we can obtain @xmath43 each of the oscillating dipoles has several neighbors .",
    "their oscillating fields affect the ordering of the ensemble in same way . taking this in to account",
    ", the ratio of the critical temperature of zero - point oscillations ordering to the fermi temperature should be close to @xmath44      from eq.([lom ] ) it follows @xmath45 and this forms the ratio of the condensate particle density to the fermi gas density : @xmath46 when using these equations , we can find a linear dimension of localization for an electron pair : @xmath47 or , taking into account eq.([a0 ] ) , we can obtain the relation between the density of particles in the condensate and the value of the energy gap : @xmath48 or @xmath49 it should be noted that the obtained ratios for the zero - point oscillations condensate ( of bose - particles ) differ from the corresponding expressions for the bose - condensate of particles , which are obtained in many courses ( see eg @xcite ) .",
    "the expressions for the ordered condensate of zero - point oscillations have an additional coefficient @xmath50 on the right side of eq.([d-2 ] ) .    the obtained eqs.([n0-ne ] ) ,",
    "( [ def ] ) and ( [ tctf ] ) illustrate important characteristics of the zero - point oscillations of the bose - condensate in fermi - gas environment .",
    "if there are internal relations between the condensate of zero - point oscillations and superconductivity , these equations should be characteristics of superconductors .",
    "the comparison of these equations with measurement data of superconductors is shown in tables ( [ de].1 ) and ( [ de].3 ) .",
    "the wavelength of zero - point oscillations @xmath51 in this model is a some analogue of the pippard coherence length in the bcs .",
    "as usually accepted @xcite , the coherence length @xmath52 .",
    "the ratio of these lengths , taking into account eq.([def ] ) , is simply the constant : @xmath53    the attractive forces arising between the dipoles located at a distance @xmath54 from each other and vibrating in opposite phase , create pressure in the system : @xmath55 in this regard , sound into this condensation should propagate with the velocity : @xmath56 after the appropriate substitutions , the speed of sound in the condensate can be expressed through the fermi velocity of electron gas @xmath57    the condensate particles moving with velocity @xmath58 have the kinetic energy : @xmath59 therefore , by either heating the condensate to the critical temperature when each of its volume obtains the energy @xmath60 , or initiating the current of its particles with a velocity exceeding @xmath58 , can achieve the destruction of the condensate .",
    "( because the condensate of charged particles oscillations is considered , destroying its coherence can be also obtained at the application of a sufficiently strong magnetic field .",
    "see below . )",
    "the phenomenon of condensation of zero - point oscillations in the electron gas has characteristic features .",
    "there are several ways of destroying the zero - point oscillations condensate in electron gas :    firstly , it can be evaporated by heating . in this case , evaporation of the condensate should possess the properties of an order - disorder transition .    secondly , due to the fact that the oscillating electrons carry electric charge , the condensate can be destroyed by the application of a sufficiently strong magnetic field .",
    "for this reason , the critical temperature and critical magnetic field of the condensate will be interconnected .",
    "this interconnection should manifest itself through the relationship of the critical temperature and critical field of the superconductors , if superconductivity occurs as result of an ordering of zero - point fluctuations .",
    "let us assume that at a given temperature @xmath61 the system of vibrational levels of conducting electrons consists of only two levels :    firstly , basic level which is characterized by an anti - phase oscillations of the electron pairs at the distance @xmath62 , and    secondly , excited , characterized by in - phase oscillation of the pairs .",
    "let the population of the basic level be @xmath63 particles and the excited level has @xmath64 particles .",
    "two electron pairs with an in - phase oscillation have a high energy of interaction and therefore can not form the condensate .",
    "the condensate can be formed only by the particles that make up the difference between the populations of levels @xmath65 . in a dimensionless form ,",
    "this difference defines the order parameter : @xmath66 in the theory of superconductivity , by definition , the order parameter is determined by the value of the energy gap @xmath67 when taking a counting of energy from the level @xmath68 , we obtain @xmath69 passing to dimensionless variables @xmath70 , @xmath71 and @xmath72 we have @xmath73 this equation describes the temperature dependence of the energy gap in the spectrum of zero - point oscillations .",
    "it coincides in form with other equations describing other physical phenomena , which are also characterized by the existence of the temperature dependence of order parameters @xcite,@xcite .",
    "for example , this dependence coincides with temperature dependencies of the concentration of the superfluid component in liquid helium or the spontaneous magnetization of ferromagnetic materials .",
    "this equation is common for all order - disorder transitions ( the phase transitions of ii - type in the landau classification ) .",
    "the solution of this equation , obtained by the iteration method , is shown in fig.([d - t ] ) .    ) . ]",
    "this decision very accurately coincides with the known transcendental equation of the bcs , which was obtained by the integration of the phonon spectrum , and is in a satisfactory agreement with the measurement data .",
    "after numerical integrating we can obtain the averaging value of the gap : @xmath74      to convert the condensate into the normal state , we must raise half of its particles into the excited state ( according to eq.([det ] ) , the gap collapses under this condition ) . to do this , taking into account eq.([0.8 ] ) , the unit volume of condensate should have the energy : @xmath75 on the other hand , we can obtain the normal state of an electrically charged condensate when applying a magnetic field of critical value @xmath76 with the density of energy : @xmath77 as a result , we acquire the condition : @xmath78 this created a relation of the critical temperature to the critical magnetic field of the zero - point oscillations condensate of the charged bosons .    the comparison of the critical energy densities @xmath79 and @xmath80 for type i superconductors are shown in fig.([eh - et2 ] ) .",
    "( eq.([et ] ) ) and @xmath80 ( eq.([eh ] ) ) for the type i superconductors . ]    as shown , the obtained agreement between the energies @xmath81 ( eq.([et]))and @xmath82 ( eq.([eh ] ) ) is quite satisfactory for type i superconductors @xcite,@xcite .",
    "a similar comparison for type - ii superconductors shows results that differ in approximately by a factor two .",
    "the reason for this will be considered below .",
    "the correction of this calculation , has not apparently made sense here .",
    "the purpose of these calculations was to show that the description of superconductivity as the effect of the condensation of ordered zero - point oscillations is in accordance with the available experimental data .",
    "this goal is considered reached in the simple case of i - type superconductors .",
    "the direct influence of the external magnetic field of the critical value applied to the electron system is too weak to disrupt the dipole - dipole interaction of two paired electrons : @xmath83 in order to violate the superconductivity so as to destroy the ordering of the electron zero - point oscillations . for this the presence of relatively weak magnetic field",
    "is required .    by using of eqs.([th1 ] ) and",
    "( [ t-2 ] ) , we can express the gap through the critical magnetic field and the magnitude of the oscillating dipole moment : @xmath84 the properties of the zero - point oscillations of the electrons should not be dependent on the characteristics of the mechanism of association and also on the condition of the existence of electron pairs .",
    "therefore , we should expect that this equation would also be valid for type i superconductors , as well as for type - ii superconductors ( for type - ii superconductor @xmath85 is the first critical field )    a satisfaction of this condition is illustrated on the fig.([rd2 ] ) .",
    "let us consider the process of heating the electron gas in metal .",
    "when heating , the electrons from levels slightly below the fermi - energy are raised to higher levels . as a result , the levels closest to the fermi level , from which at low temperature electrons were forming bosons , become vacant .    at critical temperature @xmath2 , all electrons from the levels of energy bands from @xmath86 to @xmath4 move to higher levels ( and the gap collapses ) . at this temperature superconductivity",
    "is therefore destroyed completely .",
    "this band of energy can be filled by @xmath87 particles : @xmath88 where @xmath89 is the fermi - dirac function and @xmath90 is number of states per an unit energy interval , a deuce front of the integral arises from the fact that there are two electron at each energy level .    to find the density of states @xmath90",
    ", one needs to find the difference in energy of the system at @xmath91 and finite temperature : @xmath92 for the calculation of the density of states @xmath90 , we must note that two electrons can be placed on each level .",

    ", the calculated ratio of the zero - point oscillations condensate density to the density of fermions in accordance with eq.([n0-ne ] ) should be near to @xmath104 .",
    "these ratios for experimental data of type - i superconductors ( @xcite-@xcite ) are shown in the right part of table ( [ n0e].1 ) .",

    "the superconducting careers populates the energetic level @xmath106 . during the destruction of superconductivity through heating ,",
    "an each heated career increases its thermal vibration . if the effective velocity of vibration is @xmath107 , its kinetic energy : @xmath108",
    "only a fraction of the heat energy transferred to the metal is consumed in order to to increase the kinetic energy of the electron gas in the transition metals .",
    "another part of the energy will be spent on the magnetic interaction of a moving electron .    at contact with the d - shell electron ,",
    "a moving free electron induces onto it the magnetic field of the order of value : @xmath109 the magnetic moment of the d - electron is approximately equal to the bohr magneton .",
    "therefore the energy of the magnetic interaction between the moving electron of conductivity and the d - electron is approximately equal to : @xmath110 this energy is not connected with the process of destruction of superconductivity .",
    "whereas , in metals with a filled d - shell ( type - i superconductors ) , the whole heating energy increases the kinetic energy of the conductivity electrons and only a small part of the heating energy is spent on it in transition metals : @xmath111 so approximately @xmath112    therefore , whereas the dependence of the gap in type - i superconductors from the heat capacity is defined by eq.([tcc ] ) , it is necessary to take into account the relation eq.([kmu ] ) in type - ii superconductors for the determination of this gap dependence . as a result of this estimation , we can obtain : @xmath113 where @xmath95 is the fitting parameter .",
    "the comparison of the results of these calculations with the measurement data ( fig.([tc2 g ] ) ) shows that for the majority of type ii superconductors the estimation eq.([delta2 ] ) can be considered quite satisfactory .. it would seem that in view of this metallic mg - ion must have electron shell like the ne - atom .",
    "therefore it is logical to expect that the critical temperature of mg can be calculated by the formula for i - type superconductors .",
    "but actually in order to get the value of @xmath114 , the critical temperature of mg should be calculated by the formula ( [ delta2 ] ) , which is applicable to the description of metals with an unfilled inner shell .",

    "also consider that the specific heat of superconductors i and ii - types are differing considerably .",
    "there are some difficulties by determining the answer this way - as we do not known truly the density of the electron gas in high - temperature superconductors .",
    "however , the densities of atoms in metals do not differ too much and we can use eq.([tcc ] ) for the solution of the problem of the i- and ii - types superconductors distinguishing .",

    "the length of their localisation determines the limiting momentum of superconducting carriers : @xmath161 therefore , by using the eq.([cs ] ) , we can obtain that the critical velocity of superconducting carriers is : @xmath162 and this velocity is about a hundred times smaller than the fermi velocity .",
    "the sound velocity in the crystal lattice of metal @xmath163 , in accordance with the bohm - staver relation @xcite , has approximately the same value : @xmath164 this therefore , makes it possible to consider superconductivity being destroyed as a superconducting carrier overcomes the sound barrier .",
    "that is , if they moved without friction at a speed that was less than that of sound , after it gained speed and the speed of sound was surpassed , it then acquire a mechanism of friction .",
    "therefore , it is conceivable that if the speed of sound in the metal lattice is less than @xmath58 , then it would create a restriction on the limiting current in the superconductor .",
    "if this is correct , then superconductors with high critical parameters should have not only a high fermi energy of their electron gas , but also have a high speed of sound in their lattice .",
    "it is in agreement with the fact that ceramics have higher elastic moduli compared to metals and alloys and also posses mouch higher critical temperatures ( fig.[vsg ] ) .",
    "c - the dot - dashed line . ]    [ vsg ]    the dependence of the critical temperature on the square of the speed of sound @xcite ) is illustrated in fig.([vsg ] ) .",
    "this figure , which can be viewed only as a rough estimation due to the lack of necessary experimental data , shows that the elastic modulus of ceramics with a critical temperature close to room temperature should be close to the elastic modulus of sapphire , which is very difficult to achieve .",
    "in addition , such ceramics would be deprived of yet an other important quality - their adaptability . indeed , in order to obtain a thin wire , we require a plastic superconductor .    a solution of this problem would be to find a material that possesses an acceptably high critical temperature ( above 80k ) and also experiences a phase transition at an even higher temperature of heat treatment",
    ". it would be possible to make a thin wire from a superconductor near the point of phase transition , as the elastic modules are typically not usually very strong at this stage .",
    "this considered formation of mechanism for the superconducting state provides a possibility of obtaining the estimations of the critical parameters of superconductors , which in most cases is in satisfactory agreement with measured data .",
    "for some superconductors , this agreement is stronger , and for other , such as ir , al , v ( see fig.([tc2 g ] ) ) , it is expedient to carry out further theoretical and experimental studies due to causes of deviations .",
    "the mechanism of magnetic electron pairing is also of fundamental interest in order to further clarify this .",
    "as was found earlier , in the cylinders made from certain superconducting metals ( al@xcite and mg@xcite ) , the observed magnetic flux quantization has exactly the same period above @xmath2 and that below @xmath2 .",
    "the authors of these studies attributed this to the influence of a special effect .",
    "it seems more natural to think that the stability of the period is a result of the pairing of electrons due to magnetic dipole - dipole interaction continuing to exist at temperatures above @xmath2 , despite the disappearance of the material s superconducting properties . at this temperature the coherence of the zero - point fluctuations",
    "is destroyed , and with it so is the superconductivity .",
    "the pairing of electrons due to dipole - dipole interaction should be absent in the monovalent metals . in these metals",
    ", the conduction electrons are localized in the lattice at very large distances from each other .",
    "it is therefore interesting to compare the period of quantization in the two cases . in a thin cylinder made of a superconductor , such as mg , above @xmath2",
    "the quantization period is equal to @xmath165 . in the same cylinder of a noble metal ( such as gold ) , the sampling period should be twice as large .",
    "the attention of experimentalists could be attracted to the isotope effect in superconductors , which served as a starting point of the bcs theory . in the 50s",
    "it had been experimentally established that there is a dependence of the critical temperature of superconductors due to the mass of the isotope . because the effect depends on the ion mass ,",
    "this is considered to be because of the fact that it is based on the vibrational ( phonon ) process .",
    "the isotope effect for a number of i - type superconductors - @xmath166 - can be described by the relationship : @xmath167 where @xmath168 - the mass of the isotope , @xmath2 is the critical temperature .",
    "the isotope effect in other superconductors can either be described by other dependencies , or is absent altogether .    in recent decades , however , the effects associated with the replacement of isotopes in the metal lattice have been studied in detail .",
    "it was shown that the zero - point oscillations of ions in the lattice of many metals are non - harmonical .",
    "therefore , the isotopic substitution can directly affect the lattice parameters , the density of the lattice and the density of the electron gas in the metal , on its fermi energy and on other properties of the electron subsystem .",
    "the direct study of the effect of isotopic substitution on the lattice parameters of superconducting metals has not been carried out .",
    "the results of measurements made on @xmath169 , @xmath170 , diamond and light metals , such as @xmath171 ( @xcite , @xcite)(researchers prefer to study crystals , where the isotope effects are large and it is easier to carry out appropriate measurements ) show that there is square - root dependence of the force constants on the isotope mass , which was required by eq.([ise ] ) .",
    "the same dependence of the force constants on the mass of the isotope has been found in tin @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , no direct experiments of the effect of isotopic substitution on the electronic properties ( such as the electronic specific heat and the fermi energy ) , on metals of interest to us have so far been conducted .",
    "let us consider what should be expected in such measurements . a convenient choice for the superconductor is mercury , as it has many isotopes and their isotope effect has been carefully measured back in the 50s of the last century as aforementioned .",
    "the linear dependence of the critical temperature of a superconductor on its fermi energy ( eq.([def ] ) ) and also the existence of the isotope effect suggests the dependence of the ion density in the crystal lattice from the mass of the isotope .",
    "let us consider what should be expected in such measurements .",
    "even then , it was found that the isotope effect is described by eq.([ise ] ) in only a few superconductors . in others ,",
    "it displays different values , and therefore in a general case it can be described by introducing of the parameter @xmath172 : @xmath173 at taking into account eq.([def ] ) , we can write @xmath174    the parameter @xmath175 which characterizes the ion lattice obtains an increment @xmath176 with an isotope substitution : @xmath177 where @xmath178 and @xmath179 are the mass of isotope and its increment .    it is generally accepted that in an accordance with the terms of the phonon mechanism , the parameter @xmath180 for mercury . however",
    ", the analysis of experimental data @xcite-@xcite ( see fig.([hgg ] ) ) shows that this parameter is actually closer to @xmath181 .",
    "accordingly , one can expect that the ratio of the mercury parameters is close to : @xmath182     must be about 1/2 ( the dotted line ) .",
    "as it can be seen , this coefficient is in reality approximately equal to 1/3 . ]",
    "the main features of the superfluidity of liquid helium became clear few decades ago @xcite , @xcite .",
    "l.d.landau explains this phenomenon as the manifestation of a quantum behavior of the macroscopic object",
    ".    however , the causes and mechanism of the formation of superfluidity are still unclear .",
    "there is no explanation as to why the @xmath183-transition in helium-4 occurs at about 2 k , i.e. at almost exactly half of its boiling point : @xmath184 while for helium-3 , this transition is only observed at temperatures of about a thousand times smaller .",
    "the effect of superfluidity can be seen as a consequence of ordering of the zero - point oscillations of he - atoms .",
    "the atoms in liquid helium-4 are electrically neutral , they have no dipole moments and do not form molecules .",
    "yet some electromagnetic mechanism has to be responsible for phase transformations of liquid helium ( as well as in other condensed substance where phase transformations are related with changes of energy of the same scale ) .    in liquid helium ,",
    "the atom density is @xmath185 @xmath186 .",
    "a separate atom is locked up by neighbors in a volume with linear dimensions roughly equal to @xmath187 cm .    according to the reference data @xcite ,",
    "the effective radius of the atom is @xmath188 cm . in the volume of localization ,",
    "an atom undergoes zero - point fluctuations , which conserve helium as a liquid even at @xmath105 .",
    "the formation of superfluidity suggests the transition of the ensemble of helium atoms into a completely ordered state . the full ordering should include the ordering of zero - point oscillations .",
    "the relationship of the frequency of zero - point oscillations @xmath16 with their amplitude @xmath9 can be determined from the condition of quantization : @xmath189 where @xmath190 g is the mass of the he-4 atom .",
    "the existence of a superfluid involves the `` stitching ''  of de broglie waves of neighboring atoms at the boundary of their cells : @xmath191 where @xmath192 is the momentum of the particle ; the coefficient @xmath193 arises from the assumption that half of the de broglie wavelength must be placed on each cell , to ensure the anti - phase zero - point oscillations of neighboring atoms within the superfluid state .",
    "this condition allows us to estimate the amplitude of the zero - point oscillations of an atom : @xmath194 and the amplitude of the oscillating acceleration experienced by the atom at zero - point oscillations : @xmath195    because of differences in the mass of the nucleus and electron shell , the forces of inertia attached to them will be different .",
    "it leads to their mutual oscillations .",
    "force applied to the shell can be neglected .",
    "the action of the force of inertia , which is attached to the nucleus , can be represented as an effect of an equivalent oscillating electric field : @xmath196 thus , an atom under the influence of inertial forces arising from the zero - point oscillations acquires an oscillating dipole moment , whose amplitude is proportional to the polarizability of helium @xmath197 @xcite : @xmath198 if we take into account the fact that the polarizability of atoms is approximately equal to their volume , we obtain for the liquid helium @xmath199@xmath200 , and as a result @xmath201    the energy of interaction between two dipoles depend on their relative orientation @xcite : @xmath202 where @xmath203 is the vector connecting these dipoles .",
    "as the temperature decreases , the longitudinal component of oscillations is first ordered due to the interaction of oscillating dipoles .",
    "the directivity of the longitudinal component coincides with the direction of the vector connecting the dipoles .",
    "the negative energy of this interaction speaks about an occurrence of attraction between the atoms at this particular ordering : @xmath204    there is no long - range ordering in liquids .",
    "but partial ordering of zero - point vibrations of atoms in a short - range order usually lead to a lowering of their energy in general , which makes this state an energetic utility .",
    "once these attractive forces become dominant , there will be a partial ordering of the zero - point oscillations of the atoms that occurs at temperature : @xmath205 which is in agreement with the temperature of helium liquefaction .",
    "the full ordering in the system happens when dipoles with a perpendicular orientation to the vector joining them become ordered .",
    "the energy of this interaction can be expressed as : @xmath206 ( the minus sign is taken away here because in this case the opposite direction of ordered dipoles is energetically favorable ) .",
    "thus , a total ordering of the zero - point fluctuations system of helium atoms occurs at half the liquefaction temperature : @xmath207",
    "these findings agree with the measurements of the transition temperature to the superfluid state .    the ratio of these two temperatures @xmath208 explains why the measured ratio of the boiling temperature to the temperature of @xmath183-transition is obtained as close to two ( eq.([f022 ] ) ) .",
    "the considered mechanism gives the possibility to estimate yet one characteristic parameter of the superfluid state .",
    "substitution of obtained parameters in formulas of sec.(2.2.4 ) allows us to estimate the speed of sound in superfluid helium .",
    "the obtained value of this velocity @xmath209 is in good agreement with the l.d.landau estimation .",
    "a similar explanation can be given to the transition of helium-3 to a superfluid state .",
    "in view of the fact that the properties of liquid helium-3 are close to the properties of helium-4 , it is possible to think that the ordering of zero - point oscillations in helium-3 should occur during approximately the same conditions .",
    "the difference is that for the complete ordering , the electromagnetic interaction has to additionally order the magnetic moments of the nuclei he-3 .",
    "we can estimate the temperature at which this ordering happens .",
    "due to the ordered zero - point oscillations , each electron shell creates an oscillating magnetic field on `` its '' nucleus : @xmath210 because the value magnetic moments of the nuclei he-3 is approximately equal to the nuclear bohr magneton @xmath211 , the ordering in their system must occur below the critical temperature @xmath212 this finding is in strong agreement with the measurement data .",
    "until now it has been commonly thought that the existence of the isotope effect in superconductors leaves only one way for explanation of the superconductivity phenomenon - the way based on the phonon mechanism .    over fifty years of theory development based on the phonon mechanism ,",
    "has not lead to success .",
    "all attempts to explain why some superconductors have certain critical temperatures ( and critical magnetic fields ) have failed .",
    "this problem was further exacerbated with the discovery of high temperature superconductors .",
    "how can we move forward in htsc understanding , if we can not understand the mechanism that determines the critical temperature elementary superconductors ?    in recent decades",
    ", experimenters have shown that isotopic substitution in metals leads to a change in the parameters of their crystal lattice and thereby affect the fermi energy of the metal . as results , the superconductivity can be based on a nonphonon mechanism .",
    "the theory proposed in this paper suggests that the specificity of the association mechanism of electrons pairing is not essential .",
    "it is merely important that such a mechanism was operational over the whole considered range of temperatures .",
    "the nature of the mechanism forming the electron pairs does not matter , because although the work of this mechanism is necessary it is still not a sufficient condition for the superconducting condensate s existence .",
    "this is caused by the fact that after the electron pairing , they still remain as non - identical particles and can not form the condensate , because the individual pairs differ from each other as they commit uncorrelated zero - point oscillations . only after an ordering of these zero - point oscillations , an energetically favorable lowering of the energy",
    "can be reached and a condensate at the level of minimum energy can then be formed . due to this reason",
    "the ordering of zero - point oscillations must be considered as the cause of the occurrence of superconductivity .",
    "therefore , the density of superconducting carriers and the critical temperature of a superconductor are determined by the fermi energy of the metal , the critical magnetic field of a superconductor is given by the mechanism of destruction of the coherence of zero - point oscillations .    in coclusion ,",
    "the consideration of zero - point oscillations allows us to construct the theory of superconductivity , which is characterized by the ability to give estimations for the critical parameters of elementary superconductors .",
    "these results are in satisfactory agreement with measured data ."
