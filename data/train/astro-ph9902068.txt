    "lithium is one of the great fossil records available in our local stellar environment .",
    "it was discovered by the spites @xcite in subdwarfs .",
    "apparently , the /h ratio , has survived all the way from 100 seconds after the big bang , to the birth of the first stars , and , more or less , subsequently in the atmospheres of these stars , in which we observe it , now , 13 gyr later .",
    "the value of this ratio , based on the analysis of 40 metal - poor stars ( bonifacio & molaro @xcite ) , is about 1.6@xmath0 ( by number , or @xmath1 by mass ) , close to the standard big bang nucleosynthesis prediction ( schramm & turner @xcite ) , for the @xmath2 ratio ( baryons / photons ) set by the other products of the sbbn .",
    "the debated question is that of the survival of in the atmospheres of the stars , during the 12 or 13 gyr they have spent on the main sequence .",
    "two processes can alter the initial lithium content : gravitional settlling at the bottom of the convective zone ( cz hereafter ) ( vauclair & charbonnel @xcite , and poster at this meeting ) , and mixing of the matter in the cz with deeper layers , in which the temperature allows nuclear burning of , ( schatzman ( 1977 ) , pinsonneault et al .",
    "@xcite , charbonnel et al .",
    "@xcite , montalban & schatzman @xcite ) .",
    "furthermore , kurucz ( 1995 ) has suggested that the abundance of lithium determined with plane - parallel atmospheres might be strongly in error , due to effects of temperature inhomogeneities in the convective zone , closer to the surface in metal - poor stars than in solar composition stars .",
    "we shall discuss here only the main process , the burning process by mixing of the cz with deeper layers , clearly acting on metal - poor stars of effective temperature below 5700 k ( see fig .",
    "1 ) , and responsible of a depletion of by a factor of 200 in the sun .    as has been also observed in two turnoff metal - poor stars , hd 84937 and hd 338529 , and burns at a lower temperature than , it is interesting to see what constraints the observation of brings on the maximum depletion of .",
    "the burning of these elements during pre - main - sequence has been computed using the cesam code ( morel @xcite .",
    "opacities are from rogers & iglesias @xcite , rogers et al .",
    "@xcite , alexander & fergusson @xcite , or kurucz @xcite the eff equation of state is used ( eggelton et al .",
    "the results are given in columns 3 and 6 of table 1 .",
    ".depletion of and , in dex , during the pms and ms phases ( values between parentheses are extrapolated and less reliable ) [ cols= \" < , < , < , < , < , < , < , < \" , ]     it must be noted that there is in all cases some depletion of during the pms , and that this depletion reaches 0.4 dex at metallicity -1.5 for a mass of 0.80 .",
    "pms depletion of is negligible in the range of masses considered here .",
    "depletions are counted as positive for a reduction in lithium abundance ( e.g. a depletion of 1.0 dex means that the present abundance is one tenth of the initial abundance ) .",
    "we shall use first a very simple model of destruction based on the fact that the rate of destruction of and varies as a function of depth almost as a step function . in the convective zone itself , and just below , the destruction rate is so small that no depletion of these elements occur in the time available ( 12 to 14 gyr ) . on a short length , of about one hundredth of the radius of the star , the rate increases to such a large value",
    "that the element is burnt everywhere below , in a time much smaller than the age of the object .",
    "the depletion in the well - mixed convective zone depends only upon its exchange of matter with the zone in which the element is totally burnt .",
    "the corresponding level is of course deeper for than for .",
    "for example , for a star of mass 0.80 and [ fe / h]=-2.0 , the transition occurs for at a depth of 0.155 below the bottom of the cz , in units of the stellar radius , but only at a depth of 0.10 for . under the assumption that the exchange of matter is driven by convective plumes penetrating the radiative zone , as suggested by hydrodynamical simulations ( stein & nordlund @xcite , rieutord & zahn @xcite ) ,",
    "the critical parameter for the exchange of matter between the cz and the burning zone is of course the separation between the two levels .    on fig .",
    "1 we have plotted depletions of according to two recents papers ( bonifacio & molaro @xcite , ryan & delyiannis @xcite ) , as a function of @xmath3 .",
    "we have also computed the distance @xmath4 of the top of the burning zone to the bottom of the convective zone , on the main sequence , with the cesam code , for a grid of models , with masses 0.70[0.05]0.85 ( the value between brackets is the step ) , metallicities [ fe / h]= -2.0[0.5]-1.0 an helium abundance near y@xmath5 = 0.23 , and an enhancement of @xmath6-elements by 0.4 dex .",
    "as @xmath7 is a result of the computation , this allows to redraw the depletion of as a function of @xmath4 . in this transformation",
    "we have allowed a shift of 0.01 between the theoretical @xmath3 and the observed @xmath3 , as shown necessary in cayrel et al .",
    "@xcite .    the result , shown in fig .",
    "2 , confirms the idea that @xmath4 is a key parameter for the control of depletion by burning .",
    "the two straight lines for the two metallicities [ fe / h ] = -1.5 and -2.0 can be approximated by the single relation : @xmath8 @xmath9    the physical interpretation of this is that if the rate of exchange of matter between the convective zone and the burning zone is @xmath10 , in fraction of mass of the cz per gyr , the depletion factor of after a time @xmath11 will be :    @xmath12    as the matter returning from the burning zone has a zero - content in . in decimal exponent the depletion becomes @xmath13 or , for an age of 13 gyr : @xmath14 . for a depletion of 0.5 dex this gives @xmath15 , or a circulation rate a little below one tenth of the mass of the cz per gyr .",
    "because the circulation rate as a function of depth is independent of the element considered , formulae ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) are applicable as well to , at the only condition that @xmath4 refers to the depth corresponding to the top of the burning zone of and not to the top of the burning zone of .",
    "this is how we have computed the predicted values for , actually derived from the observed depletions of for the same distance between the bottom of the cz and the top of the corresponding burning zone .",
    "the depletions of and obtained are plotted in fig .",
    "3 , as open circles . up to a depletion of 1.0 for the depletion of remains below 0.1 dex .",
    "the main cause of this is the strong depletion of in the pms phase .      the first model of mixing",
    "was proposed by e. schatzman @xcite , and is generally described as mixing by `` turbulence '' , or `` diffusion '' .",
    "we shall adopt here such a model , phenomenogically described by random - motions characterized locally by the value of a diffusion coefficient , function of depth . if the source of the stirring is convection , one expects the diffusion coefficient to decrease stronly with depth below the bottom of the cz ( see montalban & schatzman @xcite ) .",
    "actually we can adjust the value at some arbitrary depth and the scale - height of an assumed exponential decline of the diffusion coefficient in such a way that the abundance of follows the behaviour seen in fig .",
    "1 . in fig .",
    "3 the squares show the relationship between the two depletions for this model .",
    "the conclusions are the same as for the first model .",
    "an extremely conservative bound for the depletion of at a given depletion of is given by a model for which the diffusion coefficient is constant with depth ( triangles in fig .",
    "3 ) . even in that case",
    "the depletion of is les than 0.1 up to depletions of of about 0.4 .",
    "for this last model the constraint of reproducing the slope of the depletion curve of fig .",
    "1 is not fullfilled .",
    "models of destruction by burning , reproducing the slope of the depletion curve of , in unevolved metal - poor stars cooler than 5800 k , show a fairly robust ratio of the depletions of and in the range of interest .",
    "the depletion of remains below 0.1 dex , as soon as the depletion of is below the range 0.51.0 .",
    "this result is valid both for a random motion type of mixing or for a stationary circulation type of mixing .",
    "a large fraction of burning occurs during the pre - main sequence .",
    "the burning of leads to an important depletion as soon as one of these two conditions is met : either a mass below 0.80 m@xmath16 , or [ fe / h ] @xmath17 .",
    "this helps to understand why has been found so far only in to or subgiants more metal - poor than -1.5 .",
    "although there are some indications that other effects , as gravitational settling , and temperature inhomogeneities in convective elements are not very important for , a global and consistent treatment including microscopic diffusion , mixing , mass loss and temperature inhomogeneities is a must for the coming years ."
