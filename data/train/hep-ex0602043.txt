    ", the radiated electric field will add coherently and thus be proportional to the shower energy .",
    "a radio signal emitted by a particle shower in a dielectric material such as ice or salt is coherent up to a few ghz , is linearly polarized , and lasts less than a nanosecond .",

    "the semi - rigid haverhill cable was unavailable for time - domain transfer function calibration , so only the attenuation was measured as a function of frequency with a network analyzer .",
    "its phase response was ignored , but due to the relatively short length of that cable this omission will have a very small effect on the final result .      in order to calculate the lpda effective height from calibration measurements , it is conceptually easiest to take a fourier transform of eq .",

    "special care should be taken when taking a complex square root in order to properly account for phase wrapping .    while straightforward , this frequency - domain based approach will give poor time - domain results if the frequency bandwidth of a measured signal is substantially narrower than the nyquist limit of the sampling oscilloscope .",
    "the time - domain result of a complex division operation in the frequency - domain will be dominated by frequency components where the signal is absent , _ i.e. _ , where a division of two small noise values can produce an arbitrarily large artificial result .",
    "digital signal processing tools can be applied to filter out such artificial `` out - of - band '' noise , but they will in all cases produce an unacceptable level of signal distortion . in order to circumvent this issue , a time - domain deconvolution algorithm with noise reduction can be applied in place of every complex division operation . in this work ,",
