    "star formation rates derived from high redshift uv surveys and low redshift spectral analysis indicate that the global star formation rate has declined since @xmath12 by an uncertain factor of between 4.0 and 40.0 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "this evolution is apparently associated with downsizing @xcite , such that the characteristic mass of star forming galaxies decreases with time .",
    "the precise cause of this decline , however , is unknown",
    ". it may be driven by internal ( local ) processes , leading to the exhaustion of the gas reservoir , or by interactions with the local environment .",
    "this is often referred to as the nature versus nurture dichotomy of galaxy evolution .",
    "the properties of a galaxy population are known to be strongly correlated with their local environment ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) : galaxies in dense environments typically have bulge  dominated morphologies , low star formation rates and hi gas content , and red colours .",
    "large surveys such as the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) have shown that both the galaxy colour distribution ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and star formation rate distribution @xcite depend on local galaxy density over a wide dynamic range .",
    "similar trends have also been determined at redshifts up to @xmath13 @xcite .",
    "recently , @xcite and @xcite have shown that , while the fraction of red galaxies in the nearby universe increases with local density , the colour distribution and median ew [ ] of the blue , star - forming galaxies is nearly independent of environment .",
    "a similar trend was observed in the  equivalent width ( ew [ ] ) distribution @xcite .",
    "a possible interpretation of these trends is that dense environments transform galaxies from blue to red on a relatively short timescale , @xmath14 gyr .    in a @xmath15cdm universe ,",
    "the growth of large scale structure is a consequence of the hierarchical clustering process .",
    "it is therefore possible that this clustering process itself could drive the evolution of global star formation , as more galaxies are drawn into dense environments where their star formation rates are somehow suppressed .",
    "the fraction of galaxies located in galaxy clusters is only @xmath16% even at the present epoch and , thus , such environments alone can not have a large influence on the global star formation rate .",
    "however , perhaps over @xmath17 of galaxies are today found in groups of various sizes @xcite and thus these environments may play a more significant role .",
    "although some proposed mechanisms for transforming galaxies in dense environments , such as ram pressure stripping @xcite are unlikely to be effective in small groups , many other effects , such as strangulation @xcite , tidal interactions @xcite , or galaxy mergers and interactions ( e.g * ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) may be more widespread .",
    "in particular , galaxy interactions are likely to be most common in groups , where the velocity dispersion of the groups is not much larger than that of the constituent galaxies @xcite .",
    "studies of nearby groups ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) show that their galaxy populations vary from cluster - like ( mostly early types ) to field - like ( mostly late - types ) , suggesting that a nurturing process of galaxy evolution may well be taking place ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    ". however , galaxy groups are inevitably much more difficult to detect than clusters , with a relative paucity of members and significantly lower density hot plasma .",
    "therefore , in most cases the group selection criteria is either not well understood , or biased in some way .",
    "in particular , one successful method has been to search for the most overdense , compact groups @xcite ; however , such systems may be atypical of the average group environment .",
    "today new opportunities are afforded by large , complete catalogues of nearby groups compiled from redshift surveys such as sdss and the 2df galaxy redshift survey ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "one way to directly observe the influence of galaxy groups is to trace their redshift evolution . in rich clusters , a strong evolution in the fraction of blue galaxies , @xmath18 , was detected by @xcite and later by others ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , although even this result is still a matter of some debate ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in @xcite , a sample of groups",
    "were photometrically selected in the vicinity of bright radio galaxies at low ( @xmath19 ) and intermediate ( @xmath20 ) redshift .",
    "they tentatively confirm an analogous evolution in the fraction of @xmath18 in larger groups .",
    "however , the statistical limitations of photometric data are significant , particularly through field contamination .",
    "in addition , the radio selection might bias the choice of groups .",
    "it is therefore important to repeat this study using a redshift - space selected sample of spectroscopically confirmed groups .",
    "higher redshift catalogues of groups now exist @xcite from which galaxy properties have been analysed .",
    "for example , @xcite studied the properties of group galaxies in the cnoc2 group sample at intermediate redshift . amongst other things",
    ", they discovered a trend in the mean galaxy colors , which on average become redder than the field toward the group centers . in (",
    "* hereafter paper  i ) , we present our deeper and more complete spectroscopy in the region of the intermediate redshift cnoc2 groups @xcite .",
    "our data show that the properties of galaxies in intermediate redshift groups are significantly different from those of coeval field galaxies , in that group galaxies are significantly less likely to have ongoing star formation than their field counterparts , and groups also contain a significant excess of bright galaxies ( @xmath21 ) .",
    "these results are discussed in detail in that paper .    in this paper , we contrast the properties of our intermediate redshift group sample ( * ? ? ?",
    "* paperi ) with a large sample of galaxy groups at low redshift , selected from the 2df galaxy redshift survey ( 2dfgrs , * ? ? ?",
    "this allows us to examine the evolution of galaxies in the group environment with purely spectroscopic data and over a significant range of redshift . in section  [ sec - data ]",
    "we introduce our galaxy and group samples at intermediate redshift ( cnoc2 - see also paperi ) and locally ( 2dfgrs ) .",
    "we then go on to ensure a fair comparison between these two populations and the surrounding field by examining the luminosity functions and ew[oii ] distributions . in section  [ sec - results",
    "] , we present our results , in which we assess the environmental and evolutionary dependencies of ew[oii ] as well as the dependence on other parameters such as galaxy luminosity . we then discuss the scientific implications in section  [ sec - discussion ] , and present simple models for the star formation history of these galaxy populations to constrain theories of galaxy evolution .",
    "section  [ sec - conclusions ] presents our final conclusions .    throughout this paper",
    "we assume a @xmath15cdm cosmology of @xmath22 , @xmath23 and @xmath24 .",
    "a complete description of the data and reduction methods can be found in paper  i. in summary , the intermediate redshift group sample is selected from the cnoc2 redshift survey in the range @xmath25 @xcite .",
    "we obtained deeper , more complete multi - object - spectroscopy in the regions of 26 of these groups ( in 20 fields ) at @xmath26 using ldss2 on the 6.5 m baade telescope at las companas observatory in chile .",
    "the fields were chosen to maximize the number of groups in the @xcite sample along the line of sight , within this redshift range .",
    "redshifts were measured for @xmath27 of galaxies targetted with @xmath28 ( with @xmath29 success rate in the faintest bin @xmath30@xmath31 ) and galaxies have been reassigned to groups with a new determination of the group velocity dispersion .",
    "the galaxies have each been weighted by a factor @xmath32 to account for radial and magnitude - dependent selection functions ( see paper  i ) .    the cnoc2 field galaxy sample is defined to include all galaxies within @xmath33 of a targetted group centre , lying within the redshift range @xmath0 but excluding those galaxies assigned to the targetted group to avoid biasing the field towards the group environment .",
    "the final magnitude  limited field sample is therefore representative of the universe in the @xmath0 redshift range .",
    "the cnoc2 group sample contains 240 galaxies within @xmath34mpc of the group centre and the field sample contains 334 galaxies .",
    "the local redshift galaxy sample comes from the large 2dfgrs with over 220 000 galaxy spectra selected in the -band .",
    "the galaxy sample is effectively volume limited ( with low incompleteness the sample is representative of the whole population ) in the redshift range @xmath35 for galaxies with @xmath36 .",
    "although there were problems with the atmospheric dispersion corrector prior to august 1999 which affect the instrument throughput @xcite , we find our results are unchanged if we exclude data obtained in this period .",
    "the 2dfgrs percolation - inferred galaxy group catalogue ( 2pigg * ? ? ?",
    "* ) is also based on a friends - of - friends percolation algorithm .",
    "an axial ratio ( defined as the line - of - sight  length relative to the projected  spatial  length ) of @xmath37 is used to link 2dfgrs galaxies together , forming a large catalogue of local groups .",
    "velocity dispersions of the 2pigg ( and cnoc2 ) groups are calculated with the gapper algorithm .",
    "full details of the 2pigg group - finding algorithm and description of the catalogue can be found in @xcite .",
    "we only investigate groups with number of known members @xmath38 because the contamination of that group catalogue with unphysical systems becomes large in smaller groups .",
    "we note that the cnoc2 group detection algorithm @xcite requires more bright members in close proximity to each other , and therefore likely suffers from less contamination . even with the @xmath38 requirement for 2dfgrs groups , we find that the range of group velocity dispersion matches that seen in the cnoc2 group sample . from now on we will refer to the 2dfgrs sample simply as the _ 2df sample_.    the 2df field is defined as all galaxies in the 2df galaxy catalogue and represents the global galaxy population in the @xmath39 redshift range , within magnitude limits .",
    "since these groups were untargetted , this definition is compatible with our cnoc2 field definition .",
    "the 2df group sample contains 5490 galaxies within @xmath34mpc of the group centre and the field sample contains 50981 galaxies .",
    "galaxies in both catalogues are k - corrected to give rest - frame absolute magnitudes in the -band .",
    "the 2df k - corrections are taken from @xcite , and are generally small .",
    "for the cnoc2 survey , k - corrections have been calculated using no - evolution models ; we will explore the sensitivity of our results to the assumed model of galaxy evolution in the discussion ( section  [ sec - discussion ] ) .",
    "we note that k+e corrections are also available for galaxies in the original cnoc2 sample @xcite . for each galaxy , we first choose a mixture of observed local seds @xcite for which the model b - i colour matches the observed colour at the given redshift .",
    "then the rest - frame absolute  magnitude can be determined from the models , given the observed  magnitude , sed mixture and redshift .",
    "the transformation from observed -band magnitude to rest - frame  is chosen because it is closely matched at cnoc2 redshifts and because it directly transforms the cnoc2 spectroscopic selection band to the 2df selection band .",
    "luminosities are then corrected for galactic extinction on a patch - to - patch basis , computed by extrapolating from b and v band extinction values obtained from ned ( * ? ? ?",
    "* variation within each patch is negligible ) .",
    "we make no correction for internal extinction , also to allow direct comparison with local galaxies in 2df .",
    "figure  [ fig : lumfns ] shows the superimposed luminosity functions of the 2df and cnoc2 group and field samples .",
    "the volume ",
    "limited 2df sample is @xmath40 complete for @xmath41 and so we apply no completeness correction .",
    "the schechter function computed for the 2df survey @xcite is shown for comparison .",
    "the cnoc2 galaxies are weighted by @xmath32 to correct for the selection function .",
    "for comparison between 2df and cnoc2 group and field samples , the data are normalised so that there is the same number of weighted galaxies brighter than @xmath42 . at these magnitudes ,",
    "neither sample suffers any incompleteness due to falling below the apparent magnitude limit in the redshift range considered .",
    "we note that the enhanced bright to faint galaxy ratio seen in cnoc2 groups relative to the field ( paper  i ) is also seen in the local 2df groups .",
    "also shown in figure  [ fig : lumfns ] are some critical values of luminosity .",
    "the value of @xmath43 in @xcite , appropriate to our cosmological model , is @xmath44 , and the 2df data are complete down to @xmath45 , or equivalently @xmath46 .",
    "our cnoc2 data span a wide range in redshift and thus the luminosity limit corresponding to our apparent magnitude limit of = 22 is redshift dependent . at the upper limit of our redshift range , @xmath47 ,",
    "a @xmath48 galaxy with a mean k - correction will transform to a rest - frame luminosity @xmath49 and at the lower redshift limit of @xmath50 , the same galaxy would transform to @xmath51 . in the case of the reddest galaxies with larger k - corrections , these limits would lie at @xmath52 ( @xmath47 ) and @xmath53 ( @xmath50 ) , so we are incomplete below these magnitudes .",
    "most galaxies in our cnoc2 and 2df catalogues lie below the brightest cnoc2 luminosity limit of @xmath52 .",
    "to enable us to compare the 2df and cnoc2 galaxy samples independently of differences in the luminosity function ( which may be partly intrinsic but is mostly due to selection effects ) , we choose to apply an additional luminosity weighting to the cnoc2 galaxies .",
    "this weighting is calculated within each bin in luminosity using the formula : @xmath54 which corresponds to the difference between the field luminosity functions .",
    "it is applied in the range @xmath55@xmath56 , where the cnoc2 data become incomplete at the high redshift end .",
    "the choice of a faint final luminosity limit of @xmath57 ( @xmath5 ) makes maximal use of the data and allows the properties of faint galaxies to be compared with those of brighter galaxies .",
    "we emphasize that whilst we are incomplete at @xmath58 at @xmath47 in cnoc2 and @xmath59 in 2dfgrs , this has no impact on any analysis of galaxy properties as a function of luminosity or on comparisons between the group and field galaxy populations . also , when studying galaxy properties as a function of luminosity , the analysis is independent of the cnoc2 galaxy weighting , including little effect from weighting by the selection function .",
    "the   emission line disappears entirely from the ldss2 spectrograph window at @xmath60 , limited by the instrument sensitivity of the current optics and detector .",
    "therefore , we use the [ oii]@xmath1 emission line equivalent width ( ew[oii ] ) to study the relative levels of star formation in our galaxy samples . in paper",
    "i we outlined the reasons why ew[oii ] is sufficient to reveal trends of star formation with galaxy environment .",
    "in contrast to using the line flux , the effect of normalising by the continuum when computing the equivalent width reduces uncertainties related to absorption by dust and aperture bias , which are relevant when comparing galaxy properties at different redshifts . in particular , we show in section  [ sec - apbias ] that our analysis is insensitive to aperture bias in ew[oii ] .",
    "details of the cnoc2 equivalent width measurement process are given in paper  i. in 2dfgrs , the equivalent widths of [ oii ] are measured in a similar way to  using a completely automated fitting procedure , ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* for details )",
    ". in the fitting of the [ oii ] emission line , many 2df measurements are classified as _ no line present_. in our analysis , these are set to 0  and then all 2df measurements are smoothed with a gaussian kernel of width 2  to match the mean error on cnoc2 ew[oii ] measurements ( much greater than the 2df line measurement error of @xmath61 ) .",
    "we note that the fraction of galaxies with ew[oii]@xmath625  is unchanged by this smoothing to within @xmath63 .",
    "figure  [ fig : oiidistribs ] shows the distribution of ew[oii ] in our 2df and cnoc2 group and field galaxy catalogues .",
    "we limit the group data to within @xmath64mpc ( projected ) of the group centre in all cases .",
    "the cnoc2 galaxies are weighted by a combined completeness and luminosity weighting to match the 2df luminosity function , @xmath65 .",
    "the cnoc2 galaxies are limited to @xmath28 and all galaxies are limited to @xmath66 .",
    "finally , the distribution of 2df ew[oii ] is normalised to provide an equal number of galaxies to that found in cnoc2 , for presentation only .",
    "this is done independently for the group and field populations .",
    "we are motivated by the findings of @xcite and @xcite who show that galaxy populations have a bimodal distribution in colour and ew [ ] .",
    "@xcite show that the fraction of red , passive galaxies is strongly dependent upon local galaxy density .",
    "the division between passive and star forming galaxies in the ew [ ] distribution occurs at @xmath67  @xcite .",
    "we do not expect to see such a clear bimodality in ew[oii ] since ew [ ] @xmath68  typically corresponds to ew[oii ] @xmath69 , below the measurement error in ew[oii ] for cnoc2 .",
    "greater intrinsic scatter in the sfr-[oii ] relation than in the sfr-  relation also works to mask the division between the two populations .",
    "thus , although we can not cleanly separate the two populations , we impose an arbitrary division at 5in the cnoc2 and smoothed 2df data .",
    "we expect the population with ew[oii]@xmath705  to be dominated by the passive population distribution from the full cnoc2 survey is consistent with a gaussian function , supporting the hypothesis that this peak is dominated by galaxies with no [ oii ] emission and normally distributed errors @xcite . ] and the population with ew[oii]@xmath25  to be dominated by the star - forming population , and this division is sufficient to reveal trends in the data ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    to assess the relative normalisation of the two populations , we define * @xmath71 * as the fraction of passive galaxies",
    ". the level of [ oii ] emission in the star forming galaxies is characterised by * @xmath72 * , which represents the median ew[oii ] restricted to star  forming galaxies .",
    "we note that it will also be interesting to derive the fraction of blue galaxies using cnoc2 colours , for a more direct comparison with classical studies of the butcher - oemler effect .",
    "however , this analysis is not straightforward , because of the complex dependence of cnoc2 colour apertures on galaxy size , galaxy type and redshift ; the meagerness of the group red sequence and the difficulties in making a direct comparison with 2dfgrs .",
    "many of these problems can be overcome by computing the fraction of galaxies in each peak of a bimodal colour distribution .",
    "this analysis will be presented in a future paper , currently in preparation .",
    "systematic effects on the measurements of ew[oii ] can be induced by the relative aperture sizes used in the 2dfgrs and cnoc2 spectroscopy . in particular",
    ", the 2df fibres generally sample light from a smaller physical radius than the cnoc2 slits , and this might lead to an overestimate of @xmath71 by excluding the star forming regions in face - on disk galaxies . in appendix  [ sec - apeffects ] , we use sdss resolved photometry to estimate the effects of aperture bias across our magnitude range . we find that the fraction of galaxies found in the red peak of the bimodal colour distribution is no greater when considering colours measured inside @xmath73 sdss fibres , rather than the total colour .",
    "this is because both red and blue galaxies have similar colour gradients , likely due to metallicity rather than star formation .",
    "thus we conclude that the effects of aperture bias do not strongly affect our measurements of @xmath71 .",
    "a comparison of the 2df and cnoc2 ew[oii ] distributions in figure  [ fig : oiidistribs ] shows that the fraction of galaxies in the 0  peak depends on both epoch and environment .",
    "in particular , the 0  peak in the 2df data is much more prominent than in the cnoc2 survey , for both field and groups . at both epochs , however , the group galaxy population is more biased towards the 0  peak than the corresponding field population .",
    "we now explore these trends in more detail .      in figure  [",
    "fig : fracsflum ] , the fraction of passive galaxies , @xmath71 is plotted against rest - frame luminosity .",
    "statistical errors are estimated using a jackknife resampling method @xcite .",
    "we can see that :    * in all samples , @xmath71 is a strong function of luminosity with fainter galaxies far more likely to be star forming than brighter galaxies at equivalent redshifts .",
    "this is consistent with many previous results , e.g. @xcite .",
    "* @xmath71 is significantly greater in the galaxy groups than in the field at both low and intermediate redshift and also right across the luminosity range investigated .",
    "* @xmath71 is strongly redshift dependent , both in the field and in galaxy groups . at brighter magnitudes than @xmath74 ( @xmath5 in 2df ) , @xmath71 in groups evolves from @xmath75 at @xmath0 in cnoc2 to @xmath76 at @xmath77 in 2df . in our field samples ( defined to represent the global population )",
    ", @xmath71 evolves from @xmath78% to @xmath79% over the same redshift interval .",
    "the observed field evolution is consistent with the equivalent strong evolution in the fraction of passive galaxies in the canada - france redshift survey @xcite and the global decline in star formation rate since @xmath80 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "we refer to whitaker et al . , 2004 , in preparation , for a more detailed and thorough discussion of the evolution of star formation rate in the global cnoc2 population .",
    "this provides a clear analogy at lower densities to the observed evolution of the blue galaxy fraction in clusters @xcite and to similar evolution in rich groups , estimated by @xcite using photometric data .",
    "figure  [ fig : cumoiisfdistribs ] shows the cumulative distribution of ew[oii ] , for star forming galaxies only , in the 2df and cnoc2 group and field samples .",
    "interestingly , the shape of the distribution at a particular epoch ( i.e. 2df or cnoc2 ) is approximately independent of environment , consistent with earlier analysis of the ew [ ] distribution @xcite . in the cnoc2 sample",
    ", the distribution shows a small enhancement in highly star forming galaxies ( ew[oii ] @xmath81 30 ) relative to the 2df galaxies in both groups and the field .",
    "the mean values of ew[oii ] for each sample are indicated by the arrows in figure  [ fig : cumoiisfdistribs ] .",
    "these values of 26.4  ( groups ) and 31.3  ( field ) in cnoc2 are within @xmath82 per cent of the mean values in the 2df ( 20.9  in groups and 25.8  in the field ) in 2df .",
    "this difference is much smaller than the evolution in @xmath71 , which is almost a factor of two .",
    "therefore , the evolution of the total star formation rate is driven more by the evolution of @xmath71 than by evolution of the mean properties of star forming galaxies .    in figure",
    "[ fig : wtmediansflum ] we show the median ew[oii ] among star  forming galaxies , @xmath72 , as a function of luminosity in the cnoc2 and 2df group and field samples .",
    "errors are again computed using a jackknife resampling method .",
    "the median ew[oii ] is significantly larger for fainter galaxies than for bright galaxies .",
    "furthermore , the evolution in the ew[oii ] distribution is largely manifested as an increase in @xmath72 in galaxies with @xmath83 .      in figure",
    "[ fig : fracsfrad ] we plot @xmath71 as a function of the projected physical distance , dr , from the group centre .",
    "it is clear that even in the better sampled 2df groups , the total fraction of passive galaxies , @xmath71 merely declines from @xmath84 in the innermost @xmath85  mpc bin to @xmath86 in the @xmath87  mpc@xmath88  mpc bin .",
    "this is a weak , but statistically significant trend .",
    "the value of @xmath71 for the total 2df field population is @xmath89 , much lower than in the groups .",

    "we only see a trend with dr in the inner regions of the cnoc2 group population , as shown in paper  i. however , a trend as weak as that seen in 2df group galaxies would be masked by the statistical errors .",
    "we have also investigated how the star formation properties of galaxy groups in cnoc2 groups is computed with each galaxy weighted by its combined completeness and luminosity weighting @xmath92 ( strictly only applicable when the full stacked group is considered ) we find that @xmath71 is insensitive to this weighting and very close to the value obtained with no weighting applied . ] depend upon the group velocity dispersion , @xmath93 . in paper",
    "i we found that there is little dependence of @xmath71 on @xmath93 when computed over a wide range of galaxy luminosity .",
    "figure  [ fig : fracsfveldisp ] shows @xmath71 in cnoc2 and 2df groups as a function of @xmath93 .",
    "there are no clear trends visible in figure  [ fig : fracsfveldisp ] other than the evolution from lower @xmath71 in cnoc2 groups to that seen in 2df groups .",
    "it is also noticeable that there are very few 2df groups with high velocity dispersion ( @xmath94 km  s@xmath10 ) and low @xmath71 ( @xmath95 ) , which is a common regime for cnoc2 groups .",
    "we note that the enhancement of @xmath71 in cnoc2 groups over the cnoc2 field holds when we exclude the 2 groups with velocity dispersion @xmath96 km  s@xmath10 ( for more details see paper  i ) .",
    "the only cnoc2 group with @xmath97 ( group 138 ) is characterized by a high number of confirmed members ( 35 compared to 19 in the group with the next highest @xmath93 ) and might better be considered a poor cluster ( see e.g. * ? ? ? * for the behaviour of @xmath71 in clusters ) .",
    "we have detected a strong evolution in the fraction of passive galaxies , @xmath71 ( defined as the fraction of galaxies with ew[oii]@xmath70 5 ) , in both groups and the field since the universe was @xmath98 its current age .",
    "thus , the butcher  oemler effect ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) is not strictly a cluster phenomenon , but is seen both in the general field and in small groups , as previously found by @xcite .",
    "these results represent clear evidence that a significant proportion of galaxies in both environments have ceased forming stars since @xmath99 .",
    "a simple argument , neglecting density and luminosity evolution , sees 50% of star forming group galaxies and 35% of star forming field galaxies at @xmath100 ( cnoc2 ) becoming passive galaxies by @xmath101 ( 2df ) .",
    "this evolution is modelled in more detail in section  [ sec - models ] .",
    "in contrast , while we find significant redshift evolution in the shape of the ew[oii ] distribution for star - forming galaxies , there is little or no dependence on environment .",
    "this suggests that this evolution results from very local ( i.e. internal to the galaxy ) processes that drive an evolution in sfr or metallicity , rather than external , environmental influences .",
    "we caution however that amongst star - forming galaxies , it is not possible with current data to rule out an aperture bias in the measurement of ew[oii ] , which might lead to underestimation of ew[oii ] in 2dfgrs star forming galaxies .    in the following sections , we make a first attempt to quantitatively decouple the environmental dependence of galaxy evolution from the global sfr evolution . to fully understand this",
    ", we require a homogeneous sample over a large range of environments .",
    "we are currently working on providing a fair comparison study in cluster cores @xcite using spectroscopic data over an equivalent redshift range . understanding",
    "the importance of galaxy evolution in groups with respect to cluster cores will help to isolate the environments in which galaxy evolution is most active .",
    "complementary studies of the evolution in isolated galaxies would be of especially great benefit to understand the role of environment in driving galaxy evolution , and in particular , the evolution of @xmath71 .      in this section ,",
    "we show how the strong evolution in @xmath71 seen in our results can be interpreted in the context of galaxy evolution models . by combining the @xcite models of luminosity evolution with a range of star formation histories , we attempt to recreate a realistic evolution scenario which can reproduce the observed evolution .",
    "we assume that cnoc2 galaxies represent a population equivalent to the progenitors of the 2df population ; therefore , using the stellar population models of @xcite it is possible to create mock-2df populations by evolving the cnoc2 galaxies to the mean redshift of 2df galaxies ( @xmath102 = 0.08 ) in accordance with a chosen set of model parameters .",
    "we present two model methods with different evolutionary scenarios but similar basic methodology .",
    "both models allow us to estimate the evolution of ew[oii ] and within a given set of parameters .",
    "the _ quiescent evolution _",
    "scenario is characterized by the lack of environmental evolution .",
    "there are no sudden events which drastically alter a galaxy s star formation .",
    "bright star - forming galaxies simply decline exponentially in their star formation with a constant e - folding timescale and thus fade in luminosity . in the _ truncation _ scenario ,",
    "we incorporate into our evolution model a probability of each galaxy undergoing a truncation event , in which it suddenly ceases star formation . in this model",
    ", there is also a probability that a high redshift field galaxy can infall onto a galaxy group to become a local group galaxy .",
    "quiescent evolution describes the evolution of galaxies in which every galaxy s star formation declines over its lifetime with a single e - folding timescale .",
    "the modelling procedure for quiescent evolution is described in appendix  [ sec - quiesevol ] , which also describes the effects of allowing each parameter to vary . to investigate the effects of quiescent evolution on @xmath71 ,",
    "we choose a control model and an extreme model . for our control model",
    "we choose a kennicutt imf , a galaxy formation redshift = 10 and solar metallicity .",
    "we also incorporate a two - component dust prescription into the model @xcite .",
    "figure  [ fig : plesensible ] shows @xmath71 as a function of luminosity in the observed cnoc2 and 2df samples , together with the equivalent trend in the evolved cnoc2 population obtained using this model .",
    "the evolution of @xmath71 in the model significantly underestimates the trend seen in the real data .",
    "this is partly because galaxies which become passive also tend to fade into a fainter bin of luminosity , leaving the trend of @xmath103 with luminosity approximately unchanged . for our extreme model",
    ", we deliberately choose parameters which maximize the evolution in @xmath71 , as discussed in appendix  [ sec - quiesevol ] .",
    "we choose a salpeter imf , = 3 , solar metallicity and we ignore the effects of dust .",
    "figure  [ fig : pleextreme ] shows the same 2df and cnoc2 data as in figure  [ fig : plesensible ] but this time overplotted with the evolved cnoc2 population obtained using this extreme model . in this case , galaxies fainter than @xmath104 still show a significant deficit of passive galaxies ( low @xmath71 ) in the evolved cnoc2 galaxies when compared to the data .",
    "this provides strong evidence that transformations are required to reproduce the observed evolution in @xmath71 both in groups and the global ( field ) population .",
    "next we consider a model in which galaxies undergo transformations that cause them to cease forming stars . we have shown in section  [ sec - disquiesevol ] that some form of galaxy transformation appears to be required to reproduce our observed evolution in @xmath71 . here",
    ", we constrain the probability of these transformations required to match the observed evolution in @xmath71 and its dependence upon galaxy luminosity and environment . the modelling procedure is described in appendix  [ sec - truncevol ] . in this scenario , a cnoc2 galaxy either continues with its e - folding decline in star formation , or has its star formation truncated instantaneously with a probability @xmath8 per gyr , at a random point during its evolution to @xmath105 .",
    "the timescale of the transformation is likely to have little effect on the evolution of @xmath71 .",
    "we neglect the possibility that some transformations are accompanied with a strong starburst or involve the merging of galaxies as either of these possibilities can not be constrained by simply considering the evolution in @xmath71 . in a later paper we will consider our data in the context of a more complete galaxy formation model ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "we adopt a realistic set of parameters governing the spectrophotometric evolution , with a kennicutt imf , = 10 , solar metallicity and a basic dust prescription @xcite .",
    "the progenitors of 2df group galaxies are chosen by selecting all cnoc2 group galaxies plus a fraction of the cnoc2 field galaxies such that the combined set is made up of @xmath106% cnoc2 group members and @xmath107% cnoc2 field galaxies . as our field represents the global population , the progenitors of 2df field galaxies",
    "are simply the cnoc2 field galaxies .",
    "following the model prescription , we obtain best fit values for @xmath8 as a function of local luminosity and environment to fit the observed evolution in @xmath71 .",
    "figures  [ fig : ptrunclumnodensevol ] and  [ fig : ptrunclumfulldensevol ] show @xmath8 as a function of luminosity in groups and the field with @xmath108% ( local group members were all group members at @xmath109 ) and @xmath110% ( local group members were @xmath111% group members and @xmath111% field galaxies at @xmath109 ) respectively .",
    "we note that adopting a salpeter imf does not significantly alter these results .",
    "figures  [ fig : ptrunclumnodensevol ] and  [ fig : ptrunclumfulldensevol ] show the following :    1 .   @xmath8 is significantly greater than zero , implying that galaxy transformations are required over our redshift range , both in groups and the field .",
    "this is independent of the assumed evolution of clustering power and agrees with our conclusions in section  [ sec - disquiesevol ] .",
    "2 .   assuming no density evolution since @xmath112 , @xmath113% , ( figure   [ fig : ptrunclumnodensevol ] ) , we see no evidence that @xmath8 is larger in groups than in the field .",
    "this means that there must be some _ global _ mechanism in which star formation can be effectively reduced to zero over a short period of time rather than simply declining in a quiescent manner as assumed in section  [ sec - disquiesevol ] .",
    "however the existence of a more evolved population ( higher @xmath71 ) in groups suggests that the star formation history prior to @xmath112 must depend upon environment in some way .",
    "this could be either a nurturing environmental process at @xmath114 , or an earlier formation time for galaxies in groups ( nature ) .",
    "we emphasize that our model is designed to simply match the observed evolution of @xmath71 .",
    "it can not simultaneously match evolution of the luminosity function , which requires a better understanding of the volume - averaged galaxy density .",
    "we are also constrained by our definition of `` field '' which spans the full range of environment .",
    "if we assume a strong density evolution with only 50% of local group galaxies in groups at @xmath112 , @xmath115% , ( figure  [ fig : ptrunclumfulldensevol ] ) , then a marginally larger @xmath8 is invoked in groups than in the no density evolution ( @xmath116% ) case , although not significantly so . even at faint luminosities the differences between @xmath8 in groups and",
    "the field is still of low significance ( @xmath117 in the @xmath118@xmath66 bin ) .",
    "physically , an enhanced @xmath8 with greater density evolution is consistent with a second transformation process occuring during clustering as a galaxy is infalling into a larger dark matter halo .",
    "a strong density evolution with a @xmath8 which remains constant with redshift could theoretically explain the larger value of @xmath71 in groups than in the field .",
    "however , realisations of dark matter halo merger trees suggest that the actual fraction of 2df group galaxies in groups by @xmath119 was @xmath120% ( @xmath121% ) @xcite .",
    "4 .   there are no clear trends of @xmath8 with galaxy luminosity in groups . in the field",
    "there is a suggestion ( @xmath122 significance ) that @xmath8 decreases in the faintest bin ( @xmath123@xmath66 ) .",
    "we acknowledge that our model is simple , and neglects the mass and luminosity enhancing effects of galaxy - galaxy mergers .",
    "2dfgrs studies of the local luminosity function , and its dependence upon environment and galaxy spectral type , suggest that galaxies with early spectral - types become more important in higher density regimes , particularly at low luminosities @xcite .",
    "@xcite show that a simple model ( similar to ours ) , in which star formation can be suppressed in clusters , can explain most of the differences between the cluster and field luminosity functions .",
    "they claim that mergers are only required to explain the small population of very bright early type cluster galaxies .",
    "the precise importance of galaxy mergers remains to be seen .",
    "there is significant evolution since @xmath80 of the luminosity function of red galaxies in the combo-17 survey , and @xcite conclude that mergers are required to explain at least some of this evolution . in clusters ,",
    "comparisons of the k - band luminosity function over a similar redshift range suggest there is little evolution in the stellar mass of cluster galaxies @xcite .",
    "however , mergers are expected to be more common in groups than in clusters ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "in a future paper , we will investigate the importance of mergers in groups , using existing data on cnoc2 and 2df groups to map the evolution of the group k - band luminosity function .",
    "in a separate paper we will also make comparisons of the data with results from semi - analytic models of galaxy formation .",
    "observational constraints on the bimodality of galaxy properties , and the dependence on galaxy luminosity , environment and redshift will place strong limitations on the physical processes regulating star formation in these models .",
    "in this paper , we have examined the evolution of galaxies and the effects of the group environment in kinematically selected groups from the cnoc2 ( * ? ? ? * supplemented with new and deeper magellan spectroscopy ) and 2dfgrs @xcite surveys .",
    "the data span the redshift range @xmath124 and luminosities down to @xmath66 ( locally @xmath5 ) .",
    "motivated by the apparently fundamental differences between the blue , star - forming and the red , passive populations of galaxies @xcite we have arbitrarily divided our galaxies into _ passive _ ( ew[oii]@xmath125 ) and _ star - forming _ ( ew[oii]@xmath126 ) populations .",
    "we have then shown that the fraction of passive galaxies @xmath71 is a strong function of :    * * redshift * : @xmath71 declines strongly with redshift , both in groups and the field and over the full luminosity range to at least @xmath112 .",
    "this is equivalent to a butcher - oemler trend in the emission line properties of group galaxies and in the global population .",
    "* * environment * : @xmath71 is significantly higher in groups than the field across the full luminosity range , both locally and at @xmath127 . * * luminosity * : @xmath71 increases steeply with luminosity across our range ( @xmath128 ) in groups and the field up to at least @xmath112 .    using the stellar population models of @xcite",
    ", we have shown that the rate of evolution in @xmath71 since @xmath112 can not be explained in a quiescent evolution scenario , i.e. by modelling galaxies with a simple e - folding decline in their sfr . even choosing model parameters geared to maximize this evolution",
    "can not reproduce the observed difference between 2df and cnoc2 galaxies in @xmath71 , especially fainter than @xmath129 .",
    "this conclusion holds both in groups and the field .",
    "we are therefore driven to assuming that transforming events take place , in which star formation is abruptly truncated , and have constrained the probability of truncation per gyr ( @xmath8 ) in groups and the field across the luminosity range @xmath130  @xmath66 .",
    "although we have not constrained the timescale of these events ( simply assuming them to be instantaneous ) , we show that their existence is strongly required by the data ( @xmath131 ) .",
    "surprisingly , we find no strong evidence that @xmath8 in the group environment exceeds that in the field .",
    "the environmental dependence of @xmath71 requires that star formation history prior to @xmath112 must depend upon environment in some way .",
    "one possibility is that as clustering of galaxies progresses an additional suppression mechanism acts upon star forming galaxies as they fall into groups ( nurture ) .",
    "however , it is also possible to imagine a nature scenario in which more strongly clustered galaxies form first and all galaxies undergo transforming events , independently of their environment . a better understanding of the environmental influence on galaxy properties will be made possible by comparisons with semi - analytic models , galaxies in other environments ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) and higher redshift galaxy systems .",
