    "thanks to the ubiquity of powerful , general - purpose computers , large - scale numerical calculations have become an important part of every field of science and engineering , enabling quantitative predictions , analysis , and design of ever more complex systems .",
    "there are a wide variety of different approaches to such calculations , and there is no single `` best '' method for all circumstances  not only are some methods better suited to particular situations than to others , but there are also often severe trade - offs between generality / simplicity and theoretical efficiency . even in relatively mature areas like",
    "computational classical electromagnetism ( em ) , a variety of techniques spanning a broad range of sophistication and generality remain in widespread use ( and new variations are continually developed )  @xcite .",
    "semi - analytical approaches also remain important , especially perturbative techniques to decompose problems containing widely differing length scales ( the most challenging situation for brute - force numerics ) .",
    "nevertheless , many commonalities and guiding principles can be identified that seem to apply to a range of numerical techniques .",
    "until a few years ago , casimir forces and other em fluctuation - induced interactions occupied an unusual position in this tableau .",
    "realistic , general numerical methods to solve for casimir forces were simply unavailable ; solutions were limited to special high - symmetry geometries ( and often to special materials like perfect metals ) that are amenable to analytical and semi - analytical approaches .",
    "this is not to say that there were not , _ in principle _ , decades - old theoretical frameworks capable of describing fluctuations for arbitrary geometries and materials , but practical techniques for _ evaluating _ these theoretical descriptions on a computer have only been demonstrated in the last few years  @xcite . in almost all cases ,",
    "these approaches turn out to be closely related to computational methods from _ classical _ em , which is fortunate because it means that casimir computations can exploit decades of progress in computational classical em once the relationship between the problems becomes clear .",
    "the long delay in developing numerical methods for casimir interactions , from the time the phenomenon was first proposed in 1948  @xcite , can be explained by three factors .",
    "first , accurate measurements of casimir forces were first reported only in 1997  @xcite and experimental interest in complex casimir geometries and materials has only recently experienced dramatic growth due to the progress in fabricating nanoscale mechanical devices .",
    "second , even the simplest numerical prediction of a single force requires the equivalent of a large number of classical em simulations , a barrier to casual numerical experimentation .",
    "third , there have historically been many equivalent theoretical formulations of casimir forces , but some formulations are much more amenable to computational solution than others , and these formulations are often couched in a language that is opaque to researchers from classical computational em .",
    "this purpose of this review is to survey the available and proposed numerical techniques for evaluating casimir forces , energies , torques , and related interactions , emphasizing their relationships to standard classical - em methods .",
    "our goal is not to identify a `` best '' method , but rather to illuminate the strengths and weaknesses of each approach , highlighting the conclusions that can be gleaned from the classical experience .",
    "we will review an intellectual framework in which to evaluate different numerical techniques , comparing them along several axes for which quasi - independent choices of approach can be made .",
    "we will also emphasize a few key departures of casimir problems from ordinary classical em , such as the necessity of imaginary- or complex - frequency solutions of maxwell s equations and the need for wide - bandwidth analyses , that impact the adaptation of off - the - shelf computational methods .",
    "numerical methods from distinct groups or research papers often differ in several ways simultaneously , complicating the task of directly comparing or even describing them . in order to organize one s understanding of numerical approaches , it is useful to break them down along three axes of comparison , representing ( roughly ) independent choices in the design of a method :    * what * problem * does the method solveeven within a single area such as classical em , there are several conceptually different _ questions _ that one can ask and several _ ways of asking _ them that lead to different categories of methods . *",
    "what * basis * is used to express the unknownshow the _ infinite _ number of unknowns in the exact partial differential equation ( pde ) or integral equation are reduced to a _",
    "finite _ number of unknowns for solution on a computer .",
    "* what * solution technique * is used to determine these unknownseven with the same equations and the same unknowns , there are vast differences among the types of direct , sparse , and iterative methods that can be used to attack the problem , and the efficient application of a particular solution technique to a particular problem is sometimes a research task unto itself .    in this section ,",
    "we briefly summarize the available problems , basis choices , and solution techniques for casimir problems . in subsequent sections ,",
    "we then discuss in more detail the specific approaches that have currently been demonstrated or proposed .      in classical em",
    ", there are several types of problems that are typically posed  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* appendix d ) , such as computing source - free time - harmonic eigensolutions @xmath0 and eigenfrequencies @xmath1 , computing time - harmonic fields resulting from a time - harmonic current source @xmath2 , or computing the time - dependent fields created by an arbitrary time - dependent source @xmath3 starting at @xmath4 . although these are all closely mathematically related , and in some sense the solution of one problem can give solutions to the other problems , they lead to very different types of numerical simulations .    in a similar way ,",
    "despite the fact that different formulations of casimir - interaction problems are ultimately mathematically equivalent ( although the equivalencies are often far from obvious)and are usually answering the same conceptual question , such as what is the force or interaction energy for some geometry  each one leads most naturally to distinct classes of computational methods . here , we exclude formulations such as proximity - force ( `` parallel - plate '' ) approximations  @xcite , pairwise summation of casimir  polder forces ( valid in the dilute - gas limit )  @xcite , and ray optics  @xcite , that are useful in special cases but represent uncontrolled approximations if they are applied to arbitrary geometries .",
    "although at some point the distinctions are blurred by the mathematical equivalencies , we can crudely categorize the approaches as :    * computing the eigenfrequencies @xmath5 and summing the zero - point energy @xmath6  @xcite .",
    "see sec .",
    "[ sec : eigenmode - summation ] . * integrating the mean energy density or force density ( stress tensor ) , by evaluating field correlation functions @xmath7 and @xmath8 in terms of the classical em green s functions at @xmath1 via the fluctuation ",

    "see sec .",
    "[ sec : path - integrals ] .    in each case , the result must be summed / integrated over all frequencies @xmath1 to obtain the physical result ( corresponding to thermodynamic / quantum fluctuations at all frequencies ) .",
    "the relationship of the problem to _ causal _ green s functions ( fields appear _ after _ currents ) means that the integrand is analytic for @xmath9  @xcite . as a consequence , there is a choice of _ contours _ of @xmath1 integration in the upper - half complex plane , which is surprisingly important  it turns out that the integrands are wildly oscillatory on the real-@xmath1 axis and require accurate integration over a huge bandwidth , whereas the integrands are much better - behaved along the imaginary-@xmath1 axis ( `` wick - rotated '' or `` matsubara '' frequencies ) .",
    "this means that casimir calculations almost always involve classical em problems evaluated at _ complex or imaginary frequencies _ , as is discussed further in sec .",
    "[ sec : complex - frequency ] .",
    "the nonzero - temperature case , where the integral over imaginary frequencies becomes a sum ( numerically equivalent to a trapezoidal - rule approximation ) , is discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec : finite - temperature ] .",
    "there is also another way to categorize the problem to be solved : whether one is solving a partial differential equation ( * pde * ) or an * integral equation*. in a pde , one has _ volumetric unknowns _ :",
    "fields or other functions at every point in space , related to one another _ locally _ by derivatives and so on . in an integral equation",

    "[ sub : bem - stress ] ) .",
    "the key point is to take advantage of the common situation in which one has piecewise - constant materials , yielding a _ surface integral equation_. ( there are also _ volume integral equations _ for inhomogeneous media  @xcite , as well as hybrid integral / pde approaches  @xcite , but these are less common . )",
    "there are other hybrid approaches such as _ eigenmode expansion _",
    "@xcite , also called _ rigorous coupled - wave analysis _ ( rcwa )  @xcite or a _ cross - section _",
    "method  @xcite : a structure is broken up along one direction into piecewise - constant cross - sections , and the unknown fields at the _ interfaces _ between cross - sections are propagated in the uniform sections via the _ eigenmodes _ of those cross - sections ( computed analytically or numerically by solving the pde in the cross - section ) .",
    "eigenmode expansion is most advantageous for geometries in which the cross - section is constant over substantial regions , just as integral - equation methods are most advantageous to exploit large homogeneous regions .",
    "casimir problems , for the most part , reduce to solving classical em linear pdes or integral equations where the unknowns reside in an infinite - dimensional vector space of functions . to _",
    "discretize _ the problem approximately into a finite number @xmath10 of unknowns , these unknown functions must be expanded in some finite _ basis _ ( that converges to the exact solution as @xmath11 ) .",
    "there are three typical types of basis :    * * finite differences *  @xcite ( * fd * ) : approximate a function @xmath12 by its values on some uniform grid with spacing @xmath13 , approximate derivatives by some difference expression [ e.g. second - order center differences @xmath14 and integrals by summations ( e.g. a trapezoidal rule ) . *",
    "* finite - element methods *  @xcite ( * fem * ) : divide space into geometric _ elements _ ( e.g. triangles / tetrahedra ) , and expand an unknown @xmath12 in a simple _ localized _ basis expansion for each element ( typically , low - degree polynomials ) with some continuity constraints .",

    "most commonly , fourier series or related expansions are used ( cosine series , fourier ",
    "bessel series , spherical or spheroidal harmonics , chebyshev polynomials , _ etc .",
    "finite differences have the advantage of simplicity of implementation and analysis , and the disadvantages of uniform spatial resolution and relatively low - order convergence ( errors typically @xmath15  @xcite or even @xmath16 in the presence of discontinuous materials unless special techniques are used  @xcite ) .",
    "fems can have nonuniform spatial resolution to resolve disparate feature sizes in the same problem , at a price of much greater complexity of implementation and solution techniques , and can have high - order convergence at the price of using complicated curved elements and high - order basis functions .",
    "spectral methods can have very high - order or possibly exponential ( `` spectral '' ) convergence rates  @xcite that can even suit them to analytical solution  hence , spectral methods were the dominant technique before the computer era and are typically the first class of methods that appear in any field , such as in mie s classic solution of wave scattering from a sphere  @xcite .",
    "however , exponential convergence is usually obtained only if all discontinuities and singularities are taken explicitly into account in the basis  @xcite . with discontinuous materials",
    ", this is typically only practical for very smooth , high - symmetry geometries like spheres , cylinders , and so on ; the use of a generic fourier / spectral basis for arbitrary geometries reduces to a brute - force method that is sometimes very convenient  @xcite , but may have unremarkable convergence rates  @xcite .",
    "bems require the most complicated implementation techniques , because any nontrivial change to the green s functions of the homogeneous regions ( e.g. a change in dimensionality , boundary conditions , or material types ) involves tricky changes to the singular - integration methods required to assemble the matrix  @xcite and to the fast - solver methods mentioned in sec .",

    "] note also that a _",
    "single _ casimir - force calculation requires the solution of _ many _ such equations , at the very least for an integral over frequencies ( see sec .",

    "there are essentially three ways to solve such a set of equations :    * * dense - direct * solvers : solve @xmath32 using direct matrix - factorization methods ( e.g. gaussian elimination ) , are necessarily iterative , but modern dense - eigensolver techniques employ direct factorizations as steps of the process  @xcite . ] requiring @xmath34 storage and @xmath35 time  @xcite . *",

    "if the number @xmath10 of degrees of freedom is small , i.e. if the basis converges rapidly for a given geometry , dense - direct methods are simple , quick , and headache - free ( and have a standard state - of - the - art implementation in the free lapack library  @xcite ) .",
    "for example , @xmath40 problems can be solved in under a second on any modern computer with a few megabytes of memory .",
    "up to @xmath41 is reasonably feasible , but @xmath42 requires almost 100  gb of memory and days of computation time without a large parallel computer .",
    "this makes dense - direct solvers the method of choice in simple geometries with a rapidly converging spectral basis , or with bem integral - equation methods for basic shapes that can be accurately described by a few thousand triangular panels , but they rapidly become impractical for larger problems involving many and/or complex objects ( or for moderate - size pde problems even in two dimensions ) .    in pde methods with a localized ( fd or fem ) basis ,",
    "the matrices @xmath36 have a special property : they are _ sparse _",
    "( mostly zero ) .",
    "the locality of the operators in a typical pde means that each grid point or element directly interacts only with a bounded number of neighbors , in which case @xmath36 has only @xmath38 nonzero entries and can be stored with @xmath38 memory .",
    "the process of solving @xmath32 , e.g. computing the lu factorization @xmath43 by gaussian elimination  @xcite , unfortunately , ordinarily destroys this sparsity : the resulting @xmath44 and @xmath45 triangular matrices are generally not sparse .",
    "however , the pattern of nonzero entries that arises from a pde is not random , and it turns out that clever re - orderings of the rows and columns during factorization can partially preserve sparsity for typical patterns ; this insight leads to _ sparse - direct _ solvers  @xcite , available via many free - software packages implementing different sparsity - preserving heuristics and other variations  @xcite .",
    "the sparsity pattern of @xmath36 depends on the dimensionality of the problem , which determines the number of neighbors a given element interacts with . for meshes / grids having nearest - neighbor interactions",
    ", a sparse - direct solver typically requires @xmath38 time and storage in 1d ( where the matrices are band - diagaonal ) , @xmath46 time with @xmath47 storage in 2d , and @xmath34 time with @xmath48 storage in 3d  @xcite .",
    "the practical upshot is that sparse - direct methods work well for 1d and 2d pdes , but can grow to be impractical in 3d . for bem and spectral methods",
    ", the interactions are not localized and the matrices are not sparse , so sparse - direct methods are not directly applicable ( but see below for an indirect technique ) .    for the largest - scale problems , or for problems lacking a sparse @xmath36 ,",
    "the remaining possibility is an _ iterative _ method . in these methods ,",
    "one need only supply a fast way to multiply @xmath36 by an arbitrary vector @xmath49 , and the trick is to use this @xmath50 operation on a clever sequence of vectors in such a way as to make an arbitrary initial guess @xmath51 converge as rapidly as possible to the solution @xmath52 , ideally using only @xmath38 storage .",
    "many such techniques have been developed  @xcite .",
    "the most favorable situation for @xmath53 occurs when @xmath36 is hermitian positive - definite , in which case an ideal krylov method called the _ conjugate - gradient _ method can be applied , with excellent guaranteed convergence properties  @xcite , and fortunately this is precisely the case that usually arises for the imaginary - frequency casimir methods below .",
    "there are two wrinkles that require special attention , however .",
    "first , one must have a fast way to compute @xmath50 .",
    "if @xmath36 is sparse ( as for pde and fd methods ) , then only @xmath38 nonzero entries of @xmath36 need be stored ( as above ) and @xmath50 can be computed in @xmath38 operations . in a spectral method , @xmath36 is generally dense , but for spectral pde methods there are often fast @xmath47 techniques to compute @xmath50 using only @xmath38 storage ( @xmath36 is stored implicitly ) , based on fast fourier transform ( fft ) algorithms  @xcite . in a bem , where @xmath36 is again dense , a variety of sophisticated methods that require only @xmath47 computation time and @xmath38 storage to compute @xmath50 ( again storing @xmath36 implicitly ) have been developed  @xcite , beginning with the pioneering fast - multipole method  ( fmm )  @xcite .",
    "these fast bems exploit the localized basis and the decaying , convolutional nature of the green s function to approximate long - range interactions ( to any desired accuracy ) .",
    "fmms can be viewed as an approximate factorizations into sparse matrices , at which point sparse - direct methods are also applicable  @xcite .",
    "a second wrinkle is that the convergence rates of iterative methods depend on the condition number of @xmath36 ( the ratio of largest and smallest singular values )  @xcite , and condition numbers generally worsen as the ratio of the largest and smallest lengthscales in the problem increases . to combat this ,",
    "users of iterative methods employ * preconditioning * techniques : instead of solving @xmath53 , one solves @xmath54 or similar , where the preconditioning matrix @xmath55 is some crude _ approximate inverse _ for @xmath36 ( but much simpler to compute than @xmath56 ! ) such that the condition number of @xmath57 is reduced  @xcite .",
    "the difficulty with this approach is that good preconditioners tend to be highly problem - dependent , although a variety of useful approaches such as incomplete factorization and coarse - grid / multigrid approximations have been identified  @xcite .",
    "the upshot is that , while the largest - scale solvers almost invariably use iterative techniques , for any given class of physical problems it sometimes takes significant research before the iterative approach becomes well - optimized .",
    "perhaps the simplest way to express the casimir energy , at zero temperature , is as a sum of zero - point energies of all oscillating em modes in the system : @xmath58 where @xmath1 is the frequency of the mode ( @xmath59 )  @xcite .",
    "that is , when the electromagnetic field is quantized into photons with energy @xmath60 , it turns out that the vacuum state in the absence of photons is not empty , but rather has the energy equivalent of `` half a photon '' in each mode .",
    "the computational strategy is then straightforward , in principle : compute the em eigenfrequencies @xmath1 in the problem by some numerical method ( many techniques are available for computing eigenfrequencies  @xcite ) and sum them to obtain @xmath45 .",
    "forces are then given by the derivative of @xmath45 with respect to changes in the geometry , which could be approximated by finite differences or differentiated analytically with a hellman ",
    "feynman technique  @xcite ( more generally , derivatives of any computed quantity can be computed efficiently by an adjoint method  @xcite ) .",
    "of course , @xmath45 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : u - sum ] ) has the disadvantage of being formally infinite , but this is actually a minor problem in practice : as soon as one discretizes the problem into a finite number of degrees of freedom ( e.g. , a finite number of grid points ) , the number of eigenfrequencies becomes finite ( with the upper bound representing a nyquist - like frequency of the grid ) .",
    "this is the numerical analogue  @xcite of analytical regularization techniques that are applied to truncate the same sum in analytical computations  @xcite .",
    "( these regularizations do not affect energy _ differences _ or forces for rigid - body motions . )",
    "matters are also somewhat subtle for dissipative or open systems  @xcite . but",
    "the most serious problem is that , even in the lossless case , this sum is badly behaved : even when one differentiates with separation @xmath61 to obtain a finite force @xmath62 , the summand is wildly oscillatory and includes substantial contributions from essentially _ every _ frequency , which mostly cancel to leave a tiny result  @xcite .",
    "numerically , therefore , one must ostensibly compute _ all _ of the modes , to high precision , which requires @xmath35 time and @xmath34 storage ( for a dense - direct eigensolver  @xcite ) given @xmath10 degrees of freedom .",
    "this is possible in simple 1d problems  @xcite , but is impractical as a general approach .",
    "because of the mathematical equivalence of the different approaches to the casimir problem , the mode - summation method is sometimes useful as a starting point to derive alternative formulations , but the end result is invariably quite different in spirit from computing the eigenfrequencies one by one and summing them . for example , if one has a function @xmath63 whose roots are the eigenfrequencies , then one can equivalently write @xmath45 , via the residue theorem of complex analysis , as @xmath64}{d\\omega}d\\omega$ ] , where @xmath65 is any closed contour in the complex-@xmath1 plane that encloses the roots  @xcite . however , finding functions whose roots are the eigenfrequencies naturally points towards green s functions ( to relate different boundary conditions ) , and the contour choices typically involve wick rotation as in sec .",

    "in order to better understand the frequency integration / summation in casimir problems , it is illustrative to examine the analytical formula for the simple case of two perfect - metal plates in vacuum separated by a distance @xmath61 , in which case it can be derived in a variety of ways that the attractive force @xmath66 is given by  @xcite:@xmath67\\\\   & = { \\operatorname{re}}\\left[\\int_{0}^{\\infty}f(\\omega)d\\omega\\right]={\\operatorname{im}}\\left[\\int_{0}^{\\infty}f(i\\xi)d\\xi\\right]=\\frac{\\hbar c}{240a^{4}},\\end{split } \\label{eq : lifshitz - metal}\\ ] ] where @xmath68 is the contribution of each frequency @xmath1 to the force and @xmath69 is related to the plate - parallel momentum of the contributing modes / fluctuations . in this special case , the entire integral",

    "possible _ as a consequence of causality .",
    "it turns out that the frequency contributions @xmath68 for arbitrary materials and geometries , for all of the different formulations of the casimir force below , are ultimately expressed in terms of classical em _ green s functions _ at @xmath1 : the em fields in response to time - harmonic currents @xmath2 . as a consequence of the causality of maxwell s equations and physical materials ",
    "em fields always arise _ after _ the source currents , not before ",
    "it mathematically follows that the green s functions must be analytic functions ( no poles or other singularities ) when @xmath73 ( the upper - half complex plane )  @xcite .",

    "merely evaluating @xmath68 along the real-@xmath1 axis is difficult because of singularities ( which ultimately reduce the integral to a summation over eigenfrequency - contributions as in sec .",

    "[ sec : eigenmode - summation ] , one must integrate over an infinite bandwidth , regularized in some way ( e.g. by the nyquist frequency placing an upper bound on @xmath1 for a finite grid ) , where the oscillations almost entirely cancel to leave a tiny remainder ( the force ) .",
    "( any physical materials must cease to polarize as @xmath80 where the susceptibility vanishes  @xcite , which will make the force contributions eventually vanish as @xmath80 even in  1d , but a very wide - bandwidth oscillatory integral is still required . )",

    "these techniques are not _ necessary _ for convergence , but they are simple to implement and provide significant efficiency benefits .",
    "the simplest technique is extrapolation in @xmath13 : since the convergence rate of the error with the spatial resolution @xmath13 is generally known _ a priori _ , one can fit the results computed at two or more resolutions in order to extrapolate to @xmath249 .",
    "the generalization of this approach is known as _ richardson extrapolation _",
    "@xcite , and it can essential increases the convergence order cheaply , e.g. , improving @xmath179 to @xmath178  @xcite .",

    "if one of the objects , say @xmath250 , is removed , then ( in principle ) there should be no net remaining force on @xmath36 .",
    "however , because of discretization asymmetry , a computation with @xmath36 alone will sometimes still give a small net force , which converges to zero as @xmath249 .",
    "if this `` error '' force is subtracted from the @xmath36@xmath250 force calculation , it turns out that the net error is reduced .",
    "more generally , the error is greatly reduced if one computes the @xmath36@xmath250 force and then subtracts the `` error '' forces for @xmath36 alone and for @xmath250 alone , tripling the number of computations but greatly reducing the resolution that is required for an accurate result  @xcite .",
    "third , when integrating the stress tensor @xmath251 over @xmath37 to obtain the net force ( [ eq : stress - integral ] ) , the most straightforward technique in fd is to simply sum over all the grid points on the integration surface  recall that each point @xmath37 requires a linear solve ( a different right - hand side ) in frequency domain , or alternatively a separate time - domain simulation ( a separate current pulse ) .",
    "this is wasteful , however , because @xmath251 is conceptually smoothly varying in space ",
    "if one could evaluate it at arbitrary points @xmath37 ( as is possible in the bem approach ) , an exponentially convergent quadrature scheme could be exploited to obtain an accurate integral with just a few @xmath37 s .",
    "this is not directly possible in an fd method , but one can employ a related approach . if the integration surface is a box aligned with the grid , one can expand the fields on each side of the box in a cosine series ( a discrete cosine transform , or dct , since space is discrete)this generally converges rapidly , so only a small number terms from each side are required for an accurate integration .",
    "but instead of putting in point sources , obtaining the responses , and expanding the response in a cosine series , it is equivalent ( by linearity ) to put in cosine sources directly instead of point sources .",
    "[ mathematically , we are exploiting the fact that a delta function can be expanded in any orthonormal basis @xmath252 over the surface , such as a cosine series , via : @xmath253 . substituting this into the right - hand side of ( [ eq : green - imag ] ) ,",
    "each @xmath252 acts like a current source and @xmath254 scales the result , which is eventually integrated over @xmath90 . ]",
    "the details of this process and its convergence rate are described in ref .",
    "@xcite , but the consequence is that many fewer linear systems ( fewer right - hand sides ) need be solved ( either in frequency or time domain ) than if one solved for the stress tensor at each point individually .",
    "another formulation of casimir interactions is to use a derivation based on path integrals .",
    "although the path - integral derivation itself is a bit unusual from the perspective of classical em , and there are several slightly different variations on this idea in the literature , the end result is straightforward : casimir energies and forces are expressed in terms of log determinants and traces of classical scattering matrices  @xcite , or similarly the interaction matrices ( [ eq : bem - matrix ] ) that arise in bem formulations  @xcite . here ,",

    "this approach appears to be especially attractive when one has complicated objects , for which a localized bem basis works well to express the boundary conditions , but the interactions are only to be computed at relatively large separations where the casimir interaction is dominated by a few low - order multipole moments .",

    "this method is called _ eigenmode expansion _",
    "@xcite or _ rigorous coupled - wave analysis _ ( rcwa )  @xcite , or alternatively a _ cross - section _ method  @xcite .",

    "an analogous method was recently applied to casimir problems  @xcite . in rcwa",
    ", one computes reflection and scattering matrices at a given frequency @xmath1 along some direction @xmath157 by expanding the fields at each @xmath157 in the basis of the eigenmodes of the cross - section at that @xmath157 ( waves with @xmath157 dependence @xmath314 at a given @xmath1 , where @xmath315 is called the _ propagation constant _ of the mode ) . along regions of uniform cross - section",
    ", the @xmath157 dependence @xmath314 of each mode is known analytically and no computation is required ( the mode amplitudes are multiplied by a diagonal propagation matrix @xmath316 ) .",
    "regions of continuously varying cross - section are approximated by breaking them up into a finite number of constant  cross - section layers ( as in object  1 of fig .",
    "[ fig : rcwa ] ) . at any @xmath157 where the cross - section changes , a change of basis is performed by matching boundary conditions (",
    "the @xmath317 components of the fields must be continuous ) , yielding a _ transfer matrix _ at that interface .",
    "all these transfer and propagation matrices can then be combined to compute scattering / reflection matrices for an entire structure .",
    "the main difference here from classical rcwa computations is that the modes are computed at imaginary frequencies @xmath72 . as in sec .",
    "[ sub : imaginary - green ] , this actually simplifies the problem . at an imaginary frequency @xmath71 ,",
    "the modes of a given cross - section @xmath318 and @xmath319 with @xmath157 dependence @xmath320 ( @xmath321 ) satisfy the eigenequation ( for isotropic materials )  @xcite:@xmath322 where the @xmath317 subscript indicates a two - component vector with @xmath317 ( transverse ) components .",
    "the operators on both the left- and right - hand sides are real - symmetric , while the operator on the left - hand side is positive - definite , and as a result the eigenvalues @xmath323 are purely real .",
    "this means that the propagation constants @xmath315 are purely imaginary ( all of the imaginary - frequency modes are evanescent in @xmath157 ) , and the analogues of incoming / outgoing waves are those that are exponentially decaying towards / away from the surface .",
    "moreover , the numerical problem of solving for these eigenmodes in a given cross - section reduces to a positive - definite generalized eigenvalue problem ( a definite matrix pencil  @xcite ) , to which the most desirable numerical solvers apply @xcite ( unlike the classical real-@xmath1 problem in which there are both propagating and evanescent modes because the problem is indefinite  @xcite ) . for homogeneous cross - sections",
    "( as in the space between the two objects ) , the solutions are simply planewaves of the form @xmath324 , where for vacuum @xmath325 .    for sufficiently simple cross - sections , especially in two - dimensional or axisymmetric geometries ,",
    "it is possible to solve for the modes analytically and hence obtain the scattering matrices , and this is how the technique was first applied to the casimir problem  @xcite . for more general geometries ,",
    "one can solve for the modes numerically by a variety of techniques , such as by a transfer - matrix method in two dimensions  @xcite or by a planewave expansion ( in the @xmath317 cross - section ) in three dimensions  @xcite .",
    "of course , one truncates to a finite number of modes via some cutoff @xmath326 ( which follows automatically from discretizing the cross - section in a finite grid , for example ) , and convergence is obtained in the limit as this cutoff increases . given a basis of eigenmodes with some cutoff",
    ", the process of constructing the scattering / reflection matrices is thoroughly discussed elsewhere  @xcite , so we do not review it here .",
    "the strength of rcwa is that regions of uniform cross - section are handled with at most a 2d discretization of the cross - section , independent of the thickness of the region , so very thick or very thin layers can be solved efficiently .",
    "the main limitation of rcwa methods is that the transfer matrices ( and the resulting reflection matrices @xmath307 and @xmath308 ) are dense @xmath28 matrices , where @xmath10 is the number of modes required for convergence . if @xmath10 is large , as in complicated three - dimensional structures , the problem can quickly become impractical because of the @xmath34 storage and @xmath35 computation requirements .",
    "the most favorable case is that of periodic structures with relatively simple unit cells , in which case the problem can be reduced to that of computing the modes of each periodic unit cell ( with bloch - periodic boundary conditions ) as discussed below , and rcwa can then be quite practical even in three dimensions .",
    "non - periodic structures , such as compact objects , can be handled by perfectly matched layer ( pml ) absorbing boundaries  @xcite , albeit at greater computational cost because of the increased cross - section size .",
    "in this section , we briefly discuss the issue of periodicity and other symmetries , which can be exploited to greatly reduce the computational effort in casimir calculations just as for classical em calculations .    if a structure is periodic in the @xmath52 direction with period @xmath306 , as in fig .",
    "[ fig : rcwa ] , the problem simplifies considerably because one can reduce the computation to a single unit cell of thickness @xmath306 .",
    "in particular , one imposes bloch - periodic boundary conditions  the fields at @xmath327 equal the fields at @xmath328 multiplied by a phase factor @xmath329and computes the casimir energy or force for each bloch wavevector @xmath330 separately , then integrates the result over @xmath330 via @xmath331 .",
    "this can be derived in a variety of ways , for example by applying bloch s theorem  @xcite to decompose the eigenmodes into bloch - wave solutions for each @xmath330 , or by expanding the delta functions of the fluctuation ",
    "dissipation approach in a fourier series  @xcite .",
    "more generally , for any periodic unit cell , one can perform the casimir energy / force computation for the unit cell with bloch periodic boundaries and then integrate the bloch wavevector @xmath332 over the irreducible brillouin zone ( multiplied by the volume ratio of the brillouin zone and the irreducible brillouin zone ) .",
    "the specific case of continuous translational symmetry , say in the @xmath52 direction , corresponds @xmath333 and one must integrate over all @xmath330 ( the brillouin zone is infinite ) .",
    "certain additional simplifications apply in the case of a perfect - metal structure with continuous translational symmetry , in which case the fields decompose into two polarizations and the @xmath89 integration can be performed implicitly  @xcite .",
    "rotational symmetry can be handled similarly : the fields can be decomposed into fields with @xmath289 angular dependence , and the total force or energy is the sum over all integers @xmath334 of the contributions for each @xmath334  @xcite .",
    "more generally , the casimir contributions can be decomposed into a sum of contributions from irreducible representations of the symmetry group of the structure ( e.g. all eigenmodes can be classified into these representations  @xcite ) ; translational and rotational symmetries are merely special cases . as another example , in a structure with a mirror symmetry one could sum even- and odd - symmetry contributions ( in fact , this is the underlying reason for the te / tm polarization decomposition in two dimensions  @xcite ) .",
    "in the preceding sections , we discussed only the computation of casimir interactions at zero temperature @xmath119 .",
    "however , the modification of any imaginary - frequency expression for a casimir interaction from @xmath335 to @xmath232 is almost trivial : one simply performs a sum instead of an integral . if the @xmath335 interaction ( energy , force , etc . )",
    "is expressed as an integral @xmath336 of some contributions @xmath337 at each imaginary frequency @xmath72 , then the @xmath232 interaction is well known to be simply  @xcite : @xmath338 where @xmath339 is boltzmann s constant and @xmath340 indicates a sum with weight @xmath341 for the @xmath342 term .",
    "the frequencies @xmath343 are known as matsubara frequencies , and the corresponding ( imaginary ) matsubara wavelengths are @xmath344 where @xmath345 .",
    "the conversion of the @xmath335 integral into a summation can be derived in a variety of ways , most directly by considering thermodynamics in the matsubara formalism  @xcite .",
    "physically , this arises from the @xmath346 bose ",
    "einstein distribution factor that appears in the fluctuation  dissipation expressions  ( [ eq : ecorr - real ] ) for nonzero temperatures . when the contour integration is performed over @xmath1 , the @xmath118 introduces poles at @xmath347 that convert the integral into a sum via the residue theorem ( with the @xmath342 residue having half weight because it lies on the real-@xmath1 axis )  @xcite . as explained in sec .",
    "[ sub : imaginary - green ] , some care must be applied in evaluating the @xmath342 term because of the well known singularity of maxwell s equations at @xmath348 ( where the @xmath82 and @xmath83 fields decouple ) , and one may need to take the limit @xmath147 ( although there is some controversy in the unphysical case of perfect metals  @xcite )    mathematically , the sum of eq .",
    "( [ eq : nonzero - t ] ) is exactly the same as a trapezoidal - rule approximation for the @xmath335 integral , with equally spaced abscissas @xmath349  @xcite .",
    "thanks to the @xmath350 convergence of the trapezoidal rule  @xcite , this means that the @xmath232 result is quite close to the @xmath335 result unless @xmath337 varies rapidly on the scale of @xmath351 .",
    "in particular , suppose that @xmath337 varies on a scale @xmath352 , corresponding to some lengthscale @xmath61 in the problem ( typically from a surface  surface separation ) .",
    "in that case , assuming @xmath337 has nonzero slope has zero slope at @xmath353 , then the trapezoidal rule differs from the integral by @xmath354 or less , depending upon which derivative is nonzero at @xmath353  @xcite .",
    "] at @xmath353 ( typical for interactions between realistic metal surfaces ) , then the nonzero-@xmath84 correction should be of order @xmath355 . at room temperature ( @xmath356  k ) , @xmath357 m , and the temperature corrections to casimir interactions are typically negligible for submicron separations  @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , it is possible that careful material and geometry choices may lead to larger temperature effects  @xcite .",
    "there is also the possibility of interesting effects in nonequilibrium situations ( objects at different temperatures )  @xcite , but such situations are beyond the scope of this review .",
    "the area of numerical casimir computations remains rich with opportunities .",

    "the same parallels also caution against any absolute `` rankings '' of the different approaches , as different numerical techniques have always exhibited unique strengths and weaknesses in both theory and practice . and",
    "because computer time is typically much less expensive than programmer time , there is something to be said for methods that may be theoretically suboptimal but are easy to implement ( or are available off - the - shelf ) for very general geometries and materials . nor is the value of analytical and semi - analytical techniques diminished , but rather these approaches are freed from the tedium of hand computation to focus on more fundamental questions .",
