    "the existence of fluctuations of the electromagnetic field of both quantum and thermal origin gives rise to a force acting on neutral atoms in proximity to polarizable macroscopic bodies .",
    "this force , which is the generalization of the van der waals interaction , was theoretically investigated by casimir and polder @xcite , and can be considered as the atomic counterpart of the casimir force acting between macroscopic bodies @xcite .",
    "because of its simple geometry , particular attention has been devoted to the interaction between an atom and a planar slab . for this configuration , the theoretical predictions have been confirmed by several experiments , based on different setups , including deflection of atomic beams close to surfaces @xcite , classical and quantum reflection of cold atoms @xcite and bose - einstein condensates ( becs ) @xcite , and dipole oscillations of becs above dielectric substrates @xcite .    deviations from the ideal case initially considered by casimir and polder , namely equilibrium systems at zero temperature and perfectly conducting plates , have been studied in the literature . for instance , it was shown that the qualitative and quantitative features of casimir - polder forces can be tailored by acting on the optical properties of the surface @xcite . in this context , an important role",
    "is played by surface resonances ( such as surface plasmons in metals ) , i.e. collective coupled light - charge excitations propagating along the surface and exponentially decaying in the orthogonal direction .",
    "these are known to give a relevant contribution in several fluctuation - induced phenomena , such as casimir - related effects @xcite and radiative heat transfer @xcite .",
    "moreover , the geometry of the slab can also play an important role , as it was recently shown by studying the interaction between an atom and a corrugated surface @xcite .",
    "recently , it has been shown that placing the atom in an environment out of thermal equilibrium can modify the behavior of the force , giving rise to repulsive interactions and anomalous power - law dependencies @xcite .",
    "out - of - equilibrium configurations can be realized with different setups , including configurations where different temperatures are simultaneously present in the system ( e.g. a different temperature of the slab and the environment  @xcite ) and also scenarios where one or more external lasers are acting on a system initially in thermal equilibrium . in this last case",

    "our work is motivated by the opportunities offered by nonequilibrium configurations when coupled to material s optical properties and by the wide theoretical and experimental efforts in tailoring casimir - polder forces .",
    "we start by studying how the atom - surface interaction energy is modified when the population of the surface - plasmon modes deviates with respect to its value at thermal equilibrium . to this aim",
    ", we first theoretically assume a thermal imbalance between the surface - plasmon population and all the other modes , showing that this can modify the shape of the atomic potential giving rise , for instance , to a potential barrier .",
    "inspired by these results , we move to a scenario where one or two lasers undergo total internal reflection behind the surface , thus unbalancing the surface - plasmon population . by using a density - matrix description of the electromagnetic field ,",

    "[ secconclusions ] some final remarks .",
    "in this section we briefly review some fundamental concepts of the physics of electromagnetic atom - surface fluctuation - induced interactions @xcite .",
    "the interaction ( free ) energy of a neutral polarizable atom in an electromagnetic field is given by @xmath0 where the atom is modeled in terms of an electric dipole described by the operator @xmath1 , and @xmath2 is the electric filed operator evaluated at the atom position @xmath3 .",
    "the symbol @xmath4 denotes the mean value taken over the initial state of the atom + ( field+matter ) system of symmetrically ordered operators . since @xmath1 and @xmath2 commute at equal times",
    ", this choice of ordering operators is irrelevant for the expression in eq .  .",
    "however , this is not always true when a perturbative approach is used . in this case",
    ", a well - defined ordering choice has to be keep consistent throughout the calculation .",
    "as it was pointed out by dalibard , dupont - roc and cohen - tannoudji @xcite the symmetric ordering is the only one that allows for a well defined physical interpretation of the terms describing different system s contribution ( see below ) .",
    "clearly , in equilibrium the final result will not depend on the specific choice and for nonequilibrium confgurations this allows to avoid the appearance of unphysical terms .",
    "we will assume that the state of the system is factorized and the corresponding density matrix is given as @xmath5 , where both the field+matter ( described by @xmath6 ) and the atom ( described by @xmath7 ) are assumed to be locally in thermal equilibrium but not necessarily at the same temperature .    in a perturbative scheme ,",
    "the dynamics of the dipole and field operators can be written as @xmath8 and @xmath9 .",
    "the superscript `` fr '' indicates the free evolution , i.e. , the dynamics of the atom without the field+matter system and vice versa .",
    "the `` in '' terms denote the contributions induced by the coupling , and in the frequency domain they can be written as @xmath10 the quantity @xmath11 describes the atomic bare polarizability dyadic operator and @xmath12 is the electromagnetic green tensor . within this perturbative approach ,",
    "can be then split into two contributions @xmath13 the first term is a  field \" term , that we call @xmath14 .",
    "it gives a contribution to the interaction energy arising from the intrinsic fluctuations of the field .",
    "the second term , @xmath15 , is an  atom \" term and contains the intrinsic fluctuations of the dipole .",
    "note that , within the symmetric order used here , both contributions are real and nonzero and the atom - surface interaction is therefore ascribable to both the atom s and the field s ( quantum ) fluctuations  @xcite ( an alternative ordering , normal or anti - normal , will attribute more weight to one of the previous terms ) .",
    "if retardation is neglected and the field is treated classically , only the term @xmath15 is nonzero and it describes the van der waals interaction between the atom and the surface @xcite .",
    "therefore , it is commonly believed that for small enough atom - surface distances , @xmath15 provides the dominant attractive contribution to the interaction in the case of nonmagnetic systems .",
    "below we show , however , that this is not true in general , and that the strength as well as the sign of @xmath15 are strongly affected by the properties of the whole system .      considering that the atom and the field+matter subsystems are in two thermal states characterized by temperatures @xmath16 and @xmath17 , respectively , the fluctuation - dissipation theorem yields @xcite @xmath18,\\\\ u_\\text{a}&=-\\frac{\\hbar}{2\\pi}\\int_0^{\\infty}\\hspace{-2mm}d\\omega\\,\\coth\\bigl(\\frac{\\hbar\\omega}{2k_{b}t_{\\rm a}}\\bigr ) { \\rm tr}\\bigl[\\underline{\\alpha}^{(t_{\\rm a})}_{i}(\\omega)\\cdot\\underline{\\mathcal{g}}_{r}(\\mathbf{r}_\\text{a},\\omega)\\bigr].\\\\ \\end{split}\\ ] ] here , @xmath19 is the atomic thermal polarizability tensor , and @xmath20 is the scattered part of the green tensor , @xmath21 $ ] , where @xmath22 is the free - space green function .",

    "one can verify that by summing up the two contributions in eq .  , the standard casimir - polder equilibrium ( @xmath26 ) interaction energy is recovered .    the bare polarizability tensor operator appearing in eq .",

    ", we also assumed that the matrix element @xmath34 is real .",

    ", @xmath49 is the dielectric permittivity of the medium , @xmath50 and @xmath51 .",
    "we see from eq .",
    "that , in virtue of the cylindrical symmetry of the problem , the interaction energy will only depend on the atom - surface distance @xmath52 , i.e. on the @xmath45 coordinate of the atom .",
    "we will now focus on the specific case of a metallic plate , whose dielectric properties can be modeled using the drude model @xmath53 $ ] , where @xmath54 is the plasma frequency and @xmath55 the relaxation rate .",
    "this model predicts the existence of a surface plasmon mode , describing a polaritonic state of the field+matter system .",
    "such a mode stems from collective oscillations of the electronic density of charge near the metal / vacuum interface and is associated to an evanescent field .",
    "the dispersion relation of the plasmon mode , existing only in tm polarization , can be derived from the poles of the transverse magnetic reflection amplitude @xmath56 at the interface .",
    "hence , the general analytic expression of its dispersion relation can be derived by solving @xmath57 . in the simplified scenario of a lossless metal ( i.e. @xmath58 ) ,",
    "the surface - plasmon dispersion relation follows straightforwardly and takes the form @xmath59 for large values of @xmath60 , the mode frequency tends to the asymptotic plasmonic frequency @xmath61 .",
    "when the atom is within the surface s near - field ( @xmath62 ) , the scattered green tensor can be approximated by its electrostatic limit ( @xmath63 ) .",
    "if , in addition , we consider the lossless limit ( @xmath64 ) we can write , @xmath65 .",
    "\\end{split}\\ ] ]    we are now ready to compute the two contributions to the interaction energy for an isotropic atom on top of a semi - infinite metallic medium , under the approximations stated above .",
    "we obtain    @xmath66    @xmath67    [ energies - nonretarded ]    note that , near the interface , the strength and the either attractive or repulsive nature of each of these two contributions depend on the relative magnitude of the atomic resonant frequency @xmath37 and the surface - plasmon frequency @xmath68 , as well as on the temperature of each subsystem : the higher is @xmath68 the less is the inertia of the charges in the medium . as a result ,",
    "when @xmath37 is much smaller than @xmath68 , the image dipole is perfectly anti - correlated with the atomic dipole , resulting in an attractive interaction .",
    "however , as soon as the atomic frequency approaches the surface plasmon frequency , the electrons in the metal can not follow the high frequency oscillations of the dipole , leading to a reduction of the correlation with its image which results in a weaker force and eventually in a repulsive interaction .",
    "a dispersionless description for the material ignores a priori any internal dynamics of the medium .    to gain further insights it is interesting to contrast the previous result with that one",
    "would have obtained by using a constant positive permittivity @xmath69 , where @xmath28 gives the material refractive index ( this approach has been often used in the evaluation of the casimir - polder interaction ) . in this case",
    "one can show that in the near field this leads to @xmath70 and to @xmath71 given by the same expression but with the principal value term replaced by @xmath72 .",
    "as another example , let us consider the case of a surface made of an ideal metal , which can be obtained by taking the limit @xmath73 in the previous expressions . in this case",
    "the field term @xmath14 also vanishes , and the interaction is solely given by the atomic term @xmath15 , which results monotonic and attractive .",
    "it is well known that it can also be derived from an image dipole calculation , considering the interaction energy between the fluctuating dipole @xmath74 and the electric field @xmath75 generated by its image @xmath76 in the reflecting planar surface @xcite .",
    "thus , one finds in this case @xmath77 however , for realistic materials showing a resonance in their permittivity , the field term is nonzero due to the existence of surface modes , which are absent otherwise . in eqs .",
    "the field term can still be neglected with respect to the atomic term ( @xmath78 ) as long as @xmath79 .",
    "for example , at thermal equilibrium @xmath80 k , for a two - level atom with transition frequency @xmath81rad / s ( close to the two most relevant transitions of rubidium , see below ) in front of a gold surface ( described using a drude model with @xmath82ev and @xmath83mev @xcite ) , @xmath84 .",
    "the two approximations performed here , namely a lossless metal and the quasi - static limit , give us a hint about the behavior of the field and atom contributions defined in eq .   to the total atom - surface interaction .",
    "in the end of this section , however , we abandon these approximations and study numerically the interaction at arbitrary atom - surface distances , at thermal equilibrium at zero temperature , between a two - level isotropic atom and a gold half - space . in order to perform this calculation , we first observe that @xmath14 and @xmath15 can be written as @xmath85 and @xmath86 , where @xmath87 is the total interaction energy at temperature @xmath88 , and @xmath89 is a correction that can be cast in the form @xmath90 .\\ ] ] it is well known ( see e.g. @xcite ) that the total interaction @xmath87 at thermal equilibrium can be easily calculated by means of a wick rotation , which at temperature @xmath91 gives @xmath92.\\ ] ] we tackle the correction @xmath89 with the same approach .",
    "hence , we start from the expression for the polarizability and we attribute to the pole at @xmath93 a small negative imaginary part , in order to be consistent with causality .",
    "thus , the complex conjugate @xmath94 appearing in eq .   has a pole with positive imaginary part .",

    "although the total energy @xmath97 always corresponds to an attractive atom - surface force , each of the individual terms can correspond , at short distances , to attraction or repulsion , depending on the ratio @xmath98 .",
    "both terms show oscillatory behaviors as a function of the atom - surface distance @xmath99 that are exactly out of phase . at large separations",
    "they cancel each other , while at short separations the attractive term dominates , resulting in the well known attractive and monotonic casimir - polder interaction .     at @xmath100 for an isotropic atom above a gold half - space ( drude model with @xmath82ev and @xmath83mev ) as a function of the atom - wall distance @xmath99 .",
