    "the ideal @xmath131 makes sense over any field and has the same generators ( the classical plcker relations ) .",

    "another result that we observed in both of these nice cases is that it was enough to look at quadratic polynomials in @xmath131 to define the tropical grassmannian .",

    "we summarize our result this in the following theorem .",

    "in fact , there is no inclusion in either direction between the tropical grassmannians @xmath24 in characteristic two and in characteristic zero . to see this ,",
    "we modify our vector @xmath46 as follows : @xmath573 then @xmath574 , which is not monomial if @xmath575 , but it is a monomial if @xmath572 .",
    "this shows that @xmath576 does not lie in @xmath577 if the characteristic of @xmath83 is two . by recomputing the grbner basis in characteristic zero ,",
    "we find that the initial ideal @xmath578 contains no monomial , and hence does lie in @xmath577 if the characteristic of @xmath83 is zero .",
    "the above argument also shows that , in any characteristic , either @xmath310 or @xmath579 will be a monomial - free initial ideal which has a minimal generator of degree three .",
