    "there has been much recent interest within the control community in the study of multi - agent systems in which the agents interact according to simple , local rules , resulting in coordinated global behavior .",
    "unfortunately , the dynamics describing the interactions of such systems are often time - varying and nonlinear and their analysis appears to be at present impossible without making considerably simplifying assumptions .",
    "for instance , it is a common assumption in much of the literature on multi - agent control that the graphs governing the inter - agent interactions satisfy some sort of long - term connectivity condition .",
    "this assumption is necessary due to the apparent intractability of analyzing the long - term connectivity properties associated with the graph of a multi - agent system governed by time - varying and nonlinear local interactions .",
    "encouraging results without long - term connectivity conditions have however been obtained for opinion dynamics models , one of the simplest and most natural class of multi - agent systems with time - varying interactions .",
    "these models have been recently proposed ( see @xcite , @xcite , and the survey @xcite ) to model opinion changes resulting from repeated personal interactions among individuals and have attracted considerable attention within the control community ( see @xcite ) .",
    "much of this attention is due to the similarities between opinion dynamics models and various dynamics arising in multi - agent control .",
    "indeed , opinion dynamics are also nonlinear when the inter - agent interactions change with time and depend on on the states of the agents .",
    "consequently , it is believed that the techniques developed to rigorously analyze the asymptotic behavior of these models will be useful in the analysis of more complex multi - agent systems whose nonlinearity arises from state - dependent and time - varying inter - agent interactions .",
    "it has recently been shown for opinion dynamics systems with finitely many agents that the symmetry of the inter - agent interactions ( or actually a weak symmetry condition called ) was sufficient to guarantee the convergence of all agents , _ independently of any long - term connectivity condition _",
    "@xcite , something which makes the analysis of the asymptotic behavior of numerous systems considerably easier .",
    "related observations for discrete - time systems were made in @xcite ( see also references in @xcite as well as @xcite and @xcite )",
    ".    such general results are lacking for systems involving infinitely many agents , or a continuous mass of agents , even though partial results have been obtained under specific assumptions on the way interactions take place @xcite ( the authors of @xcite also consider systems involving a continuous mass of agents , but focuse on the existence and uniqueness of solutions , and on the possibility of approximating it by finite - dimensional systems ) .",
    "our goal in this paper is to analyze the extent to which the results obtained for finitely many agents @xcite or for some specific models @xcite remain valid for general opinion dynamics models .",
    "we now give a precise statement of the dynamics we will study .",
    "we consider the functions @xmath0 \\rightarrow \\r$ ] which are solutions of the equation @xmath1 with initial condition @xmath2 . here",
    "@xmath3 is a nonnegative function .",
    "the equation has a natural interpretation : each agent @xmath4}}$ ] continually adjusts its `` opinion '' @xmath5 to move closer to the opinions of other agents , giving to each agent @xmath6 a nonnegative weight @xmath7 , which may depend on the identities of the two agents , their opinions , and on time .    often , the function @xmath3 is taken to be @xmath8 for some `` opinion radius @xmath9 , '' which corresponds to every agent adjusting its opinion based only on the opinions of other like - minded agents ; this is the so - called hegselmann - krause model . we will not be making this assumption here and will instead study the more general case .",
    "thus the weight agent @xmath10 accords agent @xmath6 can vary based on the time @xmath11 , the indices @xmath10 and @xmath6 , and the values @xmath12 and @xmath13 without loss of generality by appropriately modifying @xmath3 .",
    "nevertheless , we will continue writing @xmath3 as a function of five arguments for simplicity of presentation . ] .",
    "several technical assumptions are necessary for eq .",
    "( [ mainiteration ] ) to make sense .",
    "the function @xmath3 is assumed to be jointly measurable in all variables .",
    "a constraint on @xmath3 is needed to ensure that the integral in eq .",
    "( [ mainiteration ] ) is finite ; we will assume that @xmath3 is bounded , i.e. , there exists some constant @xmath14 so that @xmath15 for all values of @xmath16 .",
    "since our focus in this paper is on properties of solutions of eq .",
    "( [ mainiteration ] ) when they exist , we will not analyze in detail the questions of existence and uniqueness ; rather we will assume in the body of the paper that for each @xmath17 $ ] , @xmath5 is an absolutely continuous function such that eq .",
    "( [ mainiteration ] ) is satisfied ) that exists .",
    "furthermore , we prove in appendix a that existence and uniqueness of the kind of solutions we study does actually hold under some lipschitz assumptions on the function @xmath3 . ] for almost all @xmath11 .",
    "we will assume that the initial distribution of opinions is bounded , i.e. , @xmath18 $ ] for all @xmath17 $ ] , and that solutions do not explode in finite time , in the sense that @xmath19,t \\leq t } { { |}}x_t(\\alpha){{|}}$ ] is finite for every @xmath20 ( we will later see that all opinions then remain in @xmath21 $ ] for all ) may have certain `` pathological '' solutions which are not absolutely continuous or explode in finite time .",
    "thus we restrict our attention in this paper to study of properties of any solutions that are well - behaved , i.e. , absolutely continuous with bounded suprema . in general , whether solutions which satisfy these properties exist , or whether all solutions satisfy these properties , are open questions .",

    "_ we will be making these assumptions throughout the remainder of this paper ( except for appendix a on existence and uniqueness of solutions ) without mention . _",
    "we now present some instantiations of eq . , and show that our general model not only encompasses many classical models having appeared in the literature , but also allows representing new classes of more complex models .",
    "_ example 1 .",
    "consensus of finitely many agents .",
    "_ continuous consensus dynamics have been widely studied in multi - agent control ( see e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "these are the dynamics given by @xmath22 where @xmath23 are arbitrary nonnegative numbers .",
    "intuitively , there are @xmath24 distinct agents which run dynamics that repeatedly push the values @xmath25 closer to each other with `` interaction strengths '' @xmath23 . under some connectivity and regularity conditions",
    ", one can show that each @xmath26 will converge to the same number @xcite , which is why these dynamics are called `` consensus dynamics . ''",
    "continuous consensus dynamics may be viewed as a special case of eq .",
    "( [ mainiteration ] ) . indeed , define @xmath27 $ ] , and for any @xmath28 $ ] , if @xmath29 and @xmath30 , set @xmath31 .",
    "then it is immediate that if @xmath29 then @xmath32 . in other words , this particular choices of @xmath3 leads the agents to replicate continuous consensus dynamics .",
    "note that if @xmath33 , the function @xmath3 is symmetric in the sense of being unaffected by the interchange of @xmath10 and @xmath6 .",
    "consensus dynamics are a common tool throughout multi - agent control .",
    "we mention their use in coverage control @xcite , formation control @xcite , distributed estimation @xcite , distributed task assignment @xcite , and distributed optimization @xcite and @xcite .",
    "it is often the case that multi - agent controllers are designed either by a direct reduction to a consensus task or by using consensus dynamics ( in either continuous or discrete time ) as a subroutine .    due to the widespread use of consensus dynamics",
    ", it is of considerable interest to analyze their behavior in large - scale systems , i.e. , in the setting when the number of agents goes to infinity .",
    "some initial progress on questions of this type was made in @xcite , and we believe that the analysis of could prove instrumental in understanding the asymptotic properties of such systems .",
    "_ example 2 . the hegselmann - krause model .",
    "_ the model of opinion dynamics introduces by hegselmann and krause @xcite corresponds to @xmath34 here @xmath5 is usually thought of as an opinion of agent @xmath10 .",
    "intuitively , each agent ignores all opinions which deviate from its own by more than a certain `` opinion radius '' @xmath9 .",
    "however , each agent does move its opinion towards the average of those other agents whose opinions are at most @xmath9 from its own .",
    "note that hegselmann and krause studied in @xcite a discrete - time version of this model .    the original paper by hegselmann and krause @xcite spawned a vast follow - up literature analyzing variations of the model , some of which we discuss next .",
    "it is , in general , not possible to relate here all the observations that have been made about this model .",
    "nonetheless , we d like to take this opportunity to mention a series of recent breakthroughs analyzing the convergence time of the ( asymmetric ) version of this model in discrete - time @xcite .",
    "_ example 3 .",
    "hegselmann - krause models with unequal radii .",
    "_ it was proposed in the recent paper @xcite to study the unequal radii version , @xmath35 in contrast to the standard hegselmann - krause model , here each agent @xmath10 has a potentially different opinion radius @xmath36 which determines its openness to opinions of others . in the terminology of @xcite ,",
    "this is a _",
    "synchronized bounded confidence _ model .",
    "it was also proposed in @xcite to study @xmath37 this corresponds to each agent `` broadcasting '' its opinion to others , with different agents having different `` loudness '' and consequently reaching more agents . in the language of @xcite , this is a _",
    "synchronized bounded influence model .",
    "_ we remark that @xcite studied these models in discrete , rather than continuous time ( see also the related @xcite ) .",
    "moreover , we note that unlike the hegselmann - krause models , here @xmath3 may not be symmetric in the sense that the weight agent @xmath10 places on @xmath6 may be different than the weight agent @xmath6 places on @xmath10 .",
    "the results presented in this paper do thus not always apply to such systems .",
    "_ example 4 .",
    "some other opinion dynamics . _ the generality of eq .",
    "( [ mainiteration ] ) includes many other models of opinion dynamics .",
    "for example , it is natural to replace the sharp cutoff of the hegselmann - krause model with a smoother decline .",
    "this corresponds to agents which take the opinions of all other agents into account , but with decreasing strength as these opinions deviate from theirs .",
    "such models have appeared in the literature ; for example @xcite considered weight functions which are continuous functions of @xmath38 which drop to zero outside of a certain radius .",
    "another possibility is to model the decline of opinion influence with a gaussian decay , e.g. , as @xmath39 in other models motivated by robotic applications where sensors can not accurately sense robots that are too close ( see e.g. @xcite ) , weights are positive only when agents are separated by a distance within a certain range that does not include 0 , e.g. @xmath40 if @xmath41 $ ] and 0 else .",
    "alternatively , eq . ( [ mainiteration ] ) is general enough so that the usual assumption of homogeneity in opinion dynamic models may be dispensed with : for example , we may instead assume that agents come in @xmath42 different _ types _ and @xmath43 depends not only on the distance between @xmath5 and @xmath13 but also on the types of @xmath10 and @xmath6 .",
    "this would allow us to model a scenario wherein agents put more weight on the opinion of similar agents .",
    "we may also consider a model along these lines with a continuous measure of similarity , e.g. , @xmath44 this corresponds to agents which ignore the opinions not only of agents whose opinions are distant from theirs , but also agents which are not sufficiently similar .",
    "note that eq .",
    "( [ cont - type ] ) features a @xmath3 which is symmetric in the sense of being unaffected by interchange of @xmath10 and @xmath6 ; on the other hand , the model from eq .",
    "( [ gaussdecay ] ) described above will not be symmetric unless all the parameters @xmath45 are identical .    finally , we note that since @xmath43 and @xmath46 can be arbitrarily different functions whenever @xmath47 , eq . ( [ mainiteration ] ) can also model any mixture of the models we have just described .    as the previous examples make clear , eq .",
    "( [ mainiteration ] ) captures the properties of a number of popular opinion dynamic models , and furthermore , the generality of eq .",
    "( [ mainiteration ] ) allows us to describe a wide multitude of models not yet considered in the literature .",
    "it is therefore interesting to investigate how solutions of eq .",
    "( [ mainiteration ] ) behave .",
    "we next turn to our results on this subject .      unfortunately , in general eq .",
    "( [ mainiteration ] ) is not guaranteed to converge in any meaningful sense .",
    "indeed , as example 2 above makes clear , consensus of finitely many agents is a special case of eq .",
    "( [ mainiteration ] ) and consequently all the counterexamples to convergence of finitely many agents from , for example , @xcite can be adapted to this setting .",
    "we briefly spell out one example .",
    "consider the dynamic system which switches at integer times between the following two systems : @xmath48 this may be viewed as an instance of continuous consensus dynamics of example 1 in section 1.2 by defining the coefficients @xmath23 appropriately .",
    "it is easy to see that if @xmath49 then this dynamic leads to @xmath50 diverging as it alternates between being pulled in the direction of @xmath51 and being `` pulled '' in the direction of @xmath52 .    as we discussed in example 1 of section 1.2 , continuous consensus dynamics are a special case of eq .",
    "( [ mainiteration ] ) .",
    "we therefore conclude that , in general , it is not true that if @xmath5 satisfies eq .",
    "( [ mainiteration ] ) for some @xmath3 then all or almost all @xmath5 converge as @xmath53 .",
    "it is not even true that the distribution of values of @xmath5 converges in any meaningful sense : we see from the above example that a mass of agents can alternate between being close to @xmath51 and close to @xmath54 .",
    "however , we will show that under the assumption that @xmath3 is _ symmetric _",
    ", i.e. , @xmath55 the _ distribution _ of the agents is guaranteed to converge .",
    "we state this result formally next .",
    "first , we review the relevant notion of convergence of distributions .",
    "every function @xmath5 defines a measure @xmath56 on the real line in the natural way @xmath57 where @xmath58 refers to the lebesgue measure on the real line .",
    "these measures @xmath56 are a natural way to summarize the concentrations of the values @xmath5 .",
    "the most natural definition of convergence of distributions would be that @xmath59 for any borel measurable set @xmath60 ; this is referred to as _ strong convergence _ of measures and it is usually too restrictive to be used in practice ( under this definition , for example , defining @xmath61 we have that it is not true that @xmath62 converges to @xmath63 as @xmath53 ) .",
    "consequently , the most commonly used notion is _ convergence in distribution _ ( sometime referred to in this context as weak-@xmath64 convergence ) : @xmath56 approaches @xmath65 in distribution if @xmath59 for all sets @xmath60 whose boundary has measure @xmath66 under @xmath65 .",
    "equivalently , @xmath56 approaches @xmath67 in distribution if @xmath68 for every bounded continuous function @xmath69 .",
    "this equivalence is part of portmanteau s theorem , see for example @xcite .",
    "we can now state our first main result .",
    "[ weakconv ] suppose @xmath3 is nonnegative and symmetric and let @xmath5 be a solution of eq .",
    "( [ mainiteration ] ) and @xmath56 be defined as in eq .",
    "( [ mudef ] ) . then there exists a measure @xmath65 on @xmath21 $ ] such that @xmath56 approaches @xmath65 in distribution .",
    "theorem [ weakconv ] states that symmetry is sufficient for convergence ( though recall that we made several assumptions in order for eq .",
    "( [ mainiteration ] ) to make sense which we are not mentioning ) .",
    "we will see that it can directly be extended to multi - dimensional opinions .",
    "it is significantly stronger than the results previously available in the literature .",
    "for example , @xcite proves a version of theorem [ weakconv ] in a similar ( discrete - time ) model under the additional assumptions that @xmath3 depends only on @xmath38 ( so it is a function of just one argument ) .",
    "similarly , @xcite proves a version of theorem [ weakconv ] under the assumption that the solution @xmath5 is monotonic .",
    "we next turn to the question of whether it is possible to improve upon the conclusion of convergence in distribution .",
    "in fact , convergence in distribution does not seem to be the most natural notion of convergence for this class of systems ; the more plausible notion would be _ convergence of almost all agents _ , i.e. , that @xmath5 converges for almost all @xmath10 .",
    "we show , however , that convergence in this sense may not occur .",
    "[ counterexample ] there exists a symmetric , nonnegative @xmath3 and bounded functions @xmath70 satisfying eq .",
    "( [ mainiteration ] ) with this @xmath3 such that the set of @xmath10 where @xmath5 does not converge has positive measure .",
    "we believe that the contrast between theorem [ weakconv ] and theorem [ counterexample ] is somewhat surprising .",
    "indeed , for opinion dynamics of finitely many agents , it is not hard to see that convergence in distribution and of all agents are equivalent in continuous time but not in discrete time is a laplacian matrix then @xmath71 converges in distribution if and only if each @xmath72 converges ; on the other hand , there exist symmetric stochastic matrices @xmath60 such that @xmath73 has e the property that some @xmath72 diverges while the distribution of the vector @xmath74 remains fixed . ] .",
    "our initial conjecture when beginning this work was that for a continuum of agents with symmetric kernel , convergence will happen either in both senses or not at all ; however , these two theorems show this to be false .",
    "nevertheless , in spite of theorem [ counterexample ] , it may be possible that a stronger form of convergence holds in many natural settings .",
    "the extent to which this is true remains an open question .",
    "but , we are able to show that as long as agents with similar opinions exert a non - negligible pull on each other , almost all of the @xmath5 will indeed converge .",
    "formally , let us define the set of functions @xmath75 for @xmath76 to be the set of @xmath43 which satisfy the following property : if @xmath77 then @xmath78 we then have the following theorem .    [ densityconvergence ]",
    "if @xmath3 is symmetric , nonnegative , and belongs to some @xmath79 for @xmath76 , then @xmath5 converges for almost all @xmath10 .",
    "moreover , there exist a finite number of points @xmath80 $ ] with @xmath81 for all @xmath82 such that @xmath83 for almost all @xmath10 .",
    "we can also guarantee convergence for almost all agents when the interactions only depend on time and on the opinions via a sufficiently smooth and bounded function .",
    "[ thm : lips->conv ] suppose that the interaction weights @xmath84 are symmetric , nonnegative , and depend only on time and the positions : @xmath85 if @xmath86 is lipschitz continuous , i.e. @xmath87 for all @xmath88 , and some @xmath89 , then any soluton @xmath5 of ( [ mainiteration ] ) converges for almost all @xmath10 .",
    "we note that as a particular case of both results above , convergence of @xmath5 for almost all @xmath10 is guaranteed for the one - dimensional versions of the systems considered in @xcite , where the authors proved convergence in distribution .",
    "the rest of this paper is dedicated to providing proofs of these four theorems .",
    "theorem [ weakconv ] on convergence in distribution is proved in section [ weaksection ] .",
    "theorem [ counterexample ] on the possible absence of convergence of the opinions themselves is proved in section [ counterproof ] , while the positive convergence results , theorems [ densityconvergence ] and [ thm : lips->conv ] are proved in section [ strongsection ] .",
    "we briefly summarize and describe some open questions in section [ conclusion ] .",
    "+ finally , although a detailed analysis of questions of existence and uniqueness is outside the scope of the present paper , we show in appendix a that existence and uniqueness does hold in a substantial class of models , and therefore that our convergence results do apply to actual solutions in those cases .",
    "in this section we will prove theorem [ weakconv ] .",
    "our proof is quite short and rests on a novel combination of two techniques : a simple exchange of integrals to establish that _ every _ convex function is a lyapunov function ( see proof of lemma [ convdec ] ) coupled with an appeal to some results of haussdorff about the moment problem ( see proof of theorem [ weakconv ] below ) . but",

    "we justify this as follows .",
    "observe that ( i ) @xmath5 is jointly measurable in @xmath11 and @xmath10 because it is measurable in @xmath10 for fixed @xmath11 and lipschitz continuous in @xmath11 for fixed @xmath10 ( by lemma [ lem : x_[01]_lips ] ) .",

    "this section is dedicated to proving theorem [ counterexample ] showing that , intriguingly , there exist opinion dynamics systems converging in distribution for which a positive measure set of agents does not converge .      the proof , while somewhat technically involved , is based on a simple idea .",
    "we consider a situation in which there is always a constant mass of agents _ uniformly distributed _ between @xmath144",
    "$ ] with every agent constantly cycling between @xmath145 and @xmath146 .",
    "we will show that this cycling can take place at a speed @xmath147 which drops to zero with time but slowly enough so that every agent makes the loop from @xmath145 to @xmath146 infinitely many times .",
    "we accomplish this in terms of eq .",
    "( [ mainiteration ] ) as follows .",
    "there will be a mass of agents uniformly distributed in @xmath148 $ ] moving right ; and similarly mass of agents uniformly distributed in @xmath148 $ ] moving left .",
    "when each agent reaches @xmath149 , it switches from one mass to the other .",
    "agents moving right put a positive weight on agents _ to their right moving left _ while agents moving left put a positive weight on agents _ on their left moving right_.     specifically , every agent moving right will put a constant weight on all agents moving left and located within an interval of size @xmath150 to its right ; and similarly every agent moving left will put a constant weight on all agents moving right and located in an interval of size @xmath150 to its left .",
    "the idea is that an agent moving right will be pulled by @xmath150 agents at an average distance of @xmath150 , so that the average pull by each of the agents will be of strength @xmath150 because , @xmath3 being constant , the pulls agents exert on each other is proportional to their distance .",
    "thus its velocity will come out to be @xmath147 .",
    "however , this will not work for those agents which are closer than @xmath150 to @xmath146 and @xmath145 which do not have enough agents to their right and left , respectively .",
    "we fix this by introducing a unit mass of agents @xmath151 initially located at @xmath152 and a unit mass of agents @xmath153 initially located at @xmath154 .",
    "agents in @xmath148 $ ] within a distance @xmath150 of @xmath146 will put a positive weight on agents in @xmath151 while agents in @xmath148 $ ] within the same distance of @xmath145 will put a positive weight on agents in @xmath153 .",
    "the weights will be precisely chosen so that the agents within @xmath150 of @xmath146 and @xmath145 will cycle with speed @xmath147 , as the other agents in @xmath148 $ ] .",
    "note that because the weights are symmetric , this has the effect of pushing the agents in @xmath151 to the left over time and similarly pushing the agents in @xmath153 right over time .",
    "the user may refer to figure [ fig : counterex ] for a graphical representation .",
    "_ the key point is that the weights @xmath155 between , say , @xmath156 and @xmath6 in the right corner of @xmath148 $ ] only need to be of magnitude @xmath157 to make @xmath6 cycle with speed @xmath147 .",
    "_ this is simply because there is a unit mass of agents in @xmath151 and so as long as the separation between @xmath148 $ ] and the agents in @xmath151 is bounded away from zero , which we will show can be achieved , the weight needed to pull the agent @xmath6 with speed @xmath147 to the right is @xmath157 .",
    "similarly , the weights between @xmath153 and the left corner of @xmath148 $ ] need to be of magnitude @xmath157 .",
    "consequently , agents in @xmath151 move left with speed @xmath158 , since they get pulled left by a mass of agents of size @xmath150 on which they put weights of magnitude @xmath157 . if @xmath147 is chosen so that @xmath159 while @xmath160 is finite and sufficiently small , the agents in @xmath151 do not approach @xmath161 but rather remain bounded away from it .",
    "similarly , the agents in @xmath162 remain bounded away from @xmath145 .",
    "thus the motion we have just described - agents in @xmath151 moving left , agents in @xmath153 moving right , and agents between @xmath148 $ ] cycling - goes on forever , and the positive mass of agents cycling in @xmath148 $ ] never converge , even though the speed of the agents decay to 0 and the system converges in distribution consistently with theorem [ weakconv ] .      without further ado , we proceed to the technical details of the argument .",

    "the proof relies on the following idea : if an agent opinion is by a positive mass of agent opinion ( as is the case for almost all of them ) and does not converge , its repeated displacement will result is repeated displacements of that mass surrounding it , which forbids the convergence in distribution .",
