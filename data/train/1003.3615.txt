    "bright and narrow maser lines of methanol ( ch@xmath6oh ) have been found towards many star - forming regions  @xcite . according to the classification of  @xcite",
    ", methanol masers can be divided into two classes , i and ii , with each class characterized by a certain set of transitions .",
    "the class i maser transitions are the @xmath0 transition at 44  ghz , @xmath1 transition at 36  ghz , @xmath7 transition at 84 ghz , @xmath8 transition at 95  ghz etc . , while the class ii transitions are the @xmath9 transition at 6.7  ghz , @xmath10 transition at 12  ghz , the @xmath11 series of transitions at 157  ghz , etc .",
    "a list of the most powerful class i and ii transitions is presented in e.g. ,  @xcite .",
    "both class i and class ii masers are often overlaid upon broad thermal lines .",
    "many methanol transitions , e.g. , the series of @xmath12 transitions near 96  ghz , @xmath13 transitions near 145  ghz , @xmath14 transitions near 241  ghz etc .",
    "never exhibit maser features .",
    "these transitions are often called ",
    "purely thermal \" .",
    "the nature of methanol masers is still unknown .",
    "@xcite suggested that class i masers arise in postshock gas in the lobes of bipolar outflows , where the abundance of methanol is enhanced due to grain mantle evaporation .",
    "this hypothesis has further support in the fact that in a number of star - forming regions class i masers appear to be associated with outflows  @xcite .",
    "however , this hypothesis is not generally accepted because there are no high - velocity class i masers and the apparent association between the masers and the outflows may be caused by the fact that both of them arise in the same regions of star formation rather than by a physical association between these objects .",
    "the difficulties in the exploration of methanol masers partly appear because until recently the masers have been observed in regions of massive star formation , which are relatively distant ( 23 kpc from the sun or farther ) and highly obscured at the optical and even nir wavelengths .",
    "in addition , high mass stars usually form in clusters .",
    "these properties make it difficult to resolve maser spots and to associate masers with other objects in these regions . in contrast , regions of low - mass star formation are much more widespread and many of them are only 200300 pc from the sun ; they are less heavily obscured than regions of high - mass star formation , and there are many isolated low - mass protostars .",
    "therefore , the study of masers in these regions might be more straightforward compared to that of high - mass regions , and hence , the detection of class i masers in low - mass regions might have a strong impact on maser exploration . bearing this in mind",
    ", we performed in 2004 a   snapshot \" search for class i methanol masers towards bipolar outflows driven by low - mass ysos  @xcite ( paper i ) at 44 , 84 , and 95  ghz . the source list consisted of five so - called chemically rich outflows , where the abundances of methanol and some other molecules are increased as a result of grain mantle evaporation .",
    "the search proved successful : three maser candidates , ngc  1333i4a , hh25 , and l1157 were found at 44  ghz .",
    "vla observations of l1157 at 44  ghz confirmed that this source is really a maser  @xcite .",
    "therefore a further work in the field looks promising .    in order to obtain a general idea about the main properties of the class i masers in the regions of low - mass star formation",
    ", we performed a more extended search for these objects .",
    "the new survey was carried out at the frequency of the @xmath0 transition , but most sources were additionally observed in another class i maser line , the @xmath1 line at 36  ghz . the physical relation between low - mass protostellar outflows and class i methanol masers is poorly understood .",
    "hence , it is tempting to make a comprehensive survey of such outflows",
    ". unfortunately , the enormous amount of observing time makes such a survey unrealistic .",
    "the naive expectation , supported by the successful search of  @xcite is to find methanol masers towards bright thermal sources of methanol ; therefore the basis of our source list consists of outflows where  @xcite detected thermal emission in the @xmath7 , @xmath8 , and/or @xmath12 methanol lines .",
    "we included also three outflows , iras03282 , serpens s68firs1 and serpens smm4 , where  @xcite and  @xcite found a significant enhancement of methanol abundance relative to that in quescent gas .",
    "because methanol enhancement has been detected in young , well - collimated outflows from class 0 and i sources , we included several such objects in our list regardless of whether methanol enhancement had been found there .",
    "a subsample of our list consisted of ysos with known outflows and/or h@xmath15o masers located in bok globules  @xcite . like other objects from our list ,",
    "these ysos are typically isolated objects of low or intermediate mass , located in nearby ( @xmath16500  pc ) small and relatively simple molecular clouds . in total ,",
    "our source list consisted of 37 regions which harbor 46 known outflows driven by class 0 and i low - mass protostars , taken from the literature .",
    "the observed sources , positions , and the relevant literature are given in tables  [ gauss ] and  [ negative ] .",
    ".the parameters of the observed lines and those of the oso 20-m at the line frequencies .",
    "the parameters of the lines , observed in the preliminary survey  @xcite are included for completeness . [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^ \" , ]",
