    "the theme of @xmath0 ( parity  time ) symmetric systems was initiated in the works of bender and collaborators  @xcite as an alternative to the standard quantum theory , where the hamiltonian is postulated to be hermitian .",
    "the principal conclusion of these works was that @xmath0-invariant hamiltonians , which are not necessarily hermitian , may still give rise to completely real spectra , thus being appropriate for the description of physical settings . in terms of the schrdinger - type hamiltonians , which include the usual kinetic - energy operator and the potential term , @xmath3",
    ", the @xmath0-invariance admits complex potentials , subject to constraint that @xmath4 .",
    "recent developments in optics have resulted in an experimental realization of the originally theoretical concept of the @xmath0-symmetric hamiltonians , chiefly due to the work by christodoulides and co - workers  christo1 ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "it has been demonstrated that the controllable imposition of symmetrically set and globally balanced gain and loss may render optical waveguiding arrays a fertile territory for the construction of @xmath0-symmetric complex potentials .",
    "the first two such realizations made use of couplers composed of two waveguides with and without loss  @xcite ( so - called passive @xmath5couplers ) , or , in more ",
    "standard \" form , a pair of coupled waveguides , one carrying gain and the other one loss  @xcite .",
    "in fact , more general models of linearly coupled active ( gain - carrying ) and passive ( lossy ) intrinsically nonlinear waveguides , without imposing the condition of the gain - loss balance , were considered earlier , and stable solitons were found in them @xcite , including exact solutions @xcite ( see also a brief review in ref .",
    "recently , an electronic analog of such settings has also been implemented  @xcite .",
    "configurations with a hidden @xmath6 symmetry have been identified also in fine - tuned parameter regions of microwave billiards @xcite .",
    "effects of the nonlinearity in a gross - pitaevski equation on the @xmath7 properties of a bose - einstein condensate have been analyzed in @xcite .",
    "the possibility to engineer @xmath0-symmetric _ oligomers _  ( coupled complexes of a few loss - and gain - carrying elements ) @xcite , which may include nonlinearity , was an incentive to a broad array of additional studies on both the few - site systems and entire @xmath0-symmetric lattices  @xcite .",
    "more recently , nonlinear @xmath0-symmetric systems , incorporating @xmath0-balanced nonlinear terms , have drawn considerable interest  too @xcite-@xcite .    most of the @xmath0-invariant systems considered thus far have been one - dimensional ( 1d ) in their nature , although the stability of solitons in 2d periodic @xmath0-symmetric potentials has also been recently investigated @xcite .",
    "actually , 2d arrays of optical waveguides  can be readily built @xcite ( the same is true about other quasi - discrete systems , including electrical ones ) , hence , a natural question is whether @xmath0-symmetric oligomers ( and ultimately lattices built of such building blocks ) can be created in a 2d form .",
    "this work aims to make a basic step in this direction , by introducing fundamental 2d plaquettes consisting , typically , of four sites ( in one case , it will be a five - site cross ) .",
    "these configurations , illustrated by fig .  [ modes ] , are inspired by earlier works on 2d hamiltonian lattices described by discrete nonlinear schrdinger equations  @xcite , where diverse classes of modes , including discrete solitary vortices  malomed , pelin , have been predicted and experimentally observed  moti , yuri .",
    "the plaquettes proposed herein should be straightforwardly accessible with current experimental techniques in nonlinear optics , as a straightforward generalization of the coupler - based setting reported in ref .",
    "we start from the well - established hamiltonian form of such plaquettes in the conservative form , gradually turning on the gain - loss parameter ( @xmath2 ) , as the strength of the @xmath0-invariant terms , to examine stationary states supported by the plaquettes , studying their stability against small perturbations and verifying the results through direct simulations .",
    "actually , in this work we focus on those ( quite diverse , although , obviously , not most generic ) modes that can be found in an analytical form , while their stability is studied by means of numerical methods . the analytical calculations and the manifestations of interesting features , such as a potential persistence past the critical point of the linear @xmath0 symmetry , are enabled by the enhanced symmetry of the modes that we consider below .",
    "it is conceivable that additional asymmetric modes may exist too within these 2d configurations .",
    "our principal motivation for studying the above systems stems from the fact that realizations of @xmath0-symmetry e.g. within the realm of nonlinear optics will be inherently endowed with nonlinearity .",
    "hence , it is only natural to inquire about the interplay of the above type of linear systems with the presence of nonlinear effects .",
    "in addition to this physical argument , there exists an intriguing mathematical one which concerns the existence , stability and dynamical fate of the nonlinear states in the presence of @xmath0-symmetric perturbations .",
    "in particular , previous works  @xcite point to the direction that neither the existence , nor the stability of @xmath0-symmetric nonlinear states mirrors that of their linear counterparts ( or respects the phase transition of the latter generically ) .",
    "the presentation of our results is structured as follows .",
    "section [ symmetry ] contains a part of the analytical results , including a detailed analysis of the @xmath8symmetry properties of the nonlinear schrdinger type model , as well as the spectral properties of the linear hamiltonian subsystems .",
    "section [ numerics ] is devoted to the existence , stability and dynamics of stationary modes in the nonlinear systems . beside analytical results",
    ", it contains a detailed presentation of the numerical findings . in section [ conclu ]",
    "we summarize conclusions and discuss directions for future studies .",

    "the bifurcation responsible for the termination of the pair of branches may take a complex degenerate form [ such as the one in the case of setting ( a ) ] .",

    "in addition , we have identified cases [ like the gain - loss alternating pattern ( b ) or the cross plaquette of type ( d ) ] when the @xmath0 symmetry is broken immediately after the introduction of the gain - loss pattern .",
    "the spectral stability of the different configurations was examined .",
    "most frequently , the stationary modes are unstable , although stable branches were found too [ e.g. , in settings ( a ) and ( c ) ] .",

    "this feature , which is generic to conservative nonlinear systems , is shared by @xmath0-symmetric ones , due to the automatic \" balance between the separated gain and loss . on the other hand ,",
    "the breaking of the symmetry gives rise to the typical behavior of systems with competing , but not explicitly balanced , gain and loss , which generate a single or several _ attractors _ , i.e. , _ isolated _ solutions with a single or several values of the energy , rather than a continuous family .",
    "a paradigmatic example of the difference between continuous families of solutions in conservative models and isolated attractors in their ( weakly ) dissipative counterparts is the transition from the continuous family of solitons in the usual nlse to a pair of isolated soliton solutions , one of which is an attractor ( and the other is an unstable solution playing the role of the separatrix between attraction basins , the stable soliton and the stable zero solution ) in the complex ginzburg - landau equation , produced by the addition of the cubic - quintic combination of small dissipation and gain terms to the nlse @xcite . as concerns the systems considered in the present work , in the context of the breaking of the @xmath0 symmetry it may also be relevant to introduce a more general nonlinearity , which includes @xmath0-balanced cubic gain and loss terms , in addition to their linear counterparts ( cf .",
    "@xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "nevertheless , it should also be noted that the issue of potential existence of isolated solutions versus branches of solutions in @xmath0-symmetric systems is already starting to be addressed in the relevant literature ( including in plaquette - type configurations ) , as in the very recent work of  @xcite .",
    "moreover , the present work may pave the way to further considerations of two - dimensional @xmath0-symmetric lattice systems , and even three - dimensional ones . in this context , the natural generalization is to construct periodic two - dimensional lattices of the building blocks presented here , and to identify counterparts of the modes reported here in the infinite lattices , along with new modes which may exist in that case . on the other hand , in the three - dimensional realm",
    ", the first step that needs to be completed would consist of the examination of a @xmath0-symmetric cube composed of eight sites , and the nonlinear modes that it can support .",
    "this , in turn , may be a preamble towards constructing full three - dimensional @xmath0-symmetric lattices .",
