    "extensive studies of blue compact dwarf galaxies ( bcdgs ) have revealed that a large fraction of them are chemically unevolved small systems undergoing violent star formation activity ( thuan 1987 ) .",
    "the triggering mechanism of starbursts in bcdgs is still completely unknown .",
    "one of the approaches for understanding this mechanism is to investigate the morphological , kinematical and dynamical relationship between star  forming regions and their surrounding gas and also to search for global correlations between star  forming regions and the gas in various places of a galaxy . since bcdgs",
    "are among the best candidates for genuine zero - redshift young galaxies their kinematical and dynamical state may give also some clues on the nature of dark matter ( tremaine & gunn 1979 ) .",
    "the neutral gas component of some bcdgs has been kinematically studied with radio interferometers ( viallefond & thuan 1983 ; viallefond et al .",
    "1987 ; taylor et al .",
    "in the few objects studied so far , this gas shows core - halo distribution and some chaotic velocity superimposed on a regular velocity field indicative of a solid body rotation .    on the other hand",
    "the ionized gas component in bcdgs has a clumpy distribution and is mainly concentrated in at least one compact star  forming hii region immersed in an amorphous extended envelope of low luminosity ionized material ( kunth et al .",
    "the inner dynamics of hii regions in bcdgs has been investigated by gallagher & hunter ( 1983 ) and lequeux et al .",
    "velocity fields in bcdgs have been mapped using multi - slit observations ( tomita et al .",
    "1993 ) and h@xmath0 fabry - perot interferometric observations ( thuan et al .",
    "1987 ) .",
    "the combination of a fabry - perot interferometer with a large telescope provides high spatial and velocity resolution and allows to probe small scales in dwarf compact galaxies , yielding information on components not resolved on hi maps ( thuan et al .",
    "further , a bcdg not only has a small angular size and a compact distribution but at the same time exhibits very strong and narrow emission lines .",
    "for this reason bcdgs are ideal targets for fabry - perot interferometer observations . in this paper we present results relevant to the extreme metal  poor bcdg izw18 ( mrk116 ) .",
    "izw18 first was described by zwicky ( 1966 ) as a `` double system of compact galaxies '' .",
    "later izw18 became an outstanding extragalactic object when sargent & searle ( 1970 ) characterized it as `` isolated extragalactic hii region '' and found that it is extremely metal poor as compared to the sun ( searle & sargent 1972 ) .",
    "later on after 25 years more than 100 scientific papers have been addressed to this galaxy . but among them ,",
    "articles which contain data on izw18 as a extended two component system ( petrosian et al .",
    "1978 ; mazzarella & boroson 1993 ) are rare .",
    "optical imagery of izw18 has been published by hua et al .",
    "( 1987 ) , davidson et al .",
    "( 1989 , hereafter dkf89 ) , dufour & hester ( 1990 , hereafter dh90 ) and martin ( 1996 , hereafter m96 ) .",
    "broadband wfpc2 on hst observations were carried out by hunter & thronson ( 1995 , hereafter ht95 ) .",
    "ghrs hst spectroscopic observations revealed very low oxygen abundance in the hi envelope of this galaxy ( kunth et al .",

    "( 1987 ) and radio continuum observations by klein et al .",
    "( 1983 ) were also reported .",
    "probably due to its very low metal - content izw18 has been detected neither by iras ( kunth & sevre 1986 ; mazzarella et al .",
    "1991 ) nor in co millimeter line ( arnault et al .",
    "1988 ) .    as part of our high spatial and spectral resolution study of genuine bcdgs",
    ", in this paper we present the h@xmath0 scanning fabry - perot interferometric observations of izw18 .",
    "we describe the observations and data reduction in section 2 .",
    "results are presented in section 3 and are discussed in section 4 .",
    "we summarize our conclusions in section 5 .",
    "we shall adopt 10 mpc as the distance to izw18 , based on a recessional velocity of 763  km  @xmath1 and a hubble constant h@xmath3 = 75  km  @xmath1 mpc@xmath2 .",
    "the linear scale is therefore 48 pc arcsec@xmath2 .",
    "observations have been performed at the cassegrain focus of the 3.6 m canada - france - hawaii telescope on november 22 1986 , with the cigale instrument ( boulesteix et al .",
    "it consists of a focal reducer ( f/8 - f/2 ) , and a piezo - electrically scanned fabry - perot interferometer from queensgate instruments interfaced with a two dimensional photon counting camera .",
    "the optical setup of the f/2 focal reducer allows a field of view of 6.2 x 6.2 .",
    "the original photon addresses are computed on a 512 x 512 pixel grid on the detector , giving a scale of 0.725 per pixel .",
    "the fabry - perot etalon operates with an interference order of 798 at the rest wavelength of h@xmath0 providing a free velocity range of 375  km  @xmath1 .",
    "the corresponding free spectral range was scanned through 21 scanning steps ( each step corresponding to a given spacing of the plates of the interferometer ) , the 21th step being equivalent to the 1st one .",
    "thus the velocity sampling step is 18.8  km  @xmath1 .",
    "each scanning step has been exposed 18 x 10s .",
    "the total exposure time was 60 minutes ( 18x10x20s ) .",
    "a neon lamp emitting the 6598.9     line was used for wavelength calibration .",
    "the final product of the 20 elementary interferograms processing is a 3 - dimensional data cube with 2 spatial and one velocity coordinates . for each pixel with",
    "reasonably high s / n ratio the radial velocity , the h@xmath0 line profiles and the h@xmath0 and continuum fluxes are derived from this cube .",
    "the night sky oh emission line at 6577.2    has a wavelength value close to that of the redshifted izw18 h@xmath0 emission .",
    "an interactive routine was used to subtract the night sky line .",
    "the radial velocity at each pixel was then extracted by a barycentric technique ( laval et al .",
    "the barycenter of the h@xmath0 line is found with an accuracy much better than the interferometer scanning",
    " step ( 18.8  km  @xmath1 ) .    from the data cube ,",
    "h@xmath0 line profiles are built for each pixel .",
    "gaussian curves were fitted to the observed profiles to investigate their structure and derive velocity dispersions due to macroscopic gas motions .",
    "the velocity dispersion of the gaussian profile which best fits the observed profile is defined by    @xmath4    where @xmath5 is the thermal broadening function and @xmath6 the instrumental profile . according to the value t@xmath7 = 18000 k of the nebular gas electron temperature of izw18 ( dufour et al .",
    "1988 ) the thermal broadening @xmath5 is estimated as 12.2  km  @xmath1 ( dopita 1972 ) . the instrumental profile determined by scanning the neon 6598.95  line , was found to be well fitted by a gaussian with velocity width @xmath6 = 14.4  km  @xmath1 .",
    "the observed profile is described with @xmath8 = 0.425 fwhm .",
    "the total intensity profile for each pixel when adding up the 21 channels , contains information about the monochromatic emission as well as the continuum emission of the object .",
    "cigale observations enable us to separate monochromatic emission from continuum emission ( see details in laval et al .",
    "it is thus possible to restore pure monochromatic h@xmath0 images of izw18 , completely free from the underlying stellar continuum .",
    "the continuum subtracted h@xmath0 line images of izw18 were calibrated using the absolute flux published by davidson & kinman ( 1985 ) and dh90 . in the same way a continuum map free from h@xmath0 line contribution was built .",
    "the fwhm of the interference filter was 10    which determined the bandwidth of the image continuum of izw18 .",
    "continuum flux calibrations were based on the assumption that the continuum slope of izw18 is given by @xmath9 ( davidson & kinman 1985 ) and on absolute flux values at 6600     given by dkf89 .",
    "in making a continuum model we have neglected the underlying stellar abosrption since according to skillman and kennicutt ( 1993 ) the absorption component in h@xmath0 is of the order of 2  while the h@xmath0 emission has an equivalent width more than two order of magnitude larger ( 465  ) . for the confirmation of faint detected emission ",
    "line features such as small narrow - line hii regions , a careful check was made on the series of channel maps : a feature has been considered as certain only if seen on at least two consecutive channel maps .",
    "h@xmath0 and continuum luminosities are derived from the measured fluxes and are corrected for extinction using values adopted by dufour et al .",
    "( 1988 ) .    since the image of izw18 is sufficiently small to be located in the central part of the field of view",
    "where all the causes for sensitivity variations are reduced ( optical system , filter combination , detector inhomogeneities ) the original images of the galaxy were not flat - fielded .",
    "when the interferometer is scanning the object , the monochromatic emission of this latter is modulated by the interference pattern while the continuum emission remains unaffected .",
    "this enables to distinguish line and continuum emission with a much higher contrast than with simple images obtained through interference filters .",
    "figures 1 and 2 show the logarithmic contour maps of respectively the red continuum emission and the monochromatic h@xmath0 emission in absolute flux units across the main body of izw18 .",
    "the selectivity of the fabry - prot interferometer due to its high finesse ( f=16 measured on calibration frames ) allows a very clear separation of the line and the continuum emissions .",
    "furthermore , the overall system ( fp + focal reducer ) benefits from a very low level of scattered light , much below a percent , which ensures that the continuum map is free from additional line emission .      in red continuum ( fig.1 )",
    "the morphological structure of izw18 is complex and new details appear which were not detected by dkf89 .",
    "some of these details have their counterparts on the hst wfpc2 frames ( ht95 ) . in the main body of the galaxy besides",
    "two known nw and se red continuum components ( dkf89 ) a third one ( a ) is observed half way between them close from the north of the hii region number 6 in ht95 .",
    "we identify two other condensations : ( b ) to the north and ( c ) to the north - west of the nw compact red component . among all the components nw",
    "dominates in size , surface and absolute brightness .",

    "the red continuum radiation extends in more homogeneous way by curving at its end to the west and its patterns closely follow the h@xmath0 arc  like structure dh90 .",
    "stellar light as well as some nebular continuum contribute to the red continuum radiation of the outer envelope of the galaxy and its arc - like structure .",
    "to determine their respective contribution we have measured the l(h@xmath0)/l(6600 ) ratios across these regions and compared the obtained values with model calculations provided to us by mas - hesse ( private communication ) .",
    "models show that the underlying nebular continuum should be less than 1 percent of our measured luminosity at 6600   .",
    "our h@xmath0 monochromatic image ( fig.2 ) completely reproduces the structural features which were identified in earlier observations ( hua et al .",

    "let us underline some details .",
    "we hereafter shall define an autonomous hii feature as the region which is inside its outermost closed contour . both nw and se condensations are isolated from the main body of the galaxy by an isophote corresponding to 4.5 10@xmath26 ergs  @xmath27 arcsec@xmath28 of surface brightness .",

    "these values correspond to h@xmath0 luminosities of 1.6 10@xmath33ergs  @xmath34 and 7.6 10@xmath35ergs  @xmath1 . assuming case b conditions and t@xmath7 = 18000 k ( dufour et al .",
    "1988 ) these luminosities require conversion of 2.2 10@xmath36 and 1.1 10@xmath36 ionizing photons @xmath1 requiring 47 and 23 o5v stars , assuming that an o5v star emits 4.7 10@xmath37 photons @xmath1  ( osterbrock 1989 ) .    star formation rates ( from 0.1 to 100@xmath38 ) in the nw and se component are equal respectively to 4.7 10@xmath39@xmath38yr@xmath2 pc@xmath28 and 2.9 10@xmath39@xmath38yr@xmath2 pc@xmath28 assuming a salpeter initial mass function ( hunter & gallagher 1986 ) .",
    "masses for the ionized gas in the nw and se components have been estimated to be m(hii ) = 7.3 10@xmath40@xmath38 for the nw condensation and m(hii ) = 3.4 10@xmath40@xmath38 for the se one , but these standard estimates are only indicative since these hii regions are far from being homogeneous as seen from the hst images .",
    "the analysis of the mean spatial profiles of both components along the direction of their elongation and perpendicular to it , shows that the surface brightness peak of the nw h@xmath0 component is about 7.0 10@xmath26ergs  @xmath27 arcsec@xmath28 , as compared to 6.4 10@xmath26ergs  @xmath27 arcsec@xmath28 for the se component .",
    "the h@xmath0 surface brightness gradient on the nw component across two perpendicular directions is different .",

    "it is very well seen in fig.1b of m96 and shows its detailed structure in fig .",
    "3 of ht95 .",
    "as regards to the se compact component , its h@xmath0 line brightness distribution is more homogeneous .",
    "an interesting h@xmath0 feature is seen as a prominent winding ridge ( dh90 ; ht95 ; m96 ; ostlin et al .",
    "1996 ) which expands south from the se hii compact component , bends around to the nw , then turns back to the ne , making an half wrapping around the nw hii compact component . in the nw direction from the north - western boundary of the ridge about the same distance as from the nw component",
    "lies zwicky s `` flare '' ( zwicky 1966 ) .",
    "the ridge as an isolated structure is well shaped and has a conspicuous clumpy structure ( ht95 ) . as mentioned above ( sec.3.1 ) several patterns of the ridge radiate some red continuum .",
    "the continuum patterns do not follow the h@xmath0 clumps distribution . to understand the nature of the ridge we carefully tested the possibility of its link to the se compact component .",
    "we conclude that there is not direct connection between them . from this point of view",
    "the ridge can be an isolated feature in the system . as it is noted by viallefond et al .",

    "figure 3 shows the h@xmath0 image of the galaxy with the 6600     red continuum contours overlaid .",
    "one sees that the centroid of the nw h@xmath0 emission is located in the plateau , between the nw and ( b ) red continuum peaks and is displaced to the north of at 1.5 ( 72pc ) from nw red continuum peak . as it was mentioned above ( sec .",

    "forming region is more evident .",
    "the centroid of the se compact h@xmath0 component is displaced by 1.0 ( 48pc ) to the west of the se red continuum centroid .",
    "this displacement between the continuum and h@xmath0 images is also evident from fig.17 of ht95 .",
    "the h@xmath0 emission extends towards the ne and sw directions from the main body of izw18 up to distance of about 1.2 kpc .",
    "the same order of extension is detected by dh90 and m96 . as we stress in sec.3.1 in the same direction but for smaller distances",
    "the clumpy red continuum emission was detected .",
    "the extended envelope detected in h@xmath0 line is not simply diffuse and shows numerous condensations ( dh90 ) .",
    "we suggest that the isolated condensations that have been identified in the extended envelope of izw18 as well as in the ridge are bonafide hii regions .",
    "this suggestion is supported by : + - the presence of clumpy red continuum radiation of stellar origin in the same fields where hii regions were identified .",
    "- the detection of individual stars in the vicinity of the hii regions fields ( table 2 of ht95 ) .",
    "- the existence of nearly 15 well isolated hii regions in the main body of the galaxy also reported by ht95 .",

    "thuan ( 1983 ) detected infrared emission , while hua et al .",
    "( 1987 ) , dfk89 , dh90 from red continuum imagery , confirmed the presence of this component .",
    "the implication is that izw18 may be an older and more complex system .    in the following ,",
    "we make the assumption that h@xmath0 peaks relate to the current star  forming regions while red continuum features correspond to older sites of star formation . from the existence of the h@xmath0 loops and filaments ht95 also suggested the existence of intermitent star formation episodes in the central and northern parts of the galaxy .",
    "their positions are in good agreement with our ( a ) and ( b ) red components .",
    "the distribution of the clumps in the main body of izw18 shows a chain  like structure . out of seven",
    "identified current or more evolved star - forming knots six are distributed along the line se,(a),nw,(b ) .",
    "this chain of star  forming knots is positioned along the direction of elongation of the main body of izw18 and is consistent with hi outer clumps distribution ( lequeux & viallefond 1980 ) . only knot ( c )",
    "is displaced from this linear distribution .    in the chain",
    "both nw and se currently active star  forming regions are located between more evolved star  forming sites .",
    "is this geometry a random configuration ?",
    "does it examplify the sequential nature of star formation events in the galaxy ( gerola et al .",
    "1980 ; kunth et al .",
    "clearly the chain although well ordered spatially does not define any prefered age sequence .",
    "stochastic self - propagating star formation simulations of star formation sites in dwarf galaxies show that the properties of dwarf systems depend on the size ratio of the galaxy to the star formation cells .",
    "small galaxies similar to izw18 evolve mainly via a series of disconnected star forming bursts ( e.g. hunter & gallagher 1985 ) .",
    "therefore , a stochastic origin of the observed `` chain '' is more plausible ( see also ht95 ) .    the ridge discovered by dh90",
    "is thought to represent a radiation - bounded ionization front driven into the main hi cloud .",
    "our red continuum data dispute this claim .",
    "indeed the discovery of some stars in the ridge and surrounding regions ( ht95 ) shows that the ridge contains a stellar population that can ionize the gas `` in situ '' .",
    "therefore the ridge is an isolated structure in the w - sw part of the double - peaked hi gas condensation and has no direct morphological link with the main body of izw18 .",
    "extended h@xmath0 emission have been detected up to distances of 1.5 kpc from the main body of izw18 .",
    "dh90 , who noted the clumpy nature of this extended h@xmath0 emission , suggested that this emission could be powered by the central nw and se star  forming complexes .",
    "m96 using imagery and high dispersion spectroscopy advocate that both north - east and south - west extensions of the outer envelope of the galaxy could be superbubbles powered by star  forming complexes . however the existence of clumpy red continuum emission of stellar origin coeval with the extended h@xmath0 emission , as well as the number of stars which were discovered in the same regions ( ht95 ) consisting into compact and well individualized clumpy structure allow us to suggest that a stellar population is embedded into the ionized gas",
    ". therefore part of the young stars from this population can ionize and produce the observed extended hii emission . as noted in sec.3.3 ,",
    "the diameters distribution and a tentative h@xmath0 luminosity function of these hii regions are consistent with those of normal hii regions in dwarf irregular galaxies .",
    "the existence of the stellar and hii regions populations in ne and sw extensions of the outer envelope of izw18 does not preclude the contribution of some superbubbles in the same regions .",
    "as previously suggested , star formation in the main body of izw18 possibly occurs via a series of disconnected bursts as a result of density fluctuations in the interstellar medium near the hi clouds .",
    "what is the mechanism which triggers the subsequent star formation ?",
    "the velocity field in an hii galaxy as well as in its surrounding hi cloud may indeed play an important role ( saito et al .",
    "1992 ; tomita et al .",
    "1993 ) .",
    "the velocity gradient observed along the main star  forming regions , both in h@xmath0 ( our results in sec.3.4 ) and in hi ( from the maps of viallefond et al .",
    "1987 ) is equal to about 70  km  @xmath68 .",
    "the same gradient across the offseted hi peak distribution is only 50  km  @xmath68 ( viallefond et al .",
    "it means that local hii as well as hi gas in the region of the optical galaxy rotates faster than the hi gas at its peak distribution .",
    "the ordered component of the izw18 velocity field shows a peak orbital velocity of about 50  km  @xmath1 .",
    "most irregular galaxies ( giants as well as dwarfs ) , exhibit a solid body rotation with about the same peak orbital velocities of 5070  km  @xmath1 but with shallow velocity gradients of 520  km  @xmath68 over the optically visible region ( hopp & schulte - ladbeck 1991 ; shostak & skillman 1989 ; gallagher & hunter 1984 and literature therein ) .",
    "the much higher velocity gradient in izw18 arises from its much smaller linear scale , when compared to normal irregulars .",
    "the disordered motions superimposed over the regular velocity field of izw18 appear as sharp velocity jumps of 10 to 20  km  @xmath1 occuring on scales of about 500 pc@xmath69 . these appear related to the main body of the galaxy , and suggest that the gas is not in equilibrum locally .",
    "corresponding dynamical timescales could be of the order of few 10@xmath70years ( ht95 ) .",
    "the gravitational effects of the ( b ) and",
    "( c ) star ",
    "forming centers as well as explosive star  forming events may explain these local disturbances .",
    "as regards to h@xmath0 line profiles , the discrepancy between a single gaussian component with velocity dispersion of 23  km  @xmath1 ( e - folding width : 33  km  @xmath1 ) observed in a 40 arcsec and 21 arcsec apertures by arsenault & roy ( 1986 ) and the complex line structure seen at our resolution of 0.725 per pixel is not a surprise .",
    "gaussian - like smooth profiles obtained by arsenault & roy ( 1986 ) result from integration over many distinct components with different space velocities and emissivities . as examples we can recall high resolution observations of ngc604 by rosa & solf ( 1984 ) , hippelein & fried ( 1984 ) in comparison with results for ngc604 presented by arsenault & roy ( 1986 ) and also the very interesting case of the giant hii region ngc2363 ( arsenault & roy 1986 ; roy et al . 1991 ; roy et al .",
    "1992 ) .",
    "the single gaussian component observed in the nw compact hii region may suggest a self- gravitating system ( terlevich & melnick 1981 ) . in this case the expected velocity dispersion ( melnick et al .",
    "1988 ) is about twice smaller than the observed one .",
    "this difference can be caused either by the gravity of the nearby located recent star  forming nw and ( b ) regions or / and the effects of turbulence .",
    "the chaotic morphology of the ionized gas in the component ( ht95 ) as well as the existence of high velocity gas expanding shell ( m96 ) may favor the latter effects .",
    "application of gravitation - turbulence model in this case would be more reliable ( arsenault & roy 1988 ) .    in the se compact hii region",
    "the velocity dispersion for the main gaussian component ( about 19  km  @xmath1 ) is also higher than expected from a self - gravitational model ( terlevich & melnick 1981 ) .",
    "such an excess velocity dispersion can also be caused by the peculiar motions of several stellar clusters observed in the core of this component ( ht95 ) .",
    "the weaker second gaussian component may be produced by another isolated hii region in the se area , undistinguishable because of projection effects .",
    "the ridge which has no direct morphological connection with the main body of izw18 broadly follows the velocity field structure of the hi peak .",
    "the ridge is therefore co - rotating with the hi cloud and the main body of izw18 .",
    "the ridge as an isolated configuration is probably not in equilibrium .",
    "it expands in an opposite direction with respect to the hi gas showing local well determined infall and/or outfall of ionized gas .",
    "the geometry as well as the velocity field of the ridge are consistent with the `` blister '' interpretation .",
    "the complex structure of the h@xmath0 line profiles observed in the envelope showing a variable position - dependent asymmetry ( blue and/or red wings ) suggests that we are observing gas infall onto the main body of the galaxy , whatever the direction of observation and/or local ionization fronts .",
    "the blue asymmetric components are much more prominent on the eastern side , opposite to the major hi concentrations",
    ". it may be evidence that infall of gas clouds fuels the overall star formation in izw18 .",
    "but we do not exclude the possibility that the arc - like structure of the ridge can be affected by a tidal interaction between izw18 and the zwicky s `` flare '' .      from our data and data from the literature",

    "the large velocity gradient together with the locally complex velocity field ( including peculiar gas motions responsible for the line profile asymetries ) are most probably responsible for the star formation itself .    from the existence of recent star  forming regions seen in continuum , with no exact spatial coincidence with hii regions",

    "<S> we present high spatial resolution observations of the blue compact dwarf galaxy izw18 performed in the h@xmath0 line with a scanning fabry - perot interferometer at the cfh telescope . </S>",
    "<S> morphological structure of the galaxy in h@xmath0 and in the red continuum is investigated . </S>",
    "<S> we also analyse the velocity field of the ionized gas . besides the two compact hii components of the main body we find a population of small hii regions in its surroundings whose diameter distribution and h@xmath0 luminosity function are consistent with those observed in dwarf irregular galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> in the main body of the galaxy besides of the nw and se red continuum peaks which are displaced with respect to the h@xmath0 maxima , three new red condensations have been discovered . </S>",
    "<S> they have no clear h@xmath0 counterparts . the velocity field in izw18 </S>",
    "<S> shows peculiar motions superimposed on a quite regular background implying solid - body rotation with a gradient of about 70  km  @xmath1 kpc@xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> the h@xmath0 line profiles exhibit an asymmetric structure , except for the nw main compact component . </S>",
    "<S> at least part of this asymmetry could result from accreted and/or expelled surrounding gas from the main star - forming core(s ) of the galaxy . </S>",
    "<S> contrary to previous suggestions that the south - west and north - east extensions of this galaxy are diffused emission produced by bipolar emitting gas we provide evidence that they are hii regions powered by star formation sites . </S>",
    "<S> the redshift of the zwicky s `` flare '' has been measured for the first time and corresponds to the same velocity as izw18 . </S>",
    "<S> in such a context the optical ridge that appears to be an isolated morphological structure has a shape that may result from the gravitational interaction with the zwicky s `` flare '' if this latter is a neighbour extreme dwarf object . </S>"
