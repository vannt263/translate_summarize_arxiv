    "in the forties , von neumann proposed a discrete model of computation where finite - state machines arranged in a grid , locally process information in discrete time - steps @xcite .",
    "von neumann s motivation to introduce cellular automata was to obtain a complex behaviour from an array of simple processing units .",
    "later , feynman suggested applying the laws of quantum mechanics to computation @xcite .",
    "this idea naturally led to the formalisation of quantum computation @xcite in general and quantum cellular automata ( qca ) in particular @xcite . in parallel to qca , other models of quantum computation have been developed like circuit - based quantum computation @xcite , measurement - based quantum computation @xcite , or adiabatic quantum computation @xcite .    around the same time , conceptual links between physics and computer science were examined .",
    "a famous example is the relation between logical reversibility and physical reversibility investigated by landauer @xcite and culminating with the development of reversible computation @xcite .",
    "a more recent instance , motivated by the believe that spacetime should ultimately be discrete , concerns the emergence of ( continuous ) dynamical laws of physics from ( discrete ) computation .",
    "this question was first discussed by suze @xcite and later by weehler @xcite .",
    "the first significant step towards emergent physical laws came from bialynicki - birula who considered a two - dimensional qca on a body - centred cubic lattice @xcite .",
    "bialynicki - birula showed that the dynamic of any such homogenous , linear , and unitary qca necessarily reduces to the weyl equation in the limit of small wave vectors and continuous time .",
    "he also showed that the simple cubic lattice admits no homogenous , linear , and unitary qca . in passing ,",
    "bialynicki - birula proposed a four - dimensional qca that reduces to the dirac equation in the limit of small wave vectors and continuous time .",
    "a couple of years latter , meyer showed that there is no nontrivial homogeneous , local and unitary one - dimensional cellular automaton on a unidimensional lattice @xcite , a result later generalised to higher dimensions in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "recently , dariano _ et al .",
    "_ extended bialynicki - birula s and meyer s no - go results to the rhombohedral lattice .",
    "in addition , they showed that there are not one but two homogeneous , local , linear , isotropic , and unitary qca for the body - centred cubic lattice , up to unitary conjugation @xcite .",
    "however , the derivation is rather lengthy and technical . in the present paper ,",
    "we provide a short and simple derivation of these two unitarily - inequivalent automata .",
    "our derivation uses the notion of gram matrix and emphasises the relation between the transition matrices that describe the unitary evolution of the automata and the body - centred cubic lattice : the transition matrices essentially are the matrix representation of the vertices of the lattice s primitive cell , here a central vertex surrounded by a tetrahedron and its dual .",
    "although we only consider the body - centred cubic lattice in this paper , our technique can directly be used for all bravais lattices .",
    "let us add here that the klein - gordon equation @xcite , maxwell s equations @xcite , lorentz invariance @xcite and curved spacetime @xcite have also been investigated in the framework of qca .",
    "this paper is organised as follows . in section",
    "ii , we recall the general framework to discuss qca on an abstract lattice as established in @xcite . in section iii ,",
    "we focus our attention on two - dimensional homogenous , local , isotropic , and unitary automata on a body - centred cubic lattice and derive the only two unitarity - inequivalent solutions .",
    "this short and simple derivation is the main result of our paper .",
    "we briefly examine the four - dimensional case in section iv and find two one - parameter families of automata without completely solving the case .",
    "these automata reduce to the dirac equation in a suitable limit .",
    "we conclude in section v.",
    "we follow the general framework developed in @xcite to describe a homogenous , local , isotropic , and unitary automaton on an abstract lattice .",
    "a qca is defined as a numerable set @xmath0 of identical cells whose states change in identical discrete time - steps .",
    "we will later restrict the abstract set @xmath0 to the abelian group of translations in a three - dimensional body - centred cubic lattice .",
    "the assumption that the cells and the time - steps are all identical represents our homogeneity assumption .",
    "next , we define the finite set @xmath1 of neighbouring cells of a given cell @xmath2 and we assume the deterministic evolution of the automaton to be local , that is , each cell @xmath2 only interacts with a finite number @xmath3 of neighbouring cells within a single step of computation .",
    "we now have a qca on a graph @xmath4 with vertex set @xmath5 and edge set @xmath6 where a fermionic state @xmath7 is associated to each vertex and a transition function @xmath8 is associated to each directed edge @xmath9 .",
    "furthermore , the homogeneity assumption means that all vertices are identical so that ( 1 ) the transition matrices @xmath8 are independent of the vertex @xmath2 and ( 2 ) each cell has the same number of neighbouring cells , that is , @xmath3 is independent of @xmath2 . we are led to introduce a multiplication law for the elements of @xmath0 and define a subset @xmath10 such that @xmath11 for every neighbour @xmath12 of @xmath2 .",
    "it follows that @xmath13 , explicitly treating all neighbouring sets on equal footing .",
    "we also assume @xmath0 to be closed under multiplication so that @xmath0 forms a group finitely generated by @xmath10 . the subset @xmath10 is often called the generating set of the group @xmath0 in the framework of cayley graphs @xcite . by construction",
    "the inverse element @xmath14 of @xmath15 must necessarily be in @xmath10 as the consideration of a primitive cell centred on @xmath12 immediately reveals . in the following",
    "it will be useful to write @xmath16 , where @xmath17 denotes the set containing the inverse elements of @xmath18 .",
    "note that this decomposition is not unique . in this paper",
    "we only consider the case of a body - centred cubic system , where the set @xmath18 contains the vertices of a regular tetrahedron and @xmath17 contains the vertices of the corresponding dual tetrahedron ( see fig .",
    "( [ fig : tetra ] ) ) .",
    "third , we assume the cellular automaton to be linear .",
    "physically , it means that no interaction between fermionic fields is allowed and we focus on the dynamics of a single , therefore free , fermionic field .",
    "in fact , the term quantum cellular automata is often reserved for the dynamics of interacting fields while quantum ( random ) walks ( qw ) is used for the dynamics of a single field @xcite .",
    "as our general framework started with an abstract qca , we will keep using the term qca throughout this article , although we ultimately examine a single field . as",
    "often with qw @xcite , we now define the hilbert space @xmath19 where the space @xmath20 is used to describe the position of the field while the space @xmath21 is used to describe the internal state of the field . with this decomposition of the hilbert space @xmath22 , we have @xmath23 , where we restrict the ket notation to the position and internal state spaces . since we are interested in two - dimensional automata , we simply choose @xmath24 .",
    "linearity means that the state @xmath7 at vertex @xmath2 is the linear combination of the linearly transformed states of its neighbouring vertices and itself , at the preceding time - step .",
    "therefore , the discrete - time evolution of the state @xmath25 at vertex @xmath2 from step @xmath26 to step @xmath27 with transition matrices @xmath8 can be written as @xmath28 where @xmath29 represents the transition matrix at the centre of the cell . using the definition of the generating set @xmath10 ,",
    "this evolution becomes @xmath30    finally , the above local evolution can be rewritten using the hilbert space structure @xmath31 .",
    "now , we simply denote the transition matrices @xmath32 as @xmath33 , the neutral element of @xmath0 as @xmath34 , and we introduce the shift operator @xmath35 in the right regular representation that shifts a vertex @xmath36 to the vertex @xmath37 .",
    "it follows that the neighbouring vertex @xmath11 is shifted by @xmath35 to the central vertex @xmath2 .",
    "we finally obtain the evolution operator @xmath38 such that @xmath39 , @xmath40 in @xmath41 , as @xmath42 such an operator is often called the walk operator while the operator @xmath43 is often taken to be zero . in this paper , we do not assume @xmath43 to vanish .",
    "next , we demand the automaton to be isotropic , that is , all the directions on the lattice are equivalent .",
    "the corresponding mathematical definition is not trivial .",
    "we require the existence of a finite subgroup @xmath44 of the automorphism group @xmath45 of @xmath0 , transitive over @xmath18 , and a unitary representation @xmath46 of @xmath44 such that , for all @xmath47 in @xmath44 , @xmath48 where we include both @xmath10 and the neutral element @xmath34 in the definition of the set @xmath49 and where @xmath50 denotes the new vertex after action of @xmath47 on @xmath15 .",
    "importantly , the above covariance of the automaton @xmath38 implies the invariance under conjugation of the two set of transition matrices @xmath51 and @xmath52 , that is , @xmath53 for all @xmath15 in @xmath18 and @xmath14 in @xmath17 .",
    "indeed , the choice of a regular representation implies that the @xmath35 s are linearly independent in the sense that if the action of a finite linear combination of the @xmath35 s on any site @xmath54 of @xmath55 vanishes , then each coefficient in the linear combination must vanish .",
    "consequently , the equality in eq .",
    "( [ iso ] ) must hold term by term in the finite sum over @xmath49 . due to the transitivity of @xmath44 over @xmath18 ,",
    "the two subsets @xmath56 remain unchanged under the action of the isotropic group @xmath44 and we end up with eq.([iso2 ] ) .",
    "it also follows that the transition matrix @xmath57 at the centre of the cell must be invariant under conjugation .",
    "if the unitary representation @xmath46 of @xmath44 is irreducible , then schur s lemma ensures that @xmath57 is proportional to the identity matrix or zero .",
    "let us emphasise here that isotropy as defined in eq .",
    "( [ iso ] ) is a very strong constraint indeed .",
    "although the isotropy group @xmath44 will not be _ a priori _ specified , covariance will be instrumental in characterising the qca .",
    "once the solutions are known , it will be possible to find their symmetries and therefore to identify the isotropy group @xmath44 and its unitary representation @xmath46 .",
    "so far , the construction holds for any countable group @xmath0 finitely generated by a subset @xmath10 .",
    "we now fix @xmath0 to be the abelian group of translations in the three - dimensional body - centred cubic lattice .",
    "this choice of group represents our discrete three - dimensional lattice .",
    "mathematically , the choice of an abelian group is convenient as it allows to work in the fourier space , also called the reciprocal lattice in crystallography .",
    "the irreducible representations of an abelian group are one - dimensional and unitary .",
    "thus , we can now label the group elements of @xmath0 as integer vectors in @xmath58 , denoted in bold letters , and use the sum notation for the commutative group law so that @xmath59 the periodicity of the lattice allows us to define the ( continuous ) fourier - transformed basis @xmath60 of the ( discrete ) basis @xmath61 as @xmath62 denotes the volume of the first brillouin zone @xmath63 of the body - centred cubic lattice .",
    "this first brillouin zone takes the shape of a rhombic dodecahedron that comprises all wave vectors @xmath64 such that in cartesian coordinates @xmath65 , @xmath66 , and @xmath67 @xcite .",
    "importantly , the shift operators @xmath68 are diagonal in the fourier basis , that is , @xmath69 so that the unitary automaton takes the form @xmath70 the final form of a homogenous , local , isotropic , and unitary automaton on a body - centred cubic lattice then is @xmath71 where the operator @xmath72 is unitary for all wave vectors in the first brillouin zone and the set of transition matrices @xmath73 , @xmath74 in @xmath18 , the set of transition matrices @xmath75 , and @xmath57 are invariant under conjugation for some group of unitaries .",
    "interestingly , the unitary property of the automata @xmath38 further implies that the transition matrices must satisfy the conditions @xmath76 indeed , since the operators @xmath68 are unitary , eq .  ( [ equation ] ) implies that @xmath77 where each term in the second sum has to vanish due to the linear independence of the operators @xmath78 .",
    "similarly , the condition @xmath79 immediately reads @xmath80    homogenous , linear , local , isotropic , and unitary automata have another interesting property . indeed ,",
    "for any homogenous , linear , and local automaton , we have @xmath81 where @xmath82 . in dimension @xmath83 , the operator @xmath84 is a dxd unitary transformation that is specified by @xmath85 real parameters .",
    "therefore , the above equation defines a @xmath85-parameter family of automata constructed from an automaton @xmath38 such that @xmath86 and multiplied by a transformation of the form @xmath87 . if , furthermore , the automaton is isotropic , then the operator @xmath88 is invariant under the unitary conjugation of the isotropy group @xmath44 .",
    "it follows that if the representation of @xmath44 is irreducible , then , by schur s lemma , @xmath89 must be zero or a multiple of the identity .",
    "if the automaton is also unitary , it can not vanish and the multiplicative constant must be a phase such that @xmath90 reduces to the identity operator up to a physically - irrelevant phase . therefore , if the isotropy group @xmath44 has an irreducible representation in two dimensions , the four - parameter family of qca reduces to a single qca . here",
    "we see again how strong the isotropy constraint is . in the following",
    ", we do assume an automaton fulfilling the property @xmath91 .",
    "in other words , we impose the constraint @xmath92 physically , this assumption is rather intuitive : if all directions are equivalent , it seems natural to require that the state of a vertex remains unchanged when the wave vector of the field is zero .",
    "this represents our first constraint . in the following",
    ", we will introduce three additional constraints coming from the unitary constraint .",
    "these four constraints will be enough to determine fully the searched automata .",
    "we now start with the novelty of this article : a short and simple derivation of the weyl automata .",
    "we call a homogenous , local , isotropic , and unitary automaton , a weyl automaton as we already know that such an automaton necessarily reduces to the weyl equation in the limit of small wave vectors and continuous time @xcite . to find such automata , we will examine the unitarity of the operator @xmath93 defined in eq .",
    "( [ ak ] ) . but",
    "first , let us introduce two relevant gram matrices .",
    "the operator @xmath93 can be written as @xmath94 with @xmath95 and where the eight vectors @xmath96 and @xmath97 , @xmath98 , correspond to the vertices of the regular tetrahedron @xmath18 and its dual @xmath17 .",
    "note that we now enumerate the vectors @xmath99 as @xmath100 and transition matrices @xmath101 as @xmath102 to simplify the notations .",
    "the non - normalised vectors of these two tetrahedra are defined in some orthonormal basis as @xmath103 and @xmath104 our task is to find the nine 2x2 transition matrices @xmath105 and @xmath57 in a simple and insightful manner .",
    "we recall here that the gram matrix of a collection of @xmath106 real vectors @xmath107 is defined by the nxn symmetric matrix @xmath108 such that @xmath109 , with the usual definition of the dot product . in our case ,",
    "the relevant vectors are complex , so we will define two gram matrices denoted by @xmath110 and @xmath111 as follows @xmath112 note that only @xmath111 is positive semi - definite as the simple dot product in the definition of @xmath110 does not correspond to an inner product . furthermore , for a set of four vectors , we can define a 3x4 matrix @xmath113 whose columns are the vectors @xmath114s so that the two gram matrices defined above take the simple form @xmath115 and @xmath116 , where @xmath26 denotes transposition while @xmath117 denotes hermitian conjugation .    the regular tetrahedron defined in eq .",
    "( [ tetra ] ) can be fully characterised in a coordinate - free manner by the relation @xmath118 where @xmath119 is the kronecker delta .",
    "interestingly , these relations can be grouped in the gram matrix @xmath120 where @xmath121 is the matrix containing the four vectors of the non - normalised tetrahedron . finally , the four vectors of the regular tetrahedron in three - dimensional space verifies the simple linear - dependence relation @xmath122 . in other words ,",
    "the sum of all the terms in any row of the gram matrix @xmath108 vanishes .",
    "the unitary constraint @xmath123 is a sum of eighty one terms of the form @xmath124 , @xmath125 , @xmath126 , and @xmath127 .",
    "these terms can be grouped depending on their relative phase as given in eq .",
    "( [ unitary2 ] ) and each group must vanish . among these groups , three will suffice to characterise the automaton . more specifically ,",
    "we choose the three groups with relative phases @xmath128 , @xmath129 , and @xmath130 , respectively .",
    "therefore , we end up with the three constraints @xmath131 and similarly for @xmath132 , @xmath133    together with the constraint @xmath134 of eq .",
    "( [ i d ] ) repeated here for convenience @xmath135 we now have a total of four constraints that we can start exploiting to find the weyl automata .      we express the 2x2 complex matrices @xmath57 and @xmath105 in terms of the three pauli matrices @xmath136 , @xmath137 , and @xmath138 defined as @xmath139 together with the identity matrix @xmath140 .",
    "we will see that in the case of an isotropic automaton the transition matrices @xmath105 can be written as @xmath141 where @xmath142 and @xmath143 and @xmath144 are two complex numbers different from zero . in other words , the transition matrices",
    "@xmath105 have non vanishing traces and are such that @xmath145 .",
    "the immediate consequence is that we only need to focus on the four complex vectors @xmath146 as well as the two complex factors @xmath143 and @xmath144 to solve our problem .",
    "let us now prove these claims .",
    "the two 2x2 complex matrix @xmath147 and @xmath148 can always be written as @xmath149 with @xmath150 , @xmath151 .",
    "the two constraints @xmath152 and @xmath153 of eqs .",
    "( [ c1a ] ) and ( [ c1b ] ) yield the three conditions @xmath154 there are three possible cases for the above system : first , none of the two matrices @xmath147 and @xmath155 has a trace equal to zero .",
    "second , only one matrix has a trace equal to zero .",
    "third , both matrices have a trace equal to zero . in the first case , upon rescaling the complex vectors @xmath156 and @xmath157 and using a conventional factor @xmath158 , the two matrices @xmath102 and @xmath159 take the simple form given in eqs .",
    "( [ form ] ) and ( [ a1 ] ) . of course",
    ", the coefficient @xmath143 ( @xmath144 ) must be the same for all transition matrices @xmath102 ( @xmath159 ) since they are unitarily conjugated under the action of the isotropy group and , therefore , their traces must be equal . given the four complex vectors @xmath146 , we define the two gram matrices @xmath110 and @xmath111 as @xmath160 and @xmath161 , respectively .",
    "the full characterisation of these two gram matrices will specify the four vectors @xmath146 , up to rotations .",

    ", our isotropic automaton is such that for all @xmath168 , @xmath169 where @xmath170 is a positive number : all the diagonal entries of the gram matrix @xmath111 must be equal to @xmath170 .    in the second case",
    ", it immediately follows that the matrix with vanishing trace must completely vanish .",
    "let us say that this vanishing matrix is @xmath159 .",

    "this completes the derivation of the homogenous , local , isotropic , and unitary two - dimensional automaton .",
    "we have found two unitarily - inequivalent automata @xmath247 and @xmath244 , constructed from the four vectors @xmath100 of the regular tetrahedron with a multiplicative phase @xmath248 in front of one of their three components . since the transition matrices are of the form @xmath249 where the vectors @xmath146 essentially are the vectors @xmath100 , we say that the transition matrices @xmath105 essentially are the matrix representation of the vertices of the lattice s primitive cell . finally , let us remember that we assumed the existence of an irreducible representation of the isotropy group in two dimensions .",
    "this isotropy group @xmath44 turns out to be the group of rotations of angle @xmath250 around the three coordinate axes , a rather simple group whose unitary irreducible representation @xmath46 in two dimensions is @xmath251 .",
    "as proven in @xcite , the found automata should reduce to the weyl equation in the limit of small wave vectors @xmath64 and continuous time .",
    "we can quickly verify it here .",

    "( [ sol1])-([sol3 ] ) .",
    "then , a direct calculation shows that the two unitary - inequivalent automata @xmath243 and @xmath244 reduce to @xmath255 if , instead , one chooses @xmath245 together with the four vectors @xmath146 of any @xmath256 , we would obtain the above equation for the wave vector @xmath257 and rotated by an element of the isotropy group . finally , to obtain the continuum limit of our automata",

    "we then identify @xmath263 with the hamiltonian @xmath264 of the unitary transformation @xmath265 for the continuous time evolution @xmath266 .",

    "therefore , in the limit of small wave vector and continuous time , the two homogenous , local , isotropic , and unitary two - dimensional automata @xmath243 and @xmath244 reduce to the weyl equation in momentum space @xmath268",
    "with the two - dimensional case completed , we briefly turn our attention to the four - dimensional case .",
    "four - dimensional homogenous , local , isotropic , and unitary automata on a three - dimensional lattice have been investigated in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "starting from a special form of four - dimensional automata , two families were found , both of them reducing to the dirac equation in a suitable limit . in this paper",
    ", we use a different starting point but end up with the same two families of , so called , dirac automata .    given the large dimension of the space where the solutions are to be found ( i.e.  sixteen real dimensions ) , we only consider a special class of automata . in the two - dimensional case , we discovered that the transition matrices @xmath105 can essentially be thought as the matrix representation of the vertices of the lattice s primitive cell .",
    "therefore , we keep the same structure but now use a four - dimensional representation of the pauli algebra to find solution automata in the four - dimensional case . such a representation can be achieved with the help of the four four - dimensional gamma matrices : we simply replace the two - dimensional pauli matrices @xmath269 by the product @xmath270 , where the four gamma matrices in the weyl representation are defined as @xmath271 importantly , we also have @xmath272 such that our two - dimensional automata @xmath234 given in eq .",
    "( [ automaton ] ) can be directly written in four dimensions . in the following ,",
    "we denote all relevant four - dimensional matrices with a @xmath113 instead of an @xmath38 . in other words ,",
    "we now consider the matrices @xmath273 , @xmath274 , and @xmath275 instead of @xmath276 , @xmath105 , and @xmath57 .",
    "we write @xmath277    we choose to keep the four vectors @xmath278 and @xmath233 from the two - dimensional results .",
    "however , @xmath143 , @xmath144 , and @xmath275 are no longer known .",
    "these choices define a special class of automata , so that there may exist more general solutions than those we are about to find .",
    "it is convenient to multiply the transition matrices @xmath275 and @xmath279 on the left by the full - rank matrix @xmath280 .",
    "this will simplify our calculations .",
    "we now have @xmath281 with @xmath282 and @xmath283 .",
    "interestingly , we see that @xmath284 since @xmath285 while @xmath286 and @xmath287 .",
    "second , the transition matrix @xmath288 must satisfy the constraint @xmath208 , so that we have @xmath289    an obvious solution to this system is @xmath290 together with @xmath291 where @xmath292 is a real number . to find @xmath143 and @xmath144",
    ", we use the unitary constraint @xmath293 that must be valid for all wave vectors @xmath64 .",
    "when the wave vector @xmath64 vanishes , we find @xmath294 .",
    "when we choose @xmath295 , we obtain @xmath296 .",
    "it immediately follows that @xmath297 , where @xmath298 is a real number such that @xmath299 .",
    "therefore , we obtain the automata @xmath300 where @xmath301 , @xmath302 , @xmath303 and @xmath298 is a real parameter .",
    "note that we now use @xmath143 to denote @xmath304 , instead of @xmath305 as @xmath298 appears explicitly in eq .",
    "( [ bob ] ) . upon re - multiplying @xmath306 by @xmath280 on the left",
    ", these automata finally take the form @xmath307 in fact , one can go from an automata with parameter @xmath308 to another with parameter @xmath309 by conjugation with the unitary transformation @xmath310 that anti - commutes with all four gamma matrices .",
    "furthermore , the automaton @xmath311 is defined up to a physically - irrelevant global phase , so that we can always choose @xmath298 to be positive .",
    "therefore , we can restrict ourselves to automata of the form @xmath312 where @xmath298 is positive .",
    "as in the two - dimensional case , these automata can have two different spectra depending on the choice @xmath303 in the definition of @xmath313 , leading us to two unitarily - inequivalent one - parameter families of automata . indeed , the spectra of the automata in eq .",
    "( [ solfin ] ) are @xmath314 , each eigenvalues with multiplicity two , where @xmath315 here again , the @xmath241 sign corresponds to the choice @xmath303 .",
    "finally , a convenient choice for the two one - parameter families of automata is @xmath316 and @xmath317 where the automaton @xmath276 is defined with @xmath245 together with the four vectors @xmath146 of any @xmath254 . in conclusion ,",
    "we have found two unitary - inequivalent one - parameter families of four - dimensional homogenous , local , isotropic , and unitary automata . for small wave vectors @xmath64 and large parameter @xmath318 , or equivalently a small positive parameter @xmath319",
    ", these two automata reduce to @xmath320 in the limit of continuous time , we obtain the dirac equation in momentum space @xmath321 where it is tempting to interpret retrospectively the small positive parameter @xmath292 as the mass of the free field @xmath322 in @xmath323 .",
    "in this paper , we have provided a simple derivation of the two - dimensional homogenous , local , isotropic , and unitary automata on a body - centred cubic lattice , using the notion of gram matrix .",
    "our derivation emphasises the link between the automata and the underlying lattice .",
    "indeed , the transition matrices that characterise the qca essentially are the matrix representation of the vertices of the lattice s primitive cell .",
    "we have also proven that the transition matrix at the centre of the body - centred cubic cell must be zero .",

    "we have also briefly examined the four - dimensional case to find two unitarily - inequivalent one - parameter families of automata that both reduce to the dirac equation in the limit of continuous time , small wave vectors , and small positive parameter @xmath292 .",
