    "the dynamics need to be treated as nonsmooth , allowing discontinuous velocities of rigid bodies undergoing impacts or frictional stick - slip transitions and instantaneous propagation of impulses through the system .",

    "many solutions exist for elastoplastic solids coupled with tire models @xcite but scarcely with more complex multibody systems and not for realtime or faster simulation .    the main contribution in this paper , illustrated in figure [ fig : illustration ] , is a formulation and numerical method for simulation of elastoplastic solids as a nonsmooth multidomain multibody system on descriptor form @xcite .",

    "<S> a method for simulation of elastoplastic solids in multibody systems with nonsmooth and multidomain dynamics is developed . </S>",
    "<S> the solid is discretised into pseudo - particles using the meshfree moving least squares method . </S>",
    "<S> the particles carry strain and stress tensor variables that are mapped to deformation constraints and constraint forces . </S>",
    "<S> the discretised solid model thus fit a unified framework for nonsmooth multidomain dynamics for realtime simulations including strong coupling of rigid multibodies with complex kinematic constraints such as articulation joints , unilateral contacts with dry friction , drivelines and hydraulics . </S>",
    "<S> the nonsmooth formulation allow for impulses , due to impacts for instance , to propagate instantly between the rigid multibody and the solid . </S>",
    "<S> plasticity is introduced through an associative perfectly plastic modified drucker - prager model . </S>",
    "<S> the elastic and plastic dynamics is verified for simple test systems and the capability of simulating tracked terrain vehicles driving on a deformable terrain is demonstrated . </S>"
