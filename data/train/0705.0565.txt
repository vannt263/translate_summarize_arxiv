    "constituent quark models are known to reproduce the observed low - energy features of baryons .",
    "the number of ground state baryons corresponds to the observed one .",
    "the masses and magnetic moments of the flavor - octet and decuplet baryons are also reproduced well .",
    "the picture that the baryon mass comes mainly from the masses of the three constituent quarks , which interact with each other by exchanging gluons and/or goldstone bosons , seems appropriate@xcite .",
    "there , however , are some exceptions .",
    "one of these is that such models can not give the observed light mass of @xmath8 nor the large mass difference between @xmath9 and @xmath10 . in the conventional constituent quark model , each of these baryons",
    "is treated as a system of three quarks in the flavor - singlet @xmath3 state @xcite .",
    "then , the hyperfine interaction only gives a part ( @xmath11 150 mev ) of the observed mass difference between the flavor - singlet and the flavor - octet spin-@xmath6 baryons , @xmath11 200 mev .",
    "moreover , in order to give the large mass difference between @xmath8 and @xmath12 , one has to assume a strong spin - orbit force between quarks , which is absent in other negative - parity baryons .",
    "the excited baryons are embedded in the baryon - meson scattering states .",
    "therefore it is most appropriate to investigate @xmath8 as a meson - baryon resonance . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the idea that @xmath0(1405 ) is a n@xmath7 bound state has been presented .",
    "a more systematic treatment may be found in the chiral unitary approach , where the lowest order baryon - meson vertices of the nonlinear chiral lagrangian are employed as the baryon - meson interaction @xcite .",
    "because the model lagrangian is an flavor - su(3 ) extended version , this interaction is flavor - flavor type ; the relative strength of the potentials among the su(3 ) octet baryons and mesons is governed by the su(3 ) relation .",
    "the interaction is very short - ranged and strongly attractive in both of the @xmath13 and n@xmath7 @xmath14 channels .",
    "furthermore , it is easily seen that this flavor - flavor type interaction gives the strongest attraction for the flavor - singlet state among the baryon - meson system .",
    "this is essentially the origin to produce the @xmath0(1405 ) resonance in this scheme .",
    "there are also some attempts to express this baryon - meson picture by using quark models . to treat the negative - parity baryons as q@xmath15 systems",
    "was proposed in ref.@xcite .",
    "this idea , however , has been abandoned because it was found by the q@xmath15 @xmath16 calculations that some of the other flavor - octet negative - parity baryons are also found to have light mass .",
    "there is a report to examine the n@xmath7 scattering from a quark model @xcite .",
    "recent progress in the calculation method for few - body systems allows us to solve a q@xmath15 system by taking the orbital correlation fully into account .",
    "then , it is found that the one - gluon exchange potential ( oge ) @xcite , which is strongly attractive in the @xmath13 channel , causes a bound state below the @xmath13 threshold in this @xmath14 channel @xcite .",
    "since there is no strong attraction from color - magnetic interaction ( cmi ) in the n@xmath5 channel , it seems unlikely to have a resonance close to but below the n@xmath7 threshold in this approach .",
    "to explain @xmath0(1405 ) by the baryon - meson picture directly using the quark models does not seem to work so far .",
    "an example to combine the above two pictures , viz .",
    ", the q@xmath1 picture and the baryon - meson one , is found in ref .",
    "@xcite , where the meson - cloud effects on the flavor - singlet q@xmath1 baryons were investigated .",
    "it was reported that the self - energy of the q@xmath1 state makes the baryon mass considerably lower .",
    "it seems necessary to introduce such a q@xmath1 state , in addition to the baryon - meson state , for the constituent quark models to express the negative - parity baryons . in this paper , in order to clarify the above situation of @xmath0(1405 ) , we perform the dynamical calculations of the q@xmath1-q@xmath2 scattering systems with a flavor - singlet q@xmath17 state as an embedded pole in the continuum , which we call ` the @xmath4 pole ' in the following . for this purpose",
    ", we employ the quark cluster model ( qcm ) , which has succeeded in describing the baryon - baryon scattering quantitatively , and study the baryon - meson scattering in this paper @xcite .",
    "there are two points which are taken into account especially in this baryon - meson scattering problem .",
    "one of them , as was mentioned above , is a coupling to the @xmath4 pole in addition to the usual coupled - channel baryon - meson scattering calculation .",
    "the other one is a modification of the relative kinetic energy of qcm . in the nonrelativistic scheme of the quark models ,",
    "the reduced mass of the baryon - meson system is @xmath18 with the constituent quark mass , @xmath19 .",
    "when we study the @xmath0(1405 ) in terms of the baryon - meson scattering , the most important channel is @xmath20 channel . in reality",
    ", it has much smaller reduced mass , 124 mev , compared with that of qcm , which is roughly 400 mev .",
    "the kinetic energy is underestimated severely . to remove this , we replace the reduced mass in qcm by the real one ;",
    "we have found that to take this effects into account is essential to discuss the baryon - meson scatterings by the quark model .    as for the interaction between quarks",
    ", we follow the most common approach based on oge and linear confinement .",
    "this model nicely reproduces the su(3 ) octet and decuplet baryons . in order to describe the su(3 ) octet and singlet meson spectra",
    ", we include the instanton induced interaction ( iii ) @xcite .",
    "we also introduce a purely phenomenological potential to lower the pseudoscalar su(3 ) octet mesons , which is considered to express the collective nature of the goldstone bosons . employing this model",
    ", we can reproduce the observed baryon and meson masses well after an assumption for the zero - point energy is introduced .",
    "we use this ` oge model ' rather than the ` chiral model , ' in which the quarks interact with each other by exchanging the goldstone bosons .",
    "the oge model may not produce the long - range behavior of the system with a lack of meson - exchange between the baryon and meson .",
    "we , however , use this model as a first step , because it is very difficult for the chiral model to reproduce the meson spectrum , and because it is not clear how to remove a possible overcounting from the treatment which handles the scattering q@xmath2 mesons and the exchanged mesons simultaneously if we use the chiral model for the baryon - meson scattering problem .    in the next section ,",
    "we explain the model hamiltonian . then in section 3",
    ", a brief summary of qcm for baryon - meson scattering will be given .",
    "there we explain how to modify the relative kinetic energy between baryon and meson in the quark cluster model , and how to take into account the @xmath4 pole in qcm .",
    "numerical results for the coupled channel @xmath20 and n@xmath7 scattering and discussion are given in section 4 .",
