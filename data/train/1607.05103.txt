    "mond @xcite attributes the mass discrepancies in galactic systems not to dark matter but to a departure from the standard dynamics at low accelerations .",
    "its basic tenets are : ( i ) galactic systems showing large mass discrepancies are governed by new dynamics that are invariant under space - time scaling @xmath11 . there , newton",
    "s @xmath12 is replaced by a scale - invariant constant @xmath13 .",
    "( ii ) the boundary between the standard and the scale - invariant regime is marked by the constant @xmath14 , which is an acceleration .",
    "thus , much below @xmath15  ` the deep - mond limit '  dynamics are scale invariant , and much above it standard dynamics are approached .",
    "references @xcite are recent reviews of mond .    in contradistinction from the dark - matter paradigm , mond decrees , as a law of physics , that baryons determine the full dynamics of a system .",
    "so , mond predicts that various ` dynamical ' galaxy properties  deduced from the measured accelerations  are tightly correlated with ` baryonic ' properties  those deduced directly from the distribution of baryonic mass ( see , e.g. , the recent ref .",
    "an example of such a ` mond law ' is the mass - asymptotic - speed relation ( massr ) @xcite , which is arguably the most famous prediction of an exact , functional relation .",
    "it had predicted a specific version of the ` baryonic tully - fisher relation ' .",
    "here , i deal with a new mond law : _ a functional relation _ between a ` baryonic ' and a ` dynamical ' property of pure disc galaxies .",
    "the one is the central surface ( baryonic ) density of the disc , @xmath1 , the other is the total , ` dynamically ' measured central surface density , @xmath0 .",
    "the impetus to look for such a mond central - surface - densities relation ( csdr ) has come from the recent finding of a correlation between two similar quantities in a large sample of disc galaxies in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "this mond csdr is quite different from other mond laws of galactic dynamics  such as the massr , or the discrepancy - acceleration relation  and thus broadens the scope of the mond codex ( see sec .",
    "[ discussion ] ) .",
    "preliminary aspects of the mond csdr have been discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite in an approximate way , in terms of the mean density and characteristic size of the galaxy .",
    "in particular , it was shown that mond predicts that , for @xmath16 , we have @xmath17 , which implies that @xmath18 . for @xmath10 , mond predicts that @xmath0 scales as @xmath19 , with the coefficient estimated approximately , and being somewhat system dependent . being independent of @xmath1 in this limit . ]",
    "these predictions are born out by the findings of ref .",
    "@xcite .    here",
    ", i go rather far beyond these preliminary predictions , and show in sec .",
    "[ derivation ] that for pure discs , the mond csdr , @xmath1-@xmath0 relation is functional , and i derive @xmath20 analytically for the full @xmath1 range .",
    "the predicted relation is compared with the data of ref .",
    "@xcite in sec .",
    "section [ discussion ] is a discussion .",
    "a true , or ` baryonic ' , mass distribution @xmath21 ( of a galaxy , say ) produces a newtonian acceleration field @xmath22 that is determined from the poisson equation . in modified - gravity formulations of mond , which i shall use here , the acceleration field , @xmath23 , is determined from another equation .",
    "one may , on occasion , want to interpret the mond field in newtonian terms and define the ` dynamical ' density of the galaxy as that for which @xmath24 is the newtonian field : _ d-()^-1 .",
    "this density is made of the baryonic contribution plus a phantom density that a newtonist would attribute to dark matter .",
    "@xmath25 is determined , or constrained , from the observed dynamics of the system ( rotation curves , light bending , velocity dispersions , etc . )",
    "consider , as a special case , an axisymmetric , thin , disc galaxy , reflection - symmetric about its ( @xmath26 ) midplane .",
    "the dynamical , face - on , central surface density is _",
    "-^^0_d(z)dz , where we work in cylindrical coordinates with the @xmath27-axis along the axisymmetry axis , and @xmath28 .    the assumed symmetries will enter through their implications that along the @xmath27 axis the newtonian and mond accelerations have only a @xmath27 component , and that they are each equal in magnitude and opposite in sign at @xmath27 and @xmath29 .",
    "i only use , directly , the assumption that the system is ` thin ' along the @xmath27 axis ; i.e. , all the matter along this axis is concentrated in a thin disc at the origin , where the baryonic surface - density is @xmath1",
    ". this still holds for a disc that flares , or is not otherwise thin , in the outer parts . but overall flatness may also enter some aspects indirectly ( see below ) .",
    "the baryonic @xmath1 is related to @xmath30 , the absolute value of the newtonian acceleration just outside the disc , at the origin : @xmath31 . because we are dealing with a thin disc , the expression for @xmath0 in eq .",
    "( [ ii ] ) has two contributions : one from the disc ( baryonic plus phantom )  which is given by @xmath32 , where @xmath33 is the absolute value of the mond acceleration just outside the disc , at the origin .",
    "the reflection symmetry is invoked here .",
    "the other contribution is ( out)=2_0^+^^0_d  dz=-_0^+^  dz , where the integration is from just outside the disc .      in qumond ( quasilinear mond ) @xcite , @xmath34 is determined from the field equation = , where the interpolating function @xmath6 has the limits @xmath35 , which follows from scale invariance , and @xmath36 for correspondence with newtonian dynamics .",
    "applying gauss s theorem to get the jump condition at the origin , we have @xmath37 . thus ( disc)=y_0(y_0 ) , where @xmath38 , and @xmath39 the mond surface density @xcite : = 138(/1.210 ^ -8)^-2 . to calculate @xmath40 , note that along the @xmath27-axis ( outside the disc , where @xmath41 ) we have from eq.([qumon ] ) , @xmath42/dz$ ] , where @xmath43 .",
    "i assumed that along the @xmath27-axis @xmath44 always points to the origin .",
    "this is obvious for a thin disc .",
    "it is true for a much larger class of galaxies , but not for any ` thick disc ' . substituting in eq.([iii ] ) ,",
    "changing variables to @xmath45 , and integrating by parts , one gets ( out)=. the first term cancels the disc contribution from eq.([iv ] ) , and we are left with the desired result = ( / ) ;  ( y)_0^y(y )  dy .",
    "this is a surprising result , because the dynamics is not local .",
    "the value of @xmath25 at a given point , and its distribution along the @xmath27-axis , depend on the full mass distribution of the galaxy .",
    "yet , the integral that is @xmath0 turns out to depend only on @xmath1 !    the high-@xmath1 asymptote ( newtonian limit ) is gotten by taking @xmath46 , which gives @xmath47 .",
    "the opposite asymptote ( the deep mond limit ) is gotten from the scale - invariant limit @xmath48 , and gives : @xmath49 . in this limit ,",
    "@xmath50 and @xmath40 contribute equally , @xmath19 each .",
    "the two asymptotes meet at @xmath51 .    since everywhere @xmath52 , the mond value of @xmath0 is always above the two asymptotes .",
    "for example , for the limiting form : @xmath53 , we have from eq.([vi ] ) @xmath54 for @xmath55 , and @xmath56 for @xmath57 .    for @xmath58/2 $ ] , which is widely used in mond rotation curve analysis , eq.([vi ] )",
    "gives ( y)=y/2+y^1/2(1+y/4)^1/2 + 2sinh^-1(y^1/2/2 ) .      in the nonlinear poisson formulation of mond @xcite , the mond acceleration field",
    "is determined by the field equation = -= , with @xmath59 , @xmath60 .",
    "defining @xmath61 , @xmath45 has to be a monotonic function of @xmath62 @xcite ; so the relation can be inverted .",
    "define then @xmath6 , such that @xmath63 .",
    "the interpolating function @xmath6 is the equivalent of the above @xmath6 in qumond , and has the same large- and small-@xmath45 limits .",
    "the relation between @xmath33 and @xmath30 is the same as for qumond .",
    "thus , eq.([iv ] ) for @xmath50 holds here as well . to calculate the integrand in eq.([iii ] ) for @xmath40 ,",
    "note that along the @xmath27-axis , and outside the disc , we have from the field equation ( [ poissona ] ) ( @xmath64 ) ( x)-g  d / dz=0 , where @xmath65 .",
    "i assumed that along the @xmath27-axis , @xmath24 always points to the origin ( so @xmath66 for @xmath67 ) .",
    "this can be proven @xcite for a thin disc , but is also true for a much larger class , but not for any ` thick disc ' .",
    "differentiating the relation @xmath61 with respect to @xmath45 , we have : @xmath68 . noting also that @xmath69 , extracting from these the expression for @xmath70 along the @xmath27 axis , substituting in the integrand , and integrating by parts , one finds that expression ( [ vi ] ) for @xmath0 holds here as well . as a result ,",
    "all the corollaries listed for qumond carry to the nonlinear poisson theory .",
    "what can be said about the general case of an arbitrary mond theory , arbitrary dynamical and baryonic surface densities , and any galactic system ?",
    "confine ourselves first to a two - parameter family of self - similar systems  such as all exponential discs , with constant thickness - to - size ratio  with a baryonic density distribution @xmath71 , with the same @xmath72 . for this family",
    ", any definition of a baryonic surface density  local , such as our @xmath1 , or global , such as the total mass over some area  is given by @xmath73 up to a dimensionless constant .",
    "if @xmath74 is some ` dynamical ' surface density  such as our @xmath0 , or @xmath75 defined below in sec .",
    "[ data ]  then in any nonrelativistic mond theory , we have on dimensional grounds , @xmath76 , where @xmath77 is a dimensionless function , constructed from dimensionless combinations of its variables . the only such variable is readily seen to be @xmath78 ( or some function of it ) .",
    "we thus have for the family @xmath79 . in the newtonian limit , where @xmath15 is not available",
    ", we must have @xmath80 ; the dimensionless constant @xmath81 depends on the family and choice of surface densities ( but not the exact theory ) .",
    "this is just the newtonian result . in the opposite , deep - mond limit",
    ", scale invariance dictates that @xmath82 , or @xmath83 . this is because under space - time scaling , a dynamical surface density , which is derived as @xmath84 , scales as @xmath85 , while @xmath86 , defined as @xmath87 , scales as @xmath88 ( and the two sides of any dml relation have to scale in the same way ) .",
    "the dimensionless constant @xmath89 may depend on the family , the choice of surface densities , and the exact mond theory .",
    "but , since mond is assumed not to involve large dimensionless constants , @xmath81 and @xmath89 should be of order unity , if @xmath74 and @xmath86 are bulk properties ( and , thus , do not introduce small dimensionless quantities in themselves ) .",
    "thus for all system families taken together , any mond theory would predict a strong @xmath90 correlation , with the two universal asymptotes .",
    "the surprising and helpful aspect of our analysis here is that the mond csdr for pure discs is universal , and can be derived in the two full - fledged mond theories practiced at present ( they give @xmath91 , @xmath92 ) .",
    "figure [ fig1 ] shows the data points of ref .",
    "for the data , our @xmath1 is represented by a proxy : the _ stellar _ central surface mass density , @xmath93 , converted from the central surface brightness using a universal mass - to - light ratio in the 3.6 micron photometric band , @xmath94 solar units .",
    "as a proxy for our @xmath0 , ref .",

    "@xcite , with some 3-parameter formula ( not theoretically motivated ) .",
    "no fitting is involved in the mond curves .",
    "the values of the mond surface density , @xmath39 is marked . including the contribution of gas to @xmath1 would move some of the low-@xmath1 data points somewhat to the right , and correcting for the fact that @xmath104 would move them slightly upward ( see comments in subsec .",
    "[ commdata ] ) . ]",
    "it is seen that the mond csdr , which involves no free parameters , agrees very well with the proxy data : the normalization , the asymptotic slopes , the position of the break , and the general behavior .",
    "@xmath103 does not include the contribution from the gas , which is said to be small in most cases . however , some low-@xmath1 galaxies are exceptions , and it would have been instructive to include the gas contribution , so as to get the true , baryonic , central surface density .",
    "departures of @xmath105 from the universal value used by ref .",
    "@xcite will contribute to scatter around the predicted relation . and , possible small systematic variations of @xmath105 , for example with @xmath1 ,",
    "could lead to a small change in the slope .    even for a pure baryonic disc , @xmath75 , which is exact for thin discs , somewhat underestimates mond s @xmath0 , because mond s @xmath25 has a ` thick ' phantom component [ from which @xmath40 is made ] .",
    "for example , it is readily seen that for a spherical system , @xmath106 . in the high-@xmath1 regime , this should not matter , as the ` phantom ' component is negligible . in the deep - mond , low-@xmath1 regime , we saw that the ` phantom disc ' and ` phantom halo ' contribute equally to @xmath0 , according to mond .",
    "the disc component is accounted for correctly by the corresponding contribution to @xmath75 . for the ` phantom halo ' component",
    ", @xmath75 is between @xmath107 and 1 of the contribution to @xmath0 . in all",
    ", we thus expect @xmath75 to underestimate @xmath0 by a factor between @xmath108 and @xmath109  not much of a correction compared with the data spread . as an example , i calculated the relevant quantities for a deep - mond , thin , kuzmin disc , for which the mond rotation curve is known analytically : @xmath110 , with @xmath111 , and @xmath112 the kuzmin scale length @xcite .",
    "i found that @xmath113 , indeed between 0.75 and 1 .",
    "the mond csdr differs from other mond laws ( discussed , e.g. , in ref .",
    "@xcite ) in several important regards : a. it is a relation between a ` local ' baryonic attribute , @xmath1 , defined at the center , and a ` global ' dynamical one : the column dynamical density along the symmetry axis .",
    "b. it encompasses the full gamut of accelerations . in comparison",
    ", the massr relates a global baryonic attribute  the total mass  with the asymptotic rotational speeds , and it involves only the deep - mond regime , and only the outskirts of systems .",
    "the mond ` mass - discrepancy - acceleration relation ' for disc galaxies , relates the baryonic and dynamical accelerations at the same radius , in the plane of disc galaxies . and",
    ", the mond mass - velocity - dispersion relation ( an analog of the virial theorem ) relates two global attributes , and holds in the low - acceleration regime .    with good enough data , one can , in principle determine the mond interpolating function by differentiating the observed @xmath4 , from eq .",
    "( [ vi ] ) .",
    "this can also be done in an independent way from the discrepancy - acceleration relation . but this will have to await better data to constrain @xmath4 .",
    "the mond csdr falls very near the 3-parameter best - fit of ref .",
    "the scatter around this best fit was shown in ref .",
    "@xcite to be @xmath114 dex , consistent with observational and procedural errors , i.e. , with no intrinsic scatter .",
    "furthermore , the residuals do not correlate with various galaxy properties , such as size , gas fraction , or stellar mass .",
    "this is exactly what mond predicts , while , as also stressed in ref .",
    "@xcite , in the dark - matter paradigm , there is no reason why @xmath0 , which would stand for the central column density of baryon plus dark matter , should be so well correlated with the local @xmath1 . especially , the correlation in the low @xmath1 region  where the discrepancy between @xmath0 and @xmath1 is large  goes quite against the grain of the cold - dark - matter paradigm : even with schemes , such as ` feedback ' , ` abundance matching ' , and the like  put in by hand to save this paradigm from various embarrassments  one would expect large scatter in any relation between the ` dynamical ' and baryonic properties , which , to boot , one would expect to depend on galaxy properties ( see , e.g. , the relevant discussion in ref .",
