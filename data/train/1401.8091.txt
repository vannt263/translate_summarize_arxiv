    "cosmological simulations of the evolution of cold dark matter ( cdm ) show that the dark matter in collapsed , virialized systems forms cuspy distributions with inner profiles that are too steep compared with observations ( e.g. flores & primack 1994 ; moore 1994 ; navarro , frenk & white 1996 ) .",
    "this is commonly referred to as the cuspy halo problem .",
    "one solution to this problem proposed early on , is that that impulsive mass loss from the galaxy can lead to irreversible expansion of the orbits of stars and dark matter near the center of the halo ( navarro , eke & frenk 1996 ; read & gilmore 2005 ; pontzen & governato 2012 ) .",
    "these conclusions were based on simple analytic arguments and it was not clear whether this mechanism could in fact produce central density profiles in close agreement with observations .",
    "recently , there have been a series of gas - dynamical simulations of dwarf galaxies demonstrating that repeated gas outflows during bursts of star formation can indeed transfer enough energy to the dark matter component to flatten `` cuspy '' central dark matter profiles ( mashchenko , wadsley & couchman 2008 ; governato et al 2010 ; governato et al 2012 ; zolotov et al 2012 ; trujillo - gomez et al 2013 ; teyssier et al 2013 ; shen et al 2013 ) .",
    "it is still unclear whether the energy requirements for flattening cuspy profiles are in line with the actual stellar populations and star formation histories of real low mass galaxies ( gnedin & zhao 2002 ; garrison - kimmel et al 2013 ) . in a recent paper , teyssier",
    "et al ( 2013 ) highlighted two key observational predictions of all simulations that find cusp - core transformations : i ) low mass galaxies have a bursty star formation history with a peak - to - trough ratio of 5 to 10 , ii ) the bursts occur on the dynamical timescale of the galaxy .",
    "in addition , the simulations show that the feedback associated with the bursts alter the final stellar structure of the galaxies . in simulations without feedback ,",
    "a prominent bulge with large sersic index and a weak exponential disk was formed .",
    "in contrast , in the simulation with feedback , a smaller exponential disk with no bulge in the center and a clear signature of a core within the central 500 pc was produced .",
    "observationally , it is well established that there exist classes of low mass galaxy , for example blue compact dwarf galaxies with strong emission lines ( bcd galaxies ) , which are clearly undergoing strong starbursts at the present day ( e.g. searle & sargent 1972 ; meurer et al 1995 ) . in very nearby galaxies where individual stars can be resolved in high quality images , star formation histories for individual systems",
    "can be derived over longer timescales .",
    "some nearby dwarf spheroidals have clearly experienced bursty star formation histories in their past ( e.g. dolphin 2012 ; de boer et al 2012 ) .",
    "on the other hand , the star formation histories of dwarf irregular galaxies have been found to be relatively quiescent ( e.g. van zee 2001 ) .",
    "recent work on low mass galaxies at high redshifts by van der wel et al ( 2011 ) has indicated that the space densities of extreme emission line dwarf galaxies with stellar masses @xmath8 are much higher at earlier cosmic times . at @xmath9 ,",
    "these authors claim that the population of extreme emission line galaxies detected in the candels survey is high enough to produce a significant fraction of the total stellar mass contained in the present - day population of such galaxies , if star formation continued in the same mode for around 4 gyr .",
    "these authors propose that most of the stars in present - day dwarf galaxies must have formed in strong bursts at @xmath9 .",
    "this conclusion is , however , at odds with the observation that the stellar populations of present - day low mass galaxies are , on average , quite young ( kauffmann et al 2003b ) .",
    "heavens et al ( 2004 ) analyzed the star formation histories of stacked samples of galaxies in bins of stellar mass from the sloan digital sky survey .",
    "they showed that the _ average _ star formation history of galaxies with stellar masses less than @xmath10 could be well represented by flat star formation rate over the past 3 - 7 gyr , with a decline at earlier epochs .    in order to estimate the duty cycle of the starburst phenomenon as well as the amplitude range in star formation during a burst , it is necessary to analyze a complete sample of galaxies that are intrinsically similar",
    "kauffmann et al ( 2003b ) used constraints from 4000   break and h@xmath0 stellar absorption line indices to show that the fraction of present - day galaxies that have experienced bursts in the past 1 - 2 gyr , is a factor of 5 higher for galaxies with stellar masses @xmath11 than for galaxies with @xmath4 .",
    "a similar conclusion was recently reached by bauer et al ( 2013 ) , who analyzed the distribution of specific star formation rates as a function of stellar mass for galaxies with @xmath12 from the galaxy and mass assembly ( gama ) survey and found a significant tail of galaxies with high sfr / m@xmath13 and low stellar masses that could only be explained by a stochastic burst with late onset .    in this paper",
    ", we use the 4000   break and h@xmath0 indices in combination with sfr/@xmath1 derived from emission line flux measurements , to constrain the recent star formation histories of low mass galaxies .",
    "we show that this combination of quantities allows us to clearly separate galaxies that are _ currently _ undergoing a burst of star formation from galaxies that have formed their stars continuously and galaxies that have experienced a burst in the past .",
    "we use the subsample of galaxies experiencing an ongoing burst to constrain burst mass fractions and duty cycles , as well as the amplitude variation in sfr / m@xmath13 during the burst .",
    "we investigate how these parameters change as a function of galaxy mass .",
    "finally , we investigate how the stellar structure of the galaxy correlates with burst mass fraction .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section 2 , we describe or sample and the methodology we use to analyze star formation histories . in section 3",
    ", we present our results , and in section 4 , we summarize and conclude . a hubble constant @xmath14 km s@xmath15 is adopted throughout .",
    "the parent galaxy sample used in this study is a magnitude - limited sample constructed from the final data release ( dr7 ; abazajian et al .",
    "2009 ) of the sdss ( york et al .",
    "2000 ) and is the same as that used in li et al .",

    "stellar masses , d@xmath21(4000 ) and h@xmath0 line index measurements from the sdss fiber spectra , as well as the estimated error on these quantities , are taken from the dr7 mpa / jhu value added catalogue ( http://www.mpa-garching.mpg.de/sdss/dr7/ ) .",
    "star formation rates estimated within a 3 arcsecond fiber aperture are also available from these catalogues .",
    "the reader is referred to brinchmann et al .",
    "( 2004 ) for a detailed description of how sfrs are derived .",
    "briefly , star formation rates are estimated by fitting a grid of photo - ionization models to the observed [ oiii ] , h@xmath22 , h@xmath23 and [ nii ] line strengths for galaxies where the [ oiii]/h@xmath22 and [ nii]/h@xmath23 line ratios have values that place them within the region of the baldwin , phillips & terlevich ( 1981 , bpt ) diagram occupied by galaxies in which the primary source of ionizing photons is from hii regions rather than an active galactic nucleus ( agn ) .",
    "standard bayesian estimation methodology is used to derive the probability distribution function ( pdf ) of the star formation rate .",
    "we adopt the median of the integrated pdf as our actual estimate and one half the difference between the 84th and 16th percentile points as our estimate of the 1@xmath24 error .",
    "we note that if the h@xmath22 line is not detected , the [ nii]/h@xmath23 ratio can still be used to separate out agn ; in this case , the sfr estimates have much larger errors , because dust extinction is not well constrained .",
    "the mpa / jhu catalogue does contain sfr estimates for agn and galaxies where the h@xmath23 and/or [ nii ] lines are not detected .",
    "these estimates are derived using an empirical calibration between d@xmath21(4000 ) and sfr/@xmath1 ( see brinchmann et al 2004 for details ) . for such objects ,",
    "the sfr estimates carry no direct information about hii region line luminosities and thus can not be used to find galaxies that are experiencing ongoing bursts .",
    "for this reason , we restrict the discussion in this paper to galaxies with @xmath25 , where the fraction of agn drops to values close to zero ( kauffmann et al 2003c ) . in this case , essentially all galaxies with indirect sfr estimates are those with no detection of h@xmath23/[nii ] .",
    "these galaxies have old stellar populations , and as will be discussed in the next section , they are classified as having had quiescent star formation histories .",
    "we create three different model libraries by using the population synthesis code of bruzual & charlot ( 2003 ) as follows :    1 .   _ continuous models .",
    "_  a library of model galaxies with continuous star formation histories .",
    "these model galaxies have a continuous sfr , declining exponentially according to sfr(t ) @xmath26 , with @xmath27 uniformly distributed between 0 ( i.e. constant star formation rate ) and 0.5 gyr@xmath15 .",

    "we output the spectral energy distribution parameters at the present day .",
    "2 .   _ models with ongoing bursts .",
    "_ for each model galaxy in the continuous library described above , we add a burst which starts 100 million years before the present time .",
    "the burst has constant amplitude as a function of time and the amplitudes are allowed to vary so that the mass fraction of stars formed in the burst ranges from 0.00001 to close to 1 .",
    "we output the spectral energy distribution parameters at time intervals @xmath28 of 10 million years while the burst is in progress .",
    "3 .   _ models with past bursts . _",
    "we follow the same algorithm used to create the models with ongoing bursts , except that the starting time for the burst ranges from 2 gyr before the present to 0.2 gyr before the present .",
    "all bursts run for a total duration of 100 million years .",
    "we output spectral energy distribution parameters at the present day .",
    "we generate all model libraries at metallicities of 0.5 solar and 0.25 solar , appropriate for galaxies with stellar masses in the range @xmath29 to @xmath10 ( tremonti et al 2004 ) . a fixed chabrier ( 2003 ) initial mass function ( imf )",

    "we note that the sfr / m@xmath13 error estimate does not include any estimate of the systematic errors in the photo - ionization models used to estimate sfr .",
    "nevertheless , it is clear from figure 1 that we should be able to separate galaxies with ongoing starbursts from the rest of the population with reasonably high confidence .",
    "we now describe the procedure used to group galaxies into classes according to whether they most likely have had continuous star formation histories , are currently experiencing a burst , or have experienced a burst in the past 2 gyr .",
    "we note that these classifications pertain to the _ central regions _ of the galaxies , since the fiber spectrum typically samples 20 - 30 % of the total light from the galaxy ( kauffmann et al 2003a ) .",
    "we first search the continuous star formation library for the model that minimizes @xmath34 .",
    "if the minimum @xmath34 per degree of freedom ( @xmath35 , with @xmath36 in our case ) is less than 2.37 , this means that there is a 50% or greater probability that that the continuous sfh hypothesis is correct , and we place the galaxy into the continuous class .",
    "if @xmath35 is greater than 2.37 , we then search both the ongoing and past burst libraries for a new minimum @xmath34 model .",
    "we check whether the new @xmath35 is smaller than that obtained for the continuous library , and smaller than 2.37 .",
    "if so , we consider our classification into ongoing burst / past burst as `` secure '' .",
    "we note that the burst libraries contain models with burst fractions very close to zero , which are essentially identical to the models in the continuous library , so the new minimum @xmath34 is guaranteed to be equal to or smaller than the old one .",
    "if the new @xmath35 lies in the range 2.37 - 6.25 , the probability that the model is consistent with the data is still between 10 - 50% , so these classifications should be regarded as `` tentative '' .    in figure 2 , we plot galaxies in the stellar mass range @xmath37 in the plane of log sfr/@xmath1 versus d@xmath21(4000 ) and log sfr / m@xmath13 versus h@xmath0 .",
    "we colour - code the points according to their classification : black refers to continuous , blue to ongoing burst and red to past burst .",
    "this particular mass range is chosen mainly for illustrative purposes .",
    "as can be seen , most of the leverage in the classification comes from the combination of sfr/@xmath1 and d@xmath21(4000 ) where the three classes separate most clearly .",
    "this is not surprising , because we have seen that these two quantities have smaller errors than h@xmath0 .",
    "it should also be noted that the class of galaxies that are experiencing ongoing bursts is clearly separated from the the other two classes in both planes .",

    "we comment briefly on the very narrow tail of black points in the left panel of figure 2 .",

    "[ examples],width=332 ]    we note that for each model galaxy , we store a variety of parameters relating to its star formation history .",
    "we can then use the library to compute the most probable value of each parameter from the median of the likelihood distribution , and an error on each parameter from the range enclosing 68 percent of the total probability density ( see the appendix in kauffmann et al 2003a ) .",
    "the two parameters that will be explored in this paper include the fraction of the total stellar mass of the galaxy formed in the starburst and a formation time , defined to be the lookback time when half the stars in the galaxy were formed .",
    "it is interesting to investigate the population of galaxies with minimum reduced @xmath34 values greater than 6.25 , in order to see whether there is any evidence that our underlying stellar population models do not represent the data adequately .",
    "one possible inadequacy is the assumption of a fixed chabrier imf .",
    "changing the fraction of high mass stars would alter the locus of the models in the plane of inferred sfr/@xmath1 versus d@xmath21(4000)/h@xmath0 .",

    "we note that previous work did not attempt to account for the effect of bursts on a galaxy - by - galaxy basis .",
    "in addition , the test using h@xmath23-based sfr and two narrow - band stellar absorption line indices should be less sensitive to systematic effects in the procedures used to correct for dust extinction .",
    "we find the fraction of galaxies with @xmath35 values greater than 6.25 to be @xmath38 5% .",
    "these outliers are primarily galaxies with low 4000   break strengths and strong emission lines .",
    "the greatest discrepancy between models and data arises for the h@xmath0 index .",
    "we note that in strongly star - bursting galaxies , the h@xmath0 absorption feature is filled in by nebular emission .",
    "although the mpa / jhu spectral fitting pipeline attempts to subtract the emission , recovery of the h@xmath39 absorption features can be expected to become increasingly inaccurate for strongly star - bursting galaxies where stellar features are weak and nebular emission dominates . we therefore perform a restricted fit to the combination of sfr / m@xmath13 and d@xmath21(4000 ) .",
    "the percentage of galaxies with @xmath35 values greater than 4.61 ( corresponding to a probability of 0.1 for 2 degrees of freedom ) drops by another factor of two to values less than @xmath382 - 3% in all the stellar mass bins .",
    "the remaining outliers mainly have d@xmath21(4000 ) values that are less than 1 , a value that can not be matched by the youngest stellar template in the bruzual & charlot ( 2003 ) models .",
    "we have checked the dependence of d@xmath21(4000 ) on imf slope and on whether nebular continuum emission is included using the starburst 99 models ( leitherer et al 1999 ) .",
    "our tests show that d@xmath21(4000)@xmath40 can not be reached by tuning these parameters .",
    "we think it is most likely that the remaining outliers are affected by errors in the spectro - photometric flux calibration . in summary , we find do not find a population of galaxies where there is conclusive evidence for a top - heavy imf , though we feel that it would be premature to rule out imf variations based on this data .",
    "the black curve in figure 3 shows the fraction of the total integrated stellar mass in galaxies that resides in galaxies that are well - fit by continuous models .",

    "our main results can be summarized as follows .    *",
    "the fraction of the total sfr density in galaxies with ongoing bursts declines with increasing stellar mass , from 0.85 at a stellar mass of @xmath3 to 0.25 at a stellar mass of @xmath10 .",
    "the duty cycle of bursts declines from 0.7 for @xmath56 galaxies to 0.1 for @xmath10 galaxies . *",
    "the median burst mass fraction in galaxies of all stellar masses is small , 5% or less .",
    "there is , however , a tail of low mass galaxies that are undergoing bursts that have formed as much as 50 - 60% of their present - day mass .",
    "the number of galaxies in this high mass fraction tail decreases as a function of stellar mass . *",
    "low mass galaxies are not all young . the distribution of half mass formation times for galaxies with stellar masses less than @xmath5 is broad , spanning the range from 1 to 10 gyr .",
    "this is quite different to what is obtained when colours or 4000   break strengths are used to estimate stellar population age , assuming continuous star formation histories . * the peak - to - trough variation in star formation rate among the bursting population ranges from a factor of 25 in the lowest mass galaxies in our sample to a factor of 10 for galaxies with @xmath68 .",
    "the average duration of bursts in low mass galaxies is comparable to their average dynamical time .",
    "* burst mass fraction is correlated with galaxy structure in quite different ways in low and high mass galaxies .",
    "high mass galaxies experiencing strong bursts are more centrally concentrated , indicating that bulge formation is likely at work .",
    "this is not seen in low mass galaxies . in low mass galaxies ,",
    "we find that the stellar surface densities decrease as a function of @xmath7 .",
    "* gas phase metallicities decrease as a function of @xmath7 in galaxies of all stellar masses .",
    "these results are in rather good agreement with the observational predictions of teyssier et al ( 2013 ) and lend further credence to the idea that the cuspy halo problem can be solved by energy input from multiple starbursts triggered by gas cooling and supernova feedback cycles over the history of a low mass galaxy .",
    "we note that the analysis in this paper is confined to the stellar populations enclosed within the 3 arsecond diameter fiber aperture , which samples the central @xmath38 20 - 30 % of the total light from the galaxy . in future",
    ", it will be interesting to obtain resolved kinematic data for complete samples of low mass galaxies to understand the influence of bursts on galaxy and dark matter halo structure in more detail .",
