    "preferential attachment @xcite is the archetypal growth mechanism for scale - free networks .",

    "but this is not true in general , and it is not true for arbitrary finite networks generated along the way . in this note",
    "we derive straightforward analytic results for the expected exponent @xmath5 of a scale free network with power law degree distribution @xmath8 .",
    "we assume that the network is grown with a barabsi - albert attachment process as described in @xcite . with each new node",
    "we add @xmath0 links and the growth process is terminated when the network has @xmath2 nodes .",
    "we make the approximation that the degree distribution of this finite networks follows a truncated power - law with some exponent @xmath5 .",
    "hence , a preferential attachment ( pa ) network with minimum degree @xmath0 will add exactly @xmath0 new links for each new node .",

    "conversely , the probability that a node has degree @xmath1 is given by @xmath10 where the normalization factor @xmath11 is inconvenient . however @xmath12 and",

    "[ fig_gd ] we illustrate the agreement between sample preferential attachment networks of various sizes and the prediction of ( [ mgamm2 ] ) .",
