    "the existence of quantum entanglement is a joint consequence of the superposition principle and the tensor product structure of the quantum mechanical state space of composite quantum systems .",
    "entanglement is a remarkable feature that distinguishes the quantum from the classical world .",
    "one of the main tasks of quantum entanglement theory is to quantitively characterize the extent to which composite quantum systems are entangled by constructing a mathematical functionan entanglement measure that should be an entanglement monotone , or in other words , not increase on averaging under local operations and classical communications ( locc ) .",
    "even though many efforts have been applied to a variety of quantum systems [ 1 - 3 ] , only bipartite pure - state and low - dimensional systems are well understood .",
    "the quantification of entanglement for high - dimensional systems and multipartite quantum systems remains an open question .",
    "an important step in studying multipartite entanglement was taken by coffman , kundu and wootters [ 4 ] .",
    "they showed that a quantum state has only a limited shareability for quantum entanglement , when they introduced the so - called residual entanglement for tripartite systems of qubits based on the remarkable concurrence [ 1 ] to measure an essential three - qubit ( three - way ) entanglement which must be shared by all the three qubits .",
    "a representative example with such a property is the greenberger - horne - zeilinger ( ghz ) state which has maximal residual entanglement .",
    "once a qubit is traced out , the remaining two qubits are separable .",
    "later , it was shown that this essential three - qubit entanglement is one ( ghz - type ) of the two inequivalent classes ( ghz - type and w - type ) of tripartite entanglement of qubits [ 5 ] . in this paper , we call it genuine tripartite entanglement . for a general multipartite quantum state ,",
    "multipartite quantum entanglement can be classified into much more inequivalent entanglement classes [ 6 - 9 ] , which is also one principal reason why the entanglement in multipartite systems is much more complicated .",
    "therefore , in general a single quantity can not effectively and thoroughly measure multipartite entanglement .",
    "however , sometimes a single quantity is quite convenient and straightforward if one is going to study the separability property of a given quantum system [ 10 - 12 ] , or collect the contributions of some entanglements of different classes as a whole [ 13 - 16 ] , or more naturally , measure entanglement of a given class [ 6 - 9 ] .    in this paper , we introduce a single quantity to characterize the genuine tripartite entanglement of tripartite @xmath2dimensional quantum systems based on a new bipartite entanglement measure .",
    "the distinct advantage is that the quantity is not only an entanglement monotone , but also explicitly quantifies the ghz - type inseparability of a tripartite high - dimensional pure state . as an application",
    ", we consider the genuine tripartite entanglement of the ground state of the exactly solvable isotropic spin-@xmath1 chain with three - spin interaction [ 17,18 ] .",
    "it is shown that the singularity of the genuine tripartite entanglement exactly signals a quantum phase transition .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "first , we introduce a new bipartite entanglement monotone ; and then we give the genuine tripartite entanglement monotone and consider the entanglement of the ground state of the exactly solvable isotropic spin-@xmath1 chain with three - spin interaction ; the conclusions are drawn at the end .",
