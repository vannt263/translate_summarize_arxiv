    "low ionisation nuclear emission line region ( liner ) galaxies are characterised by optical emission line ratios which indicate a low level of ionisation @xcite .",
    "the origin of these emission lines is still the subject of debate : the lines are attributed either to shock heating ( baldwin , phillips & terlevich 1981 ) or to photoionisation by a central agn ( ferland & netzer 1983 ; halpern & steiner 1983 ) .",
    "for example , dopita & sutherland ( 1996 ) have shown that shock heating can produce the optical line ratios observed in liner galaxies , with shock velocities of 150 - 500 km s@xmath4 .",
    "such shocks can originate from stellar processes ( e.g. supernovae ) , and can also be produced as a result of a jet or a wind from an agn .",
    "on the other hand , when the optical line ratios of liners were compared to those measured in seyfert galaxies , ferland & netzer ( 1983 ) found that they could explain the lines in both types of object using the same photoionising agn continuum shape , but with a systematic variation of ionisation parameter , from low values in liners to high values in seyferts .",
    "ngc 7213 is a nearby ( @xmath5 = 0.005977 ) s0 galaxy with agn and liner characteristics .",
    "it is clear that there is an agn in this source , classified as a seyfert 1 from its h@xmath1 line width ( full width at zero intensity @xmath6 13000 km s@xmath4 , phillips 1979 ) .",
    "a variety of optical emission lines are observed in this galaxy with velocities ranging from 200 to 2000 km s@xmath4 fwhm ( filippenko & halpern 1984 , hereafter fh84 ) .",
    "fh84 argue that photoionisation of clouds spanning a range of densities and velocities by a non - stellar continuum is likely to be the mechanism creating the optical line emission . by invoking high density rather than high temperature clouds ,",
    "fh84 eliminate the need for shock heating .    since its discovery as a low luminosity x - ray source ( marshall 1978 )",
    "ngc 7213 has been observed with several x - ray missions .",
    "the presence of a soft x - ray excess in ngc  7213 was implied by the results of an  spectral survey of agn @xcite when the measured absorbing column for a single power law fit was found to be significantly lower than the galactic value .",
    "in addition , the uv flux measured by wu , boggess & gull ( 1983 ) was higher than would be expected from an extrapolation of the optical flux indicating that ngc  7213 may have a big blue bump ( bbb ) , although weak compared to most seyfert galaxies .",
    "the bbb is often interpreted as thermal emission from an accretion disc ; if accretion discs are present in liners it is important to determine their properties if we are to understand the underlying emission mechanisms .",
    "turner & pounds ( 1989 ) and pounds ( 1994 ) reported possible fe k@xmath1 emission in the x - ray spectrum observed with  and , but there was not sufficient resolution to unambiguously detect these features .",
    "recently bianchi ( 2003 ) combined data from the pn camera on  with simultaneous data from the pds instrument on _ bepposax _ to investigate the iron line complex and reflection hump .",
    "they found that a neutral fe k@xmath1 line is present , with excess emission at higher energies best explained as weak narrow emission lines from highly ionised iron .",
    "the data do not show the presence of a significant reflection hump , suggesting that the neutral fe k@xmath1 line originates in compton - thin material .",
    "they also suggest that the highly ionised fe emission may arise in material photoionised by the agn power law continuum .    here",
    "we present an analysis of the high resolution rgs spectra , 0.3 - 2 kev epic spectra and om photometry taken during the same  pointing .",
    "we revisit the iron line complex with an analysis of the combined pn and mos1 spectrum in which it is possible to obtain better constraints on individual line features . identifying the physical mechanisms producing",
    "the x - ray emission may provide some clues to the origin of the optical emission lines where at present neither shock heating nor photoionisation by the agn can be ruled out .",
    "we also compare the x - ray spectral properties of ngc  7213 with those of the nearest liner galaxy m81 , which has also been studied in detail using  ( page 2003 , 2004 ) , and discuss the relationship between seyfert galaxies and liners .",
    "ngc 7213 was observed on 2001 may 28/29 with  @xcite in the rgs guaranteed time programme . the epic ( strder 2001 ; turner 2001 ) mos1 and pn cameras were operated in small window mode with the medium filter .",
    "the epic mos2 was in full frame mode ( also medium filter ) to image the entire galaxy .",
    "mos2 will be omitted from the analysis due to pile - up , since the count rate was over three times higher than the recommended limit of 0.7 counts s@xmath4 for point sources @xcite .",
    "the rgs instruments @xcite were in standard spectroscopy mode .",
    "the exposure times are 46448 s for mos1 , 42201 s for pn and 46716 s for each rgs instrument .",
    "no variability in flux was found during the observation so we produced a single spectrum from the entire observation for each x - ray instrument .",
    "the optical monitor was operated in imaging mode with optical and ultraviolet filters .",
    "the rgs data were initially processed using the  sas ( science analysis software ) version 5.2 . in each rgs , first and second orders were selected using pulse - height / dispersion regions containing 93 per cent of the pulse height distribution .",
    "source+background spectra were taken from spatial regions containing 90 per cent of the point - spread function in the cross dispersion direction .",
    "background spectra were obtained from regions excluding 95 per cent of the point - spread function .",
    "response matrices were generated using the standard sas rgsrmfgen task .",
    "the effective area of each response matrix was then divided by the ratio of a power law plus galactic column fit to the  rev 0084 rgs spectra of the continuum source mrk 421 to correct for the residual artifacts in the effective area calibration .",
    "after background subtraction , the individual first and second order spectra from rgs1 and rgs2 were resampled and coadded to produce a single spectrum , and the response matrices were combined accordingly .",
    "the raw epic data were processed with the  sas version 5.4 .",
    "spectra were constructed using single and double events in the pn and all valid event patterns ( 0 - 12 ) in mos1 .",
    "source counts were taken from a circular region of radius 45 . in mos1 a background spectrum was obtained from a nearby source - free region , 7 times larger in radius than the source extraction region .",
    "for the pn the background spectrum was taken from 3 separate circular regions totalling 5.76 times the area of the source circle .",
    "the mos1 and pn spectra were then combined into a single spectrum with 45 ev bins using the method of page , davis & salvi ( 2003 ) to improve the signal to noise .",
    "the march 2003 epic response files for small window were used with the resulting spectra .",
    "the om @xcite data were processed with  sas version 5.4 . for each of the three uv filters the sub - exposures were co - added and corrected for modulo-8 noise . the total exposure times amount to 4000",
    "s , 7200 s and 8000 s for the uvw1 , uvm2 and uvw2 filters respectively .",
    "aperture photometry was performed using standard routines from iraf . to minimise the contribution of the host galaxy a circular aperture of 4  in diameter",
    "was used to measure the agn flux , with a background determined from an annulus of inner diameter 5and outer diameter 7 .",
    "the resultant magnitudes were then corrected for the fraction of the point - spread function falling outside the aperture , deadtime , coincidence loss , and galactic reddening ( using the reddening law of seaton 1979 ) .",
    "spectral analyses of the data were performed using the xspec v11.2 x - ray spectral fitting package , using the @xmath7 minimization technique .",
    "the galactic column value used throughout is @xmath8 @xmath9 @xcite , and all line energies are quoted in the rest frame of the source .      [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     [ tab : epicfits ]      a power law plus galactic absorption is clearly a poor fit to the 2 - 10 kev epic data .",
    "the residuals in the pn data between 6 and 7 kev were corrected by bianchi ( 2003 ) with the inclusion of three emission lines , corresponding to fe  i , fe  xxv and fe  xxvi k@xmath1 .",
    "the availability of a simultaneous _ bepposax _ pds observation allowed these authors to rule out the presence of a significant compton reflection component .",
    "combination of the epic pn and mos1 data provides better statistics than pn alone , allowing us to put tighter constraints on the parameters of spectral features .",
    "we fit a power law with galactic absorption , plus 3 gaussian lines of fixed narrow width ( @xmath10 = 0.001 ev ) to the 2 - 10 kev combined pn - mos1 spectrum .",
    "the best fit ( @xmath7/@xmath11 = 212/169 ) has a power law photon index of @xmath12 , consistent with that found in the rgs soft x - ray data .",
    "the centroid energies of the emission lines in the fit to the combined epic data are indeed consistent with iron fluorescence in low ionisation material , fe xxv and fe xxvi .",
    "these lines are well constrained and the results of the fit are given in table [ tab : epicfits ] .",
    "the 2 - 10 kev spectrum of ngc  7213 resembles a typical seyfert galaxy , which is dominated by a @xmath13 power law and a 6.4 kev fe k@xmath1 emission line .",
    "the 6.4 kev line in ngc  7213 is narrow ( fwhm @xmath14 km  s@xmath4 at the 90 per cent confidence level ) , so it can not originate in the inner parts of an accretion disc .",
    "bianchi ( 2003 ) concluded that , given the apparent absence of a reflection component in the _ bepposax _ data , the neutral fe k@xmath1 emission must arise from compton - thin material out of our line - of - sight , either in the form of a torus with a column density of @xmath15 @xmath9 or the broad line region .",
    "the resolution of the epic cameras does not allow the two to be distinguished .",
    "the 2 - 10 kev spectrum of ngc  7213 differs from that typically observed in seyfert 1s in that it contains significant emission lines from fe  xxv and fe  xxvi .",
    "these lines are not normally observed in the classical luminous seyfert galaxies ( e.g. ngc  3783 , kaspi 2002 ; ngc  5548 , pounds 2003 ; ngc  7469 , blustin 2003 ) , though they have been observed in some cases ( e.g. ngc  5506 , bianchi 2004 ) .",
    "in contrast , these lines appear to dominate the fe  k@xmath1 emission in the nearby liner m81 ( page 2004 ) .",
    "the origin of the fe  xxv and fe  xxvi lines in m81 is unclear ( see page 2004 for a discussion ) , and this is also true for ngc  7213 .",
    "they may be produced by photoionisation of compton - thin material by the nuclear x - ray source ( bianchi 2004 ) , or may be collisionally ionised like the soft x - ray thermal plasma .",
    "future observations of the fe  k region at higher spectral resolution , for example with the forthcoming _ astro - e2 _ mission , might answer this question by allowing the application of line diagnostics to the fe  xxv triplet .    in the soft x - ray regime ,",
    "ngc  7213 departs further from a seyfert - like spectrum .",
    "the ionised gas which is seen in the soft x - ray spectra of seyfert galaxies is usually found to be photoionised , whether it is seen in absorption or in emission ( e.g. iras 13349 + 2438 , sako 2001 ; ngc 3783 , kaspi 2002 ; ngc 1068 , kinkhabwala 2002 ) .",
    "however , in the rgs spectrum of ngc  7213 we do not find any evidence for photoionised absorption , and the emission lines are collisionally ionised rather than photoionised ( fig .",
    "[ fig : ovii ] ) . amongst agn ,",
    "collisionally ionised thermal plasma at soft x - ray temperatures , as observed in ngc  7213 , may be a property specific to liners . in a study of 21 liners observed with ,",
    "most were found to be well fitted with a hard x - ray power law ( @xmath16 ) plus a soft x - ray thermal plasma component with @xmath17 kev @xcite . while this provides strong evidence for the presence of a soft x - ray emission line component in liners , the resolution of   was not good enough to permit diagnostics which could distinguish between collisionally ionised and photoionised plasma .",
    "however , the very nearby liner galaxy m81 , for which there is a long - duration rgs spectrum , does contain a significant component of soft x - ray collisionally - ionised thermal plasma @xcite .",
    "the  spectrum of ngc  7213 also deviates from that of a typical seyfert in that it has little or no blackbody - like soft x - ray excess emission .",
    "this component is found in the x - ray spectra of most seyferts ( pounds & reeves 2002 ; turner & pounds 1989 ) , the strongest being seen in the narrow - line seyfert 1 galaxies ( nls1s ) . the origin of the soft x - ray excess is unknown , but is often interpreted as the high energy tail of the thermal emission from an optically thick accretion disc @xcite , particularly in nls1s ( e.g. re 1034 + 39 , pounds , done & osborne 1995 ) .",
    "many seyfert galaxies show strong evidence in x - rays for an accretion disc surrounding the black hole .",
    "the main indicators are a soft - excess , reflection , and broad fe k@xmath1 line emission , all of which come from the inner parts of the accretion disc .",
    "none of these indicators are present in the  spectra of ngc  7213 .",
    "the uv bump in ngc  7213 is either absent or extremely weak compared to other seyferts @xcite .",
    "the optical continuum emission of ngc  7213 comprises both non thermal emission from the agn and stellar radiation ( hf84 ) .",
    "a decomposition of the spectrum , assuming a power law for the agn contribution following @xmath18 , shows that more than 50 per cent of the total continuum emission at 3300   can be non - stellar .",
    "the actual flux level is uncertain by @xmath1930 per cent and also depends on the visual extinction adopted .",
    "hf84 argue that the optical extinction is much higher than the galactic value .",
    "however the  data show no evidence for any intrinsic absorption of the x - ray flux .",
    "therefore we have adopted the agn power law component of the optical spectrum , deconvolved from the stellar contribution by hf84 , and assumed only galactic absorption ( a@xmath20 = 0.05 ) .",
    "the nuclear spectral energy distribution of ngc  7213 is shown in fig .",
    "the ultraviolet data from the om are in good agreement with an extrapolation of the optical power law to shorter wavelengths .",
    "there is no evidence for an optical / uv bump and consequently the agn bolometric luminosity does not appear to be dominated by emission from an optically thick , geometrically thin accretion disc .    assuming that ngc  7213 does contain an accretion disc , there are two possible explanations for the lack of uv emission .",
    "either the disc does not extend close enough to the black hole to emit significantly in the optical / ultraviolet , or the disc extends close to the black hole but has such a low mass transfer rate that it contributes little to the overall emission .    starting with the truncated inner - disc explanation",
    ", it is known that at low accretion rates , stable accretion flows can exist in which the inner parts of the disc take the form of an optically - thin , tenuous , hot corona .",
    "because the inner , hot corona is a much less efficient radiator than a thin disc , much of the energy may be advected into the black hole rather than being radiated .",
    "this is known generally as an advection - dominated accretion flow ( adaf , narayan & yi 1995 ) , and several derivatives of this model have since been developed to include , for example , more realistic geometries ( e.g. cdaf model , narayan , igumenshchev & abramowicz 2000 ) and/or outflows ( e.g. adios model , blandford & begelman 1999 ) , all of which require a truncated disc . a truncated inner disc plus",
    "adaf is the configuration proposed to explain the spectra of black hole x - ray binaries ( esin 1998 ; esin , mcclintock & narayan 1997 ; narayan , garcia & mcclintock 1997 ) . the quiescent phase of the soft x - ray transients v404 cyg and a0620 - 00 can be explained with the adaf model , where the inner radius of the accretion disc lies at @xmath21 schwarzschild radii @xcite . to explain optical and uv observations of m81 , quataert ( 1999 ) invoke an adaf within the truncation radius of the disc .",
    "an adaf model has also been successfully applied to describe the multiwavelength emission from the galactic centre @xcite . in adaf - type models the soft x - ray and",
    "uv signatures of thermal disc emission are weak or absent because the geometrically thin , optically thick part of the disc does not extend close enough to the black hole .",
    "however , such accretion flows are also expected to produce outflows not yet observed in ngc  7213 .",
    "an alternative to a truncated disc is a disc which extends to the inner regions but which is in a ` low state ' ; this can also account for the weak or absent disc emission from ngc  7213 .",
    "thermal - viscous ionisation instabilities , which can develop in a partial ionisation zone of an agn accretion disc , can cause the disc to oscillate between high ( bright ) states and low ( faint ) states @xcite .",
    "the disc spends most of the time in the low state with low luminosity , peaking in the ir and emitting negligible optical and uv radiation .",
    "this is analogous to the accretion disc instability which drives the dwarf nova outbursts in cataclysmic variables ( meyer & meyer - hofmeister 1984 ) .",
    "however , although a low - state disc can account for the lack of primary disc emission , it ought to constitute an x - ray reflector subtending a substantial solid angle to the x - ray source .",
    "both the adaf and the ` low - state ' disc models imply a significantly sub - eddington accretion rate ( e.g. a few percent of the eddington rate or less for the adaf model , narayan & yi 1995 ) . to investigate the accretion rate in ngc  7213 we have estimated the bolometric luminosity of the active nucleus by integrating the radio to x - ray spectral energy distribution . for this",
    "we have used the radio measurements from sadler ( 1984 ) , the power law component in the optical , deconvolved from the stellar contribution by halpern & filippenko ( 1984 ) , the uv flux measurements from the  om and the  x - ray power law continuum .",
    "the bolometric luminosity thus obtained is 9@xmath22 erg s@xmath4 .",
    "previous estimates of the bolometric luminosity are significantly higher than our determination : @xmath23 erg s@xmath4 @xcite and @xmath24 erg s@xmath4 @xcite .",
    "however , these values include the host galaxy as well as the agn , so will overestimate the agn luminosity by a considerable amount .",
    "the black hole mass has been estimated from the stellar velocity dispersion by nelson & whittle ( 1995 ) , who obtained @xmath25 .",
    "such a high black hole mass is consistent with the observed lack of significant x - ray variability during the 46ks observation .",
    "combining the bolometric luminosity and mass estimates we find that the luminosity of ngc  7213 is approximately 7@xmath26 .",
    "generally , seyfert luminosities lie in the range 0.001 - 1 @xmath27 ( wandel 1999 ) .",
    "padovani & rafanelli ( 1988 ) found an average luminosity of @xmath28 for the 34 local seyfert 1 galaxies within their sample of agn , although a much lower luminosity of @xmath29 is inferred for local type 1 seyfert galaxies from studies of their x - ray luminosity function ( page 2001 ) . in any case , our luminosity estimate for ngc  7213 lies at or below the low end of the distribution of seyfert luminosities .",
    "m81 , the nearest known liner , radiates at 4.2@xmath30 times its eddington rate @xcite , and a rate of 10@xmath31 was determined for the liner ngc  4203 @xcite .",
    "the low luminosity agn which are found in liner galaxies may be typified by lower accretion rates than seyferts , assuming approximately the same efficiency of mass accretion .",
    "an interesting comparison can be made between the x - ray spectra of ngc  7213 and m81 , since m81 is the nearest liner galaxy and has been studied in detail using ( page 2003 ; page 2004 ) .",
    "the broad - band x - ray spectra of these two galaxies , at first glance , look remarkably similar , but whilst the continua are comparable we find substantial differences in the emission line parameters .",
    "the soft x - ray emission lines are less prominent in ngc  7213 than in m81 , and the emission from collisionally ionised thermal plasma components in ngc  7213 comprises a much smaller fraction of the total 0.3 - 10 kev flux than in m81 ( 0.3 per cent , compared with 8.7 per cent in m81 ) .",
    "emission lines arising in collisionally ionised plasma are not normally observed in seyfert galaxies . on the other hand",
    "the fe  i k@xmath1 line at 6.4 kev is commonly found in seyferts @xcite , and the equivalent width of this line is about twice as large in ngc  7213 as it is in m81 . therefore , although ngc  7213 contains the soft x - ray emission lines and fe  k@xmath1 lines of fe  xxv and fe  xxvi that are not usually observed in seyfert galaxies but are seen in the liner galaxy m81 , the relative weakness of these lines and the strength of fe  i  k@xmath1 in ngc  7213 make the x - ray spectrum of ngc  7213 much more seyfert - like than that of m81 . therefore ngc 7213 appears to bridge the gap between ` normal ' seyfert galaxies and liner galaxies such as m81 .",
    "it is likely then , that there is a continuous distribution of galaxy nuclei between the liners and ` normal ' seyfert nuclei , over which the x - ray spectral features characteristic of seyferts such as the neutral fe k@xmath1 line , become successively more prominent , while the features characteristic of liners such as soft x - ray emission lines diminish in significance .",
    "accretion rate onto the black hole with respect to the eddington rate is likely to be the overriding factor , with liner galaxies accreting at much lower rates than seyfert galaxies ( ho , filippenko & sargent 2003 ) and containing truncated discs .",
    "in fact , if we look at the observational properties of the galactic centre we find that it may also fit into this continuous distribution , at the opposite end of the scale to the seyferts .",
    "the galactic centre contains a low - mass black hole with an extremely low accretion rate ( @xmath32 , falcke & biermann 1999 ; quataert , narayan & reid 1999 ) and with a luminosity of @xmath33 .",
    "the emission from this region comes predominantly from thermal plasmas with strong soft x - ray emission ( baganoff 2003 ) . at higher energies fe k@xmath1 emission",
    "is observed ( tanaka 2000 ) , the strongest line being at 6.7 kev .",
    "therefore , the galactic centre begins the sequence : its characteristics being a very low @xmath34 ratio , dominance of thermal plasma emission and strong , highly ionised iron emission .",
    "the lack of reflection in ngc  7213 may provide a clue to the explanation of the low luminosities in liner galaxies .",
    "although there is a significant 6.4  kev line , the lack of reflection implies that this must arise in compton - thin material .",
    "thus the central region of ngc  7213 appears to be deficient in the dense , cool material that usually gives rise to reflection in seyferts . in m81 , which has an even lower luminosity than ngc  7213 , the 6.4",
    "kev line is only half as strong as it is in ngc  7213 , implying that the central regions of m81 are even more lacking in cool material than ngc  7213 . that liners have gas - poor central regions relative to seyferts has also been proposed by ho ( 2003 ) on the basis of their optical emission line properties .",
    "it therefore appears that the low luminosities and accretion rates of liner - agn are a consequence of the shortage of material in their central regions . in this case liners",
    "are simply fuel - starved agn , and could represent the weak , but not yet silent remnants that have evolved from a previous generation of seyferts and qsos .",
    "we present an  observation of the liner galaxy ngc  7213 with the epic and rgs x - ray instruments and uv photometry with the om .",
    "the x - ray spectrum is typical of a seyfert galaxy , although with a much lower luminosity ( @xmath35 erg s@xmath4 ) . a collisionally ionised thermal plasma of temperature 0.18@xmath36 kev is required in the rgs soft x - ray region where several low ionisation emission lines are detected , and we find no evidence for a significant blackbody - like soft - excess component .",
    "we suggest that this low ionisation thermal plasma may be a liner characteristic .",
    "we constrain the equivalent widths of fe i , xxv and xxvi k@xmath1 emission lines to 82@xmath2 , 24@xmath3 and 24@xmath2 ev respectively .",
    "the nuclear radiation at x - ray wavelengths in ngc  7213 is substantially more seyfert - like than the agn component in the nearby liner galaxy m81 , meaning ngc 7213 has the properties of a galaxy somewhere in between a typical seyfert and a liner galaxy .",
    "this supports the notion of continuity between the liner and seyfert classes , dictated by the luminosity of the central agn and its accretion rate , both increasing from liners to seyferts . in turn",
    ", the mass accretion rates depend critically on the amount of material present in the central regions surrounding the agn .",
    "this continuous distribution can be extended to include the galactic centre , which shares some properties with liner galaxies .",
    "this work is based on observations obtained with , an esa science mission with instruments and contributions directly funded by esa member states and the usa ( nasa ) .",
