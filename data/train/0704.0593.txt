    "it is well known that in dense dielectric materials the induced polarization @xmath4 alters the field strength @xmath5 acting on the constituents ( i.e. the local field ) compared to the average macroscopic field @xmath6 .",
    "macroscopic considerations show that in systems with high symmetry such as a cubic lattice the two fields are related to each other according to @xmath7 @xcite .",
    "this leads to the well - known clausius - mossotti relation for the permittivity @xmath8 @xmath9 where @xmath2 is the density and @xmath10 the polarizability of the oscillators .",
    "similar arguments hold for a purely magnetic material @xcite , except that the required densities are usually much higher due to the smallness of magnetic dipole moments and polarizabilities . in linear response",
    "@xmath10 is well described by a damped - oscillator model @xcite @xmath11 the corresponding ( real - valued ) parameters such as the oscillator strength @xmath12 , the resonance frequency and width , @xmath13 and @xmath14 , are determined by the microscopic model . in general",
    "the linewidth @xmath14 contains radiative as well as non - radiative contributions . for purely radiative interaction these parameters",
    "are strongly affected by the renormalization of energy levels and spontaneous emission processes caused by the interaction with the vacuum electromagnetic field in the medium @xcite . since the mode structure of the electromagnetic field inside a dense medium",
    "can be substantially modified compared to free space , one would expect that the polarizability entering eq.([eq : clausius - mossotti - dielectr ] ) is different from that in free space . in a macroscopic approach @xmath10",
    "is however an input function and no conclusion can be drawn about possible changes due to the different structure of the vacuum modes inside the medium . to take into account the modification of transition frequencies and radiative linewidth in a dense medium in a self - consistent way",
    "requires a microscopic approach .    in the present paper",
    "we develop a microscopic approach to local field effects in dense materials with simultaneous dielectric and magnetic response using greensfunction techniques similar to those used by devries and lagendijk for purely dielectric materials @xcite . to this end",
    "we consider an infinitely extended bi - cubic lattice of electric and magnetic point dipoles with isotropic response with a lattice constant small compared to the transition wavelength .",
    "we however do not make use of the assumptions made in @xcite to renormalize the singular self - interaction contributions to the lattice @xmath15-matrix which eliminated radiative contributions to linewidth and transition frequencies altogether .",
    "we show that instead the self - interaction contributions can be summed to yield the dressed @xmath16-matrix of an isolated oscillator interacting with the vacuum modes of the electromagnetic field in free space . in this way we derive clausius - mossotti relations for general ,",
    "radiatively broadened , isotropic magneto - dielectrica .",
    "apart from non - radiative broadenings , the electric and magnetic polarizabilities entering these equations are shown to be exactly those of free space .",
    "we then show that simultaneous local - field corrections to electric _ and _ magnetic fields in purely radiatively broadened magneto - dielectrica have a surprising and potentially important effect : for sufficiently large densities the real part of the refractive index saturates at the level of @xmath17 . at the same time , the imaginary part of the complex index approaches zero inversely proportional to the density . thus the medium becomes transparent and left - handed i.e. displays a negative index of refraction with low absorption .",
    "we start by developing a microscopic scattering approach to local - field effects in dielectric media taking into account possible material induced modifications of radiative linewidth and transition frequencies in a self - consistent way . to this end",
    "we consider a simple cubic lattice of electric point dipoles with isotropic bare polarizability @xmath18 @xmath19 where @xmath20 denote lattice vectors .",
    "the dipoles interact with the quantized electromagnetic field @xmath21 which obeys the vector helmholtz equation @xmath22 in the weak - excitation , i.e. linear response limit , the operator of the microscopic electric polarization @xmath23 has the form @xmath24 .",
    "solving eq.([eq : helmholtzediel ] ) we can determine the ( isotropic ) dispersion relation @xmath25 from which the permittivity @xmath8 can be extracted .",
    "in the linear response limit the solution of the quantum mechanical interaction problem can most easily be obtained by means of greensfunction techniques . in particular",
    "it is sufficient to calculate the scattering @xmath15-matrix of the oscillator lattice .",
    "the dispersion relation can then be obtained via @xcite @xmath26 the scattering @xmath15-matrix obeys a linear dyson equation @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the free - space retarded propagator of the electric field which is a solution to the classical vector helmholtz equation @xmath29 and @xmath30 is a linear , isotropic point vertex .",
    "note that integration over spatial variables was suppressed in eq.([eq : dyson ] ) for notational simplicity .    for a cubic lattice of isotropic scatterers",
    ", the series can be summed up to yield @xcite @xmath31 where @xmath32 stands for @xmath33 which due to the discrete translation invariance is independent on @xmath34 .",
    "the single - particle scattering @xmath16-matrix @xmath35 is determined by the bare polarizability @xcite @xmath36 note that @xmath37 is diagonal and isotropic . in eq.([eq : t - matrix ] ) we have separated the contribution of the lattice ( @xmath38 ) from the multiple scattering events at the same oscillator ( @xmath39 ) .",
    "this separation is crucial since @xmath39 is singular . rather than eliminating this singularity by a regularization procedure as done in @xcite , we note that expression ( [ eq : t - matrix ] ) gives the single - particle scattering @xmath16-matrix @xmath35 dressed by the interaction with the vacuum field in free space .",
    "this quantity is experimentally observable and is related to the single - particle polarizability @xmath10 in free space : @xmath40 @xmath18 on the other hand is not observable and thus only a theoretical notion . at this point other broadening mechanisms can be incorporated by adding appropriate non - radiative decay rates @xmath41 to the polarizability @xmath10 ( [ eq : alpha ] ) ( cf .",
    "equation ( [ eq : alpha ] ) and discussion thereafter ) .    obviously , for the radiative part separating the sum @xmath42 into @xmath43 does the trick of writing the full lattice @xmath15-matrix in terms of the _ known _ free space @xmath16-matrix . as a drawback",
    "we are left with the sum over the lattice vectors @xmath44 .",
    "unfortunately this sum can not be evaluated exactly and has to be treated approximately .    according to poisson s summation formula @xmath45 the sum over @xmath44",
    "can be expressed in terms of a real space integral and a sum over inverse lattice vectors @xmath46 of the fourier transform of the free space greensfunction @xmath47 @xmath48 here @xmath49 is some smooth function with @xmath50 and @xmath51 introduced to prevent the integral from touching the excluded singular point @xmath52 .    in the following we",
    "restrict the discussion to lattices with a lattice constant much smaller than the resonant wavelength , i.e. @xmath53 . in this limit",
    "the lattice of oscillators behaves essentially as a homogeneous medium .",
    "contributions from large @xmath46-vectors to the sum , which reflect the discreteness of the lattice , can be neglected as long as the singular contribution from the origin has been excluded .",
    "therefore we only keep the term @xmath54 and assume a gaussian cutting function @xmath55 , with @xmath56 .",
    "this yields @xmath57 where @xmath58 .",
    "apart from the gaussian @xmath59-integral which provides a smooth cut - off in reciprocal space , @xmath60 can be treated as a small parameter . that allows to carry out the integration analytically which in leading order of @xmath60 yields @xmath61 the free - space greentensor @xmath62 is given by @xcite @xmath63 with @xmath64 being a projector to directions orthogonal to @xmath65 .    with this",

    "it is interesting to consider the implications of the clausius mossotti relations for radiatively broadened media in the large density limit .",
    "let us first consider a purely dielectric medium and let us assume that the polarizability @xmath103 does not depend on the density , i.e. the medium is radiatively broadened . in this case one finds @xmath104 in the high - density limit and sufficiently close to resonance the response saturates at a value of @xmath17 with an imaginary part that vanishes as @xmath3 .",
    "at this point the medium becomes totally opaque since the index of refraction attains an imaginary value @xmath105 indicating the emergence of a stopping band .",

    "for small densities ( @xmath106 ) the resonance is centered at @xmath13 whereas for larger densities ( @xmath107 ) the response shifts to smaller frequencies and is amplified . eventually ( @xmath108 ) the refractive index becomes almost purely imaginary in which case light can not propagate any longer .",

    "independent application of clausius - mossotti local - field corrections to the permittivity and the permeability leads in the high density limit to @xmath111 thus in the spectral overlap region the real part of the index of refraction approaches the value @xmath17 , i.e. attains a constant negative value .",
    "furthermore the imaginary part , responsible for absorption losses , approaches zero in that spectral region as @xmath3 .",
    "this rather peculiar behavior is illustrated in the right column of fig.[fig1 ] .",
    "one clearly recognizes the emergence of a spectral region around the bare resonance frequency where the real part of the refractive index approaches @xmath17 while the imaginary part is strongly suppressed .",
    "negative refraction of light is currently one of the most active research areas in photonics @xcite due to fascinating potential applications such as superlensing @xcite or electromagnetic cloaking @xcite . in recent years",
    "substantial progress has been made in realizing negative refraction in so - called meta - materials @xcite .",
    "these are artificial periodic structures of electric and magnetic dipoles with a resonance wavelength much larger than the lattice constant which thus form a quasi - homogeneous magneto - dielectric medium . in order to achieve a large electromagnetic response , operation close to resonance",
    "is needed which is associated with rather substantial losses .",
    "the elimination of these losses represents one of the main challenges in the field @xcite .",
    "we have shown here that in a radiatively broadened medium , i.e. a medium in which density - dependent broadening mechanism can still be disregarded for sufficiently large densities , local field effects can provide a negative index of refraction and at the same time efficiently suppress absorption losses .",
    "in the present paper we have given a rigorous microscopic derivation of clausius - mossotti relations for both the electric and magnetic response in an isotropic , radiatively broadened magneto - dielectric medium formed by a simple bi - cubic lattice of electric and magnetic dipoles .",
    "as opposed to previous microscopic approaches we have taken into account possible modifications of the single - particle polarizabilities by the altered electromagnetic vacuum inside the medium in a self - consistent way . for a simple bi - cubic lattice",
    "it has been shown that the polarizabilities entering the clausius - mossotti relations are those of single oscillators interacting with the free - space vacuum field .",
    "we showed that as a consequence of the local field corrections a radiatively broadened medium with overlapping electric and magnetic resonances becomes lossless with a real part of the refractive index approaching the value @xmath17 in the high - density limit .",
    "the latter could provide an interesting avenue to construct artificial materials with negative refraction and low losses .",
