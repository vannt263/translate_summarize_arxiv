    "standard finite element methods ( fems ) for acoustic wave propagation are well known to exhibit the so - called _ pollution effect _ @xcite , which means that the stability and convergence of the scheme require a much smaller mesh - size than needed for a meaningful approximation of the wave by finite element functions . for an highly oscillatory wave at wave number @xmath0 , the typical requirement for a reasonable representation reads @xmath8 for the mesh - size @xmath2 , that is some fixed number of elements per wave - length .",
    "the standard galerkin fem typically requires at least @xmath9 where @xmath10 depends on the method and the stability and regularity properties of the continuous problem .",

    "a variant of that method appeared attractive where only the test functions are modified while standard finite element functions are used as trial functions . in this paper , we analyze that method and reformulate it as a stabilized @xmath1 method in the spirit of the variational multiscale method @xcite .",
