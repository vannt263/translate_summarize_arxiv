    "crystals are regular periodic physical systems with the atomic constituents organized in periodic arrays , where the periodicity is a characteristic of the crystal in its equilibrium configuration and a manifestation of long - range positional order .",
    "however , the effect of thermal fluctuations must be taken into consideration at finite temperatures where thermally excited lattice vibrations may degrade or destroy crystalline order . an early theoretical treatment developed by lindemann  @xcite examined the effect of lattice vibrations in a framework which neglected the correlations of atomic motions , but which nonetheless provides a reasonable description ( on an order of magnitude basis ) for the melting of three dimensional solids .",
    "a salient component of the lindemann analysis is the lindemann criterion where the melting of a solid is considered to have taken place when mean square deviations from equilibrium exceed a tenth of a lattice constant .",
    "x - ray diffraction data , which may provide a direct measure of long - range order in a crystal lattice ( and hence a means to determine temperatures where crystalline order is lost ) finds reasonable agreement  @xcite with the lindemann criterion .",
    "the accord is manifest in the finding that bragg peaks corresponding to broken translational symmetry vanish when mean square fluctuations from equilibrium ( also determined from an analysis of x - ray diffraction data ) are in the vicinity of a tenth of a lattice constant , as specified in the lindemann result .",
    "a factor of significance for the effectiveness of the lindemann criterion is the tendency for atoms in three dimensional crystals to have a large number of neighbors [ e.g. a dozen nearest neighbors in the face of face centered cubic ( fcc ) lattices ] .",
    "hence , mean field treatments in the spirit of weiss molecular mean field theory are more likely to provide a reasonable theoretical description since statistical fluctuations tend to suppressed somewhat by averaging when a relatively large number of neighbors are present .",
    "on the other hand , it should be understood that apart from the number of nearest neighbors , dimensionality is a very important parameter which may affect the thermodynamic characteristics and integrity of a crystal lattice to a large degree .",
    "nano - scale engineering often takes place in systems of low dimensionality such as carbon - nanotubes where the length may exceed the width by several orders of magnitude ; nanotubes tend to be regarded as one dimensional systems .",
    "graphene sheets , covalently bonded single layer honeycomb lattices of carbon atoms , may be considered genuine monolayers , and hence possess strongly two dimensional character .",
    "the thermodynamic stability of a system is strongly dependent on its dimensionality with statistical fluctuations becoming more important for two dimensional systems , and very important for essentially 1d structures such as nanotubes .",
    "an important theoretical result known as the mermin - wagner theorem  @xcite predicts that as the bulk limit is approached , thermal fluctuations destroy long - range crystalline order in the context of 1d lattices .",
    "however , this result does not preclude the stabilization of positional order for @xmath2 if the interaction between atomic members is long - ranged ( e.g. decaying as a power law in the separation between positions in the crystal lattice ) . in this work , it is our program to examine conditions which preserve long range order in low dimensional systems at finite temperatures .    in one dimension ,",
    "the deleterious effect of thermal fluctuations is felt most severely , and ultimately only short - range order exists if the interatomic interaction is finite in range . in three dimensions ,",
    "long - range positional order is intact for finite temperatures below the melting temperature @xmath4 .",
    "two dimensional solids are often regarded as an intermediate case where thermal fluctuations are strong enough to destroy long - range order as the size of the system is increased , but only in a very gradual manner .",
    "although crystalline order in 2d systems does not survive in the thermodynamic limit if the interaction is confined to nearest neighbors or is otherwise finite in range , a long - range coupling with power law decay may stabilize long - range positional order .",
    "in fact , even for one dimensional solids , we find a critical decay exponent @xmath1 below which crystalline order remains stable for @xmath2 , whereas long - range order is only gradually lost in the bulk for power law decays where @xmath5 .",
    "similarly , the corresponding exponent in 2d is @xmath3 , where long range crystalline order is preserved for @xmath6 , whereas thermal fluctuations destroy positional order if @xmath7 . within the bounds of numerical error",
    ", we obtain the same value for the threshold exponent @xmath8 for distinct lattice geometries including square lattices , triangular lattices , and honeycomb lattices .",
    "we examine various types of coupling schemes , including very short - ranged interactions where atoms interact with only a few nearest neighbors and perhaps also next - nearest neighbors .",
    "we also consider extended schemes where there is a finite coupling to all neighbors , but where the interaction is still short - ranged , with a rapid decay profile , such as that of an inter - atomic potential with an exponential dependence @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the finite length scale corresponding to the coupling scheme .",
    "finally , we also consider a long - ranged algebraically decaying coupling of the form @xmath11 where @xmath12 may assume different values , though for the energy per atom to be finite in the bulk limit , the exponent must exceed threshold values which depend on dimensionality of the lattice . for single dimensional systems , one must have @xmath13 and @xmath14 for two dimensional crystals .",
    "we report on a calculation of the atomic root mean square deviation @xmath15 about positions of equilibrium in 1d and 2d crystals . in section",
    "i , we discuss theoretical methods used to calculate the partition function and hence calculate salient thermodynamic quantities by decoupling the vibrational states used to gauge the integrity of long - range crystalline order such as @xmath15 . in section",
    "ii , we examine one dimensional systems , finding positional order to be destroyed except in a long - range coupling scheme , ( i.e. a power law dependence where the decay exponent @xmath12 must lie between @xmath16 and an upper bound exponent @xmath17 ) . in section iii , we perform a similar analysis for two dimensional square lattices , where we generalize to an extended scheme , and find a gradual destruction of crystalline order with increasing system size @xmath18 for short - ranged couplings . however , we find that a power law decay profile where @xmath19 is sufficient to maintain positional order at finite temperatures .",
    "in addition to the square lattice , in section iv we also examine triangular and honeycomb lattices , finding the ability of a long - range interaction between atoms to preserve crystalline order is not affected by the specific type of lattice geometry under consideration , and the threshold exponents in all three cases are identical within the bounds of error in the calculations .",
    "finally , in section v , we consider motion transverse to the plane of the crystal lattice for locally stiff dual layer systems where even if interaction between particles is taken to be long - ranged , we find the perpendicular motions rapidly compromise long - range order as the size of the system is increased .",
    "a salient component of our treatment is the explicit accounting for atomic motions in discrete systems .",
    "the harmonic approximation , which neglects anharmonic terms in the potential set up by geometric effects has been tested directly in the context of monte carlo simulations and found to be accurate to within one part in @xmath20 for the systems considered  @xcite .    since",
    "our interest is in equilibrium thermodynamic characteristics of the system , we begin with the lattice potential @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the number of neighbors corresponding to each atom in the system indexed with the label @xmath23 , and @xmath24 is the total number of particles contained in the crystal lattice .",
    "the factor of @xmath25 in the lattice potential expression is present to compensate for double counting of the energy associated with individual `` bonds '' between atomic pairs @xmath23 and @xmath26 .    for small deviations from equilibrium positions ,",
    "a `` harmonic approximation '' is possible , and one finds instead @xmath27 the first nonzero term of a taylor expansion of @xmath28 where @xmath29 , and @xmath30 is the second derivative of the potential @xmath28 at @xmath31 . in the results we report on here , we restrict attention to temperatures below those which would cause melting in the bulk ( determined by the lindemann criterion ) , where the harmonic approximation would tend to fare well .",
    "a primary issue of interest is whether there is any finite temperature range where long - range positional order is intact , and our calculations are in the context of temperatures not of the magnitude that would disrupt the bonding topology and create dislocations , but thermal regimes considerably below the temperature range which might begin to rupture bonds between neighbors . for covalent solids such as two dimensional sheets of graphene and carbon nanotubes where energies stored in covalent bonds are far in excess of @xmath32 at 300k , even room temperature",
    "may be considered a `` low '' temperature in the sense of being considerably below temperature scales where thermal fluctuations would perturb the local bonding scheme in a significant way .    in one dimension ,",
    "the bonds are collinear , and the potential will remain quadratic as the energies of all bonds between atoms are summed .",
    "however , in two dimensional geometries , restoring forces to oppose displacements from equilibrium will be exerted in different directions along distinct bond axes between an interacting pair of atoms . as a consequence",
    ", it will be necessary to make an additional harmonic approximation in order to obtain a quadratic hamiltonian and subsequently exploit translational invariance for the regular lattices we examine .",
    "in general , a bond length @xmath33 between atoms @xmath23 and @xmath26 will appear as @xmath34 where @xmath35 , @xmath36 , and @xmath37 .",
    "thus , the potential energy stored in the bonds depends only on the difference of coordinates such as , e.g. , @xmath38 for the equilibrium @xmath39 coordinate differences and @xmath40 for differences constructed from the corresponding shifts from equilibrium .",
    "if the latter are sufficiently small in relation to the former , it is appropriate to expand about @xmath38 , @xmath41 , @xmath42 , and to quadratic order one will have @xmath43 ^{2}$ ] where @xmath44 is a unit vector formed by subtracting the position vectors @xmath45 and @xmath46 corresponding to the atom @xmath23 and its neighbor @xmath26 , such that @xmath47 .",
    "hence , the atomic potential may be written to quadratic order in @xmath48 and @xmath49 , and one has in particular @xmath50^{2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] it will be necessary to solve an eigenvalue problem to decouple the vibrational modes .",
    "however , with fourier analysis , the problem may be reduced to the task of diagonalizing a @xmath51 matrix , a @xmath52 matrix in the case of a lattice with a honeycomb geometry , or at most a @xmath53 matrix for the case of the locally stiff dual - layer system , even in cases where the coupling scheme is extended to encompass many neighbors for each atomic member .",
    "we will consider systems in one dimension where we show that long - range crystalline order may be stabilized in the case of slowly decaying power law potentials , but not for localized exponentially decaying coupling schemes .",
    "we also examine two dimensional lattice geometries , and find similar phenomena ; again , a long - range power law decay is needed to preserve crystalline order at finite temperatures",
    ".    finally , we are careful to restrict motion to collinear displacements in the context of 1d systems and intraplanar motion for the two dimensional crystals .",
    "the lattices are very easily disturbed by transverse displacements , and we find that relaxing the collinear and coplanar restrictions in 1d and 2d yields mean square fluctuations which diverge rapidly with increasing system size @xmath24 . as we find with explicit calculation in section v , this rapid ( i.e. at a linear ) growth in @xmath24 occurs even if the interaction between atoms is a long - ranged power law decay in locally stiff dual layer crystal geometries .",
    "we use the results for the eigenvalues for the vibrational modes to calculate thermodynamic properties related to crystalline order such as the thermally averaged mean square fluctuations about equilibrium per site , @xmath15 .",
    "as noted elsewhere  @xcite and summarized here , the mean square displacements about equilibrium may be calculated in terms of the eigenvalues for the vibrational states .    in terms of the vibrational modes ,",
    "the lattice energy may be written as @xmath54 with @xmath55 the total number of particles contained in the lattice .",
    "the connection between the vibrational states and the mean square fluctuations is @xmath56 with the eigenvectors indexed with the label @xmath12 and using , e.g. , @xmath57 , to express the displacements in terms of the eigenvectors , one finds for a specific system configuration @xmath58\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in the thermal average , the factor @xmath59 will be as often positive as negative , and hence only in the case @xmath60 will there be a net contribution to the thermal average @xmath61 .",
    "if the vectors are taken to be normalized , one finds @xmath62 with the lattice energy expressed in this way , the partition function becomes of a product of gaussian integrals , @xmath63 where @xmath64 .",
    "finally , a thermal derivative of @xmath65 leads to @xmath66 hence , for the mean square deviation , we have @xmath67 the term in the radical is not temperature dependent , but is instead determined by characteristics of the lattice geometry and the bonding scheme between atomic members . in this work ,",
    "we calculate @xmath68 , a mean square rms deviation normalized with respect to temperature .",
    "zero eigenvalues are artifacts of the periodic boundary conditions , correspond to global translations of the lattice , and are excluded from the sum .",
    "in the 1d systems we consider , only longitudinal displacements are examined ; similarly , for the two dimensional geometries , lattice vibrations are considered to be confined to the two dimensional plane with no transverse motions considered .",
    "periodic boundary conditions are implemented in both the one and two dimensional cases .",
    "an important characteristic of systems in one dimension is the fact that all bonds are collinear , and hence there is no purely geometric source of anharmonic effects .",
    "the lattice potential energy will have the form @xmath69 since only longitudinal motions are considered , the label `` @xmath39 '' that would normally appear as a subscript on the `` @xmath70 '' symbols is suppressed .",
    "the sum recorded in eq .",
    "[ eq : eq5 ] is configured to avoid the redundant summation over bonds , and the counting `` 1/2 '' factor is not required . to maximize the number of neighbors coupled to any particular atom while avoiding multiple couplings to the same atom via the periodicity condition , we set @xmath71 and we always consider an odd number of atomic members .",

    ". one merit of obtaining the vibrational density of states is the fact that it may be computed in the thermodynamic limit without encountering divergences with the aid of monte carlo sampling .",
    "on the other hand , the divergence or convergence of the mean square deviations will be signaled by specific signatures in the low eigenvalue regime of the density of states without the need for an extrapolation to the thermodynamic limit .    in the case",
    "where interactions are confined to nearest neighbors , the eigenvalues @xmath77 have the simple form @xmath78 .",

    ". for relatively small system sizes , @xmath15 changes quite slowly with increasing @xmath24",
    ". however , ultimately the rms fluctuations begin to grow more rapidly and eventually the size of the plateau where the mean square fluctuations expand slowly is slightly broader for small values of the decay exponent @xmath12 , and somewhat abbreviated for the more rapidly decaying coupling where @xmath230 . the latter is closer to what one would find in covalently bonded ( but non - polar ) systems such as graphene where van der waals interactions decreasing with the sixth power of the inter - atomic separation constitute the main source of long - range attraction between particles .",

    "for inherently long - ranged interactions scaling as power laws in the distance between interacting atoms , the divergence is much slower for @xmath232 , while crystalline order is intact even at finite temperatures if @xmath233 .    for two dimensional crystals , we find the same essential phenomena with respect to thermodynamic stability of the crystal for square , triangular , and honeycomb lattices . for the latter two , thermal fluctuations destroy long - range crystalline order at finite temperatures , but",
    "the divergence in @xmath68 occurs very slowly with increasing system size . on the other hand ,",
    "rms deviations decay rapidly for simple square lattices where only nearest neighbor couplings are active .",
    "however , an extended coupling scheme to both nearest and next - nearest neighbors considerably mitigates the effect of thermal fluctuations on crystalline order , and the resulting slow divergence is quantitatively similar to that seen in the triangular and honeycomb lattices where the coupling is confined entirely to nearest - neighbors .",
    "when we extend the coupling to many neighbors , but still implement a short - ranged coupling ( e.g. an exponential decay with the range set by the inverse decay rate @xmath10 ) , we find qualitatively the same results as for the square lattice with couplings both to nearest and next - nearest neighbors , as well as the triangular and hexagonal lattices in atomic members only interact with nearest neighbors with @xmath80 scaling linearly with @xmath124 .",
    "however , the slope of the linear dependence becomes smaller as @xmath97 is decreased , as a longer - ranged coupling is more effective at suppressing the effects of thermal fluctuations . as in the case of systems in 1d , a longer range coupling in the form of a power law can maintain long - range crystalline order for @xmath2 if the decay exponent does not exceed @xmath234 .",
    "allowing thermally induced fluctuations perpendicular to the lattice causes a rapid divergence ( i.e. linear ) of the rms deviations with the system size , even if the lattice geometry is dual - layered in an extended scheme to provide local stiffness .",
    "the growth of @xmath235 is asymptotically linear even if the coupling between sites is long - ranged , decaying as a power law .",
