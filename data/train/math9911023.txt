    "witten and yau @xcite have recently considered the generalization of the celebrated ads / cft correspondence to the case of a complete @xmath3-dimensional einstein manifold @xmath4 of negative ricci curvature with a compact conformal ( in the sense of penrose ) boundary @xmath0 of dimension @xmath5 .",
    "( in the simplest case , @xmath4 is a hyperbolic space , and @xmath0 is the standard sphere . ) it can be shown that the relevant conformal field theory on @xmath0 is stable if the scalar curvature @xmath6 of @xmath0 is positive , but not if @xmath6 can be negative . when @xmath7 , stability is more delicate ; the theory is stable in some cases , but not in the others . witten and yau @xcite show that if @xmath6 is positive , then @xmath4 and @xmath0 have several physically desirable properties : the boundary @xmath0 is connected , and @xmath4 is free of wormholes .",
    "furthermore , the topology of @xmath0 exerts a strong influence on that of @xmath4 ( the fundamental group of @xmath4 is no `` larger '' than that of @xmath0 ) .",
    "we wish to ask whether similar statements are valid when @xmath7 but the conformal field theory on @xmath0 is still stable .",
    "first , suppose that @xmath0 is such that the conformal structure can be perturbed so that the scalar curvature becomes positive everywhere ; it is obvious that the witten - yau conclusions then hold . _",
    "therefore , the only non - trivial case is the one in which such perturbations are not possible .",
    "_ we shall say in the latter case that @xmath0 is _ rigidly _ scalar - flat . to summarize , then , the _ rigidly _ scalar - flat boundaries are the only cases in which the difficulties discussed by witten and yau could possibly arise .    for the benefit of physically oriented readers",
    ", we can expand on this crucial point as follows .",
    "let @xmath0 be any scalar - flat compact manifold .",
    "let @xmath8 be a point in @xmath0 , and perturb the metric slightly ( but _ not _ conformally ) so that the scalar curvature at @xmath8 is an arbitrarily small positive number .",
    "this perturbation can give rise to two possibilities : either it maintains @xmath9 everywhere on @xmath0 , or it does not .",
    "( that is , in the second case , @xmath0 is such that the scalar curvature _ must _ become negative at some other point if it becomes positive at @xmath8 . ) in the latter case we say that @xmath0 is _ rigidly scalar flat _ , while in the former it is non - rigid .",
    "now suppose that @xmath0 is _ not _ rigidly scalar - flat , and that we slightly perturb as above so that @xmath9 everywhere , and @xmath10",
    ". then according to a theorem of kazdan and warner @xcite , by means of a conformal deformation of the metric we can force the scalar curvature to be positive _ everywhere_. ( recall that the metric on @xmath0 is in any case only defined modulo conformal factors , so this procedure changes nothing physical . )",
    "but now we apply the result of witten and yau @xcite .",
    "_ we conclude that the results of witten and yau are valid even when @xmath7 , provided that @xmath0 is _ not _ rigidly scalar - flat_.    at this point it is clear that we need two things : first , a way of distinguishing compact rigidly scalar - flat manifolds from those which are not rigid ; and second , a way of extending the results of witten and yau to the rigid case .",
    "the objective of this work is to supply the first of these .",
    "our results essentially state that , given the truth of the gromov - lawson - rosenberg conjecture , compact , locally irreducible , rigidly scalar flat @xmath1 manifolds have structures which are very special and can be described very precisely .",
    "we hope that this precise description of these manifolds will facilitate a completion of the witten - yau results .",
    "the reader will notice in particular that the fundamental group of @xmath0 is severely constrained : it must be a cyclic group of low order .",
    "presumably this has important consequences for @xmath4 . on a less conjectural note ,",
    "manifolds _ not _ in the lists given in theorem [ br6 ] below are ( given certain easily verified conditions ) _ not _ rigidly scalar flat .",
    "thus , for example , the familiar six - dimensional calabi - yau quintic in @xmath11 is obviously scalar - flat , but it is not rigidly scalar flat : so the witten - yau conclusions are valid in this case . *",
    "motivation : geometry . *",
    "henceforth we consider only smooth , closed and compact manifolds .",
    "as above , a scalar - flat riemannian manifold is called _ rigidly scalar - flat _ if it accepts no metric of positive scalar curvature .",
    "the manifold is `` rigid '' in the sense that if a scalar - flat metric is perturbed so that the scalar curvature becomes positive at some point , then it must become negative at some other point . a basic theorem of bourguignon ( * ? ? ?",
    "* corollary 4.49 ) states that for a rigidly scalar - flat manifold the space of ricci - flat metrics coincides with the space of scalar - flat metrics .",
    "we recall a well - known fact : that all closed manifolds ( of dimension at least three ) are divided into the following three classes ( see @xcite ) :    1 .",
    "manifolds accepting a positive scalar curvature metric ; 2 .",
    "manifolds accepting a non - negative scalar curvature metric , but not accepting a positive scalar curvature metric ; 3 .",
    "manifolds not accepting a metric of a non - negative scalar curvature .",
    "it follows from @xcite that the class of rigidly scalar - flat manifolds is nothing but the class * ( z)*. our objective in this paper is to study and emphasize general properties of rigidly scalar - flat manifolds .",
    "since these manifolds are necessarily ricci - flat , it follows from the cheeger - gromoll theorem that they have the structure @xmath12 where @xmath13 is a flat torus , and @xmath14 is a finite group and so is the fundamental group of @xmath15 . by the work of gromov - lawson @xcite , @xmath16 is rigidly scalar - flat if and only if @xmath15 is rigidly scalar - flat , so we see that the study of the structure of compact rigidly scalar - flat manifolds reduces to understanding the behavior of the rigidity condition under _ finite _ coverings and quotients .",
    "it is therefore natural to begin by removing the toral factor .",
    "we shall consider manifolds which are compact and _ locally irreducible_. that is , the universal riemannian cover is not isometric to a product of lower - dimensional manifolds . if @xmath17 , this eliminates the toral factor , and forces the fundamental group @xmath18 to be finite .",
    "in addition , we assume that all manifolds we consider are oriented .    when the manifold is simply connected , and @xmath19 , there are two very different cases :    1 .",
    "@xmath0 is not a @xmath1 manifold , 2 .",
    "@xmath0 is a @xmath1 manifold .    in the first case",
    "the work of gromov - lawson @xcite implies that there are no rigidly scalar - flat manifolds , since a simply connected non-@xmath1 manifold ( with @xmath19 ) always accepts a metric of positive scalar curvature . in",
    "the @xmath1 case stolz theorem @xcite says that @xmath0 ( again , if @xmath19 ) does not accept a positive scalar curvature metric if and only if @xmath20 in the real @xmath21-theory @xmath22 . here ,",
    "recall that @xmath23 is the index of the dirac operator valued in the real @xmath21-theory . in dimensions equal to a multiple of @xmath24 we use the notation @xmath25 instead of @xmath23 .",
    "according to besse , an @xmath5-dimensional locally irreducible riemannian manifold has _",
    "holonomy if its restricted holonomy group is isomorphic to @xmath26 , or to @xmath27 , if it is locally khlerian .",
    "otherwise it has _ special _ holonomy .",
    "it was observed by futaki @xcite that stolz theorem implies that a rigidly scalar - flat compact @xmath1 simply connected manifold has special holonomy .",
    "but besse emphasizes that such manifolds are einstein , and , of course , a scalar - flat einstein manifold is ricci - flat .",
    "thus we see that bourguignon s theorem should be understood in terms of the concept of special holonomy .",
    "we believe that this phenomenon underlies bourguignon s theorem in general : that is , locally irreducible rigidly scalar - flat compact manifolds are ricci - flat * because * they have special holonomy .",
    "that is , we conjecture    [ weakbesse1](weak besse conjecture ) every locally irreducible rigidly scalar - flat compact manifold has special holonomy .",
    "besse mentions @xcite the possibility that _ all _ locally irreducible compact ricci - flat manifolds have special holonomy .",
    "we call this statement besse s conjecture .",
    "we emphasize that we consider here @xmath1 manifolds . now",
    "as a guide to deciding what one can reasonably expect to prove , we have    [ br1 ] let @xmath0 be a compact locally irreducible rigidly scalar - flat @xmath1 manifold , of dimension @xmath28 .",
    "suppose either that +    [ cols= \" < , < \" , ]      + then @xmath0 is a counter - example to the gromov - lawson - rosenberg conjecture .    before proving lemma [ br1 ] , we briefly recall a few things .",
    "let @xmath29 be a finite group ; then a classifying map @xmath30 defines the element @xmath31\\in \\omega^{spin}_n(b\\pi)$ ] , where @xmath32 is the @xmath1 cobordism theory .",
    "then @xmath23 is the composition @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the atiyah - bott - shapiro map , and @xmath35 is the assembly map ; see @xcite for details .",
    "the @xmath21-theory groups @xmath36 and the assembly map @xmath35 are well - understood when @xmath37 is a finite group ; see @xcite .",
    "in particular , the group @xmath38 and the invariant @xmath39 may be described as follows . since @xmath40 is a finite group",
    ", we consider the universal cover @xmath41 .",
    "a @xmath1 structure on @xmath0 ( let @xmath42 ) lifts to @xmath43 , and gives the dirac operator @xmath34 on @xmath43 , which commutes with the action of the clifford algebra @xmath44 and the deck - transformations of @xmath37 .",
    "this turns the kernel @xmath45 of the dirac operator @xmath34 into a module over the algebra @xmath46 , where @xmath47 is the real group ring of @xmath37 .",
    "let @xmath48 be the natural inclusion , and let @xmath49 be the corresponding grothendieck group .",
    "then the invariant @xmath39 is nothing but the residue class of @xmath45 in the corresponding @xmath21-theory : @xmath50\\in { \\mathfrak g}({{\\mathcal c}\\ell}_n \\otimes { { \\mathbf r}}\\pi)/i^*{\\mathfrak g}({{\\mathcal c}\\ell}_{n+1 } \\otimes { { \\mathbf r}}\\pi)=   ko_n({{\\mathbf r}}\\pi)= ko_n ( c^*_r\\pi).\\ ] ] thus the @xmath21-theory @xmath51 is `` assembled '' out of regular @xmath52-groups , parametrized by representations of @xmath37 .",
    "in particular , if @xmath20 it means that there exists a harmonic spinor on @xmath43 . taking into account that the gromov - lawson - rosenberg conjecture fails for non - finite fundamental groups , we state it in the following form :    ( gromov - lawson - rosenberg conjecture ) a compact @xmath1 manifold @xmath0 with @xmath53 and finite fundamental group",
    "does not accept a positive scalar curvature metric if and only if @xmath20 .    under the conditions of lemma [ br1 ] a manifold @xmath0 is compact , locally irreducible , and ricci - flat ,",
    "so @xmath18 is finite .",
    "thus the gromov - lawson - rosenberg conjecture predicts under these circumstances that rigidity implies @xmath20 .",
    "* proof of lemma [ br1 ] .",
    "case ( a ) * assume @xmath0 is not a counter - example .",
    "then @xmath20 , and @xmath0 admits a parallel spinor , and so it follows from futaki s paper ( * ? ? ?",
    "* proposition 2.3 ) that the holonomy must be special .",
    "now a compact @xmath1 manifold of dimension @xmath54 multiple of @xmath24 always has @xmath55 except in dimensions @xmath56 and @xmath57 .",
    "there are no scalar - flat locally irreducible manifolds of special holonomy in odd dimensions other than @xmath58 ( by the berger - simon theorem ( see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* chapter 10 ) ) and the fact that scalar - flat symmetric spaces are flat ) . finally , it follows from @xcite that a ( compact , orientable ) scalar - flat locally irreducible manifold of special holonomy in dimension @xmath57 is necessarily of holonomy @xmath59 .",
    "note that this is the _ full _ holonomy group , not just its identity component , even if @xmath0 is not simply connected .",
    "the point here is that this is a special property of dimensions @xmath60 multiple of @xmath24 .",
    "if we say that the _ restricted _ holonomy group of a manifold is @xmath61 or @xmath62 , this _ does not mean _ that it is a complex manifold .",
    "but in dimension @xmath63 , if the _ restricted _ holonomy is @xmath64 , then the manifold _ has to be a khler manifold_. the paper @xcite discusses this issue in detail .",
    "such a manifold , whether it is simply connected or not , is a complex manifold ( see @xcite ) , and by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 1 ) and the main result of @xcite , the space of harmonic spinors ( which coincides with the space of parallel spinors in our case since the manifolds are ricci - flat ) , has complex dimension @xmath65 .",
    "recall ( see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* chapter iii ,  10 ) that in dimension @xmath65 the index of the dirac operator @xmath34 is nothing but @xmath66 ( mod 2 ) since @xmath67 .",
    "bott periodicity gives the same fact for all dimensions @xmath57 .",
    "this would complete the proof in the case when the original manifold @xmath0 is simply connected , so that @xmath68 .",
    "however , this case is very special due to ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 1 ) .",
    "indeed , the dimension of the space of harmonic spinors is equal to @xmath65 even after factorization by a finite group . in particular , it means that for any finite group @xmath37 acting holomorphically on a khler manifold @xmath43 ( the universal cover of @xmath0 ) , the kernel @xmath69 is always a trivial @xmath47-module .",
    "thus @xmath55 .",
    "so we have a contradiction in case ( a ) .    * case ( b ) . * if @xmath20 then , again , the holonomy group is special . but",
    "a ricci - flat compact locally irreducible @xmath1 manifold of special holonomy with @xmath70 a multiple of @xmath24 * must * have a cyclic fundamental group by the theorem of b. mcinnes @xcite .",
    "again , we have a contradiction . @xmath71    [ br2 ] let @xmath0 be a compact locally irreducible rigidly scalar - flat @xmath1 manifold with @xmath53",
    ". then @xmath0 belongs to * exactly * one of the following classes .",
    "1 .   @xmath55 , and yet @xmath0 has a finite fundamental group and admits no metric of positive scalar curvature .",
    "that is , @xmath0 violates the gromov - lawson - rosenberg conjecture .",
    "@xmath0 has @xmath72 , and @xmath18 is finite cyclic .    *",
    "* in view of lemma [ br1 ] , we only need to prove that the two classes are disjoint . however , it is known @xcite that the gromov - lawson - rosenberg conjecture is valid when @xmath18 is finite cyclic .",
    "hence no rigidly scalar - flat @xmath1 manifold can belong to both classes .",

    "[ br5 ] let  @xmath0  be any compact locally irreducible  @xmath1  manifold with @xmath53 , @xmath75 and @xmath20 .",

    "these manifolds belong to the class * ( n)*. there are many examples of manifolds like this , for instance , hitchin s exotic spheres @xcite , or brard - bergery s nine - dimensional example with @xmath76 ; see @xcite .",
    "theorem [ br2 ] means that compact locally irreducible rigidly scalar - flat @xmath1 manifolds fall into two disjoint classes : the exotic class ( i ) , and the class ( ii ) . about the class ( i ) we can say little , except that we do not believe it is nonempty . about class ( ii ) ,",
    "by contrast , we can say a great deal .",
    "we introduce some notation .",

    "@xmath0 is a calabi - yau manifold , that is , has holonomy @xmath83 .",
    "when @xmath5 is a multiple of @xmath24 , such a manifold must be simply connected ( see @xcite ) , complex and ricci - flat . by bochner theory ,",
    "any holomorphic form is parallel , hence @xmath83-invariant . by the representation theory of @xmath83",
    ", this means that there can be no non - zero holomorphic form other than a complex volume form and its constant multiples .",
    "as @xmath0 is simply connected and ricci flat , the canonical bundle is trivial , so a complex volume form does indeed exist .",

    "@xmath0 is @xmath98 , @xmath88 , where @xmath99 is hyperkhler .",
    "it is well known that compact hyperkhler manifolds are simply connected complex manifolds ( see @xcite ) . as the holonomy group of @xmath99 is @xmath100 , and as any holomorphic form must be @xmath100-invariant , the complex symplectic form must be unique up to constant multiples . finally , 4 .",
    "@xmath0 could be @xmath85-dimensional manifold with holonomy @xmath89 .",
    "joyce @xcite shows that the betti numbers satisfy the given relation .      1 .",
    "let @xmath0 be a compact simply connected complex manifold with no non - zero holomorphic form other than a complex volume form @xmath79 . since @xmath0 is khlerian and @xmath79 trivializes the canonical bundle , yau s theorem @xcite gives us a ricci - flat khler metric on @xmath0 . as @xmath79 is the only non - zero holomorphic form , @xmath0 is irreducible , and so its holonomy is @xmath83 .",
    "2 .   let @xmath101 .",
    "as above , @xmath78 has holonomy @xmath83 , but since the generator of @xmath86 does not act holomorphically , @xmath0 is not a khler manifold , and so its holonomy group is not @xmath83 . as @xmath78 is simply connected , @xmath76 so the holonomy group has precisely @xmath65 components .",
    "a straightforward exercise in lie theory shows that the only two - component subgroup of @xmath26 which has @xmath83 as identity component ( and which is not contained in @xmath27 ) is @xmath102 , where the generator of @xmath86 acts by complex conjugation .",
    "3 .   if the manifold is khlerian , and if @xmath103 is the complex symplectic form , @xmath104 trivializes the canonical bundle , so by yau s theorem @xmath80 admits a ricci - flat khler metric .",
    "since @xmath103 is unique up to multiples , the holonomy group is @xmath100 . by an averaging argument combined with the calabi uniqueness theorem ( see @xcite for details )",
    "one can assume that the metric projects to @xmath93 , which becomes a khler manifold with @xmath100 as the restricted holonomy group .",
    "thus the holonomy group is @xmath105 for some @xmath106 . since a @xmath80 manifold",
    "is simply connected , @xmath107 , so there is a homomorphism from @xmath94 onto @xmath108 ( we can assume that @xmath106 is even without loss of generality ) .",
    "thus @xmath109 divides @xmath110 , which is odd , so @xmath109 is odd ; hence the holonomy group is actually @xmath111 .",
    "now suppose @xmath112 , and let @xmath113 .",
    "then @xmath114 is a @xmath115-fold covering of @xmath93 , and so its full holonomy group is precisely @xmath100 . now let @xmath116 generate @xmath94 , so @xmath117 is a non - trivial fixed - point - free holomorphic map generating @xmath118 . since @xmath119 , @xmath117 preserves @xmath103 and all of its powers .",
    "but by the representation theory of @xmath100 ( see @xcite ) @xmath103 and its powers are the _ only _ non - zero holomorphic forms on @xmath80 . since all these forms are of _ even _ degree , the holomorphic lefschetz number of @xmath117 is non - zero , which is impossible .",
    "thus actually @xmath120 and we have that @xmath121 .",
    "4 .   let @xmath0 be as described .",

    "it remains only to prove that these manifolds are @xmath1 .",
    "for this , observe that _",
    "when @xmath5 is a multiple of @xmath24 _ , the preimage of @xmath102 in @xmath126 is @xmath127 , so @xmath128 is a subgroup of @xmath126 .",
    "thus if @xmath129 is a bundle of orthonormal frames with @xmath124 as structural group , we can define @xmath130 the corresponding _ full _ bundle of orthonormal frames .",

    "<S> witten and yau ( hep - th/9910245 ) have recently considered a generalisation of the ads / cft correspondence , and have shown that the relevant manifolds have certain physically desirable properties when the scalar curvature of the boundary is positive . </S>",
    "<S> it is natural to ask whether similar results hold when the scalar curvature is zero . with this motivation , we study compact scalar flat manifolds which do not accept a positive scalar curvature metric . </S>",
    "<S> we call these manifolds rigidly scalar - flat </S>",
    "<S> . we study this class of manifolds in terms of special holonomy groups . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , we prove that if , in addition , a rigidly scalar flat manifold @xmath0 is @xmath1 with @xmath2 , then @xmath0 either has a finite cyclic fundamental group , or it must be a counter example to gromov - lawson - rosenberg conjecture . </S>"
