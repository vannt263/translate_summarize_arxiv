    "in biology , many microscopic organisms ( bacteria , amoebae , endothelial cells , ... ) or even social insects ( like ants ) interact through the phenomenon of chemotaxis @xcite .",
    "these organisms deposit a chemical ( pheromone , smell , food , ... ) that has an attractive effect on the organisms themselves . therefore ,",
    "in addition to their diffusive motion , they move preferentially along the gradient of concentration of the chemical they secrete ( chemotactic flux ) .",
    "when chemotactic attraction prevails over diffusion , this process can lead to a `` chemotactic collapse '' ( see @xcite for a review ) resulting in the aggregation of the organisms . in this way",
    ", some structures can form like clusters ( clumps ) or even network patterns ( filaments ) . therefore , the chemotactic interaction can explain several features of the morphogenesis of biological colonies .",
    "the chemotactic aggregation of biological populations is usually described in terms of the keller - segel model @xcite .",
    "this is a parabolic model consisting in two coupled differential equations .",
    "the first equation is a drift - diffusion equation describing the evolution of the concentration of cells and the second equation is a reaction - diffusion equation with terms of source and degradation describing the evolution of the concentration of the secreted chemical .",
    "this model ignores inertial effects and assumes that the drift velocity of the organisms is directly induced by a chemotactic `` force '' proportional to the concentration gradient of the chemical .",
    "the keller - segel model can reproduce the formation of clusters ( clumps ) by chemotactic collapse [ 4 - 19 ] .",
    "this reflects experiments on bacteria like _ escherichia coli _ or amoebae like _ dictyostelium discodeum _ exhibiting pointwise concentration @xcite .",
    "however , parabolic models fail at describing the formation of network patterns ( filaments ) .",
    "these filaments are observed in experiments of capillary blood vessels formation @xcite .",
    "they correspond to the spontaneous self - organization of endothelial cells during vasculogenesis , a process occuring during embryologic development . in order to account for these structures , more general models of chemotaxis",
    "have been introduced @xcite .",
    "they have the form of hydrodynamic ( hyperbolic ) models taking into account inertial effects .",
    "these models can reproduce the formation of filaments that are interpreted as the beginning of a vasculature .",
    "this phenomenon is responsible of angiogenesis , a major factor for the growth of tumors @xcite .",
    "interestingly , these filaments share some analogies with the large - scale structures in the universe that are described by similar hydrodynamic equations @xcite .",
    "recently , we have introduced a general kinetic model of chemotactic aggregation based on generalized stochastic processes , non linear mean field fokker - planck equations and generalized thermodynamics @xcite . from these kinetic equations ,",
    "we have derived a hydrodynamic model of the form @xmath0 @xmath1 @xmath2 it involves a pressure force @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is a barotropic equation of state that can take into account several effects like anomalous diffusion or the fact that the particles do not interpenetrate .",

    "the hydrodynamic equations ( [ intro1])-([intro5 ] ) or ( [ intro6])-([intro10 ] ) involving a barotropic equation of state , a long - range potential of interaction and a friction force , have been introduced by chavanis @xcite at a general level .",
    "it was indicated that they could provide generalized models of chemotaxis and self - gravitating brownian particles .    the main difference between the chemotactic model ( [ intro1])-([intro5 ] ) and the gravitational model ( [ intro6])-([intro10 ] ) concerns the field equations ( [ intro3 ] ) and ( [ intro8 ] ) . in astrophysics ,",
    "the gravitational potential is determined instantaneously from the density of particles through the poisson equation ( [ intro8 ] ) . in biology ,",
    "the equation ( [ intro3 ] ) determining the evolution of the chemical is more complex and involves memory terms .",
    "the chemical diffuses with a diffusion coefficient @xmath19 , is produced by the organisms at a rate @xmath20 and is degraded at a rate @xmath21 . because of the term @xmath22 , the concentration of the chemical at time @xmath23 depends on the concentration of the organisms at earlier times . in this paper",
    ", we shall consider simplified models where the term @xmath22 can be neglected .",
    "this is valid in a limit of large diffusivity of the chemical @xmath24 @xcite .",

    ", we perform a detailed linear dynamical stability analysis of the chemotactic model ( [ intro1])-([intro3 ] ) . specifically , we study the stability of an infinite and homogeneous distribution of cells against chemotactic collapse .",
    "this is similar to the classical jeans stability analysis for the barotropic euler - poisson system @xcite .",
    "indeed , the `` chemotactic collapse '' of biological populations is similar to the `` gravitational collapse '' in astrophysics ( jeans instability ) .",
    "there are , however , two main differences with the classical jeans analysis .",
    "the first difference is the presence of a friction force @xmath5 in the euler equation .",
    "as we shall see , this does not change the onset of the instability but this affects the evolution of the perturbation .",
    "the second difference arises from the different nature of the field equations ( [ intro3 ] ) and ( [ intro8 ] ) .",
    "we recall that , in gravitational dynamics , an infinite and homogeneous distribution of matter with @xmath42 and @xmath43 is _ not _ a stationary solution of the barotropic euler - poisson system ( [ intro6])-([intro8 ] ) because we can not satisfy simultaneously the condition of hydrostatic equilibrium @xmath44 reducing to @xmath45 and the poisson equation @xmath46 .",
    "this leads to an inconsistency in the mathematical analysis when studying the linear dynamical stability of such a distribution : this is called the `` jeans swindle '' @xcite .",
    "is replaced by an equation of the form @xmath47 where the density @xmath48 is replaced by the deviation @xmath49 to the mean density @xcite .",
    "then , an infinite and homogeneous distribution of matter with @xmath50 and @xmath51 is a steady state of the equations of motion from which we can develop a rigorous stability analysis .",
    "the expansion of the universe introduces a sort of neutralizing background in the poisson equation .",
    "interestingly , the same effect arises in the chemotactic model ( [ intro11 ] ) for a completely different reason .",
    "note finally that , in early models of cosmology , some authors including einstein himself have modified the gravitational poisson equation to the form @xmath52 by including a shielding term @xcite .",
    "this transformation was done in order to obtain a static homogenous and isotropic universe .",
    "as we have seen , a similar shielding effect arises naturally in the chemotactic model ( [ intro12 ] ) due to the degradation of the chemical .",

    "we make a complete study of both stable and unstable modes but we restrict ourselves to the simplified models ( [ intro11 ] ) and ( [ intro12 ] ) . in the `` newtonian model '' ( [ intro11 ] ) ,",
    "the only difference with the jeans analysis is the presence of the friction force @xmath57 . in the `` yukawa model '' ( [ intro12 ] ) ,",

    "more precisely , we determine the growth rate of the unstable modes and the damping rate , and oscillation frequency , of the stable modes as a function of @xmath57 and @xmath41 . owing to the above mentioned analogy between chemotaxis and gravity",

    "the main differences between the chemotactic problem and the jeans problem are due to the presence of ( i ) a friction force @xmath5 in the euler equation ( [ intro2 ] ) and ( ii ) a shielding length @xmath306 in the equation ( [ intro3 ] ) determining the potential of interaction ( played here by the concentration of the secreted chemical ) .",

    "we have found that the shielding length present in the chemotactic model solves many problems inherent to the jeans analysis .",
    "indeed , there is _ no jeans swindle _ in the chemotactic problem and the maximum growth rate occurs for a _ finite _ wavelength ( when @xmath40 ) instead of an infinite wavelength ( when @xmath34 ) .",
    "therefore , the mathematical problem of linear dynamical stability is better posed in biology than in astrophysics since it avoids the jeans swindle .",
    "the linear stability analysis performed in this paper gives the condition of instability ( in sec .",

    "when the condition of instability ( [ intro7ht ] ) is fulfilled , the perturbation grows until the system can no longer be described by equilibrium or near equilibrium equations .",
    "therefore , the next step is to study the chemotactic collapse in the nonlinear regime to see the formation of patterns like clusters and filaments . a large number of studies in applied mathematics ( see the extensive list of references given in the review @xcite ) and physics @xcite have considered the overdamped limit of the model ( [ intro1])-([intro3 ] ) leading to the keller - segel model ( [ intro4])-([intro5 ] ) , similar to the smoluchowski - poisson system ( [ intro9])-([intro10 ] ) . for this parabolic model , chemotactic",
    "collapse leads to the formation of round clusters .",
    "the evolution of an individual cluster in the nonlinear regime can be studied by considering spherically symmetric solutions of the keller - segel model .",
    "the standard keller - segel model ( [ eos3 ] ) leads to the formation of dirac peaks ( for @xmath332 ) @xcite . in the regularized model ( [ eos11 ] ) ,",
    "the dirac peaks are replaced by smooth aggregates @xcite .",
    "these aggregates interact with each other and lead to a coarsening process where the number of clusters @xmath333 decays with time as they collapse to each other .",
    "this process may share some analogies with the aggregation of vortices in two - dimensional turbulence @xcite .",
    "we expect that the decay of the number of clusters depends on the effective range of interaction mediated by the chemical @xmath306 ( shielding length ) .",
    "if the shielding length is small the clusters do not `` see '' each other and the decay of @xmath333 should be slowed down or even stopped . in that case , we obtain a quasi stationary state made of clusters separated from each other by a distance of the order of the shielding length @xmath306 .",
    "if we take into account inertial effects , using the hyperbolic model ( [ intro1])-([intro3 ] ) instead of the parabolic model ( [ intro4])-([intro5 ] ) , the collection of isolated clusters is replaced by a network pattern with nodes ( clusters ) separated by chords @xcite .",
    "the filaments between two nodes have a length of the order of @xmath306 .",
    "again , the number of nodes should decay with time .",
    "however , if the shielding length @xmath306 is small , the evolution is slowed down and we get a quasi equilibrium state with a filamentary structure corresponding to the initiation of a vasculature @xcite ."
