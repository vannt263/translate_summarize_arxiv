    "we consider a two - way relay channel ( trc ) , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : trc_gau ] ( a ) . nodes 1 and 2 want to exchange messages with each other , and a relay node facilitates the communication between them .",
    "this trc can be thought of as a basic building block of general wireless networks , along with the relay channel @xcite , the two - way channel @xcite , etc .",
    "recently , there have been a great deal of interest in the capacity of wireless networks .",
    "inspired by network coding @xcite , trc has been studied in the context of network coding for wireless networks due to its simple structure .",
    "however , the capacity region of the general trc is still unknown .    in @xcite , several classical relaying strategies for the one - way relay channel @xcite , such as amplify - and - forward ( af ) , decode - and - forward ( df ) , and compress - and - forward ( cf ) ,",
    "were extended and applied to the trc .",
    "af relaying is a very simple and practical strategy , but due to the noise amplification , it can not be optimal in throughput at low signal to noise ratios ( snrs ) .",
    "df relaying requires the relay to decode all the source messages and , thus , does not suffer from the noise amplification .",
    "in @xcite , it was shown that the achievable rate region of df relaying can be improved by applying network coding to the decoded messages at the relay .",
    "this scheme is sometimes optimal in its throughput @xcite , but it is generally subject to the _ multiplexing loss _ @xcite .    in general , in relay networks",
    ", the relay nodes need not reconstruct all the messages , but only need to pass sufficient information to the destination nodes to do so .",
    "cf or partial df relaying strategies for the trc , in which the relay does not decode the source messages , were studied in @xcite .",
    "it was shown that these strategies achieve the information theoretic cut - set bound @xcite within a constant number of bits when applied to the gaussian trc . in @xcite , structured schemes that use lattice codes were proposed for the gaussian trc , and it was shown that these schemes can achieve the cut - set bound within @xmath0 bit .    in this paper , we focus on the gaussian trc with full - duplex nodes and no direct communication link between the source nodes .",
    "such a gaussian trc is shown in fig . [",
    "fig : trc_gau ] ( b ) , and it is essentially the same as those considered in @xcite-@xcite . for the uplink ,",
    "i.e. , the channel from the source nodes to the relay , we propose a scheme based on nested lattice codes @xcite formed from a lattice chain .",
    "this scheme is borrowed from the work on the relay networks with interference in @xcite . by using nested lattice codes for the uplink",
    ", we can exploit the structural gain of _ computation coding _",
    "@xcite , which corresponds to a kind of combined channel and network coding . for the downlink , i.e.",
    ", the channel from the relay to the destination nodes , we see the channel as a bc with receiver side information @xcite , since the receiver nodes know their own transmitted messages . in such a channel , the capacity region can be achieved by the random binning of messages @xcite . in our strategy , a structural binning of messages , rather than the random one , is naturally introduced by the lattice codes used in the uplink .",
    "thus , at each destination node , together with the side information on its own message , this binning can be exploited for decoding .",
    "in fact , as stated above , our work is not the first to apply lattice codes to the gaussian trc .",
    "however , we assume more a general trc model compared to the other works . in @xcite",
    ", it was assumed that the channel is symmetric , i.e. , all source and relay nodes have the same transmit powers and noise variances . in @xcite , a lattice scheme for the asymmetric gaussian trc",
    "was proposed .",
    "however , the scheme requires the existence of a certain class of lattices to achieve a @xmath0 bit gap to the cut - set bound .",
    "this paper extends those previous works and shows that we can in fact achieve the cut - set bound within @xmath0 bit bit per dimension . for a complex - valued system ,",
    "as considered in @xcite , we have 1 bit gap per complex dimension . ] for any channel parameters , e.g. , transmit powers and noise variances . moreover , the gap vanishes as the uplink snrs increase .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec :",
    "model ] , we present the channel model and define related parameters . the cut - set bound on the capacity region is given in section [ sec : cutset ] . section [ sec : ach ] illustrates our achievable scheme and computes the achievable rate region .",

    "we consider a gaussian two - way relay channel , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : trc_gau ] ( b ) .",
    "we assume that the source and relay nodes operate in full - duplex mode and there is no direct path between the two source nodes .",
    "the variables of the channel are as follows :    * @xmath1 : message of node @xmath2 , * @xmath3^t$ ] : channel input of node @xmath2 , * @xmath4^t$ ] : channel output at the relay , * @xmath5^t$ ] : channel input of the relay , * @xmath6^t$ ] : channel output at node @xmath2 , * @xmath7 : estimated message of node @xmath2 ,    where @xmath8 , @xmath9 is the number of channel uses , and @xmath10 denotes the rate of node @xmath2 .",

    "there are power constraints @xmath21 , @xmath8 on the transmitted signals @xmath22 at the same time , the relay transmits @xmath23 to nodes 1 and 2 through the downlink channel specified by @xmath24 where @xmath25 is an i.i.d .",

    "the power constraint at the relay is given by @xmath27 since the relay has no messages of its own , @xmath23 is formed as a function of past channel outputs @xmath28 , i.e. , @xmath29 . at node @xmath30 , the message estimate @xmath31",
    "is computed from the received signal @xmath32 and its message @xmath11 .",
    "the decoding of node @xmath33 is performed similarly .",
    "now , the average probability of error is defined as @xmath34 for the aforementioned trc , we say that a rate pair @xmath35 is achievable if a sequence of encoding and decoding functions exists such that the error probability vanishes as @xmath9 tends to infinity .",
    "the capacity region of the trc is defined as the convex closure of all achievable rate pairs .",
    "by the cut - set bound @xcite , if the rate pair @xmath36 is achievable for a general trc , a joint probability distribution @xmath37 exists such that    & r_1 \\ { i(x_1;y_r , y_2|x_r , x_2 ) , i(x_1,x_r;y_2|x_2 ) } , + & r_2 \\ { i(x_2;y_r , y_1|x_r , x_1 ) , i(x_2,x_r;y_1|x_1 ) } .",
    "[ eq : cutset ]    in particular , for the gaussian trc , we can use the fact that there is no direct path between nodes 1 and 2 , i.e. , @xmath38 , and that @xmath39 .",

    "it can be easily seen that , for the gaussian trc with transmit power constraints , all terms under the minimizations in ( [ eq : cutsetsimp ] ) are maximized by the product distribution @xmath41 , where @xmath42 , @xmath43 , and @xmath44 are gaussian probability density functions with zero means and variances @xmath45 , @xmath46 , and @xmath47 , respectively .",
