    "pectin consists primarily of linear chains of partly methyl esterified @xmath0-d - galacturonic acid , interrupted and bent in places by rhamnose units .",
    "depending upon the degree of esterification of the carboxyl group of galacturonic acid with methanol , pectin can be categorized into two types .",
    "the species of pectin with degrees of methylation ( molar ratio of methanol to galacturonic acid ) higher than 50% is called high methoxyl pectin , while pectin samples with degrees of methylation less than 50% are called low methoxyl pectin .",
    "the gelation of low methoxyl ( lm ) pectin depends upon the ph of the system and the presence of ca@xmath1 or other multivalent ions . at low ph and in the absence of ca@xmath1 ions , lm pectin can form gels _ via _ non - ionic associations based on hydrophobic interactions and the formation of hydrogen bonds @xcite . in the presence of divalent cations like ca@xmath1 , pectin gels can form _ via _ ca@xmath1 ion bridges between two carboxyl groups of two different chains .",
    "this mechanism is popularly known as egg - box mechanism and was first observed in ca@xmath1 induced alginate biopolymer gels @xcite .",
    "recently , small - angle x - ray scattering ( saxs ) , dynamic light scattering ( dls ) and diffusive wave spectroscopy ( dws ) were employed to report that rod - like junctions , both single ion junctions and those comprising of multi - unit egg - box structures , form in ca@xmath1 induced biopolymer gels @xcite .",
    "time resolved light scattering measurements were employed to show that these hierarchical crosslinking structures result in two relaxation modes in light scattering measurements , associated with discontinuous rearrangement events that restructure the gel network under mechanical stress @xcite .",
    "the kinetics of formation and aging of alginate gels with controlled permeation of cacl@xmath2 was studied by a photon correlation imaging technique @xcite .",
    "this work reported a non - diffusive behaviour of the gelling front and demonstrated that the aging behaviour of these gels is strongly reminiscent of colloidal gels . + pectins are major components of the primary plant cell wall , where they sometimes comprise 30 - 35% of the cell wall dry weight @xcite .",
    "ca@xmath1 ions in the plant cell wall form pectin gel structures _ via _ ionic crosslinking .",
    "ca@xmath1 , which plays a crucial role in determining the structural rigidity of the cell wall , is a crucial regulator of growth and development in plants @xcite .",
    "low concentrations of ca@xmath1 result in cell walls that are more flexible and therfore easily ruptured , while high concentrations of ca@xmath1 increase the rigidity the wall , while making it less plastic @xcite . to understand cell wall behavior ,",

    "etc_. the effects of these parameters on the gelation process of pectin solutions have been studied by rheological methods @xcite , dls @xcite , nuclear magnetic resonance ( nmr ) @xcite and circular dichroism @xcite .",
    "conductometric and potentiometric studies show that decreasing the degree of methylation of pectin molecules and the ionic strength of the solution can increase the affinity of pectin molecules towards ca@xmath1 ions .",
    "this results in a decrease in the amount of calcium chloride required to obtain a sol - gel transition @xcite .",

    "the relaxation timescales of the samples , which are extracted from the decays of the autocorrelation functions obtained from the samples before gelation , are compared with their bulk viscosities .",
    "next , the effects of applied stresses on pectin gels of various strengths are studied and the critical stresses required to break the gel networks are estimated using rheological measurements .",
    "the dependence of the critical stress on the pectin gel strength is investigated systematically by changing the cacl@xmath2 concentration .",

    "analysis of our experimental data shows a strong power - law dependence of the elasticity of individual pectin flocs on the added salt concentration .",

    "the yield strains , @xmath71 , extracted from the peak positions of the plots of @xmath26 , are also observed to decrease with the added cacl@xmath2 concentration @xmath73 .",
    "this data is plotted in the inset of fig .",
    "7(a ) . + the simultaneous lowering of @xmath68 and @xmath83 for highly elastic pectin gels gives important information about the nature of the links that form between the pectin flocs .",
    "to explain the simultaneous power - law decrease of the limit of linearity and the power - law increase of the linear elastic modulus @xmath84 of elastic pectin gels with increasing salt concentration , a scaling approach proposed by shih _",
    "et al . _ for fractal colloidal gels in the strong link regime @xcite",
    "is followed here .",
    "it must be noted here that fractal concepts have previously been employed to analyse rheological data for biopolymer pectin gels @xcite , protein gel networks @xcite and colloidal gels @xcite . in lysozome protein gels , for example ,",
    "the inverse strain - dependence of the upper limit of the linear viscoelastic region is intepreted to arise from the strong link behaviour of protein gels @xcite . in all these previous studies ,",
    "gelation was induced by changing the volume fractions of the gel - forming macromolecules . in this work , in contrast",
    ", gelation is triggered not by an increase in the volume fraction of pectin , but by an increased availability of ca@xmath1 ions which enhances the formation of crosslinking bridges between pectin chains .",
    "it is observed in fig .",
    "3 that the mean relaxation time @xmath38 increases with increase in cacl@xmath2 concentration .",
    "this arises due to an increase in floc sizes before gelation .",
    "the increase in floc sizes with increasing salt concentration is verified from cryo - sem images ( fig .",
    "4 ) . for a reaction - limited fractal structure ,",
    "simulation studies show that the radius of a cluster or floc , @xmath85 , increases with cluster mass s according to a power law @xcite .",
    "as the number of pectin chains increases inside a floc due to the increased formation of ion - induced crosslinks , it is reasonable to assume that the cluster mass s increases with salt concentration @xmath73 .",
    "the floc size @xmath85 can therefore be expected to show the following power - law relation with cacl@xmath2 concentration @xmath86 where @xmath73 is the concentration of cacl@xmath2 and m is a power law exponent .",
    "as floc sizes grow due to an increase in cacl@xmath2 concentration , the flocs start to behave like weak springs @xcite , with the links within a floc becoming weaker due to a growth in floc sizes .",
    "for the pectin gels studied here , the links between the flocs ( inter - floc links ) can be characterized by higher elastic constants compared to the links within the individual flocs ( intra - floc links ) . in this regime ,",
    "when the applied stress is above a critical value , the links within the individual flocs can be assumed to break more easily than those between flocs .",
    "this is called ` strong - link ' regime @xcite . in this regime ,",
    "the macroscopic elastic constant @xmath70 and the limit of linearity @xmath72 depend on the individual floc elasticity @xmath87 and floc size @xmath85 according to following relations @xcite @xmath88 and @xmath89 the relevant calculation is shown in ` analysis and calculations ' section of supporting information . from fig .",
    "8 , it is observed that @xmath74 and @xmath82 .",
    "these power law relations are used along with eqns . 6 and 7 to conclude that the individual floc elasticity @xmath87 also follows a power law with cacl@xmath2 concentration :    @xmath90 here , @xmath91 .",
    "increase in the individual floc elasticity @xmath87 with @xmath73 is clearly due to an increase in cross - linking density within a floc . as @xmath92 and @xmath93 , eqns .",
    "6 and 7 can be written as @xmath94 and @xmath95 . from the experimental data of fig . 8 for 2.5",
    "g / l pectin solutions with added salt , @xmath96 = 1.78 and @xmath97 = 2.90 , which implies @xmath98 = 0.56 and @xmath99 = 2.34 .",
    "this indicates that in a probable scenario wherein both @xmath85 and @xmath87 exhibit power - law variations with cacl@xmath2 concentration , @xmath100 and @xmath101 for ca@xmath1 induced 2.5 g / l pectin .",
    "the floc size @xmath85 is therefore weakly dependent on @xmath73 .",
    "the individual floc elasticity @xmath87 , in contrast , shows a much stronger dependence on @xmath73 .",
    "these results are in agreement with the cryo - sem images of 4(c ) and 4(d ) , where the individual floc sizes do not appear to change significantly with @xmath73 when @xmath102 , while the density of crosslinks shows a prominent increase .",
    "a stronger dependence of the elastic modulus on individual floc elasticity , rather than the floc size , was also observed in the reaction limited aggregation regime of globular protein gels @xcite .",
    "+ finally , all the experiments reported earlier are repeated for aqueous pectin solutions of a higher concentration ( 5",
    "g / l ) to investigate the dependence of the power law exponents upon pectin concentration . from amplitude sweep experiments for different cacl@xmath2 concentrations @xmath73 , performed for a higher pectin concentration of 5 g",
    "/ l , power - law behaviours of both the macroscopic elastic constant @xmath70 and the limit of linearity @xmath72 are observed with increasing salt concentration .",
    "this data is shown in supporting information in figs . s5 and s6 . for 5 g / l pectin gels , @xmath85 and @xmath87",
    "are described by the following relations : @xmath103 and @xmath104 .",
    "interestingly , even for the higher pectin concentration , it is observed that while @xmath85 is only weakly dependent on @xmath73 , @xmath87 shows a much stronger dependence on salt concentration .",
    "for the 2.5 g / l pectin sample with 5 mm salt ( squares in fig .",
    "7(b ) ) , @xmath105 7 pa .",
    "increasing both pectin and salt concentration by a factor of 2 ( data for the 5 g / l pectin sample containing 10 mm salt , plotted in fig .",
    "s5 , is denoted by triangles ) increases the value of @xmath106 is approximately 60 pa . as the dependences of @xmath85 and @xmath87 on @xmath73 do not change considerably with pectin concentration , the large increase in @xmath106 can be explained by considering a simultaneous increase in the number of pectin flocs and the density of inter - floc links when the pectin concentration is increased .",
    "pectin is an important ingredient of plant cell walls , where ion - mediated pectin gels are known to contribute to the cell wall rigidity .",
    "pectin is also often used in gel form in the areas of food science and pharmaceuticals .",
    "these factors make a study of the mechanical properties of pectin gels extremely important .",
    "+ in this work , the gelation of pectin with increasing cacl@xmath2 concentrations and the rupture of gel networks due to the imposition of shear stresses have been studied systematically .",
    "dynamic light scattering experiments are performed to study the formation of ion - induced pectin gel networks at different cacl@xmath2 concentrations .",
    "it is seen that the relaxation dynamics of the system shows a gradual slowdown with increase in cacl@xmath2 concentration due to the formation of larger pectin flocs .",
    "this increase is accompanied by the increase in complex viscosity , with the samples eventually entering a non - ergodic state , characterized by incomplete decays of the measured autocorrelation functions .",
    "the polydispersity of the flocs and the system inhomogeneity are seen to increase with cacl@xmath2 concentration before the onset of gelation .",
    "cryo - sem images are used to verify these results on gel formation qualitatively , while sls studies confirm that the formation of pectin gels is governed by a 3-d reaction - limited aggregation process .",
    "next , systematic rheological studies are performed to understand the rupture of pectin gels .",
    "it is seen that when a constant stress is applied to pectin gels , the gel structures weaken due to the development of permanent strains and eventually break when the applied stress is above a critical value that decreases with salt ( cacl@xmath2 ) concentration .",
    "furthermore , the rheological studies reveal that increasing cacl@xmath2 concentration increases the elasticity of the gel , but decreases the limit of linearity of the strain response of the samples .",
    "this feature , together with the observation that the elastic moduli of the gels show a power - law dependence on salt concentration , demonstrates that pectin gels can be categorized to lie in a`strong link ' regime in which inter - floc links are much stronger than intra - floc links .",
    "the existence of the strong link regime in pectin gels supports our observation that smaller critical stresses are required to break gel networks formed with larger cacl@xmath2 concentrations .",
    "in contrast to earlier reports where gelation was induced by increasing the volume fraction of the gel - forming molecule , our work investigates the process of ion - mediated gelation keeping the pectin concentration fixed .",
    "the following figures and calculations are supplied in a supporting information file . in part",
    "a , the calculations of the scaling analyses of @xmath70 and @xmath72 are described .",
    "figure s1 shows the plots of the normalized autocorrelation functions @xmath15 _ vs. _ delay time @xmath7 for 2.5 g / l pectin solutions at different scattering angles .",
