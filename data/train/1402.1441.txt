    "several proofs of the freidlin - grtner formula have been given , besides that of  @xcite .",

    "see also @xcite for equivalent formulae and estimates of the spreading speed in periodic media , as well as @xcite for one - dimensional general media .",
    "many of these results are explained , and developped , in @xcite .",
    "let us now discuss the shape of the set @xmath122 in theorem [ thm : main ] , and how it compares to  @xmath66 .",
    "the latter has a very natural interpretation as the reachable set from the origin in time  @xmath31 by moving with speed @xmath29 on the road and @xmath21 in the field .",
    "indeed , considering trajectories obtained by moving on the road until time @xmath123 $ ] and then on a straight line in the field for the remaining time @xmath124 , one finds that the reachable set is the convex hull of the union of the segment @xmath125\\times\\{0\\}$ ] and the half - disc @xmath126 , that is , @xmath66 .",
    "another way to obtain the set @xmath66 is the following : consider a set - valued map @xmath127 and impose that the trace of @xmath128 expands at speed @xmath29 on the @xmath1-axis , and that the rest evolves by asking that the normal velocity of its boundary equals @xmath21 . in pde terms ,",

    "@xmath134 and it evolves with normal velocity @xmath21 .",
    "notice that imposing that a family of sets @xmath135 evolves with normal velocity @xmath21 forces the curvature of @xmath136 to be either @xmath137 or @xmath138 , i.e. ,  @xmath136 is locally either a disc of radius @xmath21 or a half - plane .",
    "it would have been tempting to think that @xmath122 coincides with @xmath66 , just as in the singular perturbation approach to front propagation in parabolic equations or systems - see evans - souganidis @xcite , @xcite .",
    "the fact that the asymptotic expansion shape is actually larger than this set is remarkable . and ,",
    "as a matter of fact , we estimate in proposition [ pro : normalspeed ] below the difference between @xmath122 and @xmath66 in terms of the normal velocities of their boundaries when magnified by @xmath49 .",
    "namely , we discover that the normal speed of @xmath139 at a boundary point @xmath140 , @xmath62 , coincides with the normal speed of the level lines of the planar wave for the linearised system which defines @xmath61 - see the next section .",
    "this speed is larger than @xmath21 because the exponential decay rate of @xmath106 in the direction orthogonal to its level lines is less than the critical one : @xmath141 .",
    "we expect this decay to be approximatively satisfied for large time by the solution of emerging from a compactly supported initial datum .",
    "thus , heuristically , the presence of the road would result in an `` unnatural '' decay for solutions of the kpp equation with compactly supported initial data , which , in turns , would be the reason why @xmath47 does not coincide with the set @xmath142 following from huygens principle .",
