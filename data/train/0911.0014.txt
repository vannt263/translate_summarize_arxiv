    "the most successful current models of galaxy formation invoke large - scale energetic outflows to explain many of the properties of local massive galaxies and the intragalactic medium ( igm ; i.e. ,  red optical colours of massive galaxies , steep optical galaxy luminosity function , the black - hole ",

    "a key attribute of these simulated outflows is the injection of significant amounts of kinetic energy into the interstellar medium ( ism ) , which can inhibit and terminate star formation by either heating the ism or ejecting the gas out of the gravitational potential of the host galaxy .",
    "large - scale outflows can be powered by star formation and/or active galactic nuclei ( agn ) activity ( e.g. ,  heckman et  al .",
    "1990 ; crenshaw et  al . 2003",
    "; veilleux et  al . 2005 ) , although most galaxy formation models predict that only agn - driven outflows will be sufficiently energetic to have significant impact on the formation and evolution of massive galaxies .",
    "these large - scale outflows are expected to be particularly effective at @xmath2  2 , when star formation in the most massive galaxies was in significant decline ( e.g. ,  juneau et  al . 2005 ; panter et  al . 2007",
    "; prez - gonzlez et  al . 2008 ; damen et  al .",
    ".    broadly speaking , agn - driven outflows are kinematically energetic `` winds '' or `` jets '' that are initially launched close to the central black hole .",
    "the two main catalysts that have been proposed to power an agn - driven outflow are ( 1 ) a radio jet or lobe , and ( 2 ) a radiatively driven wind",
    ". a radio - jet / lobe driven outflow will be most prevalent in radio - loud agn but might only occur in a minority of the agn population./@xmath7  10 ( e.g.,kellerman et al . 1989 ) .",
    "] for example , @xmath5  424% of the optically bright ( radiatively strong ) agn population are radio loud , which appears to be a function of both redshift and agn luminosity ( e.g. ,  hooper et  al .",
    "1995 ; jiang et  al .",
    "2007 ) , although this may indicate the `` duty cycle '' of radio agn activity .",
    "the fraction of optically faint ( radiatively weak ) radio - loud agn fraction is a strong function of stellar mass ( e.g. ,  best et  al .",
    "2005 ; smoli et  al .",
    "2009 ) . by comparison , a radiatively driven wind would be most effective in luminous agns with high mass - accretion rates , since the wind is directly driven by radiation pressure from the accretion disk .",
    "high signal - to - noise ratio x - ray and ultra - violet absorption - line spectroscopy have shown that high - velocity outflows are present in many agns , and may be a ubiqitious property of the agn population at both low and high redshift ( e.g. ,  crenshaw et  al .",

    "for example , at least @xmath5  60% of unobscured agns show evidence for high - velocity outflows , and the maximum measured outflow velocity is a strong function of the agn luminosity ( e.g.,crenshaw et  al . 1999 ; ganguly & brotherton 2008 ) .",
    "the estimated energy injection required to produce the x - ray absorption features ( which sometimes suggest outflow velocities exceeding @xmath8  0.1@xmath9 ) is typically @xmath5  0.11 of the agn bolometric luminosity ( e.g. ,  pounds et  al . 2003 ; reeves et  al .",
    "2003 ; chartas et  al . 2007a ; pounds & reeves 2009 ) .",
    "however , x - ray variability studies and consideration of the required energy input to produce the high - velocity features , indicate that these outflow signatures must be produced in the vicinity of the accretion disc on @xmath10  1  pc scales ( e.g. ,  crenshaw et  al .",
    "2003 ; king & pounds 2003 ) .",
    "therefore , while it is clear that energetic outflows are present close to the accreting black hole of agns , it is far from clear what impact these outflows will have on the gas and star formation in the host galaxy on @xmath5  110  kpc scales . to directly test the impact that outflows have on the formation and evolution of galaxies , it is necessary to identify large - scale energetic outflows , particularly in high - redshift ( @xmath11 ) massive galaxies where they are predicted to have been most prevalent .",

    "the key diagnostic that revealed an agn - driven outflow in these systems was the presence of kinematically complex and extended [ o  iii]@xmath15007 emission ; can be produced by a number of processes , including photo - ionisation and shocks ( osterbrock 1989 ) but it can not be produced in dense environments , such as the broad - line region of agn , without being collisionally de - excited ( e.g. ,  osterbrock 1989 ; robson 1996 ) .",

    "the estimated kinetic energy required to drive the outflows in these hzrgs is @xmath5  140% of that potentially provided by the radio jet , indicating that they could be powered by mechanical energy from the radio jet .",

    "however , could the high - velocity , broad , large - scale [ o  iii ] emission from smm  j1237 + 6203 be powered by an outflow from a radiatively driven agn wind or , given the indirect evidence for star - formation activity ( see  2.1 ) , supernova winds associated with an intense starburst ?    estimating the potential impact of an radiatively driven agn wind on the ism is difficult due to the huge difference in size scale between the likely @xmath98  pc ejection radius of the wind and the large - scale ( @xmath99  kpc ) galactic enviroment",
    ". however , given the constraints from high signal - to - noise ratio x - ray spectroscopy for a number of agns to date ( see  1 ) , it seems likely that a significant fraction of the bolometric luminosity from the agn will drive an outflow close to the accretion disk , which at least provides a first - order constraint on the _ initial _ energy injection .",

    "; see also chartas et  al .",
    "2007b for similar x - ray spectral constraints on another distant ultraluminous infrared quasar ) ; this energy injection fraction is also similar to that typically assumed in theoretical simulations ( e.g.,wyithe & loeb 2003 ; di matteo et  al .",
    "the total bolometric luminosity of smm  j1237 + 6203 is @xmath100  erg  s@xmath13 , although a significant fraction of this emission may be due to star - formation activity ; see  2.1 . a more conservative constraint on the agn bolometric luminosity is @xmath101  erg  s@xmath13 , based on the rest - frame 210  kev luminosity and the average spectral energy distribution for quasars from elvis et  al . ( 1994 ) .",
    "the _ initial _ energy input into the accretion - disk wind is therefore likely to be @xmath5  ( 0.33 )  @xmath102  erg  s@xmath13 , which would correspond to a total energy injection over a 30  myr quasar lifetime of @xmath5  ( 0.33 )  @xmath103  ergs .",
    "therefore , so long as @xmath5  10100% of the energy from the wind can couple to the large - scale ism gas , then the quasar can drive the outflow to @xmath5  8  kpc ( the maximum extent ; see fig .",
    "2 ) ; the wind  ism gas coupling efficiency drops to @xmath5  220% to drive the outflow to @xmath5  4  kpc ( the minimum extent ; see fig .  2 ) .",
    "these wind  gas coupling efficiencies are plausible given the likely large solid angle of radiatively driven agn winds ( e.g. ,  proga et  al .",
    "2000 ; king & pounds 2003 ; ohsuga et  al . 2009 ) .",
    "the dominant source of energy injection from intense star - formation activity is supernovae winds .",
    "dalla vecchia & schaye ( 2008 ) estimate the energy input from supernovae to be @xmath5  @xmath104  erg  @xmath105 , under the assumption of a salpeter initial mass function . assuming a constant star - formation rate of @xmath5  1000  @xmath41  yr@xmath13 ( see  2.1 ) , the energy injection into the host galaxy from supernovae winds would be @xmath106  erg  s@xmath13 .",
    "this suggests that the large - scale energetic outflow observed in smm  j1237 + 6203 could be powered by intense star - formation activity so long as @xmath5  20100% of the injected supernovae energy can be coupled to the ism ( the range in wind - gas coupling fractions correspond to the range in [ o  iii ] extent of 48  kpc ; see fig .  2 ) .",
    "given that the _ energy injection _ from supernovae will be more widespread than that from the agn ( i.e. ,  potentially over kpc scales rather than pc scales ) , such a large coupling fraction may not be unreasonable ( e.g. ,  weaver et  al . 1977 ) .",
    "furthermore , our calculation of the required energy to produce the broad [ o  iii ] features was based on the assumption that the outflow needed to be driven over @xmath5  48  kpc scales , when the distance could be substantially lower if the star - formation activity is widespread . for example , the energy injection required to produce the broad [ o  iii ] features over @xmath5  12  kpc scales is about an order of magnitude lower than that required to produce the broad [ o  iii ] features over @xmath5  48  kpc scales , which would give similar coupling fractions as those found in nearby starburst - dominated ulirgs ( e.g. ,  martin 2006 ) .",
    "this suggests that even if the star formation in smm  j1237 + 6203 is lower than that assumed here then it is still possible to produce the broad [ o  iii ] features so long as the supernova winds can efficiently couple to the ism .",
    "both an agn - powered and star - formation - powered wind are plausible candidates for driving the large - scale outflow in smm  j1237 + 6203 , and on the basis of our current constraints we can not directly tell which process dominates . as mentioned above , broad [ o  iii ] components with fwhm  @xmath80  800  km  s@xmath13 are detected in @xmath5  50% of nearby ulirgs hosting optical agn activity ( e.g. ,  veilleux et  al .",
    "1999 ; zheng et  al . 2002 ) while , by comparison , no nearby ulirgs optically classified as hii galaxies or liners are found to host broad [ o  iii ] emission .",
    "this would seem to suggest that the production of broad [ o  iii ] is related to agn activity .",
    "however , since [ o  iii ] emission is easily photoionised by agn activity , the detection of broad [ o  iii ] components in optically identified agns could be a sensitivity / selection effect ( i.e. ,  the agn may just be more effective at illuminating the outflowing gas that is potentially present in all ulirgs ) .",
    "indeed , optical spectroscopy of the na  i d absorption line has shown that @xmath12  50% of ulirgs host outflowing neutral gas , irregardless of the optical spectral type ( i.e. ,  hii , liner , seyfert classification ) , indicating that star - formation activity may often be responsible for gaseous outflows in ulirgs ( e.g. ,  martin 2005 ; rupke et  al .",
    "2005a , b ) .",
    "it is therefore also interesting that typical quasars ( i.e. ,  those that are not infrared bright ) rarely show such broad [ o  iii ] features ( e.g. ,  boroson et  al .",
    "2005 ; komossa et  al . 2008 ; see fig .  5 ) , which may reflect either an absence of intense star - formation activity or different evolutionary stages ( i.e. ,  an ultraluminous infrared quasar may be an earlier phase associated with energetic outflows ; see  1 ) .",
    "however , all of the evidence presented here is indirect and sensitive ifu observations of larger samples of distant ulirgs , agns , and star - forming galaxies are required to provide more direct constraints .",
    "a crucial feature of large - scale energetic outflows in galaxy formation models is the potential to eject gas from the host galaxy .",
    "although we have shown that the energy input from both agn and star - formation activity is potentially large enough to drive the large - scale outflow and unbind the ism , we have not investigated whether the gas can be ejected from the host galaxy .",
    "murray et  al .",
    "( 2005 ) show that a significant fraction of the ism can only be expelled from the host galaxy if the energy injection exceeds a limiting luminosity , which is a function of the gas - mass fraction and the galaxy gravitational potential ( this limiting luminosity is analogous to the eddington limit for the galaxy ; see eqn . 18 in murray et  al .",
    "we do not have an accurate constraint on the mass of the cold - molecular ism gas in smm  j1237 + 6203 ; however , if smm  j1237 + 6203 is similar to typical submillimetre - emitting galaxies then the moleculear gas mass would be of order @xmath71@xmath107  @xmath41 ( e.g. ,  greve et  al .",
    "2005 ) , which gives a gas - mass fraction @xmath5  0.11.0 .",

    "therefore , on the basis of this analysis , it seems unlikely that the majority of the ism in smm  j1237 + 6203 will be expelled from the host galaxy .",
    "the velocities of the broad [ o  iii ] emission are also in broad agreement with this analysis , showing that while @xmath89@xmath80@xmath109 in some of the regions , the typical velocities of the gas are more modest ( @xmath110 ) ; see fig .",
    "5 . in this respect ,",
    "smm  j1237 + 6203 is similar to nearby starburst galaxies , which have maximum outflowing gas velocities within a tight range between the circular velocity and escape velocity of the host galaxy ( e.g.,martin 2005 ) .",
    "we therefore find that smm  j1237 + 6203 is driving a large - scale energetic outflow that is disrupting the ism and could potentially shut down star formation in the host galaxy , in qualitative agreement with predictions from models of the rapid growth phase of galaxies and their central black holes ( e.g. ,  granato et  al .",
