    "the schrdinger - newton ( sn ) system of equations has been studied in various contexts since its introduction in  @xcite as a model for self - gravitating ( quantum ) particles .",
    "the single - particle formulation of the problem treats the central body s quantum mechanical distribution as a mass density sourcing the gravitational field ( whose influence affects the central body ) : @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the wave function associated with the particle of mass @xmath2 moving under the influence of the potential energy @xmath3 .",
    "regardless of its motivation ( and there are a variety of motivations for studying this set  some of these are described in  @xcite and references therein  we side - step that discussion in the current work , focusing instead on a comparative study of the solutions to  ( [ nset ] ) and our proposed modification ) , much is known about the solutions in both the time - independent  @xcite and time - dependent form  @xcite ( see also the dissertations  @xcite for additional background and review ) .",
    "we propose to augment the gravitational sourcing in  ( [ nset ] ) to include the energy density present in the gravitational field itself .",
    "the motivation for doing this comes originally from special relativity and the universal coupling of gravity  if mass density acts as a source , then so can energy density , and the energy density of the gravitational field is available as a source prior to any additional external sources ( like the energy density associated with electromagnetic fields , for example ) .",
    "the governing equation for @xmath4 , the gravitational potential energy , is then  @xcite : @xmath5 this is the field equation for a scalar @xmath6 that is sourced by a distribution of mass given by the mass density @xmath7 and its own energy density ( represented by the second term ) .",
    "this field equation was developed originally by einstein  @xcite , and a ( special ) relativistic version appeared in  @xcite  more recently , the self - coupled case was re - derived in  @xcite .",
    "if one were to similarly couple a second - rank field theory to itself by making the field s stress tensor a source  motivated by the universal nature of gravity  one ends up with general relativity ( gr )  @xcite ( and for a review of that process  @xcite ) together with its geometric interpretation .",
    "the sourcing in  ( [ eg ] ) is a scalar version of that self - coupling ( and was worked out in that context in  @xcite )",
    ". our fundamental question will be how this relatively simple nonlinearity , showing up in the gravitational field equation changes the spectrum of the resulting schrdinger - coupled system .",
    "we ll start with a review of the self - coupling that leads to the ( static ) field theory  ( [ eg ] ) , then develop the spherically symmetric vacuum solution of  ( [ eg ] ) , and use that to estimate the ground state energy as a function of particle mass .",
    "then we will introduce a numerical method to calculate the ground state energy of both sn ( to test correct numerical behavior ) and the new self - coupled gravitational field , and compare the ground state energy to the predicted form .",
    "for both the ground state and the first excited state , the bohr model estimates provide qualitatively correct predictions . by calculating the energy difference between the first excited state and ground state of the self - coupled gravity",
    ", we can compare the transition energy emission of this theory with the one predicted by sn .",
    "finally , we calculate the total energy of @xmath8 self - gravitating bosons using the self - coupled form , and compare that with the total energy as calculated using sn in  @xcite .",
    "the static gravitational field theory given by  ( [ eg ] ) was first proposed by einstein _ en route _ to general relativity .",
    "we will generate the field equation here ( a recent discussion of this derivation is in  @xcite )  the issue that motivates its development is the lack of self - coupling of the original field equation of newtonian gravity : @xmath9 describes a field @xmath4 sourced by a mass density @xmath10 , but this poisson form lacks the energy density source that comes from @xmath4 itself .",
    "let s start by calculating the energy density associated with a field @xmath4 that comes from newtonian gravity ( so that it satisfies the poisson equation : @xmath9 ) .",
    "proceeding as usual , the work done in building a distribution of mass , @xmath10 , is given by : @xmath11 then using the poisson equation to eliminate @xmath10 and integrating by parts gives @xmath12 and we would call the integrand the energy density of the field : @xmath13 according to special relativity , we should use an associated effective mass density @xmath14 as a source in the field equation for @xmath4 .",
    "that is the nonlinearity promised by a theory of gravity  the field s self - energy must act as a source .",
    "so we are tempted to start with : @xmath15 and this form was considered in  @xcite .",
    "the problem is that the new field equation  ( [ petersp ] ) leads to an energy density ( obtained as above , but with the new field equation instead of the poisson equation ) that is _ not _",
    "( [ ufirstpass ] ) , and so the self - coupling is not consistent .",
    "we ll now generate the correct self - coupled theory using the machinery of field theory , where the hamiltonian density is the energy density ( for a static , free field ) .",
    "suppose we start with a free field theory that has hamiltonian @xmath16 , i.e.  we augment the usual scalar hamiltonian with a function of @xmath4 , @xmath17 , that we will fix by demanding that it lead to a source term that looks like @xmath18 .",
    "the field equation for this @xmath19 is @xmath20 or @xmath21 it is the right - hand side of this equation that we would like to set equal to @xmath22 , giving us the self - consistent energy density source , and when we do that , we get an ode for @xmath17 : @xmath23    our final free hamiltonian is : @xmath24 , and this is the energy density of the field in the theory , given also in  @xcite . using this solution for @xmath17 gives the field equation : @xmath25 in vacuum , and we recover  ( [ eg ] ) when we introduce massive sources ( that would put a factor of @xmath10 on the right - hand side of  ( [ protp ] ) ) .",
    "when computing solutions to this self - consistent , self - coupled form of gravity , it is worth noting that the field equation  ( [ eg ] ) can be written linearly in @xmath26 , where it reads ( again , from  @xcite ) : @xmath27 in order to recover newtonian gravity , we must take @xmath28 , then inserting this into  ( [ einsimple ] ) ( or  ( [ eg ] ) ) and collecting in powers of @xmath29 gives back @xmath30 to zeroth order , a requirement of the weak - field limit .",
    "we ll start by looking at solutions to the field equation : @xmath31 in regions where @xmath32 ( so we are in vacuum ) and @xmath33",
    ". such a solution would be appropriate for a spherically symmetric source of mass @xmath2 localized near the origin . under our assumptions , the field equation reduces to @xmath34 with primes denoting @xmath35-derivatives .",
    "the solution to this equation comes with two integration constants , @xmath36 and @xmath37 : @xmath38.\\ ] ] if we ask that @xmath39 look like a newtonian point source ( of mass @xmath2 ) as @xmath35 approaches spatial infinity , then we can fix @xmath36 @xmath40 to recover the poisson form of newtonian gravity for @xmath4 small ( compared to @xmath41 ) , we must have @xmath42 as a boundary condition , and that sets the constant @xmath37 .",
    "our final spherically symmetric vacuum solution looks like @xmath43 the energy density of this field is , from @xmath24 , @xmath44 which is everywhere positive .",
    "we are interested in the vacuum solution because it is the one that is relevant to the bohr approach to estimating quantum mechanical energies .",
    "but it is easy to compute ( especially from  ( [ einsimple ] ) ) the solution in cases other than vacuum  for example , if we had a sphere of radius @xmath45 with constant density @xmath46 inside it , then the interior solution to  ( [ eg ] ) is just : @xmath47 where @xmath48 is a constant that we would use to match up to an exterior solution ( at @xmath49 , for example ) and we have chosen the solution that is finite at the origin .",
    "for the sn system , with constants @xmath50 , @xmath51 , and @xmath2 , there is only one way to make an energy @xmath52 so we expect , up to constants out front , that the energy spectrum of  ( [ nset ] ) scales like @xmath53 ( as indeed it does  @xcite ) .    with the introduction of @xmath29 appearing in  ( [ eg ] )",
    ", we can form the planck mass : @xmath54 , and this means that any power of @xmath2 could appear in the energy spectrum of the self - coupled system ( where we expect @xmath55 with @xmath56 , but otherwise unconstrained ) .",
    "we d like a way to estimate relevant combinations of @xmath57 and @xmath2 that might appear in our new spectrum .",
    "to that end , we will use the bohr model ( originally for hydrogen , of course , but applied in this gravitational setting ) with potential given by  ( [ ppsc ] )  the idea is that if the ground state is localized close to the origin , then far away , the potential associated with that ground state should go roughly like  ( [ ppsc ] ) , and so the spectrum of the spherically symmetric vacuum solution could provide some relevant approximate information .    to start , we ll apply the bohr method to @xmath58 , just the newtonian point particle potential ( with an offset at spatial infinity so as to match  ( [ ppsc ] ) ) . according to the rules of old quantization ( for circular orbits , updated to elliptical orbits in the wilson - sommerfeld formulation ) , we start with the total energy for a particle moving in a circle of radius @xmath35 ( so that @xmath59 ) : @xmath60 next , we assume angular momentum is quantized : @xmath61 for integer @xmath62 , giving us a value for the radius : @xmath63  then using this radius in @xmath64 we get a discrete set of energies : @xmath65 the ground state corresponds to @xmath66 : @xmath67 which is what we expect , namely a linear ( in @xmath2 ) offset ( associated with the shift at spatial infinity ) and @xmath53 scaling .",
    "performing the same procedure for the  point potential \" in  ( [ ppsc ] ) gives @xmath68 with ground state energy : @xmath69 where again , we only care about the mass scaling here  our estimate can not predict constant offsets and/or overall constants out front .",
    "we ll come back to those later on .",
    "note that the expression  ( [ bfitscsc ] ) reduces to  ( [ bfitsn ] ) in the @xmath70 limit , as it should : @xmath71 for @xmath2 small .",
    "we ll start by specializing to spherically symmetric solutions , then we ll render the equations of interest dimensionless , and put them in time - independent form to define the eigenvalue problem of interest . from there , we ll introduce the iterative finite difference approach that can be applied to either sn or self - coupled gravity to find the ground state energies .      since we are interested in the ground state energies , we will focus on spherically symmetric solutions to both sn and the modified system . for sn",
    ", we have @xmath72 and we can simplify further by setting @xmath73 , then the above becomes @xmath74 the wave function is normalized to @xmath75 , so that our @xmath76 has : @xmath77    the modified theory becomes , under the same assumptions and substitutions , @xmath78    we can render the equations dimensionless by introducing @xmath79 , @xmath80 for dimensionless @xmath45 and @xmath81 , and taking @xmath82 , @xmath83 , where @xmath84 is a speed@xmath85 and @xmath86 has dimension @xmath87 . finally , let @xmath88 for planck mass @xmath89 and set @xmath90 for dimensionless energy @xmath91 .",
    "then our pairs take the form of an eigenvalue problem @xmath92 and @xmath93 with @xmath94 the normalization of the wave function  ( [ normit ] ) now reads : @xmath95      the numerical method is the same in both cases  we discretize in @xmath45 by taking @xmath96 , where @xmath97 is a boundary point ( at the origin  for @xmath98 finite at the origin , we must have @xmath99 there ) , and we take @xmath100 to be a numerical approximation to infinity , where we again require @xmath99 .",
    "let @xmath101 ( and @xmath102 ) , then we can discretize schrdinger s equation using finite differences : @xmath103 + \\bar m \\ , \\bar \\phi_j \\ , \\bar p_j = \\bar e \\ , \\bar p_j\\ ] ] for @xmath104 .",
    "we can define the vector @xmath105 to have entries that are precisely the unknown @xmath106 values ( and similarly for the vector @xmath107 ) , and then  ( [ schdiff ] ) can be written as a matrix eigenvalue problem in the usual way : @xmath108 with @xmath109    as a matrix eigenvalue problem , it is relatively easy to construct @xmath110 and then find the eigenvector associated with the smallest eigenvalue  that eigenvector is an approximation to the ground state .",
    "once we have @xmath111 in hand , we can construct the entries of @xmath107 in either the sn or augmented case using verlet .",
    "we can find the values for @xmath112 by working backwards from @xmath113 to @xmath75 using the recursion @xmath114,\\ ] ] where we take @xmath115 for @xmath113 and @xmath116  since @xmath100 , we want the potential to approximate its value out at spatial infinity , and this is the dimensionless form of @xmath117 . for the gravitational field equation in  ( [ scsciii ] ) , the analogous verlet recursion looks like @xmath118\\ ] ] with the same boundary conditions as above .",
    "so , if we had the entires of @xmath111 , we could construct the entries of @xmath107 in either case , but in order to get @xmath111 , we need @xmath107  the matrix @xmath110 in  ( [ ddef ] ) depends on the values of the potential @xmath107 .",
    "we can use an iterative approach ( similar to the one in  @xcite ) to get around the problem .",
    "let @xmath119 be the @xmath120 iteration for @xmath106 , then we can construct @xmath121 using  ( [ verlet ] ) , and update by finding the smallest eigenvalue / vector of @xmath122 , so @xmath123 from this , we can construct @xmath124 and iterate until : @xmath125 for @xmath126 , some user - specified tolerance .",
    "the ground state energies for the sn system were calculated for @xmath127 to @xmath128 in steps of @xmath129 . in  figure",
    "[ fig : snpphi ] , we show @xmath130 and @xmath131 for the masses @xmath132 ( top ) and @xmath128 ( bottom )  we chose these mass limits because at our value of @xmath133 and @xmath134 , masses less than @xmath127 begin to violate our assumption that @xmath135 , and masses larger than @xmath128 get localized to only a few grid points near the origin .",
    "we can expand the mass range by changing @xmath136 , allowing us to probe smaller masses , and by decreasing @xmath137 , allowing us to move up in mass .     and",
    "@xmath138 for @xmath127 ( top ) and @xmath128 ( bottom ) for the sn system . here , @xmath133 with @xmath139 ,",
    "and we use @xmath140 as the tolerance for the iteration ( see  ( [ stopper])).,width=384 ]    the energies themselves are shown in  figure  [ fig : snenergy ] . there , the dots are the numerically - determined values  we fit the dots to a curve of the form @xmath141 , motivated by  ( [ bfitsn ] ) , using a nonlinear levenberg - marquardt fit of the data .",
    "the curve is : @xmath142    , from  ( [ bfitsnc]).,width=384 ]    the best fit curve has two interesting features ",
    "first , it correctly identifies the linear @xmath143 offset from  ( [ bfitsn ] ) , and this provides an estimate of the error in the method  we should have a value of @xmath144 in front of the @xmath145 term in  ( [ bfitsnc ] ) , but instead we get @xmath146 , an error of @xmath147 . as for the coefficient of the @xmath148 term , it agrees well with the accepted value of @xmath149  @xcite .",
    "we use the same setup and parameters to find the ground state energies for the modified , self - sourcing gravity system . in  figure",
    "[ fig : scscpphi ] , we have the plots corresponding to  figure  [ fig : snpphi ] , showing the functions @xmath130 and @xmath138 for the smallest and largest mass values .     and @xmath138 for @xmath127 ( top ) and @xmath128 ( bottom ) for the self - coupled system .",
    "here , @xmath133 with @xmath139 , and we use @xmath140 as the tolerance for the iteration ( see  ( [ stopper])).,width=384 ]    this time , we fit to the function : @xmath150 , guided by the form of  ( [ bfitscsc ] ) , and obtain @xmath151 the numerically - determined ground state values and best fit curve are shown in  figure  [ fig : e1scsc ] .    ) , from  ( [ bfitscscc]).,width=384 ]    while the fit curve captures the basic behavior of the ground state energies in this case , it does not fit as well as in the sn case .",
    "the freedom in generating energies using @xmath57 in addition to @xmath2 allows for a more complicated spectrum ( for sn , @xmath53 is the only possibility ) , and we do not expect the simple estimate from the bohr method to work as well .",
    "still , the structure of the spectrum is described by that estimate .",
    "we have the numerical spectrum from the self - coupled case , and can compare that with the @xmath152 scaling from the sn system  that is shown in  figure  [ fig : snsce ]  for small masses , the two ground state energies agree well , but they begin to diverge near @xmath153 .",
    "note that both energies are offset by the same amount ( these are bound state energies , so we expect them to be negative , they have been shifted upwards by the constant factor @xmath143 , the value of the potential energy at infinity ) .",
    "the energies are off by around @xmath154 by @xmath128 .",
    "while the sn energies become arbitrarily negative as @xmath145 increases , the self - coupled spectrum looks like it asymptotically approaches zero ( or @xmath155 , relative to the value of the potential at spatial infinity )  indeed , this is predicted by the bohr estimate  ( [ bohrsc ] ) , where the energy scales like @xmath156 for @xmath2 large .    another way to compare the spectrum of the self - coupled case with the sn energies is to look at the energy emitted during a transition from the first excited state to the ground state . in the sn case ,",
    "the first excited state has energy  @xcite : @xmath157 , and so the difference between the first excited state and the ground state is : @xmath158 or @xmath159 in our dimensionless variables .    to compute the first excited state using our approach , we simply perform our iteration using the eigenvector associated with the second smallest eigenvalue ( a simple modification of  ( [ smalleval])) the energy , as a function of @xmath145 together with the best fit from  ( [ bfitscsc ] ) with @xmath160 ( so that the fit function is @xmath161 ) is shown in  figure  [ fig : scscfes ] .        subtracting the ground state for each mass , we get the @xmath162 to compare with the sn case  that difference is shown in  figure  [ fig : scscdelta ] , together with the @xmath163 from above .",
    "notice there that by @xmath128 , the energy difference for sn is roughly ten times that of the self - coupled case  the frequency of emission ( if radiation were emitted ) for sn at this mass value would be ten times the frequency in the self - coupled case , providing a clear signature for one over the other .",
    "if  ( [ bohrsc ] ) continues to hold qualitatively for larger @xmath62 , we see that the self - coupled case has a maximum energy of @xmath164 ( the limit as @xmath165 ) , so any transition energy is bounded in this case , while the transition energies of sn will always be of the form : @xmath166 for some constant @xmath36 .      in the original application of the sn equations , appearing in  @xcite ,",
    "the total energy of @xmath8 bosons in their ground state was calculated ",
    "the schrdinger - newton pair appears as @xmath167 where @xmath8 particles of mass @xmath2 are interacting gravitationally in the same state .",
    "this is a very different application of the sn system ( as compared with single - particle collapse ) , and yet we can use our self - consistent scalar gravity in place of the gravitational field equation here , just as for the single particle case .",
    "we ll replace the poisson equation with @xmath168 as usual .    the total energy , from the sn approach , is @xmath169 , a dimensionless energy of @xmath170  that is plotted in  figure  [ fig : bonetot ] ( the choice of @xmath2 just changes the scale in @xmath8 ,",
    "so we have left an unscaled axis there ) .",
    "there are three distinct regions in the total energy curve  in the first , where the derivative of the total energy is positive , adding particles adds energy . in the second , where the derivative is negative , but @xmath171 is still positive , adding particles decreases the total energy .",
    "finally , the total energy becomes negative when using the sn equations .",
    "self - gravitating bosons in the ground state.,width=384 ]    we can calculate the corresponding total energy using the self - consistent scalar gravity in the form  ( [ ninplace ] )  taking @xmath172 and @xmath173 , we find the total energy and plot them with the sn result at those masses in  figure  [ fig : bostots ] .",
    "bosons , each with mass @xmath172 ( top plot ) or @xmath173 ( bottom plot ) .",
    "the points represent the total energy as calculated using self - consistent scalar gravity , while the solid curve is the sn prediction from  @xcite.,width=384 ]    the total energies are different between the two cases  the peak that separates the region in which the total energy grows with additional particles from the region in which the total energy decreases with additional particles has shifted ( upward in @xmath8 for the self - coupled case ) , and the self - coupled energy does not become negative .",
    "there is additional physics which must be introduced ( and is considered in detail in  @xcite ) as the regimes change , and our goal here is only to once again draw a distinction ( in principle detectable ) between using the poisson form of newtonian gravity and using the nonlinear , self - coupled scalar gravity .",
    "we have introduced an iterative numerical method to find the ground state energies for coupled quantum mechanical / gravitational problems .",
    "we tested the method with the familiar schrdinger - newton pair of equations , and found that the method worked well , agreeing with known results for that system .",
    "in addition , we used the bohr method to predict the form of the ground - state energy for sn as a function of mass .",
    "then , we used the same approach for the self - consistent , self - sourced scalar gravity from  @xcite .",
    "the spectrum has a very different mass dependence there , and this is to be expected given the additional ( and necessary , for a theory of gravity ) nonlinearity appearing in the gravitational field equation .",
    "once again , the bohr method provided a qualitatively relevant estimate for the energy dependence on mass for both the ground state and first excited state .",
    "the difference in energies provides a distinct signature for the self - coupled gravity  the transition energy from the first excited state to the ground state is much less in the self - coupled case than in sn",
    ".    it would be interesting to explore the dynamics of the new , self - coupled case , and compare with the dynamics of sn , which are known . aside from specific computational targets",
    ", we use special relativity to motivate the self - sourcing in the gravitational field equation , but we use the non - relativistic schrdinger equation to capture the quantum mechanical behavior  we could probe the high energy solutions by using the klein - gordon or dirac equations . in these cases , it would be interesting to see how the self - coupled gravitational field arises in the context of  @xcite in which the authors show that schrdinger - newton is a natural limit of fields coupled to gravity , and the poisson equation for the gravitational field appears as the first term in their expansion .",
