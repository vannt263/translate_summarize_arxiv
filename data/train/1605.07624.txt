    "the quantum mechanical duration of each splitting process , known as the formation time , exceeds the mean free time for collisions with the medium , leading to a significant reduction in the splitting rate known as the landau - pomeranchuk - migdal ( lpm ) effect @xcite .",
    "a long - standing problem in field theory has been to understand how to implement this effect in cases where the formation times of two consecutive splittings overlap .",

    "two of us @xcite subsequently developed and implemented field theory formalism needed for the more general case where @xmath3 and @xmath4 are arbitrary . however , we only computed a subset of the interference effects .",
    "most significantly , we deferred the analysis of effects that require carefully disentangling ( i ) the computation of double bremsstrahlung with overlapping formation times from ( ii ) the naive approximation of double bremsstrahlung as two , consecutive , quantum - mechanically independent single - bremsstrahlung processes . in this paper",
    ", we compute the effects that require this careful disentanglement .    in the remainder of this introduction",
    ", we will first qualitatively discuss what effect overlapping formation times have on a simplified monte carlo picture of shower development , which will help us later set up the technical details of how to approach explicit calculations .",
    "we then give a more precise description of exactly what effects we calculate in this paper versus which are further deferred to later work . with those caveats , we present interim results for the example of real , double gluon bremsstrahlung @xmath6 in the case of a thick medium .",
    "we wrap up the introduction with a very simple argument for the parametric size of the rate .    after the introduction , section [ sec : calculation ]",

    "we begin by explaining why this is the physically sensible choice for the calculation that we do .    in order to simplify calculations in this paper",
    ", we are going to assume that the medium is thick  much wider than any of the formation times for splitting .",

    "in the situation pertaining to jet energy loss in quark - gluon plasmas formed in relativistic heavy ion collisions , this could apply to an energetic particle ( not necessarily the primary energetic particle ) that showers and stops in the medium .",
    "imagine approximating the development of this shower by an idealized in - medium `` monte carlo '' : start with a calculation or model of the rate for each single splitting , assume that consecutive splittings are independent , and evolve through time , rolling dice after each small time increment to decide whether each high - energy particle splits then . even for purely in - medium development ,",

    "some ( see later discussion ) also attempt to heuristically model corrections to independent treatment of splittings @xcite .",

    "we will refer to this idealized calculation , based just on formulas for single - splitting probabilities , as the `` idealized monte carlo ( imc ) '' result .",

    "we want to compute how to account for what happens when two of the splittings are close enough that formation times overlap , such as in fig .",
    "[ fig : mc]c , in which case the idealized monte carlo assumption that the splittings are independent breaks down .",
    "let s ignore very - soft bremsstrahlung for now , since it is more - democratic splittings that naively dominate energy loss ; the ( nonetheless important ) effects of very - soft bremsstrahlung have been treated elsewhere @xcite .",
    "so imagine that in each splitting the daughters both carry a non - negligible fraction of the parent s energy .",
    ", the specific assumption here is ( parametrically ) that @xmath9 for each daughter . ] in this case , the separation between splittings is on average large compared to the formation times , provided that @xmath10 ( evaluated at the scale that characterizes high - energy splittings at scale @xmath11 .",
    "see , for example , the brief discussion in section i.e of ref .  @xcite . ] ) is small .",
    "the chances that three or more consecutive ( democratic ) splittings happen to occur with overlapping formation times is then even smaller than the chance that two consecutive splittings overlap .",

    "let s now turn to an example that is more analogous to our double bremsstrahlung problem .",
    "consider the classical analogy of a very tiny device ( `` particle '' ) that has a certain probability @xmath22 per unit time of emitting a flash of light .",
    "if we formally expand to first order in @xmath22 , then the probability of emitting exactly one flash of light in time @xmath18 is ( formally ) @xmath23 . if we formally expand to _ second _ order in @xmath22 , then the probability of emitting exactly two flashes of light here and in the rest of the argument are inessential to the point we want to make . ] in time @xmath18 is @xmath24 .",
