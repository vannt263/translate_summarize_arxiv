    "here we only assumed a realistic hierarchy of neutrino squared - mass differences in which the smallest squared - mass difference is effective in solar neutrino oscillations .",
    "in section  [ 091 ] we have illustrated the validity of the analytical approximation ( [ 068 ] ) of the flavor transition probability by comparing its value with that obtained with a numerical solution of the evolution equation in three examples of the possible mixing matrix in the simplest case of four - neutrino mixing .",
    "hence , we are confident that the expression ( [ 068 ] ) of the flavor transition probability can be used in a reliable analysis of the solar neutrino data which could provide important information on active - sterile neutrino mixing @xcite .",
