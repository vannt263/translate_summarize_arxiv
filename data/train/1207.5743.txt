    "-magnet synchronous motors ( pmsm ) are widely used in industry . in the so - called `` sensorless '' mode of operation ,",
    "the rotor position and velocity are not measured and the control law must make do with only current measurements . while sensorless control at medium to high velocities is well understood , with",
    "many reported control schemes and industrial products , sensorless control at low velocity remains a challenging task .",
    "the reason is that observability degenerates at zero velocity , causing a serious problem in the necessary rotor position estimation .",
    "a now well - established method to overcome this problem is to add some persistent excitation by injecting a high - frequency signal  @xcite and use the rotor saliency , whether geometric for interior permanent - magnet machines or induced by main flux saturation for surface permanent - magnet machines  @xcite .",
    "signal injection is moreover considered as a standard building block in hybrid control schemes for complete drives operating from zero to full speed  @xcite .    however to get a good position estimation under high - load condition it is important to take cross - saturation into account  @xcite .",
    "it is thus necessary to rely on a model of the saturated pmsm adapted to control purposes , i.e. rich enough to capture in particular cross - saturation but also simple enough to be used in real - time and to be easily identified in the field ; see @xcite for references more or less in this spirit .",
    "the contribution of this paper , which builds on the preliminary work  @xcite , is twofold : on the one hand it proposes a clear and original analysis based on second - order averaging of how to recover the position information from signal injection ; this analysis can accommodate to any form of injected signals , e.g. square signals as in  @xcite , and blends well with a general model of magnetic saturation including cross - saturation . on the other hand",
    "a simple parametric model of the saturated pmsm , well - adapted to control purposes , is introduced ; it is based on an energy function which simply encompasses saturation and cross - saturation effects .",
    "the paper runs as follows : section  [ sec : model ] presents the saturation model . in section  [ sec : pos ] position estimation by signal injection is studied thanks to second - order averaging .",
    "section  [ sec : identi ] is devoted to the estimation of the parameters entering the saturation model using once again signal injection and averaging .",
    "finally section  [ sec : experiment ] experimentally demonstrates on two kinds of motors ( with interior magnets and surface - mounted magnets ) the relevance of the approach and the necessity of considering saturation to correctly estimate the position .",
    "in the sequel we denote by @xmath0 the vector made from the real numbers @xmath1 and @xmath2 , where @xmath3 can be @xmath4 , @xmath5 or  @xmath6 .",
    "we also define the matrices @xmath7 and we have the useful relation @xmath8      the model of a two - axis pmsm expressed in the synchronous @xmath9 frame reads @xmath10 with @xmath11 flux linkage due to the current ; @xmath12 constant flux linkage due to the permanent magnet ; @xmath13 impressed voltage and @xmath14 stator current ; @xmath15 and @xmath16 rotor ( electrical ) speed and position ; @xmath17 stator resistance ; @xmath18 number of pole pairs ; @xmath19 inertia moment and @xmath20 load torque .",
    "the physically impressed voltages are @xmath21 while the physically measurable currents are  @xmath22 .",
    "the current can be expressed in function of the flux linkage thanks to a suitable energy function  @xmath23 by @xmath24 where @xmath25 denotes the partial derivative w.r.t . the @xmath26 variable  @xcite ; without loss of generality @xmath27 .",
    "such a relation between flux linkage and current naturally encompasses cross - saturation effects .    for an unsaturated pmsm",
    "this energy function reads @xmath28 where @xmath29 and @xmath30 are the motor self - inductances , and we recover the usual linear relations @xmath31    notice the expression for @xmath32 should respect the symmetry of the pmsm w.r.t the direct axis , i.e. @xmath33 which is obviously the case for  @xmath34 . indeed ",
    "is left unchanged by the transformation @xmath35      magnetic saturation can be accounted for by considering a more complicated magnetic energy function  @xmath32 , having @xmath34 for quadratic part but including also higher - order terms . from experiments",
    "saturation effects are well captured by considering only third- and fourth - order terms , hence @xmath36 this is a perturbative model where the higher - order terms appear as corrections of the dominant term  @xmath34 .",
    "the nine coefficients @xmath37 together with @xmath29 , @xmath30 are motor dependent . but implies @xmath38 , so that the energy function eventually reads @xmath39 from   and   the currents are then explicitly given by @xmath40 which are the so - called flux - current magnetization curves .    to conclude , the model of the saturated pmsm is given by   and  - , with @xmath41 as state variables .",
    "the magnetic saturation effects are represented by the five parameters @xmath42 .",
    "the model of the pmsm is usually expressed with currents as state variables .",
    "this can be achieved here by time differentiating @xmath44 , @xmath45 with @xmath46 given by  .",
    "fluxes are then expressed as @xmath47 by inverting the nonlinear relations  - ; rather than performing the exact inversion , we can take advantage of the fact the coefficients @xmath48 are experimentally small . at first order w.r.t .",
    "the  @xmath48 we have @xmath49 and @xmath50 ; plugging these expressions into  - and neglecting @xmath51 terms , we easily find @xmath52    notice the matrix @xmath53 with coefficients easily found to be @xmath54 is by construction symmetric ; indeed @xmath55 and @xmath56 . therefore the inductance matrix @xmath57 is also symmetric , though this is not always acknowledged in saturation models encountered in the literature .",
    "a general sensorless control law can be expressed as @xmath58 where the measured currents @xmath59 are used to compute @xmath60 , @xmath61 and the evolution of the internal ( vector ) variable @xmath62 of the controller ; @xmath63 and  @xmath61 are known by design",
    ".    it will be convenient to write the system equations   in the @xmath64 frame defined by @xmath65 , which gives @xmath66 where from  - currents and fluxes are related by @xmath67    to estimate the position we will superimpose on some desirable control law   a fast - varying pulsating voltage , @xmath68 where @xmath69 is a @xmath70-periodic function with zero mean and @xmath71 could like  @xmath72 depend on @xmath73 ( though it is always taken constant in the sequel ) .",
    "the constant pulsation @xmath74 is chosen `` large '' , so that @xmath75 can be seen as a `` fast '' oscillation ; typically @xmath76 in the experiments in section  [ sec : experiment ] .",
    "if we apply this modified control law to  ",
    ", then it can be shown the solution of the closed loop system is @xmath77 where @xmath78 is the primitive of @xmath69 with zero mean ( @xmath78 clearly has the same period as  @xmath69 ) ; @xmath79 is the `` slowly - varying '' component of @xmath80 , i.e. satisfies @xmath81 where @xmath82 notice this slowly - varying system is exactly the same as   acted upon by the unmodified control law  . in other words adding signal injection :    * has a very small effect of order @xmath83 on the mechanical variables @xmath84 and the controller variables @xmath85 * has a small effect of order @xmath86 on the flux  @xmath87 ; this effect will be used in the next section to extract the position information from the measured currents .",
    "the proof relies on a direct application of second - order averaging of differential equations , see  @xcite section  @xmath88 and for the slow - time dependance section  @xmath89 . indeed setting @xmath90 , @xmath91 , and @xmath92 ,  acted upon by the modified control law  and   is in the so - called standard form for averaging ( with slow - time dependance ) @xmath93 with @xmath94 @xmath95-periodic w.r.t .",
    "its third variable ( @xmath96 in our case ) and @xmath97 as a small parameter .",
    "therefore its solution can be approximated as @xmath98 where @xmath99 is the solution of @xmath100 and    rcl g_1(y , ) & : = & _ 0^tf_1(y,,s)ds = f_1(y , ) + v_1(y , , ) & : = & _ 0^(f_1(y,,s)-g_1(y,))ds + & = & f_1(y,)_0^f(s)ds + u_1(y , , ) & : = & v_1(y,,)-_0^tv_1(y,,s)ds + & = & f_1(y,)f ( ) + k_2(y , , ) & : = & _ 1f_1(y,,)u_1(y , , ) + & & -_1u_1(y,,)g_1(y , ) + & = & [ f_1,f_1](y,)f ( ) + & & + _ 1f_1(y,)f_1(y , ) + g_2(y , ) & : = & _ 0^tk_2(y,,s)ds=0 .",

    "translating back to the original variables eventually yields the desired result  .",
    "we now express the effect of signal injection on the currents : plugging   into   we have @xmath103 where we have used   and performed a first - order expansion to get @xmath104 we will see in the next section how to recover @xmath105 and @xmath106 from the measured currents  @xmath107 . therefore gives two ( redundant ) relations relating the unknown angle  @xmath108 to the known variables @xmath109 , provided the matrix @xmath110 effectively depends on its first argument  @xmath111 .",
    "this `` saliency condition '' is what is needed to ensure nonlinear observability .",
    "the explicit expression for @xmath112 is obtained thanks to  . in the case of an unsaturated magnetic circuit",
    "this matrix boils down to @xmath113 and does not depend on  @xmath107 ; notice this matrix does not depend on  @xmath111 for an unsaturated machine with no geometric saliency .",
    "notice also defines in that case two solutions on  @xmath114-\\pi,\\pi]$ ] for the angle  @xmath108 since @xmath112 is actually a function of  @xmath115 ; in the saturated case there is generically only one solution , except for some particular values of  @xmath106 .",
    "there are several ways to extract the rotor angle information from  , especially for real - time use inside a feedback law . in this paper",
    "we just want to demonstrate the validity of   and we will be content with directly solving it through a nonlinear least square problem ; in other words we estimate the rotor position as @xmath116-\\pi,\\pi]}{\\left\\lvert        \\widetilde i_{\\gamma\\delta } - { { \\mathcal s}}(\\mu,\\overline i_{\\gamma\\delta})\\frac{\\widetilde u_{\\gamma\\delta}}{\\omega}\\right\\rvert}^2.\\ ] ]      to estimate the position information using e.g.   it is necessary to extract the low- and high - frequency components @xmath106 and @xmath105 from the measured current  @xmath107 .",
    "since by   @xmath117 with @xmath106 and @xmath105 by construction nearly constant on one period of  @xmath78 , we may write @xmath118 where @xmath119 . indeed as @xmath78 is @xmath70-periodic with zero mean , @xmath120     in  - ]",
    "the seven parameters in the saturation model  - must of course be estimated .",
    "this can be done with a rather simple procedure also relying on signal injection and averaging .",
    "the rotor is locked in the position  @xmath121 , hence the model  reduces to @xmath122 and    rcl & = & u_dq - ri_dq[eq : dqlocked ] ,    with  @xmath123",
    ". moreover @xmath13 can now be physically impressed and @xmath14 physically measured .    as in section  [ sec : averaging ] , but now working directly in the @xmath9 frame , we inject a fast - varying pulsating voltage    rcl u_dq & = & u_dq+u_dqf(t)[eq : dqif ] ,    with constant @xmath124 and  @xmath125 .",
    "the solution of  - is then    rcl _ dq & = & _ dq + f(t ) + o ( )    where @xmath126 , the `` slowly - varying '' component of @xmath11 , satisfies    rcl & = & u_d - ri_d[eq : dqslow ] ,    with @xmath127 .",
    "moreover now boils down to    rcl i_dq & = & d_dq(_dq^-1(i_dq))[eq : dqest ] .",
    "since @xmath124 is constant implies @xmath128 tends to @xmath124 , hence after an initial transient @xmath129 is constant . as a consequence @xmath130 is by   also constant .",

    "<S> sensorless control of permanent - magnet synchronous motors ( pmsm ) at low velocity remains a challenging task . </S>",
    "<S> a now well - established method consists in injecting a high - frequency signal and use the rotor saliency , both geometric and magnetic - saturation induced . </S>",
    "<S> this paper proposes a clear and original analysis based on second - order averaging of how to recover the position information from signal injection ; this analysis blends well with a general model of magnetic saturation . </S>",
    "<S> it also proposes a simple parametric model of the saturated pmsm , based on an energy function which simply encompasses saturation and cross - saturation effects . </S>",
    "<S> experimental results on a surface - mounted pmsm and an interior magnet pmsm illustrate the relevance of the approach .    </S>",
