    ". actually our proof of theorem [ thm : pat ] can be modified a little bit to prove ill - posedness statements in @xmath35 for all values of @xmath36 : there exists @xmath31 whose @xmath35-norm becomes instantaneously infinite for @xmath27 .    in the work of bourgain - li @xcite ,",
    "the existence of localized initial data which escapes @xmath2 was obtained by carefully `` patching '' together an infinite sequence @xmath37 of @xmath32 data whose support becomes smaller but grows in @xmath2 with a larger rate in a shorter period of time as @xmath38 .",
    "it is possible that the @xmath32 solutions that we construct in theorem [ thm : growth ] can be patched together to obtain the desired statement as well .",
    "however , this seems to require a rather involved analysis , and we have chosen to establish theorem [ thm : pat ] via exhibiting a simple explicit initial data in @xmath1 , see .",
    "the problem of well - posedness will not be an issue in the above statements as there is a unique , global - in - time solution of the extended system  in @xmath39 ( so - called yudovich solutions ) for @xmath40 just in @xmath41 , even though in this case , @xmath15 is only log - lipschitz in general . a simple proof of this fact may be found in @xcite , for instance .",
    "the space @xmath2 is called _ critical _ since we barely can not close the standard energy estimate @xmath42 as @xmath43 or even @xmath44 does not guarantee that @xmath6 is lipschitz .",
    "this failure of lipschitz regularity is at the heart of the possibility of rapid growth of vorticity gradient .",
    "it is explicit in the bahouri - chemin example @xcite : take @xmath45 on @xmath46 ^ 2 $ ] and extend it to @xmath47 ^ 2 $ ] as an odd function in both variables .",
    "this defines a stationary solution of @xmath0 euler in the sense of equations  , and the flow near the origin is `` hyperbolic '' in the following specific sense :",
    "for @xmath48 small , it can be computed that for some absolute constant @xmath49 ( see denissov @xcite ) @xmath50 with some smooth functions @xmath51 .",
    "certain perturbations of this stationary solution were utilized in the works of denissov @xcite , kiselev - verk @xcite , and zlato @xcite ( in chronological order ) to obtain growth of vorticity gradient in the maximum norm @xmath52 .",
    "the growth rates of @xmath53 obtained in @xcite and @xcite were double exponential for arbitary long but finite time and exponential for all time , respectively . the groundbreaking work @xcite settled the possibility of double exponential growth of @xmath54 for all time , when the domain is a disc .",
    "the `` key lemma '' of kiselev and verk ( which was also utilized in @xcite ) is an essential tool in our arguments as well ( see below lemma [ lem : zlatos ] ) .    while our basic strategy to obtain growth of @xmath7 in @xmath20 is similar to that of the aforementioned works ,",
    "there are a number of notable differences in our setting .",
    "first , while the idea of `` linearizing '' around the bahouri - chemin stationary solution makes sense when considering only bounded vorticities , this solution does not belong to @xmath20 .",
    "hence , we needed to consider a different type of `` background '' vorticity , and our choice was to take a suitably localized version of the following function : @xmath55 with @xmath56 .",
    "the advantage of this initial vorticity is that it belongs to @xmath57 and the corresponding velocity @xmath58 satisfies @xmath59 .",
    "second , since we want localized solutions , it is not clear if the specific hyperbolic picture of the type near the origin will be sustained , even for a very short periodic of time . in view of this ,",
    "our strategy is to take an initial vorticity which extends over two different length scales @xmath60 and @xmath61 , and to show that vorticity outside the @xmath62-region , in the special time scale of @xmath63 , is sufficient to generate a hyperbolic flow which stretches the vorticity gradient on the @xmath62-region .    here",
    ", a caveat is that we could not exclude the possibility of our initial vorticity chunk getting `` squeezed '' in the angular direction even earlier than the scale @xmath63 , in which case we do not have a good lower bound on @xmath64 .",
    "hence our actual proof is based on a contradiction argument .",
    "this difficulty vanishes when the domain has a boundary : see remark [ rem : disc ]",
    ".    closing the introduction , let us mention that similar ill - posedness statements were recently established for the integer based @xmath65 spaces with @xmath66 of the velocity field @xmath6 , independently in the works of elgindi - masmoudi @xcite and bourgain - li @xcite .",
    "we refer the interested readers to the works @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite for an extensive list of references on the problem of well - posedness of the euler equations .",

    "when a constant depends on some parameters , we explicitly indicate dependence as subscripts .",
    "we use superscripts to refer to components of a vector : for example , @xmath70 and @xmath71 .",
    "our initial vorticity @xmath40 will be odd both in the variables @xmath72 and @xmath73 .",
    "since this symmetry persists for all time , we may view @xmath74 as defined just on @xmath46 ^ 2 $ ] . pick a large integer @xmath75 , and let us define the initial vorticity on @xmath46 ^ 2 $ ] as follows : @xmath76 where @xmath77 and @xmath78 are smooth bump functions . more specifically",

    "as mentioned in the introduction , we need to work with a special time scale . given @xmath84 and @xmath75 , we set @xmath85 and we shall track the evolution of initial data on the time interval @xmath86 $ ] . to get an idea of how this scale appears , recall that the main idea is to stretch vorticity in the @xmath62 region using the chunk of vorticity `` behind '' . since initially @xmath87 while @xmath82",

    "it is important that in this time scale , fluid particles can move only up to a factor of @xmath90 , see and below .",
    "our main technical tool is the following expression for the velocity due to kiselev and verk @xcite ; we use a version by zlato ( * ? ? ?",
    "* lemma 2.1 ) which works in the case of the torus @xmath91 .",

    ", we have @xmath93 with @xmath94 for @xmath95 .",
    "there are several striking features of this lemma , which we would like to emphasize .",
    "first , the expression essentially gives a _ pointwise _ control over the velocity gradient , just under the assumption that @xmath96 .",
    "it is surprising that such a control is available , especially because the formula is applicable even in situations where @xmath97 is unbounded .",
    "next , the integral in is _ monotone _ in @xmath74 , so that for the purpose of obtaining a lower bound on the velocity gradient , it suffices to find a region in space where vorticity is uniformly bounded from below . on the other hand",
    ", one should note that lemma [ lem : zlatos ] is applicable only when the integral term in dominates the remainder term @xmath98 .",
    "the following estimates are standard ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) and will play a complementary rle of the previous lemma .",
    "[ lem : standard ] let @xmath99 to be the solution triple for the @xmath0 euler equations in @xmath100 with initial data @xmath40 .",

    "although these estimates are well - known , we provide a proof of ( assuming the bound in ) , as it appears throughout the arguments given below .    for simplicity , we set @xmath106 , and from the definition of flow we have @xmath107 and applying the estimate gives a bound @xmath108 which implies @xmath109 denoting @xmath110 and @xmath111 as the unique solution of the respective ode system @xmath112 on the time interval @xmath113 $ ] with initial data @xmath114 , we obtain the desired estimates as @xmath115 .    , where the two rectangles represent the region where @xmath116 ( inner ) and @xmath117 ( outer ) .",

    "in other words , the initial data in grows at least by a multiple of @xmath225 ( in both scenarios ) .",
    "again , when we have a boundary available , it is not necessary to introduce @xmath121 and we obtain growth by a factor of @xmath226 for any @xmath173 as long as @xmath75 is sufficiently large .",

    "therefore it is intuitively clear that the data would escape @xmath2 immediately .",

    "it suffices to show that for @xmath347 $ ] , there exists some @xmath350 that @xmath74 is uniformly @xmath351 in @xmath352 , for any integer @xmath353 and some open set @xmath354 .",
    "we deduce this by inducting on @xmath355 .    for the base case of @xmath356 , take some open set @xmath357 which is still separated away from @xmath152",
    ". then we simply write @xmath358 which is bounded by an absolute constant via the hlder estimate once we choose @xmath359 where @xmath360 is the constant from .",
    "now we assume that @xmath74 is @xmath351 in @xmath352 with some @xmath353 , where @xmath361 and @xmath362 .",
    "we first pick some open set @xmath363 which satisfies @xmath364 in particular , @xmath363 is separated away from @xmath152 . for each @xmath365 , take a smooth cutoff function @xmath366 which equals 1 on @xmath367 and vanishes outside of @xmath352 .",
    "then , for @xmath368 , with the biot - savart kernel @xmath210 , we write @xmath369 regarding the first term , a classical singular integral estimate gives @xmath370 the second term is indeed @xmath32 in @xmath367 simply because @xmath371 is @xmath32 away from the origin .",
    "hence we deduce that @xmath15 is uniformly @xmath372 in @xmath367 . at this point",
    "we may extend @xmath15 to be @xmath372 on the entire domain @xmath100 to obtain @xmath373 . then solving @xmath374",
    "gives that @xmath375 is a @xmath372 flow , which coincides with @xmath323 whenever @xmath368 and @xmath376 .",
    "this can be done by obtaining an a priori estimate for @xmath377 and then argue along a ( smooth ) sequence of approximate solutions .",
    "note that @xmath378 so @xmath379 is invertible and the inverse function theorem gives that @xmath380 is also a @xmath372 diffeomorphism of the domain . from @xmath381",
    "differentiating both sides @xmath382 times , on the right hand side we obtain terms which contains up to the @xmath382th derivatives of @xmath40 ( composed with @xmath383 ) multiplied with some factors of @xmath383 also up to the @xmath382th derivatives . since each such factor is @xmath384 ,",
    "we conclude that @xmath74 is @xmath372 .",
    "this finishes the proof .",
    "in this section we discuss a few interesting open problems .",
    "we have shown that there are yudovich solutions of the @xmath0 euler equations on @xmath100 which are initially in the class @xmath2 but which do not belong to the class @xmath385 for any @xmath386 .",
    "one could ask whether even worse behavior is possible .",
    "in fact , the existing estimates do not rule out the existence of yudovich solutions with @xmath2 data which leave @xmath387 for every @xmath388 in finite time .",
    "[ losingestimate ] let @xmath389 be mean - zero .",
    "then , the unique yudovich solution satisfies the following estimate : @xmath390 for every @xmath391 with @xmath392 solving the ode : @xmath393 for some large universal constant @xmath123 .    by the john - nirenberg lemma , @xmath394 for some small universal constant @xmath360 . by a generalized young s inequality , @xmath395",
    "now , by passing to the lagrangian formulation ( and suppressing the composition with the flow maps ) we see : @xmath396 hence , @xmath397 now upon integrating and using our inequality for @xmath398 , we have : @xmath399 finally , choosing @xmath400 we get @xmath401    the bound in lemma [ losingestimate ] is sharp , in the sense that there exist yudovich solutions which continuously lose regularity .",
    "it seems that proving the conjecture is true ( for a short time ) is much more difficult on @xmath100 than on a domain with a boundary .",
    "though there have recently been numerous results on ill - posedness for the euler equations in critical spaces , it seems as though the case of @xmath403 vorticity ( or @xmath404 velocity ) is still open .",
    "consider the @xmath0 euler equations with partial viscosity on @xmath405 $ ] : @xmath406 notice that we have put viscosity only in the horizontal variable and , hence , we only need the no - slip boundary condition : @xmath407 on @xmath408 and @xmath409 .",
    "when @xmath410 , we see that @xmath2 data can leave @xmath2 initially using a modification of the proof of theorem [ thm : pat ] .",
    "in fact , it can be shown that @xmath411 becomes infinite . when @xmath412 this is no longer possible due to the energy equality : @xmath413    there a few regimes where one could study the behavior of the solutions of the partially viscous problem as @xmath414 .",
