    "therefore , there is very little direct observational information about the jet angular structure and dynamics , which make it difficult to interpret grb afterglow observations and infer from them important physical parameters such as the jet energy and opening angle , the external density profile , and the microphysical parameters of the relativistic collisionless shock powering the afterglow emission .",
    "most studies of grb jet dynamics during the afterglow phase have focused on a roughly uniform jet with well defined , sharp edges .",
    "we shall also focus on such a uniform jet , and only briefly remark on the expected relation to jets with a smoother angular structure ( also known as `` structured jets '' ) .",
    "the jet dynamics have been studied both analytically  @xcite and numerically , using two dimensional special relativistic numerical simulations  @xcite , as well as an intermediate approach where the dynamical equations are integrated over the radial profile of the thin shocked region , thus reducing the set of partial differential equations to one dimension  @xcite .",
    "let us consider a uniform double - sided jet of total energy @xmath4 , initial half - opening angle @xmath0 , and initial lorentz factor @xmath5 .",
    "grb observations suggest that typically @xmath6 . at early times , as long as @xmath7 , the bulk of the jet is causally disconnected from its edge and thus evolves as if it where part of a spherical flow with an energy @xmath8 , following the spherical  @xcite self - similar solution .",
    "this early phase corresponds to radii @xmath9 , where the jet radius @xmath10 is defined as the radius where @xmath1 for a spherical flow with @xmath11 . at @xmath12",
    "the bulk of the jet is in causal contact with its edge and the jet can in principal rapidly expand sideways .",
    "however , the degree of lateral spreading at this stage , which strongly affects the dynamics , is not well known . therefore , the jet dynamics at @xmath12 are still controversial .",
    "in particular , the radius @xmath13 at which the flow ( or jet ) becomes non - relativistic , still remains uncertain .",
    "the sedov length for a spherical flow with the true jet energy , @xmath14 ( i.e. the radius where it sweeps up a rest mass energy equal to its own energy and becomes non - relativistic ) , @xmath15 , is very close to @xmath10 .",
    "therefore , in order for the jet to be already close to spherical when it becomes non - relativistic ( i.e. at @xmath16 ) , it must expand sideways very quickly and become close to spherical already near @xmath10 [ i.e. @xmath16 can not be @xmath17 .",
    "this is indeed roughly what happens in simple analytic models , where the jet half - opening angle , @xmath18 , starts growing exponentially with radius near @xmath10 , and the jet quickly becomes close to spherical and non - relativistic at a radius @xmath19 , which is larger than @xmath10 only by a logarithmic factor and @xmath20 likely arises from the fact that in simple analytic models the swept - up mass at the radius where the jet becomes spherical is smaller than the external rest mass within a sphere of the same radius .",
    "] , while at @xmath21 the flow quickly approaches the newtonian , spherical , self - similar sedov - taylor solution .",
    "numerical simulations , however , suggest that most of the energy remains within the initial jet half - opening angle @xmath0 until the flow becomes mildly relativistic , and only then does the flow start to gradually approach spherical symmetry  @xcite . under the crude approximation that the jet does not expand sideways and",
    "keeps evolving as a conical section of a spherical flow up until the radius where it becomes non - relativistic , the latter is given by @xmath22 .",
    "in this case the flow is still highly non - spherical at @xmath16 , and only very gradually approaches spherical symmetry  @xcite .",
    "this clearly shows that without lateral expansion @xmath16 is significantly larger , by a factor of @xmath23 ( which is @xmath24 for @xmath25 ) , than if there is fast lateral expansion at @xmath12 .",
    "thus , the dynamics of the flow at small radii ( @xmath26 ) and at large radii ( @xmath27 ) are reasonably well known , while at intermediate radii ( @xmath28 ) they are still controversial . for typical values of @xmath29",
    "this range of radii may appear rather small , @xmath30 for exponential lateral expansion and @xmath31 for no lateral expansion up to @xmath32 with @xmath33 .",
    "however , it corresponds to a large range in observed times ( over which the corresponding afterglow emission reaches us ) , of @xmath34 and @xmath35 , respectively , since the observed time scales as @xmath36 , and @xmath37 decreases by a large factor ( of @xmath38 ) within this range of radii .",
    "most simulations so far were for @xmath39 , or even wider initial jet half - opening angles .",
    "recently , however , @xcite and later @xcite have performed simulations also for narrower initial jets , @xmath40 .",
    "@xcite have found that significant lateral spreading starts when @xmath37 drops below @xmath38 , as predicted by analytic models , and tried to reconcile the apparent discrepancy with analytic models by attributing it to their small range of validity after significant lateral spreading starts ( @xmath41 ) for the typical modest values of @xmath0 used in the simulations .",

    "this can be attributed to the fact that once the flow becomes sub - relativistic its sound speed quickly drops , and so does the rate of lateral expansion . moreover , as the flow gradually becomes more spherical the lateral gradients become smaller , which makes the flow approach spherical symmetry more slowly .",
    "the numerical simulations show that @xmath286 corresponding to lower energy percentiles ( or @xmath276-values ) approach their asymptotic values for a spherical flow at later times .",

    "in this work we have introduced a new , physically motivated recipe for the lateral expansion of the jet ( in   [ sec : recipe ] ) .",
    "it is based on the jump conditions for oblique shocks of arbitrary 4-velocity , which imply that the velocity of fluid just behind the shock front ( in the downstream region ) is in the direction of the local shock normal ( i.e. perpendicular to the shock front at that location ; @xmath289 , eq .  [ [ n_beta_hat ] ] ) in the upstream rest frame ( which in our case is identified with the rest frame of the external medium and the central source ) .",
    "our new recipe for the lateral expansion rate of the jet ( @xmath113 , eq .",
    "[ [ eq : new - recipe ] ] ) has an extra factor of @xmath290 in the denominator relative to the usual recipe that has been used so far ( @xmath112 , eq .  [ [ eq : old - recipe ] ] ) . this results in slower lateral expansion relative to the usual ( or old ) recipe at early times when @xmath291 , but faster lateral expansion at later times when @xmath259 , i.e. once the lateral expansion becomes significant .",
    "next ( in   [ sec : model ] ) , we have implemented our new recipe as well as the old recipe in a simple analytic model for the jet dynamics , which is valid only for high lorentz factors ( @xmath80 ) and narrow jet half - opening angles ( @xmath208 ) .",
    "this model shows an exponential lateral expansion for @xmath292 , like previous analytic models of this type .",
    "however , we demonstrate that for typical values of the initial jet half - opening angle ( @xmath293 ) this model is valid only over a very limited dynamical range for @xmath294 , so that the asymptotic exponential lateral expansion regime is hardly reached before the model breaks down .",
    "this leads to a reasonable agreement with numerical simulations over this limited range ( as shown by @xcite and in ",
    "[ sec : comp - sim ] ) .",
    "this motivated us ( in   [ sec : gen ] ) to generalize our relativistic model so that it would be valid for any values of @xmath37 and @xmath18 .",
    "this was done by switching to the 4-velocity @xmath103 ( instead of @xmath37 ) as the dynamical variable that we evolve ( so that it would vary significantly in both the relativistic and the newtonian regimes ) , and systematically not relying on any relativistic or small angle approximations .",
    "moreover , we have implemented two different assumptions for the accumulation of the swept - up external rest mass , corresponding to a different variant of the model .",
    "the trumpet model makes the usual assumption that the working surface is the part of a sphere of radius @xmath48 within a cone of half - opening angle @xmath56 .",
    "the conical model assumes that all the mass within a cone of half - opening angle @xmath56 was swept - up , so that once the flow becomes spherical the swept - up mass is equal to that originally within a sphere of the same radius .",
    "our relativistic , trumpet and conical models all agree at early times when the jet is still highly relativistic , narrow and hardly expanded sideways ( @xmath295 ) . at this stage",
    "the approximations of our relativistic model hold well and there are only very small differences in the swept - up mass between the trumpet and conical models .",
    "however , at later times when @xmath296 the relativistic model enters a phase of rapid , exponential sideways expansion and it quickly breaks down , before becoming spherical .",
    "we note , however , that for a stratified or stellar wind like external medium ( @xmath160 ) the jet is closer to being spherical than for a uniform or ism like external medium ( @xmath159 ; see _ bottom panel _ of fig .",

    ", the phase of rapid , exponential sideways expansion largely disappears for typical values of @xmath253 .",
    "this occurs because the jet is no longer ultra - relativistic soon after @xmath37 drops below @xmath38 , and once it becomes mildly or sub - relativistic its sound speed and therefore its rate of lateral expansion decrease compared to the ultra - relativistic regime .",
    "the conical model evolves somewhat faster than the trumpet model , since it accumulates external rest mass also from the sides of the jet , and thus it slows down faster . the smaller @xmath37 results in turn in even faster lateral expansion rate and a larger @xmath18 ( at a given radius @xmath48 or lab frame time @xmath69 ) .",
    "we compared ( in   [ sec : comp - sim ] ) our analytic models to the results of 2d special relativistic hydrodynamic simulations  ( from * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , finding that they provide a reasonable description of the numerical results at all times .",
    "therefore , they can be used for analytic calculations of the afterglow emission , and would provide more realistic results compared to previous analytic models .",
    "the main factor that significantly improves the agreement with simulations compared to previous analytic models is the fact that we have generalized the model to be valid also at modest lorentz factors @xmath37 and large jet half - opening angles @xmath18 .",
    "both our analytic generalized ( trumpet and conical ) models and the numerical simulations show that the jet first becomes sub - relativistic and only then gradually approaches spherical symmetry over a long time .    for typical initial half - opening angles ( @xmath297 )",
    "the phase of rapid exponential lateral spreading is largely eliminated and it is replaced by a quasi - logarithmic increase in @xmath18 with radius @xmath48 or lab frame time @xmath69 . @xcite have stressed that while noticeable sideways expansion starts for @xmath298 , this initially involves only a small fraction of the total jet energy in its outer parts , and the central parts of the jet that carry most of its energy take longer to start spreading their energy to wider angles . while it is true that the jet does not remain uniform ,",
    "the differences in the early growth of the angles @xmath286 containing different fractions @xmath276 of the jet energy , normalized by their initial value , is not very large ",
    "less than a factor of 2 in lab frame time or radius between @xmath287 and @xmath299 , and tend to become smaller for narrower @xmath0 .",
    "this can be seen from figure 4 of @xcite , which also shows that as @xmath0 is gradually decreased down to @xmath300 , its initial growth becomes steeper and it looks as if an early phase of exponential growth starts to develop , contrary to what is claimed in @xcite .",
    "therefore , we conclude that ( i ) although the uniform jet approximation used in our analytic models is obvious rather crude , it nonetheless provides a reasonable description of the energetically dominant part of the jet , and ( ii ) the prediction of our analytic models that an early exponential sideways expansion phase should exist for sufficiently small @xmath0 is not only consistent with the existing simulations , but these simulations even show a hint for the development of such a phase .",
    "this should obviously be tested more thoroughly by simulations that reach even lower values of @xmath0 .",
    "a phase of exponential lateral spreading was first found by  @xcite and @xcite using a simple analytic model .",
    "later ,  @xcite found a self - similar solution with a similar scaling .",
    "our main conclusion ( which is in agreement with @xcite ) is that such a phase will occur in practice only for jets that are initially extremely narrow ( with @xmath255 or so ) , while for more modest values of @xmath297 that are more typically inferred in grb jets , such a phase effectively does not exist .",
    "this basically reconciles the long lasting apparent discrepancy between analytic models and numerical simulations .",

    "we compare here our formulation for the jet lateral expansion rate , eq .",
    "( [ eq : new - recipe ] ) , with earlier work .",
    "this formula was first derived within the context of grbs by @xcite , who provided two different derivations .",
    "the first follows our line of argument and is based on the orthogonality of the shock front and the velocity of the fluid just behind it in the rest frame of the fluid ahead of the shock ( eq .  [ [ n_beta_hat ] ] ) .",
    "the second derivation involves an analysis of the dynamical equations integrated over the radial profile .    a result similar to eqs .",
    "( [ eq : alpha ] ) and ( [ eq : new - recipe ] ) was also recently derived by @xcite , based on an earlier work by  @xcite .",
    "@xcite has argued that it implies a negligible lateral expansion as long as @xmath80 unless @xmath301 , suggesting that with this model one obtains a slow sideways expansion , as seen in the numerical simulations .",
    "however , we note that the condition @xmath302 corresponds to @xmath303 .",
    "this requirement is too extreme since @xmath303 would result in a quasi - spherical flow within a single dynamical time ( since in that case @xmath304 ) . as is well known ( see also ",
    "[ sec : model ] ) , the traditional recipe for lateral expansion ( eq .  [ [ eq : old - recipe ] ] ) , namely @xmath305 , already gives an asymptotic exponential growth of @xmath18 with @xmath48 ( i.e. very rapid lateral expansion ) .",
    "the earlier work by  @xcite discusses two possible approximations for the dynamics of a non - spherical relativistic blast wave , both based on a thin shell approximation for the layer of shocked external medium that carries most of the energy , but with different additional assumptions : ( i ) the quasi - radial approximation ( used in the newtonian regime by * ? ? ?",
    "* ) in which each part of the shock is assumed to move in a radial trajectory as if it were part of a spherical flow with the same local conditions ( and in particular the same energy per solid angle , excluding rest energy , @xmath306 ) , and ( ii ) the  @xcite approximation , that the pressure behind the shock is uniform , i.e. the same at all locations behind the shock and is proportional to the average energy density in the region bounded by the shock front .",
    "the first approximation assumes that the energy per solid angle in the flow ( excluding rest energy ) does not change and remains equal to its initial value , @xmath307 . in this sense",
    ", it basically assumes no lateral expansion ( as the jet retains its initial angular structure in @xmath308 indefinitely ) , so that this is a model assumption in this case rather than a result .    the second approximation , which was originally used by @xcite in the newtonian regime , does not appear to be very appropriate for the relativistic regime where the angular size of causally connected regions is @xmath309 , so that that the local dynamics of a small portion of the flow should not be affected by the average energy per unit volume in the whole flow , which may be dominated by regions that are not in causal contact with it .",
    "a simple example of how the  @xcite approximation violates causality in the relativistic regime is that for a uniform external medium it implies that the velocity of the shock front is uniform  ( i.e. depends only on the lab frame time , but not on the location along the shock front ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which necessarily implies that the flow must approach spherical symmetry within a few dynamical times",
    ". becomes essentially independent of @xmath99 , since its local value is dominated by the recently shocked material , where the shock lorentz factor is uniform .",
    "] this obviously violates causality , since as we discussed in the introduction , a roughly uniform jet with reasonable sharp edges can not expand sideways significantly as long as @xmath310 , from causal considerations ( since its bulk is not in causal contact with its edges , and it does not `` know '' that it is not part of a spherical flow and should thus start expanding sideways ) .    @xcite reaches the conclusion that the two approximations give the same result in the extreme relativistic limit only because he explicitly assumed that in the quasi - radial approximation the energy per solid angle , @xmath283 , is not only independent of time , but also independent of the location along the shock front ( this can be seen from the fact that his energy integral is independent of @xmath99 ) .",
    "this assumption quickly leads to a quasi - spherical flow for a spherical external density profile , and the non - spherical solutions obtained by @xcite arise since he considered an exponential atmosphere , which is a highly non - spherical external density profile .",
    "the problem of interest for us , namely the dynamics of grb jets during the afterglow phase , involves a non - uniform initial distribution of the energy per solid angle , @xmath311 , and in such a case the two approximations are not equivalent in the extreme relativistic limit .",
    "therefore , we conclude that neither of these two approximations appears to be appropriate for studying the dynamics or degree of lateral spreading of grb jets during the afterglow phase ."
