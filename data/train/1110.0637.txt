    "graphene , the two dimensional layer of the carbon atoms with honeycomb lattice structure , has attracted a great deal of attention as a new promising material for nanoelectronics , since its experimental realization a few years ago@xcite .",
    "most of the peculiar properties of graphene is the result of its massless dirac spectrum of the low - lying electron - hole excitations , which in addition to the regular spin appear to come endowed with the two quantum degrees of freedom , the so called pseudospin and valley .",
    "the pseudospin represents the sublattice degree of freedom of the graphene s honeycomb structure , and the valley defines the corresponding degree of freedom in the reciprocal lattice@xcite .",
    "the effect of these additional quantum numbers has already been exploited by anomalous features of several quantum transport phenomena in graphene , including quantum hall effect@xcite , conductance quantization@xcite , klein tunneling@xcite and quantum shot noise@xcite .",
    "interestingly , the pseudospin and valley degrees of freedom in graphene have been proposed separately to be used for controlling the electronic devices in the same way as the electron spin is used in spintronic and quantum computing .",
    "et al._@xcite demonstrated an electrostatically controlled valley filter effect in graphene nanoribbons with zigzag edge which can be used for realizing valley valve structures in valleytronics ( valley - based electronics ) applications . on the other hand",
    "a pseudospin - based version of a spin valve has been proposed in bilayer graphene , where the pseudospin is determined by the relative amplitude of the wave function on the two layers@xcite .",
    "a bilayer pseudospin valve consists of two connected neighboring regions whose pseudospin polarizations can be tuned by application of gate voltages @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we study the possibility of realizing pseudospintronics in monolayer graphene within the scattering formalism",
    ". the possibility of an interaction driven spontaneous breaking of the pseudospin symmetry , which can lead to the realization of pseudomagnetic states in monolayer and bilayer graphene , has been studied recently@xcite . here",
    ", we demonstrate that the monolayer graphene with a gap in its electronic spectrum and an appropriate doping presents a pseudospin symmetry broken ferromagnet , with a finite pseudospin magnetization oriented vertically to the graphene plane .",
    "the magnitude of the pseudomagnetization ( pm ) depends on the chemical potential and its direction is switched by changing the type of doping ( electron n or hole p ) .",
    "based on the above observation , we propose a nonmagnetic pseudospin valve which consists of two pseudoferromagnetic ( pf ) regions separated by a non - pseudomagnetizaed normal ( n ) graphene of length l ( shown schematically in fig . [ fig:1]b ) . the pm direction in each region can be tuned independently by means of electrical gates , which allows for switching between parallel and antiparallel configurations .",
    "we find that the proposed pf / n / pf spin valve exhibits a relative difference of the electrical resistance in the two parallel and antiparallel states of the pseudomagnetizations , which can be remarkably large in analogy to the giant magnetoresistance ( gmr ) in magnetic multilayers@xcite .",
    "when the chemical potential of the system is tuned to be close to the energy gap ( @xmath0 ) , the pseudospin valve effect can be perfect pmr takes the value 1 for appropriate choices of the length @xmath1 .",
    "more importantly , we show that the perfect pseudospin valve effect can be reached even in higher chemical potentials @xmath2 by applying an appropriate bias voltage .",
