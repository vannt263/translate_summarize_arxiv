    "short - range potential models of simple analytic form have been the object of intense investigation over the last years .",
    "the main reason for such an interest is that they provide an approximate representation of the effective interactions and phase behavior experimentally observed in a variety of real systems .",
    "for instance , globular protein solutions , colloidal suspensions , and fullerenes at high temperature  @xcite .",
    "this scenario has been further enriched by recent investigations of gas - solid , solid - solid , and a metastable vapor - liquid transition in one of the most studied short - range models , namely the hard - core attractive yukawa ( hcay ) potential  @xcite .",
    "the hcay model is given by    @xmath2/r , & \\mbox { if $ \\sigma\\leq               r , $ }               \\end{array } \\right.\\ ] ]    where @xmath3 is the depth of the potential and @xmath4 is the hard - sphere diameter .",
    "the range of the potential is tuned by varying @xmath5 .",
    "our results are given in dimensionless units , such that @xmath6 for distance , @xmath7 for temperature ( @xmath8 is the boltzmann s constant ) , @xmath9 for density .",
    "many theoretical approaches have been used for studying the hcay fluid , for example : the barker - henderson perturbation theory  @xcite , the thermodynamic perturbation theory ( tpt )  @xcite and a variety of other mean field approaches based on truncation or approximate summation of perturbative series  @xcite , the mean spherical approximation ( msa )  @xcite , the modified hypernetted chain approximation ( mhnc )  @xcite and other integral equation theories  @xcite , the density functional theory  @xcite , the self - consistent ornstein - zernike approximation ( scoza )  @xcite , and the hierarchical reference theory ( hrt )  @xcite , among others . for all theories ,",
    "the most difficult regime to deal with is that of short interaction range , where an accurate localization of the vapor - liquid coexistence curve and of the critical point presents severe difficulties . sometimes , the shape of the coexistence curve is not reproduced correctly and critical points",
    "are not located correctly either , especially the critical density .",
    "we found that the critical density data reported by these approaches show different tendencies for shorter - range attractions , when we plot @xmath10 versus @xmath11 .",
    "these issues were some of the motivations to carry out this work .    for large values of @xmath12 ,",
    "the computer simulation data for hcay fluid are quite scarce . in this regime ,",
    "gibbs ensemble monte carlo ( gemc ) can not reproduce binodal curves  @xcite .",
    "the phase diagram at large @xmath5 was studied by monte carlo supplemented by thermodynamic integration ( mc - ti ) in ref .",
    "@xcite , but the results do not include the critical density . in our previous works we reported the coexistence properties of hcay fluid for long range tails .",
    "these properties were compared to those reported in the literature , and some differences were found among them  @xcite . in a recent work , singh  @xcite has reported the coexistence curves of short - range attractive yukawa ( sr - hcay ) fluid with @xmath13 , using grand - canonical transition - matrix monte carlo ( gc - tmmc ) with the histogram reweighting method .",
    "however , this method proves difficult to use in order to calculate coexistence properties at low temperature and high liquid densities  @xcite .",
    "so , nvt - mc simulations appear to be a more efficient method to calculate such properties for very short - range systems , where these conditions are met .    in view of the above considerations , the main goals of this paper are to demonstrate that there is a linear dependence between the critical density and the reciprocal of the critical temperature even for short interaction ranges , where theoretical approaches show different tendencies , and to report a systematic study of the liquid - vapor phase diagrams of sr - hcay fluid with @xmath14 and @xmath1 ,",
    "using canonical ensemble monte carlo simulation , where most theoretical approaches fail and other simulation techniques can not reproduce the binodal curves .",
    "finally , once again we have confirmed that the coexistence curves of sr - hcay model follow the law of corresponding states , i.e. , curves corresponding to different @xmath5 fall on top of each other within a high degree of accuracy , provided the density @xmath15 and temperature @xmath16 are rescaled by their critical values @xmath17 , @xmath18 .    besides",
    ", we have also reported the binodal curves and critical points predicted by scoza for the above values of @xmath5 .",
    "although the application of scoza to narrow yukawa potentials has been considered before  @xcite , an extensive comparison with simulation data for the phase diagram in this regime has not been possible so far because of the aforementioned paucity of simulations at large @xmath5 , and the present study represents a good opportunity to perform it .",
    "results were obtained both by the standard version of scoza considered in refs .",
    "@xcite , and by a modified version developed in  @xcite , where consistency with the virial route , which is disregarded in the original implementation , is partially taken into account .",
    "the comparison shows that some discrepancies between scoza and simulations are definitely present : specifically , the standard formulation of scoza overestimates both the critical density and critical temperature , while the converse happens with the modified formulation .",
    "the latter also predicts a nearly constant critical density at values of @xmath5 , for which the simulation show that this quantity still changes significantly .",
    "nevertheless , the overall agreement with the simulations is quite satisfactory .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "[ sec : simu ] the details of our simulations are briefly summarized ; in sec .",
    "[ sec : scoza ] , an overview of both the standard and the modified versions of scoza is given , and some issues relevant for the application of the theory to short - range interactions are discussed ; in sec .",
    "[ sec : results ] our results are presented and discussed ; in sec .",
    "[ sec : conclusions ] our conclusions are drawn .",
    "canonical ensemble monte carlo ( nvt - mc ) simulations of hcay fluid interface have been performed using metropolis algorithm . to prepare the initial configuration we placed @xmath19 particles in a face - centered cubic array in the middle of the simulation cell , which allowed us to obtain two interfaces with a vapor phase surrounding the liquid when the system is equilibrated ( see fig 2 of ref.@xcite ) .",
    "+ simulations were performed on a parallelepiped cell with dimensions @xmath20 , and @xmath21 .",
    "additional mc runs were carried out with @xmath22 and a larger number of particles  @xcite to check for finite - size effects , and no such effect was found .",
    "the cutoff radius was selected to @xmath23 .",
    "periodic boundary conditions were applied in all three directions and the neighbor list was applied to speed up calculation .",
    "the maximum particle displacement was adjusted to give a @xmath24 acceptance rate .",
    "the simulations were performed in cycles ; in every cycle it was attempted to move all the particles that are in the neighbor list .",
    "the system was equilibrated for @xmath25 cycles and the coexistence properties were calculated for @xmath26 cycles divided into @xmath27 blocks of @xmath28 cycles each one , in order to avoid density fluctuation . + the density profiles , @xmath29 ,",
    "were calculated every 50 cycles and at the end of each simulation run , every profile was fitted to a hyperbolic tangent function to obtain @xmath30 and @xmath31 values@xcite .",
    "the critical parameters for the hcay fluid were calculated by using the rectilinear diameter law  @xcite and the universal value @xmath32 for the critical exponent @xmath33 which gives the curvature of the liquid - vapor coexistence curve in the critical region .",
    "all the critical point parameters we calculated are listed in table  [ table1 ] .",
    "a detailed description of scoza and its application to a yukawa fluid has been given elsewhere and we refer the interested reader to the previous literature on this subject  @xcite . here",
    "we recall that , as usual in integral - equation theories , in the scoza the ornstein - zernike ( oz ) equation is closed by an approximate _ ansatz _ which involves the direct correlation function @xmath34 and the radial distribution function @xmath35 . in the standard formulation of scoza ,",
    "one requires that i ) the core condition @xmath36 be satisfied inside the hard core @xmath37 ; and ii ) the contribution to @xmath34 outside the hard core due to tail of the potential be linear in the potential itself . for a hcay potential one",
    "has then : @xmath38/r \\mbox{\\hspace{0.2 cm } } & \\mbox{if $ \\sigma\\leq r$ }   \\ , , \\end{array } \\right . \\label{closure}\\ ] ] where @xmath39 is the direct correlation function of the hard - sphere fluid .",
    "the functional form of this closure is similar to that of well - established theories such as the mean spherical approximation ( msa ) , where @xmath39 is identically vanishing for @xmath40 , or the optimized random - phase approximation ( orpa )  @xcite .",
    "however , in these approaches the amplitude @xmath41 of the direct correlation function coincides with the inverse temperature @xmath42 , while in the scoza @xmath41 is an _ a priori _ unknown function of the thermodynamic state , to be determined so that consistency between the compressibility and the internal energy route to the thermodynamic is obtained .",
    "the consistency requirement is embodied in the following condition on the reduced compressibility @xmath43 and the excess internal energy per unit volume @xmath44 : @xmath45 where @xmath43 and @xmath44 are obtained via the compressibility and internal energy route respectively .",
    "( [ consist ] ) together with closure  ( [ closure ] ) give a closed partial differential equation ( pde ) for @xmath44 , that can be solved numerically , provided the initial condition at @xmath46 and the boundary conditions at low and high density are specified .",
    "the solution procedure is made easier by the fact that , for a given @xmath41 , the oz equation with closure  ( [ closure ] ) can be solved analytically , if @xmath34 for @xmath40 is given by a superposition of yukawa tails  @xcite .",
    "this is indeed the case , provided one adopts the waisman parametrization for the hard - sphere direct correlation function @xmath39  @xcite . according to this , @xmath39 for @xmath40 is also given by a yukawa tail with known , density - dependent amplitude and range , so that @xmath34 for @xmath40 consists of the superposition of two yukawas .",
    "on the other hand , for non - yukawa intermolecular potentials the scoza @xmath34 for @xmath47 is not of yukawa form , irrespective of the parametrization adopted for @xmath39 , and in order to implement scoza a fully numerical solution of the oz equation is usually required  @xcite .    in conventional scoza , the virial route is not included in the consistency condition .",
    "in order to enforce consistency among all the three routes , one has to endow eq .",
    "( [ closure ] ) with one more degree of freedom . to this purpose , the following form for @xmath34",
    "was proposed  @xcite : @xmath48/r \\nonumber \\\\   & & \\mbox{}+h \\exp[-z(r-\\sigma)]/r \\mbox{\\hspace{0.8cm}if $ \\sigma\\leq r$ } \\ , , \\label{gmsa}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the amplitude of the ( attractive ) yukawa potential has now been set to @xmath49 as in the msa , while both the amplitude @xmath50 and the inverse range @xmath51 of the extra yukawa tail must be determined by imposing consistency among virial , compressibility , and internal energy .",
    "this approach is very similar to that originally proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite , which is obtained from eq .",
    "( [ gmsa ] ) by having the last yukawa to account also for the hard - sphere contribution to @xmath34 outside the repulsive core , thereby setting @xmath52 in eq .",
    "( [ gmsa ] ) .",
    "a fully numerical implementation of that closure was considered in ref .",
    "@xcite , but the numerical algorithm failed to converge in the critical region .",
    "in a recent work  @xcite , a different strategy was adopted : on the one hand , the analytical solution of the oz equation for a @xmath34 given by a superposition of yukawas ( three when also @xmath39 is taken into account ) for @xmath47 was again exploited . on the other hand , consistency with the virial route",
    "was required to hold only at the critical point , and @xmath51 was fixed at the value at which this condition is satisfied , thereby making the theory considerably easier to implement .",
    "this is the approach used here together with the standard scoza of eqs .",
    "( [ closure ] ) , ( [ consist ] ) . in the following the standard and modified versions of scoza will be referred to as s - scoza and m - scoza respectively .    before concluding this section , it is worthwhile adding some remarks about the relevance of the high - density boundary condition for the scoza pde . while the boundary condition at low density is trivial , since one must have @xmath53 , @xmath54 for every @xmath49 , the behavior at high density poses more problems .",
    "in fact , this is not known beforehand , so that there is a certain amount of arbitrariness on the form of the corresponding boundary condition . for instance , in refs .",
    "@xcite , the boundary condition was imposed on @xmath55 , which was set to the value obtained by the so - called high - temperature approximation ( hta )  @xcite , i.e. , by replacing @xmath44 with its zeroth - order contribution in an expansion in powers of @xmath49 . in ref .",
    "@xcite , instead , the boundary condition was imposed directly on @xmath44 rather than on its derivative , and @xmath44 was determined using the @xmath35 obtained via the orpa , which amounts to setting @xmath56 in eq .",
    "( [ closure ] ) .",
    "since there is not any obvious recipe for singling out a specific high - density boundary condition , a natural requirement is that the results should not depend on the detailed form of such a condition , or on the density @xmath57 at which it is imposed .",
    "this turns out to be indeed the case , provided @xmath57 is high enough . for lennard - jones like tails , such as that corresponding to the widely adopted value @xmath58  @xcite , setting the high - density boundary at @xmath59 proves to be amply sufficient .",
    "however , for interactions of shorter range , such as those considered in ref .",
    "@xcite as well as in the present paper , @xmath57 must be shifted to substantially higher densities .",
    "this was also observed in a fully numerical implementation of scoza for a square - well fluid  @xcite .",
    "in fact , for the largest value of @xmath51 considered here , @xmath60 ( see table  [ table1 ] ) , @xmath57 must be at least as high as the close - packing density @xmath61 , and at even larger @xmath51 one needs to move @xmath57 beyond close packing .",
    "this requirement sounds quite unphysical , but one should keep in mind that here the effect of the singular repulsion is described at the level of the carnahan - starling equation of state  @xcite , which is itself unaware of close packing , and has the compressibility vanish at the unphysical value @xmath62 rather than at @xmath63 .",
    "the hta for @xmath44 is expected to become exact at close packing  @xcite , but in view of the above , it is not surprising that one might need to go beyond close packing for the hard - sphere repulsion to overwhelm the attractive part of the interaction in @xmath35 .",
    "if the boundary is not located at sufficiently high @xmath57 , the results turn out to be very sensitive with respect to both a shift in @xmath57 , and the details of the boundary condition .",
    "this observation is relevant for some of the results reported in ref .",
    "@xcite , where both s - scoza and m - scoza calculations were performed for different values of @xmath51 , but the high - density boundary was always kept fixed at @xmath59 .",
    "this is adequate for @xmath64 , but for larger @xmath51 it leads to an underestimation of both the critical density and the critical temperature with respect to the genuine scoza result , which becomes more and more severe as @xmath51 is increased .",
    "the results presented here are not affected by this spurious effect , and are meant to supersede those shown in table  i of ref .",
    "we start our discussion with an analysis of the critical values of hcay fluid .",
    "table  [ table1 ] presents the reduced critical temperature @xmath65 and density @xmath66 for a wide range of @xmath5 predicted by both simulations and several theoretical approaches , namely , the s - scoza and m - scoza described in the previous section , the tpt by zhou  @xcite , and the equation of state ( eos ) by duh and mier - y - teran  @xcite .",
    "we recall that , as @xmath67 is increased , the liquid - vapor critical point becomes metastable with respect to freezing . according to many theoretical and simulation studies  @xcite ,",
    "for @xmath68 the metastable regime has alreday set in .",
    ".critical parameters of hcay fluid .",
    "+ @xmath69gran canonical monte carlo with finite - size scaling .",
    "+ @xmath70the calculation for this value of @xmath5 had already been performed in ref .",
    "@xcite , but the result had not been tabulated .",
    "+ @xmath71 was obtained using eq .",
    "( 4 ) from ref .  @xcite . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     figure  [ fig : coex ] also shows the coexistence curves and the critical points predicted by s - scoza , and the m - scoza critical points .",
    "m - scoza coexistence curves have not been reported , because we could not rule out the possibility that they may be affected by significant numerical errors .",
    "it appears that the main source of discrepancy between the simulation and theoretical phase diagrams lies in the position of the critical points whose densities and temperatures , as observed above , are both slightly overestimated by s - scoza .",
    "+        figure  [ fig : coexscal ] shows the reduced density as a function of the reduced temperature .",
    "all curves of short range hcay fluid form a single master curve within a very good degree of accuracy , as it was reported by one of us in a previous work for longer range  @xcite . as the range is decreased , a slight trend towards a widening of the coexistence curve can be detected , but this effect remains small for the ranges considered here .",
    "also , the coexistence curves reported by singh  @xcite using gc - tmmc are on the master curve .",
    "the same behavior has been found for the mie(n , m ) potential  @xcite .",
    "these results confirm that , even for the short range interactions considered here , with inverse - range parameter as large as @xmath72 , the vapor - liquid phase diagrams of hcay fluid obey the law of corresponding states .",
    "this fact could be used to test theoretical approaches .",
    "we have carried out a systematic study of the liquid - vapor phase diagrams for hard - core attractive yukava potential with @xmath73 and @xmath1 , using nvt - mc simulation .",
    "our coexistence curves for @xmath74 and @xmath75 were compared to those reported by singh using gc - tmmc .",
    "an excellent agreement was found between them . besides",
    ", we have shown that reduced coexistence curves of hcay fluid from @xmath76 to @xmath72 follow the law of corresponding states , as it was shown in a previous work  @xcite for longer interaction ranges . once again",
    ", we have confirmed the linear relationship between the critical density and inverse critical temperature for critical simulation data in this interval of @xmath5 .",
    "the simulation results were compared with several theories , including the standard formulation of scoza ( s - scoza ) as well as a modified version ( m - scoza ) implementing a partial consistency with the virial route , which is disregarded in the standard version .",
    "the comparison shows that s - scoza slightly overestimates both the critical temperature and the critical density with respect to the simulation results , while the converse is true for m - scoza .",
    "nevertheless , the agreement with the simulations is quite good for all the values of @xmath5 considered in this paper . both simulation and theory give a dependence of the critical temperature as a function of the interaction range in substantial agreement with noro - frenkel scaling .",
    "however , whether the second virial coefficent at the critical temperature @xmath77 tends to a constant as @xmath5 diverges , thereby making noro - frenkel scaling hold at arbitrarily short range as in the square - well case  @xcite , could not be established on the basis of our simulation data , and remains to be assessed .",
