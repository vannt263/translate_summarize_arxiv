    "there is currently a great interest in relativistic dissipative hydrodynamics , mainly due to its application to the description of the hot dense qcd matter created in the relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) experiments @xcite .",
    "the application of the ads / cft correspondence @xcite to study strongly coupled conformal plasmas unaccessible to kinetic theory , has also fueled considerable interest in the formal aspects of this formalism .",
    "the study of the hydrodynamic regime of conformal field theories is important since qcd is approximately conformal at high temperatures @xcite .",
    "the need for dissipative corrections in modeling heavy - ion collisions is ( at least ) two - fold .",
    "first , quantum uncertainty prevents the existence of a perfect fluid .",
    "since first - order relativistic hydrodynamics @xcite is known to have strong drawbacks , among them lack of stable solutions and acausal propagation of perturbations , one should really go to second - order theories ( see however refs .",
    "second , the description of heavy - ion collisions in terms of perfect hydrodynamics works well in almost central au+au collisions near midrapidity , but gradually breaks down in non - central collisions and at forward rapidity @xcite .",
    "the complete second - order stress - energy tensor of a strongly coupled conformal fluid in @xmath0 space - time was given independently by baier et al @xcite , and by bhattacharyya et al @xcite .",
    "recently , loganayagam @xcite developed a very useful weyl - covariant formalism and proposed a local entropy current consistent with the second - order @xmath1 derived previously and with the second law ( see also related work of romatschke , ref .",
    "one of the most important results of refs .",
    "@xcite is that these works show that the hydrodynamic description of a conformal fluid does not belong to the conventional israel - stewart @xcite formalism ( see also refs .",
    "@xcite for a discussion of this issue ) .",
    "this is because the conventional ( or entropy - wise ) is theory , not being a controlled gradient expansion @xcite , can not account for shear - shear coupling , which is present in the stress - energy tensor of the conformal fluid @xcite ( see refs . @xcite for interesting discussions on this and related issues in the context of dissipative fluid dynamics as derived from kinetic theory ) .",
    "the main purpose of this paper is to set up a consistent hydrodynamical description of a conformal field theory within the theoretical framework of divergence - type theories ( dtts ) @xcite .",
    "our goal is to go beyond second order theories ( in velocity gradients ) by formulating a theory in closed form , that is , without reliance on adiabatic expansions .",
    "we will not tackle the full problem of a conformal fluid in curved space - time @xcite , but limit ourselves to minkowski space - time .",
    "another aim of this work is to analyze the causality properties of the dtt developed here , and to compare our results for the stress - energy tensor with those obtained from the derivative expansions of ref .",
    "we note that we do not calculate transport coefficients in this paper , but assume they are known either via kinetic theory or the ads / cft correspondence .",
    "dtts are interesting alternatives to the is formalism ( although they may be physically equivalent in certain cases ) because the conditions for hyperbolicity and causality of the full _ nonlinear _ evolution can be stated in very simple terms . as clearly shown by liu , muller and ruggeri @xcite , dtts are often more general and flexible than the is theory , allowing a systematic derivation of nonlinear terms in constitutive equations , which are not captured by entropy - wise is theory ( see refs .",
    "@xcite ) . besides , they have the extra advantage that , being the equations of motion of divergence type , discontinuous solutions ( shocks )",
    "can be given mathematical meaning , which is relevant to the phenomenon of conical flow in heavy - ion collisions @xcite . moreover , and this is an important point for what follows , the symmetries of the theory can be coded directly on the generating function of the dtt .",
    "the main results we arrive at are that : ( i ) for the case in which the second - order transport coefficients @xmath2 and @xmath3 vanish , the second - order ( in velocity gradients ) stress - energy tensor constructed from conformal invariants @xcite , can be consistently derived via an adiabatic expansion from the dtt we set up ; and ( ii ) the dtt and its adiabatic expansion are causal for states near equilibrium , and satisfy the second law .",
    "we also obtain , as a simple illustration , the hydrodynamic equations of the dtt for the case of boost invariant flow , and compare them to those of the second - order theory .",
    "our numerical results show that the dtt approaches the ideal fluid behaviour faster than the second - order theory .",
    "we believe that the dtt presented here may be useful in the study of two aspects of heavy - ion collisions , both of which seem to require theories going beyond second - order velocity gradients .",
    "first , early - time dynamics , where velocity gradients are not small and for which even is formalism shows unphysical behaviour such as reheating @xcite ( see also chesler and yaffe @xcite , who study the creation and evolution of a boost invariant anisotropic plasma directly from the gravity side , and el , xu and greiner @xcite , who develop a novel third order theory ) .",
    "second , the evolution of initial state fluctuations @xcite , for which higher order terms are crucial ( see particularly the work of lublinsky and shuryak @xcite , who developed a linearized hydrodynamical theory that includes , in principle , all - order velocity gradients ) . in this respect ( that of  resumming \" higher order velocity gradients ) , the developments of ref . @xcite are related to ours .",
    "we note that the dtt developed here containts , in addition , all quadratic terms in velocity .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [ app1 ] , we briefly review divergence - type theories . in section",
    "[ main ] we first review some basic properties of the hydrodynamics of conformal field theories , and then set up the divergence - type theory of a conformal fluid .",
    "we also prove that the dtt satisfies the second law exactly , and obtain the hydrodynamic equations . in section [ caus ]",
    "we investigate the causality properties of the dtt , for fluid states near equilibrium . in section [ eqsmotion ] , we show that the dissipative part of the stress - energy tensor obtained from second - order ( in velocity gradients ) conformal invariants can be obtained from a consistent adiabatic expansion of the dtt .",
    "we note that the dtt can not reproduce terms containing the vorticity tensor . in section [ boost ]",
    "we compare , analytically and numerically , the hydrodynamic equations of the dtt and of the second - order theory for the case of bjorken flow . the paper closes up with a brief summary of results .",

    "this means that every dtt is completely determined once @xmath25 and @xmath9 are specified as algebraic functions of @xmath26 .",

    "we think that the theory we have presented may be useful in the analysis of early - time dynamics and in the evolution of initial state fluctuations in heavy - ion collisions , essentially because the theory is not based on an expansion in velocity gradients .",
