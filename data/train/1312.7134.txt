    "one of the main concerns in the study of ultra - relativistic collisions is the investigation of the quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) properties . in this regard the thermodynamical aspects of the plasma is specially interesting due not only to the possibility of studying the deconfinement process but also because it can give important information to other fields , like hydrodynamical models of the qgp , cosmological models of the early universe and models of massive objects in astrophysics .",
    "the non extensive statistics has been applied to a large number of problems since the seminal paper by c. tsallis in 1988  @xcite .",
    "an updated list of applications and studies on the subject can be found in  @xcite . in high energy physics ( hep )",

    "a large number of works reporting the use of the non extensive formalism have been published since the bcm work , all of them showing a good agreement with experiments ( see for instance  @xcite ) .",
    "more recently a non extensive generalization of the hagedorn s theory  @xcite was developed in  @xcite showing that not only a limiting ( or critical ) temperature , @xmath3 , exists but also that there is an entropic index , @xmath4 , which characterizes the hadronic systems at least for the confined regime .",
    "also a new formula for the hadronic mass spectrum in terms of @xmath3 and @xmath4 was derived from that theory and in ref .",
    "@xcite it is shown that this formula can describe quite well the spectrum of known hadronic states with masses from the pion mass up to @xmath5 .",
    "the non extensive self - consistent theory  @xcite imposes much more restrictive tests to the applicability of the tsallis statistics in hep and a number of analysis of experimental data  @xcite have shown that the theoretical predictions are in agreement with the experimental findings .",

    "it is important to notice that the @xmath34-independent contributions @xmath58 and @xmath59 , which appear for fermions when @xmath1 in @xmath60 and @xmath61 respectively , have been disregarded in previous works , see e.g.  @xcite .",
    "these terms are consequence of the discontinuity in the integrand of eq .",

    "however , in this and in other works it has not been taken into account the effect coming from the fact that the location of the discontinuity is a function of the chemical potential @xmath6 , as in the momentum variable the discontinuity appears at @xmath62 .",

    "the entropy is then obtained by deriving the partition function with respect to temperature , as in eq .",
    "( [ eq : sthermo ] ) . when making the computation one can realize that if one considered @xmath76 instead of @xmath77 in the occupation number for @xmath19 , see eq .",

    "( [ eq : sm ] ) has also the peculiar issue that it leads to negative values in the zero temperature limit , while the entropy of  @xcite does not , see fig .",

    "we conclude that the partition function in eq .",
    "( [ partitionfunc ] ) does represent the relevant function for an ideal quantum gas in tsallis statistics .",
    "observe that for @xmath47 and @xmath34 sufficiently high the partition function defined here is similar to those used in refs .",
    "@xcite to extend hagedorn s theory to non extensive statistics .",
    "therefore definition given here is in accordance with the non extensive self - consistent thermodynamics . in the following",

    "before studying the properties of a thermodynamically equilibrated hadronic system in the non extensive thermodynamics we have to find the region where this system can exist .",
    "in fact , due to the transition from confined to deconfined regimes , the hadronic matter can be found only below the phase transition line .",
    "there are different proposals for the conditions determining the transition line .",
    "cleymans and redlich  @xcite pointed out that the transition line can be determined by the condition that @xmath81 .",
    "this result was obtained through a systematic analysis of particle yields from hep experiments . in @xcite",
    "the transition line was obtained in terms of the total baryon density with the help of the hadron resonance gas model . in @xcite",
    ", the freeze - out condition was determined from an interpolation between a resonance gas used at low densities and repulsive nucleonic matter at low temperatures . in @xcite ,",
    "the author proposed that the chemical freeze - out of hadrons in heavy - ion collisions is characterized by the entropy density and its value was taken from lattice qcd ( lqcd ) calculations at zero chemical potential . in an interesting and more recent analysis @xcite ,",
    "higher order multiplicity moments obtained with the hadron resonance gas were used in the calculation of the standard deviation , the variance ( or susceptibility ) , the skewness and the kurtosis , quantities which are related to the cumulants @xcite , that can be experimentally determined and are also of interest in lqcd calculations .",
    "the chemical freeze - out curve was then described in terms of the susceptibility of the system .    in the present work we use two different methods to find the transition line : the condition that @xmath81 , as in refs .",
    "@xcite , and the entropy density condition proposed in ref .",
    "these conditions were compared with a systematic analysis of particle yields from hep experiments , where the boltzmann s statistics was used , but since yields are calculated by the integration over all energy states , and considering that the differences between the distributions obtained through boltzmann statistics and tsallis statistics are relevant only in the high energy tail , we can assume with some confidence that the same relation holds in the non extensive case .",
    "of course this assumption must be checked by a similar analysis of experimental data , now using the non extensive formulas derived here , a task that is beyond the scope of the present work .",
    "however we present below some evidences that this hypothesis is correct .    in the following",
    "we assume that the entropic index , @xmath4 , is a fixed property of the hadronic matter with its value determined in the analysis of @xmath2-distributions and in the study of the hadronic mass spectrum in ref .",

    "the system of interest here is a gas composed by different hadronic species in thermodynamical and chemical equilibrium .",
    "the partition function is then given by @xmath84 where @xmath85 refers to the chemical potential for the _ i - th _ hadron .",
    "the lowest - lying hadrons considered in our calculations are taken from the particle data group  @xcite , and some of them are presented in tables  [ tablemesons ] and [ tablebaryons ] .",

    "( @xmath86 anti - baryons ) , including degeneracies , which correspond to a maximum value of the mass about @xmath87 and @xmath88 respectively .",
    "the computation will be performed by restricting the ensemble summation in eq .",
    "( [ eq : logz ] ) to zero strangeness ( see  @xcite for details )",
    ". we will focus first on a study of the phase transition by assuming @xmath47 for all mesons and considering that all baryons have the same chemical potential value @xmath89 .",
    "after that , the effect of a nonzero value of the chemical potential for pions will be explored as well .",
    "we have not compared our results with lqcd data because these data are available only up to baryon chemical potentials much lower than the ones we need to cover the whole @xmath90 plane @xcite . in @xcite ,",

    "<S> we show that at similar conditions , the non extensive statistics provide a harder equation of state than that provided by the boltzmann - gibbs statistics . </S>"
