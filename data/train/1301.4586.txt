    "these experimental efforts should be accompanied by theoretical studies to understand how external fields modify the internal structure of these systems .    in the recent years , a series of studies of the rotational spectrum of several diatomic molecules in a @xmath1 electronic state exposed to combined electric and magnetic fields were performed  @xcite .",

    "the next key structural ingredient is given by the electronic spin and orbital angular momentum , i.e. , molecules in a @xmath2 or @xmath3 electronic state .",
    "these systems are ideal to analyze the interplay between the spin - orbit coupling and the rotational structure in the presence of external fields . furthermore , the zeeman and stark effects might be comparable for moderate field strengths . at the end of the 1990s",
    ", polar @xmath2 molecules were investigated in congruent fields with the focus on their directional properties and the possibility of trapping them  @xcite .",
    "recently , open shell diatomic molecules , in @xmath3 electronic states , exposed to combined electric and magnetic fields have been also analyzed from both theoretical and experimental point of views  @xcite .",
    "the avoided crossings in the field - dressed spectrum of oh were used to transfer population between two states of opposite parity , and the trap dynamics was observed in combined fields  @xcite .",
    "the theoretical analysis has been carried out under the assumption that the total angular momentum remains approximately constant , and , therefore , only the coupling between different @xmath0-doublet states has been taken into account  @xcite .",
    "the present study goes beyond this approximation and aims at an extended approach to the rotational motion of an open shell dimer in a @xmath3 electronic state in combined electric and magnetic fields .",
    "in particular , we describe it within the rigid rotor approximation including the fine structure interactions and the @xmath0-doubling effects . taking as prototype examples the lio and oh radicals in their @xmath3 electronic ground state ,",
    "we explore a wide range of field strengths and two different regimes characterized by : i ) the field - dressed dynamics taking place within a certain rotational manifold ; and ii ) the possibility of mixing states in neighbouring rotational manifolds of the @xmath4 fine structure component .",
    "our focus is on the energy shifts , the directional properties , and the hybridization of the angular motion as either the electric or magnetic field strengths , or the inclination angle between them is varied .",
    "we also investigate field - induced couplings between levels of the fine structure components @xmath5 and @xmath4 by using the external fields . for a molecule with small rotational splitting , we show that the coupling between the spin and rotational degrees of freedom could be achieved at realistic field strengths .",
    "it has been shown recently , that the spin - rotational coupling can be exploited for tailoring the interactions between ultracold molecules  @xcite .",
    "we show that similarly the presence of quasi - degenerate @xmath0-doublets of states provide versatile tools for shaping the properties of ultracold molecules .",

    "thus , for small variations of the electric field strength , a molecule prepared in the anti - oriented state would flip its dipole moment and turn into oriented . such an electric field steered dipole switcher could have applications in tailoring the interactions between polar molecules . by ramping the electric field strength through these crossings at different speeds , the landau - zener dynamics could be studied and the landau - zener tunneling probability measured . for a strong enough electric field with @xmath211 , the pairs of states @xmath212 have very close orientation .",
    "all the @xmath85 levels of lio are orientated parallel to the field in the strong dc - field regime , and their @xmath186 increases as @xmath43 is increased .     and",
    "@xmath85 states of oh , the expectation value @xmath186 is shown versus the electric field strength for ( a ) @xmath75 , ( b ) @xmath179 , ( c ) @xmath187 and ( d ) @xmath182 , with @xmath183  t. the labeling of the states is done as in . ]        to illustrate the impact of an additional magnetic field on the hybridization of the angular motion of lio , we have plotted the expectation value @xmath140 of @xmath191 and @xmath199 as a function of @xmath43 in  ( a ) and  ( b ) , respectively . there",
    "we provide a comparison between the results of the field configurations @xmath183  t with @xmath75 , @xmath184 @xmath185 and @xmath7 with those obtained with only an electric field .",
    "as indicated above , the level @xmath191 suffer real crossings with neighbouring levels for @xmath75 ; and due to the level reordering it suffers an avoided crossings for @xmath211 with a state in the same @xmath85 manifold .",
    "the effect of this avoided crossing on @xmath140 is very small , because both levels have the same field - free value of @xmath140 .",
    "thus , independently of @xmath13 , its @xmath140 shows a smooth and increasing behaviour as @xmath43 is increased .",
    "furthermore , independently of @xmath43 , @xmath140 achieves the largest value in the absence of the magnetic field .",
    "this is explained by the increase of the energy separation of this state from the neighbouring @xmath119 levels for @xmath211 , which results in a reduction of the hybridization of the angular motion , and , therefore , of @xmath140 .",
    "a different behaviour is observed for the state @xmath199 .",
    "for all these field configurations , @xmath199 has the larger energy within the @xmath85 manifold of @xmath4 and shows a low - field seeking character when the dc field is turned on . as a consequence , it suffers several avoided crossings with high - field seekers from the @xmath119 manifold of @xmath4 , which are reflected as abrupt changes of @xmath140 when @xmath43 is varied .",
    "note that for @xmath179 and @xmath185 , this state undergoes two consecutive avoided crossings .",

    "the behavior for a weak electric field illustrates nicely an interesting feature of open shell states compared to @xmath40 electronic states : in the presence of only a magnetic field , the ground state @xmath193 is separated from @xmath199 by the @xmath0-doubling splitting . by switching on an electric field ,",
    "these two almost degenerate states mix immediately , and the oriented superposition becomes the ground state while the anti - oriented one increases in energy with @xmath43 ( see and ) .",
    "the two states of this doublet are indeed strongly oriented and antioriented , respectively , before they start to interact with other states .",
    "if one could prepare the ground state in such a field configuration , this amounts to a two - level molecule with an oriented and an antioriented component .",
    "if the dc field is turned on slowly , the molecule adiabatically follows the oriented ground state . whereas , population could be transferred to the antioriented level if the switching on is done fast enough . in a molecular ensemble , where dipole - dipole interaction has to be taken into account ,",
    "this allows one to access different phases of the many - body ( spin- ) system by tuning the field parameters or the speed of the field ramps .",
    "the implementation of spin hamiltonians with a high degree of control over the system parameters may be achieved this way .",
    "also , field parameters could be used to shape the intermolecular interactions themselves  @xcite .      here",
    "we analyze the impact of increasing the magnetic field strength , when the system is also exposed to an electric field , which is turned on first . for the @xmath85 levels of the lio and oh @xmath4 electronic states , and display the energies and orientation cosines as @xmath81",

    "we encounter several exact crossings among these levels , whose positions are different for lio and oh .",
    "the directional properties of oh are not affected by the additional magnetic field .",
    "in contrast , @xmath186 increases ( decreases ) for the levels of lio with field - free even ( odd ) parity as @xmath81 is enhanced .    when the fields are tilted , all the real intersections become avoided , and the complexity of the field - dressed spectrum increases significantly . the widths of these avoided crossings increases as @xmath13",
    "is increased toward @xmath7 . compared to lio ,",
    "the avoided crossings in oh are broader .",
    "for instance , the oh levels @xmath216 and @xmath204 suffer an avoided crossing at @xmath217  t with @xmath218  @xmath89 , whereas for lio it occurs at @xmath219  t with @xmath220  @xmath89 .",
    "the states @xmath213 and @xmath199 do not suffer any avoided crossing , and their orientation smoothly varies as @xmath81 is increased . compared to the parallel field configuration , their absolute orientation @xmath210 is reduced . for the remainder of the states , @xmath186 changes abruptly in the proximity of the avoided crossing .",
    "once the magnetic field is strong enough their @xmath186 also shows a smooth behaviour as a function of @xmath81 .      in this section ,",
    "we investigate the impact of the inclination angle on the rotational dynamics . for the lowest lying rotational manifold of lio , i.e. , the @xmath85 levels of @xmath4 , we present in  ( a ) and  ( b ) the energy and orientation of the dipole moment with respect to the electric field , @xmath186 , respectively , as a function of @xmath13 with @xmath139  kv / cm and @xmath221  t. in this regime of field strengths , only states within a rotational manifold suffer avoided crossings with each other .",
