    "in the past 20 years , neutrino oscillations  where a beam of one flavor of neutrino evolves to have components of other flavors  have gone from speculation to demonstration .",

    ", this extension may not be the entire story .",
    "indeed , experimental clues are arising that seem to point to additional , noninteracting ( `` sterile '' ) neutrino states . among the experimental results ,",
    "the lsnd and miniboone experiments have been crucial motivators for the recent explosion of interest in this topic @xcite .",
    "this excitement in the community , as well as the end of miniboone running in 2012 , provides the _ raison detre _ for a review of the lsnd and miniboone results at this time .    to understand why richer phenomenology is motivated",
    ", one must consider the observed `` mass splittings '' measured in neutrino oscillation experiments .",
    "these are the differences between the squared mass values .",
    "a model with three neutrinos will have two independent mass splittings .",
    "in the presently accepted picture of neutrino oscillations , the magnitude of the mass splitting between @xmath8 and @xmath9 is @xmath11 ev@xmath1 , and @xmath9 and @xmath10 is @xmath12 ev@xmath1 @xcite .",
    "however , experimental results indicate @xmath13 evidence for oscillations with @xmath0 ev@xmath1 . a way to accommodate this higher mass splitting is the introduction of sterile neutrinos that act as new flavors that mix with the standard model flavors but do not couple to the @xmath14 or @xmath15 , thereby avoiding the limits on extra active neutrino flavors @xcite .",
    "this paper focuses primarily on lsnd and miniboone , two experiments that were constructed to probe the @xmath161 ev@xmath1 region . in 1995 , lsnd was the first experiment to publish evidence for a signal at @xmath0 ev@xmath1 , observing @xmath2 @xcite .",

    "oscillations arise if neutrinos are produced , through weak decay , in a specific flavor eigenstate that is a combination of mass eigenstates .",
    "the mass eigenstates propagate with slightly different frequencies , leading to neutrino - flavor probability waves with oscillating beats among the flavors .    in a simple two - neutrino model , the flavor states , @xmath5 and @xmath6 ,",
    "are linked to the mass states , @xmath8 and @xmath9 , via a mixing matrix that is a simple rotation matrix . at @xmath18 ,",
    "the neutrinos are described by : @xmath19 where @xmath20 is called the `` mixing angle . ''",
    "the quantum mechanical interference of the mass eigenstates as they propagate leads to the appearance oscillation probability : @xmath21 where @xmath20 is the mixing angle , @xmath22 , in m , is the distance from production to detection , @xmath23 , in mev , is the energy of the neutrino , and @xmath24 , in ev@xmath1 , is the mass splitting .",
    "the disappearance probability is given by @xmath25    from the above , one sees that for lsnd and miniboone to be sensitive to @xmath0  ev@xmath1 , one chooses @xmath26 m / mev to maximize the oscillation probability . because typical beam energies range from a few mev to a few gev , this @xmath27 demands experiments that are relatively close to the site of neutrino production . as a result",

    "any single sbl experiment is likely to fit well within this simple two - neutrino model , producing either a signal or a limit at a given confidence level ( cl ) .",

    "this leads to a mixing matrix that connects the 3 + 1 flavors to four mass states : @xmath28 the mixing among the three active flavor states is highly constrained by measurements from daya bay @xcite , double chooz @xcite , kamland @xcite , minos @xcite , reno @xcite , super k @xcite , sno @xcite , and t2k @xcite . accommodating these data",

    "[ threeplusone ] that the lsnd and miniboone results fit poorly within a global 3 + 1 analysis .",

    "in addition to the three parameters from 3 + 1 , the 3 + 2 model introduces an extra mass splitting , @xmath38 , the mixing elements , @xmath39 and @xmath40 , and a complex phase , @xmath41 .",
    "the complex phase allows for significant @xmath17 violation , manifested as a difference between the neutrino and antineutrino appearance oscillation probabilities .",
    "however , because this is an interference effect , @xmath17 violation will only be significant if @xmath42 .",
    "@xmath17 violation will allow the signal for neutrino oscillations to be softer than for antineutrino oscillations , which we will show is preferred by the miniboone data in sec .",

    "the pgf for the @xmath158 versus @xmath178 data set comparison rises to 5.3% , which is acceptable .",
    "it is striking , however , that the pgf for the appearance versus disappearance data sets slightly worsens from the 3 + 1 case to 0.0082% .",
    "the source of the issue can be tracked to the miniboone low - energy excess .",
    "the fit to the @xmath158 and @xmath81 appearance signals alone are internally consistent , assuming a non - zero @xmath17 phase , but the best fit is strikingly different from the global fit .",
    "this can be seen clearly in fig .",

    "the solid lines show the expectations for the global best fit .",
    "the dashed lines show the best fits to only the appearance data sets .",
    "the dashed lines indicate a good representation of the data , while the global fit can not explain the rise in events at low energy .",

    "the normalization of lsnd is approximately 30% higher than the global fit , but the energy - dependent shape is well described .",
    "therefore , the poor pgf has been interpreted as indicating an issue with the miniboone data in the global fits .",

    ", width=552 ]    , width=552 ]    rather than indicating a problem with the miniboone data , however , this may instead be pointing to a limitation of the pgf description of compatibility .",

    "[ figure13 ] once again . after subtracting the 3 + 2 best fit prediction from the low - energy excess ,",
    "the residual excess for neutrinos and antineutrinos can be fit to an enhanced @xmath123 background model .",
    "a 20% increase of the @xmath123 background normalization gives a @xmath167 for the residual excess of 17.8/19 .",
    "the systematic error on the miniboone @xmath123 background is 14.5% ( 13.9% ) in neutrino ( antineutrino ) mode , and , therefore , this 20% discrepancy is only at the 1.4@xmath182 level .",
    "this is not a particularly large deviation , given the number of data sets in the global fit , and introduces concerns about the validity of the pgf compatibility statistic .",
    "this apparent discrepancy may indicate that the pgf has difficulty properly characterizing compatibility when systematic uncertainties can mimic a signal .",
    "the reason that the pgf is returning a poor compatibility can be seen from considering the numerator in eq .",
    "[ pgfapp ] .",
    "when appearance data are fit alone , a smaller @xmath77 is found when the entire miniboone low - energy excess is attributed to an oscillation signal than when the global fit parameters plus a 1.4@xmath182 fluctuation of background are evaluated .",
    "this combination yields a large value for @xmath183 , and hence a poor pgf , even though a compatible solution was available .",
    "this 3 + 2 model can be tested in the near future , as it makes specific predictions for the microboone experiment @xcite , which will begin running in late 2013 .",
    "the microboone experiment will use a liquid argon time projection chamber ( lartpc ) 60 ton fiducial - volume , which will be located on the bnb close to the miniboone detector .",
    "the lartpc can differentiate events which have a final state electron from those with a final state photon . unlike miniboone , with lartpc selection cuts",
    ", microboone will have very little contribution from photon - producing background sources , such as misidentified @xmath123 events .",
    "thus , microboone will definitively show whether the miniboone low - energy excess in neutrino mode is associated with electron neutrino events possibly from oscillations or events with photons from some other process .",
    "neutrino oscillations have been an unexpected and rich area for particle physics studies over the past several decades .",
    "the conclusive observations that neutrinos have mass and that lepton flavor is not conserved have changed the direction of the field .",
    "now , the indications from lsnd , miniboone , and other experiments that a new type of sterile neutrino might exist could have an equally important impact .",
    "both lsnd and miniboone see indications of electron neutrino / antineutrino appearance , but there are discrepancies in the energy distributions of the appearance signal that could or could not be related to oscillations .",
    "the analysis of all high @xmath149 data sets shows that models with several sterile neutrinos can give acceptable global fits .",
    "reported incompatibility with sterile neutrino models , especially between the appearance and disappearance measurements , may be arising from the choice of test statistic , rather than an underlying discrepancy with the data sets .",
    "investigations of high @xmath149 oscillations currently form one of the most active areas of neutrino physics and many new experiments are being mounted or considered .",
    "this future program builds on the initial measurements of lsnd and miniboone discussed here and aims to provide a definitive exploration of new physics signals in the neutrino sector , such as sterile neutrinos .",
