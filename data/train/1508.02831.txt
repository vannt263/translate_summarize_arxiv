    "quantum annealing  [ 1 - 10 ] is a useful way to estimate the ground state of a system . here and after we denote the target hamiltonian as @xmath0 . in the famous quantum annealing schemes  [ 1 - 10 ] , the time dependent hamiltonian @xmath1 is introduced as @xmath2 using the initial system @xmath3 . here",
    "the characteristic time scale @xmath4 is assumed to be long enough for the schrdinger equation @xmath5 to be regarded to describe the adiabatic process , namely @xmath6 where the eigenvalue",
    "@xmath7 corresponds to the energy of the total system ( [ eq1 - 1 ] ) . starting from such an initial condition as the ground state @xmath8 of the initial system @xmath3",
    ", we can obtain the ground state of the system @xmath0 at @xmath9 .",
    "this is a simple outline of quantum annealing .",
    "quantum annealing is often applied to estimate a ground state  [ 10 - 16 ] in such complex systems as spin - glasses , and these studies are applied to non - deterministic polynomial ( np ) problems such as the traveling salesman problem  [ 11 - 14 ] . on the other hand , recently , information technology becomes more important and attention is paid to the statistical physics of information  [ 17 - 19 ] . especially , the scheme to treat the big data from aspects of statistical physics will develop in the near future .",
    "actually , for example , kurihara _ et al .",
    "_ studied network clustering using quantum annealing  @xcite .",
    "thus , it may be important to analyze directly the big data from those kinds of viewpoints .    in the case of data analysis ,",
    "the principal component analysis is often used to find the trends shown in big data .",
    "furthermore , the principal component analysis is equivalent to the singular value decomposition .",
    "once we can perform the singular value decomposition using quantum annealing and clarify its mechanism , quantum annealing provides an efficient way of data analysis .",
    "additionally , from the viewpoint of applications for fundamental problems of quantum physics , the singular value decomposition gives a useful way to study quantum states .",
    "for example , to find the entanglement between subsystems @xmath10 and @xmath11 of the total hamiltonian @xmath12 , we have to obtain a reduced density matrix . to obtain the reduced density matrix , schmidt decomposition and singular value decomposition",
    "are used . in other cases , to perform the density matrix renormalization group ( dmrg ) method , the singular value decomposition is necessary .",
    "thus , it is also useful to show a possible way to perform the singular value decomposition .    in the present study ,",
    "we show how to perform the singular value decomposition using quantum annealing and we investigate the mechanism . in the next section ,",
    "we make a brief introduction of the singular value decomposition from the viewpoint of an application of quantum annealing . in sec .",
    "[ sec3 ] , we introduce the key idea to perform the singular value decomposition by quantum annealing , and demonstrate it explicitly by some information matrices .",
    "we analyze the mechanism of the present way by using approximated eigenvalue distributions and a series expansion , in secs .",
    "[ sec4 ] and [ sec5 ] , respectively .",
    "summary and discussions are included in sec .",
    "in this section , we make a brief introduction of the singular value decomposition .",
    "we consider an @xmath13 matrix @xmath14 for natural numbers @xmath15 and @xmath16 .",
    "the matrix @xmath17 is defined as @xmath18 which is an @xmath19 hermitian matrix .",
    "the eigenvectors @xmath20 ( @xmath21 ) and the eigenvalues @xmath22 of the matrix @xmath17 satisfy the equation @xmath23 here the eigenvalues @xmath22 are real because @xmath17 is hermitian .",
    "in addition , using the inequality @xmath24 it is easily found that the eigenvalue @xmath25 is positive .",
    "if we define the vector @xmath26 as @xmath27 the vector @xmath28 is derived as @xmath29 thus , the vector @xmath26 is an eigenvector of the matrix @xmath30 with the eigenvalue @xmath25 including @xmath15 components .    using the vectors @xmath31 , @xmath32 and the eigenvalues @xmath22 ,",
    "the matrix @xmath14 is decomposed as @xmath33 this decomposition is so called `` singular value decomposition '' , and the weights @xmath34 are called `` singular values '' . to use the singular value decomposition for data analysis ,",
    "the component with larger singular values are more important .",
    "thus , we put the eigenvalues @xmath22 in order as @xmath35 . in this case , @xmath36 is called `` first principal component '' , @xmath37 is called `` second principal component '' , and so on . this is nothing but the principal component analysis  @xcite . in many cases ,",
    "even though it is not necessary , the data matrix @xmath38 is often normalized so as to satisfy the relations @xmath39 and @xmath40 when the data matrix @xmath14 is normalized , the matrix @xmath41 corresponds to the variance - covariance matrix .",
    "then , the principal component analysis corresponds to the eigenvalue analysis of the variance - covariance matrices .    as shown in eq.([eq2 - 5 ] ) , the singular value decomposition and the principal component analysis require the eigenstate with larger eigenvalues , because the larger singular values strongly contribute to the original data matrix @xmath14 with the weights @xmath42 .",

    "finally , if quantum annealing works well , we can expect that the first - principal component @xmath59 is obtained as @xmath60 at the time @xmath9 .    in this section , on the basis of the above assumption , we demonstrate two examples , namely , a small data matrix and an image data matrix .",
