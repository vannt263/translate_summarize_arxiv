    "the yukawa couplings of the standard model ( sm ) are not random @xmath0 numbers .",
    "this could be called a failure of the effective field theory approach , or equivalently , evidence for new physics above the weak scale .",
    "our philosophy is that the mere smallness of the yukawas is not as important as their nontrivial structure . even on a log scale",
    "they do not appear to be randomly distributed , as they are all @xmath3 .",
    "further , they are evenly spaced . within each type of fermion ( up - type quarks , down - type quarks , or charged leptons ) the masses of successive generations",
    "are always split by about two orders of magnitude .",
    "finally , the down - type quark and lepton masses of each generation are similar , and different from the up - type quark masses , suggesting a grand unified theory ( gut ) .",
    "while it is possible that such patterns happen to result from an underlying theory that acts in an independent or random way on each fermion , we will follow the philosophy that these patterns are the result of a single , unified structure acting in a universal , flavor - blind way on all the quarks and leptons .",
    "several other general approaches to flavor have been proposed .",
    "froggatt - nielsen type models have perhaps the most similarity with our mechanism but usually require careful choices of new charges for the different sm quarks and leptons as well as many new fields in order to accommodate the observed hierarchical structure @xcite . models with family or horizontal flavor symmetries",
    "can also generate the yukawa couplings but with complicated new degrees of freedom , symmetries , flavor breaking mechanisms , and arranged choices of charges for the different fermions @xcite .",
    "models without imposed flavor symmetries still frequently have new structures @xcite .",
    "extra - dimensions have also been invoked to explain the smallness of the yukawa couplings @xcite .",
    "these often involve choosing different positions to localize the different quark and lepton fields of each generation .",
    "models exploiting exponentially suppressed wavefunction overlaps can generically produce much smaller yukawa couplings than observed ( in fact even yukawas of the size necessary for dirac neutrinos @xcite ) , and can produce any pattern of masses distributed randomly on a logarthmic scale .",
    "these frameworks can explain why the yukawa couplings are small numbers , but do not as directly explain the observed hierarchical pattern since they could just as easily accommodate any other pattern of small numbers .",
    "such models are less constrained and thus , in that sense , less predictive than our model .",
    "we will generate the flavor structure of the sm from a theory that treats all generations identically .",
    "we work in a unified theory and add one new symmetry to forbid the yukawas , in its simplest form just a global u(1 ) or discrete group , with simple charge assignments that do not distinguish between generations ( e.g. see table [ tab : charges ] ) .",
    "we also add one new singlet and one new vector - like pair of fields and write down all allowed operators with @xmath0 coefficients .",
    "this generates just two couplings with flavor indices , i.e.  two directions in ` flavor - space ' .",
    "when the symmetry is spontaneously broken , all the yukawa couplings are generated radiatively .",
    "but , because of the simple structure of the two allowed flavor directions , the masses of successive generations arise at successive orders .",
    "this gives rise to the observed hierarchical pattern of fermion masses and mixings without the need for making different choices ( such as of charge or extra - dimensional localization ) for the different fermions .",
    "radiative models of flavor have a long history @xcite .",
    "several of the models have some similarities to the flavor structure of our model @xcite , and especially @xcite , including some with supersymmetry ( susy ) @xcite or in a gut @xcite .",
    "many of these models only generate some but not all of the yukawa couplings or require complicated new sectors .",
    "additionally , many low scale flavor models are now in conflict with experimental flavor constraints .",
    "our goal is to explain the hierarchical pattern of fermion masses and mixing angles , as opposed to merely accommodating the observed smallness of the yukawa couplings . in this section",
    "we give the basic idea behind our models .",
    "although we generate the yukawas from radiative corrections , the mechanism responsible for the pattern of hierarchies is more general and may well find application in other models .      to simplify the discussion",
    ", we consider here just the couplings in our theory which carry flavor information .",
    "these ` flavorful ' parts of the superpotential are @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the ith generation of @xmath6 , @xmath7 the light higgs whose",
    "vev breaks electroweak symmetry , @xmath8 the top yukawa and @xmath9 is a random matrix with @xmath10 entries .",
    "currently , @xmath11 is a new field that does not get a vev , though we will see in section [ model5 ] that it can just be the down - type higgs , @xmath12 .    the top yukawa term ( the first term in eqns . ) might appear to violate our philosophy since it appears to require a specific choice of direction in flavor space .",
    "however , we can rewrite it in a more suggestive , basis - independent way as @xmath13 where @xmath14 is a random vector with @xmath0 entries . of course we can always choose a basis in which @xmath15 points entirely in the 3 direction ( i.e. only @xmath16 is nonzero ) which then gives eqn . .",
    "the form of the superpotential in eqn . indicates how this term can be generated in a flavor - blind manner .",
    "we will simply allow a term in the underlying model which has the arbitrary vector @xmath15 in ` 10-flavor space ' . since @xmath15 is only a single vector in ` 10-space ' , it can only generate a yukawa coupling in one direction in @xmath17 space , as seen in eqn . .",
    "by choice of basis , we can call this the @xmath18 direction , or equivalently the top yukawa coupling .",
    "this gives only the top quark an @xmath0 yukawa coupling and hence a mass around the higgs vev . at this order ,",
    "all other fermions are massless .",
    "the details of such a model will be given in section [ topyukawa ] .",
    "note that the superpotential in eqn .",
    "breaks all the flavor symmetries @xmath19 .",
    "the top yukawa breaks @xmath20 , and the @xmath9 term breaks the rest of the symmetries . since the top quark is connected to the higgs vev and all the flavor symmetries are broken , we expect all the yukawa couplings to be generated by radiative corrections . of course , the main point of the model is to generate the hierarchical pattern of masses and mixings so we must avoid generating all the remaining yukawa couplings at the same order .",
    "naively this might seem to be a problem in the simple model of eqn .",
    "since all the flavor symmetries are broken at the same level by arbitrary , flavor - blind couplings .",
    "however , we can see from a simple spurion - type analysis that the yukawa couplings are generated in the observed hierarchical pattern .",
    "there are only two couplings in the model that carry flavor information , @xmath15 and @xmath9 , so all the yukawa couplings must be made out of these .",
    "since @xmath15 only gives the top quark , to generate other yukawas we must use @xmath9 s . taking the combination @xmath21 produces a vector in @xmath22-flavor space , which will be the bottom and tau direction . note that at this order , only one direction in @xmath22 space , i.e. one generation of downs and leptons , has been given a yukawa coupling .",
    "so all the downs and leptons besides the @xmath23 , @xmath1 have not yet gotten a mass . at the next order ,",
    "@xmath24 is the charm direction .",
    "again note that at this order we have only generated one more mass , and so we still have not generated a mass for the up - quark .",
    "thus the up sector yukawa couplings , @xmath25 , are generated at successive orders : @xmath26 where we have parametrized each insertion of @xmath27 with a factor of @xmath28 . in the specific models we present in the next sections we will calculate @xmath28 precisely .",
    "it will arise because each insertion of @xmath9 is a vertex with a @xmath11 field coming out , as in eqn . .",
    "these @xmath11 s must then be contracted with each other , making each insertion of @xmath27 a loop factor .",
    "the down quark yukawas , @xmath29 , are similarly generated in a hierarchical pattern , and the masses are generally smaller than in the up sector : @xmath30 where @xmath31 stands for the cost of inserting a single @xmath32 which we will calculate in our specific models .",
    "the mixing angles in the ckm matrix will come from a combination of the off - diagonal terms in the up and down yukawa matrices .",
    "we will calculate these in detail later , but we can already see that these mixings are at roughly the square root of the mass ratios . for example , the top - charm mixing arises at order @xmath28 while top - charm or bottom - strange mass ratio is at order @xmath33 .",
    "this is a famously noticed phenomenological relation .",
    "we follow the standard effective field theory philosophy that any allowed coupling should be present at @xmath0 .",
    "then , we simply allow two terms in the lagrangian which carry flavor information , an arbitrary vector in ` 10-space ' and an arbitrary matrix in ` @xmath34 space ' .",
    "these two flavor - symmetry breaking spurions then generate all the fermion masses and mixing angles in a hierarchical pattern as seen in eqns .   and and in fig .",
    "[ fig : dominopattern ] .",
    "the hierarchies between generations arise even though the original theory did not distinguish between any of the generations .",
    "all of the original couplings are ` flavor - blind ' in that all three generations are treated identically .",
    "they are not , for example , given different charges under a flavor symmetry , or located at different points in an extra - dimension .",
    "it is just the structure of these two allowed couplings that causes the three generations to get such hierarchically split masses .",
    "in fact , this mechanism is general and could possibly be implemented in a framework other than radiative generation .",

    "in this section , we construct simple models that embody the spirit of the gut inspired domino mechanism . for concreteness , we work in the context of @xmath36 guts using the superpotential ( [ eqn : flavor superpot ] ) .",
    "in ( [ eqn : flavor superpot ] ) , gauge invariance requires @xmath11 to be either a @xmath22 or a @xmath37 .",
    "while the general mechanism for generating flavor is similar for both representations , there are representation dependent details that arise in specific models .",
    "accordingly , we discuss two models , classified by the representation of @xmath11 . the models are consistent with the general philosophy of the paper wherein we allow all terms allowed by symmetry , with @xmath10 coupling constants and democratic treatment of all the generations .",
    "we first discuss the case where @xmath11 is a @xmath22 in section [ model5 ] , where we discuss the complete flavor generation mechanism including the quark and lepton mass matrices , the ckm matrix and gut breaking effects . in section [ model45 ]",

    "these interactions must therefore play an essential role in generating the flavor hierarchies .",
    "constraints from proton decay experiments @xcite require these triplet fields to have masses @xmath54 .    quark and lepton masses arise from superpotential terms and are protected by susy non - renormalization theorems .",
    "any radiative mechanism that generates these terms must therefore be proportional to the scale @xmath55 of susy breaking .",
    "the necessity of the triplet higgs fields and susy breaking in this mechanism implies that the radiative masses generated will all be proportional to @xmath56 .",
    "these radiative corrections can make significant contributions to the quark and lepton mass matrices only if @xmath57 .",
    "consequently , we will assume that supersymmetry is broken at the gut scale and that the weak scale is stabilized by fine tuning _",

    "as an example , we will consider the case that @xmath11 is a @xmath312 ( i.e. it is the down - type higgs , @xmath12 ) in detail . in this case",

    "the proton decay predictions in this case are similar to the previous case though the order 1 numbers multiplying the various contributions may be different .    the @xmath314 scalar gives rise to the dimension 6 proton decay operator in the kahler potential @xmath319 .",
    "the normal dimension 5 proton decay operators of the mssm are suppressed by the large masses of the squarks and sleptons . the dimension",
    "6 proton decay operators mediated by x , y gauge bosons are present , but the @xmath314 is likely to give the dominant contribution to the proton decay rate since the rate scales as the fourth power of the mediating particle s mass and the gauge contribution is suppressed by gauge couplings .",
    "the consequences of x , y mediated proton decay are not as specific to this model ( e.g. @xcite ) and would not give as direct a window into the flavor structure so we will not discuss them further and instead assume the proton decay rate is dominated by @xmath314 exchange .    in this case , the predicted proton branching ratios are interestingly different from the predictions of other theories @xcite .",
    "because @xmath9 in eqn . is an arbitrary matrix with @xmath0 entries , the decay rates are roughly equal into all the different possible two - body final states .",
    "notice that this includes the unusual decay modes @xmath320 and @xmath321 .",

    "note that there are different @xmath0 numbers in front of each of these terms coming from combinatoric factors whose measurement would help confirm the underlying model giving rise to the decay .",
    "of course , in practice it is impossible to distinguish the different flavors of neutrino coming from proton decay so the rates for @xmath324 and @xmath325 must be added . not only does the presence of many decay modes enhance the observability of the signal",

    "besides the usual split susy spectrum and the axion , the only other particle we predict at low energies is the axino , @xmath337 , the fermionic superpartner of the axion . in the absence of susy breaking",

    "the imaginary part of the scalar component of @xmath340 contains the axion @xmath330 , and the fermionic component of @xmath340 contains the axino . in order to allow the normal kinetic terms ,",
    "@xmath341 must have r - charge + 1 under the r - symmetry which keeps the gauginos and higgsinos light ( at the tev scale ) in split susy .",
    "therefore @xmath340 has r - charge 0 and so the axino mass , which is the f - term of @xmath342 , is forbidden by the r - symmetry .",
    "this r - symmetry is only broken at the tev scale to give the gauginos and higgsinos their masses , therefore the axino mass is controlled by the tev scale and not the gut scale .",
    "thus it is reasonable to expect the axino to be much lighter than the tev scale , as in normal supersymmetric models @xcite .    such axions with @xmath336 and mass @xmath343",
    "ev could make up the dark matter of the universe .",
    "in fact the initial displacement angle has to be tuned to avoid producing too much dark matter .",
    "they are difficult , though perhaps not impossible @xcite , to detect since all couplings to sm particles , @xmath344 , and @xmath345 are suppressed by the scale @xmath346 .",
    "the axino could also be a component of the dark matter , though since its couplings are similar to the axion s , it may also be difficult to detect directly @xcite .      in our scenario",
    "the axino can easily be the true lightest supersymmetric partner ( lsp ) . in this case",
    ", all other superpartners will decay to it through the dimension 5 operators in equation .",
    "in particular the next to lightest supersymmetric partner ( nlsp ) , usually the lightest neutralino , which would otherwise have been a stable dark matter particle , will decay to the axino .",

    "additionally , split susy generally has a long - lived gluino which can be cosmologically stable @xcite .",
    "when the squark and slepton masses are around @xmath347 gev as in our scenario , the gluino has a lifetime around the age of the universe .",
    "such long - lived colored particles are constrained by cosmic ray measurements as well as searches for anomalously heavy elements and strongly interacting dark matter and generically rule out any susy breaking scale ( squark and slepton mass scale ) higher than @xmath348 @xcite . however , in our model this is not a problem because the gluino decays through the dimension 5 operator of equation to the axino .",
    "this solution of the long - lived gluino problem in split susy applies whenever a qcd axion is added to the theory .",
    "the lifetime for the decay of the gluino to the axino through the operators in equation is @xmath349 where @xmath350 is the mass of the gluino . since @xmath351",

    "the relic gluino abundance is uncertain by several orders of magnitude due to nonperturbative effects and thus could easily avoid bbn constraints .",
    "interestingly , these lifetimes for the gluino and the nlsp are in the right range to explain the cosmological lithium problems . the measured primordial abundances of @xmath352 and @xmath353 are significantly different from the predictions of standard bbn and in opposite directions from each other . both of these problems can be solved simultaneously by a long - lived particle decaying with a lifetime of @xmath354 s and with roughly the abundance and hadronic branching ratio of either the gluino or the nlsp .",
    "thus the presence of the axino in our model not only solves the long - lived gluino problem of split susy but may also naturally solve the cosmological lithium problems .",
    "such late - decays are discussed in more detail in @xcite .",
    "importantly , the long - lived gluino could potentially be discovered at the lhc with a reach above 1 tev through monojets , dijets , and charged tracks @xcite .",
    "although the nlsp will fly straight out of the lhc s detectors ( assuming it is the lightest neutralino ) , some fraction of gluinos that are produced at the lhc will stop in the detectors .",
    "their out - of - time decays could give a dramatic signature of such a scenario and also a measurement of the gluino mass and lifetime @xcite .",
    "in our case the gluino dominantly decays two - body to a jet plus missing energy , which could distinguish this scenario from more standard split susy decays in which the gluino decays to two jets plus missing energy with a significant branching fraction .",
    "in fact such a search has already been performed at the tevatron @xcite .",
    "not only would this signal provide a unique confirmation of the particle physics solution of the cosmological lithium problems , the measurement of the mass and lifetime would provide a measure of the axion decay constant @xmath346 and hence powerful evidence for a new scale in nature near the gut scale .      our model has a sharp prediction for the higgs mass . in split susy with the susy breaking scale near the gut scale , the higgs mass is tightly constrained and essentially independent of the actual value of the scalar masses @xcite .",

    "the value of @xmath35 can be lower so the higgs mass can range down to roughly 140 gev .",

    "even the hypothesized existence of a gigantic landscape of vacua could not explain the structure of the yukawas ( at the very least of the heavier two generations ) .",
    "although many models of flavor exist , our model differs significantly from these in its structure , implications for flavor , and testable predictions .",
    "froggatt - nielsen and many extra - dimensional models require different , ad hoc choices of charge or position for each different fermion in order to reproduce the observed structure in the yukawa couplings .",

    "note that we have generated the yukawa couplings of the downs and leptons as @xmath356 instead of with @xmath12 .",
    "we have presented two models that illustrate this mechanism , the model of section [ model5 ] ( summarized in equations and ) , and the model of section [ model45 ] ( summarized in equations and ) .",
    "our models naturally preserve unification .",
    "they are embedded in split susy where both the susy breaking scale and the scale of flavor ( the breaking scale of our new symmetry ) are at the gut scale , which is the only scale in the model besides the weak scale .",
    "our mechanism gives novel su(5 ) breaking relations in the yukawa couplings .",
    "for example , in our minimal model the @xmath1 to b mass ratio is predicted to be @xmath357 instead of 1 , resolving the tension in many susy models .",
    "it arises as the ratio of the number of colors that run inside the loop in figure [ fig - tripletbtau ] , which is the number of colors the fermion does not have ( 3 for the @xmath1 and 2 for the b ) .",
    "a ratio larger than 1 is easily produced in our second model as well . in both models the @xmath358 to s",
    "mass ratio also receives su(5 ) breaking contributions which can easily split the masses by an @xmath0 factor .",
    "such mass ratios arise from the su(5 ) breaking in the masses of the gut scale particles which are running in the loops that generate the yukawas .",
    "this is an interesting illustration that the common problems of su(5 ) yukawa unification in guts may not indicate a problem with the supersymmetric framework but may instead arise naturally from a specific model of flavor .",
    "current experimental flavor constraints indicate that the yukawas may not be generated near the weak scale .",
    "although the sm flavor structure could be generated at any new intermediate scale , the gut scale is already a well motivated scale and so seems a likely place for flavor to be generated .",
    "this case seems pessimistic since high - scale flavor models are often difficult to test experimentally .",
    "remarkably though , our models have several potentially testable predictions .",
    "importantly , these models give novel proton decay predictions which may well be observable at the next generation of proton decay experiments .",
    "measurements of the various proton decay modes and branching ratios would be a direct probe of the couplings that generate the flavor structure of the standard model . our mechanism for explaining flavor",
    "also necessarily solves the strong cp problem by producing an axion .",
    "the yukawas are explained by forbidding them with a symmetry and generating them when that symmetry is broken .",
    "that symmetry has a mixed anomaly with qcd and therefore gives rise to an invisible axion when it is broken at the gut scale .",
    "additionally it necessarily implies an axino which can easily be the lightest superpartner .",
    "thus all superpartners , including the long - lived gluino of split susy will decay to the axino , resolving the problems with high scale split susy .",
    "such decays can have observable effects on the light element abundances produced during bbn and may even explain the lithium problems .",
    "further , if the gluino is produced at the lhc , it can stop and decay out of time in the detectors , giving a dramatic signature of such a scenario and further evidence for the gut scale .",
    "finally the higgs mass is predicted to lie within a range from around 140 gev to 154 gev , which should be tested soon .",
    "although our specific models rely on radiative generation of the yukawa couplings , the basic mechanism may be more generally applicable .",
    "the hierarchies between the different generations arise just from the simple flavor structure of our two flavor symmetry breaking couplings , the vector and the matrix .",
    "the pattern in the yukawas is generated from the necessity of using these spurions repeatedly until all flavor directions are generated , as in eqns .   and .",
    "so long as each use of a spurion introduces a small factor in the coupling , the general hierarchical pattern will be reproduced .",
    "our radiative model allows this spurionic factor to be rigorously computed and the numerical values work well .",
    "but there may be other implementations of this same idea that also give interesting results .",
    "the simplicity of the two spurions may lead , for example , to novel ways to embed the flavor structure of the standard model in string constructions .",
