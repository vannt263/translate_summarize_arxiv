    "the idea of doing jet tomography in ultrarelativistic heavy - ion ( a - a ) collisions , i.e. to utilize hard processes taking place along the creation of a soft bulk medium to probe both the geometry and the degrees of freedom of the medium has been proposed many years ago @xcite . at the brookhaven relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) ,",
    "the observables considered to probe this physics was initially the nuclear suppression factor of single inclusive hadrons @xmath1 @xcite and the suppression factor @xmath2 of hard back - to - back dihadron correlations @xcite .",
    "recent high statistics runs at rhic as well as the significantly larger kinematic reach of heavy - ion experiments at the cern large hadron collider ( lhc ) have led to a large variety of new high @xmath0 observables , in particular also observables involving jet reconstruction using several different jet definitions , among them dijet imbalance measurements @xcite , jet - hadron ( jet - h ) correlations @xcite , h - jet correlations @xcite , jet fragmentation function @xcite and jet shapes @xcite or observales utilizing rare electroweak triggers such as @xmath3-h correlations @xcite or @xmath3-jet correlations @xcite .    to add to the complexity",
    ", jet definitions vary from calorimetric jets in which no unfolding of background fluctuations is done as used e.g. in @xcite to combined track / tower jets with @xmath0 cuts imposed on constituents and a hard tower trigger condition imposed as used e.g. in @xcite .",
    "in this situation , it is fairly difficult to assemble a picture of what information the various observables actually carry , to what degree they are mutually consistent and what features of models they constrain .",
    "the aim of this paper is to improve on this situation by providing a clear conceptual framework in which similarities and differences between the various observables become transparent .",
    "the key observation for this is that the vast majority of observables ( with the exception of nuclear modification factors ) are measurements of a conditional probability given a trigger condition .",
    "the fundamental reason for this is that both hard and electroweak processes are rare , i.e. if there would be no selection of the subclass of events containing hard processes , the background of soft bulk medium physics would dilute all signatures of hard probes to the point where they would no longer be observable .",
    "however , conditional probabilities are well known to be frequently non - intuitive , and the natural starting point for analyzing them is bayes formula , which will be utilized in the following .",
    "in perturbative quantum chromodynamics ( pqcd ) , the rate of hard scattering processes can be computed with reasonable accuracy once the momentum transfer in the scattering process exceeds a few gev . the uncertainty principle allows to estimate the timescale for the hard reaction as @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the energy scale of the final state partons and @xmath6 the virtuality scale . inserting typical numbers",
    ", one finds that hard processes occur before a soft medium can be formed , which is the reason that the pqcd computation of hard processes can safely be assumed to factorize from any medium physics .",
    "this property makes high @xmath0 observables a meaningful tomographic probe .",
    "the highly virtual back - to - back partons subsequently undergo a final state shower evolution in which the virtuality scale decreases from its initial high value to a non - perturbative scale via the branching into additional partons .",
    "this process in vacuum is well described by mc formulations such as the pyshow algorithm of pythia @xcite .",
    "once at the non - perturbative scale , the parton shower hadronizes and becomes a collimated spray of hadrons .",
    "jet clustering algorithms such as anti-@xmath7 or sis - cone as provided e.g. by the fastjet package @xcite aim to undo the qcd shower evolution and turn the spray of hadrons again into a jet , i.e. an object which is a reasonable proxy for the original parton largely free of the complications of shower evolution and hadronization and sensitive to hard physics only .",
    "measurements of hard probes in the context of heavy ion collisions aim at answering the question how the medium modifies this evolution , i.e. in what way the properties of the shower are different if it evolves inside a medium .",
    "if a jet contains @xmath8 hadrons , since the position space information can not be resolved , the complete theoretically measurable information about the jet is contained in the momentum space density @xmath9 and in the knowledge of hadron identities .",
    "however , currently the focus is on measurements of the single particle distribution @xmath10 , usually represented as parallel and perpendicular momentum spectra of particles with respect to the jet axis . in the future measurements",
    "may also include intra - jet correlations .",
    "these would be given e.g. by two particle correlation @xmath11 and three particle correlations @xmath12 or expressed in terms of subjet fractions .",
    "this information may be represented in different form , for instance the integrated jet shape @xmath13    ( the integrated flux of energy as a function of angle @xmath14 with the jet axis of a jet of radius @xmath15 , normalized to the total jet energy ) is computable from the angular distribution of hadrons at given energy @xmath16 ( as for instance obtained from a correlation measurement ) as@xmath17    it is thus theoretically sufficient to measure one representation of the single particle distribution , different representations contain redundant information .",
    "however , in practice a jet shape is always conditional on having found a jet in an event , whereas the angular distribution of hadrons obtained from a triggered correlation measurement is conditional on a different trigger condition , and hence the two representations will in practice not conntain precisely the same information .",
    "moreover , no real measurement can resolve the true particle composition of every jet .",
    "if we use the notation that @xmath18 stands for the probability of event @xmath19 occurring given another event @xmath20 , the computation of the probability of observing shower properties @xmath21 ( for instance the probability of measuring a shower hadron between 2 and 3 gev ) given a set of trigger conditions @xmath22 ( for example given that a jet is clustered in an energy between 100 and 150 gev ) is written as @xmath23 where @xmath24 stands for the particular model in which the calculation is carried out .",
    "bayes formula then allows to compute this as    @xmath25    in words , the probability for observing shower properties @xmath21 given a trigger @xmath22 is the product of the probability to fulfill the trigger condition in a shower with property @xmath21 times the probability to generate a shower @xmath21 , divided by the probability to generate a trigger _ independent _ if property @xmath21 is realized or not .",
    "since a rate is obtained by multiplying a probability with a repetition frequency , the whole language trivially generalizes to event rates or particle spectra .",
    "what is measured is usually the left hand side of the equation , somtimes also the denominator of the right hand side ( which corresponds to the rate at which the trigger condition is fulfilled ) .",
    "( [ e-1 ] ) states then that in a large class of measurements , the medium modification as computable in a model @xmath26 is not be observed directly , but rather is distorted through a _ bias factor _",
    "@xmath27 which is characterized by the trigger condition @xmath22 .",
    "this bias can vary a lot , for instance the requirement to find a 100 gev calorimetric jet leads to a very different bias than the requirement to find a 20 gev charged hadron .",
    "however as these examples indicate , the formalism applies as well to jet finding followed by an analysis of the fragmentation pattern of the clustered jet @xcite ( in which case the jet finding constitutes the trigger condition and the observable is the momentum spectrum of the shower parallel to the jet axis ) as to @xmath2 in triggered h - h correlations ( in which the requirement to find a hard hadron constitutes the trigger condition and the ratio of parallel momentum spectra of correlated hadrons in medium over vacuum is the observable ) .",
    "this suggests a clear strategy to make the information content of measurements apparent and comparable : measure the observable ( e.g. the single particle distribution of jet constituents ) in the same representation in all measurements and view the different trigger condition as a variation of the bias factor .",
    "tomographic information is then contained in the way the observable responds to a change of the bias factor .      as discussed in detail in @xcite , modelling of the medium modification of a shower",
    "involves a procedure to compute the medium - modified fragmentation function ( mmff ) .",
    "the mmff can be written in the rather general form @xmath28 , where it describes the distribution of hadrons @xmath29 given a parton @xmath30 with initial energy @xmath5 and initial virtuality @xmath31 where the hadron energy @xmath32 and the parton has traversed a medium along the path @xmath33 where @xmath34 are the medium transport coefficients relevant for the process .",
    "since the mmff should approach the usual vacuum fragmentation function when the transport coefficients vanish , the properties of a vacuum shower are largely determined by just three parameters  the shower - initiating parton type @xmath30 , its initial energy @xmath5 and virtuality @xmath35 .",
    "in contrast , the determination of medium modifications in principles require @xmath8 different functions @xmath34 . however , it turns out that in practice three are most relevant : @xmath36 ( the medium - induced perpendicular momentum squared per unit pathlength , effectively corresponding to a medium - induced virtuality ) , @xmath37 ( the mean momentum transfer parallel to the parton direction into the medium per unit pathlength , effectively corresponding to parton energy loss ) and @xmath38 ( the variance of the energy loss ) @xcite .",
    "moreover , in many models it turns out that the full functional dependence of the transport coefficient is not needed but rather the line integral along the parton path @xmath39 as @xmath40 and the line integral along the path with a weight given by the pathlength @xmath33 , i.e. @xmath41 are to good accuracy sufficient @xcite .",
    "this implies that the medium modification of a shower can be characterized reasonably well by the set of @xmath42 which now contain all tomographic information .",
    "thus , ideally one would like to compare @xmath43 with a measurement to deduce the tomographic information on the properties of the medium .",
    "photon - triggered correlation come in practice closest to this ideal as they can provide stringent constraints on @xmath5 , but they leave @xmath31 and the location of the initial vertex and hence the set @xmath44 unconstrained .",
    "a number of models for the computation of the mmff are proposed .",
    "historically , the computation has often been based on the leading parton energy loss approximation in which the virtuality evolution of the shower is not treated explicitly and the focus is only on induced radiation from the leading parton @xcite . since",
    "this approximation is not well suited for the interpretation in terms of conditional probabilities , we will not consider it here .",
    "alternatively , monte - carlo ( mc ) codes for in - medium shower evolution @xcite , parton cascade @xcite as well as analytical approaches @xcite exist .      in order to directly test a model of jet quenching",
    ", it would be desirable if an observable could be constructed in such a way that the vacuum shower model parameters @xmath45 or the medium parameter moments take fixed values . in this case",
    ", the theoretical model would only ever need to consider events which fulfill the trigger condition by construction , rendering the bias factor @xmath27 identically unity , which simplifies the computation tremendously .",
    "this is the reason schematic investigations and toy models follow this strategy . in other words ,",
    "if one could prepare a situation in which a quark with specified energy propagates through a given length of medium with given density , jet tomography through comparison of experiment and theory would be easy to do .",
    "unfortunately , experimental measurements are hardly ever conditioning on initial state properties of the shower , in which case the bias factor is different from unity and a model to compute the mmff is insufficient to compare with data . instead",
    ", experimental trigger conditions usually key on some property of the observed final state after shower evolution and hadronization .",
    "consider the term @xmath46 which can be written as @xmath47 using the fact that probabilities normalize to unity .",
    "( [ e-2 ] ) states that in order to compute the rate at which the trigger condition is fulfilled , we need not only compute the shower @xmath21 exhibiting a particular property we are interested in but in fact all possible shower configurations and medium modifications @xmath48 which are allowed by the physics of the collision and do an appropriate sum over them .",
    "it is this need to compute all possible initial configurations and check them for the trigger condition in the final state which makes a proper computation vastly more complicated than a toy model estimate .    in practical terms",
    ", this means that in order to compute observables which can be compared with experiment , an in - medium shower model needs to be embedded into a framework simulating the hard process and the evolution of the surrounding medium ( for a detailed discussion see @xcite ) .",
    "the final state trigger condition than maps ( in a model- and embedding - dependent way ) into distributions in the space of initial shower parameters .",
    "let us for illustration consider a mc description of jet quenching .",
    "biases are taken into account by generating events according to the full abailable space of initial parameters with correct weight assigned to the individual contributions , then searching which of these events fulfill the trigger condition in the final state and analyzing only this subset of event to obtain the observable .",
    "pictorially this is shown in fig .",
    "[ f - mc ] .",
    "ultimately interesting for the observable are only the two shaded regions , i.e. the class of events which fulfills the trigger t and the class of events which fulfills t and shows property s.    however , the computational problem is that the full range of events generated by sampling all the available initial parameter space is usually so huge that a naive application of the above strategy is bound to be so slow that it is useless in practice .",
    "the challenge resulting from this is to introduce an intemediate layer , i.e. to understand the bias structure in such a way that only initial parameter ranges are sampled which have a reasonable chance to lead to a trigger in the final state .",
    "pictorially , this corresponds to drawing the dashed line as closely as possible to the intersecting circles without actually cutting parameter space out of a circle ( which would introduce an unphysical sampling bias ) . in this way",
    ", computations become feasible .",
    "this illustrates that good knowledge of the mapping of final state conditions to initial state parameters in terms of biases is not only conceptually important , but also has consequences of immediate practical value .",
    "following the discussion in @xcite , we can classify the various biases induced by a trigger condition on the final state of a hard event as follows : first , there are biases on the structure of the hard pqcd event itself which act even in vacuum . these have to do with the relation between hadronic ( or jet ) and parton kinematics dependent on parton type . once a medium is present , the correlation of the strength of the medium modification with the density of the medium and the time spent in the medium leads to additional biases on the reaction geometry . since all these biases act on the hard event itself rather than the final state shower , they affect both trigger side and away side simultaneously",
    ". this can be contrasted with shower biases , which affect the structure of the shower evolution itself and do not bias the kinematics or position of the hard event and are thus always only relevant for the trigger side .    in this section ,",
    "we review qualitatively the effects of the most relevant biases , which we study later with case studies in a full modelling framework . in order to illustrate the isolated effects of the various biases , the examples shown outside the full case studies are theoretical situations in which the initial state of the shower is given , whereas the later experimentally relevant case studies show results given an observed final state .",
    "neither a hadron nor a jet typically contain all the initial parton energy @xmath5 . in the case of a hadron , this is because of the production of subleading hadrons as well as hadron species which are not registered by the detector in the shower . in the case of a jet ,",
    "the reason is typically the production of hadrons at large angles with the jet axis which correspond to energy flow outside the jet radius @xmath15 , but for instance in charged jets also neutral hadron production in the shower constitute an energy component not part of the jet .    for both jet and hadron , the relation of observed energy to parton energy can be written into the form @xmath49 .",
    "typically , the chief difference between jet and hadron observation is that a jet tends to recover a higher fraction of the parton energy than a single hard hadron , i.e. @xmath50 where the average is done over many showers with a fixed parton energy @xmath5 .",
    "this is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ f - pz ] where @xmath51 , the probability to observe the fraction @xmath52 of the original energy of a 20 gev quark in the final state is shown for three different objects : 1 ) the leading hadron if it is @xmath53 or @xmath54 2 ) a star jet definition @xcite where all particles which are @xmath53 or @xmath54 or @xmath3 and have @xmath55 gev are clustered usign the anti-@xmath7 algorithm with a radius of @xmath56 and 3 ) an ideal jet definition where all particles , regardless of pid or @xmath0 , are clustered with anti-@xmath7 using @xmath56 .",
    "it is evident that the leading hadron in this kinematical regime typically carries only about 15% of the original parton energy whereas on the other end of the spectrum clustering into a jet ideally recovers typically 95% of the energy .",
    "jet definitions matching realistic experimental conditions fall between the two cases .    a _ kinematic bias _ arises then because in an experimental context @xmath51 is typically not probed for fixed parton energy , but rather folded with the steeply falling primary parton production spectrum which can be computed in pqcd and typically falls approximately like a power @xmath57 with @xmath58 at rhic kinematics and @xmath59 at the lhc .",
    "a trigger energy requirement then demands a fixed @xmath60 where both @xmath52 and @xmath5 are allowed to vary event by event .",
    "for the ideal jet described above where @xmath61 , the bias is negligible and @xmath62 approximately corresponds to the parton energy . for a hadron trigger",
    "however , both @xmath5 and @xmath52 prefer to be individually small , yet their product is forced to a certain value . as a result ,",
    "@xmath62 maps to a characteristic range in @xmath5 which depends on @xmath8 and the details of @xmath51 , i.e. the distribution of parton energies contributing to a trigger is no longer the primary pqcd spectrum but becomes biased . in @xcite",
    "this is referred to as trigger bias , however in the following we will use this term in a more general sense referring to any bias introduced by a trigger condition in either vacuum or medium .",
    "another part of the kinematic bias is related to the fact that due to higher order pqcd effects and nuclear initial state effects a hard parton pair is never exactly back to back .",
    "these effects can be approximated by introducing a randomly oriented vector @xmath63 with a gaussian distribution in magnitude which is added to the pair momenta .",
    "a trigger condition then biases this _ a priori _ randomly oriented vector to be pointing towards the trigger direction @xcite .",
    "the _ parton type bias _ then has to do with the fact that the functional form of @xmath51 depends on the shower - initiating parton type : on average , quarks fragment into harder and more collimated showers than gluons . as a result , any trigger condition corresponding to an observed energy is more likely to be fulfilled by a quark than by a gluon .",
    "thus , on the trigger side the fraction of quark jets is generically enhanced as compared to an unbiased pqcd spectrum .",
    "how the bias acts on the away side depends on the kinematical situation . in a regime where the subprocess @xmath64 is dominant , enhancing the near side quark fraction biases the away side towards gluon jets @xcite which is relevant for instance for the 5 - 20 gev momentum regime at rhic .",
    "the biases in vacuum are summarized in tab .",
    "[ t - biasesv ] .",
    ".[t - biasesv]the various biases in vacuum [ cols=\"<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     the evolution of the gluon jet fraction with t2 is shown in tab .",
    "[ t - gluefrac - dihadron ] .",
    "it is apparent that in vacuum the dominance of quark jets leading to a near side with correlated gluons on the away side is progressively broken .",
    "this is a natural consequence of the kinematic shift . in the medium",
    ", there is a strong gluon filtering effect apparent on the away side , leading to the dominance of correlated quark jets on both near and away side .",
    "the resulting away side @xmath65 for the different ranges of t2 is shown in fig .",
    "[ f - iaa - dihadrons ] . perhaps not surprisingly , a significant enhancement of the yield above vacuum is found .",
    "this is a result of the strong kinematic bias , shifting parton energy upward and allowing for more phase space for subleading hadron production , the tangential bias which reduces the medium modification for the away side shower as compared with the single hadron triggered case and the parton type bias which drives the away side towards harder quark jets .",
    "the immediate consequence of these biases is a strong reduction in the rate at which triggers are produced ( which here reflects in the larger statistical errors for the dihadron triggered results , as significantly more events need to be created for this observable than for hadron triggered events ) .      from an experimental point of view , it is often undesirable to run jet finding algorithms on a set of minimum bias events in heavy - ion collisions , as the vast majority of these events will not contain a hard process and hence significant numerical effort is used to cluster events which are not relevant for the study of hard probes . in such a situation , a triggered event sample where events are only processed further if they contain a hard track or tower ( which can be determined early on ) can be used .",
    "the star jet analysis @xcite exemplifies this strategy for instance , whereas jets at atlas or cms do not require such an extra trigger .",
    "however , triggering on events in this way introduces a shower bias . assuming that in addition it is required that the hard track / tower is part of the leading jet",
    ", there is a combined bias from both a jet energy and a track energy condition .",
    "since the kinematical or geometry bias are rather different for jets than for leading hadrons , an interesting question is then whether the objects triggered in this way behave more like jets or like hadrons .",
    "obviously this depends on the ratio of clustered jet energy to required hadron energy  if the hadron is in such a momentum regime that a typical jet contains one or more hadrons at this scale , the bias can be expected to be small ( for instance , requiring a 5 gev hadron in a 100 gev jet is not expected to bias the jet sample in a significant way as the vast majority of 100 gev jets produces hadrons in the 5 gev range ) . on the other hand ,",
    "once the hadron carries a significant fraction of the total jet energy , jets containing hadrons at such a scale become rare and the additional bias will be substantial .    in fig .",
    "[ f - jet - track ] sample calculations with a combined shower bias are shown .",
    "the rule of thumb emerging from this and similar studies appears to be that the additional bias becomes relevant once the hadron energy reaches about half of the jet energy , with a fairly weak dependence on the radius used to cluster the jet . here",
    "it has been tacitly assumed that kinematics is such that jet finding typically recovers  75% of the parton energy , which according to fig .",
    "[ f - pz ] is not a bad assumption .",
    "as the results of this work show , biases occur for almost any high @xmath0 observable that is in any sense related to a conditional probability  be it that an explicit trigger condition is evaluated for the event or be it an implicit condition that a jet needs to be clustered before it can be analyzed .",
    "this means that understanding and discussing biases is an integral part of any theoretical analysys of hard probes .",
    "the main structure of the biases involved is usually already apparent in the vacuum , and the medium modification to the bias structure of the problem can in many cases be regarded as a correction .",
    "the strength of the medium - induced bias is always apparent from the modification ( in most cases suppression ) of the trigger rate , which in turn is directly measured in disappearance observables such as nuclear modification factors @xmath1 for various trigger objects .",
    "however , the strength of the medium - induced bias does not provide an _ a priori _ indication of the modification of conditional yield observables  some biases ( for instance the kinematic bias ) may lead to _ increasing _ conditional yields despite a suppression of the trigger rate , whereas other biases such as the geometry bias work towards a suppression of conditional yields .      as for instance fig .",
    "[ f - iaa - jetff ] indicates , taking biases into account properly can change the result of a computation quantitatively and even qualitatively .",
    "thus , a theoretical model calculation in which the fate of unbiased parton showers in a medium is obtained can not be expected to compare with data based on the notion that the bias of finding a jet is somehow small or would not influence the results in a relevant way . in the particular case of the parallel intra - jet hadron distribution which experimentally appears unchanged in a medium over a large momentum range @xcite , the naive comparison with theory without shower bias would find a large discrepancy to the data , and hence lead to the conclusion that a previously not considered mechanism which makes shower evolution in medium similar to vacuum needs to be introduced .",
    "however , taking the shower bias into account properly , the need for any additional mechanism goes away .",
    "biases are at least equally important for triggered correlation measurements  however for these this is usually expected , although the relative strength of different biases can lead to counter - intuitive results when one e.g. expects suppression of a yield based on the geometry bias whereas in the actual situation the kinematical bias dominates , leading to a net enhancement .      biases can appear as a nuisance in cases where they suppress the physics one is interested in studying , perhaps the most striking illustration is the shower bias for a hadron or jet trigger ( see figs .",
    "[ f - iaa - track ] and [ f - iaa - jet ] ) where strong medium modifications which are _ a priori _ present in the shower are suppressed by the bias with the effect that @xmath2 is driven towards unity .",
    "such nuisance biases should be avioded if possible  in the context of shower biases , this can be done at the simple expense of separating trigger side and observable side , i.e. study away side jets with a trigger hadron on the near side ( as suggested e.g. in @xcite )",
    ".    however , in many cases biases can be utilized by the design of a measurement to control the relevant parameters of the hard process to specifically probe the dependence of a medium - modification on a single control parameter . as an example , consider for instance a comparison of jet - h and @xmath3-h correlations at rhic kinematics . according to fig .",
    "[ f - geo - rhic ] , the geometrical bias of a sufficiently inclusive jet definition is very weak , i.e. in this case @xmath3-h and ijet - h correlations probe almost the same geometry . according to fig .",
    "[ f - kinbias - rhic ] , they also have a fairly similar kinematical bias , and a small shift in trigger energy range can make the underlying parton enery on average the same .",
    "the main difference between the two situations is then given by tab .",
    "[ t - gluefrac - rhic ] from which one can read off that the @xmath3-h correlation produces a high fraction of quark jets on the away side whereas the ijet - h correlation is dominated by away side gluon jets .",
    "thus , in a measurement the bias can be designed to specifically probe the different evolution of quark and gluon jets in the medium .    in a similar way",
    ", the geometry bias can be systematically varied by changing the constituent cut used for the clustering ( cf .",
    "fig  [ f - geo - rhic ] ) .",
    "if the variation of parton kinematics associated with the change is compensated for by a change in the trigger energy range , the measurement can be made to probe various regions of the medium selectively .",
    "of course , such designed observables are inevitably to some degree model - dependent .",
    "however , in most cases the dominant structure of e.g. kinematical or parton type bias is given by vacuum qcd , on top of which the medium - induced bias is a correction .",
    "this means that parameters like the necessary shift in trigger energy range can be determined approximately by well - known vacuum physics and do not have to rely on a particular model of parton - medium interaction in a significant way .",
    "the ancient chinese strategist sun tzu writes in his art of war :    _ it is said that if you know your enemies and know yourself , you will not be imperiled in a hundred battles ; if you do not know your enemies but do know yourself , you will win one and lose one ; if you do not know your enemies nor yourself , you will be imperiled in every single battle . _      _ if you understand parton medium interaction and the involved biases , everything will become clear .",
    "if you understand parton - medium interaction but not the biases , some observables will make sense , others will appear as puzzles ; but if you have neither an understanding of biases nor a good model of parton - medium interaction , you can not know the implication of any hard probe .",
