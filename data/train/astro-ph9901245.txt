    "photometry of individual stars in at least two filters and the interpretation of colour - magnitude diagram ( cmd ) morphology gives the least ambiguous and most accurate information about variations in star formation rate ( _ sfr _ ) within a galaxy back to the oldest stars ( see figure  1 ) .",
    "some of the physical parameters that affect a cmd are strongly correlated , such as metallicity and age , since successive generations of star formation may be progressively enriched in the heavier elements .",

    "@xmath0 has led the way in recent years , and we are optimistic that ground based telescopes capable of achieving excellent seeing , such as vlt , will also provide much useful data , especially in the blue , and in relatively sparse stellar systems such as dwarf irregular ( di ) galaxies .    the small di and dsph galaxies are considered the most likely connection to higher redshift , late type evolving systems , which makes them the most interesting to look at when trying to make a connection to the high redshift universe . in the lg they appear to exhibit a wide variety of sfhs .",
    "these results have affected our understanding of galaxy formation and evolution by demonstrating the importance of episodic star formation in nearby low mass galaxies .",
    "the larger galaxies in the lg have evidence of sizeable old halos , which appear to represent the majority of star formation in the lg by mass , although the problems distinguishing between effects of age and metallicity in a cmd result in a degree of uncertainty in the exact age distribution in these halos .",
    "high quality , deep imaging is the only way of extending detailed sfh studies past the galaxy and its satellites , enabling us to obtain a picture of the fossil record of star formation in galaxies of various types and sizes , and to identify both commonalities and differences in their sfh across the lg to be able to make the comparison with cosmological surveys ( tolstoy 1998 ) more accurate .",
    "the local group ( lg ) will provide a picture of the global star formation properties of galaxies with a wide variety of mass , metallicity , gas content etc . , and will make a sample that ought to reflect the sfh of the universe which can be compared to high redshift survys ( _ e.g. _ , madau _ et al .",
    "initial comparisons suggest these different approaches do not yield the same results ( tolstoy 1998 ; fukugita _ et al .",
    "_ 1998 ) , but the errors are large due to the lack of _ detailed _ sfhs of nearby galaxies .",
    "careful determinations of the complete sfh of nearby galaxies is thus extremely important for understanding star formation properties of nearby galaxies in detail and also to make the connection to high - redshift studies .",
    "it is still not clear if bursting star formation is common enough in lg dis to account for a large population of compact emission line galaxies at intermediate redshifts . if the conclusions of madau _ et al . _ and the sfh of the lg still do not agree then it will be of critical importance for the field of high redshift galaxy research that this discrepancy is understood",
    ". it might be that redshift surveys are strongly biased towards low mass di galaxies undergoing bursts of star formation , and thus they are not accurate indicators of the dominant mode ( by mass ) of star formation in the universe .",
    "stellar evolution theory provides a number of predictions , based on relatively well understood physics , of features expected in cmds for different age and metallicity stellar populations ( see figure  1 ) .",
    "there are a number of clear indicators of varying _",
    "sfr_s at different times which can be combined to obtain a very accurate picture of the entire sfh of a galaxy .",
    "if we can obtain deep enough exposures of the resolved stellar populations in nearby galaxies we can obtain the _ unambiguous age information that comes from the luminosity of mstos_. mstos can clearly distinguish between bursting star formation and quiescent star formation , ( _ e.g. _ hurley - keller _ et al .",
    "the age resolution that is possible does vary , becoming coarser going back in time .",
    "our ability to disentangle the variations in _ sfr _ from mstos also depends upon the the intensity of the past variations and how long ago they occured . for ages less than about 1.5  gyr it is possible to have detailed resolution on the 10@xmath1100  myr time scales .",
    "as can be seen in figure  1 , the ages begin to crowd together for older populations . beyond about 8  gyr ago",
    "the age resolution is on the scale of roughly a gyr .",
    "this of course means that a very short high intensity burst of star formation in this period will be indistinguishable from a lower _ sfr _ but longer lasting epoch of star formation . as will be described in the following sections , however , there are other indicators in a cmd which help to narrow down the range of possible sfhs .",

    "the luminosity of a bl star is fixed for a given age .",
    "subsequent generations of bl stars do not overlie each other as they do on the ms .",
    "the shape and mass at which these `` loops '' are seen in a cmd are a strong function of metallicity and age , in the sense that the lower the metallicity of the galaxy the further back in time an accurate sfh can easily be determined , which makes them especially useful for low metallicity systems such as di galaxies .",

    "the rgb is a very bright evolved phase of stellar evolution , where the star is burning h in a shell around its he core . for a given metallicity",
    "the rgb red and blue limits are given by the young and old limits ( respectively ) of the stars populating it ( for ages @xmath21  gyr ) .",
    "as a stellar population ages the rgb moves to the red , and for constant metallicity , the blue edge is determined by the age of the oldest stars .",
    "however increasing the metallicity of a stellar population will also produce exactly the same effect as aging , and also makes the rgb redder .",
    "this is the age - metallicity degeneracy problem .",
    "the result is that if there is metallicity evolution within a galaxy , it can be impossible to uniquely disentangle effects due to age and metallicity on the basis of the optical colours of the rgb alone , especially in low metallicity systems such as di galaxies ( cf .",

    "the extent in luminosity of the rc can be used to estimate the age of the population that produced it , as shown in the upper panel of figure  2 .",
    "this age measure is _ independent of absolute magnitude and hence distance _ , and indeed these properties can be used to determine an accurate distance measure on the basis of the rc ( _ e.g. _ cole 1998 ) .",
    "the classical rc and rgb appear in a population at about the same time ( @xmath3 0.91.5 gyr , depending on model details ) , where the rgb are the progenitors of the rc stars .",
    "the lifetime of a star on the rgb , t@xmath4 , is a decreasing function of m@xmath5 , but the lifetime in the rc , t@xmath6 is roughly constant .",
    "hence the ratio , t@xmath6 / t@xmath4 , is a decreasing function of the age of the dominant stellar population in a galaxy , and the ratio of the numbers of stars in the rc , and the hb to the number of rgb is sensitive to the sfh of the galaxy ( tolstoy _ et al .",

    "thus , the higher the ratio , n(rc)/n(rgb ) , the younger the dominant stellar population in a galaxy , as shown in the lower panel of figure  2 .",
    "the presence of a large hb population on the other hand ( indicated by a high n(hb)/n(rgb ) or even n(hb)/n(ms ) , is caused by a predominantly much older ( @xmath710  gyr ) stellar population in a galaxy .",

    "however there remain a number of uncertainties in the comparison between the models and the data ( _ e.g. _ gallart _ et al .",
    "_ 1994 ; lynds _ et al .",
    "it is very important that more work is done to calibrate these very bright indicators of past star formation events . in figure  3",
    "theoretical eagb isochrones ( from bertelli _ et al .",
    "_ 1994 ) are overlaid on the hst cmd of the post - starburst bcd galaxy , vii  zw403 , and we can see that a large population of eagb stars is a bright indicator of a past high _ sfr _ , and the luminosity spread depends upon metallicity and the age of the _ sfr_.      the accurate interpretation of the indicators described above depends critically upon having reliable estimates for the distance , the extinction and the metallicity of a galaxy .",
    "ideally we would also like to know if the extinction is patchy and on what scale , and what has been the evolution of the metallicity of the stellar population with time .",
    "these three basic parameters , in conjunction with observational errors and incompleteness make the most significant impact on the properties of the cmd and hence the final sfh model ( tolstoy _ et al .",
    "there are a number of difficulties in accurately determining these basic properties but they can be resolved with careful observation and analysis techniques .    _",
    "the distance _ is the most crucial parameter for accurate analysis of a cmd , partly because it can easily be wrong by many orders of magnitude ( for example the young , red supergiants can be mistaken for the rgb , if the observed cmd is nt deep enough to confirm the identification , _",
    "i.e. _ by detecting a rc or hb )",
    ". if the distance to a galaxy is incorrect this will result in the assumed ages of the different populations being completely wrong . to be sure of the distance to small faint galaxies",
    "it is necessary to have a cmd which goes deep enough to extend below the unambiguous rc / hb strucutre ( tolstoy _ et al .",
    "_ 1998 ) .    _",
    "the extinction _ , both internal to a galaxy and between us and a galaxy can affect the accurate analysis of a cmd .",

    "_ metallicity : _ when a galaxy makes stars , then the detritus of this process ( _ e.g. _ , from sn explosions and stellar winds ) make it unlikely that the galaxy can avoid metallicity evolution altogether .",
    "however , there is no concrete observational evidence that this is true , although abundance ratios of different elements do give us model dependent suggestions ( pagel 1994 ) .",
    "determining the effect of metallicity evolution in a cmd is difficult .",
    "it is impossible to determine a unique model based solely on the rgb because of age - metallicity degeneracy , and if metallicity evolution is neglected then the best model for that galaxy will typically be younger than if metallicity evolution were included ( _ e.g. _ tolstoy _ et al .",
    "_ 1998 ) .",
    "typically the prime limiting factor in making an accurate analysis of a cmd is image crowding , due to overlapping stellar images .",
    "there is basically no way to `` correct '' for crowding in a cmd , so all that can be done is to estimate the size of the uncertainties that result from crowding , from incompleteness analysis ( _ e.g. _ tolstoy 1996 ) , and apply these to any results from the interpretation of the cmd .",
    "using @xmath0 significantly reduces crowding problems , and in certain cases , such as dwarf irregular galaxies , excellent seeing from the ground will also be sufficient to overcome severe crowding problems .",
    "thus the time is ripe for re - observing the the resolved stellar populations of all the galaxies in our lg .",
    "much of our detailed knowledge of the sfhs of galaxies beyond 1  gyr ago comes from the milky way and its nearby dsph satellites or from @xmath0 cmds . to date , the limiting factors have been crowding and resolution limits for accurate stellar photometry from the ground .",
