    "coherent spin transport in semiconductor quantum wires is the basis for interesting spintronic devices such as the spin field effect transistor ( spinfet ) @xcite . in this device ( and its closely related cousins ) a quasi one - dimensional quantum `` wire '' ( as opposed to a quasi two - dimensional quantum `` well '' ) is preferred as the channel for several reasons .",
    "first , one dimensional confinement of carriers ameliorates the harmful effects of ensemble averaging ( at a finite temperature ) , thereby producing a strong conductance modulation @xcite .",
    "this is a pre - requisite for any good `` transistor '' where the conductance of the `` on '' and `` off '' states must differ by several orders of magnitude .",
    "second , one - dimensional confinement leads to a severe suppression of spin relaxation @xcite , @xcite . as a result ,",
    "the transistor channel can be made long , which not only relaxes the demands on fabrication , but also reduces the threshold voltage for switching the device ( the threshold voltage of a spinfet is inversely proportional to the channel length ) .",
    "this , in turn , reduces the dynamic power dissipation . of course , increasing the gate length also increases the transit time through the channel and the switching delay , but the power dissipation is proportional to the _ square _ of the threshold voltage and hence inversely proportional to the square of the gate length , while the transit time is linearly proportional to the gate length . as a result ,",
    "the important figure of merit  the power delay product  scales inversely with the gate length",
    ". a reduced power delay product may be ultimately the most significant advantage that spintronics has over conventional electronics .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in the next section ,",
    "we discuss the dyakonov - perel spin relaxation in a quantum wire structure and derive analytical expressions for the spatial evolution of the _ average _ spin of an electron ensemble as a consequence of dyakonov - perel relaxation .",
    "the derived expressions are perfectly general and are valid in the presence of arbitrary driving electric fields , momentum randomizing collisions and inter - subband scattering . based on these expressions ,",
    "we derive the necessary and sufficient conditions for the dyakonov - perel spin relaxation to exist in a quantum wire .",
    "finally , we conclude by stressing the importance of ensuring single channeled transport in spintronic devices in order to eliminate the dyakonov - perel relaxation .",
    "the dyakonov - perel spin relaxation is caused by _ momentum - dependent _ spin - orbit interactions that originate from bulk inversion asymmetry ( giving rise to a dresselhaus interaction ) and structural inversion asymmetry ( giving rise to a rashba interaction ) . in this section",
    ", we will analytically derive the temporal and spatial evolution of the average spin of an ensemble of electrons in a quantum wire in the presence of these spin orbit interactions .",
    "this will elucidate the origin of the dyakonov - perel relaxation in a quasi one - dimensional structure , and identify pathways to eliminate it .",
    "consider the quantum wire structure shown in figure [ structure ] .",

    "this relaxation is harmful for most spintronic devices ( one example is the spinfet @xcite ) , because it leads to spin randomization .",
    "since optimum materials for spinfet - type devices ( e.g inas ) usually possess strong rashba and also some dresselhaus spin orbit interactions , the only effective way to eliminate the dyakonov - perel relaxation is to ensure and enforce single channeled transport .",
    "there has been recently some proposals that advocate using multi - channeled devices for spinfet s , along with the claim that they provide better spin control via the use of multiple gates @xcite . while we do not believe that spin control is improved by using multiple gates since synchronizing these gates",
    "is an additional engineering burden that can only degrade device operation and gate control , it is even more important to understand that multi - channeled devices have serious drawbacks . the original proposal for the spinfet pointed out that multi - channeled transport is harmful because it dilutes the spin interference effect which is the basis of the spinfet device @xcite .",
