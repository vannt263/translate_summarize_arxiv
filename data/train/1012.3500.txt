    "t tauri stars ( tts ) are by definition variable stars , named after their prototype t tau .",
    "variability in this class of objects is ubiquitous and has inspired a long history of study ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the majority of more recent studies have focused on their optical and near - infrared ( nir ) emission .",
    "@xcite found significant variability of tts in orion a based on near - ir jhk 2mass photometry .",
    "the typical timescale of variation in these tts was on the order of days and could be explained by cool spots , hot spots , extinction , and@xmath2or changes in the mass accretion rate onto the star .",
    "work by @xcite further supported these results . for many tts in that study",
    "the optical and jhk photometry varied simultaneously , supporting that in most objects variability is due to star spots and variable extinction .",
    "however , for several of the objects in that sample there is no correlation between the optical and nir .",
    "this points to structural changes in the disk , which begin to dominate the sed in the k - band , on the order of days .    with the arrival of the _ spitzer space telescope _",
    "@xcite , more detailed studies probing the mid - ir have been possible , particularly with the infrared spectrograph ( irs ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) which provides simultaneous wavelength coverage between @xmath05 and 38  .",
    "variations in the shape and size of the 10   silicate emission feature has been seen in dg tau , xz tau , @xcite and lrll 31 @xcite . in the case of ex lupi ,",
    "transient changes in the dust composition of the disk have been detected with multi - epoch spectra of the silicate emission feature @xcite .",
    "flux changes in the irs spectra of disks have also been observed .",
    "@xcite found substantial variability in lrll 31 , located in ic 348 , on timescales down to days .",
    "the flux of this object oscillated around a pivot point at 8.5    as the emission decreased at wavelengths shortwards of the pivot point , the emission increased at longer wavelengths and vice versa .",
    "the star spots proposed to explain variability at shorter wavelengths could change the irradiation heating , but this would cause an overall increase or decrease of the flux , not an anti - correlation between the flux centered at the pivot point .",
    "@xcite proposed that the observed `` seesaw '' variability was due to dynamical changes in the disk itself .",
    "in particular , changes in the height of the inner disk edge or wall located at the dust destruction radius ( which emits primarily in the nir ) could lead to variable shadowing of the outer disk material ( which emits at longer wavelengths ) .",
    "indeed , the overall characteristics of the flux changes observed can be explained by models of a disk with an inner warp that leads the scale height of the inner disk to change with time @xcite .",
    "it is important to note that the above - mentioned object , lrll 13 , is surrounded by a transitional disk .",
    "transitional disks have nearly photospheric near - ir ( 15  ) and mid - ir ( 520  ) emission below the median excess of class ii objects , coupled with substantial emission above the stellar photosphere at wavelengths beyond @xmath020   @xcite .",
    "this dip in the infrared flux has been attributed to a central `` hole '' in the dust distribution of the disk .",
    "this has been inferred from detailed modeling of some of these transitional objects @xcite and confirmed with sub - millimeter and millimeter interferometric imaging @xcite .    motivated by the variability observed in the transitional disk of lrll  13 , we conducted a _ spitzer _",
    "irs variability study of transitional disks and pre - transitional disks .",
    "pre - transitional disks have significant near - infrared excesses relative to their stellar photospheres , similar to the median spectral energy distribution of disks in taurus @xcite , while also exhibiting the characteristics seen in transitional disks ( i.e. deficits of mid - infrared flux and substantial excesses beyond @xmath020  ) .",
    "this indicates a gapped disk structure where the inner disk is separated from the outer disk .",
    "sub - millimeter and millimeter interferometric imaging ( andrews et al , in prep ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) has confirmed the location of the wall of the outer disk inferred from sed modeling for a few pre - transitional disks ( e.g. lkca  15 , ux  tau  a , rox 44 ) .",
    "the near - ir emission of these objects is due to dust in an optically thick inner disk , a result obtained by using the  veiling \" @xcite of near - infrared spectra @xcite .",
    "here we perform detailed modeling of the broad - band spectral energy distributions of the 14 transitional and pre - transitional disks in our sample at different epochs .",
    "we take into account the effect of shadowing by the inner disk on the outer disk by employing the irradiated accretion disk models of @xcite with the modifications to include shadowing presented in @xcite .",
    "our work adds to the number of detailed modeling efforts of disk variability in the literature which have found some success in reproducing the observations by varying the height of the inner disk wall @xcite .",
    "@xcite s study of the ux ori - type star sv sep came to the conclusion that the variability in the optical and near - ir emission could be explained by changing the height of the inner disk edge , but they were unable to simultaneously fit the variability from the ir out to 100   using a self - shadowed disk .",
    "@xcite reported the variability of two herbig ae stars between 1 - 5  , the region dominated by the inner disk wall , and could explain this change by varying the height of the inner disk edge .",
    "however , this work did not have data at longer wavelengths and so could not test if these models fit the emission from the outer disk .",
    "the advantage of our study over previous works is the quality of the data and the simultaneous wavelength coverage ( 5 - 38  ) provided by _",
    "thus we are able to present the largest and most detailed modeling study of variability in disks around tts to date .",
    "we find that we can explain the variability of most of the pre - transitional disks in the sample by changing the height of the inner disk wall and thus the extent of its shadow on the outer disk , thereby affecting the resulting emission from the outer disk .",
    "we also find that the objects in the sample with the largest amounts of crystalline silicates in their disks exhibit variability on the shortest timescales observed in this study .",
    "our sample of 14 objects was chosen to include bright transitional and pre - transitional disks in taurus and chamaeleon , two nearby 12 myr old star  forming regions with low extinction that were well covered by a _",
    "guaranteed - time observing ( gto ) program ( manoj et al . , submitted ; * ? ? ?",

    "when combined with the gto data , these observations give us baselines of @xmath034 yr and @xmath01 wk .    we included the well - studied and previously modeled transitional disks cs  cha , dm  tau , and gm  aur @xcite and the pre - transitional disks lkca  15 and ux  tau  a @xcite .",
    "we also included other transitional and pre - transitional disks in chamaeleon ( t25 , t35 , t56 , sz  cha ) which had been identified by @xcite .",
    "four objects in our sample were chosen based on analysis conducted in @xcite . in that work , we compared the observed equivalent width of the 10   silicate emission feature and the sed slope between 13 and 31   against a grid of disk models .",
    "ry  tau , ip  tau , cr  cha , and ww  cha were four of the many objects that fell outside of range of ew(10  ) and n@xmath3 covered by the full disk model grid .",
    "one explanation proposed by @xcite and @xcite to explain these outliers was that these disks are actually pre - transitional disks with smaller gaps than had been previously observed .",
    "therefore , we included these objects in the sample based on their potential for being pre - transitional disks .",
    "iso  52 is the only object in our sample which could be explained by the full disk model grid presented in @xcite .",
    "however , we chose to include this object in our variability study because qualitatively its gto irs spectrum resembled what would be expected from a pre - transitional disk with a small gap ( see figure 12 in * ? ? ? * ) . except for cs  cha",
    ", the objects in our sample are thought to be single stars and so the holes and gaps in our objects indicate the likely presence of planets ( see discussion in * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) .4  au @xcite , the binary should clear only a region up to 14  au . ]",
    "here we present three _ spitzer _",
    "irs spectra for each of our targets ( table  [ tab : log ] ) .",

    "the last two spectra for each target were obtained in go program 50403 ( pi : calvet ) . for consistency",
    ", we have re - reduced the gto data in the same way we reduce the go data ( see   [ datredux ] ) .",
    "we note that we also searched the _",
    "archive for all other irs observations of objects in our sample .",
    "we reduced those data as we did our gto and go data and comment further on these additional spectra in the appendix .",
    "all of the go observations were performed in staring mode using the low - resolution modules ( short - low ( sl ) and long - low ( ll ) ) of irs , spanning wavelengths from 514   and 14 - 38  , respectively , with a resolution @xmath490 .",
    "the chamaeleon gto spectra were obtained in staring mode as well while the taurus gto spectra were obtained in mapping mode with 2@xmath53 step maps ( 2 parallel and 3 perpendicular to the slit ) on the target .",
    "most of the gto spectra use the slll configuration .",
    "the exceptions are ry  tau , cr  cha , and ww  cha which were taken with the sl module and the high - resolution modules short - high ( sh ) and long - high ( lh ) , which cover 1019   and 1937  , with @xmath4600 .",
    "we note that in the case of dm  tau , two gto spectra were obtained in program 2 and are listed in table  [ tab : log ] as gto1 and gto2 . throughout this paper",
    ", we only show the gto2 spectrum since it was taken in staring mode , as were our go observations .",
    "in addition , the sl spectrum has a higher snr in the gto2 observation due to a longer integration time .",
    "we note that the gto1 spectrum is equivalent to the gto2 spectrum ( i.e. flux , shape ) within the uncertainties of the observations .",
    "details on the observational techniques and general data reduction steps , including bad pixel identification , sky subtraction , and flux calibration , can be found in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "here we provide a brief summary .",
    "each object was observed twice along the slit , at a third of the slit length from the top and bottom edges of the slit .",
    "basic calibrated data ( bcd ) with pipeline version s18.7 for both the gto and go observations were obtained from the _ spitzer _ science center . with the bcds , we extracted and calibrated the spectra using the smart package @xcite .",
    "bad and rogue pixels were corrected by interpolating from neighboring pixels .",
    "for the low - resolution spectra , the data were sky subtracted using the sky emission in the off - target nods except in the cases of cs  cha go1 , ip tau go 1 , and lkca  15 go 2 where the off - target orders were used in order to minimize over - subtraction of h  i from the sky background at @xmath020  . for the gto sh and lh modules ,",
    "no background subtraction was performed and so the emission of these targets could be slightly overestimated , particularly in lh since the slit is larger . however , the targets are much brighter than the background , and so the emission from the disks should clearly dominate in the mid - ir . after sky subtraction ,",
    "the low - resolution spectra were extracted from the 2d spectral images using a tapered column which varies with the width of the irs point - spread function . for the sh and lh modules ,",
    "a full slit extraction was performed . to flux",
    "calibrate the observations we used spectra of @xmath6 lac ( a1 v ) for the low - resolution modules and @xmath7 dra ( k2iii ) for the high resolution modules . we performed a nod - by - nod division of the target spectra and the @xmath6 lac or @xmath7 dra spectra and then multiplied the result by a template spectrum @xcite .",
    "the final spectrum was produced by averaging the calibrated spectra from the two nods . for the 2@xmath53 maps ,",
    "only the central map positions were used for the final spectrum .",
    "the high - resolution data were rebinned to same sampling as the low - resolution data .",
    "our spectrophotometric accuracy is 25@xmath1 estimated from half the difference between the nodded observations .",
    "we note that there are artifacts in the t25 go1 , iso  52 go1 , t56 go1 , and cr  cha gto spectra at @xmath09  , @xmath07  , @xmath015  , and @xmath835  , respectively .",
    "these spikes are due to additional bad pixels not captured by the bad pixel and rogue masks used in our data reduction . for clarity , we manually mask these artifacts from the spectra .",
    "the final spectra used in this study are shown in figures  [ figirsptd1 ] ,  [ figirsptd2 ] ,  and  [ figirstd ] .",
    "apparent variability could also be the effect of mispointings , which would cause loss in flux especially in sl , which is the module with the narrowest slit width .",
    "pcrs peak - up , which we used for our go observations , yields a pointing accuracy of 0.4@xmath9@xmath9 ( 1-sigma radial rms ) ; this is just slightly less than the accuracy for blind pointing ( 0.5@xmath9@xmath9 ; however , note that earlier in the mission the blind pointing of spitzer was only accurate to @xmath101@xmath9@xmath9 ) . according to a detailed study in @xcite , a 0.4@xmath9@xmath9 pointing offset in sl1 causes a drop in flux of about 7@xmath1 , with a slight ( 1 - 2@xmath1 ) dependence on wavelength .",
    "therefore , if we observe a flux variation @xmath1110@xmath1 that fluctuates with wavelength more than on the few percent level , we can most likely exclude mispointing as the cause of the variability .",
    "the gto observations did not use peak - ups .",
    "however , the gto data of our chamaeleon objects were taken later in the mission , when the blind pointing of _ spitzer _ was improved .",
    "the objects in our sample that could be affected by some mispointing are the taurus gto observations , taken in 2004 february .",
    "they were obtained with blind pointing in mapping mode ; the spectra presented here are extracted from the central map positions . for ip tau , dm tau gto1 , and lkca 15 ,",
    "the sl and ll spectra match at 14  , which argues against mispointing ; since the sl and ll slits are perpendicular to each other , mispointings should affect one module more than the other , resulting in an offset .",
    "there were small ( 5@xmath1 ) offsets between sl and ll for dm tau gto2 , gm aur and ux tau a , with sl lower than ll , suggesting small mispointings .",
    "ry tau likely suffered from larger mispointing , since sh is lower than sl and lh by 20 - 30@xmath1 ( the mispointing relative to sl is more difficult to determine , given that part of sl1 in the go spectra is saturated ) ; also , compared to the go data , the sl spectrum appears low .",
    "overall , the gto spectrum of ry tau is quite uncertain , but the other gto observations should have a pointing accuracy of 0.5@xmath9@xmath9 or better . in order to account for the mispointing discussed here we scale the sl spectra upward so that the sl and ll spectra match .",
    "we note that the high - resolution modules sh and lh are much less affected by small mispointings , since the slits are wider than for the low - resolution modules .",
    "we note that none of the other gto or go observations were mispointed . aside from those observations discussed above ,",
    "there is no mismatch between sl and ll , so we can be confident that the observations are well pointed and that therefore both the sl and ll slits contain the full flux of the object . as an additional check , we find that the sources are located within @xmath01@xmath9@xmath9 of each other in the sl and ll slits amongst the gto , go1 , and go2 observations , further evidence that these sources were well - centered in the slit .",
    "we note that at @xmath014 the sl module ends and the ll module begins .",
    "given that several of our objects have large holes and gaps , the emission of the outer wall begins to dominate at 1520 , coinciding with where sl ends and ll starts .",
    "we also overlaid the irs slit positions for each aor on 2mass k - band images to check for anomalous behavior . in ww  cha go1 and go2 both of the modules were mispointed due to an error in the coordinates ( the declination was off by @xmath01@xmath9@xmath9 ) .",
    "judging from the overlay , the ll module was more off - target than the sl module and the mispointing is more along the spatial direction of the sl slit , but it is difficult to tell how much flux was lost .",
    "we note that in the go observations of sz  cha , two faint objects entered the sl and ll slits at 5.3@xmath9@xmath9 and 12.5@xmath9@xmath9 from the target .",
    "however , it is known that these two objects are not members of cha i and are likely very faint at mid - ir wavelengths @xcite .",
    "therefore , sz  cha dominates the emission in the go spectra . in the gto observations of iso  52",
    "a faint object is present in the ll slit 8.5@xmath9@xmath9 from the target . due to",
    "the different orientation of the irs slit positions in the go observations , this object is not present in the ll slit in this epoch .",
    "however , this object is much fainter than iso  52 , with a magnitude of about 14 in the 3.6 and 4.5   irac bands ( k. luhman , 2010 , private communication ) , and so we can conclude that iso  52 dominates the emission seen in its gto spectrum .",
    "it is evident from the irs spectra of our pre - transitional ( figures  [ figirsptd1 ] and  [ figirsptd2 ] ) and transitional objects ( figure  [ figirstd ] ) that there is some variability in their fluxes .",
    "here we quantitatively discern if there is true variability in the sample and then qualitatively discuss the overall behavior of the variability that is present .",
    "figures  [ figptd1err][fignovar2 ] illustrate the change in flux seen in an object in our sample between different epochs .",
    "the differences in flux between the gto and go1 spectra are shown in figures  [ figptd1err][figtderr ] .",
    "( note : the same analysis for ux  tau  a and t35 is plotted in figure  [ fig1wkerr ] ) . the difference in flux ( @xmath12f@xmath13 )",
    "is plotted in terms of the percentage difference in emission between the gto and go1 data relative to the gto data .",
    "the error bars in the figures correspond to the uncertainties in the observations . except for the cases of dm  tau and t25 ( where @xmath12f@xmath140 ) , we observe significant variability outside of the observational uncertainties in each of the targets between the gto and go1 observations , which were taken more than a year apart .",
    "we performed the same analysis comparing the go1 and go2 spectra , which were taken about one week apart , and we only see variability on these timescales in four objects : ux  tau  a ( figure  [ figptd1err ] ) , iso  52 , t56 ( figure  [ fig1wkerr ] ) , t35 ( figure  [ figptd1err ] ) . in figures  [ fignovar1 ] and  [ fignovar2 ] we show that the rest of the objects in our sample do not vary significantly between the go1 and go2 epochs .    in many of the pre - transitional targets , the flux clearly oscillates around a pivot wavelength ( figure  [ figptd1err ] ) .",
    "as the short wavelength emission decreases , the emission at longer wavelengths increases and as the short wavelength emission increases , the emission at longer wavelengths decreases .",
    "the spectra of lkca  15 can be taken as representative of this group of objects . in figure  [ figptd1err ]",
    "the flux of its go1 spectrum is @xmath010@xmath1 lower than the gto spectrum at wavelengths @xmath108  .",
    "the fluxes of the two spectra are the same around @xmath010  , but the go1 spectrum is higher beyond that point . in the other objects mentioned above , the overall behavior is similar while the pivot wavelength and magnitude of the flux change can vary from object to object .",
    "ux  tau  a does not display this seesaw behavior between the gto and go1 spectra ( figure  [ fig1wkerr ] ) , but it does between the go1 and go2 spectra ( figure  [ figptd1err ] ) .",
    "we point out that while the ry  tau gto and ww  cha go observations were mispointed , that should have resulted in an decrease of flux at all wavelengths relative to the go and gto observations , respectively .",
    "however , we see flux losses at some wavelengths while flux gains at others , indicating that there is true variability in these objects , but we can not accurately constrain the difference in the flux or the pivot wavelength due to the mispointing .    whether or not this seesaw behavior is present in the other pre - transitional objects in the sample is unclear ( figure  [ figptd2err ] ) .",
    "the go1 spectrum of cr  cha has less emission than the gto spectrum shortwards of @xmath06  , but substantially more at longer wavelengths . due to the artifacts in the gto spectrum",
    "@xmath835   discussed in   [ redux ] , we can not confidently tell whether or not the gto and go spectra agree at these wavelengths . in ip  tau",
    "the flux at @xmath15 @xmath107 is about the same , but it is lower for the go1 spectrum at longer wavelengths . for t56 , the emission in the go1 spectrum is higher than the gto spectrum beyond @xmath020  .",
    "it appears that the flux in the go1 spectrum is lower at @xmath1020  , but the snr is too poor @xmath107   to tell if this holds at the shortest wavelengths . in t35 ,",
    "when comparing the go1 and go2 spectra , the flux is the same @xmath107  , but the go2 spectrum has less emission beyond that .",
    "again , the spread in uncertainties is large in t35 because of the poorer snr .",
    "the behavior observed in the transitional disks is displayed in figure  [ figtderr ] .",
    "gm  aur has the seesaw behavior seen in lkca  15 , where the pivot is at @xmath15@xmath018  . in cs  cha , only the flux of the 10   silicate emission feature changes substantially between the gto and go1 spectra .",
    "dm  tau and t25 have no discernible variability .    the four objects in our sample which vary on 1  wk timescales display behavior that could be classified as seesaw - like as already described above , but they also exhibit additional behavior ( figure  [ fig1wkerr ] ) . ux  tau  a s go1 spectrum is weaker at all wavelengths relative to the gto spectrum , indicating that the emission of this object has decreased with time .",
    "the spread in uncertainties is large in iso  52 , t56 , and t35 because of poor snr ; however , it appears that the iso  52 and t56 spectra diverge beyond @xmath020   between the go1 and go2 spectra and that the t35 spectra diverge shortwards of @xmath010   between the gto and go1 spectra .      using disk models",

    "while we do not try to fit this decrease with models , it can possibly be attributed to a decrease in the luminosity at the bands where the disk absorbs stellar radiation , most likely due to star spots @xcite , or an overall decrease in the accretion luminosity of the disk , most likely from a change in the mass accretion rate by a factor of about 3 .",
    "we also analyzed an additional shlh spectrum from the _ spitzer _ archive ( see appendix for more details ) .",
    "this spectrum has substantially lower emission at @xmath4013   ( figure  [ uxshlh ] ) .",
    "we can fit the shlh spectrum using an inner wall with a temperature of 1800  k. this hotter inner wall is closer to the star and leads to a larger shadow on the outer wall .",
    "given that we do not have simultaneous data at shorter wavelengths , we can not test if this wall fits the sed at @xmath4110   at the time the shlh spectrum was taken .",
    "as a result of trying to reproduce the variability observed in our sample , in this study we also performed fitting of the silicate emission features visible in the irs spectra , deriving the mass fraction of amorphous and crystalline silicates in the outer wall and the optically thin regions ( tables  [ tab : silwall ] and  [ tab : silthin ] ) .",
    "( we refer the reader to figure 1 of @xcite for the positions of the strongest features of crystalline silicates visible in irs spectra . )",
    "we do not attempt a detailed @xmath42 fitting since it would be too computationally expensive to do so with our disk code .",
    "thus , the derived mass fractions in tables  [ tab : silwall ] and  [ tab : silthin ] should be taken as representative of a dust composition that can reasonably explain the observed sed .",
    "we refer the reader to @xcite for a review of the typical degeneracies of dust fitting . in short , large grains of amorphous",
    "olivine and amorphous pyroxene composition are the most degenerate , in the sense that one of these components could be replaced by the other and a similar fit would be found .",
    "enstatite and forsterite are also somewhat degenerate at cooler temperatures .",
    "another caveat , which was noted earlier , is that the shapes of the grains in the disk are not well known .",
    "we leave it to future work to further constrain the mass fractions of silicates in these disks .    for the inner wall of our objects , the silicate composition consisted solely of amorphous olivines",
    ". however , since the inner wall does not produce significant 10   silicate emission in the objects in this study , we have no way to distinguish between pyroxene and olivine silicates in the inner wall .",
    "also , while we included crystalline silicates in the disk behind the outer wall , it is the outer wall that dominates the emission at the longer irs wavelengths .",
    "because of these previous two points , here we only discuss the composition of silicates in the optically thin dust region and the outer wall .",
    "most of the absorption and emission of the outer walls in our sample are dominated by amorphous silicates ( table  [ tab : silwall ] ) .",
    "the exception is t35 which is dominated by crystalline silicates ( @xmath060@xmath1 ) .",
    "the optically thin region also tends to be dominated by amorphous silicates with typically @xmath010@xmath1 or less of crystalline silicates .",
    "this is not the case in t56 which contains @xmath025@xmath1 crystalline silicates .",
    "of the three crystalline silicates studied in this work , we are more likely to see forsterite rather than enstatite and silica in the optically thin region ( table  [ tab : silthin ] ) . comparing the optically thin region and outer wall in objects that have both , it appears that silica is more likely to be present in the outer wall .",
    "relative to the optically thin region , we find more crystalline silicates in the outer walls of t56 , sz  cha , and lkca  15 and less for cs  cha and gm  aur .",
    "the amount of crystalline silicates in cr  cha and ip  tau is the same between both regions .",
    "ry  tau has no evidence for significant amounts of crystalline silicates in its disk .",
    "the results from the dust fitting performed in this work are in reasonably good agreement with the detailed dust fitting conducted by @xcite which used a two - temperature model .",
    "the objects that the two samples have in common are dm  tau , gm  aur , ip  tau , and lkca  15 .",
    "both works find that these four disks are dominated by amorphous silicates and that there are relatively few crystalline silicates present .",
    "furthermore , olivine silicates dominate the inner parts of the disk that contribute to the 10   emission .",
    "understanding the underlying causes of the variability observed in this sample depends upon the physical locations in the disk from which the changes in flux arise . given that the sample was chosen to include pre - transitional and transitional disks , the nature of these objects will necessarily play a key role in this .",
    "the disk structures of lkca  15 , ux  tau  a , gm  aur , and ry  tau have been independently confirmed .",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",

    "millimeter interferometry and near - ir data are needed to confirm that there are cavities in these disks and to probe if the inner disk is optically thick",
    ". however , the irs spectra of sz  cha , ww  cha , and t56 are reminiscent of lkca  15 , suggesting that they are gapped disks as well .",
    "likewise , t35 resembles ux  tau  a. cs  cha , dm  tau , and t25 have large deficits of flux which are strong indicators of inner disk holes , as seen in gm  aur .",
    "it follows that one can roughly divide the disk into two regions  inner ( inner wall and@xmath2or optically thin dust region ) and outer ( outer wall and outer disk ) .",
    "interestingly , the only disks that do not display variability in our sample are the transitional disks dm  tau and t25 whose inner regions do not contain substantial amounts of small dust . dm  tau s inner hole is relatively devoid of small dust and t25 s inner region contains only 10@xmath43  .",
    "in contrast , the transitional disks of gm  aur and cs  cha have about ten times more small dust within their optically thin inner cavities than the transitional disks of dm  tau and t25 .",
    "we can infer that there is not enough material in the inner regions of dm  tau and t25 to lead to significant variability .",
    "objects in the sample that have a notable amount of material in their inner region do vary .",
    "we attempted to understand the variability seen in our sample by fitting the sed with disk models . in the pre - transitional disks of lkca  15 , sz",
    "cha , ux tau  a , ip  tau , t56 , and t35 we can reasonably reproduce the emission between 538   within the uncertainties by varying the height of the inner disk wall by 22@xmath1 , 33@xmath1 , 17@xmath1 , 17@xmath1 , 50@xmath1 , and 20@xmath1 , respectively ( figures  [ figlkca15 ] and  [ figiptau ] ) . when the inner wall is taller , the emission at the shorter wavelengths is higher since the inner wall dominates the emission at 28  .",
    "the taller inner wall casts a larger shadow on the outer disk wall and we see less emission at the wavelengths beyond 20   where the outer wall dominates . when the inner wall is shorter , the reverse occurs .",
    "iso  52 is an extreme case .",
    "its inner wall height has to change by 400@xmath1 to explain the observed variability ( figure  [ figiso52 ] ) .",
    "we did not attempt to fit the variability seen in the pre - transitional disks of ry  tau and ww  cha due to complications introduced by mispointing and insufficient data .",
    "however , these disks exhibit seesaw - like variability ( figures  [ figrytau ] and  [ figwwcha ] ) . taking the modeling described above into consideration",
    ", one can surmise that the variability in these disks is also due to an inner wall which varies in height .",
    "while the variations in the sed for many objects in the sample can be reproduced by changes in the height of the inner wall , we note that other explanations that have not been considered here may possibly result in similar sed behaviors .",
    "we leave exploration of this to future work .      in the pre - transitional disks of ip  tau and",
    "t56 the 10   silicate emission changes ( figure  [ figiptau ] ) .",
    "this feature is dominated by sub - micron sized grains in the optically thin dust region located within the disk gap .",
    "we can reproduce the change in this emission by adjusting the amount of small dust in this region .",
    "alternatively , given that the spatial distribution of this dust is largely unknown , it is possible that part of the optically thin dust region is in the shadow of the inner wall and so in some cases the amount of dust we see in this region varies as the height of the inner wall changes .",
    "in lkca  15 and sz  cha , the 10   silicate emission does not change .",
    "this indicates that the optically thin dust is vertically distributed in such a way that it is not shadowed by the inner wall .",
    "this could suggest that there is more dust in the gap that we do not detect .",
    "therefore , the values for the amount of dust in the gaps of pre - transitional disks should be taken as a lower limit .",
    "alternatively , this optically thin dust could be heated indirectly . in order to explain the presence of the 10   silicate emission feature in self - shadowed herbig ae@xmath2be stars",
    ", @xcite proposed that light reaches the shadowed regions after being scattered off of the upper parts of the inner wall .",
    "in addition , they suggest that the thermal emission from the wall may also irradiate the shadowed region .",
    "similar mechanisms may be at work in the optically thin regions of pre - transitional disks .",
    "of the four transitional disks in the sample , two exhibit variability : cs  cha and gm  aur ( figure  [ figgmaur ] ) . in cs  cha , only the 10   silicate emission changes between epochs .",
    "we can explain this by varying the amount of optically thin dust located within the central cavity .",
    "on the other hand , the dust in cs  cha could be spatially distributed in such a way as to cause the observed variability .",
    "for example , cs  cha is a spectroscopic binary and , while we do not see the type of variability expected for a circumbinary disk @xcite , the optically thin dust in the hole of cs  cha could be unevenly distributed in such a way that the alignment of the binary system at the time when the go data was taken illuminates more of the dust .",
    "high - resolution near - infrared interferometry of this object would be ideal to test this .    to fit the variability of gm  aur , we not only change the amount of optically thin dust in the hole , we have to change the height of the outer wall as well .",
    "@xcite demonstrated that gm  aur s near - infrared excess continuum between 15   could be reproduced by emission from sub - micron - sized optically thin dust .",
    "these variability data suggest that there is some optically thick structure in the inner disk perhaps composed of large grains and@xmath2or limited in spatial extent which does not contribute substantially to the emission between 15   and leads to shadowing of the outer disk .",
    "alternatively , it could be that while the dust in the hole is vertically optically thin , it becomes horizontally optically thick at some radius and shadows the outer disk @xcite .",
    "this scenario implies that the vertical extent of the optically thin dust region changes to produce a shadow commensurate with the variable emission at the longer wavelengths .",
    "then again , the fact that we have to change the height of the outer wall of gm aur to fit its variability may not be linked to shadowing of the outer wall by inner disk material , but by changes in the outer wall itself .",
    "for example , our models assume the outer wall is axisymmetric , but changes in the visible area of the wall could lead to different emission from the outer wall .",
    "we note however that the orbital timescales at the outer wall are much longer than the timescales probed in this work .",
    "the case of gm  aur needs to be explored further .",
    "cr  cha displays a considerable change in slope at 6   ( figure  [ figchx3 ] ) . in the other objects in this sample ,",
    "the emission at this wavelength is typically dominated by either an optically thick inner wall or an optically thin dust region .",
    "this could suggest that the inner disk alternates from being dominated by optically thick material in the gto epoch to being dominated by optically thin dust at the time that the go observations were taken 3  yrs later .",
    "alternatively , the change in slope at 6   could also be due to a substantial decrease in the temperature of the inner wall .",
    "accordingly , we reproduced the variability observed in cr  cha by fitting it with a pre - transitional disk model in the gto epoch and both a transitional and pre - transitional disk model in the go epoch .    in the case where we fit the go spectra with a transitional disk model , it follows that once the optically thick inner wall disappears , we see all of the optically thin dust within the disk hole .",
    "hence there is substantially more 10   emission in the go observations which we reproduce by increasing the amount of dust in the optically thin region .",
    "we note that the height of the outer wall in the go epoch , where we assume that there is no shadowing , is less than the height of the wall in the gto epoch when there is an optically thick inner wall shadowing part of the outer wall .",
    "given that we take the shadowed portion of the outer wall into account in the case where the inner disk is optically thick , this decrease in wall height in the case where the inner disk is optically thin may imply that a portion of the outer wall is still shadowed .",
    "as in the case of gm aur discussed in   [ disoptthin ] , this suggests that either there is an optically thick structure in the inner disk that we can not detect or that the vertically optically thin dust is radially optically thick .",
    "it is expected that the optically thick inner disk in pre - transitional disks will disappear at some point via accretion onto the star and@xmath2or a lack of resupply of dust and gas from the outer disk , leaving behind a transitional disk .",
    "however , the viscous timescale at these radii is on the order of 10@xmath44  yrs making it improbable that we are detecting this transition .    alternatively , in the case where we fit the go spectra with a pre - transitional disk model",
    ", we have to decrease the temperature of the wall from 1400  k ( in the gto fit ) to 800  k. this corresponds to a change in radius from 0.2  au to 1  au .",
    "this may not be a viable model , since it is not clear what process could make the dust grains sublimate above 800  k. in any event , the amount of optically thin dust in the gap remains about the same as seen in the gto epoch .",
    "near - ir spectra at shorter wavelengths are necessary to decipher whether or not the inner disk of cr  cha is optically thick or optically thin .",
    "multi - epoch spectra would be useful in constraining if the nature of the inner disk changes with time .",
    "millimeter confirmation of the hole in cr  cha with _",
    "is necessary to decipher if there is indeed a cavity in this disk .",
    "a higher mass accretion rate will lead to a higher surface density in the disk and so the height of the wall ( defined as the point where the optical depth to the stellar radiation reaches @xmath01 ) will increase @xcite . in the cases of lkca  15 ,",
    "sz  cha , ux tau  a , ip  tau , t56 , and t35 the change in the near - ir emission could be explained if the mass accretion rate varies by factors of @xmath0310 relative to the mass accretion rate used in this work .",
    "studies have shown that mass accretion rates onto the star are indeed variable . in the transitional disk of tw hya ,",
    "accretion rates of 5@xmath45 m@xmath46 yr@xmath47 ( muzerolle et al .",
    "2000 ) , 2@xmath48 m@xmath46 yr@xmath47 ( herczeg et al .",
    "2004 ) , and 3.5@xmath48 m@xmath46 yr@xmath47 ( ingleby & calvet , submitted ) have been measured .",
    "alencar & batalha ( 2002 ) found that tw hya s mass accretion rate varied between 10@xmath49 ",
    "10@xmath50 m@xmath46 yr@xmath47 over a one year period and that smaller variations were seen even on periods of days . while these accretion rates have been measured onto the star ( i.e. the accretion columns ) ,",
    "the orbital timescales at the dust sublimation radius ( @xmath01  week ) are within the timescales of infrared variability seen . hence the changes in the mass accretion rate in the inner disk necessary to change the wall height are plausible .    however , if the mass accretion rate increases , the radius of the dust sublimation radius will increase as well given that @xmath51 and @xmath52 @xmath53 @xcite .",
    "the change in the radius is much larger than the change in the wall height . for a wall with a relatively similar height and a larger radius , the shadow on the outer wall ( see equations a4 and a5 in the appendix of * ? ? ?",
    "* ) will not be large enough to diminish the flux at the longer wavelengths to the levels observed .",
    "therefore , a change in mass accretion rate alone can not explain the observed seds in the pre - transitional disks in our sample , indicating that the variability in these disks is due to a change in the wall height while keeping the radius of the wall fixed .",
    "earlier we noted that to fit the variability in the transitional disks of gm  aur and cs  cha and the pre - transitional disks of ip  tau and t56 , we altered the amount of dust in the optically thin region .",
    "it has been proposed that this small dust exists in the holes of some objects due to dust traveling with gas from the outer disk and into the inner disk after being filtered at the outer wall @xcite . in this scenario",
    ", changes in the amount of dust in the optically thin region could be due to variable mass accretion rates .",
    "the reason behind the variability of accretion is not understood .",
    "@xcite proposed that changes in the disk magnetic flux coupled with changes in the x - ray luminosity can lead to substantial changes in the mass accretion rates of typical tts disks .",
    "however , this applies to accretion flows onto the star . for the inner disk , accretion variability",
    "could be linked to the formation mechanism behind cavities in disks , namely planets .",
    "one can speculate that changes in mass accretion rate could be due to planetary companions which alter the accretion flow in the inner disk regions , eventually getting onto the star . @xcite and",
    "@xcite demonstrate that planets will affect the mass accretion rate into the inner disk .",
    "it is possible that this could occur on the timescales seen here given that the 13 yr variability observed in our sample corresponds to orbital timescales of 12 au , plausible radii for planets to be located .",
    "the changes seen in the inner disk could be due to warps .",
    "to explain the variability seen in the transitional disk of lrll 13 , @xcite proposed that the variability was due to dynamical changes in the inner disk , particularly in the form of disk warps .",
    "@xcite showed that the seesaw - like variability observed could be explained by models of a disk with an inner warp which leads the height of the inner disk to change with time .",
    "such warps could be due to the presence of multiple planets in the disk . while a disk would damp the eccentricity of a single planet",
    ", multiple planets would be able to maintain eccentric orbits which would induce modulations that would effect the inner disk edge @xcite , leading to the change in the height of the inner wall needed to reproduce the observations of pre - transitional disks .",
    "warps caused by planets could account for the timescales of the flux changes seen in our sample .",
    "variability on timescales of 13 yr corresponds to orbital timescales of 12 au and 1 wk timescales correspond to 0.07  au .",
    "radii of 12  au are plausible locations for planetary companions .",
    "a radius of 0.07  au is comparable to the dust destruction radius .",
    "many `` hot jupiters '' are known to exist at radii @xmath100.1  au @xcite , comparable to or within the magnetospheric radius of their host stars and well within the dust sublimation radius , most likely reaching their current positions via migration @xcite .",
    "the formation of crystalline silicates requires high temperatures @xcite .",
    "one proposed mechanism for the formation of crystalline silicates is accretion heating in the innermost disk , close to the dust sublimation radius ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    ". however , in our objects crystalline silicates can be seen in the outer wall , which is located at radii much further than the dust sublimation radius . in several other studies , it is also found that crystalline silicates are in the outer regions of the disk @xcite .",
    "this suggests that large - scale radial mixing is necessary to transport the crystalline silicates that form near the dust destruction radius out to larger radii in the disk ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , but this must occur before the hole or gap forms . alternatively , crystalline silicates can form in the inner disk due to heating from shocks in the disk created by planets @xcite . in this case , the crystalline silicates would still need to be transported to the outer disk .",
    "changes in the accretion rate or stellar luminosity could possibly lead to the formation of crystalline silicates in the surface layers of the disk as proposed in the case of ex lupi @xcite . or as noted by @xcite , local processing may be due to collisions of larger bodies that produce small grains heated to temperatures high enough to create crystals .",
    "one interesting by - product of this study is the possibility to explore how or if the silicate composition is linked to the variability seen in the sample . indeed",
    ", we find that the four disks with 1  wk variability contain the highest amounts of crystalline silicates in the sample . in ux",
    "tau  a , iso  52 , t35 , and t56 , the outer wall is composed of @xmath019@xmath1 , 20@xmath1 , 60@xmath1 , and 18@xmath1 crystalline silicates , respectively .",

    "we propose that this link is planets .",
    "planets can instigate warps , shocks , and collisions in the disk which can lead to both changes in the height of the inner disk wall and a higher abundance of crystalline silicates .",
    "planets can also lead to recurring changes in the disk . in t56 and t35 ,",
    "the variability observed at @xmath54 20   appears to oscillate between a maximum and minimum flux .",
    "for t56 , the flux at these wavelengths is at a minimum in the gto epoch , it increases in the go1 epoch , and in the go2 epoch it decreases back to the same flux observed in the gto epoch . in t35 , the gto and go1 spectra are both at the maximum and the go2 spectrum is lower .",
    "such changes point to a periodic origin , such as a planetary orbit .",
    "since planets are likely present in most of the disks in this sample , it would seem that these four disks with high amounts of crystalline silicates either have more planets or that the presence of hot jupiters ( see   [ diskwarps ] ) is significant .",
    "in this work we see various types of variability on 3 - 4 year timescales and in some cases we see variability on 1 week timescales .",
    "the dominant type of variability observed can be classified as seesaw - like behavior , whereby the emission at shorter wavelengths varies inversely with the emission at longer wavelengths .",
    "we attempted to understand the origin of the variability in pre - transitional and transitional disks by modeling the overall seds at different epochs . for many of the pre - transitional disks we find that the variability can be explained by changing the height of the inner disk wall and hence the shadow on the outer disk .",
    "typically , the height of the wall varies by @xmath020@xmath1 .",
    "we also perform sed model fitting for the transitional disks gm  aur and cs  cha . to fit the variability of gm  aur , we vary the amount of optically thin dust in the hole and the height of the outer wall . in cs",
    "cha , only the 10   silicate emission changes between epochs and so we only alter the amount of dust in the optically thin region .",
    "the transitional disks dm  tau and t25 are the only two disks in the sample which display no variability .",
    "these disks inner regions do not contain discernible amounts of dust .",
    "we propose that planets are responsible for the changes observed in our sample .",
    "overall , it seems that most of the variability seen is due to material in the inner disk casting a shadow on the outer disk .",
    "the height of the inner wall can vary due to disk warps caused by planets in the disk .",
    "we can also link the silicate dust compositions found in this work to the presence of planets .",
    "we find that crystalline silicates are common in the outer disks of our objects , too far from the central star to be explained by most crystallization mechanisms .",
    "in addition , the four disks in our sample which have the highest crystalline silicate mass fractions vary on 1  wk timescales . in two of these four disks , we see periodic changes in the infrared emission .",
    "planets can cause shocks and collisions which can heat the dust to high enough temperatures to crystallize the dust .",
    "planets can also lead to short timescale and periodic variability .",

    "<S> the sample is composed of transitional and pre - transitional objects which contain holes and gaps in their disks . </S>",
    "<S> we detect variability between 538   in all but two of our objects on timescales of 23 years . </S>",
    "<S> most of the variability observed can be classified as seesaw behavior , whereby the emission at shorter wavelengths varies inversely with the emission at longer wavelengths . for many of the objects we can reasonably reproduce the observed variability using irradiated disk models , particularly by changing the height of the inner disk wall by @xmath020@xmath1 . when the inner wall is taller , the emission at the shorter wavelengths is higher since the inner wall dominates the emission at 28  . </S>",
    "<S> the taller inner wall casts a larger shadow on the outer disk wall , leading to less emission at wavelengths beyond 20   where the outer wall dominates . </S>",
    "<S> we discuss how the possible presence of planets in these disks could lead to warps which cause changes in the height of the inner wall . </S>",
    "<S> we also find that crystalline silicates are common in the outer disks of our objects and that in the four disks in the sample with the most crystalline silicates , variability on timescales of 1  week is present . </S>",
    "<S> in addition to explaining the infrared variability described above , planets can create shocks and collisions which can crystallize the dust and lead to short timescale variability . </S>"
