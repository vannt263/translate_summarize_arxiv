    "[ chp3intro ] a common technique for eliciting consumption in studies of substance abuse is the time - line follow - back ( tlfb ) method , in which one asks subjects to report daily consumption retrospectively over the preceding week , month or other designated period . in smoking cessation research , for example",
    ", tlfb is one important method for measuring cigarette consumption and defining periods of quit and lapse .",
    "although tlfb is a practical approach to quantifying average smoking behavior [ @xcite ] , tlfb data can harbor substantial errors as measures of daily consumption [ @xcite ] .",
    "tlfb questionnaires request exact daily cigarette counts , which smokers are unlikely to remember , particularly after several days have passed .",
    "moreover , some smokers may understate consumption to avoid the social stigma attached to excessive smoking or an inability to quit [ @xcite ] .",
    "thus , smoking cessation studies typically require validation of tlfb reports of zero consumption by biochemical measurement of exhaled carbon monoxide or nicotine metabolites from saliva or blood .",
    "a second concern is that histograms of tlfb - derived daily cigarette counts commonly exhibit spikes at multiples of 20 , 10 or even 5 cigarettes .",
    "this phenomenon , known as `` digit preference '' or `` heaping , '' is thought to reflect a tendency to report consumption in terms of packs ( each pack in the us contains 20 cigarettes ) or half or quarter packs .",
    "the heaps presumably arise because many smokers do not remember precisely how many cigarettes they smoked and therefore report their count rounded off to a nearby convenient number .",
    "it has also been hypothesized that some smokers consume exactly an integral number of packs per day as a self - rationing strategy [ @xcite ] , but evidence so far suggests that such behavior , if it exists , causes only a small fraction of the observed heaping [ @xcite ] .",
    "indeed , @xcite observed that the distribution of biochemical residues of smoking is smooth , suggesting that heaping is a phenomenon of reporting rather than consumption .",
    "recall bias and heaping bias in self - reported longitudinal cigarette counts potentially affect estimates of both means and treatment effects .",
    "moreover , heaping may lead to underestimation of within - subject variability , thanks to smokers who regularly report one pack rather than a precise count that varies around some mean in the vicinity of 20 . if a large enough fraction of subjects in a study are of this kind , estimates of both within - subject and between - subject variability can be distorted .",
    "although there has been substantial research on statistical modeling of heaping and digit preference in a range of disciplines [ heitjan and rubin ( @xcite ) , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite ] , the only such application in smoking cessation research is that of @xcite , who described a latent - variable rounding model for heaped univariate tlfb cigarette count data .",
    "they postulated that the reported cigarette count is a function of the unobserved true count and a latent heaping behavior variable .",
    "the latter can take one of four values , representing exact reporting , rounding to the nearest 5 , rounding to the nearest 10 , and rounding to the nearest 20 .",
    "except for `` exact '' reporters ( i.e. , those who report counts not divisible by 5 ) , one obtains at best partial information on the true count and the heaping behavior .",
    "they analyzed univariate count data from a smoking cessation clinical trial , assuming a zero - inflated negative binomial distribution for the true underlying counts together with an ordered categorical logistic selection model for heaping behavior given true count .",
    "the analysis of @xcite has three important limitations : first , they included only data from the last day of eight weeks of treatment , ignoring the 55 preceding days .",
    "second , they assumed  without empirical verification  that reported counts not divisible by 5 were accurate .",
    "and third , they assumed that the preference for counts ending in 0 or 5 actually represented rounding rather than some other form of reporting error .",
    "that is , a declared count of 20 cigarettes was taken to mean that the true count was somewhere between 10 and 30 cigarettes , and was merely misreported as 20 . in the absence of more accurate data on the true , underlying count ,",
    "attempts to model heaping must rely on some such assumptions .",
    "precise assessment of smoking behavior has taken on increasing importance as researchers explore the value of reducing consumption as a way to lessen the harms of smoking [ @xcite , @xcite ] and to improve the chance of ultimately quitting [ @xcite , @xcite ] .",
    "the advent of the inexpensive hand - held electronic diary ( ed ) that allows the instantaneous recording of _ ad libitum _ smoking has created the possibility of making much more accurate measurements .",
    "such evaluation is an instance of _ ecological momentary assessment _ [ ema ; @xcite ] , in that it generates records of events logged as they occur in real - life settings . in @xcite , researchers asked 236 participants in a smoking cessation study to use a specially programmed ed to record each cigarette as it was smoked over a 16-day pre - quit period ; moreover , the ed periodically prompted the smokers to record any cigarettes they had missed . at days 3 , 8 and 15",
    ", subjects visited the clinic to complete a tlfb assessment of daily smoking since the preceding visit ( 2 , 5 or 7 days previously ) , stating how many cigarettes they had smoked each day .",
    "the study found that while the tlfb data contained the expected heaps at multiples of 10 and 20 , the ema data had practically none .",
    "average smoking rates from the two methods were moderately correlated ( @xmath0 ) , but the within - subject correlation of daily consumption between tlfb and ema was modest ( @xmath1 ) .",
    "self - report tlfb consumption was on average higher than ema ( by 2.5 cigarettes ) , but on 32% of days , subjects recorded more cigarettes by ema than they later recalled by tlfb .",
    "these data provide us with an opportunity  unprecedented , so far as we know  to study the relationship between self - reports of daily cigarette consumption by tlfb and ema . to describe this relationship",
    ", we develop a statistical model with two components : the first is a regression that predicts the patient s notional `` remembered '' cigarette count ( a latent factor ) from the ema count .",
    "the second is a regression that predicts the rounding behavior  described as in @xcite with an ordinal logistic regression  from the remembered count and fully observed predictors .",
    "the models include random subject effects that describe the propensities of the subjects to mis - remember their actual consumption ( in the first component ) and to report the remembered consumption with a characteristic degree of accuracy ( in the second ) . assuming that ema represents the true count",
    ", the first component of the model allows us to examine the recall bias resulting from mis - remembering , while the second component describes the heaped reporting errors .",
    "[ method1 ] let @xmath2 denote the observed heaped tlfb consumption for subject @xmath3 on day @xmath4 , @xmath5 , @xmath6 , and let @xmath7 denote the vector of tlfb data for subject @xmath3 .",
    "let @xmath8 be the ema consumption on subject @xmath3 , day @xmath4 , and let @xmath9 be the vector of ema data for subject @xmath3 .",
    "we furthermore let @xmath10 be a vector of baseline predictors for subject @xmath3 , with @xmath11 representing predictors of recall and @xmath12 predictors of heaping . these predictor sets may overlap .",
    "the first part of our model assumes that for each day and subject there is a notional remembered cigarette count , denoted @xmath13 [ @xmath14 .",
    "we assume @xmath13 is distributed as poisson conditionally on a random effect @xmath15 , the ema smoking pattern @xmath8 and the covariate vector @xmath16 , with mean @xmath17 the parameters @xmath18 and @xmath19 represent the effects of ema consumption and baseline predictors , respectively , on the latent remembered count . the random effect @xmath15 , which we assume normally distributed with mean @xmath20 and variance @xmath21 , represents heterogeneity among subjects .",
    "we note that there are no @xmath20 values of @xmath8 in the shiffman data , which are from a pre - quit study in which subjects were encouraged to smoke as normal .",
    "thus , we can include @xmath22 as a predictor . in more general contexts where @xmath20 ema counts are possible , one can adjust the model in simple ways to avoid this problem .",
    "moreover , when excessive @xmath20 counts occur in the tlfb data , one can fit a zero - inflated count model , as in @xcite , for the remembered count .",
    "following @xcite , we assume that a latent rounding indicator @xmath23 [ @xmath24 dictates the degree of rounding to be applied to the notional remembered count  @xmath13 . specifically , we let @xmath23 take one of four possible values : @xmath25 implies reporting the exact count , @xmath26 implies rounding to the nearest multiple of 5 , @xmath27 implies rounding to the nearest multiple of 10 , and @xmath28 implies rounding to the nearest multiple of 20 .",
    "we assume that the probability distribution of the heaping indicator depends on @xmath13 , a subject - level random effect @xmath29 that is independent of @xmath15 , and a baseline predictor vector @xmath12 .",
    "specifically , we propose the following proportional odds model for the conditional distribution of  @xmath23 : @xmath30 here @xmath31 , and @xmath32 is the inverse logit function @xmath33 . the parameters @xmath34 refer to the successive intercepts of the logistic regressions , @xmath35 refers to its slope with respect to the remembered count , and @xmath36 refers to its slopes with respect to the vector of heaping predictors @xmath12 .",
    "the random effect @xmath37 describes between - subject differences in heaping propensity not otherwise accounted for in the model .      as in @xcite , the model links the observed @xmath2 to the latent @xmath13 and @xmath23 via the coarsening function @xmath38 : @xmath39 for example , at time @xmath4 , subject @xmath3 with @xmath40 and @xmath25 reports @xmath41 , whereas @xmath42 , @xmath43 , and @xmath44 .",
    "figure  [ heapdiag3 ] illustrates this heaping mechanism .     as a function of the underlying count @xmath45 and the rounding behavior @xmath46 . ]    a coarsened outcome @xmath47 may arise from possibly several @xmath48 pairs .",
    "we denote the set of such pairs as @xmath49 .",
    "for example , a reported consumption of @xmath50 may represent a precise unrounded value [ @xmath51 or rounding across a range of nearby values [ @xmath52 . for subject @xmath3 , the probability of the observed @xmath47 at time @xmath4 is the sum of the probabilities of the @xmath53 pairs that would give rise to it .",
    "the density of reported consumption @xmath47 given the random effects can therefore be expressed as @xmath54      we estimate the model by a bayesian approach that employs importance sampling [ @xcite , @xcite ] to avoid iterative simulation of parameters .",
    "the steps are as follows : we first compute the posterior mode and information using a quasi - newton method with finite - difference derivatives [ @xcite ] .",
    "we then approximate the posterior with a multivariate @xmath55 density with mean equal to the posterior mode and dispersion equal to the inverse of the posterior information matrix at the mode .",
    "next , we draw a large number ( 4000 ) of samples from this proposal distribution , at each draw computing the importance ratio @xmath56 of the true posterior density to the proposal density .",
    "we then use sampling - importance resampling ( sir ) to improve the approximation of the posterior [ @xcite ] .",
    "we evaluate posterior moments by averaging functions of the simulated parameter draws with the importance ratios @xmath56 as weights .",
    "the choice of a @xmath4 with a small number of degrees of freedom as the importance density is intended to balance the convergence of the mc integrals and the efficiency of the simulation .    letting @xmath57 , the likelihood contribution from subject @xmath3 is @xmath58\\\\[-8pt ] & & \\hspace*{100pt}{}\\times f(b_i)f(u_i)\\ , db_i \\,du_i;\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] we approximate the integral in ( [ marginallik ] ) by gaussian quadrature . we choose proper but vague priors for the parameters , which we assume are a priori independent ( except for @xmath59 , as noted below ) .",
    "the parameter @xmath18 in the poisson mixed model  ( [ recall ] ) , representing the slope of the latent recall on the ema recorded consumption , is given a normal prior @xmath60 , whereas the priors of the other regression parameters in both model parts are set to @xmath61 subject to the constraint @xmath34 .",
    "we assign the random - effect variances inverse - gamma priors with mean and sd both equal to 1 , a reasonably vague specification [ @xcite ] .",
    "we obtain the posterior mode and information using sas proc nlmixed , and implement bayesian importance sampling in ` r ` .",
    "[ modelchecking ] with heaped data , the unavailability of simple graphical diagnostics such as residual plots complicates model evaluation .",
    "we therefore resort to examination of repeated draws of latent quantities from their posterior distributions , in the spirit of bayesian posterior predictive checks [ @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ] .",
    "specifically , we evaluate the adequacy of model assumptions using imputed values of the latent recall @xmath45 , which we compare to its implied marginal distribution under the model .",
    "imputations of latent @xmath62 and @xmath63 are ultimately based on the posterior density @xmath64 of the model parameter @xmath65 given the observed data @xmath66 .",
    "@xcite , sampling univariate @xmath67 values , used an acceptance - rejection procedure to draw quantities analogous to our @xmath45 and @xmath46 from a confined bivariate normal distribution . in our model , the correlation within @xmath62 and @xmath63 vectors poses a challenge to simulation .",
    "note , however , that given the subject - specific effects @xmath15 and @xmath37 , the components of @xmath62 and @xmath63 are independent .",
    "thus , we can readily simulate @xmath68 from the joint posterior of @xmath69 .",
    "for each simulated @xmath65 and the observed data @xmath66 , the posterior distribution of @xmath69 is @xmath70 because the values of @xmath71 and @xmath72 together determine @xmath47 , we have that @xmath73 where @xmath74 is an indicator function .",
    "accordingly , @xmath75 thus , given random effects @xmath15 and @xmath37 , the imputation of @xmath76 is obtained by independent draws of @xmath48 , @xmath77 , which can be implemented as an acceptance - rejection procedure .",
    "we therefore impute the data as follows :    make independent draws , @xmath78 from @xmath64 by sir .",
    "given @xmath79 , for @xmath80 , independently draw @xmath81 and @xmath82 .",
    "for @xmath80 , given @xmath79 and @xmath83 , for @xmath84 , draw @xmath85 as poisson with mean ( [ recall ] ) . then given @xmath79 , @xmath86 and @xmath85 ,",
    "draw misreporting type @xmath87 from ( [ misreport ] ) . if @xmath88 , discard @xmath89 and repeat this step until @xmath90 .    to assess model fit , we plot @xmath91 histograms of the imputed latent count  @xmath92 .",
    "implausible patterns in these histograms , such as peaks or troughs at multiples of 5 , suggest incorrect modeling of the heaping .",
    "we can also base discrepancy diagnostics specifically on the fractions of reported consumptions that are divisible by  5 .",
    "to examine the performance of our approach , we conducted simulations replicating the structure of the shiffman data with @xmath93 nonvisit - day observations per subject .",
    "each data set consisted of @xmath94 subjects , and for simplicity we do not consider baseline covariates",
    ". for each subject we first set @xmath95 as an observed ema count vector from the data and generated a random effect @xmath96 .",
    "we then generated @xmath13 values as independent poisson deviates with conditional mean ( [ recall ] ) . with @xmath97 , @xmath98 , when @xmath99 and ema count @xmath100 , the mean latent recall is 23.2 , and when @xmath101 it is  25.8 . with the random effect distributed as designated above , the marginal mean recalls for @xmath100 and @xmath101 are 24.3 and 27.0 , respectively .",
    "next we generated the latent heaping behavior indicator @xmath23 from ( [ misreport ] ) .",
    "we set the parameters to their estimates from the shiffman data : the intercepts @xmath102 , @xmath103 , @xmath104 were @xmath105 , @xmath106 and @xmath107 , respectively , and the slope @xmath108 was @xmath109 .",
    "we simulated the random effect @xmath110 . under this",
    "setting , when @xmath111 and @xmath112 , the probability of exact reporting is 28.3% , and the probabilities of rounding to the nearest multiples of 5 , 10 and 20 are 66.3% , 5.4% and 0.04% , respectively . when the latent count @xmath113 , these probabilities are 7.8% , 71.2% , 20.8% and 0.2% , respectively .",

    "in addition , baseline patient characteristics ftnd , ndss , race and gender have significant effects on the recall process .",
    "for fixed ema count , the following characteristics are associated with greater remembered smoking : higher nicotine dependence ( measured by both ftnd and ndss ) , white ethnicity ( compared to black ) and male sex .",
    "figure  [ expw ] displays the estimated curve of the mean of @xmath13 against the ema count .",
    "a natural hypothesis is that the estimated latent mean agrees with ema , which would be reflected in the poisson model by an estimated intercept of @xmath20 and slope of  @xmath185 ; one might call this a model of unbiased memory . to the contrary",
    ", figure  [ expw ] shows that the fitted mean curve diverges substantially from the @xmath186 line , with the lighter smokers on average overestimating their consumption and the heavier smokers underestimating consumption .",
    "the mean remembered consumption agrees with the true count roughly in the range 2226 cigarettes , or slightly more than a pack per day .    high school , addicted@xmath187definitely , race@xmath187white , sex@xmath187female , and mean values of the quantitative predictors : ftnd@xmath1875.97 , @xmath188 , age@xmath18743.5 , and ema noncompliance@xmath18710.1% . ]",
    "figure  [ heapprob ] shows the estimated heaping probability as a function of remembered cigarette consumption for visit and nonvisit days . the possibility of rounded - off reporting increases rapidly as the remembered count increases , although surprisingly the probability of rounding to the nearest 20 is not large for either type of day . when the perception of smoking is more than two packs , say , 41 cigarettes , the chance of heaped reporting rises to more than 84% , of which 37% is attributed to half - pack rounding .",
    "the results confirm that the degree of heaping is much smaller on visit days .",
    "for example , only 51% of subjects round off the visit - day count when reporting 41 cigarettes , and among those 39% round off to the nearest multiple of 5 .",
    "we have developed a model to describe the process whereby exact longitudinal measurements become distorted by retrospective recall .",
    "our approach uses latent processes to explain the data as a result of mis - remembering and rounding : a model of the latent exact value describes subject - level recall and allows for association over time and with baseline predictors , while a misreporting model describes the dependence of heaping coarseness on the latent value and other predictors .",
    "random effects represent individual propensities in recall and heaping ; in our data , inferences depend strongly on the inclusion of these random effects .",
    "the data suggest that both mis - remembering and heaping contribute substantially to the distortion of cigarette counts .",
    "the curve of mean remembered count as a function of ema count departs markedly from the @xmath186 line , with lighter smokers overstating consumption and heavier smokers understating consumption .",
    "the remembered smoking coincides with the accurate ema count at around 24  cigarettes , suggesting that the popularity of reporting one pack per day is partially a result of the general heaping behavior rather than a particular affinity for remembering a pack a day .",
    "the curves of heaping probabilities suggest that exact reporting is uncommon and practically disappears beyond about 40 cigarettes / day . nevertheless , it is interesting just how much of the misreporting is due to mis - remembering .",
    "the remembered cigarette consumption depends not only on true consumption , but also on the subject s sex , race and degree of nicotine dependence .",
    "the interpretation of our model components as representing memory and rounding depends on the assumption that ema data are exact .",
    "of course , even ema data are subject to errors , as smokers may neglect to record cigarettes both at the time of smoking and later .",
    "yet good correspondence with smoking biomarkers strongly supports the use of ema over tlfb as a proxy for the truth [ @xcite ] .",
    "we have implemented our model with a combination of standard numerical methods including gaussian quadrature , quasi - newton optimization and sampling - importance resampling .",
    "our experience suggests that with the model as specified , and incorporating a modest numbers of predictors , the method is robust and efficient .",
    "increasing the number of random effects would increase the time demands ( from the numerical integration ) and raise the possibility of numerical instability ( from possible errors in integration ) . for more extensive models , sophisticated approaches based on mcmc sampling",
    "would be necessary .",
    "our model allows for the inclusion of covariates to better explain the discrepancy between smokers self - perceived behaviors and reality .",
    "it also provides a basis for predicting true counts ( effectively the ema data ) from reported tlfb counts .",
    "this would be a valuable activity in the large number of studies that do not collect ema data . to predict true counts from the recalled counts , we first need to estimate the parameters @xmath65 in the model using a subset of the primary study or an external independent study that collects both tlfb count @xmath189 and accurate ema count @xmath190 .",
    "then we can impute the true count together with the latent remembered count and heaped reporting behavior . specifically , the posterior distribution of @xmath191 is @xmath192 where @xmath193 is the density function of the true count .",
    "imputation follows similar steps as described in section  [ modelchecking ] with @xmath65 set equal to the maximum likelihood estimates .",
    "the methods developed here also can have application in a wide variety of settings in social and medical science involving self - reported data  for example , assessing sexual risk behavior , trial drug consumption , eating episodes and financial expenditures .",
    "we are grateful to two associate editors and a referee , whose perceptive comments and suggestions greatly improved the paper ."
