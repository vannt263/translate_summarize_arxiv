    "a new higher order gravity model , which claims power - counting renormalizability and it serves as a uv completion of general relativity , has been formulated recently by horava  @xcite .",
    "this scenario is based on an anisotropy between space and time coordinates , which is expressed via the scalings @xmath4 and @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is a dynamical critical exponent .",
    "note , that in the horava - lifshitz ( hl ) gravity the four - dimensional diffeomorphism invariance of general relativity is sacrificed in order to achieve power - counting renormalizability .",
    "it is worth noting that hl gravity has stimulated an extended research on cosmology and black hole solutions @xcite-@xcite .",
    "in addition to general relativity studies , quantum field theory models in flat anisotropic space - time have also been considered @xcite-@xcite .",
    "as it has already been mentioned , the hl gravity violates local lorentz invariance in the uv , however it is expected that general relativity is recovered in the ir limit .",
    "this implies a very special renormalization group flow for the couplings of the model , but there is no theoretical study supporting this specific behavior . in addition",
    ", there are several other possible inconsistencies in hl gravity which have been discussed ( see for example @xcite-@xcite and references therein ) . in particular , the absence of full diffeomorphism invariance introduces an additional scalar mode which may lead to strong coupling problems or instabilities , and in this way it prevents hl gravity to fully reproduce general relativity in the ir limit .",
    "however , these problems will not be addressed in the present paper .    for the construction of the hl action",
    ", there has been proposed @xcite the so called `` detailed balance principle '' .",
    "the main advantage of this approach is the restriction of the large number of arbitrary couplings that appear in the action of the model .",
    "however , a more general way for constructing the action would be to include all possible operators which are compatible with the renormalizability @xcite ; this implies that all operators with dimension less or equal to six are allowed .    before proceeding",
    "it is important to mention that the hl gravity can be separated into two versions which are known as projectable and non - projectable . in the projectable version",
    "the lapse function @xmath7 ( see eq .",
    "( [ adm ] ) below ) depends only on the time coordinate , while in the non  projectable version @xmath7 is a function of both the space and time coordinates .    in this paper",
    "we study spherically symmetric solutions for non - projectable horava - lifshitz gravity , in the case of an action without detailed balance , that includes all possible terms which are quadratic and cubic in curvature . for special choices of the free parameters of the model , we obtain two analytical solutions which exhibit the standard schwarzschild black hole asymptotic behavior in the large distance limit .",
    "the effect of the cubic terms in the short range behavior of the black hole solutions is discussed .",
    "one should refer to some previous works towards this direction . in the case of actions with detailed balance ,",
    "spherically symmetric solutions were found @xcite , but they had an unconventional large distance asymptotic behaviour .",
    "the correct schwarzchild - flat asymptotic behaviour can be recovered if the detailed balance action is modified in the ir by a term proportional to the ricci scalar , and the cosmological constant term is set to zero @xcite .",
    "a similar study , in the case of a non - vanishing cosmological constant , has also been carried out @xcite .",
    "a generalization to topological black holes has been obtained in @xcite .",
    "in addition , a systematic study of static spherically symmetric solutions of hl gravity ( for an action which includes only the quadratic terms in curvature ) has been presented in @xcite where the most general spherically symmetric solution for general coupling parameters was obtained .",
    "finally , a general study of black hole solutions in the case of 5d horava - lifshitz gravity , with quadratic terms in curvature , is presented in ref .",
    "note that in this work we consider for the first time the issue of spherically symmetric solutions for an action including terms cubic in curvature .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "2 we write down the most general action for hl gravity . in sec .",
    "3 we derive the equations of motion . in sec .",
    "4 we present the two static spherically symmetric solutions and finally sec . 5 contains our conclusions . in appendix [ appa ]",
    "we show that the above mentioned two solutions , when the cubic terms are absent , coincide with solutions which are already known in the literature .",
    "finally , in appendix [ appb ] we give a brief presentation of detail balance condition , and we discuss it in connection with the results of appendix [ appa1 ] .",
    "in this section we introduce the notation for the so - called horava gravity models in the case of three spatial dimensions ( @xmath8 ) .",

    "we emphasize that the main motivation for considering models of this type is the construction of a power - counting renormalizable gravity model .",
    "however , in order to achieve renormalizibility , and simultaneously keep the time derivatives up to second order , we have to sacrifice the standard 4d diffeomorphism invariance of general relativity , which is now restricted to the transformation [ diffeo ] ^i=(x^j , t ) ,   = ( t )  . the kinetic part in the above lagrangian of eq .",
