    "the detection of gravitational waves will have many implications in physics and astrophysics .",
    "besides the confirmation of the general relativity theory , it will allow the investigation of several astrophysical phenomena , such as the existence of black holes and the mass and abundance of neutron stars , thus allowing new scientific frontiers .",
    "joseph weber was the first one to propose feasible gravitational wave detectors in the 1960s@xcite .",
    "the antenna he proposed had a cylindrical shape , operated at room temperature and was acoustically isolated . since his pioneering work",
    "the detectors based on resonant - mass antennas have improved significantly . for the latest generation of such detectors , the antenna has a spherical shape .",
    "the transducer distribution on spherical detectors follows the truncated icosahedron configuration , proposed by johnson and merkowitz in 1993@xcite and justified formally by magalhes et al . in 1997@xcite .",
    "spherical antennas have omnidirectional sensitivity and all observables needed for gravitational astronomy can be obtained from only one spherical detector appropriately equipped with six transducers@xcite .",
    "when fully operational , such detector will be able not only to acknowledge the presence of a gravitational wave within its bandwidth : it will be able to inform the direction of a source in the sky as well as the amplitudes of the wave s polarization components .",
    "this is the case of schenberg , the second spherical detector ever built in the world and the first equipped with a set of parametric transducers , which is installed at the physics institute of the university of sao paulo ( at sao paulo city , brazil ) .",
    "it has undergone its first test run in september 8 , 2006 , with three transducers operational .",
    "recent information on the present status of this detector can be found in reference @xcite .",
    "there are mathematical models for this detector for the case that all six transducers are operational .",
    "such models investigated two situations : one in which the transducers are perfectly uncoupled@xcite and another in which the transducers are somehow coupled to each other@xcite . in both cases it is possible to solve the inverse problem and retrieve the four astrophysical parameters of interest : the angles that determine the source s position in the sky , denoted by @xmath0 ( zenith angle ) and @xmath1 ( azimuthal angle ) , and the amplitudes of the two polarization states as functions of time , @xmath2 and @xmath3 .    in this work we present a methodology for the solution of the inverse problem in spherical detectors , which we named  the method of independent bars \" .",
    "unlike the previous methods , it allows the determination of astrophysical parameters using less than six transducers .",
    "in fact , we will show that it generalizes a previous approach , known as the mode channels method .",
    "we tested our method with simulations and found encouraging results . in the next sections we will show these results in detail",
    "the determination of directions is sky demands the use of appropriate reference frames .",
    "for this reason we shall define two frames : the first one is the _ laboratory system _ with axes defined by the unit vectors @xmath4 .",
    "the second frame is the _ gravitational wave system _ , which will have its axes defined by @xmath5 with the wave travelling in the @xmath6 direction and the axes of the polarization amplitudes being @xmath7 .",
    "the projection of the polarization state amplitudes of the gravitational signal on the shaft of a detector can be expressed by the contraction of two symmetric , trace - free tensors@xcite : @xmath8 the response amplitude of one transducer coupled to the spherical detector is given by @xmath9 , while @xmath10 is the spatial part of the gravitational wave tensor and @xmath11 is the transducer s tensor , which informs the orientation of the transducer on the spherical detector .    in appendix [ appen2 ]",
    "we show that the contraction in equation ( [ eq1 ] ) is a representation of the time - dependent scalar potential given by@xcite : @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the antenna s mass density and @xmath14 is a coordinate location .",
    "it is possible to model the system as if we had one independent bar behind each transducer on the detector@xcite .",
    "such a bar detector , whose axis is in the @xmath15 direction , can be characterized by the symmetric tensor @xmath16    the transducers are located on the antenna and the position of the @xmath17 transducer is described by the unit vector @xmath18 . in the laboratory system ( lab frame ) this vector is given by @xmath19 where @xmath20 and @xmath21 are angles that locate the transducer on the spherical detector . using equations ( [ eq2 ] ) and ( [ n ] ) the @xmath17 transducer s tensor assume the following form in the lab frame : @xmath22      consider the complex null vector @xmath23 defined by @xcite : @xmath24 where @xmath25 and @xmath26 are unit vectors in the wave frame .",
    "the gravitational wave tensor @xmath27 can be written in terms of these vectors : @xmath28 or @xmath29 where @xmath30    starting from the lab frame @xmath31 it is possible to rotate by @xmath1 around @xmath32 to obtain @xmath33 and rotate by @xmath0 around @xmath34 ( euler @xmath35-convention ) to obtain @xmath36 so that @xmath37 points in the direction of the propagation of the wave @xmath38 .    in the lab frame",
    "the vector @xmath23 thus takes the following form : @xmath39,\\ ] ] where @xmath0 , @xmath1 are the zenithal and azimuthal angles , respectively , that define the direction of arrival of the gravitational signal .    we have determined the expressions for the wave s and the detector s tensors relative to the laboratory system .",
    "we can now solve the inverse problem .",
    "equation ( [ eq1 ] ) , valid for one transducer , can be expanded as @xcite @xmath40 = r^l.\\ ] ]    in the case that we have six operating transducers , using the six independent components of the spatial part of the gravitational waves tensor , the @xmath41 can be obtained as the solutions of the system of equations @xmath42",
    "= 2\\left [ \\begin{array}{c } r^1 \\cr r^2 \\cr r^3 \\cr r^4 \\cr r^5 \\cr r^6 \\end{array } \\right ] .",
    "\\label{sixt}\\ ] ] this system allow us to calculate the components of the wave s tensor and to check the transversality and tracelessness of the wave tensor , which will be present if gr is the correct theory of gravitation .",
    "on the other hand , in the case the detector is coupled to a set of only five transducers ( @xmath43 ) , the last line will be absent .",
    "so in its place we use the trace - free condition @xcite : @xmath44    when only four transducers are operational it is still possible to solve the system of equations by adding to it the transversality condition of the gravitational wave .",
    "this condition implies that the spatial part of the gravitational wave tensor is orthogonal to the direction of propagation , i.e. , @xmath45 .",
    "in other words , the matrix @xmath41 has one eigenvalue equal to zero and , as a consequence , null determinant .",
    "we then use the condition of null determinant , given by @xmath46 instead of the line that is missing in the system of equations ( [ sixt ] ) .",
    "since we take general relativity for granted the @xmath47 matrix , without noise , must be  tt \" : transverse , equation ( [ transv ] ) , and trace free , equation ( [ tracefree ] ) . in this case",
    "any set of 6 @xmath48 , obtained as described above , should obey such condition .",
    "the presence of noise is expected to make the @xmath48 vary so that the transversality and tracelessness of @xmath27 is not perfect . of course",
    ", if the noise is too high it will be difficult to identify the `` tt '' properties in the @xmath27 matrix .",
    "our ability to extract the signal from the noise will depend on the signal - to - noise ratio achieved for the particular event .",
    "this has been investigated by merkowitz @xcite and merkowitz , lobo and serrano @xcite , partly using an approach first presented in magalhaes et al .",
    "@xcite . in the present work",
    "we will not approach this issue in depth , which will be left to be discussed elsewhere .",
    "with the @xmath49 obtained from the the system of equations ( [ sixt ] ) is possible to calculate all the relevant parameters of the gravitational wave : the angles @xmath0 and @xmath1 that indicate the direction of the wave and the amplitudes of the two polarization states of the wave as functions of time @xmath2 and @xmath3 .      for a gravitational wave that propagates in the direction of the @xmath50 axis of its proper system of coordinates , in the case of general relativity",
    "the transversality condition relation holds : @xcite @xmath51    the wave frame can be written in terms of the laboratory frame through a rotation .",
    "following the @xmath35-convention for the euler angles , @xmath38 assumes the form : @xmath52 substituting equation ( [ eq8 ] ) in ( [ eq7 ] ) and using the symmetry of @xmath41 we obtain the following system of equations    @xmath53    since @xmath54 , in this system the equations are linearly dependent .",
    "two of them are used to obtain @xmath0 and @xmath1 : @xmath55    @xmath56    these two solutions for @xmath0 are related to the two diametrically opposed positions in the sky from which the gravitational wave can arrive .    with the above equations we compute the direction of the incoming wave .",
    "it results in the same value for each time sample , in the case of a pure ( noiseless ) signal . in the case of a noisy signal ,",
    "a distribution around the mean values of the @xmath0 and @xmath1 angles is found , as we can see from figures [ result2 ] and [ result3 ] .      using the fact that @xmath57 , @xmath58 and @xmath59 we obtain @xmath60 and @xmath61 with the aid of equation ( [ eqwave2 ] ) , yielding @xmath62    once these amplitudes are known other quantities can be calculated .",
    "one of them is the polarization angle , @xmath63 , through the relation @xmath64 however , this parameter is actually not relevant for gravitational wave detection purposes since it is just an arbitrary angle between the wave x axis and an axis where the wave has only the instantaneous plus polarization , @xmath60 .",
    "on the other hand , important information can be obtained from the difference between the polarization phases .",
    "this can be determined if we analyze the time evolution of the instantaneous polarizations registered in each sample ( the polarizations are time dependent ) .",
    "our ability to determine this phase difference depends on the signal to noise ratio for each particular event sampled .",
    "such time varying analysis is beyond the scope of the present work .",
    "with the objective of testing the efficiency of the method we produced simulated data of the schenberg detector . for the waveform we chose a template from the laboratory for high energy astrophysics ( lhea ) of the nasa / gfsc@xcite , one of the three waveforms used by duez and collaborators @xcite and depicted in figure [ duez ] .",
    "this signal was introduced in a simulator of schenberg@xcite , that returns the response of the six two - mode transducers positioned on the detector their positions obeying the truncated icosahedral configuration@xcite .",
    "the simulation of the detector is possible because its mathematical model is known as well as the mathematical models of its noise sources @xcite .",
    "table [ angulosit ] shows the angles relative to the position of each transducer on the spherical detector .",
    "we simulated the transducers responses when detector was excited by a wave of the kind shown in figure [ duez ] arriving at the detector in the direction defined by @xmath65 and @xmath66 .",
    ".the angle @xmath20 is the one that a line l , that passes through the center of a pentagonal face and the origin of the lab frame , makes with the local zenith and @xmath21 is the angle that l makes with the @xmath67 axis of the lab frame . [",
    "cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ results ]    the values presented in this table were obtained simulating the wave s incidence 50 times and then calculating the average and the standard deviation of the results .",
    "we have verified the efficiency of the method of independent bars in determining a source s direction .",
    "another important result is to show the equivalence between the method of independent bars and mode channels model @xcite .",
    "this will be done in the next section .",
    "in order to show the equivalence between the mathod of independent bars and mode channels model , we must write the transducer s tensor ( eqs . [ eq2 ] and [ eq3 ] ) in its trace - free form : @xmath68 where the term @xmath69 ensures the property of tracelessness of the tensor .    each component of the matrix @xmath70 ( eq . [ sixt ] ) is a function of the angles @xmath20 and @xmath21 that informs the position of each transducer .",
    "when we impose the trace - free condition on the tensor @xmath11 , all this functions can be written as a combination of real spherical harmonics of second order .",
    "therefore the matricial system can be written as @xmath71 = \\frac{1}{2}\\sqrt{\\frac{16 \\pi}{15 } } \\begin{bmatrix } y_{1}^1 & y_{2}^1 & y_{3}^1 & y_{4}^1 & y_{5}^1 \\cr y_{1}^2 & y_{2}^2 & y_{3}^2 & y_{4}^2 & y_{5}^2 \\cr y_{1}^3 & y_{2}^3 & y_{2}^3 & y_{4}^3 & y_{5}^3 \\cr y_{1}^4 & y_{2}^4 & y_{3}^4 & y_{4}^4 & y_{5}^4 \\cr y_{1}^5 & y_{2}^5 & y_{3}^5 & y_{4}^5 & y_{5}^5 \\cr y_{1}^6 & y_{2}^6 & y_{3}^6 & y_{4}^6 & y_{5}^6 \\cr \\end{bmatrix } \\left [ \\begin{array}{c } h_{1}\\cr h_{2 } \\cr h_{3 } \\cr h_{4 } \\cr h_{5 } \\cr \\end{array } \\right],\\ ] ] where @xmath72 are the quadrupolar representation of the gravitational waves . in appendix [ appen1 ]",
    "we shown the details of this calculation .",
    "when the transducer are positioned according to the truncated icosahedral configuration the matrix of the real spherical harmonics @xmath73 is the transpose of the model matrix @xmath74 proposed by merkowitz and johnson@xcite . in compact notation equation ( [ solproinv3 ] ) can be written as @xmath75 using a property of the model matrix@xcite : @xmath76 we obtain : @xmath77 or , in explicit form : @xmath78 = \\sqrt{\\frac{5\\pi}{3 } } \\begin{bmatrix } y_{1}^1 & y_{1}^2 & y_{1}^3 & y_{1}^4 & y_{1}^5 & y_{1}^6 \\cr y_{2}^1 & y_{2}^2 & y_{2}^3 & y_{2}^4 & y_{2}^5 & y_{2}^6 \\cr y_{3}^1 & y_{3}^2 & y_{3}^3 & y_{3}^4 & y_{3}^5 & y_{3}^6 \\cr y_{4}^1 & y_{4}^2 & y_{4}^3 & y_{4}^4 & y_{4}^5 & y_{4}^6 \\cr y_{5}^1 & y_{5}^2 & y_{5}^3 & y_{5}^4 & y_{5}^5 & y_{5}^6 \\cr \\end{bmatrix } \\left [ \\begin{array}{c } r^1 \\cr r^2 \\cr r^3 \\cr r^4 \\cr r^5 \\cr r^6 \\end{array } \\right].\\ ] ]    this result , obtained with the independent bars method , coincides with the one found with the mode channels model .",
    "therefore , if the transducers are in a truncated icosahedron configuration the two models are equivalent .",
    "on the other hand , it is worth stressing that even if the transducers are not in this special configuration the inverse problem can be solved using the independent bars model .",
    "the main objective of this work was to show the details of the analytical construction of the method of independent bars and its efficiency in the determination of the relevant parameters of gravitational waves detected by spherical detector , namely : the two angles that determine the source s position in the sky and the amplitudes of the two polarization states as functions of time .",
    "as can be seen from the results , the method of independent bars is efficient for the solution of the inverse problem .",
    "first we tested the method in the noiseless case and we verified that it does not present intrinsic errors , being thus an exact method .",
    "then we tested the method adding gaussian noise to the data , as can be seen in figures [ result2 ] and [ result3 ] .",
    "a major advantage of the method of independent bars is its generality , since it does not depend on the specific transducers configuration .",
    "the fact that @xmath79 is a square matrix facilitates the inversion of the system s equation , the only requirement being that the matrix is non - singular .",
    "therefore , the usefulness of this method is evident .",
    "for instance , in the absence of any transducer coupled to the spherical detector the mode channels model@xcite does not work .",
    "this happens because the truncated icosahedron configuration is lost .",
    "however , the independent bars method still works under this condition . we are currently investigating ways to solve the inverse problem with three transducers .",
    "we have already got some preliminary results that will appear in a future paper .    in this work",
    "we have actually shown that the method of the independent bars is a generalization of the mode channels model .",
    "the matrix @xmath79 can be written in terms of the real spherical harmonics . in this case , if the transducers positions obey the truncated icosahedron configuration we verified that @xmath79 is the model matrix @xmath80 multiplied by a constant .    finally , we point out that this method can be used for the solution of the inverse problem in a network of bar antennas , as long as a common reference frame is chosen and time delays are accounted for .",

    "each component of the matrix ( [ sixt ] ) is a function of the angles @xmath81 and @xmath82 that inform the position of each transducer .",
    "the @xmath83 functions can be written as combinations of the real spherical harmonics as follows :          equation ( [ eq4 ] ) can be written in terms of the real spherical harmonics : @xmath88,\\]]in a more compact form this reads @xmath89 where the @xmath72 are the quadrupolar representation of the gravitational wave : @xmath90 therefore the matricial system of the equation ( [ eq4 ] ) takes the form : @xmath91 = \\frac{1}{2}\\sqrt{\\frac{16 \\pi}{15 } } \\begin{bmatrix } y_{1}^1 & y_{2}^1 & y_{3}^1 & y_{4}^1 & y_{5}^1 \\cr y_{1}^2 & y_{2}^2 & y_{3}^2 & y_{4}^2 & y_{5}^2 \\cr y_{1}^3 & y_{2}^3 & y_{2}^3 & y_{4}^3 & y_{5}^3 \\cr y_{1}^4 & y_{2}^4 & y_{3}^4 & y_{4}^4 & y_{5}^4 \\cr y_{1}^5 & y_{2}^5 & y_{3}^5 & y_{4}^5 & y_{5}^5 \\cr y_{1}^6 & y_{2}^6 & y_{3}^6 & y_{4}^6 & y_{5}^6 \\cr \\end{bmatrix } \\left [ \\begin{array}{c } h_{1}\\cr h_{2 } \\cr h_{3 } \\cr h_{4 } \\cr h_{5 } \\cr \\end{array } \\right],\\ ] ] which is the same used as equation ( [ solproinv3 ] ) .",
    "we want to show in this appendix that equation ( [ potential ] ) can be written in terms of the transducer s response .",
    "first we notice that the potential of the tidal force density caused for the passage of a gravitational wave is @xmath92 where @xmath13 is the mass density and @xmath14 is the coordinate location .",
    "the term @xmath14 represents a vector for the position so it can be written of the following form : @xmath93 where @xmath94 is the amplitude of the vector and @xmath95 is represent the unit vector of the position vector . replacing @xmath14 in the equation we get @xmath96 which can be written in the form @xmath97",
    "we have then the contraction of two tensors : the wave s tensor @xmath41 and a directionality tensor that characterizes the plan in which the states of polarization of the gravitational wave act . we can impose the traceless condition in @xmath98 adding the term @xmath99 .",
    "therefore the equation assumes the form : @xmath100 where the term @xmath101 is the transducer s tensor of the equation ( [ eq2 ] ) .",
    "therefore we can write @xmath102 or in a more summarized form : @xmath103 where @xmath104 is the transducer s response of the equation ( [ eq1 ] ) .",
    "using this equation we can write : @xmath105"
