    "in refs .  @xcite a complete set of @xmath3-order contributions has been evaluated for the fundamental transitions of the hydrogen molecular ions h@xmath5 and hd@xmath6 as well as for two - photon transitions of antiprotonic helium .",
    "all calculations at this order were performed in the nonrecoil limit , by evaluating the one - electron qed corrections in the two - center approximation .",
    "the only exception is the uehling potential vacuum polarization contribution , which was computed with a lower level of accuracy . following the notations of ref .",
    "@xcite , eq.(46 ) , the uehling correction at @xmath3 order for a two - center system can be written as @xmath7     \\left\\langle v_{\\delta } \\right\\rangle,\\ ] ] where @xmath8 is the internuclear distance , and @xmath9.\\ ] ] the @xmath10 coefficient is known analytically , while the nonlogarithmic term was calculated in  @xcite in the linear combination of atomic orbitals ( lcao ) approximation using the hydrogen atom ground state value of @xmath11 . in this work we present a complete account of the vacuum polarization contribution in the two coulomb center approximation .",
    "we utilize the formalism of nonrelativistic quantum electrodynamics ( nrqed ) , a similar approach has been used in @xcite ( see sec .",
    "ii.b of that paper ) for pionic hydrogen .",
    "we start from the nonrelativistic wave function and then obtain contributions due to the relativistic corrections to the electron wave function and modification of the coulomb vertex function .",
    "this approach is first illustrated by calculating the uehling potential energy shift for @xmath12-states of the hydrogen atom in sec .",
    "i.    sec .",
    "ii extends the formalism to the two - center case , and the @xmath13 function is calculated .",
    "more precisely , the calculated terms also include all contributions of higher order in @xmath14 generated by the uehling potential and leading relativistic corrections .",
    "final results for the fundamental transitions in the h@xmath5 and hd@xmath6 ions are presented and discussed in sec .",
    "we use atomic units throughout .",
    "in the nrqed formalism , the zero - order approximation is the nonrelativistic ( schrdinger ) wave function @xmath15 with pauli spinors , defined by @xmath16 for higher - order terms the rayleigh - schrdinger perturbation theory is used .",
    "if one wants to evaluate the one - loop vacuum polarization contribution to the bound electron in the external coulomb field to the required @xmath3 order , one needs to evaluate the first - order contribution , which is the uehling potential @xmath17 ( fig .",
    "1a ) . next is the leading - order relativistic correction to the wave function of the electron ( fig .",
    "1b ) , which produces a second - order contribution with the breit - pauli hamiltonian : @xmath18 as the perturbation .",
    "the last term is the vertex function modification ( fig .",
    "the only contribution at this order to the vertex with the coulomb photon interaction is the darwin term , see fig .  3 in @xcite or eq .  ( 7 ) of @xcite .    in atomic units",
    "the uehling potential is expressed : @xmath19 evaluation of the first - order correction with the nonrelativistic wave functions of the hydrogen @xmath12-states is straightforward and results in the following expression : @xmath20\\ ] ]    [ cols=\"^,^,^ \" , ]     results are shown in fig .",
    "[ vp_pot ] .",
    "as can be seen , the values of @xmath21 at @xmath22 tend to infinity and do not obey the continuity relationship that could be expected , @xmath23 where h@xmath24(1s ) denotes the 1s state of a hydrogenic atom with nuclear charge @xmath25 .",
    "the reason for such a behavior is that the coefficients of the @xmath26 expansion have no physical meaning , and only the sum over all orders matters .",
    "only the complete uehling potential contribution indeed is a continuous function of @xmath8 at the united atom limit .",
    "the same observation is also valid for the one - loop self energy contribution  @xcite , as well as for higher - order diagrams .    on the contrary ,",
    "continuity is observed at the other limit , @xmath27 .",
    "we checked this by direct numerical evaluation of the expressions  ( [ e7a ] ) , ( [ e7b ] ) and ( [ e7c ] ) with 1s hydrogenic wavefunctions .",
    "the values of @xmath21 at large @xmath8 converge towards @xmath28 in the hydrogen molecular ion case , and towards @xmath29 in the antiprotonic helium case .",
    "the last step is numerical integration of the vacuum polarization  effective  potentials of fig .  [ vp_pot ] over vibrational or heavy particle degrees of freedom to get the energy corrections for individual states .",
    "numerical results for the ground states of h@xmath5 and hd@xmath6 and for the fundamental transitions : @xmath4 , are collected in table  [ vp_tab ] .",
    "comparison with the lcao approximation demonstrates that in case of individual states it may give some reasonable estimate .",
    "however , for the transition frequency , due to the slope of the  effective  potential at the equilibrium position at @xmath30 , the difference in contributions from the two states becomes substantially sensitive and the lcao estimate only gives an order of magnitude .",
    "this tendency is less marked in the case of antiprotonic helium , e.g. for the two - photon @xmath31 transition in @xmath32he@xmath33 we obtain a shift of 121 khz , while the lcao estimate is 98 khz .",
    "that may be explained as follows : the dominating contribution comes from the @xmath34 state wave function of hydrogenlike helium ( @xmath35 ) , and the contribution from the antiproton is negligible .",
    "however , it is worth noting that for the antiprotonic helium , nonadiabatic effects become essential at this level , and complete three - body calculations are needed to get improved accuracy .    in conclusion",
    ", we have calculated the uehling corrections at orders @xmath3 and @xmath36 for the two - center problem .",
    "together with improved numerical calculations of the relativistic bethe logarithm  @xcite , these results will allow for further improvement of the theoretical accuracy on transition frequencies in h@xmath5 , hd@xmath6 and antiprotonic helium .",
