    "<S> quantum systems can provide outstanding performance in various sensing applications , ranging from bioscience to nanotechnology . </S>",
    "<S> atomic - scale defects in silicon carbide are very attractive in this respect because of the technological advantages of this material and favorable optical and radio frequency spectral ranges to control these defects . </S>",
    "<S> we identified several , separately addressable spin-3/2 centers in the same silicon carbide crystal , which are immune to nonaxial strain fluctuations . </S>",
    "<S> some of them are characterized by nearly temperature independent axial crystal fields , making these centers very attractive for vector magnetometry . </S>",
    "<S> contrarily , the zero - field splitting of another center exhibits a giant thermal shift of @xmath0 at room temperature , which can be used for thermometry applications . </S>",
    "<S> we also discuss a synchronized composite clock exploiting spin centers with different thermal response .    </S>",
    "<S> nanoscale magnetic field and temperature sensing based on quantum properties of the nitrogen - vacancy ( nv ) defect in diamond @xcite has been proposed @xcite and demonstrated at ambient conditions @xcite . this sensing technique can potentially allow for monitoring neuron activity @xcite , imaging of single proton spins in complex molecular systems @xcite and measuring the heat produced by chemical reactions inside living cells @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the principle of sensing is based on the optical readout of the spin resonance frequency subject to the crystal field @xmath1 and magnetic field @xmath2 .    </S>",
    "<S> these successful experiments stimulated the search for other solid - state systems with similar properties . </S>",
    "<S> atomic - scale defects in silicon carbide ( sic ) are attractive in this respect because they have complementary abilities to the nv defect in diamond . </S>",
    "<S> apart from the obvious technological opportunities due to the well - developed device fabrication protocols in sic , ( i ) these defects are optically active in the near infrared , characterised by a deep tissue penetration ; and ( ii ) they can be controlled by a radio frequency ( rf ) field in the mhz spectral range , used in standard magnetic resonance imaging systems . because about 250 sic polytypes are known , there should exist more than thousand different spin defects in sic with distinct characteristics @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> one can select a defect with the most suitable properties for a concrete task , which is not possible for one universal sensor .    here , we identify separately addressable spin centers within the primary intrinsic defects in 6h - sic and 4h - sic . </S>",
    "<S> some of these half - integer spin ( @xmath3 ) centers are insensitive to nonaxial strain as a consequence of the kramers degeneracy theorem and reveal within our accuracy temperature independent crystal field . thermal / strain fluctuations </S>",
    "<S> may limit the magnetometry performance . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , thermal fluctuations lead to fluctuations of the spin resonance frequency because @xmath1 is generally a function of temperature @xmath4 . the nv defect demonstrates the thermal shift of the spin resonance frequency @xmath5 @xcite , and temperature fluctuations of @xmath6 results in a magnetic field uncertainty of a few @xmath7 . by stabilizing temperature and using advanced measurement protocols in a bias magnetic field </S>",
    "<S> , this uncertainty can be significantly reduced @xcite , while in case of sic this is already the intrinsic property .    on the other hand , </S>",
    "<S> a large thermal shift is necessary for temperature sensing . </S>",
    "<S> we also identify spin-3/2 centers , demonstrating giant thermal shifts up to @xmath8 at ambient conditions . </S>",
    "<S> this is 14 times larger than that for the nv defect and hence can potentially be used to enhance the thermometry sensitivity . </S>"
