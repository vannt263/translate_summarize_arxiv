    "while our knowledge about the universe has improved over the last decades with the advent of new observational data , there are several dark sides of the universe that have not been so far described from a fundamental point of view : what caused the initial inflationary era of the universe ? what is the origin of dark matter ? what is the fundamental cause of the current acceleration of the universe ? even though nowadays none of the previous issues have a satisfactory answer , a parallel approach , that can shed some light on the dark sides of the universe , is a phenomenological one or a model building strategy .",
    "a good example in this regard is the inflationary paradigm @xcite , where an inflaton field ( or several scalar fields ) induce the initial acceleration of the universe .",
    "such a field would leave tracks on the evolution of the universe for example through the primordial power spectrum of the scalar perturbations @xcite , extremely useful to constrain the inflaton field .",
    "it is precisely such an approach that we will follow in this paper .",
    "the main goal of this paper is to obtain a phenomenologically consistent model for the early universe ( inflationary and radiation dominated epochs ) by properly modifying the generalised chaplygin gas ( gcg ) @xcite .",
    "a first attempt in this direction has been recently carried out in @xcite ( see also @xcite ) where a new scenario for the early universe was proposed .",
    "such a scenario provides a smooth transition between an early de sitter - like phase and a subsequent radiation dominated era . in that model",
    "@xcite , the matter content was given by a type of generalized chaplygin gas for the early universe , with an underlying scalar field description .",
    "here , we give a more _ realistic _ model where the early inflationary phase of the universe is more general than a de sitter - like universe .",
    "we will show how the spectrum of the present model is not as red as the one presented in @xcite and therefore more consistent with observations .",
    "more precisely , rather than having a de sitter - like phase in the past , we will consider an early `` quintessence '' inflationary phase .",
    "this phase will be connected to a radiation dominated phase at later time .",
    "the model can be described through a scalar field or a chaplygin gas inspired model .",
    "we will then analyze the possible imprints of such a gas in the primordial power spectrum of scalar perturbations and the power spectrum of the stochastic background of gravitational waves .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii , we will present the model which is based on a properly modified chaplygin gas that interpolates between a quintessence inflationary era and a radiation dominated period . in section iii , we will show how this kind of gas can be modeled by a minimally coupled scalar field . in section iv",
    ", we constrain our model observationally and obtain the full spectrum of scalar perturbations numerically . in section",
    "v , we obtain the spectrum of gravitational waves using the method of bogoliubov coefficient .",
    "finally , in section vi we summarize our results and conclude .",
    "we generalize the model presented in @xcite by considering an inflationary period corresponding to a `` quintessence '' like behavior ( described by a power law expansion ) and followed by a radiation dominated epoch .",
    "the matter content of the universe can then be modeled _  la _ chaplygin gas as @xmath0 where @xmath1 are constants being @xmath2 positive .",
    "the matter content is not interacting with any other fluid and therefore its energy density is conserved : @xmath3 where the dot stands for derivative with respect to the cosmic time and @xmath4 is the pressure of the fluid .",
    "if we substitute the energy density ( [ rho ] ) in the conservation equation ( [ conservation ] ) , we obtain @xmath5 the above equation of state can be rewritten as @xmath6 this equation shows clearly that we recover the model discussed by one of us in @xcite for @xmath7 .",
    "we would like to highlight that the equations of state ( [ p])-([p2 ] ) have been previously analyzed in @xcite to study a possible interplay between dark matter and dark energy and therefore in a scenario completely different to the one we study here .",
    "as the inflationary period takes place before the radiation dominated one , we deduce that the inequality @xmath8 must hold at early time ; i.e. at small scale factors",
    ". this will be the case as long as @xmath9 the inequality ( [ inequality1 ] ) implies @xmath10 , where @xmath11}.\\ ] ] the scale factor @xmath12 represents the `` border line '' between two different regimes .",
    "more precisely @xmath13    there are two more conditions that should be imposed on @xmath14 and @xmath15 to have a model that interpolates between an early inflationary phase of the type of quintessence and a radiation dominated phase at later time : ( i ) the energy density ( [ rhoinf ] ) must induce a period of inflation and ( ii ) such a period of inflation should not induce a super - inflationary expansion ; i.e. @xmath16 , and therefore a super - accelerating phase of the universe where the energy density ( [ rhoinf ] ) corresponds to phantom matter , with an energy density that grows as the universe expands . by combining these two ansatz with the inequality ( [ inequality2 ] )",
    ", we can easily deduce that the set of allowed values of @xmath14 and @xmath15 satisfy is not that surprising ( see for example @xcite ) .",

    "@xmath17    a perfect fluid with an equation of state ( [ p ] ) or ( [ p2 ] ) describe an early inflationary period as long as the conditions ( [ conditions ] ) are satisfied .",
    "the universe will exit the inflationary epoch when the scale factor reaches the value @xmath18^{1/[1+\\beta-4(1+\\alpha)]}.\\ ] ] the last condition can be obtained by imposing the condition @xmath19 .",
    "again this is in agreement with the results of @xcite for @xmath7 .    before concluding this section ,",
    "let us analyze more closely what sort of inflation does the universe undergo in its initial stages .",
    "the friedmann equation with the matter content ( [ rho ] ) is too difficult to be integrated analytically so we use an approximation where the energy density can be written as in eq .",

    "it shows that for large frequencies the larger @xmath164 is , the larger is the dimensionless logarithmic energy spectrum of the gws . on the other hand ,",
    "the larger @xmath164 is , the more the spectrum is shifted towards larger frequencies .",
    "this is a simple consequence of the fact that a larger @xmath164 implies a larger maximum of the potential @xmath147 . in summary ,",
    "an increase in @xmath164 implies two things : an upward shift and a rightward shift of the spectrum .",
    "it is also worthy of notice that the plateau of the spectrum merges at middle / low frequencies for different values of @xmath14 .",
    "this is not surprising as the energy scale of inflation , @xmath165 , is almost fixed and independent of @xmath14 in our model , where @xmath166 ( cf . the previous section ) and it is precisely the value of @xmath165 that shifts vertically such a plateau @xcite .",
    "the parameter @xmath165 is fixed mainly by the measurements of @xmath114 and @xmath76 .",
    "the fact that @xmath76 is much more constrained by the latest wmap7 data than the previous one , wmap5 , explains the changes in the plateau of our fig .",
    "[ gwspectrum ] and fig .  4 of ref .",
    "@xcite , where on the last mentioned figure different values of @xmath76 , or equivalently different values of the power law universal expansion @xmath85 ( in terms of the conformal time ) are assumed .",
    "therefore , the spectrum of gws at very low frequencies is insensitive to the value of @xmath14 , because for larger frequencies the spectrum already merged for different @xmath14 s whereas for smaller frequencies the universe is described by the concordance model @xmath24cdm ( at time the modes reenters the horizon ) , which is independent of the parameter @xmath14 .     against the frequency @xmath129 for different value of @xmath14 in this gcg model :",
    "the blue line refers to @xmath54 , the red one refers to @xmath167 , and the grey one to @xmath168.,width=340 ]    there are some observational constraints on the upper limit of the energy spectrum @xmath169 @xcite :    * constraint from cmb : + @xmath170 .",
    "* constraint from timing observations of millisecond pulsars : + @xmath171 . * constraint from doppler tracking of the cassini spacecraft : + @xmath172 .",

    "* constraint from bbn : + @xmath175 , + where @xmath176 ,    where @xmath177 .",
    "all these constraints are fulfilled by the power spectrum shown in fig .",

    "this model is a clear example of how the detection of gws can be extremely helpful to distinguish among several inflation models and a complementary tool to the study of primordial spectrum of the scalar perturbations . indeed , while our model is indistinguishable for any value of @xmath14 at low @xmath87 and @xmath129 , on the spectrum of scalar and tensorial perturbations , respectively , it should be distinguishable at high @xmath87 and @xmath129 .",
    "most importantly , the high frequency regime is within the reach of future gravitational wave detectors such as bbo and decigo @xcite .",
    "we present a model that attempts to fuse the inflationary era and the subsequent radiation dominated era under a unified framework so as to provide a smooth transition between the two .",
    "the model is based on a modification of the generalized chaplygin gas . more precisely , it interpolates between a `` quintessence - like '' , or power law , expansion and a subsequent radiation dominated universe .",
    "such a gas fulfills an equation of state ( [ p ] ) or ( [ p2 ] ) which has been previously used in the literature as a means to explain a possible interplay between the dark sectors of the universe @xcite .",
    "our attempt is therefore in a different context .",
    "we have shown how such a model has an underlying scalar field description , where the scalar field starts rolling down a potential hill where the extreme slow - roll approximation is valid until a bite before the end of inflation .",
    "we have obtained the full power spectrum of the scalar perturbations and constrained the model using the latest wmap7 data . from our analysis",
    "it turns out that the model is indistinguishable from a power - law expansion at low wave numbers @xmath87 ( cf .",
    "[ ps ] and [ ns ] ) even if we vary the only degree of freedom present on the model , the parameter @xmath14 .",
    "notice in this regard that the rest of the parameters of the model are fixed by observations as explained on sect .",
    "we have completed our analysis by obtaining the spectrum of the gravitational waves ( cf .  fig .",
    "[ gwspectrum ] ) where we have used the method of bogoliubov coefficients @xcite . it turns out that our model is within the reach of future gravitational - wave detectors like bbo and decigo @xcite .",
    "most importantly , for those frequencies it appears possible to distinguish this modified gcg model among different values of @xmath14 , while this seems unattainable using the power spectrum of the scalar perturbation with the present or near future observations .",
    "last but not least , we have shown as well how the scalar perturbation spectrum of the present model is not as red as the one presented in @xcite for an alternative gcg model for the early universe . in comparison ,",
    "the model presented here is more consistent with observations .",
