    "chandra images of starburst galaxies are spectacular , showing a multitude of bright point sources and plumes of x - ray emitting gas @xcite .",
    "the brightest of the discrete sources ( l@xmath1 @xmath2 ergs s@xmath3 ) are known as ultra - luminous x - ray sources ( ulx ) , and have attracted considerable attention in recent years because they have broad - band x - ray luminosities many times the eddington limit for a neutron star or stellar mass black hole ( * ? ? ?",
    "* e.g. ) . there is a growing concensus that most ulx can be explained as high ( @xmath4 10 m@xmath0 ) stellar mass black holes radiating in excess of the eddington limit , possibly with mild beaming ( * ? ? ?",
    "* see ) and references therein ) .",
    "the most massive stellar black holes are thought to form in low metallicity environments , where the stellar winds of the progenitor are relatively weak and do not carry off such a large fraction of the initial mass of the star @xcite .",
    "thus ulx should form preferentially in low metallicity environments .",
    "observational evidence for this is seen in some ulx ( * ? ? ?",
    "* e.g. )    ngg  922 is a peculiar galaxy with a distinctive c - shaped ring of h@xmath5 emission ( see figure  [ halpha ] ) .",
    "it has been described as a dust - obscured grand design spiral galaxy @xcite . however , a recent paper by @xcite presents compelling evidence that the morphology could be explained as a result of an off - center collision between a spiral and its dwarf companion .",
    "this model successfully explains the c - shaped morphology .",
    "the intruder galaxy is identified to be a dwarf galaxy approximately 8 arcminutes away , apparently connected to ngc  922 by a plume of tidal debris .",
    "the starburst in ngc  922 is still on - going as evidenced by the luminous h@xmath5 emission and a population of very young , massive star clusters @xcite .",
    "ngc  922 is similar to the cartwheel in that both of them are the remnants of drop through collisions , and both of them have high star formation rates .",
    "the cartwheel galaxy is famous for hosting 12 ulx , most of which are in the star forming ring ( @xcite , see also @xcite ) .",
    "this is the largest number of ulx seen in a single system , and has led to speculation that the low metallicity of the cartwheel ( 0.3 z@xmath0 ) may optimize the conditions for ulx formation @xcite . in contrast ,",
    "ngc 922 has metallicity near solar @xcite .",
    "we are currently engaged in a _",
    "chandra _  and _ hst _ study of the x - ray binary population of ngc 922 . in this paper",
    ", we compare the ulx population of ngc 922 and the cartwheel .",
    "our primary goal is to determine whether there is an excess of ulx ( normalized to the star formation rate ) in the cartwheel compared to ngc 922 that can be attributed to the difference in metallicity .",
    "in addition , we use population synthesis models to estimate the expected number of ulx in both systems . in a future paper",
    "we use _ hst _  broad - band and h@xmath6 images to study the relationship between the x - ray sources and star clusters in ngc 922 .",
    "two images of ngc  922 were obtained in 2009 .",
    "the first was a 30ks exposure designed to detect x - ray point sources down to a luminosity of 7@xmath7ergs s@xmath3 and the second a 10ks exposure , scheduled a few months later , to detect variability in the brightest sources .",
    "observational details are given in table  [ tab : obs ] .",
    "data were reduced using the software package ciao ( ver .",
    "3.4 ) with the appropriate calibration products .",
    "we created exposure maps using the task ` merge_all ` and we determined the positions of the point sources using the ciao task ` wavdetect ` . a smoothed x - ray image of ngc  922 is shown in figure  [ image ] .",
    "the x - ray point sources are marked .",
    "counts for the point sources were extracted from regions shown in figure  [ image ] .",
    "background counts for each point source were extracted from an annular region around each source ( these regions are not shown in figure  [ image ] ) .",
    "the counts for each source were corrected for the psf fraction ( point spread function fraction , i.e. the fraction of counts outside the extraction region ) by using a psf with energy 1 kev .",
    "the background subtracted , psf corrected count rate for each source at both epochs is shown in table  [ data ] .",
    "we extracted x - ray spectra and standard response files ( arf and rmf ) for each source .",
    "fluxes and luminosities for the deep march observation were constructed in the 0.3 - 8 kev band , assuming a galactic absorption @xmath8=1.6@xmath9 @xmath10 . using the results of @xcite",
    ", we adopt an intrinsic source spectrum with photon index @xmath11 to calculate luminosities .",
    "fluxes were then calculated in xspec by rescaling the normalization of the power law model to the observed count rates .",
    "luminosities were calculated assuming a distance of 48 mpc @xcite .",

    "the similar ulx / sfr observed in the cartwheel and ngc 922 is , in fact , expected in population synthesis models of ulx formation in low metallicity environments .",
    "@xcite studied the mechanisms for high mass x - ray binary formation in starburst environments , finding the ulx population to be dominated by systems moving through pathways powered by strong wind accretion from supergiant donors onto massive black holes formed in failed supernovae at both z  =  0.75  z@xmath39 and z  =  0.28  z@xmath39 .",

    "we note two results : ( 1 ) our default simulations overpredict the absolute number of observed systems by approximately an order of magnitude , and ( 2 ) our models similarly predict no metallicity dependence in the ulx / sfr ratio in the regime between 0.75  z@xmath39 and 0.3  z@xmath39 investigated in this study",
    ".    predictions regarding the absolute number of bright x - ray binaries are particularly difficult for population synthesis models .",
    "we note several obvious parameter space choices which would allow a match between our simulations and observations . because the supergiant donors have extremely large radii , the ulx formed through this pathway must be weakly bound - implying that small natal kicks imparted to massive bhs ( e.g. a maxwellian distribution with dispersion velocity 26.5  km  s@xmath3 ) can disrupt as many as 90% of ulx progenitors  @xcite .",
    "additionally , our definition of ulx assumes an average x - ray luminosity of 1  x  10@xmath14  erg  s@xmath3 , however eccentricities may make these systems dimmer for a substantial portion of their orbit .",
    "another plausible explanation concerns the treatment of super - eddington accretion . in our default simulations",
    "we allow black hole accretors to power ulx at up to ten times the eddington limit , so long as the donor winds are able to supply enough material to the black hole accretor .",
    "our models do not describe the specific mechanisms which allow this .",
    "several mechanisms involving dynamic instabilities have been postulated - and include leaky - disk @xcite or beaming @xcite models which may imply a duty cycle at the 10% level .",
    "the ratio of ulx formation rates between ngc 922 and the cartwheel places more meaningful constraints on the models than absolute numbers , as there are fewer parameters which can fine tune the metallicity dependence . in this case",
    ", we find models using the default assumptions in @xcite to correctly predict insignificant metallicity dependence in the regime from z  =  0.75  z@xmath39 to z  =  0.18  z@xmath39 .",
    "we emphasize that this relation falls naturally out of our simulations , as the ulx population at both metallicities is created through the same evolutionary channels .",
    "we note that if the metallicity of the cartwheel is significantly lower than assumed here , then this assumption would no longer hold , and the cartwheel would begin to be dominated by a second population powered by roche lobe overflow of main sequence stars onto fallback bh accretors ( this model has been suggested as a mechanism to explain the properties of the brightest source in the cartwheel @xcite ) .",
    "thus the consistency of the ulx / sfr ratio provides some preference for a higher modeled metallicity within the cartwheel .",
    "guided by this consistency in the ulx / sfr in the observed metallicity range , we note several other robust results .",
    "first , the supergiant donors which power ulx activity die off quickly after star formation , and we find @xmath3295% of luminous ulxs to be younger than 20  myr .",
    "secondly , the direct collapse pathway imparts almost no systematic velocity to the resultant x - ray binaries , and thus ulx are constrained to lie very close to recent star formation regions .",
    "however , these systems may gain significant spatial velocities if they are formed within dense stellar environments where three body interactions become non - negligible @xcite .",
    "finally , we caution that the significant overabundance of ulx sources predicted by startrack models implies an additional physical mechanism which must eliminate a large number of possible ulx systems .",
    "we are unable , in this study , to constrain this mechanism from introducing a metallicity dependence , which would create a mismatch between observations and our simulated population .",
    "ngc 922 is a drop - through ring galaxy @xcite with an expanding ring of star formation , similar in many respects to the cartwheel galaxy .",
    "new chandra observations reveal a population of bright x - ray point sources , including nine ulx , defined by l@xmath17 ergs s@xmath3 in the 0.3 - 8.0 kev band .",
    "the brightest source has an 0.3 - 8 kev luminosity l@xmath1=2@xmath19 ergs s@xmath3 , placing it at the upper end of the x - ray binary luminosity function @xcite .",
    "the spectrum of this source is hard , and similar to other binaries in an `` ultraluminous '' state @xcite .",
    "we compare the ngc  922 x - ray source population with that of the cartwheel .",
    "these two systems are similar in many respects ( both drop - through ring galaxies ) but the cartwheel has a lower metallicity than ngc 922 .",
    "we find that the number of ulx in ngc 922 and the cartwheel scales with the star formation rate : there is no evidence for an excess of sources in the cartwheel .",
    "population synthesis models using _ startrack _  suggest that the ulx population in both ngc 922 and the cartwheel is dominated by systems with strong wind accretion from supergiant donors onto direct - collapse bhs .",
    "the default models over - predict the number of observed ulx in both galaxies .",
    "there are several simplifying assumptions in the simulations which could account for the discrepancy .",
    "for example , the models assume that direct collapse events impart no natal kick to the resultant black hole . however , even small kicks could separate the widely spaced progenitors before the ulx phase begins , hence reducing the number of ulx .",
    "the simulations correctly predict the ratio of the number of ulx in ngc 922 and the cartwheel .",
    "we emphasize that this relation falls naturally out of the @xcite simulations , as the ulx population at both metallicities is created through the same evolutionary channels .",
    "we note that the @xcite simulations predict a substantially different ulx population below z @xmath160.15  z@xmath39 .",
    "thus it would appear that the metallicity of the cartwheel is not low enough to see a difference in the ulx population compared to ngc 922 .",
