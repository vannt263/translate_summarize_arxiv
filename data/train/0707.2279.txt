    "the experimental study of the process @xmath0 at energies @xmath7  gev is of interest for a number of reasons .",
    "first , this is one of the processes in which the excited states of the light vector mesons whose characteristics until now have not been reliably established , should manifest themselves .",
    "second , the cross section of this process is determined by the form factor of charged kaon , whose knowledge together with the data on the neutral kaon form factor , measured in the reaction @xmath8",
    "@xcite at the same energies , makes possible a calculation of the isovector and isoscalar form factors of kaons and determination of the parameters of the excited states of light vector mesons .",
    "third , the isovector form factor of a kaon obtained in @xmath2 annihilation can be used to test conservation of vector current by using experimental data on the @xmath9 lepton decay modes with kaons  @xcite . and",
    "finally , the process production of charged kaon pairs contributes to the total hadron production cross section and its accurate knowledge is interesting for the standard model tests , for example , for the measurement of the muon anomalous magnetic moment .",
    "the first observation of pair production of charged kaons in @xmath2 interactions in the energy region above the @xmath5 meson resonance was performed at novosibirsk collider vepp-2 in 1970  @xcite .",
    "subsequently the study of @xmath0 was conducted in experiments  @xcite .",
    "the most precise measurement of the cross section ( 10% statistical and 10@xmath6 systematic uncertainties ) was performed with the olya detector at the vepp-2 m collider  @xcite .",
    "the urgency of the charged kaon form factor measurement is also motivated by a recent announcement  @xcite about the observation of a wide resonance structure in the @xmath10 invariant mass spectrum near 1.5  gev in the decay @xmath11 .    in the present work",
    "we report the results of the measurement of the @xmath0 cross section in experiments with the snd detector at the vepp-2 m collider in the center - of - mass energy range @xmath1 from @xmath12 to @xmath13  gev .",
    "in 19952000 experiments with the snd detector  @xcite were carried out at the vepp-2 m @xmath2 collider  @xcite in the energy range from 0.36 to 1.38  gev .",
    "the basic part of the snd detector is the three - layer electromagnetic calorimeter consisting of 1632 nai(tl ) crystals .",
    "the energy and angular resolutions of the calorimeter depend on photon energy : @xmath14{e(gev)}$ ] and @xmath15 .",
    "charged - particle tracking is provided by two coaxial cylindrical drift chambers .",
    "the angular resolution is 0.5@xmath16 and 2@xmath16 for the azimuthal and polar angles , respectively .",
    "muon identification is provided by the muon system consisting of two layers of streamer tubes and a layer of plastic scintillation counters .",
    "the solid angle coverage of the snd detector is 90% of 4@xmath17 .    in the present work the data of two scans taken in 1997 ( from 0.98 to 1.38  gev ) and",
    "one scan taken in 1999 ( from 1.04 to 1.34  gev ) are used .",
    "the integrated luminosity of these experiments measured using @xmath2 elastic scattering is 6.7 pb@xmath18 .",
    "the energy spread at each energy point does not exceed 1  mev and is taken into account in the data analysis .",
    "to select events of the process @xmath19 we require the presence of two collinear charged particles originating from the @xmath2 interaction point . a deviation from collinearity ( @xmath20 ) in the plane",
    "perpendicular to the beam direction is determined by multiple scattering in the detector material in front of the tracking system and depends on the kaon energy .",
    "the following conditions on this parameter were required : + @xmath21 for @xmath22  gev , + @xmath23 for @xmath24  gev  @xmath25  gev , + @xmath26 for @xmath27  gev . + a deviation from collinearity ( @xmath28 ) in the plane passing through the beam is additionally affected by radiation from the initial @xmath2 state . to limit the energy of radiated photons , the condition @xmath29 was used .",
    "it was required for both tracks that @xmath30  cm and @xmath31  cm , where @xmath32 is the minimum distance from the track to the beam axis and @xmath33 is the coordinate of the particle production point along the beam axis .",
    "the number of neutral particles detected in the event was not limited .",
    "basic background processes satisfying the selection criteria are processes with two collinear particles in the final state : @xmath34 @xmath35 @xmath36    to suppress the background from the process ( [ e1 ] ) , we required that the energy deposition of the charged particles in the calorimeter be less than 0.7  @xmath1 and their polar angles @xmath37 be in the range @xmath38 .",
    "the substantial part of the background from the process ( [ e1 ] ) is caused by particle hittings into the dead calorimeter counters .",
    "such events , whose fraction is about 2% , were excluded from the analysis .    to suppress background from the process ( [ mu1 ] ) and reject the cosmic - ray background , a signal from the muon system was used .",
    "the requirement of the absence of this signal decreased the background from the process ( [ mu1 ] ) by approximately 2 orders of magnitude .    with these criteria",
    "136532 events were selected in the energy interval from @xmath12 to @xmath13  gev .",
    "for the additional suppression of the background from the processes ( [ pi1])([mu1 ] ) , we used a difference in the energy deposition profile in the calorimeter layers for particles of the signal and background processes .",
    "efficient @xmath39 separation provided by the calorimeter is possible in the energy range under study because of the substantial difference between kaons and pions in the ionization losses and in the penetration depths .",
    "the special separation parameters were created with the aid of the neural network approach  @xcite .",
    "monte - carlo simulated events were used for the network training .    for each detected particle in the event parameters",
