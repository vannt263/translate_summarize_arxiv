    "the scatter in the abundances is large at any concentration of galaxies ( at any density of the environment ) , i.e. , galaxies with both enhanced and reduced abundances can be found at any density of the environment .",
    "thus , our result confirms the conclusions of the previous studies that environmental effects do not play a key role in the chemical evolution of galaxies .",
    "we examined the influence of the environment on the abundances of late - type galaxies of masses of @xmath0 m@xmath1 to @xmath2 m@xmath1 with redsifts up to @xmath170 from the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) .",
    "the oxygen and nitrogen abundances were estimated through our recent calibrations and are compatible to the @xmath11-based metallicity scale in hii regions .",
    "galaxies with reliable stellar masses and oxygen and nitrogen abundances were extracted from the full sample .    the obtained oxygen abundance ",
    "galaxy mass ( o / h  @xmath6 ) and the nitrogen abundance  galaxy mass ( n / h ",
    "@xmath6 ) diagrams reproduce the known evolution of galactic abundances with mass and redshift .",
    "+ the oxygen and nitrogen abundances increase with increasing mass and with decreasing redshift , and the x / h  @xmath6 relations flattens out at the massive end",
    ". + the rate of change of the chemical abundances in galaxies at the present epoch decreases with increasing masses ( the downsizing effect ) . + the rate of change of nitrogen abundance with redshift and stellar mass is higher than that for oxygen .",
    "we studied the influence of the environmental density on the overabundance of oxygen and nitrogen and investigated the deviation of these abundances from the abundance ",
    "galaxy mass relation .",
    "the environmental density was specified by the number of neighbouring galaxies within a region in projected distance  redshift difference space .",
    "five different values of the projected distance were considered : @xmath114 mpc , 2 mpc , 3 mpc , 4 mpc , and 5 mpc .",
    "the redshift differences take into account the change of redshift with distance equal to the adopted @xmath108 and the peculiar velocities of galaxies @xmath111 .",
    "three peculiar velocities were considered : @xmath171 km s@xmath28 , 500 km s@xmath28 , and 100 km s@xmath28 .",
    "we find that the influence of the environment on the chemical abundances of galaxies is most pronounced for galaxies of masses of @xmath0 m@xmath1 to @xmath3 m@xmath1 .",
    "the galaxies in the densest environments can show an abundance excess larger than about @xmath163 dex in oxygen ( based on the median value for 101 galaxies with the densest environments ) and around @xmath136 dex in nitrogen above the mean .",
    "the overabundance decreases with increasing galaxy mass and with decreasing environmental density .",
    "the overabundance in galaxies in dense local environments ( at @xmath114 mpc ) is higher than that of galaxies in dense extended environments ( at @xmath118 mpc ) , i.e. , the oxygen overabundance is more sensivite to the local than to the extended environment density .",
    "since only a small fraction of galaxies are in high - density environments then they do not have a significant influence on the general x / h  @xmath6 relation .",
    "the metallicity  mass relations for isolated galaxies and galaxies having neighbours are similar to each other . the mean shift of non - isolated galaxies around the metallicity  mass relation traced by the isolated galaxies is less than @xmath172 dex for oxygen and less than @xmath107 dex for nitrogen .",
    "the scatter in the overabundances is large at any environmental density , i.e. , galaxies with both enhanced and reduced abundances can be found at any density of the environment .",
    "this suggests that environmental effects do not play a key role in the chemical evolution of late - type galaxies .",
