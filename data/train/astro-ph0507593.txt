    "one of the most interesting challenges in astronomy is to investigate the mass and properties of first generation `` population iii ( pop iii ) '' stars , and how various elements have been synthesized in the early universe .",
    "just after the big bang these elements were mostly only h , he and a small amount of light elements ( li , be , b , etc ) .",
    "heavier elements , such as c , o , ne , mg , si and fe , were synthesized during the evolution of later generation stars , and massive stars exploded as supernovae ( sne ) , releasing heavy elements into space .",
    "stars end their lives differently depending on their initial masses @xmath4 . here",
    "the pop iii stars are assumed to undergo too little mass loss to affect the later core evolution .",
    "then the fates of pop iii stars are summarized as follows . those stars lighter than 8@xmath5",
    "form white dwarfs .",
    "those with 8@xmath5 ",
    "130@xmath5 undergo one - fe core collapse at a last stage of their evolution leaving neutron stars or black holes . some of these stars explode as the core - collapse supernovae . stars with 130@xmath5 ",
    "300@xmath5 undergo electron - positron pair creation instability during oxygen burning , releasing more energy by nuclear burning than the gravitational binding energy of the whole star , and hence these stars disrupt completely as the pair - instability supernovae ( pisn ) .",
    "stars with 300@xmath5 - @xmath6 also enter into the pair - instability region but continue to collapse .",
    "fryer , woosley , & heger ( 2001 ) calculated evolution of 260 and 300 @xmath5 stars and obtained the result that a 260 @xmath5 star ends up as a pisn and a 300 @xmath5 star collapsed .",
    "stars over @xmath7 collapse owing to general relativistic instability before reaching the main - sequence . the core collapse sne ( type ii , ib and ic sne ) release mainly @xmath8-elements such as o , mg , si and ca and some fe - peak elements as well .",
    "it has been suggested that the initial mass function ( imf ) of pop iii first stars may be different from the present one - that more massive stars existed in the early universe ( e.g. , nakamura & umemura 1999 ; abel , bryan , & norman 2000 ; bromm , coppi , & larson 2002 ; omukai & palla 2003 ) . some authors ( e.g. , wasserburg and qian 2000 ; qian , sargent , wasserburg 2002 ; qian and wasserburg 2002 ; & yoshida et al . 2004 ) argued that existence of very massive stars ( vmss ) in the early universe is consistent with abundance data of ly@xmath8 systems .",
    "numerical simulations by , e.g. , bromm & loeb ( 2004 ) , indicate that the maximum mass of pop iii stars to be formed will be @xmath9 300@xmath5  500@xmath5 .",
    "omukai & palla ( 2003 ) , however , point out that under certain conditions vmss much heavier than 300@xmath5 can be formed in the zero - metallicity environment .",
    "tan & mckee ( 2004 ) calculated star formation by taking rotation and disk structure and concluded that first stars should be much more massive than @xmath10 .",
    "another scenario for the formation of vmss for any metallicity has been presented by ebisuzaki et al .",
    "( 2001 ) and portegies zwart et al .",
    "( 1999 , 2004a , 2004b ) , where vmss are formed by merging of less massive stars in the environment of very dense star clusters .",
    "in the present paper , we call the stars with @xmath11 `` super - massive stars ( smss ) '' , and the stars with @xmath12 `` very - massive stars ( vmss ) '' . among `` vmss '' we define @xmath13 stars as `` core - collapse very - massive stars ( cvmss ) '' , in order to clarify the distinction between the pisn mass range and the core - collapse range . here",
    "we focus on cvmss , and deal with 500 and 1000 @xmath0 models .",
    "such cvmss might have released a large amount of heavy elements into space by mass loss and/or supernova explosions , and they might have significantly contributed to the early galactic chemical evolution , if they were the source of reionization of intergalactic h and he ( e.g. , gnedin & ostriker 1997 ; venkatesan , tumlinson , & shull 2003 ) .",
    "the reionization of intergalactic he has traditionally been attributed to quasars . however , according to the results of the _ the wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe _ (",
    "_ wmap _ ) observation in 2003 , reionization in the universe took place as early as 0.2 - 0.3 billion years after the big bang ( redshift @xmath14)(kogut et al .",
    "then these pop iii cvmss might provide a better alternative channel which could operate at redshifts higher than what is assumed for quasars ( bromm , kudritzki , & loeb 2001 ) .",
    "the question of whether cvmss ( @xmath15 ) actually existed is of great importance , for instance , to understand the origin of intermediate mass black holes ( imbhs)(@xmath16 ) .",
    "stellar mass black holes ( @xmath17 ) are formed as the central compact remnants of ordinary massive ( 25 - 130@xmath5 ) stars at the end of their evolution , while supermassive black holes(smbhs ) ( @xmath18 - @xmath19 ) are now known to exist in the center of almost all galaxies ( e.g. , kormendy & richstone 1995 ; bender 2004 ) .",
    "imbhs have not been found until recently .",
    "however , there is a strong possibility that some imbhs have been , indeed , found ( e.g. , barth , green , & ho 2005 for most recent review ) .",
    "matsumoto et al . ( 2001 ) reported possible identification of a @xmath20 700@xmath0 black hole in m82 , by using _",
    "chandra _ data . as to formation of smbhs",
    "there are several scenarios ( e.g. , rees 2002 , 2003 ) .",
    "smbhs may be formed directly from supermassive halos of dark matter ( e.g. , marchant & shapiro 1980 ; bromm and loeb 2003 ) .",
    "ebisuzaki et al .",
    "( 2001 ) suggested a scenario where imbhs grow to a smbh by merging and swallowing of many of these objects .",
    "if cvmss actually existed , they could be considered as natural progenitors of imbhs .",
    "motivated by these backgrounds , here we calculate the evolution , collapse , explosion , and nucleosynthesis of pop iii cvmss ( over 300@xmath5 ) .",
    "these stars are expected to form black holes directly at the end of evolution .",
    "it has not been known yet if they will explode as sne . however ,",
    "if the star is rotating the whole star will not become a black hole at once , but it is expected to form an accretion disk around the central remnant ( e.g. shibata & shapiro 2002 ) . after forming an accretion disk , jet - like explosions may occur by extracting energy from the accretion disk and/or the black hole itself ( fryer et al .",
    "2001 ; macfadyen et al . 2001 ; maeda & nomoto 2003 ) .",
    "therefore , in our current explosion and collapse calculations we adopt a two - dimensional approach including accretion along the equatorial direction and jets toward the polar direction .",
    "we compare our results of nucleosynthesis with the observed abundance data of intracluster medium ( icm ) , intergalactic medium ( igm ) , gases in the central part of m82 , and extremely metal - poor ( emp ) stars in the galactic halo . since it is very difficult to observe directly the explosions of the first generation stars due to the large distance ( redshift @xmath21 ) , currently _ comparison of the kind carried out in this study will offer a powerful method to support the existence of such very massive stars .",
    "_    after describing the basic methods adopted and the assumptions made for our models in section 2 , the results are presented and discussed in section 3 , and they are compared with observations in section 4 .",
    "further discussion and concluding remarks are given in the last section , section 5 .",
    "we calculate evolution , core collapse , explosion , and nucleosynthesis of very - massive stars with 500@xmath5 and 1000@xmath5 .",
    "as mentioned in introduction , such massive stars may be formed in a metal - free environment .",
    "we start our evolutionary calculations by assuming that the stars have 500 and 1000@xmath5 , with zero - metallicity , on the pre - main sequence . as our starting approximation",
    "we neglect radiative mass loss due to zero metallicity ( kudritzki 2000 ) .",
    "ibrahim et al . ( 1981 ) , baraffe et al . ( 2001 ) , and nomoto et al . ( 2003 ) showed that pulsational mass loss is not so effective for metal - free stars , so we also neglect the pulsational mass loss . to calculate presupernova evolution we adopt the stellar evolution code constructed by umeda & nomoto ( 2002 ) based on the henyey method .",
    "this code is developed from the codes constructed by nomoto & hashimoto ( 1988 ) , and umeda et al .",
    "the nuclear reaction network for calculating nucleosynthesis and energy generation at each stage of the evolution is developed by hix & thielemann ( 1996 ) .",
    "we include 51 isotopes up to si until he burning ends , and 240 up to ge afterwards .",
    "our evolutionary calculations are carried out from the pre - main sequence up to the iron - core collapse where the central density reaches as high as @xmath22 .",
    "when the temperature reaches @xmath23 k , where `` nuclear statistical equilibrium '' ( nse hereafter ) is realized , the abundance of each isotope is determined for a given set of density , temperature , and @xmath24 . here",
    "@xmath24 is the number of electrons per nucleon , defined as : + @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the atomic number , @xmath27 is the mass number , and @xmath28 is the mass fraction of species i. @xmath24 , as well as density and temperature , is a key quantity to determine the abundance of each element .",
    "we assume nse at @xmath29 ( k ) @xmath30 .",
    "the explosion mechanism of core - collapse supernovae is not well understood .",
    "moreover , we do not know beforehand how very massive stars over 300@xmath5 explode due to strong gravitation even when they are rotating . in this study , therefore , instead of going into the problem of whether such massive stars actually explode , we investigate the conditions required for these stars to explode , by exploring several situations with various models . for the explosion in the hydrodynamical simulation , we adopt the two - dimensional ( 2d ) newtonian hydrodynamical code constructed by maeda & nomoto ( 2003 ) and maeda ( 2004 ) .",
    "this code adopts the eulerian coordinate and solves euler equations based on roe s scheme ( hachisu et al .",
    "1992 , 1994 ) .",
    "previously 2d simulations of jet - induced supernova explosions have been carried out by many authors for ordinary massive stars with @xmath9 25@xmath5 to 40@xmath5 ( khokhlov et al .",
    "1999 ; macfadyen et al . 2001",
    "; nagataki 2000 ; maeda et al .",
    "2002 ; maeda & nomoto 2003 ; maeda et al .",
    "however , there have been no such detailed calculations for cvmss with @xmath31 .",
    "because temperatures are so high at the explosion , the pressure is radiation - dominated , and hence we use the equation of state for the radiation and electron - positron pairs with the adiabatic index of 4/3 .",
    "the explosion models to be explored are summarized in tables  [ tab : modelsh ] and  [ tab : modelsl ] .",
    "jets , which are supposed to be injected from the accretion disk , are considered to be the energy source of the explosion .",
    "we first choose the initial black hole mass , and the outer matter accretes toward the central object .",
    "because our hydrodynamical code includes gravitational force , the final black hole mass and the ejected mass are determined as the results of the calculations for a set of given parameters ( maeda & nomoto 2003 ) .",
    "one of the purposes of this study is to explore the condition for the stars to explode when jets are injected . as typical cases",
    "we choose the initial black hole mass , @xmath32 , at 100@xmath0 for the 1000@xmath0 star and 50@xmath0 for the 500@xmath0 star .",
    "however , in order to investigate the dependence of results on this parameter , we also explore larger or smaller values of @xmath32 .",
    "we adopt the spherical polar coordinate with the number of meshes set to @xmath33 for five models ( higher resolution ; a-1 , a-2 , b-1 , b-2 , and b-3 ) , and @xmath34 for the rest ( lower resoluton ) .",
    "the latter models are chosen so that we can search for parameter dependence quickly .",
    "we describe our results mainly based on those of higher resolution models .",
    "however , we include lower resolution models to explore the detailed dependence on parameters .",
    "we also calculate model b-2 with lower resolution , in order to numerically compare the two resolutions .",
    "the difference of the quantities we give in tables  [ tab : emtableh ] ,  [ tab : emtablel ] ,  [ tab : ejectstellarh ] , and  [ tab : ejectstellarl ] between the two resolutons is around 10 % .    at the beginning of hydrodynamical simulations ,",
    "the region @xmath35 is mapped onto the computational domain . the central part ( @xmath36 )",
    "is displaced by a point mass .",
    "the inner boundary of the simulations is set at the radius @xmath37 ( see tables  [ tab : modelsh ] and  [ tab : modelsl ] ) . in the computational domain",
    ", we assume that the effect of rotation is negligible .",
    "this assumption applies if the specific angular momentum @xmath38",
    "@xmath39 s@xmath40 in the progenitor star is in the range @xmath41 , where the lower and upper limits correspond to the conditions that the disk forms beyond the schwarzshild radius and well below the inner boundary of our computational domain .",
    "if @xmath42 , which is favorable in order to make an efficiently accreting disk ( narayan , piran , & kumer 2001 ) , then the rotational force is at most a few percent of the gravitational force at the inner boundary .    for the jet injection , we choose various values for the parameter , @xmath43 , the angle from the polar axis .",
    "the jet is injected into the direction of @xmath44 . at the direction @xmath45 , the inner boundary is treated as follows : it is set to be transmitted ( absorbed ; i.e. , vanishing radial gradient of all variables ) or reflected if the material just above the boundary has negative ( accreting ) or positive sign .",
    "these boundary conditions are used in previous studies on jet - induced supernova explosions ( khokhlov et al . 1999 ; macfadyen , woosley , & heger 2001 , maeda & nomoto 2003 ) .",
    "it should be noted that by using the transmitted boundary condition for the accretion case and neglecting pressure and rotational support below the boundary , we may overestimate the accretion rate .",
    "the energy and mass injected by the jets per unit time are connected with the properties of accreting matter as ( maeda & nomoto 2003 ) : @xmath46 @xmath47 where @xmath48 is the accretion rate , @xmath49 the injected energy per unit time , @xmath50 the mass spouted per unit time , @xmath51 the energy transformation efficiency , @xmath52 the mass fraction of the jets to the accreted matter , @xmath53 the jet density , @xmath54 the jet velocity , and @xmath55 the area over which the jet is spouted , respectively .",
    "we treat @xmath51 and @xmath52 as free parameters to be varied to explore the explosion energy .",
    "we consider two cases for the form of the injected energy .",
    "one is that almost all the energy of the jet is given as kinetic energy ( case a ) .",
    "the other is that almost all the energy is given as thermal energy ( case b ) .",
    "we introduce a parameter @xmath56 defined as : @xmath57 i.e. , the ratio of thermal energy in the jet to the total jet energy per unit time .",
    "this parameter is set to 0.01 for case a , and to 0.9 or 0.95 for case b. by using equations 2 , 3 and 4 we obtain the jet velocity : @xmath58}^{1/2 } c. \\label{vjet}\\ ] ]    equations 2,3 , and 4 give a complete set of jet properties at the inner boundary . in case",
    "a the jet carries most energy toward the polar ( jet - injected ) direction , and hence the model is highly non - spherical . for this case",
    ", we set the ratio between the two parameters , @xmath51/@xmath52 , to 0.1 .",
    "because we perform a newtonian calculation , the larger we set @xmath51 the larger we need to set @xmath52 , so that the jet material does not exceed or approach the speed of light . for case",
    "b , on the other hand , the models , due to the dominant thermal energy , become more spherical , because thermal motion is random and non - directional . for this case , we set larger @xmath51 values for the same @xmath52 compared with case a. this means that the jet is something like a hot bubble .    one of our primary purposes is to investigate how much heavy elements are synthesized and ejected by the explosion .",
    "therefore we stop the calculations when all of the following conditions are satisfied :    * @xmath48 decreases enough below @xmath59 s@xmath40 , i.e. , @xmath60 s@xmath40 . *",
    "total explosion energy @xmath61 becomes much larger than the absolute gravitational binding energy @xmath62 , @xmath63 .",
    "+ these criteria mean that accretion has almost stopped .",
    "* the maximum temperature of the matter decreases below @xmath64 k. + this means that explosive nucleosynthesis no longer occurs at such low temperatures .    under these criteria ,",
    "calculations sometimes end before jets reach the stellar surface .",
    "maeda & nomoto ( 2003 ) used helium stars ( the hydrogen envelope is removed by mass loss ) as the initial models , and carried out the calculations for about 100 s until the jet reaches the stellar surface and the expansion becomes homologous .",
    "in contrast the radii of the stars we use here are in the order of @xmath65 ( @xmath66 ) because they have the hydrogen - rich envelope .",
    "because we investigate the first generation stars , the mass loss will not be effective due to the metal - free environment .",
    "therefore , it is reasonable to examine a hydrogen - rich star rather than a he star .",
    "we calculated explosive nucleosynthesis by using temporal histories of density and temperature stored during hydrodynamical calculations .",
    "the reaction network we use includes 280 isotopes up to @xmath67 . at high temperatures , @xmath68 k @xmath69 , nse is realized .",
    "we use the `` nse '' code ( hix & thielemann 1996 ) for @xmath70 .",
    "the jet matter should be included in the ejected matter and we need to calculate its nucleosynthesis",
    ". we do not know which of the accreted matter is injected as jets , and so the final chemical composition is uncertain .",
    "however , pruet et al .",
    "( 2004 ) carried out nucleosynthesis of disk wind for various @xmath24 values .",
    "macfadyen & woosley ( 1999 ) and macfadyen ( 2003 ) also considered disk wind .",
    "based on these works in this study we make the following assumptions :    * because the jet matter is injected through the inner region ( from the accretion disk ) , it should have experienced high temperatures at which nse is realized ( @xmath71 ) .",
    "* the jet matter expands adiabatically after it is injected ( i.e. , entropy is conserved ) . *",
    "the accreted matter is mostly accreted while the accretion rate @xmath48 is of the order of 10 - @xmath72 s@xmath40 .",
    "it is likely that @xmath73 varies depending on when the jet material is injected .",
    "therefore @xmath74 ( entropy density , @xmath75 ) is likely to vary as well .",
    "* for the value of @xmath24 we assume @xmath76 .    based on these assumptions we start the calculation of nucleosynthesis of the jet matter from @xmath77 , using the historical temperature and density data of the first test particle of the jet ( injected at the first stage of the explosion ) in model a-2 ( history a ) , and the changed entropy data ( double ( history b ) or triple ( history c ) the density at the same temperature ) . in other words , we use three @xmath78 histories ( history a:(@xmath79 ) , history b:(@xmath80 ) , and history c:(@xmath81 ) ) , where the set ( @xmath82 ) is given by the hydrodynamic simulations .",
    "@xmath24 is parameterized at 0.48 , 0.49 , 0.50 , 0.51 , and 0.52 .",
    "we calculate 15 patterns and average these results to the first approximation . @xmath24 and entropy of the jet material can change when it is ejected .",
    "therefore here we consider combination of jets with different values of these parameters .",
    "these assumptions still include large uncertainty , but our aim is just to roughly estimate the amount of @xmath83 .",
    "the larger the mass of the jet is , the larger we expect the uncertainties to be .",
    "figure  [ track ] shows the evolutionary tracks of the central density - temperature relation for 500@xmath5 and 1000@xmath5 stars",
    ". we also plot , for comparison , the track of a 300@xmath5 star , which results in the pair - instability supernova .",
    "generally , more massive stars have higher entropies ( lower densities ) at the same temperatures ( i.e. , at the same burning stage ) .",
    "although each star passes through the region of electron - positron pair - instability , both 500@xmath5 and 1000@xmath5 stars proceed to iron - core collapse ( fe - decomposition region in figure  [ track ] ) , unlike the 300@xmath5 star .",
    "the 500@xmath5 and 1000@xmath5 stars do not become pair - instability supernovae though they pass through the pair - instability region , because the energy released at this stage is less than the gravitational binding energy of the star ( rakavy et al .",
    "1967 ; bond et al . 1984 ; glatzel et al . 1985 ; woosley 1986 ) .",
    "figure  [ fig : chemicon ] shows the presupernova chemical composition for the 500@xmath5 and 1000@xmath5 stars .",
    "in the region labeled as `` nse region '' , nse is realized . for this region ,",
    "we calculate the evolutional changes in terms of ( @xmath84 ) to obtain the nse abundances .",
    "one can see the onion - like structure from the center to the surface - the iron - core , silicon layer , oxygen layer , helium layer , and hydrogen - rich layer . here",
    "we define the iron - core as the region where the mass fraction of si is less than 10% .",
    "the iron - core occupies up to 130@xmath5 of mass from the center for the 500@xmath5 star , and 250@xmath5 for the 1000@xmath5 star . for both cases ,",
    "they occupy a quarter of the total mass .",
    "this fraction is much larger than that in ordinary massive stars .",
    "for example , in a 25@xmath5 star , the iron - core is about 1.6@xmath5(umeda et al .",
    "1999 ) , less than 10% of the total mass .",
    "the reason is the difference of the density and temperature structure .",
    "figure  [ qmr - rho ] shows the density and temperature structure of the two stars just before the explosion ( when the central density reaches @xmath85 g @xmath86 ) , which is compared with the 25@xmath5 model .",
    "the density and temperature gradients for the 500@xmath5 and 1000@xmath5 stars are smaller than those of the 25@xmath5 star , and hence the regions with high temperature and high density are larger",
    ". then the fraction of the iron - core is larger .",
    "the large drop of density at @xmath87 for the 500@xmath5 and 1000@xmath5 stars in figure  [ qmr - rho ] corresponds to the boundary between the oxygen and helium layer .",
    "we describe the results of explosion hydrodynamics in this subsection and nucleosynthesis in the next subsection , showing several figures .",
    "all figures are based on the results of high resolution models , except for figure  [ fig : success ] .      in tables",
    "[ tab : emtableh ] and  [ tab : emtablel ] we summarize for each model the total explosion energy , final black hole mass , and mass of the jets .",
    "the total explosion energy is of the order of @xmath88 erg for most cases , except that in model a-4 it is of the order of @xmath89 erg .",
    "model a-4 is almost at the border between the successful and failed explosions .",
    "actually , we also try to calculate the case which has the same parameters as model a-4 except that @xmath51 and @xmath52 are half the values of a-4 ( see model f-1 in table  [ tab : failure ] ) , but in this model the jet promptly falls back to the central remnant after it is injected , and hence the explosion fails . in this model , the total energy is still negative and the stellar matter moves toward the central remnant more than 200 s after the beginning of the accretion .",
    "the absolute value of gravitational binding energy over the region outside of the central 100@xmath0 core is as high as @xmath90 ergs for the 1000@xmath0 model . in this case energy injection",
    "is too weak for the jet to proceed outward .",
    "table  [ tab : failure ] summarizes the models in which explosion ends up as failure. figure  [ fig : success ] shows the models in which the explosion either occurs or not , depending on the two parameters @xmath43 and @xmath51 .",
    "one can see that the minimum @xmath51 needed for the successful explosion becomes higher if @xmath43 is larger , as in model a-2 and case b ( most of the injected energy is given as thermal energy ) .",
    "actually , explosion energies tend to be lower in such models than those in case a models with @xmath91 . in model a-2 and case b models",
    ", the injected energy tends to diffuse into the direction apart from the polar direction , and so the jet is weak even for the polar direction .",
    "figure  [ fig : snapshot ] shows how the jet is propagating through the star by plotting the density structures .",
    "one can see that the jet is strongly propagating in the polar direction for a-1 , while for b-1 the jet is broadened toward the side directions due to the random heat motion .",
    "the final black hole mass and ejected mass are also important .",
    "for the 500 @xmath0 and the 1000@xmath0 models , these values are @xmath1 and @xmath3 , respectively .",
    "figure  [ fig : masscutmr1 ] shows the regions where the matter will be accreted onto the central black hole . in these figures",
    "we can see the extent of asphericity and the amount of accreting matter .",
    "these panels show the initial positions ( just before the explosion ) of the accreted matter . in model a-2",
    "in which @xmath43 is twice ( @xmath92 ) the other models ( @xmath93 ) and case b , asphericity is weakened to some extent and the amount of the accreting matter is less compared with the models with @xmath91 and the same energy transformation efficiency @xmath51 . for models with @xmath94 , the stellar matter toward the direction @xmath95 almost accretes up to 500@xmath0 ( even a part of the helium layer ) on the mass coordinate . on the other hand , in model a-2 and case b models a large amount of matter inner than the 500@xmath0 core",
    "is ejected . at the same time , if asphericity becomes weaker the threshold efficiency for the successful explosion becomes more strict that is , larger @xmath51 is needed .",
    "this is because more energy diffuses toward the equatorial direction .    in figure",
    "[ fig : maxtr1 ] we show the maximum temperatures which each mesh reaches and the densities at the maximum temperatures for the @xmath96 ( polar)-direction , @xmath97 .",
    "we may pay special attention to the maximum @xmath98 for the @xmath99 and @xmath100 direction .",
    "for some models ( e.g. , a-1 in the left panel ) with @xmath101 , the maximum @xmath98 does not appear within the range of these graphs , because the matter which can experience such high temperatures is in the inner region , and hence such matter all accretes in these models .",
    "however , for the other cases , the inner matter is ejected and the explosive nucleosynthesis occurs even for the @xmath100 direction .",
    "when a shock arrives the shocked region is compressed and heated , drastically raising the density and temperature , and then the explosive nucleosynthesis occurs .",
    "the products of this event are characterized by the peak temperature .",
    "we first summarize the main products at different peak temperatures and then describe the results of the calculations .",

    "it was pointed out ( omukai & palla 2003 ; tan & mckee 2004 ) that after a protostar starts shining as a main - sequence star the accretion still continues . in our current study , as a starting point the effect of accretion on mass growth during the presupernova evolution is not included . in our next more realistic models such accretion will be included in the evolutionary calculations also .",
    "however , omukai & palla ( 2003 ) find that when the protostar simulation of very massive stars is carried out properly with time - dependent accretion rates , the rates generally decrease toward the end of the protostar era and after the onset of the main - sequence stellar phase .    also , it was pointed out ( maeder & meynet 2004 ) that mass loss will not be negligible even for zero - metallicity stars when they are rotating , and hence mass loss also will be included in the next step of our models .",

    "are formed , the first generation stars are generally thought to have formed in low - mass halos with the virial temperature @xmath199 10@xmath200 k. then the upper limit to the mass of first stars may be @xmath9 300@xmath0 ( e.g. , bromm & loeb 2004 ) .",
    "however , oh & haiman ( 2002 ) investigated halos with higher mass , with @xmath201 10@xmath200 k. the evolution of these high mass halos , e.g. , of @xmath202 , is found to be quite different from the low mass case , and the degree of fragmentation of the gas is still highly uncertain .",

    "already several of these objects have been identified , mostly in dwarf elliptical galaxies , but some in spiral galaxies , e.g. , m33 , ic 342 , pox 52 , ngc 4395 and several galaxies in the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) sample .",
    "for example , the black hole mass obtained for m33 is less than @xmath9 3000@xmath0 but larger than the mass of a stellar mass black hole .",
    "the black hole mass obtained for ngc 4395 is @xmath9 10@xmath200 - 10@xmath203 , but its spectra are unlike nlsi ( narrow line seyfert i ) - a class of agn which tends to have small mass .",

    "possible scenarios for formation of imbhs associated with ulxs are speculated in a recent article by krolik ( 2004 ) .",
    "colbert & mushotzky ( 1999 ) first suggested that these luminous objects are indeed imbhs , because their luminosity is super eddington for stellar mass black holes if spherical accretion is adopted .",
