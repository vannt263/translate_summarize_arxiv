    "thequest for the origin of matter dominated universe \" is a long standing puzzle of our physical world ( see e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "answers to this question might come from further exploration of    * the lepton sector cp violation by precise testing of the neutrino oscillation processes * * measure precisely the @xmath2 and the mixing angle @xmath1 ; * * examine matter effect in neutrino oscillation process and possibly conclude the mass hierarchy of neutrinos .",
    "* proton decay : * * search for p @xmath8 @xmath9 k@xmath10 and p @xmath8 e @xmath11 in the range @xmath12 years    with assuming non - equilibrium environment in the evolution of universe .",
    "the primary motivation of the t2k experiment  @xcite is to improve the sensitivity to the @xmath13 conversion phenomenon in the atmospheric regime by about an order of magnitude in the mixing angle @xmath14 compared to the chooz experimental limit  @xcite .",
    "the discovery of a non - vanishing @xmath1 angle would ascertain the @xmath15 nature of the lepton flavor mixing matrix .",
    "the measurements in t2k might indicate that the @xmath1 angle is in a region where the simultaneous determination of neutrino mass hierarchy and the cp violating phase becomes possible .",
    "the j - parc accelerator complex which includes the 180  mev linac , the 3  gev rapid cycling synchrotron ( rcs ) and the 30 - 50  gev main ring synchrotron ( mr ) is planned to be commissioned in 2008 . the j - parc neutrino beam facility , under construction for the t2k experiment ,",
    "is foreseen to begin operation in 2009 .",
    "the final goal for the t2k experiment is to accumulate an integrated proton power on target of @xmath16  mw@xmath17 seconds . within a few years of run , critical information , which will guide the future direction of the neutrino physics , will be obtained based on the data corresponding to about @xmath18  mw @xmath19 10@xmath20 seconds integrated proton power on target ( roughly corresponding to a 3@xmath21 discovery at sin@xmath62@xmath22@xmath23@xmath24 0.05 and 0.03 , respectively )  @xcite .",
    "it is well documented in the literature ( see e.g. refs .",
    "@xcite ) that the most challenging task for next generation long baseline experiments is to unfold the unknown oscillation parameters @xmath25 , @xmath2 and mass hierarchy , @xmath26 , and from the measurement of the energy dependence of the oscillation signal to resolve the so - called problems of `` correlations '' and `` degeneracies '' .",
    "the most important experimental aspects here are the beam profile ( e.g. the ability to cover with sufficient statistics the @xmath27 maximum of the oscillation , the @xmath27 minimum , and the @xmath28 maximum ) , the visible energy resolution of the detector , with which the neutrino energy can be reconstructed , and the spectrum of the misidentified background ( e.g. @xmath11 spectrum , etc . ) .",
    "one possible approach , advocated in the literature  @xcite , is to locate a very massive coarse water cerenkov detector at very long baselines ( @xmath29  km ) from a new multi - gev neutrino source and to detect more than one oscillation maximum . in this kind of configuration , although the oscillation peaks are well separated in energy , an important issue is the ability to subtract the backgrounds , in particular that coming from misidentified neutral current events with leading @xmath11 s which introduce new sources of systematic errors . in order to alleviate this problem , a different approach assuming two similar far water cerenkov detectors , one located at kamioka ( @xmath3  km ) and the other in korea ( @xmath30  km ) at the same oa2.5@xmath31 from the j - parc neutrino beam ,",
    "was discussed in ref .",
    "the two detectors would see the same sub - gev neutrino beam ( in fact the same as in t2k ) but the different baselines would allow to study @xmath32 regions corresponding to the 1st and 2nd oscillation maxima .",
    "the approach of our paper is different .",
    "we consider the physics performance of a single 100  kton next generation liquid argon time projection chamber ( lar tpc ) located in the region of okinoshima islands corresponding to a ( relatively modest ) baseline @xmath0  km .",
    "a detector in this location will automatically see the j - parc neutrino beam at an off - axis angle of @xmath33 . as we show below",
    ", this configuration allows to study both 1st and 2nd oscillation maximum peaks with good statistics .",
    "we rely on the realistic opportunity offered by the increase of intensity of the j - parc mr and on the higher precision of the lar tpc than other large detectors to separate the two peaks .",
    "in addition , the @xmath11 background is expected to be highly suppressed thanks to the fine granularity of the readout , hence the main irreducible background will be the intrinsic @xmath34 component of the beam .    at this stage of our investigations ,",
    "the emphasis is placed on the measurement of the @xmath1 and @xmath2 parameters , possibly following indications for a non - vanishing @xmath1 in t2k .",
    "we also compare the possibility to determine the @xmath25-@xmath2 parameters with a single detector configuration at other possible baselines like for example the t2k ( tokai - kamioka , oa2.5@xmath31 , @xmath3  km ) or the tokai - eastern korean coast ( @xmath4  km ) with an off - axis oa1.0@xmath31",
    "@xcite . more complete physics performance studies will be presented elsewhere .",
    "if a significant @xmath34 signal were to be observed at t2k , an immediate step forward to a next generation experiment aimed at the discovery of cp - violation in the lepton sector would be recommended with high priority .",
    "we have conducted a case study for the discovery of lepton sector cp violation based on the j - parc mr power improvement scenario .",
    "naturally , next generation far neutrino detectors for lepton sector cp violation discovery will be very massive and large . as a consequence",
    ", the same detector will give us the rare and important opportunity to discover proton decay .",
    "thus , we also discuss the proton decay discovery potential with a huge underground detector .",
    "compared with the t2k experimental conditions , lepton sector cp violation discovery requires    * an improved neutrino beam condition ( intensity increase , broader energy spectrum , possibly re - optimization of the focusing optics , ... ) ; * an improved far neutrino detector ( by improvements we primarily mean increased signal reconstruction efficiency , better background separation , better energy resolution , ... , and not only its volume ) .",
    "detector improvements include    * detector technology ; * its volume ; * its baseline and off - axis angle with respect to the neutrino source",
    ".    as for the neutrino beam intensity improvement , a realistic first step power improvement scenario at j - parc accelerator complex has been recently analyzed and proposed ( linac energy is recovered to be 400 mev , h=1 operation at rcs and 1.92 seconds repetition cycle operation at mr ) . as for the detector technology , we assume a 100 kton liquid argon time projection chamber for our case study .",
    "the effects of the cp phase @xmath2 appear either    * as a difference between @xmath9 and @xmath35 behaviors ( this method is sensitive to the @xmath36-odd term which vanishes for @xmath37 or 180@xmath31 ) ; * in the energy spectrum shape of the appearance oscillated @xmath34 charged current ( cc ) events ( sensitive to all the non - vanishing @xmath2 values including 180@xmath31 ) .    since antineutrino beam conditions are known to be more difficult than those for neutrinos ( lower beam flux due to leading charge effect in proton collisions on target , small antineutrinos cross - section at low energy , etc . ) , we concentrate on the possibility to precisely measure the @xmath34 cc appearance energy spectrum shape with high resolution during a neutrino - only run .",
    "the liquid argon time projection chamber ( lar tpc ) ( see ref .",
    "@xcite and references therein ) is a powerful detector for uniform and high accuracy imaging of massive active volumes .",
    "it is based on the fact that in highly pure argon , ionization tracks can be drifted over distances of the order of meters .",
    "imaging is provided by position - segmented electrodes at the end of the drift path , continuously recording the signals induced .",
    "@xmath38 is provided by the prompt scintillation light .    in this paper , we assume a lar tpc detector with a mass of the order of 100  kton , for example of a kind based on the glacier concept  @xcite . unlike other liquid argon tpcs operated or planned which rely on immersed wire chambers to readout the ionization signals , a double phase operation with charge extraction and amplification in the vapor phase is considered here in order to allow for very long drift paths and for improved signal - to - noise ratio .",
    "we assume that successful application of such novel methods will be an important milestone in the r&d for very large lar tpc detectors in the range of 100  kton . at this stage ,",
    "a ton - scale prototype based on this scheme has been developed and is under test  @xcite .",
    "challenges to realize liquid argon tpc s with a scale relevant to this paper have been reviewed e.g. in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "we refer to previous physics performance studies assuming such a detector configuration  @xcite and recall that since liquid argon tpc has advantages on    * good energy resolution / reconstruction , * good background suppression , * good signal efficiency    it is suitable for a precision measurement of the neutrino energy spectrum to extract cp information .",
    "thus we concentrate on the @xmath34 appearance energy spectrum shape measurement to extract leptonic cp phase information .",
    "the j - parc neutrino beam line was designed and constructed in order to allow an off - axis angle with respect to super - kamiokande ( sk ) between 2.5@xmath31 and 3@xmath31 . a beam setup yielding an oa2.5@xmath31 at sk",

    "if the neutrino energy spectrum of the oscillated events could be reconstructed with sufficiently good resolution in order to distinguish first and second maximum , useful information to extract the cp phase would be available even only with a neutrino run .",

    "the position of the first oscillation minimum is unaffected by it ( in this point all terms of the oscillation probability vanish except the solar term ) .",
    "to effectively experimentally study these observables , we point out that :    * the second oscillation maximum peak should end up at sufficiently high energy in order to be measurable ; * the beam should have a sufficiently wide energy range to cover the 1st and 2nd maximum ; * the neutrino flux should be maximized in order to increase as much as possible the statistical significance of the first and second maxima .    in order to cover a wider energy range",
    ", we accordingly favor a detector location which is near on - axis . if one assumes that the second oscillation maximum has to be located at an energy larger than about 400 mev , the oscillation baseline should be longer than about 600  km .",
    "in addition , in order to collect enough statistics , we choose a baseline which is not too much longer than above stated .    taking into account all of the above mentioned considerations , we privilege the okinoshima region : placing a detector in an appropriate location on the island   will probe neutrino oscillations at a baseline of @xmath63  km away from the source at an off - axis angle of @xmath33 .",
    "we assume realistic parameters of the j - parc beam after all accelerator complex upgrades described in the kek road - map are accomplished , as follows  @xcite :    * the average beam power is reaching 1.66 mw ; * a total of 3.45 @xmath19 10@xmath64 pot is delivered on target per year ; * the optimal kinetic energy of the incident protons is 30 gev .    to remain conservative",

    "our simulations indicate that a 20  kton lar tpc is expected to perform better than this although the masses are comparable , since the signal efficiency is higher than sk and the nc background is assumed to be negligible contrary to sk .",
    "even better , a 100  kton lar tpc at okinoshima would further improve the sensitivity by about a factor six compared to sk at kamioka ( or a factor 10 compared to t2k ) , thanks to its bigger mass , increased cross - section at higher energies and reduced off - axis angle , although the neutrino fluxes at the same off - axis angle would be reduced by a factor @xmath85 because of the longer baseline .",
    "as mentioned previously , the neutrino energy resolution expected in lar medium depends on several parameters and their interplay that ultimately need to be measured experimentally .    in principle ,",
    "energy and momentum conservation allow to estimate the incoming neutrino energy in the detector via a precise measurement of decay products , with the exception of the smearing introduced by fermi motion and other nuclear effects ( nuclear potential , re - scattering , absorption , etc . ) for interactions on bound nucleons . in this section",
    ", we try to estimate the smearing introduced by these effects with the help of exclusive neutrino event final states distributed with the okinoshima flux and generated with the genie mc  @xcite subsequently fully simulated with geant3 .",
    "nuclear effects in neutrino interactions can be roughly divided into those of the nuclear potential and those due to reinteractions of decay products .",
    "bound nucleons and other hadrons in nuclei are subject to a nuclear potential . the fermi energy ( or momentum ) must be calculated from the bottom of this nuclear potential well , and the removal of a nucleon from any stable nucleus is always an endothermic reaction .",
    "when hadrons are produced in the nucleus , some energy is spent to take it out of this well : for a nucleon , the minimum energy is given by the nucleon separation energy ( around 8 mev ) , and corresponds to a nucleon at the fermi surface .",
    "in this case , the daughter nucleus is left on its ground state .",
    "more deeply bound nucleons , leaving a hole in the fermi sea , correspond to an excitation energy of the daughter nucleus , and an additional loss of energy of the final state products .",
    "this energy is then spent in evaporation and/or gamma deexcitation .",
    "thus , the energy of the final state products is expected to be always slightly smaller than for interactions on free nucleons , and spread over a range of about 40 mev .",
    "correspondingly , the fermi momentum is transferred to the decay products and compensated by the recoil of the daughter nucleus .",
    "additional momentum distortions come from the curvature of particle trajectories in the nuclear potential .",
    "reinteractions in the nuclear medium also play an important role .",
    "interaction products can lose part of their energy in collisions , or even be absorbed in the same nucleus where they have been created .",
    "this is particularly true for pions , that have an important absorption cross section on nucleon pairs , while kaons have smaller interaction probability .",
    "once final state products have exited the nucleus , they will propagate in the medium with the possibility that further interactions occur .    in the case of the liquid argon tpc ,",
    "the medium is fully homogeneous and the detector is fully active .",
    "all deposited energy in the medium ( above a certain threshold ) will be eventually collected .",
    "several methods can be adopted to reconstruct the neutrino energy and we list in the following three :     = 0@xmath41 : perfect reconstruction ( top - left ) , lar using deposited energy(right - top ) , ibid but with charged pion mass correction ( left - bottom ) using final state lepton only ( like in wc ) ( right - bottom ) cases . , scaledwidth=97.5% ]    1 .",
    "* final state lepton : * this method , traditionally used in large water cerenkov detectors like kamiokande , imb or sk , relies on the precise measurement of the energy and direction of the outgoing lepton and kinematically constrains the incoming neutrino energy by assuming a quasi - elastic configuration : @xmath86 where @xmath87 , @xmath88 and @xmath89 are the energy , momentum and scattering angle of the outgoing lepton .",
    "this method is sensitive to the final state configuration and to fermi motion ( up to @xmath90  mev / c ) which randomizes the direction of the outgoing lepton .",
    "* momentum conservation : * neglecting the incoming neutrino mass , one obtains @xmath91 where @xmath92 is the momentum of the outgoing lepton , @xmath93 is the momentum of the outgoing hadron @xmath94 and @xmath95 is the fermi motion of the hit nucleon ( up to @xmath90  mev / c ) .",
    "this method is also sensitive to fermi motion since the recoiling remnant hit nucleus ( with momentum @xmath96 ) is not measured  .",
    "* energy conservation : * using a calorimetric approach , one can sum the deposited energies of all outgoing particles . in a tracking - calorimeter",
    "this is obtained by summing the @xmath75 measurements along each ionizing track to obtain the associated kinetic energies @xmath97 .",
    "one should identify final state particles in order to take into account their rest masses .",
    "this method is sensitive to the nuclear binding energy of the decay products and is intrinsically more precise than the above method relying on momenta for the energies considered here .",
    "mathematically one can write this result as : @xmath98    all methods are sensitive to potential re - interactions of the outgoing hadrons within the nucleus . in order to estimate the potential of a fully homogeneous and sensitive medium like the liquid argon tpc , we performed full simulations of neutrino interactions : the event 4-vector are generated with the genie mc and final state particles ( after nuclear reinteraction ) were propagated through the liquid argon medium with geant3 .",
    "the geometry of the setup is an infinite lar box and at this stage we have neglected charge quenching ( i.e. we assume a linear response to @xmath75 ) .",
    "we also assume a 100% efficiency to identify final state charged pions .    the achievable incoming neutrino energy resolution in the liquid argon medium has been estimated using @xmath34  cc events distributed with the @xmath77  flux expected at the okinoshima location .",
    "the results , using the energy conservation method , are shown in figure  [ fig : esgeantene ] .",
    "although okinoshima looks a very good candidate as mentioned so far , the favorable geography would allow , in principle , for a few baseline candidates for the detector locations ; kamioka for a relatively  short  baseline , okinoshima for a medium baseline and korea for the longest baseline .",
    "it is worthwhile to compare the physics potential at okinoshima with other scenarios with the same strategy and same assumed beam conditions , i.e. five years neutrino run at 1.66  mw .",
    "figure  [ fig : blresults ] illustrates the analyzed allowed regions using each option .",
    "a perfect resolution was assumed here to directly compare the physics potential of the various sites .",
    "as seen , sensitivity of @xmath2 is similar between okinoshima and korea , but that in kamioka is much worse than others .",
    "this indicates the analysis strategy using only neutrino run is not suitable for kamioka case , as was expected since the oa2.5@xmath31 available at kamioka does not allow to cover 1st and 2nd oscillation maxima peaks . as for the sensitivity of the @xmath14",
    ", okinoshima is better than korea , due to the increased statistics at the shorter baseline .",
    "grand unification of the strong , weak and electromagnetic interactions into a single unified gauge group is an extremely appealing idea  @xcite which has been vigorously pursued theoretically and experimentally for many years .",
    "the detection of proton or bound - neutron decays would represent its most direct experimental evidence .",
    "the physics potentialities of very large underground liquid argon tpc was recently carried out with detailed simulation of signal efficiency and background sources , including atmospheric neutrinos and cosmogenic backgrounds  @xcite .",
    "it was found that a liquid argon tpc , offering good granularity and energy resolution , low particle detection threshold , and excellent background discrimination , should yield very good signal over background ratios in many possible decay modes , allowing to reach partial lifetime sensitivities in the range of @xmath99  years with exposures up to 1000  kton@xmath19year , often in quasi - background - free conditions optimal for discoveries at the few events level , corresponding to atmospheric neutrino background rejections of the order of @xmath100 .",
    "multi - prong decay modes like e.g. @xmath101 or @xmath102 and channels involving kaons like e.g. @xmath103 , @xmath104 and @xmath105 are particularly suitable , since liquid argon imaging provides typically an order of magnitude improvement in efficiencies for similar or better background conditions compared to water cerenkov detectors .",
    "up to a factor 2 improvement in efficiency is expected for modes like @xmath106 and @xmath107 thanks to the clean photon identification and separation from @xmath11 .",
    "channels like @xmath108 or @xmath109 , dominated by intrinsic nuclear effects , yield similar efficiencies and backgrounds as in water cerenkov detectors .",
    "thanks to the self - shielding and 3d - imaging properties of the liquid argon tpc , the result remains valid even at shallow depths where cosmogenic background sources are important . in conclusion , a lar tpc would not necessarily require very deep underground laboratories even for high sensitivity proton decay searches .",
    "once again , we stress the importance of an experimental verification of the physics potentialities to detect , reconstruct and classify events in the relevant gev  energy range",
    ". this experimental verification will require the collection of neutrino event samples with high statistics , accessible e.g. with a detector located at near sites of long baseline artificial neutrino beams .",
    "in this paper , we have reported our case study for a new future long baseline neutrino and nucleon decay experiment with a 100  kton liquid argon tpc located in the region of okinoshima using the j - parc neutrino facility .",
    "our study assumes a realistic upgrade of the j - parc main ring operation yielding an average 1.66  mw beam power for neutrinos coupled to the new far detector at okinoshima , which would then see the beam at an off - axis angle of @xmath110 and at a baseline of @xmath111  km .    in this first discussion , we focused on the possibility to measure the @xmath1 and @xmath2 parameters .",
    "our strategy is based on the precise measurement of the energy spectrum of the oscillated events , and in particular on the comparison of the features of 1st maximum oscillation peak with those of the 2nd maximum oscillation peak . in order to efficiently determine and study those features",
    ", we rely on the excellent neutrino event reconstruction and incoming neutrino energy resolution , as is expected in the case of the fully - sensitive and fine charge imaging capabilities of the liquid argon tpc .    beyond this case study",
    ", we intend to perform more detailed simulations of the performance of the experiment including for example different sources of systematic errors and sources of backgrounds which have been up - to - now neglected .",
    "the construction and operation of a 100  kton liquid argon tpc certainly represents a technological challenge at the present state of knowledge of the technique . for it to become a realistic option",
    ", we stress the importance and necessity of further r&d and of dedicated experimental measurement campaigns . at this stage , we intend to pursue our investigations on a ton - scale prototype based on the novel double - phase readout imaging method . options to operate small devices in the j - parc neutrino beam are being assessed in parallel . in addition , we have started to address the possibility of an `` intermediate '' prototype , presumably in the range of 1  kton of mass , based on a similar but scaled down design of the potential 100  kton detector .",
