    "the phenomenological analysis of hard diffractive processes has become one of the most interesting theoretical laboratories to investigate the nature and structure of the pomeron .",
    "the concept of pomeron structure function was introduced by ingelman and schlein @xcite as an ansatz to investigate the eventual production of high-@xmath2 jets in diffractive hadron interactions .",
    "such a theoretical speculation has become reality when the ua8 collaboration obtained the first measurements of diffractively produced dijets @xcite .",
    "however , further quantitative analyses @xcite carried out at the cern @xmath3 collider have shown that the predicted rates obtained by the ingelman - schlein ( is ) model were too much high in comparison with the measured values .",
    "the same problem appeared when similar measurements were performed at the fermilab tevatron collider .",
    "the ratio of diffractive to non - diffractive dijets predicted by the is model @xcite for the tevatron energy resulted to be more than one order of magnitude above the actual measurements .    despite the fact that the is predictions about the existence of diffractive jets turned out to be correct",
    ", one might think that this model is acceptable only in a `` qualitative '' sense since the predicted rates were completely off the values actually measured .",
    "let us examine this issue in a more detailed way .",
    "the calculational scheme proposed by such a model makes use of the so - called factorization hypothesis , that is in a reaction like @xmath4 , the whole process is supposed to occur as a sequence of two _ independent _ steps : first a proton emits a pomeron , then partons of the pomeron interact with partons of the other proton producing ( for instance ) jets .",
    "this picture seems to be a sort of straightforward extension of the parton model to diffractive processes .",
    "in fact , it is quite appealing as such , but it is not obvious that the factorization property should apply to this type of hadron interactions ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "a similar kind of problem affects also another class of processes .",
    "experimental results apparently in favor of factorization have come up from the desy @xmath5 collider , the so - called hera experiment .",
    "events of deep inelastic scattering ( dis ) tagged with rapidity gaps , observed and analyzed by the h1 and zeus collaborations @xcite , have shown the same characteristic pattern exhibited by hadron diffractive dissociation processes in the kinematical region where pomeron exchange is dominant .",
    "these observations strongly suggested that , in fact , the internal structure of the pomeron was being probed .",
    "moreover , this pattern , which resembles the peak observed in soft diffractive dissociation , seemed to be independent on kinematical variables other than @xmath6 ( the fraction of the proton momentum carried by the pomeron ) , allowing that estimations of the pomeron intercept were done @xcite .",
    "these were the first results of diffractive structure function .",
    "more recently , further and more precise measurements performed over an extended kinematical region have shown evidences of factorization breaking in the @xmath7 variable @xcite .",
    "such an effect , however , can be understood by an adequate computation of secondary - reggeon contributions @xcite , leaving open the possibility that factorization applies when pomeron exchange is the dominant mechanism .",
    "nevertheless , this conclusion has to be taken with some caution because other forms of factorization breaking , which are not evident from the @xmath7 dependence , can occur .",
    "for the moment , let us assume ( as the is model does ) that the factorization hypothesis is an acceptable ansatz .",
    "this assumption leads us to more definite theoretical questions which were present in the is model from the very beginning .    from a quantitative point - of - view",
    ", factorization appears in the is model as the product of two quantities representing the two - step process mentioned above : ( 1 ) the so - called pomeron _ flux factor _ , which is supposed to give the probability of a pomeron being emitted by a proton ( or antiproton ) , and ( 2 ) the elementary cross section resulting from the interaction among partons belonging to the pomeron and to the other proton @xcite . in order to calculate this elementary cross section ,",
    "the knowlegde of the pomeron structure function is , of course , an indispensable requisite . by the time the is model was proposed",
    "there was no experimental information about the pomeron structure and , thus , only estimations based on `` educated guesses '' could be done @xcite .",
    "today , the hera data of diffractive dis are available and one can try to extract from them the pomeron structure function .",
    "however , this is not a straightforward procedure because the results are dependent on the model one chooses for the pomeron flux factor .",
    "in a recent paper @xcite , we have presented a study on the pomeron structure function in which two different forms of flux factor were employed , one derived from the standard regge theory @xcite and the other obtained from the so - called _ renormalization _ procedure @xcite .",
    "the former assumes factorization whereas the latter implies in a sort of factorization breaking .",
    "we have shown that the quark / gluon content of the pomeron changes significantly whether one chooses the standard or the renormalized flux factor . in the present paper , we apply these results to estimate the rates of diffractively produced @xmath0 s and jets and compare such estimations with the available data .    as we shall see , no one of these models , standard or renormalized , is able to offer a completely satisfactory description of the data , although the latter is partially successfull . in order to overcome these difficulties ,",
    "we introduce a new version of the is model , which is quite intuitive and presents promising results .",
    "although the comparison to data is central to our analysis , we emphasize that no attempt to _ fit _ the theoretical outcomes to the experimental rates or cross sections has been done .",
    "in fact , such an attempt could conceal the problems that we intend to make evident .    the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii , we summarize our procedure to determine the pomeron structure function from hera data and present the parametrizations obtained in @xcite that are used in this paper . in sec .",

    "this feature was observed irrespective of the ( @xmath24 ) values considered and this was very suggestive that a factorized expression like @xmath25 could apply and @xmath26 have shown very clear factorization breaking which , however , can be understood as being an effect of secondary reggeon contributions other than the pomeron .",
    "our analysis @xcite refers to data obtained in a particular kinematical region where pomeron exchanges are supposed to be dominant . ] .",
    "based on this factorization hypothesis and on the is model @xcite , it is usual to interpret @xmath27 as the integrated - over-@xmath21 pomeron flux factor and @xmath28 as the pomeron structure function .",
    "besides our analysis , there are others in the literature that are based on a similar procedure ( see for instance @xcite ) .",

    "an important point to be noted here is that , in the calculation of the soft diffractive dissociation cross section , the minimum value of @xmath7 is @xmath37 , but it is assumed that when one applies eqs .",
    "( [ diflux])-([renorm ] ) to the diffractive dis analysis this quantity should become ( see @xcite ) @xmath38 this distinction is pretty important and will be a matter of discussion in section iv .    with these flux factors ( integrated over @xmath21 ) introduced into eq .",

    "was assumed to be @xmath42 gev@xmath43 and no sum rule was imposed on the parametrizations to perform the fitting ( however , in one of the cases presented below , we use the sum rule to determine a parameter of normalization ) .",
    "details about this procedure and about the results can be found in @xcite , but roughly speaking this analysis has put in evidence three major points :    * the quark / gluon content of pomeron as obtained from hera data via is model depends strongly on which kind of flux factor is assumed .",
    "that means that the issue about ( re)normalization is crucial . * std flux factor favors a predominance of gluons at the initial scale of @xmath26 evolution while basically the contrary happens with the renormalized scheme .",
    "* several different trials were carried out during the fitting procedure . in almost all of them , the initial quark and gluon distributions preferred a hard or super - hard shape .",
    "thus , this analysis has practically ruled out the possibility for soft distributions at initial scale in diffractive dis .    for the present analysis ,",
    "we have chosen two parametrizations for each flux factor .",
    "these parametrizations , the most representative of our analysis , are described below .",
    "* fit  1 * : these parametrizations were obtained in @xcite with std flux and correspond to a combination that we call _ hard - hard _ , i.e. both quark and gluon distributions have a hard shape at the initial scale of evolution : @xmath44    * fit  2 * : this case refers also to parametrizations obtained with the std flux ; the initial distributions correspond to a super - hard profile imposed to gluons by a delta function while quarks were left free to change according to the data ( we refer to this case as _ free - delta _ ) : @xmath45    * fit  3 * : these are parametrizations obtained with the ren flux factor and a initial combination of the type _ hard - hard _ : @xmath46    * fit  4 * : these are also parametrizations obtained with the ren flux factor and a combination of the type _ free - zero _ , that is the quark distribution was left free while the initial gluon distribution was imposed to be null : @xmath47    in the case of fit  3 , it was very difficult to fix the normalization parameter for the gluon distribution ( see @xcite ) . in the expression used here , eq .  ( [ fit3 ] ) ,",
    "this parameter was established by using the normalization obtained for quarks and imposing sum rule .",
    "in fact , it was because of such a difficulty that fit  4 was performed .",
    "all these four combinations of flux factors and pomeron structure functions were applied in the calculation that follows .",
    "as we have seen in the previous section , several possible parametrizations for the pomeron structure function are allowed by the hera data depending on what one assumes for the flux factor .",
    "our aim is applying these parametrizations to calculate the diffractive production rates of different processes in order to compare the results with the available data and analyze the implications . in this section ,",
    "we present the cross sections used to perform these calculations .    the generic cross section of a process in which partons of two hadrons , a and b , interact to produce jets ( or @xmath0 s ) , @xmath48 is given by the standard parton model as @xmath49    in order to adapt such a cross section to a hard diffractive interaction , one assumes ( in the spirit of the is model ) that one of the hadrons , say hadron @xmath50 , emits a pomeron which is made up of partons itself .",
    "the procedure we adopt in such a case is replacing @xmath51 in eq .",
    "( [ gen ] ) by the convolution between the distribution of partons in the pomeron , @xmath52 , and the  emission rate \" of pomerons by @xmath50 , @xmath53 .",
    "the first quantity corresponds to distributions like those discussed in the previous section , that take part in the definition of the pomeron structure function , while the second corresponds to the pomeron flux factor .",
    "in such a case , we have @xmath54 defining @xmath55 , one obtains @xmath56 this is the characteristic procedure that is applied below to calculate the cross section of diffractive processes .      in this analysis",

    "would appear boosted towards negative @xmath64 ( rapidity ) in coincidence with a rapidity gap in the right hemisphere .",

    "the corresponding cross section for @xmath71 is obtained by using the lower signs and @xmath72 ( see the appendix )",
    ".    since the experimental data of diffractive @xmath0 production presently available are not highly precise ( in fact , cdf data @xcite are the first measurements of this process ) , our calculations consider only leading order contributions . in this sense",
    ", we note that studies of non - diffractive @xmath0 production performed with cdf cuts indicate that next - to - leading ( nlo ) order corrections could be around 10% of the production cross section ( see @xcite ) .",
    "however , the experimental information is given in terms of a ratio between diffractive to non - diffractive @xmath0 production , thus the effect of nlo corrections in the final results are expected to be even smaller than this percentage .",
    "the contribution of other competitive processes like inclusive hadroproduction of @xmath73 and @xmath74 ( and respective nlo corrections ) are expected to be very small as well ( about the former process , see for instance analyses by giele _",

    "one gets the differential cross section in terms of the rapidity @xmath64 of one of the jets , @xmath87 where @xmath88 with @xmath89 being the jets transversal energy .",

    "the kinematical limits for the above expression are @xmath94 and @xmath95 with @xmath96 , @xmath97 , and @xmath98 established by experimental cuts .",
    "the process considered now is diffractive photoproduction of dijets , obtained from the reaction @xmath99 in which the positron is scattered at very small angles , implying that the emitted photon has a very low momentum ( @xmath100 ) and can be considered , in a good approximation , as real . in such a context",
    ", the positron acts just as a source of photons that are emitted with a certain energy spectrum .",
    "this emission can be expressed in terms of a  photon flux \" through the so - called equivalent photon approximation ( epa ) @xcite ( or by the best known weizscker - williams approximation ) .",
    "there are experimental evidences that photoproduction processes take place by two mechanisms whose calculation is considered in terms of : ( 1 ) _ the direct component _ , in which the coupling of the photon to partons of the proton is point - like ; and ( 2 ) _ the resolved component _ , in which the photon fluctuates to a partonic structure whose constituents interact with the partons of the proton .",
    "in fact , photoproduction of dijets is one of main processes by which the photon structure function is measured because this reaction is quite sensible to the quark / gluon content of the photon , even in leading order .    in the case of _",
    "diffractive _ photoproduction , according to the is model , it is the partonic structure of the pomeron that is probed by the photon itself ( in the direct process ) or that is envolved in interactions with photon constituents ( in the resolved process ) .    at this point , it is interesting to note that the way by which the is model @xcite was conceived to describe hard diffractive production is in complete analogy to the epa in photoproduction processes . just as the electron ( or positron ) in photoproduction",
    ", the proton in a diffractive interaction is scattered at very small angles and practically does not take part in the effective reaction . in a analogous way to the emission of photons and to the idea of ( equivalent ) photon flux ,",
    "it sounds natural to talk about pomeron emission and  pomeron flux factor \" .",
    "however , the problem with this analogy is that while the photon flux has a well - based theoretical derivation in qed , the pomeron flux factor is obtained in a totally phenomenological way .",
    "this issue is central and will motivate more discussion below .",
    "back to photoproduction , the momentum distribution of the interacting object that comes from the positron vertex ( namely , the photon itself or its constituents ) is given by @xmath101 where the photon emission is described by the flux @xmath102 , obtained in the epa context , and @xmath103 is the photon structure function , with @xmath104 being the fraction of the photon momentum carried by partons",

    "it is clearly seen in fig .  1 that the diffractive @xmath0 production is more abundant for the std flux than it is for the renormalized one in spite of the fact that the pomeron structure function applied to the latter case is much richer in quarks ( see section ii ) .    in table",

    "4(d ) is that the cross section for this case does not include the direct component since our calculation are performed only to leading order .",
    "it is known , however , that in next - to - leading order the direct component presents appreciable contribution for @xmath142 @xcite .",
    "taking as whole , the results presented in tables i and iii , and in figs .  1 - 4",
    "show that the combination std flux factor with the pomeron structure functions obtained from fits 1 and 2 can not describe the diffractive production of @xmath0 s and jets discussed here .",
    "these results are systematically above the data , sometimes by an order of magnitude or more .",
    "thus , a natural conclusion seems to be that the is model with the std flux factor is ruled out by the experimental data .",
    "the other general observation is that the results obtained with the ren flux factor and fits 3 and 4 are in a reasonable agreement with the diffractive hadroproduction data , but the same theoretical scheme fails to describe diffractive photoproduction .",
    "since the renormalization procedure is usually presented as a way of reconciling the ingelman - schlein approach with the experimental observation ( and , in fact , it seems to work in hadroproduction ) , the question is why such failure happens in diffractive photoproduction .",
    "the explanation is in the renormalization factor itself and is given in the following .    as pointed out in section ii , for the case of diffractive dis , the lower limit that enters in the definition of the ( re)normalization term , eq .",

    "even in disagreement with the data , the curves shown in figs .  3 and 4 represent the most favorable situation , which corresponds to put @xmath147 .",
    "if one applies the median @xmath26 , these results are reduced to a really small fraction , five times lower than the curves presented .",
    "this is easily understood from the fact that @xmath148 in this kind of experiment and the smaller @xmath26 is , the larger the normalization factor becomes , reducing considerably the calculated cross section .",
    "we propose here a new version of the ingelman - schlein model that , in our view , seems to be able of overcoming the difficulties presented and discussed above .",
    "first of all , we would like to state that the pomeron flux factor , as it is presently established , is an ill - defined and misleading quantity that can not be supported only by the analogy with the photon flux factor ( which seems to be best justification for it ) or something alike .",
    "the concept is interesting , but its definition in terms of the ( standard ) triple pomeron model leads to wrong results ( as we have shown ) .",
    "maybe , in the future , qcd will provide a rigorous definition for the pomeron flux factor but , at the moment , we see no reason to keep it .",
    "we think that , starting from the idea that the pomeron is constituted of quarks and gluons , what one really needs to _ estimate _ the measured hard diffraction cross sections is a _ probability distribution _ that would connect hard interactions that occur at partonic level to the hadronic level at which diffractive processes are detected .",
    "we propose that such a distribution be given by the _ normalized _",
    "function @xmath149 where @xmath150 represents the single diffractive cross section integrated over only one hemisphere .",
    "the other term is , of course , the differential cross section , that we assume to be known and that is , in principle , in agreement with the experimental data ( that is what the superscript @xmath151 means ) .",
    "let us call this quantity defined by eq .",
    "( [ diffac ] ) , @xmath152 , _ diffraction factor _ since it represents the probability distribution that a diffractive interaction takes place . once the diffraction factor is known , we propose that the cross section of hard diffraction processes is the result of the convolution product @xmath153 in which @xmath154 stands for all the elementary cross sections involved in the specific process under consideration .",
    "operationally , eq .  ( [ sighd ] ) represents what has already been done in section iii , if one replaces the pomeron flux factor by the diffraction factor here introduced , since the convolution product is conceived to be taken in the same sense of eq .",
    "( [ convol ] ) .",
    "( [ sighd ] ) is , of course , reminiscent of the is expression , with exception of the normalization that , in this case , is established by @xmath150 instead of the pomeron - proton cross section , @xmath155 , which is the original assumption ( cf .",
    "however , this small change implies in two important differences : 1 ) @xmath152 is a normalized distribution by construction , and 2 ) @xmath150 is an experimentally observable quantity while @xmath156 is a model dependent one . in order to have a brief form to refer to it",
    ", we are going to call the combination of eq .",
    "( [ sighd ] ) with eq .",
    "( [ diffac ] ) diffractive parton model ( diffpm ) .",
    "now , we intend to show that the renormalized flux factor is nothing but an approximate expression for the diffraction factor @xmath152 . in order to do that , let us turn our attention to the single diffractive cross section as it is given by the standard regge theory , @xmath157 which is known from long ago to violate unitarity .",
    "let us assume that the corrections necessary to make this cross section compatible with the data are ( in principle ) known from some physical effects ( screening corrections , flavoring , etc . ) and that they can be represented by a function @xmath158 , which depends only on the energy , such that @xmath159 function @xmath158 must not be confused with the renormalization factor @xmath160 at this point .",
    "implicit in eq .",
    "( [ hyp ] ) , there is the assumption that the @xmath7 and @xmath21 dependences given by the std model are in agreement with the data and that the real problem has to do only with the energy dependence .",
    "this assumption seems to be supported by the analysis presented in @xcite .    for simplicity of reasoning ,",
    "let us momentarily assume that the pomeron - proton cross section is constant , @xmath161 ( which , in fact , it approximately is ) . from these hypotheses , we can extract two results :    * result 1 : * by replacing eq .",
    "( [ hyp ] ) with ( [ sigstd ] ) into eq .",
    "( [ diffac ] ) , one obtains @xmath162 that is the same expression of the renormalized flux factor , eq .",
    "( [ diflux ] ) , but in which it is imposed that @xmath163 always , that is by definition .    * result 2 : * now , by integrating eq .",
    "( [ hyp ] ) , one gets @xmath164 from which we see that @xmath158 will be the same as @xmath165 if ( and only if ) @xmath166 , and that means @xmath167 constant . from this reasoning , one can obtain the renormalized expression for soft diffraction in two steps : firstly , one assumes that @xmath166 and determines @xmath158 from eq .",
    "( [ inthyp ] ) , and secondly , one replaces @xmath158 so obtained in eq .",
    "( [ hyp ] ) . in the resultant expression , @xmath168 is not assumed to be constant anymore , but a constant factor , that is part of it , is adjusted according to the isr data ( cf.@xcite ) .",
    "let us discuss these results , starting from the second . by looking at the energy dependence of the @xmath167 data .",
    "] , we see two different behaviors : from low energies up to the isr energies , the cross section is clearly increasing , but from the isr to the tevatron energies , it is pratically constant ( although data are really scarce in such a region ) .",
    "the latter is the region in which the renormalization scheme is applied , which is consistent with the above argumentation .",
    "in fact , the energy dependence obtained for the renormalized cross section is really mild , changing very little over a range of practically @xmath169 gev ( see fig .  1 of @xcite ) .    of course",
    ", all of this is valid only under the supposition that @xmath167 follows this almost constant trend also in the empty region between the isr and the tevatron data .",
    "if that is not true and the cross section have some strong variations in this non - observed region and/or beyond the tevatron energy , then the renormalization scheme is not valid for soft diffraction anymore . in this case , it would be necessary a function @xmath158 different from the renormalization factor @xmath160 , that would represent such variations .",
    "but , independently on that function , the diffraction factor given by eq .",
    "( [ diffac2 ] ) ( in other words , the renormalized flux factor ) would remain the same .",
    "therefore , so far the conclusion is : even if the renormalization procedure were not the correct solution for the unitarization of the soft diffractive cross section , the renormalized flux factor would remain valid as an approximate expression for @xmath152 .",
    "the preceding discussion allows us to change the line of argumentation and the way of looking at the theoretical results presented here so as to put in evidence the diffractive parton model given by eqs .",
    "( [ diffac ] ) and ( [ sighd ] ) . from this point - of - view",
    ", we have already shown that the diffpm was able to give a reasonable description of the diffractive hadroproduction of @xmath0 s and jets through an approximate expression for the diffraction factor given by eq .",
    "( [ diffac2 ] ) , or in other words , by the renormalized flux factor .",
    "now we are going to show that , despite the difficulties pointed out previously , it is possible to give a reasonable description for diffractive photoproduction with the same parametrizations for the pomeron structure function obtained with ren flux factor in @xcite , but by applying the diffpm . in order to explain how that is possible , we need to consider the renormalization procedure again . for the sake of simplicity , instead of using the full expression given by eq .",
    "( [ renorm ] ) , let us take for @xmath160 the approximate formulas given in ref .",
    "@xcite , @xmath170 and @xmath171 which refer to soft and hard diffraction , respectively ( @xmath172 and @xmath173 are just constant factors ) .    based on the above equations",
    ", we see that an approximate form for eq .",
    "( [ frdiff ] ) is @xmath174 which can be rewritten as @xmath175 ,   \\label{frapp2 } \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] except for constant factors .",
    "therefore , we see that the term above between square brackets can be reinterpreted as an effective parametrization for the pomeron structure function , in which the @xmath26-dependence comes from both the renormalization factor and the dglap equations .",
    "the term on the left , @xmath176 , represents nothing but the diffraction factor as it is given by eq .",
    "( [ diffac2 ] ) ( integrated over @xmath21 , of course ) .",
    "the above reasoning is a simplification to understand what has actually been done . in summary , we have considered the @xmath26-dependence that comes from the renormalization factor as part of the pomeron structure function and , as such , it has worked as the evolution scale in the photoproduction calculations as well . by doing so ,",
    "we have _ effectively _ established @xmath177 as the unique renormalization factor , which is consistent with the diffpm .    by applying this procedure to the formalism described in section iii - c , we have obtained the results for diffractive photoproduction of dijets shown in figs .  5 and 6 .",
    "in fig .  5 , we show the results for @xmath137 in comparison with the zeus data .",
    "as explained in section iii , these results are obtained by summing up the direct and the resolved components . to illustrate the importance of taking into account both contributions , we show these components for the dashed curve as a hachured area ( direct component ) and as a shaded area ( resolved component ) .",
    "thus , now the theoretical results are compatible with the data and there is no ambiguity whatsoever about how to treat the @xmath26-dependence .    in figs .",
    "6(a)-6(d ) , we show again the results for @xmath112 , @xmath111 , @xmath138 , and @xmath139 , but now obtained with this new procedure of calculation . from figs .",
    "6(a ) and 6(b ) , we could say again that compatibility with data is achieved ( less for 6(b ) ) , but the same does not happen for the data of figs .",
    "6(c ) and 6(d ) . in order to describe the data exhibited in fig .",
    "6(c ) , a super - hard distribution for gluons seems to be indispensable .",
    "such a distribution is very likely to affect also the results shown in fig .",
    "6(d ) , that would tend to become harder , providing a better description for the data .",
    "however , as mentioned earlier , next - to - leading order calculation for the direct component would be necessary .",
    "even not obtainning a perfect description of the data , we think that the combination of these results ( shown in figs .  5 and 6 ) with the results previously shown for diffractive hadroproduction composes a picture from which it is possible to appreciate the possibilities of the diffpm .",
    "we have presented in this paper an analysis on hard diffractive processes with the aim of describing the @xmath0 and dijet diffractive production rates measured at the hera and tevatron colliders . in order to do that",
    ", we suggested a new approach which represents a sort of modification in the ingelman - schlein model .",
    "one ( obvious ) weak point in the discussion presented in section v - a is that we do not make any attempt to determine the function @xmath158 without the renormalization scheme .",
    "furthermore , we assumed that all corrections could be concentrated in this factorized function which would depend only on the energy .",
    "of course , this represents an over - simplification of what really happens , but the spirit was to show by a sort of toy - model that , even not knowing everything about the physics of these corrections , it is possible to find some acceptable justification for the renormalized flux factor within the diffpm scheme",
    ".    the real solution might be ( it certainly is ) something much more elaborate like , for instance , tan s `` flavoring '' model @xcite , the  damping factor \" proposed by erhan and schlein @xcite , or the  screening corrections \" of gotsman , levin and maor @xcite ( or even something else ) .",
    "whatever is the ",
    "right \" solution for the problem of soft diffraction unitarization , the calculational scheme represented by eqs .",
    "( [ diffac ] ) and ( [ sighd ] ) would remain basically the same since it does not depend on the particular model used to describe the single diffractive cross section ( as long as such a model be able to provide a good description of the experimental data ) .",
    "the basic idea underlying our proposal is that the probability of having a diffractive (= rapidity gap ) event in soft or hard diffraction can be represented , in a good approximation , by the same function . in our approach , it is given by the _ diffraction factor _ here defined .",
    "we have shown that , with this idea , it is possible to give an acceptable description of the experimental data for both hadroproduction and photoproduction in hard diffractive interactions .",
