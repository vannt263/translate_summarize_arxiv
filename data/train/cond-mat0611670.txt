    "nanotubes interacting with magnetic foreign objects have been a focus of attention due to the possibility of realizing the technologically promising area of spintronics in molecular structures . the ability to produce sizeable changes in the conductance of a nanotube due to an applied magnetic field",
    "has been one of the driving forces for active research on magnetic properties of carbon - based structures.@xcite due to their inherent spin asymmetry , the interaction with magnetic foreign objects , such as adsorbed transition metal ( tm ) atoms,@xcite nanoparticles@xcite , and substrates,@xcite is likely to cause a spin - dependent response on the transport properties of the combined structure .",
    "@xcite it is now understood that spin - valve effect appears to have potential applications in the development of faster , smaller , and more efficient nanoscale magnetoelectronic devices .",
    "costa _ _ et al.__@xcite investigated the indirect magnetic coupling between two distant magnetic adatoms attached to the wall of a carbon nanotube .",
    "they found that the coupling between tm atoms is mediated by the electronic carriers and is oscillatory for metallic armchair tubes , but monotonic for zigzag nanotubes .",
    "spin - dependent transport through carbon nanotubes sandwiched between ferromagnetic electrodes has been studied recently .",
    "experimental papers dealing with multi - wall carbon nanotubes ( mwnt ) have produced results which differ not only quantitatively , but also qualitatively from one another .",
    "for example , reported maximum gmr values using co contacts have ranged from 9@xmath1@xcite to 30@xmath1.@xcite    the interaction of magnetic atoms with nanotubes may result in a half - metallic ( hm ) system ( namely a metal for one spin direction , but semiconductor for the opposite spin direction ) that is of interest for spintronic devices@xcite as well as nanomagnets .",
    "since some carbon nanotubes are ballistic conductors,@xcite the spin polarization induced by magnetic electrodes ( such as fe , co , or ni ) can be preserved as the electrons propagate through the nanotube . to this end , it has been necessary to know which elements can be best bonded to nanotubes and how they affect the magnetic properties .",
    "based on the first - principles density functional theory ( dft ) calculation , yang _",
    "_ et al.__@xcite found that a cr or v atomic chain adsorbed on a metallic armchair carbon nanotube opens up a band gap for the minority spin states , making the whole system a 100@xmath1 spin - polarized conductor .",
    "the band gaps of minority spin bands were 0.49 and 0.44 ev for v and cr , respectively .",
    "the adsorption of mn , fe , co , or ni chains led to large but not complete spin polarization.@xcite fagan _ et al . _",
    "@xcite studied the structural , electronic and magnetic properties of fe chains adsorbed on swnt .",
    "they discussed several configurations including external and internal geometries by presenting calculated binding energies , band structures and magnetic moments .",
    "similarly , yagi _ _ et al.__@xcite investigated the interaction of @xmath2 transition metal atoms and dimers with a single - walled armchair carbon nanotube by first - principles dft .",
    "they found that co atoms adsorbed at the hollow site of internal wall of armchair nanotubes can show half - metallic behavior .    in this paper",
    "we present the spin - dependent properties of tm ( co , cr , fe , mn , and v ) atomic chains adsorbed on the external and internal walls of zigzag swnts .",
    "we examined how the spin polarization varies with radius of swnt as well as with the type of tm atoms , which are adsorbed according to well - defined patterns ( decorations ) . moreover the strain analysis in radial and axial directions are performed in order to reveal how robust the magnetic properties are .",
    "present work is complementary to other studies , which mainly focused on the metallic armchair nanotubes and predicted half - metallicity.@xcite we note that while the half - metallicity requiring an integer number of spin per unit cell can exist only for infinite and ideal systems , realistic devices can be produced only on finite - size swnts , which are either connected to the metal leads or lie on a substrate . in this respect , the main issue is to achieve a high spin - polarization on a finite size swnt . in order to clarify the effect of nanotube - size on the spin - dependent electronic structure we examined also finite systems .",
    "we have performed first - principles plane wave calculations@xcite within dft@xcite using ultra - soft pseudopotentials.@xcite the exchange - correlation potential has been approximated by generalized gradient approximation ( gga ) using two different functionals , pw91@xcite and pbe.@xcite for partial occupancies , we have used the methfessel - paxton smearing method.@xcite the width of smearing has been chosen as 0.1 ev for geometry relaxations and as 0.01 ev for accurate energy band and density of state ( dos ) calculations .",
    "all structures have been treated by supercell geometry ( with lattice parameters @xmath3 , @xmath4 , and @xmath5 ) using the periodic boundary conditions . a large",
    "spacing ( @xmath6 ) between adjacent nanotubes has been assured to prevent interactions between them.@xcite in single cell calculations of infinite systems , @xmath5 has been taken to be equal to the lattice parameter of swnt and in double cell calculations , @xmath7 . convergence with respect to the number of plane waves used in expanding bloch functions and * k*-points used in sampling the brillouin zone ( bz )",
    "have been tested before analyzing the systems.@xcite in the self - consistent potential and total energy calculations the bz of nanotubes has been sampled by ( 1x1x15 ) and ( 1x1x11 ) mesh points in * k*-space within monkhorst - pack scheme @xcite for single and double cells , respectively . a plane - wave basis set with kinetic energy cutoff",
    "@xmath8 has been used .",
    "all atomic positions and lattice parameters have been optimized by using the conjugate gradient method where total energy and atomic forces are minimized .",
    "the convergence of calculation is achieved when the difference of the total energies of last two consecutive step is less than @xmath9 ev and the maximum force allowed on each atom is less than 0.05 ev/@xmath10 . as for finite structures ,",
    "supercell has been constructed in order to yield @xmath6 vacuum space in each direction and bz is sampled only at the @xmath11-point .",
    "the other parameters of the calculations are kept the same .",
    "the binding energy ( per atom ) of the adsorbed tm atomic - chain has been calculated for each configuration by using the expression ,    @xmath12+e_t[tm - chain ] - e_t[swnt+tm - chain]\\}/n\\ ] ]    where @xmath13 is the number of adsorbed tm atoms per cell . in this equation",
    ", three terms respectively stand for the optimized total energy of the bare swnt , tm - chain , and swnt with adsorbed tm - chain .",
    "all the optimized total energies are calculated in the same supercell .",
    "the spin - polarization at the fermi level , @xmath14 is defined as    @xmath15/[d(e_{f,\\uparrow})+d(e_{f,\\downarrow})]\\ ] ]    in terms of the density of states of majority and minority spin states , @xmath16 and @xmath17 , respectively .",
    "the average binding energy @xmath18 , the average magnetic moment per adsorbed tm atom @xmath19 , and @xmath20 have been calculated for different level of coverage of @xmath211/2 , 1 and 2 . here",
    ", @xmath22 indicates the number of adsorbed tm atoms per unit cell . in order to remove the constraints of supercell geometry and to test the stability further ,",
    "the tm atomic chain - swnt systems have been relaxed after their supercell sizes are doubled ( namely @xmath7 ) .",
    "moreover , in order to test the effects of deformation on the physical properties , we have also studied the cases where the underlying ( 8,0 ) tubes are kept under -25@xmath1 radial strain.@xcite    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]          in addition to the zigzag ( 8,0 ) swnt , we have analyzed the interaction of fe with the ( 6,0 ) and ( 9,0 ) tubes which are chosen as prototype for ( @xmath23,0 ) ( where @xmath23 is the integer multiples of 3 )",
    ". the ( 6,0 ) swnt is metallic due to the dipping of the @xmath24-singlet conduction band into the valence band as a result of curvature effect@xcite .",
    "the ( 9,0 ) tube is semiconductor with very small band gap.@xcite all fe chains ( @xmath22=1/2 , 1 , and 2 ) have magnetic ground state .",
    "variation of @xmath19 with @xmath22 is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig:6x0](a ) .",
    "@xmath22 as well as with the index of swnt ( @xmath23 ) are shown in fig . [ fig:6x0](b ) and ( c ) .",
    "it appears that @xmath25 exhibits similar variation with @xmath22 for @xmath23=6,8 , and 9 .",
    "@xmath26 has comparable values for all three tubes which have different radii .",
    "owing to the curvature effect , @xmath18 increases as @xmath23 decreases ( or @xmath27 decreases ) .",
    "their electronic band structures display also interesting properties . for ( 6,0 ) , the system is metallic for all @xmath22 and shows high @xmath20 except @xmath28 . for ( 9,0 ) , the minority spin - bands just touch @xmath14 and a small gap opens for majority spin bands and system becomes almost half - metallic with perfect spin - polarization at @xmath22=1/2 and 2 . for @xmath28 , @xmath20 is also high in favor of minority spin carriers but system becomes metallic for minority and majority spin - bands .      while the study of periodic or infinite structures in previous sections may give an idea about the behavior of the systems in ideal cases , devices in real applications should have finite size and may be on substrates and/or connected to the leads . to examine the finite size effect , we considered fe - chain adsorbed on the finite ( 8,0 ) tube .",
    "in the first model , we placed fe atoms according to @xmath29 and 1 geometry on a segment of the ( 8,0 ) swnt consisting of 64 carbon atoms and for @xmath30 case on a segment consisting of 128 carbon atoms .",
    "all tubes have open , but fixed ends .",
    "these finite models with fixed ends may be relevant for swnts connected to the electrodes from both ends .",
    "in this case the dangling bonds of free - end carbon atoms are combined with electrode states . since",
    "this is a finite system all the parameters of calculation including supercell size are reoptimized as discussed in section iii .",
    "fe atoms remain stable for @xmath22=1/2 and 1 geometries , but one fe atom is detached from the wire for @xmath30 geometry and is attached to c atom at fixed ends . for a finite but longer system this effect will be minute .",
    "the ground state of all the systems are found to be ferromagnetic with total magnetic moments , @xmath31= 1.9 , 4.0 , and 5.4 @xmath32 for @xmath211/2 , 1 , and 2 , respectively .",
    "magnetic moment per fe decreased with increased fe - fe interaction at @xmath30 .",
    "the results indicate that ferromagnetic ground state will be conserved for finite systems . when the number of states near @xmath14 is compared with tdos of infinite counter parts ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : finite ] ) we also notice some changes in the distribution of spin states .",
    "these changes occur , since firstly , the electronic structure of bare nanotube changes due to fixed open ends .",
    "secondly , the interaction between fe and c atoms at both ends affects the electronic structure .",
    "nevertheless , as the length of a finite - size system increases , the discrete electronic states are expected to converge to the spin dependent tdos of infinite and periodic system . on the other hand ,",
    "the fact that the contribution of minority spin states is relatively larger than that of majority spin states near @xmath14 for @xmath21 1/2 and 2 is similar to their infinite counter parts yielding high @xmath20 .    in the right panels of fig .",
    "[ fig : finite ] , we present more realistic systems for finite - size devices . here",
    "we consider slightly longer segments of the ( 8,0 ) swnt and let the carbon atoms at both ends relax to close .",
    "these segments comprises 96 carbon atoms for @xmath29 and @xmath28 , but 160 carbon atoms for @xmath30 . by adsorbing fe atoms similar to the cases of @xmath22=1/2 , 1 , and 2 ,",
    "we examined geometry and then calculated spin - polarized electronic structure and magnetic moments . while fe atoms remain stable for @xmath22=1/2 and 1 , the fe chain which is composed of 8 atoms for @xmath30 has deformed due to end effects and strong fe - fe interaction . for longer swnts this effect is expected to be minute and in any case the ferromagnetic ground state is conserved with @xmath33 like the stable low doping cases @xmath22=1/2 and 1 .",
    "the energy level diagram of spin states and total magnetic moments of those fe adsorbed needles are strongly dependent on the number of fe atoms , and on their adsorption geometry .",
    "moreover , we see dramatic changes between left panels ( corresponding to fixed ends ) and right panels ( corresponding to closed ends ) .",
    "the spin - polarization and the ferromagnetic ground states are expected to be maintained even after these finite systems are connected to the non - magnetic metal electrodes from both sides .",
    "depending on the character of the contact and type of the metal , the discrete levels can shift and can form resonances . under an applied electric field",
    "these ferromagnetic needles behave as a resonant tunnelling device , as well as a spin valve for different spin directions .",
    "the size of the swnt segment and the geometry of decoration of tm atoms , as well as their type can be relevant parameters to engineer nano - spintronic devices .",
    "this paper presented a systematic analysis for the stability , atomic , electronic , and magnetic properties of tm atomic chains adsorbed on the external and internal wall of the ( 8,0 ) swnt .",
    "for the sake of comparison we also considered bare tm chains by removing swnt .",
    "the effects of coverage , geometry of the adsorbed chain configuration and the size of the tube on the magnetic and electronic properties have been investigated .",
    "we found that all adsorbed chains have ferromagnetic ground state .",
    "the coupling among the adsorbed tm atoms and the charge transfer between adsorbed tm and nearest carbon atom of swnt play an important role in determining the resulting magnetic moment .",
    "usually , the magnetic moment of the free tm atom is reduced upon the adsorption .",
    "we found that high spin polarization at the fermi level can be obtained by the adsorption of v- and fe - chains on the ( 8,0 ) swnt at specific geometries .",
    "the polarization values achieved as high as 90@xmath1 are expected to be suitable for nanospintronic application .",
    "interesting variation of the magnetic moment and binding energy with the number of filled @xmath34-electrons of the adsorbate have been revealed . the dependence of the magnetic properties , in particular spin - polarization , on the radius and band gap of the zigzag tubes are further investigated by considering tm - chain adsorbed ( 6,0 ) and ( 9,0 ) swnts .",
    "the spin - dependent electronic structure and the net magnetic moment calculated for finite - size systems are found to be different from infinite and periodic systems .",
    "our results suggest that these finite size tubes holding tm atoms can be used as a nanomagnet and can perform as spin - valve or spin - dependent resonant - tunnelling devices when they are connected to the metal electrodes from their both ends .",
    "it is demonstrated that the semiconducting carbon nanotubes constitute a suitable substrate to hold transition metal chains and metallic leads to form nanoscale spintronic devices .",
