    "the concept of pseudospin was originally introduced @xcite to explain the quasidegeneracy of spherical shell orbitals with nonrelativistic quantum numbers ( @xmath2 ) and ( @xmath3 ) , where @xmath4 , @xmath5 and @xmath6 are the single - nucleon radial , orbital angular momentum and total angular momentum quantum numbers .",
    "this symmetry holds approximately also for deformed nuclei @xcite and even for the case of triaxiality @xcite . only recently , ginocchio and coworkers @xcite pointed out that the origin of the approximate pseudospin symmetry is an invariance of the dirac hamiltonian with @xmath7 under specific @xmath8 transformations @xcite . here , @xmath9 and @xmath10 are the scalar and vector potentials , respectively . in the non - relativistic limit",
    "this leads to a hamiltonian which conserves pseudospin , @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the spin and @xmath13 is the momentum operator of the nucleon .",
    "for realistic mean fields there must be at least a weak pseudospin - symmetry violation because otherwise no bound state exists @xcite .    already in 1988 bowlin et al .",
    "@xcite investigated whether the symmetry associated with @xmath7 manifests itself also in proton - nucleus scattering .",
    "they evaluated the analyzing power @xmath14 and the spin rotation function @xmath15 under the assumption @xmath7 , where @xmath16 is the scattering angle .",
    "since the experimental data deviate significantly from their prediction they concluded that the symmetry is destroyed for low - energy proton scattering ; only at high energies some remnants might survive .",
    "however , recently , ginocchio @xcite revisited this question within the scattering formalism in terms of pseudospin .",
    "based on a first - order approximation he extracted from experimental proton-@xmath0pb scattering data at @xmath1  mev @xcite the pseudospin - symmetry breaking part of the scattering amplitude .",
    "contrary to @xcite he obtained at all angles a relatively small pseudospin dependent part of the scattering amplitude which confirms the relevance of pseudospin symmetry also for proton - nucleus scattering at least at medium energies .    in the present work",
    "we reexamine the question of speudospin symmetry in nucleon - nucleus scattering and derive an exact relation for the nucleon - nucleus scattering amplitude in terms of scattering observables .",
    "the exact relationship for the pseudospin symmetry violating part of the scattering amplitude differs in an essential way from the first - order expression used by ginocchio @xcite .",
    "using the same proton-@xmath0pb scattering data at @xmath17  mev the exact relationship leads at all measured angles to a significantly increased violation of the pseudospin symmetry as compared to @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , the size of the violation remains within the limits which allow one to consider pseudospin symmetry as a relevant symmetry in nucleon - nucleus scattering .",
    "in section ii we discuss briefly the basic relations between the scattering observables and the scattering amplitude of nucleon - nucleus scattering within the standard formalism . introducing the proper transformation to a pseudospin representation we present in section iii exact relations for the pseudospin - symmetry violating part of the scattering amplitude . a first application of the exact relations is given in section iv where we consider the example of proton-@xmath0pb scattering data at @xmath1  mev .",
    "concluding remarks are given in section v.",
    "the scattering amplitude , @xmath18 , for the elastic scattering of a nucleon with momentum @xmath19 on a spin zero target is given by @xcite , @xmath20 here is the vector formed by the pauli matrices , @xmath21 is the unit vector perpendicular to the scattering plane and @xmath16 is the scattering angle .",
    "the complex - valued functions @xmath22 and @xmath23 are the spin - independent and the spin - dependent parts of the scattering amplitude",
    ". both are not fully accessible to measurement .",
    "the observables in nucleon - nucleus scattering are related to intensities and can be described in terms of the amplitudes @xmath22 and @xmath23 . in the case of the scattering of a spin- particle by a spinless target",
    "the observables are the differential cross section @xmath24 the polarization @xmath25 and the spin rotation function @xmath26 from eqs .",
    "( [ p ] ) and ( [ q ] ) follows @xmath27 .    the extraction of the full scattering amplitude ( moduli and phases of @xmath22 and @xmath23 ) from measurements is a very challenging question in quantum mechanics and intimately related to the longstanding _ phase problem _ in structure physics",
    ", only a partial solution of this problem is required because our interest is limited to the ratio @xmath28 which is a measure of the strength of the spin - dependent interaction .",
    "combining eqs .",
    "( [ p ] ) and ( [ q ] ) provides a phase relation between the amplitudes , @xmath29 where @xmath30 and @xmath31 are the phases of the amplitudes @xmath32 and @xmath33 , respectively . using this result either in eq .",
    "( [ p ] ) or ( [ q ] ) leads to a quadratic equation for the ratio of the moduli , @xmath34 which has two solutions . using the condition that @xmath35 implies @xmath36 one can immediately select the physical solution ( @xmath37 ) , @xmath38 this result together with eq .",
    "( [ phi ] ) yields also the ratio of the amplitudes , @xmath39 these relations are exact at all scattering angles and energies .    for comparison with the recent work of ginocchio @xcite",
    "we evaluate @xmath40 from eq .",

    "( [ absrs2 ] ) is the first - order expression used in @xcite .",
    "it is obvious from the correction factor @xmath43 that the first - order approximation systematically underestimates the quantity @xmath40 .",
    "( [ phi ] ) and ( [ rs ] ) represent important pieces for the proper determination of the scattering amplitude from nucleon - nucleus scattering observables .",
    "in addition one can derive from eq .",
    "( [ ds ] ) with the use of eq .",
    "( [ rs ] ) the relationship , @xmath44 combining eqs .",
    "( [ phi ] ) , ( [ rs ] ) and ( [ a ] ) one can determine the full scattering amplitude up to an overall phase .",
    "thus we have reduced the determination of the scattering amplitude in a system with spin @xmath45 to a problem similar to that with spin zero .",
    "the closed - form expression ( [ rs ] ) for the spin - dependent term indicates the possibility of deriving an exact expression for the violation of the pseudospin symmetry . for this purpose",
    "the concept of pseudospin must be introduced in the formalism of nucleon - nucleus scattering .",
    "specifically , the partial - wave expansion of the scattering amplitude must be performed in terms of the pseudo - orbital angular momentum , @xmath46 accordingly , the partial - wave s - matrix elements @xmath47 must be defined for pseudo - orbital angular momentum ( @xmath48 ) as @xmath49 as shown by ginocchio @xcite the scattering amplitudes @xmath50 and @xmath51 are related to @xmath32 and @xmath33 by a unitary transformation @xmath52    using the transformed amplitudes the scattering observables are then given by @xmath53 @xmath54 @xmath55 + \\mbox{i } \\cos ( 2\\theta )   \\left [ \\tilde b \\tilde a^ * - \\tilde b^ * \\tilde a\\right ] } { |\\tilde a|^2 + |\\tilde b|^2 } \\ , .",
    "\\label{qs}\\ ] ] in the limit of pseudospin symmetry the amplitude @xmath51 vanishes and consequently @xmath56 and @xmath57 @xcite .",
    "therefore the ratio @xmath58 is a measure of the violation of pseudospin symmetry in nucleon - nucleus scattering .    with the transformation ( [ trafo ] )",
    "it is straightforward to express @xmath59 in terms of @xmath60 , @xmath61 and @xmath62 substitution of eq .",
    "( [ rs ] ) in eq .",
    "( [ rps ] ) yields an exact relation for the violation of pseudospin symmetry in terms of scattering observables , @xmath63}{\\left [ \\left(1+\\sqrt{1-p^2-q^2}\\right ) + q\\tan ( \\theta ) \\right ] + \\mbox{i}p\\tan ( \\theta ) } \\ , .\\ ] ] for comparison with the recent work of ginocchio @xcite we evaluate @xmath64 from eq .",
    "( [ qs ] ) . by straightforward algebraic manipulations one obtains @xmath65   \\label{rps2}\\ ] ] with @xmath66 the factor in square brackets on the right - hand side of eq .",
    "( [ rps2 ] ) corresponds to the first - order expression used in @xcite while @xmath67 is a correction factor .",
    "( [ rps2 ] ) and ( [ corrps ] ) are not the best suited for the evaluation of @xmath64 , however , they demonstrate clearly that the actual value of the pseudospin symmetry breaking amplitude may deviate significantly from the first - order approximation .",
    "the relations derived in section ii and iii can be directly used for an analysis of proton - nucleus scattering data , where accurate measurements of the analyzing power @xmath14 and the spin rotation function @xmath15 are available .",
    "specifically , we consider analyzing power @xcite and spin rotation function measurements @xcite for proton-@xmath0pb scattering at @xmath1  mev and evaluate the ratios @xmath40 and @xmath64 .    the violation of pseudospin symmetry can be read off from fig .",
    "1 , where the ratio @xmath64 is displayed as a function of the scattering angle . in fig .",
    "1 the ratios are shown only at those scattering angles where measured values of the spin rotation function @xcite are available .",
    "the corresponding values of the analyzing power have been obtained by linear interpolation of the more complete data set given by @xcite .",
    "the shown uncertainties result from a linear error propagation of the given experimental uncertainties in @xmath14 and @xmath15 . for comparison",
    "the results of @xcite are also displayed .",
    "it is obvious from fig .",
    "1 that the first - order approximation underestimates the pseudospin symmetry breaking part of the scattering amplitude at all scattering angles , particularly at the highest available ones .",
    "furthermore it is interesting to note that the uncertainties obtained with the use of the exact relations are consistently larger than those obtained in first - order approximation .    in fig .",
    "2 the corresponding results are shown for the ratio @xmath40 characterizing the spin dependent part of the scattering amplitude .",
    "as already seen from the exact formulation ( [ absrs2 ] ) the first - order approximation underestimates systematically the spin dependent part .",
    "the difference depends only on the absolute size of @xmath68 and amounts to a factor @xmath69 at @xmath70 degrees .",
    "the application of eqs .",
    "( [ phi ] ) , ( [ rs ] ) and ( [ a ] ) to scattering data is straightforward and yields @xmath71 , @xmath72 and @xmath73 .",
    "up to a common phase , therefore , the scattering amplitude can be extracted from the scattering observables .",
    "we have derived closed - form expressions for the relationship between scattering amplitude and observables in nucleon - nucleus scattering .",
    "the scattering amplitudes can be determined , up to a common phase factor , from measured differential cross section , analyzing power and spin rotation data .",
    "hence the problem of extracting the scattering amplitudes from nucleon - nucleus scattering data becomes mathematically similar to that for spinless particles .",
    "extending these relations we derived a closed - form expression for the ratio of the pseudospin dependent and independent amplitudes .",
    "thus we obtain an exact measure of the violation of pseudospin symmetry .",
    "comparison with the first - order expression of @xcite exhibits significant deviations . using experimental proton-@xmath0pb data at @xmath1  mev of @xcite",
    "we find an increased violation of pseudospin symmetry in the whole available angular range as compared to the results of @xcite .",
    "the increment is up to @xmath74% so that @xmath64 reaches values of about @xmath75 at @xmath76  degrees .",
    "nevertheless it remains within the limits which allow one to consider the pseudospin symmetry to be a relevant concept in nucleon - nucleus scattering at intermediate energies .",
    "the ratio of of pseudospin to spin dependence is actually smaller than estimated in @xcite , e.g. at @xmath76 degrees @xmath77 instead of approximately @xmath78 in @xcite .",
    "this difference is a direct consequence of the remarkable spin - dependence of the scattering amplitude which limits the reliability of the estimation of @xmath40 within perturbation theory . at lower energies",
    "increased violation of pseudospin symmetry may occur @xcite . whether this is true has to be proved by studying the energy dependence of @xmath64 for several nuclei .",
