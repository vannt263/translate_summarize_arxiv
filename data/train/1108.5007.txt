    "electrophoresis has been developed to separate charged macromolecules , such as dna molecules or proteins , based upon their molecular weight for many years  @xcite . in most situations , electrophoresis is performed in sieving mediums such as gels .",
    "this is because , in free solutions , dna molecules can not be size - separated owing to the free - draining effect : the hydrodynamic friction and the molecular charge of a dna molecule are both linearly proportional to the chain length .",
    "hence , the electrophoretic mobility is length independent  @xcite .",
    "this phenomenon applies not only to dna molecules but to any charged macromolecule , or polyelectrolyte ( pe ) . in gels , the mechanism of electrophoretic separation",
    "is dominated by biased reptation of pes and so the mobility has chain - length dependence  @xcite .",
    "one drawback of the method is its low efficiency .",
    "researchers continue to search for new techniques to separate charged molecules more efficiently  @xcite , particularly in micro / nano - fluidics .    recently , netz proposed an idea to separate pes electrophoretically in free solutions  @xcite .",
    "pes are polarized by electric fields and , if the electric field is strong enough , the polarization can induce chain unfolding , which renders a drastic increase in the electrophoretic mobility of the chains .",
    "most importantly , the critical electric field to unfold chains is found to depend on the length .",
    "this dependence provides a plausible manner to separate chains by size in free solutions through an unfolding transition . if the idea could be applied in micro / nano - fluidics , the efficiency to separate dna or other biomacromolecules by size could be improved .",
    "in netz idea - demonstrating work  @xcite , pes were simply collapsed by monovalent counterions by setting a strong coulomb coupling parameter between charged particles . however , this situation is not realistic because the pes are usually collapsed by adding condensing agents such as multivalent salt  @xcite .",
    "coulomb coupling is not as strong as in the simulation work and furthermore , there are several species of counterions present in solutions which compete with each other to condense on the chains .",
    "the distributions of these ions play a crucial role in determining how pes unfold in electric fields .",
    "this is what we will focus on in this study .",
    "when salt is added in solutions , especially multivalent salt , pes show complicated behavior  @xcite .",
    "the addition of multivalent salt can induce collapse or aggregation of chains , which causes phase separation .",
    "an excessive addition of multivalent salt can even cause the separated phases to dissolve back to a homogeneous solution ; the collapsed and aggregated chains reexpand and separate from each other . using these phenomena , researchers are able to control the dimension of dna molecules in solutions and",
    "collapse them into small , very ordered toroidal particles  @xcite .",
    "in addition to the size control , the presence of multivalent counterions can also modify the charge distribution around pe chains  @xcite and lead to a specific phenomenon called `` overcharging '' , where the condensed counterions overcompensate the charge on chain surfaces  @xcite .",
    "the total chain charge is also effectively altered . a simple way to determine",
    "the effective charge is to study electrophoresis of pes in weak electric fields  @xcite .",
    "controlling the charge of pe - ion complexes is an important issue for gene therapy because it is related to the efficiency of dna up - take by cells through endocytosis pathways  @xcite .    in strong electric fields ,",
    "the behavior of pes becomes even more complicated because the charged particles in the complexes respond to the field in different ways , depending on the charge and the sign .",
    "moreover , strong electric fields can change the molecular conformation in ways that are difficult to predict .",
    "the electrokinetics of the system is significantly modified .",
    "it has been demonstrated that dna molecules condensed by polyvalent counterions such as spermine can be decondensed in dc electric fields if the electric field strength exceeds a threshold @xmath0  @xcite .",
    "hsiao and wu considered a coiled chain as an ellipsoidal object of volume @xmath1 and proposed a modification of the scaling law to be @xmath2  @xcite .",
    "the salt valency dependence of @xmath0 has also been explored  @xcite .",
    "the results show that the magnitude of electrophoretic mobility of chain increases significantly above a chain unfolding transition , providing the foundation for chain separation in free solutions .",
    "moreover , the chains can be unfolded to an elongated structure , which can then be utilized in the techniques of single - dna molecule sequencing to increase spatial resolution of detection  @xcite .",
    "pe solutions involve both polymeric and electrolyte degrees of freedom , which brings many difficulties in dealing with these systems theoretically .",
    "molecular dynamics simulations are a simple and economic tool , able to study systems in a controllable way and capture detailed information at the molecular level .",
    "many simulation works investigate the structure of pes in different solution conditions  @xcite and the response to electric fields  @xcite .",
    "however , detailed information about the electrokinetics of different species of ions around the chains is lacking .",
    "since the conformation of chains depends strongly on the concentration of salt in solutions , it is very important to understand the distribution of ions around the chains and see how these ions are affected by external electric fields .",
    "therefore , in this study we aim to investigate electrophoresis of single pes in multivalent salt solutions by means of molecular dynamics simulations .",

    "charged particles also interact with each other via the coulomb interaction @xmath13where @xmath14 is the temperature , @xmath15 is the boltzmann constant , and @xmath16 is the charge valency of the @xmath17th particle .",

    "the electrostatic energy between two unit charges is exactly the thermal energy @xmath22 .",
    "the solvent molecules are not modeled explicitly in the study .",
    "however , their effects are incorporated implicitly through the following three ways : ( 1 ) the dielectric constant @xmath20 , which takes into account of the dielectric screening of charge in the solvent medium , ( 2 ) the friction force @xmath23 , which models the drag acting on particle @xmath17 , proportional to the moving velocity , ( 3 ) the stochastic force @xmath24 , which simulates the thermal collisions of solvent molecules on the particle @xmath17 .",

    "the second , small plateau occurs when @xmath45 is strong and the chain is completely stretched with @xmath135 . in this case",
    ", the number of the condensed tetravalent counterions maintains a constant that is smaller than the globular chain value .",
    "if the applied field is very strong , such as @xmath136 , the tetravalent counterions can be stripped off the chain violently ; as a consequence , @xmath123 decreases .",
    "the two - step plateaus are smeared out when @xmath42 is high .",
    "it is because a large number of the tetravalent counterions appears in the solution , obscuring the boundary between condensed and non - condensed ions .",
    "[ fig : condions_e_sxxx](c ) shows that in weak fields , there are nearly no coions condensed on the chain when @xmath67 . in the high - salt region above the equivalence point @xmath64 , the coion condensation significantly increases .",
    "this is because the effective charge becomes positive , manifested by the inversion of chain mobility as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : mobility](a ) , and so attracts the coions to the chain . after being constant in weak fields , @xmath124 decreases slightly with @xmath45 but then displays a large peak in strong fields .",
    "the peak can be associated with the chain conformational transition because tetravalent counterions condensed on a stretched , elongated chain are more exposed to the bulk solution than ones condensed / wrapped in a unperturbed , coiled or globular chain and hence , attract more coions .",
    "the condensed coions constitute an outer layer of the pe complex .",
    "therefore , once the chain is fully stretched , the increasing electric field can `` blow '' coions off due to the weak condensation , causing @xmath124 to decrease drastically .",
    "the above results show that the ions do not condense on the chain in a universal way .",
    "condensation depends strongly on the ion valency and the chain conformation in electric fields .",
    "the tetravalent counterions compete with the monovalent counterions . therefore , while @xmath123 increases with @xmath42 , @xmath122 decreases . on the other hand ,",
    "the coions collaborate with the tetravalent counterions ; @xmath124 increases with @xmath42 when @xmath66 , following the trend of @xmath123 . the non - monotonic behavior of change",
    "can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : ctotcqc](a ) where the total number of the condensed ions @xmath137 is plotted against @xmath45 at different @xmath42 .",
    "nonetheless , the total charge inside the condensation region , @xmath138 , ( presented in fig .  [ fig : ctotcqc](b ) ) shows a more regular , decreasing behavior .",
    "we regarded @xmath138 as the effective charge and its variation compares well with the behavior of the chain mobility @xmath114 shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : mobility](a ) . by comparing the results of fig .",
    "[ fig : ctotcqc](a ) and ( b ) , we conclude that it is not the number of ions but rather the total charge of the pe - ion complex that is constantly being reduced by the strong electric field .",
    "as we have seen and studied , the pe - ion complex is polarized by an external electric field .",
    "the polarization results from both the migration of the ions condensed on the chain and the conformational change . in this subsection ,",
    "we study how the ion distribution along the chain varies with the electric field and see how this distribution is related to the mobilities of the chain and the condensed ions .",
    "we associate a condensed ion to the monomer with which it is closest , and calculated the mean number @xmath139 of the condensed ions associated with each monomer .",
    "the monomers are indexed by @xmath17 through the chain such that the increment of the index follows the sense of the field direction and not necessarily the position along the chain .",
    "thus , @xmath140 is the distribution function of the condensed ions .",
    "we study four representative cases of @xmath42 .",
    "the first case considers the salt - free solution .",
    "the only ions presented in this case are the monovalent counterions .",
    "[ fig : distonpe_s0](a ) shows the number distribution of the condensed monovalent counterions on the chain , @xmath141 .    in the zero field limit , the @xmath142 curve is flat in the interior region of the chain and decreases near the two chain ends .",
    "the decrease can be attributed to the symmetry broken near the chain ends because there exists no monomer outside the ends and hence the attractive force to condense the counterions is weaker than in the interior .",
    "the whole distribution curve is symmetric with respect to the middle of the chain .",
    "the application of an electric field breaks this symmetry by tilting the distribution curve against the field direction , as shown .",
    "the condensed monovalent counterions accumulate near one end and are depleted near the other , leading to a polarization vector pointing in the field direction .",
    "the curve shifts downward as @xmath45 increases .",
    "since the area below the curve represents the number of ions condensed on the chain , the downward - shifting shows the decrease of the number of condensed counterions , which is consistent with the result in fig .",
    "[ fig : condions_e_sxxx](a ) .",
    "the shape of @xmath142 evolves and becomes a tangential curve when @xmath45 is very strong .",
    "in order to understand the kinetics of the condensed ions , we plot the mobility of the chain @xmath114 and the mobility of the condensed ions @xmath143 in fig .  [",
    "fig : distonpe_s0](b ) .",
    "we found that @xmath143 is basically equal to @xmath114 in the weak fields , which shows that the condensed counterions reside statically on the chain .",
    "@xmath143 deviates significantly from @xmath114 when @xmath45 goes beyond @xmath144 .",
    "this deviation shows that there is relative motion between the condensed monovalent counterions and the chain : the ions glide along the chain .",
    "since the chain has finite length , the gliding means that the ions are dynamically , rather than statically , condensed on the chain .",
    "once condensed onto the chain , an ion glides along the chain backbone and accumulates at the chain end . a condensed ion at the chain end",
    "must then leave the chain to maintain a steady number of the condensed ions .",
    "for the second case , consider a salt concentration smaller than the equivalence point , @xmath145 . according to fig .",
    "[ fig : condions_e_sxxx ] , there are nearly no coions condensing onto the chain .",

    "the results are presented in figs .",
    "[ fig : distonpe_s3](a ) and ( b ) , respectively .",
    "observe that in the zero field limit , the @xmath141 and @xmath146 curves are both flat in the interior and symmetric to the middle of the chain .",
    "when an electric field is applied , the symmetry is broken .",
    "@xmath142 displays a large skewed peak in the interior region of the chain , while @xmath147 shows multiple peaks close to the rear end .",
    "the number of peaks in @xmath147 is 3 for @xmath148 , which corresponds exactly to the number of the tetravalent counterions added at this salt concentration , _",
    "i.e. _ , the tetravalent counterions completely condense .",
    "the distinct peaks reveals that the ions are localized on the chain , similar to a 1-dimensional crystal .",
    "this localization happens when appropriate strength of electric field is applied .",
    "if @xmath45 is weak , the ions can not be localized and the @xmath147 curve simply tilts .",
    "if @xmath45 is strong , they are pushed forcibly to the rear end and only one peak is visible .",
    "similar phenomena have been observed for other @xmath67 .",
    "the peak of the @xmath142 curve appears right after the peaks of the @xmath147 curve .",
    "this non - overlapping of the two species results from mutual exclusion between the condensed monovalent counterions and tetravalent counterions due to their coulomb repulsion .",
    "since the external electric force exerted on an ion is proportional to the ion valency , the tetravalent counterions are pushed more strongly by the electric fields and move closer to the chain end .",
    "the monovalent counterions suffer a weaker force and condense just behind the tetravalent counterions .",
    "we also plot the mobility of the chain and the condensed ions as a function of @xmath45 in fig .",
    "[ fig : distonpe_s3](c ) to study the kinetics of the system .",
    "we can see that the mobility of the tetravalent counterions @xmath115 coincides with @xmath114 in small fields and deviates from it when @xmath69 .",
    "the tight coincidence shows that the tetravalent counterions are tightly bound to the chain and move with it .",
    "the mobility of the condensed monovalent counterions @xmath143 also takes a value close to @xmath114 when @xmath149 but not as close as when @xmath82 ( cf .",

    "[ fig : distonpe_s0](a ) .",
    "the curve tilts , shifts downward , and eventually shows a tangential distribution as @xmath45 increases .",

    "the distribution of the monovalent counterion @xmath141 is not shown because very few of them condense onto the chain .",
    "the distribution @xmath146 is similar to the one at @xmath64 but the curve is shifted upward by a value of about @xmath153 .",
    "this upward - shifting shows that the number of the condensed tetravalent counterions exceeds the number needed to neutralize the chain .",
    "the chain is overcharged , and hence attracts coions onto it .",
    "the distribution @xmath151 tilts when @xmath45 is applied .",
    "the tilting is not toward the front end but rather toward the rear end and looks similar to @xmath146 .",
    "it suggests that the condensation of the coions are , in fact , mediated by the condensed tetravalent counterions .",
    "the condensation of coion is weak because the mobility for the condensed coions @xmath154 is not zero even for the small set @xmath45 fields simulated , as plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : distonpe_s96](c ) .",
    "the negative value of @xmath154 tells us that the condensed coions migrate constantly toward the chain front end .",
    "surprisingly , the number of coions is less elevated at this end .",
    "this suggests that the chemical potential of the coion condensation is higher at this end .",
    "the tetravalent counterions condense more numerously at the rear of the chain , lowering the chemical potential there .",
    "the mobility @xmath115 is identical to @xmath155 when @xmath150 , which once again shows the strong condensation of tetravalent counterions .",
    "the tetravalent ions reside on the chain and move along with it .",
    "the positive value of the mobilities demonstrates that the effective chain charge becomes positive due to the over - condensation of tetravalent counterions .",

    "they do not drift in weak fields .",
    "when an appropriate electric field is applied , the longer chains unfold and gain mobility , and as a consequence , drift away and are separated from the shorter chains .",
