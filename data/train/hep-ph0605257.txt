    "a detailed detector simulation may lead to a reduction of the data samples due to acceptance cuts , quality criteria and resolution effects .",
    "however , the losses may be compensated and the event statistics can be considerably increased by optimising the beam energies ( see sect .  [ analyses ] ) and making use of the beam polarisations .",
    "for instance , the production cross sections for light sleptons , @xmath62 , @xmath63 and @xmath64 , are enhanced by a factor @xmath65 when using right - handed polarised electrons of degree @xmath66 and left - handed polarised positrons of @xmath67 .",
    "concerning the expected  detector performance with respect to detecting metastable @xmath2 there is , however , a caveat . at present , it is envisaged to operate the ldc calorimeters in a pulsed mode  @xcite . in order to cope with the heat production of the electronics , it is foreseen that the amplifiers and read out channels of the detector parts will be switched on and read out just during one bunch train for 2  ms , and then be switched off to wait for the next bunch train occurring 200  ms later ; _",
    "i.e. _ the detector is inactive for most of the time .",
    "such an operation is designed for usual , beam correlated physics scenarios , but clearly has to be revised if one wants to observe the decays of metastable particles . for the iron yoke instrumentation",
    "it does not really seem to be necessary to apply a power pulsing . a quasi - continuous read - out of all channels above a certain threshold over the so far idle time gap of 198  ms appears possible , replacing the @xmath1 decay trigger by software analysis  @xcite .",
    "thus a lifetime measurement will be feasible in any case , may be at the expense of a lower event rate restricted to @xmath2 trapped in the yoke .",
    "the goal to also increase the duty cycle of the hadron calorimeter substantially has to be pursued in future r&d detector developments .",
    "since a direct measurement of the gravitino mass is extremely important , it will be assumed in the following discussion that the technical problems will be solved and the calorimeter will be permanently sensitive with essentially no dead - time .",
    "an independent measurement of the gravitino mass is of prime importance . applying eq .",
    "( [ eq : planckscale ] ) one can determine the supergravity planck scale from the nlsp decay with an accuracy of order 10% .",
    "a value consistent with the macroscopic scale of gravity , _ i.e. _ newton s constant @xmath68 , would be a decisive test that the gravitino is indeed the superpartner of the graviton . at the same time",
    "the measurement of the gravitino mass can be used to yield the supersymmetry breaking scale @xmath69 , see eq .",
    "( [ eq : gravitinomass ] ) , which is an important parameter to unravel the nature of the supersymmetry breaking mechanism .    from the @xmath1 mass and lifetime measurements one can compute the gravitino mass _ assuming _ that the @xmath1 decay occurs with gravitational coupling according to eq .",
    "( [ eq : decaywidth ] ) .",
    "the expected accuracy is again of order per  cent .",
    "this interpretation may be plausible , however , it can only be justified , if there is additional information which confirms the gravitino lsp assignment .",
    "for too light gravitinos a direct mass measurement may not be possible , leaving the nature of the lsp open .",
    "an alternative option may be a spin @xmath70 axino @xmath71 as lightest supersymmetric particle  @xcite .",
    "in such a scenario the @xmath1 lifetime is not related to the axino mass and , depending on the parameters , may vary between some 0.01sec and 10hours , comparable to the expectations of gauge mediated and gravity mediated breaking models . a method to differentiate between these two scenarios",
    "is to study the radiative three - body decays @xmath72 and @xmath73 .",
    "the branching ratios are suppressed by two orders of magnitude and expected to be slightly larger for the axino lsp , the exact values depend on the selected phase space to identify an isolated photon .",
    "more promising is to investigate @xmath74 correlations of the decay topology . in the case of gravitino",
    "lsp the photons",
    "are preferentially emitted collinear with the @xmath75 and have a soft , bremsstrahlung like energy spectrum .",
    "a similar configuration also occurs for the axino lsp , however , there is in addition a substantial rate of energetic photons , @xmath76 , emitted opposite , back - to - back to the @xmath75 direction . such a signature would clearly allow to distinguish between the interpretations as axino lsp or as gravitino lsp .",
    "experimentally the analysis of radiative @xmath1 decays is quite ambitious because one has to discriminate a single photon against the photons from @xmath77 decays as well as against the hadrons in hadronic @xmath75 decays .",
    "the expected low event rates will be further reduced by efficient selection criteria .",
    "hence , large statistics data samples are required , which may be provided by the .",
    "it has been shown in detailed analyses that future  experiments have a rich potential to study  scenarios where the gravitino @xmath0 is the lightest supersymmetric particle and a charged stau @xmath1 is the long - lived , metastable next - to - lightest supersymmetric particle . precise determinations of the @xmath1 mass and lifetime and of the @xmath0 mass appear feasible , provided the proposed detectors will operate at a reasonable duty cycle . a calorimetric measurement of the gravitino mass from the @xmath75 recoil spectra of the decay @xmath3 gives access to the gravitational coupling , _",
    "i.e. _ to the planck scale , in a microscopic particle experiment and thus provides a unique test of supergravity .",
    "furthermore these observations will put stringent constraints on an interpretation of the gravitino as dark matter candidate , being undetectable in astrophysical search experiments , and will allow its relic density to be to computed reliably .",
