    "this evolution generates a flow ( called _ curvature flow _ or _ curve shortening flow _ ) in the space of smooth plane curves that coincides with the negative @xmath0-gradient flow of the length of the curve .",
    "that is , the curve is shrinking as fast as it can using only local information .",
    "m.  gage and r.  hamilton  @xcite described the long time behavior of smooth convex plane curves under the curvature flow .",
    "they proved that convex curves stay convex and shrink to a point as they become more circular .",

    "m.  grayson proved that any embedded planar curve becomes convex before it shrinks to a point  @xcite .",
    "the length , the enclosed area , the maximal curvature , the number of inflection points , and other geometric quantities never increase along the curvature flow  @xcite . on the contrary , we present an example of how the curvature flow can increase the topological entropy of the billiard dynamics inside convex curves .",
    "the _ topological entropy _ of a dynamical system is a nonnegative extended real number that is a measure of the complexity of the system  @xcite . to be precise",
    ", the topological entropy represents the exponential growth rate of the number of distinguishable orbits as the system evolves .",
    "therefore , increasing entropy means a more complex billiard dynamics , which is a bit surprising since the curvature flow rounds any convex smooth curve and circles are the curves with the simplest billiard dynamics .",
    "birkhoff  @xcite introduced the problem of _ convex billiard tables _ almost 90 years ago as a way to describe the motion of a free particle inside a closed convex smooth curve .",
    "the particle is reflected at the boundary according to the law `` angle of incidence equals angle of reflection '' .",
    "if the boundary is an ellipse , then the billiard dynamics is _ integrable _  @xcite . in particular ,",
    "billiards inside ellipses have zero topological entropy .",
    "the motion along the major axis of the ellipse corresponds to a hyperbolic two - periodic orbit whose unstable and stable invariant curves coincide , forming four _ separatrices_. the points on these separatrices correspond to the billiard trajectories passing through the foci of the ellipse .",
    "the interior of an ellipse is foliated with a continuous family of convex caustics : its confocal ellipses .",
    "caustic _ is a curve inside the billiard table with the property that a billiard trajectory , once tangent to it , stays tangent after every reflection .",
    "caustics with diophantine rotation numbers persist under small smooth perturbations of the boundary  @xcite , but _ resonant caustics _",
    "the ones whose tangent trajectories are closed polygons , so that their rotation numbers are rational are fragile structures that generically break up  @xcite .",
    "all these dynamical and geometric manifestations of the integrability of billiards inside ellipses disappear when the ellipse is slightly deformed by the curvature flow .",
    "[ thm : maintheorem ] the curvature flow breaks all resonant convex caustics , splits the separatrices in a transverse way , increases the topological entropy , and destroys the integrability of the billiard inside an ellipse .",
    "the proof of this theorem has two steps .",
    "first , we introduce the subharmonic and homoclinic melnikov potentials associated to the perturbation of the ellipse under the curvature flow following the theory developed in  @xcite . in order to study these melnikov potentials ,",
    "we need several explicit formulas for the unperturbed billiard dynamics that can be found in  @xcite .",
    "second , we check that none of these melnikov potentials is constant , which implies that the separatrices split and all resonant convex caustics break up .",
    "the loss of integrability follows directly from a theorem of cushman  @xcite , whereas the increase of the topological entropy follows from a theorem of burns and weiss  @xcite .",
    "we also find all the critical points of the melnikov potentials , so we can locate all primary homoclinic points and all birkhoff periodic trajectories , at least for small enough perturbations .",
    "finally , we relate the homoclinic melnikov potential to the limit of the subharmonic melnikov potential when the resonant caustic tends to the separatrices .",
    "this is , up to our knowledge , the first time that such relation is explicitly shown up in a discrete system .",
    "similar relations in continuous systems ( that is , for odes ) have been known from the eighties , see  @xcite .",
    "our perturbed ellipses are static , we do not deal with time - dependent billiards .",
    "this paper is strongly inspired by dan jane s example  @xcite of a riemannian surface for which the ricci flow increases the topological entropy of the geodesic flow .",
    "his example is also based in a melnikov computation , although the final step of his argument require the numerical evaluation of some melnikov function . on the contrary ,",
    "our result is purely analytic , since we characterize in a quite explicit way our melnikov potentials using the theory of elliptic functions .",
    "we complete this introduction with a note on the organization of the article . in section  [ sec : billiardellipse ] we review some known results concerning billiards inside ellipses .",
    "the first order deformation of the ellipse under the curvature flow is given in section  [ sec : ellipsecurvatureflow ] .",
    "we review the melnikov theory for area preserving twist maps in the framework of billiards inside perturbed ellipses in section  [ sec : melnikovpotentials ] .",

    "[ pro : homoclinicnotconstant ] let @xmath188 be the dominant laurent coefficient introduced in lemma  [ lem : hatmu1 ] .",
    "the homoclinic melnikov potential @xmath235 is an even elliptic function of order two with periods @xmath69 and @xmath185 , poles in the set @xmath236 and principal parts @xmath237 in particular , it is not constant . besides , its only real critical points are the points of the set @xmath238 , and all of them are nondegenerate .",
    "the series @xmath239 can be analytically extended to a meromorphic function @xmath240 defined over the whole complex plane , see lemma  [ lem : hatmu1 ] .",

    ", we have used that @xmath246 and @xmath247 .",
    "hence , @xmath248 and @xmath204 are the only terms in the sum that have a singularity at @xmath249 , so that @xmath250 therefore , the analytic extension @xmath251 has a double pole at @xmath249 , which implies that the homoclinic melnikov potential @xmath252 is not constant .    finally , the points in the set @xmath238 are the only real critical points of @xmath253 , and all of them are nondegenerate .",
    "this is proved following the same argument at the end of the proof of the previous proposition .",
    "the first claims of theorem  [ thm : maintheorem ] the break up of all resonant convex caustics and the splitting of the separatrices in a transverse way are a direct consequence of the results above .",
    "k.  burns and h.  weiss  @xcite proved that such transverse intersection of separatrices implies that the perturbed system has positive topological entropy , which gives the third claim of theorem  [ thm : maintheorem ] .",

    "we just note that the billiard dynamics inside an analytic convex curve is analytic and that the curvature flow preserves the analyticity of the unperturbed ellipse .",
    "finally , we establish the relation between the homoclinic melnikov potential and the limit of the @xmath45-subharmonic melnikov potential when @xmath254 or , equivalently , when @xmath79 .",
    "we still assume that the perturbed ellipse is obtained by using the curvature flow , so this is a very specific result .",
    "the relation depends on the parity of the period @xmath38 , which is a phenomenon that , up to our knowledge , never takes place in continuous systems .",
    "this is the reason for our interest in it .      the proof is based on the fact that any elliptic function is determined , up to an additive constant , by its periods , its poles , and the principal parts of its poles .",
    "the periods , poles , and principal parts of the subharmonic and homoclinic melnikov potentials @xmath143 and @xmath253 are listed in propositions  [ pro : subharmonicnotconstant ] and  [ pro : homoclinicnotconstant ] , respectively .",
