    "impurity control in magnetically confined plasmas is a very important issue for the development of fusion reactors .",
    "impurity behaviour is a complex problem related to confinement and transport of the bulk ions and electrons in plasma and to plasma - wall interaction .",
    "a very strong experimental effort ( see e.g. @xcite-@xcite ) lead to the conclusion that this process is far from being understood on the basis of the existing theoretical models .",
    "in particular , the experimental results for the diffusion coefficients are much larger than the neoclassical prediction , especially in the edge plasma , showing the presence of anomalous transport .",
    "we analyze here the particular topic of impurity transport in turbulent plasmas using test particle approach . particle motion in a stochastic potential was extensively studied in the guiding center approximation @xcite-@xcite .",
    "it is well known since many years @xcite that , for slowly varying or large amplitude turbulence , the @xmath0 drift determines a process of dynamical trapping of the trajectories .",
    "it consists of trajectory winding around the extrema of the stochastic potential and strongly influences the transport .",
    "important progresses in the study of this nonlinear process were recently obtained .",
    "new statistical methods were developed @xcite , @xcite that permitted to determine the asymptotic diffusion coefficient and also the correlation of the lagrangian velocity and the time dependent ( running ) diffusion coefficient .",
    "it was shown that the trapping process determines the decrease of the diffusion coefficient and the change of its scaling in the parameters of the stochastic field .",
    "these methods were extended to more complex models , which consider , besides the @xmath1 drift , particle collisions @xcite , an average velocity @xcite or the parallel motion @xcite , and also to the study of the collisional particle diffusion in stochastic magnetic fields @xcite .",
    "the conclusion of these studies is that the trapping combined with a decorrelation mechanism determines anomalous transport regimes . in these regimes",
    "the dependence of the diffusion coefficient @xmath2 on the parameters describing the decorrelation is _ _",
    "inverted _ _ due to trapping in the sense that a decrease of @xmath2  appearing in the quasilinear regime is transformed into an   anomalous  increase of @xmath2 in the nonlinear regime @xcite .",
    "all these studies are based on the guiding center approximation for particle motion that considers the larmor radius negligible .",
    "this approximation is not adequate for the impurity ions which can have larmor radii comparable or larger than the correlation length of the turbulence and cyclotron periods comparable with the turnover time of the @xmath1 motion . in these conditions the trajectories have to be determined from the lorentz force .",
    "the aim of this paper is to determine the effects of finite larmor radius on particle transport in a turbulent magnetized plasmas . in particular , we analyze the influence on the trapping process and compare the characteristics of the transport induced by the lorentz force ( _ lorentz transport ) _ with those obtained in the guiding center approximation ( _ drift transport ) .",

    "we show that the trapping exists even at large values of the larmor radius and that it determines a subdiffusive transport , as in the drift approximation , but with a time dependence of the diffusion coefficient strongly influenced by the gyration motion .",
    "then we examine the dependence of the asymptotic diffusion coefficient on the three dimensionless parameters ( see section 2 for their definitions ) that characterize this process and show that several transport regimes appear .",
    "the dependence on the first parameter ( the kubo number ) that describes the effect of the time dependence of the stochastic potential is analyzed in section 4 where two regimes are evidenced .",

    "then , the cyclotron motion with a large larmor radius ( @xmath142 in figs . 2 , 3 ) averages the stochastic field along the trajectory . consequently the guiding center has a very small displacement and @xmath108 is much reduced compared to the drift case . after a period",
    "the trajectories come back near the initial position ( all in phase because @xmath143 is a constant ) , a coherent motion of the guiding centers appears during the passage of the particles and a step in @xmath141 is produced .",
    "thus the evolution of the guiding centers is determined mainly by short coherent kicks appearing with period @xmath144 their displacement is thus slower .",
    "consequently , the trapping appears at later time and the linear increase of @xmath108 extends to longer times leading to values of @xmath108 that are higher than for the drift diffusion .",
    "when the displacements of the guiding centers increase the coherence of the periodic kicks is progressively lost and the peaks of @xmath107 becomes smaller and thicker .",
    "the diffusion coefficient obtained for the lorentz transport is a function of the dimensionless parameters @xmath60 @xmath71 and @xmath145 they contain the physical parameters of the stochastic field ( amplitude , correlation length , correlation time ) and of the impurity ions ( mass , charge , kinetic energy ) .",
    "the dependence of the diffusion coefficient on these parameters is analyzed in the next sections .",
    "we consider here time dependent stochastic potentials and determine the dependence of the diffusion coefficient on the parameter @xmath79 defined in eq .",
    "( [ k ] ) .    in the case of drift transport , a change of variable can be done in the equation for the decorrelation trajectories in order to introduce the time factor of the eulerian correlation of the potential in the time variable .",
    "the diffusion coefficient for the time dependent potential is so determined from @xmath108 obtained for the static potential with the same space dependence in the eulerian correlation @xcite .",
    "the equations for the decorrelation trajectories ( [ 1csis]-[1ros ] ) obtained for the lorentz transport do not have this property : due to the cyclotron motion ( second term in eq . ( [ 1ros ] ) ) , the time factor in the average potential @xmath146 can not be introduced in the time variable .",
    "thus the @xmath79 dependence of the diffusion coefficient must be determined by performing the calculations of @xmath141 for each value of @xmath116    a    b    figure 4 : the evolution of the diffusion coefficient for the lorentz transport in a time dependent stochastic potentia ( red line ) compared to the results obtained in a static potential for lorentz transport ( blue line ) and for the drift transport ( dashed line ) .",
    "however , we have shown in @xcite , using general considerations based on the shape of the correlation of the lagrangian velocity , that at large @xmath79 the asymptotic diffusion coefficient can be approximated by the diffusion coefficient determined for the static potential at @xmath147 ( or in dimensionless units at @xmath148 these considerations are not dependent on the specific type of motion or on the statistical method used to obtain the lagrangian correlation .",
    "we examine here the accuracy of this approximation for the lorentz transport .",

    "4 ( continuous line ) compared to @xmath108 obtained in the static potential for lorentz ( dotted line ) and drift ( dashed line ) transport .",
    "one can see that the diffusion coefficient saturates showing that the transport is diffusive in time dependent stochastic potentials .",

    "however , as seen in fig .",
    "b for @xmath149 the above approximation is valid and so was in many other cases we have considered .",
