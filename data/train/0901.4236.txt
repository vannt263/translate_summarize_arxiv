    "in 1999 , randall and sundrum ( rs ) discovered a new way of reconciling extra dimensions with observation @xcite . in their model ,",
    "our universe is a 3 + 1 dimensional brane living in a 4 + 1 dimensional bulk with a negative cosmological constant .",
    "the bulk solution is locally anti - de sitter space ( ads ) and the direction transverse to the brane is non - compact .",
    "nevertheless , at low enough energy , perturbative newtonian gravity is recovered on the brane at distances large compared to the ads length @xmath5 @xcite .",
    "subsequently , there was considerable interest in examining whether the agreement with 4d gravity extends beyond perturbation theory .",
    "in particular , the question of whether or not the rs model can reproduce the predictions of 3 + 1 dimensional general relativity concerning black holes has stimulated a lot of work @xcite . to answer this question ,",
    "it is necessary to construct an exact solution in the rs model that describes a black hole localized on the brane .",
    "unfortunately , no satisfactory solution has been obtained analytically . numerical work @xcite suggests the existence of such solutions , but only for black holes small compared to @xmath5 , for which one does not expect agreement with gr anyway .",
    "the difficulties involved in constructing such a solution can be understood by appealing to the ads / cft correspondence @xcite .",
    "it has been argued @xcite that ads / cft implies that the rs model is equivalent to a 4d effective theory consisting of general relativity coupled to any matter fields present on the brane _ and _ a conformal field theory ( cft ) , specifically @xmath1 @xmath6 super yang - mills at large @xmath0 and strong coupling , with an ultraviolet cut - off .",
    "the deviation from 4d gr is therefore attributed to the presence of this cft : the expectation value of the cft stress tensor appears as an additional term on the rhs of the effective 4d einstein equation .",
    "a rs black hole solution would be a _",
    "quantum corrected _ black hole solution of the 4d effective theory @xcite . according to this picture , a black hole on the brane",
    "would be expected to emit hawking radiation into the cft degrees of freedom and therefore would not be static @xcite .",
    "hence the difficulty in obtaining , even numerically , a rs black hole solution analagous to the 4d schwarzschild solution has been attributed to the fact that such a solution would necessarily be time - dependent .",
    "however , it has been suggested that strong coupling effects may invalidate this argument @xcite .",
    "one way in which progress has been made is to reduce the space - time dimensionality to a 2 + 1 dimensional brane in a 3 + 1 dimensional bulk . in beautiful work ,",
    "emparan , horowitz and myers ( ehm ) found an exact solution describing a black hole on a 2 + 1 dimensional analogue of a rs brane @xcite .",
    "however , vacuum gr in 2 + 1 dimensions does not admit black hole solutions . from an ads",
    "/ cft perspective , the existence of the ehm solution arises from quantum `` corrections '' due to the dual cft in 2 + 1 dimensions , which turn a classical conical singularity into a regular horizon @xcite . in later work ,",
    "ehm allowed for a negative induced cosmological constant on the brane @xcite . in this case",
    ", they constructed brane - world black hole solutions that reproduce many properties of black hole solutions of 2 + 1 dimensional gr with a negative cosmological constant .",
    "however , large black holes are not localized on the brane in this model and therefore behave rather differently from what is expected in the original rs model .    in this paper",
    ", we shall consider the original rs model with a 4 + 1 dimensional bulk .",
    "we shall make progress by considering black holes that are static , spherically symmetric ( on the brane ) , and _ charged _ with respected to a maxwell field living on the brane . in the extremal limit",
    ", such a black hole would have zero temperature and therefore , in the dual 4d picture , would not hawking radiate .",
    "therefore one would expect a static solution to exist in this case .",
    "finding such a solution is still very difficult since the bulk will depend on two coordinates .",
    "therefore we make an additional simplification , which is to concentrate on the _ near - horizon geometry _ of the black hole . in 4d gr , a static , spherically symmetric , black hole of charge @xmath7 is described by the reissner - nordstrom solution which , in the extremal limit , has near - horizon geometry @xmath2 where @xmath3 and @xmath4 have equal radii @xmath7 .",
    "our strategy is to write down the most general near - horizon geometry for the bulk solution consistent with the symmetries .",
    "the bulk einstein equation reduces to odes .",
    "an important ingredient in solving these odes is _ regularity _ : the bulk must be non - singular .",
    "the einstein equation is straightforward to integrate numerically , yielding a 1-parameter family of solutions .",
    "we then solve the israel junction condition describing the gravitational effect of the brane .",
    "this relates the single parameter in the bulk uniquely to the charge @xmath7 on the brane .",
    "we then have a 1-parameter family of solutions labelled by @xmath7 .",
    "the induced metric on the brane is @xmath2 , but with unequal radii @xmath8 and @xmath9 for @xmath3 and @xmath4 respectively . for large @xmath10",
    ", we shall show that [ eqn : lsol ] l_1 ^ 2 = q^2 - + ",
    ", l_2 ^ 2 = q^2 - +  where the ellipses denote terms subleading in @xmath10 .",
    "hence we have agreement with classical gr for large @xmath10 .",
    "furthermore , from the bulk near - horizon geometry , we can determine an important property of the full black hole solution , namely the entropy as a function of charge .",
    "we find that that 5d bekenstein - hawking entropy is ( taking @xmath11 henceforth ) [ eqn : entropyexp ] s_5 = - ( ) +  , the first term is the usual 4d bekenstein - hawking entropy of an extremal rn black hole ( since @xmath12 in the rs model ) .",
    "hence the entropy differs from the 4d result by a logarithmic correction that is subleading for large @xmath10 .",
    "we can also determine the proper length of the horizon in the direction transverse to the brane .",
    "this is [ eqn : rho0soln ] _ 0 = ( ) + 2 +  hence we find agreement with the behaviour @xmath13 predicted by ehm @xcite using an argument based on the instability of horizons with larger @xmath14 @xcite .",
    "these large @xmath7 results are obtained _ analytically _ by solving the einstein and israel equations at large `` radius '' in the bulk .",
    "the numerical results are required only to confirm that the solutions are globally regular .",
    "recall that , from the dual 4d perspective , our solution is a solution of the 4d einstein equations coupled to a maxwell field and the strongly coupled cft with uv cut - off @xmath15 .",
    "we can translate the above results into 4d language using @xmath16 @xcite .",
    "this gives l_1 ^ 2 = q^2 - +  , l_2 ^ 2 = q^2 - + ",
    ", s_5 = - 2n^2 ( ) +  these results are in agreement qualitatively with previous analyses of quantum corrections to black holes at _ weak _ coupling .",
    "in particular , 1-loop corrections to black hole entropy arising from free conformally coupled fields give a logarithmic term @xcite . ) which is subleading compared to the logarithmic term arising from the entropy in the quantum matter fields . ]",
    "@xcite has studied the particular case of quantum corrections arising from a free massless scalar field to the classical @xmath2 solution .",
    "the @xmath7-dependence of the corrections is the same as we have found .",
    "was @xmath17 , as we have found , but there was no @xmath17 correction to @xmath18 .",
    "this is probably just an `` accident '' that occurs for the particular case of a free scalar . ] in summary , our results are of the same form as arises from quantum corrections due to @xmath19 free conformally coupled fields .",
    "there is no indication that strong coupling leads to qualitatively new physics",
    ".    we can also consider small black holes , i.e. , ones with @xmath20 .",
    "we find that @xmath21 .",
    "the entropy behaves as @xmath22 , i.e. , the same as for large black holes , but with a smaller coefficient .",
    "finally , we note that some of our bulk solutions are asymptotically locally ads , with conformal boundary @xmath2 .",
    "the ratio of the radii of @xmath3 and @xmath4 corresponds to the one free parameter in the bulk .",
    "we have found the only regular solutions preserving the symmetries of @xmath23 .",
    "hence they must provide the gravitational solutions dual to the vacuum state of @xmath1 sym in @xmath2 for arbitrary radii .",
    "consider a static brane - world black hole .",
    "it is natural to assume that the bulk will also be static . in the bulk",
    ", the surface gravity is constant .",
    "hence , by continuity , it will take the same value on the brane .",
    "therefore if the horizon is degenerate on the brane then it will also be degenerate in the bulk . we can take a near - horizon limit .",
    "it was proven in @xcite that the near - horizon geometry of a static extreme black hole can be written in the warped product form ds^2 = a(x)^2 d^2 + g_ab(x ) dx^a dx^b , where @xmath24 is the metric on a 2d lorentzian space @xmath25 of constant curvature ( i.e. minkowski , or ( anti)-de sitter spacetime ) and @xmath26 is the metric on a spatial cross - section of the horizon . in general , the warped product structure is only local , but if the horizon is simply connected then it is global @xcite . in our case",
    ", we are interested in a spherical black hole on the brane .",
    "the topology of the part of the black hole horizon lying on either side of the brane will be a hemisphere of @xmath27 , i.e. , a 3-ball , which is simply connected .",
    "hence the metric on either side of the brane is globally a warped product .",
    "we now restrict attention to a spherically symmetric black hole , i.e. , there is a @xmath28 symmetry with @xmath4 orbits .",
    "we can then choose coordinates @xmath29 so that the near - horizon geometry is [ eqn : bulk ] ds^2 = a()^2 d^2 + d^2 + r()^2 d^2 , where @xmath30 and @xmath31 are non - negative functions . by rescaling @xmath30",
    "we can arrange for @xmath25 to have ricci scalar @xmath32 with @xmath33 .",
    "the bulk einstein equation is r _ = - g _ , where @xmath5 is the ads radius of curvature .",
    "the near - horizon metric is cohomogeneity-1 , so the einstein equation reduces to odes .",
    "explicitly , these are : [ eqn : aeq ] ---=- + = [ eqn : req ] ---=- . adding these equations",
    "gives the hamiltonian constraint : [ eqn : hamiltonian ] + = + + - . in the bulk , compactness of the horizon implies that @xmath34 must vanish somewhere .",
    "we can shift @xmath35 so that this occurs at @xmath36 , with @xmath37 for @xmath38 .",
    "smoothness at @xmath36 requires that @xmath39 has a taylor series consisting of even powers of @xmath35 and @xmath34 a taylor series consisting of odd powers of @xmath35 , with a(0 ) a_0 > 0 , r(0)=1 . if @xmath40 then there is no loss of generality in setting @xmath41 so these `` initial '' data are unique .",
    "however , if @xmath42 then we have a 1-parameter family of initial data for the integration of the einstein equation . note that @xmath31 is monotonically increasing in the bulk : if it were not then @xmath31 would have a local maximum , where @xmath43 , and evaluating ( [ eqn : req ] ) at this point gives @xmath44 , which is impossible at a local maximum .",
    "we have not been able to determine the general solution of the above equations analytically .",
    "however , the behaviour for @xmath45 can be determined by solving using a series expansion : [ eqn : series ] a & = & a_0 + ( + ) + ( - - + ) +  r & = & + ( - + ) + ( + + ) +  some solutions of the above form have been discussed previously . if @xmath40 then the solution corresponds to the metric dual to the ground state of @xmath1 sym on @xmath46 obtained in ref .",
    "@xcite , although it is not written in a manifestly poincar invariant form there . for @xmath47",
    ", we can analytically continue @xmath48 to @xmath4 , giving a riemannian metric of the form discussed by bhm , who proved that the above method leads to complete metrics on @xmath49 @xcite .",
    "we take the brane to have action s_brane = d^4 z ( -- f_ijf^ij ) , where @xmath50 is the brane tension , @xmath51 is the newton constant on the brane , and @xmath52 is the maxwell field on the brane .",
    "we shall set the brane tension to the randall - sundrum value @xmath53 , which gives @xmath12 .",
    "the israel junction condition for a @xmath54-symmetric brane is k_ij = h_ij + ( f_i^k f_jk - h_ij f^kl f_kl ) , where @xmath55 is the extrinsic curvature of the brane and @xmath56 its induced metric .",
    "we assume the brane is located at @xmath57 , so the induced metric on the brane is a product @xmath58 : [ eqn:4dmetric ] ds_4 ^ 2 = l_1 ^ 2 d^2 + l_2 ^ 2 d^2 , where l_1 a(_0 ) , l_2 r(_0 ) are the radii of @xmath25 and @xmath4 respectively .",
    "we assume the maxwell field to be spherically symmetric . by a duality rotation",
    "we may take it to be purely electric , i.e. , _ 4 f = q d , where @xmath7 is the total electric charge : q = _",
    "s^2 f. note that this will agree with the electric charge defined by a surface integral at infinity on the brane in the full ( asymptotically flat ) black hole spacetime .",
    "we shall take @xmath59 henceforth .",
    "the israel junction condition implies that we must keep the region @xmath60 of the bulk , and satisfy the boundary conditions [ eqn : israel ] = - , = + .",
    "we can use these to evaluate the hamiltonian constraint ( [ eqn : hamiltonian ] ) at @xmath57 , giving + = - , from which we deduce @xmath61 , so the metric on the brane is @xmath2 , in agreement with 4d gr .",
    "however , this equation also implies @xmath62 , so the @xmath4 radius is greater than the @xmath3 radius , in contrast to 4d gr ( which predicts @xmath63 ) . note that the geometric interpretation of @xmath14 is as the proper length of the horizon in the direction transverse to the brane",
    "we take @xmath61 henceforth .",
    "our strategy will be to fix @xmath64 and integrate the bulk einstein equations to determine @xmath39 and @xmath34 .",
    "we do this by using the series expansions ( [ eqn : series ] ) to fix initial data at @xmath65 ( we ca nt start at @xmath36 because the equations are singular there ) and then evolve the solution using the second order equations ( [ eqn : aeq ] ) and ( [ eqn : req ] ) . the hamiltonian constraint ( [ eqn : hamiltonian ] ) is used to monitor the accuracy of the solution .",
    "we then choose the two parameters @xmath14 and @xmath7 so that the two components of the israel junction condition are satisfied .",
    "this will give a 1-parameter family of solutions .",
    "we start by noting the existence of two special bulk solutions that can be determined analytically .",
    "first , if @xmath66 we find a , r = ( ) .",
    "the bulk metric is then @xmath67 .",

    "for the @xmath67 solution we find that the israel equations are satisfied if ( ) = 1 , q = .",
    "we then have l_1 = = , l_2 = = q. hence , for this ( small ) black hole , the near - horizon metric on the brane differs from the corresponding solution in 4d gr only through the fact that the radius of the @xmath3 is @xmath70 rather than @xmath7 .",

    "the cft stress tensor can be calculated using the method of ref .",
    "( however , the result is renormalization scheme dependent - it involves an arbitrary constant . )",
    "we expect that similar geometries could be constructed that are dual to cfts in @xmath136 , @xmath137 , @xmath138 , @xmath139 , and @xmath140 , where @xmath141 is a @xmath142-dimensional lorentzian space of constant curvature .",
