    "[ contractible fixed points ] let @xmath0 be @xmath5-hyperbolic with set of generators @xmath6 and @xmath38 its rips complex with @xmath8 .",
    "let @xmath3 be a finite subgroup of @xmath0 .",
    "then @xmath88 is contractible .",

    "a simplex @xmath90 of @xmath38 belongs to @xmath89 if @xmath90 contains an @xmath3-fixed point .",
    "this is the case if and only if @xmath3 permutes the vertices of @xmath90 .",
    "now add all the faces of these simplices to make @xmath89 a subcomplex .",
    "clearly , @xmath89 is an @xmath3-invariant subcomplex and @xmath91 . to show the contractibility of @xmath92 we proceed as follows : let @xmath93 be a finite subcomplex of @xmath89 , and set @xmath94 .",
    "we will show that @xmath41 is @xmath3-equivariantly contractible in @xmath89 , i.e. the inclusion @xmath95 is @xmath3-equivariantly homotopic to a constant map .",
    "this implies that @xmath96 for @xmath97 .",
    "since @xmath92 is simplicial ( after two barycentric subdivisions ) , this is all we need to prove .",
    "by lemma [ small orbits ] we can find a vertex @xmath65 with @xmath98 .",
    "hence @xmath99 , i.e. @xmath89 is not empty . without loss of generality",
    "we can assume that @xmath100 .",
    "let @xmath101 denote the finite set of vertices of @xmath41 .",
    "we distinguish two cases :    * @xmath102 .",
    "then @xmath101 spans an @xmath3-invariant simplex @xmath90 that contains a fixed point .",
    "any @xmath3-equivariant contraction of @xmath90 to this fixed point will also contract @xmath41 in @xmath90 .",
    "* @xmath103 .",
    "let @xmath104 be a point furthest away from @xmath65 , i.e. @xmath105 + let @xmath106 be the point on a geodesic @xmath107 $ ] with @xmath108 next , we want to define the function @xmath109 notice that @xmath3 acts freely on @xmath101 , hence the first part of the definition of @xmath110 makes sense .",
    "we have to verify two more things to know that this function is well - defined .",
    "first that @xmath111 .",
    "this follows from the fact that @xmath112 , but @xmath113 . secondly , that @xmath114 .",
    "we will show this by proving @xmath115 .",
    "then , by definition of @xmath89 , we have @xmath114 .",
    "again , we have to look at two cases : * * @xmath116 : then we have by the triangle inequality @xmath117 hence @xmath115 . * * @xmath118 : since @xmath119 we know that @xmath120 .",
    "thus we can apply lemma [ small orbits](a ) to @xmath121 to obtain a vertex @xmath27 with orbit @xmath44 satisfying @xmath122 and @xmath123 since we have @xmath124 and @xmath125 by the choice of @xmath60 , lemma [ small orbits](b ) also gives @xmath126 hence , applying hyperbolicity to the points @xmath127 we get : @xmath128 the last estimation holds because we assumed @xmath129 , hence @xmath130 \\geq 4 \\delta + 1 $ ] .",
    "now we can again use the triangle inequality : @xmath131 and we get @xmath115 .",
    "+ now that we know that @xmath132 is well defined we claim : + * claim : * @xmath132 can be extended to a simplicial map @xmath133 .",
    "+ we have to show that for @xmath134 , @xmath135 implies @xmath136 . since we only moved the orbit of @xmath60 , there is only one non - trivial case to check , the implication : @xmath137 because of the left - invariance of the metric ( replace @xmath28 by @xmath138 ) this is equivalent to : @xmath139 applying hyperbolicity to @xmath140 we get @xmath141 since @xmath129 implies @xmath142 .",
    "+ now @xmath110 is by definition an @xmath3-equivariant map .",
    "it remains to show that @xmath110 is @xmath3-homotopic to the inclusion map .",
    "but this follows by noticing that for any simplex @xmath90 of @xmath41 the set @xmath143 is contained in a simplex of @xmath89 .",
    "this is clear except for the case where one point is in the orbit of @xmath106 , but then it follows from implication ( [ last ] ) .",
    "+ finally for each @xmath144 we have @xmath145 since @xmath146 , so that @xmath147 . therefore",
    ", the whole orbit of @xmath60 is moved closer to @xmath65 .",
    "+ continuing this process on the finite complex @xmath148 and iterating finitely many times leads to a finite subcomplex that will satisfy case  ( i ) .",
    "this ends the proof .",
    "since @xmath1 is a second barycentric subdivision of a simplicial complex with a simplicial @xmath0-action , @xmath1 is by @xcite a @xmath0-@xmath9-complex .",
    "theorem [ rips](i ) states that all stabilizers are finite , ( iii ) proves that @xmath1 is finite as @xmath0-@xmath9-complex .",
