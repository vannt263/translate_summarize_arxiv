    "when and how was the universe reionized ?",
    "these questions have actively been studied almost purely by theoretical means ( see @xcite for recent reviews ) , as currently there are only a very few observational probes of the epoch of reionization : the gunn  peterson test @xcite , polarized light of the cosmic microwave background on large angular scales @xcite , which has been detected by the _ wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe _ ( _ wmap _ ) @xcite , and temperature of the intergalactic medium @xcite . over the next decades",
    ", we are hoping to detect the first sources of light directly with the next generation of space telescopes , such as the _ james  webb space telescope _ ( _ jwst _ ) .",
    "more ambitious are mapping observations and measurements of the power spectrum of fluctuations of the 21-cm line background from neutral hydrogen atoms during reionization @xcite or even prior to reionization @xcite , which offer very powerful probes of detailed history of the cosmic reionization .",
    "it has been pointed out that the mean intensity @xcite as well as fluctuations @xcite of the near infrared background potentially offer yet another window to the epoch of reionization .",
    "the logic is very simple : suppose that most of reionization occurred at , say , @xmath9 .",
    "the ultraviolet photons ( @xmath10 ) produced at @xmath9 during reionization will then be redshifted to the near infrared regime ( @xmath11 ) .",
    "in other words , a fraction of the near infrared background ( whether or not observable ) _ must come from the epoch of reionization _ , and there is no question about the existence of the signal .",
    "( of course the existence of the signal does not immediately imply that the signal is actually significant . )",
    "it is therefore extremely important to understand the near infrared background in the context of redshifted uv photons and examine to what extent it is relevant to and useful for understanding the physics of cosmic reionization .",
    "has it been detected ?",
    "all of the theoretical proposals were essentially motivated by the current measurements of the near infrared background , which suggests the existence of an isotropic background after subtraction of the zodiacal emission @xcite .",
    "since the zodiacal emission is @xmath12 times as large as the inferred isotropic component , one should generally be careful when interpreting the data . although the inferred background is isotropic at the first order , significant fluctuations still remain at the level of @xmath13 @xcite , which requires further explanations .",
    "the most intriguing feature of the current observational data is that the inferred background seems too large to be accounted for by the integrated light from galaxies ( @xcite , see also figure  12 of @xcite and references therein for the compilation of the galactic contribution ) .",
    "it is thus tempting to speculate that the bulk of the near infrared background ( aside from the zodiacal light ) actually comes from stellar sources at the epoch of reionization .    in this paper , we carefully examine the near infrared background from early stars .",
    "while our approach is similar to that of @xcite , which has been adopted by most of the subsequent work , our goal is to ( 1 ) simplify physics and improve calculations , ( 2 ) explore different metallicity and initial mass spectra , ( 3 ) understand robustness of theoretical predictions , and ( 4 ) provide a simple relation between the cosmic near infrared background and star formation rate .",
    "the focus of this paper is the mean intensity : we will discuss fluctuations in the forthcoming paper ( fernandez et al .",
    ", in preparation ) .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in   [ sec : formalism ] , we develop the basic formalism and summarize relevant emission processes such as stellar emission and reprocessed light , the latter including lyman-@xmath14 , two - photon , free - free and free - bound emission . in   [ sec : energy ] , we examine energy spectra of various emission processes from early stars . in particular",
    "we explore differences in the energy spectrum between various assumptions about metallicity and initial mass spectrum of early stars . in   [ sec : irb ] , we calculate the spectrum of the cosmic near infrared background . in   [ sec : sfr ] , we compare the prediction to the current observational data and discuss implications for the star formation rate at @xmath5 . in ",
    "[ sec : metals ] , constraints from metal production from the first stars are calculated . in   [ sec : remarks ] we discuss the other constraints from a collapse fraction of dark matter halos .",
    "we conclude in   [ sec : conclusion ] .",
    "we calculate the background intensity , @xmath15 , as @xcite @xmath16\\nu , z)}{h(z ) ( 1+z ) } , \\label{eq - inu - generic}\\ ] ] where @xmath17 is an observed frequency ( which is in the near infrared band : for @xmath18 , say , @xmath19 or @xmath20 ) , @xmath21 is the expansion rate at redshift @xmath22 ( @xmath23^{-1}$ ] ) , and @xmath24 is the volume emissivity in units of energy per unit time , unit frequency and unit _ comoving _ volume .",
    "there are several contributions to the emissivity .",
    "one is the continuum emission from stars themselves , @xmath25 , which is nearly a black body spectrum , and the others are reprocessed light of ionizing radiation : a star ionizes neutral gas in its neighborhood and a series of recombination lines , @xmath26 , emerge .",
    "the ionized gas ( or nebula ) also emits free - free and free - bound continuum emission , @xmath27 , as well as two - photon emission , @xmath28 . in appendix",
    "[ sec : emissivity ] , we derive the formula for the volume emissivity as ( eq .  [ [ eq : p ] ] ) @xmath29 where @xmath30 ,    \\label{eq : avg}\\ ] ] and @xmath31 is a mass spectrum ( specified later in   [ sec : imf ] ; for the precise definition , see appendix  [ sec : emissivity ] ) , and @xmath32 is the mean stellar mass ( eq .  [",
    "[ eq : mstar ] ] ) .",
    "it is important to note that this formula has been derived assuming that the stellar main - sequence lifetime , @xmath33 , is shorter than the hubble time , and corrected for dead stars which do not contribute to the volume emissivity . here",
    ", @xmath34 is a time - averaged luminosity ( over the main - sequence lifetime ) in frequency interval [ @xmath17 , @xmath35 for a radiative process of @xmath14 , and @xmath36 is the key dimensionless quantity which represents a ratio of the _ mass - weighted _ average to denote the mass - weighted average .",
    "] of total radiative energy ( including stellar emission and reprocessed light ) to the stellar rest mass energy , in unit frequency interval . in other words",
    ", @xmath36 represents the mass - weighted mean radiative efficiency of stars .",
    "this formulation is useful as one can immediately see that each contribution is simply given by the star formation rate ( which depends on @xmath22 ) and a typical radiative efficiency ( which does not depend on @xmath22 ) . while @xmath4 is very uncertain and",
    "will be constrained by a comparison to the observational data , one can calculate @xmath37 robustly for a given population of stars using simple physical arguments .",
    "it will be shown in the subsequent sections that @xmath38 is always of order @xmath39 when averaged over the main - sequence lifetime , which can be understood with simple energetics .",
    "initially , energy must be generated by nuclear burning in stars .",
    "while the rest mass energy of @xmath40 is as big as @xmath41 , only a fraction will go into radiative energy .",
    "for example , in the sun only 0.07% of the rest mass energy is converted to radiative energy over its main - sequence lifetime . the nuclear burning efficiency . ]",
    "depends on stellar mass only weakly at large masses .",
    "our detailed calculations below confirm this simple argument , and thus the uncertainty in the predicted amplitude of radiative efficiency is small for a given mass spectrum of stars .",
    "using the expected radiative efficiency of stars , we obtain @xmath42 \\sum_\\alpha\\frac{(\\nu y )   \\langle \\epsilon^\\alpha_{(\\nu y ) } \\rangle}{10^{-3 } } , \\label{eq - inu - order}\\ ] ] where @xmath43 and @xmath44 for the redshift range of interest .",
    "thus , without any detailed calculations , one can show that the cosmic near infrared background from early stars at @xmath0 should be approximately given by @xmath45 where @xmath4 is in units of @xmath46 .      to simplify calculations ,",
    "we assume that the stellar spectrum is a black body with the lyman continuum photons completely absorbed : @xmath47 , & h\\nu<13.6~{\\rm ev } \\\\    0 , &    h\\nu\\ge 13.6~{\\rm ev }    \\end{array }           \\right.\\ ] ] where @xmath48 is a stellar radius and @xmath49 is the effective temperature , and @xmath50 $ ] is a black body spectrum given by @xmath51= \\frac{2h\\nu^3/c^2}{\\exp(h\\nu / kt)-1}.\\ ] ] note that the stellar spectrum ( before absorption ) above 13.6  ev ( which determines the number of hydrogen - ionizing photons ) is significantly different from a black body ; thus , we do not use a black - body spectrum to calculate the number of ionizing photons , but use more detailed calculations by @xcite ( see   [ sec : metallicity ] ) .",
    "the stellar spectrum just below 13.6  ev is also different from a black body because of a cluster of absorption lines of lyman series ; however , we ignore this effect and keep our calculations as simple as possible .",
    "( one can always use a more precise stellar spectrum for a better accuracy . )",

[ 5 - 14 ] of @xcite with @xmath57 and @xmath58 ) given by @xmath59 and @xmath60 is a dimensionless function of temperature tabulated in table  5.2 of @xcite .",
    "here , @xmath61 denotes gas temperature in units of kelvin . in principle , to calculate @xmath61 one has to equate the energy gain and loss to find out equilibrium temperature . while @xmath61 varies depending on stellar temperature ( or hardness of a stellar spectrum which determines photo - heating ) , we shall assume @xmath62 regardless of the stellar temperature , which should be a good approximation for our purposes .",
    "for this temperature we find @xmath63 .",
    "the quantity @xmath64 is the volume of the strmgren sphere ( see text below eq .",
    "[ [ eq : ffbf ] ] ) , and @xmath65 is the total volume emissivity including free - free and free - bound emission ( eq .

    "note that we have ignored the helium contribution and assumed complete ionization for computing @xmath67 . as a free - bound transition to @xmath74 will not be considered in the case - b recombination , the summation is taken from @xmath57 .",
    "( this is because all photons that recombine directly to @xmath74 are strongly absorbed by neighboring hydrogen atoms and immediately ionize them . )",
    "we then obtain @xmath75   \\left[\\overline{g}_{ff}+\\frac{ry}{kt_g}\\sum_{n=2}^\\infty   \\frac{e^{ry/(kt_gn^2)}}{n^3}g_{fb}(n)\\right ]   \\phi_2(t_g ) e^{-h\\nu / kt_g}. \\label{eq : ffbf}\\ ] ] the continuum luminosity does not depend on the number density of electrons or protons .",
    "this is an immediate consequence of the strmgren sphere : while the higher number density implies the larger emissivity , it also implies the larger recombination rate and the smaller ionized region .",
    "these two effects cancel out exactly , making luminosity independent of the number density .",
    "of course , this approximation breaks down in the intergalactic medium ( outside of halos ) in which ionization fronts do not fill the strmgren sphere @xcite .",
    "our calculation assuming the strmgren sphere is accurate if the bulk of luminosity comes from nebulae around stars inside the host halos , while it should give a robust upper limit on free - free and free - bound luminosity otherwise .    finally , we need to compute the gaunt factors . for the parameter space",
    "we are interested in , @xmath76 both gaunt factors are approximately constant and given by @xcite @xmath77 which are accurate to within 10% .      the line luminosity is given by @xmath78 where @xmath79 is the line profile and @xmath80 is a photon production rate at a line @xmath81 . since the intergalactic medium is optically thick to the lyman continuum photons before the end of reionization , every single hydrogen - ionizing photon will be absorbed and converted to line emission ; thus , the line contribution should be proportional to a production rate of hydrogen - ionizing photons , @xmath82 , as @xmath83 where @xmath84 is a fraction of ionizing photons which are converted to a line @xmath81 .    which lines are important to the near infrared background ?",
    "the lyman series photons are in right bands ; however , they are strongly absorbed and eventually converted to other lines .",
    "one exception is the lyman-@xmath14 photons : while they are also strongly absorbed , they are re - emitted back again in lyman-@xmath14",
    ". therefore the net effect is that the lyman-@xmath14 photons are not destroyed ( in the absence of dust ) but merely scattered .",
    "@xcite have shown that as the universe expands the lyman-@xmath14 photons are eventually `` redshifted out '' of scattering and escape freely .",
    "the balmer series photons ( and others ) have too low an energy to be relevant to the near infrared background ( a direct recombination to @xmath57 results in a line at 3.4  ev or 3648   , which will be redshifted to @xmath85 and is thus irrelevant ) .",
    "therefore , we consider only lyman-@xmath14 photons : @xmath86 \\nu_{ly\\alpha}\\phi(\\nu-\\nu_{ly\\alpha } ) ,    \\label{eq : lya}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath87 , @xmath88 , and @xmath89 .",
    "note that @xmath88 was derived as follows : every hydrogen - ionizing photon results in a @xmath90 transition .",
    "( this is because every electron that goes directly to the ground state from @xmath91 emits lyman - series photons which are strongly absorbed , creating another excited atom , and this process repeats until all electrons end up in @xmath57 state . )",
    "about 2/3 of the time a @xmath90 transition creates a lyman-@xmath14 photon via @xmath92 transition and about 1/3 of the time it emits continuum emission via 2-photon decay of @xmath93 .",
    "the precise value of @xmath94 depends slightly on the temperature of gas , and for a gas at 20,000 k the value of @xmath94 is 0.64 @xcite .",
    "finally , we ignore helium recombination lines as their flux is at most 6% of the hydrogen - ionizing flux even for metal - free stars ( see table  1 and 4 of @xcite ) . as for a line profile ,",
    "we take it to be a delta function : @xmath95 this is an excellent approximation as we are interested in the background intensity which is integrated over a broad range of redshifts .",
    "if we are , on the other hand , interested in a spectrum of individual objects with fine spectral resolution , more accurate calculations are required @xcite . we have confirmed validity of our approximation by comparing the resulting spectrum with and without the exact line profile taken into account .",
    "it should be emphasized that the escape fraction , a fraction of ionizing photons escaping from nebula , does not alter luminosity of lyman-@xmath14 very much .",
    "this is because all of the ionizing photons will eventually be converted to lyman-@xmath14 photons which , in turn , will escape freely via the cosmological redshift .",
    "therefore , our prediction is free from uncertainty in the escape fraction . in other words",
    ", we do not care where those lyman-@xmath14 photons come from as far as the mean intensity is concerned .",
    "if most of the ionizing photons escape from nebulae , lyman-@xmath14 photons should come from the intergalactic medium ( but not too far away from nebulae ; otherwise , the lyman-@xmath14 signal would be spread over a large frequency range and the signal would be suppressed ) .",
    "if none of the ionizing photons escape , lyman-@xmath14 photons should come from nebulae . in both cases , the resulting flux in lyman-@xmath14 should be about the same .",
    "luminosity of 2-photon emission is given by @xmath96     \\frac{\\nu~p(\\nu/\\nu_{ly\\alpha})}{\\nu_{ly\\alpha}/2 } ,     \\label{eq : twophoton}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath97 is the normalized probability per 2-photon decay of getting one photon in the range @xmath98 .",
    "this formula is easily understood : again , every single ionizing photon results in a @xmath90 transition , and @xmath99 ( more precisely 0.36 for @xmath100  k ) of time it emits 2 photons via 2-photon decay .",
    "( therefore there is a factor of 2 multiplying @xmath101 . )",

    "( this fitting formula gives @xmath106 . )",
    "in order to calculate a typical spectrum of radiative efficiency , @xmath107 ( eq .  [ [ eq : avg ] ] ) , one needs to specify the mass spectrum of stars , @xmath31 , which determines the mean stellar mass of star formation .",
    "( for the precise definition of @xmath31 , see appendix  [ sec : emissivity ] . )",
    "this is important because , depending on which mass is the most typical one , hardness of the emerging stellar spectrum changes significantly .",
    "( hardness affects the ratio of energy in lyman-@xmath14 to that in stellar continuum . ) unfortunately , since we have very little knowledge of @xmath31 for early stars , we are not able to estimate the proper error that would result in changing @xmath31 . while we try to explore a range of models for @xmath31 , one should keep in mind that our exploration of the form of @xmath31 is not exhaustive .",
    "we use three different mass spectra : ( a ) salpeter @xcite : @xmath108 and ( b ) larson @xcite : @xmath109 which matches salpeter s in the limit of @xmath110 , and one can explore a variety of models by changing one parameter , @xmath111 .",

    "in the previous work on the near infrared background from early stars @xcite , it was concluded that a substantial fraction of _ collapsed _ baryons in the universe must have been converted into stars . in   [ sec : sfr2 ] we have considered a fraction of _ all _ baryons in the universe that was locked up in stars at a given @xmath22 , and now it is natural for us to ask how many baryons collapsed in dark matter halos were converted into stars .",

    "we have shown that this does not exclude the stellar origin of the cosmic near infrared background , as it merely requires more than 0.0160.49% of baryons to be processed in stars at any given time between @xmath188 and 15 ( depending on metallicity and initial mass spectrum ; see table  [ tab : generation ] ) .",
    "such a high star formation rate at high @xmath22 may be consistent with recent theoretical proposals @xcite .",

    "for example , @xmath198 , the salpeter mass spectrum , is independent of time . in principle , however , @xmath31 may depend on time when there is a characteristic stellar mass scale ( e.g. , larson s mass spectrum ) that increases or decreases with time .",
    "one may expect @xmath111 to decrease as the metal enrichment proceeds , for example .",
    "nevertheless , we shall assume that @xmath111 is independent of time , at least for the redshift range that we consider .",
    "we may use the comoving mass density of stars , @xmath199 , instead of the comoving number density , @xmath200 .",

    "and therefore they did not correct their emissivity for dead stars .",
    "now , we correct emissivity for dead stars by simply removing them from @xmath200 : @xmath205 where @xmath206 is a rate of star formation , @xmath207 is the time between when the universe started forming stars and the time corresponding to @xmath22 , and @xmath33 is a stellar main - sequence lifetime .",
    "[ [ eq : org ] ] then becomes @xmath208 this result may be simplified when the stellar lifetime is much shorter than @xmath207 ( which is about the same as the age of the universe at @xmath22 ) . as we have shown in figure  1 ,",

    "a popular assumption usually made for an analytical model of the cosmic star formation rate at high @xmath22 is that @xmath154 is related to the mass function of dark matter halos : @xmath222}{\\partial z},\\ ] ] where @xmath223 is the present - day mean baryon density , and @xmath169 represents a `` star formation efficiency '' , a constant fraction of baryonic gas in dark matter halos that was converted into stars .",
    "it is admittedly too simplistic to assume that @xmath169 is independent of halo mass or redshift .",
    "for example , negative feedback from a star forming in a single mini - halo might prevent the formation of multiple stars in the same halo , which would imply @xmath224 .",
    "therefore , this parameterization of the efficiency serves merely as an order - of - magnitude representation of the true efficiency .",
