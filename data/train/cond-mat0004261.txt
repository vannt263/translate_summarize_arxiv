    "periodic elastic media arise in a surprising array of problems , including spin or charge density waves ; flux line lattices ; and random magnets . a model frequently used@xcite to describe a manifold , defined by the single valued height variable @xmath14 in a periodic elastic medium is @xmath15 ^ 2 + \\eta[h(\\vec{r } ) ] + v_p[h(\\vec{r } ) ] \\right\\ } , \\label{eq_pem}\\ ] ] where @xmath16 is a periodic potential in the height direction and the random potential @xmath17 is not periodic .",
    "this is directly analogous to the model used to study lattice effects in thermal roughening and in field theoretic studies of commensurate phases in ising magnets with competing interactions . in the model ( [ eq_pem ] ) ,",
    "the periodic potential is non - random and tends to pin the interface while the quenched random pinning @xmath18 $ ] prefers to make the interface wander .",
    "the surface tension term @xmath19 ^ 2 $ ] seeks a flat interface and also competes with the quenched random pinning .",
    "field theoretic calculations@xcite suggest that at long distances , for ( 1 + 1)- and ( 2 + 1)- dimensional interfaces , the periodic pinning potential is irrelevant , and hence that the interface scaling behavior is in the random - bond - ising universality class where width @xmath20 with the roughness exponent @xmath21 in @xmath0 , and @xmath22 in @xmath23 @xcite .",
    "note that lattice calculations are strongly affected by a lattice pinning potential and have a flat phase even for large lattice sizes @xcite .",
    "another problem which has been heavily studied is the random substrate problem@xcite .",
    "this was introduced to model the effect of a random substrate on layers of absorbed atoms , and also serves as a model for the effect of a p - fold random field on the xy - model@xcite .",
    "there is now a consensus that there is a disorder dominated glassy phase in this model ( in 2 substrate dimensions ) at low temperatures that is reflected in long distance correlations which behave as @xmath24 ( in contrast to thermally rough correlations in dimension @xmath1 , which grow as as @xmath25 ) .",
    "there has been some uncertainty about whether the leading order correlations found by cardy and ostlund ( co)@xcite are correct , with functional renormalization group calculations agreeing with co @xcite , and variational calculations disagreeing . the substrate roughness is randomly drawn from the interval @xmath26 ( in lattice units ) .",
    "this corresponds to a different sort of periodic elastic medium than that described in ( [ eq_pem ] ) above . here",
    ", the random substrate leads to a periodically repeated disorder seen by an interface lying above the random substrate .",
    "this arises due to the fact that the first , third , fifth , etc .",
    "atoms deposited at the same position on the random substrate see exactly the same disorder when they land .",
    "this corresponds to a random - bond ising magnet in which the disorder is repeated with period @xmath27 along the growth direction . in general",
    ", the disorder may range over a scale @xmath28 , and this leads to a periodic variation in the disorder on length scale @xmath29 . the continuum model for this system",
    "is simply , @xmath30 ^ 2 + \\eta[h(\\vec{r } ) ] \\right\\ } , \\label{eq_p}\\ ] ] but where @xmath17 is _ periodic in @xmath14 _ , so that we require @xmath31 = \\eta[h(\\vec{r})]$ ] .",
    "there has been considerable study of the random substrate ( @xmath27 ) problem , with the early controversy now being resolved in favor of a `` super - rough '' `` bragg - glass '' phase in @xmath1-dimensions in which @xmath32 .",
    "exact ground - state calculations have been very useful in resolving this controversy @xcite .",
    "it is quite easy to see ( see section iii ) that in @xmath0-dimensions , the random substrate problem behaves as a random walk ( rw ) , so that @xmath33 .",
    "note however it has been recently argued that although typical dislocations do not destroy the `` bragg - glass '' ground state , optimal dislocations have negative energy , and hence are expected to destroy the bragg glass in @xmath1-dimensions@xcite .    in this paper",
    "we study the hamiltonian ( [ eq_p ] ) as a function of the periodicity @xmath29 of the disorder .",
    "we show that at long length scales in @xmath0- and @xmath1-dimensions , the periodicity is relevant and that the random substrate universality class holds .",
    "the paper is arranged as follows : section [ model ] sets up the model and describes the way in which we calculate the exact positions of interfaces in random ising magnets . the scaling theory describing the behavior of these interfaces",
    "is developed and tested in section [ scaling ] .",
    "we give a brief conclusion in section [ concl ] .",
    "the model which we use to analyze the effect of periodic disorder on interface properties is a spin - half ising system with random bonds ( rb ) on square and cubic lattices .",
    "the hamiltonian is given by , @xmath34 where @xmath35 are coupling constants and the spin variables @xmath36 take the values @xmath37 .",
    "the spins on two opposite boundaries of the lattices , @xmath38 and @xmath39 , are fixed and have opposite signs so that an interface must exist in the lattice .",
    "our calculations are at zero temperature and we find the ground - state interface properties for interfaces whose average normals lie in the @xmath3 or @xmath4 directions of square lattices and in the @xmath5 or @xmath6 directions of cubic lattices .",
    "the coupling constants are random in a slab of size @xmath2 and then periodically repeated @xmath40 times along a chosen direction .",
    "the distributions used for the @xmath41 s vary here from case to case but are always chosen so that the interfaces are rough even for small lattices sizes , and even in the @xmath5 orientation cubic systems . in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , we illustrate the way in which the periodic disorder is implemented for the @xmath3 and @xmath4 directions of a square lattice . as is now well known @xcite , the ground state interface of the system ( [ hrb ] ) can be found _ exactly _ using the maximum flow algorithm .",
    "we have a custom implementation of the push - relabel algorithm for this problem and using it we are able to find the exact ground state interface in ising systems of size one millions sites in about one minute of cpu time on a high end workstation .",
    "consider the ground - state interface of a square lattice in which the bond disorder has period two in the @xmath4 orientation ( e.g. , fig .",
    "[ fig1](a ) ) .",
    "it is obvious that the interface is highly degenerate , as the ground state interface may start in any of @xmath42 equivalent positions .",
    "consider now starting to create a ground state interface from the left side of fig .",
    "[ fig1](a ) . to minimize the interface energy one chooses the weakest bond . having chosen this weakest bond ,",
    "the interface crosses this weakest bond and chooses the weakest bond in the next column .",
    "this process of choosing the weakest bond continues across the sample and , for period two , the random walk so generated gives the _ exact _ ground state .",
    "the reason this ground state is exact is that at each step , all of the possible random bonds in each column are tested ( there are only two ! ) .",
    "thus in this limit , @xmath33 as for a random walk .",
    "in contrast , if the period diverges , the model returns to the random bond ising universality class ( or equivalently the directed polymer ( dp ) in a random medium ) for which @xmath43 . for finite @xmath29",
    ", we expect that the interface will seek to optimize its global wandering until the roughness reaches the wavelength of the periodicity  @xcite .",
    "after that it has exhausted all possibilities and then returns to a random walk behavior .",
    "we thus have , @xmath44 a natural scaling form based on these limiting behaviors is , @xmath45 where the scaling function @xmath46 for the roughness has the asymptotic behavior , @xmath47    tests of the asymptotic behaviors ( [ dprw ] ) and the scaling function ( [ scalingdp ] ) and the results are presented in figs.[fig2 ] and [ fig3 ] for the @xmath3 orientation .",
    "it is seen that the predictions of the scaling theory are nicely confirmed .",
    "similar results were found for the @xmath4 orientation , too .",
    "we turn now to the behavior of random surfaces in @xmath1 dimensions . there ,",
    "renormalization group ( rg ) techniques have been applied to the random - phase sine - gordon model  @xcite , to random bond interfaces and to fairly general models of periodic elastic media .",
    "numerically , exact maximum - flow - minimum - cut and minimum - cost - matching algorithms  @xcite and monte carlo methods @xcite ) have been used . in the random substrate problem",
    ", there is a low temperature `` super - rough '' phase where @xmath48 , while in the random manifold problem , the surface roughness is found to behave as @xmath49 , where @xmath50 .",
    "the qualitative reasoning expressed in the first paragraph of this section also applies to higher dimensions , so that we expect the behavior of @xmath51 to be in the random substrate universality classes at long length scales @xmath52 , while the random manifold universality class is dominant at short length scales @xmath53 .",
    "the limiting behaviors in dimension ( 2 + 1 ) are then , @xmath54 we thus expect , @xmath55 and that the scaling function in @xmath1-dimensions is @xmath56 with the scaling parameter @xmath57 .",
    "the asymptotic behaviors of eq .",
    "( [ rblog ] ) are illustrated in figs.[fig4](a ) and ( b ) for interfaces in the @xmath5 orientation .",
    "the logarithmic asymptotic behavior is clearly confirmed in fig.[fig4](a ) , but the random manifold behavior is still strongly effected by finite size effects .",
    "this is understandable as large system sizes are necessary to see the asymptotic random manifold behavior , even in the @xmath58 limit @xcite .",
    "though finite size effects are clearly evident in the scaling plot of fig .",
    "[ fig4](c ) , the data collapse at large @xmath29 is quite satisfying .",
    "it is clear that the random substrate ( bragg glass ) universality class@xcite is dominant at large enough length scales .",
    "we have tested the behavior in the @xmath6 orientations and find that @xmath6 interfaces behave in a similar manner .",
    "we have studied the scaling behavior of an elastic manifold in the presence of a periodically repeated `` strong '' bond disorder .",
    "we find that in @xmath0- and in @xmath1- dimensions , and at long distances , the periodicity is relevant so these interfaces are in the random substrate universality class .",
    "this is to be contrasted with an interface in a system with a periodic potential and with random disorder . in the latter problem the periodic potential",
    "is claimed to be irrelevant on long length scales in @xmath0- and @xmath1-dimensions for any disorder@xcite , though at weak disorder numerical work on @xmath5 orientation cubic lattices indicate a strong tendency to order due to lattice effects@xcite .",
