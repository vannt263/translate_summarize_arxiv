    "ultraluminous x - ray sources ( ulxs ) are bright , point - like , off - nuclear extragalactic x - ray sources . since their discovery over two decades ago ( fabbiano et al .",
    "1989 ) , the true nature of these sources has been a mystery .",
    "their isotropic x - ray luminosities range from a few @xmath4 @xmath5 ergs s@xmath6 to as high as @xmath7 ergs s@xmath6 .",
    "luminosities at the high end of this range are found in a handful of sources which have been dubbed hyperluminous x - ray sources ( hlxs , e.g. , m82 x-1 : matsumoto et al .",
    "2001 , kaaret et al . 2001",
    "; hlx eso 243 - 49 x-1 : miniutti et al .",
    "2006 , farrell et al .",
    "the apparent x - ray luminosities of these sources exceed the eddington limit for any known stellar - mass black hole , hence the term  ultraluminous \" .    based on their variability on short timescales (",
    "some ulxs are known to vary on timescales of the order of a few minutes ) and high luminosities , some ulxs are almost certainly powered by accretion onto black holes ( excluding the population of x - ray bright supernovae ; immler & lewin 2003 ) .",
    "the controversy , however , is with their mass range .",
    "black holes , in principle , can exist in three mass ranges .",
    "stellar - mass black holes ( stbh : mass @xmath8 3 - 50 @xmath9 ) are the remnants of stellar evolution of massive normal stars ( stars excluding the pop iii category ) . on the opposite end of the mass scale",
    "are the super - massive black holes ( smbhs : mass @xmath10 @xmath9 ) - which are currently theorized to form either via accretion onto `` seed '' black holes in the early universe ( @xmath8 few myrs after the big bang ) with subsequent mergers ( volonteri et al .",
    "2003 ; davies et al . 2011 ) or via direct collapse of dense gas ( begelman et al . 2006 ) .",
    "their exact formation scenario is still somewhat uncertain . finally , one has the intermediate - mass black holes ( imbhs : mass range 100 - few @xmath4 1000 @xmath9 ) , whose formation mechanisms are the subject of considerable debate .",
    "there are a number of processes whereby an imbh can form .",
    "for example , they can be formed at the centers of globular clusters via accretion onto a massive black hole ( mass @xmath8 50 @xmath9 ) over a time period of @xmath11 years ( miller et al .",
    "2002 ) , by accretion onto a primordial black hole ( e.g. , mack et al .",
    "2007 ) , or by mergers of seed black holes .",
    "the off - centered nature of ulxs rules them out as candidates for smbhs .",
    "given the ages of their host galaxies , if they were smbhs , they should have sunk to the centers of their galaxies due to dynamical friction ( miller & colbert 2004 ) . clearly , this is not the case .",
    "this leaves the possibility of their being either stbhs or imbhs .",
    "theories supporting the idea of a stbh as the central engine often employ either beamed x - ray emission or some sort of super - eddington emission mechanism to explain the observed high luminosities .",
    "current ideas include geometric beaming ( king et al .",
    "2001 ) , relativistic beaming similar to the phenomenon of blazars ( krding et al .",
    "2002 ) , and super - eddington emission as a result of a photon - bubble instability in radiation - dominated accretion disks ( begelman et al .",
    "more recently , based on high - quality @xmath12-@xmath13 spectra of 12 ulxs , gladstone et al .",
    "( 2009 ) have suggested that ulxs might be accreting stbh systems in a new _ ultraluminous accretion state _",
    "( an addition to the current classification of black hole accretion states : thermal ( high / soft ) , hard ( low / hard ) & steep power law ( very high ) as in mcclintock et al . 2006 ) , where accretion is again super - eddington .",
    "alternatively , it has been suggested that these sources might be powered by gravitational energy release from accretion onto an imbh ( colbert & mushotzky 1999 ) .",
    "this presents a relatively simpler solution , where the energetics proceed similarly to that of the stbh systems ( at sub - eddington accretion rates ) with the corresponding physical properties scaling appropriately with the mass of the compact object .",
    "it is also possible that ulxs constitute an inhomogeneous population of both stbhs and imbhs .",
    "it is now known that certain characteristic timescales in accreting black hole systems scale with the mass of the black hole .",
    "for example , mchardy et al . (",
    "2006 ) have established that in soft - state stbhs and agn , the break timescale of the power density spectrum ( pds ) , the mass of the black hole and the luminosity are strongly correlated .",
    "their work was further extended to the hard - state stbhs by krding et al .",
    "these studies strongly demonstrate that certain physical timescales of accreting compact objects scale directly with the mass of the source ( after accounting for differences in accretion rates , i.e. , luminosity ) .",
    "therefore , timing studies can play a key role in extracting valuable information about the mass of the compact source , which is crucial in the case of ulxs in order to better understand the nature of the emission processes that result in such high apparent luminosities .",
    "of particular interest here are the low frequency quasi - periodic oscillations ( lfqpos ) . within the context of stbhs , the lfqpos ( those in the range @xmath8 0.1 - 15 hz ) are broadly classified into three categories based on their properties and the overall nature of their pds ( casella et al . 2005 ) .",
    "the pds with type - a and b qpos is characterized by weak red noise ( noise at the low frequency end of the pds ) with the type - a qpos occurring with relatively low coherence ( quality factor , q : centroid frequency / fwhm , @xmath14 3 ) compared to the type - b ( q @xmath15 6 ) . finally , one has the type - c qpos which are most relevant to the present work .",
    "the pds accompanying these qpos in stbh systems can be described by a flat - topped , band - limited noise breaking to a power law with the qpos evident on the power - law portion of the spectrum , close to the break .",
    "further , the type - c qpos are fairly coherent with the quality factor , q from 5 - 15 and amplitudes ( % rms ) ranging from 2 - 20 . in stbhs",
    ", they are known to occur in the frequency range from @xmath16 0.1 - 15 hz . in light of the work unifying the stellar - mass and the super - massive black holes ,",
    "if some ulxs were to host imbhs then the qualitative behavior of their pds should be comparable to stbhs with the characteristic variability times scaling according to the mass of the putative imbh .",
    "this idea has been explored by a number of authors to search for the `` qpo analogs '' in ulxs ; and qpos have now been detected in a handful of them .",
    "the qpos detected in m82 x-1 ( strohmayer & mushotzky 2003 ) , ngc 5408 x-1 ( strohmayer et al .",
    "2007 ) and ngc 6946 x-1 ( rao et al . 2010 ) resemble the type - c qpos , while those detected in the m82 source x42.3 + 59 more closely resemble the type - a or -b qpos ( feng et al .",
    "the crucial difference here is that the qpo centroid frequencies of the ulx sources appear to be scaled down by a factor of a few@xmath4(10 - 100 ) ( @xmath8 few mhz ) compared to the lfqpos in stbhs .    under the assumption that the ulx mhz qpos are analogs of the lfqpos in stbhs",
    ", it is reasonable to assume that their characteristic timescales / frequencies ( e.g. , qpo centroid frequencies , pds break frequencies ) scale with the mass of the accreting source and vice versa .",
    "however , the type - c qpos occur with a wide range of centroid frequencies ( @xmath17 hz ) in stbh systems . therefore , timing information alone is not sufficient to accurately estimate ulx masses in this way , but combining timing and spectral information has proven to be a valuable tool .",
    "for example , in stbh systems , the power - law photon index and disk flux are correlated with the qpo centroid frequency .",
    "the general trend is an increase in power - law photon index and disk flux with the qpo centroid frequency ( e.g. , sobczak et al .",
    "2000 ; vignarca et al .",
    "2003 ; shaposhnikov & titarchuk 2009 ) , with evidence for saturation ( constancy of the power - law photon index and disk flux with a further increase in qpo centroid frequency ) beyond a certain frequency .",
    "using a reference stbh system with a measured qpo centroid frequency - photon - index relation , one can then scale the qpo centroid frequencies detected in ulx systems at a given power - law spectral index to get an estimate of the mass .",
    "for example , with archival @xmath12-@xmath13 data from m82 x-1 , dewangan et al . ( 2006 ) extracted the energy and power spectra of the source .",
    "the pds was strikingly reminiscent of a stbh with type - c qpos , i.e. , flat - top noise breaking to a power - law with qpos on the power - law portion of the spectrum .",
    "however , the respective timescales were scaled down by a factor of @xmath8 10 .",
    "the qpo in this case was centered around a frequency of @xmath8 114 mhz and the energy spectrum had a power law photon index of @xmath8 2.0 .",
    "using the qpo frequency - photon index correlations from two stbh reference sources , grs 1915 + 105 and xte j1550 - 564 , they estimated the mass of the ulx in m82 x-1 by scaling its qpo centroid frequency ( @xmath8 114 mhz ) at the given photon index ( @xmath8 2.0 ) .",
    "they estimated the mass of the black hole to be in the range 25 - 520@xmath9 .",
    "similar scaling arguments were used by rao et al .",
    "( 2010 ) to estimate the mass of the black hole in the ulx ngc 6946 x-1 to be in the range ( 1 - 4 ) @xmath4 1000 @xmath9 . based on both the pds and the energy spectrum of ngc 5408 x-1 , strohmayer et al .",
    "( 2009 ) ( s09 ) argued that the source behavior was consistent with the steep power - law state ( spl ) often seen in stbhs .",
    "they compared the available data from ngc 5408 x-1 to five different stbh reference sources and estimated the mass of the black hole to be a few @xmath4 1000 @xmath18 .",
    "feng et al .",
    "( 2010 ) detected 3 - 4 mhz qpos from the ulx x42.3 + 59 in m82 and identified them as either type a / b analogs of stbhs .",
    "they estimated the mass of the black hole to be in the range 12,000 - 43,000 @xmath9 by scaling the qpo frequency to that of the type a / b qpos in stbhs .",
    "it is important to note that the above scaling arguments have several caveats .",
    "first , the mass estimates were established under the assumption that the mhz qpos detected from these ulx systems are analogous to a particular type of lfqpo detected in stbh systems , i.e. , a , b or c. these identifications were based on the qualitative nature of the power spectrum ( pds ) alone in some cases and both the pds and the energy spectrum in the case of ngc 5408 x-1 .",
    "second , in the case of the ulx mhz qpos , the observed range of qpo centroid frequencies and photon indices has been limited . to gain a more secure identification",
    "one would like to see the qpo frequencies and photon spectral indices _ correlate _ in a similar fashion as for the stbhs .",

    "such an insight is important as we are using both the _ pn _ and the _ mos _ data to achieve higher count rates compared to , say , the _ pn _ alone .",

    ".    the apparent weakness of iron emission from the disk can be due to a number of factors : an accretion disk that is completely ionized , scattering of the reflected iron - line photons in an optically thick corona ( matt et al .",
    "1997 ) , especially when the corona is a thin layer above the accretion disk or a low iron abundance in the accretion disk ( matt et al .",
    "further , a high inclination angle for the accretion disk combined with one or more of the above factors can decrease the intensity of the iron - line .",

    "if a strong connection can be demonstrated , then scaling of the characteristic frequencies ( e.g. , qpo centroid frequency ) can be better justified to estimate the mass of the black hole within this source .",

    "more specifically , they proposed that its x - ray state was analogous to that of a stbh in the so - called steep power - law ( spl ) state exhibiting type - c qpos , but at the same time emitting a few@xmath410 higher x - ray flux .",

    "our results for this relation from ngc 5408 x-1 are shown in the left and right panels of figure 3 in two different energy bands ( 1.0 - 10.0 kev and 0.5 - 5.0 kev , respectively ) . comparing these plots with those from stbhs , as in figure 11 of mcclintock et al .",
    "( 2009 ) , the results appear to be at least qualitatively consistent with the behavior of spl data from some stbhs ( see for example , the green triangles in figure 11 of mcclintock et al .",
    "however , because a tight correlation appears to break down in the spl state it is hard to conclude definitively that the ngc 5408 x-1 behavior is exactly analogous .",
    "[ fig : figure 5a ]    another important signature of the type - c lfqpos in stbhs is their dependence on the energy spectral features , i.e. , the timing - spectral correlations . using the x - ray state classifications as in mcclintock et al .",
    "( 2006 ) , lfqpos in stbhs are usually detected in the low / hard state , spl state and during the transition between these two states . within the context of the multi - colored disk + power - law model parameters",
    ", it is known that the centroid frequency of these lfqpos is correlated with the disk flux and the photon index of the power - law component . in stbhs ,",
    "the typical behavior is that the qpo centroid frequency is positively correlated with the disk flux and the photon index of the power law . at a certain higher qpo centroid frequency ( @xmath16 5 - 10 hz ) the relationship seems to flatten ( saturate ) and even appears to start reversing in some cases ( vignarca et al .",
    "furthermore , the correlation is not exactly the same for all stbhs , i.e. , the value of the slope of the correlation and the photon index / disk flux at saturation are different for different sources and can be different for the same source in a different outburst ( vignarca et al . 2003 ; shaposhnikov & titarchuk 2009 ) . in figure 5",
    "we show plots of several derived spectral parameters and fluxes ( using the _ diskpn _ + _ power - law _ fits ) as a function of the qpo centroid frequency .",
    "these can be compared with similar plots derived from stbh systems ( see , for example , figures 8 & 9 in mcclintock et al . 2009 ; figure 10 of vignarca et al .",
    "again , there appears to be qualitative consistency between the behavior exhibited by ngc 5408 x-1 and stbhs , but the full range of behavior is not yet seen , again because the range of spectral variations in ngc 5408 x-1 ( most notably in the power - law index ) is too modest .",
    "additional measurements of qpo properties at lower values of the power - law photon index , for example , could provide a more definitive test .",
    "[ fig : figure1a ]    one can also investigate the spectral - temporal correlations in the context of the spectral parameters derived using the _ bmc _ model .",
    "indeed , shaposhnikov & titarchuk ( 2009 ) explored such correlations in detail for a sample of stbhs using rxte data .",
    "they also developed a set of fitting functions to quantify the observed correlations and used these to obtain mass estimates by scaling arguments .",
    "figure 5b compares the results from ngc 5408 x-1 with those from stbhs using the _ bmc _ spectral fits .",
    "we used the published data from shaposhnikov & titarchuk ( 2009 ) to produce representative plots for a stbh ( xte j1550 - 564 , top panels ) .",

    "the data points are color coded to highlight the low / hard state ( blue ) and the spl state ( green ) .",
    "we used the data from the 1998 outburst of xte j1550 - 564 which clearly demonstrates the typical behavior of stbhs ( top panels ) .",
    "comparisons of these plots with those in , for example , shaposhnikov & titarchuk ( 2009 ) lead to similar conclusions as with the results in figure 5a .",
    "there is qualitative consistency with the type - c identification , but the classification is not definitive . in order to make a more secure association of the qpos in ngc 5408 x-1 with type - c ( spl state ) qpos in the stbhs , we need , at a minimum , to obtain observations of the source over a greater range of power - law spectral indices .",
    "it has been established that black hole masses scale with the break frequency of their pds ( mchardy et al .",
    "2006 , krding et al . 2007 ) and this relation is known to hold over 6 orders of magnitude in mass , i.e. , from stbh to super - massive black holes . furthermore , at least in stbhs , the break frequency of the pds is known to strongly correlate with the centroid frequency of the lfqpos ( wijnands et al .",
    "therefore , it is reasonable to assume that the mass of the black hole scales with the centroid frequency of the lfqpos . this can be especially useful in cases where black hole mass measurements are otherwise difficult , viz . , in ulxs . however , an important caveat is to ensure that the qpos used for comparison are similar in nature .",
    "our new results confirm the earlier result from s09 that the qualitative nature of the pds and the energy spectrum of ngc 5408 x-1 are very similar to that of stbhs in the spl state ( see table 6 ) . at the same time , the characteristic timescales within the pds are lower by a factor of @xmath0 , while the x - ray luminosity is higher by a factor of a few@xmath410 , when compared to a typical stbh in such a state .",
    "however , based on the scaling between the break frequency of the pds and the centroid frequency of the lfqpos ( centroid frequency of lfqpos @xmath16 12@xmath4break frequency of the pds ) , the association of the mhz qpos from ngc 5408 x-1 with the lfqpos from stbhs has been questioned ( middleton et al .",
    "2011 )    a striking feature of the behavior of ngc 5408",
    "x-1 is that the energy spectrum of the source has remained roughly constant over the current suite of observations , while the properties of the most prominent qpo ( e.g. , rms amplitude , centroid frequency ) have changed significantly .",
    "these results appear consistent with the source being in a spectral state similar to the spl state in stbhs .",
    "more specifically , in stbhs , certain spectral properties like the disk flux , the photon index of the power - law correlate positively with the qpo centroid frequency up to a certain frequency ( @xmath16 2 - 10 hz ) beyond which the relationship turns around or remains roughly constant",
    ". detailed analysis of the timing - spectral correlations in stbh sources such as xte j1550 - 564 and h1743 - 322 has revealed a comprehensive picture ( mcclintock et al .",
    "2009 ) of their behavior .",
    "tracking these two sources as they evolved from the low / hard state into the spl state , it was realized that the spectral properties like the disk flux and the power - law photon index are tightly correlated with the qpo centroid frequency during the low / hard state and during a transition phase intermediate between the low / hard and the spl state ; and the relationships seem to saturate / breakdown ( spectral properties remain roughly constant with increase in the qpo frequency ) as the sources entered the spl state",
    ". it may be that we are in fact seeing ngc 5408 x-1 in a similar state , that is , we may be seeing the `` saturated '' portion of the relation .",
    "given that the overall accretion timescales change with the mass of the black hole ( timescales increase as the mass increases from stbhs to super - massive black holes , e.g. , mchardy et al .",
    "2006 ) , it is possible that we are seeing a similar timing - spectral behavior , and that the apparent longevity of the source in the spl state might also be due to its having a higher mass",
    ". there may be a useful analogy to agn in that their spectra are known to remain roughly constant on timescales of at least a few years ( markowitz et al . 2003 ) while transient stbh systems undergo strong energy spectral changes on timescales of the order of a few days ( mcclintock et al .",
    "2006 and references therein )",
    ". it could be that the persistence of ngc 5408 x-1 in the approximately same spectral state is related to it being of intermediate mass between stbhs and agn .",
    "alternatively , perhaps the source is in an accretion state , like the so - called ultraluminous state of gladstone et al .",
    "( 2009 ) , that is just not well sampled by the behavior of galactic stbhs .",
    "we note that the indication for a rollover in the power - law at 4 - 5 kev ( see  4 and table 5 ) provides some support for this interpretation , in which case the spectral state of ngc 5408 x-1 may not be exactly analogous to the spl state of stbhs",
    ".    however , either conclusion will remain tentative until ngc 5408 x-1 is observed in a state with a lower value of the power - law photon index , i.e. , a state similar to the low / hard state in stbhs .",
    "such an observation would clearly be important in order to make a more definitive identification of its qpos in the context of those observed in stbhs .",
    "assuming the constancy of the energy spectral features , i.e. , disk flux , @xmath159 , with the increasing qpo centroid frequency ( see figure 5 ) is analogous to the saturation observed in the timing - spectral correlations in stbhs , one can estimate the minimum mass of the black hole in ngc 5408 x-1 .",
    "if we are indeed seeing only the saturated portion of the complete timing - spectral correlation curve , then the minimum qpo frequency observed in ngc 5408 x-1 serves as an upper limit on the so - called transition frequency , i.e. , the frequency beyond which the timing - spectral correlations tend to saturate . in order to derive a mass estimate , this particular frequency can be scaled to a reference stbh of known mass with a measured transition frequency ( @xmath191 ) .",
    "we can use the transition frequency as defined by shaposhnikov & titarchuk ( 2009 ) in their fits of qpo and spectral parameters .",
    "we find a sample of three stbhs with mass and transition frequency measurements in shaposhnikov & titarchuk ( 2009 ) that are suitable for this purpose .",
    "further , it is known that the same source can exhibit different tracks ( timing - spectral correlation curves ) , i.e. , different transition frequencies , in various outburst episodes . given that we are interested in a lower limit on the mass of the black hole in ngc 5408 x-1 , we consider the lowest transition frequency for a given source .",
    "the minimum mass of the black hole in ngc 5408 x-1 , can then be calculated as @xmath191@xmath4mass@xmath192/(minimum qpo frequency ) .",
    "the mass estimates using the three reference sources , gro 1655 - 40 , xte j1550 - 564 and gx 339 - 4 are reported in table 7 ( @xmath8 1000 m@xmath193 ) , and show substantial overlap with those reported by s09 .",
