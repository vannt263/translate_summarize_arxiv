    "over the past twenty years , gravitational lensing has grown from a mere curiosity to an important component of a large and diverse set of fields in astronomy .",
    "its ubiquity is due at least in part to the fact that its effects are observable over a wide range of scales .",
    "this has enabled astronomers to use lensing to study everything from the smallest compact objects , to the largest structures in the universe , and almost everything in between . despite the diversity of applications of gravitational lensing ,",
    "the mathematical description of the phenomenon itself is both relatively tractable , and universal . in almost all cases ,",
    "gravitational lensing can be described by a two - dimensional mapping from a lens plane to light source plane .",
    "once this mapping is specified , all of the properties of a gravitational lens can be derived in principle .",
    "observable _ properties of lensing , however , depend on the phenomenon to which it is applied .",
    "therefore , lensing is traditionally divided into an number of different regimes , which are delimited by the observables .",
    "for example , the term microlensing is typically applied to the case when multiple images occur , but are not resolved .",
    "when multiple images are created by a gravitational lens , the separation between these images is typically of order the einstein ring radius , @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the mass of the lens , @xmath13 , and @xmath14 , @xmath15 , and @xmath16 are the distances from observer to source , observer to lens , and lens to source , respectively .",
    "thus , the term microlensing is applied when @xmath17 is less than the resolution . in this case , all one can measure is the collective behavior of all the images created by the lens , i.e. ,  the total magnification , and the position of the center - of - light ( centroid ) of the image .",
    "in fact , if the observer , source , and lens were not in relative motion , than the individual image magnifications and positions would be fixed , and even these properties would not be measurable .",
    "the relative positions of the observer , lens , and source , and thus the magnification and centroid , are expected to vary on time scales of order the einstein ring crossing time , @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the transverse speed of the lens relative to the observer - source line - of - sight .",
    "fortunately , in the two regimes where microlensing has been discussed , the typical values of @xmath17 , @xmath15 , and @xmath19 result in reasonable time scales .",
    "typical values for the lens mass @xmath12 , relative source - lens distance @xmath20 , transverse velocity @xmath19 , and the resulting typical values for @xmath17 and @xmath21 for both local group and cosmological microlensing are given in table 1 .",
    "also shown are typical values for the radius @xmath22 of the source s emission region , this radius in units of @xmath17 , @xmath23 , and the time it takes the lens to cross the source , @xmath24 .",
    "these latter parameters will be relevant to the discussion of finite source effects in  [ sec : fsources ] .",
    "for the local group , a typical einstein radius crossing time is @xmath25 , whereas for cosmological microlensing , @xmath26 .",

    "+ [ tbl : table1 ]    of exceptional importance in microlensing is the existence of caustics : positions in the light source plane corresponding to the critical values of the lens mapping . on caustics , at least one image is formed that has formally infinite magnification ( for a point - source ) . when a source crosses a caustic , both the total magnification and centroid of all the images exhibit instantaneous , discontinuous jumps .",
    "these jumps are averaged out over the finite source size ; however , it is generically true that large gradients in the magnification and centroid exist near caustics .",
    "furthermore , microlensing caustics have several important and useful properties .",
    "first , the large magnification results in a large photon flux from the source .",
    "second , the large gradient in the magnification and centroid with respect to source position effectively implies high angular resolution . finally , the highly localized nature of the high - magnification and large centroid - shift regions created by caustics results in characteristic , and easily - recognizable features , in both astrometric and photometric microlensing curves .",
    "many authors have suggested exploiting these properties of caustics to study a number of astrophysical applications , i.e. ,  stellar multiplicity @xcite , stellar atmospheres @xcite , individual microlens mass measurements @xcite , microlens mass functions @xcite , properties of the emission regions of quasars @xcite , and lens transverse velocities @xcite .",
    "see gaudi & petters ( 2002 ; hereafter paper i ) for a more thorough discussion of the uses of astrometric and photometric microlensing observations in the presence of caustics in both local group and cosmological contexts .",
    "although the caustic curves of gravitational lenses exhibit an enormously rich and diverse range of properties , it can be shown rigorously that each stable lensing map has only two types of caustic singularities : folds and cusps ( petters , levine , & wambsganss 2001 , p. 294 ) .",
    "each of these two types of singularities have generic and universal properties and , in particular , each can be described by a polynomial mapping from the lens plane to light source plane .",
    "the coefficients of these mappings depend on local derivatives of the dimensionless surface potential of the lens . in paper",
    "i , we used the mapping for a fold singularity to derive the observable properties of gravitational lensing near folds , paying particular attention to the case of microlensing , in which the images are unresolved .",
    "we derived analytic expressions for the total magnification and centroid shift near a generic , parabolic , fold caustic .",
    "we then showed how these expressions reduce to those for the more familiar linear fold , which lenses a nearby source into two equal magnification , opposite parity images whose total magnification is proportional to @xmath41 , where @xmath2 is the distance of the source to the fold caustic .",
    "we then generalized these results to finite source sizes .",
    "finally , we compared our analytic results to numerical simulations of the galactic binary - lens event ogle-1999-bul-23 , in which the source was observed to cross a fold caustic .",
    "we found excellent qualitative agreement between our analytic and semi - analytic expressions for the photometric and astrometric behavior near a fold caustic , and our detailed numerical simulations of the second fold caustic crossing of ogle-1998-bul-23 .    in this paper , we present a similarly detailed study of the generic , quantitative properties of microlensing near cusps .",
    "although fold caustic crossings are expected and observed to dominate the sample of caustic crossings in galactic binary events @xcite , cusp crossings will nevertheless represent a non - negligible fraction of all caustic crossing events .",
    "in fact , at least two cusp crossing events have already been observed , the galactic bulge events  @xcite , and macho-1997-blg-41 @xcite .",
    "it is interesting to note that the analyses and modeling of these events were performed using entirely numerical methods . as we discuss in some detail ( see  [ sec : apply ] ) , we believe that the analytic results derived here are particularly amenable to the analysis of   and similar events . in the cosmological context , the role of cusps versus folds is less clear , due primarily to the more complicated structure of the caustics themselves .",
    "however , it has been shown that , in the limit of high magnifications , the inclusion of cusps alters the form of the total microimage magnification cross section , due to the lobe of high - magnification close to and outside the cusped caustic @xcite .",
    "lensing near cusps has been substantially less well - studied than lensing near folds , and as a result , useful analytic expressions for the observable properties are few .",
    "previous studies have focused almost exclusively on the magnification of the images created by a cusp singularity @xcite . here",
    "we study all the observable properties of gravitational microlensing near cusps , including the photometric ( total magnification ) and astrometric ( light centroid ) behavior , for both point sources and extended sources with arbitrary surface brightness profiles .",
    "the layout of this paper is as follows . in ",
    "[ sec : analytic ] , we derive analytic expressions for the image positions , magnification , and light centroid for sources near a generic cusp . in ",
    "[ sec : general ] we define the observable microlensing properties . in ",

    "we generalize the discussion to include images not associated with the cusp in  [ sec : global ] , and study extended sources in  [ sec : fsources ] . in ",
    "[ sec : mb9728 ] , we illustrate the observable behavior near a cusp by numerically simulating the galactic binary - lens cusp - crossing event , and directly compare these numerical results with our analytic expressions in  [ sec : compare ] . in  [ sec : apply ] , we suggest several possible applications in both local group and cosmological contexts .",
    "we summarize and conclude in  [ sec : summary ] .",
    "we note that , for the sake of completeness , we include some results that have been presented elsewhere .",
    "combined with the results from paper i , the results presented here describe the observable properties of gravitational microlensing near all stable singularities .",

    "a rigorous analytical study of the total magnification ( photometry ) and image centroids ( astrometry ) for most physically reasonable lens models ( e.g. , binary point mass lenses ) is very difficult .",

    "we note that the order at which one chooses to truncate the expansion is somewhat arbitrary ; higher accuracy can always be achieved by keeping terms of higher order ( at the expense of higher complexity , of course ) .",

    "similarly , they are local , being tied to the global lens in consideration only via the coefficients @xmath358 of the generic cusp mapping ( ) .",
    "this means that the observables due to the cusp crossing can be analyzed in a parametric manner ( with the coefficients @xmath358 being the parameters ) , without regard to the global ( and presumably , _",
    "non - analytic _ ) properties of the lens in question . in this section ,",
    "we discuss several possible applications of our results that take advantage of these properties .",
    "one issue often encountered in microlensing studies is the question of when the point source approximation is valid .",
    "this is important , because it is typically easier to calculate the observable properties under the assumption of a point - source than when a finite sources is considered . for a given source location ,",
    "the accuracy of the point source approximation depends primarily on the distance of the source from the nearest caustic , relative to the size of the source , and secondarily on the surface brightness profile of the source . for a source near a simple linear fold , there exist semi - analytic expressions for the finite source magnification , relative to the point - source magnification , for uniform and limb - darkened sources ( see , e.g.  paper i ) . for a source interior to the fold caustic ( where there are an additional two images due to the fold ) , the difference in the uniform source magnification from the point source magnification is @xmath8 for separations @xmath359 , where @xmath360 is the distance of the center of the source from the fold in units of the source radius , and the point - source magnification is proportional to @xmath361 .",
    "the effect of limb - darkening is @xmath362 in the same range , where @xmath272 is the limb - darkening parameter , which has typical values in the range @xmath363 for optical wavelengths . using the results derived in ",
    "[ sec - us - limb ] , we can also determine the effect of finite sources on the magnification near a cusp .",
    "for sources outside the cusp and on the axis of the cusp , the point source magnification is @xmath364 ( ) , whereas the uniform source magnification is @xmath365 ( ) .",

    "it is interesting to note that , at a given distance from the caustic , the effects of finite uniform and limb - darkened sources are larger for cusps than for folds .",
    "the remarkable agreement of the analytic predictions for the properties of   with the exact numerical calculation suggests another application of our results .",
    "one primary difficulty with modeling galactic caustic - crossing binary lenses is the fact that the magnification is generally non - analytic .",
    "furthermore , in order to calculate the finite source magnification , this non - analytic point - source magnification must be integrated over the source .",
    "this can be quite time consuming , thus making it difficult to explore quickly and efficiently the viable region of parameter space .",
    "furthermore , the observables are generally not directly related to the canonical parameters .",
    "this means that small changes in the parameters generally lead to large changes in the observables .",
    "therefore , the parameters must be quite densely sampled , further exacerbating the problems with the calculations .",
    "thus , finding all viable model fits to well - sampled galactic binary lensing events has proved quite difficult .",
    "these problems have been discussed in the context of fold - caustic crossing binary lens events in @xcite , who proposed an elegant and practical solution .",
    "taking advantage of the fact that the behavior near a fold caustic is universal , and using analytic expressions for the point - source and finite - source magnification , @xcite devised a procedure wherein the behavior near the fold crossing is isolated and fit separately from the remainder of the light curve .",
    "again , because the behavior near a fold can be calculated semi - analytically , fitting this subset of the data is considerably easier and quicker than fitting the entire data set .",
    "this fit can then be used to constrain the viable regions of the parameter space of the global binary - lens fit .",

    "one can then search for cusps in the space of binary - lens models that satisfy these constraints .",
    "finally , one can search for viable fits to the entire data set in this restricted subset of parameter space .",
    "although there are undoubtedly nuances in the implementation , it seems likely that this ( admittedly schematic ) procedure should provide a relatively robust and efficient method for fitting many cusp - crossing binary - lens events .",
    "we discuss one final application of our results that may prove useful in the context of quasar microlensing . for poorly - sampled microlensed light curves , there exists a rough degeneracy between the effects of the size of the source and the typical angular einstein ring radius @xmath371 ( see , e.g.  @xcite ) . as discussed by @xcite",

    "we generalized our results beyond the local behavior near the cusp by deriving expressions for the total magnification and centroid including the images not associated with the cusp .",
    "we further considered rectilinear source trajectories , and parameterized this trajectory in order to calculated the dependence of the photometric and astrometric behavior on time .",
    "in particular , due to the presence of the infinitely magnified images when the source is on the fold caustics , but finite magnification outside the caustic , we find that the centroid exhibits a finite , instantaneous jump whenever the source crosses one of the two folds abutting the cusp .",
    "we present a formula for the magnitude of the jump that depends only on the local coefficients of the cusp mapping , and the location of the caustic crossing .",
    "we note that this magnitude decreases monotonically as a function of the horizontal distance between the cusp and where the source crosses the cusped caustic curve , so that a source which crosses the cusp point exactly exhibits no jump discontinuity .",
    "beginning with the appropriate modifications to the formulae for the total magnification and centroid for finite sources with arbitrary surface brightness profiles , and combining these with the analytic results we obtained for the magnification and centroid for point sources near a cusp , we derived semi - analytic expressions for the uniform and limb - darkened finite source magnification for small sources on and perpendicular to the axis of the cusp .",
    "we also derived expressions for the centroid of a small source on the axis for uniform and limb - darkened sources .    in order to illustrate the photometric and astrometric lensing behavior near cusps , and to provide order - of - magnitude estimates for the effect of finite sources and limb - darkening on these properties , we numerically calculated the total magnification and centroid shift for the observed cusp - crossing galactic binary microlensing event .",
    "we find that the cusp crossing results in large , @xmath384 centroid shifts , which should be easily detectable with upcoming interferometers .",
    "we find that limb - darkening induces a deviation in the centroid of @xmath385 .",
    "we compared our numerical calculations with the analytic expectation , and found excellent agreement . adjusting only the magnification and centroid of the images unrelated to the cusp , and adopting the coefficients appropriate to the cusp of",
    ", we find that our analytic formulae predict the magnification to @xmath8 and the centroid to @xmath386 , for positions within @xmath343 source radii of the cusp .",
    "finally , we suggested several applications of our results to both galactic and cosmological microlensing applications .",
    "we suggest that one can use our analytic expressions to determine the applicability of the point - source approximation for sources near a cusp .",
    "in particular , we note that the finite source magnification deviates from the point - source magnification by @xmath8 for sources separated by @xmath9 source radii .",
    "we also discussed how the local and generic behavior of the cusp can be used to simplify the fitting procedure for cusp - crossing events .",
    "lastly , we outlined a method by which the typical angular einstein ring radius of the perturbing microlenses of a macrolensed quasar might be estimated using measurements of the jump in the centroid that occurs when the source crosses a fold , making use of the analytic expression for the magnitude of the jump derived here .    despite their apparent diversity , the mathematical underpinning of all gravitational lenses is identical . in particular , all lenses exhibit only two types of stable singularities : folds and cusps . in paper",
