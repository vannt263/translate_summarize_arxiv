    "modeling the contact mechanics between elastic solids with surfaces that are rough on multiple length scales is a challenging task . to perform such a task several theoretical approaches have been developed over the years . at the core of all the approaches",
    "lie approximations that relate to describing the shape of the contacting surfaces . in a seminal paper , greenwood and williamson",
    "@xcite ( gw ) proposed that the contact problem between two elastic rough surfaces could be reduced to the problem of one infinitely - hard rough surface acting on a flat elastic counterface . within their model ,",
    "the rough topography was described by a large collection of hemispherical asperities of uniform radius ( which individually satisfied the hertzian approximation ) with a height distribution that followed a gaussian law .",
    "this initial approach was later extended by greenwood and tripp @xcite by considering the presence of roughness on the two contacting surfaces .",
    "further contributions to the original gw methodology have been proposed by whitehouse and archard @xcite , nayak @xcite , onions and archard @xcite , bush et al . @xcite and whitehouse and phillips @xcite .",
    "all these models rely on the definition of `` asperity '' .",
    "the asperity concept itself has proved quite controversial and depends on the resolution of the instrument used to measure the surface profile@xcite .",
    "another drawback of gw - type approaches is that using only a few parameters to describe the surfaces generates a one - to - many mapping possibilities , i.e. , the same set of parameters can be deduced for surfaces obtained by completely different machining processes .    in spite of the great increase in computing power in the past decade ,",
    "analytical theories are still very much needed to understand the contact mechanics of solids with surfaces that display roughness on more than three decades in length - scales .",
    "theoretical models to tackle such problems rely on approximations and idealizations in order to analytically solve the equations of elasticity . for example , such equations can be exactly solved for the contact problem of a parabolic tip acting on a flat surface under the assumptions of linearly elastic , frictionless materials ( hertz model ) .",
    "similarly , an exact solution can be obtained for the contact between a sinusoidal elastic surface and a rigid plane ( westergaard model ) @xcite . the gw model and its extensions are further examples of how to deal with surface roughness in contact mechanics , resulting in simple analytic formulas .",
    "these easy - to - handle formulas have proved to be of great importance , and are frequently employed in the design process of new technical applications .",
    "the hertz and the westergaard models provide accurate representation of the mechanics of single asperities .",
    "in addition , the gw model describes approximately the ( low squeezing - pressure ) contact between surfaces exhibiting roughness on a single or a narrow distribution of length scales .",
    "however , most real surfaces have roughness over many decades of length scales . here , the long range elastic coupling between the asperity contact regions , which is neglected in the gw model , is now known to strongly influence contact mechanics @xcite .",
    "if an asperity is pushed downwards at a certain location , the elastic deformation field extends a long distance away from the asperity influencing the contact involving other asperities further away @xcite .",
    "we note that the lateral coupling between contact regions is important for arbitrary small squeezing pressure or load .",
    "the reason for this is that surfaces with roughness on many length scales can be considered as consisting of large asperities populated by smaller asperities , with the smaller asperities being populated by even smaller asperities and so on .",
    "thus , when two solids are squeezed together by a very small external force , the distance between the macro - asperity contact regions will be very large , and one may be tempted to neglect the elastic coupling between the macro - asperity contact regions .",
    "however , the separation between the micro - asperity contact regions within a macro - asperity region will in general be very small , and one can not neglect the elastic coupling between such micro - asperity contact regions .",
    "this latter effect is neglected in the gw theory , significantly limiting its prediction capabilities when applied to most real surfaces .",
    "additionally , in the gw model the asperity contact regions are assumed to be circular ( or elliptical ) while the actual contact regions ( at high enough experimental resolution ) show fractal - like boundary lines @xcite .",
    "therefore , because of their complex geometries , one should try to avoid explicitly invoking the nature of the contact regions when searching for an analytical methodology to solve the contact problem of two elastic rough surfaces .",
    "recently , an analytical contact mechanics model that does not use the asperity concept and becomes exact in the limit of complete contact has been developed by persson @xcite .",
    "the theory accounts for surface roughness on all relevant length scales and includes ( in an approximate way ) the long range elastic coupling between asperity contact regions . in this theory",
    "the information about the surface enters via the surface roughness power spectrum @xmath1 , which depends on all the surface roughness wavevectors @xmath2 components .",
    "the theory can be used to calculate the interfacial stress distribution @xmath3 , from which one can obtain the area of real contact as a function of the squeezing pressure @xmath4 and the magnification @xmath5 .",
    "furthermore , the theory predicts the average interfacial separation @xmath6 for any applied external load .    besides analytical approaches , numerical algorithms ( deterministic ) have also been developed to understand the contact mechanics of elastic solids with rough boundaries . as the speed and memory capacity of computers increase , numerical methods have become a viable alternative to analytical methods when modeling surfaces of three - dimensional ( 3d ) solids having surface roughness extending over at most three decades in length - scales .",
    "nevertheless , simplifying assumptions about the material and the topography are still needed to ensure reasonable computational time windows .",
    "much is still to be done in order to reach the capacity to numerically simulate real surfaces that may have roughness from the nanometer scale up to the macroscopic size of the system which could be cm .",
    "numerous numerical works have been reported in the literature aiming to solve the contact mechanics of two linear elastic solids with rough surfaces .",
    "the majority of these are half - space models in which the elastic deformation is related to the stress field at the surfaces of the solids through integral equations where the domain of integration is the boundary of the half - space .",
    "this type of approach is commonly referred to as boundary element method ( bem ) .",
    "twenty years ago lubrecht and ioannides @xcite suggested applying multilevel techniques to facilitate the numerical solution of the bem . with the same objective in mind ren and lee @xcite implemented a moving grid method to reduce storage of the influence matrix when the conventional matrix inversion approach is used to solve this type of problem .",
    "bjrklund and andersson @xcite extended the conventional matrix inversion approach by incorporating friction induced deformations .",
    "alternative techniques that aim to solve the elastic contact of rough surfaces are the fast fourier transform ( fft)-based method introduced by ju and farris @xcite and a follow - up extension , based on a variational principle @xcite , proposed by stanley and kato @xcite .",
    "the contact between solids with realistic surface topographies under relatively small loads usually leads to plastic deformations .",
    "tian and bhushan , @xcite based their theoretical model is based on a variational principle for linear elastic perfectly plastic materials . in this way , not only the in - contact topography and the corresponding pressure distribution but also the unloaded plastically deformed topography can be obtained for the case when the loading is high enough to cause yield .",
    "this model was further developed in the paper by @xcite and this is also the bem employed in the present work , but here we restrict the analysis to linear elastic materials .    in earlier works , the prediction of persson s contact mechanics theory for the interfacial stress distribution @xmath7 and the contact area",
    "have been compared to numerical results obtained using the finite element method ( fem ) @xcite , molecular dynamics @xcite and green s function molecular dynamics ( gfmd ) @xcite . in this paper",
    ", we will show how the theory can be extended to also predict the distribution of interfacial separations @xmath0 .",
    "this quantity is of crucial importance for problems like leak - rate of seals @xcite or mixed lubrication @xcite .",
    "the analytical results will be compared to numerical solutions obtained using ( a ) a half - space method based on the boussinesq equation ( bem ) , ( b ) a green s function molecular dynamics technique and ( c ) smart - block molecular dynamics .",

    "assume that the surfaces of the two solids have height profiles @xmath12 and @xmath13 , respectively .",

    "the qualitative explanation for such an argument is that the solids will mainly deform in the regions where they make contact , and most of the elastic energy will arise from the contact regions .",
    "nevertheless , using @xmath43 assumes that the energy ( per unit area ) in the asperity contact regions is just the average elastic energy ( per unit area ) as if complete contact would occur .",

    "this result , already confirmed by experimental works  @xcite , differs drastically from the prediction of gw - like asperity models which instead yield a dependency of the type @xmath175 with @xmath176 being a constant . the origin for those differences , an exponential decay predicted by persson s theory and a gaussian decay obtained by gw , is the omission of the long - range elastic deformations within asperity contact models which also results in very different morphologies for the contact regions as illustrated in figs .
