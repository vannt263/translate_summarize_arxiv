    "the leading model of energy production in qsos involves an accretion disk orbiting a supermassive black hole ( blandford 1990 ) .",
    "evidence for black holes in the nuclei of nearby galaxies is increasing ( rees 1997 ) , but proof of accretion disks in qsos has been elusive .",
    "the expected disk effective temperatures imply disk emission at wavelengths in rough agreement with the big blue bump observed in energy distributions of qsos ( shields 1978 ; malkan 1983 ; czerny and elvis 1987 ) .",
    "accretion disk fits to the energy distributions of a number of qsos have been quite successful ( , sun and malkan 1989 , webb  1993 ) .",
    "these models indicate masses @xmath4 of over @xmath5 and accretion rates @xmath6 above @xmath7 for luminous qsos .",
    "lyman edges in the total flux should be inconspicuous because of relativistic doppler broadening ( laor and netzer 1989 , hereinafter ln ; laor 1991 ) and nlte effects ( coleman 1993 ; shields and coleman 1994 , hereinafter sc ; hubeny and hubeny 1997 ) . the lyman edge of h i will be most conspicuous in relatively cool disks ( @xmath8 ) , but will appear as a slope change over the wavelength range @xmath9 to @xmath10    ( sc ) rather than an abrupt discontinuity .    models of accretion disks predict substantial electron scattering opacity at optical and ultraviolet wavelengths , leading to polarization of the emitted light ( see section 2.1 ) .",
    "in contrast , observed polarizations in the optical and near ultraviolet are typically @xmath11 percent or less ( stockman , moore , and angel 1984 ; webb  1993 ) .",
    "moreover , in radio loud objects where a radio extension indicates the position angle of the disk axis , the observed polarization tends to be parallel to the disk axis ( berriman  1990 ) .",
    "electron scattering in a geometrically thin disk would produce polarization perpendicular to the axis . predicted polarizations can be reduced by absorption opacity , faraday rotation ( agol and blaes 1996 ) , general relativistic depolarization ( laor , netzer , and piran 1990 , hereinafter lnp ) , and disk surface structure ( coleman and shields 1991 ) ; but some concern remains ( antonucci  1996 ) .",
    "lnp computed the expected energy distribution and polarization of qso disks with a simple model of the atmosphere and full consideration of the general relativistic transfer function .",
    "they found that while the lyman edge in the energy distribution is inconspicuous in general , a substantial drop in polarization in the h i lyman continuum should result from the increase in absorption opacity relative to scattering .",
    "several groups undertook spectropolarimetry with the _ hubble space telescope ( hst ) _ faint object spectrograph ( fos ) , targeting `` lyman edge candidates '' for which international ultraviolet explorer ( iue ) spectra suggested an intrinsic drop in the flux around the lyman edge ( , koratkar , kinney , and bohlin 1992 ) . rather than a drop in polarization in the lyman continuum , these observations revealed an abrupt rise in polarization at rest wavelength @xmath12    in several objects ( impey  1995 ; koratkar  1995 ) .",
    "the polarization increases by a large factor , from @xmath13 percent at @xmath14    to @xmath15 percent in pg 1222 + 228 at @xmath16     and @xmath17 percent in pg 1630 + 377 .",
    "the proximity of the polarization rise to the lyman edge is suggestive ( impey  1995 ) .",
    "an intriguing explanation of the displaced polarization rise was offered by blaes and agol ( 1996 , hereinafter ba ) .",
    "using lte and nlte models for the disk atmosphere with a hydrostatic vertical structure , they found that , for @xmath18 k , a similarly blueshifted , steep polarization rise resulted from a combination of effects .",
    "the polarization drops at the lyman edge because of the increased absorption opacity , but then it increases with decreasing wavelength because of the @xmath19 dependence of the h i photoionization opacity and the increasingly steep source function gradient at higher frequencies .",
    "a strong source function gradient leads to severe limb darkening , needed for strong polarization ( agol , blaes , and ionescu - zanetti 1997 ; cheng  1988 ) . a model for a disk around a nonrotating black hole gave a promising fit to pg 1222 + 228 , but polarization as strong as observed for pg1630 + 377 could not be achieved",
    "however , ba did not include the relativistic transfer function , and it was unclear whether these effects would upset the fit to pg1222 + 228 .",
    "we report here results of a theoretical study of polarization in qso accretion disks .",
    "we focus on the steep polarization rises observed in pg 1222 + 228 and pg 1630 + 377 . in section 2 , we describe our stellar atmosphere models and the treatment of the relativistic transfer function . then we describe attempts to fit the two qsos with accretion disk atmospheres , and show that general relativistic effects preclude an acceptable fit . in section 3 , we show that a good fit can be achieved in a simple model with a sharp polarization jump at the lyman edge in the rest frame of the gas , and we consider possible sources for this emission .",
    "our conclusions are discussed in section 4 .",
    "we have calculated lte stellar atmospheres for conditions appropriate for qso disks .",
    "these models were supplemented by some ",
    "mixed \" lte - nlte calculations as described below . because we are interested only in the continuum , and because a perfect description of the vertical structure of agn disks is not available , we used simple methods to model the atmosphere .",
    "these resemble the lte calculations of coleman ( 1993 ) , but the codes used here were written largely independently .",
    "the physics included is similar to the treatment of ba , but the computational methods are quite different .",
    "atmospheres were computed for a set of radii and corresponding values of effective temperature , , and vertical acceleration of gravity , , evaluated for a given @xmath4 , @xmath6 , and angular momentum , @xmath20 , from the relativistic relations given by novikov and thorne ( 1973 ) and page and thorne ( 1974 ) .",
    "the atmosphere was computed for a set of points ( typically 91 ) equally spaced in the logarithm of the column density ( gm @xmath21 ) ranging from @xmath22 to 2.5 .",
    "the hydrostatic density profile was integrated from the top down according to the equation @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the gas pressure and @xmath25 is the radiative acceleration . here @xmath26 is the flux - weighted mean opacity per unit mass ( mihalas 1978 ) .",
    "radiative transfer in the atmosphere was calculated by performing a downward integration of the equations @xmath27 and @xmath28 where , , and are the usual eddington moments of the radiation field @xmath29 , is the monochromatic optical depth from the top of the atmosphere , @xmath30 , and and are the absorption and scattering opacities per unit mass .",
    "the emergent flux was adjusted in a shooting method to satisfy a lower boundary condition = at a fiducial optical depth , typically @xmath31 .",
    "the first iteration used a gray atmosphere temperature profile , the eddington approximation (= 3 ) , and a surface boundary condition @xmath32 .",
    "subsequent iterations used variable eddington factors and a temperature profile corrected by the unsld - lucy method to achieve flux conservation ( mihalas 1978 ) .",
    "we assumed constant flux , i.e. , no local heating ( see below ) .",
    "the resulting ( ) was used to compute the source function ( ) , and new values of , , and were then computed at each depth point from the usual exponential integral expressions ( mihalas 1978 ) .",
    "these gave new values for the eddington factors , the quantities needed for the temperature correction , and .",
    "the entire procedure ( hydrostatic integration , transfer integration , moments , temperature correction ) was iterated as necessary , typically three iterations .",
    "opacity sources included were electron scattering , free - free absorption , and bound - free absorption from the lowest 7 levels of h i and the ground states of he i and he ii . ionization and h i level populations were computed from the boltzmann - saha equation ( lte ) .",
    "convergence was good except in a thin surface layer for certain ranges of , for which h or he were partially ionized at the surface .",
    "the flux in the related lyman continuum of h or he was negligibly small in these cases , and the fluxes at longer wavelengths were not significantly affected .",
    "the assumption of constant flux through the atmosphere should be adequate in our case ( see also ba ) .",
    "we describe below models using the same parameters ( @xmath33 ) as ba .",
    "the region of the disk emitting the lyman continuum is characterized by the radius @xmath34 giving maximum ( 25,500 k ) . in the vertically averaged model of nt with @xmath35 ,",
    "the surface density of the disk ( midplane to surface ) is @xmath36 .",
    "the surface density above the point where = 1 at @xmath37   is @xmath38 .",
    "if energy is dissipated along the vertical extent of the disk roughly in proportional to density , then only a small fraction of the flux is dissipated in the photosphere .",
    "also , we find that , at = 1 , the dissipation rate per unit mass is tiny compared with the radiative heating and cooling rates in the atmosphere .",
    "these conclusions are even stronger if dissipation is proportional to gas pressure or total pressure . moreover , our conclusions depend more on relativisitic effects than atmospheric details .    polarization was calculated using a straightforward iterative procedure by voigt ( 1951 ) applied to the final converged atmosphere .",
    "although voigt studied cases with small scattering opacity fractions , we found that convergence was rapid in all cases .",
    "the exact polarization exceeds that of the first iteration by almost a factor two for wavelengths at which electron scattering strongly dominated the opacity .",
    "this results from multiply scattered photons that produce substantial `` prepolarization '' of the radiation going into the last scattering .",
    "cs and others have emphasized that the effective gravity in agn disks will be very low because of close cancellation of and .",
    "this leads to a large gas pressure scaleheight , a low density in the photosphere , high ionization , and a large opacity contribution from electron scattering .",
    "coleman ( 1993 ) , hubeny and hubeny ( 1997 ) , and others have shown that significant differences in emitted spectrum can result from use of a fully self - consistent vertical structure rather than an approximate , constant gravity solution .",
    "however , our results show that , for the polarization phenomena of primary concern here , the details of the local atmospheric emission are less important than the effect of the relativistic transfer function . therefore , we followed the procedure of ba in using a value of that was 20 percent larger than the eddington limit for a given .",
    "this is about the minimum that allowed convergence for most .",
    "for these purposes , we took @xmath39 , where @xmath40 is the electron scattering opacity for fully ionized pure hydrogen .",
    "( reduction of to @xmath41 , in cases where the atmosphere still converged , gave considerably lower values of , but the emergent spectrum and polarization changed only modestly . )    sensitivity of our results to nlte effects was evaluated in several sample cases by using our lte atmospheric structure , @xmath42 and @xmath43 , as input to an nlte stellar atmosphere program developed by the munich university observatory stellar atmosphere group .",
    "this code , using modern methods including accelerated lambda iteration ( ali ) , includes bound - bound and bound - free transitions of many levels of h and he .",
    "when set to run in lte mode , this code gave emergent spectra in excellent agreement with our lte code .",
    "in nlte mode , the results showed the expected reduction of the lyman absorption edge for relatively cool atmospheres (  coleman 1993 ; hubeny and hubeny 1997 ) .",
    "however , the polarization as a function of wavelength was not greatly different between the lte and nlte cases , in agreement with ba .    following ba",
    ", we cut off the disk at @xmath44 , where @xmath45 is the gravitational radius .",
    "for schwarzschild black holes , we computed atmospheres at @xmath46 = 7.76 , 9.52 , 15.3 , 20.3 , 31 , 44 , and 50 .",
    "test cases with additional radii gave similar results .",
    "summation over disk radii and application of the relativistic transfer function , which accounts for doppler shifts , transverse and gravitational redshifts , and gravitational deflection of light rays was accomplished with a modified version of the computer codes used by lnp and kindly made available by t. piran and a. laor .",
    "these codes use a set of 51 radii from @xmath47 = 1.2346 to 400 to cover disks around either rotating or nonrotating black holes .",
    "we typically used as set of 80 frequencies uniformly spaced in log @xmath48 between @xmath49 to @xmath50 hz .",
    "the lnp transfer function assumes limb darkening laws in the intensity and polarization for pure electron scattering ( chandrasekhar 1960 ) , although there is provision for a scale factor in the polarization",
    ". the actual limb darkening in the polarized intensity can be quite different ( cheng  1988 ; agol , blaes , and ionescu - zanetti 1997 ; and references therein ) . in order to accomodate a general limb darkening law with minimum changes to the lnp codes",
    ", we used a simple fitting procedure .",
    "the polarized intensity from a given radius and frequency can be described in terms of the orthogonal polarized intensity components @xmath51 and @xmath52 .",
    "each of these was fit with a six term series in integer powers of @xmath53 from n = 0 to 5 , which gave an excellent fit in all cases .",
    "heuristically , this may be thought of as a set of 12 accretion disks , each of which emits at its surface either pure @xmath54 or pure @xmath55 , with a limb darkening @xmath56 .",
    "the corresponding 12 transfer functions were computed with the lnp code and applied to the respective fitting components , and the resulting stokes parameters at the observer were summed to produce the observed spectrum .",
    "our atmosphere results were interpolated to the lnp radius grid and the adopted frequency grid using a linear interpolation in @xmath57 and @xmath48 for ( 1 ) the brightness temperature @xmath58 defined by @xmath59 and ( 2 ) @xmath60 and @xmath61 at five values of @xmath62 ( prior to determining the fitting coefficients ) .",
    "test cases gave good agreement with a disk emitting with the electron scattering darkening law and with results from an independent transfer function code by agol(1997a , b ) .",
    "the emergent energy distribution and polarization for an atmosphere with @xmath63 and @xmath64 are shown in figure 1 .",
    "the polarization rises in the lyman edges of h i and he i are evident , similar in the case of h i to the results of ba ( who did not include he ) .",
    "note also the substantial polarization at optical wavelengths ( see also figure 3 of ba ) .",
    "the low effective gravity leads to a low density at the optical photosphere , and electron scattering contributes substantially to the opacity ( @xmath65 percent at @xmath66 for @xmath67   ) . some earlier models ( , lnp )",
    "used the midplane density throughout the atmosphere .",
    "the predicted optical polarizations may be a problem for disk models , given the weak observed optical polarizations for radio quiet qsos ( , berriman  1990 ) .",
    "we have computed models for pg 1222 + 228 and pg 1630 + 377 , for which the most dramatic lyman continuum polarization rises have been reported . for pg 1222 + 228 , following ba and webb  ( 1993 ) , we have used a nonrotating black hole with @xmath68 and @xmath69 .",
    "( actually , only the quantity @xmath70 matters for the shape of the energy distribution .",
    "this , along with @xmath2 , determines the run of with radius , and @xmath71 is determined by in our models .",
    "the overall luminosity can be scaled to fit the observations by scaling @xmath6 .",
    "the same is true for the `` toy '' models of section 3 . )",
    "the resulting energy distribution is shown in figure 2 for observer viewing angle @xmath72 .",
    "( larger @xmath73 give weaker polarization ; the same model for @xmath73 = 0.1 is shown in figure 3 . ) the energy distribution is in fairly good agreement with the observations , as found by ba and webb  ( 1993 ) .",
    "however , the polarization rise is more blueshifted and more gradual than observed .",
    "this differs from the results of ba , who did not include the relativistic transfer function ( but who warned that it could modify their conclusions ) .",
    "note that for = 0.35 , more edge on than ba s model , the polarization still reaches the observed @xmath15 percent , but at a wavelength shorter than observed .",
    "the transfer function diminishes the peak polarization and adds its own blueshift to that already present in the stellar atmosphere spectra , causing the total blueshift to exceed that observed .",
    "figure 3 shows the spectrum of the same disk , viewed at a more edge on angle (= 0.1 ) and scaled to the observed energy distribution of pg 1630 + 377 .",
    "the energy distribution fits fairly well .",
    "however , even for this nearly edge on viewing angle , the polarization does not approach the value @xmath17 percent observed , and the polarization rise is again too much blueshifted in the model .",
    "another difficulty with the ba model may be the small ionizing luminosity from such a cool disk .",
    "the expected h@xmath74 equivalent width for our model is only @xmath75   for = 0.35 if the line emiting gas absorbs all the ionizing photons .",
    "observed equivalents widths are somewhat larger , and the covering factor for the emitting gas may be small .",
    "moreover , the disk s he i and he ii ionizing luminosities are negligible .",
    "however , a `` nonthermal '' ionizing source may also be present .",
    "_ we conclude that the stellar atmosphere phenomenon suggested by ba to explain the observed polarization rises fails on account of the relativistic transfer function .",
    "_ the actual stellar atmosphere effect is nevertheless present , and it may contribute at some level to the observed spectrum of agn disks .",
    "the preceeding results show that the relativistic transfer function causes a substantial blueshift of any polarization rise in the disk s local emission .",
    "this raises the question , what will be observed if the disk gas emits a continuum with an abrupt increase in polarization right at the lyman edge in the rest frame of the gas ?",
    "we have calculated a simple model in which the disk surface , at any radius , emits a continuum with a sharp lyman edge in absorption in the total flux together with a sharp jump in polarization at the lyman edge .",
    "the emitted astrophysical flux was given by @xmath76 for @xmath77 and @xmath78 for @xmath79 , simulating an atmosphere whose brightness temperature drops to the boundary temperature in the lyman continuum .",
    "the polarization was assumed to rise from effectively zero at @xmath77 to an arbitrary multiple of @xmath80 at @xmath81 , where @xmath82 refers to the polarization of electron - scattering atmosphere ( chandrasekhar 1960 ) . to this end",
    ", we define @xmath83 by @xmath84 .",
    "figure 4 shows the resulting fit to pg 1630 + 377 for several values of the black hole angular momentum and = 0.1 . for each value of @xmath2",
    ", the values of @xmath85 and @xmath86 were adjusted to fit the energy distribution , and @xmath83 was adjusted to fit the maximum polarization observed .",
    "figure 4 shows that the observed polarization rise remains quite sharp and is displaced to the blue by an amount that depends on @xmath2 . for larger @xmath2 , the disk s inner boundary at the marginally stable radius shifts inward , from @xmath47 = 6 for @xmath87 to @xmath47 = 1.22 for @xmath2 = 0.9982 ( page and thorne 1974 ) . for larger @xmath2 ,",
    "the lyman continuum comes from smaller radii where the relativistic effects are stronger .",
    "the wavelength and shape of the polarization rise agree with the observations for @xmath2 = 0.5 .",
    "evidently , _ this simple model gives a good fit to the observed energy distribution and to the shape of the rise in polarization .",
    "_    why does the polarization remain low for a considerable wavelength interval to the blue of the lyman edge , and then rise abruptly ?",
    "the relativistic transfer function causes the approaching , blueshifted part of the disk to appear brighter than the receding portion .",
    "in addition , light from the sideways moving portion of the disk behind the black hole is bent as it passses near the hole on its way to the observer . even for a fairly edge - on viewing angle",
    ", this light leaves the atmosphere fairly close to the normal , so that its intensity is enhanced by limb darkening , the projected solid angle subtended by unit surface area is increased , and its polarization leaving the disk surface is low (  agol 1997a ) .",
    "this light also suffers depolarization from relativistic rotation of the polarization plane , which varies rapidly with position on the part of the disk behind the black hole ( connors , piran , and stark 1980 ; agol 1997a ) .",
    "the light from the part of the disk in front of the hole is more strongly polarized but less intense .",
    "thus , the observed light at small doppler shifts is dominated by the back part of the disk and is weakly polarized . at larger blueshifts ,",
    "the light is dominated by the approaching part of the disk .",
    "this light is strongly polarized because it suffers less gravitational deflection and therefore emerges from the atmosphere at a large angle to the normal .",
    "these points are illustrated in figure 5 , which shows the received flux and polarization for an annulus that emits at a single radius , @xmath47 = 10.52 , and wavelength , @xmath88  .",
    "the received emission from the near and far sides of the ring are shown separately .",
    "the flux is much stronger at the blue end than at the red end of the observed range of wavelength shifts because of doppler boosting .",
    "intense but weakly polarized flux is received from the back side of the disk with relatively little shift from the emitted wavelength .",
    "thus , the lyman edge in the total flux will ramp up or down progessively from the red to the blue side of the nominal wavelength , whereas the polarization will rise only at shorter wavelengths .",
    "the blueshift of the polarization rise in the toy model depends on as well as @xmath2 .",
    "figure 6 shows results for a maximally rotating hole with @xmath2 = 0.9982 .",
    "again , @xmath6 and @xmath4 are adjusted in each case to fit the energy distribution .",
    "the blueshift of the polarization rise increases with decreasing , and by eye we estimate a best fit @xmath89 0.33 .",
    "however , in this case , large values of the intrinsic polarization , @xmath90 , are required to match the observed _ degree _ of polarization of pg 1630 + 377 .",
    "this corresponds to @xmath91 percent at @xmath62 = 0.33 and @xmath92 percent at @xmath93 .",
    "the unknown mechanism for producing the postulated lyman continuum polarization could have a limb darkening law quite different from @xmath80 , but polarization of roughly 76 percent at @xmath94 will likely be required in any case and may be difficult to achieve . if one rejects such a large intrinsic polarization , then @xmath2 must be less than 0.9982 in the context of this toy model .    the cases = 0.25 and 0.50 are shown in figures 7 and 8 . for = 0.25 , the blueshift is best fit for @xmath95 . for = 0.5 , the blueshift depends little on @xmath2 ( even for @xmath3 ; see figure 6 ) , and it is too small to fit pg 1630 + 377 .",
    "figures 4 and 68 show that the wavelength of the polarization rise provides a constraint in the ( @xmath2 , @xmath62 ) plane .",
    "interpolating , we find = ( 0.10 , 0.25 , 0.30 ) for @xmath2 = ( 0.50 , 0.75 , 0.90 ) . from the fit to the energy distribution , we find = ( 27 , 25 , 20 ) , @xmath85 = ( 5.0 , 9.0 , 15 ) , and @xmath96 = ( 0.22 , 0.14 , 0.099 ) , respectively . note that @xmath6 decreases with increasing @xmath2 because of increasing efficiency of energy production .",
    "also , @xmath70 decreases with increasing @xmath2 because of stronger doppler boosting ( requiring lower ) and a smaller radiating area in units of @xmath97 , which gives higher for a given @xmath70 .",
    "all of the values are comfortably below the eddington limit , consistent with a thin disk .",
    "this toy model was also used to fit pg 1222 + 228 .",
    "the blueshift of the observed polarization rise is somewhat less than for pg 1630 + 377 ( impey  1995 ; koratkar  1995 ) , and the rise possibly is more abrupt , but the uncertainties are large .",
    "figure 9 shows results for = 0.25 .",
    "the fit for @xmath2 = 0.5 is fairly good , requiring @xmath83 = 1.7 , = 43 , @xmath85 = 6.2 , and @xmath98 .",
    "reference to figure 7 suggests that = 0.5 would fit pg 1222 + 228 fairly well for appropriate @xmath83 , independent of @xmath2 , although the blueshift may be slightly less than observed .",
    "figures 6 , 7 , and 8 indicate that the wavelength at which the polarization rises to one - half of its full value , @xmath99 , will be between about 640 and 830  , at least for inclinations @xmath100 , which are most likely to give strong polarization .",
    "this is consisstent with the two objects discussed above and with pg 1338 + 416 ( koratkar  1995 ) .",
    "the observed degree of polarization for the toy model scales with @xmath83 , and results can be derived from the figures .",
    "for example , if we fix @xmath101 and @xmath102 ( above discussion of pg 1630 + 377 ) , we may ask what will be the plateau value of the polarization , @xmath103 , for this disk viewed at various angles . from figures 4 , 7 , and 8 , we find @xmath104 percent and @xmath105   for @xmath106 .",
    "we have shown that the relativistic transfer function precludes an explanation of the observed polarization rises in pg 1222 + 228 and pg 1630 + 377 in terms of the stellar atmosphere effect proposed by blaes and agol ( 1996 ) .",
    "relativistic effects add an additional blueshift to the polarization rise that makes the predicted rise occur at wavelengths shorter than observed .",
    "the model also can not explain the strong degree of polarization observed in pg 1630 + 377 .    as a step toward a more successful model",
    ", we have shown that the observed polarization rises are consistent with a simple model in which the polarization rises abruptly at @xmath107 in the rest frame of the orbiting gas .",
    "the observed polarization rise is blueshifted by an amount that depends on @xmath2 and . for pg 1630 + 377 ,",
    "the observations are consistent with @xmath2 of about 0.5 or greater but probably less than 0.9982 .",
    "what could be the origin of the polarized lyman emission ? in pg 1630 + 377 , the polarized flux , @xmath108 rises steeply with decreasing wavelength ( koratkar  1995 ) .",
    "an increase in polarized flux abruptly at the lyman edge in the rest frame of the gas suggests free - bound emission from ionized hydrogen that undergoes electron scattering , either in the emitting gas or a separate scattering location (  impey  1995 ; koratkar  1995 ) . in view of the evidence of irradiation of agn disks by a hard incident continuum , at least in lower luminosity objects ( , clavel  1992 ; mushotzky , done , and pounds 1993 ; and references therein )",
    ", one naturally thinks of a photoionized layer on the disk surface ( , sincell and krolik 1997 ) .",
    "a simple picture would be a uniform slab of ionized gas in which recombination of h i produces a fairly uniform emissivity in lyman continuum photons that scatter off electrons in the slab on their way out of the slab .",
    "such a surface layer , overlying a photosphere with a lyman edge in absorption in its total flux , might resemble our toy model .",
    "results by phillips and mszros ( 1986 ) show polarizations of 15 percent or more for @xmath109 in a scattering slab with uniformly distributed emitters , and the possibility of even larger polarizations for emitters concentrated near the surface .",
    "the strongest polarization occurs for @xmath110 to 0.3 .",
    "however , it is not clear from their results that strong enough polarization for pg 1630 + 377 will be possible , and the limb darkening law is very different from @xmath80 .",
    "the temperature of such a slab can be constrained by the fact that the polarized flux in pg 1630 + 377 jumps by an order of magnitude across the polarization rise . if the polarized flux has the same energy distribution as the radiation feeding into the scattering process , then the emissivity of the gas must have a similar contrast .",
    "the emissivity ratio @xmath111 decreases with increasing temperature because of free - free and balmer continuum emission .",
    "the observed polarized flux requires @xmath112 k for pg 1630 + 377 , based on expressions by brown and mathews ( 1970 ) .",
    "a layer that is mechanically heated rather than photionized may be an alternative source of the polarized lyman continuum .",
    "yet another possible source involves the fact that for luminous qsos , a standard ( shakura and sunyaev 1973 ) disk may become optically thin in the inner radial zone .",
    "further work is needed to establish whether the continuum and line emission in such a model is consistent with all known observations for qsos with lyman polarization rises .",
    "koratkar  find a polarization rise at the expected position of lyman @xmath113 , weaker than the lyman continuum polarization and not blueshifted .",
    "this may come from larger disk radii with lower orbital velocities .",
    "simple estimates , based on the black body limit for the l@xmath113 surface brightness , suggest that the disk radii considered here will not be a significant source of l@xmath113 emission .",
    "the spin rates of black holes in agn have received increasing attention in recent years . an interesting `` spin paradigm '' , in which radio loud objects have rapidly rotating holes ( blandford 1990 ) has been developed by wilson and colbert ( 1995 ) .",
    "values @xmath114 could arise in several ways .",
    "( 1 ) if two black holes coallesce , the resulting hole has @xmath114 for a mass ratio @xmath115 if roughly half the angular momentum of the binary at the last stable circular orbit is radiated as gravitational waves during the coallescence ( wilson and colbert 1995 ) .",
    "( 2 ) successive accretion events at random inclinations could cause the hole s angular momentum to wander around a value @xmath114 if the mass accreted in one event is not too small as a fraction of the black hole mass ( moderski , sikora , and lasota 1997 ) .",
    "( 3 ) angular momentum extraction by the blandford - znajek ( 1977 )",
    "mechanism may balance angular momentum supplied by accretion to give an equilibrium value @xmath116 . results by moderski and sikora ( 1996 ) indicate @xmath117 for @xmath118 , where @xmath113 is the viscosity parameter ( shakura and sunyaev 1973 ) and @xmath119 .",
    "our model for pg 1630 + 377 has @xmath120 , and values @xmath121 are not precluded in agn .",
    "however , a value of @xmath2 as large as 0.5 might correspond to an object with substantial radio luminosity in the `` spin paradigm '' , whereas pg 1630 + 377 and pg 1222 + 228 are radio quiet objects .",
    "the toy model discussed here essentially addresses the question , what must the polarization be in the rest frame of the gas , in order for the observed polarization rise to match the observations ?",
    "the remarkably simple answer is that it should be an abrupt rise in polarization and polarized flux at the lyman edge .",
    "this may provide a significant clue to the source of the polarized radiation .",

    "<S> the blueshift depends on the angular momentum of the black hole and the inclination of the disk . </S>",
    "<S> a good fit to pg 1630 + 377 results from a simple model with a dimensionless angular momentum @xmath0 and an observer viewing angle @xmath1 . </S>",
