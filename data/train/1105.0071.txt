    "quantum information processing has been extensively studied during the past years @xcite .",
    "one of the main challenges of actual physical implementations has been the manipulation of the quantum information with sufficient accuracy to prevent errors . in particular",
    "it is important to be able to transfer quantum information between different elements of a quantum computer @xcite . in this respect ,",
    "spin chain systems have been proposed as quantum channels for the transmission of _ _ quantum states , where the spins act as the quantum bits _ _ @xcite .",
    "many systems of this kind have been explored in order to improve their performance for the state transmission .",
    "one of the goals is to find systems that allow for state transfer without any dynamical manipulations during the transfer procedure or with only minimal additional requirements .",
    "for example , local control only on the boundary spins in either an initialized chain @xcite or an unpolarized chain @xcite can cause a large enhancement of the transmission fidelity from one end of the chain to the opposite end ; even perfect state transfer ( pst ) could be achieved by engineering the entire set of spin - spin couplings in the chain @xcite .",
    "very few of these systems have been implemented experimentally , for example using small numbers of spins in liquid state nmr @xcite and slightly larger numbers of them in solid - state nmr @xcite .",
    "spin defects in diamond seem to show a promising direction for near future implementations @xcite .",
    "important experimental challenges are posed by the lack of individual addressibility of the spins and , more importantly , by their vulnerability to decoherence @xcite .",
    "imperfections in the implementation of spin - chain systems also cause decoherence and were predicted to produce localization of the quantum information @xcite which was recently demonstrated experimentally @xcite .",
    "consequently , a successful characterization of these pst protocols should consider these errors in order to find the optimal one .",
    "two pst protocols that require engineered spin - couplings @xcite have been analyzed in this respect considering static perturbations @xcite .",
    "other important points to consider are the timing errors on the time when the pst is achieved @xcite and the speed of transfer of the different protocols @xcite .",
    "but , considering that the number of possible systems that could be used for pst @xcite is infinite , a performance comparison between them should be aimed at finding a system which is as robust against perturbations as possible . for that purpose",
    "it is important to find out which intrinsic properties of a system make it robust against perturbations . in this work , we tackle these questions analyzing different energy distributions that allow for pst and compare their robustness against static perturbations .",
    "we characterize the robustness of the systems by calculating their transmission fidelity . in order to find the relevant properties of the systems that make them robust , we analyze how the eigenstates and eigenenergies are perturbed .",
    "we find that the localization properties of a system are intimately connected to its robustness .",

    "[ fig07 ] is destroyed , while the energetic symmetry is not .",
    "we observe that the degree of localization of the energy eigenstates varies strongly between the different eigenvalue distributions .",
    "the most robust distributions seem to generate the most strongly localized energy eigenstates ; in panels ( a ) , ( b ) and ( c ) of fig .",
    "[ fig07 ] each energy eigenstate basically seems to be localized on two lattice sites .",
    "the quadratic distribution [ panel ( a ) ] seems to have the most strongly localized eigenstates ; in particular the eigenstates that belong to the center of the band are highly localized on the boundaries .",

    "it has been shown that the presence of localized states at the boundaries of the spin chain can improve the transmission of quantum states @xcite .",
    "these localized states arise when the coupling of the boundary sites is weaker than the coupling between inner sites or if external fields are applied at the boundary sites .",
    "therefore , we study how the different energy levels are affected by perturbations for the different energy distributions .",
    "we generated distributions of energy eigenvalues @xmath109 for the different kinds of unperturbed energy spectra and for different perturbation strengths @xmath83 . for small @xmath83",

    "the width of that distribution scales with the perturbation strength . for larger values of @xmath83",

    "( the energy spectrum of the perturbed hamiltonian matrix is still symmetric . )",
    "the value of @xmath83 where the asymmetry sets in depends on the type of unperturbed energy spectrum and is largest for the quadratic case . to see more quantitatively what is going on in detail ,",

    "the key observation explaining the differences in state transfer robustness is made by combining figures [ fig08 ] and the upper panels of fig .",
    "[ fig07 ] .",
    "those panels show that for the quadratic energy spectrum @xmath65 the initial state @xmath106 of the state transfer process is superposed from a small number of energy eigenstates in the center of the energy spectrum . in all other types of energy spectrum",
    "the initial state shows a wider distribution in the energy quantum number @xmath60 . at the same time , the sensitivity to perturbations ( which is what is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig08 ] ) shows a comparatively wide minimum with value zero in the center of the spectrum , whereas all other types of spectra show roughly constant nonzero values in the central region of the spectrum , with a single exceptional zero right in the center .",
    "the observed particular robustness of the _ quadratic _ energy spectrum can thus be ascribed to the fact that the initial state consists of a particularly small number of energy eigenstates coming from a part of the energy spectrum which is particularly insensitive to perturbations in the spin coupling constants . for the less robust distributions ,",
    "the variance is roughly independent of the energy in the center of the energy band , while for the quadratic energy spectrum the variance decreases continuously towards the band center . for that distribution ( and for the two other distributions shown in the upper panels of fig .",
    "[ fig07 ] ) all energy eigenstates are quite strongly localized . a glance at fig .",
    "[ fig01]b shows that the corresponding coupling patterns have the smallest couplings close to the ends of the chain , in the region where those energy eigenstates are localized which are most important for the state transfer .",
    "since we discuss a constant _ relative _ strength @xmath115 of the disorder , the _ absolute _ changes of the couplings tend to be smallest near the ends of the chain , causing only small changes in the energy eigenvalues . that explains the particular robustness of the quadratic distribution .",
    "another important aspect characterizing the robustness of the transmission is the length of the window of time where high fidelity is obtained for the transmitted state . in this context",
    ", we are not only considering errors in the engineered spin couplings , but also the timing error of the measurement @xcite .",
    "to that end we analyze the term @xmath116 from ( [ averagefidelity ] ) at time @xmath117 . taking into account the spatial symmetry ,",
    "@xmath118 is given by    @xmath119    where @xmath120 . even without the bloch - sphere average ( [ averagefidelity ] ) which would be necessary for a comparison with fig .",
    "[ fig02 ] , the above result shows why the quadratic distribution displays the longest window of time .",
    "the probabilities @xmath104 ( see fig . [ fig07 ] ) are sharply peaked in the center of the energy band and essentially zero otherwise .",
    "furthermore , due to the quadratic nature of the energy spectrum , the relevant energy differences @xmath121 are particularly small ( see fig . [",
    "fig01]a ) making the fidelity deviate from unity only at rather large @xmath122 values .",
    "we have studied the robustness of spin chain systems designed for perfect quantum state transfer ( pst ) under static perturbations .",
    "we explored different pst systems by choosing different energy spectra distributions that satisfy the pst conditions . from the energy spectrum of a given chain",
    ", the spin - spin coupling constant pattern can be obtained by solving an inverse eigenvalue problem .",
    "the robustness of each system was studied by calculating its transmission fidelity under static perturbations of the couplings .",
    "we found that robustness is characterized by two main features .",
    "one is the reduction of the transfer fidelity induced by the perturbed couplings and the other is the duration of the time window during which the transmitted state may be read out with high fidelity .",
    "the most robust systems are those with linear and quadratic energy eigenvalue distributions .",
    "these systems achieve pst at the time of the first fidelity maximum .",
    "that time may be called the spin - wave echo time , and the less robust systems reach pst only after several spin - wave echoes . by analyzing how the energy eigenstates and eigenvalues are affected by the perturbations",
    ", we found that the most robust distributions have strongly spatially localized eigenstates .",
    "thus , because the initial state is localized in one end of the chain , only few eigenstates participate in the transfer . because of the localization properties of the eigenstates the perturbations in the spin couplings close to the chain boundaries are the only significant source of errors .",
    "since these couplings are rather weak for the most robust systems , a given relative perturbation strength only causes a small absolute perturbation in the couplings and thus in the energy eigenvalues , leading to the observed robustness .",
    "the weak couplings close to the ends of the chain also lead to a longer residence time of the transmitted state at its target site at the chain boundary , causing a longer time window for read - out .",
