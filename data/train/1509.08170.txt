    "due to the increasing role of band - to - band tunneling ( btbt ) and schottky barrier ( sb ) tunneling mechanisms in electronic devices , it becomes critical to develop analytic models that allow identifying the key parameters which optimize the tunneling performance .",
    "one of the most promising tunneling device concepts is the tunneling field - effect - transistor ( tfet ) @xcite whose performance can be significantly boosted by aggressively scaling down its dimensions ( referred to as _ high performance _",
    "tfets ) @xcite .",
    "the importance of tunneling is not limited to the tunneling devices but it also affects the performance of ultra - scaled fets significantly @xcite .",
    "many approaches to tfet modeling are based on the numerical evaluation of the wentzel - kramers - brillouin ( wkb ) approximation @xcite .",
    "the wkb method has been found to be an appropriate description for tfets based on direct bandgap semiconductors with a single dominant tunneling path if the wkb inputs , namely analytic potential profile and complex bandstructure , are close to those obtained from self - consistent atomistic calculations @xcite . in other",
    "works the wkb approximation has been solved analytically for a triangular potential barrier which leads to the traditional fowler - nordheim ( fn ) tunneling transmission expression @xcite .",
    "@xmath0 where @xmath1 is the elementary charge , @xmath2 is the reduced planck constant , @xmath3 is the electric field in the transition region from source to channel , @xmath4 is the bandgap of the semiconductor , @xmath5 is the _",
    "`` tunneling effective mass''_. it is commonly assumed that @xmath6=@xmath7 , where @xmath7 is the so called _ `` reduced effective mass '' _ @xcite .",
    "this approach has been used in previous tfet modeling efforts @xcite . assuming @xmath6=@xmath7 implies that the complex bands within the bandgap of the semiconductor are parabolic . in other works",
    ", @xmath6 is assumed to be either the conductivity effective mass @xcite , or is simply treated as a fitting parameter @xcite . in this study",
    "it is shown that the appropriate definition of @xmath6 allows a more realistic description of 1 ) the ellipticity of the complex bandstructure inside the bandgap ( not parabolic ) and , 2 ) the electron / hole duality of tunneling carriers , which have both shown to be key components in modeling the btbt process @xcite .",
    "in addition , the correct evaluation of the _ `` total band bending distance ( @xmath8 ) '' _ , another key parameter in the fn formula , is discussed for different types of junctions .",
    "the use of @xmath8 and @xmath5 leads to a modified fn formula which improves its accuracy in the calculation of tunneling transmission in the on - state of tfets .    a new analytic model is ultimately presented based on 1 ) a modified version of the well - known fowler - nordheim ( fn ) equation for the on - state , 2 ) a new off - current formula which accounts for the direct tunneling from source to drain , while providing a smooth on - off transition through the introduction of a",
    "_ `` continuity factor''_. the combination of these analytic approaches allows describing the current - voltage characteristics ( i - v ) both in the on- and off - state of the device by use of simple and closed - form expressions .",
    "the results provided by the analytic model are in close agreement with state - of - the - art full - band numerical simulations using the non - equilibrium green s function ( negf ) formalism .",
    "previously , it has been demonstrated that the complex part of the band - structure is an elliptic curve ( not parabolic ) which is composed of two parts : one dominated by hole behavior , and another by electron behavior . such an elliptic curve can be described by an analytic formula within 1.4% error compared to rigorous tight - binding simulations @xcite .",
    "it can be mathematically proven that by taking into account the ellipticity of the complex bands and by assuming a constant electric field in the tunneling window , the tunneling transmission is given by ( see appendix [ app_a ] for details ) @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the reduced effective mass : @xmath11 note that ( [ eq : elp ] ) is almost identical to the transmission probability equation derived in the 1d case by kane except for a prefactor of @xmath12 @xcite .",
    "therefore , the kane s approach takes into account the elliptic complex band structure precisely even for materials with @xmath13 . through direct comparison",
    ", one can realize that equations ( [ eq : fn1 ] ) and ( [ eq : elp ] ) are equivalent expressions if the following condition is satisfied : @xmath14 in other words , equation ( [ eq : fn1 ] ) can capture the elliptic nature of the complex bandstructure if indeed @xmath5 from ( [ eq : mt ] ) and not @xmath10 from ( [ eq : mr ] ) is used .",
    "this also corrects the notion that the concept of effective mass can not be applied to btbt due to the dual electron / hole behavior of carriers as they tunnel through the bandgap @xcite . for illustration purposes , fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1]a compares the btbt transmission obtained using different choices of @xmath5 for a material with @xmath15=@xmath16=@xmath17 and @xmath4=@xmath18 . the results obtained using @xmath6=@xmath19 matches well with the numerical wkb calculation , whereas the other conventional choices of @xmath5 ( i.e. @xmath5=@xmath10 or @xmath5=@xmath20 ) lead to a significant error .    to further elucidate the practical advantage and general applicability of the concept of the tunneling effective mass",
    ", we consider two examples : 1 ) graphene nanoribbons ( gnrs ) with non - trivial energy dispersion and 2 ) metal - semiconductor schottky barriers ( sbs ) .",
    "it is well established that for gnrs , the band edge effective mass is given by @xmath21 @xcite , where @xmath22 is the group velocity of carriers within the energy range in which the dispersion is linear . by combining ( [ eq : fn1 ] ) , ( [ eq : mr ] ) and ( [ eq : mt ] ) and using @xmath23 = @xmath20 = @xmath24 due to the symmetry in the energy dispersion , the expression shown in equation ( [ eq : gnr ] ) is obtained .",
    "it is noteworthy that ( [ eq : gnr ] ) matches exactly the result reported in previous studies but found through more convoluted arguments @xcite . @xmath25",

    "in addition to the tunneling effective mass , the electric field at the tunnel junction plays an important role in the tunneling transmission probability . the electric field magnitude depends on the junction configuration .",

    "<S> in this work , an analytic model is proposed which provides in a continuous manner the current - voltage characteristic ( i - v ) of _ high performance _ tunneling field - effect transistors ( tfets ) based on direct bandgap semiconductors . </S>",
    "<S> the model provides closed - form expressions for i - v based on : 1 ) a modified version of the well - known fowler - nordheim ( fn ) formula ( in the on - state ) , and 2 ) an equation which describes the off - state performance while providing continuity at the on / off threshold by means of a term introduced as the _ `` continuity factor''_. it is shown that traditional approaches such as fn are accurate in tfets only through correct evaluation of the total band bending distance and the _ `` tunneling effective mass''_. general expressions for these two key parameters are provided . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , it is demonstrated that the tunneling effective mass captures both the ellipticity of evanescent states and the dual ( electron / hole ) behavior of the tunneling carriers , and it is further shown that such a concept is even applicable to semiconductors with nontrivial energy dispersion . </S>",
    "<S> ultimately , it is found that the i - v characteristics obtained by using this model are in close agreement with state - of - the - art quantum transport simulations both in the on- and off - state , thus providing validation of the analytic approach . </S>"
