    "in his book with hibbs @xcite feynman formulates the uncertainty principle as follows : any determination of an alternative taken by a process capable of following more than one a alternative destroys the inteference between alternatives. thus the converse is true : for a quantum system which can reach its final state via a number interfering pathways the uncertainty principle forbids specifying which of the routes has actually been taken .",
    "the latter can be quantified as follows : if the interfering pathways are labelled by some variable @xmath0 , the value of @xmath0 must remain , in some sense , indeterminate .",
    "the concepts of interfering pathways provides a convenient description of a general quantum measurement @xcite , @xcite . for a quantum system prepared in a state @xmath2 and",
    "later observed ( post - selected ) in a state @xmath3 .",
    "the transition amplitude between the states can be written as a sum over virtual paths traced by some variable @xmath4 ( e.g. , feynman paths , if @xmath5 represents the coordinate ) , which can be arranged according to the value @xmath0 of some functional @xmath6 $ ] , e.g. , the value of @xmath4 at some intermediate time , or its time average .",
    "the classes form form a discreet or continuous set of pathways connecting @xmath2 and @xmath3 and the value of @xmath0 can be determined if a system is subjected to a measurement which converts , in full analogy with the double - slit interference experiment @xcite , interfering pathways into exclusive ones .",
    "one wonders then what would be the result of trying to obtain some information about @xmath0 while keeping the interference intact . a straightforward attempt to write down even an average answer fails since",
    "no probabilities can be ascribed to the pathways , while an average formally constructed with the probability amplitudes @xmath7 @xmath8 is complex valued and its physical significance is not immediately clear .",
    "alternatively , one can consider a von neumann measurement with the interaction between the measured system and the meter deliberately reduced in order to minimise the perturbation incurred and analyse the meter s readings .",
    "this general method based on analysing inaccurate , or weak , quantum measurements , was originally formulated by aharonov et al @xcite and is closely related to the attempts to define the duration of a scattering event still debated in literature @xcite .",
    "the original approach to the problem , which leads to the so - called wigner - eisenbad time delay , or the phase time , relies on following the centre of mass of the scattered wavepacket , @xcite and has been shown to be equivalent to a weak measurement experiment @xcite .",
    "a different method was proposed by baz @xcite who considered a particle weakly coupled to a larmor clock .",
    "baz criticised the phase time of smith @xcite as generally incorrect and pointed out that elastic collision time must be a sharply defined quantity @xcite .",
    "the larmor time was shown to be a weak value of the traversal time functional @xcite in @xcite . and its relation to the complex time obtained with the help of eq.([0.1 ] ) was established in @xcite .",
    "the introduction of such a complex time has often been criticised on the grounds that any observable physical quantity must be real ( see , for example , @xcite ) .",
    "finally , the local angular momentum ( lam ) , a quantity given by an expression broadly similar to the phase time , has recently been employed in @xcite in order to identify angular momenta which contribute to an angular distribution at a given scattering angle .",
    "all above examples have a common purpose of determining , in some sense , the value of a physical variable without choosing between the alternatives which contribute to a transition .",
    "the purpose of the present paper is to analyse the origin , properties and general usefulness of weak values which occur in various contexts .",
    "the term negative probability was introduced by feynman @xcite and was used in connection with wigner functions @xcite and the tunnelling time @xcite . in a slightly different context of this paper",
    "we will show that the weak values are related to alternating improper distributions which arise because a probability amplitude may take negative values . in agreement with the uncertainty principle , averaging with such distributions effectively hides the information about interfering pathways .",
    "relative complexity of such analysis owes to fact that while , in the absence of probabilities , certain quantities may exhibit obviously wrong values , they do not have always to do .",
    "thus , there is danger of extrapolating between different cases each of which needs instead to be analysed separately .",
    "the rest of the paper is organised as follows . in section 2",
    "we list some elementary properties of improper non - positive distributions and their moments .",
    "i m sect 3 we consider a inaccurate classical meter and show that it is still possible to extract the results of an accurate measurement from the meter s readings .",
    "in section 4 we consider the quantum version of the classical meter . in sect .",
    "5 we show that , unlike in the classical case , results of an accurate quantum measurements can not be extracted from the readings of a quantum meter with a large ( quantum ) uncertainty in its initial position . rather the results are expressed in terms of the mean @xmath1 and the higher moments of the improper distribution @xmath7 in eq.([0.1 ] ) . in sect.6",
    "we consider , as an example , the double - slit experiment and equivalent measurement on a two - level system . in sect.7",
    "we show that if the reading of an inaccurate meter are average over the final states of the system , the results are expressed in terms of the mean and variance of obtained with a real distribution @xmath9 which is not , in general , non - negative . in section 8",
    "we show the impulsive von neumann measurement without post - selection to be a special case where the distribution @xmath9 is non - negative and coincides , as in the classical case of sect.3 , with the probability distribution of an accurate measurement . in section 9",
    "we use the results of sect.7 to show baz conclusion that the elastic collision time is sharply defined @xcite to be wrong . in sect.10 we show the wigner - esenbad phase time to be a weak value similar to ( [ 0.1 ] ) and briefly discuss some of its anomalous properties . in sect.11",
    "we show the lam @xcite to be a particular kind of a weak value .",
    "in sect.12 we briefly discuss the three box case considered in @xcite and further discussed in @xcite .",
    "we will show that the aharonov , leibowitz and bergmann ( abl ) rule to be a simple consequence of feynman s rule for ascribing probabilities and suggest an alternative interpretation of the three box paradox based on the uncertainty principle .",
    "section 13 contains our conclusions .",
    "consider a real function @xmath10 , contained within the interval @xmath11 , which can be used to construct a normalised distribution , @xmath12 if @xmath10 does not change sign , @xmath13 is non - negative and can , therefore , be used as a proper probability distribution to calculate various moments of the random variable @xmath0 . in this section",
    "we will assume that @xmath14 may change sign within the interval and list the consequences for the moments and averages calculated with such an improper distribution .",
    "a ) while for @xmath15 the expectation value @xmath16 always lies in the region containing the support of @xmath14 , i.e. , between @xmath17 and @xmath18 , for an alteranting @xmath10 this is no longer true . as the normalisation integral in eq.([1.1 ] ) can take either sign or vanish . for a simple example",
    "consider a function @xmath19 with the first three moments @xmath20 which yields an improper distribution for @xmath21 . for @xmath22 ,",
    "the value of @xmath23 becomes anomalously large .",
    "in general , an improper expectation value no longer gives an estimate for the location of the support of the corresponding distribution @xmath13 .",
    "b ) while , for a proper distribution @xmath24 , the equality @xmath25 forces the conclusion that @xmath0 is a sharply defined quantity , @xmath26 the variance ( [ 1.4 ] ) may vanish for a broad alternating distribution .",
    "for example , for the @xmath27 in eq.([1.2a ] ) this would be the case for @xmath28 in general , examining the first two moments of a ( possibly ) improper distribution does allow to establish whether the variable @xmath0 is sharply defined .",
    "c ) for a proper probability distribution the fact that @xmath29 where @xmath30 $ ] lies inside the interval @xmath31 $ ] , guarantees that the support of @xmath32 is contained between @xmath17 and @xmath33 and @xmath34 and @xmath18 , while for an improper distribution making such an assumption leads to an obvious contradiction .",
    "for example , for @xmath35 we have @xmath36 and adopting the above reasoning we must conclude that @xmath10 with certainty takes its values in each of two different regions , @xmath37 and @xmath38 .",
    "moreover , there is an infinite number of ways to construct subintervals of @xmath31 $ ] in each of which the integral ( [ 1.8 ] ) would vanish .",
    "thus , we can not , in general , uniquely determine which part of the interval @xmath39 contributes to the normalisation integral @xmath40 even though parts of the interval must be redundant due to the cancellation , and have to conclude that all values of @xmath0 between @xmath17 and @xmath18 are equally important .",
    "relation between this observation and the uncertainty principle , already evident , will be discussed further in sect .",
    "12 . finally , consider a normalised distribution ( [ 1.1 ] ) constructed with the help of a complex valued function @xmath10 , whose real and imaginary parts are contained in the interval @xmath41 , @xmath42 @xmath43 any such distribution can be written as as a sum of its real and imaginary parts @xmath44 normalised to unity and zero , respectively , @xmath45 it is readily seen that @xmath46 is a is a proper distribution provided both @xmath47 and @xmath48 do not change sign for @xmath49 , while , @xmath46 must alternate and can never be a valid probability distribution . for and",
    "improper @xmath46 one can expect to obtain anomalously large values of @xmath50 when both normalisation integrals @xmath51 and @xmath52 are small .",
    "for example , for @xmath53 we have @xmath54 which can indeed take very large positive and negative values in the vicinity of @xmath55 , whereas for @xmath56 , where @xmath46 in non - negative , @xmath57 remains positive and bounded by @xmath18 . in summary ,",
    "the use of proper probability distributions largely relies on interpreting the mean and variance as the location and width of the region which contains physically significant values of the random variable @xmath0 .",
    "an improper distribution can not , in general , be used for this purpose .",
    "analysis of this section may seem an exercise of little practical importance , as it is not immediately clear under which circumstances a physical quantity may be described by an alternating let alone complex - valued alternating distribution .",
    "we will , however , show that averages associated with such improper distributions naturally arise when one attempts to obtain a answer to a question conventionally not answered by quantum mechanics , such as determining the slit take by a particle in a diffraction experiment , or obtaining the value of a physical variable without perturbing the particle s motion .",
    "but first we consider the low accuracy limit of a purely classical measurement .",
    "consider a classical meter with a pointer position @xmath0 and a momentum @xmath58 coupled to a one - dimensional particle moving in a potential @xmath59 .",
    "the hamiltonian for such a system is @xmath60 where the switching function @xmath61 determines the strength of the coupling and @xmath62 is the variable to be measured . it is readily seen that if the ( conserved ) momentum and the initial position of the meter are put to zero , the pointer position time @xmath63 is given by @xmath64 so that the meter monitors the value of the functional in the r.h.s . of eq.([2.2 ] ) on the trajectory @xmath65 which is unaffected by the measurement .",
    "let us assume in addition , that at @xmath66 the initial momentum and position of the particle , @xmath67 and @xmath68 , are not known precisely , but rather are random quantities distributed with the probability density @xmath69 .",
    "since each trajectory is uniquely labeled by the values @xmath70 , the value of the functional ( [ 2.2 ] ) is a random variable with a probability distribution @xmath71 and the first two moments of the form @xmath72 and @xmath73 where , as in eq.([2.3 ] ) , @xmath74 denotes an average over all initial values @xmath67 and @xmath68 .",
    "consider next a meter whose final position can be determined accurately , but whose initial position is uncertain and is distributed around @xmath75 with a normalised probability density @xmath76 with a zero expectation value and a known variance .",
    "the two sources of uncertainty result in a simple convolution formula for the normalised distribution @xmath77 of the meter s readings , @xmath78 evaluating the generating function @xmath79 for the @xmath80-th moment of @xmath77 we find @xmath81 @xmath82 is the @xmath80-th derivative with respect to @xmath58 and we used the convolution property @xmath83 applying the leibniz product rule to the derivative ( [ 2.4 ] ) yields @xmath84 where @xmath85 are the binomial coefficients and , in particular , ( @xmath86=0 ) @xmath87 @xmath88 next we ask what , if anything , can be learned about the mean and the variance of @xmath13 in the low accuracy limit , when the initial pointer position becomes highly uncertain , @xmath89 in this case @xmath77 is a very broad distribution with the mean equal to that of @xmath13 and a large variance @xmath90 .",
    "the value @xmath91 can be obtained by taking the average @xmath92 of @xmath93 consecutive measurements .",
    "since the variance of @xmath92 is given by @xmath94 , so that to determine the value of @xmath91 to an accuracy @xmath95 , one would require a very large number of measurements @xmath96 similarly , if @xmath76 is known to a sufficient accuracy , one can use eq.([2.7 ] ) to determine the second moment of @xmath13 and , therefore , the original variance of @xmath0 . note , however , that an accurate determination would require an even larger , @xmath97 , number of observations . in summary , a classical meter with an increasingly uncertain initial position",
    "is rendered impractical because , although its readings contain the information about the mean and variance of the measured variable , the number of trials required for its extraction becomes prohibitively large .",
    "consider next a similar measurement in the quantum case .",
    "a detailed analysis of quantum meters has been given in @xcite and here we will limit ourselves to only a brief discussion required for further development .",
    "the schroedinger equation describing a system coupled to a von neumann - like @xcite meter is ( @xmath98 ) @xmath99 initially , the system is prepared in some state @xmath100 , and the meter position is set to zero , latexmath:[\\[\\label{3.2 }    uncertainty principle prevents one from setting the meter position to zero as well , which can be seen as the cause of the perturbation produced by the measurement @xcite . after the measurement , at the time @xmath63",

    "although there is no unique trajectory , as in the classical case , the transition amplitude between the initial and the final states of the system in the absence of the meter can be written as a sum over the virtual paths traced by the variable @xmath5 , @xmath106 } \\la \\psi_1|\\phi[a]\\ra\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where , as in the following , @xmath107 and @xmath108 are the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the variable of interest @xmath4 , @xmath109 it can be shown @xcite that , in the presence of the meter , @xmath7 in eq.([3.5 ] ) is given by the restricted path sum @xmath110 } \\delta(f-\\int_{0}^t \\beta(t ' ) a(t ' ) dt ' ) \\la\\psi_1|\\phi[a]\\ra.\\ ] ] the generalisation of eq.([2.3 ] ) to the quantum case is , therefore , straightforward : a quantum pointer may be shifted by an amount @xmath0 if among the paths contributing to the transition some give value @xmath0 to the functional @xmath111= \\int_{0}^t \\beta(t ' ) a(t ' ) dt'$ ] .",
    "the probability amplitude @xmath7 for the reading to occur is found by summing the amplitude @xmath112\\ra$ ] over all such paths .",
    "the support of @xmath7 ( i.e. , the set of @xmath0 such that @xmath113 ) yields , therefore , the range of the values of @xmath0 which contribute to the transition .",
    "it is also obvious that @xmath7 is a complex amplitude distribution whose normalisation integral is the unperturbed transition amplitude , @xmath114 since there are no _ apriopi _ restrictions on the sign of either @xmath115 or @xmath116 , we can not , as discussed in sect.2(c ) , in general determine which values within the support of @xmath7 contribute to the transition , in particular , when @xmath7 is of order of unity and @xmath117 is very small .",
    "this is , in essence , the feynman s uncertainty principle .",
    "one exception is the classical limit , in which a highly oscillatory @xmath7 has a stationary region near the classical value @xmath118 , which is the only contributor to the integral ( [ 3.8a ] ) @xcite . as in section 3",
    "we proceed with a discussion of a meter whose initial position so that the initial meter state in the position representation is no longer a @xmath119-function but rather some @xmath76 , with a finite width is @xmath120 .",
    "then the amplitude @xmath121 to obtain the reading @xmath0 for the system post - selected in the state @xmath103 can be written is a convolution @xcite @xmath122 which is similar to eq.([2.6 ] ) with the important difference that it relates probability amplitudes rather than the probabilities themselves .",
    "if @xmath123 is small , we find the probability to obtain a reading @xmath0 @xmath124 so that an accurate meter measures the value of @xmath111 $ ] , and may be used to evaluate the centroid and the width of the range of @xmath0 values which contribute to the transition amplitude between the states @xmath100 and @xmath103 .",
    "there is , however , a price .",
    "a measurement perturbs the system , whose state after a measurement yielding @xmath0 results not equal to that without a meter , @xmath125 where the last equality is obtained by integrating eq.([3.8 ] ) .",
    "the perturbation can be minimised by choosing @xmath76 so broad that it can be replaced by a constant , making the l.h.s .",
    "of eq.([1.5 ] ) proportional to @xmath126 with an unimportant overall factor .",
    "whereas an uncertainty in the classical meter s initial position is clearly undesirable , a similar uncertainty in the quantum case has the advantage of reducing the perturbation a measurement produces on the measured system .",
    "one then wishes to know what kind of information about a quantum system can be obtained without affecting its evolution .",
    "consider next the moments of a probability distribution for the meter s readings , @xmath127 where @xmath121 , given by eq.([3.9 ] ) , is an complex valued and , possibly , alternating amplitude distribution .",

    "rather , the values @xmath91 and @xmath154 in the classical eqs.([2.6 ] ) and ( [ 2.7 ] ) , are replaced by the weak value @xmath155 and a complicated combination of @xmath1 and @xmath156 , respectively . since there is no restriction on the phase of @xmath7 in eq.([4.11 ] ) , interpretation of these these quantities as averages requires the concept of negative probability . as a result",
    "the information about the values of @xmath151 which contribute to the transition , may be scrambled by averaging with an improper alternating distribution .",
    "this unhelpful property of the weak values @xmath1 is most easily illustrated on the double - slit diffraction experiment .",

    "they have the same form as the classical equations ( [ 2.6 ] ) and ( [ 2.7 ] ) insofar as the l.h.s . of eq.([5.7 ] ) and the second term in eq.([5.12 ] ) are the first two moments of the same distribution @xmath9 in eq.([5.8 ] ) .",
    "however , owing to the inaccuracy of the measurement , @xmath9 can , in general , change sign and one must exercise caution when using these averages .",
    "for example ,",
    "sect.2 , it has been shown that for such distributions it is possible to have @xmath212 while @xmath0 remains a distributed , rather than a sharply defined quantity .",
    "indeed , the relation ( [ 5.14 ] ) will always take place for @xmath4 and @xmath213 such that , regardless of the value of @xmath58 , @xmath202 evolves the initial state @xmath214 into the same final state @xmath215 , so that in eq.([5.8 ] ) @xmath216\\equiv s(\\lambda)\\ ] ] where @xmath217 is a real phase , as required by the unitarity . as a result we have @xmath218=\\phi ' ( 0)^2=    ( re[is^{-1}(0)s'(0)])^2= ( \\la \\bar{f } \\ra)^2.\\ ] ] while , apparently , @xmath219 \\ne \\delta ( f-\\la \\bar{f^2 } \\ra)$ ] . in summary , without post - selection one recovers the classical eqs.([2.6 ] ) and ( [ 2.7 ] ) , with the important difference that both the mean and the variance are obtained with an ( possibly ) improper distribution @xmath46 .",
    "also , as shown in sect.2 , anomalously large weak values are likely to occur for nearly forbidden transitions , whose probability is quite small . for this reason they do not contribute if the final state of the system is not controlled and an average is taken over all possible final states .",
    "next we give further examples of ( [ 5.7 ] ) and ( [ 5.12 ] ) , starting with the conventional von neumann measurement .",
    "an important special case of von neumann - like measurements described in sect .",

    "what is more , @xmath233 coincides with the probability distribution obtained for and accurate strong measurement of the variable @xmath4 in a state @xmath234 . in summary , for weak von neumann measurements without post selection we recover the classical eqs .",
    "( [ 5.7 ] ) and ( [ 5.12 ] ) which allow to extract the mean and variance , obtained in accurate measurements , from a large sample of weak results .",
    "also , finding @xmath235 would , in this case , guarantee that the variable is sharply defined , i.e. , that @xmath236 is one of the eigenstates of @xmath4 .",
    "however , extending this argument to the case when the measured quantity is not an instantaneous value of an operator can lead to errors , as will be shown in the next section .",
    "it is possible then that someone not familiar with the analysis of sect .",
    "7 and implicitly assuming the values ( [ 5.14 ] ) obtained with a weak von neumann - like meter to be proper probabilistic averages , might incorrectly conclude that the value @xmath0 of a functional @xmath111 $ ] is sharply defined , i.e. , has a unique precise value .",
    "one such example is the distribution of the elastic collision time studied by baz with the help of a weakly coupled semiclassical larmor clock @xcite . in baz approach ,",
    "a small constant magnetic field along the @xmath237-axis is created in a sphere containing the target and a particle , described in the distant past by an incoming plane wave @xmath238 is equipped with large nearly classical spin @xmath239 initially polarised along the @xmath240 axis .",

    "the matter was further discussed in refs .",
    "@xcite and and briefly mentioned in @xcite .",
    "the purpose of this section is to show that for @xmath253 @xmath242 and @xmath243 in eqs.([5.17 ] ) are just the weak values calculated for the traversal time functional @xcite ( @xmath254 ) @xmath255=\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty } \\theta_r ( \\vec{r})dt'\\ ] ] which computes the net duration spent by a feynman path @xmath256 inside the sphere of the radius @xmath252 @xcite and that these values obey eq.([5.16 ] ) .",
    "indeed , it can be shown @xcite that the final state of the clock s spin , @xmath257 , is just a superposition of rotations of its initial state @xmath258 around the @xmath237-axis by the angles @xmath259 each weighted by the amplitude distribution @xmath260 with which the duration @xmath261 contributes to the collision .",
    "thus , expanding in the eigenstates @xmath193 , @xmath262 of the @xmath237-component of the spin , @xmath263 we have @xmath264 which shows that the larmor clock is similar to von neumann like meter of a kind described in sect.4 . for a large spin polarised along",
    "the @xmath240-axis baz wrote @xmath265 which restricts @xmath266 .",
    "the matrix @xmath267 has two non - zero off - diagonal elements @xcite , @xmath268 . with the restriction on @xmath269 , for a large @xmath270 we may write @xmath271 so that in the continuous limit , @xmath272 after introducing @xmath273 we have @xmath274 in which we recognise eqs.([4.2 ] ) and ( [ 4.7 ] ) with @xmath275 and @xmath276 and eqs .",
    "( [ 5.17 ] ) are seen to be equivalent to eqs.([5.7 ] ) and ( [ 5.12 ] ) .",
    "thus , for a small larmor frequency the first of eqs.([5.17 ] ) gives the improper weak value of the traversal time eq.([5.18a ] ) .",
    "finally , for the functional ( [ 5.18 ] ) the evolution operator @xmath277 $ ] contains an additional constant potential inside the sphere of interest which modifies the scattering phase @xmath278 , so that ( cf .",
    "eq.([5.15 ] ) @xmath279\\exp(ikr)\\ ] ] and therefore , according to eq.([5.16 ] ) , @xmath280 for a rectangular potential , @xmath281 , the traversal time amplitude distribution @xmath260 in eq.([5.19 ] ) and the weak value @xmath282 vs. @xmath283 are shown in figs .",
    "3a and 3b , respectively . in summary ,",
    "the suggestion that the collision time has a precise value in elastic scattering is shown to be incorrect .",
    "rather , baz result demonstrates that , for such a single - channel collision , the real part of the traversal time amplitude , @xmath284 is a broad improper distribution with vanishing variance .",
    "as was also observed by baz @xcite , this is no longer true if a particle is post - selected in one of several channels , e.g. , for transmission across a potential barrier where both reflection and transmission are possible .",
    "a different type of the time delay variable , not directly related to the traversal time functional ( [ 5.18a ] ) or indeed to any other functional of the particle s feynman paths can be constructed as follows .",
    "consider a classical particle with a unit mass in one dimension crossing from left to right a potential @xmath59 which vanishes everywhere outside the region @xmath285 .",
    "inside the region the particle will experience a time delay or a speed up depending on whether @xmath59 is a barrier or a well .",
    "this time delay @xmath261 can be evaluated by taking a snapshot of the particle s at some large time @xmath63 and comparing it with the position of a particle that has been moving freely along the trajectory with the same initial conditions .",
    "if the distance between the two is @xmath286 , we have ( @xmath287 is the particle s initial momentum ) @xmath288 which is positive ( delay ) if the particle lags behind , or negative ( speed up ) if it lies ahead of the free one .",
    "this is a measurement which differs from the one discussed in sect.4 in that the role of the pointer is played by the particle s own position , but a measurement nevertheless .",
    "it is not surprising , therefore that a quantum extension of such a procedure is a quantum measurement .",
    "initilally one represents a particle by a wavepacket @xmath289 the transmitted part , is then given by @xmath290 where @xmath291 is the transmission amplitude . rewriting the fourier transform ( [ 7.2 ] ) as a convolution and neglecting the spreading of the wavepacket yields @xcite @xmath292 where @xmath293 and @xmath294 on sees that the transmitted wavepacket is constructed from the freely propagating envelopes each shifted by @xmath286 and weighted by the probability amplitude @xmath295 .",
    "associating with each spatial shift @xmath286 a time delay @xmath261 with the help of eq.([7.1 ] ) shows that transmission of a particle with a momentum @xmath287 involves not one but many time delays , whose amplitude distribution is given by the fourier transform ( [ 7.6 ] ) of @xmath296 .",
    "moreover , observing transmitted particle at a location @xmath240 amounts to measuring @xmath261 to the accuracy determined by the coordinate spread of the particle s initial wavepacket . to quantify the mean time delay associated with the latter one often chooses @xcite the shift of the centre of mass of the transmitted pulse relative to that of the free propagation divided by its mean velocity .",
    "@xmath297 i.e. , the expectation value of the time delay for a particle with the momentum @xmath287 measured with the apparatus function @xmath298 determined by the envelope of the pulse ( cf .",
    "eq.([3.9 ] ) ) . just as in the case of a von neumann like measurement ( [ 3.9 ] ) , an improvement in the accuracy increases the perturbation on the measured system , as a wavepacket narrow in the coordinate space has a large momentum spread . as a result ,",
    "the transmission probability @xmath299 is not equal to that for a plane wave with the momentum @xmath287 , @xmath300 in order to minimise this perturbation one can choose @xmath301 so narrow that the inequality ( [ 7.8 ] ) becomes an approximate equality , and the envelope @xmath302 becomes very broad . as was shown in sect.4 , such a measurement is weak and the mean time delay is given by the real part of the improper weak value @xmath303 with the help of eq.([7.7 ] ) it is easy to show that eq.([7.10 ] ) can also be written as ( cf .",
    "eq.([4.9 ] ) ) @xmath304 = \\partial_e \\phi(p ) \\equiv \\tau_{phase},\\ ] ] where @xmath305 is the phase of the transmission coefficient @xmath296 , @xmath306 $ ] .",
    "equation ( [ 7.11 ] ) is the standard definition of the phase time @xcite .",
    "the purpose of the above analysis has been to clarify its origin as an weak value and relate it to some of its anomalous properties .",
    "one such property property is that for tunnelling across a potential barrier @xmath307 predicts a speed up as if the classically forbidden region had been crossed infinitely fast .",
    "indeed , for tunnelling across a high rectangular barrier of a height @xmath308 and a width @xmath33 the transmission coefficient can be approximated as ( we neglect the pre - exponential factor ) @xmath309\\ ] ] so that @xmath310 at first glance this result appears to contradict the relativistic restriction that the speed of a particle or a photon may not exceed the speed of light , but only if @xmath307 is taken to be the time delay in the classical sense . in reality , it is just a spectacular example of an improper average lying outside the region of support of a continuous oscillating distribution ( [ 7.6 ] ) . indeed , as the barrier potential does not have bound states and , therefore , poles in the upper half of the complex @xmath129-plane , @xmath311 in eq.([7.6 ] ) vanishes for @xmath312 so that only positive time delays contribute to tunnelling of a particle with a momentum @xmath287 .",
    "thus the causality is not violated and the anomalous negative value ( [ 7.13 ] ) simply indicates the possibility that below the barrier destructive interference between the delayed envelopes may produced a significantly reduced advanced pulse which builds up from their front tails ( more details of this analysis can be found in @xcite ) .",
    "for a zero - width barrier , @xmath313 , the amplitude distribution @xmath314 in eq.([7.6 ] ) and the phase time ( [ 7.11 ] ) vs. @xmath283 in figs .",
    "4a and 4b , respectively .",
    "note here the principal difference between @xmath307 and the collision ( traversal ) time of the previous section . while the traversal time represented by the functional ( [ 5.18a ] ) vanishes with the size of the region of interest , @xmath307 which relates to the poles of @xmath291 in the complex @xmath129-plane remaines finite for an infinitely narrow barrier .",
    "thus the traversal time and the phase time are essentially different quantities which share the same classical limit and baz assertion that the former is correct the latter is wrong @xcite can not be sustained .",
    "a different example of a weak value is the local angular momentum , designed and applied in @xcite to analyse elastic , inelastic and reactive differential cross - sections ( dcs ) .",
    "typically , several angular momenta contribute to the scattering amplitude @xmath315 , which is given by a coherent sum over partial waves , @xmath316 where @xmath317 is the scattering angle , @xmath129 is the wavevector , @xmath318 is the total angular momentum , @xmath319 is the legendre polynomial , and @xmath320 is the @xmath321-matrix element . in order to estimate the angular momentum which contributes to a particular angle @xmath317 the authors of @xcite suggested the quantity with the units of angular momentum @xmath322,\\ ] ] which can be seen to give the correct answer in the semiclassical limit and in the forward glory scattering @xcite . as no probabilities can be assigned to the individual terms in eq.([9.1 ] ) we expect the proposed estimate ( [ 9.2 ] ) to be an improper average of some kind .",
    "using the analogy with eq.([7.11 ] ) of the previous section we can rewrite eq.([9.2 ] ) as @xmath323 where the normalised distribution @xmath324 is given by @xmath325 and @xmath326 note that the newly introduced quantity with the units of angular momentum @xmath327 takes even integer values and is not identical to the total angular momentum @xmath318 . as there are no _ apriori _ restrictions on the phase of @xmath328 ,",
    "@xmath324 may change sigh and the @xmath329 is not , in general , required to take value within the range of the partial waves which contribute to the scattering amplitude",
    ". a detailed discussion of the @xmath330 and its application to the analysis of angular scattering will be given elsewhere .",
    "as an illustration , we show in fig .",
    "3 @xmath329 for the ( @xmath331,@xmath270 and @xmath332 are the vibrational , rotational and helicity quantum numbers , respectively ) @xmath333 transition for the @xmath334 reaction @xcite at the collision energy @xmath335 .",
    "figure 3a shows the differential cross - section @xmath336 , while @xmath329 is plotted in fig.3b . and fig .",
    "3 c shows the distribution @xmath324 in eq.([9.4 ] ) near the minimum of the dcs at @xmath337 .",
    "the last example given in this section , although not directly related to weak measurements or values , fits well within the general context of this paper .",
    "consider a three - slit experiment , in which an electron or a photon may reach a detector through slits @xmath18 , @xmath157 and @xmath338 .",
    "let the amplitudes for the three pathways be @xmath339 respectively .",
    "it is obvious now that since the contributions from the routes @xmath157 and @xmath338 cancel each other , one may plug the two slits without affecting the detector count .",
    "it would be wrong , however , to conclude that the particle always travels the route @xmath18 , as the count would not be affected if the slits @xmath18 and @xmath338 were close instead . in fact , this is the situation discussed in section 2 ( c ) .",
    "the amplitude distribution for the slits can be written as @xmath340 and the integral @xmath341 gives the probability amplitude to arrive at the detector .",
    "the distribution alternates , we can not decide in a unique manner which two parts of the integral cancel each other , and must only conclude that it is not possible to determine through which slit the particle actully went .",
    "the same gedankenexperiment can presented in a slightly more intriguing form .",
    "suppose that an meter determines whether an electron goes through the slit @xmath18 but does not distinguish between the two other slits .",
    "then each electron arriving at the screen will also be registered at the slit @xmath18 .",
    "similarly , if the slit two is watched , the electron will always be found passing through it .",
    "all this is easily explained in terms of interfering and exclusive alternatives ( see chapt.1 , sect.3 of ref .",
    "@xcite ) . by watching the the slit one we produce two alternative routes the the detector : one ( i ) is through slit @xmath18 itself , and the other ( ii ) through both the slits @xmath157 and @xmath338 , which remain interfering alternatives and can not be distinguished .",
    "now we can use feynman s prescription for assigning probabilities : all interfering amplitudes must be added coherently , and then the moduli of the sums must be squared , @xmath342 @xmath343 which explicitly show that the route ( ii ) is not travelled due to the destructive interference . even though an observation is conducted in such a way that it does not change the detector count , it changes the situation and fails to provide a clue as to what actually happens to an unobserved particle .",
    "note that if all three amplitude are chosen to be positive , shutting any two slits would always effect the detector count .",
    "consider further @xcite a three level system with a zero hamiltonian @xmath344 is prepared and post - selected in the states @xmath345 is accurately measured . according to eq.([3.6 ] ) , there are only three paths connecting the initial and final states @xmath346 and @xmath347 , @xmath348 with the corresponding amplitudes given by @xmath349 the operator @xmath350 has one simple and one doubly degenerate eigenvalues of @xmath18 and @xmath17 , respectively , so that , as was shown in sect . 6 of ref.@xcite , its measurement destroys coherence between the paths in the same way as observing the particle passing through the first slit in the three - slit experiment .",
    "thus , inserting eq.([6.9 ] ) into eq.([6.3 ] ) yields @xmath351 is measured instead , @xmath352 equation ( [ 6.10 ] ) is the aharonov , leibowitz and bergmann ( abl ) rule @xcite for an operator with degenerate eigenvalues ( see eq.(5 ) of ref.@xcite ) .",
    "note that in our analysis the abl rule is a simple consequence of feynman s prescription for adding probability amplitudes ( see sect . 1 - 7 of @xcite ) and does not rely a time symmetric formulation of quantum mechanics employed in @xcite .",
    "also the feynman s uncertainty principle suggests a different interpretation of just described three box case. the authors of @xcite note that since the measurement of @xmath350 and @xmath353 , ( opening boxes 1 and 2 in the terminology of @xcite ) always yield positive results , a particle subjected to the boundary conditions ( [ 6.5])-([6.6 ] ) exists , at any intermediate time in two boxes simultaneously .",
    "alternatively , it can be argued that the measurements of the two projectors correspond to two distinct physical situations which , in turn , provide no clue as to where the particle actually is when no measurement is conducted and all three pathways remain interfering alternatives .",
    "in summary , quantum mechanics can be seen to operate by assigning probability amplitudes to scenarios or pathways which can be interpreted as classical outcomes .",
    "some of the scenarios are exclusive by nature , some are normally interfering but can be made exclusive by coupling the system to a meter and some , it appears , can not be made exclusive at all , i.g . , because a suitable meter can not be constructed . in general",
    "one wishes then to know how many outcomes are there and what is the likelihood of the realisation of a particular one .",
    "a quantum measurement can be seen as performing this taks by labelling the pathways by some variable @xmath0 and then analysing the moments of its distribution . for exclusive scenarios , e.g. ,",
    "different values of a variable @xmath4 in the presence of an accurate von neumann meter , a proper probability distribution exists _",
    "however , some phenomena such as the interference pattern in a double slit experiment or tunnelling transmission across a potential barrier rely on constructive or destructive interference between the relevant pathways . according to the feynman s uncertainty principle ,",
    "interfering scenarios can not be told apart and form , therefore , a single indivisible pathway connecting the initial and final states of a system .",
    "mathematically , the principle arises form the alternating nature of the probability amplitudes responsible for cancellation between the pathways , which , in turn , forbids the identification of the main contributor(s ) to the transition .",
    "accordingly , we have observed , that an attempt to assign a mean value to @xmath0 when it labels interfering alternatives , be it by performing a weak von neumann - like measurement , by extending to the quantum context a suitable classical procedure , as in the case of the wigner - eisenbad phase time , or by postulating of an expression with an appropriate classical limit , as in the case of the lam , leads to an improper complex weak value @xmath1 ( [ 0.1 ] ) . this can , indeed , be expected , as in the absence of probabilities , @xmath1 is the only average one can construct from a real variable and complex probability amplitudes .",
    "we note further that , contrary to what has been claimed by several authors @xcite , the complexity of @xmath1 is not in itself an obstacle to its interpretation , as the experiment always dictates which part ( s ) @xmath1 ( in our case , @xmath155 , for @xmath354 and @xmath355 see , for example @xcite ) should be used to produce the required real answer .",
    "a far more serious problem is that @xmath155 in an improper average obtained , in general , with an alternating distribution and has a number of undesirable properties discussed in sect.2 .",
    "in particular it may lie outside the region containing the support of the amplitude distribution , e.g. , the spectrum of the measured variable in the case of an impulsive von neumann measurement or the range of the time delays prescribed by the causality in the case of the phase time , and take anomalous large valued of either sign even when this support is bounded .",
    "just because improper averages can take values which appear unreasonable does not mean that they always do that .",
    "in particular the amplitude distribution employed in their construction may or may not be improper for all transitions , just as for some selected states the wigner function @xmath356 does not always take negative values",
    ". in general , quantum interference hides the information about the range of the values contributing to the transition in a way that one can never trust a weak value to represent the centroid of the range without a detailed inspection of the distribution itself . of course , if such an inspection is possible , there is no longer a need to evaluate the mean ( [ 0.1 ] ) . in the end",
    "one can not avoid asking of whether the weak values should be treated as true properties of a system in the presence of interference , or a manifestation of a failure of a measurement designed to defy the uncertainty principle .",
    "both points of view are , in principle , possible .",
    "the former , expressed in @xcite is reinforced by the notion that a weak value may be obtained in an act of measurement and , therefore , provides the only answer to the question about the value taken by a variable in the presence of interference .",
    "there is also no other correct answer to refute it .",
    "however , a suggestion that with only two slits present an electron passes on average through the slit number @xmath163 , or that a tunnelling particle spends on average a zero time within a barrier thereby defying the relativity , clearly requires further clarification .",
    "the explanation that the weak value is not actually tied to the range of the values contributing to the transition ( numbers 1 and 2 of the slits or purely non - negative time delays in the case of the barrier ) seriously diminishes the value of the information a weak measurement can provide .",
    "an alternative view can be summarised as follows .",
    "interfering pathways can not be told apart without destroying coherence between them and , with it , the studied transition . with the information destroyed by interference , a suitable answer to the above question",
    "simply does not exist .",
    "if one insists , e.g. , by employing an extremely inaccurate weak meter , both the theory and experiment provide , much like a politician or a manager , a kind of non - answer , not necessarily related to what has been asked . in a similar manner feynman s uncertainty principle can be used to resolve the three box paradox of sect .",
    "if no measurements are conducted , the particle can not be said to be in either particular box .",
    "opening one of the box creates a new physical situation and two exclusive pathways to which one can now assign probabilities which , however tell us nothing about the case when no measurements are made .",
    "the world resolve is put in quotes because the pathway analysis does not explain the logical difficulties @xcite associated with quantum interference , but simply compacts them into the feynman s formulation of the uncertainty principle .",
    "we conclude by quoting feynman on the double - slit experiment:@xcite : `` we choose to examine a phenomenon which is impossible , _ absolutely _ impossible , to explain in any classical way ... in reality , it contains the _ only _ mystery . '' .",

    "<S> a quantum transition can be seen as a result of interference between various pathways ( e.g. feynman paths ) which can be labelled by a variable @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> an attempt to determine the value of @xmath0 without destroying the coherence between the pathways produces the weak value of @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> we show @xmath1 to be an average obtained with amplitude distribution which can , in general , take negative values which , in accordance with the uncertainty principle , need not contain information about the actual range of @xmath0 which contribute to the transition . </S>",
    "<S> it is also demonstrated that the moments of such alternating distributions have a number of unusual properties which may lead to misinterpretation of the weak measurement results . </S>",
    "<S> we provide a detailed analysis of weak measurements with and without post - selection . </S>",
    "<S> examples include the double slit diffraction experiment , weak von neumann and von neumann - like measurements , traversal time for an elastic collision , the phase time , the local angular momentum ( lam ) and the three - box case of _ aharonov et al_. </S>"
