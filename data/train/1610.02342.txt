    "white dwarf stars are of critical importance in many contexts , from defining the initial - final mass relation of low and intermediate mass stars ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) to acting as independent chronometers for different components of the galaxy ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    for all of these investigations we require accurate estimates of the masses and temperatures of these stars .",
    "by far the most widely used technique , termed the `` spectroscopic method '' , involves fitting a model atmosphere to an observed spectrum of a star , and varying the @xmath0 and @xmath1 values to match the width and intensities of the spectral lines @xcite , and optionally the continuum as well .",
    "the set of best - fit parameters are then identified as estimates of the temperature and surface gravity of the white dwarf .",
    "problems in applying this method can arise from many sources of uncertainty : surface composition , the physics of convection , atomic physics , magnetic fields , etc . recently , progress has been made on the effect of convection on the parameters derived from spectroscopic fits of white dwarfs ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , but the other sources of uncertainty remain .    as an illustration of this , in figure  [ sirius ]",
    "we show three different fits to a spectrum of sirius  b @xcite .",
    "all the fits reproduce the spectrum quite well but derive different estimates for the @xmath0 and @xmath1 of the star .",
    "the same model - atmosphere code tlusty @xcite was used to compute these fits ; the only differences arose from the treatment of the atomic physics of line profiles and the occupation probability ( op ) of atomic states .",
    "tlusty includes op put forth by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the @xcite op defines the ionization threshold by the @xcite criteria . however , there are other studies that show different ionization criteria @xcite .",
    "we therefore calculated model spectra with a different ionization criteria ( defined by the saddle point in the potential ) to compare the possible uncertainties in the @xmath1 ( yellow line in fig [ sirius ] ) .    to resolve this discrepancy",
    "we would hope to appeal to independent techniques for determining sirius b s parameters .",
    "unfortunately , astrometric and gravitational - redshift techniques disagree with each other , and with the spectroscopic method ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "thus , the time seems ripe to re - visit the physics of line formation in white dwarf atmospheres .",
    "for an isolated atom , the atomic structure can often be calculated quite accurately .",
    "this is certainly the case for the hydrogen atom , since both the schrdinger and dirac equations have exact solutions . on the other hand ,",
    "if the atom is embedded in a plasma , then it inherently becomes a many - body problem , and solutions are possible only within a set of approximations and methods .        in figure  [ tree",
    "] , we depict the various approximations and approaches commonly used in line - profile calculations . the black , bold - faced text boxes correspond to the approximations adopted by @xcite and are commonly termed `` vcs theory '' , while the red , bold - faced text boxes show the set of approximations used in our new `` semi - analytic '' theory .",
    "we note that the recent improved line - profile calculations of @xcite are essentially vcs theory plus the @xcite and @xcite formalism for treating continuum lowering and level dissolution . @xcite and @xcite define an ionization criteria for a given energy level , then perform a statistical average over plasma electric fields to determine the probability that the state is still `` occupied '' ; this is known as occupation probability .",
    "we have begun a program to re - examine the approximations shown in figure  [ tree ] with an eye to which ones can be improved . to date , we have employed two approaches to this problem : 1 ) a simulation - based ( @xmath2-body ) approach , and 2 ) a semi - analytic approach . the simulation approach treats the perturbing influences of the protons and electrons classically and then solves the time - dependent schrdinger equation numerically to obtain the broadened profiles . the semi - analytic approach treats the perturbing electrons quantum mechanically ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* gomez et al . , in prep ) and then solves the time-_independent _ schrdinger equation for the hydrogen atom in the presence of several nearby protons .",
    "both methods are able to explore different approximations and physical effects . for instance",
    ", we have used the simulation approach to explore ion dynamics ( not discussed here ; see * ? ? ? * for more details ) and the importance of higher - order multipoles ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) of the interaction potential .",
    "we will use the semi - analytic approach to examine the importance of a quantum treatment of electrons and an ab initio treatment of continuum lowering @xcite .",
    "we have recently published results that improve the treatment of the electrostatic interaction potential . in @xcite",
    ", we use a simulation method to examine the importance of the higher - order terms in the multipole expansion of the interaction potential and the validity of the dipole approximation .",
    "while most calculations include only the dipole term , corresponding to a spatially constant electric field , we explored the effect which including higher - order gradients in the field ( the quadrupole , octupole , and sedecapole terms ) had on the detailed line - profile shape . for electron densities up to @xmath3e / cc , we found that it was necessary to retain up to the quadrupole terms for both electrons and ions in the multipole expansion to correctly infer the density to within a few percent .",
    "in addition , these higher - order terms allowed us to match the height asymmetry seen in the `` red '' and `` blue '' central peaks of h@xmath4 ( solid line in figure  [ asym ] ) .",
    "this is the first time that a theoretical calculation has been able to match this asymmetry for densities of @xmath5@xmath3e / cc .",
    "while this feature is not usually seen in white dwarf spectra , it can be used as a density diagnostic for laboratory plasmas @xcite .",
    "the red text boxes in figure  [ tree ] show the approximations used in our semi - analytic approach .",
    "it differs from vcs ( or tb ) in that it : 1 ) has a _ quantum _ treatment of the perturbing electrons , 2 ) uses a full coulomb interaction of the perturbing electrons with the radiating - atom wave function , including penetrating collisions , and 3 ) computes an exact numerical solution of the schrdinger equation in the @xmath2-body potential of the nearby ions .    at high densities , the electric fields of nearby protons cause the energy levels of the radiating atom to begin to cross ; this is termed the `` inglis - teller limit '' @xcite .",
    "the current reasoning @xcite is that when energy levels cross , then the state is considered dissolved into the continuum .",
    "preliminary results for the proton - dependent energy - level structure show that discrete states exist beyond the inglis - teller limit , but , due to the averaging of the different proton configurations and the electron broadening , the spectrum appears featureless above this threshold .",
    "this approach produces a different spectral shape for lines near the continuum compared to the standard treatment ; this could result in systematically different inferred masses for white dwarf stars .",
    "we do not yet have results for the calculations using the approach described in section  [ sa ] . as an illustration , however , in figure  [ hb2 ] we show a comparison of a preliminary calculation using our semi - analytic model with the results of vcs and tb models .",
    "our new @xmath2-body atomic - structure calculation reveals many discrete states between 2.9 and 3.0  ev .",
    "however , when an average is taken over different free - proton configurations , these transitions are no longer discernible and the spectrum appears to be continuous .",
    "this direct treatment of proton perturbations results in a lowered opacity redward of the h@xmath4 line compared to the vcs and tb calculations .",
    "finally , we note that our quantum electron - broadening treatment produces broader h@xmath4 and h@xmath7 profiles for these conditions ( @xmath8 , @xmath9 ) .",
    "this ab initio calculation illustrates the potential power of this approach : we are able to solve for eigenstates spanning a broad range of conditions , from tightly bound and minimally perturbed to beyond the inglis - teller limit , all without recourse to an ad - hoc occupation - probability treatment . besides providing a more self - consistent treatment of line profiles , this approach could lead to a parameterization of the `` effective occupation probability '' of different atomic states that could be incorporated into model - atmosphere and other atomic codes .",
