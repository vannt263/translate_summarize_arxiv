    "a nematic gel is basically a polymer gel embedded in a nematic solvent @xcite . to make these two systems compatible ,",
    "the polymer of the gel is normally formed from monomer molecules that have a nematogen - like side chain attached to the reactive group that will form the polymer backbone . as in an ordinary polymer gel ,",
    "the volume fraction of nematic solvent is of order 90% .",
    "the fundamental interaction between the polymer chains and the nematic is an orientational coupling . here",
    "we will assume that the flexible polymer backbone has a tendency to be aligned parallel to the nematic director .",
    "the primary implication of this coupling is that at the isotropic to nematic phase transition , a typical polymer coil in the gel transforms from a spherical object in the isotropic phase to a prolate ellipsoid aligned with its long axis parallel to the director in the nematic phase .",
    "because the polymer coils are cross - linked in the gel , this shape transformation carries over from the individual polymer coils to the sample as a whole , leading to a spontaneous elongation of the entire sample parallel to the director .",
    "this simple view of the transition assumes that the director is uniformly aligned throughout the sample .",
    "experimentally this is found not to be the case in real materials , unless some step has been taken to bias the orientation of the director in the material @xcite . in an unbiased sample ,",
    "some kind of macroscopically isotropic , multidomain , nematic appears , the exact nature of which is not currently known . since spontaneous elongation parallel to the director",
    "minimizes the free energy , this multi - domain state must combine some degree of local elongation , along with overall average isotropy .",
    "the problem is to see how to combine local elongations of many different orientations in an elastically compatible way .    in this paper",
    ", we study a problem that has elements of the general problem alluded to above .",
    "we examine the question of how a single domain of a cholesteric mesophase can form at the isotropic to cholesteric transition . in the ordinary cholesteric helix",
    ", the underlying nematic director is oriented perpendicular to the helix axis .",
    "if one tries to imagine local spontaneous elongations parallel to the director , there is a serious problem , since every quarter turn of the helix , the elongations would be in orthogonal directions , a clear impossibility .",
    "we suggest as a possible solution to this problem a compromise between the full twisting of the cholesteric helix , and the overall elongation of the sample .",
    "it is a conical helix , in which at every point in the helix , the director rotates by an angle @xmath0 toward the helix axis , and the sample can elongate parallel to the helix axis .",
    "a 90 degree rotation would change the cholesteric into a nematic , with the maximum elongation of the sample .",
    "we explore the possibility that some smaller rotation angle will minimize the free energy as a compromise between elongation and twisting .",
    "to study the isotropic  cholesteric transition we model the gel following the approach of ref .",
    "we describe the orientational degrees of freedom using the symmetric ",
    "traceless nematic order parameter @xmath1 , rather than a director @xmath2 , in order to describe the development of orientational order .",
    "the gel is modeled as an isotropic elastic medium ; its free energy can be written in terms of the right cauchy ",
    "green tensor @xmath3 , or equivalently the left cauchy  green tensor @xmath4 .",
    "the latter tensor transforms like a rank2 tensor under rotations in the target space of the elastic medium , i.e. , the space defined by the locations of the mass points _",
    "after _ a distortion .",
    "the former tensor , on the other hand , transforms like a rank2 tensor under rotations in the reference space , defined by the locations of the mass points _ before _ a distortion occurs .",
    "the nematic order parameter tensor @xmath1 also transforms as a rank2 tensor in the target space .",
    "thus , in constructing the free energy , the coupling of the elastic degrees of freedom to the nematic degrees of freedom must involve contractions of @xmath1 with @xmath4 , rather than @xmath3 .",
    "the cauchy ",
    "green tensors are given by : @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the displacement vector associated with the elastic distortion , and @xmath7 denotes @xmath8 , with @xmath9 the _",
    "_ i__th component of the position vector of the mass points in the reference space .",
    "note that @xmath10 in general , while to linear order in @xmath11 , the two elastic tensors are equal .",
    "we use the summation convention throughout , summing over repeated indices , which span the three  dimensional reference space .",
    "the free energy density @xmath12 of the gel consists of an isotropic elastic term @xmath13,a term @xmath14 describing the nematic degrees of freedom ( including gradient terms ) , and a term @xmath15 which couples the elastic and nematic degrees of freedom ; @xmath16 the elastic energy @xmath13 is given in by : @xmath17 where @xmath18 and @xmath19 are the lam coefficients .",
    "it suffices to consider only terms quadratic in @xmath3 .",
    "the free energy @xmath14 describing the nematic degrees of freedom is a sum of gradient @xcite and bulk terms : @xmath20 the elastic constants @xmath21 and @xmath22 are related to the frank elastic constants and the nematic order parameter @xmath23 by : @xmath24 where @xmath25 , and @xmath26 are the splay , twist and bend frank constants respectively , @xmath27 is the cholesteric torsion of the mesogenic molecules , and @xmath28 is the fully antisymmetric levi ",
    "civita tensor .",
    "the pitch of the ordinary cholesteric helix would be @xmath29 .",
    "terms of higher order in @xmath1 would be required to break the equality of the bend and splay elastic constants @xcite .",
    "the simplest coupling between the elastic and nematic degrees of freedom is given by : @xmath30 just as in the case of the _ i ",
    "n _ transition . here",
    "@xmath31 is the symmetric ",
    "traceless part of @xmath4 : @xmath32 .",
    "in fact , the only difference between the energy @xmath12 used here and the corresponding one used in ref .",
    "@xcite , is the presence in @xmath12 of the gradient terms proportional to @xmath21 and @xmath22 , which are required to describe cholesteric ordering .    as in ref .",
    "@xcite , it is convenient to complete the squares in the terms in @xmath12 involving @xmath33 and @xmath31 and write : @xmath34 where @xmath35 with @xmath36 and @xmath37 . here",
    "@xmath38 is the bulk modulus of the gel , given in terms of the lam coefficients by : @xmath39 .",
    "we now consider the isotropic ",
    "cholesteric transition within mean  field theory , minimizing the free energy @xmath12 as a function of @xmath33 , and the independent components of the symmetric ",
    "traceless tensors @xmath40 , and @xmath1 .",
    "this minimization requires care on two scores .",
    "first , elastic compatibility must be ensured . the six quantities @xmath41 must obey compatibility equations consistent with the existence of an underlying single  valued continuous displacement field @xmath11 . if we linearize the cauchy ",
    "green elastic tensors , compatibility requires @xcite : @xmath42    second , minimizing with respect to the nematic degrees of freedom requires an _ ansatz _ for the nature of the ordering . while gel",
    " blue phases \" could in principle form , with local elongations parallel to the double twist axes , here we consider the simpler possibility of a conical helical phase , which will allow the gel to elongate along the pitch axis ( with small shears about this axis ) , yet still gain twist energy from the helical ordering .",
    "minimization of the free energy will determine the optimal opening angle of the cone .",
    "a conical helix also forms in ordinary cholesterics in the presence of suitably strong ( but not too strong ) magnetic fields , if @xmath43 @xcite .",
    "the qualitative similarity between a cholesteric in a magnetic field and a cholesteric gel is not surprising , given the form of the coupling proportional to @xmath44 appearing in @xmath15 .    assuming that the pitch axis in the ordered state lies along the @xmath45 axis , and the director makes an angle @xmath0 with the @xmath46 plane ( so that @xmath47 corresponds to the ordinary helix ) , @xmath1 is given by :    @xmath48    where @xmath23 is the magnitude of the nematic order parameter , and @xmath49 is the torsion of the conical helix in the gel .",
    "these latter two quantities will be determined from the minimization procedure .    within a mean  field theory treatment , there will be no dependence on the @xmath50 and @xmath51 coordinates , in which case the compatibility equations , eqs .",
    "( [ c1 ] ) , ( [ c4 ] ) , and ( [ c5 ] ) are trivially satisfied and eqs .",
    "( [ c2 ] ) , ( [ c3 ] ) and ( [ c6 ] ) reduce respectively to : @xmath52    these latter compatibility equations represent integrable ( i.e. holonomic ) constraints on the components of the elastic tensor .",
    "we expect these components to be proportional to @xmath53 or @xmath54 , and thus integrating these equations produces the constraints : @xmath55 where @xmath56 is independent of @xmath45 , and we have assumed cylindrical symmetry about the @xmath45 axis . while the component @xmath57 could on the basis of eq .",
    "( [ vxy ] ) be nonzero , minimization of @xmath12 along with the form of @xmath1 , eq .",
    "( [ qmatrix ] ) , shows that the equilibrium value of @xmath57 is in fact zero .",
    "for simplicity we consider from this point on the incompressible limit , @xmath58 ( in fact , real gels are nearly incompressible ) , in which case : @xmath59    using eqs .",
    "( [ c33])([incompress2 ] ) we minimize @xmath12 with respect to @xmath60 and @xmath61 and find : @xmath62    using eqs .",

( [ minthetab ] ) has the same form as the equation that determines the optimal value of @xmath0 for a cholesteric with magnetic susceptibility anisotropy @xmath67 in an effective magnetic field @xmath68 , with @xmath69    using eqs .",
    "( [ minq ] ) and ( [ minthetab ] ) , the values of @xmath49 and @xmath0 which minimize @xmath12 obey : @xmath70 in terms of the constant @xmath71 and using eq .",
    "( [ k33 ] ) , this relationship can be written as @xmath72 note that @xmath49 and @xmath73 have the same sign .",
    "since the ratio of @xmath26 to @xmath74 plays an important role , we define this ratio as @xmath75 for the discussion below .    using eq .",
    "( [ qq0 ] ) to eliminate @xmath49 , we find that the free energy can be written as @xmath76 and the solution to eq .",
    "( [ minthetab ] ) obeys : @xmath77 note that @xmath78 is independent of @xmath23 ( recall eq .",
    "( [ k33 ] ) ) , so this equation is independent of @xmath23 and the determination of the optimal angle @xmath0 is therefore independent of the value of @xmath23 , as long as nematic order exists .",
    "however , as can be seen from eq .",
    "( [ sminhighb ] ) , @xmath23 does depend on @xmath0 .",
    "the constant @xmath79 is a measure of the chiral bending energy in the conical helix , @xmath80 , measured in terms of the coupling energy of the nematic order to the strain field in the sample . to picture the trade - off between spontaneous elongation of the nematic and the chiral energy of the helix , start with @xmath81 ; for this value , the free energy is minimized for @xmath82 , a simple nematic , with no helix .",
    "for small @xmath78 , @xmath83 , or @xmath84 , and the helix appears with @xmath85 . in other words ,",
    "even the slightest chirality produces a helix , with a small cone angle @xmath86 , and a pitch @xmath87 in which bend is the dominant curvature , as indicated by the factor @xmath75 .",
    "the factor @xmath75 also determines how the cone angle grows , i.e. , how @xmath0 decreases , with increasing @xmath73 , or increasing @xmath78 , as shown in fig .",
    "[ theta - beta ] .",
    "the optimum angle @xmath0 of the conical helix as a function of the chirality parameter @xmath78 , for three values of the elastic constant ratio @xmath88 and 0.5 , for the upper , middle , and lower curves , respectively . ]",
    "real materials have positive values of @xmath75 , on the order of 2 . as seen in fig .",
    "[ theta - beta ] , for values of @xmath75 less than about 1.5 , as @xmath78 is increased to 1 , @xmath0 decreases smoothly to zero , restoring the ordinary cholesteric helix . for larger values of @xmath75 ,",
    "as @xmath78 grows , @xmath0 decreases smoothly , and then at some value of @xmath78 greater than 1 , @xmath0 jumps discontinuously to zero .",
    "this is a trade - off between bend and twist energy in the helix ; since the twist elastic constant is much less than the bend constant , the initially bend - dominated helix can lower its energy by this transformation . while the helix is either gradually or suddenly changing from bend to twist , its pitch is also evolving toward the value determined by pure twist , as indicated by eq .",
    "( [ qq0 ] ) .    to summarize , other than the scaling of the helix energy to the strain energy in determining the constant @xmath78 , the geometric properties of the conical helix are determined by the nematic elastic energies .",
    "it is interesting to estimate the strength of the chirality needed to produce a significant cone angle .",
    "if we look at the case @xmath81 , the spontaneous elongation of the sample on entering the nematic phase is of order @xmath89 .",
    "let us set this to a value 2 .",
    "the other factor needed in evaluating @xmath78 for the conical helix is the length @xmath90 . estimating @xmath91 j / m , and @xmath92 j / m@xmath93 , for a weak gel , this length is of order 0.1 @xmath19 m . using these numbers , to achieve a value of @xmath78 of about 0.5",
    ", we need a helix pitch of a few tenths of a micrometer .",
    "this pitch is common for highly chiral nematics .",
    "now we turn to the nematic ordering and the elastic deformation of the sample due to the presence of the conical helix .    because of the form of the coupling of the nematic order to the strain field",
    ", the energy of the conical helix only enters into a term in the free energy proportional to @xmath94 , meaning that the chiral energy simply lowers the transition temperature of the isotropic to cholesteric phase transition , relative to what it would be for @xmath95 .",
    "this effect is familiar for cholesterics in general .",
    "more interesting is the effect of the conical helix on the shape of the sample .",
    "the elastic distortion induced by the phase transition can be determined from eqs .",

[ small ] . for large cone angle , i.e. , for @xmath102 , the helix is close to its twist form , and in fact the sample has shrunk along the helix axis , and expanded laterally , again with ridges , as shown in fig .",
    "[ large ] .",
    "this unexpected deformation represents a compromise in which again there is elongation parallel to the local director in the helix , but elastic compatibility demands equal elongation perpendicular to both the director and the helix axis , with shrinkage parallel to the helix axis to maintain constant volume .",

    "in conclusion , we have found that the conical helix is a possible free energy minimizing texture of the cholesteric gel phase .",
    "it allows for a combination of local elongation of the system parallel to the nematic director , with some twisting due to the chirality of the material .",
    "it is fascinating to speculate on the existence of more complex textures that may offer an even better accommodation of the competing tendencies for spontaneous elongation and twist .",
