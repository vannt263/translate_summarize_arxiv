    "the galactic black hole transients show several correlated spectral and temporal variability properties during outbursts , denoted as spectral states . during the initial rise and at the end of the decay before quiescence , these transients are usually in the `` low - hard '' state ( lhs ) . in this state",

    ", the source may evolve through a combination of `` thermal dominant '' and `` steep power - law '' states . in the thermal dominant state ( tds )",
    ", the soft disk component dominates the spectrum , and the timing noise is very low or absent . in the steep power law state ,",
    "the power - law flux in the 220 kev band accounts for more than 50% of the flux and has a photon index ( @xmath2 ) greater than 2.4 . moderate variability and qpos are observed in this state .",
    "there also exist intermediate states ( is ) , where source characteristics do not fit into the steep power law , tds , or lhs , but show various combinations of these states ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* for detailed discussion of spectral states ) . throughout this work",
    ", we will use the name is for the particular intermediate state between the tds and the lhs during the outburst decay .",
    "even though these states were historically characterized using x - ray observations , changes in other bands occur as well . in the tds , the radio emission from the compact core",
    "is quenched @xcite .",
    "optically thin outflows are sometimes detected during state transitions @xcite , and powerful , compact jets are always observed in the lhs @xcite .",
    "the optical and infrared emission also show state dependent properties @xcite .",
    "the multi - wavelength observations made during the decaying portion of the outbursts provide valuable information about black hole transients because of the very high probability of observing transitions from the tds to the is , and eventually to the lhs @xcite .",
    "the changes during the transitions can reveal the geometry and the physical environment of these systems before and after the transitions @xcite .",
    "the lhs contains additional information due to strong variability , and strong radio emission , both correlating with spectral parameters .",
    "our group has been observing these transients during outburst decay in x - rays with the _ rossi x - ray timing explorer _ ( _ rxte _ ) and in radio to understand the evolution before , during and after the state transitions @xcite .",

    "a uniform analysis of all black hole transients observed with @xmath3daily coverage with _",

    "this change in the rms amplitude is almost always accompanied by a sharp increase in the power - law flux .",
    "there is also evidence that the strong rms noise is only observed when the power - law flux from the source is above a certain percentage of the total flux .",
    "this sharp change in rms amplitude of variability is noted as the time of state transition from the tds to a harder state in @xcite , and the same definition will be applied here . during the outburst decay , the photon index , the disk temperature , and the disk flux",

    "the duration for the td - like case is of the order of a day .",
    "interestingly , the photon index decreased during the td - like observation , returning to the value measured right before the transition to the is .",
    "qpos with decreasing frequency were observed in ten observations after the transition .",
    "after mjd  52933 , the rms amplitude of variability increased , the photon index hardened , and the inner disk temperature and the dbb flux decreased smoothly . at the end of this evolution , the source was in the lhs .",
    "the transition to the lhs was smooth , and it is hard to determine when the source left the is .",
    "based on the @xcite criteria ( spectrum dominated by the power - law component , 1.5 @xmath21 @xmath2  @xmath212.1 , rms amplitude of variability @xmath1 10% ) , the transition happened around mjd  52938 .",
    "in the lhs the photon index hovered between 1.7 and 1.9 until mjd  52956 .",
    "the rms amplitude of variability increased until mjd  52950 .",
    "after this date , the statistical quality of the data was not good enough to determine the rms amplitude of variability .",
    "it has been well established that the black hole transients show several correlations between spectral and temporal parameters ( * ? ? ? * and references therein ) . during outburst",
    "decays , the photon index shows the strongest correlations ( or anti - correlations ) with the qpo frequency and the rms amplitude of variability @xcite .",
    "we plotted these parameters as a function of photon index in fig .",
    "[ fig : indcor ] . we also included the plr as a function of photon index , as it shows a strong correlation with the rms amplitude of variability in the is .",
    "[ fig : indcor ] shows that the rms amplitude of variability is strongly anti - correlated ( linear correlation coefficient of -0.949 ) , and the qpo frequency is strongly correlated ( linear correlation coefficient of 0.987 ) with the photon index .",
    "notice that there might be a turnover ( or a saturation ) in the qpo-@xmath2  relation , as seen earlier for other sources by @xcite .",
    "the td - like observation is not shown .",
    "obviously , it does not obey the anti - correlation between the rms amplitude of variability and @xmath2 .",
    "another interesting relation is between the rms amplitude of variability and the disk flux .",
    "it is well known that the rms amplitude of variability increases with energy for systems with significant disk emission @xcite , but once this disk component is not significant , the relation between rms amplitude of variability and energy is not predictable @xcite . in fig .",
    "[ fig : rmsen ] , we show the rms amplitude of variability for two energy bands , their ratio and the plr .",
    "the presence of dbb emission clearly reduces the rms amplitude of variability in 36 kev band . for most of the observations during which the dbb emission is not significant , the ratio between rms amplitudes of variability is consistent with being unity .",
    "but when the last six observations are grouped , it is clear that the 615 kev band rms amplitude of variability is higher than that of the 36 kev band .",
    "in general , the evolution of spectral and temporal parameters of h1743@xmath0322  show very similar characteristics to the evolution of other black hole systems during outburst decay .",
    "the transition from the tds to the is is sharp , and is marked by a jump in the rms amplitude of variability , the power - law flux and the plr @xcite .",
    "we note that , during the transition , both the power - law flux and the plr increase substantially .",
    "but the sudden increase in the plr is always due to a sudden increase in the power - law flux , and not due to a sudden decrease in dbb emission .",
    "therefore , the physical change that causes the state transition is associated with a sudden increase in the power - law flux . on the other hand ,",
    "the plr provides a threshold for strong variability . after the transition from the tds to the",
    "is , the dbb flux and the inner disk temperature steadily decreases , and finally the source reaches the lhs .    a detailed discussion of several scenarios which could result in such evolution during the decay is given for 4u  1543@xmath047 in @xcite .",
    "h1743@xmath0322  shows quite similar spectral and temporal evolution in x - rays to 4u  1543@xmath047 .",
    "in addition , for both cases , the radio core was only detected after the sources reached their hardest levels , and not detected right after the transition to the is . for h1743@xmath0322 , the fits never require a high energy cut - off in the spectrum , while for 4u  1543@xmath047 , a cut - off is observed only during the transition to the lhs .",
    "it is possible that a portion of electrons are non - thermal for both sources , at least in the tds and is @xcite .",
    "for h1743@xmath0322 the evolution of @xmath22  is consistent with an accretion disk receding away from the black hole ( and the drop in qpo frequency may also be an indication of this ) .",
    "the evolution of the plr and @xmath2  indicate a comptonizing medium ( either an independent corona or base of a jet ) getting stronger as the decay progresses .",
    "the lack of adequate multi - wavelength coverage does not allow us to strongly constrain the details of different models as we were able to do for 4u  1543@xmath047 .",
    "even though most of the properties of h1743@xmath0322  are generic to the black hole transients during decay , it also showed two unexpected behaviors .",
    "the first one is the td - like observation on mjd  52932 .",
    "once the transition to a harder state occurs , it is unusual for a system to go back to the previous , softer state just for a day during the outburst decay .",
    "( short branchings to harder states are common , such as branching seen in the 1998 outburst of xte  j1550@xmath0564 , @xcite ) .",
    "for the 14 outburst decays analyzed in @xcite , only xte  j1859@xmath23226 showed a similar behavior in its outburst decay in 1999 .",
    "after the transition to the is at mjd  51524 , xte  j1859@xmath23226 transited back to the tds twice for a short time @xcite .",
    "a recent report indicates that during the decay of the 2002/2003 outburst of gx  339@xmath04 , the source transited back to the tds for three days after the transition to the is @xcite .",
    "we note that these branchings with time scales of a few days may be more common , as frequent monitoring is required to catch them .",
    "if we examine the cases source by source , rather than outburst by outburst , from the seven transients that have been observed with daily monitoring , three sources showed this behavior .",
    "the is is a transitional state between the tds and the lhs , but these branchings imply that the evolution is not monotonic .",
    "transitions back and forth to the tds can occur on a time scale of days .",
    "in contrast , once the source is in the hard state and the x - ray luminosity keeps decreasing , the process is irreversible , there is no example ( as best of our knowledge ) of a transition back to the is or the tds .",
    "second unexpected behavior is the slight increase in photon index ( @xmath36% ) during the transition to the is ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : evol1 ] ) .",
    "the only other case that showed an increase in photon index during a transition from the tds to the is is the 2000 outburst of xte  j1550@xmath0564 @xcite . during such transitions , the power - law index usually does not change , or decreases somewhat @xcite .",
    "for both h1743@xmath0322 , and xte  j1550@xmath0564 , the power - law flux and the plr showed a sudden increase , while the photon index also increased .",
    "however , for h1743@xmath0322 , this transition resulted in an increase in rms amplitude of variability , whereas for xte  j1550@xmath0564 , it resulted in a decrease of rms amplitude of variability .",
    "note that the conditions for these two transitions were not the same .",
    "for h1743@xmath0322 , the transition was from tds to an is , whereas for xte  j1550@xmath0564 , the transition was from a soft is to a harder is , en route to the lhs .      in the tds ,",
    "the bulk of the emission comes from the disk as multi - color blackbody radiation .",
    "the evolution of the dbb component during the transition to the is is smooth . on the other hand",
    ", the power - law component in the x - ray spectrum shows a sudden change , and is perhaps associated with the state transition . for the power - law component , the two important observations are ( 1 ) a sudden ( less than a day ) and a strong ( 100% ) increase in the flux , and ( 2 ) a small change ( 6% increase ) in the photon index .",
    "we note that an increase in the power - law flux with only little or no change in the power - law index is a universal property of the state transitions that coincide with appearance of timing noise and qpos for most of the black hole systems @xcite . in this section ,",
    "we discuss various scenarios that may explain the evolution of the power - law component during the transition to the is .    for thermal comptonization ,",
    "the photon index depends on two parameters of the corona : the temperature and the optical depth of the comptonizing medium @xcite .",
    "the power - law flux depends on the input soft flux , the optical depth and the covering fraction of the comptonizing medium .",
    "increasing the soft input flux would result in a larger power - law flux and also may cause a lower coronal temperature due to cooling .",
    "our observations do not indicate an increase in the dbb flux .",
    "a sudden expansion of the corona ( while keeping the optical depth constant ) could explain the change in power - law flux if the volume increase corresponds to an increase in the covering fraction . before the transition ,",
    "the rms amplitude of variability is less than 1.8% , therefore there is at least a factor of four increase in the rms amplitude of variability , whereas , there is only a factor of 2 increase in the power - law flux .",
    "therefore the volume increase should have a non - linear relation to the variability amplitude to explain the strong increase .",
    "emergence of another soft photon source inside the corona ( with a spectrum not contributing in the pca range ) is another possible explanation for the transition .",
    "one candidate is synchrotron radiation inside the corona causing synchrotron self - compton @xcite . in this case",
    ", the hard power - law emission will be created by a combination of thermal comptonization of synchrotron and disk photons and non - thermal synchrotron self - compton . for the case of synchrotron ,",
    "the seed photons come from inside , while for the dbb , the seed photons come from both the outside and the inside of the corona , depending on the assumed geometry .",
    "it is possible that the strong variability is created more efficiently if the source is inside the corona .",
    "since the major change is not related to the temperature and the optical depth of the corona , it could also explain why the photon index varies little during the transition .",
    "the small change in the index may be due to additional cooling ( if the increase in the secondary soft flux is more than the decrease in the dbb flux ) , or the effect of additional non - thermal comptonization . if the strong variability in the is and the lhs is due to an additional soft component such as the synchrotron radiation , then the origin of low frequency qpos will not be the accretion disk @xcite .",
    "one can also envision a combination of scenarios , such as an expansion of corona while the synchrotron self - compton contribution is increasing .    another way to increase",
    "the power - law flux is to have two emission mechanisms producing power - law spectra . during the transition ,",
    "the second component , which also produces the timing noise , may become active .",
    "one possibility is that during the tds the bulk motion ( dynamical ) comptonization @xcite may be the main mechanism , whereas in the is , thermal comptonization starts to operate .",
    "this requires that both components produce very similar power - law spectra right at the transition .",
    "the secondary component in the is may also be direct synchrotron emission from a jet @xcite .",
    "this , again , requires that both emission mechanisms producing similar spectrum at the transition .",
    "there is another argument against this second possibility .",
    "the radio observations indicate that the emission from the compact jet began sometime between mjd  52933 and mjd  52940 , well after the transition to the is .",
    "( since there were no optical and infrared monitoring of the source during the transition , we were not able to pinpoint the time of jet formation . ) based on the comparison between the optical and ir light curves , x - ray and radio properties of gx  339 - 4 @xcite and 4u  1543@xmath047 @xcite , one can argue that the compact jet does not turn on before the source is settled in the lhs .",
    "h1743@xmath0322  seems to support this argument , as the compact radio jet was first detected after the source was in the lhs according to @xcite .",
    "we note that , during the rise , a compact radio core was observed , even after the transition from the lhs to the is @xcite .",
    "this shows that , even though the _ formation _ of the compact jet requires the lhs with almost no soft emission in the pca band , it can be _ sustained _ for a while in the presence of soft emission @xcite .",
    "there is a very strong correlation between the photon index and the qpo frequency up to the photon index of 2.2 . at high photon indices",
    ", the relation seems to be turning over .",
    "xte  j1550@xmath0564 and gro  j1655@xmath040 are two other sources that show a turnover in qpo frequency - photon index relation @xcite .",
    "relativistic effects may cause this turnover , if the qpo has an `` accretion ejection instability '' origin @xcite .",
    "we note that we can not conclusively claim that the relation turns over for h1743@xmath0322 , because the evidence for a turnover is based on a single data point ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : indcor ] ) . a saturation qpo frequency with photon index",
    "could be a sign of a system dominated by a converging inflow @xcite .",
    "there is a strong anti - correlation between the photon index and the rms amplitude of variability .",
    "this is a global relation that is valid for most black hole transients during outburst decay @xcite .",
    "one can also observe a strong correlation between the plr and the rms amplitude of variability at high spectral indices ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : indcor ] ) .",
    "this shows the diminishing effect of the dbb radiation on the rms amplitude of variability .",
    "another way to investigate the effect of dbb on the rms amplitude of variability is to compare the energy dependence of variability .",
    "[ fig : rmsen ] shows that for the observations with strong dbb emission , the rms amplitude of variability is much stronger in the higher energy band than that of the lower energy band .",
    "one can see a correlation between the ratio of the rms amplitude of variability in 2 bands and the plr .",
    "once the dbb emission is negligible ( plr @xmath31 ) , the relation between the rms amplitude of variability and energy is not that clear .",
    "the correlations between the plr and both the rms amplitude of variability and the variability ratio indicate that the variability is generated in the power - law component , and the dbb component regulates the rms amplitude of variability by changing the mean flux @xcite .",
    "we analyzed the _ rxte _",
    "x - ray observations of h1743@xmath0322  during its outburst decay in 2003 .",
    "in addition to the x - ray observations , we also obtained radio fluxes and discussed their evolution with respect to the state transitions .",
    "the evolution of the spectral and temporal fit parameters show similar properties to those of other sources .",
    "the transition from the tds to the is is marked by a strong increase in the rms amplitude of variability and power - law flux .",
    "this transition may correspond to the emergence of a secondary soft component , such as synchrotron radiation , or a secondary power - law component .",
    "future multi - wavelength observations of these transients may help making the distinction . at the time of this transition the radio core was not detected .",
    "three days after the transition , the source went back to the tds for one day , indicating that the is is not stable .",
    "after the source returned to the is , it gradually reached the low hard state .",
    "the core is detected in the radio band when the x - ray spectrum is totally dominated by the power - law emission .",
    "there is a strong correlation between the photon index and the qpo frequency . at high qpo frequencies and photon indices",
    ", the correlation shows a turnover ( or saturates ) .",
    "the threshold plr for the state transition , and the correlation between the plr and the ratio of rms amplitude of variability in 615 kev and 36 kev bands show that the dbb emission dilutes the amplitude of variability .",
    "when the dbb emission is absent , the rms amplitude of variability in two bands are similar .",
    "this may indicate that the origin of the variability and the qpo is the corona itself , rather than the disk .",
