    "in this paper we study a model where two species red and blue compete for space on the first quadrant of @xmath9 . at time @xmath10",
    "every vertex of @xmath11 is in one of the three possible states : vacant , occupied by a red particle , or occupied by a blue particle .",
    "an unoccupied vertex @xmath12 may be colonized from either @xmath13 or @xmath14 at rate equal to the number of occupied south - west  neighbors ; at the instant of first colonization , the vertex flips to the color of a randomly chosen occupied south - west neighbor .",
    "once occupied , a vertex remains occupied forever , but its color may flip : the flip rate is equal to the number of south - west neighbors occupied by particles of the opposite color .",
    "the state of the system at any time @xmath5 is given by the pair @xmath15 where @xmath16 and @xmath17 denote the set of sites occupied by red and blue particles respectively .",
    "the set @xmath18 evolves precisely as the occupied set in the oriented richardson model , and thus , for any initial configuration with only finitely many occupied sites , the growth of this set is governed by the _ shape theorem _ , which states that the set of occupied vertices scaled by time converges to a deterministic set @xmath19 ( see for example @xcite ) . a rigorous construction and more detailed description of the oriented competition model is given in section [ sec : richardson ] .",
    "the simplest interesting initial configuration has a single red particle at the vertex @xmath1 , a single blue particle at @xmath2 , and all other sites unoccupied .",
    "we shall refer to this as the _ default _ initial configuration .",
    "when the oriented competition process is started in the default initial configuration , the red and blue particles at @xmath1 and @xmath2 are protected : their colors can never be flipped .",
    "thus , both colors survive forever w.p.1 .",
    "computer simulations for the oriented competition model started in the default and other finite initial configurations suggest that the shapes of the regions occupied by the red and blue types stabilize as times goes to infinity  see figure [ orientedpicture ] for snapshots of two different realizations of the model , each started from the default initial configuration .",
    "a peculiar feature of the stablization is that the limit shapes of the red and blue regions are partly deterministic and partly random : the southeast corner of the occupied region is always equally divided between the red and blue populations , with boundary lying along the line @xmath20 .",
    "however , the outer section seems to stablize in a random union of angular wedges rooted at a point near the center of the richardson shape .",
    "although the location of the root appears to be deterministic , both the number and angles of the outer red and blue regions vary quite dramatically from one simulation to the next .",
    "[ orientedpicture ]    [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]     suppose now that at time zero there is one red particle at @xmath1 and one blue particle at @xmath2 .",
    "as in the growth model , all other vertices are occupied by white particles .",
    "the flip rules are the same as in the growth model : every vertex flips to the color of a randomly chosen south - west nearest neighbor with exponential rate @xmath0 . at time",
    "@xmath10 the color of a vertex @xmath21 is uniquely determined by its voter - admissible path .",
    "the red cluster @xmath22 and the blue cluster @xmath23 are defined to be the sets of all vertices @xmath21 such that the unique reverse voter - admissible path beginning at @xmath24 terminates respectively at @xmath1 and @xmath2 . for @xmath10 define @xmath25",

    "1-c_1 t^2   \\exp\\ { -c_2 t^{(\\alpha-1/2 ) } \\}.\\ ] ]    we only show ( [ triangle1 ] ) , since the proof of ( [ triangle2 ] ) is identical .",
    "first , observe that by proposition [ growth : environment ] there exist @xmath31 @xmath32   >   1-c_1 t^2   \\exp\\ { -c_2 t^{(\\alpha-1/2 ) } \\}.\\ ] ] second , note that with probability exponentially close to one voter admissible paths of all vertices @xmath33 terminate below main diagonal .",
    "that is , there exist @xmath34 such that @xmath35 the result ( [ triangle1 ] ) immediately follows from the above observations .",
    "if the competition model and the competition model in hostile environment are constructed on the same percolation structure @xmath36 , then almost surely for all @xmath10 @xmath37 hence it follows from proposition [ half - coloring : envir ] that almost surely for all large @xmath5 @xmath38 @xmath39 thus , asymptotically ( as @xmath5 goes to infinity ) the square @xmath40 is colored deterministically .",
    "in particular , the region below the main diagonal is red , and the region above the diagonal is blue .",
    "this proves the first part of theorem [ maintheorem ] .",
    "the next question is what happens in the region @xmath41 . for each @xmath42 and any @xmath43 , define the _ angular sector _",
    "@xmath44 of angular measure @xmath45 rooted at @xmath8 and centered at @xmath21 by @xmath46 fix @xmath47 , @xmath48 and @xmath49 such that @xmath50 . for @xmath43 and @xmath51 ,",
